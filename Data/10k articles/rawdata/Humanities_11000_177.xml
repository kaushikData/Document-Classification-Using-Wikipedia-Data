      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20217">'''The 10 Essential Public Health Services''' is a US government document which codifies the responsibilities of [[public health]] agencies and institutions in the United States.&lt;ref name="i"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "National Public Health Performance Standards Program (NPHPSP): 10 Essential Public Health Services." Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/nphpsp/essentialservices.html. Accessed on 2/6/13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes==
Organized according to the "three fundamental purposes of public health" — assessment, policy development, and assurance — the essential services include the following:

===Assessment===
*Monitor and evaluate health status to identify community health problems.
*Diagnose and investigate health problems and health hazards in the community.

===Policy development===
*Inform, educate, and empower people about health issues.
*Mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems.
*Develop policies and plans that support individual and community health efforts.

===Assurance===
*Enforce laws and regulations that protect and ensure public health and safety.
*Link people to needed personal health services and assure the provision of health care when otherwise unavailable.
*Assure a competent public and personal health care workforce.
*Evaluate effectiveness, accessibility, and quality of personal and population-based health services.
*Research for new insights and innovative solutions to health problems.

==History==
In 1988, the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) released an assessment of the U.S. public health system titled, ''The Future of Public Health''. The report described the network of county, state, and national public health agencies as being in "disarray" and prompted a national discussion about the state of public health in the country. Questioning the ability of existing public health systems to provide essential services, the report sought to establish a comprehensive framework delineating the "three fundamental purposes of public health." These purposes included "assessment, policy development, and assurance."&lt;ref name="iii"&gt;Institute of Medicine. Committee for the Study of the Future of Public Health. (1988). The future of public health. Washington DC: The National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though health policy academicians identified with and understood the IOM framework, policy makers found its highly conceptual language difficult to apply. Therefore, as part of President Clinton’s 1994 healthcare reform efforts, a federal working-group was tasked with reviewing and supplementing the framework. Under the auspices of both the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s]] (CDC) Public Health Practice Program Office and the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the group sought to
#explain what public health is,
#clarify the role of public health within the larger healthcare system, and
#provide accountability by linking public health performance to health outcomes.

These efforts culminated in the publication of ''The Essential Services of Public Health'' in late 1994.&lt;ref name="iv"&gt;Harrell JA, Baker EL. The essential services of public health. Leadership Public Health. 1994;3(3): 27–30&lt;/ref&gt;
Public Health Units
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/common/system/services/phu/locations.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
The report was well received. Public health agencies and professional organizations began to align guidelines and employ self-assessment tools in support of the ten Essential Services.&lt;ref name="v"&gt;Scutchfield, F. D., Mays, G. P., &amp; Lurie, N. (2009). Applying Health Services Research to Public Health Practice: An Emerging Priority. Health Services Research, 44(5p2), 1775–1787. {{doi|10.1111/j.1475-6773.2009.01007.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC launched a number of research projects aimed at developing strategies for measuring how well public health agencies provided the services. Many of these studies were the first of their kind and ushered in an era of health agency monitoring and assessment.&lt;ref name="vi"&gt;Miller, C. A., K. S. Moore, T. B. Richards, and C. McKaig. 1994. "A Screening Survey to Assess Local Public Health Performance." Public Health Report 109 (5): 659–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vii"&gt;Turnock, B. J., and A. S. Handler. 1997. "From Measuring to Improving Public Health Practice." Annual Review of Public Health 18: 261–282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="viii"&gt;Handler, A. S., B. J. Turnock, W. Hall, S. Potsic, J. Munson, R. Nalluri, and E. H. Vaughn. 1995. "A Strategy for Measuring Local Public Health Practice." American Journal of Preventive Medicine 11 (6 Suppl): 29–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the CDC and several national public health associations launched the [https://www.cdc.gov/nphpsp/ National Public Health Performance Standards Program (NPHPSP)]. With the goal of developing a consensus-based set of performance standards for state and local public health delivery systems, the NPHPSP adopted the Essential Public Health Services as "the fundamental framework" underpinning its assessment strategy. The NPHPSP consists of three instruments — The State Public Health System Assessment, The Local Public Health System Assessment, and The Local Public Health Governance Assessment — and covers the gamut of public health action as described by the Essential Public Health Services.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt;

==List of services==

===Monitor and evaluate health status to identify community health problems===
It is essential for public health organizations to monitor and evaluate the health status of populations in order to identify trends and to target health resources. Components of this service include: utilization of appropriate tools to interpret and disseminate data to audiences of interest; collaboration in integrating and managing public health; and accurate and periodic assessment of the community’s health status.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; Specifically, public health organizations can monitor and evaluate the health status of their populations by creating a disease reporting system, community health profiles, and health surveys. For example, the Los Angeles Department of Public Health completes a Los Angeles County Health Survey (LACHS) every two to four years to obtain population-based data.&lt;ref name="ix"&gt;County of Los Angeles Public Health. "Frequently Asked Questions About The Los Angeles County Health Survey" Retrieved from http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/ha/LAC HS_FAQs.htm. Accessed on 2/7/13.&lt;/ref&gt; This information is used for public health assessment and planning and for evaluating changes in health over time in Los Angeles County.

===Diagnose and investigate health problems and health hazards in the community===
In order to appropriately allocate public health resources, it is essential to diagnose and investigate health problems and hazards in the community. Components in this service include: population-based screening of diseases; access to public health laboratories capable of completing rapid screening and high volume testing; and epidemiologic investigations of disease outbreaks and patterns of disease.&lt;ref name="i"/&gt; The Los Angeles County Health and Examination Survey (LA HANES) was piloted in 2011 and aims to establish a profile description of health outcomes of residents of Los Angeles County (e.g. adult obesity and cardiovascular disease is monitored via collection of physical measurements such as blood pressure and body mass index). These survey results will inform public education and chronic disease prevention efforts. Emergency preparedness is also an essential component of public health organizations. Teams must be available and prepared to combat natural disasters, severe weather, outbreaks, [[bioterrorism]], mass casualties and chemical emergencies.

===Inform, educate, and empower people about health issues===
Once public health priorities have been established through monitoring and investigation of health problems in the community, educational activities that promote improved health should be disseminated. Components in this service include: both the availability of health information and educational resources and the presence of health education and health promotion programs.&lt;ref name="i"/&gt; This can be achieved through media advocacy and social marketing. An example of this is the Eat Less, Weigh Less campaign executed by the [[Los Angeles County Department of Public Health]] that aims to increase awareness about appropriate portion sizes using advertisements on buses, billboards and social media.&lt;ref name="x"&gt;Choose Health LA. "Eat Healthy." Retrieved from http://www.choosehealthLA.com/eat-healthy/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217055003/http://www.choosehealthla.com/eat-healthy/ |date=2013-02-17 }}. Accessed on 2/4/13.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also essential to establish health education and health promotion program partnerships with organizations in the community, such as schools, churches and employment facilities.

===Mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems===
Public health organizations on the local, state and national level can mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems. Components of this service include: building coalitions to utilize the full range of available resources; convening and facilitating partnerships that will undertake defined health improvement projects; and provide assistance to partners and communities to solve health problems.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; Of particular importance is identification of potential stakeholders who will contribute to or benefit from public health activities. [[First 5 LA]] is a community partner who supports targeted programs that address the needs of Los Angeles County children ages zero to five and their families.&lt;ref name="xi"&gt;[[First 5 LA]]. "Champions of Our Children." Retrieved from http://www.first5la.org/About-Us. Accessed on 2/5/13.&lt;/ref&gt; They work closely with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health to improve the physical and emotional health of this population. It is important to note that many of these stakeholders may not be considered to be health-related at first glance. For example, organizations involved in urban planning may be influential in improving the health of its residents. This could include increasing the walkability of a community or the number of parks or bike trails in a neighborhood.

===Develop policies and plans that support individual and community health efforts===
Policies can be effective in modifying human behavior and reducing negative health outcomes. Components in this service include: development of policy to guide the practice of public health; alignment of resources and strategies for community health efforts; and systematic health planning strategies to guide community health improvement.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; In response to increasing rates of obesity and cardiovascular disease, the New York City Board of Health passed a ban on the sale of sodas and other sugary drinks larger than 16&amp;nbsp;ounces at restaurants, street carts and movie theaters.&lt;ref name="xii"&gt;The New York Times. "New York Plans to Ban Sale of Big Sizes of Sugary". Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/31/nyregion/bloomberg-plans-a-ban-on-large-sugared-drinks.html?pagewanted=all. Accessed on 2/6/13.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to policies that can support health efforts, laws can reduce negative health outcomes. For example, dram shop liability is a law that holds the owner or server at a bar or restaurant where a patron consumed their last alcoholic beverage responsible for injuries or deaths caused as a result of alcohol-related incidents. A systematic review completed by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services, found strong evidence of the effectiveness of this law in reducing alcohol-related harms.&lt;ref name="xiii"&gt;Rammohan, V, et al. "Effects of Dram Shop Liability and Enhanced Overservice Law Enforcement Initiatives on Excessive Alcohol Consumption and Related Harms: Two Community Guide Systematic Reviews." Am J Prev Med 2011;41(3):334 –343.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforce laws and regulations that protect and ensure public health and safety===
It is important that individuals and organizations comply with existing laws and regulations in order to ensure the overall health and safety of the general public. Components of this service include: reviewing, evaluating, and revising laws and regulations put in place to protect the health and safety of the public; educating persons and organizations about these laws and regulations to improve compliance and encourage enforcement of them; and enforcing actions that protect the health of the public (e.g., protection of drinking water; enforcement of clean air standards; enforcement of laws prohibiting the sale of alcoholic and tobacco products to minors, of laws concerning the use of seat belts and child safety seats; mandating childhood immunizations; facilitating timely follow-ups in the event of hazards and outbreaks of exposure-related diseases; monitoring quality of health services; conducting the timely review of new drugs, biologics, and medical devices; ensuring food safety; and enforcing housing and sanitation codes).&lt;ref name="i" /&gt;

===Link people to needed personal health services and assure the provision of health care when otherwise unavailable===
Having access to care when it is needed is important in helping individuals prevent and avoid unfavorable health outcomes and medical costs. At the local level, components of this service include: identifying populations that face barriers to accessing health services and addressing their personal health needs, assuring the linkage of these populations to appropriate health services by coordinating provider services, and developing and implementing interventions that address the barriers they face in attempting to access care. At the state and governance levels, components of this service include: assessing access to and availability of state health services; partnering with public, private, and non-profit sectors to provide a coordinated system of health care; assuring access to this coordinated health care system by using outreach efforts that link individuals to the health services they need; developing and implementing a continuous improvement process to assure the equitable distribution of resources for those in greatest need of these services.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; The National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) employs this service idea as one of the action steps for achieving increased access to care and improved health outcomes for people living with HIV.&lt;ref name="xiv"&gt;The White House. "Implementing the National HIV/AIDS Strategy: Overview of the Agency Operational Plans." Retrieved from http://aids.gov/federal-resources/national-hiv-aids-strategy/nhas-operational-plan-overview.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213232017/http://aids.gov/federal-resources/national-hiv-aids-strategy/nhas-operational-plan-overview.pdf |date=2013-02-13 }}. Accessed on 2/6/13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assure a competent public and personal health care workforce===
Health care workers and staff who are competent (i.e., skilled in the core principles of public health practice) are more likely to provide care and other services more effectively and efficiently compared to those who are not. Components of this service include: making sure that the workforce meets the health needs of the population, maintaining public health workforce standards by developing and implementing efficient licensure and credentialing processes and incorporating core public health competencies into personnel systems, and adopting continuous quality improvement methods and long-term learning opportunities for public health workforce members.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; In two 2002 reports, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommended instituting a certification examination as a way of ensuring minimum competence in public health.&lt;ref name="xv"&gt;Institute of Medicine (IOM). "The Future of the Public’s Health in the 21st Century." Retrieved from http://iom.edu/Reports/2002/The-Future-of-the-Publics-Health-in-the-21st-Century.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811070844/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2002/The-Future-of-the-Publics-Health-in-the-21st-Century.aspx |date=2010-08-11 }}. Accessed on 2/7/13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xvi"&gt;Institute of Medicine (IOM). "Who Will Keep the Public Healthy: Educating Public Health Professionals for the 21st Century." Retrieved from http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2002/Who-Will-Keep-the-Public-Healthy-Educating-Public-Health-Professionals-for-the-21st-Century.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131227130612/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2002/Who-Will-Keep-the-Public-Healthy-Educating-Public-Health-Professionals-for-the-21st-Century.aspx |date=2013-12-27 }}. Accessed on 2/7/13&lt;/ref&gt; Web-based training strategies may be useful in providing the long-term learning opportunities that many current and upcoming public health workers need in order to serve as well-informed advocates of public health and safety.&lt;ref name="xvii"&gt;Ballew, P. et al. "Developing web-based training for public health practitioners: what can we learn from a review of five disciplines?" Health Education Research. 2012;1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evaluate effectiveness, accessibility, and quality of personal and population-based health services ===
Given scarce resources, it is important to keep track of whether or not programs and/or policies end up producing intended outcomes. Components of this service include: assessing the accessibility, quality and effectiveness of services and programs delivered; providing policymakers with the information they need in order to make well-informed decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources; tracking efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of services analyzing data on health status and service utilization; and striving to improve the public health system’s capacity to well serve the population.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; Cost-effectiveness analysis has been proposed as one possible strategy for informing policymakers on how best to allocate health care resources.&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;Eichler, H, Kong, SX, Gerth, WC, and Mavros, P. "Use of cost-effectiveness analysis in health-care resource allocation decision-making: how are cost-effectiveness thresholds expected to emerge." Value in Health. 2004;7(5): 518-528.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research for new insights and innovative solutions to health problems ===
Through research, the health and health care problems that individuals face can be better understood, and therefore be better and more appropriately addressed given the evidence provided by such research efforts. Components of this service include: fostering the development of a continuum of innovative solutions for health programming in terms of both practical field-based efforts as well as academic efforts, establishing a consortium of research institutions and other institutions of higher learning to encourage more collaborative and cross-cutting efforts, and ensuring the public health system’s capacity to perform timely epidemiological and health policy analyses.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt;

'''''An Argument to Prove that the Abolishing of Christianity in England May, as Things Now Stand Today, be Attended with Some Inconveniences, and Perhaps not Produce Those Many Good Effects Proposed Thereby''''', commonly referred to as '''''An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity''''', is a satirical essay by [[Jonathan Swift]] defending Christianity, and in particular, [[Anglicanism]], against contemporary assaults by its various opponents, including [[freethinkers]], [[deists]], [[Nontrinitarianism|Antitrinitarians]], [[atheists]], [[Socinians]], and other so-called "Dissenters."  The essay was written in 1712&lt;ref&gt;Brian Young (1998), Religion and the Enlightenment, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; and, as was common at the time, was distributed widely as a pamphlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = A Modest Proposal and Other Satires | chapter = Introduction | page = 18 | first = George R | last = Levine | publisher = Prometheus Books | year = 1995 | ISBN = 0-87975-919-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The essay is known for its sophisticated, multi-layered irony, and is regarded as a prime example of political satire.

==Overview==
In the essay, Swift answers several real and rhetorical arguments against Christianity. First, he responds to the argument that the abolition of Christianity would expand the liberty of conscience by arguing that if great wits could not denounce the Church, they might instead turn to the denunciation of the government, causing political unrest. Swift then addresses the argument that the Church, then supported by government funds, was a drain on resources that might be better spent elsewhere. Swift responds that if the funds used to support the clergy were used instead to fund freethinking young gentlemen, the money would, in short time, be squandered away on vices, and divided by [[divorce|disagreeable marriages]]. Next, Swift counters the argument that the abolition of Christianity would open up another day of the week (the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]]) to commercial activities for the benefit of the nation by arguing that the Sabbath provides benefits by allowing lawyers time to write their briefs, merchants to tally their books, and others to exercise, go to coffeehouses, and otherwise enjoy themselves, ironically implying that the argument is specious because the Sabbath was not kept as intended in any case. Swift then counters the argument that abolishing Christianity would remove arbitrary sectarian distinctions between [[British Whig Party|Whig]] and [[British Tory Party|Tory]], [[High Church]] and [[Low Church]], etc. that arguably damaged civil discourse and politics, by arguing that Christianity merely stands in as a convenient and arbitrary source of such distinctions and that abolishing it would only allow other equally arbitrary distinctions, essentially arguing that the problem is merely semantic and that such distinctions are a part of human nature.

The irony becomes more explicit as Swift next addresses the argument that it is ridiculous to employ a class of people to wail on one day a week against behaviour that is the constant practice of all men alive on the other six by arguing that such vices, including wine and fine silks, were made all the more pleasurable by virtue of their being forbidden by the Christian mores of the era. In response to the facetious rhetorical argument that the abolition of Christianity would lead to the abolition of all religion, and with it such "grievous prejudices of education" as virtue, honour, conscience and justice, Swift argues that such concepts had already been banished from contemporary education, and that this argument was, therefore, moot. Answering the argument that the abolition of the gospel would benefit the vulgar, and that religion was put in force to keep the "lower part of the world in awe by fear of invisible powers," Swift points out that the vast majority of people were already unbelievers who only employed religion to quiet "peevish" children and provide topics for amusing discussion. Swift addresses the argument that abolishing Christianity will contribute to the uniting of a people divided by various sects of by arguing that humanity has an inborn "spirit of opposition" such that if Christianity were not extant to provide a context for such natural oppositions among men, this natural tendency would instead be spent in contravention of the laws and disturbance of the public peace.

Finally, Swift points out potential negative consequences to the abolition of Christianity. First, Swift points out that reformers do not appreciate the advantage to them of having such an easy target upon which to practice their criticism and wit with such little risk to their persons in response as the Church and clergy; and rhetorically asks what institution could adequately replace religion in this role. Next, Swift warns that the abolition of Christianity (specifically the Anglican church) could lead to a rise in [[Presbyterianism]], or worse in his mind, Catholicism. Swift's ironic defence of Christianity becomes more earnest and apparent as he finally proposes that if Christianity were to be abolished, all religion should be so banned, so as to fully free men from all bounds on their thinking and behaviour, in order that they may be allowed to freely engage in such vices as prostitution and drunkenness. In conclusion, Swift proposes that if Christianity is to be abolished, it ought not be done until the conclusion of wars in which England was then involved, as many of the country's allies were devoutly Christian, or at least, in the case of [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]], religious. In a final ironic flourish, Swift warns that if Christianity were abolished, the stock market would fall, costing Great Britain more than the country had ever spent for Christianity's preservation, and that there would be no reason to lose that much money merely for the sake of destroying the faith.

[[File:MapAleppo 1912.jpg|thumb|Aleppo in 1912]]
The '''Ancient City of Aleppo''' is the historic city centre of [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]]. Before the [[Syrian Civil War]], many districts of the ancient city remained essentially unchanged since its construction during the 12th to the 16th century. Being subjected to constant invasions and political instability, the inhabitants of the city were forced to build cell-like quarters and districts that were socially and economically independent. Each district was characterized by the religious and ethnic characteristics of its inhabitants.

The Old City of Aleppo – composed of the ancient city within the walls and the old cell-like quarters outside the walls – has an approximate area of {{convert|350|ha|acre km2}}, housing more than 120,000 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=bleeker |url=http://www.historische-aleppo-seife.de/engl_history.html |title=Alepposeife: Aleppo history |publisher=Historische-aleppo-seife.de |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characterized by its large mansions, narrow alleys, covered [[souq]]s and ancient [[caravanserais]], the Ancient City of Aleppo became a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="Aleppo plan"&gt;{{cite web |title = eAleppo:Aleppo city major plans throughout the history |url = http://www.esyria.sy/ealeppo/index.php?p=stories&amp;category=misc&amp;filename=201009251220032 |language= Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sections in the [[Al-Madina Souq]] and other medieval buildings in the ancient city were [[List of heritage sites damaged during the Syrian Civil War|destroyed and ruined or burnt]] as a result of clashes between the Syrian Arab Army and the rebel forces of Jabhat al-Nusra, in what is called the [[Battle of Aleppo (2012–13)|Battle of Aleppo]], launched by the opposition JN armed groups on 25 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/world/fighting-in-aleppo-starts-fire-in-medieval-souks-313673.html |title=Fighting in Aleppo starts fire in medieval souks |publisher=Kyivpost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, the opposition groups of the Islamic Front claimed responsibility for destroying a series of major historic buildings being used as fortified bases by the Syrian Army in the old city including the justice palace, the Carlton hotel and the old building of the city council.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aksalser.com/?page=view_articles&amp;id=cdff95d4f3ae930a739f3837b1620b9b Bombing of the justice palace]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all4syria.info/Archive/131356 Bombing of Carlton hotel]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slabnews.com/article/61694 Bombing of the city council]&lt;/ref&gt;

30%&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-01-20/unesco-30-percent-of-aleppos-ancient-city-destroyed&lt;/ref&gt; of the Ancient City of Aleppo has been destroyed in the fighting.

==Origins and founding==
[[File:Al-Shibani Alp12.JPG|thumb|left|Pattern of ancient Aleppo]]
[[File:Ancient Aleppo view.JPG|thumb|[[Khusruwiyah Mosque]], Khan al-Shouneh and Carlton Citadel Hotel were all destroyed during the battle of Aleppo]]
Lying on the left bank of [[Queiq River]] the ancient city was surrounded by a circle of eight hills surrounding a prominent central hill on which the castle (originally a temple dating to the 2nd millennium BC) was erected in the shape of an [[acropolis]]. The radius of the circle is about {{convert|10|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. The hills are Tell as-Sawda, Tell ʕāysha, Tell as-Sett, Tell al-Yāsmīn (Al-ʕaqaba), Tell al-Ansāri (Yārūqiyya), ʕan at-Tall, al-Jallūm, Baḥsīta.&lt;ref name="Duden6"&gt;{{cite book | editor = Alexander Russell | title = The Natural History of Aleppo | edition = 1st | year = 1856 | publisher = Unknown | location = London | isbn = | page = 266}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an approximate area of {{convert|160|ha|acre km2}}, the ancient city was enclosed within a historic wall of {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in circuit that was last rebuilt by the [[Mamluke]]s. The wall has since disappeared in its most parts. It had nine gates (5 of them are well preserved) and was surrounded by a broad deep ditch.&lt;ref name="Duden6"/&gt;

The newer ''[[Al-Jdayde|Jdeydeh]]'' quarters of the old city were first built by the Christians during the early 15th century in the northern suburbs of the ancient city, after the Mongol withdrawal from Aleppo. [[Al-Jdayde|Jdeydeh]] is one of the finest examples of a cell-like quarter in Aleppo. As a result of the economic development, many other quarters were established outside the walls of the ancient city during the 15th and 16th centuries.

===Pre-history and pre-classical era===
[[File:Ancient Aleppo from Citadel.jpg|thumb|Ancient Aleppo]]
[[File:Udgravning (Citadellet Aleppo).jpg|thumb|Hadad Temple Inside [[Aleppo Citadel]]]]
Aleppo has scarcely been touched by archaeologists, since the modern city occupies its ancient site. 

====Early Bronze Age====
Aleppo appears in historical records as an important city much earlier than [[Damascus]]. The first record of Aleppo may from the third millennium BC if the identification of Aleppo as [[Armi (Syria)|Armi]], a city-state closely related to [[Ebla]] is correct. Armi has also been identified with the modern [[Tell Bazi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AaZg0ypYrnQC&amp;pg=PA501 |title= Ebla and its Landscape: Early State Formation in the Ancient Near East|author1=Paolo Matthiae |author2=Nicoló Marchetti |page= 501|isbn= 9781611322286|date= 2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giovanni Pettinato]] describes Armi as Ebla's alter ego. [[Naram-Sin of Akkad]] (or his grandfather [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]]) destroyed both Ebla and Arman in the 23rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Pettinato, Giovanni (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1991) ''Ebla, a new look at history'' p.135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hawkins, John David 2000 p.388"&gt;Hawkins, John David (2000) ''Inscriptions of the iron age'' p.388&lt;/ref&gt;

====Middle Bronze Age====
In the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian]] period, Aleppo's name appears as Ḥalab (Ḥalba) for the first time.&lt;ref name="Hawkins, John David 2000 p.388"/&gt; Aleppo was the capital of the important [[Amorite]] dynasty of [[Yamhad|Yamḥad]]. The kingdom of Yamḥad (ca. 1800-1600 BC), alternatively known as the 'land of Ḥalab,' was the most powerful in the Near East at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhrt, Amélie (1998) ''The ancient Near East'' p.100&lt;/ref&gt;

Yamḥad was destroyed by the [[Hittites]] under [[Mursilis I]] in the 16th century BC. However, Aleppo soon resumed its leading role in Syria when the Hittite power in the region waned due to internal strife.&lt;ref name="Hawkins, John David 2000 p.388"/&gt;

====Late Bronze Age====
Taking advantage of the power vacuum in the region, [[Parshatatar]], king of the [[Hurrian]] kingdom of [[Mitanni]], conquered Aleppo in the 15th century BC. Subsequently, Aleppo found itself on the frontline in the struggle between  the Mitanni and the Hittites and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Hawkins, John David 2000 p.388"/&gt;

The Hittite [[Suppiluliumas I]] permanently defeated Mitanni and conquered Aleppo in the 14th century BC. Aleppo had [[cult]]ic importance to the Hittites for being the center of worship of the [[Teshub|Storm-God]].&lt;ref name="Hawkins, John David 2000 p.388"/&gt;

==== Iron Age ====
When the Hittite kingdom collapsed in the 12th century BC, Aleppo became part of the [[Syro-Hittite]] kingdom of [[Palistin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=q8Z7AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= Ancient Syria: A Three Thousand Year History|author=Trevor Bryce|page= 111}}&lt;/ref&gt; then the [[Aramaean]] [[Syro-Hittite]] kingdom of [[Bit Agusi]] (which had its capital at [[Arpad (Syria)|Arpad]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=vXljf8JqmkoC&amp;pg=PA389#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Cambridge Ancient History: The prehistory of the Balkans; and the Middle East and the Aegean world, tenth to eighth centuries B.C.. Volume 3. Part 1|author=John Boardman|page= 389}}&lt;/ref&gt; it stayed part of that kingdom until conquered by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] In the 9th century BC, and became part of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] until the late 7th century BC, before passing through the hands of the [[Neo-Babylonian]]s and the [[Achamenid|Achamenid Persians]].

=== Classical antiquity ===
[[Alexander the Great]] took over the city in 333 BC. [[Seleucus Nicator]] established a [[Hellenic Republic|Hellenic]] settlement in the site between 301-286 BC. He called it ''Beroea'' (Βέροια), after [[Veria|Beroea]] in [[Macedon]].

Northern Syria was the centre of gravity of the Hellenistic colonizing activity, and therefore of Hellenistic culture in the [[Seleucid Empire]]. As did other Hellenized cities of the Seleucid kingdom, Beroea probably enjoyed a measure of local autonomy, with a local civic assembly or [[Boule (ancient Greece)|''boulē'']] composed of free Hellenes.&lt;ref name="Phenix, Robert R. 2008"&gt;Phenix, Robert R. (2008) ''The sermons on Joseph of [[Balai of Qenneshrin]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Beroea remained under Seleucid rule for nearly 300 years until the last holdings of the Seleucid dynasty were handed over to [[Pompey]] in 64 BC, at which time they became a [[Roman Syria|Roman province]]. Rome's presence afforded relative stability in northern Syria for over three centuries. Although the province was administered by a [[legatus|legate]] from Rome, Rome did not impose its administrative organization on the Greek-speaking ruling class.&lt;ref name="Phenix, Robert R. 2008"/&gt;

Beroea is mentioned in [[2 Maccabees|2 Macc.]] 13:3.

===Medieval period and the expansion of the city===
[[File:Aleppo Citadel 18 - Throne Hall.jpg|thumb|The throne hall of the citadel restored during the [[Mamluk]] period]]
The [[Sassanid]] Persians invaded Syria briefely in the early 7th century. Soon after Aleppo fell to [[Muslim conquests|Arab]]s under [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] in 637. In 944, it became the seat of an independent Emirate under the [[Hamdanid]] prince [[Sayf al-Daula]], and enjoyed a period of great prosperity.

On 9 August 1138, [[1138 Aleppo earthquake|a deadly earthquake]] ravaged the city and the surrounding area. Although estimates from this time are very unreliable, it is believed that 230,000 people died, making it the [[List of earthquakes#Deadliest earthquakes on record|fifth deadliest]] earthquake in recorded history.

After [[Timur|Tamerlane]] invaded Aleppo in 1400 and destroyed it, the Christians migrated out of the city walls and established their own cell in 1420, at the northwestern suburbs of the city, thus founding the quarters of [[Al-Jdayde|Jdeydeh]]. The inhabitants of [[Al-Jdayde|Jdeydeh]] were mainly brokers who facilitated trade between foreign traders and local merchants. Many other districts were built outside the historic walls during the 15th and 16th centuries.

Mention is made of the city, by one of the witches, in [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Macbeth]], written between 1603 and 1607.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shakespeare.mit.edu/macbeth/macbeth.1.3.html |title=The Tragedy of Macbeth: Act 1, Scene 3  |publisher=Shakespeare.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main sights==
Aleppo is characterized by mixed architectural styles, having been ruled, among the other, by Romans, Byzantines, Seljuqs,  Mamluks and Ottomans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yacoub |first=Khaled |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSTRE66F1ED20100716 |title=Travel Postcard: 48 hours in Aleppo, Syria |publisher=Reuters |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various types of 13th and 14th centuries constructions, such as caravanserais, caeserias, Quranic schools, hammams and religious buildings are found in the [[Old City of Aleppo|old city]]. The quarters of [[Al-Jdayde|Jdeydeh]] district are home to numerous 16th and 17th-century houses of the  Aleppine bourgeoisie, featuring   stone engravings.

===Souqs and Khans===
{{Main article|Al-Madina Souq}}
[[File:Aleppo narrow Armenian quarter.jpg|thumb|upright|''Bawabet al-Yasmin'' near the wool market, [[Al-Jdayde|Jdeideh]] ]]
[[File:Aleppo-suq-Alp.JPG|thumb|left|Ancient Aleppo, the entrance to [[Al-Madina Souq]]]]
The city's strategic trading position attracted settlers of all races and beliefs who wished to take advantage of the commercial roads that met in Aleppo from as far as China and [[Mesopotamia]] to the east, [[Europe]] to the west, and the [[Fertile Crescent]] and [[Egypt]] to the south. The largest covered [[souq]]-market in the world is in Aleppo, with an approximate length of {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esyria.sy/ealeppo/index.php?p=stories&amp;category=round&amp;filename=201010291220021 |title=eAleppo: The old Souqs of Aleppo (in Arabic) |publisher=Esyria.sy |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Al-Madina Souq]]'', as it is locally known, is an active trade centre for imported luxury goods, such as raw [[silk]] from [[Iran]], spices and dyes from India, and coffee from [[Damascus]]. Souq al-Madina is also home to local products such as wool, agricultural products and [[Aleppo soap|soap]]. Most of the souqs  date back to the 14th century and are named after various professions and crafts, hence the wool souq, the copper souq, and so on. Aside from trading, the souq accommodated the traders and their goods in ''khans'' ([[caravanserai]]s) and scattered in the souq. Other types of small market-places were called ''caeserias'' (قيساريات). Caeserias are smaller than khans in their sizes and functioned as workshops for craftsmen. Most of the khans took their names after their location in the souq and function, and are characterized with their beautiful façades and entrances with fortified wooden doors.

The most significant khans within and along the covered area of Souq al-Madina are: ''Khan al-Qadi'' from 1450, ''Khan al-Saboun'' from the early 16th century, ''Khan al-Nahhaseen'' from 1539, ''Khan al-Shouneh'' from 1546, ''Khan al-Jumrok'' from 1574, ''Souq Khan al-Wazir'' from 1682, ''Souq al-Farrayin'', ''Souq al-Dira''', ''Souq al-Hiraj'', ''Souq al-Attarine'', ''Souq az-Zirb'', ''Souq Marcopoli'', ''Souq as-Siyyagh'', ''The Venetians' Khan'',*''Souq Khan al-Harir'' from the second half of the 16th century, ''Suweiqa'', etc.

Other traditional souqs and khans in [[Al-Jdayde|Jdeydeh]] quarter (outside the walled city):
*''Souq al-Hokedun'' or "Khan al-Quds". Hokedun means "the spiritual house" in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], as it was built to serve as a settlement for the Armenian pilgrims on their way to [[Jerusalem]]. The old part of the Hokedun dates back to the late 15th and early 16th centuries while the newer part was built during the 17th century. Nowadays, it is turned into a big souq with a large number of stores specialized in garment trade.
*''Souq as-Souf'' or the wool market, located at Salibeh street, surrounded with the old churches of the quarter.
*''Bawabet al-Qasab'', a trade centre for wooden products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Aleppo.us: Khans of Aleppo (in Arabic) |url = http://www.aleppo.us/news/view/47/ar/%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82_%D8%AD%D9%84%D8%A8_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%85%D8%A9.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Al-Halawiyah Madrasa]]'', built in 1124 on the site of Aleppo's 5th century Great Byzantine Cathedral of [[Helena of Constantinople|Saint Helena]], where, according to tradition, a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] temple once stood. [[Helena of Constantinople|Saint Helena]], mother of [[Constantine the Great]], built a great [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] cathedral here. When the [[Crusaders]] were pillaging the surrounding countryside, the city's chief judge converted the cathedral into a mosque. In 1149, [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur al-Din]] converted it into a [[madrasah]]; an Islamic-religious school.&lt;ref name="Arch"&gt;[http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=2693 Halawiyya Mosque and Madrasa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503084347/http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=2693 |date=2012-05-03 }} Archnet Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, the 6th century Byzantine columns of the old cathedral can be seen in the hall.

==Preservation of the ancient city==
As an ancient trading centre, Aleppo's impressive ''[[souq]]s'', ''khans'', ''hammams'', ''madrasas'', mosques and churches are all in need of more care and preservation work. After [[World War II]], the city was significantly redesigned; in 1954 French architect [[André Gutton]] had a number of wide new roads cut through the city to allow easier passage for modern traffic. Between 1954-1983 many buildings in the old city were demolished to allow for the construction of modern apartment blocks, particularly in the northwestern areas (Bab al-Faraj and [[Bab al-Jinan]]). As awareness for the need to preserve this unique cultural heritage increased, Gutton's master plan was finally abandoned in 1979 to be replaced with a new plan presented by the Swiss expert and [[urban designer]] [[Stefano Bianca]], which adopted the idea of "preserving the traditional architectural style of Ancient Aleppo" paving the way for prominent local activists, among them [[Adli Qudsi]], to convince [[UNESCO]] to declare the '''Ancient City of Aleppo''' as a World Heritage Site in 1986.&lt;ref name="Aleppo plan"/&gt;

Several international institutions joined efforts with local authorities and the Aleppo Archaeological Society, to rehabilitate the old city by accommodating contemporary life while preserving the old one. The governorate and the municipality were implementing serious programmes directed towards the enhancement of the ancient city and Jdeydeh quarter.

The German Technical Cooperation ([[GTZ]]) and [[Aga Khan Foundation]] (within the frames of [[Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme]]) had a great contribution in the preservation process of the old city. The local representative of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture from 1999 until 2008 was the architect [[Adli Qudsi]], who played a large role in the protection of the Old City form the destructive forces of urban expansion.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/culture/people/a-true-cityzen-1.25266|title=A true cityzen|last=Writer|first=Suchitra Bajpai Chaudhary, Staff|date=2007-09-13|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animal studies''' is a recently recognized field in which animals are studied in a variety of cross-disciplinary ways. Scholars who engage in animal studies may be formally trained in a number of diverse fields, including [[geography]], [[art history]], [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[film studies]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[psychology]], [[literary studies]], [[museology]], [[philosophy]], communication, and [[sociology]]. They may engage with questions about literal animals, or about notions of "animality" or "brutality," employing various theoretical perspectives, including [[feminism]], [[Marxist theory]], and [[queer theory]]. Using these perspectives, those who engage in animal studies seek to understand both human-animal relations now and in the past, and to understand animals as beings-in-themselves, separate from our knowledge of them. Because the field is still developing, scholars and others have some freedom to define their own criteria about what issues may structure the field.

==History==
As an interdisciplinary subject, animal studies exists at the intersection of a number of different fields of study. Different fields began to turn to animals as an important topic at different times and for various reasons, and these separate disciplinary histories shape how scholars approach animal studies.

In part, animal studies developed out of the [[animal liberation movement]] and was grounded in [[ethics|ethical]] questions about co-existence with other species: whether it is moral to eat animals, to do scientific research on animals for human benefit, and so on. Animal studies scholars who explore the field from an ethical perspective frequently cite [[Australian]] philosopher [[Peter Singer]]'s 1975 work, ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'',&lt;ref name="Gorman"&gt;{{cite web |author=Gorman, James |date=12 January 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/science/animal-studies-move-from-the-lab-to-the-lecture-hall.html?pagewanted=all |title=Animal Studies Move From the Lab to the Lecture Hall |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a founding document in animal studies.  Singer's work followed [[Jeremy Bentham#Animal rights|Jeremy Bentham]]'s by trying to expand [[utilitarian]] questions about pleasure and pain beyond humans to other [[sentience|sentient]] creatures.

Theorists interested in the role of animals in literature, culture, and [[Continental philosophy]] also consider the late work of [[Jacques Derrida]] a driving force behind the rise of interest in animal studies in the humanities.&lt;ref name="Gorman" /&gt;  Derrida's final lecture series, ''The Animal That Therefore I Am'', examined how interactions with animal life affect human attempts to define humanity and the self through language. Taking up Derrida's deconstruction and extending it to other cultural territory, [[Cary Wolfe]] published ''Animal Rites'' in 2003 and critiqued earlier animal rights philosophers such as [[Peter Singer]] and Thomas Regan. Wolfe's study points out an insidious humanism at play in their philosophies and others. Recently also the Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] published a book on the question of the animal: ''The Open. Man and Animal''.

==Research topics and methodologies==
Researchers in animal studies examine the questions and issues that arise when traditional modes of [[Humanities|humanistic]] and [[Science|scientific]] inquiry begin to take animals seriously as subjects of thought and activity.  Students of animal studies may examine how humanity is defined in relation to animals, or how representations of animals create understandings (and misunderstandings) of other species. In order to do so, animal studies pays close attention to the ways that humans [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] animals, and asks how humans might avoid bias in observing other creatures. For instance, [[Donna Haraway]]'s book, ''Primate Visions'', examines how [[diorama]]s created for the [[American Museum of Natural History]] showed family groupings that conformed to the traditional human [[nuclear family]], which misrepresented the animals' observed behavior in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Donna |last=Haraway |authorlink=Donna_Haraway |jstor=466593 |title=Teddy Bear Patriarchy: Taxidermy in the Garden of Eden, New York City, 1908–1936 |journal=Social Text |issue=11 |date=Winter 1984–1985 |pages=20–64 |publisher=Duke University Press |doi = 10.2307/466593}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical approaches in animal studies have also considered representations of non-human animals in popular culture, including species diversity in animated films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans |first=Timothy |last=Laurie |journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human |year=2015 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912960}}, eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.&lt;/ref&gt;

By highlighting these issues, animal studies strives to re-examine traditional [[Ethics|ethical]], [[Politics|political]], and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] categories in the context of a renewed attention to and respect for animal life. The assumption that focusing on animals might clarify human knowledge is neatly expressed in [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s famous dictum that animals are "good to think."&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. ''Totemism''. Boston: Beacon Press, 1963, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bodymind''' is an approach to understand the relationship between the human [[Human body|body]] and [[mind]] in which they are seen as a single integrated unit. It attempts to address the [[mind–body problem]] and is in contrast to the traditions of [[mind–body dualism]] and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]].

In the field of [[alternative medicine]], bodymind implies that:  
* The body, mind, emotions, and spirit are dynamically interrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness|last = Damasio|first = Antonio|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0156010757|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Experience, including physical stress, emotional injury, and pleasures are stored in the body's cells which in turn affects one's reactions to stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Keleman, Stanley: ''Your Body speaks its Mind'', Center Press (US) (1989) {{ISBN|978-0934320016}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The term can be applied across a number of disciplines, including:
* [[Psychoneuroimmunology]], the study of the interaction between psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Michael Irwin| first = Kavita Vedhara | title = Human Psychoneuroimmunology| publisher = Oxford University Press|year=2005| isbn = 978-0-19-856884-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S. (2011) ''Theories of Psychotherapy and Counselling'' p. 600&lt;/ref&gt; which applies basic principles of [[somatic psychology]]. It originated in the work of [[Pierre Janet]], [[Sigmund Freud]] and particularly [[Wilhelm Reich]] who developed it as [[vegetotherapy]].

The academic forebear of the modern field of [[behavioral medicine]] and a part of the practice of [[Liaison psychiatry|consultation-liaison psychiatry]], psychosomatic medicine integrates interdisciplinary evaluation and management involving diverse specialties including [[psychiatry]], [[psychology]], [[neurology]], [[internal medicine]], [[surgery]], [[allergy]], [[dermatology]] and [[psychoneuroimmunology]]. Clinical situations where mental processes act as a major factor affecting medical outcomes are areas where psychosomatic medicine has competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Levenson| first = James L. | title = Essentials of Psychosomatic Medicine| publisher = American Psychiatric Press Inc|year=2006| isbn = 978-1-58562-246-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Postural Integration]], a process-oriented, [[body psychotherapy]] originally developed in the late 1960s by Jack Painter &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ziehl|first1=Silke|title=Jack Painter - Obituary|url=http://www.icpit.info/documents/Jack%20Painter-Obituary.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1933-2010) in California, USA, after exploration in the fields of [[humanistic psychology]] and the [[human potential movement]]. &lt;ref&gt;Erken, Rita and Schlage, Bernhard: Editors: ''Transformation of '''the Self''' with Bodymind Integration'' &lt;br&gt;Postural Integration – Energetic Integration – Psychotherapeutic Postural Integration; &lt;br&gt;Articles by 14 international authors; Hubert W. Holzinger Verlag, Berlin (2012)  {{ISBN|978-3-926396-67-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method aims to support [[Self-efficacy|personal change]] and [[Personal Development|self development]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icpit.info/articles/J_Painter_PosturalIntegration1985_.pdf Painter, Jack: ''Postural Integration, Transformation of the Whole Self'' (1985)]&lt;/ref&gt; through a particular form of [[Manual therapy|manipulative]] [[Holistic health|holistic]] [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]].&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Jack: ''Technical Manual of Deep Wholistic Bodywork'', Postural Integration; published by &lt;br&gt;The International Centre for Release and Integration, Mill Valley, Calif. USA (1984) (2nd edit. 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term overlaps in significant ways, especially in its anti-dualist intention, with the philosophical term mindbody developed independently by philosopher [[William H. Poteat]].

'''Byzantine glass''' objects highly resembled their [[Roman glass|earlier Roman counterparts]] during the fourth and early fifth centuries CE in both form and function. Over the course of the fifth century CE, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] glass blowers, based mostly in the area of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], developed a distinct Byzantine style. While glass vessels continued to serve as the primary vehicles for pouring and drinking liquid, glassware for lighting, currency and commodity weights, window panes, and glass [[tesserae]] for [[Byzantine mosaics|mosaics]] and enamels also surged in popularity. Following the [[Arab conquests]] of the seventh century CE, large quantities of glass were imported from the Levant, which continued to produce raw and manufactured glass.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Marylin, "Islamic Glass: A Brief History," The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, New Series Vol.44 No.2 (Autumn 1986), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars once believed that glassware was an expensive luxury good reserved for the upper strata of society, however, recent archaeological excavations have unearthed a considerable quantity of unadorned glassware intended for lower-class residents.&lt;ref&gt;Lightfoot, Christopher, "Glass Finds at Amorium," Dumbarton Oaks Papers, Vol.59 (2005), 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Chemical analyses of Byzantine glassware have demonstrated that Byzantine glass was composed of the same basic materials as Roman glass—combining sand-derived silica, a fluxing agent, and lime, as well as various coloring agents.

Roman and Byzantine glass-making was divided into two phases. The first, called "primary glass-making" involved the conversion of sand and stabilizer into raw glass. Separate workshops would then re-heat the glass and shape it into an object, in a phase referred to as "secondary glass-making". Although there is considerable archaeological evidence establishing primary glass-making sites, secondary glass-making sites remain difficult to pinpoint.

The largest number of glass production sites from the Early Byzantine period have been unearthed in Syria and Palestine, as well as Egypt. Glass factories have also been discovered in Greece ([[Corinth]], [[Thessoloniki]]) and Asia Minor.&lt;ref&gt;Antonaras, Anastassios, "The Production and Uses of Glass in Byzantine Thessaloniki," in New Light on Old Glass, ed. by Christopher Entwistle and Liz James, (London: The British Museum, 2013), 189-198.&lt;/ref&gt;  A chemical analysis of sixth-century Byzantine glass weights demonstrated that glass was also manufactured in [[Carthage]] and along the [[Danube River]].&lt;ref&gt;Schibille, Nadine, Meek, Andrew, Benguez, Tobias, Entwistle, Chris, Avisseau-Broustet Mathilde, Da Mota, Henrique, Gratuze, Bernard, "Comprehensive Chemical Characterization of Byzantine Glass Weights," PLoS One Vol.11, no.12 (Dec.2016). e0168289.&lt;/ref&gt;  Literary sources refer to glass-making sites in [[Constantinople]], Emesa ([[Homs, Syria]]), and various Egyptian towns.

==Labor==
Though some towns were home to glass-maker [[guild]]s, most Byzantine glass-makers were independent entrepreneurs.  Glass-workers could be either male or female. An extant glass-making contract from [[Armenia]] mentions a woman glass manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, E. Marianne,  "Glass Producers in Late Antique and Byzantine Papyri,"  in New Light on Old Glass, ed. by Christopher Entwistle and Liz James, (London: The British Museum, 2013), 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glass-making styles and techniques by object==
Glass vessel shapes in the Byzantine period did not deviate greatly from those of the high Roman period. Beginning in the late fifth century, glassblowers in the near east produced increasingly larger vessels.  They also introduced the folded, stemmed foot.  In the sixth and seventh centuries Byzantine glass vessels typically features a delicate u-shaped mouth.  A number of "classical" Roman glassware shapes were phased out by the fifth century including: bowls, flat- bottomed cups and beakers, and footed wine jugs featuring trefoil mouths.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, E. Marianne,  Roman Byzantine, and Early Medieval Glass 10 BCE-700 CE : Ernesto Wolf Collection, (Ostfildern-Ruit: Haje Cantz,2001), 261-263.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A major innovation of the Byzantine period was the invention of the glass lamp. Glass lamps are first attested in the first half of the fourth century CE in Palestine, where they began to replace the clay lamps in use at the time as they were much more efficient.  By the middle of the fifth century their use was rapidly spreading westward. Initially these lamps were shaped just like drinking vessels, though the number of shapes expanded to seventeen over the course of the sixth and seventh centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, E. Marianne,  Roman Byzantine, and Early Medieval Glass 10 BCE-700 CE : Ernesto Wolf Collection, (Ostfildern-Ruit: Haje Cantz,2001), 262.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the "[[Triumph of Orthodoxy]]" in 843 CE, [[Byzantine enamel|enamel]] relief icons became the predominant form of iconography in Byzantium.&lt;ref&gt;Pentcheva, Bissera V. "The Performative Icon, " The Art Bulletin, vol.88 no.4 (Dec.2006), 631-632.&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known example is the Michael the Archangel enamel from the treasury of [[St. Mark's Basilica]] in [[Venice]].

==Silver staining==
[[File:Byzantine Glass and Silver-Stain Bracelet.jpg|thumb|Byzantine glass silver-stained bracelet, dated 1100–1400, on display at the [http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/468722 Metropolitan Museum of Art]. Similar bracelets have been found throughout the Byzantine empire.&lt;ref&gt;Pilosi, Lisa, Whitehouse, David, "Early Islamic and Byzantine Silver Stain," in New Light on Old Glass, ed. by Christopher Entwistle and Liz James, (London: The British Museum, 2013), 334.&lt;/ref&gt;  ]]
In the middle Byzantine period, Byzantine glass-makers adopted [[silver-staining]] techniques from the Arab world. Silver-stained glass is created by applying a metallic compound, mixed with a "carrier" of clay or ochre to the surface of the glass object, then the glass is fired below the softening point of the glass. This process results in the breakdown of the smeared compound and its transition into the body of the glass object, creating a "stained" effect. Depending on the makeup of the compound and the "carrier" this process can lead to a wide array of colors. While the Arabs began creating silver-stained glass objects in the late eighth century in Egypt, the first Byzantine silver-stained object has been dated to the ninth century. The most common items featuring Byzantine silver-stain are simple glass bracelets, dating from the tenth to thirteenth centuries, and being discovered across the Byzantine world, from Greece to Anatolia. The most famous example of Byzantine silver-staining is the interior inscription of the beautiful San Marco bowl, dated to the "[[Macedonian Renaissance]]" of the tenth century. Several fragments of silver-stained window glass have been discovered. Although silver staining was practiced by the Byzantines, silver-stained works were not as ubiquitous in Byzantium as they were to become in late Medieval Europe. However, the widespread use of silver-staining in Byzantium could in part explain the transmission of silver-stain technique from the Arab world to Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Pilosi, Lisa, Whitehouse, David, "Early Islamic and Byzantine Silver Stain," in New Light on Old Glass, ed. by Christopher Entwistle and Liz James, (London: The British Museum, 2013), 329-337.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cacicazgo''''' is a phonetic Spanish transliteration (or a derivative) of the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] word for the lands ruled by a ''[[cacique]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.elhabanero.cubaweb.cu/servicios/espa_106.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008171649/http://www.elhabanero.cubaweb.cu/servicios/espa_106.html# |archive-date=2006-10-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Spanish colonial system recognized indigenous elites as nobles in Mexico and Peru, and other areas. Nobles could entail their estates, which were called ''cacicazgos'' on the model of Spanish entailed estates, or ''mayorazgos''.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández de Recas, Guillermo S., ''Cacicazgos y nobiliario indígena de la Nueva España''. México : 351 pp. Serie:   Instituto Bibliográfico Mexicano. Publicación 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;  This term is found in contexts such as "''la princesa de Cofachiqui, señora de un cacigazgo indígena''"[https://web.archive.org/web/20060901175002/http://www.editoraperu.com.pe/identidades/90/ensayo.asp] or, for example: "In November of 1493, the island of Boriquén had approximately 20 cacigazgos."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saxakali.com/caribbean/rosado.htm&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Spain|Spanish]] chronicles, the ''cacique'' was at the apex of the Taíno [[feudal]] structure. [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] refers to these ''cacigazgos'' as kingdoms.

Many individual ''cacicazgos'' have been studied in [[New Spain|colonial Mexico]], showing that entailment was a successful means to preserve noble indigenous resources as the situation for commoners declined.  There are cases where Spaniards married into ''cacique'' families, thereby giving them access to indgienous resources.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, S.L. "A cacicazgo in the Seventeenth-Century: The Case of Xochimilco," in ''Land and Politics in Mexico'', H.R. Harvey, University of New Mexico Press, pp. 265-274.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Archivo General de la Nación, Mexico, a whole section of records, called ''Vínculos'', is devoted to individual noble entailments.  A collection of them was published in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández de Recas, Guillermo S., ''Cacicazgos y nobiliario indígena de la Nueva España''. México : 351 pp. Serie:   Instituto Bibliográfico Mexicano. Publicación 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Cacicazgos survived into the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, John, Arthur Joyce, and Ronald Spores. "Transformations of the indigenous cacicazgo in the nineteenth century." ''Ethnohistory'' 50, no. 1 (2003): 131-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts over inheritance were common, and the litigants' arguments found in these cases form the basis for understanding some of the dynamics of the institution.&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, Gilda Cubillo. (2012). "Sucesión, herencia y conflicto en el linaje Istolinque, caciques de la nobleza indígena colonial de Coyoacán." Primera parte. ''Diario de Campo'', (8), 8-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, Gilda Cubillo. "Sucesión, herencia y conflicto en el linaje Istolinque, caciques de la nobleza indígena colonial de Coyoacán. Segunda parte." Diario de Campo 9 (2012): 4-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the concept of ''cacique'' shifted, with some women attaining the title of ''cacica''. ''Cacicazgo'' likewise underwent some transformation during the colonial era in Mexico. "By law, a cacique was a single heir and possessor of a cacicazgo estate, which always included land and often a subject labor force to work it. The Indians themselves, however, saw things differently, and by late colonial times it was not unusual for all the sons and daughters of a cacique (or cacica) to adopt the title. How and why this change took place, its chronology, and what it meant for local community organization remain imperfectly understood...The late colonial setting was vastly different, and indigenous noble claims of the period must be understood in the context in which they arose."&lt;ref&gt;Chance, John. "The "Caciques of Tecali: Class and Ethnic Identity in Late Colonial Mexico." ''[[Hispanic American Historical Review]]'' 76(3):478.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Certificate in Legal Practice''' ('''CLP''') is a 9-month long post-graduate course and examination taken by foreign [[Bachelor of Laws|law]] graduates and graduates of Bachelor of Jurisprudence (Hons)/B.Juris (Hons) from [[University of Malaya]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.um.edu.my/mainpage.php?module=Maklumat&amp;kategori=82&amp;id=545&amp;papar=1&lt;/ref&gt; and Bachelor of Legal Studies (Hons)/BLS (Hons) from [[Universiti Teknologi MARA]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.uitm.edu.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=74:lw213-b-hons-of-legal-studies&amp;catid=50:degree&amp;Itemid=63 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005200937/http://www.law.uitm.edu.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=74%3Alw213-b-hons-of-legal-studies&amp;catid=50%3Adegree&amp;Itemid=63 |date=5 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to become a qualified [[lawyer]] in [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/c.l.p.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lpqb.org.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=132&amp;Itemid=77&lt;/ref&gt;

The examination is conducted by the Legal Profession Qualifying Board of Malaysia and is governed by the Legal Profession Act 1976. The Board allows degree holders from shortlisted universities in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] to sit for the examination.&lt;ref&gt;"A Guideline and the Application Form to sit for the Examination for the Certificate of Legal Practice", ''Legal Profession Qualifying Board, Malaysia''&lt;/ref&gt; The Board also allows graduates from a shortlisted universities to be exempted from the this examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lpqb.org.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=61|title=About Us|last=Administrator|website=www.lpqb.org.my|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;Multimedia University in Melaka is the 1st private university in Malaysia obtaining exemption of CLP exam for its law graduates.

Like all law graduates, CLP graduates must proceed to read in chambers of a pupil master who has been in active practice in Malaysia for a total period of not less than 7 years. After completing nine (9) months of pupillage, the student may finally be [[call to the bar|called]] to the [[Malaysian Bar|bar]] and become a qualified lawyer.

==History==
The Certificate in Legal Practice was originally designed in 1984 only as a temporary stop-gap measure to assist those Malaysians who were not able to sit for the English Bar Finals Examinations.&lt;ref&gt;http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/2/6/focus/8011437&amp;sec=focus{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then a solution to those who can't apply to be a Barrister but ended up as another recognised legal qualification to be an advocate and solicitor in Malaysia.

==The Examination==
Examinations are normally held around July each year.  Every student is required to sit for five subject papers, namely, General Paper, Professional Practice, Evidence, Criminal Procedure, and Civil Procedure. The student must pass all papers to obtain the certificate. If a student fails one paper he or she may be given a conditional pass and be allowed to resit that subject two more times. However, if a student failed in two or more papers, he must sit for the whole examination again to obtain the certificate. Each student is allowed to sit for the examination four times.

The Legal Profession Qualifying Board only sets the examination and does not provide classes to prepare the candidate for the examination. Classes were initially conducted by the Faculty of Law, [[University of Malaya]] and later [[UiTM Malaysia Law School|Faculty of Law, Universiti Teknologi MARA]] but the task was subsequently delegated to private colleges only. Three of the major institutions that offer tuition for the CLP in Kuala Lumpur are Brickfields Asia College [http://www.bac.edu.my/], Advance Tertiary College (formerly Kemayan ATC), and HELP University. ATC also offers the course in its Penang Campus.

==Criticism and Controversies==
The examination is extremely rigorous in that it has a very low passing rate of between 10% to 20% each year. This is due to the extremely high standard imposed by the CLP Board to ensure that only the best candidates go on to qualify and practice as lawyers.

The CLP board has pointed out, among other things, in an article published in The Star on 24 September 2008 as well as in its CLP Subject Guide 2008 issued to candidates, that “The examination is not a test of memory function by the candidates. It is the mediocre candidates who resort to regurgitation of information memorized by them”, thereby leading to the low pass rates annually.&lt;ref&gt;http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/9/24/nation/2086475&amp;sec=nation{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Professional Practice paper, for example, covers of Land Law, Probate and Administration of Estates, Bankruptcy and Winding Up, Ethics of the Legal Profession, and Advocacy. Any person familiar with legal education would understand that Land Law is among the bulkiest subject.

Students were denied access to the many relevant Statutes (Acts of Parliaments) during the exams, such as the Bankruptcy Act 1967, Companies Act 1965, Winding Up Rules 1997, Probate and Administration Act 1959, Legal Profession Act 1976, Legal Profession (Practice &amp; Etiquette) Rules 1978, Legal Profession (Publicity) Rules, and many more.

In 2007, the then CLP Director, Khalid Yusoff, was jailed three months for forgery and cheating in the July 2001 CLP examination “master list”.&lt;ref&gt;http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/8/1/nation/18461427&amp;sec=nation{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, he was freed by the Court of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/5/28/courts/6353135&amp;sec=courts{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Charles I Insulted by Cromwell's Soldiers''''' is an [[oil painting]] by the French artist [[Hippolyte Delaroche]], depicting [[Charles I of England]] taunted by the victorious soldiers of [[Oliver Cromwell]] after the [[Second English Civil War]], prior to his execution in 1649. Completed in 1836, it is thought to be one of Delaroche's greatest masterpieces. It was displayed as part of the [[Orleans Collection#Bridgewater collection|Bridgewater Collection]] in London, although it was latterly thought to have been lost when, during [[The Blitz]] of 1941, a German bomb struck close to [[Bridgewater House, Westminster|Bridgewater House]], causing shrapnel damage to the canvas in the ensuing explosion. In 2009 it was rediscovered in Scotland in an unexpectedly good condition, having been rolled up and stored after the war, but recorded in the intervening years as badly damaged or destroyed. After a partial restoration it went on display in the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] in London, in an exhibition re-appraising Delaroche's work. After the exhibition, it is to be fully restored.

==Subject==
[[File:DelarocheCromwell.jpg|thumb|right|In ''Cromwell and Charles I'' painted in 1831, Delaroche also depicts Charles I, with Cromwell standing over his dead body]]
''Charles I Insulted'' features Charles I, the King of England, who had by 1648 lost the Second English Civil War fought against Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army, after the [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Battle of Preston]]. By January 1649, he was being put on trial for treason, and on 30 January, he was [[Decapitation|beheaded]].

The painting depicts Charles in the days before his execution, being bullied and taunted by Cromwell's defiant troops, one of whom is blowing [[Pipe smoking|pipe smoke]] in his face.&lt;ref name=BBC24Nov2009ReturningAfter70Years/&gt;&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt; The deposed king remains calm, holding a book which he appears to have been reading.

==Ownership==
[[Hippolyte Delaroche|Delaroche]]'s ''Charles I Insulted'' was commissioned by [[Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere]],&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt; who was known as Lord Francis Leveson-Gower until 1833 when, following the death of his father, he was created the first [[Earl of Ellesmere]], inheriting [[Bridgewater House, Westminster|Bridgewater House]] in London from his bachelor great uncle, [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph22Sep2000SutherlandObituary/&gt; The family line of the Earls of Ellesmere became the Dukes of Sutherland when, in 1963, [[John Egerton, 6th Duke of Sutherland|John Egerton, 5th Earl of Ellesmere]], succeeded to the title of duke of Sutherland on the death of the 5th Duke of Sutherland with no male heir in the elder line.&lt;ref name=Telegraph22Sep2000SutherlandObituary/&gt; As of its rediscovery in 2009, the painting remained privately owned by the present Duke, [[Francis Egerton, 7th Duke of Sutherland]].&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt; The 7th Duke was the 6th Duke's cousin and heir to the Dukedom, since the 6th Duke had no children himself.&lt;ref name=Telegraph22Sep2000SutherlandObituary/&gt;

==History==

===1836 to 2009===
''Charles I Insulted'' is a large piece, painted on a canvas measuring {{convert|13|ft|m}} by {{convert|10|ft|m}}.,&lt;ref name=Mail26Nov2009Found/&gt; also described as being nearly three metres square.&lt;ref name=Guardian23Feb2010Strike/&gt; It was completed in 1836.&lt;ref name=BBC24Nov2009ReturningAfter70Years/&gt; It was first displayed at the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] of 1837,&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt; and in 1838 at the [[British Institution]] in London. The painting was then hung for decades as part of the semi-public [[Orleans Collection#Bridgewater collection|Bridgewater Collection]] in Bridgewater House in London.&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt;

The painting suffered serious damage during a Second World War German bombing raid on London. Unlike other collections, the Bridgewater artworks had not been stored underground before the war, due to the 5th Earl having been captured at [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]] in 1940.&lt;ref name=Mail26Nov2009Found/&gt; On 11 May 1941, during the last night and most deadly raid of what became known as [[The Blitz]], one bomb landed on the street outside Bridgewater House, leaving a {{convert|3|m|ft}} deep [[bomb crater]]. Hanging in the dining room at the time, the painting suffered extensive [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] damage.&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt; At least four paintings in the collection were totally destroyed in the raid, while others less damaged were eventually restored.&lt;ref name=Mail26Nov2009Found/&gt; ''Charles I Insulted'' was demounted, and rolled up, having been given a rudimentary repair using paper to hold together the largest tears.&lt;ref name=Mail26Nov2009Found/&gt; After the war, it was transported to [[Mertoun House]] in [[St. Boswells]], [[Scottish Borders]], the family's Scottish home, for storage.&lt;ref name=BBC24Nov2009ReturningAfter70Years/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph22Sep2000SutherlandObituary/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mail26Nov2009Found/&gt;

While stored safe and dry in Mertoun, over the next 68 years the existence of the painting was gradually forgotten about by its owners, and presumed by the art world to be lost as irreparably damaged in the raid.&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt; In subsequent catalogues of Delaroche's work, it had been listed as either 'badly damaged' or sometimes 'destroyed'.&lt;ref name=Mail26Nov2009Found/&gt;

===2009 onwards===
The painting was rediscovered in the summer of 2009 by National Gallery curators, after they made enquiries about the painting as they prepared a Delaroche exhibition.&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mail26Nov2009Found/&gt; The 2010 exhibition was to be the first major show on Delaroche to be held in Britain, aiming to re-assess the works of Delaroche, who fell out of fashion during the early 20th century, and featuring his most famous work from the National Gallery collection, ''[[The Execution of Lady Jane Grey]]'' (1833), which was also a rediscovered work: it had been thought lost when the Tate Gallery was [[1928 Thames flood|flooded in 1928]], and found rolled up in 1973.&lt;ref name=BBC24Nov2009ReturningAfter70Years/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt;

On 7 June 2009 at Mertoun, it was unrolled for the first time since being moved to Scotland.&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt; To the surprise of those present, the painting was largely intact, having "lost none of its intensity".&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt; The explosion damage consisted of around 200 individual tears in the canvas, which still contained plaster fragments and dust from the blast.&lt;ref name=BBC24Nov2009ReturningAfter70Years/&gt;&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Times13Feb2010StarPariah/&gt;

After moving the painting to London, it was restored sufficiently to be able to be displayed in the exhibition, albeit with the shrapnel scars still visible, and "somewhat yellowed by a layer of discoloured varnish".&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt;&lt;ref name=Times13Feb2010StarPariah/&gt; Because the canvas had been rolled up for nearly 70 years, it had to be weighed down flat for six weeks.&lt;ref name=Guardian23Feb2010Strike/&gt; The tears were then stitched together, and the canvas lined.&lt;ref name=Guardian23Feb2010Strike/&gt;

The painting's first ever public display since rediscovery was as part of the exhibition ''Painting History: Delaroche and Lady Jane Grey'', running from 24 February to 24 May 2010.&lt;ref name=BBC24Nov2009ReturningAfter70Years/&gt;&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt; It went on display on 23 February in a separate room in the museum's free admission area, with the main part of the exhibition held in the adjacent [[Sainsbury Wing]] of the gallery.&lt;ref name=Reuters23Feb2010WorkOnShow/&gt; The painting is to be fully restored after the London exhibition whereupon work would start to remove the discoloured varnish and retouch the damaged areas.&lt;ref name=Guardian23Feb2010Strike/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters23Feb2010WorkOnShow/&gt;

==Reception==
According to the London National Gallery, it is "one of the great paintings on themes of English history for which Delaroche had become renowned", in which Delaroche was "able to imply striking parallels between the poignant fate of Charles and the recent course of French history".&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt; According to the gallery director [[Nicholas Penny]], the rediscovery was "huge" and its redisplay would be an historic moment, describing it as "an extraordinarily powerful work", "one of the great French paintings" and by "one of the greatest painters" of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt; According to Penny, Delaroche, a Frenchman, was a notable painter of [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] and [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] history, as a method of "exploring the violence and vicissitudes of the [[French Revolution]]" without actually portraying the events themselves, which were regarded as too recent to paint.&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt;

According to the National Gallery's exhibition curator Christopher Riopelle, both ''Charles I Insulted'' and Delaroche's other painting, ''[[Marie-Antoinette]] Before the Tribunal'', painted fifteen years later in 1851, "suggest episodes of the [[suffering of Christ]]".&lt;ref name=Reuters23Feb2010WorkOnShow/&gt; Riopelle added that Delaroche's "obsession with English royalist history" was "classic displacement of what you want to talk about but can't, because it's still so raw and recent", particularly referring to [[Execution of Louis XVI|the execution]] of [[Louis XVI of France]] in January 1793, and nine months later of his Queen [[Marie Antoinette]].&lt;ref name=Guardian23Feb2010Strike/&gt;

[[Charlotte Higgins]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described it as "one of Delaroche's masterpieces", which "owes a debt" to [[Anthony van Dyck]]'s famous painting of Charles I.&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt; Higgins also said that it "clearly references the popular artistic subject of the [[mocking of Christ]] by his guards".&lt;ref name=Guardian23Feb2010Strike/&gt; According to Arifa Akbar of ''[[The Independent]]'', "Delaroche's monumental painting featuring Charles I as a Christ-like figure" is regarded as "one of Delaroche's most powerful pieces", commissioned at the "height of his fame".&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;

[[David Horspool]] of ''[[The Times]]'', reflecting on the fate of Delaroche's ''Execution of Lady Jane Grey'' which was relegated to a basement, in which it was later flood damaged, due to Delaroche's falling fame, said "there seems no chance that [''Charles I Insulted''] will be rolled up and put away. Delaroche's days as the forgotten master seem to be over", predicting the rediscovered piece would be perhaps "the most exciting exhibit to go on display" in the 2010 National Gallery exhibition.&lt;ref name=Times13Feb2010StarPariah/&gt;

==Purposes==
Computer-assisted legal research is undertaken by a variety of actors. It is taught as a topic on many [[law degree]]s&lt;ref&gt;James Holland and Jullian Webb, ''Learning Legal Rules'' (7th edn., Oxford University Press, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; and is used extensively by undergraduate and postgraduate law students in meeting the work requirements of their degree courses. Professors of Law rely on the digitisation of primary and secondary sources of law when conducting their research and writing the material that they submit for publication. Professional lawyers rely on computer-assisted legal research in order to properly understand the status of the law and so to act effectively in the best interest of their client. They may also consult the text of case judgements and statutes specifically, as well as wider academic comment, in order to form the basis of (or response to) an appeal.

The availability of legal information online differs by type, jurisdiction and subject matter. The types of information available include:&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. http://legalresearch.westlaw.co.uk/; http://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/en-uk/home.page; http://www.legislation.gov.uk; https://www.jstor.org&lt;/ref&gt;

# Texts of statutes, statutory instruments, civil codes, etc.
# Explanatory notes and government publications relating to statutes and their operation
# Texts of governing documents such as constitutions and treaties
# Case judgements
# Journals on legal matters or legal theory
# Dictionaries and legal encyclopaediæ
# Legal texts and materials in the form of e-books
# Current affairs and market information
# Educational information on the law and its operation

==Before the Internet==

Prior to the advent and popularisation of the World Wide Web, access to digital legal information was largely through the use of CD-ROMs, designed and sold by commercial organisations.&lt;ref name="India 2015"&gt;The "free access to law movement" in India: supporting legal education, research and practice Priya Rai and Akash Singh (2015) Legal Information Management 178&lt;/ref&gt; Dial-up services were also available from the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Archived February 28, 2008, at the Wayback Machine&lt;/ref&gt; As the use of the Internet spread in the early 1990s, companies such as LexisNexis and Westlaw incorporated Internet connectivity into their software packages. Browser-based legal information started to be published by Legal Information Institutes from 1992.&lt;ref name="law.cornell.edu"&gt;LII/Legal Information Institute, Cornell University https://www.law.cornell.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publicly available information==
The first effort to provide free computer access to legal information was made by two academics, Peter Martin and Tom Bruce, in 1992.&lt;ref name="law.cornell.edu"/&gt; Today, the [[Legal Information Institute]] freely publishes such resources as the text of the [[United States Constitution]], judgements of the [[United States Supreme Court]], and the text of the [[United States Code]].

The [[Australian Legal Information Institute]] (AusLII) was established soon after in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;"Electronic Law Journals – JILT 1997 (2) – AustLII's roles". University of Warwick.

'''Corn Man''' was a character invented by [[Al Gore]]'s campaign during the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2000|2000 Democratic Primaries]] to draw attention to the refusal of the opposing candidate, [[Bill Bradley]], to take part in a series of debates on farm policy.

[[File:Doggerland.svg|thumb|right|250px|Map showing hypothetical extent of Doggerland (c.&amp;nbsp;10,000&amp;nbsp;BC), which provided a land bridge between Great Britain and continental Europe]]

'''Doggerland''' was an area of land, now submerged beneath the southern [[North Sea]], that connected [[Great Britain]] to [[continental Europe]]. It was flooded by rising sea levels around 6,500–6,200 BC. Geological surveys have suggested that it stretched from Britain's east coast to the [[Netherlands]] and the western coasts of Germany and the peninsula of [[Jutland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/archaeology/research/projects/title,89282,en.html "The Doggerland Project", University of Exeter Department of Archaeology]&lt;/ref&gt; It was probably a rich habitat with human habitation in the [[Mesolithic]] period,&lt;ref name="usask"&gt;[http://geochemistry.usask.ca/bill/courses/Climate/Coastal%20catastrophe%20prt.pdf Patterson, W, "Coastal Catastrophe" (paleoclimate research document), University of Saskatchewan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409025923/http://geochemistry.usask.ca/bill/courses/Climate/Coastal%20catastrophe%20prt.pdf |date=9 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although rising sea levels gradually reduced it to low-lying islands before its final submergence, possibly following a [[tsunami]] caused by the [[Storegga Slide]].&lt;ref name= bbc010514/&gt;

The [[archaeology|archaeological]] potential of the area was first identified in the early 20th century, and interest intensified in 1931 when a [[commercial trawler|fishing trawler]] operating east of [[the Wash]] dragged up a barbed antler point that was subsequently dated to a time when the area was [[tundra]]. Vessels have dragged up remains of [[mammoth]], [[lion]] and other animals, as well as a few prehistoric tools and weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.zmescience.com/science/geology/doggerland-europe-land/|title = Doggerland – the land that connected Europe and the UK 8000 years ago|date = February 5, 2015|accessdate = February 18, 2015|website = ZME Science|publisher = |last = Mihai|first = Andrei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doggerland was named in the 1990s, after the [[Dogger Bank]], which in turn was named after the 17th century Dutch fishing boats called ''[[Dogger (boat)|doggers]]''.

==Formation==
[[File:Doggerland3er_en.png|thumb|300px|left|Map showing hypothetical extent of Doggerland from [[Weichselian glaciation]] until the current situation]]
Until the middle [[Pleistocene]], Britain was a peninsula of Europe, connected by the massive chalk [[Weald–Artois Anticline]] across the [[Straits of Dover]]. During the [[Anglian glaciation]], approximately 450,000 years ago, an ice sheet filled much of the [[North Sea]], with a large [[proglacial lake]] in the southern part fed by the [[Rhine]], [[Scheldt]] and [[Thames]] river systems. The catastrophic overflow of this lake carved a channel through the anticline, leading to the formation of the [[Channel River]], which carried the combined Scheldt and Thames to the Atlantic. This probably created the potential for Britain to become isolated from the continent during periods of high sea level, although some scientists argue that the final break did not occur until a second ice-dammed lake overflowed during the [[Marine isotope stage|MIS]]8 or MIS6 glaciations, around 340,000 or 240,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The British Palaeolithic: Human Societies at the Edge of the Pleistocene World|first1=Paul|last1=Pettitt|first2=Mark|last2=White|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|pages=98–102, 277|location=Abingdon, UK|isbn=978-0-415-67455-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the most recent glaciation of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], which ended around 18,000 years ago, the North Sea and much of the British Isles were covered with glacial ice and the sea level was about {{convert|120|m|ft|abbr=on}} lower. The climate later became warmer and during the [[Late Glacial Maximum]] around 12,000 BC Britain, as well as much of the North Sea and English Channel, was an expanse of low-lying [[tundra]].&lt;ref name=sussex&gt;[http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/teaching/C1119/mhe08%20lecture%206.pdf University of Sussex, School of Life Sciences] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609214154/http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/teaching/C1119/mhe08%20lecture%206.pdf |date=9 June 2011 }}, C1119 Modern human evolution, Lecture 6, slide 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence, including the contours of the present seabed, indicates that after the first main Ice Age, the [[Water divide|watershed]] between the North Sea and [[English Channel]] extended east from East Anglia then south-east to the [[Hook of Holland]], rather than across the Strait of Dover. The [[Seine]], [[Thames]], [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]], [[Scheldt]] and [[Rhine]] rivers joined and flowed west along the English Channel as a wide slow river before eventually reaching the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name="usask"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sussex/&gt; At about 10,000&amp;nbsp;BC the north-facing coastal area of Doggerland had a coastline of [[lagoon]]s, [[saltmarsh]]es, [[mudflat]]s and beaches as well as inland streams, rivers, [[marsh]]es and lakes. It may have been the richest hunting, fowling and fishing ground in Europe in the [[Mesolithic]] period.&lt;ref name="usask"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gaffney&gt;[http://livebettermagazine.com/article/global-warming-and-lost-lands-understanding-the-effects-of-sea-level-rise/ Vincent Gaffney, "Global Warming and Lost Lands: Understanding the Effects of Sea Level Rise"]&lt;/ref&gt;

One big river system found by 3D seismic survey, undertaken by the Birmingham "North Sea Palaeolandscapes Project," was the "Shotton River", which drained the south-east part of the [[Dogger Bank]] hill area into the east end of the [[Outer Silver Pit]] lake. It is named after Birmingham geologist [[Frederick William Shotton]].

As ice melted at the end of [[Weichselian Ice Age|the last glacial period of the current ice age]], sea levels rose and the land began to tilt in an [[post-glacial rebound|isostatic adjustment]] as the huge weight of ice lessened. Doggerland eventually became submerged, cutting off what was previously the British peninsula from the European mainland by around 6500&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=sussex/&gt;&lt;ref name="humanpast"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scarre|first1=Chris|title=The Human Past: World Prehistory &amp; the Development of Human Societies|date=2005|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-28531-2|pages=180|ref=human past}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dogger Bank, an upland area of Doggerland, remained an island until at least 5000&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=sussex/&gt;&lt;ref name=humanpast/&gt; Key stages are now believed to have included the gradual evolution of a large tidal bay between eastern England and Dogger Bank by 9000&amp;nbsp;BC and a rapid sea-level rise thereafter, leading to Dogger Bank becoming an island and Great Britain becoming physically disconnected from the continent.&lt;ref name=weninger&gt;[http://www.personal.soton.ac.uk/ejr/Rohling-papers/2008-Weninger%20et%20al%20Documenta%20Praehistorica.pdf Bernhard Weninger et al., The catastrophic final flooding of Doggerland by the Storegga Slide tsunami, Documenta Praehistorica XXXV, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent hypothesis postulates that much of the remaining coastal land was flooded by a [[megatsunami]] around 6200 BC, caused by a submarine landslide off the coast of [[Norway]] known as the [[Storegga Slide]]. This suggests: "that the Storegga Slide tsunami would have had a catastrophic impact on the contemporary coastal Mesolithic population.... Britain finally became separated from the continent and in cultural terms, the Mesolithic there goes its own way."&lt;ref name=weninger/&gt; A study published in 2014 suggested that the only remaining parts of Doggerland at the time of the Storegga Slide were low-lying islands, but supported the view that the area had been abandoned at about the same time as the tsunamis.&lt;ref name= bbc010514&gt;{{cite web |last= Rincon |first= Paul |title= Prehistoric North Sea 'Atlantis' hit by 5m tsunami |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-27224243 |publisher= BBC News|date= 1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view speculates that the Storegga tsunami devastated Doggerland but then ebbed back into the sea, and that later [[Lake Agassiz]] (in North America) burst releasing so much fresh water that sea levels over about two years rose to flood much of Doggerland and make Britain an island.&lt;ref&gt;

==Discovery and investigation by archaeologists==
[[File:200805231215 Wollhaarmammut Millie Schädel.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Woolly mammoth]] skull discovered by fishermen in the [[North Sea]], at Celtic and Prehistoric Museum, Ireland]]
The prehistoric existence of what is now known as Doggerland was established in the late 19th century. [[H. G. Wells]] referred to the concept in his short story ''[[A Story of the Stone Age]]'' of 1897, set in "a time when one might have walked dryshod from France (as we call it now) to England, and when a broad and sluggish Thames flowed through its marshes to meet its father Rhine, flowing through a wide and level country that is under water in these latter days, and which we know by the name of the North Sea...Fifty thousand years ago it was, fifty thousand years&amp;nbsp;if the reckoning of geologists is correct", though most of the action seems to occur in what is now [[Surrey]] and [[Kent]], but stretching out to Doggerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/10821/ Online text]&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains of plants brought to the surface from Dogger Bank were studied in 1913 by [[Paleobiology|paleobiologist]] [[Clement Reid]], and the remains of animals and worked flints from the [[Neolithic period]] had also been found.&lt;ref name="Keith"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Keith|first=Arthur |title=The Antiquity of Man |publisher=Anmol Publications Pvt Ltd |date=15 August 2004|pages=41|chapter=3|isbn=81-7041-977-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nCxEDWs8kwgC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=submerged+forest+france#v=onepage&amp;q=submerged%20forest%20france&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''The Antiquity of Man'' of 1915, [[Anatomy|anatomist]] [[Sir Arthur Keith]] discussed the archaeological potential of the area.&lt;ref name="Keith" /&gt; In 1931, the [[Fishing trawler|trawler]] ''Colinda'' hauled up a lump of [[peat]] whilst fishing near the Ower Bank, {{convert|25|mi|order=flip}} east of [[Norfolk]]. The peat was found to contain a barbed antler point, possibly used as a [[harpoon]] or fish spear, {{convert|8.5|in|order=flip}} long, which dated from between 4,000 and 10,000&amp;nbsp;BC when the area was [[tundra]].&lt;ref name="usask"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gaffney/&gt;

Interest was reinvigorated in the 1990s by [[Bryony Coles]], who named the area "Doggerland" ("after the great banks in the southern North Sea")&lt;ref name=gaffney/&gt; and produced speculative maps of the area.&lt;ref name=gaffney/&gt;&lt;ref name=coles&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2023101 B.J.

'''Dora María Téllez''' (born 1955) is a [[Nicaragua]]n historian who is well known for her involvement in the [[Sandinista]] Revolution, which deposed the [[Somoza]] regime in 1979. As a young university medical student in Leon in the 1970s, Téllez was recruited by the [[FSLN]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32396348|title=Sandino's daughters : testimonies of Nicaraguan women in struggle|last=1936-|first=Randall, Margaret,|date=1995|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0813522145|edition=Rev.|location=New Brunswick, NJ|oclc=32396348}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSLN, also referred to as The Sandinista National Liberation Front, was a socialist party in Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50174899|title=The many faces of Sandinista democracy|last=Katherine.|first=Hoyt,|date=1997|publisher=Ohio University Center for International Studies|isbn=0896801977|location=Athens|oclc=50174899}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early work of Téllez within the FSLN was through student movements centered around support work for members active in the mountains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Téllez went on to become a comandante in the popular revolt to oust the Nicaraguan dictator, [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As "Commander Two", at age 22, she was third in command in an [[:es:Operación Chanchera|operation]] on August 22, 1978 that occupied the Nicaraguan National Palace in Managua, where the Nicaraguan National Assembly was in full session.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-11-30|title=Tellez, Dora Maria (1957&amp;ndash;)|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/CX2588823052/GVRL?u=umuser&amp;sid=GVRL&amp;xid=d72738cc|journal=Dictionary of Women Worldwide: 25,000 Women Through the Ages|language=English|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They captured 1,500 civilian hostages and threatened their lives unless their demands were met.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The demands included a prisoner release and a monetary ransom. There was a subsequent release of key [[Sandinista]] political prisoners and a million dollars ransom payment. Téllez played a role in managing these negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Still Fighting|last=Isbester|first=Katherine|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|year=2001|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This event had repercussions for the 50-year-old Somoza dynasty by revealing the potential vulnerability of the Somoza regime. It also helped the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|FSLN]] win support from Latin American governments, unite diverse factions of the opposition to the regime, and prompt them into action.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Following the operation, thousands of youths and women joined the Sandinista movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A popular insurrection grew along with the FSLN and contributed to the fall of the Somoza regime on July 19, 1979.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Military commander during the Nicaraguan Civil War==
Upon her arrival in Panama with the released Sandinistas in August 1978, Téllez trained in Cuba and Panama to become a military commander. In February 1979 she was back fighting in Nicaragua and she went on to establish a place in the Tercerista leadership structure. For five months she led [[Sandinista]] platoons throughout the country in skirmishes with the [[Nicaraguan National Guard]]: first in the Southern Front with [[Edén Pastora]]'s forces, and later in Central and northern Nicaragua. According to [[Sandinista]] Commander Mónica Baltodano, her raids on the northern provinces in conjunction with Cmdr.

Finally, she led the Sandinista units fighting the enemy's elite forces block by block for six consecutive weeks until capturing in June 1979 the city of [[León, Nicaragua|León]], the first major city to fall to the Sandinistas in the Revolution, followed by Managua two weeks later.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This was followed by the Sandinista Provisional Government Junta's installation in this city soon after.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Public service in the Sandinista Movement==
An increase in government repression and rise of political prisoners being taken prompted Téllez to go underground in 1976.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While underground she did educational work in the mountains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She later served as Minister of Health in the first Sandinista administration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The administration's public health campaign that won Nicaragua the UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization's prize for exceptional health progress.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51504445|title=After the Revolution : gender and democracy in El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala|last=A.|first=Luciak, Ilja|date=2001|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=0801876419|location=Baltimore|oclc=51504445}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Téllez has been quoted discussing the specific health inequalities present in the mining industry in Nicaragua.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Within the Sandinistas government, Téllez held positions alongside religious figures to advocate for gay and lesbian rights, as well as reproductive rights for women in Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004570034|title=Status Envy : The Politics of Catholic Higher Education|others=Hendershott, Anne|isbn=1351488163|edition=1st|oclc=1004570034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic life as a historian==
Téllez wrote publications on Nicaraguan history that underscores the importance of the north-central region of the country to the nation's political and economic history. In 2004 she was appointed Robert F. Kennedy Visiting Professor in Latin American studies at the [[Harvard Divinity School]], but was barred from obtaining an entry visa to the [[United States|US]] on grounds that she was a terrorist, citing as evidence the raid on the Nicaraguan National Palace in Managua via the Patriot Act.

==Political career==
Early experience within the FSLN political party included Téllez's position as the Political Secretary for Managua.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Téllez also served as a member of the Council of the State.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28021881|title=Sandino's daughters revisited : feminism in Nicaragua|last=1936-|first=Randall, Margaret,|date=1994|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0813520258|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|oclc=28021881}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first congress of the FSLN had an election in 1990 which prompted discontent regarding the election process however the Directorate decided that the subsequent election of a new body would be done so by slate rather than voting for individual members.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Democracy and Socialism in Sandinista Nicaragua|last=Vanden|first=Harry E.|last2=Prevost|first2=Gary|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=1993|location=Boulder, CO|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stunted the potential political candidacy of Téllez, which was being pushed by many rank-and-file members.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Téllez would have  been the Directorate's first female member.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1995 Téllez founded the [[Sandinista Renovation Movement]] (MRS) after resigning her seat in the [[FSLN]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other former [[Sandinistas]] such as [[Ernesto Cardenal]] and [[Sergio Ramírez]] have joined the MRS political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70763707|title=The Undermining of the Sandinista Revolution|date=1999|publisher=Macmillan|others=Prevost, Gary., Vanden, Harry E.|isbn=1349275115|location=Basingstoke|oclc=70763707}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MRS political party opposed the current corruption in the Nicaraguan government and appointed Herty Lewites to run as the party's candidate in the 2006 presidential election against Daniel Ortega.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/858357241|title=From Nicaragua Principles for Life and Mission.|date=2013|publisher=West Bow Pr|others=Cox, Bill.|isbn=149080482X|oclc=858357241}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four months before the election was to be held, Lewites died of natural causes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Daniel Ortega, whom was president from 1985 to 1990, won the presidential election and regained political power in Nicaragua.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

On June 4, 2008, Téllez began a hunger strike to protest the "dictatorship of Daniel Ortega", her former comrade-in-arms who was elected again to the presidency in November, 2006.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/657770161|title=Unfinished revolution Daniel Ortega and Nicaragua's struggle for liberation|last=1955-|first=Morris, Kenneth Earl,|date=2010|publisher=Lawrence Hill Books|isbn=1569767564|location=Chicago|oclc=657770161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ortega and his supporters stripped the MRS of its legal status about one week later. Téllez suspended her hunger strike on June 16, after doctors told her she would suffer irreparable damage if she continued her fast. She vowed to begin "a new stage of struggle" against what she termed the dictatorial policies of Daniel Ortega.

{{refimprove|date=February 2016}}
In [[etymology]], two or more words in the same language are called '''doublets''' or '''etymological twins''' or '''twinlings''' (or possibly triplets, and so forth) when they have different phonological forms but the same etymological root. Often, but not always, the words entered the language through different routes. Given that the kinship between words that have the same root and the same meaning is fairly obvious, the term is mostly used to characterize pairs of words that have diverged at least somewhat in meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=//archive.org/stream/principlesofengl01skeauoft#page/414/mode/2up|first=Walter William|last=Skeat|authorlink=Walter William Skeat|title=Principles of English Etymology: The Native Element|chapter=Doublets and Compounds|page=414''ff'', §389–391 and ''passim'' in all volumes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[English language|English]] ''pyre'' and ''fire'' are doublets with only remotely connected meanings despite both descending ultimately from the same [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) word *''{{PIE|péh₂ur}}''.

Words with similar meanings but subtle differences contribute to the richness of modern English, and many of these are doublets. A good example consists of the doublets ''frail'' and ''fragile''. (These are both ultimately from the [[Latin]] adjective ''{{lang|la|fragilis}}'', but ''frail'' evolved naturally through its slowly changing forms in Old French and Middle English, whereas ''fragile'' is a learned borrowing directly from Latin in the 15th century.)&lt;ref&gt;All English dictionaries list "easily broken, fragile" as one meaning of ''frail'', but a ''frail tea cup'' would indicate the speaker considers it more easily broken than a ''fragile tea cup''. In other words, ''fragile'' is the more usual term used to describe cups and other goods that break as easily as expected, and this is what is written on stickers applied to luggage, for example. When talking about people, both terms can also be used, but ''frail'' is the more usual term, so ''frail old woman'' is a common expression, whereas ''fragile old woman'' adds a nuance implying an infirmity that is not merely physical.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of nearly synonymous doublets is ''aperture'' and ''overture'' (the commonality behind the meanings is "opening"). But doublets may develop divergent meanings, such as the ''opposite'' words ''host'' and ''guest'', which come from the same PIE word *''{{PIE|gʰóstis}}'' and already existed as a doublet in Latin ''{{linktext|hospes|lang=la}}'' and then [[Old French]],&lt;ref&gt;''{{linktext|oste|lang=fro}}'' or ''{{lang|fro|[[wikt:hoste#Old French|hoste]]}}'' in Old French. {{Cite OED2|host, n.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being borrowed into English. Doublets also vary with respect to how far their forms have diverged. For example, the connection between ''[[wikt:Special:Search/levy|levy]]'' and ''[[levee]]'' is easy to guess, whereas the connection between ''sovereign'' and ''soprano'', or ''{{linktext|grammar}}'' and ''{{linktext|glamour}}'', is harder to guess.

==Origin==
Doublets can develop in various ways, according to which route the two forms took from the origin to their current form. Complex, multi-step paths are possible, though in many cases groups of terms follow the same path. Simple paths are discussed below, with the simplest distinction being that doublets in a given language can have their root in the same language (or an ancestor), or may originate in a separate language.

===Native origin===
Most simply, a native word can at some point split into two distinct forms, staying within a single language, as with English ''too'' which split from ''to''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=too&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, a word may be inherited from a parent language, and a [[cognate]] borrowed from a separate sister language. In other words, one route was direct inheritance, while the other route was inheritance followed by borrowing. In English this means one word inherited from a Germanic source, with, e.g., a Latinate cognate term borrowed from Latin or a Romance language. In English this is most common with words which can be traced back to [[Indo-European languages]], which in many cases share the same [[Proto-Indo-European language|proto-Indo-European]] root, such as [[Romance language|Romance]] ''[[beef]]'' and [[Germanic language|Germanic]] ''[[cow]]''. However, in some cases the branching is more recent, dating only to proto-Germanic, not to PIE; many words of Germanic origin occur in French and other Latinate languages, and hence in some cases were both inherited by English (from proto-Germanic) and borrowed from French or another source – see [[List of English Latinates of Germanic origin]]. The forward linguistic path also reflects cultural and historical transactions; often the name of an animal comes from Germanic while the name of its cooked meat comes from Romance. Since English is unusual in that it borrowed heavily from two distinct branches of the same language [[family tree]] – Germanic and Latinate/Romance – it has a relatively high number of this latter type of etymological twin. See [[list of Germanic and Latinate equivalents in English]] for further examples and discussion.

Less commonly, a native word may be borrowed into a foreign language, then [[reborrowed]] back into the original language, existing alongside the original term. An English example is ''[[animation]]'' and ''[[anime]]'' "Japanese animation", which was reborrowed from Japanese {{lang|ja|アニメ}} ''{{lang|ja-Latn|anime}}''. Such a word is sometimes called a ''{{lang|de|Rückwanderer}}'' (German for "one who wanders back").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Etymology: φλιτζάνι, fincan, فنجان |url=http://hoapp.com/thread-81754-1-1.html |website=Discuz! |accessdate=6 November 2014 |date=2011-06-20 |quote=a wild guess — the Persian word pingân seems to suggest the form 'finjan' is a reloan from Arabic. If there is a Pers. word ‘finjan”, this rather seems to suggest a Rückwanderer from Turkish – not from Arabic. |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141106161903/http://hoapp.com/thread-81754-1-1.html |archivedate=6 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Borrowed origin===
In case of twins of foreign origin, which consist of two borrowings (of related terms), one can distinguish if the borrowing is of a term and a descendent, or of two cognate terms (siblings).

Etymological twins are often a result of chronologically separate borrowing from a source language. In the case of English, this usually means once from French during the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]], and again later, after the word had evolved separately in French. An example of this is ''warranty'' and ''guarantee''.

Another possibility is borrowing from both a language and its daughter language. In English this is usually Latin and some other Romance language, particularly French – see [[Latin influence in English]]. The distinction between this and the previous is whether the source language has changed to a different language or not.

Less directly, a term may be borrowed both directly from a source language and indirectly via an intermediate language. In English this is most common in borrowings from Latin, and borrowings from French that are themselves from Latin; less commonly from Greek directly and through Latin.

In case of borrowing cognate terms, rather than descendents, most simply an existing doublet can be borrowed: two contemporary twin terms can be borrowed.

More remotely, cognate terms from different languages can be borrowed, such as ''[[sauce]]'' (Old French) and ''[[salsa (sauce)|salsa]]'' (Spanish), both ultimately from Latin, or ''[[tea]]'' (Dutch ''{{lang|nl|thee}}'') and ''chai'' (Hindi), both ultimately from [[Chinese languages|Chinese]]. This last pair reflects the history of how tea has entered English via different trade routes.

==By language==

===English===
Many thousands of English examples can be found, grouped according to their earliest deducible Indo-European ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;Calvert Watkins, ''The American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots''.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases over a hundred English words can be traced to a single root. Some random examples in English include:

*''[[hospitality|host]]'' and ''[[wikt:Special:Search/guest|guest]]'', the former through Latin and the latter through Germanic
*''strange'' and ''extraneous'' (from Latin, the former via Old French)
*''[[word]]'' and ''[[verb]]'', the former through Germanic and the latter through Latin
*''[[shadow]], [[shade (shadow)|shade]]'' and ''[[shed]]'' (all three from [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|sceadu}}'' "shadow, shade")
*''stand, stay, state, status'' and ''static'' (native, Middle French, Latin (twice) and Ancient Greek via Latin, from the same Indo-European root)
* ''[[wikt:chief|chief]]'', ''[[chef]]'', ''[[cape (geography)|cape]]'', ''[[capo]]'', ''[[caput]]'' and ''[[head]]'' (French (twice), Latin via French, Italian, Latin, and Germanic, all from the same Indo-European word *''{{PIE|ka(u)put}}'' "head")
*''secure'' and ''sure'' (from Latin, the latter via French)
*''[[capital (economics)|capital]]'', ''[[cattle]]'' and ''[[personal property|chattel]]'' (from Latin, Norman French and standard French)
*''plant'' and ''clan'' (from Latin, the latter via [[Old Irish]])
*''right, rich, raj, rex, regalia, reign, royal'' and ''[[Brazilian real|real]]'' (from Germanic, Celtic, Sanskrit, Latin (twice), French (twice) and Portuguese cognates, respectively)
*''[[carton]]'' and ''[[cartoon]]'', both ultimately Italian ''{{lang|it|cartone}}''
*''ward'' and ''guard'' (from Norman, the latter via French, both from Germanic); also ''warden'' and ''guardian''.
*''[[chrism]], [[cream]]'' and ''[[dirt|grime]]'' (the first from Greek, the second from French, in the 14th and 19th centuries, respectively, the last from Germanic)
*''[[cow]]'' and ''[[beef]]'' (from Proto-Indo-European; the former through Germanic – i.e. natively via Old English – the latter through Latin via French)
*''[[wheel]]'', ''[[wikt:cycle|cycle]]'' and ''[[chakra]]'' (Germanic, Greek via Latin and Sanskrit, all from Proto-Indo-European *''{{PIE|kʷékʷlo-}}'' "wheel")
*''frenetic'' and ''frantic'' (both from Greek, via Old French and Latin). More English doublets from Greek in [[English words of Greek origin]]
*''[[cave]]'' and ''cavern'' (from Latin ''{{lang|la|cavus}}'', via French and Germanic languages respectively)
*''price, prize, praise, pry'' (a lever) and ''[[price|prix]]'' (all from French, some diverged in English)
*''corn, kernel'' and ''grain'' (all ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *''{{PIE|grnóm}}'', the first two natively via Proto-Germanic (g → k), the last via Latin, borrowed from Old French)
*''clock, cloche, cloak'' and ''glockenspiel'' (from Medieval Latin ''{{lang|la|clocca}}'' "bell", via Middle Dutch, French (twice) and German respectively.)
*''pique, pike'' (weapon) – both from Middle French ''{{lang|frm|pique}}''
*''[[mr|mister]], [[master (form of address)|master]], [[meister]], [[maestro]], [[mistral (wind)|mistral]]'' (a Mediterranean wind), ''[[magistrate]]'' are all ultimately derived from Latin ''{{lang|la|magister}}'' ("teacher").
*''[[wikt:equip|equip]], [[ship]], [[skiff]]'' and ''[[skipper (boating)|skipper]]'' (Old French, Old English, Old Italian via Middle French, and Middle Dutch, respectively, all from Proto-Germanic ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|skipą}}'' "ship")
*''[[wikt:domain|domain]]'', ''[[demesne]]'', ''[[dominion]]'' and ''[[dungeon]]'' (all from French)
*''[[Slav]]'' and ''[[slave]]'' (from Latin and French, respectively, both ultimately from Proto-Slavic via Greek)
*''Discrete'' and ''Discreet'' (from Latin, diverged in English, now [[homophones]])
*''[[wikt:Charity|charity]], [[cheer]], [[wikt:cherish|cherish]]'' and ''[[whore]]'' (French (thrice), the second via Anglo-Norman, and Germanic, respectively, all ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *''{{PIE|kāro-}}'', *''{{PIE|kéh₂ro-}}'' "dear; loved")

====Norman vs. standard or Modern French====
Many words of [[French language|French]] origin were borrowed twice or more. There were at least three periods of borrowing: One that occurred shortly after the [[Norman Conquest]] and came from [[Norman French]], one in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries from standard (Parisian) French at the time when English nobles were switching from French to English, and a third one during the sixteenth to nineteenth century, when France was at the height of its power and international influence. Examples of doublets from the first and second periods are ''catch'' vs. ''chase'', ''cattle'' vs. ''chattel'', and ''warden'' vs. ''guardian''. More recent borrowings are often distinguished by maintaining the French spelling and pronunciation, e.g. ''chef'' (vs. ''chief''), ''pâté'' (vs. ''paste''), ''fête'' (vs. ''feast''). There are multiple doublets caused by the ''w'' → ''g'' and ''ca'' → ''cha'' sound changes, which happened in standard French but not Norman French. Several of these examples also reflect changes that occurred after Old French which caused the possible environments of {{ipa|[s]}} to be greatly reduced.

===Chinese===
{{Main|Chinese character classification#Derivative cognates|Literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters}}
Derivative cognates are a [[Chinese character classification|classification of Chinese characters]] which have similar meanings and often the same etymological root, but which have diverged in pronunciation and meaning. An example is the doublet {{lang|zh|考}} and {{lang|zh|老}}. At one time they were pronounced similarly and meant "old (person)." {{lang|zh|老}} ({{IPA|/lɑʊ̯˨˩˦/}} in [[Standard Mandarin]]) has retained this meaning, but {{lang|zh|考}} {{IPA|/kʰɑʊ̯˨˩˦/}} now mainly means "examine".

Differing [[Literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters|literary and colloquial readings]] of certain [[Chinese character]]s are common doublets in many [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]], and the reading distinctions for certain phonetic features often typify a dialect group. 
For a given Chinese [[variety (linguistics)|variety]], colloquial readings typically reflect native vernacular phonology. Literary readings are used in some formal settings ([[recitation]], some loanwords and names) and originate from other, typically more [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestigious]] varieties. 
Sometimes literary and colloquial readings of the same character have different meanings. For example, in [[Cantonese]], the character {{lang|zh|平}} can have the colloquial pronunciation {{IPA|/pʰɛŋ˨˩/}} ("inexpensive"), and the literary pronunciation {{IPA|/pʰɪŋ˨˩/}} ("flat").

===Japanese===
In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], doublets are most significant in borrowings from Chinese, and are visible as different [[on'yomi]] (Sino-Japanese readings) of [[kanji]] characters. There have been three major periods of borrowing from Chinese, together with some modern borrowings. These borrowings are from different regions (hence different Chinese varieties) and different periods, and thus the pronunciations have varied, sometimes widely. However, due to consistent Chinese writing, with cognate [[morpheme]]s represented by the same character, the etymological relation is clear. This is most significant at the level of morphemes, where a given character is pronounced differently in different words, but in some cases the same word was borrowed twice. In scholarly terms, these have been very valuable for reconstructing the sounds of [[Middle Chinese]], and understanding how the pronunciations differed between Chinese regions and varied over time.

===New Indo-Aryan===
In [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and other [[New Indo-Aryan]] languages, native doublets are identified as either ''{{lang|sa-Latn|[[tadbhava]]}}'' ('became that'), which is ultimately derived from [[Sanskrit]] but underwent changes through time, or ''{{lang|sa-Latn|[[tatsama]]}}'' ('same as that'), which is borrowed directly from literary Sanskrit. For example, Hindi ''{{lang|sa-Latn|[[wikt:बाघ|bāgh]]}}'' 'tiger' is derived by historical stages ({{lang|sa-Latn|tadbhava}}) from Sanskrit ''{{lang|sa-Latn|[[wikt:व्याघ्र|vyāghra]]}}'' 'tiger'. Meanwhile, Hindi has also directly borrowed ({{lang|sa-Latn|tatsama}}) the Sanskrit word ''{{lang|sa-Latn|vyāghra}}'', meaning 'tiger' in a more literary register.

===Polish===
;Doublets
* ''{{lang|pl|(o-) pierdolić}}'' ("to fuck, babble, condemn," vulgar language), ''{{lang|pl|(o-) pierdzielić}}'' ("babble, condemn," informal language)—cognate to Russian {{lang|ru|определять}} ("determine")

;Triplets
* ''{{lang|pl|[[:pl:upiór|upiór]]}}'', ''{{lang|pl|[[:pl:wąpierz|wąpierz]]}}'', ''{{lang|pl|[[:pl:wampir|wampir]]}}'' ("[[vampire]]"; see the [[:pl:Wampir#Etymologia|etymology of ''{{lang|pl|wampir|nocat=y}}'']])
* ''{{lang|pl|szczać}}'' ("piss", vulgar), ''{{lang|pl|sikać}}'' ("spout", plain, informal), ''{{lang|pl|siusiać}}'' ("pee," childish, euphemism; the latter is possibly an irregular diminutive derivation of the former)
* ''{{lang|pl|[[:pl:magister|magister]]}}'', ''{{lang|pl|[[:pl:majster|majster]]}}'', ''{{lang|pl|[[:pl:mistrz|mistrz]]}}'': from German ''{{lang|de|Meister}}'', Dutch ''{{lang|nl|meester}}'', and Latin ''{{lang|la|magister}}''; cognate to Italian ''{{lang|it|maestro}}'', English ''master, mister''

===Spanish===
As with many languages in Europe, a great deal of borrowing from written Latin – ''{{lang|es|latinismos}}'' ([[Latinism]]s), or ''{{lang|es|cultismos}}'' (learnèd words)&lt;ref name=Esp/&gt; – occurred during the Renaissance and the early modern era. Because Spanish is itself a [[Romance language]] already with many native words of Latin ancestry (transmitted orally, so with natural sound changes),&lt;ref name=Esp&gt;{{cite book |last=Dworkin |first=Steven N. |title=A History of the Spanish Lexicon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V4f8ZpJAhgIC&amp;pg=PA158 |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-954114-0 |page=158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the later written borrowing created a number of doublets. Adding to this was Spain's conquest by the Moors in the Middle Ages, leading to another vector for creating doublets (Latin to Arabic to Spanish).

'''Easyswap''' is a [[Switzerland]]-based on-line [[local exchange trading system]] (LETS) platform featuring [[Geolocation|geolocation data]] as well as a [[complementary currency]].

== History ==

Easyswap began as an initiative of the city of [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, to reduce social problems such as long-term unemployment and [[social exclusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Editorial|title=Les biens et les compétences s’échangent sur Easyswap|url=http://archives.24heures.ch/VQ/LAUSANNE/-/article-2008-10-2248/editorial|accessdate=21 November 2011|newspaper=24 Heures|date=October 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A working group, made up of welfare recipients recruited by the city's social services department, came up with the idea of a web-based project modeled on [[local exchange trading systems]] (LETS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pilet|first=François|title=L'échange de services perce sur le Net|url=https://www.easyswap.org/images/cms/medias/Le_Temps_30_10_2008.png|accessdate=17 January 2012|newspaper=Le Temps|date=October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their project was to serve two purposes:  promote [[social inclusion]] by nurturing contacts between different societal groups and encourage the [[sustainable consumption]] of consumer goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Meyer|first=Guillaume|title=A Lausanne, une monnaie internet signe le retour de l'économie de troc|url=https://www.easyswap.org/images/cms/medias/Agefi_30_10_2008.png|accessdate=17 January 2012|newspaper=Agefi (Switzerland)|date=October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Administered by an eponymous non profit association, easyswap.org was officially launched in October, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Monnier|first=Philippe D.|title=Le troc remis au goût du jour|url=http://www.pme.ch/de/artikelanzeige/artikelanzeige.asp?pkBerichtNr=177504|accessdate=17 January 2012|newspaper=PME Magazine|date=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011,  a version of the easyswap platform was developed for the [[University of Lausanne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Despont|first=Aurélie|title=Prêt à partager?|url=http://www.unil.ch/webdav/site/unicom/shared/uniscope/2011-2012/566.pdf|accessdate=17 January 2012|newspaper=Uniscope|date=September 12 – October 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Swap ==

The swap is a virtual,  [[complementary currency]] in use on the easyswap platform.  The swap has a "theoretical value" of one  [[Swiss franc]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pilet|first=François|title=L'échange de services perce sur le Net|url=https://www.easyswap.org/images/cms/medias/Le_Temps_30_10_2008.png|accessdate=17 January 2012|newspaper=Le Temps|date=October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cannot be bought or sold using any other currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Meyer|first=Guillaume|title=A Lausanne, une monnaie internet signe le retour de l'économie de troc|url=https://www.easyswap.org/images/cms/medias/Agefi_30_10_2008.png|accessdate=17 January 2012|newspaper=Agefi (Switzerland)|date=October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[value (economics)|value]] is determined by individual members who are free to set their own prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crivelli|first=Marie-Antoinette|title=Comment s'enrichir sans jamais toucher un seul franc!|url=http://archives.lematin.ch/loisirs/multimedia/comment-senrichir-sans-jamais-toucher-un-seul-franc-2008-11-02|accessdate=17 January 2012|newspaper=Le Matin|date=November 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Swap 'n' roll ==

The easyswap platform uses an [[open source]] technology based on [[PHP5]] [[Zend Framework]] developed and maintained by Swap 'n' roll.

Other open source LETS platforms include [[Cyclos]], [http://weblets.sourceforge.net/ WebLETS] and [http://www.hughbarnard.org/?q=node/3 Cclite].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9665">'''Experimental Pragmatics''' is an academic area that uses [[experiment]]s (concerning children's and adults' comprehension of sentences, utterances, or story-lines) to test theories about the way people understand utterances—and, by extension, one another—in context (this is an area known as [[pragmatics]]).

==Technique==

Given that an utterance generally does not fully determine the message it is destined to convey, the main question this field asks is, how does a listener fully comprehend a speaker's intention?  For example, if one were to read about a singer who says "That was a brilliant performance" to her colleague after they both sang beautifully, the utterance would seem sincere and truthful.  If the same utterance were made after both sang terribly, the utterance would be perceived as ironic. The very same utterance can have two entirely different interpretations as a function of the speaker's intended meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spotorno &amp; Noveck|title=When is irony effortful?|journal=JEP:General|date=2014|volume=143|issue=4|pages=1649–1665|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ira_Noveck/publication/261953231_When_Is_Irony_Effortful/links/0c960536e17e10051b000000.pdf|doi=10.1037/a0036630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental pragmatics adopts existing cognitive and psycholinguistic techniques in order to carry out its investigations. While developmental progressions can reveal how interlocutors across several ages interpret utterances with clear pragmatic potential, reading times can reveal how sentences are processed (as relatively easy or difficult). While [[EEG]]s can  reveal sharp on-line measures for determining how a word is integrated into a sentence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nieuwland, Ditman, &amp; Kuperberg|title=On the incrementality of pragmatic processing: An ERP investigation of informativeness and pragmatic abilities.|journal=JML|date=2010|volume=63|issue=3|pages=324–346|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749596X10000549|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2010.06.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[fMRI]] can reveal what areas of the brain are recruited when processing one reading over another.&lt;ref name="Robert Wright"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientists Find Brain's Irony-Detection Center!|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/08/scientists-find-brains-irony-detection-center/260728/|website=atlantic.com|publisher=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers have laid the groundwork for much of the work in pragmatics. Modern investigations can be traced back to [[Paul Grice]] and his philosophical approach to utterance understanding. Grice’s initial contribution was to propose a novel analysis in which he distinguished between ''sentence meaning'' (what the words and grammar mean) and ''speaker’s meaning'' (what the speaker actually intended to communicate by uttering a sentence). According to Grice, understanding an utterance requires access to, or making hypotheses about, the speaker’s intention and thus involves going beyond the meanings of the words in the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grice, H.P.|title=Meaning|journal=Philosophical Review|date=1957|volume=66|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experimental turn was the result of an effort to test theories that had until then relied largely on intuition.  The most investigated topic in experimental pragmatics is scalar [[implicature]], which concerns the way a weakly expressed utterance (e.g. ''Some of their identity documents are forgeries'') is interpreted.  While the linguistic  meaning of the utterance is general (''Some and perhaps all of their identity documents are forgeries''), a listener can conceivably attribute to the speaker a more narrow (and more informative) interpretation (''Some but not all of their identity documents are forgeries''). While the narrower meaning seems readily accessible to our intuitions, the question is how does it emerge. The earliest experiments &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bott | first1 = L | last2 = Noveck | first2 = I.

While scalar implicatures continue to dominate discussion, other prominent topics that fall under the rubric of experimental pragmatics include [[irony]], [[metaphor]], [[metonymy]], [[reference]], and word-learning.

==XPrag conference==

The growing impact of Experimental Pragmatics can be seen through the increasing number of conferences, workshops, grants, and jobs that have been devoted to it.  In one recent announcement (September 2015) for a workshop entitled ''Trends in Experimental Pragmatics,'' and organized by the Zentrum für Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft (ZAS) in Berlin, the organizers wrote:  "The field of Experimental Pragmatics was founded by the publication of Noveck &amp; Sperber (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Noveck, I.  |author2=Sperber, D.|title=Experimental Pragmatics|publisher=Palgraves|isbn=1403903514|url=https://www.amazon.com/Experimental-Pragmatics-Palgrave-Languages-Cognition/dp/1403903514}}&lt;/ref&gt; who confidently wrote: 'this volume lays down the bases for a new field, Experimental Pragmatics, that draws on pragmatics, psycholinguistics and also on the psychology of reasoning.' The bold prediction has proven remarkably accurate: Experimental Pragmatics has since successfully established itself as an independent field of research, providing a new perspective on age-old pragmatic problems and inspiring new lines of inquiry. In addition to the fields Noveck &amp; Sperber above mentioned, semantics, neuroscience and philosophy have also contributed to Experimental Pragmatics, but also been influenced by it."&lt;ref name="Trends announcement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Workshop: Trends in Experimental Pragmatics|url=http://www.xprag.de/?page_id=2903|website=xprag.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first workshop with the title ''Experimental Pragmatics'' took place in Luton, UK in 1998 and was organized by Billy Clark and Steve Nicolle under the auspices of the Linguistics Association of Great Britain (LAGB). The field began to catch on after a workshop in 2001 (organized by Ira Noveck and Dan Sperber in Lyon, France under the auspices of the [[European Science Foundation]]).  The workshop organizers invited many of the pragmatists and psychologists who consistently relied on, or called for, experimental findings to support or test their pragmatic accounts.  Participants in the workshop included Anne Bezuidenhout, [[Robyn Carston]], [[Gennaro Chierchia]], Billy Clark, [[Herb Clark]], Ray Gibbs, Vittorio Girotto, [[Sam Glucksberg]], [[Gradient Salience Model|Rachel Giora]], Ira Noveck, Guy Politzer, Anne Reboul, [[Francois Recanati]],  Tony Sanford,  [[Dan Sperber]], Johan van der Auwera, Jean-Baptiste van der Henst, and [[Deirdre Wilson]]. Contributors to the volume (Noveck &amp; Sperber, 2004) were those who pioneered the carrying out of experimental approaches to test pragmatic accounts. Although informal conferences took place after the 2001 workshop, proper biennial conferences on the topic of Experimental Pragmatics have been held since 2005 across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=XPRAG5|url=https://xprag2013.wp.hum.uu.nl/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference, now known as "XPrag", was held in the United States for the first time in July, 2015. A book entitled "Experimental Pragmatics:  The Making of a Cognitive Science", by Ira Noveck, came out in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Noveck, I. (2018). Experimental Pragmatics:  The Making of a Cognitive Science.  Cambridge:  CUP. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Experimental-Pragmatics-Cognitive-Science-Semantics/dp/1107084903/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1538554214&amp;sr=1-1&amp;refinements=p_27%3AIra+A.+Noveck&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research funding==

Two major European grants have supported the field.  The European Science Foundation's (ESF's) Research Network Program ([http://www.esf.org/index.php?id=6248 EURO-XPRAG]) sponsored European collaborations, workshops and conferences between 2009 and 2014.  The German Research Foundation (DFG) established the priority program [http://xprag.de/ XPRAG.de] in 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3881">'''Eyvind Mehle''' (1895 &amp;ndash; 15 July 1945) was a Norwegian radio personality, media professor and Nazi collaborator.

He was born as '''Eyvind Mæhle''', but changed his last name in 1930. He was hired in 1925 in [[Kringkastingsselskapet]], the first broadcaster of Norwegian radio.&lt;ref name=nkl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Hans Fredrik|last=Dahl|authorlink=Hans Fredrik Dahl|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl, Hans Fredrik]]|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]]|title=Mehle, Eyvind|url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/m/m1.html#mehle-eyvind|accessdate=30 January 2010|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|volume=|location=Oslo|isbn=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610003026/http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/m/m1.html#mehle-eyvind|archivedate=10 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his specialities were half-hour lectures in the form of [[travel writing|travel descriptions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Hans Fredrik|last=Dahl|authorlink=Hans Fredrik Dahl|title=NRK i fred og krig. Kringkastingen i Norge 1920–1945|publisher=Universitetsforlaget|location=Oslo|year=1991|page=35|isbn=82-00-02785-6|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later joined the Norwegian Fascist party [[Nasjonal Samling]] in its first year of existence, 1933, and served as its press spokesperson for some years.&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt;

On 9 April 1940 Norway was [[Operation Weserübung|invaded by Nazi Germany]], and a [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|German occupation]] followed. On 25 September 1940, Mehle was named as director of verbal programs in [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] radio.&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt; As one of two program directors, the other being [[Edvard Sylou-Creutz]], Mehle was considered as the successor of pre-war broadcasting director [[Olav Midttun]], despite being a subordinate of commissary president [[Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie (Nazi)|Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie]].&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, 1991: p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

This command chain did not work well. Although there was some rivalry between Mehle and Sylou-Crantz,&lt;ref name=p205&gt;Dahl, 1991: p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; the most severe rivalry was between Mehle and Christie. To start with, Mehle had to hand Christie his inaugural speech on 29 September, because Christie had limited knowledge of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation. In a broader context, as Nazis, Mehle was a [[Germanophile]] [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] supporter whereas Christie was a more Norwegian-nationalistic [[Vidkun Quisling|Quisling]] supporter. In addition, Christie's [[freemasonry]] caused resentment. Mehle intrigued by pitting Christie against the broadcasting department ({{lang-de|Abteilung Rundfunk}}) of the [[Reichskommissariat Norwegen]]. He also treated his own subordinates badly; he threatened employees with a gun on numerous occasions, and showed signs of [[paranoia]] and general mental instability.&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, 1991: p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1941, Mehle became leader ([[Führer]]) of the Nasjonal Samling party chapter at the Broadcasting Corporation.&lt;ref name=p205/&gt; After a while, however, the personal antagonisms led to him seeking another job. He was appointed as professor of [[media studies]] at the Nazi-occupied [[University of Oslo]]. Since late 1943 no tuition or teaching had taken place at the University, only research.&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt;

Around the end of World War II in Norway in May 1945, Mehle fled to [[Sweden]]. He drowned there later in 1945.&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt;

'''Frank-Richard Hamm''' (October 8, 1920 &amp;mdash; November 11, 1973) was a 20th-century [[Indologist]] and [[Tibetologist]]. Frank-Richard Hamm was born on October 8, 1920 in [[Königsberg]].

His family moved to Hamburg two years later where he graduated from the [[Kirchenpauer Gymnasium]] in 1939. From shortly after beginning university in 1940 until 1945 he served in the military. He completed his undergraduate studies in 1948. From 1948 to 1952 he was a tutor of Indology at Hamburg, and from 1952 to 1954 he was a member of the [[International Academy of Indian Culture]] in [[Nagpur]], [[India]]. He worked as an academic in Hamburg, Berlin, and Bonn, where he remained as a professor from 1965 until his death.

His works were devoted to [[Jainism]], the transmission of Sanskrit Buddhist texts in Tibetan, and the biography and poetry of the Tibetan saint [[Milarepa|Milaräpa]]. Hamm died November, 11th 1973.

'''Giuseppe Ferlini''' (April 23, 1797 &amp;ndash; December 30, 1870&lt;ref name=grave&gt;Inscription from his gravestone in the Certosa di Bologna (see picture).&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[combat medic]] turned [[explorer]] and [[treasure hunter]], well known for having raided and vandalized several [[List of Pyramids of Meroe|pyramids of Meroë]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Bologna]], it is known that since 1815 he travelled across [[Greece]] and later he reached [[Egypt]];&lt;ref name=grave/&gt; here he joined the [[Egyptian Army]] during the [[History of Sudan (1821–85)|Egyptian conquest of Sudan]] and in 1830 he became surgeon-major. Under the army, he stayed at [[Sennar]] and then at [[Khartoum]] where he met the Albanian merchant Antonio Stefani.&lt;ref name=www&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dawson |first1=Warren R. |authorlink1=Warren R.

Once arrived at Meroë, and incited by the local workers who talked about a legend regarding 40 ''[[Ethiopian units of measurement|ardeb]]'' of gold, Ferlini started to raid and demolish several pyramids, which were found “in good conditions” by [[Frédéric Cailliaud]] just a few years earlier.&lt;ref name=cimmino/&gt; At [[Wad ban Naqa]], he leveled the pyramid N6 of the ''[[kandake]]'' [[Amanishakheto]] starting from the top, and finally found her treasure composed of dozens of gold and silver jewelry pieces. Overall, he is considered responsible for the destruction of over 40 pyramids.&lt;ref name=cimmino/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Welsby |first=Derek A.|authorlink= |date=1998|title= The kingdom of Kush: the Napatan and Meroitic empire |url= |location= Princeton, New Jersey |publisher= Markus Wiener |page= |isbn= |access-date=}}, pp. 86; 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Sudan Meroe Pyramids 30sep2005 3.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Ferlini raided the Meroe pyramids in 1834.]]
Having found the treasure he was looking for, in 1836 Ferlini returned home.&lt;ref name=grave/&gt; A year later he wrote a report of his expedition containing a catalog of his findings, which was translated in French and republished in 1838.{{efn|group=note|Giuseppe Ferlini, ''Relation Historique des Fouilles Operées dans la Nubia par le docteur Joseph Ferlini de Bologna, suivie d'un catalogue des objets qu'il a trouvés dans l'une des quarante-sept pyramides aux environs de l'ancienne ville de Meroe, et d'une description des grands déserts de Coruscah et de Sinnaar.'' Rome, 1838.}}&lt;ref name=www/&gt; He tried to sell the treasure, but at this time nobody believed that such high quality jewellery could be made in [[Black Africa]]. His finds were finally sold in Germany: part of these were purchased by king [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] and are now in the [[Staatliche Sammlung für Ägyptische Kunst|State Museum of Egyptian Art of Munich]], while the remaining – under suggestions of [[Karl Richard Lepsius]] and of [[Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen]] – was bought by the [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin]] where it still is.&lt;ref name=cimmino/&gt;

Ferlini died in Bologna on December 30, 1870 and was buried in the [[Certosa di Bologna]].&lt;ref name=grave/&gt;

The proverb is based on a 1606 satirical [[pasquinade]] that has been described as "critical of everything in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth—[[xenophobia|foreigners, immigrants]], “[[heresy|heretics]],” peasants, burgers, and servants, and [[antisemitism|also Jews]]".&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

==History and versions==
The proverb dates to 16th&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; or more likely 17th century;&lt;ref name="Tokarska-Bakir2004" /&gt; by the latter time it had become quite popular.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Polish historian [[Stanisław Kot]] found the earliest printed reference to this saying in an anonymous [[Latin]] poem (though with a Polish title, ''Paskwiliusze na królewskim weselu podrzucone, lit. ''[[Pasquino|Pasquinades]] [a genre of satirical [[epigram]]] planted at the royal wedding party'')'' of 1606,&lt;ref name="Tokarska-Bakir2004" /&gt; satirically commemorating the wedding of  [[Sigismund III Vasa]] and [[Constance of Austria]] the previous year.&lt;ref name="Tokarska-Bakir2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The poem was later included in a work by [[Szymon Starowolski]] in 1636.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MmHf-O_BYH4C&amp;pg=PT10|title=Stacye zołnierskie: Abo W wyćiągániu ich z dobr kośćielnych potrzebne przestrogi.

The phrases are often in a varying order, with some elements omitted (ex. Kraszewski cites only the "Hell for the peasants, and Paradise for the Jews" part). The four-part version, including the reference to the purgatory for the townspeople, has been recorded in Polish [[paremiology]] collection of 1887 by {{ill|Samuel Adalberg|pl|Samuel Adalberg}} (""Polska niebem dla szlachty, czyśćcem dla mieszczan, piekłem dla chłopów, a rajem dla Żydów""), and it is also closest to the 1606 original, which differs only in order, and in referring to the ruling class as "courtiers' dominion" rather then "heaven for the nobles".&lt;ref name="Tokarska-Bakir2004"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4uQsAQAAIAAJ|title=Rzeczy mgliste: eseje i studia|author=Joanna Tokarska-Bakir|publisher=Fundacja Pogranicze|year=2004|isbn=978-83-86872-60-2|page=53}} [http://ewa.home.amu.edu.pl/Tokarska-Bakir,%20Zydzi%20u%20Kolberga.doc Mirror]&lt;/ref&gt; Križanić used "Paradisus Hebraeorum" ([[Hebrews]]' Paradise) instead of Jewish Paradise.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A five-part version version including another phrase from the 1606 poem, a non-Biblical reference to Poland as a goldmine for foreigners also exists; it has been attributed as a German proverb in 1861 and goes "Polen ist der Bauern Holle, der Juden Paradies, der Burger Fegefeuer, der Edelleute Himmel, under der Fremden Goldgrube".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1zo4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA790|title=Handy-book of Literary Curiosities|last=Walsh|first=William Shepard|date=1892|publisher=J.B.

== Meaning ==
The author of the 1606 pasquinade is unknown, through it has been suggested by [[Stanisław Kot]] that it was created by a Catholic townsman, perhaps a priest, jealous of the nobility and the Jewry.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://culture.pl/en/article/a-virtual-visit-to-the-museum-of-the-history-of-polish-jews|title=A Virtual Visit to the Museum of the History of Polish Jews|work=Culture.pl|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tokarska-Bakir2004" /&gt; Konrad Matyjaszek has described the 1606 work as "expressing anti-gentry and anti-Jewish sentiments".&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]] summarized the original text as "a pasquinade critical of everything in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth—foreigners, immigrants, “heretics,” peasants, burgers, and servants, and also Jews." &lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Over the time, the longer poem has lapsed into obscurity, and reduced to a popular proverb.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The sarcastic and satirical&lt;ref name="Tokarska-Bakir2004" /&gt; proverb contrasts the starkly different situation of four social classes in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, with the most privileged nobility ([[szlachta]]) on top ("paradise for nobles"), and the impoverished, usually [[Serfdom in Poland|enserfed]] peasantry on the bottom ("hell for peasants). The other two classes are the townspeople (burghers) and the Jewry. By 16th century, the position of the town-dwellers in the Commonwealth has been declining (hence, the "purgatory for townspeople"), while the situation of Polish Jewry was reasonably safe and prosperous, particularly when compared to the situation of Jewry in most other European countries (hence, the "heaven for Jews").&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies2005" /&gt;

==Paradise for the Jews==
The expression "Paradisus Iudaeorum" (also spelled "Paradisus Judaeorum", lit. "Paradise of the Jews") has been often used to refer to the [[History of the Jews in Poland|golden age of Jewish life in Poland]]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Despard|first=Matthew K.|date=2015-01-02|title=In Search of a Polish Past|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0449010X.2015.1010393|journal=Jewish Quarterly|language=en|volume=62|issue=1|pages=40–43|doi=10.1080/0449010x.2015.1010393|issn=0449-010X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to compare Poland to the Jewish homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenfeld|first=Gavriel D.|date=2016-09|title=Mixed Metaphors in Muranów: Holocaust Memory and Architectural Meaning at the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23256249.2016.1242550?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Dapim: Studies on the Holocaust|language=en|volume=30|issue=3|pages=258–273|doi=10.1080/23256249.2016.1242550|issn=2325-6249}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Klier]] entitled one of his book chapters about Eastern European Jewish history "Poland-Lithuania: "Paradise for Jews"".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.niupress.niu.edu/niupress/Scripts/Book/bookResults.asp?ID=490|title=Russia Gathers Her Jews.

===Controversy over use at POLIN===
The phrase is used as the name of [[POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews#Paradisus Iudaeorum (1569-1648)|a gallery]] covering the "Golden Age of Polish Jewry" period in [[POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews]] that opened in 2013 in [[Warsaw]],&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.polin.pl/en/wystawy-wystawa-glowna-galerie/paradisus-iudaeorum|title=Paradisus Iudaeorum (1569–1648)|website=POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this was criticized for being a lampooning reference, and its inclusion and form were subject to a heated discussion. This ambiguity was first going to be expressed with a [[question mark]] appended to the gallery's name, but it was later decided not to include this.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Elżbieta Janicka, in her 2016 critique of the POLIN Museum exhibition, has described the saying as an anti-Semitic myth, at the same time noting that it has been used by pro-assimilation Polish Jews in the era of the Second Polish Republic (such as in the {{ill|lt=Henryk Nusbaum's|Henryk Nusbaum|pl|Henryk Nusbaum}} [[Jewish assimilation|Jewish assimilationist]] newspaper ''Rozwaga'' in 1918) "for the purpose of convincing Polish public opinion that: a) Jews have the right to live in Poland; b) the “true Poland” is a Poland that is kind to Jews; c) anti-Semitism is a misunderstanding: a non-Polish element, instilled by the partitioning powers".&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt; Also in 2016, {{ill|Joanna Tokarska-Bakir|pl|Joanna Tokarska-Bakir}} argued that the use of this phrase for the museum's exhibition is disrespectful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tokarska-Bakir|first=Joanna|date=2016-12-28|title=Polin: „Ultimate Lost Object”|url=https://ispan.waw.pl/journals/index.php/slh/article/view/slh.2016.002|journal=Studia Litteraria et Historica|volume=0|issue=5|pages=1–8|issn=2299-7571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Konrad Matyjaszek wrote that the phrase Paradisus Judaeorum was used by the 17th century anonymous writer "to express his conviction that Poland is ruled by Jews and that they enjoy excessive privileges".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]], Program Director of the Core Exhibition of the POLIN Museum, commenting on that controversy and explaining why the museum has chosen to use this phrase in the first place, acknowledged that if taken out of context, "to characterize the Commonwealth as a Jewish paradise could be seen as a way of saying that Jews had it “too good"",  but the use of this phrase is intentional, as it is the exhibition intention to engage the reader in a complex debate that is more than just a simple, binary white and black, good and evil simplicity.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garbowski|first=Christopher|date=2016|title=Polin: From a “Here You Shall Rest” Covenant to the Creation of a Polish Jewish History Museum.

In 2017 Kamil Kijek summarizing both sides of the debate has explicit noted that while "The criticism pertaining to the somewhat unfortunate name of the gallery [...] is justified. The name “Paradise for Jews” is given without quotation marks there. Visitors to the Museum do not have an opportunity to learn from the exhibition that its title is taken from an anti-Jewish text, which claims that the good living conditions Jews enjoyed in Poland were something that should change", the phrase is just one of many elements framing the Wall of Words museum exhibition which displays this proverb (among a number of other sayings and quotes). Kijek notes that the POLIN exhibition was designed by "one of the most distinguished experts on the history of Jews in Poland in the modern period, {{ill|Moshe Rosman|pl|Moshe Rosman}}" and the scope of the museum is more than just "antisemitism and showing Jews as its victims", something that critics of the museum, most notably Janicka, unduly focusing on the potentially misleading "Jewish Paradise" phrase, seem to disregard.&lt;ref name=kk/&gt; He concludes that out of context the saying can indeed be confusing, but within a broader context it is representative of a much more complex and nuanced relationship between Jews and the Poles.&lt;ref name=kk&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kijek|first=Kamil|date=2017|title=For whom and about what?

'''Historical particularism''' (coined by [[Marvin Harris]] in 1968)&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin: ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture''. 1968.  (Reissued 2001) New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company&lt;/ref&gt; is widely considered the first American [[anthropological]] school of thought.

Closely associated with [[Franz Boas]] and the [[Boasian anthropology|Boasian approach to anthropology]], historical particularism rejected the [[Classical social evolutionism|cultural evolutionary model]] that had dominated anthropology until Boas. It argued that each society is a collective representation of its unique historical past. Boas rejected parallel evolutionism, the idea that all societies are on the same path and have reached their specific level of development the same way all other societies have.&lt;ref name="methods"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boas |first=Franz |authorlink=Franz Boas |title=The Methods of Ethnology |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=311–321 |date=December 1920 |format=[[jstor]] [[PDF]] |doi=10.1525/aa.1920.22.4.02a00020
  | jstor=660328}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, historical particularism showed that societies could reach the same level of [[cultural development]] through different paths.&lt;ref name="methods"/&gt;

Boas suggested that diffusion, trade, corresponding environment, and historical accident may create similar cultural traits.&lt;ref name="methods"/&gt;  Three traits, as suggested by Boas, are used to explain cultural customs: environmental conditions, psychological factors, and historical connections, history being the most important (hence the school's name).&lt;ref name="methods"/&gt;

Critics of historical particularism argue that it is [[Antipositivist|anti theoretical]] because it doesn't seek to make universal theories, applicable to all the world's cultures.  Boas believed that theories would arise spontaneously once enough data was collected.  This school of anthropological thought was the first to be uniquely American and Boas (his school of thought included) was, arguably, the most influential anthropological thinker in American history.

'''John Albert Bullbrook''' (1882–1967; born in the [[Medway]] area in what was then [[Kent]] in [[South-East England]]) was an author, [[archaeologist]] and archaeological historian, who went to [[Trinidad]] in 1913 as a petroleum geologist. He began his archaeological career in 1919, pioneering the search on the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous population]] of Trinidad.

By the early 1930s, he already provides evidence of the prominence of reflections on the indigenous history of Trinidad, and on the figure of the [[Island Caribs|Carib]], in some of the élites’ writings of local history.

Famously in a public lecture in 1938, John Bullbrook, by then a local specialist in the [[Amerindian]] history of Trinidad, made the comment: "To this day we speak of the Queen if the Caribs at Arima, yet I doubt if there is much--if any--Carib blood in her race.".&lt;ref name="Bul40"/&gt;{{rp|p.4}}

In 1940, for a public lecture and book published under the Royal Victoria Museum and the Historical Society of Trinidad and Tobago, entitled ''The Ierian Race'', Bullbrook wrote: "Probably, if I were to ask any of my audience this evening what was the predominant or even the only race in Trinidad at the time of the discovery by Cristobal Colon, the reply would be unhesitatingly: ‘Why, Carib, of course’".&lt;ref name="Bul40"/&gt;{{rp|p.1}}

Throughout the 1940s, he conducted extensive excavations in the Amerindian middens in Cedros, Erin and [[Palo Seco, Trinidad|Palo Seco]]. The Cedros site in Trinidad, which he excavated with Irving Rouse in 1946, is considered one of the most important archaeological sites in the Caribbean, consisting of a partly destroyed shell midden located on the southwest tip of Trinidad. The corrected radiocarbon datings for the finds at this site were given as 190 B.C. and A.D. 100.&lt;ref name="Bul53"/&gt;{{rp|pp.96–97, 101–105, 109–110}}

Bullbrook, as a partisan in the local debate over whether the true natives of Trinidad were Carib or [[Arawak]], lamented later, in 1960, that the "tradition" of believing that Caribs were the indigenous people of Trinidad was "deep rooted and hard to destroy".&lt;ref name="Bul60"/&gt;{{rp|pp.54–55}}

In July 1960, Bullbrook, at the first conference in the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] on [[pre-Columbian|pre-Columbian archaeology]] held in [[Fort-de-France]], [[Martinique]], discussed his research into the "Arawaks and Caribs of Trinidad" along with the likes of Rev. Father Pinchon and A. H. Anderson. Articles of Bullbrook's have been published in magazines with a varying range of readers such as ''The Caribbean'', ''Caribbean Quarterly'', and ''Shell Magazine''.&lt;ref name="Mid60"/&gt;{{rp|p.1}}

He later became [[curator]] of the Royal Victoria Institute (now the [[National Museum and Art Gallery, Trinidad|National Museum]]), and died at the age of 85 (in 1967).

John Bullbrook (who was the first to use modern stratigraphic techniques in Trinidad), having been educated in Great Britain, had previous field experience in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. His techniques represent a significant advance over the ‘[[Museology|museological]]’ approach that characterized the work of [[Jesse Walter Fewkes|Fewkes (1850–1930)]] and [[Theodoor de Booy|de Booy (1882–1919)]].&lt;ref name="Fig74"/&gt;

His collection of correspondence with [[Yale University]] (1941–1963), with a variety of people on the subject of archaeology in the West Indies (1917–1960), with the Historical Society of Trinidad and Tobago (1939–1949); and correspondence with the Trinidad and Tobago Field Naturalists Club, have all been donated to the [[University of the West Indies]] by Carlisle Chang (in October 2000).

Bullbrook was [[homosexual]], but was [[lavender marriage|married]] to the lesbian painter [[Amy Leong Pang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.tt/lifestyle/2013-01-15/will-you-be-my-beard|title=Will you be my beard?|work=The Trinidad Guardian Newspaper|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.''''', 801 [[F.3d]] 1126 (2015), is a decision by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], affirming the ruling in 2008 of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|US District Court for the Northern District of California]], holding that [[copyright]] holders must consider [[fair use]] in good faith before issuing a [[Notice and take down|takedown notice]] for content posted on the Internet.&lt;ref name=Lenz9th/&gt;

Stephanie Lenz posted on [[YouTube]] a home video of her child dancing to [[Prince (musician)|Prince's]] song "[[Let's Go Crazy]]".&lt;ref name='youtubeclip'&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1KfJHFWlhQ Let's Go Crazy YouTube video]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music Corporation]] (Universal) sent YouTube a takedown notice pursuant to the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) claiming that Lenz's video violated their copyright in the "Let's Go Crazy" song.

Lenz claimed fair use of the copyrighted material and sued Universal for misrepresentation of a DMCA claim. In a decision rejecting a motion to dismiss the misrepresentation claim, the district court held that Universal must consider fair use when filing a takedown notice, but noted that to prevail a plaintiff would need to show bad faith by a rights holder.&lt;ref name="case"&gt;''[https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/lenz_v_universal/lenzorder082008.pdf Lenz v. Universal Music Corp]'', 572 F. Supp. 2d 1150 (N.D. Cal. 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
In February 2007, Stephanie Lenz posted on YouTube a twenty nine second clip, of her 13 month old son dancing to Prince's song "Let's Go Crazy". The audio was of poor quality, and the song was audible for about twenty seconds of the twenty nine seconds.&lt;ref name=case /&gt; In June 2007, Universal, the copyright holder for "Let's Go Crazy", sent YouTube a [[takedown notice]] in compliance with DMCA requirements, claiming the video was a copyright violation.  YouTube removed the video, and notified Lenz of the removal and the alleged infringement.

In the end of June 2007, Lenz sent YouTube a [[counter-notification]], claiming fair use and requesting the video be reposted. Six weeks later, YouTube reposted the video. In July 2007, Lenz sued Universal for [[misrepresentation]] under the DMCA, and sought a declaration from the court that her use of the copyrighted song was non infringing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=512&amp;url=/uscode/html/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00000512----000-.html  17 U.S.C. § 512], see (f).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the DMCA 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)(A)(v), the copyright holder must consider whether use of the material was allowed by the copyright owner or the law.&lt;ref name="statute"&gt;[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=512&amp;url=/uscode/html/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00000512----000-.html  17 U.S.C. § 512], see (c)(3)(A)(v).&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, Prince released statements that he intended to "reclaim his art on the internet".&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, "[https://www.reuters.com/article/internetNew/idUSL1364328420070914?feedtype=RSS&amp;feedName_InternetNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true Prince to sue YouTube, eBay over music use]" (September 13, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, Universal released a statement that Prince and Universal intended to remove all [[user-generated content]] involving Prince from the Internet, as a matter of principle.&lt;ref name="case" /&gt;

==Decision==
===District court===
Based on Prince's and Universal's statements, Lenz argued that Universal was issuing takedown notices in bad faith, as they attempted to remove all Prince related content rather than considering whether each posting violated copyright, and in particular was a non infringing fair use. Universal expressed concerns over the fact-intensive investigation and subjective results of determining whether a potentially infringing use falls under the general fair use doctrine.

The district court held that copyright owners must consider [[fair use]] before issuing DMCA takedown notices. Thus, the district court denied Universal's motion to dismiss Lenz's claims, and declined to dismiss Lenz's misrepresentation claim as a matter of law. The district court believed that Universal's concerns over the burden of considering fair use were overstated, as mere good faith consideration of fair use, not necessarily an in depth investigation, is sufficient defense against misrepresentation.

The court also explained that liability for [[misrepresentation]] is crucial in an important part of the balance in the DMCA.&lt;ref name="case" /&gt; On February 25, 2010, Judge Fogel issued a ruling rejecting several of Universal's affirmative defenses, including the defense that Lenz suffered no damages, though the court did suggest that at that stage in the proceedings, Lenz's damages seemed nominal.&lt;ref&gt;"http://thepriorart.typepad.com/the_prior_art/files/Lenz.2.25.order.pdf"&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Judge Fogel denied both parties' motions for [[summary judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;''Lenz v. Universal'', [https://www.eff.org/cases/lenz-v-universal Order Denying Motions for Summary Judgment], Jan. 14. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ninth Circuit===
[[File:13-16106, 13-16107 Stephanie Lenz v. Universal Music Corp..webm|thumb|Recording of oral arguments in the appeal to the Ninth Circuit.]]
Both parties cross appealed to the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]]. [[Oral argument]] was held July 7, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/07/appeals-judges-hear-about-princes-takedown-of-dancing-baby-youtube-vid/ |title=Appeals judges hear about Prince's takedown of "Dancing Baby" YouTube vid |date=July 7, 2015 |accessdate=July 7, 2015 |first1=Joe |last1=Mullin }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 14, 2015, the 9th Circuit affirmed the District Court, holding that while fair use arises procedurally as an [[affirmative defense]], copyright holders have a "duty to consider—in good faith and prior to sending a takedown notification—whether allegedly infringing material constitutes fair use".&lt;ref name=Lenz9th&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12567649168680108221&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr ''Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.''], 801 F.3d 1126 (2015), (9th Cir. 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, the court viewed fair use not as a valid excuse to otherwise infringing conduct but rather as not infringement in the first place. "Because 17 U.S.C. § 107&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107 17 U.S.C. § 107].&lt;/ref&gt; created a type of non-infringing use, fair use is 'authorized by the law' and a copyright holder must consider the existence of fair use before sending a takedown notification under § 512(c)."&lt;ref name=Lenz9th/&gt;

Lenz appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] asking the question:

{{quote|text=Whether the Ninth Circuit erred in concluding that the affirmation of good faith belief that a given use of material use is not authorized "by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law," required under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), may be purely subjective and, therefore, that an unreasonable belief—such as a belief formed without consideration of the statutory fair use factors—will not subject the sender of a takedown notice to liability under Section 512(f) of the DMCA?&lt;ref name=LenzSupreme&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/16-217-petition-for-cert.pdf ''Petition 16-217 Lenz v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2840">[[File:83 Portrait of Frederick the Wise.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], who protected [[Martin Luther]], was a "lesser magistrate" under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]].]]
The doctrine of the '''lesser magistrate''' is a concept in [[Protestant]] thought. A lesser magistrate is a ruler such as a prince who is under a greater ruler such as an emperor. According to many figures of the Reformation and Post-Reformation eras, the lesser magistrate has the authority to rebel against the tyranny of a supreme ruler.

The doctrine of the lesser magistrate finds its origin in [[John Calvin]], who wrote that whereas private Christians must submit to the ruling authorities, there are "popular magistrates" who have "been appointed to curb the tyranny of kings". When these magistrates "connive at kings when they tyrannise and insult over the humbler of the people" they "fraudulently betray the liberty of the people" when God has appointed them guardians of that liberty.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Calvin]], ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.vi.xxi.html IV.xx.31].&lt;/ref&gt;

The lesser magistrate is prominent in the [[Lutheran]] ''[[Magdeburg Confession]]'' of 1550, which argued that the "subordinate powers" in a state, faced with the situation where the "supreme power" is working to destroy true religion, may go further than non-cooperation with the supreme power and assist the faithful to resist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wernham|first1=R. B.|title=Counter-Reformation and Price Revolution, 1559-1610|date=1968|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of the lesser magistrate became important for the justification of the [[Dutch Revolt]]. According to [[Johannes Althusius]] in 1603 work, ''Politica'', resistance to a supreme magistrate by lesser magistrates is justified in the case of tyranny. Althusius argued that the provincial authorities of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] were in this situation.&lt;ref&gt;R. von Friedeburg, "Althusius," in ''Dictionary of Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century Dutch Philosophers'', ed. W. van Bunge (Bristol, 2003), 11–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary M. Simpson suggests that after the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] in 1572 there was a "populist expansion" of the doctrine in which "the ruled would no longer be merely the subject of the ruler; they would become citizens."&lt;ref&gt;Gary M. Simpson, "Toward a Lutheran "Delight in the Law of the Lord": Church and State in the Context of Civil Society," in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fn6CgUOOriUC&amp;pg=PA43 Church &amp; State: Lutheran Perspectives]'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Insolvency}}
In [[law]], a '''liquidator''' is the officer appointed when a [[company (law)|company]] goes into winding-up or [[liquidation]] who has responsibility for collecting in all of the assets under such circumstances of the company and settling all claims against the company before putting the company into [[dissolution (law)|dissolution]].

==Origins==

In [[United Kingdom insolvency law|English law]], the term "liquidator" was first used in the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1856]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=B.H. McPherson|title=The Law of Company Liquidation|edition=5th|year=2001|at=para 8.02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that time, the equivalent role was fulfilled by "official managers" pursuant to the amendments to the [[Joint Stock Companies Winding-Up Act 1844]] passed in 1848 - 1849.

==Powers==
In most jurisdictions, a liquidator's powers are defined by statute.&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, they are set in Schedule 4 to the Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt;  Certain powers are generally exercisable without the requirement of any approvals; others may require sanction, either by the court, by an [[extraordinary resolution]] (in a members' voluntary winding up) or the liquidation committee or a meeting of the company's creditors (in a creditors' voluntary winding-up).&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see sections 165-168 of the Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

The liquidator would normally require sanction to pay [[creditor]]s and to make compromises or arrangement with creditors. Without sanction (unless it is a compulsory winding-up), the liquidator may carry on legal proceedings and carry on the business of the company so far as may be necessary for a beneficial winding-up. Without sanction, the liquidator may, ''[[inter alia]]'', sell company property, claim against insolvent contributories, raise money on the security of company assets, and do all such things as may be necessary for the winding-up and distribution of assets.

==Duties==
In compulsory liquidation, the liquidator must assume control of all property to which the company appears to be entitled.&lt;ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, see section 144 of the Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt; The exercise of their powers is subject to the supervision of the court. They may be compelled to call a meeting of creditors or contributories when requested to do so by those holding above the statutory minimum.&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, one-tenth of the total value. See section 168 of the Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

In a voluntary winding-up, the liquidator may exercise the court's power of settling a list of contributories and of making calls, and he may summon [[general meeting]]s of the company for any purpose he thinks fit.&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see section 165 of the Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt;  In a creditor's voluntary winding-up, he must report to the creditor's meeting on the exercise of his powers.&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see section 166 of the Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

The liquidator is generally obliged to make returns and accounts,&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see section 170 of the Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt; owes [[fiduciary duty|fiduciary duties]] to the company and should investigate the causes of the company's failure and the conduct of its managers, in the wider public interest of action being taken against those engaged in commercially culpable conduct.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Pantmaenog'' [2004] 1 AC 158&lt;/ref&gt;

A liquidator who is appointed to wind-up a failing business should act with professional efficiency and not exercise the sort of complacency that might have caused the business to decline in the first place.

==Misconduct==
Where, during the investigation of the affairs of the company, the liquidator uncovers wrongdoing on the part of the management of the company, he may have power to bring proceedings for [[wrongful trading]] or, in extreme cases, for [[fraudulent trading]].

However, the liquidator cannot normally enter into a [[champerty|champertous]] agreement to assign the fruits of an action to a third party offering to finance the litigation, if the right to said action accrued solely as a result of the liquidator's statutory duties, instead of being a right to action that had existed before the liquidator came on the scene.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Oasis Merchandising'' [1998] 1 Ch 170&lt;/ref&gt;

The liquidator may also seek to set aside transactions which were entered into by the company in the time immediately preceding the company going into liquidation where he forms the view that they constitute an [[unfair preference]] or a [[undervalue transaction|transaction at an undervalue]].

==Removal==
Depending upon the type of the liquidation, the liquidator may be removed by the court, by a general meeting of the members or by a general meeting of the creditors.&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see sections 171-172 of the Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

The court may also remove a liquidator and appoint another if there is "cause shown" by the applicant for his removal. It is not normally necessary to demonstrate personal misconduct or unfitness for this purpose. However, it will be enough if the liquidator fails to display sufficient vigour in the discharge of his duties, for instance, by not establishing the current assets and recent trading of the company or in not attempting to secure favourable terms for the company in relation to the disposal of its assets.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Keypak Homecare Ltd'' [1987] BCLC 409&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Museo del Prado - Goya - Caprichos - No. 43 - El sueño de la razon produce monstruos.jpg|thumb|300px|right|No. 43, ''The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters'']]
'''''Los caprichos''''' are a set of 80 prints in [[aquatint]] and [[etching]] created by the Spanish artist [[Francisco Goya]] in 1797 and 1798, and published as an album in 1799. The prints were an artistic experiment: a medium for Goya's condemnation of the universal follies and foolishness in the Spanish society in which he lived. The criticisms are far-ranging and acidic; he speaks against the predominance of [[superstition]], the ignorance and inabilities of the various members of the ruling class, pedagogical short-comings, marital mistakes and the decline of [[rationality]]. Some of the prints have [[anticlericalism|anticlerical]] themes. Goya described the series as depicting "the innumerable foibles and follies to be found in any civilized society, and from the common prejudices and deceitful practices which custom, ignorance or self-interest have made usual".&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Linda, [http://www.worldandi.com/newhome/public/2004/february/bkpub1.asp "The Sleep of Reason"], ''The World and I''&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was an [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened]], tour-de-force critique of 18th-century Spain, and humanity in general. The informal style, as well as the depiction of contemporary society found in ''Caprichos'', makes them (and Goya himself) a precursor to the [[Modernism|modernist]] movement almost a century later. ''[[The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters]]'' in particular has attained an iconic status.

Goya added brief explanations of each image to a manuscript, now in the [[Museo del Prado]]; these help greatly to explain his often cryptic intentions, as do the titles printed below each image.

Goya's series, and the last group of prints in his series ''[[The Disasters of War]]'', which he called "caprichos enfáticos" ("emphatic caprices"), are far from the spirit of light-hearted fantasy the term "[[Capriccio (painting)|caprice]]" usually suggests in art.

==History==
''Los caprichos'' were withdrawn from public sale very shortly after their release in 1799, after only 27 copies of the set had been purchased.&lt;ref&gt;Goya, 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1803, Goya offered the ''Caprichos''' copper plates and the first edition's unsold sets to [[Charles IV of Spain|King Charles IV]]. Later in life, Goya wrote that he had felt it prudent to withdraw the prints from circulation due to the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;Boime, 264&lt;/ref&gt;

{{O.K. Corral}}

'''Morgan Seth Earp''' (April 24, 1851 – March 18, 1882)  was a [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]], [[Arizona Territory|Arizona]] Special Policeman when he helped his brothers [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]] and [[Wyatt Earp|Wyatt]] and [[Doc Holliday]] confront the [[outlaw]] [[Cochise County Cowboys]] in the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] on October 26, 1881. All three [[Earp brothers]] had been the target of repeated death threats made by the Cowboys who were upset by the Earps' interference in their illegal activities. The lawmen killed Cowboys [[Tom McLaury|Tom]] and [[Frank McLaury]] and [[Billy Clanton]]. All four lawmen were charged with murder by Billy's older brother, [[Ike Clanton]], who had run from the gunfight. During a month-long preliminary hearing, Judge [[Wells Spicer]] exonerated the men, concluding they had been performing their duty.

Friends of the slain outlaws retaliated, and on December 29, Cowboys ambushed Virgil, leaving him maimed. Two and a half months later, on March 18, 1882, they ambushed Morgan, shooting him at night through the window of a door while he was playing billiards and killed him. The Cowboys suspected in both shootings were let off on technicalities or lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=roberts&gt;{{Cite book |last1 = Roberts | first1 = Gary L. | title = Doc Holliday: The Life and Legend | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley, J | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-470-12822-0 | page = 544}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|242}}&lt;ref name="historynet"/&gt; Wyatt Earp felt he could not rely on the [[criminal justice system]] and decided to take matters into his own hands.&lt;ref name=wgbh&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/wyatt-transcript/ |title=WGBH American Experience: Wyatt Earp, Complete Program Transcript |date=January 25, 2010 |season=22 |number=2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130081133/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/wyatt-transcript/ |archivedate=January 30, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded the only way to get justice for his murdered brother was to avenge his death.&lt;ref name="historynet"/&gt; Wyatt assembled a [[wikt:posse#Noun|posse]] that included their brother [[Warren Earp]] and set out on a [[Earp Vendetta Ride|vendetta]] to kill those they felt were responsible.

Morgan married Louisa Alice Houston sometime in the 1870s. They lived in Montana before joining his brothers in Tombstone. Louisa was staying with his parents in California when Morgan was murdered.

== Early life ==
[[File:Louisa Houston Earp Peters.jpg|thumb|left|Morgan married Louisa Alice Houston in the 1870s. After Morgan's murder, she married Gustav Peters in 1885 and died in 1894 in Long Beach, California.]]

Morgan Earp was born in [[Pella, Iowa]], to [[Nicholas Porter Earp]] (1813–1907), a [[cooper (profession)|cooper]] and [[farmer]], and his second wife Virginia Ann Cooksey (1821–1893).

=== Brothers' Service in Civil War and Later ===

When elder brothers [[Newton Earp|Newton]], [[James Earp|James]], and [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]] went off to the [[American Civil War]], they left their young teenage brothers Wyatt and Morgan to tend the family farm.  James and Morgan grew up close, with a shared wish for adventure and a dislike of farming. Before adulthood, teen-aged Morgan followed James Earp to Montana for a couple of years. Later he was with Wyatt on the [[Old West|Western frontier]].

In spring 1868, his father [[Nicholas Porter Earp]] and his siblings Ginnie, Warren, and Adelia returned to the mid-west and Lamar, Missouri, where Nick became the local constable.&lt;ref name=historynetvirgil&gt;{{cite web|title=Frontier Lawman Virgil Earp|url=http://www.historynet.com/frontier-lawman-virgil-earp.htm|date=June 12, 2006|accessdate=May 9, 2011 |first1=Jan S. |last1=Paul |first2=Gene |last2=Carlisle |work=Wild West}}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 17, 1869, Nick resigned to become Justice of the Peace. Wyatt, who had followed them to Missouri, was appointed constable in place of his father.&lt;ref&gt;Barra, Allen (1998) [https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/barra-earp.html Inventing Wyatt Earp His Life and Many Legends] ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1870, Wyatt married Urilla Sutherland, but she died later that year shortly before she was due to have a baby. Shortly afterward, Wyatt, James, Virgil and Morgan got into what witnesses described as a “20-minute street fight” with Urilla’s brothers and other relatives over the alleged bootlegging activities of both families.&lt;ref name="silva"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Silva |first1=Lee |title=The Mysterious Morgan Earp {{!}} HistoryNet |url=http://www.historynet.com/mysterious-morgan-earp.htm |website=www.historynet.com |accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime between 1871 and 1877 Morgan met Louisa Alice Houston, the daughter of H. Samuel Houston and Elizabeth Waughtal. Louisa (born January 24, 1855) was the second eldest of 12 children.

In 1875, Morgan left [[Wichita, Kansas]] and became a deputy marshal under [[Charlie Bassett]] at [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]].

=== Move to Butte, Montana ===

In late 1877, Morgan and Louisa moved to [[Miles City, Montana]], where they bought a home. Shortly after Wyatt and Virgil headed for Tombstone, Arizona, Morgan and Louisa sold their home in Montana and headed west. Morgan apparently didn't think the wild mining town of Tombstone was suitable for Louisa, who was a petite woman and suffered from [[rheumatoid arthritis]]. He took her instead to stay with his parents in [[Colton, California]], in March 1880. Morgan set out to meet his older brothers in Tombstone on July 20, 1880. Louisa followed him in early December.&lt;ref name="monahan"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monahan|first1=Sherry|title=The Dedicated Women Behind the Earp Men|url=http://www.truewestmagazine.com/the-dedicated-women-behind-the-earp-men/|publisher=True West magazine|accessdate=1 March 2016|date=January 6, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227123814/http://www.truewestmagazine.com/the-dedicated-women-behind-the-earp-men/|archivedate=27 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, the July 25 ''Daily Pioneer'' reported that Morgan had joined prospectors pursuing gold in the Bear Paw mountains on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in northern Montana Territory, "Mr. Morgan Earpt{{sic}} arrived last evening from the Tongue River, which he left about three weeks ago."  General John Gibbon had brought troops to the Teton River to keep prospectors from being "slaughtered by Indians." Morgan remained in Montana for an unknown amount of time. On December 16, 1879, he was selected as a policeman in [[Butte, Montana]]. A story has circulated that Morgan and [[William L. Brooks|Billy Brooks]] competed for the job of policeman. During a confrontation over the job, they got in a gunfight. Some accounts say Earp killed Brooks, and that Earp was wounded. But other accounts report that Brooks later died at the hands of a lynch mob, but no contemporary documentation of the shootout has been found. Morgan served for only three months, until March 10, 1880.&lt;ref name="silva"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Legendary Lawman Morgan Earp |url=https://www.officer.com/on-the-street/body-armor-protection/article/10369152/legendary-lawman-morgan-earp |website=Officer |accessdate=9 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rosa |first1=Joseph G. |title=The Gunfighter: Man Or Myth? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Um4KRtIutecC |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |accessdate=9 June 2018 |page=108 |language=en |date=1 October 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrival in Tombstone, Arizona Territory ===


At different times in [[Arizona]], both Wyatt and Morgan worked as [[shotgun messenger]]s for [[Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo &amp; Co.]], deputy sheriffs for [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]], and as deputies under Tombstone's town Marshal, Virgil Earp, their older brother. During December 1881, Wyatt was appointed by U.S. Marshal Crawley Drake to the federal position of [[United States Marshals Service|deputy U.S. marshal]] after Virgil was wounded and Morgan was a field-commissioned deputy for Wyatt.

Morgan gained a modern reputation as a hot-tempered man, but this appears to be based on incidents described in the book ''The Earp Brothers of Tombstone'' purportedly written by Virgil Earp's wife Allie.  However, the incidents in the book involving Morgan, like much else in the book, are almost certainly fabricated.&lt;ref name=barra1998/&gt;  From the rest of what is known of Morgan's life, he normally showed the same even temper and cool reactions to danger as did his brothers.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Gunfight at the OK Corral ==

{{main article|Gunfight at the O.K. Corral}}
On Wednesday, October 26, 1881, the tension between the Earps and the Cowboys came to a head. Ike Clanton, Billy Claiborne, and other Cowboys had been threatening to kill the Earps for several weeks. Tombstone town Marshal Virgil Earp learned that the Cowboys were armed in violation of a city ordinance and had gathered near the O.K. Corral. Morgan was a deputy to his brother Virgil and on October 26, 1881, responded with Virgil and Wyatt to reports that Cowboys were armed on the streets of Tombstone. [[Ike Clanton]] had repeatedly threatened the Earps and he was backed up by [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboys]] [[Tom McLaury]], [[Frank McLaury]], and [[Billy Clanton]].  Virgil asked Wyatt and Morgan and Doc Holliday to assist him, as he intended to disarm them. At approximately 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. the Earps headed towards Fremont Street where the Cowboys had been reported to be gathering.&lt;ref name=lindenchron&gt;{{cite web|last=Linder|first=Douglas|title=The Earp Trial: A Chronology|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/earp/earpchronology.html|work=Famous Trials|year=2005|accessdate=17 May 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816194624/http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/earp/earpchronology.html|archivedate=16 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They confronted five Cowboys on Fremont Street in an alley between the Harwood House and Fly's Boarding House and Photography Studio, the two parties were initially only about {{convert|6|to|10|ft}} apart. Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne fled the gunfight. Tom and Frank McLaury, along with Billy Clanton, were killed. Morgan was clipped by a shot across his back that nicked both shoulder blades and a vertebra, although he was able to continue firing his weapon. Virgil was shot through the calf and Holliday was grazed by a bullet.&lt;ref name=lindenchron/&gt;

== Assassination ==
[[File:Historic Longhorn Restaurant.jpg|thumb|The Longhorn Restaurant is located where the building housing Huachuca Water Company, and the Owl Cafe and Hotel used to stand. Virgil Earp was shot from the second floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bignosekates.info/longhorn.html |title=The Longhorn Restaurant - Tombstone, Arizona - Great Family Dining |publisher=Bignosekates.info |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102131835/http://www.bignosekates.info/longhorn.html |archivedate=November 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Two months after the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, in December 1881, Virgil Earp was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt that left him with a permanently crippled left arm. By February 1882, Morgan grew wary of the danger to the Earps in Tombstone and sent Louisa  to live with his parents in [[Colton, California|Colton]], [[California]]. Morgan remained in Tombstone to support his brothers.

=== Ambush and murder ===
{{wikisource|The Deadly Bullet}}
At 10:50&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Saturday, March 18, 1882, after returning from a [[musical theater|musical]] at [[Schieffelin Hall]], Morgan was ambushed. He was playing a late round of [[pool (game)|billiards]] at the Campbell &amp; Hatch Billiard Parlor against owner Bob Hatch. Dan Tipton, Sherman McMaster, and Wyatt watched, having received threats that same day.&lt;ref name=dodge&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Dodge|first1=Fred|last2=Lake|first2=Carolyn|title=Under Cover for Wells Fargo The Unvarnished Recollections of Fred Dodge|year=1999|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman, Oklahoma|isbn=978-0-8061-3106-1|page=336|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4n8-tmFvI7wC&amp;pg=PA38|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425224649/https://books.google.com/books?id=4n8-tmFvI7wC&amp;pg=PA38|archivedate=2016-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38}}

The assailant shot Morgan through the upper half of a four-pane windowed door. The bottom two windows had been painted over. The door opened onto a dark alley that ran through the block between Allen and Fremont Streets.  Morgan, about {{convert|10|ft}} from the door, was struck by a bullet in the back which injured his spine then exited his front and entered the thigh of mining foreman George A. B. Berry.&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Paul Lee|title=The McLaurys in Tombstone, Arizona : an O. K.

After Morgan was shot, his brothers tried to help him stand, but Morgan said "Don't, I can't stand it. This is the last game of pool I'll ever play."&lt;ref name="O'Neal"&gt;{{cite book| title=Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters  |isbn=978-0-8061-2335-6 |first=Bill |last=O'Neal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|97}} They moved him to the floor near the card room door. Dr. William Miller arrived first, followed by Drs. Matthews and [[George E. Goodfellow|George Goodfellow]]. They all examined Morgan. Goodfellow, who would earn recognition in the United States as the nation's leading expert at treating abdominal gunshot wounds,&lt;ref name=oldwest&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. George E.

Goodfellow described Morgan's wounds:

{{quote|He was in a state of collapse resulting from a gunshot, or pistol wound, entering the body just to the left of the spinal column in the region of the left kidney emerging on the right side of the body in the region of the gall bladder. It certainly injured the great vessels of the body causing hemorrhage which, undoubtedly, causes death. It also involved the spinal column.

In the book ''[[Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal]]'', author [[Stuart N.

=== Burial ===

After his death, Morgan was laid out in a blue suit belonging to Doc Holliday. Wyatt learned that Frank Stilwell and others were waiting for them in Tucson, and assembled several deputies who guarded Virgil, Addie, and James. The Earps took Morgan's body by wagon the next day to Benson, where they hired a wagon to get to the New Mexico and Arizona railroad station in [[Contention City, Arizona|Contention]]. From Contention, they caught a train to Tucson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contention City and It's Mills|url=http://www.wyattearpexplorers.com/contention-city-and-its-mills.html|publisher=Wyatt Earp Explorers|accessdate=27 May 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529010246/http://www.wyattearpexplorers.com/contention-city-and-its-mills.html|archivedate=29 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While waiting for the next train in Tucson, they saw Stilwell apparently lying in wait and killed him. From Tucson, James accompanied Virgil, Addie, and Morgan's body to [[Colton, California]] where Morgan's wife and parents were waiting. Morgan was first buried in the old city cemetery of Colton, near [[Mount Slover]]. When the cemetery was moved in 1892, Morgan's body was reburied in the [[Colton, California#Cemeteries|Hermosa Cemetery]] in Colton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|2733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

While Wyatt and James were traveling to Contention with Morgan's body, Coroner Dr. D. M. Mathew organized a Coroner's Jury to conduct an inquest into Morgan's death.

=== Wyatt seeks personal justice ===

{{main article|Earp Vendetta Ride}}

Wyatt Earp finally concluded that he could not rely on the court system for justice and decided to take matters into his own hands.&lt;ref name="wgbh"/&gt; He concluded that only way to deal with Virgil's shooters and Morgan's murderers was to [[Earp Vendetta Ride|find and kill]] the Cowboys he believed were responsible. He gathered a band of loyal men and deputized them. They rode out to find those responsible.&lt;ref name="historynet"/&gt;

=== Accused go free ===

When the prosecution called Marietta Duarte to testify at the preliminary hearing, the defense objected because her testimony was [[hearsay]] and because a spouse could not testify against her husband.&lt;ref name="historynet"/&gt; The judge agreed and the charges were dismissed.

=== Cowboys in jail ===

Unknown to Wyatt, three of the Cowboys he sought were in Behan's jail. After the Coroner's Jury ended, Spence immediately turned himself in, protected in [[Johnny Behan|Behan]]'s jail. On the day of the inquest, two of Behan's deputy sheriffs arrested two of the suspects for other reasons. Cochise County Deputy Sheriff William Bell brought Indian Charlie from Charleston and placed him under arrest in the Tombstone jail for shooting a man in Charleston. Separately, Cochise County Deputy Sheriff Frank Hereford arrested "John Doe" Freeze{{sic}}&lt;!-- as in original--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015133/1882-03-26/ed-1/seq-2/#date1=1836&amp;index=0&amp;date2=1922&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Bode+Frederick&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;state=Arizona&amp;rows=20&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=Frederick+Bode&amp;phrasetext=&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1|title=Arizona weekly citizen.

While accompanying his brother Virgil to the rail head in Tucson, Wyatt spotted [[Frank Stilwell]] lying in wait. He was a suspect in Morgan's assassination. Wyatt and others pursued Stilwell and killed him. Earp then assembled and deputized a federal posse. They set out to track down others they believed responsible for shooting Virgil and killing Morgan. During the [[Earp Vendetta Ride]], the federal posse looked for Pete Spence but found he was already in jail. They killed Florentino "Indian Charlie" Cruz, who had been identified by Pete Spence's wife as taking part in ambushing Virgil. They also accidentally came upon [[Curly Bill|Curly Bill Brocius]] at a spring and Wyatt killed him with a single shotgun blast. Wyatt shot Johnny Barnes in the same gunfight and he died soon after.&lt;ref name=heritagebarra&gt;{{cite web|last=Barra|first=Alan|title=Who Was Wyatt Earp?|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/who-was-wyatt-earp?page=show|publisher=American Heritage|accessdate=21 June 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507101535/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1998/8/1998_8_76.shtml|archivedate=7 May 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shootout&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://truewestmagazine.com/shoot-out-at-cottonwood-springs/|title=Shoot-Out at Cottonwood Springs?|date=2009-05-01|work=True West Magazine|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historynet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/wyatt-earps-vendetta-posse.htm/1|title=Wyatt Earp's Vendetta Posse|date=January 29, 2007|accessdate=February 18, 2011|publisher=Wild West|first1=Peter|last1=Brand|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005161307/http://www.historynet.com/wyatt-earps-vendetta-posse.htm/1|archivedate=October 5, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5827">'''Neolithic ashmounds''' (sometimes termed as cinder mounds&lt;ref name=sewell /&gt;) are man-made landscape features found in some parts of southern India (chiefly around [[Bellary]]) that have been dated to the [[Neolithic]] period (3000 to 1200 BC). They have been a puzzle for long and have been the subject of many conjectures and scientific studies. They are believed to be of ritual significance and produced by early pastoral and agricultural communities by the burning of dung and animal matter. More than a 100 ashmound sites have been identified and many have a low perimeter embankment and some have holes that may have held posts.&lt;ref name=review /&gt;

These ashmounds were traditionally given mythological explanations as the burnt remains of [[rakshasa]]s described in epics like the ''Mahabharata''. A scientific explanation was first attempted by T. J. Newbold who sent notes on Būdigunta, one of the largest such mounds, to [[James Prinsep]] who published it in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1836. Newbold suggested that these were volcanic [[scoria]]e as the masses had a glassy surface and gave a hollow sound when struck. He was initially of the opinion that it appeared as if of volcanic origin although lacking any other evidence for it. He also pointed out that furnaces around the country did not produce such scoriae or slag. Newbold also pointed to [[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton|Buchanan Hamilton]]'s notes on the Rajmahal hills where he had described calcareous remains that the locals referred to as ''asurhar'' or giant's bones. Cavelly Venkata Lachmia (one of [[Colin Mackenzie]]'s fellow researchers and president of the Madras Hindu Literary Society) wrote to Newbold that he had gathered theories these were remains of religious sacrifices made in the past or from funerals of past battles. Lachmia also pointed out that he had seen many other places around Mysore and many of these other places like Budihal and Buditippa had the prefix ''būdi'' referring to "ash".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Newbold, T.J.|url=https://archive.org/stream/journalofasiatic05asia#page/670/mode/2up|title=Note on the occurrence of volcanic scoria in the southern Peninsula|year=1836|pages=670–671|volume=5|journal=Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Budigunta near Bellary was said to be the largest and recorded as being 46 feet in height and 420 feet in circumference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Newbold, T.J.|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain &amp; Ireland|year=1843|volume=7|issue=13|pages=129–136|url= https://archive.org/stream/jstor-25207575/25207575#page/n1/mode/2up|doi=10.1017/S0035869X00155753|title= On some ancient mounds of scorious ashes in southern India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Sewell conjectured that the region was once densely forested and considered several possible explanations including furnaces. He also had the material examined and it was declared that it could not have come from furnaces or brick kilns. The burning of animal matter was considered as one possible source. He also pointed out that these could have been the result of large pyres where the wives of kings committed ''[[Sati (practice)|sati]]''.&lt;ref name=sewell&gt;{{cite journal|title=The cinder-mounds of Bellary|author=Sewell, R.|year=1899|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society|url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_J_gAAAAAYAAJ#page/n17/mode/2up|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Bruce Foote]] examined Budikanama in 1872 and suggested that these mounds were produced by burning dung and suggested a similarity to zaribas in Africa. Around the same time two amateur archaeologists dug a mound in Kupgal and found bones, pottery, stone axes and other artefacts. Allchin in 1963 made an analysis of all the theories and pointed out that rainfall was higher in the region during the Neolithic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Neolithic Cattle-keepers of South India: A Study of the Deccan Ashmounds|author=Allchin, Frank Raymond|year=1963|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological studies have continued into recent times. Some of the plant remains have been identified and millet cultivation may have been important. Two staple millets ''Brachiaria ramosa'' and ''Setaria verticillata'' which are not common in modern cultivation were found in several sites while the commonest legumes were ''[[Vigna radiata]]'' and ''[[Macrotyloma uniflorum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Dung Mounds and Domesticators: Early Cultivation and Pastoralism in Karnataka|author=Fuller, Dorian Q.|pages=117–127|url=http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~tcrndfu/articles/EASAA2001a.pdf|title=South Asian Archaeology.

There is no single dialect that is considered the most prestigious or most prominent, and no standard writing system that covers all dialects.

Dialects of Ojibwemowin are spoken in [[Canada]], from southwestern [[Quebec]], through [[Ontario]], [[Manitoba]] and parts of [[Saskatchewan]], with outlying communities in [[Alberta]];&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nichols, John, 1980, pp. 1-2"&gt;Nichols, John, 1980, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[United States]], from [[Michigan]] to [[Wisconsin]] and [[Minnesota]], with a number of communities in [[North Dakota]] and [[Montana]], as well as groups that removed to [[Kansas]] and [[Oklahoma]] during the [[Indian Removal Act|Indian Removal period]].&lt;ref name="Nichols, John, 1980, pp. 1-2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Richard, and Evelyn Todd, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; While there is some variation in the classification of its dialects, at least the following are recognized, from east to west: [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]], [[Eastern Ojibwa language|Eastern Ojibwe]], [[Ottawa dialect|Ottawa (Odawa)]], [[Western Ojibwa language|Western Ojibwe (Saulteaux)]], [[Oji-Cree language|Oji-Cree (Severn Ojibwe)]], [[Northwestern Ojibwa|Northwestern Ojibwe]], and [[Chippewa language|Southwestern Ojibwe (Chippewa)]]. Based upon contemporary field research, J. R. Valentine also recognizes several other dialects: Berens Ojibwe in northwestern Ontario, which he distinguishes from Northwestern Ojibwe; North of (Lake) Superior; and Nipissing. The latter two cover approximately the same territory as [[Central Ojibwa language|Central Ojibwa]], which he does not recognize.&lt;ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph 1994, p. 456"&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt;

The aggregated dialects of Ojibwemowin comprise the second most commonly spoken [[First Nations]] language in [[Canada]] (after [[Cree language|Cree]]),&lt;ref name="census"&gt;{{cite web|title=Various Languages Spoken (147), Age Groups (17A) and Sex (3) for the Population of Canada, Provinces, Territories, Census Metropolitan Areas and Census Agglomerations, 2006 Census - 20% Sample Data|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/tbt/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&amp;APATH=3&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=0&amp;FL=A&amp;FREE=0&amp;GC=0&amp;GID=837928&amp;GK=0&amp;GRP=1&amp;PID=89189&amp;PRID=0&amp;PTYPE=88971,97154&amp;S=0&amp;SHOWALL=0&amp;SUB=0&amp;Temporal=2006&amp;THEME=70&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=|website=Statistics Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fourth most widely spoken in the [[United States]] or [[Canada]] behind [[Navajo language|Navajo]], the [[Inuit languages]] and Cree.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Ojibwemowin is a relatively healthy indigenous language. The Waadookodaading Ojibwe Language Immersion School teaches all classes to children in Ojibwe only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waadookodading: Ojibwe Language Immersion School|url=http://theways.org/story/waadookodaading|website=theways.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The Algonquian language family of which Ojibwemowin is a member is itself a member of the [[Algic languages|Algic]] language family, other Algic languages being [[Wiyot language|Wiyot]] and [[Yurok language|Yurok]].&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1979"/&gt; Ojibwe is sometimes described as a [[Central Algonquian languages|Central Algonquian]] language, along with [[Fox language|Fox]], [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Menominee language|Menominee]], [[Miami-Illinois language|Miami-Illinois]], [[Potawatomi language|Potawatomi]], and [[Shawnee language|Shawnee]].&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1979"/&gt; Central Algonquian is a geographical term of convenience rather than a [[Historical linguistics|genetic subgroup]], and its use does not indicate that the Central languages are more closely related to each other than to the other Algonquian languages.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978; Goddard, Ives, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exonyms and endonyms===
The most general Indigenous [[Exonym and endonym|designation]] for the language is ''Anishinaabemowin'' 'speaking the native language' (''Anishinaabe'' 'native person,' verb suffix ''–mo'' 'speak a language,' suffix ''–win'' 'nominalizer'),&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, John and Earl Nyholm, 1995, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; with varying spellings and pronunciations depending upon dialect. Some speakers use the term ''Ojibwemowin''.&lt;ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph 1994, p. 1"&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, p. 1, Fn. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, John and Earl Nyholm, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The general term in Oji-Cree (Severn Ojibwe) is ''Anihshininiimowin'', although ''Anishinaabemowin'' is widely recognized by Severn speakers.&lt;ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph 1994, p. 1"/&gt; Some speakers of [[Western Ojibwa language|Saulteaux Ojibwe]] refer to their language as ''Nakawemowin''.&lt;ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph 1994, p. 1"/&gt; The [[Ottawa dialect]] is sometimes referred to as ''Daawaamwin,''&lt;ref&gt;Baraga, Frederic, 1878, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; although the general designation is ''Nishnaabemwin'', with the latter term also applied to ''Jibwemwin'' or [[Eastern Ojibwa language|Eastern Ojibwe]].&lt;ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001"&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Other local terms are listed in [[Ojibwe dialects]]. English terms include ''Ojibwe,'' with variants including ''Ojibwa'' and ''Ojibway''.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The related term ''Chippewa'' is more commonly employed in the United States and in southwestern Ontario among descendants of Ojibwe migrants from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Potawatomi===
Ojibwe and [[Potawatomi language|Potawatomi]] are frequently viewed as being more closely related to each other than to other Algonquian languages.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978, pp. 585–586; Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, pp. 100–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Ojibwe and Potawatomi have been proposed as likely candidates for forming a genetic subgroup within Proto-Algonquian, although the required research to ascertain the linguistic history and status of a hypothetical "Ojibwe–Potawatomi" subgroup has not yet been undertaken. A discussion of Algonquian family subgroups indicates that "Ojibwe–Potawatomi is another possibility that awaits investigation."&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1979, p. 95"&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1979, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; In a proposed consensus classification of Algonquian languages, Goddard (1996) classifies Ojibwa and Potawatomi as "Ojibwayan," although no supporting evidence is adduced.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1996, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Central languages share a significant number of common features. These features can generally attributed to [[Sprachbund|diffusion]] of features through borrowing: "Extensive lexical, phonological, and perhaps grammatical borrowing—the diffusion of elements and features across language boundaries—appears to have been the major factor in giving the languages in the area of the Upper Great Lakes their generally similar cast, and it has not been possible to find any shared innovations substantial enough to require the postulation of a genetically distinct Central Algonquian subgroup."&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1979, p. 95"/&gt;

The possibility that the proposed genetic subgrouping of Ojibwa and Potawatomi can also be accounted for as diffusion has also been raised: "The putative Ojibwa–Potawatomi subgroup is similarly open to question, but cannot be evaluated without more information on Potawatomi dialects."&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1979, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
[[File:Ojibwe Language Map.png|thumb|left|Pre-contact distribution of the Plains Ojibwe, Southwestern Ojibwe (Chippewa), and Algonquin dialects of the Ojibwe language]]
Ojibwe communities are found in [[Canada]] from southwestern [[Quebec]], through [[Ontario]], southern [[Manitoba]] and parts of southern [[Saskatchewan]]; and in the [[United States]] from northern [[Michigan]] through northern [[Wisconsin]] and northern [[Minnesota]], with a number of communities in northern [[North Dakota]] and northern [[Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Richard, and Evelyn Todd, 1981, p. 54, Fig. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Groups of speakers of the Ottawa dialect migrated to [[Kansas]] and [[Oklahoma]] during the historical period, with a small amount of linguistic documentation of the language in Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;Feest, J. and Feest, C., 1978; Dawes, Charles, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of Ojibwe in [[British Columbia]] has been noted.&lt;ref name="Nichols, John, 1980, pp. 1-2"/&gt;

Current census data indicate that all varieties of Ojibwe are spoken by approximately 56,531 people. This figure reflects census data from the [[2000 United States Census|2000 United States census]] and the [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 Canadian census]]. The Ojibwe language is reported as spoken by a total of 8,791 people in the United States&lt;ref name="USEF"&gt;[http://www.usefoundation.org/userdata/file/Research/Languages/ojibwa.pdf U.S. English Foundation: Ojibwa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129055420/http://usefoundation.org/userdata/file/Research/Languages/ojibwa.pdf |date=2010-11-29 }}.

===Dialects===
[[File:Battle of the Thames Ojibwe plaque.jpg|thumb|right|Ontario Heritage Plaque in Ojibwe at the [[Battle of the Thames]] historical site]]
{{Main article|Ojibwe dialects}}
Because the dialects of Ojibwe are at least partly mutually intelligible, Ojibwe is usually considered to be a single language with a number of dialects, i.e. Ojibwe is "...&amp;nbsp;conventionally regarded as a single language consisting of a [[Dialect continuum|continuum]] of dialectal varieties since&amp;nbsp;... every dialect is at least partly intelligible to the speakers of the neighboring dialects."&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Richard, and Evelyn Todd, 1981, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of mutually intelligibility between nonadjacent dialects varies considerably; recent research has shown that there is strong differentiation between the Ottawa dialect spoken in southern Ontario and northern Michigan; the Severn Ojibwa dialect spoken in northern Ontario and Manitoba; and the Algonquin dialect spoken in southwestern Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Valentine notes that isolation is the most plausible explanation for the distinctive linguistic features found in these three dialects.&lt;ref name="J. Randolph Valentine 1994, p. 43-44"&gt;J. Randolph Valentine, 1994, pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Many communities adjacent to these relatively sharply differentiated dialects show a mix of transitional features, reflecting overlap with other nearby dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; While each of these dialects has undergone innovations that make them distinctive, their status as part of the Ojibwe language complex is not in dispute.&lt;ref name="J. Randolph Valentine 1994, p. 43-44"/&gt; The relatively low degrees of mutual intelligibility between some nonadjacent Ojibwe dialects led Rhodes and Todd to suggest that Ojibwe should be analyzed as a linguistic subgroup consisting of several languages.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Richard and E. Todd, 1981, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is some variation in the classification of Ojibwe dialects, at a minimum the following are recognized, proceeding west to east: [[Western Ojibwa language|Western Ojibwe (Saulteaux)]], [[Chippewa language|Southwestern Ojibwe (Chippewa)]], [[Northwestern Ojibwa language|Northwestern Ojibwe]], [[Anishinini language|Severn Ojibwe (Oji-Cree)]], [[Ottawa language|Ottawa (Odawa)]], [[Eastern Ojibwa language|Eastern Ojibwe]], and [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]]. Based upon contemporary field research, Valentine also recognizes several other dialects: Berens Ojibwe in northwestern Ontario, which he distinguishes from Northwestern Ojibwe; North of (Lake) Superior; and Nipissing. The latter two cover approximately the same territory as [[Central Ojibwa language|Central Ojibwa]], which he does not recognize.&lt;ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph 1994, p. 456"/&gt;

Two recent analyses of the relationships between the Ojibwe dialects are in agreement on the assignment of the strongly differentiated Ottawa dialect to a separate subgroup, and the assignment of Severn Ojibwe and Algonquin to another subgroup, and differ primarily with respect to the relationships between the less strongly differentiated dialects. Rhodes and Todd recognize several different dialectal subgroupings within Ojibwe: (a) Ottawa; (b) Severn and Algonquian; (c) a third subgroup which is further divided into (i) a subgrouping of Northwestern Ojibwe and [[Saulteaux]], and a subgrouping consisting of Eastern Ojibwe and a further subgrouping comprising Southwestern Ojibwe and Central Ojibwe.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Richard and E. Todd, 1981, p. 61, Fig. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Valentine has proposed that Ojibwe dialects are divided into three groups: a northern tier consisting of Severn Ojibwe and Algonquin; a southern tier consisting of "Odawa, Chippewa, Eastern Ojibwe, the Ojibwe of the Border Lakes region between Minnesota and Ontario, and Saulteaux; and third, a transitional zone between these two polar groups, in which there is a mixture of northern and southern features."&lt;ref&gt;J. Randolph Valentine, 1994, pp. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Lingua franca''===
[[File:Lakehead University Which-Way Sign.jpg|upright=1.36|thumb|A sign at [[Lakehead University]] in English and Ojibwe.]]
Several different Ojibwe dialects have functioned as ''[[lingua franca]]'' or trade languages in the circum-[[Great Lakes]] area, particularly in interactions with speakers of other Algonquian languages.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Richard, 1982, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Documentation of such usage dates from the 18th and 19th centuries, but earlier use is likely, with reports as early as 1703 suggesting that Ojibwe was used by different groups from the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] to [[Lake Winnipeg]], and from as far south as [[Ohio]] to [[Hudson Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, Peter and Anthony Grant, 1996, p. 1117.&lt;/ref&gt;

A trade language is "...&amp;nbsp;a language customarily used for communication between speakers of different languages, even though it may be that neither speaker has the trade language as his dominant language&amp;nbsp;..." although "...&amp;nbsp;there is a relatively high degree of bilingualism involving the trade language."&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Richard, 1982, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Documentation from the 17th century indicates that the [[Wyandot language]] (also called Huron), one of the [[Iroquoian languages]], was also used as a trade language east of the Great Lakes by speakers of the Nipissing and [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]] dialects of Ojibwe, and also by other groups south of the Great Lakes, including the Winnebago and by a group of unknown affiliation identified only as "Assistaeronon." The political decline of the Hurons in the 18th century and the ascendancy of Ojibwe-speaking groups including the Ottawa led to the replacement of Huron as a ''lingua franca''.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, Peter and Anthony Grant, 1996, p. 1116.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area east of [[Georgian Bay]], the Nipissing dialect was a trade language. In the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan]], the eastern end of the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]], the area between [[Lake Erie]] and [[Lake Huron]], and along the north shore of Georgian Bay, the Ottawa dialect served as a trade language. In the area south of [[Lake Superior]] and west of [[Lake Michigan]] Southwestern Ojibwe was the trade language.&lt;ref name="RTrade"&gt;Rhodes, Richard, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; A widespread pattern of asymmetrical bilingualism is found in the area south of the Great Lakes, in which speakers of Potawatomi or Menominee, both Algonquian languages, could also speak Ojibwe, but Ojibwe speakers did not speak the other languages. It is known that some speakers of Menominee also speak Ojibwe, and that this pattern persisted into the 20th century. Similarly bilingualism in Ojibwe is still common among Potawatomis who speak Potawatomi.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Richard, 1982, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports from traders and travellers as early as 1744 indicated that speakers of [[Menominee language|Menominee]], another Algonquian language, used Ojibwe as a ''lingua franca''. Other reports from the 18th century and early 19th century indicate that speakers of the unrelated [[Siouan languages|Siouan language]] [[Winnebago language|Ho-Chunk (Winnebago)]] also used Ojibwe when dealing with Europeans and others.&lt;ref name="Broken1"&gt;Nichols, John, 1995, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports indicate that agents of the American government at [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] spoke Ojibwe in their interactions with Menominee, with other reports indicating that "...&amp;nbsp;the Chippewa, Menominee, Ottawa, Potawatomi, Sac, and Fox tribes used Ojibwe in intertribal communication&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Broken1"/&gt; Some reports indicate that further to the west speakers of non-Algonquian languages such as Ho-Chunk (Winnebago), [[Chiwere language|Iowa]], and [[Pawnee language|Pawnee]] spoke Ojibwe as an 'acquired language.'&lt;ref name="Broken1"/&gt;

===Influence on other languages===
[[Michif language|Michif]] is a [[mixed language]] that primarily is based upon [[French language|French]] and [[Plains Cree]], with some vocabulary from Ojibwe, in addition to phonological influence in Michif-speaking communities where there is a significant Ojibwe influence.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Richard, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, Peter, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, Peter, 1996, pp. 264–270.&lt;/ref&gt; In locations such as [[Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians|Turtle Mountain, North Dakota]] individuals of Ojibwe ancestry now speak Michif and Ojibwe.&lt;ref&gt;Alex DeCoteau, Turtle Mountain Chippewa member and Ojibwe speaker.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ojibwe borrowings have been noted in [[Menominee language|Menominee]], a related [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, Leonard, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bungi Creole]] is the name given to an English Based [[Creole language]] spoken in Manitoba by the descendants of "English, Scottish, and Orkney fur traders and their Cree or Saulteaux wives&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref&gt;Blain, Eleanor, 1987, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Bungee incorporates elements of Cree; the name may be from the Ojibwe word ''bangii'' "a little bit" or the Cree equivalent but whether there is any other Ojibwe component in Bungee is not documented.&lt;ref&gt;Blain, Eleanor, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
{{Main article|Ojibwe phonology}}
All dialects of Ojibwe generally have an inventory of seventeen [[consonant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Nichols, John, 1981, p. 6 for Southwestern Ojibwe.&lt;/ref&gt; Most dialects have the segment [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}} in their inventory of consonant phonemes; Severn Ojibwe and the Algonquin dialect have {{IPA|/h/}} in its place. Some dialects have both segments phonetically, but only one is present in [[Underlying representation|phonological representations]].&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottawa and Southwestern Ojibwe (Chippewa) have {{IPA|/h/}} in a small number of affective vocabulary items in addition to regular {{IPA|/ʔ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Richard, 1985, p. xlvi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, John and Earl Nyholm, 1995, p. xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Some dialects may have otherwise non-occurring sounds such as {{IPA|/f, l, r/}} in [[loanword]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Richard, 1985, p. xli.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Obstruent]] consonants are divided into [[fortis and lenis|lenis]] and [[fortis and lenis|fortis]] sets, with these features having varying phonological analyses and phonetic realizations cross-dialectally. In some dialects, such as Severn Ojibwe, members of the fortis set are realized as a sequence of /h/ followed by a single segment drawn from the set of lenis consonants: {{IPA|/p t k tʃ s ʃ/}}. Algonquin Ojibwe is reported as distinguishing fortis and lenis consonants on the basis of [[Voice (phonetics)|voicing]], with fortis being voiceless and lenis being voiced.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 1994, pp. 123–124.&lt;/ref&gt; In other dialects fortis consonants are realized as having greater [[Length (phonetics)|duration]] than the corresponding lenis consonant, invariably voiceless, 'vigorously articulated,' and [[Aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated]] in certain environments.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, Leonard, 1958, p. 8; Rhodes, Richard, 1985, pp. xliv, xlvii, xlix, l, li.&lt;/ref&gt; In some practical orthographies such as the widely used Double Vowel system, fortis consonants are written with voiceless symbols: ''p, t, k, ch, s, sh''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;For Southwestern Ojibwe, see Nichols, John and Earl Nyholm, 1995; for Ottawa, see Rhodes, Richard, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenis consonants have normal duration; are typically voiced intervocalically, although they may be devoiced at the end or beginning of a word; are less vigorously articulated than fortis consonants; and are invariably unaspirated.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, Leonard, 1958, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Double Vowel practical orthography, lenis consonants are written with voiced symbols: ''b, d, g, j, z, zh''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

All dialects of Ojibwe have two [[nasal stop|nasal consonants]] {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}; one labialized [[velar approximant]] {{IPA|/w/}}; one [[palatal approximant]] {{IPA|/j/}}; and one of glottal stop {{IPA|/ʔ/}} or {{IPA|/h/}}.&lt;ref&gt;For Southwestern Ojibwe, see Nichols, John, 1981; for Ottawa, see Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

All dialects of Ojibwe have seven [[Nasal vowel|oral vowels]]. [[Vowel length]] is phonologically [[Contrastive distribution|contrastive]], hence [[Phoneme|phonemic]]. Although the long and short vowels are phonetically distinguished by vowel quality, recognition of vowel length in phonological representations is required, as the distinction between [[Vowel length|long]] and [[Vowel length|short vowel]]s is essential for the operation of the [[Metrical phonology|metrical]] rule of [[Ottawa phonology#Vowel syncope|vowel syncope]] that characterizes the Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe dialects, as well as for the rules that determine [[Stress (linguistics)|word stress]].&lt;ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001"/&gt; There are three short vowels, {{IPA|/i a o/}}; and three corresponding long vowels, {{IPA|/iː aː oː/}}, in addition to a fourth long vowel {{IPA|/eː/}}, which lacks a corresponding short vowel. The short vowel /i/ typically has phonetic values centring on {{IPA|[ɪ]}}; {{IPA|/a/}} typically has values centring on {{IPA|[ə]~[ʌ]}}; and {{IPA|/o/}} typically has values centring on {{IPA|[o]~[ʊ]}}. Long {{IPA|/oː/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[uː]}} for many speakers, and {{IPA|/eː/}} is for many {{IPA|[ɛː]}}.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g.: Rhodes, Richard, 1985, for the Ottawa dialect; Nichols, John and Earl Nyholm, 1995, for the Southwestern Ojibwe dialect.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ojibwe has [[nasal vowel]]s; some arise predictably by rule in all analyses, and other long nasal vowels are of uncertain phonological status.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, John, 1980, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter have been analysed both as underlying [[phoneme]]s,&lt;ref name="Bloomfield, Leonard, 1958"/&gt; and also as predictable, that is derived by the operation of phonological rules from sequences of a long vowel followed by /n/ and another segment, typically /j/.&lt;ref&gt;Piggott, Glyne, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

Placement of word stress is determined by metrical rules that define a characteristic [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]] [[Metrical phonology|metrical foot]], in which a [[Metrical phonology|weak]] syllable is followed by a [[Metrical phonology|strong]] syllable. A Foot consists of a minimum of one [[syllable]], and a maximum of two syllables, with each Foot containing a maximum of one Strong syllable. The structure of the metrical Foot defines the domain for relative [[Stress (linguistics)|prominence]], in which a Strong syllable is assigned stress because it is more prominent than the weak member of the Foot. Typically, the Strong syllable in the [[antepenult]]imate Foot is assigned the primary stress.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of this rule in the Ottawa dialect, see Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Strong syllables that do not receive main stress are assigned at least secondary stress.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randoph, 2001, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In some dialects, metrically Weak (unstressed) vowels at the beginning of a word are frequently lost; in the Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe dialects all metrically Weak vowels are deleted.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 51–55.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''bemisemagak(in)'' (airplane(s), in the Southwestern Ojibwe dialect) is stressed as ['''''be''' · m&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;se · m&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;gak'' /ˈbɛːmɪˌseːmʌˌgak/] in the singular but as [''be · m&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'''se''' · m&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;ga · kin'' /ˌbeːmɪˈsɛːmʌˌgaˌkin/] in the plural. In some other dialects, metrically Weak (unstressed) vowels, especially "a" and "i", are reduced to a [[schwa]] and depending on the writer, may be transcribed as "i", "e" or "a". For example, ''anami'egiizhigad'' [''&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;na · m&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''''e''' · gii · zh&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;gad'' /əˌnaməˈʔɛːˌgiːʒəˌgad/] (Sunday, literally "prayer day") may be transcribed as ''anama'egiizhigad'' in those dialects.

==Grammar==
{{Main article|Ojibwe grammar}}
The general grammatical characteristics of Ojibwe are shared across its dialects. The Ojibwe language is [[polysynthetic]], exhibits characteristics of [[Synthetic language|synthesis]] and a high [[morpheme]]-to-word ratio. Ojibwe is a [[head-marking language]] in which [[inflection]]al morphology on nouns and particularly verbs carries significant amounts of grammatical information.

Word classes include [[noun]]s, [[verb]]s, [[grammatical particle]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[preverb]]s, and [[prenoun]]s. Preferred [[word order]]s in a simple [[Transitivity (grammatical category)|transitive]] sentence are verb-initial, such as [[verb–object–subject|V(erb)–O(bject)–S(ubject)]] and [[verb–subject–object|VSO]]. While verb-final orders are dispreferred, all logically possible orders are attested.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 934–935.&lt;/ref&gt;

Complex [[Inflectional morphology|inflectional]] and [[Derivational morphology|derivational]] [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] play a central role in Ojibwe grammar. Noun inflection and particularly verb inflection indicate a wide variety of grammatical information, realized through the use of [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es added to [[word stem]]s. Grammatical characteristics include the following:
#[[Grammatical gender|gender]],&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; divided into [[Grammatical gender#Animate and inanimate|animate]] and [[Grammatical gender#Animate and inanimate|inanimate]] categories
#extensive [[Head-marking language|head-marking]] on verbs of [[inflection]]al information concerning [[Grammatical person|person]]&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, Chapters 5–8; pp. 62–72.&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Grammatical number|number]]&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Grammatical tense|tense]]&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 759–782.&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Linguistic modality|modality]]&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, p. 759.&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[evidentiality]]&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 830–837.&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Negation (linguistics)|negation]]&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 837–856.&lt;/ref&gt;
#a distinction between [[Grammatical person#Additional persons|obviative]] and [[Grammatical person#Additional persons|proximate]] third-person, marked on both verbs and nouns.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001, pp. 623–643.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a distinction between two different types of [[grammatical person|third person]], the ''proximate'' (the third person deemed more important or in-focus) and the ''obviative'' (the third person deemed less important or out-of-focus). Nouns can be singular or plural, and one of two genders, [[Animacy|animate]] or [[Animacy|inanimate]]. Separate personal [[pronoun]]s exist, but are usually used for emphasis; they distinguish [[Inclusive and exclusive we|inclusive and exclusive first person]] plurals.

Verbs constitute the most complex word class. Verbs are inflected for one of three ''orders'' (''indicative'', the default; ''conjunct'', used for participles and in [[subordinate clause]]s; and ''imperative'', used with commands), as negative or affirmative, and for the person, number, animacy, and proximate/obviative status of both the subject and object, as well as for several different ''modes'' (including the ''dubitative'' and ''preterit'') and tenses.

==Vocabulary==

===Loanwords and neologisms===
Although it does contain a few loans from English (e.g. ''gaapii'', "coffee," ) and French (e.g. ''mooshwe'', "handkerchief" (from ''mouchoir''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bolt.lakeheadu.ca/~jomeara/ojibweBorrowings.html |title=Words Borrowed From English/French Into Ojibwe |author=O'Meara, John |accessdate=2008-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718073455/http://bolt.lakeheadu.ca/~jomeara/ojibweBorrowings.html |archivedate=2007-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''ni-tii'', "tea" (from ''le thé'', "the tea")), in general, the Ojibwe language is notable for its relative lack of borrowing from other languages. Instead, speakers far prefer to create words for new concepts from existing vocabulary. For example in Minnesota ''Ojibwemowin'', "airplane" is ''bemisemagak'', literally "thing that flies" (from ''bimisemagad'', "to fly"), and "battery" is ''ishkode-makakoons'', literally "little fire-box" (from ''ishkode'', "fire," and ''makak'', "box"). Even "coffee" is called ''makade-mashkikiwaaboo'' ("black liquid-medicine") by many speakers, rather than ''gaapii''. These new words vary from region to region, and occasionally from community to community. For example, in Northwest Ontario ''Ojibwemowin'', "airplane" is ''ombaasijigan'', literally "device that gets uplifted by the wind" (from ''ombaasin'', "to be uplifted by the wind") as opposed to the Minnesota's ''bemisemagak''.

===Dialect variation===
Like any language dialects spanning vast regions, some words that may have had identical meaning at one time have evolved to have different meanings today. For example, ''zhooniyaans'' (literally "small[-amount of] money" and used to refer to coins) specifically means "dime" (10-cent piece) in the United States, but a "quarter" (25-cent piece) in Canada, or ''desabiwin'' (literally "thing to sit upon") means "couch" or "chair" in Canada, but is used to specifically mean a "saddle" in the United States.

Cases like "battery" and "coffee" also demonstrate the often great difference between the literal meanings of the individual [[morpheme]]s in a word, and the overall meaning of the entire word.

==Writing system==
{{Main article|Ojibwe writing systems}}
There is no standard writing system used for all Ojibwe dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Ningewance, Patricia, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Local alphabets have been developed by adapting the [[Latin script]], usually based on [[English alphabet|English]] or [[French orthography|French]] orthography.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Willard, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Ojibwe writing systems#Ojibwe syllabics|syllabic]] writing system not related to English or French writing is used by some Ojibwe speakers in northern Ontario and Manitoba. [[Great Lakes Algonquian syllabics]] are based on the French alphabet with letters organized into syllables. It was primarily used by speakers of [[Fox language|Fox]], Potawatomi, and Winnebago, but there is indirect evidence of use by speakers of Southwestern Ojibwe.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Willard, 1996, pp. 168–172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Huron, 1932, p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely used Roman character-based writing system is the [[Ojibwe writing systems#Double-vowel system|Double Vowel system]] devised by Charles Fiero. Although there is no standard orthography, the Double Vowel system is used by many Ojibwe language teachers because of its ease of use. A wide range of materials have been published in this system, including a grammar,&lt;ref name="Valentine, J. Randolph, 2001"/&gt; dictionaries,&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, John, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Richard, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; collections of texts,&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, J. Randolph, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kegg, Maude, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, John and Leonard Bloomfield, eds., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; and pedagogical grammars.&lt;ref&gt;Vollom, Judith and Thomas M. Vollom, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ningewance, Patricia, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; In northern Ontario and Manitoba, Ojibwe is most commonly written using the [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics|Cree syllabary]], a [[syllabary]] originally developed by [[Methodism|Methodist]] missionary [[James Evans (linguist)|James Evans]] around 1840 in order to write Cree. The syllabic system is based in part on Evans' knowledge of [[Pitman's shorthand]] and his prior experience developing a distinctive [[alphabet]]ic writing system for Ojibwe in southern Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, John, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double vowel system===
{{refimprove section|date=June 2016}}
The double vowel system uses three short vowels, four long vowels, and eighteen consonants, represented with the following Roman letters:
&lt;blockquote&gt;a aa b ch d e g ' h i ii j k m n o oo p s sh t w y z zh&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Dialects typically either have {{IPA|/h/}} or {{IPA|/ʔ/}} (the orthographic {{angle bracket|'}} in most versions) but rarely both.&lt;ref&gt;For Southwestern Ojibwe, which has {{IPA|/ʔ/}} (orthographic {{angle bracket|'}}) but not {{IPA|/h/}}, see Nichols, John, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;
This system is called "double vowel" because the long vowel correspondences to the short vowels {{angle bracket|a}}, {{angle bracket|i}} and {{angle bracket|o}} are written with a doubled value. In this system, the nasal ''ny'' as a final element is instead written {{angle bracket|nh}}. The allowable consonant clusters are {{angle bracket|mb}}, {{angle bracket|nd}}, {{angle bracket|ng}}, {{angle bracket|n'}}, {{angle bracket|nj}}, {{angle bracket|nz}}, {{angle bracket|ns}}, {{angle bracket|nzh}}, {{angle bracket|sk}}, {{angle bracket|shp}}, {{angle bracket|sht}}, and {{angle bracket|shk}}.

'''Perga''' or '''Perge''' ({{lang-el|Πέργη}} ''Perge'', {{lang-tr|Perge}}) was an ancient [[Anatolia]]n city in modern Turkey, once the capital of [[Pamphylia Secunda]], now in [[Antalya province]] on the southwestern Mediterranean coast of [[Turkey]]. Today, it is a large site of ancient ruins {{convert|15|km}} east of [[Antalya]] on the coastal plain. An [[acropolis]] located there dates back to the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Perga was an ancient and important city of Pamphylia, between the rivers [[Düden River|Catarrhactes]] and [[Cestrus (river)|Cestrus]] (Turkish Aksu Çayı).&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo|Strab]]. xiv. p. 667; [[Pliny the Elder|Plin]]. v. 26; [[Pomponius Mela|Pomp. Mel.]] i. 14; [[Ptolemy|Ptol]]. v. 5. § 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

A treaty between the [[Hittites|Hittite]] Great King [[Tudhaliya IV]] and his vassal, the king of [[Tarhuntassa]], defined the latter's western border at the city "Parha" and the "Kastaraya River".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=G. Beckman| title=Hittite diplomatic texts |location= Atlanta | year=1996}}, no. 18C&lt;/ref&gt; The river is assumed to be the classical Cestrus. West of Parha were the "Lukka Lands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=British Museum Studies in Ancient Egypt and Sudan |volume=14 | title=The Arzawa letters in recent perspective |author=J. David Hawkins | year=2009 |pages=73–83}}, 75&lt;/ref&gt; Parha likely spoke a late Luwian dialect like Lycian and that of the neo-Hittite kingdoms.

Perge returns to history as a Pamphylian Greek city, and with Pamphylia came under successive rule by Persians, Athenians, and Persians again. [[Alexander the Great]], after quitting [[Phaselis]], occupied Perge with a part of his army. The road between these two towns is described as long and difficult.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''Anab''. i. 26; ''comp''. [[Polybius|Polyb]]. v. 72, xxii. 25; [[Livy|Liv]]. xxxviii. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's rule was followed by the [[Diadochi]] empire of the [[Seleucids]], then the Romans.

Perge gained renown for the worship of [[Artemis]], whose temple stood on a hill outside the town, and in whose honour annual festivals were celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;Strab. xiv. p. 667; Callim. Hymn. in Dian. 187; [[Scylax]], p. 39; Dionys. Per. 854.&lt;/ref&gt; The coins of Perge represent both the goddess and her temple.

In 46&amp;nbsp;A.D., according to the [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[St. Paul]] journeyed  to Perga, from there continued on to Antiocheia in Pisidia, then returned to Perga where he preached the word of God (Acts 14:25). Then he left the city and went to Attaleia.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Acts|14:25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Cestrus silted up over the late Roman era, Perga declined as a secular city.&lt;ref name="silt"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.anatolia.luwo.be/destinations/perge.html | title=Perge}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the 4th century, during the reign of [[Constantine the Great]] (324-337), Perga became an important centre of Christianity, which soon became the official religion of the Roman Empire. The city retained its status as a Christian centre in the 5th and 6th centuries.

===Ecclesiastical history===
[[St. Paul the Apostle]] and his, companion St. [[Barnabas]], twice visited Perga as recorded in the biblical book, the Acts of the Apostles,&lt;ref&gt;Acts 13:13–14 and 14:25.&lt;/ref&gt; during their first missionary journey, where they "preached the word"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|14:25|KJV|}}&lt;/ref&gt; before heading for and sailing from [[Attalia]] (modern-day Antalya city), {{convert|15|km}} to the southwest, to Antioch.

[[Saint Paul|Paul]] and [[Barnabas]] came to Perge during their [[Paul the Apostle#First missionary journey|first missionary journey]], but probably stayed there only a short time, and do not seem to have preached there;&lt;ref&gt;Acts 13:13.&lt;/ref&gt; it was there that [[John Mark]] left Paul to return to [[Jerusalem]]. On his return from [[Pisidia]], Paul preached at Perge.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 14:24.&lt;/ref&gt;

St. [[Matrona of Perge]] of the [[6th century]] was a female [[saint]] known for temporarily [[cross-dressing]] to avoid her abusive husband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thereligionportal.com/frame.asp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fordham.edu%2Fhalsall%2Fbasis%2Fmatrona.html&amp;rl=subpage.asp%3Fnode%3D20051994%26CTitle%3DMore%2BSaints%2BM%26Loc%3D%255CChristianity%257C106646%255CNotable%2BFigures%257C532084%255CBy%2BType%257C20051344%255CSaints%257C1107080%255CSaints%2BM%257C20051992%255CMore%2BSaints%2BM%257C20051994&amp;s=Religion]&lt;/ref&gt; She also is known for opposing the [[Monophysite]] policy of the emperor [[Anastasios I]].&lt;ref name="Holy Women of Byzantine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Talbot|first1=Alice-Mary|title=Holy Women of Byzantium: Ten saints lives' in English translation|url=http://www.doaks.org/resources/publications/doaks-online-publications/holy-women-of-byzantium/talbch2.pdf|website=doaks.org|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matrona hid in the [[monastery of St. Bassion]] as the enuch Babylos. Once revealed, she was sent to a woman’s monastery where she was head of the convent. She was famous for her miraculous gift of healing. She went on to found a nunnery in [[Constantinople]]. St Matrona died at the age of 100. Her life was told through a ''vita prima'' whose author and exact time period remains a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/matrona.asp vita prima]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greek Language|Greek]] ''[[Notitiae episcopatuum]]'' mentions the city as [[Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|metropolis]] of [[Pamphylia Secunda]] until the [[13th century]]. [[Le Quien]]&lt;ref&gt;Le Quien. Oriens christ., I, 1013.&lt;/ref&gt; gives the names of 11 of its bishops: Epidaurus, present at the [[Council of Ancyra]] in 312; Callicles at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325; Berenianus, at Constantinople (426); Epiphanius at the [[Second Council of Ephesus]] (449), at the First [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451),&lt;ref&gt;Richard Price, Michael Gaddis, The Acts of the Council of Chalcedon, Volume 1 (University of Liverpool Press, 2005)[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=6IUaOOT1G3UC&amp;pg=RA2-PA157&amp;lpg=RA2-PA157&amp;dq=Richard+Price,+Michael+Gaddis,+The+Acts+of+the+Council+of+Chalcedon,+Volume+1&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xsdx6sJqOR&amp;sig=0y3dFazEyPhUhsMf-71F7IACMDc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLr8OLofnMAhUJFpQKHXQnC0gQ6AEINTAF#v=snippet&amp;q=Perge&amp;f=false p94].&lt;/ref&gt; and a signatory of the letter from the bishops of the province to Emperor Leo (458); Hilarianus, at a [[council at Constantinople]] in 536; Eulogius, at the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] in 553; Apergius, condemned as a [[Monothelite]] at the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] in 680; John, at the [[Trullan council]] in 692; Sisinnius Pastillas about 754 (an [[Byzantine iconoclasm|iconoclast]] who was condemned at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787); Constans, at the same council of that condemned his predecessor; John, at the [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Catholic)|Council of Constantinople of 869–70]].

No longer a residential, the bishopric is included in the [[Catholic Church]]'s list of [[titular see]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 952&lt;/ref&gt;

Perga remained inhabited until the foundation of the [[Seljuk Empire]], roughly 1000 CE.&lt;ref name="silt"/&gt;

==Notables==
*Perga's most celebrated ancient inhabitant, the mathematician [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]] (c.262&amp;nbsp;BC – c.190&amp;nbsp;BC), lived and worked there. He wrote a series of eight books describing a family of curves known as [[conic section]]s, comprising the [[circle]], [[ellipse]], [[parabola]], and [[hyperbola]].&lt;ref name="Boyer Apollonius"&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-471-54397-8|chapter=Apollonius of Perga |pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeology ==
Perga is today an archaeological site and a tourist attraction. There were numerous excavations and discoveries since 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/1800-year-old-mosaic-found-in-ancient-city-of-perge-115733 1,800-year-old mosaic found in ancient city of Perge]&lt;/ref&gt;
Ancient Perge, one of the chief cities of Pamphylia, was situated between the Rivers Catarrhactes (Düden Nehri) and [[Aksu River (Turkey)|Cestrus (Aksu)]], 60 stadia (about {{convert|11.1|km}})&lt;!---assumed 185 m per stadion--&gt; from the mouth of the latter; the site is in the modern Turkish village of Murtana on the Suridjik sou, a tributary of the Cestrus, formerly in the Ottoman [[vilayet of Konya]]. Its ruins include a [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatre]], a [[palaestra]], a temple of [[Artemis]] and two churches. 
The [[temple of Artemis]] was located outside the town. Many of the coins struck in the city portrayed both the goddess and her sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.realmofhistory.com/2017/07/25/greek-mythology-mosaic-perga/ A Bevy Of Greek Mythology-Depicting Mosaics Uncovered At The Ancient City Of Perga, Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another big ancient city in the area is [[Selge, Pisidia]], located about 20km to the northeast.

The Perge has been dubbed as “Turkey’s second [[Zeugma, Commagene|Zeugma]]” for the alluring appearance of the mosaics that have been unearthed so far. In 2003, archaeologists discovered well-preserved Greek [[mosaics]] showcasing [[Oceanus]] and [[Medusa]]. In 2017, discovered a mosaic depicting the sacrifice of [[Iphigenia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/1800-year-old-mosaic-found-in-ancient-city-of-perge-115733 1,800-year-old mosaic found in ancient city of Perge]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.realmofhistory.com/2017/07/25/greek-mythology-mosaic-perga/ A Bevy Of Greek Mythology-Depicting Mosaics Uncovered At The Ancient City Of Perga, Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!---huh?
15 km to the southwest, "to Antioch" cannot be correct, it should read "to Perga"
--I'm sure this means something but seems out of place here---&gt;

The '''Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear''' was a gathering that took place on October 30, 2010, at the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The rally was led by [[Jon Stewart]], host of the satirical news program ''[[The Daily Show]]'', and [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Stephen Colbert (character)|in-character]] as a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Pundit (expert)|political pundit]].&lt;ref name=torontosun&gt;{{cite news|title=200K turn out to 'Restore Sanity' in Washington|publisher=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=October 30, 2010|url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/world/2010/10/30/15890551.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 215,000 people attended the rally, according to [[aerial photography]] analysis by AirPhotosLive.com for ''[[CBS News]]''.&lt;ref name=cbs-size&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20021284-503544.html|work=CBS News|title=Jon Stewart Rally Attracts Estimated 215,000|first=Brian|last=Montopoli|date=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rally was a combination of what initially were announced as separate events: Stewart's "Rally to Restore Sanity" and Colbert's counterpart, the "March to Keep Fear Alive." Its stated purpose was to provide a venue for attendees to be heard above what Stewart described as the more vocal and extreme 15–20% of Americans who "control the conversation" of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]],&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gkOsOs61eFqq5znyHyVThYNAGTDw|title=US comics unveil dueling DC political rallies|date=September 17, 2010|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the argument being that these extremes demonize each other and engage in counterproductive actions, with a return to sanity intended to promote reasoned discussion.  Despite Stewart's insistence to the contrary, news reports cast the rally as a spoof of [[Glenn Beck]]'s [[Restoring Honor rally]] and [[Al Sharpton]]'s [[Reclaim the Dream commemorative march|Reclaim the Dream]] rally.&lt;ref name=NBC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/51942/212962|title=Jon Stewart: Rallies Not a Response to Glenn Beck|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=September 30, 2010|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

===Response to Restoring Honor rally===
On August 28, 2010, the [[Fox News]] Channel's Glenn Beck held a "Restoring Honor" rally at the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. On the same day, [[Al Sharpton]] led a countermarch, called [[Reclaim the Dream commemorative march|Reclaim the Dream]], to mark the 47th anniversary of the historic [[Great March on Washington]].&lt;ref name=NBC/&gt; According to ''[[New York Magazine]]'', discussion for a satirical public event in response took place behind the scenes at Stewart's ''[[The Daily Show]]'' as early as August 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title="August 12, 2010"|url=|series=The Daily Show with Jon Stewart|serieslink=|credits=Executive Producers: [[Rory Albanese]], Josh Lieb, [[Jon Stewart]]|network=[[Comedy Central]]|station=|city=|airdate=August 12, 2010|began=|ended=|season=|seriesno=|number=|minutes=|transcript=|transcripturl=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/arts/tv/profiles/68086/index1.html|title=America Is a Joke|author=Chris Smith|date=September 12, 2011|work=[[New York Magazine]]|publisher=New York Media LLC.|pages=2, 5|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart has stated that the rally was never intended to be a means to counter Glenn Beck, but was simply another format for his and Colbert's style of humor, saying "We saw [the Restoring Honor rally] and thought, 'What a beautiful outline. What a beautiful structure to fill with what we want to express in live form, festival form.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130321994|title=Jon Stewart: The Most Trusted Name In Fake News|author=|date=October 4, 2010|work=[[National Public Radio]]|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=November 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before any public discussion by Stewart, Colbert, or their staffs, members of the [[social news]] website [[Reddit]] independently began to discuss the possibility of a Colbert-led rally, often referred to as a "Restoring [[Truthiness]] Rally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=150942998258775|title=100,000 Strong to Restore Truthiness to the US Capital|publisher=Facebook|date=|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the rallies were announced, some news articles credited Reddit for the idea.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost1&gt;{{cite news|last=Bell|first=Melissa|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/blog-post/2010/09/rally_to_restore_sanity_to_mee.html|title=Blog Post – 'Rally to Restore Sanity' to meet 'March to Keep Fear Alive;' Reddit users talk about starting the online campaign|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 17, 2010|accessdate=September 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rally was produced by Stewart's Busboy Productions.

===Announcement===
[[File:Colbert-Stewart 2010 DC rally posters.png|thumb|right|Early posters for the then-separate rallies]]
Stewart first hinted at the event on the September 7 episode of ''The Daily Show'' by declaring that "[he would] have an announcement sometime in the near to not so near future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-september-7-2010/moment-of-zen---jon-s-important-announcement |title=Moment of Zen – Jon's Important Announcement – The Daily Show with Jon Stewart – 09/07/10 – Video Clip &amp;#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Thedailyshow.com |date=September 7, 2010|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert, in that night's episode of ''The Report,'' said that he, too, had an announcement to make.  In the following days, Stewart and Colbert used their shows to hype their respective announcements, competing over whose would be more significant.  The banter finally culminated with Stewart formally announcing the "Rally to Restore Sanity" on the September 16, 2010 episode of ''The Daily Show'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title="September 16, 2010"|url=|series=The Daily Show with Jon Stewart|serieslink=|credits=Executive Producers: [[Rory Albanese]], Josh Lieb, [[Jon Stewart]]|network=[[Comedy Central]]|station=|city=|airdate=September 16, 2010|began=|ended=|season=|seriesno=|number=|minutes=|transcript=|transcripturl=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert followed by announcing the "March to Keep Fear Alive" on the subsequent episode of ''The Colbert Report.''

Stewart declared that his rally was intended for the majority of Americans, "the 70–80 percenters," who do not hold extreme political views and lack a voice in the media. To illustrate the point, he unveiled a mock motto for the rally: "Take it down a notch for America." A series of protest sign designs were proposed on the ''Daily Show'' featuring messages such as "I disagree with you, but I'm pretty sure you're not Hitler." Colbert responded to Stewart's proposal by challenging the theme of Stewart's rally and justifying his own "March to Keep Fear Alive." Noting that this was not the time to be reasonable, Colbert declared, "Now is the time for all good men to freak out for freedom!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/quotes/0,26174,2019855,00.html|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|title=Quotes of the Day|date=September 17, 2010|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oprah Winfrey]] appeared on ''The Daily Show'' via video on October 14, 2010, to award the attending audience free airfare to the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-october-14-2010/rally-to-restore-sanity-and-or-fear-announcement|title=Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear Announcement|publisher=Comedy Central|date=October 14, 2010|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plane tickets were hidden under the audience members' seats in the same fashion as she has given away prizes to her own audience members on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20021261-503544.html|date=October 30, 2010|title=Jon Stewart's "Rally to Restore Sanity:" A "Non-Political" Rally That Is Actually Politically Charged|first=Christine|last=Delargy|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode of the ''Colbert Report'' airing immediately afterward, Stephen Colbert also offered tickets to his rally. Without Oprah's support to provide airfare, Colbert instead distributed vouchers for the low-cost [[Chinatown bus]] from [[New York City]] to [[Washington, D.C.]] During the show, Colbert also revealed to Stewart that he did not possess a permit to legally organize the "March to Keep Fear Alive," leading Stewart to propose combining the two events into the "Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear" that would feature a new combined logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/10/15/oprah-latest-star-lend-celebrity-stewarts-rally/|title=Oprah Latest Star to Lend Celebrity Endorsement to Stewart's Rally|date=October 15, 2010|work=FoxNews.com|publisher=[[FOX News Network]], LLC|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to the announcement===
In the night following the announcement, the pledged number of attendees to the event reached 69,000 on [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/ct-talk-stewart-rally-0923-20100922,0,4916287.story|title=Jon Stewart rally|publisher=chicagotribune.com|date=September 22, 2010|accessdate=October 15, 2010|first=Duaa|last=Eldeib}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number far exceeded the 25,000 that the rally organizers had indicated as the estimated number of attendees on the [[National Park Service]] application for a rally permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/20/AR2010092005998.html?hpid=news-col-blog|first=Petula|last=Dvorak|date=September 21, 2010|accessdate=September 21, 2010|title=Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert might actually bring out the real moderates}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demand for hotels during the period of the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear outpaced that of the "Restoring Honor" rally.&lt;ref name=NBC&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[NBC]]|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/around-town/events/Dueling-Rallies-Spike-Hotel-Bookings-103892163.html|date=September 28, 2010|title=Dueling Rallies Spike Hotel Bookings}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rally spawned several grassroots websites and [[Facebook]] groups for organizing and discussion, some with more than 10,000 followers.

The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' characterized the Rally as a "send-up" of the Washington Restoring Honor rally led by Glenn Beck and the "Reclaim the Dream" commemorative march led by Al Sharpton on August 28, 2010.&lt;ref name=WSJstaff&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/09/17/rally-to-restore-sanity-jon-stewart-on-his-march-on-washington/|title='Rally to Restore Sanity': Jon Stewart on His March on Washington,|date=September 17, 2010|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Canadian Press]] called the Stewart/Colbert rallies a "not-so-gentle" swipe at Glenn Beck's "Restoring Honor" rally.&lt;ref name=Globemail&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/comedy-colleagues-stewart-colbert-plan-dc-rallies/article1711983/|title=Comedy colleagues Stewart, Colbert plan D.C. rallies; Duo's events are a swipe at Glenn Beck and the politics of fear,|date=September 17, 2010|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|accessdate=November 14, 2011|location=Toronto}} {{Registration required|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a town hall event on September 29, [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] cited the forthcoming rally as representing those people who are concerned with more than just the political beliefs of others, in contrast to "provocative" cable news programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ali Weinberg|url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/09/29/5203437-obama-plugs-jon-stewart-rally|title=Obama plugs Jon Stewart rally|publisher=[[Msnbc.com]]|work=First Read|date=September 29, 2009|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many news organizations sought media credentials to cover the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carter |first=Bill |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/business/media/15rally.html?_r=3 |title=Growing Interest, Despite Questions, in Jon Stewart's Rally |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 14, 2010 |accessdate=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipating staff interest in attending for non-professional purposes, [[NPR]] barred staffers from attending the rally in a memo that stated: "NPR journalists may not participate in marches and rallies involving causes or issues that NPR covers, nor should they sign petitions or otherwise lend their name to such causes, or contribute money to them.

Some barred employees from attending the rally outright, while others such as ''[[The Washington Post]]'' offered more latitude, telling newsroom managers to differentiate between "participating" and "observing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.observer.com/2010/daily-transom/news-outlets-follow-nprs-lead-no-staffers-stewart-and-colbert-rallies#|title=News Outlets Follow NPR's Lead: No Staffers at Stewart and Colbert Rallies |publisher=The New York Observer|date=October 14, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity drive===
Prior to the announcement of the joint rally, supporters of the movement for a Colbert-led march had begun a [[fundraising|drive]] to raise money for educational charities through [[DonorsChoose]].org, a [[charitable organization]] of which Colbert is a member of the Board of Directors. In the first 24 hours, supporters raised over $100,000. In the days that followed, that total increased to over $250,000,&lt;ref name=washingtonpost1/&gt; and by the day of the rally over $500,000 had been contributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Restoring Truthiness Giving Page|publisher=DonorsChoose.org|url=http://www.donorschoose.org/truthiness}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Stewart promoted the [http://www.nationalmall.org Trust for the National Mall], urging his viewers to make donations on behalf of the rally. As of October 31, 2010, over $188,000 had been donated to the Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Donations to date|publisher=Trust for the National Mall|url=https://www.nationalmall.org/donationform.php/rtrs?fund=Rally%20to%20Restore%20Sanity|access-date=October 31, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910215030/https://www.nationalmall.org/donationform.php/rtrs?fund=Rally%20to%20Restore%20Sanity#|archive-date=September 10, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rally==

Jon Stewart satirically estimated the crowd size at 10 million people during the event. Colbert later tweeted that it had been 6 billion.&lt;ref name=ny-daily-news&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[NY Daily News]]|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/10/31/2010-10-31_jon_stewarts_rally_to_restore_sanity_drew_200000_beating_estimated_attendance_at.html|title=Jon Stewart's 'Rally to Restore Sanity' drew 200,000, beating estimated attendance at Glenn Beck's|first=Meena|last=Hartenstein|date=October 31, 2010|accessdate=November 2, 2010|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Setting===
As the number of expected participants grew, the rally was moved from the grounds of the Washington Monument to the east end of the Mall facing the Capitol. The stage was on the east side of the rally with an open back, allowing the Capitol building to provide the backdrop for the performances. In order to meet the public safety requirements of the National Park Service permit, the Mall between the Capitol and 14th Street was divided into sections, with access aisles lined by portable fences. Speakers and jumbotron television screens were placed along both the north and south edges to encourage the crowd to spread out rather than press against the main stage.

Portable toilets and first aid stations were also provided. Because the rally was held the day before the previously scheduled [[Marine Corps Marathon]], the rally planners originally requested to share the portable toilets planned for the marathon runners. The marathon organizers refused, so a second set of portable toilets was ordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/stewart-colbert-rallies-looking-for-a-few-good-porta-potties/19664942?a_dgi=aolshare_facebook|title=Stewart, Colbert Rallies Looking for a Few Good Porta-Potties|date=October 7, 2010|work=AOL News|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While both Colbert and Stewart were tight-lipped as to the event's schedule and guests, [[Metromix]]'s Washington DC website published a tentative schedule on October 27, with guest performers said to be confirmed for the event including musicians [[Sheryl Crow]], [[The Roots]] and [[Jeff Tweedy]] with [[Mavis Staples]] along with actors [[Don Novello]] (appearing as [[Father Guido Sarducci]]) and [[Sam Waterston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dc.metromix.com/events/article/rally-to-restore-sanity/2268575/content|title="Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear" Schedule|publisher=Metromix|date=October 27, 2010|accessdate=October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other guests included [[4troops]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tpmlivewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/10/jon-stewart-opens-the-rally-to-restore-sanity-andor-fear-video.php|title=Jon Stewart Opens The Rally To Restore Sanity And/Or Fear (VIDEO)|publisher=TPM|date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=October 30, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101183931/http://tpmlivewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/10/jon-stewart-opens-the-rally-to-restore-sanity-andor-fear-video.php|archivedate=November 1, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yusuf Islam – formerly known as [[Cat Stevens]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[The O'Jays]],&lt;ref name=train&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/compost/2010/10/peace_trains_crazy_trains_love.html|title=Peace Trains, Crazy Trains, Love Trains and automobiles at Stewart rally|first=Alexandra|last=Petri|work=Washington Post|accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Legend]], [[Kid Rock]], [[Tony Bennett]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2010/10/30/2010-10-30_thousands_of_new_yorkers_drawn_to_stephen_colbert_jon_stewart_rally_to_restore_s.html|title=Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart 'Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear' draws thousands of New Yorkers|publisher=[[Nydailynews.com]] |date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mythbusters]]'' hosts [[Adam Savage]] and [[Jamie Hyneman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130952931|title='Sanity/Fear' Rally A Protest of the Absurd|publisher=[[NPR]] |date=|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; basketball player [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stanglin|first=Douglas|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-politics/8100978/Thousands-attend-Rally-to-Restore-Sanity-in-Washington.html|title=Thousands attend 'Rally to Restore Sanity' in Washington|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=November 1, 2010|accessdate=November 12, 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[R2-D2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/5-funniest-moments-of-the-rally-to-restore-sanity-and-or-fear/65448/|title=5 Funniest Moments of the 'Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear'|first=Nicole|last=Allan|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=February 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comedy===
Satirical comedy was woven throughout the rally with Colbert expressing, in parody, that fear was superior to Stewart's reasonableness. The theme started with Colbert—costumed like [[Evel Knievel]]—emerging from his "fear bunker" in a capsule reminiscent of the [[2010 Copiapó mining accident#Rescue|2010 Chilean miners' rescue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&amp;articleid=20101108_218_A11_TheWas66103|title=Rallying with revelry, goofiness|first=Robert|last=Evatt|newspaper=[[Tulsa World]]|date=November 8, 2010|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Colbert challenged Stewart point by point, usually claiming victory.

One of their battles was waged over three songs about trains. Stewart started with [[Yusuf Islam]] singing "[[Peace Train]]," which was interrupted continually by Colbert-backed [[Ozzy Osbourne]] singing "[[Crazy Train]]." The audience held up [[V sign#Vietnam War, victory and peace|peace signs]] for "Peace Train" and [[Sign of the horns|horn signs]] for "Crazy Train." Finally, Stewart and Colbert compromised singing "[[Love Train]]" with [[The O'Jays]].&lt;ref name=train/&gt;

Later, Stewart and Colbert donned matching American flag coats and sang an original song "The Greatest, Strongest Country in the World" with lyrics that reflected common liberal and conservative stereotypes, such as "I love [[NASCAR]] halftime shows with tons of TNT. ... My [[Hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] electric scooter does 100 [[Miles per gallon|m-p-g]]. From gay men who like football ... to straight men who like ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''..."&lt;ref name=nbc-ny&gt;{{cite web|last=Hester|first=Jere|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/entertainment/television/Boldly-Pushing-the-Bounds-of-Sanity-Fear--and-Comedy-106403678.html|publisher=[[NBC New York]]|title=Boldly Pushing the Bounds of Sanity, Fear&amp;nbsp;– and Comedy|date=November 1, 2010|accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the finale, a giant [[papier-mâché]] puppet of Colbert ("Fearzilla") was brought on stage to symbolize his superiority. [[Peter Pan]]—played by [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]]—then appeared and led the crowd in a chant that caused Colbert and his puppet to melt into the stage, thereby handing final victory to Stewart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesdelphic.com/2010/11/04/rally-to-restore-sanity|title=Rally to Restore Sanity|first=Heather|last=Hall|date=November 4, 2010|work=The Times-Delphic|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medals===
Stewart gave out "Medals of Reasonableness" cast in bronze with an image of an owl and the [[Latin language|Latin]] motto ''Sit vis nobiscum,'' liberally translated by Stewart as "[[May the Force be with you]]," to:
* [[Armando Galarraga]] for his calm response to the [[Armando Galarraga's near-perfect game|blown call that cost him a perfect game]].
* [[Mick Foley]] for his contributions outside of [[professional wrestling|wrestling]], including his defense of a child mocked for being seen as gay.
* Velma Hart for her reasoned critical questions delivered to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] at a [[town hall meeting|town hall]].
* Jacob Isom for preventing an evangelist from [[2010 Qur'an-burning controversy#Other Quran desecration incidents|burning a Qur'an]].&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite news|last=Montopoli|first=Brian|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20021281-503544.html|title=Jon Stewart Rallies for Sanity&amp;nbsp;— and Against Cable News|publisher=CBS News|date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colbert awarded "Medals of Fear" cast with an image of a naked man running with scissors and the Latin motto ''Cave ne cadmium sit,'' which Colbert translated as "Warning: May contain Cadmium," to:
* Several news media outlets, collectively, for barring employees from attending the rally on their own time.&lt;ref name=cbs /&gt;
* A "tight black T-shirt" that Colbert said belonged to CNN's [[Anderson Cooper]], for always appearing during natural disasters reported on by Cooper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/jon-stewart-stephen-colbert-put-on-a-show_b37649|title=Jon Stewart &amp; Stephen Colbert Put on a Show|publisher=Media Bistro|date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After defeating Colbert's "Fearzilla", Stewart closed the rally with a "moment... for some sincerity" to explain his intentions for the rally:&lt;ref name=crave&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/132858-metal-meets-folk-meets-soul-at-the-rally-to-restore-sanity|title=Metal Meets Folk Meets Soul at The Rally To Restore Sanity: The Roots, Ozzy, Cat Stevens, Kid Rock and more joined Jon Stewart &amp; Stephen Colbert Saturday in D.C. in a show of sanity|first=Johnny|last=Firecloud|work=Crave Online|publisher=CRAVEONLINE MEDIA, LLC|date=October 31, 2010|accessdate=November 13, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529010235/http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/132858-metal-meets-folk-meets-soul-at-the-rally-to-restore-sanity|archivedate=May 29, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This was not a rally to ridicule people of [[faith]], or people of [[activism]], or look down our noses at the [[Heartland (United States)|heartland]], or passionate argument, or to suggest that times are not difficult and that we have nothing to fear.

He criticized the role the press plays in polarizing political debates, stating that the media—which he described as "the country's [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour politico–pundit]] perpetual panic 'conflict-inator'"—only amplifies problems and no longer makes a distinction between "hav[ing] animus" and "be[ing] enemies." He warned that demonizing opponents and accepting propaganda makes people "less safe, not more" and that "it is an insult, not only to those people, but to the racists themselves who have put in the exhausting effort it takes to hate."&lt;ref name=crave/&gt;

Much of the speech was devoted to the idea that "[m]ost Americans don't live their lives solely as [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]] or [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]]." He spoke on the subject of "reasonable compromises" that happen "every day" between persons of different beliefs, citing as an example traffic merging at the entrance to the [[Holland Tunnel]] connecting [[New York City]] and [[Jersey City]].&lt;ref name=crave/&gt;

==Response to rally==
[[Keith Olbermann]] was prominently featured in a video montage shown at the rally that focused on the anger present in cable news. Two days after the rally, he decided to suspend his "Worst Person in the World" segment on ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]'' in the interest of turning down the volume and anger. However, he defended the content of his show by claiming that [[MSNBC]] (the network that hosted ''Countdown'' at the time) differs from [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] in that "sticking up for the powerless is not the moral equivalent of sticking up for the powerful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2010/11/02/2010-11-02_keith_olbermann_drops_worst_person_in_the_world_segment_on_msnbc_after_jon_stewa.html|title=Keith Olbermann drops 'Worst Persons in the World' segment on MSNBC after Jon Stewart rally|first=Aliyah|last=Shahid|work=New York Daily News|date=November 2, 2010|accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After tallying an online vote among his viewers, Olbermann announced that the segment would return on the November 17 broadcast as the "Not Really Worst Persons in the World."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/keith-olbermanns-worst-persons-suspension-returning-according-to-his-twitter-it-is_b40332|title=Keith Olbermann's 'Worst Person' Suspension Over?

On ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]],'' [[Bill Maher]] criticized the rally, saying that while Stewart and Colbert meant well, the message of the rally promoted a false equivalency between the left and the right, noting, "the big mistake of modern media has been this notion of balance for balance's sake. That the Left is just as violent and cruel as the Right...there's a difference between a mad man and a madman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=November 5, 2010|series=Real Time with Bill Maher|credits=Bill Maher|network=HBO|airdate=November 5, 2010|season=8|number=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 11, Stewart appeared on ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]'' and clarified the message he intended to convey at the rally: that too many have "bought into the idea that the conflict [in America] is left versus right" when the conflict is actually "corruption versus not-corruption" and that "both sides have their ways of shutting down debate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2010/11/11/jon-stewart-on-the-rachel-maddow-show-we-have-a-special-place-in-our-hearts-for-fox/|title=Jon Stewart on the Rachel Maddow Show: "We Have a Special Place In Our Hearts For Fox|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=November 11, 2010|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ourania "Rania" Antonopoulou''' ({{lang-el|Ουρανία Αντωνοπούλου}}; born 17 December 1960) is a [[Greek people|Greek]] [[heterodox economics|heterodox economist]] and [[Syriza]] politician. After the [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|January 2015 election]], MP Alexis Tsipras named as the 
Greek [[Ministry of Labour and Social Solidarity (Greece)|Alternate Minister for Combating Unemployment]] in [[First Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras|his cabinet]]. She remains a Syriza member. On the 5th of September 2018 she was appointed by the Greek Government as the Permanent Representative of Greece (Ambassador) to the OECD in Paris, France, entrusting her to represent the country despite the severe media attack she had been subjected to a few months earlier. Between February and August 2015, she also was a member of the [[Hellenic Parliament]].

A former macroeconomic policy adviser for [[UN Women]] and consultant [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] and the [[International Labour Office|ILO]], she is specialized in [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] [[gender studies|gender issues]] and job creation in extreme [[unemployment]]  economic environments. She is Associate Professor of Economics at New York [[Bard College]] and a senior scholar of the [[Levy Economics Institute]] where she is involved with the [[Modern Monetary Theory]] school of [[post-Keynesian economics]].

A co-initiator of the ''Economists for Full Employment'' project, she has been a long-time supporter of a [[job guarantee]] with the state being [[employer of last resort]]. Following a successful 2011 pilot project, she has been appointed Alternate Minister for Combatting Unemployment in the [[Syriza]]-led [[First Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras|Tsipras Government]]. In her ministerial office, she is specifically tasked with implementing a nationwide program to combat [[long-term unemployment]] by creating at least 300,000 new jobs for the unemployed.

==Education and early career==
When in 1997 Antonopoulou received her Ph.D. economics from the [[New School for Social Research]], she had already been teaching economics at [[New York University]] and in the same year was awarded the university's ''Teaching Excellence Award''. At New York University she taught Economics, a post she would hold until 2006.&lt;ref name=BardCV&gt;{{cite web|title=CV of Rania Antonopoulou|publisher=[[Bard College]]|url=http://www.bard.edu/academics/faculty/faculty.php?action=details&amp;id=51|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working in the fields of feminist economics, international trade, and the economics of globalization,&lt;ref name=BardCV /&gt; Antonopoulou served as macroeconomic policy adviser for [[UN Women]], and as advising consultant for the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP)&lt;ref name=LevyCV&gt;{{cite web|title=CV of Rania Antonopoulou|publisher=[[Levy Economics Institute]]|url=http://www.levyinstitute.org/scholars/rania-antonopoulou|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Labour Office]] (ILO).&lt;ref name=BardCV /&gt; In 2002, she became co-director of the ''Knowledge Networking Program on Engendering Macroeconomics and International Economics'' (GEM-IWG) and co-founded ''GEM-Europe'' and ''GEM-Turkey''.

==Academic career==
Prior to her involvement in politics, Antonopoulou served as Associate Professor of Economics at [[Bard College]] she has been affiliated with since 2001. She is also a senior scholar with the associated [[Levy Economics Institute]] and director of the ''Gender Equality and the Economy'' program.&lt;ref name=BardCV /&gt; In the last years she has further specialized in linkages of [[gender]] and [[macro economics]], in the macroeconomic impact of [[job guarantee]] policies, and in the implications of unpaid work on [[poverty indicator]]s.&lt;ref name=LevyCV /&gt;

In line with her heterodox policy oriented research, she continued working on her concept of a "[[Job guarantee]]" which she has been developing at the Levy Institute of Bard College since 2006&lt;ref name=DW&gt;{{cite web|others=(interviewer: Jasper Sky)|title='Greece's problem is lack of demand, not skills'|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|url=http://www.dw.de/greeces-problem-is-lack-of-demand-not-skills/a-18281938|date=25 February 2015|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This concept turns the state into an [[Employer of last resort]] that issues publicly funded jobs at [[minimum wage]] level to everybody unable to find a job in the [[private sector]]. When job opportunities are scarce, it is argued, public policy must ensure that the institutional means of implementation of the RIGHT TO WORK, that is, of Article 23.1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] are in place. The huge rise of [[unemployment]] following the [[Greek government-debt crisis]] and the [[austerity]] measures imposed by the Troika led the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]]-led [[Ministry of Labour and Social Solidarity (Greece)|Ministry of Labour]] into giving the concept a chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|others=(with [[Dimitri B.

==Minister for Combatting Unemployment==
When in the [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|January 2015 elections]], Antonopoulou was elected a [[Member of the Hellenic Parliament]] on Syriza's state list, new Greek prime minister [[Alexis Tsipras]] appointed her [[Ministry of Labour and Social Solidarity (Greece)|Alternate Minister for Combatting Unemployment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Government announces the new ministerial cabinet|work=[[To Vima]]|url=http://www.tovima.gr/en/article/?aid=671144|date=27 January 2015|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her portfolio also included the strengthening of the Social and Solidarity Economy sector of the economy and she is credited with the enactment of the SSE law which was voted in parliament in October 2016. Antonopoulou is the second [[Modern Monetary Theory]] scholar to assume a high-profile post in a government, following her former colleague at Bard College, [[Stephanie Kelton]], who earlier in January was appointed Chief Economist of the [[United States Senate Committee on the Budget|U.S. Senate Budget Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[L. Randall Wray]]|title=Jobs for Greeks|work=New Economic Perspectives|url=http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2015/01/jobs-greeks.html|date=28 January 2015|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her ministerial office, Antonopoulou is specifically tasked with implementing a nationwide "Job guarantee" program to combat [[long-term unemployment]], creating at least 300,000 new jobs for the unemployed.&lt;ref name=Polychroniou&gt;{{cite web|author=C. J. Polychroniou|title=Syriza Is Offering a New Deal for the People of Greece|work=[[New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/01/27/can-greeces-anti-austerity-government-succeed/syriza-is-offering-a-new-deal-for-the-people-of-greece|date=28 January 2015|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program has been described both by herself&lt;ref name=Kathimerini /&gt; and by others&lt;ref name=Polychroniou /&gt; as being a centerpiece of a "Greek [[New Deal]]" as proposed by the [[Syriza]] government.

Outlined in a Levy Institute policy paper from October 2014, the program will be built on the experience of the 2012 pilot project &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=After Austerity: Measuring the Impact of a Job Guarantee Policy for Greece|series=Public Policy Brief|issue=138|publisher=[[Levy Economics Institute]]|url=http://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/after-austerity-measuring-the-impact-of-a-job-guarantee-policy-for-greece|date=October 2014|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won't be restricted to [[reskilling]] some of the unemployed for the private sector. The program, with precedents only in the [[Unemployment in India|Indian]] [[National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005|Rural Employment Guarantee]], is rather set to create publicly funded long-term jobs to allow the unemployed fulfilling socially needed tasks at a [[minimum wage]] level.&lt;ref name=DW /&gt; In a February 2015 interview with ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', Antonopoulos pointed out that "the main problem in Greece is lack of aggregate demand and consequent lack of jobs, not lack of skills." Results of the 2012 pilot project suggested that some 500,000 of the totaling 1.3&amp;nbsp;million unemployed in Greece would be willing to take up such a minimum-wage level job.&lt;ref name=DW /&gt;

==Private life==
Prior to her arrival in Athens to join the Greek Government's cabinet in September 2015, Antonopoulou lived in [[New York City]] since 1977, and is married to her colleague at Bard College, Greek American economist [[Dimitri B. Papadimitriou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CV of Ourania Antonopoulou|publisher=[[Hellenic Parliament]]|url=http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/en/Vouleftes/Viografika-Stoicheia/?MPId=017c0708-a0df-450f-baff-a43400d37da5|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that there was no issue of legality ever raised, and, although several other cabinet members of the Syriza administration had been receiving the same subsidy benefit, her media character assassination was based on the argument that she was 'rich and did not need it'.

'''''Rethinking "Gnosticism": An Argument for Dismantling a Dubious Category''''', is a 1996 book by Michael Allen Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Michael allen|title=Rethinking "Gnosticism:" An Argument for Dismantling a Dubious Category|date=1996|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-01127-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is one of the first critical works that goes about comparing the established academic definitions of [[gnosticism]] to the texts discovered at [[Nag Hammadi library|Nag Hammadi]]. The main points of the book are that there is no established definition of "gnosticism" by people who use the term, let alone the academic world; and that the groups referred to as "gnostic" by the [[Christian]] Church [[apologist]]s referred to themselves often by their leader or leaders' names but no group referred to themselves as "gnostic" or "gnostics".

Also, Williams mentions the [[argument]] that none of the groups labeled "gnostic" shared a common set of beliefs that put them in a group together. The only things close to this would be the Christian [[heresiographical]] use of referring to these varied groups as "gnostics". As well as the varied set of interruptions of the creator of the material world ([[Yahweh]] or [[demiurge]]) by these early groups. Finally Williams clarifies that the ancient "gnosticism" of the Nag Hammadi groups and the misused "gnosticism" of moderns groups and academia have little if anything in common. Williams suggests a better and more adequate term for these [[heresy|heretical]] groups would be "biblical [[demiurge|demiurgical]] traditions".

'''Semantic translation''' is the process of using [[semantic]] information to aid in the translation of data in one representation or [[data model]] to another representation or data model.  Semantic translation takes advantage of semantics that associate meaning with individual [[data element]]s in one [[data dictionary|dictionary]] to create an equivalent meaning in a second system.

An example of semantic translation is the conversion of [[XML]] data from one data model to a second data model using formal [[ontologies]] for each system such as the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL).  This is frequently required by [[intelligent agents]] that wish to perform searches on remote computer systems that use different data models to store their data elements.  The process of allowing a single user to search multiple systems with a single search request is also known as [[federated search]].

Semantic translation should be differentiated from [[data mapping]] tools that do simple one-to-one translation of data from one system to another without actually associating meaning with each data element.

Semantic translation requires that data elements in the source and destination systems have "semantic mappings" to a central registry or registries of data elements. The simplest mapping is of course where there is equivalence.
There are three types of [[Semantic equivalence]]:

* '''[[Class (computer science)|Class]] Equivalence'''{{Anchor|Class equivalence}} - indicating that class or "concepts" are equivalent.  For example: "Person" is the same as "Individual"
* '''[[Relation (mathematics)|Property]] Equivalence'''{{Anchor|Property equivalence}} - indicating that two properties are equivalent.  For example: "PersonGivenName" is the same as "FirstName"
* '''[[Instance (computer science)|Instance]] Equivalence'''{{Anchor|Instance equivalence}} - indicating that two individual instances of objects are equivalent.  For example: "Dan Smith" is the same person as "Daniel Smith"

Semantic translation is very difficult if the terms in a particular data model do not have direct one-to-one mappings to data elements in a foreign data model. In that situation an alternative approach must be used to find mappings from the original data to the foreign data elements.  This problem can be alleviated by centralized metadata registries that use the ISO-11179 standards such as the [[National Information Exchange Model]] (NIEM).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1509">The '''Sharp Scale''' was devised by Henrietta Sharp Cockrell as an objective and scientific way to measure the [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] of paper, particularly of [[Folio|manuscript folios]], 'in the field'  without specialized equipment. A practical application of the technique could be done in a museum or library setting.  
To apply the method, the [[folio]] is first held at a distance of 15&amp;nbsp;cm from a 60 [[watt]] light source (such as an unshaded table lamp).  A [[dowel]] (or pencil) is held behind and against it, creating a [[silhouette]].  Folios are then added until the outline of the pencil is no longer visible. The number of the folios needed to obscure the silhouette of the pencil is recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Savage-Smith, 2005, p. ???&lt;/ref&gt;

:''For the eponymous town in Ukraine, see [[Sniatyn]]''
'''Sknyatino''' ({{lang-ru|Скнятино}}) is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|village]] in [[Kalyazinsky District]] of [[Tver Oblast]], [[Russia]], situated at the [[confluence (geography)|confluence]] of the [[Nerl River (Volga)|Nerl]] and the [[Volga River]]s, about halfway between [[Uglich]] and [[Tver]]. It is the site of the medieval town of '''Ksnyatin''', founded by [[Yuri Dolgoruki]] in 1134 and named after his son Constantine.
Ksnyatin was intended as a fortress to defend the Nerl waterway, leading to Yuri's residence at [[Pereslavl-Zalessky]], against [[Novgorod]]ians. The latter sacked it on several occasions, before the [[Mongol]]s virtually annihilated the settlement in 1239. After that, it belonged to the princes of Tver and was devastated by their enemies in 1288. By the 14th century, the neighbouring towns of [[Kalyazin]] and [[Kashin (town)|Kashin]] superseded it in importance. Since 1459, Ksnyatin has been documented as a  village. Its [[Kremlin (fortification)|kremlin]] area and cathedral were flooded in 1939, when they created the [[Uglich Reservoir]].

==Background==
The V-Girls were composed of Martha Baer, Jessica Chalmers, Erin Cramer, [[Marianne Weems]] and [[Andrea Fraser]]. The group was initially formed as a study group in order to meet-up and read feminist [[psychoanalytic theory]], but soon morphed into discussions of their own art and scholarship.

The V-Girls were influenced by feminist inquiry in relation to institutions, such as universities. Feminist discussions regarding power relations, the status of women, and canon development lead to the need for ways of challenging normalised phallocentric ideas.

==Performance style==
The five women would sit at a long table in order to form a discussion panel. Four of them would be dressed in suits with thickly framed glasses, symbols of traditional power and intellect. The fifth would act as the discussion's mediator and usually be dressed more casually, indicating a symbolic separation of social status. The panel would provide a comedic critique of various professional discourses within the spaces in which they originated, such as conferences, universities, art galleries and museums.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Zita Grover, "The Misrepresentation of Misrepresentation: Jan Zita Grover Turns Her Gaze on the V-Girls," The Women's Review of Books 6, no. 10/11 (1989): 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key works==
The V-Girls first performance was titled ''Sex and Your Holiday Season'' and was performed in 1987 at Four Walls gallery in New Jersey.

''Academic in the Alps: In Search of the Swiss Miss(s)'' took place in 1988 at the [[University of Massachusetts]].

''The Question of Manet's Olympia: Posed and Skirted'' was first performed in 1989.

'''''Thirteen Days: A Memoir of the Cuban Missile Crisis''''' is [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s account of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962. The book was released in 1969, a year after [[Robert F. Kennedy assassination|his assassination]].&lt;ref&gt;Haruya Anami, "'Thirteen Days' Thirty Years After: Robert Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis Revisited," ''Journal of American &amp; Canadian Studies'' (1994) Issue 12, pp 69-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Thirteen Days'' describes the meetings held by the Executive Committee ([[ExComm]]), the team assembled by US President [[John F. Kennedy]] to handle the tense situation that developed between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] following the discovery of Soviet [[nuclear missiles]] in [[Cuba]], {{convert|90|mi}} from [[Florida]]. Robert Kennedy, who was the [[US Attorney General]] at the time, describes his brother John's leadership style during the crisis as involved, but not controlling. Robert Kennedy viewed the military leaders on the council sympathetically, and recognized that their lifelong concentration on war was difficult to set aside.

The book was used as the basis for the 1974 television play ''[[The Missiles of October]]''. In 2000, the theatrical film ''[[Thirteen Days (film)|Thirteen Days]]'' was produced using the same title, but based on an entirely different book, ''The Kennedy Tapes: Inside the White House During the Cuban Missile Crisis'' by [[Ernest May (historian)|Ernest May]] and [[Philip Zelikow]]. That book contained some information that Kennedy was not able to reveal because it was classified at the time.

'''Tikal Temple II''' (or the '''Temple of the Masks''', alternatively labelled by archaeologists as '''Tikal Structure 5D-2''') is a [[Mesoamerican pyramids|Mesoamerican pyramid]] at the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] archaeological site of [[Tikal]] in the [[Petén Department]] of northern [[Guatemala]]. The temple was built in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic Period]] in a style reminiscent of the Early Classic.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.303.&lt;/ref&gt; Temple II is located on the west side of the Great Plaza, opposite [[Tikal Temple I|Temple I]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.303.&lt;/ref&gt; Temple II was built by the king [[Jasaw Chan K'awiil I]] in honour of his wife, [[Lady Twelve Macaw|Lady Kalajuun Une' Mo']].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp. 395, 397.&lt;/ref&gt; Temple II had a single wooden sculpted lintel that bears the portrait of a royal woman who may have been the wife of Jasaw Chan K'awiil I, who was entombed beneath Temple I.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.303. Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Kalajuun Une' Mo', whose name means "Twelve [[Macaw]] Tails", was also important for being the mother of Jasaw Chan K'awill I's heir.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.46.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact her son [[Yik'in Chan K'awiil]] oversaw the completion of Temple II when he became king.&lt;ref&gt;Drew 1999, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple II was visited by Modesto Méndez, the governor of Petén, in 1848 on the first expedition to the ruins.&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz Cosme &amp; Vidal Lorenzo 1998, pp. 11, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary excavations of Temple II started in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1962, p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 December 2012, more than 7,000 tourists visited Tikal to celebrate the [[2012 phenomenon]] and the supposed end of the world. Many of these tourists climbed the stairs of the pyramid, causing reported damages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-12-24/mayan-temple-damaged-by-end-of-the-world-tourists/4442656 ABC News]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The structure==
The pyramid is a squat, massive structure dating to the 8th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.46. Miller 1999, pp.32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Today it stands {{convert|125|ft|m|disp=flip}} high and is the most thoroughly restored of the major temples at Tikal.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.134. Coe 1867, 1988, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; Its original height would have been closer to {{convert|42|m|ft}} including its [[roof comb]].&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1867, 1988, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; The main stairway is {{convert|10.4|m|ft}} wide and projects {{convert|7.45|m|ft}} from the pyramid base.&lt;ref&gt;Gómez 1998, p.63.&lt;/ref&gt; The base of the pyramid measures {{convert|37.6|by|41|m|ft}}, covering a surface area of {{convert|1542|m2|sqft}}.&lt;ref&gt;Gómez 1998, p.60.&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations inside Temple II failed to discover Lady Kalajuun Une' Mo's tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.46.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient graffiti within the temple shrine depicts a captive upon a platform and bound between two poles being sacrificed with an arrow or a spear.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp.752–753.&lt;/ref&gt; Further ancient graffiti includes images of temples.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1867, 1988, pp.36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this graffiti dates to the Classic Period, although other examples appear to date to the Early Postclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1867, 1988, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; The interior walls have also been defaced with modern graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1867, 1988, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of ritual use in the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Postclassic period|Postclassic Period]] was found within the temple shrine, including burials and offerings.&lt;ref&gt;Valdés &amp; Fahsen 2005, p.153.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cyark Tikal Temple II 3D.jpg|thumb|right|Laser scan projection of Temple II]]
The pyramid rises in three stepped levels; upon the uppermost level is a wide platform supporting the summit shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1867, 1988, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; The first level measures {{convert|6.25|m|ft}} high, the second is {{convert|6.1|m|ft}} high and the third level stands {{convert|5.6|m|ft}} high, giving an average height of {{convert|5.98|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;Gómez 1998, p.60.&lt;/ref&gt; The total height of the pyramidal base is {{convert|17.9|m|ft}}, the summit shrine measures {{convert|9.8|m|ft}} high and the roof comb {{convert|12.3|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;Gómez 1998, p.60.&lt;/ref&gt; Two badly eroded giant masks adorn the upper platform, flanking the stairway to the shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1867, 1988, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; These grotesque masks decorating the pyramid's facade give Temple II its alternative name of the Temple of the Masks.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1867, 1988, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; A large block of masonry was built into the stairway immediately outside the entrance to the shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1867, 1988, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; this block may have served as an observation platform allowing the officiating priests to see the crowd in the plaza below and in turn be seen by the people there.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1867, 1988, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The roof comb of the temple is highly ornate and bears the sculpture of a face with circular [[Plug (jewellery)|earspools]].&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1867, 1988, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; Various sealed chambers exist within the roof comb.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1867, 1988, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple shrine upon the summit of the pyramid contains three chambers, the doorways of which were spanned by lintels.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.134.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the lintel over the middle doorway was carved.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.134.&lt;/ref&gt; The lintel consisted of five wooden beams, one of which is now in the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.134.&lt;/ref&gt; When excavated the lintels had fallen from their original positions and have been restored.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1867, 1988, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the base of the main access stairway stands [[Stele|Stela]] P-83, which was plain, without sculpted decoration or [[Maya script|hieroglyphic texts]].&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1867, 1988, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; The stela stands {{convert|3.34|m|ft}} high and was broken but has been restored.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1867, 1988, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with its respective altar.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1867, 1988, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; The distance from the base of the main stairway of Temple II, across the plaza to the base of the stairway of Temple I directly opposite is {{convert|70|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz Cosme &amp; Vidal Lorenzo 1998, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tulum Stela 1''' is the name of a [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] engraved monolith that was found at the ancient Mesoamerican site of [[Tulum]] in [[Mexico]]. Known for its important inscription, the stela was purchased by the [[British Museum]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=657463&amp;partId=1&amp;place=13448&amp;plaA=13448-3-1&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
The large stone [[stela]] portrays in low relief a standing Maya lord in full [[regalia]], with a long inscription in [[Mayan hieroglyphs]] framing the image. The headdress is that of [[K'awiil]], the skirt that of the [[Tonsured Maize God]]. The pillar was badly damaged when discovered and is missing parts of the base. The condition of the extant carving has also faded through water [[erosion]]. The long [[inscription]] includes a date that corresponds to 564 AD, based on the [[Maya calendar|Mayan system of recording time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Places/Place/661227 | title=Tulum | publisher=ancientworlds.net | accessdate=November 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Stela 1 was found by [[John Lloyd Stephens]] and [[Frederick Catherwood]] during their exploration  of the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] peninsular in the early nineteenth century. It was discovered near the 'Temple of the Initial Series' which lies to the south of the main castle at Tulum. This temple was named after Stela 1 as its Mayan inscription has the earliest recorded date in [[Tulum]]. Archaeologists estimate that most of Tulum is [[Post-Classic stage|Post-Classic]] and that the city was largely built after 900 AD. As this stela predates this phase, it has been conjectured that it was moved from a neighbouring Maya city, perhaps [[Coba]]. The stela was subsequently owned by the British archaeologist [[Thomas Gann]], who sold it to the British Museum in 1924.

'''Vatroslav Jagić''' ({{IPA-sh|ʋǎtroslaʋ jǎːɡitɕ|pron}}; July 6, 1838 &amp;ndash; August 5, 1923) was a prominent [[Croat]]ian scholar of [[Slavic studies]] in the second half of the 19th century.

==Life==
Jagić was born in [[Varaždin]] (then known by its [[German language|German]] name of ''Warasdin''), where he attended the elementary school and is the place where he started his secondary-school education. He finished that level of education at the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in [[Zagreb]]. Having a particular interest in [[philology]], he moved to [[Vienna]], where he was lectured in Slavic studies under the guidance of [[Franc Miklošič]]. He continued his studies and defended his [[doctoral dissertation]] ''Das Leben der Wurzel 'dê in Croatischen Sprachen''  in [[Leipzig]] ([[Germany]]) in 1871.

Upon finishing his studies, Jagić returned to Zagreb, where from 1860 to 1870 he held the position of [[professor]] at a Croatian high school.

In 1869, Jagić was elected a full member of the [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (now named the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts), and a correspondent member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Next year, 1871, he became a professor of Slavic studies at [[Odessa University]] (Novorossiysk University) and worked also in [[Berlin]], where he moved in 1874 to become the very first professor of Slavic studies at the prestigious [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin]]. Jagić held this post until 1880, when he moved again and became teacher at the [[University of St Petersburg]].

In 1886, he returned to Vienna, where his studies started to be a replacement for retiring former lecturer Miklošič at the [[University of Vienna]]. Here he taught, did research, and published until his own retirement in 1908.

Jagić died in Vienna but was laid to rest in his native Varaždin.

==Works==
Works on [[literature]] and language written by Jagić started to be published for the first time in the reports of the high school where he worked. In 1863, with his fellow researchers [[Josip Torbar (scientist)|Josip Torbar]] and [[Franjo Racki|Franjo Rački]] he launched the journal ''Književnik''. In this journal, he published several articles regarding the problematic of the grammar, syntax, as well that one of history of the language used by [[Croats]]. His works were noticed within the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (JAZU), founded in Croatia in 1866. His works and polemics were mainly related to verbs, [[paleography]], [[Speech production|vocalization]] of the language, folk poetry, and its sources. At that time he also started publishing a collection of the works written by old Croatian writers.

In Berlin, he started publishing the ''[[Archiv für slavische Philologie]]'' (Archive for Slavic Philology), and kept editing it for 45 years. The periodical focused the attention of scholars and the general public on the [[Slavs]], increasing their interest in Slavic languages and their culture. It also confirmed the importance of Slavic studies, its methodology, and its validity as a scholarly discipline.

While in Vienna, his intention was to write an encyclopedia related to the philology of the Slavs. This idea caused him to write ''Istorija slavjanskoj filologii'' ("History of Slavic philology"). This book was published in St. Petersburg in 1910 and contains the retrospective on the development of Slavic studies from the beginning to the end of the 19th century.

Jagić's work is impressive in scope and quality: Croatian linguist [[Josip Hamm]] has remarked that Jagić's collected works would, put together, number more than 100 volumes of large format.

Among his most famous students were the Polish Slavic specialist [[Aleksander Brückner]] and the Ukrainian poet and scholar [[Ivan Franko]].

==Interests==
He was very interested in [[Old Church Slavic]], and he concluded and proved that it did not originate in the central plains of [[Pannonia]], as most experts claimed, but in southern [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. Jagić was interested in the life and work of [[Juraj Križanić]] (1618–1683), a Dominican priest that had shown considerable interest in [[Pan-Slavism]] and cooperation between Catholicism and Orthodoxy.

'''Wadi Jilat''' is a seasonal stream (''[[wadi]]'') in the [[Badia (region)|Badia]] of eastern [[Jordan]]. Part of its course runs through a steeply-[[River incision|incised]] [[ravine]] that retains water for much of the year, an unusual feature in the desert region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/research/projects/azraq|title=The Azraq Basin Project|last=Garrard|first=Andrew|date=|website=UCL Institute of Archaeology|publisher=University College London|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area is known for its [[Archaeology|archaeological]] significance, including a still-functioning [[Dam|dammed]] [[reservoir]] that may date back as far as the [[Nabataeans|Nabataean period]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Politis|first=Konstantinos D.|date=1993|title=The Stepped Dam at Wadi El-Jilat|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1179/peq.1993.125.1.43|journal=Palestine Exploration Quarterly|volume=125|issue=1|pages=43–49|doi=10.1179/peq.1993.125.1.43|issn=0031-0328|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thirty two [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] sites discovered by [[Andrew Garrard]] in the 1970s–80s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=36-mAwAAQBAJ|title=Beyond the Fertile Crescent: Late Palaeolithic and Neolithic Communities of the Jordanian Steppe|last=Garrard|first=Andrew|last2=Byrd|first2=Brian|date=2013|publisher=Oxbow Books|year=|isbn=978-1-842-17833-1|series=Levant Supplementary Series 13|location=Oxford|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
