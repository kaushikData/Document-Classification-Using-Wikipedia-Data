'''425 Market Street''' is an [[office]] [[skyscraper]] located on the corner of [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market]] and Fremont Streets in the [[Financial District (San Francisco)|financial district]] of [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. The {{convert|160|m|abbr=on}}, 38 [[Storey|floor]] office tower was completed in 1973. It was built by the [[Metropolitan Life]] Insurance Company as their "Pacific Coast Headquarters" and was called "1 Metropolitan Plaza". It was built as a modern replacement for their older headquarters on Nob Hill at 600 [[Stockton Street (San Francisco)|Stockton Street]] (now remodeled as the Ritz-Carlton Hotel). It was among the first buildings in San Francisco to have a high-speed transport system (a glorified [[dumb waiter]]) for computer data cards, files and inner-office mail, at the time a state-of-the-art system.{{Citation needed|date = February 2015}}

Its largest tenant today{{When|date=February 2015}} is [[law firm]] [[Morrison &amp; Foerster LLP]], one of the original tenants when the building first opened.{{Citation needed|date = February 2015}} The building is partially owned by the [[Government Pension Fund of Norway]], who according to their 2015 report&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbim.no/en/the-fund/holdings/|title=Holdings|website=www.nbim.no|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; owns 47.5%.

When this station opened on July 10, 1919,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AINOAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=18th+avenue+culver+line&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7pf-1k87PAhUBXT4KHdbZCbwQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=18th%20avenue%20culver%20line&amp;f=false|title=Legislative Documents|date=January 1, 1920|publisher=J.B. Lyon Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the BMT Broadway Line had ended north of this station as six trackways, of which only two tracks (local tracks) continued to the [[60th Street Tunnel]] to Queens. The other four trackways, both the express tracks and the outermost trackways (both of the outermost trackways are ramps which have never been used) curve slightly west before ending, which were a provision for the line to run to Upper Manhattan via Central Park West.&lt;ref name="nycsubway.org"&gt;http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/New_Subways:_Proposed_Additions_to_Rapid_Transit_System..._(1922) "Section on Broadway Subway Expansion"&lt;/ref&gt;

With four tracks and two [[island platform]]s, this station is the northernmost express station on the BMT Broadway Line. Much of the BMT system is [[New York City Subway chaining|chained]] from the zero point here. The '''N''', '''R''', and '''W''' trains use the local tracks, which continue north under 59th and 60th Streets to [[Queens]], while '''Q''' trains, limited weekday rush hour '''N''' trains and one weekday a.m. rush hour '''R''' train use the center express tracks to continue north along the [[BMT 63rd Street Line]] to [[Lexington Avenue–63rd Street (BMT 63rd Street Line)|Lexington Avenue–63rd Street]] and the [[Second Avenue Subway]]. Before the BMT 63rd Street Line was built in 1989, the express tracks continued as layup spurs north of the station (although construction of the 63rd Street line from 1971 to 1978 continued the section between this station and Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station). The express tracks ran for about 400 feet.

North of the station, the local tracks continue into the 60th Street Tunnel to Queens, while the express tracks continue to 63rd Street, with switches to the 60th Street tunnel. South of the station, there are also crossovers between the two express tracks, between both northbound tracks, and between both southbound tracks.&lt;ref name="tracks"&gt;{{NYCS const|trackref|nycs|3=http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/caption.pl?/img/trackmap/detail-47-63.png}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This station underwent an overhaul in the late 1970s, which included fixing the station's structure and replacing the original wall tiles, old signs, and incandescent lighting with 1970s modern-look wall tile band and tablet mosaics, signs and fluorescent lights. Staircases and platform edges were also repaired.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

=== Elevators ===
In 1992–1993, the station received a major overhaul with state-of-the-art repairs as well as upgrading the station for [[ADA compliance]]. The original late 1910s tiling was restored, repairs were made to the staircases, new tiling on the floors, upgrades to the station's lights and public address system, installation of ADA safety treads along the platform edge, new signs, and new trackbeds in both directions. Accessibility to the mezzanine was further increased by the addition of a usable elevator on the southwest corner of 57th Street. While elevators have yet to be installed for platform access, it allows disabled access to the fare booth and [[MetroCard (New York City)|MetroCard]] vending machines. The MTA intends to provide ADA access to the platforms as part of the 2010–2014 Capital Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweeklynabe.com/2013/06/13/mta-key-station-plan-subway-accessibility/|title=The MTA’s Key Station Plan for subway accessibility - The Weekly Nabe|last=|first=|date=June 13, 2013|work=The Weekly Nabe|access-date=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elevators to the platforms have been under design for several years, with the MTA originally planning to award contracts in November 2013,&lt;ref name="MTA-TB-Committee-Feb2018"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/180220_1000_Transit.pdf|title=Transit and Bus Committee Meeting February 2018|last=|first=|date=February 20, 2018|website=|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|access-date=February 18, 2018|page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the design process was delayed several years due to preexisting utilities blocking the way of the proposed elevator access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Capital Program Oversight Committee Meeting|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/170724_1345_CPOC.pdf|website=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]]|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=August 31, 2017|date=July 24, 2017|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other issues included [[asbestos]] abatement, the lack of available space underground for the expansion of the mezzanine, and the need to negotiate with another developer to install elevators. The MTA started working on a revised design in September 2015. The construction award, and the beginning of construction was finally awarded in December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/capitaldashboard/allframenew_head.html?PROJNUM=t6041311&amp;PLTYPE=1|title=T6041311 ADA Accessibility at 57 St Station on the Broadway Line - Phase 2|last=|first=|date=|website=web.mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the location of the platform elevators was moved to the southern end of the station, near 55th Street, necessitating the installation of a new street-to-mezzanine elevator at 55th Street.&lt;ref name="MTA-TB-Committee-Feb2018" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fox5ny.com/news/midtown-shops-subway-elevator-construction|title=Midtown shops worry about subway elevator construction|last=Schmidt|first=Linda|date=April 26, 2018|work=WNYW|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial completion is projected for February 2021.&lt;ref name="MTA-CPOC-Nov2018"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/181113_1400_CPOC.pdf|title=Capital Program Oversight Committee Meeting November 2018|date=November 13, 2018|accessdate=November 10, 2018|page=90|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company figured that if they built ramps from the Broadway line that could naturally be extended to an Eighth Avenue line, they would get a toehold on being awarded that line, rather than lose out to the IRT, the only other subway operator when the Dual Contracts were built.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XEA8AQAAMAAJ|title=Documents of the Senate of the State of New York|last=Senate|first=New York (State) Legislature|date=January 1, 1916|publisher=E. Croswell|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BMT / BRT never built that line for various reasons including the bankruptcy of the company after the [[Malbone Street Wreck]] and Mayor Hylan's plan to include the Eighth Avenue / CPW route in the [[Independent Subway System|IND]] system. The ramps were built but never used for revenue service. They were eventually used for storage until the tracks were disconnected.

The disused trackways for the proposed line ramp up and run for about 500 feet.

The ramp on the northbound side has a Maintenance-of-Way shed built on it,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=BMT7thAvenueExpress|title=RFW of The Queens Bound R Part 6: 23rd Street to Lexington Avenue|date=August 31, 2009|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sToFk6_5Eo&amp;feature=related|accessdate=February 16, 2018}} ''The shed is visible to the right at the 5:15 mark in the video, as the train leaves the 57th Street station.''&lt;/ref&gt; and the trackway on the southbound side also has a storage shed sitting in it, just north of where the local tracks come in, but this shed is few hundred feet north of the shed on the opposite trackway of the other side of the tunnel.

Some of the actual track on the trackways remain, but are covered by many years of dirt. They can be seen from passing trains. The never-used trackways curve slightly west before ending.&lt;ref name="nycsubway.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ltvsquad.com/2005/06/19/the-bmt-provision/|title=The BMT Provision|last=Anastasio|first=Joe|date=June 19, 2005|work=LTV Squad|access-date=February 16, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adam Alexander Crozier''' (born 26 January 1964) is a Scottish businessman, and was former chief executive officer of media company [[ITV plc]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=20989502&amp;ticker=ITV:LN&amp;previousCapId=679529&amp;previousTitle=DAILY%20MAIL%26GENERAL%20TST-A%20NV |title=Adam Crozier: Executive Profile &amp; Biography – Businessweek|work=investing.businessweek.com|accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; operator of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] television network covering most of the United Kingdom. 

After a career at [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] culminating with the post of joint chief executive 1995, he came to wide public prominence as the new chief executive of [[The Football Association]] in 2000 at the age of 35, before in 2003 becoming the chief executive of the [[Royal Mail Group]], the United Kingdom's mail delivery service, where he oversaw a controversial modernisation and redundancy programme.  

In January 2010 he was announced as the new chief executive of ITV plc, where he arrived on 26 April 2010. Crozier announced he was leaving this post in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kollewe|first=Julia|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/may/03/itv-chief-executive-adam-crozier-steps-down|title=ITV chief executive Adam Crozier steps down after seven years|work=The Guardian|date=3 May 2017|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Crozier was born and raised on the [[Isle of Bute]] on the west coast of Scotland in 1964.&lt;ref name=GuardianMay2007&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/11/postalservice Sharp suit with an iron hand in a woolly glove] ''Guardian'', 11 May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-77957488.html | title=Rothesay (Town of the Week) | work=[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]] | date=12 November 2000 | accessdate=10 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a manager for [[John Crichton-Stuart, 6th Marquess of Bute|Lord Bute]], and his mother was secretary to the managing director of ''[[The Scotsman]]''. Crozier went to a school in [[Ayr]], before moving to [[Graeme High School]], a comprehensive school in [[Falkirk]].&lt;ref name=GuardianMay2007/&gt; He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree (BA) in business organisation from [[Edinburgh]]'s [[Heriot-Watt University]].&lt;ref name=GuardianMay2007/&gt; While at school, Crozier had trials with both [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] and [[Stirling Albion F.C.|Stirling Albion]] football clubs.&lt;ref name=GuardianMay2007/&gt;

Crozier received an Honorary Doctorate from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/annual-review/2005/people-lynn2.html |title=Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh &amp; Scottish Borders: Annual Review 2004 |website=www1.hw.ac.uk |access-date=2016-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413072617/http://www1.hw.ac.uk/annual-review/2005/people-lynn2.html |archivedate=13 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
Crozier joined [[Pedigree Petfoods]] as a graduate trainee in 1984. In 1986, he moved to the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' to work in media sales.&lt;ref name=GuardianMay2007/&gt;

===Saatchi &amp; Saatchi===
From 1988 to 1999 Crozier worked for advertising agency [[Saatchi and Saatchi]], becoming media director in 1990, and then being appointed as joint chief executive from 1995 alongside [[Tamara Ingram]].&lt;ref name=GuardianMay2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=RoyalMailProfile/&gt; This occurred in the wake of the departure of the founding Saatchi brothers to form [[M&amp;C Saatchi]].&lt;ref name=GuardianMay2007/&gt;

===Football Association===
Crozier came to public attention as the surprise appointment to the role of chief executive of [[The Football Association]], the governing body of [[Football in England|England's national game, football]], aged just 35 and having had no experience of business in football.&lt;ref name=BBCProfile17Sep03&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3115098.stm | title=Profile: Adam Crozier | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=17 September 2003 | accessdate=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He replaced [[Graham Kelly (football)|Graham Kelly]]. In his short tenure from 2000 to 2002, the FA relocated headquarters from [[Lancaster Gate]] to [[Soho Square]], appointed the first ever foreign [[England national football team|England national team]] manager, Swede [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]], and became a more commercial organisation, maximising its revenues. He also reduced the average age of the FA's staff from 55 to 32, progressed the [[Wembley Stadium]] redevelopment, and reduced the FA's ruling body from a 91-member FA Board to a committee of 12.&lt;ref name=GuardianMay2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCProfile17Sep03/&gt; His moves were not without criticism, with complaints from some about lack of consultation and of acting beyond his powers.&lt;ref name=BBCProfile17Sep03/&gt; He was replaced by [[Mark Palios]].

While at the FA, Crozier reportedly identified some members of the England national team as the [[Golden Generation]].&lt;ref name=TelegraphGoldenGenerationNeville/&gt; It was a term later criticised towards the end of the decade by some England players as having been undeserved, and of causing undue expectations and pressure due to the fact they had at the time, and in years since, failed to win major tournaments.&lt;ref name=TelegraphGoldenGenerationNeville&gt;{{cite news

===Royal Mail===
Crozier became the chief executive of the [[Royal Mail|Royal Mail Group]] in February 2003.&lt;ref name=RoyalMailProfile/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCRecordProfit&gt;

  | accessdate = 23 May 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Entering the post, Crozier described his remit as the "biggest corporate turnaround programme in the UK".&lt;ref name=BBCProfile17Sep03/&gt; Crozier initiated a programme of modernisation and reform, to deal with changes in the service brought about by reforms beginning with the [[Postal Services Act 2000]].&lt;ref name=BBCRecordProfit/&gt;

In Crozier's first three years, the Royal Mail division produced record annual profits of £537m in May 2005, making £2m a day in profits, up from £1.5m a day losses before he joined.&lt;ref name="BBC3mPacket"/&gt; The Group overall had been transformed from recording losses of £1.1bn at the start of the turnaround plan in 2002 into a profit of £355m in 2005.&lt;ref name=GuardianMay2007/&gt; Royal Mail chairman [[Allan Leighton]] said it was a "fantastic turnaround" but also that there was still "a huge amount to do".&lt;ref name="BBC3mPacket"/&gt; The newly formed mail regulator [[Postwatch]] were however critical that it had failed to achieve 11 of its 15 licence targets during the previous financial year.&lt;ref name=BBCRecordProfit/&gt; As the postal service was opened up to competition in early 2006, Royal Mail recorded losses of £10m in 2006 and £279m in 2007.&lt;ref name="BBC3mPacket"/&gt;

His reforms included highly controversial large scale post office closures in the thousands, layoffs of Royal Mail staff, changes in working practices, and the ending of the second daily delivery and moving the first daily delivery to later in the day.&lt;ref name=GuardianMay2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianMay2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC3mPacket"&gt;.

&lt;/ref&gt; While at the Royal Mail, Crozier's salary, one of the largest in the country for the head of a publicly owned body, was criticised in light of the changes being made to the Royal Mail workforce.&lt;ref name="BBC3mPacket"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TelegraphHighestPaid/&gt;&lt;ref name=TelegraphRewardingFailure/&gt; Ongoing reforms eventually led to large scale industrial disputes and strike action in both [[2007 Royal Mail industrial disputes|2007]] and [[2009 Royal Mail industrial disputes|2009 onwards]].

===ITV plc.===
On 28 January 2010, it was announced Crozier would be leaving the Royal Mail later in 2010 to become the next permanent chief executive of media group [[ITV plc]].&lt;ref name=RoyalMailCrozierLeaves&gt;[http://www.news.royalmailgroup.com/news/article.asp?id=2663&amp;brand=royal_mail_group Adam Crozier to leave Royal Mail later this year to join ITV] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715205535/http://www.news.royalmailgroup.com/news/article.asp?id=2663&amp;brand=royal_mail_group |date=15 July 2011 }} Royal Mail Group, 28 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCITVAppoints&gt;

ITV plc., is one of three partners within ITV Network Limited, the not for profit organisation which runs the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] television network, the United Kingdom's first commercial network effectively created under the [[Television Act 1954]]. Crozier was replacing [[Michael Grade]], who announced his intention to leave in April 2009.&lt;ref name=BBCITVAppoints/&gt; Crozier was given the task of increasing ITV's advertising revenues which had fallen with the proliferation of new channels in the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British television]] market.&lt;ref name=BBCITVAppoints/&gt; On announcing the appointment, ITV chairman [[Archie Norman (businessman)|Archie Norman]] said of Crozier that he is a "very strong leader with a great track record in delivering transformational change".&lt;ref name=BBCITVAppoints/&gt;

===Other roles===
Crozier is also a board member of [[Camelot Group]], the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] operator, and the [[Debenhams]] retail chain.&lt;ref name=RoyalMailProfile&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalmailgroup.com/portal/rmg/content1;jsessionid=DQMRGET2JBAQYFB2IGVERWQUHRA0WQ2K?catId=23200554&amp;mediaId=23200558 |title=Profile: Adam Crozier |publisher=[[Royal Mail]] |accessdate=28 January 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also member of the President's Committee of the [[Confederation of British Industry]] (CBI).&lt;ref name=RoyalMailProfile/&gt;

==Personal life==
Crozier is married to Annette, whom he met while working for [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi|Saatchi and Saatchi]], and has two children.&lt;ref name=GuardianMay2007/&gt; Despite having taken on high-profile jobs involving pressing through major upheavals, he is described as "softly spoken" and has previously said of the spotlight, "I hate it, absolutely hate it. The bizarre thing about the last three jobs I've done is that I don't like [the public profile] at all. I will go to enormous lengths not to do public things – because it is just not me."&lt;ref name=GuardianMay2007/&gt;

'''Ali Shafizadeh''' ({{lang-fa|علی شفیعی زاده}}) is an [[Iran]]ian businessman.

==Business career==

===Esteghlal Ahvaz===
He is the owner of [[Iran's Premier Football League]] club [[Esteghlal Ahvaz F.C.]] who he bought in 2002.

Over the years he has bought numerous players for substantial fees, including [[Adriano Alves]], [[Abdul-Wahab Abu Al-Hail]] and [[Saša Ilić (born 1970)|Saša Ilić]], and coaches such as [[Croats|Croatian]] [[Luka Bonačić]] and [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[Srđan Gemaljević]]. In 2004 Shafizadeh put a $5 million unsuccessful bid to bring [[Brazil]]ian superstar [[Rivaldo]] to the [[Takhti Stadium (Ahvaz)|Takhti Stadium.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shafizadeh sparked much controversy on February 15, 2007 when he announced [[Esteghlal Ahvaz F.C.]] were to withdraw from [[Iran's Premier Football League|IPL]]. However, the team appeared two days later in a league match against [[Persepolis F.C.]] which ended 1-0 to [[Esteghlal Ahvaz F.C.|Esteghlal Ahvaz]], dismissing these claims and led people to believe it was all tactical games before one of the biggest games of their season versus Persepolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=234176|title=Iran: Esteghlal Threaten To Quit League|publisher=goal.com|accessdate=2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esteghlal Kish===
Shafizadeh also owned the [[Azadegan League]] club [[Esteghlal Kish F.C.]], which is based in [[Kish Island]] in the [[Persian Gulf]], from 2002 to 2006, until it was bought by [[Shahrdari Bandar Abbas F.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irankicks.com/newscast/data/fullstory/EEVVlFZkFExtKHgeOP.php

}}
'''Andrei Mocioni de Foen''' (also spelled '''Andrea de Mocioni''' or '''Andreiu Mocionĭ''', last name also '''Mocsonyi''', '''Mocsoni''', '''Mocionyi''' or '''Mocsony'''; {{lang-de|Andreas Mocioni de Foen}} or ''Andreas von Mocsonyi'', {{lang-hu|fényi Mocsonyi András}}; June 27, 1812 – April 23/May 5, 1880) was an [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Hungarian]] jurist, politician, and informal leader of the [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] community, one of the founding members of the [[Romanian Academy]]. Of a mixed [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] and [[Albanians|Albanian]] background, raised as a [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox]], he belonged to the [[Mocioni family]], which had been elevated to [[Hungarian nobility]]. He was brought up at his family estate in the [[Banat]], at [[Foeni]], where he joined the administrative apparatus, and identified as a Romanian since at least the 1830s. He rose to prominence during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]]: he was a supporter of the [[House of Lorraine]], trying to obtain increased autonomy for Banat Romanians in exchange for loyalism. The Austrians appointed Mocioni to an executive position over that region, but curbed his expectations by including the Banat as a whole into the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar|Voivodeship of Serbia]]. This disappointment pushed Mocioni to renounce politics during much of the 1850s.

The attempt by Austria to ensure a new administrative formula in the 1860s saw Mocioni's co-option into the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Diet]]. He also organized, in 1860, a National Assembly in the Banat, an abortive project seeking to obtain autonomy on ethnic grounds. He then oscillated between [[ethnic federalism]] within a nominal Hungarian realm and full centralism in Austria's custody, while failing in his bid to promote [[election boycott]] as a political weapon. He had noted political rivalries with Romanians who sided with [[Liberalism and radicalism in Hungary|Hungarian radicalism]], in particular [[Eftimie Murgu]]. Serving one full term in the [[Diet of Hungary]], Mocioni also turned to cooperation with the Romanians of [[Principality of Transylvania (1711–1867)|Transylvania]], and helped [[Andrei Șaguna]] to reestablish an independent [[Metropolis of Transylvania|Transylvanian Metropolis]] for Romanian Orthodox Christians. Alongside his brothers [[Gheorghe Mocioni|Gheorghe]] and [[Anton Mocioni|Anton]], and his lawyer [[Vincențiu Babeș]], he founded the newspaper ''Albina'' of [[Vienna]].

The creation of [[Austria-Hungary]] and the Banat's absorption into the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen]] were significant blows for Mocioni's nationalist-loyalist campaign. Mocioni withdrew to Foeni, ailing and out of the public eye for the final decade of his life. He was still a noted philanthropist and sponsor of the Romanian press, but had conflicts with [[Krassó County]] voters and the Romanian peasants on his estates, a matter which contributed to his voluntary isolation. He was survived by his wife Laura, daughter of [[Petar Čarnojević]], and by his nephew, the politician [[Alexandru Mocioni]].

==Biography==
===Origins and early life===
The Mocionis were probably descended from Petru Mucină, an Aromanian (or "Macedo-Romanian") priest from [[Aspropotamos, Trikala|Aspropotamos in Thessaly]] or [[Moscopole]], who declared loyalty to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and served in the [[Great Turkish War]].&lt;ref&gt;Colta, p. 66; Deheleanu, p. 216. See also Bugariu, p. 399&lt;/ref&gt; He and one of his brothers were killed in action somewhere in the Banat.&lt;ref&gt;Deheleanu, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archpriest]] Constantin Mocioni, or "Constantinus Motsonyi", who may have been Mucină's son, settled among the Greek Orthodox (Greek, Romanian, and Aromanian) community of [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] in the 1740s.&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, pp. 213–214; Colta, p. 66; Deheleanu, pp. 216–217&lt;/ref&gt; Family documents suggest that he was originally from Moscopole, and that he died at 110 years of age; under his watch, the family established lucrative businesses and began purchasing estates in Hungary and the Banat.&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, pp. 22–23, 112, 213–214; Deheleanu, pp. 216–217; Tiron, pp. 28–29, 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; His two sons Andrei and Mihai were raised into the nobility by [[King of Hungary|King-Emperor]] [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]: the former in February 1783, the latter in June 1798, after distinguished service in the [[War of the First Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, pp. 214–215; Colta, pp. 66–67, 83; Deheleanu, p. 217; Tiron, pp. 31–35&lt;/ref&gt; The Mocionis were thus one of some 200 Aromanian families to receive titles, and became integrated with the 12,500 Romanian noble families attested in Hungary by 1800 (from a total 340,000).&lt;ref&gt;Tiron, pp. 29, 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrei the elder was killed in mysterious circumstances before he could receive his diploma, but this was granted to his wife.&lt;ref name="stbconac"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ștefan Both, [http://adevarul.ro/locale/timisoara/foto-si-au-batut-joc-conacul-familiei-mocioni-foeni-fost-rand-baie-comunala-gradinita-depozit-sala-sport-discoteca-1_56250e6cf5eaafab2cd2b861/index.html "Cum și-au bătut joc de conacul familiei Mocioni de la Foeni. A fost pe rând baie comunală, grădiniță, depozit, sală de sport și discotecă"], in ''[[Adevărul]]'' (Timișoara edition), October 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The more senior branch established by them became known as ''Mocioni de Foen'', or ''fényi Mocsonyi'', in reference to its core estate of [[Foeni|Foeni (Fény)]]. This was by contrast with Mihai's descendants, the ''armalist'' Mocionis, who did not hold a titular estate—although they built a manor at [[Birchiș|Birchiș (Marosberkes)]], they were mostly based in Pest, where they founded the Kefala Library.&lt;ref&gt;Colta, pp. 66–70&lt;/ref&gt; Andrei the second was a grandson of the original Andrei, born to lawyer Ioan Mocioni de Foen (1780–1854) and his wife Iuliana Panaiot (1787–1858).&lt;ref&gt;Tiron, pp. 28, 32&lt;/ref&gt; On his mother's side, Andrei had [[Albanians|Albanian]] roots.&lt;ref name="thcapmaced"&gt;[[Theodor Capidan]], "Românii din Macedonia. Rolul Românilor Macedoneni în Ardeal. IV", in ''Cultura Poporului'', Nr. 30/1923, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mm72"&gt;[[Atanasie Marian Marienescu]], "Macedo-Românii din Ungaria", in [[V. A. Urechia]], ''Albumul Macedo-Român'', p. 72. Bucharest: [[Editura Socec|Socecŭ, Sander &amp; Teclu]], 1880.  {{OCLC|45239179}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an elder brother, Petru, born in 1808, and two junior ones: [[Anton Mocioni|Anton]] and [[Gheorghe Mocioni|Gheorghe]] (born 1816 and 1823, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Deheleanu, p. 219; Tiron, pp. 30, 31, 32&lt;/ref&gt; Other siblings included brothers George and Lucian (the latter of whom died young) and sister Ecaterina.&lt;ref name="thcapmaced"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mm72"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deheleanu, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Ioan and Iuliana together had as many as 11 other children.&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, p. 184; Deheleanu, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Andrei was simultaneously the uncle and cousin of writer [[Alexandru Mocioni]], born from a [[consanguine marriage]] between Ecaterina and her uncle Mihai Mocioni.&lt;ref name="mm72"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, p. 137; Colta, pp. 71–74; Deheleanu, p. 218; Tiron, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrei the younger was a native of Pest, but grew up mostly in Foeni where, according to scholar [[Păun Otiman]], he received "a profoundly Christian Orthodox education, inspired by Macedo-Romanian traditions and culture".&lt;ref&gt;Otiman, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the Mocionis only spoke Aromanian and Hungarian.&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the family encouraged intercultural contacts, with Ioan speaking as many as eleven languages.&lt;ref name="mm72"/&gt; According to the [[Serbs in Vojvodina|Banatian Serb]] journalist [[Mihailo Polit-Desančić]], the local Mocionis, including Andrei, also made a point of learning Serbian, and "sort of carried themselves like Serbs".&lt;ref&gt;Milin (2011), p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; Seen by his contemporaries as a man of outstanding culture and upbringing, Andrei had "perfect" command of Aromanian, Romanian, Hungarian, Serbian, as well as Latin, French, and German.&lt;ref&gt;Otiman, pp. 28–29. See also Bugariu, p. 399&lt;/ref&gt; Like his father, he took a law degree in 1828&lt;ref&gt;Tiron, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; or 1832, from the [[Eötvös Loránd University|Royal University of Pest]].&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, p. 87; Bugariu, p. 399; Deheleanu, p. 219; Otiman, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked in the local administration of Banat. In 1836, he was the second-ranked [[notary]] of [[Torontál County]], being appointed first [[pretor]] in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Bugariu, p. 399; Deheleanu, p. 219; Tiron, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnologist Elena Rodica Colta dates the Mocionis' definitive self-identification as Romanians to this period, noting that they believed the entire Aromanian ethnos to be a branch of the Romanian community.&lt;ref&gt;Colta, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in Pest, Andrei began frequenting the literary salon organized by [[Atanasiu Grabovski de Apadia]] in [[Terézváros]], meeting with exponents of Aromanian and Romanian causes.&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, pp. 26–27, 118, 145, 189&lt;/ref&gt;

While participating in Torontál's ''congregatio generalis'', Andrei Mocioni sat with the "conservative-progressive" side of the Romanian caucus, taking his distance from the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Hungary|revolutionary liberals]].&lt;ref&gt;Bugariu, p. 399; Deheleanu, pp. 219–220&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks in part to his contribution, Torontál remained a safe seat for the conservative club of [[István Széchenyi]], committed to "moderate progress" for the country at large, with "national conservation" for the Romanians. In 1847, he managed to obtain a seat in the [[Diet of Hungary]], for his brother Petru, obtaining him votes from conservative Hungarians, Serbs, [[Banat Bulgarians|Bulgarians]], [[Armenians in Hungary|Armenians]] and [[Banat Swabians|Swabians]].&lt;ref name="Bugariu, p. 399"&gt;Bugariu, p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;

===1848 revolution and Banat leadership===
The same period saw him dragged into the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|Austrian]] and [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian Revolutions]]. Like many Romanians, Mocioni supported the former's liberal reforms, and remained loyal to [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]], opposing the rise of [[Hungarian nationalism]]. This pitted him against the pro-Hungarian revolutionary [[Eftimie Murgu]], who enlisted the loyalties of various other Banatians.&lt;ref name="Deheleanu, p. 220"&gt;Deheleanu, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hungarian State (1849)|Hungarian State]] reacted by confiscating Mocioni's property and forcing him into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Bugariu, p. 399; Deheleanu, p. 220; Tiron, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; By September 1849, he was in [[Vienna]], where he acted as a Romanian representative, alongside [[Ioan Dobran]] and [[Vincențiu Babeș]].&lt;ref&gt;Lițiu, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Petru Mocioni was also active there as a "man of trust" of the Banatian Romanians,&lt;ref name="Mureșan &amp; Suciu, p. 107"&gt;Mureșan &amp; Suciu, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; presenting [[Franz Stadion, Count von Warthausen|Franz Stadion]] with a set of political proposals on their behalf.&lt;ref name="Ciorănescu, p. 218"&gt;Ciorănescu, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[surrender at Világos]] and the resumption of Austrian control, Mocioni's loyalty was rewarded, and he was appointed supreme commissioner for the Banat, within the new [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]].&lt;ref name="mm72"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bugariu, p. 399; Ciorănescu, p. 218; Deheleanu, p. 220; Mureșan &amp; Suciu, p. 107; Tiron, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; As such, he governed directly over some 600,000 people.&lt;ref name="Ciorănescu, p. 218"/&gt; However, he disliked this arrangement, and, in December 1849, petitioned [[Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg]] to obtain the secession of Banat as an autonomous, Romanian, province.&lt;ref name="Tiron, p. 30"&gt;Tiron, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; During his mandate, the administration was staffed with a growing number of Romanians.&lt;ref name="Deheleanu, p. 220"/&gt; In tandem, his Mocioni relatives approached the Romanians of [[Principality of Transylvania (1711–1867)|Transylvania]], also loyalists, and together with them began pressing for a Romanian dukedom to be created out of Romanian territories in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Ciorănescu, p. 44; Milin (2011), p. 398. See also Berényi, pp. 200–201; Mureșan &amp; Suciu, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; The commissioner was also involved in such projects, proposing that a Romanian press be set up in [[Arad, Romania|Arad]], located on the Banat's traditional border with Transylvania and [[Partium]].&lt;ref&gt;Lițiu, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; By 1850, Mocioni was also campaigning to reestablish a [[Metropolis of Transylvania|Transylvanian (Romanian) Orthodox Metropolis]], fully separated from the [[Patriarchate of Karlovci]].&lt;ref name="thcapmaced"/&gt; The cause had first been embraced by Petru in the 1840s.&lt;ref name="Mureșan &amp; Suciu, p. 107"/&gt;

In 1852, he ultimately resigned as commissioner, expressing his protest toward the treatment of Romanians by the Austrian government.&lt;ref&gt;Deheleanu, p. 220; Tiron, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was asked to reconsider by the authorities, who feared that they were becoming unpopular with the majority population.&lt;ref name="Deheleanu, p. 220"/&gt; Although he did not resume his earlier posting, he went on to serve as president of the Central Commission in [[Timișoara|Temeschwar (Timișoara)]]; he was also a counsel for the [[Supreme Court (Austria)|Austrian Court of Cassation]].&lt;ref&gt;Tiron, p. 30. See also Deheleanu, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned all positions in the state apparatus in 1856, and withdrew to Foeni. This decision was cemented in 1858 by the death of brother Petru, killed by his own landlord or doorman in Pest.&lt;ref&gt;Bugariu, p. 399; Deheleanu, pp. 219, 220, 221; Tiron, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The killing, which some authors see as a political assassination,&lt;ref name="Bugariu, p. 399"/&gt; ended with a celebrity trial in which [[Emanoil Gojdu]] represented the Mocionis as plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;Neș, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, at Foeni, Mocioni married a Serb coreligionist, Laura, the Countess Csernovich (Čarnojević).&lt;ref name="ceenou211"&gt;"Ce e nou?", in ''[[Familia (magazine)|Familia]]'', Nr. 33/1880, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deheleanu, pp. 219, 220; Tiron, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; A woman of "outstanding beauty",&lt;ref&gt;Milin (2011), p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; she was also noted for collecting Ancient Roman coins&lt;ref&gt;Babeșiu, pp. 179–180&lt;/ref&gt; and paintings with Roman subjects by Nicola Popescu.&lt;ref&gt;"Pesta in 12 Noemvre n.", in ''Albina'', Nr. 87/1866, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, ''[[Graf]]'' [[Petar Čarnojević]], had been an ally of the Hungarian revolutionaries; dispossessed and bankrupt, he moved to Foeni to live with the couple.&lt;ref&gt;Milin (2011), pp. 382–383&lt;/ref&gt; They also shared the manor with Alexandru and the other ''armalist'' Mocionis, who were similarly disappointed with Hungarian politics, and who progressively withdrew from Pest.&lt;ref&gt;Colta, pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Atanasie Marian Marienescu]] notes that Mocioni, "everywhere encouraged and supported by the Romanian [[intelligentsia]], became in all places a leader of the Romanians in national and church causes, and this leadership was recognized by his brothers as well."&lt;ref name="mm72"/&gt; From about 1860, he dedicated himself to the [[national awakening of Romania]]ns, networking between the Austrian subjects in the Banat, Transylvania, and the [[Duchy of Bukovina]], and those residing in the newly formed [[United Principalities]]. In November 1860, as [[Alexander von Mensdorff-Pouilly, Prince Dietrichstein von Nicolsburg|Count Mensdorff-Pouilly]] was sent over to report to Franz Joseph on the demands of Banat Romanians, Mocioni called in and organized a National Assembly. This demanded the creation of a Banat Captaincy, and, when the request was denied, an administrative incorporation with Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Bugariu, pp. 399–400; Tiron, p. 30. See also Ciorănescu, pp. 89–90; Milin (2010), p. 21; Mureșan &amp; Suciu, p. 107; Otiman, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that Romanians needed to form a singular "moral body", "called upon as a nation to partake in Austria's constitutional life."&lt;ref&gt;Ciorănescu, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Memorandum to the Throne'', Mocioni also theorized that the Banat was an "individuality" distinct from the Serbian and Hungarian regions, and suggested that "never-ending problems" would result from its continued amalgamation.&lt;ref&gt;Milin (2010), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial Diet and church separation===

On May 31, 1860,&lt;ref&gt;Păcățian, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; Mocioni was co-opted by the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Diet]], which contemplated administrative reforms based on new ethnic arrangements. He was an "extraordinary counsel", alongside [[Andrei Șaguna]] of Transylvania and [[Nicolae de Petrino]] of Bukovina, supporting regional autonomy and the reestablishment and a Romanian Metropolis.&lt;ref&gt;''Mitropolitul...'', pp. 222, 327; Bugariu, p. 399; Deheleanu, pp. 220–221; Lupaș, pp. 187–189; Otiman, p. 28; Păcățian, ''passim''; Tiron, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; By origin, all three were in fact Aromanians.&lt;ref&gt;Deheleanu, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, both Șaguna and Mocioni objected to Diet being non-democratic, and, on this point, agreed with [[György Apponyi]] that the delegates only represented themselves. Their objection was registered, but they were asked by [[Archduke Rainer Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Rainer]] not to insist on this point.&lt;ref&gt;Păcățian, pp. 269–270&lt;/ref&gt; Seen from his regional constituency, Mocioni was also one of two representatives of the Voivodeship, including the Banat. The other was a Serb prelate, [[Samuilo Maširević]].&lt;ref&gt;Păcățian, pp. 268–269, 270&lt;/ref&gt; By September 1860, Mocioni clarified that he considered himself a legitimate Banat and "people's" representative.&lt;ref&gt;Păcățian, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 6, Mocioni was elected to the Budget Committee, and from this position campaigned to have Romanian Orthodox churches subsidized on par with other state-recognized religions.&lt;ref&gt;Păcățian, pp. 270, 274, 278–279&lt;/ref&gt; Proclaiming the equality of nations against demands for Hungarian hegemony, he found himself debating the issue with [[György Majláth (1786–1861)|György Majláth]], who accused him of fostering the rebellious doctrines of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]. Mocioni defended his ideas as mainstream, arguing that equality had been promised by Franz Joseph himself.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Malfèr, "Les représentations de Garibaldi en Autriche", in Jean-Yves Frétigné, Paul Pasteur (eds.), ''Changer d'époque, n° 23. Garibaldi: modèle, contre-modèle'', p. 114. Rouen: Publications des universités de Rouen et du Havre, 2011.  {{ISBN|978-2-87775-508-5}}. See also Ciorănescu, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Mocioni sided with the "centralists", who supported [[proportional representation]] within a centralized Austria; Petrino, a "federalist", wanted regional decentralization on the basis of old laws, which, while favoring Bukovinans, would have left Romanians in Hungary underrepresented as a group.&lt;ref&gt;Lupaș, p. 189; Păcățian, pp. 277–279&lt;/ref&gt; The two made common cause in their opposition to a projected union between Bukovina and [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Austrian Galicia]].&lt;ref name="Păcățian, p. 275"&gt;Păcățian, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

Mocioni's mandate ended with the Diet recall on September 29, 1860.&lt;ref name="Păcățian, p. 275"/&gt; He had failed in his bid to secure Banat autonomy: the region, alongside all of the Voivodeship, was re-annexed to the Hungarian crown in December 1860. In April 1861, Mocioni persuaded the Banat Romanians to boycott future elections for the reestablished Hungarian Diet. This decision was overturned later that year, when a new ethnic assembly passed a resolution calling for single Romanian candidatures, supported by all voters.&lt;ref name="Bugariu, p. 400"&gt;Bugariu, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; Mocioni himself was elected for [[Krassó County|Krassó (Caraș) County]], at [[Lugoj|Lugoj (Lugos)]]. His rival was Murgu, who sided with the [[Address Party]] and supported incorporation with Hungary. Mocioni, perceived as the Romanian nationalist candidate, won 621 votes to 94.&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, pp. 102–103. See also Wlad, pp. 39–42&lt;/ref&gt; However, he had not agreed to be listed as a candidate,&lt;ref&gt;Wlad, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; and immediately renounced his seat.&lt;ref&gt;Ovidiu Emil Iudean, Alexandru Onojescu, "Politics, Nationalism, and Parliamentarianism: Romanian Representatives in the Budapest Parliament (1861–1918)", in ''Transylvanian Review'', Vol. XXII, Issue 4, Winter 2013, p. 6; Papio Ilariano, pp. 4–5, 68&lt;/ref&gt; In his address, Mocioni explained that "he had nothing in common with the Hungarian diet of Pest, since he had never intended to become a Hungarian."&lt;ref&gt;Papio Ilariano, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a publicized row with the Temeschwar [[Burgrave]], the pro-Hungarian [[Petru Cermena]], but their dispute was ultimately patched up by Babeș.&lt;ref&gt;Babeșiu, pp. 173–174&lt;/ref&gt; The Diet itself was dissolved later that year.&lt;ref name="Bugariu, p. 400"/&gt;

Mocioni's solution to these setbacks was the attempted creation of a de facto "political body" and "[[crown land]]" for all Romanians of the Empire.&lt;ref name="Bugariu, p. 400"/&gt; In the parallel debate over church affairs, Șaguna, the designated Metropolitan, had Mocioni as one of his "most ardent supporters",&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; one "fighting like a virile lion for the hierarchic separation".&lt;ref name="paroh"&gt;"Epistolele parochului betranu, XIV", in ''Biseric'a si Scóla'', Nr. 51/1887, pp. 412–413&lt;/ref&gt; Mediating between the Karlovci Patriarch [[Josif Rajačić]] and his Romanian clergy, he proposed to convene a representative [[synod]] on the issue of separation, knowing that it would favor the Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;''Mitropolitul...'', p. 229; Hitchins, p. 13; Lupaș, pp. 193, 258&lt;/ref&gt; The Patriarch resisted this move and suspended the negotiations, arguing that "the [Serb] nation would have me stoned to death".&lt;ref&gt;''Mitropolitul...'', p. 229; Lupaș, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Rajačić's death in late 1861 created confusion among the Serb bishops, empowering Mocioni to network and campaign for the national schism.&lt;ref&gt;Bocșan (2011), pp. 366–367; Hitchins, pp. 14–16; Mureșan &amp; Suciu, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; He outlined his political manifesto for autonomy in articles for ''[[Gazeta Transilvaniei]]'' of [[Brașov|Corona]], as well as in reports addressed to Franz Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;Otiman, p. 28; Mureșan &amp; Suciu, pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; That year, with Șaguna and [[Alexandru Sterca-Șuluțiu]], Mocioni established [[Asociația Transilvană pentru Literatura Română și Cultura Poporului Român|ASTRA Society]], which promoted Romanian identity and culture, created despite continued chicanery from Hungarian officials.&lt;ref&gt;"Buletinul ''Astrei'' Satu-Mare. ''Astra'' la Abrud", in ''Afirmarea'', Nr. 9/1938, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; He also placed a bid for ASTRA's presidency, but lost to Șaguna.&lt;ref&gt;Lupaș, p. 748&lt;/ref&gt;

He was more successful in his campaigning for an Orthodox metropolis, set up in December 1864; from 1865, it incorporated Banatian Romanian churches as the [[Diocese of Caransebeș]].&lt;ref&gt;Bocșan (2011), pp. 366–367; Tiron, pp. 30–31. See also Bugariu, p. 400; Hitchins, pp. 17–20&lt;/ref&gt; Already in 1862, Mocioni, Șaguna, and [[Eudoxiu Hurmuzachi]] had managed to obtain Franz Joseph's sympathy on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;''Mitropolitul...'', pp. 327–328; Hitchins, pp. 16–17; Lupaș, pp. 271–272, 278; Mureșan &amp; Suciu, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote about this victory in ''[[Telegraful Român]]'' of Transylvania and ''Concordia'' of Bukovina, persuading "right-believing Romanians" not to participate in the election of a Rajačić replacement.&lt;ref&gt;''Mitropolitul...'', p. 328; Bocșan (2011), p. 366; Lupaș, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Mocioni was disappointed with Șaguna, who did not back his plan for creating a new [[Archdiocese of Timișoara|bishopric at Temeschwar]].&lt;ref&gt;Bocșan (2011), pp. 366–368; P. Ionescu, "Observări la rĕspunsul Prea Cuv. Sale Dlui arhimandrit Dr. Ilarion Pușcariu", in ''Foaia Diecesană'', Nr. 28/1901, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; During this clash, he withdrew his financial support for the church historian [[Nicolae Tincu-Velea]], who had to print his works with ASTRA.&lt;ref&gt;Bocșan (2011), pp. 367–368&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungarian Diet===
Returning to Arad, Mocioni helped establish there a National Culture and Enlightenment Association, presided upon by [[Prokopije Ivačković]] and Anton Mocioni. It received his collection of historical documents, and appointed him a delegate to Vienna, to thank the emperor for supporting Romanian culture.&lt;ref&gt;"Ungari'a. Prim'a adunare generala a Associatiunei natiunale in Aradu, pentru cultur'a si conversarea poporului romanu (Continuare lá Nr. 39)", in ''[[Telegraful Român]]'', Nr. 40/1863, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, his philanthropy expanded. He donated his only source of income, the revenue of Foeni, to the famine-stricken population of that village, and even ran into debt in his effort to provide for them.&lt;ref&gt;Bugariu, p. 400; Deheleanu, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; He was also interested in [[horse breeding]], and one of his steeds became the ancestor of an equine string that populated much of Foeni.&lt;ref name="wrangel"&gt;C. G. Wrangel, ''Ungarns Pferdezucht in Wort und Bild. Vierter Band: Die ungarische Landespferdezucht; Die Privatgestüte. Zweiter Teil'', pp. 22–23. Stuttgart: Verlag von Schickhardt &amp; Ebner, 1895.  {{OCLC|312705921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a while, the Romanians of Banat continued to plead with the emperor for Romanian self-rule in the Banat. One such petition, circulated in December 1863, also asked Franz Joseph to surround himself with Romanian advisers, including "Andrea de Mocioni, lord of Foeni", a man distinguished by "political, patriotic, and national virtues".&lt;ref&gt;"Plansórea Romaniloru Banatiani (incheiere din Nrulu trecutu)", in ''[[Foaia pentru Minte, Inimă și Literatură|Foaia pentru Minte, Anima si Literatura]]'', Nr. 29/1863, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by historian Tudor-Radu Tiron, the restoration of Hungarian rule ultimately pushed the Mocionis back into Hungarian politics, which explains why Andrei, Anton and Gheorghe all took seats in the last Diet of Hungary (1865).&lt;ref name="Tiron, p. 31"&gt;Tiron, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandru also won a [[Tormac|Rittberg]] seat in that legislature, becoming known as the theoretician of [[national liberalism]], and main proponent of a Nationalities Bill, which aimed at validating autonomous units for the Romanians in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, pp. 215–220; Nicolae Bocșan, "Liberalism and Nationalism in Alexandru Mocsonyi's Parliamentary Activity (1865–1871)", in ''Transylvanian Review'', Vol. XXII, Issue 4, Winter 2013, pp. 17–24; Ciorănescu, p. 92; Deheleanu, pp. 222–223; Milin (2010), pp. 21–28&lt;/ref&gt;

By then, the Mocionis' contribution to the national cause was being recognized in the United Principalities, customarily known as the "[[Principality of Romania]]". From January 1865, he was an honorary member of the nationalist ''Bucovina'' Society.&lt;ref&gt;D. Murărașu, "Comentarii eminesciene 1866–1874. ''La mormântul lui Aron Pumnul''", in [[Mihai Eminescu]], ''Opere I. Poezii (I)'', p. 269. Bucharest: Grai și Suflet – Cultura Națională, 1995.  {{ISBN|973-9232-07-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 22, 1866, the Romanian Regency appointed Andrei Mocioni a founding member of the [[Romanian Academy]] (or "Romanian Literary Society", as it was known at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Bugariu, p. 400; Otiman, ''passim''; Tiron, pp. 28, 31&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted as a Banat representative, alongside Babeș—who, in 1883, wrote Mocioni's biography.&lt;ref&gt;Otiman, ''passim''; Tiron, p. 31. See also Bugariu, p. 400; Lupaș, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; From 1861, the Mocionis and Babeș had cooperated in countering Hungarian nationalist propaganda abroad, publicizing the Romanian point of view. According to Babeș, their effort was sabotaged by [[Abdolonyme Ubicini]], [[István Türr]], and [[Giovenale Vegezzi Ruscalla]], who wanted a Hungarian–Romanian alliance against Austria; but also found backing from [[László Teleki]] of the [[Resolution Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Babeșiu, pp. 174–176&lt;/ref&gt; With his parallel career as a lawyer, Babeș also helped the Mocionis win back 5 million [[Hungarian forint|forint]] from their Hungarian debtors, and was thereafter their trusted adviser.&lt;ref&gt;Cosma, pp. 267–268&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1866, echoes of Mocioni's "Captaincy" project were discernible in the radical proposal advanced in the Diet by Babeș, [[Sigismund Popoviciu]], and [[Iosif Hodoșiu]]: it recognized subjection to the Hungarian crown and government, but sought to redefine Hungary on the basis of [[ethnic federalism]] and [[corporatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Milin (2010), p. 23. See also Neș, pp. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts also failed. By September 1866, Mocioni and Babeș began speaking out in the Diet about the wish of Austrian Romanians to be united with the Principality of Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Sorin Liviu Damean, "Români și maghiari în contextul războiului austro–prusian (1866)", in ''Analele Universității din Craiova, Seria Istorie'', Vol. XVI, Issue 1, 2011, pp. 280–281&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1866–1867 interval was a great disappointment for the various schools of Romanian nationalism: the return of Hungarian nationalism was unopposed following the [[Austro-Prussian War]], and the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|''Ausgleich'' of 1867]] created [[Austria-Hungary]], including most Romanian-inhabited areas into the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen]]. Mocioni was especially affected by the outcome.&lt;ref name="Bugariu, p. 400; Tiron, p. 31"&gt;Bugariu, p. 400; Tiron, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In the months following the new arrangement, Mocioni and Babeș participated in the drafting of another protest, also signed by the Diet's Serb, Slovak and "[[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]]" deputies. The resolution, which demanded guarantees for the minorities, was supposed to be read by Mocioni. He stepped down to make way for a more popular deputy, the Serb [[Milán Manojlovics]].&lt;ref&gt;"Manifestatiune colective in cestiunea de nationalitate", in ''[[Românul|Romanulu]]'', December 22, 1867, p. 1096&lt;/ref&gt; Brother Anton Mocioni, alongside Serbs [[Stevan Branovački]] and [[Svetozar Miletić]], continued to back the campaign, proposing to divide Hungary into six ethnic-based provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Neș, pp. 15, 114–116, 132–133&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final withdrawal===
In 1869, Andrei Mocioni withdrew from all activism and returned to Foeni.&lt;ref name="stbconac"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bugariu, p. 400; Tiron, p. 31"/&gt; That year, an analysis in ''Der Wanderer'' newspaper noted that "although Andrea Mocioni will forever remain the true leader" of the Romanian caucus, Alexandru was emerging as the tactician, and moderating the Romanians' resistance to Hungarian nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;"Varietati. Indreptare", in ''Albina'', Nr. 10/1869, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; By then, the various factions seeking to form a [[Romanian National Party]] had only managed to establish a Transylvanian caucus and a Banatian one. The latter, presided upon by Anton Mocioni, recognized Hungarian rule and sought to obtain Romanian rights within its jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Neș, pp. 132–133&lt;/ref&gt; An 1872 report to his partisans also claimed that Andrei and the other Mocionis were "disgusted" and "demoralized" by the behavior of Romanian electors in Lugoj and Krassó, who acted as "proselytes of the [Hungarian] government".&lt;ref&gt;"Lugosiu, 4 fauru 1872", in ''Albina'', Nr. 9/1872, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Mocioni also continued to be active as a sponsor and philanthropist, providing funds for Babeș's ethnological work, and for the Viennese Romanian newspaper, ''Albina''.&lt;ref&gt;Cosma, pp. 263–268; Deheleanu, pp. 221–222; Munteanu, p. 64; Neș, p. 298; Otiman, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He and his brothers published and wrote for the latter sheet, alongside Babeș,&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, pp. 202–204; Cosma, pp. 264–266&lt;/ref&gt; while also financing pro-Romanian campaigns in the German-language journal ''Ost und West''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mitropolitul...'', pp. 331–332&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[Visarion Roman]] and [[Partenie Cosma]], they established in 1871 the Albina Bank of [[Sibiu]], providing credit for Romanian businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Neș, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Mocioni also provided funds in hopes of creating a Romanian regional theater, and became [[Godparent|godfather]] of Andrei, the child of actors [[Mihail Pascaly|Mihail]] and [[Matilda Pascaly]].&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, pp. 56, 162. See also Neș, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; The family as a whole provided a scholarship fund for disadvantaged children, managed by Babeș.&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, pp. 210, 220–221, 237; Bugariu, p. 400; Deheleanu, p. 221; Neș, pp. 301–302&lt;/ref&gt; Noted recipients include writer [[Gruia Liuba Murgu]],&lt;ref&gt;Cosma, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; biologist [[Victor Babeș]], and lawyer [[Coriolan Brediceanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Berényi, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; The former deputy and the [[Magyar Posta|Hungarian post]] had an unsolved dispute about the creation of a Foeni post office, which the officials viewed as too costly. Mocioni took the [[postmaster]] examination and, at his own expense, erected a building which, with its [[mahogany]] furniture and silver [[inkwell]]s, was recognized as "the most elegant post office".&lt;ref name="biroulu"&gt;"Diverse. Biroulu postalu celu mai elegantu", in ''[[Gazeta de Transilvania|Gazet'a Transilvaniei]]'', Nr. 54/1880, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Mocioni was still pressed by his friends to make a return to politics. He refused on principle, but allowed for a theoretical possibility: "I shall no longer fight and sacrifice myself to the four winds, but will patiently wait for a national regeneration to begin, if ever."&lt;ref name="Bugariu, p. 400"/&gt; A local tradition, recorded in 1905 by the newspaper ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', noted that, by then, he and his Serb wife were detested by the local Romanians, who once attacked the manor and shattered its windows.&lt;ref name="concert"&gt;"Concertul de la Foenĭ", in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 37/1905, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; According to a notice in the Arad Orthodox paper ''Biseric'a si Scóla'', Mocioni was also driven away from religious affairs after "a mean gossiper libeled him, out of the blue and without a shred of truthfulness".&lt;ref name="paroh"/&gt;

Mocioni's health was failing, and for this reason he never attended any session of the Romanian Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Otiman, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; From 1879, Mocioni's disease worsened, and, once bedridden, he was taken to Temeschwar to be under specialist care.&lt;ref name="ceenou211"/&gt; Mocioni died on May 5 (April 23), 1880. Although some sources give his death place as Foeni,&lt;ref name="Tiron, p. 31"/&gt; contemporary reports have it that he died in Temeschwar, after having lapsed into a brief coma, and while looked after by his wife Laura.&lt;ref name="ceenou211"/&gt; Their marriage had produced no heirs.&lt;ref name="mm72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tiron, p. 30"/&gt;

[[File:Cripta familiei Mocioni din Foeni.jpg|thumb|380px|Mocioni crypt in Foeni, 2015 photograph]]
Mocioni's body was taken to Foeni for an Orthodox burial at the common Serb–Romanian church, which he and his wife had furnished.&lt;ref name="intoler"&gt;"Noutăți. Intoleranță", in ''Tribuna Poporului'', Nr. 110/1900, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Laura inherited all his wealth, which sparked a Mocioni family feud.&lt;ref name="stbconac"/&gt; Already a licensed postal worker, she continued Mocioni's work as a postmaster.&lt;ref name="biroulu"/&gt; She died on the estate in August 1892, aged 53,&lt;ref&gt;"Ce e nou? Necrolog", in ''[[Familia (magazine)|Familia]]'', Nr. 32/1892, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried at his side.&lt;ref name="intoler"/&gt; In her late years, she had carried on with Mocioni philanthropy work, but only servicing the local Serb community and punishing Romanian ingratitude. According to ''Tribuna'', the "new generation" of Romanians, "more enlightened than the earlier one", was expressing shame and regret for having alienated her.&lt;ref name="concert"/&gt; By then, a scandal had erupted over Mocioni's remains. The church remained a property of the Karlovci Patriarchy, which in 1900 refused to hand over the body for reburial in the Mocioni mausoleum. It cited texts which condemned the separation in death of husband and wife, but the Romanian press suspected that such resistance was proof of "intolerant" [[Serb nationalism]].&lt;ref name="intoler"/&gt; A separation was eventually made, and Andrei was reburied in the new location.&lt;ref name="stbconac"/&gt;

The various Mocioni estates went to brothers Alexandru and Eugen. Some were inherited by Eugen's sons, before passing to Ecaterina Mocioni and her husband, Jenő, [[Teleki family|Count Teleki]]; others went to the Bukovinan baron [[Ioan Mocsony-Stârcea]], who was Alexandru's adoptive son.&lt;ref&gt;Colta, pp. 77–83&lt;/ref&gt; The core manor at Foeni was nevertheless inherited by the [[Csávossy]] counts,&lt;ref name="stbconac"/&gt;&lt;ref name="concert"/&gt; while his horses continued to be bred by the Austrians Jakob Haas and Ludwig Deutsch.&lt;ref name="wrangel"/&gt; The property was pillaged by peasants during the [[Aster Revolution|revolutionary events]] which marked the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918. According to one Romanian account, this incident provided the [[Hungarian Royal Gendarmerie]] with an excuse to murder Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolae Bocșan, "The Banatian Revolution from the Autumn of 1918 in the Collective Memory {{sic}}", in ''Transylvanian Review'', Vol. XXIV, Issue 4, Winter 2015, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Most other assets were kept by the surviving family following the establishment of [[Greater Romania]], when Anton Jr bought back the Foeni mansion, hoping to turn it into a cultural club.&lt;ref name="stbconac"/&gt; According to historian Vicențiu Bugariu, by 1930 Andrei Mocioni was already forgotten, a victim of "ignorance and indifference".&lt;ref name="Bugariu, p. 399"/&gt; This trend was censured by the Banat politician [[Sever Bocu]]. Although a critic of "Mocionist" conservatism in Austria-Hungary, during the interwar he became noted for his work to preserve and shed light on the family's contribution as a "moral dynasty".&lt;ref&gt;Munteanu, pp. 8, 20, 47, 51–52, 58, 64–65, 91&lt;/ref&gt; Bocu wrote Andrei Mocioni's profile as a study in national pedagogy,&lt;ref&gt;Mureșan &amp; Suciu, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; declaring that any Banatian unaware of the Mocionis' role "is a Banatian in name only".&lt;ref&gt;Munteanu, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Mocioni, or any other of his relatives, is also mentioned in the [[Banat Romanian dialect|dialectical Banatian]] poetry of the interwar. Samples include [[Gheorghe Gârda]]'s ''Că tăt Bănatu-i fruncea!'' ("And Yet the Banat Is Tops") and [[Cassian R. Munteanu]]'s ''Vicejî noștri'' ("Our Braves").&lt;ref&gt;Ioan Viorel Boldureanu, Simion Dănilă, [[Cornel Ungureanu]], ''Antologia literaturii dialectale bănățene (poezie, proză, teatru); 1891–2011'', pp. 61, 71. Timișoara: [[West University of Timișoara|Editura Universității de Vest]], 2011.  {{ISBN|978-973-125-339-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the death of Anton Jr in 1943, the direct Mocioni lineage was extinguished; however, interest in the family was still kept alive by Bocu's nephew, the scholar Ion D. Suciu.&lt;ref&gt;Mureșan &amp; Suciu, pp. 89–90, 92–94, 106&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, the estates were subject to [[Nationalization in Romania|nationalization]] under the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], which turned the Foeni complex into a public bathhouse, and then into a storage room for chemicals. Following the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], the mansion was re-purposed as a cultural club and mainly functioned as a disco, before being taken over by the local town hall.&lt;ref name="stbconac"/&gt; The communist and post-communist periods saw the Mocioni inheritance falling into disrepair, and the deposited collections were still being looted in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Colta, pp. 66–67, 78&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter period, busts of Andrei and Alexandru Mocioni were installed in Timișoara's Scudier Park.&lt;ref&gt;Lajos Kakucs, "De la Fântâna Pașei de pe lângă Mănăstirea Dervișilor până la Parcul Rozelor.

'''Arthur Rylands Lowe''' (22 June 1873 – 31 May 1924) was a British accountant and the first full-time professional accountant in Hong Kong.

==Biography==
Lowe was born on 22 June 1873 in [[Manchester]]. He was educated at the [[Hulme Grammar School]] and later joined Parkinson, Mather &amp; Co., chartered accountants of Manchester and London.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite news|title=DEATH OF HON. MR. A. R. LOWE.|newspaper=The Hong Kong Telegraph|date=31 May 1924|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to Hong Kong to join [[Butterfield &amp; Swire]] in 1898. He resigned in 1902 to start up his own business.&lt;ref name="pwc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chamber.org.hk/en/membership/profile_detail.aspx?profile_id=68|title=PricewaterhouseCoopers|work=The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June 1902, he became Hong Kong's first full-time professional accountant, and started the accountant firm that is today the Hong Kong office of [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]. In 1903 he took fellow accountant J. E. Bingham as a partner. They established an office in Shanghai in 1906. When F. N. Matthews in Shanghai joined the partnership in 1908, the firm became known as Lowe, Bingham &amp; Matthews.&lt;ref name="pwc"/&gt; Under his leadership, its clients included the [[China Light and Power Co.]], [[Hongkong and Shanghai Bank]], [[Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock]], [[Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.]] and the [[Hong Kong and China Gas Co.]].&lt;ref name="pwc"/&gt; Lowe was also a director of [[Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels|Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, Ltc.]] and secretary of the [[Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce]] for many years.&lt;ref name="pwc"/&gt; 

Lowe contested the [[Justice of the Peace]] election in 1920 for a seat in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] against T. F. Hough during the absence of [[Henry Edward Pollock|H. E. Pollock]]. He was again appointed to the Legislative Council in July 1922 while [[Herbert William Bird|H. W. Bird]] was on leave. Lowe was especially acquainted with financial matters in the Legislative Council and was involved in the discussions between the government and the [[Hong Kong Telephone Company]] over the renewal of the company's licence. He was also member of the Licensing Board and was made Justice of the Peace in March 1906.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt;

Lowe was one of the leading members of the [[Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club]] and was the president of the Lawn Bowls Association of Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt; He was also interested in pony racing. Lowe died from [[typhoid]] at 4:00 a.m. on 31 May 1924 at the Peak Hospital, aged 50.&lt;ref name="pwc"/&gt;

'''As is''' is a [[legal]] term used to disclaim some [[implied warranty|implied warranties]] for an item being sold. Certain types of implied warranties must be specifically disclaimed, such as the implied warranty of title.  "As is" denotes that the seller is selling, and the buyer is buying an item in whatever condition it presently exists, and that the buyer is accepting the item "with all faults", whether or not immediately apparent. This is the classic "[[caveat emptor|buyer beware]]" situation, where the careful buyer should take the time to examine the item before accepting it, or obtain expert advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url        = http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/as+is
 |title      = As Is
 |work    = TheFreeDictionary.com
 |accessdate = 2013-05-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the phrase "as is" does not disclaim express warranties, such as those created by the seller's description of an item. In other words, the item may be sold "as is," but if the item does not conform to the seller's description, the buyer has a right to reject it.

For example, a seller of a used [[automobile]] sells his car to a buyer, and puts into the [[contract of sale]] the statement: "The buyer accepts the automobile AS IS, WITH ALL FAULTS." Two minutes after the buyer drives off with it, the [[engine]] seizes, and the car stalls. Unless the buyer can show that there was some [[fraud]] involved, or the seller breached an express warranty, the buyer is not entitled to a refund. This would be a specific example where [[fraud in the inducement]] could outweigh anything in the contract, express or implied: it simply doesn't matter what disclaimer or limitations may be found in the contract, if the contract is void (or voidable) for any reason.

Disgruntled buyers of [[real estate]], and their respective improvements, may be faced with other complicated [[property law]] issues if a [[deed]] is conveyed as a result of a contract with an "as is" clause. In real estate, these are the larger potential problems than issues with the structure itself, which can be drawn out with an inspector.  Searching public records is often difficult, and often done lazily by the seller; this means that the buyer may be burdened with [[liens]] on the home, and face various fees related to things such as public utilities.

In many jurisdictions disclaimer of various implied warranties is void. For instance, laws on [[consumer protection]], and [[unfair contract terms]] may limit the ability of a manufacturer or seller to limit or exclude liability for various types of damage. See, for instance, the [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]] and [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]].

In 2016, Asana added administrator features including member management,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.asana.com/2016/03/new-admin-functionality/|title=New member management features for admins - The Asana Blog|date=2016-03-11|work=The Asana Blog|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; team management,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.asana.com/2016/06/new-admins-team-management/|title=Introducing team management - The Asana Blog|date=2016-06-16|work=The Asana Blog|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and password and security controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.asana.com/2016/08/admins-stronger-password-controls/|title=New for Admins: Stronger password and security controls - The Asana Blog|date=2016-08-08|work=The Asana Blog|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, status updates were added so teams could communicate the state of a project to stakeholders,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.asana.com/2016/06/status-updates-have-comments/|title=Project status updates now have comments - The Asana Blog|date=2016-06-01|work=The Asana Blog|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and task dependencies followed in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.asana.com/2016/07/dependencies/|title=Dependencies: A simple way to manage complex workflows|date=2016-07-28|work=The Asana Blog|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, the company launched custom fields, “an interface and architecture that will let you tailor Asana’s information management to cover a variety of structured data points”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/15/task-management-app-asana-takes-on-the-spreadsheet-with-custom-fields/|title=Task management app Asana takes on the spreadsheet with ‘custom fields’ – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, Asana launched Boards so teams could organize and visualize their projects in columns. The Verge reported that, “By integrating lists and boards into a single product, Asana may have just vaulted ahead of its rivals.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/15/13631254/asana-boards-trello-software|title=Asana introduces boards as part of an all-out assault on Trello|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also released pre-made project templates.

In March 2017, Asana announced its integration with Microsoft Teams,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.asana.com/2017/03/asana-microsoft-teams-integration/|title=Learn More About the New Asana Microsoft Teams Integration|date=2017-03-13|work=The Asana Blog|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the launch of custom project templates in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.asana.com/2017/06/create-custom-project-plan-templates-asana/|title=Your recipe for success: Introducing custom templates|date=2017-06-14|work=The Asana Blog|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 2017, start dates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.asana.com/2017/10/add-start-dates-tasks-projects/|title=Avoid the scramble, and add a start date|date=2017-10-16|work=The Asana Blog|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new integration with Gmail,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.google/products/g-suite/track-projects-g-suite-and-asana/|title=Track projects with G Suite and Asana|date=2017-06-19|work=Google|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comment-only projects were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.asana.com/2017/11/comment-view-only-permissions-asana/|title=Lock it down: Introducing comment-only projects in Asana|date=2017-11-06|work=The Asana Blog|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in November, Asana launched its app in French and German.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/11/01/asana-seeks-growth-in-europe-by-expanding-task-management-app-beyond-english/|title=Asana seeks growth in Europe by expanding task-management app beyond English|date=November 1, 2017|work=VentureBeat|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 2018, Asana launched a new CSV importer&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.asana.com/2018/01/import-csv-asana-projects/|title=Move projects from spreadsheets to Asana: introducing the CSV importer|date=2018-01-08|work=The Asana Blog|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; so teams could upload their data into the app. In February 2018, the app was released in Spanish and Portuguese. In March 2018, Asana announced a new interactive feature called Timeline, which business can use to visualize and map out their projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/28/asana-launches-timeline-tool-for-companies-to-visualize-project-tasks/|title=Asana launches timeline tool for companies to visualize project tasks|date=March 28, 2018|work=VentureBeat|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== API &amp; Integrations ==
In April 2012, Asana released its [[API]] to third-party developers. Asana’s open API provides a means to programmatically read information in Asana, input information into Asana, and create automations within Asana. This allows customers or third-party developers to build on the Asana platform and customize Asana to the unique way their teams work. Common use cases include automating repetitive tasks, chaining processes, automating reporting on tasks and projects, and syncing with databases or other tools.

The Asana API is a RESTful interface, allowing you to update and access much of your data on the platform. It provides predictable URLs for accessing resources, and uses built-in HTTP features to receive commands and return responses. This makes it easy to communicate with a wide variety of environments, from command-line utilities to browser plugins to native applications.

Asana has integrations with other SaaS tools, including Gmail, Slack, Microsoft Outlook, Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, Zapier, IFTTT, Wufoo, JotForm, Okta, OneLogin, Harvest, Instagantt, and Zendesk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://asana.com/apps|title=Asana Apps and Integrations · Asana|work=Asana|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Asana received a 4.5 / 5 from ''PC Magazine'' (October 13, 2017), which named it an Editors' Choice and called it "one of the best collaboration and productivity apps for teams."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2408011,00.asp|title=Asana|website=PCMAG|access-date=February 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article remarked on Asana's "thoughtful design, fluid interactive elements, and generous member allotment."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Bidzina Ivanishvili''' ({{lang-ka|ბიძინა ივანიშვილი}}, also known as '''Boris Ivanishvili'''; born 18 February 1956) is a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] businessman and politician who was [[Prime Minister of Georgia]] from 25 October 2012 to 20 November 2013. He founded and led the [[Georgian Dream]] coalition, which won the [[Georgian parliamentary election, 2012|2012 parliamentary election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/1002/georgia-election.html |title=Georgia's president admits defeat in elections|publisher=RTÉ|date=2 October 2012|accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Georgian presidential election, 2013|2013 presidential election]], he voluntarily resigned both his government and party positions, naming his long-time personal assistant [[Irakli Gharibashvili]] as his successor. On 26 April 2018, the incumbent chairperson of the Georgian Dream-Democratic Georgia party, PM Giorgi Kvirikashvili, announced that Ivanishvili would return as chairperson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=31047|title=Ex-PM Ivanishvili to Chair Georgian Dream Party|publisher=Civil Georgia|date=26 April 2018|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dual citizen of Russian Federation and Georgia, latter granted by Saakashvili, In March 2010, Ivanishvili was granted another  trio French citizenship. In October 2011, he was deprived of his Georgian citizenship "according to Article 32 of the Georgian Law on Citizenship",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/nationality/National%20legislation/Georgia%20Law%20on%20Citizenship_ENG.pdf |title=LAW OF THE REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA ON CITIZENSHIP OF GEORGIA |accessdate=2012-07-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418015240/http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/nationality/National%20legislation/Georgia%20Law%20on%20Citizenship_ENG.pdf |archivedate=18 April 2010 |df=dmy }} Council of Europe unofficial translation&lt;/ref&gt; shortly after he had announced his intention to form a political party to challenge Georgian President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neurope.eu/article/georgia-illegally-denied-ivanishvili-citizenship Georgia illegally denied Ivanishvili citizenship]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Ivanishvili was ranked at number 153 in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine's annual list of the world's billionaires with an estimated worth of $6.4 billion, making him Georgia's richest person, France ranking is unknown.&lt;ref name=forbes-2/&gt;

==Early life==
Bidzina Ivanishvili was born the youngest of five children to a poor family in the Georgian village of [[Chorvila]]. His father worked in a [[manganese]] factory. He graduated from high school in [[Sachkhere]] and went to [[Tbilisi State University]] to study engineering and economics. In 1982, he went to Moscow to pursue a Ph.D. in economics at the [[Moscow State University of Railway Engineering]].&lt;ref name="prospect"&gt;Wendell Steavenson, [http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2010/07/bidzina-ivanishvili-georgia-billionaire-philanthropist/ "The good oligarch"] ''Prospect Magazine'' (21 July 2010). Retrieved 11 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business interests==
Prior to 1990 while living in Moscow, Ivanishvili met [[Vitaly Malkin]], a Russian businessman currently into politics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20120412/172784196.html|title=Buryatia Senator Richest in Russian Upper House|publisher=RIA Novosti|accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he formed a partnership selling computers, and later importing what was then a novelty in [[Russia]], [[push-button telephone]]s.&lt;ref name="prospect"/&gt; The source of his great wealth is metals and banking. [[Forbes]] magazine's description of the secret of his success could apply to dozens of other oligarchs in Russia: "He bought firms not needed by anybody for tens of millions of dollars and sold them for billions of dollars." In 1990 he and Malkin set up "[[Rossiysky Kredit]]", which is up to now Ivanishvili's biggest holding. Over the years, he sold other businesses accumulated by him during the [[Privatization in Russia|privatization era in Russia]], investing the proceeds in the Russian stock market. He has also interests in hotels, including [[Hotel Lux]], and in a Russian chain of drugstores called "Doctor Stoletov". He is also redeveloping a former factory in downtown Moscow into a deluxe housing project, the first blocks of which are to be completed by 2012. &lt;!-- were they completed?? --&gt;

In March 2010, he ranked 173 in 2010 Forbes List of Billionaires, with a reported net worth of 4.8 billion USD.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/10/AGG5.html Forbes List of Billionaires: #173 BIdzina Ivanishvili] ''Forbes Magazine''. Retrieved 11 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he ranked 185 in the 2011 Forbes List with a reported net worth of 5.5 billion USD.&lt;ref name="forbes-2"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/profile/boris-ivanishvili March 2011 profile of Bidzina Ivanishvili] ''Forbes Magazine''. Retrieved 11 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, he ranked 153 in the 2012 Forbes List with a reported net worth of 6.4 billion USD; with his total net worth equaling one third of Georgia's [[Gross Domestic Product]].&lt;ref name=forbes-2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/world/europe/georgia-elects-new-president-but-real-power-will-rest-with-next-premier.html?hp&amp;_r=0 | title =Georgia Elects New President, but Real Power Will Rest With Next Premier | author =David M.

==Political career==

[[File:Bidzina Ivanishvili residence.jpg|thumb|170px|Ivanishvili's residence in [[Tbilisi]], designed by [[Shin Takamatsu]].]]
In April 2012, he established the [[Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia]] party with the intention to challenge the ruling [[United National Movement (Georgia)|United National Movement]] in the parliamentary election scheduled for October 2012.&lt;ref name="civil-1"&gt;[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=24683 Ivanishvili's Political Party Launched]. Civil Georgia. 21 April 2012. Accessed 12 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Georgian Dream coalition is composed of the [[Republican Party of Georgia]], [[Our Georgia – Free Democrats]], the [[National Forum (Georgia)|National Forum]], the [[Conservative Party of Georgia]] and the [[Industry Will Save Georgia]] party. The head of the latter party publicly acknowledged in April 2012 that he doesn't share all of Ivanishvili's views on foreign policy, especially when it comes to joining NATO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=24652|title=Industrialists Party Joins Ivanishvili-Led Coalition|publisher=Civil|accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 June 2012, a USD 90.9&amp;nbsp;million fine was imposed on Ivanishvili for alleged violation of the Georgian legislation on party funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=24876|title=Ivanishvili Fined with USD 90.9 Million |publisher=Civil|accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivanishvili is also under investigation on charges of using his companies Burji, Elita Burji, and Global Consulting Group for political and electoral goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=06.07.2012|url=http://control.ge/eng/news/id/245|title=Announcement of the Financial Monitoring Service |publisher=Control|accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Offshore leaks]] revelations of [[ICIJ]] about global offshore networks Premier Ivanishvili is mentioned among the most prominent figures. The documents show, that he has been director of the front company [[Bosherston Overseas Corporation]] in the  [[British Virgin Islands]] (2006), a front company which still exists. The premier did not deny this and his spokesman commented: "For the reporting period of 2011-2012 Prime Minister Ivanishvili had no interest in the company you have mentioned in your inquiry and therefore there was no obligation to report it in his declaration. The Prime Minister takes these reporting requirements seriously and everything is done according to the law".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icij.org/offshore/who-uses-offshore-world Who Uses the Offshore World], 4 April 2013 (retrieved on 8 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ivanishvili officially retired from politics in late 2013, he continues to have influence on Georgian Dream. According to political scientist Kornely Kakachia, he is "outside democratic control, outside institutional checks and balances, yet he is ultimately calling the shots, which puts Georgia in a vulnerable position both vis-à-vis democracy and foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lomsadze|first=Giorgi|title=Georgia: Political Crisis Prompts Speculation About Ivanishvili’s Political Role|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/70911?utm_|work=eurasianet.org|publisher=[[Open Society Institute]]|date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Bidzina Ivanishvili owns several estates, including a mansion above Tbilisi which was specially designed for him by Russian architect Mikhail Khazanov and finished by famous Japanese architect [[Shin Takamatsu]] which is worth an estimated $50 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Julia Ioffe|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/ehhd45fji/bidzina-ivanishvilis-big-house/#gallerycontent|title=Bidzina Ivanishvili's Big House|publisher=Forbes|date=16 February 2012|accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivanishvili is also known by the Russian first name ''Boris'', which he previously used while working in Russia. He was widely reported under that name in the West. However, he has returned to his Georgian first name ''Bidzina'' in 2011.

Recently Ivanishvili became the subject of some interest in the art world, following his reported purchases of works by [[Pablo Picasso]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dittmar, [https://www.welt.de/politik/article1311902/Der_steinerne_Zeuge_des_stalinistischen_Terrors.html "Der steinerne Zeuge des stalinistischen Terrors"]. ''Die Welt'' (30 October 2007). Retrieved 11 November 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the contemporary artist [[Peter Doig]] at international auctions. Ivanishvili bought [[Niko Pirosmani]]'s, "Arsenal Hill at night", paying a record $1.5 million for a painting by a Georgian artist. He then donated the painting to the State Museum of Arts of Georgia.&lt;ref name=forbes-2/&gt;

Bidzina Ivanishvili is married to Eka Khvedelidze.&lt;ref&gt;[https://uk.news.yahoo.com/photos/georgias-prime-minister-presidential-candidate-bidzina-ivanishvili-l-photo-113644221.html Georgia's Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili and his wife Eka Khvedelidze] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915141646/https://uk.news.yahoo.com/photos/georgias-prime-minister-presidential-candidate-bidzina-ivanishvili-l-photo-113644221.html |date=15 September 2014 }} Yahoo News&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his three sons have [[albinism]], including [[Bera (rapper)|Bera]], a well-known singer and rapper in Georgia. "Georgian Dream" is a rap song by Bera and became an inspiration to his father who named the party he founded in 2012 [[Georgian Dream]] (full name Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia) after his son's rap song.

The '''Broadhurst Theatre''' is a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[theatre (structure)|theatre]] located at 235 West 44th Street in [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=PB&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Playbill]]|url=http://www.playbill.com/reference/theatre_info/broadhurst-theatre-34705|title=Broadhurst Theatre (Broadway)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was designed by architect [[Herbert J. Krapp]], a well-known theatre designer who had been working directly with the [[Shubert brothers]]; the Broadhurst opened September 27, 1917. Built back-to-back with the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic]], it was meant to resemble the style of the neighboring [[Shubert Theatre (Broadway)|Shubert]] and [[Booth Theatre|Booth]] theaters designed by Henry B. Herts, using less expensive brick and [[Architectural terracotta|terra cotta]] materials on the discreetly neoclassical façades{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} 

It was named after [[George Howells Broadhurst]], an [[English-American|Anglo-American]] [[dramatist]] who came to [[United States|America]] in 1886. In addition to writing plays, he managed theaters in [[Milwaukee]], [[Baltimore]], and [[San Francisco]] before he decided to open his own in association with the Shubert brothers. The theatre was constructed to house both musicals and plays, which it has done successfully for more than a century. It has been designated a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City landmark]].

The Broadhurst opened on September 27, 1917 with [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Misalliance]]'', the first New York production of the philosophical 1910 comedy. It ran for only 52 performances and was not performed on Broadway again until 1953.

Recent tenants include ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'', which in October 2006 began an intended six-month-long return engagement that finally closed in January 2008; and 2008 revivals of ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'', with an all-[[African American]] cast including [[Terrence Howard]], [[Anika Noni Rose]], [[James Earl Jones]], and [[Phylicia Rashad]], and ''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]'', starring [[Daniel Radcliffe]] and [[Richard Griffiths]]. The theatre is also notable for hosting [[Jerry Seinfeld]]'s final performance of his original stand up material, which was filmed for an [[HBO]] special shortly after the finale of his long-running sitcom.

{{Accounting}}

A '''Comprehensive Annual Financial Report''' (CAFR) is a set of U.S. [[government financial statements]] comprising the financial report of a state, municipal or other governmental entity that complies with the accounting requirements promulgated by the [[Governmental Accounting Standards Board]] (GASB).  GASB provides standards for the content of a CAFR in its annually updated publication ''Codification of Governmental Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Earl|title=Accounting for Governmental &amp; Nonprofit Entities|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin|location=Page 13|isbn=0073379603|edition=15th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Federal Government adheres to standards determined by the [[Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board]] (FASAB).

A CAFR is compiled by a state, municipal or other governmental accounting staff and audited by an external [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA) certified accounting firm utilizing GASB requirements. It is composed of three sections: Introductory, Financial and Statistical.&lt;ref&gt;2005 Governmental Accounting, Auditing, and Financial Reporting, page 151&lt;/ref&gt; It combines the financial information of [[fund accounting]] and [[Government-sponsored enterprise|Enterprise Authorities]] accounting.

==History==
The National Committee on Municipal Accounting (NCMA) was formed in 1934 by the [[Government Financial Officers Association]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfoa.org/  Government Financial Officers Association] Web Site&lt;/ref&gt; to create accounting standards. As a result of its work, the 'Principles of Municipal Accounting', the predecessor to the CAFR, was created. The successor to the NCMA, the National Council on Governmental Accounting (NCGA), issued 'Governmental Accounting, Auditing and Financial Reporting', which is the basis of the format for the current standard. This document, known as the "Blue Book", and its successors documented the CAFR accounting structure and provided standardization and example documents. By 1946, the various [[Political divisions of the United States|levels of government]]—federal, state, local and municipal—each began producing a CAFR to catalog an accurate picture of institutional funds, enterprise or financial holdings, assets and [[Fixed income|total investment incomes]] for those government and nongovernmental entities using the report. This measure is above and beyond the budget process and replaced what was regularly an "off-the-books" practice called the "general [[Fixed asset|fixed-asset]] account group". General Purpose government "budget" reports did not reflect accounting of this financial data, only reporting on the budget or "rainy day" funds or pension fund investments. By the 1970s, the CAFR became the nationwide paradigm for local government accounting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/business-finance-encyclopedia/government-financial-reporting  "Government Financial Reporting."] Encyclopedia of Business and Finance. Ed. Allison McClintic Marion. Gale Cengage, 2001. eNotes.com. 2006. 18 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting CAFR is presented to the GFOA, which conducts each year a review of applicant local government CAFRs and upon review awards their Certificate of Achievement Award for Excellence in Financial Reporting to those local governments that are in compliance with their CAFR accounting standards of preparation. Presently, accounting principles for government entities are set by transmittal letters issued to local governments by the GASB.

==Differences between a general budget and a CAFR==
The primary difference between a budget and a CAFR is a budget is a plan for a specific fiscal period (often a year) primarily showing where tax income is to be allocated. The CAFR contains the results of the period (year) with previous years accumulations. A CAFR shows the total of all financial accounting that a general purpose budget reports does not. The CAFR contains a section that provides a comparison of period budget and actual. Additionally, the CAFR gives a detailed showing of investment accounts by category reflecting balances over previous years, or in plain language using a personal example in comparison would be the difference between: Your house Budget for the year vs your statement of "Net Worth" covering the financial accounting over your lifetime. 1-year vs your lifetime.

A Government budget document is a blueprint for a "specific grouping" of government agencies' spending over the course of an annual financial period. General Purpose Budgets contain both the spending categories of specified units of government, such as school districts, social services, transportation, courts, police, fire, and park services; along with estimates of revenues expected to occur during the year, such as investment return; due from other funds, overrides of money from the previous year, and tax payments. They are usually more limited to the expected costs of running the aforementioned [[government operations]] through tax income as opposed to describing the status of any government fixed assets and investment wealth.

A CAFR is a report of the complete overall financial results not just for the year but what has accumulated since the inception of that local government of both those "specific groupings" of government agencies that appear in the current fiscal year General Purpose Budget and all other agencies and departments. These can be autonomous, enterprise (for example government or city owned golf courses), recycling, water, sewer, and financial management - often these agencies were created with the inception of that local, state or government. The CAFR provides information about all of these other government agencies that may have their own budgets and separate investment accounts but their financial holdings are ''not'' combined with the general purpose '''budget''' that the same government presents to the public. The CAFR, or as it is called in CANADA CanFR can be used along with a budget document to compare the organizations total financial standing to the annual general purpose budget. The CAFR is the complete showing of the financial investment and income records from all sources, that reflects what has developed over decades whereas a budget report is an inferior document to the CAFR being that it is primarily focused on what revenue is expected to be brought in and spent for just the year.

In contrast with the rules applying to governments, publicly traded US companies are required by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), to provide their Annual Financial Report (AFR) to every shareholder each year. Government's accounting falls under GAP (Generally Accepted Procedures)overseen by GASB.org for government accounting. US Companies have their own standards of accounting which would not be accepted by the SEC if US Companies attempted to use local Government's GAP accounting. To view the GASB.org accounting changes in local government CAFR GAP accounting, a short version of each change going back to 1984 can be viewed here - &lt;ref&gt;[http://gasb.org/cs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;pagename=GASB%2FPage%2FGASBSectionPage&amp;cid=1176156669308 GFOA CAFR ACCOUNTING CHANGES]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media Coverage &amp; Misconceptions ==


News stories covering financial issues of government cite "rainy day funds" or special "ear marked" funds, loans between government entities, sales of government holdings in, for example, shares of a health care insurance company, self insurance management funds, debt repayment funds that can be up to 40% of the debt itself, and then the "budget" is often referred to, along with mentions of pension funds investments, but the full accounting of assets of government entities, the "CAFR" is typically not mentioned.{{Citation needed|reason=Which news stories are these? Need some examples.|date=September 2017}}

"Alternative" media, since the late 1990s, has exposed segments of the public to the subject of the (U.S.) CAFR contributing to the topic being labeled as "conspiracy theory" or "soap box" issue. {{Citation needed|reason=Which alternative media are we talking about here? Who is labeling these things "conspiracy theory" or "soap box"?|date=September 2017}} In all reality, local government's "Net Worth" accounting document, the CAFR is a mandatory review document for any responsible taxpaying citizen.

Reporting on government financial issues can be seen as sensationalized in dealing with alleged excesses in spending or tucked away wealth held not clearly visible in the budgetary accounting. A $10,000 dollar Christmas tree for example, or vague mentions of "many billions" in referring to issues around the road improvement, self-insurance, debt repayment, and pension funds managed by a state. {{Citation needed|reason=Which news stories are these? Need some examples.|date=September 2017}}

The State of TX based on good due diligence to its residents publishes a "Cash Report" that lists all funds managed by the state. [http://www.texastransparency.org/State_Finance/Budget_Finance/Reports/Cash_Report/14/texas_annual_cash_report_2014.pdf The 2014 TX Cash Report] can be viewed here - &lt;ref&gt;http://www.texastransparency.org/State_Finance/Budget_Finance/Reports/Cash_Report/14/texas_annual_cash_report_2014.pdf where several thousand separate funds managed by the State of TX can be viewed.&lt;/ref&gt;  In one recent series of reports, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100131020023/http://www.kaco.org/Home.htm Kentucky Association of Counties] whose spending came under scrutiny by the [[Lexington Herald-Leader]] provided some awareness of these types of entities as well as their surpluses and the claimed spending excesses while using money acquired from government fees for products like municipal insurance at premium rates, which build surpluses beyond the needs of the entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kentucky.com/2010/04/13/1222627/attorney-general-investigating.html Attorney general investigating KLC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical topics of the alternative media may include examples of: government entities financing each other's bond issues; Orange County California's or other divisions of government investments in derivatives; financial deals that are kept from the public to entice businesses to locate in a state, which may include tax incentives in exchange for stock assets in a company. {{Citation needed|reason=Which news stories are these? Need some examples.|date=September 2017}}
 
Much of both the mainstream and alternative media coverage of the topic of government financial issues must be considered a factor in public's confidence towards issues of government [[accountability]].

{{Anti-consumerism |Theories}}
'''Conspicuous consumption''' is the spending of money on and the acquiring of [[Luxury good|luxury]] [[goods and services]] to publicly display [[economic power]]—of the income or of the accumulated wealth of the buyer. To the conspicuous [[consumer]], such a public display of [[discretionary income|discretionary]] economic power is a means of either attaining or maintaining a given [[social status]].&lt;ref name="Veblen 1899"&gt;{{cite book |last=Veblen |first=Thorstein |title=The Theory of the Leisure Class |publisher=Project Gutenberg |year=1899}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition, Alan Bullock, Stephen Trombley, Eds., 1993, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of [[Thorstein Veblen]]'s sociology of conspicuous consumption produced the term '''invidious consumption''', the ostentatious consumption of goods that is meant to provoke the [[envy]] of other people; and the term '''conspicuous compassion''', the deliberate use of [[Charity (practice)|charitable donations of money]] in order to enhance the [[Reputation|social prestige]] of the donor, with a display of superior socio-economic status.&lt;ref name="West 2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=West |first=Patrick |title=Conspicuous Compassion: Why Sometimes It Really Is Cruel To Be Kind |location=London |publisher=Civitas, Institute for the Study of Civil Society |year=2004 |isbn=1-903386-34-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and evolution==
The [[Economics|economist]] and [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Thorstein Veblen]] (1857–1929) introduced the term "conspicuous consumption" in 1899 in his book ''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class|The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions]]''. Veblen described the behavioural characteristics of the ''[[nouveau riche]]'' (new rich) [[social class]] which emerged as a result of [[capital accumulation]] during the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] ({{circa}} 1860–1914).&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, Thorstein. (1899) ''Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions''. New York: Macmillan. 400 pp., also: 1994 Dover paperback edition, {{ISBN|0-486-28062-4}}, 1994 Penguin Classics edition, {{ISBN|0-14-018795-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In that nineteenth-century social and historical context, the term "conspicuous consumption" applied narrowly in association with the men, women, and families of the [[upper class]] who applied their great wealth as a means of publicly manifesting their [[Power (social and political) |social power]] and [[Social status|prestige]], either real or perceived.

In the twentieth century the significant improvement of the material [[standard of living | standard-of-living]] of societies and the consequent growth of the [[middle class]] saw the term "conspicuous consumption" broadly applied to the men, women, and households who possessed the [[discretionary income]] that allowed them to practice the patterns of economic [[Consumerism|consumption]]—of goods and services—which were motivated by the desire for [[Reputation|prestige]], the public display of [[social status]], rather than by the intrinsic, practical [[utility]] of the goods and the services proper. In the 1920s economists, such as [[Paul Nystrom]] (1878–1969), proposed that changes in the style of life, made feasible by the economics of the [[industrial age]], had induced in the mass of society a "philosophy of futility" that would increase the consumption of goods and services as a social fashion – i.e. an activity done for its own sake. In that context, commentators discuss "conspicuous consumption" either as a [[behavioural addiction]] or as a [[narcissism|narcissistic behaviour]], or as both, emphasising the psychological conditions induced by [[consumerism]]—the desire for the immediate gratification of [[Hedonism|hedonic]] expectations.

Sociologically, conspicuous consumption was thought{{when?|date=December 2017}}{{by whom?|date=December 2017}} to comprise socio-economic behaviours practiced by rich people; yet economic research indicated that conspicuous consumption is a socio-economic behaviour common to the poor social-classes and economic groups, and common to the societies of countries with [[Emerging markets|emerging economies]]. Among such people, displays of wealth are used to psychologically combat the impression of poverty, usually because such men and women belong to a socio-economic class society perceives as poor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/consumption?ca=2I7oDJW7kruafuw%2BAmt%2FgGV%2BRts3U%2F5faeR%2BTMotW8A%3D Virginia Postrel, "Inconspicuous Consumption", ''The Atlantic'', July/August 2008. "Conspicuous consumption, this research suggests, is not an unambiguous signal of personal affluence. It's a sign of belonging to a relatively poor group."]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Millionaire Next Door|The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America's Wealthy]]'' (1996), Thomas J. Stanley and [[William D. Danko]] reported that Americans with a net worth of more than one million dollars are likely to avoid conspicuous consumption, and that millionaires tend to practice [[frugality]] - for example, preferring to buy used cars with cash rather than new cars with credit, in order to avoid material depreciation and paying interest for a loan to buy a new car.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Stanley, William D. Danko, {{Google books |id=ldpaww5kkmoC |title= The Millionaire Next Door}}, Simon and Schuster, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conspicuous compassion''', the practice of publicly donating large sums of money to [[Charity (practice)|charity]] to enhance the [[Reputation|social prestige]] of the donor, is sometimes described{{by whom?|date=December 2017}} as a type of conspicuous consumption.&lt;ref name="West 2004"/&gt; This behaviour has long been recognised and sometimes attacked—for example, the [[New Testament]] story ''[[Lesson of the widow's mite]]'' criticises wealthy people who make large donations ostentatiously while praising poorer people who make small but comparatively more difficult donations in private.&lt;ref&gt;

==Consumerism theory==
As proposed by Thorstein Veblen in the 19th century, conspicuous consumption (spending money to buy goods and services for their own sake) explains the psychological mechanics of a [[consumer society]], and the increase in the number and the types of the goods and services that people consider necessary to and for their lives in a developed economy.

Supporting interpretations and explanations of contemporary conspicuous consumption are presented in ''Consumer Culture'' (1996), by C. Lury,&lt;ref name="Consumer Culture"&gt;Lury, C. (1996) Consumer Culture. London: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Consumer Culture and Modernity'' (1997), by D. Slater,&lt;ref name="Consumer Culture and Modernity"&gt;Slater, D. (1997) Consumer Culture and Modernity. London: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Symbolic Exchange and Death'' (1998), by [[Jean Baudrillard]],&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard, J. (1998b) Symbolic Exchange and Death. London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Spent: Sex, Evolution, and the Secrets of Consumerism'' (2009), by [[Geoffrey Miller (evolutionary psychologist)#Evolutionary psychology of consumerism|Geoffrey Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller G, ''Spent: sex, evolution and the secrets of consumerism'', Random House, London, 2009 ({{ISBN|9780670020621}})&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, ''Hiding in the Light'' (1994), by D. Hebdige, proposed that conspicuous consumption is a form of displaying a [[personal identity]],&lt;ref name="Consumer Culture and Modernity" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hebdige, D. (1994) Hiding in the Light. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E. (eds.) Chic Thrills. A Fashion Reader. London: HarperCollins&lt;/ref&gt; and a consequent function of [[advertising]], as proposed in ''Ads, Fads, and Consumer Culture'' (2000), by A. A. Berger.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, A. A. (2000) Ads, Fads, and Consumer Culture. Lanham: Rowman and Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each variant interpretation and complementary explanation is derived from Thorstein Veblen's original sociologic proposition in ''The Theory of the Leisure Class'': that conspicuous consumption is a psychological end in itself, from which the practitioner (man, woman, family) derived the [[honour]] of superior [[social status]].

==Distinctions of type==
* '''Definitions''' – The term '''conspicuous consumption''' denotes the act of buying many things, especially expensive things, that are not necessary to one's life, done in a way that makes people notice the buyer's having bought the merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;Longman American Dictionary, 2000, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; In the article "Veblen, Bourdieu, and Conspicuous Consumption" (2001), A. Trigg defined conspicuous consumption as the behaviours whereby a man or a woman can display great wealth, by means of idleness—expending much time in the practice of leisure activities, and spending much money to consume [[luxury good]]s and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trigg |first=A. |year=2001 |title=Veblen, Bourdieu, and conspicuous consumption |journal=Journal of Economic Issues |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=99–115 |jstor=4227638 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Self-worth''' – In the book ''Income, Saving and the Theory of Consumer Behavior'' (1949), J.S. Duesenberry proposed that a person's conspicuous consumption psychologically depends not only upon the actual level of spending, but also depends upon the degree of his or her spending, as compared with and to the spending of other people. That the conspicuous consumer is motivated by the importance, to him or to her, of the opinion of the social and economic reference groups for whom are performed the patterns of conspicuous consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Duesenberry, J.S. (1949), ''Income, Saving and the Theory of Consumer Behavior'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shukla, P. (2008), "Conspicuous Consumption Among Middle age Consumers: Psychological and Brand Antecedents", ''Journal of Product and Brand Management'', Vol. 17, No. 1, pp. 25–36&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Aggressive ostentation''' – In the television report "Aggressive Ostentation" (2009), [[Dick Meyer]] said that conspicuous consumption is a form of anger towards society, an "aggressive ostentation" that is an [[antisocial behaviour]], which arose from the [[social alienation]] suffered by men, women, and families who feel they have become [[anonymity|anonymous]] in and to their societies, which feeling of alienation is aggravated by the decay of the [[communitarian]] ethic essential to a person feeling him or herself part of the whole society.&lt;ref name="Aggressive Ostentation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/13/opinion/meyer/main1206612.shtml/ |title=Aggressive Ostentation |first=Bootie |last=Cosgrove-Mather |author2=Meyer, Dick |publisher=CBS News |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2011-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Shelter and transport''' – In the U.S., the trend towards building houses that were larger-than-needed, by a [[nuclear family]], began in the 1950s. Decades later, in the year 2000, that practice of conspicuous consumption resulted in people buying houses that were double the average size needed to comfortably house a nuclear family.&lt;ref name="Monster Homes R Us"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lloyd |first=Carol |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2005/10/14/carollloyd.DTL |title=Monster Homes R Us: American homes are monuments to conspicuous consumption|work=SF Chronicle |date=2005-10-14 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative consequences of either buying or building an oversized house was either the loss of or the reduction of the family's domestic recreational space—the back yard and the front yard; the spending of old-age retirement funds to pay for a too-big house; and over-long [[commuting]] time, from house to job, and vice versa, because the required plot of land was unavailable near a city.

:Oversized houses facilitated other forms of conspicuous consumption, such as an oversized garage for the family's oversized motor vehicles or buying more clothing to fill larger clothes closets. Conspicuous consumption becomes a self-generating cycle of spending money for the sake of social prestige. Analogous to the consumer trend for oversized houses is the trend towards buying oversized light-trucks, specifically the off-road [[SUV|sport-utility vehicle]] type (cf. [[station wagon|station wagon and estate car]]), as a form of psychologically comforting conspicuous consumption, because such big motor-vehicles usually are bought by people who reside in a city, an urban nuclear family.&lt;ref name="Monster Homes R Us"/&gt;

* '''Prestige''' – In the article "Status Consumption in Consumer Behaviour: Scale Development and Validation" (1999), J.K. Eastman ''et al.'' said that '''status consumption''' is based upon conspicuous consumption; yet, the literature of contemporary [[marketing]] does not establish definitive meanings for the terms ''status consumption'' and ''conspicuous consumption''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eastman |first=J. K. |last2=Goldsmith |first2=R. E. |last3=Flynn |first3=L. R. |year=1999 |title=Status Consumption in Consumer Behaviour: Scale Development and Validation |journal=Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=41–51 |doi=10.1080/10696679.1999.11501839}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shukla2&gt;{{Cite podcast|url=http://www.pauravshukla.com/status-luxury-consumption-among-british-and-indian-consumers| title = Status (luxury) consumption among British and Indian consumers| website =Paurav Shukla| publisher =International Marketing Review| host =Shukla, Paurav| date =2010-01-09| accessdate =2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the article "Status Brands: Examining the Effects of Non-product-related Brand Associations on Status and Conspicuous Consumption" (2002), A. O'Cass and H. Frost said that sociologists often incorrectly used the terms "status consumption" and "conspicuous consumption" as interchangeable and equivalent terms. In a later study, O'Cass and Frost determined that, as sociologic constructs, the terms "status consumption" and "conspicuous consumption" denote different sociologic behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Cass |first=A. |last2=Frost |first2=H. |year=2002 |title=Status Brands: Examining the Effects of Non-product-related Brand Associations on Status and Conspicuous Consumption |journal=Journal of Product &amp; Brand Management |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=67–88 |doi=10.1108/10610420210423455}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the ambiguities of denotation and connotation of the term "conspicuous consumption", in the article "Conspicuous Consumption: A Literature Review" (1984), R. Mason reported that the classical, general theories of consumer decision-processes do not readily accommodate the construct of "conspicuous consumption", because the nature of said socio-economic behaviours varies according to the social class and the economic group studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=R. |year=1984 |title=Conspicuous Consumption: A Literature Review |journal=European Journal of Marketing |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=26–39 |doi=10.1108/eum0000000004779}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Motivations''' – In the article "Status Consumption in Cross-national Context: Socio–Psychological, Brand and Situational Antecedents" (2010), Paurav Shukla said that, whilst marketing and sales researchers recognise the importance of the buyer's social and psychological environment—the definition of the term '''status-directed consumption''' remains ambiguous, because, to develop a comprehensive general theory requires that social scientists accept two fundamental assumptions, which usually do not concord. First, though the "rational" (economic) and the "irrational" (psychologic) elements of consumer decision-making often influence a person's decision to buy particular goods and services, marketing and sales researchers usually consider the rational element dominant in a person's decision to buy the particular goods and services. Second, the consumer perceives the [[utility]] of the product (the goods, the services) as a prime consideration in evaluating its usefulness, i.e. the ''reason'' to buy the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shukla |first=P. |year=2010 |title=Status Consumption in Cross-national Context: Socio-psychological, Brand and Situational Antecedents |journal=International Marketing Review |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=108–129 |doi=10.1108/02651331011020429 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These assumptions, required for the development of a general theory of '''brand selection and brand purchase''', are problematic, because the resultant theories tend either to misunderstand or to ignore the "irrational" element in the behaviour of the buyer-as-consumer; and because conspicuous consumption is a behaviour predominantly "psychological" in motivation and expression, Therefore, a comprehensive, general theory of conspicuous consumption would require a separate construct for the psychological (irrational) elements of the socio-economic phenomenon that is conspicuous consumption.

==Criticism==

High levels of conspicuous consumption may be seen as socially undesirable on two grounds; firstly, as it is often associated with high relative income, high levels of conspicuous consumption may be an indicator of high levels of income inequality, which may be found intrinsically or instrumentally objectionable; secondly conspicuous consumption differs from other forms of consumption in that the main reason for the purchase of [[positional good]]s is not due to the additional direct utility provided by the goods alleged high quality, but rather the social prestige associated with the consumption of that good. One downside of this search for status is that individual purchases of positional goods may at a social level be self-defeating due to external effects. In this case, the [[externality]] is [[status anxiety]], the loss of social status suffered by people whose stock of high-status goods (positional goods) is diminished, in relation to the stocks of other conspicuous consumers, as they increase their consumption of high-status goods and services; effectively, status-seeking is a [[zero-sum game]]—by definition, the rise of one person in the [[Social class|social hierarchy]] can occur only at the expense of other people. Therefore, the conspicuous consumption of luxury goods and services (positional goods) is an economic loss—like competitive military spending (an arms race),  wherein each country must match the military expenditures of other countries in the arms race, or suffer a loss of relative military power. In the case of conspicuous consumption, taxes upon luxury goods diminish societal expenditures on high-status goods, by rendering them more expensive than non-positional goods. In this sense, luxury taxes can be seen as a [[market failure]] correcting  [[Pigovian tax]]—with an apparent negative [[deadweight loss]], these taxes are a  more efficient mechanism for increasing revenue than 'distorting' labour or capital taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Yew-Kwang |last=Ng |title=Diamonds Are a Government's Best Friend: Burden-Free Taxes on Goods Valued for Their Values |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=77 |issue=1 |year=1987 |pages=186–91 |jstor=1806737 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[luxury tax]] applied to goods and services for conspicuous consumption is a type of progressive [[sales tax]] that at least partially corrects the negative [[externality]] associated with the conspicuous consumption of [[positional good]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Daniel |last=Sámano |title=Optimal Linear Taxation of Positional Goods |work=Working paper |location=University of Minnesota |year=2009 |url=http://dsamano.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/8/7/1287492/draftlux05.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Utility from Accumulation'' (2009), Louis Kaplow said that assets exercise an objective social-utility function, i.e. the rich man and the rich woman hoard material assets, because the hoard, itself, functions as status goods that establish his and her socio-economic position within society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.3386/w15595|title=Utility from Accumulation|year=2009|last1=Kaplow|first1=L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When utility is derived directly from accumulation of assets, this lowers the dead weight loss associated with inheritance taxes and raises the optimal rate of inheritance taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/cesifo/ifr014| title = The Tax Treatment of Intergenerational Wealth Transfers| journal = CESifo Economic Studies| volume = 57| issue = 2| pages = 365–401| year = 2011| last1 = Cremer | first1 = H.| last2 = Pestieau | first2 = P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Stuart Mill by John Watkins, 1865.jpg|thumb|right|300px|In the 19th century, the philosopher John Stuart Mill recommended taxing the practice of conspicuous consumption.]]

In place of luxury taxes, the economist [[Robert H. Frank]] proposed the application of a progressive consumption tax; in the article "The Big City: Rich and Poor, Consumed by Consuming" (1998), John Tierney said that as a remedy for the social and psychological malaise that is conspicuous consumption, the personal [[income tax]] should be replaced with a [[progressive tax]] upon the yearly sum of [[discretionary income]] spent on the conspicuous consumption of goods and services.&lt;ref name="The Big City"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tierney |first=John |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/30/nyregion/the-big-city-rich-and-poor-consumed-by-consuming.html |title=The Big City; Rich and Poor, Consumed By Consuming |newspaper=The New York Times|date=1998-11-30|accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another option is the [[redistribution of wealth]], either by means of an [[incomes policy]] - for example the conscious efforts to promote [[wage compression]] under variants of [[Social corporatism]] such as the [[Rehn–Meidner model]] and/or by some mix of progressive taxation and transfer policies, and provision of public goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=L. |last=Micheletto |title=Optimal Nonlinear Redistributive Taxation and Public Good Provision in an Economy with Veblen Effects |journal=Journal of Public Economic Theory |volume=13 |issue=1 |year=2011 |pages=71–96 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9779.2010.01493.x |url=http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:211325/FULLTEXT01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael J. |last=Boskin |first2=Eytan |last2=Sheshinski |title=Optimal Redistributive Taxation When Individual Welfare Depends Upon Relative Income |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=92 |issue=4 |year=1978 |pages=589–601 |jstor=1883177 |doi=10.2307/1883177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thomas |last=Aronsson |first2=Olof |last2=Johansson-Stenman |title=When the Joneses' Consumption Hurts: Optimal Public Good Provision and Nonlinear Income Taxation |journal=[[Journal of Public Economics]] |volume=92 |issue=5–6 |year=2008 |pages=986–997 |doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2007.12.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the activity of conspicuous consumption, itself, is a form of [[superior good]], diminishing the [[income inequality]] of the [[income distribution]] by way of an [[egalitarian]] policy reduces the conspicuous consumption of positional goods and services. In ''Wealth and Welfare'' (1912), the economist [[A. C. Pigou]] said that the redistribution of wealth might lead to great gains in [[Social welfare function|social welfare]]:

{{Quotation| Now the part played by comparative, as distinguished from absolute, income is likely to be small for incomes that only suffice to provide the necessaries and primary comforts of life, but to be large with large incomes. In other words, a larger proportion of the satisfaction yielded by the incomes of rich people comes from their relative, rather than from their absolute, amount. This part of it will not be destroyed if the incomes of all rich people are diminished together. The loss of economic welfare suffered by the rich when command over resources is transferred from them to the poor will, therefore, be substantially smaller relatively to the gain of economic welfare to the poor than a consideration of the law of diminishing utility taken by itself suggests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur Cecil |last=Pigou |title=Wealth and Welfare |year=1912 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The economic case for the taxation of positional, luxury goods has a long history; in the mid-19th century, in ''Principles of Political Economy with some of their Applications to Social Philosophy'' (1848), [[John Stuart Mill]] said:

{{Quotation|I disclaim all asceticism, and by no means wish to see discouraged, either by law or opinion, any indulgence which is sought from a genuine inclination for, any enjoyment of, the thing itself; but a great portion of the expenses of the higher and middle classes in most countries . . . is not incurred for the sake of the pleasure afforded by the things on which the money is spent, but from regard to opinion, and an idea that certain expenses are expected from them, as an appendage of station; and I cannot but think that expenditure of this sort is a most desirable subject of taxation. If taxation discourages it, some good is done, and if not, no harm; for in so far as taxes are levied on things which are desired and possessed from motives of this description, nobody is the worse for them. When a thing is bought not for its use but for its costliness, cheapness is no recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill, ''Principles of Political Economy with some of their Applications to Social Philosophy'', book 5, ch. 6, pt. 7 (W.J. Ashley, ed., Longmans, Green &amp; Co. 1909) (1848)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Event to knowledge''' ('''E2K''') is an [[accounting]] [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] that measures the time from when an event occurs to when the responsible person knows about it.  The shorter the average E2K time, the more timely an organization’s financial information will be.

== Importance of E2K ==

Timeliness is one of the most important characteristics of financial information.  The more timely information is, the more relevant it is to the reader.  E2K helps organizations focus and improve their internal accounting processes.

E2K measures a number of events.  Firstly, it considers the time for a sub-ledger or supporting system to record an event.  If a sub-ledger performs no reporting on its own and it posts to the [[general ledger]] on a [[:wikt:batch|batch]] basis (nightly, weekly, monthly, etc.); then this will elongate the E2K time.

The faster the general ledger can report the impact of an event, the smaller the E2K value.  Waiting for all accounting journals to be posted, balancing, [[bank reconciliation|reconciliation]] and producing paper reports adds to the E2K time.

There are two key E2K measures, the maximum and average E2K values.  The maximum value is the time from when the first [[Financial transaction|transaction]] is entered in a system during a new fiscal period to when it is reported.  An average E2K time may be for an entire system or a sub-component.  For example, E2K can be reported by each sub-ledger (accounts payable, payroll, manufacturing, etc.) or for the entire system.

== Best E2K practice ==

Organizations can reduce their E2K time through a number of strategies: 
1. Implementing and upgrading systems to take advantage of faster close cycles 
2. Use of [[workflow]] technologies to communicate exceptions and critical events to those responsible
3. Reporting Marts and the like away from the [[OLTP]] system for internal reporting
4. Adjust accounting cycles to natural business cycles. 
5. [[Benchmarking|Benchmark]] and set targets to improve current practice.

The '''F Market &amp; Wharves''' line is one of several [[light rail]] lines in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. Unlike most other lines in the system, the F line runs as a [[heritage streetcar]] service, almost exclusively using historic equipment both from San Francisco's retired fleet as well as from cities around the world (although busses are added during peak commute hours). While the F line is operated by the [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]] (Muni), its operation is supported by [[Market Street Railway (nonprofit)|Market Street Railway]], a nonprofit organization of [[Tram|streetcar]] enthusiasts which raises funds and helps to restore vintage streetcars.

Despite its heritage status, the F Market &amp; Wharves line is an integral part of Muni's intermodal urban transport network, operating at frequent intervals for 20 hours a day, seven days a week. It carries local commuters and tourists alike, linking residential, business and leisure oriented areas of the city. Unlike the [[San Francisco cable car system]], the cheaper standard Muni fare system applies.

==History==

===Previous F-Line===
{{Main article|F Stockton}}
Cable car operations along Market Street began in 1888. Service was electrified 1906.&lt;ref name=Chronology /&gt;

In 1915, the [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]] started the F-Stockton route, which ran from Laguna (later Scott) and Chestnut Streets in the [[Marina District, San Francisco, California|Marina]] down Stockton Street to 4th and Market Streets near [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]], later extended to the Southern Pacific Depot (currently the [[San Francisco 4th &amp; King Street Station|Caltrain Depot]]) in 1947. The streetcar line was discontinued in 1951 and was replaced by the [[List of San Francisco Municipal Railway lines|30-Stockton]] route, which still runs today.

The F-line designation was therefore available for use by the current line, although that service is over a completely different route from the F-line of 1915 to 1951.

===Previous lines on Market Street===
[[File:3 MUNI PCC Photos at Market St. near 2nd St. (26320435574).jpg|thumb|left|A PCC Streetcar on the K Ingleside route on Market Street in 1967]]
[[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] is a major transit artery for the city of San Francisco, and has carried in turn [[Horsecar|horse-drawn streetcars]], [[cable car (railway)|cable cars]] and electric [[tram|streetcars]]. In the 1960s construction began on the [[Market Street Subway]], which would carry [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]]'s trains on its lower level. All streetcar lines currently operating in the subway previously ran on the surface of Market Street, and were eventually diverted into the upper level of the tunnel. This diversion, together with the provision of new [[light rail]] cars, resulted in today's [[Muni Metro]] system.

The diversion of the Market Street streetcar lines into tunnel and the replacement of the existing streetcars with new light rail cars was completed by November 1982. However, the street trackage on Market Street was retained, and many of the old streetcars were still in storage.

===Historic Trolley Festivals===
[[File:MUNI 130 at the Transbay Terminal in San Francisco, CA in October 1985 (32713992525).jpg|thumb|left|Streetcar #130 at the [[San Francisco Transbay Terminal|Transbay Terminal]] in 1985]]
In 1982, [[San Francisco cable car system|San Francisco's cable car lines]] were shut down for almost two years to allow for a major rebuild. Temporary weekend historic streetcar service started on July 3, 1982 as part of 4th of July celebrations and ran until September of that year.&lt;ref name=Chronology&gt;{{Muni Chronology}}&lt;/ref&gt; To provide a more regular alternative tourist attraction during this period, the San Francisco Historic Trolley Festivals began in 1983.&lt;ref name="perles-tours"&gt;{{cite book|last=Perles|first=Anthony|title=Tours of Discovery: A San Francisco Muni Album|year=1984|publisher=[[Interurban Press]]|isbn=0-916374-60-2|pages=136–142|chapter=Chapter 9: The Trolley Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chronology /&gt; These summertime operations of vintage streetcars on Market Street were a joint project of the [[San Francisco Chamber of Commerce]] and Muni.&lt;ref name=perles-tours/&gt;

The trolley festival route went from the [[Transbay Terminal]] at First and Mission Streets to Market, then up the retained Market Street tracks to Duboce Avenue. From there, it followed a 'temporary' streetcar detour built in the 1970s to bypass subway construction under Market: Duboce, Church Street, and [[Castro station|17th Street to Castro]].

===F-Market Line===
[[File:Muni 1053 at 17th and Castro, September 1999.jpg|thumb|left|Streetcar #1053 at 17th and Castro in 1999]]
The Trolley Festival proved so successful it was repeated every year until 1987. In that year, preparation began for the introduction of a permanent F line. After that year’s festival finished, Muni replaced the old Market Street tracks with new ones, restoring tracks to upper Market Street and recreating a line to Castro. Different types of vintage streetcars were evaluated to provide the backbone of the F-line fleet, resulting in the decision to use the [[PCC streetcar|PCC car]], due in part to its historic San Francisco transit use. Fourteen such cars were acquired second-hand from [[Philadelphia]] to add to three of Muni’s own retired double-ended PCCs.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

On September 1, 1995, the F line opened&lt;ref&gt;[[Mac Sebree|Sebree, Mac]]. "Kodachrome PCCs Roll Down Market Street". ''[[Pacific RailNews]]'', November 1995 issue. [[Pentrex]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ptj-june96"&gt;Ehrlich, Peter. "PCCs by the Bay". ''[[Passenger Train Journal]]'', June 1996 issue, pp. 24-31. [[Pentrex]].&lt;/ref&gt; with a parade of PCC cars, painted to represent some of the two dozen North American cities that this type of streetcar once served. Ridership exceeded expectations and the ''8-Market'' was finally completely discontinued on December 29, 1995.&lt;ref name=Chronology /&gt; At that point in history, this was a rare instance in which a streetcar replaced a bus line in operation, rather than the other way around. The need for extra cars resulted in the acquisition of ten [[Peter Witt streetcar|Peter Witt style cars]] just being retired in the city of [[Milan]], Italy. These cars were built in the 1920s to a design once common in North American cities, and [[ATM Class 1500|their sister cars]] are still widely used on the [[Trams in Milan|Milan tramway network]].

===Extension on the Embarcadero===
[[File:San Francisco streetcar at Pier 39.jpg|thumb|left|An F Market &amp; Wharves streetcar at Pier 39]]

The [[Embarcadero, San Francisco|Embarcadero]] is the eastern waterfront roadway of San Francisco, along [[San Francisco Bay]]. At one time busy with port and ferry related traffic, it fell into decline as freight transferred to the [[container terminal]]s of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]] replaced the ferries. In the 1960s the elevated [[California State Route 480|Embarcadero Freeway]] was built above, dividing the city from the bay, but was condemned and demolished after the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]]. Proposals for streetcar service along The Embarcadero were put forward as early as 1974,&lt;ref name="embext"&gt;{{cite web | title = Historic Streetcars | url = http://www.sfmta.com/cms/mfleet/histcars.php | publisher = San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency | accessdate = 2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and historic streetcar service along The Embarcadero was first provided during the 1987 Trolley Festival, using existing [[San Francisco Belt Railroad|Belt Railroad]] tracks on The Embarcadero and towed diesel generators to provide power.

With increasing development of the waterfront for leisure and tourist activities, and the existence of [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco, California|Fisherman's Wharf]] and [[Pier 39]] at its northern end, it was decided to rebuild the Embarcadero as a tree-lined [[boulevard]] complete with a streetcar reservation. The section north of Market Street was to be served by an extension of the F line. 
Tracks were extended on the northern end of Market to connect with the Embarcadero tracks. In March 2000, service on the F line began along the new extension to Fisherman's Wharf.&lt;ref name="msrhist"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Market Street Railway | url = http://www.streetcar.org/mim/streetcars/history/index.html | title = A brief history of the F-line | accessdate = March 20, 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061003013218/http://www.streetcar.org/mim/streetcars/history/index.html | archive-date = October 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A month later, Muni dedicated a car to [[Herb Caen]], the noted columnist for the [[San Francisco Chronicle]] perhaps most famous for coining the phrase ''Baghdad by the Bay'' to describe The City. The car, Streetcar No. 130, which was originally delivered in 1914, contains wood paneling and is decorated with many quotes from Caen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Take-a-trip-with-Herb-Caen-who-lives-on-in-an-2607409.php |title=Take a trip with Herb Caen, who lives on in an F-Market streetcar |author=King, John |date=22 September 2005 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/pressreleases/2014/Press%20Release--SFMTA%20Announces%20Details%20of%20Muni%20Heritage%20Weekend%2010.29.14.pdf |title=SFMTA Announces Details of Muni Heritage Weekend |author=Rose, Paul |date=29 October 2014 |publisher=San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency |accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stations==

The trolleys operate continuously, reversing direction via loops at the ends of the line. Although the cars are able to utilize the tunnels, the F-line operates on the street level. Along Market Street, trolleys stop at street level above nearby [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] and [[Muni Metro]] stations located below street level. The stations and stops are as follows (connections to other routes are noted):

Except for the height of certain platforms (mostly on the T Third Street line), F Market &amp; Wharves line cars are fully compatible with the rest of the [[Muni Metro]] system. Indeed, the cars can be privately chartered and are operated all over the system.

==Car fleet==
{{Further information|San Francisco Municipal Railway fleet}}
Muni owns a large selection of equipment for use on the F line, although not all of them are in service at the same time. The car fleet includes four sub-fleets: [[PCC streetcar]]s, [[Peter Witt streetcar]]s, pre-PCC veteran streetcars from San Francisco, and a diverse collection of 10 streetcars and trams from various overseas operators.&lt;ref name="fleet"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.streetcar.org/mim/streetcars/fleet/index.html | title = The historic streetcars of the F-line fleet | publisher = Market Street Railway | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line is principally operated by a mixture of the PCC and Peter Witt cars, although other more unusual or historic cars are often in service (including the 913 and 952, iconic streetcars named [[Desire Street|Desire]]). Although the modern Muni LRVs are not compatible with F-line service because the overhead line is not compatible with [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]] operation, [[US Standard Light Rail Vehicle|Boeing LRVs]] have operated down parts of Market Street one or more times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rides.webshots.com/photo/1391076612073654120xSjWvi MUNI LRVs--1258 @ Market/Duboce]&lt;/ref&gt;

===PCC fleet===
[[File:Three PCCs on Jefferson Street, October 2017.jpg|thumb|left|Three streetcars - original Muni #1010, ex-Newark #1073, and ex-SEPTA #1059 - on Jefferson Street]]

A fleet of [[PCC streetcar]]s from San Francisco, [[SEPTA|Philadelphia]], and [[Newark City Subway|Newark]], built between 1946 and 1948, operate on the line. {{asof|August 2007}}, MUNI was operating 27 of these cars, restored to various states of service. Among the restored cars in service, three are original San Francisco double-ended PCC cars. Another 16 cars are single-ended cars acquired from [[SEPTA]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] in 1992 (which continues to operate another 18 cars today, retrofitted for ADA compliance), while the remaining 11 cars are single-ended cars acquired from [[New Jersey Transit]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="fleetpcc"/&gt;

MUNI has another 30 unrestored PCC cars in long-term storage.&lt;ref name="fleetpcc"&gt;{{cite web | title = The PCC: A streetcar named success | url = http://www.streetcar.org/mim/streetcars/fleet/pcc/index.html | publisher = Market Street Railway | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unrestored cars include five additional San Francisco double-ended cars, 10 San Francisco single-ended cars, 12 single-ended cars acquired from St. Louis in 1957, two single-ended cars from Philadelphia, and two single-ended cars from [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]. A further previously restored car from Philadelphia was written off after a traffic accident in 2003.&lt;ref name="fleetlist"&gt;{{cite web | title = F-line fleet operational status | url = http://www.streetcar.org/mim/streetcars/status/index.html | publisher = Market Street Railway | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the restored cars are painted in the color schemes of prominent past and present PCC streetcar operators, including Muni itself and other transit systems.&lt;ref name="fleetpcc"/&gt;

===Peter Witt fleet===
[[File:AFreshlyPaintedMilanPeterWittTramInTwoToneGreenOnItsThirdWeekOfServiceOnTheFLine.jpg|thumb|right|Former [[ATM Class 1500|Milan Peter Witt]] car carrying the two-tone green color scheme used by Milan in the 1930s.]]
Muni operates a fleet of [[Peter Witt streetcar]]s on the line, acquired from [[Milan]], Italy. There are 11 of these cars, all built in 1928 to an Italian derivative of a common streetcar design that operated in many US cities, although never previously in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="fleetmil"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Milan 'Peter Witt' trams | url = http://www.streetcar.org/mim/streetcars/fleet/milan/index.html | publisher = Market Street Railway | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of San Francisco's Peter Witt cars are currently painted in the overall orange color scheme that they carried in Milan, although one has been repainted into its original livery of yellow and white with black trim, while another is in the two-tone green livery that the cars carried from the 1930s to the 1970s.&lt;ref name="fleetmil"/&gt;

===San Francisco vintage fleet===
[[File:San Francisco 130 at foot of Market.jpg|thumb|left|Veteran San Francisco streetcar 130 was built for Muni in 1914, and operates in the livery it carried in 1939.]]
The F-Line fleet also includes a fleet of pre-PCC vintage cars built between 1895 and 1924 for use in San Francisco. Three passenger cars were built for Muni itself, and a further two for the independent [[Market Street Railway Company]] that ran competing streetcar services in San Francisco until acquired by Muni in 1944. The final car is a works flat car, built for Muni in 1916 and used for hauling rails, ties, and other materials needed to maintain a streetcar system.&lt;ref name="fleetvin"&gt;{{cite web | title = Muni's incomparable antique streetcars | url = http://www.streetcar.org/mim/streetcars/fleet/antique/index.html | publisher = Market Street Railway | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cars carry a variety of former San Francisco streetcar color schemes.&lt;ref name="fleetvin"/&gt;

===Worldwide fleet===
[[File:233 boat tram! -muniheritage (21734580135).jpg|thumb|right|"Boat car" #233 from Blackpool]]
The Muni's international fleet on the F-Line includes a diverse collection of 10 cars from various operators worldwide:&lt;ref name="fleetvin"/&gt;
* [[Blackpool tramway]], in [[Blackpool]], [[England]] (including two distinctive open-air [[Blackpool tramway#Boat cars|boat cars]])
* The former [[Trams in Hamburg|Hamburg tram system]], in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]
* [[Hankai Tramway]], in [[Osaka]], [[Japan]]
* [[Kobe Municipal Transportation Bureau]] &amp; [[Hiroshima Electric Railway]], in [[Kobe]] &amp; [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]]
* [[Trams in Melbourne|Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board]], in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]
* [[Trams in Moscow|Moscow tram system]], in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] ({{Track gauge|5ft|lk=on|disp=or}} system)
* [[Trams in Porto|Porto tram system]], in [[Porto]], [[Portugal]]
* [[Brussels trams|STIB/MIVB]], in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]].

All the cars carry the color schemes of their original operators, except for the Brussels car, which currently carries a color scheme paying tribute to San Francisco's twin city of [[Zürich]] in [[Switzerland]] (the streetcars actually in use in Zürich use meter-gauge and therefore cannot be moved to San Francisco). The Moscow trams had to be equipped with {{Track gauge|4ft8.5in}} [[Bogie|trucks]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Fort Mason==
[[File:West portal of Fort Mason Tunnel, June 2017.JPG|thumb|The abandoned railway tunnel under Fort Mason would be part of a planned extension]]
Muni completed a technical feasibility study to extend the F-Line from the vicinity of the existing Jones Street terminal with the assistance of the National Park Service in December 2004. The extended line would extend westward alongside the [[San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park|San Francisco Maritime Museum and Aquatic Park]] and then through the historic (1914) but disused single-track [[Fort Mason Tunnel]], formerly owned by the [[San Francisco Belt Railroad|State Belt Railroad]].

An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the extension, again led by the National Park Service, commenced in May 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/goga/learn/management/extension-of-f-line-streetcar-service-to-fort-mason-center.htm |title=Extension of F-Line Streetcar Service to Fort Mason Center |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=15 March 2013 |website=National Park Service |accessdate=30 June 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307191008/http://www.nps.gov/goga/learn/management/extension-of-f-line-streetcar-service-to-fort-mason-center.htm |archivedate=7 March 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in:

The final document classified areas west of the Fort Mason Tunnel as having "inadequate regional transit access...limited transportation options for transit-dependent residents...[and] infrastructure constraints impacting effectiveness and operations of Fort Mason Center." The Final EIS named a double-tracked extension along Beach Street, a jog north to Aquatic Park, then across Van Ness Avenue to single-tracked service through a retrofitted Fort Mason Tunnel and to a terminus in the Fort Mason Center parking lot as the "preferred alternative".&lt;ref name=FEIS/&gt;

The '''frost line''' is a term used in [[plastic]] [[film]] manufacturing by [[extrusion]]. It refers to the point beyond the [[die (manufacturing)|die]] where the temperature of the molten plastic falls below the softening point and the diameter of the extruded plastic bubble stabilizes. The term was borrowed from the notion of "[[frost line]]" in [[soil science]] and refers to the frosted appearance of the plastic film above the "frost line".

The distance from the die is called the height of the frost line. It depends on various factors, including the melt temperature, the speed of cooling, the extrusion speed, and the diameter of the bubble. The notion is important, since the higher the frost line, the more difficult to control the uniformity of the film thickness.

For example, a higher frost line due to higher melt temperature and/or lower cooling rate means a longer time to solidify, and a more smooth and transparent film is produced.

The '''General Electric Building''', also known as '''570 Lexington Avenue''', is a historic 50-floor, {{Convert|640|ft|m||adj=on}}-tall, skyscraper in [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]], at the southwest corner of Lexington Avenue and [[51st Street (Manhattan)|51st Street]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=570 Lexington Avenue |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=570lexingtonavenuenue-newyorkcity-ny-usa |publisher=Emporis.com |accessdate=2008-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally known as the '''RCA Victor Building''' when designed in 1931 by John W. Cross of [[Cross &amp; Cross]], it is sometimes known by its address to avoid confusion with the much later renaming &amp;ndash; in 1988 &amp;ndash; of the RCA Building at [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]] as the "GE Building", itself later renamed the "Comcast Building".

The building was designated a [[New York City landmark]] in 1985,&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.119&lt;/ref&gt; and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on January 28, 2004.&lt;ref name="nris" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://architecturaltrust.org/~architec/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2010_0617_respondent_motion_partial_summary_judgment.pdf|title=Tower 570 Company, L.P., Broadwell Investing Corp., Tax Matters Partner v.

==History==
At the time that [[RCA Victor]] commissioned this building, it was a subsidiary of [[General Electric]]. The company then moved its headquarters to Rockefeller Center, and this building was deeded over to the parent company.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt; The building was donated to [[Columbia University]] in 1993 to gain a $40 million tax deduction.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/03/nyregion/ge-gives-midtown-tower-to-columbia-university.html|title=G.E. Gives Midtown Tower To Columbia University|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|date=June 3, 1993|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 6, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university formed a joint venture with Mendik Company and Quantum Realty Partners and refurbished the building in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/15/realestate/streetscapes-570-lexington-avenue-columbia-s-restoring-an-art-deco-masterpiece.html|title=Streetscapes/570 Lexington Avenue; Columbia's Restoring an Art Deco Masterpiece|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=January 15, 1995|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 6, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendik bought out Columbia in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wikicu.com/General_Electric_Building|title=General Electric Building - WikiCU, the Columbia University wiki encyclopedia|website=www.wikicu.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tower 570 Company, LP, an affiliate of the Feil Organization, is the buildings current owner.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://therealdeal.com/new-research/topics/property/570-lexington-avenue/|title=570 Lexington Avenue|work=The Real Deal New York|access-date=2017-11-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The building's 50-floor stylized [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] octagonal brick tower, with elaborate [[Art Deco]] decorations of lightning bolts showing the power of electricity, grows out of the round-cornered base with elaborate masonry and architectural figural sculpture, to form "one of the most expressive skyscrapers of its era."&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt; The building was designed to blend with the low Byzantine dome of [[St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church, New York|St. Bartholomew's Church]] on [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]] and shares the same brick color, with [[terra cotta]] decorations chosen to coordinate. The crown of the building is an example of Gothic [[tracery]], which is intended to represent electricity and radio waves, and is lit from within at night. On the corner above the building's main entrance is a clock with the cursive GE logo and a pair of disembodied silver arms holding bolts of electricity.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;

The ''[[AIA Guide to New York City]]'' says that the building's "Art Deco details at both street and sky are both sumptuous and exuberant."&lt;ref name=aia&gt;{{cite aia5}}, p.318&lt;/ref&gt; A "major example" of Art Deco architecture, the style is "both symbolic and expressive of the building's function," according to the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]].&lt;ref name=desrep&gt;Savage, Charles C. (July 9, 1985) [http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1412.pdf "General Electric Building Designation Report"] [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the building was donated to Columbia University, it was extensively renovated by Ernest de Castro of the WCA Design Group.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;

==In popular culture==
*When General Electric was in the process of purchasing RCA, [[David Letterman]], then host of NBC's [[Late Night with David Letterman]], brought a camera crew and a fruit basket to the building in an attempt to welcome their new corporate parents. They were greeted at the lobby by a GE official who demanded they stop filming and leave the premises, before placing his hand over the camera lens.
*The General Electric Building was featured in the 2005 film ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]'' as the location of the head office of Jane Doe ([[Angelina Jolie]]).
*In the [[Netflix]] TV series ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'' set in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel cinematic universe]], the character  Harold Meachum lives in the penthouse of the General Electric Building. The series shows views of the lobby and exterior.

'''Gábor Kovács''' (born 2 January 1957 in [[Orosháza]]) is a [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] financier, banker, art collector, philanthropist and founder of [[KOGART]].

== Life and career ==
Having studied at the Moscow State Institution for International Relations ([[MGIMO]]) between 1975 and 1980, he started his career at the [[Hungarian National Bank]]. He was the first managing director of Citibank Budapest from 1985, before becoming the vice-president of Citibank London. Back in Hungary by 1991, he founded Bankár Holding Plc., which he now heads as president and CEO. It was at this time that he began to collect works by, as well as to support, Hungarian artists. His collection spans the history of Hungarian painting from the early 18th to the mid-20th century.

On 8 November 2003, he established the Gábor Kovács Art Foundation with a HUF 3 bn capital stock, and opened KOGART House on 20 April 2004.

He has been a member of the Trilateral Commission since 2006.

Following its full-scale renovation, he reopened, with a new function, the Pauline-Carmelite Monastery of Sopronbánfalva in 2010, which was managed and owned by him till 2015 &lt;ref name="A Monastery on the Frontier" /&gt;

Above all, he is interested in finding answers for the new social and economic challenges of the 21st century.

=== ''Beauty—Harmony—Equilibrium'' ===
{{Quotation|align=center|"I learnt my sensitivity to beauty from my mother. As a child, I was already intrigued by man and landscape: beauty and harmony, the sense of space and the horizon, the meeting of the sky and the earth. Of course, I had no idea of such abstract notions in Kakasszék. All I knew was that people there were sincere and earned their living with hard work. Beauty is of course subjective. A face, a tree, a train arriving at the Kakasszék station, a lake nearby were beautiful. The larks starting to sing in spring and the return of the swallows showed the harmony of life. The birds gathering in autumn before migration hinted at transitoriness. Kakasszék is the past. It has changed. It has lost its character. Most of the elderly have left for other beauties. My mother moved closer to me. The feelings, however, are the same. This emotional world echoes in my collection, in this book.

In my early youth I was not too receptive to art. I was over thirty when it touched me. Since then I have been its captive. In 1991, for the empty walls of my new office I bought eight pictures, only Hungarian ones. The first sampling proved successful. Works by [[István Csók]], Gusztáv Magyar Mannheimer and Márk Rubovics are still noted items in my collection. Collecting became a passion and stole into my everyday life. My scope of interest kept stretching toward 19th-century classicist, romantic landscapes, then early 19th-century portraits, and I got to Nagybánya as well. The legacy of [[Ádám Mányoki]] and János Kupeczky is also part of the Hungarian atmosphere. The [[Hungarian National Gallery]] wanted Ferenc Rákóczi II to re-marry Charlotte Amelie, princess of Hessen. With my help, they managed to do so—for the duration of the Ádám Mányoki exhibition.

Lajos Gulácsy and [[Tivadar Kosztka Csontváry|Tivadar Csontváry Kosztka]] found me, too! By some miracle, masterpieces find me.

The encounter with the paintings of [[Károly Markó the Elder]] had an elementary impact on me. I was wholly overcome by the passion for Markó. György Károlyi commissioned Károly Markó the Elder to paint a picture in 1836. It was Women by the Well (Serpent Killer). The picture was owned by the Károlyi family during the past 150 years and it came into my possession by the courtesy of the heirs of Katinka Andrássy. It was an incredible accident again that I came across another latent chef d'œuvre known only in verbal description: St. Paul Shipwrecked on Malta. One Markó picture attracted the next. I bought the sixteenth item of my Markó collection at a Sotheby's auction in London in the summer of 2003. Another masterpiece—the painting had never been seen in Hungary. It was purchased by a Spanish infante after Markó's death in Italy, in the 1860s. I take greatest pride in this segment of my collection: the romantic landscapes, the Markós, Ligetis, Telepys. I probably owe it to this encounter that now I have not only some three hundred pictures but also a collection spunning from the early 18th century to 1935 expressing more or less the same sensitivity.

When it comes to the second half of the 20th century, however, I am at a loss. It was just a few years ago that I began to open up to this period. The works of art grow in number—[[Jenő Barcsay]], Menyhért Tóth, [[Endre Bálint]] and the lifework of János Bozsó, just to mention a few names. This material has not matured into a coherent whole yet. That will be my collector's task for the next ten years. The organizing principles are binding: sincerity, beauty, harmony... Works of art that are close to me, that touch me.

The past thirteen years of my life was about business in the first place and collecting art was only secondary. Giving up my post in London, I went into entrepreneurship. I wanted to show my expertise in my country. There were many transactions, many successes, my fortune increased. I kept rushing on, to new challenges, to new transactions. I did not realize the enormous difference between wealth and eternal values. I thought I would succeed in achieving everything. I was wrong.

After three years of bitter struggle, one day in 2002 I caught sight of Zsuzsa Péreli's latest work, Aequilibrium, on the wall of the Gobelin Museum in Aubusson. I immediately knew where I had made a mistake. It took just a nick of time to realize that the missing element in my successful but lopsided life was equilibrium. I had to create harmony not only in my environment, among the Markós, but also in my own soul. I realised that genuine equilibrium was not horizontal but between spiritual goals and earthly values. Between "Heaven" and "Earth". Earthly goals in heavenly perspectives. From the horizon of Kakasszék through the beauty of Markó's landscape I arrived at Péreli's search for equilibrium. I wish that everyone will cover this road in their hearts.

These experiences gave impetus to the idea of the [[Gábor Kovács Art Foundation]]. The 21st century is the century of foundations. Foundation is the future. The art works being created now will enrich the collection of the Gábor Kovács Art Foundation. We would like to build a collection characterized by beauty, harmony, a search for equilibrium, by inspired sincerity representing high spiritual goals and eternal values hidden in external beauty. I am sure that in the next one hundred years we will find the artists who "come in touch with God" as Csontváry says in his diary. After sixty years of solitude, our art will be part of European art again. And to the joy of us all, a collection will be created involving real values which have a message for us all."|Gábor Kovács, 2004&lt;ref name="The Gábor Kovács Collection" /&gt;}}

'''Harry Atmore''' (14 December 1870 &amp;ndash; 20 August 1946) was a New Zealand [[Independent politician|Independent]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Nelson (New Zealand electorate)|Nelson]] in the [[South Island]].

Harry Atmore held the Nelson seat as an Independent for a total of thirty years from 1911 to 1914 and then from 1919 to his death in 1946. He was [[Minister of Education (New Zealand)|Minister of Education]] and Minister in charge of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) in Sir [[Joseph Ward]]'s [[United Government of New Zealand|United]] Government of 1928 to 1931, and the acting [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]] for approximately five months between 25 August 1930 and 21 January 1931.

==Early years==
Born in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], in 1870, Atmore attended the Nelson Public School and represented the province in [[Rugby union|rugby]].&lt;ref name= "Atmore DNZB"&gt;{{DNZB|Tunnicliff|Shirley |4a23|Atmore, Harry|3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later moved to [[Wellington]] and spent eight years there as an apprentice signwriter and decorator. After his apprenticeship, Atmore returned to Nelson and established his own signwriting and decorating business.

Atmore was prominent in local affairs. He was a member of the Nelson Licensing Committee, Education Board and Hospital Board. In 1905, he was elected to the [[Nelson City Council]].&lt;ref name= "Atmore DNZB"/&gt; Later, he served on the [[Nelson College]] Council of Governors and [[Cawthron Institute]] Trust Board.

Atmore unsuccessfully contested the Nelson seat in 1902, 1905 and 1908 against the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal]] [[John Graham (New Zealand politician)|John Graham]]. In 1911 he became Nelson's Member of Parliament. Atmore gave his support in [[Joseph Ward]]'s Liberal government by voting for it on a no-confidence motion, which was saved by just one vote. Whilst remaining an independent, he normally supported the Liberals from then on. Regardless, Atmore's political independence was always discernible. He believed that politicians should be, first and foremost, representatives of the people. That when elected they should put principle before party.&lt;ref name= "Atmore DNZB"/&gt;

Atmore lost his seat in the 1914 election, but returned to parliament in 1919 after unsuccessfully contesting the Wellington Central {{By-election link|Wellington Central|1918}} which was won by [[Peter Fraser (New Zealand politician)|Peter Fraser]], the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] candidate.&lt;ref name="Victory for Labour"&gt;{{cite news|title=A victory for Labour |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19181004.2.11.1 |work=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] |volume=XCVI |issue=83 |date=4 October 1918 |page=3 |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Atmore was opposed to the rising Labour Party and was doubtful of its socialist agenda. He was also an admirer of [[Benito Mussolini]] due to his opposition to socialist radicals in Italy. As a result, Labour put considerable effort in to defeat him in 1925. Gradually Atmore's animosity towards Labour lessened and Labour did not stand a candidate against him after that.&lt;ref name= "Atmore DNZB"/&gt;

Following the 1928 election he supported Ward's new United Party form a majority and was rewarded with a position in cabinet, as [[Minister of Education (New Zealand)|Minister of Education]]. As a largely self-educated man, he had passionate concern for education and took to his new responsibilities with vigor. Atmore's first goal as education minister was to ensure every child in New Zealand could have the opportunity to gain a proper education to realise their own potential. He formed a committee to examine the existing public education system. The outcome was the "[[The Atmore Report, 1930|Atmore Report]]" which recommended several radical reforms including raising the age to leave school to 15, establishing intermediate schools, abolishing scholarship entry to secondary school, and widening the secondary school curriculum to also cover non University approved subjects.&lt;ref name= "Atmore DNZB"/&gt;
[[File:United Cabinet, 1928.jpg|thumb|250px|Atmore (seated first on left) in the United cabinet, 1928.]]
Atmore resigned as education minister in 1931 when cuts were proposed for his portfolio due to the worsening depression and formation of the [[United–Reform coalition Government of New Zealand|coalition government]] which he was opposed to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |last=Courtney |first=S D |year=n.d. |title=Harry Atmore: Independent in Politics |publisher=[[University of Canterbury]] |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of his ideas were later implemented under the [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|First Labour Government]] where Peter Fraser (who was a member of Atmore's Committee) was minister of education. Fraser's Education Amendment Act 1938 was to endorse and implement most of Atmore's recommendations.&lt;ref name= "Atmore DNZB"/&gt;

Atmore read and thought widely. He was one New Zealander who was looking for solutions to problems within the altered economic, social and political context of inter-war New Zealand. He believed it was important to be informed on the issues of the day including monetary reform, international rearmament and the pivotal role of the [[USSR]] in any crisis. Curiously, he was a [[social credit]] monetary reform sponsor and campaigned for it vigorously, blaming many of New Zealand's debt problems in the early 1930s on obligations to pay interest on its debts in London.&lt;ref name= "Atmore DNZB"/&gt;

On 8 August 1946 Atmore announced his intention not to stand again at the next election. However, only two weeks later, on 20 August, he was found dead at his home. He was buried at [[Wakapuaka Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://information.ncc.govt.nz/cgi-bin/cemetery/ceppncc?key=WKNG19075 |title=Cemeteries database |date= |website= |publisher=Nelson City Council |accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Atmore was a well known man in Nelson, refusing to drive a car, instead preferring to ride a bicycle everywhere locally which made him a visible addition to the community. He personally answered all messages and requests in his own handwriting as an indication of his dedication to his work.&lt;ref name= "Atmore DNZB"/&gt;

Atmore married Dorothy Annie Corrigan on 24 June 1936, at the age of 65, at Hawera. There were no children from the marriage. Dorothy was both wealthy and well-educated. The two built a new home named Te Maunga and made it a local centre of hospitality. Throughout [[World War II]] the two were both actively involved in patriotic work, which was to earn Dorothy an MBE. Dorothy lived a further thirty years as a widow, dying in 1976.&lt;ref name= "Atmore DNZB"/&gt;

Atmore's grip on the Nelson seat was due primarily to his commitment and availability to his constituents. He organised a call to repair a country school, the completion of the Nelson railway, an exemption for an only son of an elderly farming couple from military service and helped issue jobs in the public service to the unemployed. For an entire generation Atmore worked for all Nelson residents with such a commitment that his constituents regarded him to be a personal friend.&lt;ref name= "Atmore DNZB"/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Harry Atmore.jpg|thumb|Atmore, late 1920's.]]
In 1935, he was awarded the [[King George V Silver Jubilee Medal]].&lt;ref name="EP"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19350506.2.12 | title=Official jubilee medals | date=6 May 1935 |volume=CXIX |issue=105 |newspaper=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] | accessdate=2 July 2013 | page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Chapman comments on Harry Atmore:&lt;ref&gt;''New Zealand Politics in Action: The 1960 General Election'' by R M Chapman, W K Jackson and A V Mitchell p213 (1962, Oxford University Press, London)&lt;/ref&gt; 
:Nelson even shares with [[Hobson (NZ electorate)|Hobson]] a record of preferring political idiosyncrancy. Nine times out of ten between 1911 and 1946 Nelson voted for Harry Atmore, who confounded cynics by moving to the Left politically as he got older. Having begun as an [[Independent Liberal]], he thereafter passed through many shades of independence to finish as his own variety of consistently pro-Labour MP.

Historians have regarded Atmore as the last example of an earlier, simpler political age, before the rise of the party system. He embodied the aspirations of small town residents and their desires for a fairer and more egalitarian society.&lt;ref name= "Atmore DNZB"/&gt;

==Early life==
Mutlaq was born in [[Saudi Arabia]]. Following her father's death when she was six years old, she was raised by her mother.

'''[[Netflix]]''' is a [[video on demand]] service which has expanded its business internationally from 2010 onwards.

== 2010: Canada ==
The company began offering streaming service to the international market on September 22, 2010 to Canada. At the time, Canadians could subscribe to Netflix for $7.99 a month, a rate that CEO Hastings called, "the lowest, most aggressive price we've ever had anywhere in the world."&lt;ref name="Canada Stumble"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Star Staff|last2=Canadian Press|title=Netflix stumbles as it launches in Canada|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2010/09/22/netflix_stumbles_as_it_launches_in_canada.html|website=Toronto Star|publisher=Toronto Star|accessdate=December 3, 2014|date=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the proclaimed low price, content selection in Canada was extremely limited. In 2012, data conducted by Josh Loewen for Canadian Business Online found that in the United States there were 10,625 unique titles in Netflix's library, whereas in Canada there were only 2,647.&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://netflix.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=363|title=Netflix To Launch Canadian Service|work=Netflix|date=July 19, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722042104/http://netflix.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=363|archivedate=July 22, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This could be blamed on differences in distribution deals in the United States and Canada. It is important to point out that from its beginning, Canadian Netflix has offered content not available in the United States. For example, a short-lived Fox sitcom, ''Running Wilde'' starring [[Keri Russell]] and [[Will Arnett]], began streaming on Canadian Netflix the same day it began airing in the United States on network television. The show streamed on Canadian Netflix because there was no Canadian broadcast partner, but was not available on US Netflix – becoming deemed a "Canada-only exclusive".&lt;ref name="Canada Ssepttumble"/&gt; Still, regardless of a limited streaming selection, it took the company less than a year to reach one million subscribers,&lt;ref name="Canada Million"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vlessing|first1=Etan|title=Netflix Canada Signs Up One Millionth Subscriber|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/netflix-canada-signs-up-one-219508|website=Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately three percent of Canada's population. Further, as of February 2014, there were approximately 5.8 million Canadians using Netflix, or 29% of Canada's English-speaking population. This number represents an increase in Canadian users by approximately 40% since 2012.&lt;ref name="canada 29"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oliveira|first1=Michael|title=Report finds 29 per cent of English-speaking Canadian subscribe to Netflix|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/tech_news/2014/02/04/report_finds_29_per_cent_of_englishspeaking_canadians_subscribe_to_netflix.html|website=Toronto Star|publisher=Toronto Star|accessdate=December 3, 2014|date=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2011: Latin America, Central America and Caribbean ==
On July 5, 2011, Netflix announced its plans to launch streaming service in Latin America,&lt;ref name="LA Expansion"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pepitone|first1=Julianne|title=Netflix expands to 43 new countries|url=http://money.cnn.com/2011/07/05/technology/netflix_international/|website=CNN Money|publisher=CNN Money|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; its largest expansion to date. At the time, Netflix had 23 million subscribers in the US and Canada.&lt;ref name="LA Expansion Stock"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cabot Investing Advice|title=Netflix Surges on Latin America Expansion News|url=http://www.cabot.net/News/2011/07/Netflix.aspx|website=Cabot Investing Advice|publisher=Cabot Investing Advice|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Entering the Latin American market meant Netflix had access to approximately 600 million people, or twice the number of people living in the United States.&lt;ref name="Why LA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lawler|first1=Ryan|title=Why Latin America is Netflix's next big market|url=https://gigaom.com/2011/07/05/netflix-latin-america-expansion/|website=Gigamon|publisher=Gigamon|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although high speed internet in Latin America is not as accessible as it in the United States and Canada, upon the announcement of its expansion to Latin America, Netflix stock immediately surged 8%, bringing the company to a record share price of $291.&lt;ref name="LA Expansion Stock" /&gt;

Beginning in September 2011, the company began its expansion to 43 countries and territories in Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean, offering content in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Brazil became the first country in Latin America to launch the service on September 5. There the service was offered at $BR14.99 or approximately $9.10 per month, making it more expensive than in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="LA Rollout"&gt;{{cite web|last1=hdreport|title=Netflix begins Latin America rollout|url=http://hd-report.com/2011/09/06/netflix-begins-latin-america-rollout/|website=hdreport|publisher=hdreport|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=September 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rounding out the first five countries to launch streaming service in Latin America were Argentina, which followed on the 7th, Chile on the 8th, Colombia on the 9th, and Mexico on the 12th. Service spread to the other 38 countries in the following weeks. Among the content distributed to Latin America was programming from CBS, Miramax, and Showtime.

The launch in Latin America was not as successful as the company had hoped. While in Latin America, Netflix had no streaming competitors as it did in Canada, the digital divide (a lack of high broadband internet penetration) hindered rapid growth.&lt;ref name="Netflix LA Problems"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fritz|first1=Ben|title=Netflix faces problems in Latin America|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/16/entertainment/la-et-ct-netflix-latin-america20120516|website=LA Times|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Brazil, for example, only 20% of the population had an internet speed greater than {{nowrap|500 kB/s a second}}; {{nowrap|800 kB/s}} a second are needed to stream Netflix's content.&lt;ref name="LA Fox Deal"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frankel|first1=Daniel|title=Netflix continues Latin American content push with Fox deal|url=https://gigaom.com/2012/05/09/netflix-continues-latin-american-content-push-with-fox-deal/|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the lack of competitors in some ways slowed growth as well. Whereas in Canada new subscribers had been exposed to streaming content by other companies, the concept was newer to a wide Latin American audience, making some skeptical of the prospect.&lt;ref name="Netflix LA Problems" /&gt; A banking system unused to recurrent monthly transactions exacerbated the problem. Still, while Latin American expansion happened more slowly than expected, Netflix didn't lose money for the expansion and their Canadian expansion happened at a faster rate than expected, making their first two forays into the international market fairly successful. Additionally, despite the hindrances to growth in Latin America, Netflix continued in pursuit of content expansion, signing a deal with Fox in May 2012 (for a July 15 start) to make its popular content (e.g., ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''Glee, Bones, The X-Files, Wall Street'') available in the region.&lt;ref name="LA Fox Deal" /&gt;

== The 2011 controversy ==
The initial launches in Canada and in Latin America happened (albeit barely) before Netflix's 2011 controversy in the United States. In September of that year, the company decided to switch to two separate plans (one for streaming and one for DVD), hiked its prices accordingly, and attempted a move to two websites (one for streaming and one for DVD rentals). The change to its business model was accompanied by a loss of approximately one million American users and a plunging stock price. Prior to announcing the change to service stock was valued at just around $300, after the price it plunged to less than $53 a share.&lt;ref name="50 Mil"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steel|first1=Emily|title=Netflix, Growing, Envisions Expansion Abroad|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/22/business/media/netflix-says-it-topped-50-million-subscribers.html?_r=0|website=NY Times|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this debacle, Netflix had been having its most successful quarter, mainly due to the decision to expand to Latin America. The company quickly lost all the money it made in the quarter it announced growth to Latin America, was forced to apologize, and rethink its changing model.&lt;ref name="50 Mil" /&gt;

Bringing people back to Netflix after the 2011 snafu came in two forms.&lt;ref name="50 Mil" /&gt; First, it began work on producing its own original content –  announcing its adaptation of House of Cards in 2011 for a 2013 air date and its revival of Arrested Development in 2012 for a 2013 air date. Second, it continued international expansion – the originals were able to travel alongside its international expansion since Netflix, for the most part, retained complete control of their shows' distribution rights.

== 2012: United Kingdom, Ireland and Scandinavia ==
Netflix started its expansion to Europe in 2012, launching in the United Kingdom and Ireland on January 4.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news| title = Netflix launches UK film and TV streaming service| date = January 9, 2012| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16467432| accessdate = January 9, 2012|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October 18 it had expanded to Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.&lt;ref name="prnewswire.com"&gt;{{cite press release| title = Netflix Launches In Sweden, Denmark, Norway And Finland| date = October 18, 2012| url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/netflix-launches-in-sweden-denmark-norway-and-finland-174749581.html| accessdate = November 14, 2014|work=PRNewswire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Christof Baron, CEO of the international marketing group Mindshare, Netflix developed a strategy for its international expansion, "They start with a limited offer which doesn't cost them very much money and minimizes the risk. Then they collect very detailed data about what people like, and structure programming and investment around consumer behavior."&lt;ref name="Advertising Age"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Emma|title=Netflix Braves Cultural Barriers for European Expansion|url=http://adage.com/article/global-news/netflix-braves-cultural-barriers-european-expansion/295035/|website=Advertising Age|publisher=Advertising Age|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=September 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accounts for cultural taste differences and allows distribution deals to develop accordingly. By September 2013, Netflix had added token minimal content from [[Channel 4]], [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and the [[BBC]], many of which are early series, with subsequents never made available on Netflix.&lt;ref name="C4Wauto-8089252"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slinkystudio.info/reviews/2013/9/10/netflix-uk-review.html |title=Netflix UK Review |work=slinkystudio.info |date=September 10, 2013 |accessdate=March 8, 2014 |author= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308220718/http://www.slinkystudio.info/reviews/2013/9/10/netflix-uk-review.html |archivedate=March 8, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Netflix UK and Ireland reached its millionth subscriber faster than Netflix Canada, nabbing its millionth member by July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Elaine|title=Netflix celebrates one year in Ireland, gets set for a more original 2013|url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/new-media/item/30974-netflix-celebrates-one-year|website=Silicon Republic|publisher=Silicon Republic|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, BARB (Broadcasters Audience Research Board) reported Netflix as being extremely successful in the UK market. More than one in ten households in the country subscribed to the service by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Joe|title=Netflix Friend or Foe|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/329|website=Barb|publisher=Barb|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than twice as many people subscribed to Netflix than to Amazon Prime. As of the fall of 2014, Netflix had three million UK subscribers which was more twice as many as it had in 2013.&lt;ref name="Advertising Age" /&gt; Netflix is estimated to have over 300,000 subscribers in Ireland as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/media-and-marketing/jeremy-clarkson-puts-online-tv-race-into-top-gear-1.2876786|title=Jeremy Clarkson puts online TV race into top gear|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2013: Netherlands ==
Following the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, the next country in Europe to receive Netflix service was The Netherlands, on September 11, 2013. The Netherlands was the only country that Netflix expanded to in 2013, though, as the company decided to slow expansion to control subscription costs.&lt;ref name="6 March 2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallenstein|first1=Andrew|title=Netflix 2014 European Expansion: A Look Ahead|url=https://variety.com/2014/digital/news/netflix-makes-plans-to-move-into-europe-but-it-faces-fights-from-local-competitors-1201125910/|website=Variety|publisher=Variety|accessdate=December 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company spent $3 billion on subscription content that year.&lt;ref name="6 March 2014" /&gt; Kelly Merryman, the company's Vice President of Content Acquisition, revealed that shows that performed well on [[BitTorrent]] networks and other pirate sites were more likely to be offered as part of the expansion. Netflix's CEO further explained that illegal downloading helps to create demand, as users may switch to legal services for an improved user experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix makes it official, launches in The Netherlands|url=http://gigaom.com/2013/09/10/netflix-netherlands-launch/|work=GigaOM|publisher=GigaOM|accessdate=September 16, 2013|author=Janko Roettgers|date=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix Uses Pirate Sites to Determine What Shows to Buy|url=http://torrentfreak.com/netflix-uses-pirate-sites-to-determine-what-shows-to-buy-130914/|work=TorrentFreak|publisher=TorrentFreak|accessdate=September 16, 2013|author=ernesto|date=September 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final quarter of 2013, Netflix gained more new subscribers from its pool of countries than it did from the United States for the first time since it began its European expansion, making international expansion increasingly important. As media analyst Anthony Wible has been quoted as saying, "There are only so many people in the United States. The rest of the world is far bigger and the addition of domestic subscribers will start to slow down at some point."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hamel|first1=Mathilde|title=Netflix bets on international expansion to keep going|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101487231|website=CNBC|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2013, the company had reached approximately 32 million users in the United States and had additionally had approximately 10 million users internationally.&lt;ref name="Advertising Age" /&gt;

== 2014: Further European and ''India'' expansion ==
By September 19, 2014, the service was also available in [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Switzerland]]&lt;ref name="Netflix Media Centre"&gt;{{cite press release| title = Netflix now in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg | date = September 18, 2014| url = https://pr.netflix.com/WebClient/getNewsSummary.do?newsId=1593| accessdate = November 14, 2014|work=Netflix Media Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[India]].While reception throughout the rest of Europe and India was relatively warm, it was fairly hostile in France because of fears that the launch of Netflix would begin to ruin the country's "[[cultural exception]]" – its focus on culturally specific media. This led to Netflix's decision to create a series called ''Marseille'', essentially a remake of its hit series ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'' within a French context and one of the company's first non-English language shows.&lt;ref name="Advertising Age" /&gt;

Prior to its international expansion in 2010, Netflix's subscriber base grew on average by 2.4 million people a year. Following its arrival in Canada, Latin America, and eventually Europe, its subscriber base has grown on average by 7 million people a year,&lt;ref name=Expansion&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Dave|title=Chart of the Day: Netflix's Brilliant Expansion Plan|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-netflix-gets-a-huge-boost-from-international-expansion-2014-9|website=Business Insider|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=December 1, 2014|date=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; making international expansion key to Netflix's continued growth in the global marketplace. Notably, the company has over 20 original shows planned for release in 2015 and 2016. In that bunch are Netflix's first non-English language series.

In 2013, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine estimated that international streaming accounted for 15% of the company's value.

== 2015–16: Further expansion into Asia, CES announcement ==
On September 9, 2015, Netflix announced that it would be continuing its expansion into Asia by launching in Pakistan, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan in early 2016, and the Philippines and Southeast Asia in the near future.&lt;ref name="asia2016"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-to-launch-in-south-korea-singapore-hong-kong-and-taiwan-in-early-2016-1|title=Netflix To Launch In South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong And Taiwan In Early 2016 | date=2015-09-09 | accessdate=2015-09-09|publisher=Netflix|website=netflix.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 6, 2016 at [[Consumer Electronics Show]], Netflix announced a major international expansion into 130 new territories; with this expansion, the company promoted that its service would now be available nearly "worldwide", with the only notable exclusions including Mainland China, and regions subject to U.S. sanctions, such as [[Crimea]], [[Syria]], and [[North Korea]]. The company also announced a partnership with [[LG]] to market pre-paid services in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.&lt;ref name=vb-130new&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix launches in 130 new countries, including India and Russia|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/01/06/netflix-launches-in-130-new-countries/|website=VentureBeat|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=engadget-nearlyevery&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix Everywhere: Live in nearly every country except China|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/01/06/netflix-teams-with-lg-for-prepaid-streaming-worldwide/|website=Engadget|publisher=AOL|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-netflixeverywhere&gt;{{cite news|title=Netflix announces it's now live in 130 new countries including India and Russia|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10724112/netflix-global-expansion-russia-india|accessdate=6 January 2016|work=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=recode-netflixnearly&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix Expands Into India, but Not China|url=http://recode.net/2016/01/06/netflix-expands-into-india-but-not-china/|website=Re/code|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnet-nearlyevery&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix goes live in 130 new countries|url=http://www.cnet.com/au/news/netflix-goes-live-in-130-new-countries/|website=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2017-: China deal ==
During the CES 2016 announcement, Hastings stated that any potential expansion into China could take "many years", owing to the tightly regulated state of the internet and media industries in the country. While the company admitted that some of its original productions (such as ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny]]'') were meant to appeal to a potential Chinese audience, Hastings stated that the company was in the process of building relationships with local partners that it could form a joint venture with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roettgers|first1=Janko|title=Netflix's China Expansion could take 'many years,' CEO Reed Hastings Cautions|journal=Variety|date=January 19, 2016|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/netflix-china-expansion-1201683349/|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rights to ''House of Cards'' had previously been sold to [[Sohu]], where it was a modest success, but was pulled by regulators.&lt;ref name="fortune-houseofcardscn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is House of Cards Really a Hit in China?|url=http://fortune.com/2014/03/04/is-house-of-cards-really-a-hit-in-china/|website=Fortune|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thr-iquyideal"/&gt;

On April 25, 2017, Netflix announced that it had reached a licensing deal with the [[Baidu]]-owned streaming service [[iQiyi]], although specifics of the deal were not announced, some Netflix original productions will be available on iQivi day-and-date with their premiere elsewhere.&lt;ref name="thr-iquyideal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix Signs Licensing Deal With China's iQiyi|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/netflix-signs-licensing-deal-chinas-iqiyi-997071|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3630">'''Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association''', or '''JAMA''', is a [[trade association]] with its headquarters in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. It was founded in April 1967 and serves as a platform for the [[Japanese automobile industry|automakers of Japan]] to share technological developments and management practices.  There are currently 14 member companies, manufacturing not only cars, but [[truck]]s and [[motorcycle]]s as well. The organization also deals with the manufacturing and distribution of vehicle parts around the world. Together, the companies of JAMA hold a vast share of the markets in the United States, [[Europe]], and many [[developing countries]]. JAMA also has offices located in [[Beijing]], [[Singapore]], [[Washington, D.C.]] (US Office), [[Toronto]] (Canadian Office) and [[Brussels|Brussels, Belgium]] (Europe Office).

*'''[[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]]'''
*'''[[Yamaha Motor Company]]'''

== Other brands of member companies ==

The "Big Three" of Japan (Toyota, Nissan, and Honda), each have luxury divisions: Honda's ''[[Acura]]'' (created in 1986), Nissan's ''[[Infiniti]]'', and Toyota's ''[[Lexus]]'' (both created in 1989). Other than limited sales of the Infiniti Q45 these brands were only available outside Japan until 2005, when Lexus was introduced to the [[Japanese domestic market]] ("JDM"). Acura and Infiniti are also planned to be introduced into the Japanese domestic market by 2008. Toyota also began marketing some of its small domestic market cars in the [[United States]] under the ''[[Scion (car)|Scion]]'' marque in 2003.

In Japan, there are also numerous small car manufacturers, coachbuilders, and tuning companies. Companies such as [[Mitsuoka]], [[Spoon Sports]], and [[HKS Co., Ltd.|HKS]] build  production vehicles, sports cars, or one-off concepts in much smaller quantities than the major carmakers, therefore they are not included in JAMA.

'''John Arnold Bredenkamp''' (born 11 August 1940) is a Zimbabwean businessman and former rugby player. He is the founder of the [[Casalee Group]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], South Africa, Bredenkamp moved with his family to [[Southern Rhodesia]] while he was still a child. He was orphaned in his mid-teens on his birthday when while he was riding his bike, on return he found his father had shot his mother and sister and then shot himself. His sister survived the shooting. He was educated in Southern Rhodesia at [[Prince Edward School]], [[Harare|Salisbury]]. Of Dutch ancestry, Bredenkamp registered as a Rhodesian citizen in 1958. He is reported to have lost Zimbabwean citizenship "by default" in 1984, but this was restored to him shortly thereafter.

Bredenkamp is reported to hold Zimbabwean, South African and Dutch passports. The matter of his nationality was a matter of dispute with some Zimbabwean officials towards the end of 2006.  

As a Rugby Union international, he captained Rhodesia from 1965 to 1968.

==Early career==
After his graduation, Bredenkamp joined [[Gallaher Limited]], an international tobacco company in Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia), as a leaf buyer. In 1968 he was transferred to Niemeyer in the Netherlands, where he rose to the position of leaf director. 

After leaving Gallaher in 1976 Bredenkamp founded the Casalee Group of companies registered in [[Antwerp, Belgium]]. It is believed that the Casalee operation was involved in the sale of Rhodesian tobacco on world markets, through evasion of UN sanctions. Casalee was primarily a leaf tobacco merchanting company but was also engaged in general trading and an active initiator of counter trade and barter deals. The Casalee Group grew over 16 years to become the fifth largest tobacco merchant in the world and the biggest non-US leaf tobacco company. The Group employed 2,500 people and had offices in all the major tobacco growing countries in the world including the USA (Winston-Salem), Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Greece, India, Indonesia, Italy, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Thailand, Turkey and [[Yugoslavia]]. The company owned tobacco-processing factories in the Netherlands, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Brazil.

The Casalee Group of companies was sold in 1993 to Universal Leaf Tobacco, the largest leaf tobacco company in the world. Since then, Bredenkamp has expanded his business interests into many other different areas, mainly through the Zimbabwe registered Breco company.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 9 June 2006: [https://www.theguardian.com/zimbabwe/article/0,,1793719,00.html Tycoon flees Zimbabwe in private jet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in Zimbabwe==
Bredenkamp's career took off in earnest during the late 1970s when he became deeply involved in the commercial affairs of the embargoed [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|UDI]] regime in Rhodesia. It has been claimed that he effectively ran the finances of the Rhodesian armed forces during the later stages of the [[Rhodesia|Bush War]].&lt;ref&gt;newzimbabwe.com :[http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/quit12.14272.html financial and political dealings of Bredenkamp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206015906/http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/quit12.14272.html |date= 6 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity, he brokered export sales of Rhodesian products (mainly tobacco) and used the proceeds to fund the purchase of munitions and military equipment. His "sanctions busting" deals (often involving complex barter transactions) sustained the UDI regime for far longer than would otherwise have been possible. These deals were entirely legal under Rhodesian law.

After independence in 1980, Bredenkamp left Zimbabwe and moved his base of operations to Belgium. However, he remained involved in commodity trading and defence procurement. He made himself useful in certain quarters. In 1984 he made his peace with the rulers of the new Zimbabwe and was able to return home. Zimbabwe provided a hospitable base for Bredenkamp's dealings with customers in Africa and the Middle East. These dealings made Bredenkamp and his associates very wealthy men. They also helped sustain the Zimbabwean economy in a time of some turbulence.

Bredenkamp gained considerable clout in the political and economic affairs of Zimbabwe. It is known that he played a significant role in the events surrounding Zimbabwe's intervention in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo|DRC]] between 1998 and 2003. This intervention involved using the Zimbabwean army and air force to support the [[Laurent Kabila|Kabila]] government in its war with rebels backed by Uganda and Rwanda. There appears to have been some linkage between the intervention and generous mining concessions granted by the DRC to figures in the Zimbabwe political and business elite.&lt;ref&gt;UN report :[http://www.afrol.com/Countries/DRC/documents/un_resources_2002_govt_zim.htm – Zimbabwe involvement in DRC minerals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215131737/http://www.afrol.com/Countries/DRC/documents/un_resources_2002_govt_zim.htm |date=15 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Zimbabwe was subject to EU sanctions from 1999 onwards, the Mugabe regime was able to call on sanctions busting expertise from the UDI era to keep its armed forces supplied.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons, 18 November 2002 :[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo021118/text/21118w02.htm debate on Zimbabwe]&lt;/ref&gt;
      
Bredenkamp became something of a power behind the scenes in the ruling ZANU-PF party. It is claimed that he sought to facilitate the early retirement of [[Robert Mugabe|President Mugabe]] in 2004 and his replacement by [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]], former Security Minister and Speaker of Parliament. This displeased rival factions in ZANU-PF, and government investigations were started into the affairs of Bredenkamp's Breco trading company concerning tax evasion and exchange control violations. The matters under investigation were transactions between Breco in Zimbabwe and offshore companies controlled by Bredenkamp.

Bredenkamp has been linked to claims to facilitate the retirement of Mugabe in 2000, by the Guardian's investigation into the leaked US embassy cables&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/18/tzvangirai-mdc-wikileaks-mugabe-zanu|title=WikiLeaks cables: UN offered Robert Mugabe a lucrative retirement overseas|last=Doward|first=Jamie|date=2010-12-18|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2006 Bredenkamp was tried in Zimbabwe on charges that he used a South African passport on international journeys. Zimbabwean citizenship law does not permit dual nationality. Although acquitted, he had to fight a second court case to obtain an order to return his Zimbabwe passport which the clerk of the court had retained. He was ordered to produce documentary evidence of his renunciation of South African citizenship to have his nationality restored permanently.&lt;ref&gt;The Herald, September 2006 :[http://allafrica.com/stories/200609240048.html court returns Bredenkamp’s passport]&lt;/ref&gt; But his passport was returned.

In April 2016, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that Bredenkamp has an "estimated £700m fortune from tobacco trading, grey-market arms dealing, sports marketing and diamond mining."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/06/mugabe-zimbabwe-john-bredenkamp-billy-rautenbach-offshore-sanctions-panama-papers|title=Alleged Mugabe cronies kept offshore firms years after UN alert raised|last=Garside|first=Juliette|last2=Pegg|first2=David|date=2016-04-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25|last3=Watt|first3=Holly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bredenkamp is the subject of US sanctions aimed at people of significant influence within the Zimbabwean government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=2088|title=Sanctions List Search|website=sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''June Hunt''' (born Ruth June Hunt&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UZJICAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=%22Ruth+June+Hunt%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s How to forgive when you don't feel like it, by June Hunt, page 19 (bottom), 224 pages, Harvest House Publishers, published March 1, 2015, previously published June 14, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; on December 31, 1944, in [[Dallas]], Texas) is Founder and CSO (Chief Servant Officer) of Hope for the Heart, the nonprofit [[Christian ministry]] she founded in 1986.

Hunt is the author of the ''Biblical Counseling Library,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Hope for the Heart's Biblical Counseling Keys | date=November 4, 2011 |url=http://store.hopefortheheart.org/category-s/1815.htm |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 100-volume collection of topical, Biblical counseling manuals, that serves as the foundation for Hope for the Heart's international broadcasts, [[training]], publishing, [[teaching]] and [[biblical counseling]] ministry. Hunt's two radio broadcasts—''Hope in the Night'', a live 2-hour call-in counseling program, and ''Hope for the Heart'', a half-hour teaching program—air on approximately 900 radio outlets worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Hope for the Heart – Meet June |date=February 5, 2014 |url=http://www.hopefortheheart.org/about/meet-june/ |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Hunt grew up in Dallas, where she attended the [[Hockaday School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://religionblog.dallasnews.com/2008/05/june-hunt-plans-46m-complex-in.html/]&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt then graduated from [[Southern Methodist University]] in 1966&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smu.edu/StudentAffairs/StudentLife/Awards/MAward/AwardArchive SMU M Award Recipients List]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SMU Rotunda Yearbook for 1966&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[Bachelor of Music]] degree, and later earned a Master of Arts degree in [[Counseling]] from [[Criswell College]],

== Career ==
Hunt initially worked as Junior High Division Director—and later as College &amp; Career Director—at [[First Baptist Church (Dallas)|First Baptist Church]] in [[Dallas]], Texas, overseeing the spiritual formation of 1,200 members combined. In these roles, she was often called on to answer questions from students and parents about Christian living. Later, as a conference speaker, she was likewise approached by conference-goers to answer questions about "what the Bible has to say" on a myriad of topics.

To respond to these questions, Hunt created curriculum for a multi-year Bible survey course. Between 1989 and 1992, she developed and taught ''Counseling Through The Bible'', a [[Religious text|scripturally]]-based counseling course addressing 100 topics in categories such as marriage and family, rocky [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], emotional entrapments, Christian [[apologetics]], as well as addictions and abuse.  Since then, the [[coursework]] has been continuously refined to form the basis for the ''Biblical Counseling Library'', composed of 100 topical training manuals, each called ''Biblical Counseling Keys''.

The ''Counseling Library'' has served as the foundation of the [[Christian ministry|ministry]]'s steady expansion, including the 2002 creation of the ''Hope Biblical Counseling Institute'' (''BCI''). Initiated by Dallas' [[Criswell College]], the ''Institute'' equips spiritual leaders, counselors, and other caring people to find solutions for emotional, relational and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notable Kappa Deltas: June Hunt—Sigma Alpha-Southern Methodist University |date=November 4, 2011 |url=https://friends.kappadelta.org/content.aspx?audience=students&amp;item=Students/WhoWeAre/Famous/Hunt.xml |accessdate=2011-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002093214/https://friends.kappadelta.org/content.aspx?audience=students&amp;item=Students%2FWhoWeAre%2FFamous%2FHunt.xml |archivedate=October 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
During this time, Hunt also appeared as a guest on numerous national TV and radio programs, including [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]]''. She also toured overseas with the [[USO]] and was a guest soloist with the [[List of Billy Graham's crusades|Billy Graham Crusades]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Hope for the Heart==
''Hope for the Heart'''s ''Biblical Counseling Library'' provides a foundation for Hunt's two daily radio programs, ''Hope for the Heart'' and ''Hope in the Night''.  ''Hope for the Heart'' is a half-hour of interactive teaching. ''Hope in the Night'' is a live two-hour call-in counseling program. Together, the programs air worldwide on nearly 900 radio outlets.

The ministry is growing internationally as the ''Biblical Counseling Keys'' have been published in 27 languages and are being translated into many more. They can be found in more than 60 countries on six continents. HOPE-sponsored walk-in counseling centers operate internationally. In Canada, the ministry airs a Chinese language version of HOPE's radio briefs, ''Moment of Hope'', and sponsors a [[call center]] through which Chinese-speaking listeners receive biblical counsel.

In 2008, Hope for the Heart created a new Chair of Biblical Counseling at Criswell College. The ''Biblical Counseling Library'' is required curriculum for counseling students enrolled in this program.

==Recent Updates==
Hunt is the founder and CEO of The Hope Center in [[Plano, Texas]], a permanent home for nearly 50 nonprofit Christian ministries that share common space, a technology backbone, and amenities under one roof.  Hope for the Heart is the Center's [[anchor tenant]] and offers walk-in counseling by appointment at the Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DFW Christian Family: Cover Story June Hunt |date=November 4, 2011 |url=http://www.dfwchristianfamily.com/cover/JuneHunt.php |accessdate=2011-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326140709/http://www.dfwchristianfamily.com/cover/JuneHunt.php |archivedate=March 26, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt has been a regular guest professor at colleges and [[seminaries]]. She trains peers annually at the [[American Association of Christian Counselors]] conference and speaks at numerous other national and international conferences, as well as religious and broadcasting events each year on topics such as [[forgiveness]], [[anger]], [[fear]], [[childhood sexual abuse]], and [[domestic violence]].

In 2011, her article "Beyond Cancer: A Survivor’s Story”, appeared in the Vol. 18 No. 1 issue of the American Association of Christian Counseling magazine ''Christian Counseling Today''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7649">'''Kyvos''' is a [[big data]] [[business intelligence software]] developed by an American [[privately held company]] named '''Kyvos Insights'''. The company, headquartered in [[Los Gatos, California]], was founded in 2012. The software provides [[Online analytical processing|OLAP]]-based [[multidimensional analysis]] on big data and cloud platforms and was launched officially in June 2015.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.crn.com/news/applications-os/300077320/startup-kyvos-insights-exits-stealth-offers-olap-for-hadoop-software.htm|title=Startup Kyvos Insights Exits Stealth, Offers OLAP For Hadoop Software|last=Whiting|first=Rick|date=June 30, 2015|work=CRN Magazine|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://adtmag.com/articles/2015/06/30/kyvos-olap.aspx|title=Kyvos Emerges from Stealth with OLAP on Hadoop|last=Ramel|first=David|date=June 30, 2015|work=ADTmag|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December the same year, the company was listed among the 10 Coolest Big Data Startups of 2015 by [[CRN (magazine)|CRN Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.crn.com/slide-shows/applications-os/300079062/the-10-coolest-big-data-startups-of-2015.htm/10|title=The 10 Coolest Big Data Startups Of 2015|last=Whiting|first=Rick|date=December 8, 2015|work=CRN Magazine|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
The software uses [[Online analytical processing|OLAP]] technology to enable [[business intelligence]] on big data platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.datanami.com/2015/06/30/kyvos-debuts-olap-for-hadoop/|title=Kyvos Debuts OLAP for Hadoop|last=Woodie|first=Alex|date=June 30, 2015|work=Datanami|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report published by [[Forrester Research]] in 2016,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Forrester+Wave+Native+Hadoop+BI+Platforms+Q3+2016/-/E-RES129500|title=The Forrester Wave™: Native Hadoop BI Platforms, Q3 2016|last=Evelson|first=Boris|date=September 13, 2016|work=Forrester Research|access-date=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they evaluated several native [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]] business intelligence (BI) platforms on 22 parameters, Kyvos was referred to as a platform that gave new life to OLAP by bringing it to Hadoop. As per the report, Kyvos enables analysis on Hadoop based on OLAP schemas, aggregations, and predefined drill-down paths. It pre-calculates aggregates at multiple levels of dimensional hierarchies to improve query response times as compared to SQL-on-Hadoop platforms. Users can analyze data through the Kyvos visualization tool or by using other BI platforms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Kyvos was originally built for Hadoop and later on added support for Cloud platforms such as [[Amazon Web Services]] (AWS), [[Google Cloud Platform|Google Cloud]] &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=117535|title=Kyvos Insights Now Supports Google Cloud|last=Rowe|first=Sam Del|date=April 12, 2017|work=Destination CRM|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Microsoft Azure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/kyvos-insights-embraces-microsoft-azure-hdinsight/|title=Kyvos Insights embraces Microsoft Azure, HDInsight|last=Brust|first=Andrew|date=March 22, 2016|work=ZD Net|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, it supported only MDX queries and integrated with [[data visualization]] tools such as [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] and [[Tableau Software|Tableau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2942859/big-data/kyvos-serves-up-hadoop-on-cubes.html|title=Kyvos serves up Hadoop on cubes|last=Jackson|first=Joab|date=July 1, 2015|work=Computer World|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, Kyvos 4.0 added support for SQL connectivity extending integration to other BI tools such as [[BusinessObjects|Business Objects]], [[Cognos]],  [[MicroStrategy]], [[Power BI]] and [[Qlik]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In late 2018, Version 5 of the software was built specifically for the cloud with elastic OLAP to provide a cloud native way to scale up and down for changing data workloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.datanami.com/this-just-in/kyvos-insights-announces-the-availability-of-kyvos-version-5/|title=Kyvos Insights Announces the Availability of Kyvos Version 5|last=|first=|date=November 15, 2018|work=Datanami|access-date=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dzone.com/articles/kyvos-releases-version-5|title=Kyvos Releases Version 5|last=Ferrell|first=Lauren|date=November 16, 2018|work=DZone|access-date=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lawrence Lewis''' (April 4, 1767 &amp;ndash; November 20, 1839) was a nephew of [[George Washington]] who married [[Eleanor Parke Custis Lewis|Nelly Custis]], a granddaughter of [[Martha Washington]].

==Life==
He was born in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] in 1767 to [[Fielding Lewis]] and [[Betty Washington Lewis]], the sister of George Washington. He volunteered for service in 1794 to help suppress the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] and served as aide-de-camp to General [[Daniel Morgan]], achieving the rank of [[major]].&lt;ref name=Sorley&gt;Sorley, Merrow Egerton. [https://books.google.com/books?id=wCowEcMe3BcC ''Lewis of Warner Hall''] (1935, reprinted 1979), pp. 202-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington, after finishing his tenure as president, called on several of his nephews to assist him at his [[Mount Vernon]] plantation. On August 4, 1797, he wrote to Lewis inviting him to serve as his personal secretary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consource.org/index.asp?bid=582&amp;fid=600&amp;documentid=55816 "George Washington to Lawrence Lewis (August 4, 1797)"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, The Constitutional Sources Project. Accessed August 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Mount Vernon, Lewis came to know Eleanor "Nelly" Parke Custis, the granddaughter of Martha Dandridge Custis Washington and [[Daniel Parke Custis]]. She and her brother, [[George Washington Parke Custis]], had been informally adopted by George and Martha Washington after the 1781 death of their father, [[John Parke Custis]]. At Mount Vernon she acted as the social director, entertaining the many visitors to the former president.

==Woodlawn==
[[Image:Woodlawn August 2003 A.jpg|left|thumb|275px|[[Woodlawn Plantation]], Fairfax County, Virginia (1805)]]
Lewis and Nelly Custis were married at Mount Vernon on February 22, 1799,&lt;ref name=Sorley/&gt;
and resided there for the first several years of their marriage. Their first child, Frances Parke Lewis, was born at Mount Vernon estate on November 27, 1799.

After George Washington's death on December 14, 1799, Lewis served as the primary executor of his will. As a wedding gift from the Washingtons, the couple had received {{convert|2000|acre|km2}} of the Mount Vernon plantation. From 1800 to 1805, Lewis oversaw the construction of the [[Woodlawn Plantation]], designed by the physician-architect [[William Thornton]].&lt;ref name=Sorley/&gt;

Lewis and his wife lived at Woodlawn until about 1830, when they settled at the new Audley estate in what is now [[Clarke County, Virginia]]. Lewis had purchased the tract of {{convert|571|acre|km2}} from George Washington's extensive real estate holdings. He died in 1839 in [[Arlington, Virginia]] and was buried in the vault at Mount Vernon, close to the sarcophagi of George and Martha Washington.&lt;ref name=Sorley/&gt;

==Family==
The Lewises had eight children, four of whom lived past infancy:

* Frances Parke Lewis (1799–1875) – married Edward George Washington Butler, nephew of General [[Richard Butler (general)|Richard Butler]].&lt;ref name=Sorley/&gt; 
* Martha Betty Lewis (1801–1802)
* Lawrence Fielding Lewis (1802–1802)

'''Location intelligence''' ('''LI'''), or '''spatial intelligence''', is the process of deriving meaningful insight from [[geographic data and information|geospatial data]] relationships to solve a particular problem.&lt;ref&gt;Data Resources For Real Estate And Business Geography Analysis. Thrall,G.,I.,Ph.D.(2009)/Professor, Department of Geography, College of Liberal Arts And Sciences and Miller Center For Retail, College of Business, University of Florida&lt;/ref&gt; It involves layering multiple data sets spatially and/or chronologically, for easy reference on a map, and its applications span industries, categories and organizations.

Maps have been used to represent information throughout the ages, but what might be referenced as the first example of true location 'intelligence' was in London in 1854 when [[John Snow]] was able to debunk theories about the spread of cholera by overlaying a map of the area with the location of water pumps and was able to narrow the source to a single water pump. This layering of information over a map was able to identify relationships between different sets of geospatial data.

Location or [[geographical information  system]] (GIS) tools enable spatial experts to collect, store, [[data analysis|analyze]] and [[data visualization|visualize data]]. Location intelligence experts can use a variety of spatial and business analytical tools to measure optimal locations for operating a business or providing a service. Location intelligence experts begin with defining the [[business ecosystem]] which has many interconnected economic influences. Such economic influences include but are not limited to culture, lifestyle, labor, healthcare, cost of living, crime, economic climate and education.

==Further definitions==
The term "location intelligence" is often used to describe the people, data and technology employed to geographically "map" information. These mapping applications can transform large amounts of data into color-coded visual representations that make it easy to see trends and generate meaningful intelligence. The creation of location intelligence is directed by [[domain knowledge]], formal frameworks, and a focus on decision support. Location cuts across through everything i.e. devices, platforms, software and apps, and is one of the most important ingredient of understanding context in sync with social data, mobile data, user data, sensor data.

Location intelligence is also used to describe the integration of a geographical component into [[business intelligence]] processes and tools, often incorporating [[spatial database]] and spatial [[OLAP]] tools.

In 2012, Wayne Gearey from the [[real estate industry]] ([[JLL (company)|JLL]]) offered the first applied course on location intelligence at the University of Texas at Dallas in which he defined location intelligence as the process for selecting the optimal location that will support workplace success and address a variety of business and financial objectives.&lt;ref name="RealViews 2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jllrealviews.com/trends/why-location-intelligence-is-a-game-changer-for-the-property-industry/|title=Why location intelligence is a ‘game changer’ for real estate|last=Avery|first=Lois|date=2015-05-20|website=RealViews|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019164338/https://www.jllrealviews.com/trends/why-location-intelligence-is-a-game-changer-for-the-property-industry/|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=W.M. Gearey, N.M.Trodd, A. Fobes|title=Utilizing Location Intelligence for the Placement of Corporate Services|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_401758_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pitney Bowes]] MapInfo Corporation describes location intelligence as follows: "Spatial information, commonly known as "Location", relates to involving, or having the nature of where. Spatial is not constrained to a geographic location however most common business uses of spatial information deal with how spatial information is tied to a location on the earth. Miriam-Webster® defines Intelligence as "The ability to learn or understand, or the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one`s environment." Combining these terms alludes to how you achieve an understanding of the spatial aspect of information and apply it to achieve a significant competitive advantage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=George Moon |publisher=Pitney Bowes |url=http://www.pbinsight.com/files/resource-library/resource-files/LocationIntell_WP_2-27Final.pdf |format=PDF |language=en |title=Location Intelligence – Meeting IT Expectation |date=c. 2008 |access-date=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Definition by [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] is as follows: "Location Intelligence is defined as the capacity to organize and understand complex data through the use of geographic relationships. LI organizes business and geographically referenced data to reveal the relationship of location to people, events, transactions, facilities, and assets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=ESRI |url=https://www.esri.com/~/media/files/pdfs/library/whitepapers/pdfs/using-location-intelligence.pdf |format=PDF |language=en |title=Using Location Intelligence to Maximize the Value of BI |access-date=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Definition by [[Yankee Group]] within their White Paper "Location Intelligence in Retail Banking: "...a business management term that refers to spatial data visualization, contextualization and analytical capabilities applied to solve a business problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Marcus Torchia |publisher=Pitney Bowes |url=http://www.pbinsight.com/files/resource-library/resource-files/yankee-group.pdf |format=PDF |language=en |title=Location Intelligence in Retail Banking |date=c. 2009 |access-date=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Near (company)|Near]] defines location intelligence as the gamut of geo-spatial analytic models, algorithms, techniques and tools that harness location-indexed streaming and static data to provide requisite answers to questions around location such as the attributes of i) a place, ii) people visiting a place, and iii) products consumed at a place. Location intelligence platforms encapsulate these technologies, ingest relevant data sources, and provide it as data-as-a-service, or use it to power data-driven products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmaglobal.com/articles/location-intelligence-next-frontier |title= Location Intelligence: The Next Frontier|publisher=Mobile Marketing Association, Inc|date=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instarea defines location intelligence as "Using [[machine learning]] algorithms to uncover trends that would be otherwise unknown using human based rules in a large location data set."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3795764|title=Market Trends: Ways CSPs Can Exploit Location Data|last=|first=|date=|website=Gartner.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial applications==

Location intelligence is used by a broad range of industries to improve overall business results. Applications include:
* [[Communications]] and [[telecommunications]]: [[Network planning and design]], boundary identification, identifying new customer markets.
* [[Financial services]]: Optimize branch locations, market analysis, [[Share of Wallet|share of wallet]] and [[cross-sell]] activities, [[mergers &amp; acquisitions]], industry sector analysis, risk management.

'''Luis de Jesus Rodriguez Gutierrez''' (born July 8, 1963) is a [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominican]] attorney, [[businessman]], and [[entrepreneur]]. Rodriguez has served as director of the [[Domino's Pizza]] franchise in the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Haiti]] since 1993, as well as director of car rental company [[Avis Budget Group]] since 1997. He currently serves on the Board of Directors of Universal AFI and as Managing Director of Investment Fund Casa de Santo Domingo.&lt;ref name=li&gt;{{cite web|url=https://do.linkedin.com/in/luisdejesusrodriguez|title=Luis de Jesús Rodríguez|publisher=LinkedIn|date=|accessdate=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years and education ==

Luis de Jesus Gutierrez Rodriguez was born on July 8, 1963 in [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]], a village in the [[La Vega Province]] within the central region of the [[Dominican Republic]]. He is the son of a Spanish immigrant and a Dominican woman. From a young age, Luis' father decided to leave his job as a farmer to work as a sales representative, and moved the family to the capital of [[Santo Domingo]]. After that, they moved to the city of [[Higüey (city)|Higüey]], in the east of the island.

Luis and his brother studied at the John XXIII School, which was owned by the Catholic Church. Due to economic difficulties as a result of his father's failed businesses, Rodríguez began working from the age of twelve years as a money changer at the entrance of the local post office. In 1978, Luis and his family were evicted from their home by creditors of the property, forcing them to return to Santo Domingo. At the age of 16, Rodríguez decided to apply for the position of washer at the used car department of National Car Rental. Although initially he did not get the job, the interviewer thought Rodríguez was better suited to work in the rental department, and hired him as an assistant. Rodríguez continued studying at public night school while he worked during the day as a rental agent trainee.&lt;ref name=puroturismo /&gt;

After finishing high school, Rodríguez started his law degree, graduating with honors at the age 21. At this time, he was promoted as general manager of National Car Rental.&lt;ref name=puroturismo /&gt; Currently, Rodríguez has an MBA from [[CEU San Pablo University]], and a master's degree in Management from the [[University of Barcelona]].&lt;ref name=casa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://es.slideshare.net/bachatus|title=Casa de Santo Domingo: Presentación 2015|author=|date=2015|accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business career ==

At the age of 22, Rodríguez decided to start a car rental business with the help of a Spanish investment group.&lt;ref name=puroturismo /&gt; In 1986, he founded Express Rent-a-Car with an initial fleet of 8 cars.&lt;ref name=li /&gt; Two years later, the business had a fleet of 150 cars and became part of the Thrifty Car Rental Dominican franchise. In 1990, Rodríguez also acquired the Thrifty franchise in [[Puerto Rico]]. In 1992, he sold his stake in the company to his Spanish partners to start other businesses.

In 1992, Rodríguez bought the [[Domino's Pizza]] franchise for the [[Dominican Republic]], opening the first store in the country a year later.&lt;ref name=li /&gt; At that time, Domino's was only the second American franchise in the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref name=bistro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialesyturismo.blogspot.com/2014/01/ahora-en-novo-centro-domino-spizza.html|title=¡Ahora en Novo Centro!

A year later, Domino's was the first American franchise to open in the country of [[Haiti]]. During his time in charge of the franchise, Rodríguez has received the Gold Franny Award, awarded by Domino’s headquarters to the best franchise operators.&lt;ref name=bistro /&gt; His son, Luis Francisco Rodriguez, is general manager of the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecosatur.blogspot.com/2013/10/inauguran-dominos-bistro-360.html|title=Inauguran Domino's Bistro 360|last=Contreras |first=Carmen |publisher=''Ecosatur'' |date=October 30, 2013|accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrord.do/estilo-de-vida/luis-rodriguez-nuestras-pizzas-son-una-obra-de-arte/ftwokx---bWTl0HsiRUom/|title=Luis Rodríguez: "Nuestras pizzas son una obra de arte"|last=De Jesús |first=Alicia |publisher=''Metro''|date=November 24, 2015|accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Rodríguez acquired 50% of the shares of Servicolt, the operating company of the [[Avis Rent a Car System|Avis Rent-a-Car]] franchise. In 2004, he also acquired [[Budget Car Rental]], becoming the largest car rental company in the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref name=sc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suelocaribe.com/index.php/2013-12-12-19-21-39/124-rent-a-car|title=Budget lanza servicio de leasing corporativo; facilita a empresas adquisición de vehículos Imprimir Correo electrónico|first=|last=|publisher=''Suelo Caribe''|date=September 18, 2014|accessdate=March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cicom.co/blog/?p=19082|title=Budget lanza servicio de leasing corporativo|first=|last=|publisher=CiCOM: Comunicación Relaciones Públicas|date=September 12, 2014|accessdate=March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Rodriguez also acquired [[Payless Car Rental]] to consolidate business operations.&lt;ref name=casa /&gt; Under the direction of Rodríguez, Avis has made alliances with [[Delta Air Lines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercadosocialespectaculos.com/2007/06/avis-rent-car-y-delta-air-lines.html|title=Avis Rent a Car y Delta Air Lines anuncian acuerdo comercial|last=Lora|first=Manuela|publisher=''Mercado Social''|date=June 22, 2007|accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mini (marque)|Mini Cooper]],&lt;ref name=sc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://16-minutos.blogspot.com/2013/08/avis-rent-car-anuncia-alianza-con-mini.html|title=Avis Rent Car anuncia alianza con Mini Cooper en apertura de sus nuevas oficinas en Galería 360|first=|last=|publisher=''16 Minutos''|date=August 16, 2013|accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Audi]].&lt;ref name=puroturismo /&gt; Currently, Avis has a fleet of 1,000 vehicles and 16 locations in the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref name=puroturismo&gt;{{cite web|last=Acosta|first=Stephanny |year=2015 |title=Luis Rodríguez: CEO Avis Rent-a-Car |magazine=''Puro Turismo'' |page=14 |url=https://issuu.com/puroturismo/docs/puro_turismo_-_isla_beata |accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Mikimoto Kōkichi'''|御木本 幸吉||extra=25 January 1858 &amp;ndash; 21 September 1954}} was a [[Japan]]ese entrepreneur who is credited with creating the first [[cultured pearl]] and subsequently starting the cultured pearl industry with the establishment of his luxury pearl company Mikimoto.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, Kristin and Addison, Shellei. Pearls: Ornament and Obsession. New York, NY: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward, Fred 2002"&gt;Ward, Fred. Pearls: Bethesda, MD: Gem Book Publishers, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kokichi's company was awarded patents for pearl cultivation and in 1985 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the patent system he was selected as one of Japan's top 10 inventors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.batfa.com/greatjapanese.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mikimoto-cosme.com"&gt;http://www.mikimoto-cosme.com/en/company/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;  He was inducted into the [[House of Peers (Japan)|house of peers]] by imperial decree and posthumously awarded the ''Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Sacred Treasure]]''.&lt;ref name="Ward, Fred 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mikimoto-cosme.com"/&gt; 

The company was ranked as one of the worlds most luxury brands by [[Women's Wear Daily|WWD]] and Mikimoto Kokichi was considered one of the best Japanese financial leaders of the 20th century by [[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]].&lt;ref name="mikimoto-cosme.com"/&gt; He is also known as the founder of Mikimoto Pharmaceuticals, a company specialising in beauty products containing pearl calcium. [[Mikimoto Pearl Island]] is named after him. In addition, the reputed "Phoenix [[Mikimoto Crown]]" used by former [[Miss Universe]] winners as well as the crown used by [[Miss International]] is credited to his patented work. 

==Early life==
On 25 January 1858, Mikmoto was born in [[Toba, Mie|Toba]], [[Shima Province]] (now [[Mie Prefecture]]). Mikimoto's father was an ''[[udon]]'' shop owner. Mikimoto was the eldest son. At age 11, Mikimoto's father fell ill. He left school at the age of 13 and sold [[vegetables]] to support his family. Seeing the [[Pearl hunting|pearl divers]] of [[Ise, Japan|Ise]] unloading their treasures at the shore in his childhood started his fascination with [[pearl]]s. &lt;ref name="mikimotoamerica_legacy"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mikimotoamerica.com/legacy |title= Legacy and Biography of Kokichi Mikimoto |work=mikimotoamerica.com |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 20, Mikimoto noticed the many flaws of pearls as he judged a pearl exhibition in 1878. This began Mikimoto’s search for the development of the perfect pearl.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Vol. 205, Iss. 67|last=Steigrad|first=Alexandra|date=April 2013|work=Women's Wear Daily|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pioneering cultured pearls==
Mikimoto began his search of an alternative method to produce pearls as the chairman of the Shima Marine Products Improvement Association. At this point the demand for pearls had severely outweighed the supply, prompting the consideration of an effort to protect the oysters.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pearl King; the story of the fabulous Mikimoto|last=Eunson|first=Robert|publisher=Angus and Robertson|year=1955|isbn=|location=|pages=71-80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, Mikimoto obtained a loan to start his first [[pearl oyster]] farm at the Shinmei inlet on [[Ago Bay]] in Mie prefecture with his wife and partner Ume. On 11 July 1893, after many failures and near bankruptcy, he was able to create the hemispherical [[cultured pearls]]. The pearls were made by seeding the oyster with a small amount of mother of pearl.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Despite this major discovery there were initially difficulties in selling his cultured pearls due to public confusion. To encourage sales, Mikimoto opened a jewelry boutique in Ginza where he was able to have workers educate the consumer on the nature of the cultured pearls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He introduced these mabes at a marine products exposition in [[Norway]] in 1897 and began an export business. However, it took him another 12 years to create completely spherical pearls that were indistinguishable from the highest quality natural ones, and commercially viable harvests were not obtained until the 1920s. In 1927, Mikimoto met with inventor, Thomas Edison, who was in awe of Mikimoto's cultured pearls as it was "supposed to be biologically impossible".&lt;ref name="Pearl Jamming with Mikimoto"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://popspoken.com/fashion/2015/03/pearl-jamming-mikimoto | title=Pearl Jamming with Mikimoto | accessdate=8 March 2015 | publisher=[[Popspoken]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mikimoto did not know that government biologist [[Tokichi Nishikawa]] and a carpenter, Tatsuhei Mise, had each spent time in Australia and learned the secret to spherical pearl production from expatriate British marine biologist [[William Saville-Kent]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=George|first=C. Denis|title=Debunking a Widely Held Japanese Myth: Historical Aspects on the Early Discovery of the Pearl Cultivating Technique |url=http://www.pearl-guide.com/debunking-japanese-myth.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; inserting a piece of oyster epithelial membrane (the lip of mantle tissue) with a nucleus of shell or metal into an oyster's body or mantle causes the tissue to form a pearl sack. The sack produces [[nacre]], which coats the nucleus, thus creating a pearl. Mise received a 1907 [[patent]] for this grafting needle. When Nishikawa applied in the same year, he realized that Mise had already secured a patent. In a compromise, the pair agreed to cooperate, calling their discovery the "Mise-Nishikawa method".

Mikimoto had received a patent in 1896 for producing hemispherical pearls, or [[mabes]], and a 1908 patent for culturing in mantle tissue, but he could not use the Mise-Nishikawa method without invalidating his own patents. Mikimoto then altered his patent application to cover a technique to make round pearls in mantle tissue, which was granted in 1916. However, this method was not commercially viable. Mikimoto finally made arrangements to use Nishikawa's methods after 1916, and Mikimoto's business began to expand rapidly.

==Industry success==
The new technology enabled Japan's cultured pearl industry to quickly expand after 1916; by 1935 there were 350 pearl farms in Japan producing 10 million cultured pearls annually.

[[File:Mikimoto Ginza2.JPG|thumb|Mikimoto store in [[Ginza]], [[Chūō, Tokyo|Chūō]], Tokyo]]

In 1899, the first Mikimoto pearl shop opened in the fashionable [[Ginza]] district of [[Tokyo]] selling natural seed pearls and half round pearls. The Mikimoto business expanded internationally, opening stores in [[London]] (1913).

By 1935, the Japanese pearl industry was facing oversupply issues and plummeting prices for Japanese cultured pearls. Mikimoto promoted Japanese pearls in Europe and the USA to counteract falling prices. He publicly burnt tons of low-quality pearls as a publicity stunt to establish a reputation that the Mikimoto company only sold high-quality cultured pearls.

After World War II, Mikimoto opened stores in [[Paris]], [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[Boston]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Shanghai]] and [[Bombay]], and was thus one of the first Japanese brands to attain an international presence and recognition.

Mikimoto had to constantly fight allegations that his pearls were only “imitations” of real pearls,&lt;ref name="Pearl Jamming with Mikimoto"/&gt; despite scientific reports to the contrary. Mikimoto took advantage of every opportunity to personally promote his pearls, and took part in the [[Sesquicentennial Exposition|1926 Philadelphia World Exposition]] in which he displayed a replica of the "[[Liberty Bell]]" covered with pearls.

Mikimoto was the official jeweler of the [[Miss USA]] (2003–2008), [[Miss Universe]] (2002–2007) and [[Miss Teen USA]] (2002–2008) pageants, under the [[Miss Universe Organization]].

In 2010/2011, the company's estimated total sales were €300 million.&lt;ref name="Luxury"&gt;{{cite book | title=Luxury Brand Management | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | author=Chevalier, Michel | year=2012 | location=Singapore | isbn=978-1-118-17176-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Mikimoto's wife was Ume, who was also his partner in creating the cultured pearl. &lt;ref name="karipearls_mikimotowife"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.karipearls.com/mikimoto-and-wife-ume-of-pearl-island.html |title= Mikimoto and Wife Ume of Pearl Island |work=karipearls.com |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mikimoto and his wife have five children. &lt;ref name="alist_mikimoto"/&gt; Mikimoto's children are Rui (eldest daughter), Mine (second daughter), Yo (third daughter), Ai (youngest daughter), and Ryuzo (son).
On 21 September 1954, Mikimoto died. He was 96. Mikimoto's personal memorabilia is displayed at Mikimoto Pearl Island Memorial Hall, a museum in Toba, Japan. &lt;ref name="alist_mikimoto"&gt;Kim, Svetlana (20 November 2012){{cite web |url=http://alist-magazine.com/home/unforgattable-dream/ |title= Kokichi Mikimoto's Unforgettable Dream |work=alist-magazine.com |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="karipearls_mikimoto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.karipearls.com/mikimoto-pearl-island-memorial-hall.html |title= Mikimoto Pearl Island Memorial Hall |work=karipearls.com |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
''Model Audit Rule'' is a financial reporting regulation applicable to [[insurance]] companies, and borrows significantly from the [[Sarbanes Oxley]] Act of 2002 (see ‘key sections’ below). The ''Model Audit Rule'' is co-developed by the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (“AICPA”) and [[National Association of Insurance Commissioners]] (“NAIC”) and issued by NAIC &lt;ref name = "AISA"&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.iasa.org/Members/Content/NavigationMenu/PublicationsTextbooks/theInterpreter/20082009InterpreterIssues/Winter2009/FeatureArticleTheNAICModelAuditRule/default.htm |title=The NAIC Model Audit Rule: Change is Imminent – Will Your Organization be Prepared? |last=Murphy |first=James, CPA |accessdate=July 3, 2013 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
with revisions in 2006 and has taken effect in 2010.&lt;ref name = "Sunera"&gt;
{{cite web |url = https://sunera.com/internal-audit-services/model-audit-rule/ |title = SUNERA – Model Audit Rule |last = |origyear= 2005|year=2013 |publisher=Sunera LLC. |accessdate= July 1, 2013 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The NAIC internal designation for the Annual Financial Reporting Model Regulation is '''MDL 205''', where ''MDL'' stands for ''Model'', and the number of the model rule is ''205''.&lt;ref name = "NAIC Store Model Laws"&gt;{{cite web

|date = 2013 |origyear= 1991 |publisher= National Association of Insurance Commissioners
|accessdate= July 8, 2013 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Because the regulation was issued by NAIC, which is not a federal agency with direct regulatory power, its adoption is on a state-by-state basis.&lt;ref name = "NAIC FAQ"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==

The ''Model Audit Rule'' was issued to:
* Govern the submission of audited statutory financial statements by insurance companies &lt;ref name = "Sutherland" /&gt;
* Drive Consistency Across Insurance Regulators &lt;ref name = "Sunera" /&gt;
* Improve the ability of state insurance departments to oversee the financial condition of insurers &lt;ref name = "Sutherland" /&gt;

The ''Model Audit Rule'' requires the following to be submitted by insurance companies operating in states which have adopted the regulation:
*	An Annual Financial Statement Audit by an Independent [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] &lt;ref name = "MAR 205"&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.naic.org/store/free/MDL-205.pdf
|title = Annual Financial Reporting Model Regulation
|publisher = National Association of Insurance Commissioners – Model Regulation Service
|date= October 2007
|accessdate= June 28, 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
*	Communication of Internal Control Related Matters Noted in the Audit &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;
*	Managements Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;

== Key Sections ==

=== Section 4 – Financial Report Filing Requirements ===

All insurers must have an annual audit by an independent CPA. This audit must be filed by June 1 following the preceding December 31 year end.&lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt; An insurer may receive an extension for both the Audit report (performed by an independent CPA) and Managements report on internal controls. Here, the term Management refers to the management of the insurer.

For example, filing for the year ending December 31, 2012 must be done by June 1, 2013.

=== Section 5 – Financial Report Contents ===

The annual audited financial report should show the financial position, results of its operations, cash flows and changes in capital and surplus. The insurers report must be in conformity with statutory accounting practices of the Department of Insurance of the insurers’ state.&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;

'''§5(G)''' The financial reports must be comparative, that is, to show the most recent year end against the preceding year end. For example, in a financial report for the year ending December 31, 2013, for each line item, the report must show the result for December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012.&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;

'''§5(A – F)''' The financial report must include:
* Report by an Independent CPA (i.e. Independent Auditors Report) &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;
* Balance Sheet &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;
* Statement of Operations (i.e. Income Statement in a for-profit operation) &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;
* Statement of Cash Flow &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;
* Statement of Changes in Capital and Surplus &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;
* Notes to the Financial Statements &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;

=== Section 7 – Qualifications of Independent External Auditor ===

Many items in this section are based on the underlying requirement that the audit of the insurer must be performed by an independent CPA / CPA firm.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

This section of the ''Model Audit Rule'' describes the qualifications of an Independent external auditor for an insurer through the following major themes:
* '''Liability''' – External Auditor Liability and 
* '''Disassociation''' – Mandatory Audit Partner Rotation, and Audit Leadership being apart from insurers leadership through a minimum time frame 
* '''Non Audit Services''' – Description of Services that the External Auditor cannot perform while engaged in the audit of the insurers financial statement

;Liability
'''§7(A)(2)''' The external auditor is liable for representations made in the audit of the insurer.&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt; This promotes auditors independence because the external auditor has “skin in the game” and can be held liable for misrepresentations made on its audit report, and other responsibilities.

;Disassociation
'''§7(D)(1)''' is similar to SOX 203 in requiring the rotation of the lead audit partner, with a five year “cool off” period, after a five year consecutive period with the audit of the insurer. In addition to this, Section 7(L)(1) addresses that a CPA firms senior manager or partner cannot be a part of the insurers leadership for one year prior to the audit.&lt;ref name="Sutherland" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|9}}

;Non-Audit Services
'''§7(G)(1)''' is similar to SOX 201 in the restriction of non-audit services being performed by the CPA firm conducting the audit of the insurers financials.&lt;ref name="Sutherland" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;

The principles governing non-audit services are that the CPA / CPA firm cannot:
* Function in the role of management (§7(G)(2))&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;
* Audit their own work (§7(G)(2)),&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt; and
* Serve in an advocacy role for the insurer (§7(G)(2))&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;

Particular non-audit services mentioned include (Section 7(G)(1)) 
* Bookkeeping or other services related to accounting records of the Insurer &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|7}}
* Financial Information System Design &amp; Implementation &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|7}}
* Appraisal or Valuation Services &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|7}}
* Actuarial advisory services involving determination of financial statement amounts &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|7}}
* Internal Audit Outsourcing &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|7}} &lt;!-- rp|7 means the page number of the source --&gt;
* Management or Human Resources functions &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|7}}
* Broker / Dealer functions &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|7}}
* Legal services or expert services unrelated to the audit &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|7}}
* Any other services that the commissioner determines, by regulation, to be impermissible.&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

'''§7(F)''' provides that state insurance commissioner the authority to, following a hearing on the matter, force an insurer to change the auditor of its financial statements.&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt; In addition, according to drafting notes contained within this section, the state insurance commissioner shall consider using guidance provided in the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) final rule No.33-8183 &lt;ref name = "SEC 33-8183"&gt;{{cite web 
|url = https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-8183.htm
|title = Securities and Exchange Commission, Release No. 33-8183
|date = March 27, 2003 
|accessdate= July 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
, strengthening the commissions requirements regarding auditor independence.&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;

'''§7(J)''' provides that all audit and non-audit services to the insurer must be approved first by the insurers audit committee.&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|8}}

=== Section 9 – Scope of Audit and Independent External Audit Report ===

This section of the ''Model Audit Rule'' describes the resources that the external auditor must consult in planning and performing the audit of an insurers financial statements. 
The following are the requirements noted and standards borrowed to complete the requirement. The Auditor must:

{| class="wikitable"
|-

|-
| Conduct the audit in accordance with [[Generally Accepted Auditing Standards]] (GAAS) || Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|10}}

|}

=== Section 11 – Communication of Internal Control Matters ===

The insurer must provide to the state insurance commissioner a report on internal control weaknesses that are still outstanding as of the close of the audit. The terminology used here is unremediated material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|10}}

To successfully provide the unremediated internal control weaknesses report, the concept of materiality must be explained. Here, the insurer and external auditor are directed to the [[Statements on Auditing Standards]] No. 60 (SAS 60), Internal Control Related Matters Noted in the Audit &lt;ref name="Sutherland" /&gt;{{rp|10}} regarding the term material weakness.&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|11}}

The Internal Controls Report must, for each material weakness:
* Describe the unremediated material weakness &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|11}}
* Describe Actions taken or planned on to remediate the weakness going forward (if not already communicated by the auditor)&lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|11}}
* (If none exist), then the report must state that fact &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|11}} 
* The report must also coincide with the most recent insurers annual financial statements &lt;ref name="MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|11}}

An example of this communication, as would be sent to the state insurance commissioner, is the following:

Honorable Commissioner
State of Domicile Insurance Department 
State of Domicile

Dear Honorable Commissioner:

During the audit completed for the year ended December 31, 20XX, for XYZ Holding Company Inc (“XYZ”), a material weakness was noted in XYZ’s internal control over financial reporting related to the calculation of insurance reserves. Due to the manner in which the data for homeowners policies are captured by the systems used in its Southeastern US regional office, changes in XYZ’s estimate of insurance reserves for certain policies are not reviewed by XYZ’s Actuarial Department prior to being recorded in the company’s accounting records.

A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. In connection with the weakness noted above, XYZ’s management has taken remedial actions to change its procedures for coding policies issued in the states affected so that all homeowners’ policy data are included in the Actuarial Department review of estimate of insurance reserves. This change was effective on July 1, 20XX.

Should you have any questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me at the number noted above. &lt;br /&gt;
Regards,

XYZ Holding Company, Inc.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Section 15 – Conduct of Insurer for Documentation ===
The insurers’ leadership (officers, directors) cannot improperly influence an external auditor of the insurers’ financial statements. “When the officer, director, or person acting under his or her direction knew or should have known that the action, if successful (but regardless of whether the action is in fact successful) could result in rendering the issuers financial statements materially misleading” &lt;ref name = "Sutherland" /&gt;{{rp|7}}&lt;br /&gt;

==== Fraud and Gross Negligence ====

'''§15''' is closely related to Rule '''13b2-2(b)''' under the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]].&lt;ref name = "Sutherland" /&gt;{{rp|7}} The standard for violation used here includes [[fraud]] (acting with intent to deceive) as well as [[gross negligence]] (reckless disregard for the truth). Gross negligence is invoked under the phrase “known or should have known” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Mistakes to Avoid|url=http://holbornassets.com/top-7-financial-mistakes-to-avoid-in-2016/|accessdate=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sutherland" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

=== Section 16 – Management Report on Internal Control ===
This section of the ''Model Audit Rule'' is most closely related to and departs from Sarbanes Oxley Section 404 (SOX 404) on Internal Control.&lt;ref name = "Sutherland" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

* Similar to SOX 404, Management (the insurer) is required to issue an internal controls assessment report.&lt;ref name = "Sutherland" /&gt;{{rp|7}}
* Departing from SOX 404, the external auditor does not attest to Managements assessment of internal controls.&lt;ref name = "Sutherland" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

'''§16(A - D)''' Which Insurers must file – generally, this report is required for large insurers, those with:
* Premiums of $500,000,000 or more (with exceptions),&lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|15}} or
* That are subject to Sarbanes Oxley section 404 (with exceptions) &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|15}}

'''No need for Duplicate Internal Control Reports'''

If an insurer is a publicly traded and subject to SOX 404, then they are already preparing an internal controls report. Therefore, the ''Model Audit Rule'' specifically states that this type of insurer “may file its or its parent’s section 404 report and an addendum in satisfaction of this §16 requirement”.&lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|15}}

The addendum is a statement by the insurer that “there are no material processes with respect to the preparation of the insurer’s or group of insurers’ audited statutory financial statements...[]... excluded from the section 404 report.” &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|15}}

'''§16(D)''' Internal Control Report Contents – Managements Report on Internal Control for statutory financial statements must include: 
* Statement that Management is Responsible for establishing and maintaining Internal Controls &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}
* Statement that Management has in-fact established internal controls over financial reporting &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}
* Statement on the effectiveness of Internal Controls (providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial statements according to statutory accounting principles) &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}
* Approach or processes regarding Managements internal control evaluation &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}
* Scope of Work regarding Management internal control evaluation &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}
* Disclosure of unremediated material weaknesses of internal control (If there is at least one, management cannot conclude that internal controls are effective) &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}
* Statement on inherent limitations of internal control &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}
* Signatures of CEO and CFO &lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}

'''§16(E)''' Management (Insurer) Supporting Activities – During an Audit or financial condition examination, the insurer must make available the basis for assertions used in evaluation of internal control.&lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}

The insurer is given the freedom (discretion) regarding: &lt;br /&gt;
* Internal control framework used,&lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}} and
* Nature and extent of documentation&lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}

The insurer has aforementioned discretion under the ''Model Audit Rule'' to achieve internal control objectives in a cost-effective manner.&lt;ref name = "MAR 205" /&gt;{{rp|16}}

'''Report and Addendum Example:''' The following is of an SEC registrant who had all Internal Controls covered in the 404 Report.

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;center&gt;'''Example Part 1 – Report – Management’s Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting&lt;ref name = "MAR 205-Guide" /&gt;{{rp|G23}}'''&lt;/center&gt;

XYZ Holding Company Inc (“XYZ”) is required to file annual reports on Form 10-K/20-F with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Each of the insurance companies listed on Attachment B is a wholly owned subsidiary of XYZ. For the purpose of XYZ’s Management’s Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has identified its “Group of insurers,” as that term is defined in [relevant state statute or Section 3H of the Model], as the insurance companies listed on Attachment B.

Management of XYZ is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over statutory financial reporting. XYZ’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting principles. Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness, as of December 31, 201X, of the Group of insurers’ internal control over statutory financial reporting, based on the framework established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework Issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment under that framework, management concluded that the Group of insurers’ internal control over statutory financial reporting is effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of statutory financial statements as of December 31, 201X.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are also subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In satisfaction of the Group of insurers’ obligation to deliver Management’s Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 201X, as permitted by [relevant state statute or Section 16C of the Model], XYZ is hereby providing the Insurance Commissioner of [domiciliary state] copies of Management’s Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting and the report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting for XYZ included in XYZ’s Form 10-K/20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 201X (or alternatively the Annual Report to Stockholders). In addition, an Addendum (Attachment A) is included to this report which identifies the material processes that were not included in the Section 404 Report (as defined in Attachment A).

Based on management review of internal controls, there were no unremediated material weaknesses as of December 31, 201X identified as part of the Group of insurers’ internal control structure over the statutory financial statements for the year ended December 31, 201X.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1313">'''''Oil Patch Hotline''''' is a semi-monthly newsletter about the oil and gas production industry in [[North Dakota]], [[Montana]], and [[Wyoming]]. It is published in [[Williston, North Dakota]]. The parent company is based out of [[Plymouth, Florida]].

Publication began in 1978 as the domestic oil industry flourished with rising energy prices. The cycle of high crude oil prices ended in the early 1980s and with it much of the oil exploration activity in the United States. As a result, the newsletter suspended publication in 1986.

Publication of ''Oil Patch Hotline'' resumed in June 2006 as worldwide energy demand generated renewed interest in domestic oil production.&lt;ref name=&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oph.hotlineprinting.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Oil Patch Hotline |access-date=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act''' (ch. 27, {{USStat|22|403}}) is a [[United States federal law]] enacted in 1883 that mandated that positions within the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] should be awarded on the basis of merit instead of political affiliation.&lt;ref name=penl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=3&amp;psid=1098|title=Digital History|website=www.digitalhistory.uh.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act provided selection of government employees by competitive exams,&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt; rather than ties to politicians or political affiliation. It also made it illegal to fire or demote government officials for political reasons and prohibited soliciting campaign donations on Federal government property.&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt; To enforce the merit system and the judicial system, the law also created the [[United States Civil Service Commission]].&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt; This board would be in charge of determining the rules and regulations of the act.&lt;ref name=CS2014 /&gt; The act also allowed for the president, by executive order, to decide which positions would be subject to the act and which would not.&lt;ref name=CS2014 /&gt; A result was the shift of the parties to reliance on funding from business,&lt;ref name=Tragedy&gt;{{cite book|last=Quigley|first=Carroll|title=Tragedy and Hope: A History of the World in Our Time|year=1966|publisher=Macmillan Co.|location=San Pedro, CA|isbn=094500110X|pages=71|url=https://www.amazon.com/Tragedy-Hope-History-World-Time/dp/094500110X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347944945&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=tragedy+and+hope}}&lt;/ref&gt; since they could no longer depend on patronage.

== History ==
In 1877, there was growing interest in the United States concerning the effects of the [[spoils system]] on the American political system.&lt;ref name=CS2014 /&gt; [[New York City]] established the Civil Service Reform Association to help address the issues, which would lead to several other organizations like it appearing in other cities.&lt;ref name=CS2014&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil Service 2014|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=0a1a74b1-da5a-4d83-9d8d-68f2d4ebbdca%40sessionmgr110&amp;hid=120&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=funk&amp;AN=CI149100|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of these organizations was one of the first steps in trying to up end the spoils system in America.

The [[assassination of James A. Garfield|assassination]] of President [[James A. Garfield]] moved the Civil Service Reform from city organizations to a leading topic in the political realm.&lt;ref name=CS2014 /&gt;  President Garfield was shot in July 1881 by [[Charles Guiteau]], because Guiteau believed the president owed him a patronage position for his "vital assistance" in securing [[United States presidential election, 1880|Garfield's election]] the previous year.&lt;ref name=TAP&gt;{{cite web|title=Life and Death in the White House|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/presidency/3d1d.html|website=The American Presidency|publisher=Smithsonian Natural Museum of American History|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garfield died two months later, and Vice President [[Chester A. Arthur]] acceded to the presidency.&lt;ref name=Study&gt;{{cite web|title=Gilded Age Politics: Political Machines &amp; Civil Service Reform|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/gilded-age-politics-political-machines-civil-service-reform.html|website=Study.Com|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once in office, President Arthur pushed through legislation for civil reform.&lt;ref name=Study /&gt;

On January 16, 1883 Congress passed the Civil Service Act, which is sometimes referred to as the Pendleton Act after Senator [[George H. Pendleton]] of [[Ohio]],&lt;ref name=CS2014 /&gt; one of the primary sponsors. The Act was written by [[Dorman Bridgman Eaton]], a staunch opponent of the patronage system who was later first chairman of the [[United States Civil Service Commission]].  However, the law would also prove to be a major political liability for Arthur.&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt;  The law offended [[Political machine|machine politicians]], or politicians who belong to a small clique that controls a political party.&lt;ref name=TFD&gt;{{cite web|title=Machine Politician|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/machine+politician|website=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These politicians realized that with the Pendleton Act in place they would have to find a new means of income, since they could no longer count on donations from the wealthy hoping to receive jobs.&lt;ref name=Study /&gt;

The Act initially covered only about 10% of the U.S. government's civilian employees.&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt;  However, there was a provision that allowed outgoing presidents to lock in their own appointees by converting jobs to civil service. After a series of party reversals at the presidential level (1884, 1888, 1892, 1896), the result was that most federal jobs were under civil service.

After being confirmed by a Senate vote of 97–1, she became the 38th person to hold that position.

Pritzker spent her early career in business. She worked her way up through the [[Pritzker family]] business, eventually being appointed as one of three successors to her uncle, [[Jay Pritzker]]. She is the founder of PSP Capital Partners and Pritzker Realty Group. She is also co-founder of Artemis Real Estate Partners. As of October 2015, ''[[Forbes]]'' estimated her net worth at [[United States dollar|$]]2.4 billion.&lt;ref name="forbes1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Penny Prtizker|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/penny-pritzker/|website=Forbes|deadurl=no|accessdate=December 2, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206014741/http://www.forbes.com/profile/penny-pritzker/|archivedate=December 6, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Forbes named Pritzker one of the 100 most powerful women in the world.

Before entering government service, Pritzker had been involved in many [[Chicago]] organizations, including the [[Chicago Board of Education]], [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago]], and her own foundation, the Pritzker Traubert Family Foundation. Pritzker was an early supporter of Obama's presidential candidacy, having been a friend of the Obama family since their time in Chicago.

Young Penny would accompany her father to the hotels and check the cleanliness of the ladies restrooms. In 1972, Don died suddenly of a heart attack when Penny was 13{{nbsp}}years old. Following Don's death, Sue began battling depression, requiring Penny to at times care for her mother and her younger brothers.&lt;ref name="Easton, Nina, The fascinating life" /&gt; At age 16, Penny wrote a letter to her grandfather, and head of the family business empire, [[Abram Nicholas Pritzker|A.]]{{nbsp}}[[Abram Nicholas Pritzker|N.

The Pritzker business empire contained over 200 businesses and was valued at $15{{nbsp}}billion.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

After Jay Pritzker's death in 1999, other Pritzker family members challenged Tom, Nick, and Penny's control of the businesses in multiple lawsuits.&lt;ref name="Easton, Nina, The fascinating life" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/184547 The Economist: "Jay Pritzker, pioneer of the modern hotel chain, died on January 23rd, aged 76"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703045039/http://www.economist.com/node/184547 |date=July 3, 2013 }} January 28, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Penny's brothers joined in one of the lawsuits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8301">'''Retail concentration''' refers to the [[Market share|market-share]] generally belonging to the top 4 or 5 mass distribution firms present in a regional market, as a percentage of the total.

Retail concentration is not simply a [[concentration ratio]] as is emerging in the food sector. This is due to two factors: the particular relevance retail is gaining on a global scale, and the particular shape of the food supply chain.

In recent years, Retail Concentration moved ahead with fusions and acquisitions&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capgemini.com/resources/news/consumers_drive_food_industry_transformation__global_brands_retail_formats_consolidation__says_new_report/{{broken citation|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; along the entire food supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mcb/070/2004/00000106/00000008/art00004 |title=Increasing retail concentration: Evidence from the UK food retail |publisher=British Food Journal vol. 106 |year=2004 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; We can assume with Grievink (2003) that in a few years there will be only 5 dominant actors in the globalised food chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodinternational.net/articles/efi%2Dspecial/1249/state%2Dof%2Dthe%2Dart%2Din%2Dfood%2Ehtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204235802/http://www.foodinternational.net/articles/efi-special/1249/state-of-the-art-in-food.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 4, 2008 |accessdate=December 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same researcher states that in the 90's the top-5 food manufacturers could count on twice the [[cash flow]] of the top-5 retailers. Nowadays the relation is inverted: the top 5 retailers can count on twice that of the top-5 manufacturers.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Thus, the food chain has become increasingly [[Vertical integration|vertically integrated]], with global corporations able to coordinate inputs from the seed to the field, from the stable to the table. Retail concentration by one hand is the answer that retail is giving to compete with the giants of agrofood industry. By the other hand, is the agrofood industry in itself searching to arrive directly to the consumers, through a refined relations system. In this process, private labels are increasingly attracting consumers, and are expected to grow more and more on their fidelisation strategy, beating on quality, safety and also ethical values.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foodinternational.net/articles/efi-special/583/private-labels-why-europe-is-leading-the-pack.html  {{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently the [[European Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/thematic_articles/article13524_en.htm {{broken citation|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed solutions to face with overall price increase about foodstuff. Among the measures proposed, several relate to the retail power recently acquired.

In particular, the payments delay to the producers; the additional fees asked to the producers to place on the shelves branded products; price transparency; [[better regulation]] on promotional activities and openings/closing time are all issues on the agenda.

For supporters, retail concentration means more chances for consumers, lower prices, better quality. For opponents, by the contrary, the disappearing of traditional shops, of food culture, of neighborhood life in general.&lt;ref&gt;International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and [[Physical exercise|Physical Activity]], 2006 3: 33 “Understanding environmental influences on nutrition and physical activity behaviors: where should we look and what should we count?”, Kylie Ball, Anna F Timperio and David A Crawford&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, too much concentration means squeezing the price of industry and of agriculture, which can lead to outsourcing food from anywhere it can cost less, without a truly long term impact assessment.

Tim Lang (Food Wars, Earthscan London 2004) described the retail concentration phenomenon such as a "food war", in which winners and losers take place. Tim Lang talks about "food clusters" ([p.&amp;nbsp;84]) to better handle the idea of concentration along the entire food chain.
There are a lot of legal instruments which allow to get more and more concentrated.
Acquisition being the first one, follow mergers, [[joint venture]]s, partnerships and more not formalised contracts/ agreements.
Note that the "hypermarketization" is not limited to the [[Western world|Western World]], but supermarkets rise fast also in the [[Developing country|less developed countries]] and in the East and in the South of the World.
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chowdhury|first=Shyamal|author2=Ashok Gulati |author3=E. Gumbira Sa'id |title=The Rise of Supermarkets and Vertical Relationships in the Indonesian Food Value Chain|journal=Asian Journal of Agriculture and Development|date=June–December 2005|volume=2|issue=1 &amp; 2|url=http://www.searca.org/ajad/archives/v-02/01-02/ajad_v2_n1_n2_chowdhury_etal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Regarding that, there are a lot of concerns, pretending that the overwhelming power of retailing is making poorer and poorer farmers, in particular in the LDC (Less Developed Countries).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agobservatory.org/library.cfm?RefID=46604 {{dead link|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "crowding out" effect on local agricultures it is basically due to the global sourcing of the produces, wherever they cost less and offer more. To say it with the words of the Italian food-thinker Corrado Finardi to fairly function, the agricultural system has a different, slower timeline than the market (in agriculture counts the long term investment, while on the [[Globalization|global market]] it is more important the precise moment in which [[supply and demand]] match).

'''Market concentration (considering the upper and lower tails)'''
A more refined form, which calculates the percentage of last 4/ competitors on the first 4/5. 
Eve in its static version, it measures the level of competition in the sector. 
A diachronic comparison allows for even more insights.
 
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
'''Herfindahl Hirschman Index'''
This index is used in Europe and in the USA for antitrust regulatory purposes, in order to assess the feasibility of mergers and acquisitions.
The HHI is calculated as the relative frequencies squared and summed, comprehensive of all actors in the playfield. So far, it gives more importance to biggest player in proportion. 
Even if interesting, a HHI, often wrongly assess the real behaviours on the field.
Consider, for the comparison sake, the retail concentration in Europe. Top 5 retail distributors account for the 70% of the market share. Even if apparently it gives the idea of a highly concentrated market, the HHI does not allow for that conclusion in most of the cases. 
Following 3 different scenarios, we explored the relative market shares of the single actors.
1 scenario: 1= 19%, 2=15%, 3=14%, 4= 12%, 5=10% (total=70% for the top 5), remaining= 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 7%, 9%.
In this first case, where there is a linear distribution of market share among players, the HHI scores at 0,121 (considered a moderate concentration indicator)

2 scenario: 14% *5 (top 5 players =70%, having equal market share), the remaining, each equalling 3% (3%*10). In this second case, the HHI scores an 0,098, which stands for an unconcentrated market at all. We can deliberately make some reflections on that, since the HHI seems not taking into account opportunistic behaviours in the direction of oligopoly. It is assumed that, because of the equal market power of the top 5 actors, they are going to compete (even if history shows that more probably they find some form of implicit agreement…). Standardised from 0 to 1, the value is 0,033571429 (very low…).

3 scenario. First player= 20%, followers 12%, then 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 4% and the last 10 each 3%.
In this case the HHI is 0,0944 (not concentrated market, even if not highly competitive environment). Standardised from 0 to 1, the value is 0,0378 (very low…).

Even in a case where there is one leading competitor which “makes the market” as in the 3rd scenario, the HHI stays relatively low.

'''Structuring''', also known as '''smurfing''' in [[banking industry|banking]] [[jargon]], is the practice of executing [[financial transaction]]s such as making bank deposits in a specific pattern, calculated to avoid triggering [[financial institution]]s to file reports required by law, such as the United States' [[Bank Secrecy Act]] (BSA) and [[Internal Revenue Code]] section 6050I (relating to the requirement to file Form 8300). Structuring may be done in the context of [[money laundering]], [[fraud]], and other [[financial crime]]s. Legal restrictions on structuring are concerned with limiting the size of domestic transactions for individuals.

==Definition==
Structuring is the act of parceling what would otherwise be a large financial transaction into a series of smaller transactions to avoid scrutiny by regulators and law enforcement.&lt;ref name="linn"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Linn|first1=Courtney J.|title=Redefining the Bank Secrecy Act: Currency Reporting and the Crime of Structuring|journal=Santa Clara Law Review|date=2010|volume=50|issue=2|pages=407–513|url=http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1058&amp;context=lawreview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically each of the smaller transactions is executed in an amount below some statutory limit that normally does not require a [[financial institution]] to file a report with a government agency. Criminal enterprises may employ several [[agent (law)|agents]] ("smurfs") to make the transaction.{{cn|date=March 2017}} Structuring appears in federal indictments related to [[money laundering]], [[fraud]], and other [[financial crime]]s.

The term "smurfing" is derived from the image of the comic book characters, [[the Smurfs]], having a large group of many small entities. Miami-based lawyer Gregory Baldwin is said to have coined the term in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author1=Gross, Samantha | author2=Barrett, Devlin | title=Spitzer Tripped Up on Laws He Enforced | url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Mar11/0,4670,SpitzerTheMoneyTrail,00.html | work=Fox News | date=11 March 2008 | accessdate=2008-03-14 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322064115/http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Mar11/0,4670,SpitzerTheMoneyTrail,00.html | archivedate=22 March 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==
Legal restrictions on structuring are concerned with limiting the size of domestic transactions for individuals, and somewhat limiting the outbound foreign currency transfers of firms or company entities.{{cn|date=March 2008}} This should not be confused with [[capital controls]], which are regulatory limits on the money that one can take out of a nation and generally regulate how much money can leave a country at any given time.{{cn|date=March 2017}} Both can have some of the same economic effects in some economies, as structuring controls effectively limit the flow of capital by magnitude and duration, and can apply equally to taking money out of a nation as well as putting money into its financial system.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the [[Bank Secrecy Act]] requires [[currency transaction report]]s (CTRs) to be filed for transactions valued at more than $10,000; it applies to both U.S. and foreign currencies.&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{usc|31|5313}}, {{usc|31|5324}}, 31 C.F.R. sec. 1010.311, and 31 C.F.R. sec. 1010.314.&lt;/ref&gt; Financial institutions suspecting deposit structuring with intent to avoid the law are required to file a [[suspicious activity report]] (SAR).&lt;ref&gt;See generally 31 C.F.R. sec. 1010.320.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the [[U.S. Congress]] enacted section 5324 of Title 31 of the [[United States Code]],&lt;ref&gt;See section 1354(a) of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Public Law No. 99-570, 100 Stat. 3207, at 3207-22 (27 Oct. 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; which provides (in part):

&lt;blockquote&gt;No person shall, for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements of section 5313 (a) or 5325 or any regulation prescribed under any such section, the reporting or record keeping requirements imposed by any order issued under section 5326, or the record keeping requirements imposed by any regulation prescribed under section 21 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or section 123 of Public Law 91–508—[...]

(3) structure or assist in structuring, or attempt to structure or assist in structuring, any transaction with one or more domestic financial institutions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section 5324 further provides that a violation of this provision may be punished by a fine or up to five years in prison, or both.&lt;ref&gt;See 31 USC section 5324(d)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; The filing of Form 8300 is required under [[Internal Revenue Code]] section 6050I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Internal Revenue Service | chapter=Part IV Examining Process; Chapter 26 Bank Secrecy Act; Section 13 Structuring | title=Internal Revenue Manual | location=Washington, D.C. | publisher=US Treasury Department | url=https://www.irs.gov/irm/index.html | chapterurl=https://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/ch25s17.html | date=2006-06-01 | oclc=37305546 | accessdate=2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sums of money resulting from deposits of less than $10,000 may be seized after a warrant is issued based on a [[suspicious activity report]]. Legal proceedings, which may cost in the vicinity of $20,000 or more, may be required for an innocent party to retrieve his or her money. Reports in October 2014 by ''[[The New York Times]]'' of arbitrary seizures resulted in modification of [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) practice to focus on investigations that "closely align" with IRS "mission and key priorities". Banks are not permitted to warn or advise customers unless the customer asks, but sometimes bank tellers will informally warn customers.&lt;ref name = NYT102514 &gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/us/law-lets-irs-seize-accounts-on-suspicion-no-crime-required.html "Law Lets I.R.S. Seize Accounts on Suspicion, No Crime Required"] article by Sahaila Dewan in ''[[The New York Times]]'' 25 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Cook Islands has "Home Rule" with respect to banking. Cook Islands [[automated teller machine]]s often fail to fully disclose the fact that the Cooks have their own structuring regulations and are not part of the New Zealand banking system.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

==Other uses==
The term "smurfing" is also applied to activity associated with [[controlled substance]]s such as [[pseudoephedrine]].&lt;ref name="justice.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/dea/concern/18862/ndic_2009.pdf |format=PDF |title=DEA |page=16 |publisher=Justice.gov |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017093604/http://www.justice.gov/dea/concern/18862/ndic_2009.pdf |archivedate=17 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context the agent will make purchases of small, legal amounts from several drug and grocery stores, with the intent to aggregate the lot for use in the illegal production of [[methamphetamine]].&lt;ref name="justice.gov"/&gt;  Also, since the monthly [[pseudoephedrine]] purchase limits in US are too low for mass meth production, this practice often involves using multiple "smurfs".

As Robert Pennal of the Fresno Meth Task Force explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Then we started seeing "smurfing." Remember how the smurfs were little gatherers? We started getting calls from different retail stores that people were buying two or three packs — that's the most you can buy — and they went to one store, they bought three, they went to another store, bought three. We're seeing [[blister packs]] everywhere because they're sitting in the car, they're punching the pills out of the blister packs, they're putting them in the freezer bags and they're turning them over to chemical brokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/meth/etc/script.html|title=Transcript - The Meth Epidemic - FRONTLINE - PBS|work=FRONTLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Political positions==
Since at least 2015 the SJM has been critical of [[foreign direct investment]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstpost.com/business/rss-affiliated-swadeshi-jagaran-manch-opposes-fdi-in-single-brand-retail-foreign-investment-in-air-india-4298843.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/we-want-a-white-paper-on-costs-and-benefits-of-fdi/293538&lt;/ref&gt;

The SJM advocates the use of freshly cooked food to fight malnutrition, in preference to ready to use [[therapeutic foods]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/sjm-wants-fresh-cooked-food-to-fight-malnutrition-in-kids/1130646&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Halal Guys''' is a [[halal]] [[fast casual restaurant]] [[Franchising|franchise]] that began as a [[food cart]] on the south-east corner of [[53rd Street (Manhattan)|53rd Street]] and [[Sixth Avenue]] in the [[Boroughs of New York City|borough]] of [[Manhattan]] in New York City. The franchise also has a cart on the south-west corner of the same intersection.  New locations, both food cart and storefront, are being added throughout New York (including a storefront on [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]] and [[Second Avenue (Manhattan)|Second Avenue]]) and around the world.

The [[Franchising|franchise]] is most recognized by its primary dish which is a platter of chicken or [[gyro (food)|gyro]] meat with rice,&lt;ref name=home&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.53rdand6th.com/|title=We Are Different|website=53rdand6th.com|accessdate=March 4, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305133246/http://www.53rdand6th.com/#|archive-date=2009-03-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it also serves a chicken or gyro wrap sandwich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://midtownlunch.com/blog/2007/05/03/ask-midtown-lunch-best-chicken-and-rice-cart/|title=Ask Midtown Lunch: Best Chicken and Rice Cart|publisher=Midtown Lunch|accessdate=March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=home/&gt;&lt;ref name=DotD&gt;{{cite news|author=Saki Knafo|date=July 29, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/nyregion/thecity/29hala.html?ref=thecity|title=Decline of the Dog|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Halal Guys was founded in 1990 by Egyptian-descendent Mohamed Abouelenein,&lt;ref name="Vadukul 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Vadukul | first=Alex | title=The Halal Guys: Cashing In on Street Cred |work=[[The New York Times]]| date=2014-06-15 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/nyregion/the-halal-guys-cashing-in-on-street-cred.html | access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with compatriots Ahmed Elsaka and Abdelbaset Elsayed, as a [[hot dog cart]] located on 53rd Street and Sixth Avenue.&lt;ref name=DotD/&gt;&lt;ref name=restaurant&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/halal-guys-food-cart-open-restaurant-east-village-article-1.1474330|title=Halal Guys food cart to open restaurant in East Village|author=Carol Kuruvilla|date=2013-10-02|work=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abouelenein, however, believed that a hot dog was not a satisfying meal, and switched to the current menu of chicken, gyro meat, rice, and pita in 1992.&lt;ref name=DotD/&gt; As a result, New York City’s [[Muslim]] cab drivers flocked to the cart for its ability to provide a quick, relatively inexpensive halal meal. As word of the cart spread via these chatty cabbies, the now-famous platter of chicken and rice was born, and popularized within the Muslim community in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thehalalguys.com/our-story/|title=Our Story {{!}} The Halal Guys|website=thehalalguys.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food cart|cart]] has caused a decline in the popularity of hot dog vendors in New York City and has influenced many imitation carts.&lt;ref name=DotD/&gt; A cart called 'New York's Best Halal Food' is also located on 53rd Street and Sixth Avenue on the southwest corner. It is unknown which cart was located at the intersection first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2012/10/best-halal-cart-53rd-street-6th-avenue-street-food.html|title=Taste Test: The 53rd and 6th Halal Street Food Showdown|publisher=[[Serious Eats]]|author=Max Falkowitz|accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2006, a fight that started in line ended with 23-year-old Ziad Tayeh stabbing and killing 19-year-old Tyrone Gibbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jen Chung|url=http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/10/29/street_food_sta.php|title=Street Food Stabbing|publisher=[[Gothamist]]|date=2006-10-29|accessdate=2009-03-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201232209/http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2006/10/29/street_food_sta.php|archivedate=2008-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tayeh was later found not guilty, as the jury found that he acted in self-defense.  The fight began after one accused the other of [[cutting in line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shayna Jacobs|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/whack-smack-article-1.1326492|title=Brooklyn man who beat 2009 murder rap for killing line cutter arrested for heroin possession|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=2013-04-24|accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' once reported that the owners had hired [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]].&lt;ref name=DotD/&gt;

==Franchising==
[[File:The Halal Guys at Springfield Plaza, interior.jpg|thumb|Interior of a franchise in Springfield, Virginia, in June 2018]]
After being approached numerous times, holding off franchising to await a company that would respect their origins and core values, the Halal Guys hired [[Fransmart]], the [[Franchising|franchise]] development company behind the success and explosive growth of [[Qdoba Mexican Grill]] and [[Five Guys]], in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.salaamgateway.com/en/story/interviewits_a_halal_guys_world_new_york_citys_favorite_food_cart_goes_global-salaam28032016071518/|title=INTERVIEW-It’s a Halal Guys’ world: New York City’s favorite food cart goes global|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the first year of launching their franchise expansion campaign they closed deals for California; New Jersey; Connecticut; Virginia; Washington, DC; Houston and Austin, Texas ; Chicago, Illinois, as well as international deals for Canada, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcasual.com/news/the-halal-guys-inks-5-unit-deal-for-toronto/|title=The Halal Guys inks 5-unit deal for Toronto|work=www.fastcasual.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In total this represents over 200 locations under development.

Despite initial concern that the company’s name or its association with [[Islamic culture|Muslim culture]] wouldn’t sit well with many Americans, [[Fransmart]] CEO Dan Rowe said that he has confidence in the company, and envisions that ”by the time they’re in Chattanooga, there will be so much good buzz, they’ll be excited to try it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/nyregion/the-halal-guys-cashing-in-on-street-cred.html|title=The Halal Guys: Cashing In on Street Cred|date=2014-06-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In 2005, Chicken and Rice was one of four finalists for the "Vendy Award" presented by a New York City street vendor advocacy group known as the Street Vendor Project. Chicken and Rice eventually lost out to Rolf Babiel from [[Hallo Berlin]], a sausage cart on 54th and 5th.&lt;ref name=StreetVendor&gt;{{cite web|url=http://streetvendor.org/vendys/past-winners/nyc/|title=Vendy Awards Past Winners|accessdate=2014-02-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217112628/http://streetvendor.org/vendys/past-winners/nyc/#|archive-date=2013-12-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/11/nyregion/11vendors.html?pagewanted=print|title=In a Battle of Street-Food Vendors, the Wurst Wins|date=2005-11-11|author=Dana Bowen|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the popularity of the cart has been further aided by high-profile customers. Chef Christopher Lee, who was one of [[Food &amp; Wine Magazine]]'s best new chefs of 2006, mentioned in an interview with the magazine that he "can't stay away from it" and once was there on Christmas Eve waiting two and a half hours in the cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.foodandwine.com/articles/interview-christopher-lee|title=Interview with Best New Chef Christopher Lee|publisher=[[Food &amp; Wine]]|accessdate=March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cart has since become a prominent cuisine throughout New York City and has been heard as far as [[Hawaii]]. It has caused an increase in competition among street meat carts in [[Midtown Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-268850022.html|title=The Halal Guys|publisher=Islamic Business &amp; Finance|date=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/dining/03lunch.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|title=A Tour Guide Tames Lunch in Midtown|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2009-06-02|author=Julia Moskin|accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lines commonly grow to over an hour's wait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michelle-won/halal-chicken-rice-recipe_b_870318.html|title=Making NYC Street Meat: Chicken and Rice Recipe|author=Michelle Won|date=2011-06-02|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a student club at [[New York University]] dedicated to the food cart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Yang |first=Emily |url=http://nyunews.com/news/2010/10/13/14club/ |title=Chicken, rice and a side of culture|work=[[Washington Square News]]|date= |accessdate=May 6, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725093036/http://nyunews.com/news/2010/10/13/14club/ |archivedate=July 25, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Halal Guys was awarded the 2014 Multicultural Award by the American Muslim Consumer Consortium for their promotion of diversity and multiculturalism, and their inclusivity to all minorities in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/laila-alawa/what-is-it-with-that-whit_b_6158254.html|title=What Is it With That White Sauce?|last=Alawa|first=Laila|date=2014-11-14|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thierry Breton''' (born 15 January 1955 in [[Paris]]) is a French businessman, a former [[Professor]] at [[Harvard Business School]], and a former [[Finance minister]] of [[France]].  He has been Vice Chairman and CEO of [[Groupe Bull]], Chairman and CEO of [[Technicolor SA|Thomson-RCA]] (1997–2002), Chairman and CEO of [[France Télécom]] (2002–2005).

Today an Honorary Chairman of both Thomson and France Telecom, he is, since 2008, Chairman and CEO of international information technology services company [[Atos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/atos/ |title= Atos on Forbes Global 2000 list |date= May 2015 |website= Forbes |access-date= 21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was from 2005 to 2007 the French [[Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry (France)|Minister of Economy, Finance and Industry]] in the governments of Prime Ministers [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] and [[Dominique de Villepin]], [[Jacques Chirac]] being the President de la Republique.

==Early life &amp; education==
Born in the [[14th arrondissement of Paris]], Thierry Breton completed his middle and high school education at the ''Ecole alsacienne'' in Paris and [[University-preparatory school]] classes for the [[Grandes écoles]] at [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]]. He received a master's degree in [[Electrical Engineering]] and [[Computer Science]] from [[École Supérieure d'Électricité]] (Supélec, now [[CentraleSupélec]]) in 1979 and later graduated from the ''Institut des hautes études de défense nationale'' ([[IHEDN]]).&lt;ref name="Who's Who"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whoswho.fr/bio/thierry-breton_23519 |title=Biography of Thierry Breton |language= French |date=26 March 2015 |website=https://www.whoswho.fr/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manager==
Thierry Breton began his career in 1979 as a professor of IT and Mathematics at the [[Lycée Français de New York]] as part of his military service through cooperation.&lt;ref name="Reference for Business"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/biography/A-E/Breton-Thierry-1955.html |title= Biography of Thierry Breton |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= Reference For Business |publisher= |access-date= 21 June 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 he created ''Forma Systems'', a systems-analysis and software-engineering company of which he became CEO until 1986.&lt;ref name = "Reference for Business"/&gt; He became that year adviser to the French Ministry of Education and Research [[René Monory]] and designed open-air science and technology theme park [[Futuroscope]]. From 1990 to 1993, he was managing director of [[CGI Group]], a global information technology company.&lt;ref name = "Reference for Business"/&gt;

===Groupe Bull===
In 1993, the French government hired Thierry Breton to help turn around troubled national computer maker [[Groupe Bull]]. As second in command, he managed to restructure the stock-market listed company and became in 1996 Vice-President of the Board of Directors. He is widely credited with pulling Bull from the edge of bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Breton new CEO of France Telecom |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/BUSINESS/10/02/ftel/index.html |journal=CNN.com |location=Atlanta |publisher=CNN News Group |date=2 October 2002 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

18 years later - in August 2014 - he became President of the Board of Directors following the company's acquisition by Atos.

===Thomson===
In 1997, the French government named Thierry Breton chairman and CEO of Thomson Multimedia, a state-owned consumer-electronics company that was on the verge of collapse. A year before France's prime minister [[Alain Juppé]] unsuccessfully tried to sell the company to South Korea–based Daewoo for a single franc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Is It Too Late For Thomson? |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/1997-08-24/is-it-too-late-for-thomson-intl-edition |journal=Businessweek Archives |location= |publisher= |date=24 August 1997 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thierry Breton made stock offerings in order to generate cash and diversified the company's businesses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Acquisition of Technicolor Will Boost Thomson Profit |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/30/local/me-18802 |journal=Los Angeles Times|location= |publisher= |date= 30 January 2001 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; figuring that consumer-electronics products were not high-end enough to consistently earn profits over the long term. Breton involved Thomson in interactive television, electronic publishing, and the Internet, as well as the higher-margin business of digital film-editing services. Thomson began manufacturing televisions with built-in software to run the electronic reference.

Thomson's new ventures instilled investors with renewed confidence in the company and allowed Thierry Breton to attract bigname companies such as [[Microsoft]], [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]], [[NEC]], and the [[DirecTV]] division of Hughes Electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Thomson Multimedia Finds Friends With Deep Pockets |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/01/business/international-business-thomson-multimedia-finds-friends-with-deep-pockets.html |journal=New York Times|location= |publisher= |date= 1 August 1998 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1999 Thomson was turning a $230 million profit on sales of $6.5 billion. By the time Breton left in 2002, revenues had increased by more than 80 percent and Thomson was outperforming [[Sony]], [[Matsushita]], and [[Philips]], its major consumer-electronics competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Thomson CEO Is Rare For a French Tech Chief |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1026678691908408840 |journal=The Wall Street Journal|location= |publisher= |date= 15 July 2002 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widely acclaimed as a ''Turnaround whiz''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Turnaround Whiz Breton Shakes Up France Telecom |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1040073507228936753 |journal=Wall Street Journal |location= |publisher= |date=18 December 2002 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The Best European Performers |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2003-07-27/the-best-european-performers |journal=Bloomberg Business Magazine |location= |publisher= |date=27 July 2003 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thierry Breton was named by French government as head of multinational telecommunications corporation [[France Télécom]] on 2 October 2002.

In the past year, the company's share price had fallen about 70% while debts have ballooned to 60 billion euros ($54bn). A risky acquisition strategy that included mobile phone operator [[Orange (telecommunications)|Orange]], data carrier [[Equant]] and Internet service provider (ISP) [[Freeserve]] as well as several new, third-generation mobile phone licences had left France Telecom with the infamous title of the ''world's most indebted listed company''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=France Telecom: Battling debt |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1268527.stm |journal=Wall BBC News |location= |publisher= |date=19 April 2001 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time Thierry Breton took over share prices were worth less than 7 euros. Two months after his arrival these share prices had risen by 170%. He launched ''Ambition FT 2005'' and generated a three-tiered plan that called for cutting costs to increase cash flow, refinancing debt, and generating $16 billion from shareholders through a capital increase, all in efforts to save $30 billion over three years&lt;ref name="Reference for Business"/&gt;

The operator was simultaneously facing an intensification of the competition in its long time market of France, as well as a demand from the [[ARCEP]] to unbundle [[ADSL]]. As a response to these challenges Thierry Breton notably ended [[Orange (telecommunications)|Orange]]’s venture on the stock market and took back complete control over the subsidiary and its earnings.

In July 2003 he launched the plan ''Broadband internet for all'' with the objective of providing broadband to 90% of the French population. To do this he increased spending in the innovation sector by 20% and launched the charter ''Innovative Departments'' to speed up the development of broadband in rural areas. The following year the company recorded more than 7000 patents filed in France and abroad. In the same year France Télécom reintegrated with [[Wanadoo]] in order to integrate fixed telephony and [[service provider]] activities. In July 2004 Breton announced the launch of [[Livebox]], the operator's first [[Triple play (telecommunications)|Triple Play]] offer and France Télécom would become the first organisation to implement the concept of ''integrated operator''.

In September 2004 the French government finalised the privatisation of France Télécom on which it had been working progressively since 1996.  However, in accordance with the law of 31 December 2003 proposed and supported by Thierry Breton, the specific status of the employees was maintained. 
 
When he left the company for the Ministry of the Economy in February 2005 the share price was 23 euros. In less than three years the company’s debt was reduced to less than 40 billion euros. He was named as Honorary President of France Télécom.&lt;ref name="Who's Who"/&gt;

In January 2010 the ''Harvard Business Review'' first published a list of ''The 100 Best-Performing CEOs in the World'' which was based on an academic study comparing the performances of the heads of industry of the 2,000 biggest global companies, in their relevant fields, from 1995 to 2009. Thierry Breton held the 62nd position for his term as CEO of France Télécom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lib.uwo.ca/news/business/2010/01/09/bestperformingceosintheworld.html |title=Best Performing CEOs in the World |access-date=21 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621213606/https://www.lib.uwo.ca/news/business/2010/01/09/bestperformingceosintheworld.html |archivedate=21 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atos===
After two years of government service (2005-2007) he became in November 2008 the active chairman and CEO of [[Atos|Atos S.A.]], formerly Atos Origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chassany|first=Anne-Sylvaine|title=Atos Origin Board Fires Chief Germond, Hires Breton|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aOpHCL50TOTA|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=29 February 2012|date=17 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the announcement of his nomination the share price, which was previously valued at 18 euros, rose by 7.84%.

In 2008 Atos generated a sales revenue of 5.5 billion euros with a headcount of 50,000 employees but according to Thierry Breton was "managed too compartmentally" and the company’s inferior profitability margins compared to those of its competitors required a complete transformation plan.

In July 2011 he orchestrated the acquisition of the IT activities of German industry group [[Siemens]] which allowed the company to rank number one among the European IT services players and in the Top 5 worldwide, with 75 000 employees in 42 countries. The deal, valued at €850m ($1.1bn), was the biggest Franco-German transaction since an alliance between Germany’s premium carmaker [[Daimler AG|Daimler]] and France’s [[Renault]] early this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Siemens strikes tie-up deal with Atos |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/6ad4362c-07ca-11e0-a568-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3dh1zpbLy |journal=FT |location= |publisher= |date=14 December 2010 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation was lauded by the financial markets and the Atos share price rose by 11.6%.

With the integration of 28,000 engineers Atos became one of the most important Franco-German industrial collaborations since [[Airbus]], illustrated particularly by a financial partnership (Siemens took 15% of Atos’ capital), and a common investment fund of 100 million euros was created as well as a joint response to international tenders. This strategy was awarded the prize for ''Industrial cooperation'' by the Franco-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

In 2012 Thierry Breton adopted the [[Societas Europaea]] for Atos which gave the company two headquarters, one in France and a second in Munich, Germany.  Furthermore, he participated in other European institutional projects in which the Franco-German partnership played a central role such as the [[European Commission]]’s European Cloud Partnership (2012-2014) over which he co-presided with Jim Snabe, the co-CEO of the German world leader in software [[SAP SE|SAP]].

In May 2014 Thierry Breton launched a friendly takeover on French historic IT industry player Bull, turning Atos into the number one European company and one of the major global players in [[Big Data]] and [[Cybersecurity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Atos Takes Control of French Rival Bull |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/atos-takes-control-of-french-rival-bull-1408516048 |journal=Wall Street Journal|location= |publisher= |date=20 August 2014 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This acquisition, again commended by the markets (Atos’ share price rose by 6.2% and Bull’s by 21.9% the day of the announcement) notably allowed the company to position itself in the [[Supercomputing]] segment and to become the sole only European manufacturer.

Six months later he announced Atos’ acquisition of [[Xerox]]’s IT outsourcing activities as well as a strategic partnership with the American company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=French Computer-Services Company Atos to Buy Xerox’s IT Outsourcing Unit |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/french-computer-services-company-atos-to-buy-xeroxs-it-outsourcing-unit-1418949455 |journal=Wall Street Journal |location= |publisher= |date=19 December 2014 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This operation, which was viewed favorably by the Stock Market, made Atos one of the five largest digital companies in the world. The company had doubled in size within six years with a headcount of around 100,000 employees.

Thierry Breton got World attention after an interview with the [[Wall Street Journal]] in 2011 when he reiterated his intention to ban internal Email, dubbed as "the pollution of the information age", at Atos within 18 months (known as the [[Zero-Email Strategy]]), replacing internal emails by a set of Enterprise Social Networks, Enterprise Instant Messaging, Collaborative tools etc..., both being developed inhouse and partially aggregated from other vendors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Colchester|first1=Max|last2=Amiel|first2=Geraldine|title=The IT Boss Who Shuns Email|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204452104577060103165399154?mod=googlenews_wsj|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=5 December 2011|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 he was elected ''Strategist of the Year'' by French financial newspaper [[Les Échos (France)|Les Echos]] for his management of Atos.

In May 2015 the company’s market capitalization rose to 7.29 billion euros, an increase of more than 5 billion euros compared with November 2008 when Thierry Breton took over office. The market share price of Atos grew by 268% in five years.

==Minister of Finance==
Having already been proposed twice to succeed [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] as Finance Minister, Thierry Breton was appointed on 24 February 2005, replacing [[Hervé Gaymard]],.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=de Beaupuy|first1=Francois|last2=Vandore|first2=Emma|title=Chirac Names France Telecom's Breton as New Finance Minister|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aOOf4zt1fvbQ&amp;refer=europe|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=29 February 2012|date=25 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his two and a half years at the head of Bercy he centred his economic policy on the need to reform [[public finances]], specifically in order to reduce debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Paris rediscovers fiscal discipline |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b132c504-4cfb-11db-b03c-0000779e2340.html#axzz3dh1zpbLy |archive-url=https://archive.is/20151222175516/http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b132c504-4cfb-11db-b03c-0000779e2340.html#axzz3dh1zpbLy |dead-url=yes|journal=FT |location= |publisher= |date=26 September 2006 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2005 he declared that France ''lives beyond its means'', a sentiment echoing the words of the Prime Minister [[Raymond Barre]] in 1976. He stated to the French people that the entirety of their income tax would serve only to finance the interest payments on the national debt.

A month later he set up a commission presided over by [[BNP Paribas]] CEO [[Michel Pébereau]] which was given the task of ''breaking the pattern of public debt''.

He stipulated the maintenance of [[public deficit]] below a level of 3% of GDP in 2005 and 2006 as his primary goal. At the end of 2005 France’s deficit fell to 2.9% of its GDP after three consecutive years of surpassing the figure of 3%. In 2006 the public deficit was further reduced to 2.5% and public debt was recorded to have dramatically fallen to 63.9% of GDP. For the first time since 1995 the country’s budget was in a situation of primary surplus. At the same time France’s GDP rose by 2.1% in 2006 compared with 1.7% in 2005.

In October 2005 Breton proposed a law on "the modernization of the economy" which was voted in the same year and looked to prioritize SMEs’ access to financial markets, encourage research and promote giving employees a stake in the company’s outcomes. On this occasion he also announced himself in favor of the status of the [[Societas Europaea]] being written into French legislation to allow businesses to operate throughout the EU on the basis of a unified set of financial rules.

At the same time he led a reform for fiscal simplification which attempted to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to four and put in place a pre-filled internet based declaration of revenues.

During this period he unveiled the concept of the [[tax shield]], which he would initiate in 2006 at a level of 60% excepting health insurance and social debt reimbursement. This was taken up again by Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007 with a lowering of the level to 60% and an inclusion of health insurance and social debt reimbursement.

Thierry Breton wanted France to be the first country to move forward in developing its immaterial heritage. Thus in March 2007 he entrusted a report to [[Maurice Lévy]] and [[Jean-Pierre Jouyet]] on the economy of the immaterial with the goal of creating an agency for the immaterial heritage of the state which ambition would be to valorize the state’s immaterial assets (use of image; brands etc.) This one-of-a-kind agency was put in place on 23 April 2007. This immaterial heritage was recorded as 10 billion euros worth of assets in the state’s annual report in 2010.

In February 2007 the unemployment rate was at 8.4%, the lowest recorded score since June 1983.

He finished his term on 15 May 2007 at the end of Jacques Chirac’s five-year term. The handover of power to [[Jean-Louis Borloo]], named as Minister of the Economy by the newly elected President of the French Republic Nicolas Sarkozy, took place the following day.

==Board member==
He served as director in many boards such as:
[[AXA]]; [[La Poste (France)|La Poste]]; [[Dexia]]; [[Schneider Electric]]; [[Bouygues Telecom]]. He sits today on the board of directors of [[Carrefour]] where he chairs the Compensation and Benefits Committee. He also is member of [[Bank of America]]'s Global Advisory Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/25/nc-bank-of-america-idUSnBw9jFx6fa+110+BSW20130125 |title=Bank of America Forms Global Advisory Council |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=25 January 2013 |website=Reuters |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924173513/http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/25/nc-bank-of-america-idUSnBw9jFx6fa+110+BSW20130125 |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The [[Bisbee Deportation]]:&lt;ref name="fillippelli_p025" /&gt; After seizing the local Western Union telegraph office in order to cut off outside communication, several thousand armed vigilantes forced 1,185 men in [[Bisbee, Arizona]] into manure-laden boxcars and "deported" them to the New Mexico desert. The action was precipitated by a strike when workers' demands (including improvements to safety and working conditions at the local copper mines, an end to discrimination against labor organizations and unequal treatment of foreign and minority workers, and the institution of a [[living wage|fair wage]] system) went unmet. The "deportation" was organized by Sheriff Harry Wheeler. The incident was investigated months later by a Federal Mediation Commission set up by President [[Woodrow Wilson]]; the Commission found that no federal law applied, and referred the case to the State of Arizona, which failed to take any action, citing patriotism and support for the war as justification for the vigilantes' action.

'''Trade facilitation''' looks at how procedures and controls governing the movement of goods across national borders can be improved to reduce associated cost burdens and maximise efficiency while safeguarding legitimate regulatory objectives. Business costs may be a direct function of collecting information and submitting declarations or an indirect consequence of border checks in the form of delays and associated time penalties, forgone business opportunities and reduced competitiveness.

Understanding and use of the term “trade facilitation” varies in the literature and amongst practitioners. "Trade facilitation" is largely used by institutions which seek to improve the regulatory interface between government bodies and traders at national borders. The [[WTO]], in an online training package, has defined trade facilitation as “the simplification and harmonisation of international trade procedures”, where trade procedures are the “activities, practices and formalities involved in collecting, presenting, communicating and processing data required for the movement of goods in international trade”.&lt;ref&gt;"Compendium of Trade Facilitation Recommendations", issued by UN/ECE (TRADE/WP.4/INF.91); published by UNCTAD: TD/B/FAL/INF.91.&lt;/ref&gt;

In defining the term, many trade facilitation proponents will also make reference to [[trade finance]] and the procedures applicable for making payments (e.g. via a commercial banks). For example, [[UN/CEFACT]] defines trade facilitation as "the simplification, standardization and harmonisation of procedures and associated information flows required to move goods from seller to buyer and to make payment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = TRADE FACILITATION IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE - Introduction|url = http://tfig.unece.org/details.html|website = tfig.unece.org|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, the term trade facilitation is extended to address a wider agenda in [[economic development]] and trade to include: the improvement of transport infrastructure, the removal of government corruption, the modernization of customs administration, the removal of other non-tariff trade barriers, as well as export marketing and promotion.

The World Trade Report 2015 provides an overview of the various trade facilitation definitions from academia as well as various international organizations, contrasting them with the scope of the WTO [[Trade Facilitation Agreement]] (TFA) concluded in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/publications_e/wtr15_e.htm |title=WTO World Trade report}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WTO TFA has become the new baseline for trade facilitation, with many countries striving to implement measures going beyond those included in this Agreement in order to maintain a competitive advantage in global markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/Full%20Report%20-%20APTIR%202015.pdf|title=Asia Pacific Trade and Investment Report 2015 (see Chapter 4 pp.53-68) |access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, most countries have focused their trade facilitation efforts on establishing electronic single windows and other paperless trade systems to further reduce trade costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/Global%20Report%20Final%2020151016.pdf|title=UNRC Trade Facilitation and Paperless Trade Implementation Survey 2015 |access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of regulatory activity in international trade ==

'''Fiscal:'''
Collection of customs duties, excise duties and other indirect taxes; payment mechanisms

'''Safety and security:'''
Security and anti smuggling controls; dangerous goods; vehicle checks; immigration and visa formalities

'''Environment and health:'''
Phytosanitary, veterinary and hygiene controls; health and safety measures; [[CITES]] controls; ships’ waste

'''Consumer protection:'''
Product testing; labelling; conformity checks with marketing standards (e.g. fruit and vegetables)

'''Trade policy:'''
Administration of quota restrictions; export refunds

== Topics and issues in trade facilitation ==
Trade facilitation has its intellectual roots in the fields of [[logistics]] and [[supply chain management]]. Trade facilitation looks at operational improvements at the interface between business and government and associated [[transaction costs]]. Trade facilitation has become a key feature in [[supply chain security]] and [[customs]] modernisation programmes. Within the context of [[economic development]] it has also come to prominence in the [[Doha Development Round]]. However, it is an equally prominent feature in unilateral and bilateral initiatives that seek to improve the trade environment and enhance business competitiveness. Reference to trade facilitation is sometimes also made in the context of "[[Regulatory reform|better regulation]]". Some organisations promoting trade facilitation will emphasize the cutting of [[red tape]] in international trade as their main objective. Propagated ideas and concepts to reforming trade and customs procedures generally resonate around the following themes: 
* Simple rules and procedures
* Avoidance of duplication
* Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs)
* Alignment of procedures and adherence to international conventions
* Trade consultation
* Transparent and operable rules and procedures
* Accommodation of business practices
* Operational flexibility
* Public-service standards and performance measures
* Mechanisms for corrections and appeals
* Fair and consistent enforcement
* Proportionality of legislation and control to risk
* Time-release measures
* [[Paperless trade]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unescap.org/resources/unrcs-trade-facilitation-and-paperless-trade-implementation-survey-2015-asia-and-pacific|title=Trade Facilitation and Paperless Trade Implementation Survey 2015 in Asia Pacific|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unescap.org/resources/trade-facilitation-asia-and-pacific-which-policies-and-measures-affect-trade-costs-most-1|title=Trade Facilitation in Asia and the Pacific: Which Policies and Measures Affect Trade Costs the Most? 2015 Update|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unescap.org/resources/estimating-benefits-cross-border-paperless-trade|title=Estimating the Benefits of Cross-Border Paperless Trade|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
