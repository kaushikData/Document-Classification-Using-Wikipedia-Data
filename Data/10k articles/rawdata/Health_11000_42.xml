'''Algas Calcareas''' is a [[dietary supplement]] derived from a [[Algae|marine-algae]] native to [[South America]] and is abundant on the sea [[Shore|shores]]. This algae absorbs minerals from the [[sea]] before it breaks it down naturally before settling on the bottom of the ocean. This calcified structure is a source of many [[trace minerals]] and bone-supporting factors and is also pre-digested and bioavailable. 
Algas Calcareas was first found by Dr. Marcos Norman to reduce fusion temperatures in [[steel]] manufacturing. However, Dr. Norman became so fascinated with the properties of this mineral source, he left Morris Kwugsem to begin a study on this South American marine algae that has lasted for 29 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Algas Calcareas|url=http://www.algaecal.com/algaecal-ingredients/algas-calcareas/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1977, it has been used by in a [[Calcium supplement|calcium]] and [[Mineral (nutrient)|mineral supplement]]. A very wide range of health benefits have been reported including bone health, joint health, pain reduction, circulatory system benefits, and increased energy.

'''Body integrity dysphoria''' ('''BID''', also referred to as '''body integrity identity disorder''', '''amputee identity disorder''' and '''xenomelia''', formerly called '''apotemnophilia''') is a disorder characterized by a desire to be disabled or discomfort with being able-bodied beginning in early adolescence and resulting in harmful consequences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/256572629|title=ICD-11 - Mortality and Morbidity Statistics|website=icd.who.int|language=en|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; BID appears to be related to [[somatoparaphrenia]].&lt;ref name=Brugger2014rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brugger|first1=P|last2=Lenggenhager|first2=B|title=The bodily self and its disorders: neurological, psychological and social aspects.|journal=Current Opinion in Neurology|date=December 2014|volume=27|issue=6|pages=644–52|doi=10.1097/WCO.0000000000000151|pmid=25333602|url=http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/100466/}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with this condition may refer to themselves as "transabled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baril|first1=Alexandre|last2=Trevenen|first2=Kathryn|title=Transabled women lost in translation?

==History==
Apotemnophilia was first described in a 1977 article by psychologists Gregg Furth and [[John Money]] as primarily sexually oriented, in 1986 Money described a similar condition he called "acromotophile", namely sexual arousal over a partner's amputation.  Publications before 2004 were generally [[case study|case studies]].&lt;ref name=Preester2013rev/&gt; The condition received public attention in the late 1990s after a Scottish surgeon, Robert Smith, amputated limbs of two people who were desperate to have this done and were otherwise healthy.&lt;ref name=Preester2013rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Preester|first1=H|title=Merleau-Ponty's sexual schema and the sexual component of body integrity identity disorder.|journal=Medicine, Health Care, and Philosophy|date=May 2013|volume=16|issue=2|pages=171–84|doi=10.1007/s11019-011-9367-3|pmid=22139385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Michael First published the first [[clinical research]] in which he surveyed 52 people with the condition, a quarter of whom have had an amputation. Based on that work, First coined the term "body integrity identity disorder" to express what he saw as more of an identity disorder than a paraphilia.&lt;ref name=Sedda2014rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sedda|first1=A|last2=Bottini|first2=G|title=Apotemnophilia, body integrity identity disorder or xenomelia?

==Classification==
As of 2014 it remained unclear whether BID is a form of [[neurodiversity|human diversity]] or a mental disorder, similar to the development of the concept of [[gender dysphoria]]. There was debate about including it in the [[DSM-5]] and it was not included; it was also not included in the ''[[International Statistical Classification of Diseases|ICD-]]10''.&lt;ref name=Brugger2014rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sedda2014rev/&gt; It has been included in the ICD-11, which reached a stable version in June 2018, as 'Body integrity dysphoria' with code 6C21.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ethics of surgically amputating the undesired limb of a person with BID are difficult and controversial.&lt;ref name=Levy2007&gt;{{cite book |author=Levy, Neil |title=Neuroethics — Challenges for the 21st Century |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=GIIj-hNhZrcC&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 3–5]  |year=2007 |isbn=0-521-68726-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Costandi|first1=Mo|title=The science and ethics of voluntary amputation {{!}} Mo Costandi|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2012/may/30/1|work=The Guardian|date=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dua|first1=A|title=Apotemnophilia: ethical considerations of amputating a healthy limb.|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=February 2010|volume=36|issue=2|pages=75–8|doi=10.1136/jme.2009.031070|pmid=20133399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
BID is a rare, infrequently studied condition in which there is a mismatch between the mental body image and the physical body, characterized by an intense desire for amputation of a limb, usually a leg, or to become blind or deaf.&lt;ref name=Brugger2014rev/&gt;  The person sometimes has a sense of sexual arousal connected with the desire for loss of a limb or sense.&lt;ref name=Brugger2014rev/&gt;

Some act out their desires, pretending they are amputees using prostheses and other tools to ease their desire to be one. Some people with BID have reported to the media or by interview over the telephone with researchers that they have resorted to self-amputation of a "superfluous" limb; for example, by allowing a train to run over it, or by damaging the limb so badly that surgeons will have to amputate it. However, the medical literature records few, if any, cases of actual self amputation.&lt;ref name=Levy2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khalil2012rev/&gt;

To the extent that generalizations can be made, people with BID appear to start to wish for amputation when they are young, between 8 and 12 years old, and often knew a person with an amputated limb when they are children; however, people with BID tend to seek treatment only when they are much older.&lt;ref name=Khalil2012rev/&gt;  People with BID seem to be predominantly male, and while there is no evidence that sexual preference is relevant, there does seem to be a correlation with BID and a person having [[gender dysphoria]] or a [[paraphilia]]; there appears to be a weak correlation with [[personality disorders]].&lt;ref name=Khalil2012rev/&gt;  Family psychiatric history does not appear to be relevant, there does not appear to be any strong correlation with the site of the limb or limbs that the person wishes they did not have, nor with any past trauma to the undesired limb.&lt;ref name=Khalil2012rev/&gt;

==Causes==
As of 2014 the cause was not clear and was a subject of ongoing research.&lt;ref name=Sedda2014rev/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
As of 2014 there were no formal diagnostic criteria.&lt;ref name=Brugger2014rev/&gt;

==Treatment==
There is no [[evidence-based treatment]] for BID; there are reports of the use of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], [[antidepressants]], and surgery to amputate the undesired limb.&lt;ref name=Khalil2012rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bou Khalil|first1=R|last2=Richa|first2=S|title=Apotemnophilia or body integrity identity disorder: a case report review.|journal=The International Journal of Lower Extremity Wounds|date=December 2012|volume=11|issue=4|pages=313–9|doi=10.1177/1534734612464714|pmid=23089967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==
Outcomes of treated and untreated BID are not known; there are case reports that BID persisted even after amputation.&lt;ref name=Khalil2012rev/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1320">'''[[Capital punishment]]''' was abolished in '''[[Slovenia]]''' in 1989, when it was still a federal republic of the former [[Yugoslavia]]. When Slovenia introduced its [[s:Constitution of Slovenia|democratic constitution]] on the 23 December 1991 capital punishment became unconstitutional. On 1 July 1994 protocol No. 6 to the [[ECHR]] came into force. Later Slovenia also adopted the Second Optional Protocol to the [[ICCPR]].

In law, medicine, and statistics, '''cause of death''' is an official determination of conditions resulting in a [[human]]'s [[death]], which may be recorded on a [[death certificate]]. A cause of death is determined by a [[medical examiner]].

==Accuracy concerns==
A study published in ''[[Preventing Chronic Disease]]'' found that only one-third of [[New York City]] [[Residency (medicine)|resident physician]]s reported believing that the present system of documentation was accurate. Half reported the inability to record "what they felt to be the correct cause of death", citing reasons such as [[technical limitation]] and instruction to "put something else". Nearly four-fifths reported being unaware that determinations of "probable", "presumed", or "undetermined" could be made, and fewer than three percent reported ever updating a death certificate when conflicting lab results or other new information became available, and [[cardiovascular disease]] was indicated as "the most frequent diagnosis inaccurately reported".&lt;ref name="WexelmanEden2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wexelman|first1=Barbara A.|last2=Eden|first2=Edward|last3=Rose|first3=Keith M.|title=Survey of New York City Resident Physicians on Cause-of-Death Reporting, 2010|journal=Preventing Chronic Disease|volume=10|year=2013|issn=1545-1151|doi=10.5888/pcd10.120288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Causes of death are sometimes disputed by relatives or members of the public, particularly when some degree of uncertainty or ambiguity exists in relation to the cause of death. On occasion, such disputes may result from, or sometimes instigate, a [[conspiracy theory]].

==Age==

"Old age" in of itself is not a direct cause of death; the direct cause can always in theory be attributed to a specific disease or failed organ system.  However, over time, in most (but not all) organisms, many critical biological systems experience chemical or physical damage which eventually accumulate enough to cause failure.  This is a significant problem in humans; it is estimated that of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/&gt; In industrialized nations the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = Aubrey de Grey | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = August 7, 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161013163622/http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | archivedate = October 13, 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus as an indirect cause, [[biological aging]] is by far the leading cause of death.

An alternative view of mortality is to consider the estimated loss in life-years from causes of death other than age-related.  An [[infographic]] prepared by Thomas Porostocky and published in 2013 compares 2005 to 2010 in this "life-years lost annually" dimension.&lt;ref name=porostocky2013&gt;{{Cite news|title = Want To Save Lives?  You Need a Map of What's Doing Us In.|date = December 2013|last = Porostocky|first = Thomas|work = WIRED|page = 31|department = INFOPORN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death caused by emotional state==

There are also popular notions that someone can be "scared to death" or die of loneliness or heartbreak.  Death caused by fear or stress can indeed have direct physiological effects.  For example, it has been proposed that overstimulation of the [[Vagus nerve]]—which suppresses heart rate in a mechanism related to the behavior of [[apparent death]] or "playing possum"—is the cause of documented cases of [[psychogenic death]].  The [[flight or fight response]] to fear or stress has the opposite effect, increasing heart rate through [[stress hormones]], and can cause cardiovascular problems (especially in those with pre-existing conditions).  This is the proposed mechanism for the observed increase in the death rate due to cardiac arrest after widely experienced acutely stressful events such as terrorism, military attacks, and natural disasters (even among those who are not in the affected area) and for documented deaths in muggings and other frightening events which caused no traumatic physical harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scared-to-death-heart-attack/|title=Can a person be scared to death?|first=Coco|last=Ballantyne|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/10/24/can-literally-be-scared-to-death-science-says-yes/|title=Can you literally be scared to death? Science says yes|date=24 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The proximal medical cause of death in these cases is likely to be recorded as cardiac failure or vagal inhibition (which also has other potential causes such as blows to certain parts of the body and nerve injuries).&lt;ref name="healthdrip"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthdrip.com/2012/05/31/vagal-inhibition/|title=Vagal inhibition – Health Drip|first=|last=healthdrip|publisher=|access-date=2017-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113020352/http://healthdrip.com/2012/05/31/vagal-inhibition/#|archive-date=2017-01-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One specific condition observed to result from acute stress, [[takotsubo cardiomyopathy]], is nicknamed "broken heart syndrome", but the stress need not be relationship-related and need not be negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/Cardiomyopathy/Is-Broken-Heart-Syndrome-Real_UCM_448547_Article.jsp|title=Is Broken Heart Syndrome Real?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal implications==

===United States===
Some insurance contracts, such as [[life insurance|life insurance policies]], have special rules for certain causes of death. [[Suicide|Intentional injuries]], for example, may invalidate claims under terms of such a contract.

"'''Champagne socialist'''" is a pejorative political term originating in the [[Politics of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Champagne socialists 'not as left wing as they think they are' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/7887888/Champagne-socialists-not-as-left-wing-as-they-think-they-are.html |publisher=The Telegraph |date=14 Jul 2010 |accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rooksby"&gt;{{cite news |title=So what's the problem with champagne socialism? |last1=Rooksby|first1=Ed |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/16/what-problem-champagne-socialism-francois-hollande |publisher=The Guardian |date=16 April 2013  |accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The phrase is used to describe self-identified [[Socialism|socialists]], whose comfortable [[upper middle-class]] lifestyles are thought to contradict their political convictions; this is typified by their supposed consumption of the luxury drink [[Champagne]]. It is a popular [[epithet]] that implies a degree of [[hypocrisy]], and it is closely related to the concept of the ''[[liberal elite]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/18/world/europe/18cnd-kouchner.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=Taking "Champagne socialist" jibes on the chin - "I've always been enthusiastic about Champagne" - the Groucho club member is no fair-weather friend of the party. |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=3 July 2000 |accessdate=25 November 2012 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/817067.stm |title=Ken Follett: Novel activist}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is broadly similar to the American terms ''Learjet liberal'', ''[[limousine liberal]]'' or ''latte liberal'', and to idioms in other languages such as the Spanish ''[[:es:Izquierda caviar|Izquierda caviar]]'', the French ''[[Gauche caviar]]'', the German ''Salonkommunist'', Brazilian ''Esquerda Caviar'' or ''Socialista de Iphone'', and the Italian ''[[Radical chic]]''. Other related terms include ''[[Hampstead#Politics|Hampstead liberal]], [[Gucci]] socialist'', and in Ireland ''[[smoked salmon]] socialist''.

==United Kingdom==
[[File:Ramsay MacDonald ggbain.37952.jpg|thumb|UK Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald]]
In the UK, the term typically refers to affluent [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] supporters, who stereotypically live in [[Inner London]] and read ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper. [[right-wing politics|Right-wing]] critics often use the term to disparage political opponents; the champagne socialist espouses [[left-wing politics|leftist]] views while enjoying a comfortable lifestyle, implying that left-wing views are really only held by privileged people.&lt;ref name="rooksby" /&gt; This usage of the term has been criticised by the writer and broadcaster [[Caitlin Moran]] as a [[List of fallacies|fallacious]] argument, because it assumes that only those who are poor can express an opinion about [[social inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moran|first1=Caitlin|title=Moranifesto|publisher=Ebury Publishing|isbn=9780091949051|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AHTkCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=Champagne%20socialist&amp;pg=PA161#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used by left-wing commentators to criticise [[centrist]] views. For example, some traditional left-wingers regard the first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Ramsay MacDonald]] as a "champagne socialist" who betrayed the [[Labour movement]]. MacDonald's lavish lifestyle and his mingling with [[High society (social class)|high society]] is supposed to have been a corrupting influence which led to the end of the Labour Government in 1931 and the formation of the [[Second National ministry|National Government]].&lt;ref name="rooksby" /&gt; More recently, the epithet has been levelled at supporters of the [[New Labour]] movement which brought [[Tony Blair]] to power in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laville|first1=By George Jones and Sandra|title=How Blair's New Labour went flat for champagne socialists|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1346349/How-Blairs-New-Labour-went-flat-for-champagne-socialists.html|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 July 2000|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article about [[Oscar Wilde]]'s 1891 essay "[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]", political commentator [[Will Self]] expressed the view that Wilde could be considered an early champagne socialist because of his [[Aestheticism|aesthetic]] lifestyle and socialist leanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Self|first1=Will|title=Will Self: Oscar Wilde, champagne socialism and why I’m voting Labour|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/may/01/will-self-oscar-wilde-champagne-socialist-voting-labour|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=The Guardian|date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer and Labour supporter [[John Mortimer]], when accused of being champagne socialist, said that he preferred to be thought of as "more a [[Bollinger]] [[Bolshevik]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Ted|title=Florence and Tuscany: A Literary Guide for Travellers|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857731272|page=189|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6f3AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=%22champagne%20socialist%22&amp;pg=PA189#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cult TV series [[Absolutely Fabulous (series 4)]] episode 1 ("Parralox"), Saffron is offered a job with New Labour. While she is at pains to avoid being seen as a champagne socialist, her grandmother Mrs. Monsoon considers the family to be 'Bolly Bolsheviks'.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The label has also been applied to the Labour politician [[Geoffrey Robinson]] MP on account of his  large personal fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Robinson: The ultimate champagne socialist|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/216965.stm|accessdate=7 February 2017|work=BBC News|date=23 December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sully|first1=Melanie A.|title=The new politics of Tony Blair|date=2000|publisher=Social Science Monographs|location=Boulder|isbn=9780880339858|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer [[Charlotte Church]] has described herself as a "prosecco socialist",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-32708630|title='Champagne socialist' Charlotte Church 'more of a prosecco girl'|date=12 May 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the increasing popularity and lower price range of non-champagne sparkling wines such as [[prosecco]] and [[Cava wine|cava]].

==Australia and New Zealand==
In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the variant "'''Chardonnay socialist'''" was used when  [[Chardonnay]] was seen as a drink of affluent people.&lt;ref name = AustNatDict&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/res/aus_words/aewords/aewords_cg.php|title = Australian Words: C-G|publisher = Australian National University - Australian National Dictionary Centre |work = Australian National Dictionary|accessdate = 2008-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/24/1042911549105.html|title =

Australian left-wing "true believers" leveled the term at supporters of the failed [[Australian republic referendum, 1999|republic referendum of 1999]], where the vote was split not along conventional party lines but very much along socio-economic divides, with the rich overwhelmingly supporting the change while the less well-off were opposed. Staunch Australian [[right-wing]]ers, on the other hand, leveled it at those who support such things as government funding for the [[art]]s, free tertiary education, and the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] &amp;ndash; all causes which are described by critics as "middle-class [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://arts.monash.edu.au/psi/news-and-events/apsa/refereed-papers/au-nz-politics/rolfe.pdf| format = PDF| title = Days of Wine and Poseurs: Stereotpypes of Class, Consumption &amp; Competition in Democratic Discourse| work = A Paper Delivered to the Australasian Political Studies Association Annual Conference 24th-26th September 2007, Monash University| publisher = Monash University| last = Rolfe| first = Mark| year = 2007| accessdate = 2008-09-11| quote = (from pages 24-5) From his first day in parliament as leader in March 1995 until the election, Howard courted the strong public perceptions of Keating arrogance that were evident in party polling. This was the context to the ad hominem of ‘chardonnay socialist’ that was extended to any Labor speaker and to the whole ALP in an attempt to undermine their ethos through associations with self-indulgence, selfishness and lack of concern for the people. Frequent deployment of these terms by the media provided a further convincing context for this rhetoric. Kim Carr was called a ‘Bollinger Bolshevik’ by Vanstone (Commonwealth Parliamentary Debates [CPD], Senate, 13 May 1997) and there was ‘Chardonnay Cheryl’ Kernot, the ‘shadow minister for the selfish “me generation” yuppies’ with her ‘list of hors d’oeuvres for the next caucus radical chic soiree’, said Richard Alston (CPD, Senate, 4 March 1998; 23 March 1998; 30 March 1998). She could be seen with Mark Latham, said David Kemp, ‘on the patio sipping their wine, complaining about the excesses of capitalism’ (CPD, Senate, 22 October 1997).| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080808125405/http://www.arts.monash.edu.au/psi/news-and-events/apsa/refereed-papers/au-nz-politics/rolfe.pdf| archivedate = 8 August 2008| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 90s chardonnay had become more generally consumed&lt;ref name = SMHNov2003/&gt; and it is now the most dominant white wine varietal produced in Australia&lt;ref&gt;https://www.adelaide.edu.au/press/titles/austwine/austwine-ebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; so its association with elitism has faded.

==Life==
He was born at Trenick House near [[Truro]], the son of Charles Bate (1789–1872) and  Harriet Spence (1788–1879).&lt;ref name="Carideorum"&gt;{{cite journal|author=S. De Grave &amp; C. H. J. M.

He was an authority on the [[crustacean|Crustacea]], for which he was elected a [[fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1861,&lt;ref name = RS/&gt; and a frequent correspondent of [[Charles Darwin]], mostly concerning their shared interest in [[barnacle]]s. Together with [[John Obadiah Westwood]], he wrote "''A history of the British sessile-eyed Crustacea''" in 1868. He wrote reports on the crustaceans collected during the HMS [[Challenger expedition|''Challenger'' expedition]] of 1872–1876.

He died on 29 July 1889, at The Rock, [[South Brent]], [[Devon]] and was buried in Plymouth cemetery. &lt;ref name = RS/&gt;

==Family==
On 17 June 1847, at [[Littlehempston]] church, near [[Totnes]], he married Emily Amelia, daughter of John Hele and sister of the Rev. Henry Hele, the rector; she died on 4 April 1884, leaving two sons and a daughter. 
Bate married for a second time in October 1887.{{sfn|Courtney|1901}}

The '''Contaminated Blood Scandal''' in the United Kingdom arose when at least 3,891 people with [[Haemophilia]] became infected with [[hepatitis C]] of whom 1,243 were also infected with [[HIV]], the virus that leads to [[HIV/AIDS|acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS), as a result of receiving [[Contaminated haemophilia blood products|contaminated clotting factor products]] supplied by the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) in the 1970s and 1980s.  As of October 2017 there were at least 1,246 confirmed deaths in the UK of people who were killed by the clotting agents Factor VIII &amp; Factor IX and the viruses they transmitted. Some have estimated that the total number of those who have died could be as high as 2,400 though exact figures are not known.

Media have sometimes misreported the treatments involved as "blood transfusions", the Factor products used were a processed pharmaceutical product falling under the [[Medicines Act 1968|Medicines Act]] and bore no resemblance to blood transfusion. The infections were principally caused by the [[Blood plasma|plasma]] derived product known as [[Factor VIII]], a medicinal product that was sourced from the United States and elsewhere. The creation of such products involved dangerous manufacturing processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2011/aug/04/bad-blood-cautionary-tale/|title=Bad Blood: A Cautionary Tale|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large groups of paid donors were used (as many as 60,000 per batch, and including prisoners and drug addicts); it only required one infected donor to contaminate an entire batch, which would then infect all of the patients that received that material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hemophilia.in/index.php/patient-education/product-safety|title=Hemophilia Federation (India) – Product Safety|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, this was at a time when the practice of paying donors for [[whole blood]] in the United States had effectively ceased; the UK did not import whole blood&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simon|first1=Glenarthur|title=Blood: Licensing Requirements|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1983/dec/05/blood-licensing-requirements|website=Hansard|publisher=House of Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt; from abroad, but it did import large quantities of Factor VIII given to haemophiliacs (as described in the documentary ''[[Factor 8: The Arkansas Prison Blood Scandal]]''). It is said that the principal reason that the UK imported these products was that it did not produce enough of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/aug/19/NHS.medicineandhealth|title=Owen demands inquiry into infected blood scandal|journal=The Guardian|first1=James|last1=Meikle|first2=health|last2=correspondent|date=19 August 2002|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1557187/HIV-blood-disaster-papers-were-pulped.html|title=HIV blood disaster papers 'were pulped'|publisher=|date=2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 1986 showed that 76% of those who used commercial Factor products became infected with HIV, as opposed to none of those who only used previous treatment, Cryoprecipitate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gill |first1=J.

No government, healthcare or pharmaceutical entity in the UK has admitted any liability in the scandal, and no [[damages]] or compensation have been paid to those infected or affected, although the government has provided some means-tested benefits to some of the surviving victims through a Trust.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Macfarlane Trust|url=http://www.macfarlane.org.uk/|website=www.macfarlane.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Haemophilia is a mostly [[hereditary|inherited]] [[genetic disorder]] that impairs the body's ability to [[coagulation|clot]], a process needed to [[hemostasis|stop bleeding]].&lt;ref name=NIH2013What&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Hemophilia?|url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hemophilia|website=NHLBI|accessdate=8 September 2016|date=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Hemophilia Facts|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hemophilia/facts.html|website=CDC|accessdate=8 September 2016|date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in people [[bleeding]] longer after an injury, easy [[bruising]], and an increased risk of [[hemarthrosis|bleeding inside joint]]s or other parts of the body.

Some people can now be cured from Haemophilia all-together,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gene therapy used to treat haemophilia|url=https://www.nhs.uk/news/genetics-and-stem-cells/gene-therapy-used-to-treat-haemophilia/|website=nhs.uk|date=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but modern "synthetic" or "non-human derived" Factor products such as Recombinant Factor VIII&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Franchini|first1=Massimo|title=Plasma-derived versus recombinant Factor VIII concentrates for the treatment of haemophilia A: recombinant is better|pages=292–296|doi=10.2450/2010.0067-10|date=October 2010|pmc=2957496|pmid=20967172|volume=8|issue=4|journal=Blood Transfus}}&lt;/ref&gt; continue to be widely used. Factor products work by replacing the missing Factor proteins, which can take place at home or in hospital. The clotting factors are made either from [[Blood plasma|Plasma]] or by [[Protein production|recombinant methods]]. In the 1970s, haemophiliacs began to be treated with "Factor Concentrates", which were sold as a revolutionary treatment. The consequential increase in use led to pharmaceutical companies seeking substantial supplies of plasma, and thousands of donors including prisoners, drug addicts, prostitutes and people known to be infected with HIV or hepatitis were allowed or even paid to give their plasma.

Some of the most famous examples of risky plasma harvesting are those of [[Luckner Cambronne]] who became known as "The Vampire of the Caribbean"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pepin|first1=Jacques|title=The Origins of AIDS|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139501415|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dTaMBrPBK6EC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;dq=luckner+cambronne+plasma#v=onepage&amp;q=luckner%20cambronne%20plasma&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also Crysosan Ltd, a company based in [[Canada]] that was found [[Guilt (law)|guilty]] of harvesting plasma from [[Cadaver|dead Russians bodies]] and [[relabelling|re-labelling]] it as Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Ridgeway|first1=James|title=It's All for Sale: The Control of Global Resources|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mWw0iefgg5AC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=cryosan+russian#v=onepage&amp;q=cryosan%20russian&amp;f=false|publisher=Duke University Press|language=en|date=2004|isbn=978-0822333746}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arkansas Bloodsuckers: the Clintons, Prisoners and the Blood Trade|url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2015/09/04/arkansas-bloodsuckers-the-clintons-prisoners-and-the-blood-trade/|website=www.counterpunch.org|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blood money|url=https://www.salon.com/1998/12/24/cov_23news/|language=en|date=1998-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==

Plasma donations could be collected using a process called [[plasmapheresis]]. In addition to NHS derived Factor produced by [[Bio Products Laboratory]] (BPL), manufacturers that supplied clotting factor products to the UK during the mid-1970s and 1980s included Abbott (Profilate), Armour Pharmaceuticals (Factorate), [[Bayer]]-owned [[Cutter Laboratories|Cutter]] (Koate), [[Baxter International]]-owned Travenol/Hyland (Hemofil/Interhem), Immuno (Kryobulin) and Speywood (Humanate).{{cn|date=October 2018}}

In 1999 Centeon changed its name to Aventis Behring after the parent companies, Rorer and [[Hoechst AG]] merged to become Aventis. In 2004, CSL completed its acquisition of Aventis Behring for $925m, today known as [[CSL Behring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cslbehring.com/about/heritage-history.htm|title=Saving Lives For More Than A Century – CSL Behring|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1973 - 1986 - Hepatitis ==

The dangers of factor concentrates had first been raised since their inception. In 1974, American scientist [[Judith Graham Pool]] (who previously discovered the frozen blood product [[cryoprecipitate]], a safer treatment) described the products as "dangerous" and "unethical" and warned against their use. The [[World Health Organization]] also warned the UK not to import blood from countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis, such as the United States.&lt;ref name=PE1449&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=28 July 2017 |title=Justice delayed |url= |magazine=[[Private Eye]] |location=London |publisher=Pressdram Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1975, the World Health Organization passed a widely circulated resolution urging all countries to aim at self-sufficiency in blood-products.

In December 1975 an episode of the ''[[World in Action]]'' programme highlighted the danger of Hepatitis from imported Factor products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penroseinquiry.org.uk/finalreport/pdf/PEN0131400.PDF |title=World in Action - "Blood Money" }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1978 more than 50% of the Factor VIII used in England was being imported from overseas. This was because the country had failed to become self-sufficient in its own supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC1601689&amp;blobtype=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BPL,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpl.co.uk/about-bpl/|title=About BPL – Bio Products Laboratory Ltd.|website=www.bpl.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; which manufactured UK blood products, ran into continual trouble from under-funding. The Archer Report said, "In July 1979, the Medicines Inspectorate visited BPL. They reported that the buildings were never designed for the scale of production envisaged. They commented: 'If this were a commercial operation we would have no hesitation in recommending that manufacture should cease until the facility was upgraded to a minimum acceptable level'. BPL was rescued by Crown Immunity. Among their recommendations the Inspectorate advised: 'Under no circumstances should production of any product be increased under the existing manufacturing conditions'. Meanwhile, the existing plant continued production, relying on Crown Immunity to dispense with all the requirements of the Medicines Act, but was able to meet only about 40% of the national requirements."

A study published in December 1983 showed conclusively that the risk to a haemophiliac of contracting Hepatitis C by using untreated Factor products was 100% upon first exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.287.6407.1754 |title=Non-A non-B hepatitis after transfusion of factor VIII in infrequently treated patients |journal=BMJ |volume=287 |issue=6407 |pages=1754–1757 |year=1983 |last1=Fletcher |first1=M.

== 1981 - 1986 - HIV ==

In July 1982 the American [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reported that at least 3 haemophiliacs there had developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, 2 had died, and all 3 had used untreated Factor products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1982- AIDS is Discovered Among Hemophilia Patients |url=http://www.hemophiliafed.org/news-stories/2014/03/aids_and_hemophilia/ |website=Hemophilia Federation of America |date=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC said that "the occurrence among the three hemophiliac cases suggests the possible transmission of an agent through blood products".

In March 1983, the CDC reported that "Blood products or blood appear responsible for AIDS among hemophilia patients".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1983—CDC Determines that AIDS is Spread Through Infected Blood - Hemophilia Federation of America |url=http://www.hemophiliafed.org/news-stories/2014/03/1984-cdc-determines-that-aids-is-spreading-through-infected-blood/ |website=Hemophilia Federation of America |date=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1983 Dr N. S. Galbraith, director of the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre in England and Wales, sent a paper entitled "Action on AIDS" to Dr Ian Field at the [[Department of Health and Social Security]] in London informing him of the death from AIDS of a haemophiliac who had received Factor VIII concentrate imported from the United States. Galbraith stated: "I have reviewed the literature and come to the conclusion that all blood products made from blood donated in the USA after 1978 should be withdrawn from use until the risk of AIDS transmission by these products has been clarified ... I am most surprised that the USA manufacturers of the implicated blood products have not informed their customers of this new hazard. I assume no critical warning has been received in the United Kingdom?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preliminary Report Chapter 8: HIV and AIDS|url=http://www.penroseinquiry.org.uk/preliminary-report/chapter-8/#footnote-10795-30-backlink|website=www.penroseinquiry.org.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Galbraith's warning the products were not withdrawn: a Department of Health letter considered that his suggestion was "premature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penroseinquiry.org.uk/preliminary-report/chapter-8/|title=Preliminary Report Chapter 8: HIV and AIDS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1983 a leaflet distributed to UK blood donors answered the question as to whether AIDS could be transmitted by blood-products to be "Almost certainly yes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penroseinquiry.org.uk/finalreport/pdf/SGH0026675.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1983 the UK Health Minister, Ken Clarke told parliament that "There is no conclusive evidence that AIDS is transmitted by blood products" and the importation of infected products continued. When giving evidence to the Penrose Inquiry, Dr Mark Winter said that at the time Ken Clarke made this statement "all haemophilia clinicians by this stage clearly believed that commercial blood products could and were transmitting AIDS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Final Report: Chapter 9 - Knowledge of the Geographical Spread and Prevalence of HIV/AIDS 1 |url=http://www.penroseinquiry.org.uk/finalreport/text/354876_chapter_9.html#footnote-042-backlink |website=www.penroseinquiry.org.uk |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1984 Lord Glenarthur (Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the DHSS) said that "It remains the case that there is no conclusive evidence of the transmission of AIDS through blood products, although the circumstantial evidence is strong",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penroseinquiry.org.uk/finalreport/pdf/SGH0076160.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again the use of untreated Factor products and importation continued.

== 2000 - Destroyed Evidence Investigation ==

In April 2000 the Department of Health published an internal audit to examine the loss of records relating to Hepatitis C litigation. The report concluded that "an arbitrary and unjustified decision, most likely taken by an inexperienced member of staff, was responsible for the destruction of a series of files containing the minutes and background papers of the Advisory Committee on the Virological Safety of Blood (ACSVB)".{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== 2009 - The Archer Report ==

In the early 2000s the former Solicitor General for England and Wales, [[Peter Archer, Baron Archer of Sandwell|Lord Archer]], campaigned for an inquiry into the tainted blood scandal alongside [[David Owen|Lord Owen]], who was the Health Minister from 1974 to 1976, [[Patrick Jenkin, Baron Jenkin of Roding|Lord Jenkin]], former Shadow Health Secretary, and others. They were unsuccessful.

In a 1990 episode of ''[[The Cook Report]]'', Owen said: "I can see why some people would be unhappy with having all the facts revealed because it will show negligence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cook Report – Profits Before Patients|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb1Kb-WvW2o}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016 Owen gave a speech in London during which he said the scandal had been covered-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqt0xXz-saw|title=Lord David Owen – Bad Blood Speech 29/9/16|first=|last=Factor8Scandal|date=30 September 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archer chaired a privately funded independent investigation set up in 2007. The Archer Report was published in 2009 and aimed to uncover the causes of the events that led to the thousands of infections and deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/delays-led-to-thousands-receiving-contaminated-blood-1629555.html|title=Delays Led to Thousands Receiving Contaminated Blood|author=Sam Marsden|publisher= Independent.co.uk|date=23 February 2009|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report held no legal or official status and was unable to subpoena witnesses or demand the disclosure of documents.&lt;ref name=PE1449/&gt; Nonetheless, it sought to address the issue of missing evidence and documents relating to the scandal. For example, the ministerial papers of Lord Owen had been destroyed. "We have been unable to ascertain who carried out the destruction of the papers, and who gave the instructions. But the conclusion appears inescapable that some official made a decision which he or she had no authority to make, or that someone was guilty of a serious error of judgement. The consequence is that Lord Owen has done his best to recollect details of events a quarter of a century ago, but both he, and we, have been deprived of the primary sources", Archer reported. Lord Jenkin also voiced his difficulties obtaining documents for the inquiry, although the report stated: "He subsequently received from the Department two bundles of documents. One of these was to be treated as confidential". Lord Jenkin felt that the destruction of records was deliberate, and done “in order to draw a line under the disaster”.&lt;ref name="Archer Report"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Archer Inquiry |year=2009 |quote=On 13 April 2005 Lord Jenkin met Sir Nigel, who apologised for the original reply. Lord Jenkin was left with the clear impression from their subsequent conversation that all the files bearing upon the issue of contaminated blood products had been destroyed, and that this had been done 'with intent, in order to draw a line under the disaster'.|url=http://www.archercbbp.com/files/report/76_Lord%20Archer%20Report.DOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another handling error is described in the inquiry: "mishandling of documents arose in connection with a number of files relating to the Advisory Committee on the Virological Safety of Blood between May 1989 and February 1992 which were found to be missing". The report went on to state: "They were in fact destroyed over a period from July 1994 to March 1998". When summarising these events it is stated "some of those who gave evidence to us suspected that there was an exercise in suppressing evidence of negligence or misconduct."

== 2015 - Scottish Penrose Inquiry ==
{{Main|Penrose Inquiry}}

In 2008 the Scottish government announced [[Penrose Inquiry|a public inquiry]] into the scandal covering Scotland only, to be chaired by [[George William Penrose, Lord Penrose|Lord Penrose]]. The inquiry's terms of reference outlined five deaths that were to be examined, but only one of those victims was a haemophiliac and that person had been infected with hepatitis C in the 1960s, before the factor concentrates were introduced.

Published in 2015, the inquiry was described as a [[Whitewashing (censorship)|whitewash]] and waste of public money (over £12 million) by critics after it made just one recommendation and failed to apportion any blame in the scandal. Its recommendation was to offer blood tests to anyone in Scotland who had a blood transfusion before 1991 and who had not already been tested for hepatitis C.

== 2017 - Legal Action &amp; UK Public inquiry ==

In July 2017 a group legal action ''"Jason Evans &amp; Ors"'' was brought against the government on behalf of more than 500 people by [http://www.collinslaw.co.uk/contaminated--blood-next-stages.php#hcglo Collins Solicitors].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Momentum in Contaminated Blood Scandal grows as Collins apply for a Group Litigation Order - Collins Solicitors Press Release dated 4 July 2017|url=http://www.collinslaw.co.uk/post.php?s=2017-07-04-momentum-in-contaminated-blood-scandal-grows-as-collins-apply-for-a-group-litigation-order-collins-solicitors-press-release-dated-4-july-2017|website=www.collinslaw.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITV News - Families seek justice in Blood Scandal - 4th July 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vCLXW4Mm5o|date=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After years of increasing pressure from campaigners and [[Member of parliament|MP]]s, Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] announced a full UK-wide public inquiry into the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|last1=Walker|first1=Peter|last2=Topping|first2=Alexandra|title=Theresa May orders contaminated blood scandal inquiry|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jul/11/contaminated-blood-scandal-theresa-may-orders-inquiry|journal=The Guardian|date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-40601013|title=Blood probe 'lessons must be learned'|journal=BBC News|date=14 July 2017|accessdate=4 December 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017 a court ruling found in favour of the victims allowing them to launch a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] action to seek damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41406105|title=Victims win contaminated blood ruling|date=26 September 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=26 September 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/news/uk/victims-and-families-can-bring-high-court-action-on-contaminated-blood-products/|title=Victims and families can bring High Court action on contaminated blood products - Evening Express|date=26 September 2017|work=Evening Express|access-date=26 September 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2017-09-26/victims-and-families-win-high-court-ruling-to-seek-damages-over-contaminated-blood-products/|title=Victims and families win High Court ruling to seek damages over contaminated blood products|work=ITV News|access-date=26 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2018 - False Ministerial Statements Withdrawn ==

In June 2018 the Department of Health issued an apology, because for 2 years Ministers had told Parliament that in relation to Contaminated Blood Scandal evidence; “All documents up to 1995 are available through the National Archive”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blood: Contamination:Written question - 65851 |url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2017-02-27/65851/ |website=UK Parliament |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government Support ==

Successive governments, both [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], have been criticised for their handling of the case, limited support schemes and refusal to conduct a public inquiry (until 2017). Some limited support has been provided to selected individuals through [[charitable trust]]s&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; which is often subject to [[means test]]ing, though no damages or compensation have ever been paid to UK victims or their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harpin|first1=Lee|title=Victims of contaminated blood scandal weren't given Tory compensation|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/victims-contaminated-blood-scandal-werent-10854692|website=mirror|date=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In the urgent question on 16...: 21 Jan 2016: House of Commons debates - TheyWorkForYou|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2016-01-21b.1583.1|website=TheyWorkForYou|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 the Conservative government made £42 million available to those affected by HIV,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2014-10-20/211081/|title=Blood: Contamination:Written question - 211081|website=UK Parliament|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; this equates to around £29,000 on average between the 1,437 people who received a payment. By 1996 the majority of HIV victims were dead.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

In 2017 the Conservatives announced more funds for those with first-stage chronic hepatitis C, but this additional money was reportedly to be sourced from funds for other tainted blood victims. The Department of Health was accused of robbing one set of victims to pay another. Officials stated that it had made available an extra £125 million, more than any previous government, but critics said this money was simply accounted for as a cost to the NHS of extending treatments to hepatitis C sufferers sooner.&lt;ref name=PE1440&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=24 March 2017 |title=What a Hunt |url= |magazine=[[Private Eye]] |location=London |publisher=Pressdram Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cumulative dose''' is the total dose resulting from repeated exposures of [[ionizing radiation]] to an occupationally exposed worker to the same portion of the body, or to the whole body, over a period of time.

In medicine, the total amount of a drug or radiation given to a patient over time; for example, the total dose of radiation given in a series of radiation treatments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4423">'''E-NABLE''' is a distributed, [[Open-source model|Open Source]] community that creates and shares open source designs for assistive devices. It is known for creating the first [[3D printing|3D printable]] prosthetic hand and sharing the designs and code for bioelectric limbs.

== History ==
In 2011, [[Ivan Owen]] created a metal, functional puppet hand for a [[Steampunk]] costume. After posting a video of the hand on YouTube, he was contacted by South African carpenter Richard Van As who had lost his fingers in a woodworking accident. Owen and Van As worked on prototypes of a prosthetic hand, before Owen decided to incorporate 3D printing into the design process. This led to the creation of the first 3D printed mechanical hand.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://enablingthefuture.org/about/|title=ABOUT US|date=2014-01-15|work=Enabling The Future|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sharing of the design of this hand on an [[Open licenses|Open License]] led to the creation of the community. 

The e-NABLE community "started with around 100 or so people who were simply offering to print the files that were already in existence".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Chapters of the organisation exist in many countries, and each works in different ways. For example, one Canadian chapter recycles excess plastic waste to create the prosthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://3dprint.com/228565/halifax-e-nable-branch-recycling-plastic-weed-container-lids-into-3d-printed-prosthetic-limbs/|title=Halifax e-NABLE Branch Recycling Plastic Weed Container Lids into 3D Printed Prosthetic Limbs {{!}} 3DPrint.com {{!}} The Voice of 3D Printing / Additive Manufacturing|website=3dprint.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chapter in Aden, Yemen, is producing prosthetic hands for people injured in Yemen's civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://enablingthefuture.org/2018/01/02/e-nabling-aden-yemen/|title=e-NABLING Aden – Yemen|date=2018-01-02|work=Enabling The Future|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Open Source nature of the project is enabling diverse groups around the world to create prosthetics for people within their own communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://buffalonews.com/2018/10/27/three-western-new-york-students-receive-prosthetic-hands-designed-for-them-by-other-kids/|title=Three WNY students receive prosthetic hands designed for them by other kids|date=2018-10-27|work=The Buffalo News|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Colombian engineer called Christian Silva has created superhero-themed prosthetic arms for children. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://3dprint.com/120465/iron-man-e-nable-hand/|title=Three Year Old Gets His Own Iron Man e-NABLE Prosthetic Hand {{!}} 3DPrint.com {{!}} The Voice of 3D Printing / Additive Manufacturing|website=3dprint.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, an [[Iron Man]]-themed arm created by Albert Menero was given to a child by Iron Man actor [[Robert Downey Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Microsoft Office 365|title=The Collective Project: Robert Downey Jr. Delivers a Real Bionic Arm|date=2015-03-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEx5lmbCKtY|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==
The E-nable website contains a tool called the “Handomatic,” which is used to fit prosthetic hands according to the measurements of the individual recipient. The tool then creates a custom design which can then be downloaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/17/science/hand-of-a-superhero.html?linked=facebook|title=Hand of a Superhero|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:England Bus Pass Example.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The new English National Concessionary Bus Travel Scheme bus pass]]
The '''English National Concessionary Travel Scheme''' is a national scheme by the [[Department for Transport]] in conjunction with local authorities across [[England]].

The scheme extended the provision of free bus travel within individual local authorities to allow travel throughout England from 1 April 2008.&lt;ref name="dft_leg"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/topics/public-transport/buses/concessionary-bus-travel|title=Concessionary bus travel|accessdate=2012-10-01|publisher=Department for Transport}}&lt;/ref&gt; English residents who have attained the state pension age for women, which is gradually being increased from 60 to 66, as well as eligible disabled people, are provided with free off-peak bus travel on weekdays and all day at weekends and [[Bank Holiday]]s. Certain local authorities offer extra benefits for use within their area. Comparable schemes operate within Wales and Scotland.

There are two types of concessionary pass.  The Senior pass has a blue panel at the right hand side of the pass.  A disabled person's pass has an orange panel.&lt;ref name="DOTGuide"&gt; [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/3621/travelconcession.pdf Guidance for travel concession authorities on the England national concessionary travel scheme]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}

A Senior pass is valid between 09:30 and 23:00 on weekdays and at any time at weekends and public holidays&lt;ref name=DOTGuide/&gt;{{rp|7}} The pass is valid at all times on TfL operated bus services for journeys within Greater London or those that begin or end in Greater London.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/adult-discounts-and-concessions/freedom-pass?intcmp=1742&lt;/ref&gt;  An accessibility pass has the same statutory validity, but some authorities allow disabled persons to travel at additional times.&lt;ref name=DOTGuide/&gt;{{rp|12}}  Both types of pass are valid throughout England only.&lt;ref name=DOTGuide/&gt;{{rp|7}}  Additionally some authorities allow qualifying  holders of an accessibility pass to be accompanied by a companion who is entitled to free travel when and while accompanying the pass holder.  This scheme is not nationwide and consequently the companion can only accompany the disabled person within the administrative area of the pass issuer and the area of any other authority that accepts a companion pass from other areas.&lt;ref name=DOTGuide/&gt;{{rp|11}}  Issuing authorities identify the accessibility pass as a companion pass with a "C+" in the top right corner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.surreycc.gov.uk/roads-and-transport/buses-and-trains/bus-tickets-passes-and-travel-discounts/free-bus-passes-for-seniors-and-disabled-people/criteria-to-qualify-for-a-disabled-persons-bus-pass SCC Concession Scheme FAQ Question 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand Swedish|Mensskydd|date=September 2011}}
'''Feminine hygiene''' products (also called '''menstrual hygiene products''') are [[personal care]] products used by women during [[menstruation]], [[vaginal discharge]], and other bodily functions related to the [[vulva]] and [[vagina]].

These products are either disposable or reusable. [[Sanitary napkin]]s ([[American English]]) or sanitary towels ([[British English]]), [[tampon]]s, and [[pantiliner]]s are disposable feminine hygiene products.  [[Menstrual cups]], cloth menstrual pads and [[period panties]] are the major categories of reusable feminine hygiene products&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicole|first=Wendee|date=2014-3|title=A Question for Women's Health: Chemicals in Feminine Hygiene Products and Personal Lubricants |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=122|issue=3|pages=A70–A75|doi=10.1289/ehp.122-A70 |pmc=3948026|pmid=24583634}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Products meant to "cleanse" the area of the vulva or inside of the vagina, such as feminine deodorants, [[douche]], feminine powders, feminine soaps, and feminine wipes have also been described as "feminine hygiene" products. These products may lead to allergic reaction and irritation as the vagina naturally flushes out bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/feminine-hygiene.html|title=Feeling Fresh|website=kidshealth.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many health professionals advise against douching because it can change the balance of vaginal flora and acidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/douching|title=Douching {{!}} Womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
{{Main|Culture and menstruation}}

In low-income countries, women's choices of menstrual hygiene materials are often limited by the costs, availability and social norms.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2014). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2213 Puberty Education &amp; Menstrual Hygiene Management - Good Policy and Practice in health Education - Booklet 9]. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Paris, France, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs and tax===
{{see|Tampon tax}}

Tampon tax is a shorthand for sales tax charged on tampons, pads and menstrual cups. The cost of these commercial products for menstrual management is considered to be unacceptably high for many low-income women. At least half a million women across the world do not have enough money to adequately afford these products. This can result in missing school or even dropping out. Several initiatives worldwide advocate to eliminate the tax all together. In some countries, such petitions have already been successful (for example parts of the UK and the United States).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/could-this-be-the-first-country-to-end-period-poverty/ar-AAw1fu4|title=Could this be the first country to end 'period poverty'?|work=www.msn.com|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://conservativeeurope.com/news/mobarik-uk-a-step-closer-to-ending-the-tampon-tax|title=Mobarik: UK one step closer to ending the tampon tax|author=Nosheena Mobarik|date=3 October 2018|work=Conservatives in the European Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/04/18/scotland-end-period-poverty-tampon-tax/502020002/|title=Women get their periods every month — and it's incredibly expensive|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people believe the tampon tax should be abolished because tampons are a necessity for women. They consider the tax discriminatory because things like prescription drugs and condoms are not taxed. Lawmakers around the country have started to take notice. Many have taken measures to exempt menstrual hygiene products from the sales tax. Some lawmakers have even succeeded. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.mctproxy.mnpals.net|title=Bleeding Women Dry: Tampon Taxes and Menstrual Inequity|last=Ooi|first=Jorene|date=2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to products in prisons===
The Federal bureau of Prisons in the [[United States]] announced that women in its facilities would be guaranteed free menstrual pads and tampons. In section 411 of the First Step Act which was passed on May 22, 2018 states, "The Director of the Bureau of Prisons shall make the healthcare products described in subsection (c) available to prisoners for free, in a quantity that is appropriate to the healthcare needs of each prisoner"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5682/text#toc-H2AA5480F32E04078BF96E84FE829FB76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the lack of a [[birth certificate]], her true age could not be reliably established.

==Claim of old age==
Fulla Nayak, who lived in [[Kanarpur]], a village in the Indian state of [[Odisha]], rose to prominence in November 2006, only a few days prior to her death. ''[[The Times of India]]'' and the [[Indo-Asian News Service]] reported that Nayak's then 72-year-old grandson aimed at having his grandmother's alleged age of 125 acknowledged by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', which would make her the oldest woman to have ever lived.&lt;ref name=ttn&gt;{{cite news|last=Senapati|first=Ashis|title=At 120, a place in Guinness?|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-11-13/india/27816937_1_guinness-book-oldest-person-oldest-woman|accessdate=7 September 2013|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=13 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dna1&gt;{{cite news|title=Orissa woman at 125 among oldest in India|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/oddnews/1064047/report-orissa-woman-at-125-among-oldest-in-india|accessdate=7 September 2013|newspaper=[[Daily News and Analysis]]|date=14 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news|last=Karan|first=Jajati|title=Oldest lady in Orissa is 'Fulla' life|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/oldest-lady-in-orissa-is-fulla-life/26300-3.html|accessdate=7 September 2013|newspaper=[[CNN-IBN]]|date=16 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, two of Fulla Nayak's four daughters were still alive,&lt;ref name=dna2/&gt; aged 80 and 92, respectively.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;

According to her voters' ID{{specify|date=September 2013}} (which had been issued in 1995), Fulla Nayak died aged 120.&lt;ref name=dna2/&gt; As a birth certificate could not be provided,&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; there were no authoritative means to determine her age, so that the supposed record was not accepted.

==Drug use icon==
In the ''Times of India'' portrait of Fulla Nayak, it was reported that she was drinking [[palm wine]] and smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|ganja]] and [[beedi]]s on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=ttn/&gt; This story was picked up and spread worldwide, turning it into a supportive anecdote for [[drug liberalization]] campaigners that is used until today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=125 Jahre alte Frau sagte, Cannabis wäre ihr Altersgeheimnis|url=http://www.hanfplantage.de/125-jahre-alte-frau-sagte-cannabis-altersgeheimnis-08-07-2011|accessdate=7 September 2013|language=German|date=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' ''Having a Great Birth in Australia'' ''' is the second book from [[Australian]] writer [[David Vernon (writer)|David Vernon]].

The book is an edited [[anthology]] of [[childbirth|birth]] experiences, that demonstrate that birth can be a positive, life-affirming event, and that it need not, with the right support, be the trauma that the media often suggests childbirth is.  The experiences described are diverse, ranging from [[caesarean]] births and [[Vaginal Birth After Caesarean|VBAC]] births, to births that take place at [[homebirth|home]] and in a [[birth centre]] or [[labour ward]]. All of the mothers in this book chose to have their birth care provided by an individual midwife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Having a Great Birth in Australia |url= http://www.aims.org.uk/Journal/Vol19No2/bookReviews.htm#3 |department= Book reviews |author= Adela Stockton |journal= AIMS Journal |publisher= Association for Improvements in the Maternity Services |volume= 19 |issue= 2 |year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These stories express the experiential aspects of childbirth and are used to educate midwives.&lt;ref name="FahyFoureur2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kathleen Fahy|author2=Maralyn Foureur|author3=Carolyn Hastie|title=Birth Territory and Midwifery Guardianship: Theory for Practice, Education and Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XpLJ7P-OS0C&amp;pg=PA42|accessdate=30 August 2013|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-7506-8870-3|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a description of a [[miscarriage]] and a [[stillbirth]] and the stories explain how the women managed to overcome their feelings of grief at the event.

This book set the style and content for Vernon's subsequent book, ''[[Men at Birth]]'' which describes men's experience of birth.

The '''Healthiest State in the Nation Campaign''', is a statewide effort started in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state in the United States in 2004 by the Washington Health Foundation (WHF), a [[non-partisan]], [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Seattle]], with the mission of improving health for the people of the state.

Launched on September 18, 2004, the campaign encourages improvement in six action areas by educating and engaging leaders, policymakers, businesses and the public through its interactive website at HealthiestState.org and many events throughout the year.  By emphasizing the promotion of personal responsibility and building of collective actions that make healthy choices easy, the campaign seeks to achieve the ultimate goal of moving Washington's health rank to number one.&lt;ref name=website&gt;[http://www.HealthiestState.org, Washington Health Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2004, the Healthiest State Campaign has become the largest [[civic engagement]] campaign for health in Washington state history, involving more than 40,000 individual champions, 1,300 businesses and organizations and 400 schools.&lt;ref name=website&gt;[http://www.HealthiestState.org, Washington Health Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
When Washington's rank in the America's Health Rankings 2003 national report dropped out of the top ten,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitedhealthfoundation.org/download/UHC_037304_book.pdf America's Health: State Health Rankings – A Call to Action for People &amp; Their Communities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], United Health Foundation, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; the Washington Health Foundation (WHF) channeled its efforts toward leading a major health reform in the state.&lt;ref name=article&gt;[http://www.unitedhealthfoundation.org/ahr2006/2006ahr.pdf America's Health Rankings: A Call to Action for People &amp; Their Communities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], United Health Foundation, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community Roundtables===
After completing a series of polling, WHF found that Washington citizens wanted to be more involved in changing the health care system, viewing it as a shared responsibility with the government and the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Community Roundtables | newspaper=[http://www.ritzvillejournal.com/ Ritzville-Adams County Journal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]|date = May 22, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WHF addressed these findings by holding Community Roundtables in every [[County (United States)|county]] of Washington, fostering discussion between public and private leaders, organizations, businesses, advocacy groups and local citizens on their common health values.&lt;ref name=article&gt;[http://www.unitedhealthfoundation.org/ahr2006/2006ahr.pdf America's Health Rankings: A Call to Action for People &amp; Their Communities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], United Health Foundation, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the span of three months, the Community Roundtables resulted in 44 meetings, 1,200 people participating and 10,000 individual responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Gardner | first1 = Cara| title = Prepping for surgery | newspaper=[http://www.inlander.com/, The Pacific Northwest Inlander&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] |date = November 6, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WHF then had a researcher from the [[University of Washington]] analyze and condense these responses.  The result yielded nine "Key Values" – ideas of importance to the public regarding the health care system:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = The Nine Commandments | newspaper=[http://www.inlander.com/, The Pacific Northwest Inlander&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] |date = November 6, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a direct outgrowth of the Community Roundtables and its subsequent research, WHF coordinated the Washington Health Leadership Summit, calling together both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] elected officials, business leaders, citizen action groups, health and health care policymakers and concerned individuals to determine the common values that would serve as the basis for an improved health system.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Chelan, Manson reps attend health summit | newspaper=[http://lakechelanmirror.com/ Lake Chelan Mirror&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] |date = December 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two-day event was held on October 27–28, 2003 at the Seattle [[Seahawks Stadium]] where the nine "Key Values" were presented and then prioritized via instant electronic voting after extensive discussion.  In addition to the nine "Key Values", Summit participants agreed upon adding a 10th value – to educate and engage the people of Washington state on these issues surrounding health care improvement.&lt;ref name=article&gt;[http://www.unitedhealthfoundation.org/ahr2006/2006ahr.pdf America's Health Rankings: A Call to Action for People &amp; Their Communities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], United Health Foundation, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

These ten values formed the foundation of the Washington Health Leadership Resolution calling on Washington leaders to "set aside special interests and partisan differences" and work together to design a health care system based on the values adopted at the Summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Health summit draws local leaders | newspaper=[http://www.thedailyworld.com/ The Daily World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] |date = November 6, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Signed by more than 250 Washington leaders including Washington Governor [[Gary Locke]], Democratic and Republican state legislators and King County Executive [[Ron Sims]], the Resolution and its Values lay the groundwork for the creation of the Healthiest State Campaign.&lt;ref name=article&gt;[http://www.unitedhealthfoundation.org/ahr2006/2006ahr.pdf America's Health Rankings: A Call to Action for People &amp; Their Communities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], United Health Foundation, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Campaign==
To educate and engage the people of Washington state on health issues, the Healthiest State in the Nation Campaign was created as a long-term civic engagement effort.  Using the United Health Foundation's America's Health Rankings model as a guide, the Healthiest State Campaign was developed around six action areas, each with two health measures used in determining the state's health rank.   The campaign aimed to improve these areas through civic engagement all the while emphasizing the importance of both personal responsibility and collective action in making Washington the Healthiest State.

===Healthiest State Campaign's launch and beyond===
On September 18, 2004, Washington Governor Gary Locke helped launch the Healthiest State in the Nation Campaign, proclaiming the date "Washington Health Day."  With the launch, the entirety of Washington's Congressional Delegation became the first official endorsers of the campaign.&lt;ref name=article&gt;[http://www.unitedhealthfoundation.org/ahr2006/2006ahr.pdf America's Health Rankings: A Call to Action for People &amp; Their Communities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], United Health Foundation, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, WHF developed a web data system to more effectively engage the Washington public in the Healthiest State Campaign.  The newly developed system played a prominent role in the first Governor's Health Bowl, a statewide event sponsored by WHF and led by Washington's new Governor, [[Christine Gregoire]].&lt;ref name=article&gt;[http://www.unitedhealthfoundation.org/ahr2006/2006ahr.pdf America's Health Rankings: A Call to Action for People &amp; Their Communities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], United Health Foundation, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was kicked off by Governor Christine Gregoire's challenge to the Washington state public to earn One Million Miles of health.  More than 17,000 individuals, 300 organizations and 115 schools took on the challenge by logging their miles of physical activity at WHF's website.&lt;ref name=article&gt;[http://www.unitedhealthfoundation.org/ahr2006/2006ahr.pdf America's Health Rankings: A Call to Action for People &amp; Their Communities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], United Health Foundation, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The campaign website at HealthiestState.org also awarded additional points to those who correctly answered questions about health systems in Washington.  That year, Washington state moved up one from 15th to 14th in the 2005 edition of America's Health Rankings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitedhealthfoundation.org/shr2005/ahr05_email.pdf America's Health Rankings: A Call to Action for People &amp; Their Communities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], United Health Foundation, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

2005 also marked the launch of the Healthiest State Campaign's quarterly magazine, ''thrive!''.  Distributed through the state's Health Care Authority in libraries, universities, schools and hospitals, the magazine's circulation at its launch was 150,000 statewide.  thrive! provides readers with resources and ideas to "encourage healthier lifestyles and systems" as well as highlighting the success stories of those impacting Washington health.  Past issues have featured local celebrities like Suzy Preston, a winner on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Biggest Loser]]'' and Seattle Seahawk [[Shaun Alexander]].&lt;ref name=article&gt;[http://www.unitedhealthfoundation.org/ahr2006/2006ahr.pdf America's Health Rankings: A Call to Action for People &amp; Their Communities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], United Health Foundation, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign began to actively embark upon the political and policy aspects of health in 2006, developing a Healthiest State priority list andrking with the Washington State Legislature to produce laws and policies to improve Washington health.&lt;ref name=article&gt;[http://www.unitedhealthfoundation.org/ahr2006/2006ahr.pdf America's Health Rankings: A Call to Action for People &amp; Their Communities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], United Health Foundation, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  To streamline the action in all realms of the campaign, WHF released the 2006 Report Card on Washington's Health, assessing Washington's rank in 18 health measures and outcomes which were heavily derived from America's Health Rankings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whf.org/HSIN/Outcomes.aspx, Washington Health Foundation – Outcomes and Measures&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the 2006 Report Card quickly permeated all branches of the campaign, its measures becoming the focus of the 2006 Governor's Health Bowl.  Different from its previous year, the 2006 Health Bowl became a six-week event, included a 2.5 Million Mile challenge from Governor Gregoire and featured its first ever Healthiest Business Challenge sponsored by the Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce and the Spokane Chamber of Commerce.  But the 2006 Health Bowl also retained many of its original features such as the Healthiest School Challenge, where schools across the state strove to be the school with the most miles logged.  Along with stressing the importance of physical activity, the reach of the 2006 Health Bowl broadened to highlight systemic changes that the community could take to improve Washington's health rank.  With its growing numbers in participation and partnering organizations, the annual Health Bowl quickly became the Healthiest State Campaign's signature event.

Throughout the remainder of the year, the Healthiest State Campaign has worked to address the many measures of the Report Card with events like the Heroes of Health Gala, the New Year's Resolution Challenge, the Healthy Schools Summit, the Latina Health Fair and the Spring training Challenge, all working to engage and educate the Washington public on matters of health.  In 2007, Washington state's health rank climbed to 12th from 15th in America's Health Rankings, becoming one of five states to earn the title of "most improved state."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Black | first1 = Cherie | title = State struggling with obesity, but rises to 12th healthiest | newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date = November 5, 2007 | url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/338393_healthrank06.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, Washington claimed a spot in the top ten, ranking 10th in WHF's 2008 Report Card.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Black | first1 = Cherie | title = To your health: Washington is in the top 10 again | newspaper = Seattle Post-Intelligencer | date = June 13, 2008 | url = http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/toyourhealth/archives/141063.asp | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614083914/http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/toyourhealth/archives/141063.asp | archivedate = June 14, 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthiest State xChange===
The Washington Health Foundation's Healthiest State in the Nation Campaign unveiled its latest health innovation at the start of 2011 – the '''Healthiest State xChange'''. The Healthiest State xChange offers a different approach to health insurance. One that is motivated by health, not profit.

The Healthiest State xChange is a new service designed to help individuals and businesses navigate health insurance while also directly improving the health of the people of Washington. And here's the best part – it won’t cost a dime in extra money.

The premise is simple. Insurance broker fees are already built into the premium that most people (living in Washington state) pay for their health insurance, whether they know it or not. These broker fees, included in Community Rated Insurance Plans, are approved by the state. The Washington Health Foundation believes that it can use this money in a way that not only provides greater value to people buying health insurance, but also benefits the health of people across our state.

As people assign the Washington Health Foundation as their broker of record, they can be assured that their hard-earned money will not disappear into the system. Instead – WHF will use the fees to help people make better health coverage decisions, and will build a bridge that connects people and their families to a healthier lifestyle. Part of this service will be providing clients with personalized assistance as they build a [http://whf.org/my-health/tools Health Home] – a unique set of tools that empower people to take control over their health decisions.

[[File:Candy Stripers in training in Tallahassee, Florida (9932666936).jpg|thumb|Candy stripers in training in [[Tallahassee, Florida]], 1957.]]
'''Hospital volunteers''', also known as '''candy stripers''', work without [[salary|regular pay]] in a variety of [[health care]] settings, usually under the direct supervision of [[nurses]].

The term candy striper is derived from the red-and-white striped [[pinafores]] that female volunteers traditionally wore in the [[United States]], and are culturally reminiscent of [[candy canes]]. The term and its associated uniform are less frequently used in current clinical settings.

Another hospital volunteer organization sponsored by the American Red Cross, was the "Blue Teens" who wore blue-and-white striped pinafores.  The female adult volunteers of this organization were known as "Grey Ladies" and wore light grey uniforms.

In the United States, volunteers' services are of considerable importance to individual patients as well as the [[health care system]] in general.  Some people volunteer during [[High school (North America)|high school]] or [[college]] (and more rarely at the [[middle school]] level), out of curiosity about health-care [[profession]]s, an interest in learning to be of service in a community volunteer organization, or in order to satisfy [[Community service#High school graduation and Community Service|community service]] requirements as required by some schools. Additionally, other people choose to volunteer at later stages in their life, particularly after [[retirement]].

==History==
Candy Stripers originated as a high-school civics class project in [[East Orange, New Jersey]], in 1944. The uniforms were sewn by the girls in the class from material provided by the teacher &amp;ndash; a red-and-white-striped fabric known as "[[Candy stripe (fabric)|candy stripe]]". The students chose East Orange General Hospital as the home for their class project.&lt;ref&gt;Oral History with Adele Marie McCain, née Huck, a student in the class, October 1986{{OR|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=Volunteer Opportunities
| url=http://www.evh.org/dyn/_volunteering.aspx
| work=East Orange General Hospital
| date=2008
| location=East Orange, New Jersey
| accessdate=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Blue Teens" and "Grey Ladies" were also hospital volunteer organizations sponsored by the American Red Cross. Blue Teens, usually high school age students, wore blue and white striped uniforms. The Grey Ladies wore solid light grey uniforms.  Red Cross pins and patches were also worn on the uniforms indicating completion of required Red Cross training.

Usually a hospital sponsored either Candy Striper or Blue Teen volunteers but not both.

==Duties==
Duties of hospital volunteers vary widely depending upon the facility.  Volunteers may work in staff reception areas and gift shops; file and retrieve documents and mails; take out trash; clean; provide administrative backup; assist with research by following strict sterilizing procedures for laboratory glass and plasticware, known as autoclaving; help visitors; visit with patients; or transport various small items like flowers, medical records, lab specimens, and drugs from unit to unit. Some hospitals even utilize volunteers to cuddle newborn babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| url=https://www.drbarbaraedwards.com/volunteering-with-babies-in-the-hospital/
| date=2018
| accessdate=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few hospitals ask their volunteers to help out with janitorial duties, such as stripping and remaking beds with clean linens.  Other "advanced volunteers" include patient-care liaisons and volunteer orderlies.  These volunteers must operate on the orders of a nurse or a physician and are given special training to permit them to work with patients. They are also more common in large hospitals, particularly university-affiliated hospitals and teaching hospitals, as they allow pre-medical students to gain experience in patient care by taking pressure off a busy care team.

Some hospitals manage their volunteers from a dispersal unit and assign them to tasks based on real-time labor demands, while other hospitals assign volunteers to a single unit for the duration of their service. Female volunteers traditionally wore pink-and-white jumpers, while male volunteers traditionally wore light-blue tunics or shirts over dark slacks. Today, male and female volunteers often wear a uniform shirt, [[polo shirt]] or some other short-sleeved shirt with slacks. Some volunteers (particularly "advanced volunteers") will wear [[Scrubs (clothing)|scrubs]], but this is usually avoided so volunteers are not confused with medical personnel. All volunteers wear ID tags within the hospital that prominently indicate the volunteer's status and position.

'''Hypertonia''' is a term sometimes used synonymously with '''spasticity and rigidity''' in the literature surrounding damage to the [[central nervous system]], namely upper motor neuron lesions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/hypertonia/hmypertonia.htm{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impaired ability of damaged [[motor neurons]] to regulate descending pathways gives rise to disordered [[Reflexes|spinal reflexes]], increased excitability of [[muscle spindles]], and decreased [[Synapsis|synaptic]] inhibition.&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan 2007 234"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Sullivan|first=Susan|title=Physical Rehabilitation|year=2007|publisher=F.A Davis Company|location=Philadelphia, PA|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; These consequences result in abnormally increased [[muscle tone]] of symptomatic muscles.&lt;ref name=pmid19769916&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sheean |first1=Geoffrey |last2=McGuire |first2=John R. |title=Spastic Hypertonia and Movement Disorders: Pathophysiology, Clinical Presentation, and Quantification |journal=PM&amp;R |volume=1 |issue=9 |pages=827–33 |year=2009 |pmid=19769916 |doi=10.1016/j.pmrj.2009.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors suggest that the current definition for spasticity, the velocity-dependent over-activity of the [[stretch reflex]], is not sufficient as it fails to take into account patients exhibiting increased muscle tone in the absence of stretch reflex over-activity. They instead suggest that "'''reversible hypertonia'''" is more appropriate and represents a treatable condition that is responsive to various therapy modalities like drug and/or physical therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bakheit |first1=AM |last2=Fheodoroff |first2=K |last3=Molteni |first3=F |title=Spasticity or reversible muscle hypertonia? |journal=Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=556–7 |year=2011 |pmid=21491075 |doi=10.2340/16501977-0817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms associated with central nervous systems disorders are classified into positive and negative categories. Positive symptoms include those that increase muscle activity through hyper-excitability of the stretch reflex (i.e., rigidity and spasticity) where negative symptoms include those of insufficient muscle activity (i.e. [[muscle weakness|weakness]]) and reduced motor function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sanger |first1=T. D. |last2=Chen |first2=D. |last3=Delgado |first3=M. R. |last4=Gaebler-Spira |first4=D. |last5=Hallett |first5=M. |last6=Mink |first6=J. W. |title=Definition and Classification of Negative Motor Signs in Childhood |journal=Pediatrics |volume=118 |issue=5 |pages=2159–67 |year=2006 |pmid=17079590 |doi=10.1542/peds.2005-3016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the two classifications are thought to be separate entities of a disorder; however, some authors propose that they may be closely related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Damiano |first1=Diane L |last2=Dodd |first2=Karen |title=Should we be testing and training muscle strength in cerebral palsy? |journal=Developmental Medicine &amp; Child Neurology |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=68–72 |year=2002 |pmid=11811654 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8749.2002.tb00262.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
Hypertonia is caused by [[upper motor neuron lesion]]s which may result from injury, disease, or conditions that involve damage to the central nervous system.  The lack of or decrease in upper motor neuron function leads to loss of inhibition with resultant hyperactivity of [[lower motor neuron]]s.  Different patterns of muscle weakness or hyperactivity can occur based on the location of the lesion, causing a multitude of neurological symptoms, including [[spasticity]], [[rigidity (neurology)|rigidity]], or [[dystonia]].&lt;ref name=pmid19769916/&gt;

Spastic hypertonia involves uncontrollable [[muscle spasms]], stiffening or straightening out of muscles, shock-like contractions of all or part of a group of muscles, and abnormal [[muscle tone]]. It is seen in disorders such as [[cerebral palsy]], [[stroke]], and [[spinal cord injury]].  Rigidity is a severe state of hypertonia where muscle resistance occurs throughout the entire range of motion of the affected joint independent of velocity. It is frequently associated with lesions of the [[basal ganglia]]. Individuals with rigidity present with stiffness, decreased range of motion and loss of motor control.  Dystonic hypertonia refers to muscle resistance to passive stretching (in which a therapist gently stretches the inactive contracted muscle to a comfortable length at very low speeds of movement) and a tendency of a limb to return to a fixed involuntary (and sometimes abnormal) posture following movement.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Management==
Therapeutic interventions are best individualized to particular patients.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Basic principles of treatment for hypertonia are to avoid noxious stimuli and provide frequent range of motion exercise.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Physical interventions===
[[Physical therapy|Physiotherapy]] has been shown to be effective in controlling hypertonia through the use of stretching aimed to reduce [[motor neuron]] excitability.&lt;ref name=chang&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chang |first1=Ya-Ju |last2=Fang |first2=Chia-Ying |last3=Hsu |first3=Miao-Ju |last4=Lien |first4=Hen-Yu |last5=Wong |first5=Mei-Kwan |title=Decrease of hypertonia after continuous passive motion treatment in individuals with spinal cord injury |journal=Clinical Rehabilitation |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=712–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17846071 |doi=10.1177/0269215507079137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of a physical therapy session could be to inhibit excessive tone as far as possible, give the patient a sensation of normal position and movement, and to facilitate normal movement patterns. While static stretch has been the classical means to increase range of motion, [[PNF stretching]] has been used in many clinical settings to effectively reduce muscle spasticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sharman |first1=Melanie J |last2=Cresswell |first2=Andrew G |last3=Riek |first3=Stephan |title=Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation Stretching |journal=Sports Medicine |volume=36 |issue=11 |pages=929–39 |year=2006 |pmid=17052131 |doi=10.2165/00007256-200636110-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Icing and other [[topical anesthetic]]s may decrease the reflexive activity for short period of time in order to facilitate motor function.  Inhibitory pressure (applying firm pressure over muscle tendon) and promoting body heat retention and rhythmic rotation (slow repeated rotation of affected body part to stimulate relaxation)&lt;ref name=text497&gt;{{cite book |last1=O'Sullivan |first1=Susan |year=2007 |title=Physical Rehabilitation |location=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=F.A Davis Company |page=497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have also been proposed as potential methods to decrease hypertonia.

===Pharmaceutical interventions===
[[Baclofen]], [[diazepam]] and [[dantrolene]] remain the three most commonly used pharmacologic agents in the treatment of spastic hypertonia.  Baclofen is generally the drug of choice for spinal cord types of spasticity, while sodium dantrolene is the only agent which acts directly on muscle tissue. [[Tizanidine]] is also available. [[Phenytoin]] with [[chlorpromazine]] may be potentially useful if sedation does not limit their use. [[Ketazolam]], not yet available in the United States, may be a significant addition to the pharmacologic set of options. [[Intrathecal]] administration of antispastic medications allows for high concentrations of drug near the site of action, which limits side effects.&lt;ref name="Katz, R. 1988"/&gt;

{{Criminal defenses}}

In [[criminal law]], the '''intoxication defense''' is a [[defense (legal)|defense]] by which a [[defendant]] may claim [[diminished responsibility]] on the basis of [[substance intoxication]]. Where a crime requires a certain mental state (''mens rea'') to break the law, those under the influence of an intoxicating substance may be considered to have reduced [[legal liability|liability]] for their actions. With regard to punishment, intoxication may be a [[mitigating factor]] that decreases a prison or jail sentence. Numerous factors affect the applicability of the defense.

==Variation==
[[Society|Societies]] have varied in their attitudes and [[Norm (social)|cultural standards]] regarding public [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], historically based on the relationship between [[religion and drugs]] in general, and [[religion and alcohol]] in particular. In some instances, consumption of a [[psychoactive drug|mind-altering substance]] has formed the basis of [[religion|religious]] or other socially approved ceremonies and festivals. In others, intoxication has been stigmatized as a sign of human weakness, of [[immorality]], or as a [[sin]]. Secular approaches may also vary, having less inherent opposition to drugs but acknowledging that these may affect the [[Social inhibition|inhibition]]s that help to keep socialized individuals from breaking prevailing social [[taboo]]s which may or may not have been expressly criminalized. The attitude of a legal system to intoxicating substances can affect the applicability of intoxication as a defense under its laws: a system strongly opposed to a substance may even view intoxication as an [[Aggravation (law)|aggravating factor]] rather than a mitigating one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Javed|first1=Azhar|title=Intoxication &amp; Self-defence: A Comparative Study of Principles of English Law and Shari'ah.|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/526/1/uk_bl_ethos_416550.pdf|website=White Rose eTheses Online|publisher=University of Leeds|accessdate=19 November 2016|pages=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of intoxication on criminal responsibility varies by [[Jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]] and offense. The [[criminal code]] in question may require proof of various levels of intent. This may range from [[malice aforethought|premeditation]], through various degrees of intent or willingness to commit a crime, general recklessness, and finally no intent at all in some instances of [[strict liability (criminal)|strict liability]]. Intoxication may serve as a defense against proving more specific forms of intent. If so, its potential effectiveness will sometimes hinge on whether the defendant's intoxication was ''voluntary'' or ''involuntary'': the defense would be denied defendants who had voluntarily disabled themselves by knowingly consuming an intoxicating substances, but allowed to those who had consumed it unknowingly or against their will.

==Voluntary and involuntary consumption==
A distinction may be made based on whether the defendant chose to become intoxicated, and is thus responsible for their diminished control, or not. As an example, in the so-called [[Dutch courage]] defense (see the [[Intoxication_in_English_law#Dutch_courage|Gallagher case in English law on intoxication]]) the accused hates his spouse but fears to take action. The accused therefore buys a bottle of [[brandy]] and a sharp knife. In the morning, the bottle is empty and the knife is in the spouse's heart. Because the accused had a plan and [[Liquid courage|weakening the inhibitions by drunkenness]] was a part of that plan, an intoxication defense is not feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A-G for N. Ireland v. Gallagher [1963] AC 349|url=http://e-lawresources.co.uk/Intoxication.php|website=E-law cases|publisher=e-lawresources.co.uk|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But if, at a party, a bowl of fruit punch is "spiked" by someone who secretly adds [[gin]], the resulting drunkenness is not voluntary and might be considered a possible defense. A sharper distinction is drawn in [[Sharia|Islamic law]], where involuntary intoxication may remove criminal if not financial responsibility, while voluntary intoxication has no effect and the accused is treated as if sober.&lt;ref name="Islamic Law"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Javed|first1=Azhar|title=Intoxication &amp; Self-defence: A Comparative Study of Principles of English Law and Shari'ah.|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/526/1/uk_bl_ethos_416550.pdf|website=White Rose eTheses Online|publisher=University of Leeds|accessdate=19 November 2016|pages=241-242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreseeability test===
The presence or absence of liability may hang on a foreseeability test. The fact that the consumption of alcohol or the ingestion of drugs may cause a loss of control is well known. Thus, anyone who knowingly consumes is, at the very least, [[recklessness (law)|reckless]] as to the possibility of losing control. If they did not wish to lose control, they would not consume, so loss of control must be within the scope of their intention by continuing to consume. But, loss of control is not instantaneous and without symptoms. The issue of involuntary consumption is therefore contentious. In most legal systems, involuntary loss of control is limited to cases where there is no real loss of control with noticeable symptoms. Thus, for example, in many states, the blood alcohol level for the commission of the offence of [[driving under the influence]] is set sufficiently low that people might exceed the limit without realising that they had consumed enough alcohol to do so. Leaving aside the issue that, in some states, this is a [[strict liability]] offense excluding drunkenness as a defense, there is usually a requirement that the person who "spiked" the drinks be prosecuted in place of the driver. This reflects the fact that the commission of a crime has been procured by the actions of secretly adding the alcohol and the practical fact that without this rule, too many accused who are only marginally over the limit, might be encouraged to blame others for their intoxication. 

In the US, the [[Model Penal Code]] also includes the possibility of "pathological intoxication" whereby a medical condition allows a small amount of alcohol to causes disproportionate intoxication that the drinker could not foresee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Law: Intoxication|url=https://nationalparalegal.edu/public_documents/courseware_asp_files/criminalLaw/defenses/Intoxication.asp|website=National Paralegal College|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, the defense would be denied to people experiencing symptoms of intoxication who continued to consume the spiked drink because they ought to have known what was happening to them. Equally, if no further consumption occurred but they ought to have recognized that they were affected by an unknown substance, beginning an activity such as driving would not fall within the defense. In other words, the policy underpinning the operation of the law favors the protection of the public as against the interests of an individual who recklessly or with wilful blindness exposes the public to danger.

==Offenses of basic and of specific intent==
In some states, a distinction is based on the nature of the ''mens rea'' requirement. While voluntary intoxication may not be a defense to an offense of basic (sometimes termed "general") intent, it is allowed as a defense to offenses requiring a ''specific intent''. This term refers to two separate types of offense:
#A limited number of offenses require a further element of intent beyond the ''basic intent'' (where the ''mens rea'' is no more than the intentional or reckless commission of the ''[[actus reus]]''). This additional element is termed ''specific intent''.&lt;ref name="Rubin 1993 pages 3 &amp; 4"&gt;Rubin (1993) The Voluntary Intoxication Defense AOJ Bulletin IOG. pages 3 &amp; 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[inchoate offenses]] such as attempt, solicitation, and conspiracy require specific intent in a slightly different sense. The test for the existence of ''mens rea'' may be:
::(a) subjective where the court must be satisfied that the accused actually had the requisite mental element present in his or her mind at the relevant time (see [[concurrence]]);
::(b) objective where the requisite ''mens rea'' element is [[imputation (law)|imputed]] to the accused on the basis that the [[reasonable person]] would have had the mental element in the same circumstances;
::(c) hybrid where the test is both subjective and objective.
:The rationale for the existence of criminal laws is as a deterrent to those who represent a danger to society. If an accused has actually committed the full offence, the reality of the danger has been demonstrated. But, where the commission of the ''actus reus'' is in the future, a clear subjective intention to cause the ''actus reus'' of the full offense must be demonstrated. Without this "specific intent", there is insufficient evidence that the accused is the clear danger as feared because, at any time before the commission of the full offense, the accused may change his or her mind and not continue.
If a "specific intent" in either sense is required and there is clear evidence that the accused was too intoxicated to form the element subjectively, this fact is recognised as a defense unless the loss of control was part of the plan. But this is of little value to defendants since there are almost always offenses of basic intent that can be charged and/or the basic intent offenses are usually [[lesser included offense]]s and an alternative verdict can be delivered by judge or [[jury]] without the need for a separate charge. In [[English law]], note the controversial ''Jaggard v Dickinson'' [1980] 3 All ER 716 which held that, for the purposes of the statutory defense of ''lawful excuse'' under s5 [[Criminal Damage Act 1971]], a drunken belief will found the defense even though this allows drunkenness to negate basic intent. This is limited authority and does not affect the generality of the defense.

Examples of specific intent crimes include first degree murder based on premeditation and deliberation, attempts, burglary (intent to commit larceny), larceny (intent to steal), possession of or receiving stolen property (intent to steal), and robbery (intent to steal). General intent crimes include arson, rape, common law murder, and voluntary manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin (1993) The Voluntary Intoxication Defense AOJ Bulletin IOG. pages 5-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irregular sleep–wake rhythm''' is a rare form of [[circadian rhythm sleep disorder]]. It is characterized by numerous naps throughout the 24-hour period, no main nighttime sleep episode and irregularity from day to day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medlink.com (requires free trial or subscription) search on term: Irregular sleep–wake pattern&lt;/ref&gt; Sufferers have no pattern of when they are awake or asleep, may have poor quality sleep, and often may be very sleepy while they are awake. 
The total time asleep per 24 hours is normal for the person's age.&lt;ref&gt;Usage of term "Irregular Sleep–Wake Cycle": http://www.emedicinehealth.com/sleeplessness_and_circadian_rhythm_disorder/article_em.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kushida"&gt;http://www.sleepeducation.com/Disorder.aspx?id=60 [Handbook of Sleep Disorders By Clete A. Kushida accessed online Aug. 11, 2010] /&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sack2007"/&gt; The disorder is serious—an [[invisible disability]]. It can create social, familial, and work problems, making it hard for a person to maintain relationships and responsibilities, and may make a person home-bound and isolated.

==Causes==
ISWD has various causes, including neurological disorders such as dementia (particularly Alzheimer's Disease), brain damage, or mental retardation.&lt;ref name="PubMedHealth"/&gt; It is thought that sufferers have a weak [[circadian clock]].&lt;ref name="Kushida"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sack2007"/&gt; The risk for the disorder increases with age, but only due to increased prevalence of co-morbid medical disorders.&lt;ref name="PubMedHealth"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Sleep diary.svg|thumb|225px|A '''sleep diary''' with nighttime in the middle and the weekend in the middle, to better notice trends]]
A [[sleep diary]] should be kept to aid in diagnosis and for chronicling the sleep schedule during treatment. Other ways to monitor the sleep schedule are [[actigraphy]]&lt;ref name="Kushida"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sack2007" /&gt; or use of a [[Continuous Positive Airway Pressure]] (CPAP) machine that can [[Positive airway pressure#Optional features|log sleeping times]]

The following are possible warning signs:
* sleeping off and on in a series of naps during the day and at night, with no regular pattern but with normal total sleep time,
* difficulty getting restorative sleep, and
* excessive daytime sleepiness.&lt;ref name="Kushida"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sack2007"/&gt;

Because of the changes in sleep/wake time, and because this is a rare disorder, initially it can seem like another circadian rhythm sleep disorder such as [[non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder]] or like insomnia.

===Initial visit with sleep physician===
A physician specializing in [[sleep medicine]] may ask patients about their medical history; for example: neurological problems, prescription or non-prescription medications taken, alcohol use, family history, and any other sleep problems. A thorough medical and neurological exam is indicated. The patient will be asked to complete a sleep diary, recording natural sleep and wake up times, over several weeks. Sleep rating with the [[Epworth Sleepiness Scale]] may be used.&lt;ref name="Kushida"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sack2007"/&gt;

===Medical testing===
A neurological condition or another medical problem may be suspected, in which case, blood tests, a CT scan or an MRI may be used. An overnight sleep study is usually not needed to detect this disorder, but may be indicated if other sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea and periodic limb movement disorder, seem likely. The overnight sleep study is called [[polysomnography]]. It charts brain waves, heart beat, muscle activity, and breathing during sleep. It also records arm and leg movement. It will show if there are other sleep disorders that are causing or increasing the problems with ISWD.

==Management==
Treatment for irregular sleep–wake rhythm tries to enable the body clock in the brain, such that a normal long sleep period at night can be achieved. Education about [[sleep hygiene]] is important, and counseling can be helpful. [[Melatonin]], vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, sleep aids, wake aids, and other medications may also be used.&lt;ref name="Kushida"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sack2007"/&gt; Light during the daytime, and activities occurring at regular times each day, may help to restore a normal rhythm.&lt;ref name="Kushida"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sack2007"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Sack RL, Auckley D, Auger RR, etal |title=Circadian rhythm sleep disorders: part II, advanced sleep phase disorder, delayed sleep phase disorder, free-running disorder, and irregular sleep–wake rhythm. An American Academy of Sleep Medicine review |journal=Sleep |volume=30 |issue=11 |pages=1484–501 |year=2007 |pmid=18041481 |url=http://www.journalsleep.org/Articles/301108.pdf |format=PDF: full text |pmc=2082099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because there are different systems in the body that help establish regulation, it's helpful to employ a multi-modal approach. A 2008 review states that "...each clock is differentially sensitive to [[zeitgeber]]s. The [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN) is very responsive to light, the clock in the liver is very sensitive to food, and clocks in muscle are sensitive to exercise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Harvey |first=Allison G. |date=July 2008 |title=Sleep and Circadian Rhythms in Bipolar Disorder: Seeking Synchrony, Harmony, and Regulation |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=165 |issue=7 |pages=824 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08010098 |quote=For the latter, each clock is differentially sensitive to zeitgebers. The SCN is very responsive to light, the clock in the liver is very sensitive to food, and clocks in muscle are sensitive to exercise. |pmid=18519522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Circadian rhythm labeled.jpg|thumb|Circadian rhythm labeled]]
The following approaches are recommended by one source:&lt;ref&gt;From "Ultiimate review for the neurology boards..." by Hubert Fernandez (p243)&lt;/ref&gt; {{Unreliable source?|date=October 2018}}
# Spend &lt;7–8 hours in bed.
# Add environmental cues such as light and social interactions, regular meal times, and regular sleep–wake times.
# Morning and eve light at 3000&amp;nbsp;lux for 2 hours have been shown to improve nocturnal sleep in institutionalized patients and reduce agitation in demented patients.
# Melatonin at desired sleep time.

==Research==
There is currently a great deal of active research on various aspects of circadian rhythm; this often occurs at major universities in conjunction with sleep research clinics at major hospitals. An example is the program with [[Harvard Medical School]] and [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sleep.med.harvard.edu/people/faculty&lt;/ref&gt; This research includes programs that are staffed by researchers from various departments at the university, including psychiatry, neurology, chemistry, biology. Other major sleep research centers are in Tel Aviv in Israel, Munich in Germany and in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

A wide variety of sleep disorders are actively being researched. Measuring body temperature or melatonin levels may be used. Some hospitals do blood tests for melatonin levels. Saliva tests for melatonin are now available for online purchase; its metabolites can also be tested in urine.&lt;ref name="Kushida"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sack2007"/&gt;

The '''Jigawa State School of Midwifery''' was the first school of midwifery in the state of [[Jigawa]] in northern Nigeria.

==History==
[[File:Aisha Mo’hd Kazaure.jpg|thumb|200px|Aisha Moh’d Kazaure]]
The school was created in March 2010 and founded by Aisha Moh’d Kazaure, who is a midwife and a teacher. because of the low number of midwives in the state of Jigawa. The funding came from the British [[Department for International Development]] which recognized that, while there are five million people who live in the state, there are less than 30 midwives.&lt;ref name=uksource&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/called-to-be-a-midwife-in-northern-nigeria Called to be a midwife in northern Nigeria], UK Government, Retrieved 2 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entry==
Girls can join the course if they have credits in English and Science. These are relatively high qualifications as women's illiteracy is over 90% in the region. Students are typically female and in their early twenties&lt;ref name=uksource/&gt; despite that 80% of health workers are male. Applications are via a form available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nairaland.com/2464031/edo-state-2015-16-school form], Nairaland.com, Retrieved 2 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other schools==
In 2015, Jigawa State said that it intended to set up another School of Midwifery at [[Hadejia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/2015/07/jigawa-to-establish-nursing-school/ Jigawa to establish Nursing School], 29 July 2016, NGRGuardianNews, Retrieved 2 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jogging''' is a form of trotting or [[running]] at a slow or leisurely pace. The main intention is to increase [[physical fitness]] with less stress on the body than from faster running but more than [[walking]], or to maintain a steady speed for longer periods of time. Performed over long distances, it is a form of [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] [[endurance training]].

==Definition==
[[File:Evening jogger (4488221416).jpg|thumb|Evening jogger in [[Skien]], [[Norway]].]]
Jogging is running at a gentle pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Oxford Dictionaries |title=jogging |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/jogging|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of jogging as compared with running is not standard. One definition describes jogging as running slower than {{convert|6|mph|0}}. Running is sometimes defined as requiring a moment of no contact to the ground, whereas jogging often sustains the contact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/health_and_fitness/4286146.stm Are you running properly?] at [[BBC Sport]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jogging is also distinguished from running by having a wider lateral spacing of foot strikes, creating side-to-side movement that likely adds stability at slower speeds or when coordination is lacking.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==History==
The word ''jog'' originated in England in the mid-16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jog|title=Jog |author=|date=|work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etymology of the word is unknown, but it may be related to ''shog'' or have been a new invention.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} In 1593, [[William Shakespeare]] wrote in ''[[Taming of the Shrew]]'', "you may be jogging whiles your boots are green". At that point, it usually meant to leave.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David. ''Think On My Words: Exploring Shakespeare's Language'', Cambridge University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|9780521876940}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=wKx9aaj1ZK0C&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=jog+etymology&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA238,M1 on p. 237] at Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''jog'' was often used in English and North American literature to describe short quick movements, either intentional or unintentional.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} It is also used to describe a quick, sharp shake or jar.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} [[Richard Jefferies]], an English naturalist, wrote of "joggers", describing them as quickly moving people who brushed others aside as they passed.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, Richard. [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/thpnr10.txt ''The Open Air''] at Project Gutenberg&lt;/ref&gt;  This usage became common throughout the [[British Empire]], and in his 1884 novel ''My Run Home'', the Australian author [[Rolf Boldrewood]] wrote, "Your bedroom curtains were still drawn as I passed on my morning jog".

In the [[United States]] jogging was called "roadwork" when athletes in training, such as boxers, customarily ran several miles each day as part of their conditioning.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} In [[New Zealand]] during the 1960s or 1970s, the word "roadwork" was mostly supplanted by the word "jogging", promoted by coach [[Arthur Lydiard]], who is credited with popularizing jogging. The idea of jogging as an organised activity was mooted in a sports page article in ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' in February 1962, which told of a group of former athletes and fitness enthusiasts who would meet once a week to run for "fitness and sociability". Since they would be jogging, the newspaper suggested that the club "may be called the Auckland Joggers' Club"—which is thought to be the first use of the noun "jogger". [[University of Oregon]] track coach [[Bill Bowerman]], after jogging with Lydiard in New Zealand in 1962, started a joggers club in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]] in early 1963.&lt;ref name=vgrat&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=T7pQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OOMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2989%2C558389 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |last=Leutzinger |first=Dick |title=Bowerman calls joggers' turnout at first meeting 'very gratifying'|date=February 4, 1963 |page=3B}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published the book ''Jogging'' in 1966, popularizing jogging in the United States.

==Exercise==
[[File:Jogging on Waikiki Beach.jpeg|thumb|Members of the [[United States Air Force Academy]] American football team jog on [[Waikiki beach]], [[Hawaii]].]]Jogging may also be used as a warm up or cool down for runners, preceding or following a workout or race.  It is often used by serious runners as a means of active recovery during [[interval training]].  For example, a runner who completes a fast 400 metre repetition at a sub-5-minute mile pace (3 minute km) may drop to an 8-minute mile jogging pace (5 minute km) for a recovery lap.

Jogging can be used as a method to increase endurance or to provide a means of cardiovascular exercise but with less stress on joints or demand on the circulatory system.

==Benefits==
According to a study by [[Stanford University School of Medicine]], jogging is effective in increasing human lifespan, and decreasing the [[effects of aging]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://med.stanford.edu/news_releases/2008/august/running.html Running slows the aging clock, Stanford researchers find], Stanford School of Medicine Press Release&lt;/ref&gt; with benefits for the [[cardiovascular system]]. Jogging is useful for fighting obesity and staying healthy.
[[File:Wayne wang jogging in Golden Gate Park, 1980.jpg|thumb|Jogging in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, California.]]
The National Cancer Institute has performed studies that suggest jogging and other types of aerobic exercise can reduce the risk of lung, colon, breast and prostate cancers, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/prevention/physicalactivity|title=Physical Activity and Cancer|author=|date=|publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]] |accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested by the American Cancer Society that jogging for at least 30 minutes five days a week can help in cancer prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/healthy/eathealthygetactive/acsguidelinesonnutritionphysicalactivityforcancerprevention/acs-guidelines-on-nutrition-and-physical-activity-for-cancer-prevention-intro|title=American Cancer Society Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Prevention|author=|date=|publisher=cancer.org|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While jogging on a [[treadmill]] will provide health benefits such as cancer prevention, and aid in weight loss, a study published in BMC Public Health reports that jogging outdoors can have the additional benefits of increased energy and concentration. Jogging outdoors is a better way to improve energy levels and advance mood than using a treadmill at the gym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowler|first1=Diana E|last2=Buyung-Ali|first2=Lisette M|last3=Knight|first3=Teri M|last4=Pullin|first4=Andrew S|title=A systematic review of evidence for the added benefits to health of exposure to natural environments|journal=BMC Public Health|date=4 August 2010|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-10-456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jogging also prevents muscle and bone damage that often occurs with age, improves heart performance and blood circulation and assists in preserving a balanced weight gain.

A Danish study released in 2015 reported that "light" and "moderate" jogging were associated with reduced mortality compared to both non-jogging and "strenuous" jogging. The optimal amount per week was 1 to 2.4 hours, the optimal frequency was less than or equal to 3 times per week and the optimal speed was "slow" or "average".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleID=2108914|title=Dose of Jogging and Long-Term Mortality The Copenhagen City Heart Study|date=February 2015|accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Keannekeuk''' (c. 1790–1852), also known as the "Kickapoo Prophet", was a [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] [[medicine man]] and spiritual leader of the Vermilion band of the Kickapoo nation. He lived in East Central Illinois much of his life along the Vermilion River&lt;ref&gt;Herring, Joseph B., Kenekuk: The Kickapoo Prophet. University of Kansas Press, 1988, pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; and led a community of followers, whose beliefs centered on non-violence, passive resistance to resettlement, abstinence from alcohol, and meditation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://student.britannica.com/comptons/article-9311975/Kennekuk Student Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; He favored moderate, nonviolent accommodation and coexistence with American westward expansion, and a settled agricultural life. These views caused him and his followers to suffer derision and alienation from some of the other Kickapoo bands. His tribal community's religious outlook embodied a type of Christian evangelism in some respects and a group of [[Potawatomi]] converts joined his following over time. He died on the reservation in Kansas in 1852.

Reverend William H. Honnell, who visited a few years after Kennekuk's death, reported that Kennekuk went back and forth between Christian teachings and "heathenism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Some Kickapoo descendants still follow the tenets of his preaching.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QDUiWKyyF4AC&amp;pg=PA109 Kickapoos: Lords of the Middle Border pgs 109–118]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LRBA deficiency''' is a rare [[genetic disorder]] of the [[immune system]]. This disorder is caused by a [[mutation]] in the [[gene]] ''LRBA''. [[LRBA]] stands for “[[lipopolysaccharide]] (LPS)-responsive and beige-like anchor protein”. This condition is characterized by [[autoimmunity]], lymphoproliferation, and [[immune deficiency]].

==Signs and symptoms==
LRBA deficiency presents as a syndrome of autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, and humoral immune deficiency. Predominant clinical problems include [[idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]] (ITP), [[autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] (AIHA), and an autoimmune [[enteropathy]].&lt;ref name="Lopez-Herrera et al, 2012" /&gt;  Before the discovery of these gene mutations, patients were diagnosed with [[common variable immune deficiency]] (CVID), which is characterized by low [[antibody]] levels and recurrent infections. Infections mostly affect the respiratory tract, as many patients suffer from chronic lung disease, pneumonias, and bronchiectasis. Lymphocytic [[interstitial lung disease]] (ILD) is also observed, which complicates breathing and leads to impairment of lung function and mortality.&lt;ref name="Lo et al, 2015" /&gt; Infections can also occur at other sites, such as the eyes, skin and gastrointestinal tract. Many patients suffer from chronic diarrhea and [[inflammatory bowel disease]]. Other clinical features can include [[hepatosplenomegaly]], reoccurring warts, growth retardation, allergic dermatitis, and arthritis.&lt;ref name="Lopez-Herrera et al, 2012" /&gt; Notably, LRBA deficiency has also been associated with [[type 1 diabetes mellitus]].&lt;ref name="Lo et al, 2015" /&gt; There is significant clinical phenotypic overlap with disease caused by CTLA4 haploinsufficiency.  Since LRBA loss results in a loss of CTLA4 protein, the immune dysregulation syndrome of LRBA deficient patients can be attributed to the secondary loss of CTLA4.  Because the predominant features of the disease include autoantibody-mediated disease (AIHA, ITP), Treg defects (resembling those found in CTLA4 haploinsufficient patients), autoimmune infiltration (of non-lymphoid organs, also resembling that found in CTLA4 haploinsufficient patients), and enteropathy, the disease has been termed LATAIE for LRBA deficiency with autoantibodies, Treg defects, autoimmune infiltration, and enteropathy.

==Genetics== 
[[File:LBRA.jpg|thumb|LRBA domain structures. Shown are the LRBA mutations of nine patients.&lt;ref name="Lo et al, 2015" /&gt;]]
LRBA deficiency is caused by biallelic loss-of-function [[mutations]] in the gene ''LRBA''. [[LRBA]] maps to human chromosome 4q31.3, has 58 [[exons]], and encodes for one of the largest intracellular proteins, LRBA.&lt;ref name="Lo et al, 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OMIM# 606453|url=http://www.omim.org/entry/606453}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genecards - LRBA gene|url=https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=LRBA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LRBA protein belongs to a distinct sub-family of proteins characterized by a “beige and CHS”, or BEACH, domain followed by repeated WD40 domains at the [[carboxy terminus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Souza|first1=N|last2=Vallier|first2=LG|last3=Fares|first3=H|last4=Greenwald|first4=I|title=SEL-2, the C. elegans neurobeachin/LRBA homolog, is a negative regulator of lin-12/Notch activity and affects endosomal traffic in polarized epithelial cells.|journal=Development|date=February 2007|volume=134|issue=4|pages=691–702|pmid=17215302|doi=10.1242/dev.02767}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These related BEACH-containing proteins have been found to regulate trafficking of intracellular vesicles. These [[loss-of-function]] LRBA mutations decrease or eradicate LRBA protein in patients with this disorder.&lt;ref name="Lo et al, 2015" /&gt;

[[File:LRBA and CTLA4.jpg|thumb|right|Model depicting the regulation of CTLA4 vesicle trafficking by LRBA&lt;ref name="Lo et al, 2015" /&gt;]]
Although the function of LRBA is not fully understood, it was recently reported that this protein plays a major immuno-regulatory role in the expression, function, and trafficking of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 ([[CTLA4]]). CTLA4 is an immune effector molecule that acts as an inhibitory checkpoint for the [[immune response]]. CTLA4 resides in intracellular vesicles, or [[endosomes]], of [[regulatory T cells]] (Tregs) that are released and mobilize to the cell surface after [[T cell receptor]] stimulation.&lt;ref name="Lo et al, 2015" /&gt;

It is hypothesized that LRBA deficiency sufficiently impairs post-translational CTLA4 [[expressivity (genetics)|expression]], as the abundance of CTLA4 protein in patients is significantly lower than normal. Knockdown of LRBA in wildtype cells, also leads to a post-translational loss of CTLA4 protein. Co-immunopreciptation studies suggest that LRBA binds to the cytoplasmic tail of CTLA4.  By binding to the tail, LRBA may protect and regulate the degradation of CTLA4 by blocking its trafficking to [[lysosomes]] for degradation.&lt;ref name="Lo et al, 2015" /&gt;

===Inheritance===

LRBA deficiency is inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] manner. In autosomal recessive inheritance, two copies of an abnormal gene must be present in order for the disease to develop. Typically, this means both parents of an affected child silently carry one abnormal gene. This also explains why reported cases of LRBA deficiency have often involved homozygosity via [[consanguinity]] or geographically isolated communities.

Parents of a child with LRBA deficiency have a 25% chance of having another affected child with each pregnancy. This risk is independent of prior children’s status. For example, if the first two children in a family are affected, the next child has the same 25% risk of inheriting the mutation. All affected individuals have two abnormal copies of ''LRBA''. Children who inherit only one abnormal copy of ''LRBA'' will not develop LRBA deficiency although they may have affected children, particularly if they marry within the family.

==Diagnosis==
Patients show markedly low [[immunoglobulin]] levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM.

==Treatment==
A new investigation has identified a seemingly successful treatment for LRBA deficiency by targeting CTLA4. [[Abatacept]], an approved drug for rheumatoid arthritis, mimics the function of CTLA4 and has found to reverse life-threatening symptoms.&lt;ref name="Lo et al, 2015" /&gt; The study included nine patients that exhibited improved clinical status and halted inflammatory conditions with minimal infectious or autoimmune complications. The study also suggests that therapies like [[chloroquine]] or hydroxychloroquine, which inhibit lysosomal degradation, may prove to be effective, as well.&lt;ref name="Lo et al, 2015" /&gt; Larger cohorts are required to further validate these therapeutic approaches as effective long-term treatments for this disorder.

'''Lisa Feldman Barrett''' is a University Distinguished Professor of [[Psychology]] at [[Northeastern University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuweb9.neu.edu/psychology/people/faculty/lisa-feldman-barrett/|title=Northeastern University Psychology Department|website=neu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she focuses on the study of [[emotion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/members/psychological-scientists/#barrett|title=The Faces and Minds of Psychological Science|website=psychologicalscience.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is a director of the Interdisciplinary Affective Science Laboratory.  Along with [[James A. Russell|James Russell]], she is the founding [[editor-in-chief]] of the journal ''Emotion Review''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sagepub.com/journalsProdDesc.nav?prodId=Journal201864 ''Emotion Review'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Barrett was born in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada in 1963.  Barrett obtained her [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[Psychology]] with Honors at the [[University of Toronto]]. Barrett completed a Ph.D. in [[Clinical Psychology]] at the [[University of Waterloo]], in Ontario, Canada, and a Clinical Internship at the [[University of Manitoba]] Medical School.

==Professional history==

===Study of human emotions===
At the beginning of her career, Dr. Barrett's research focused on the structure of [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], having developed experience-sampling methods&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book 
  | last = Hektner
  | first = Joel M.

&lt;/ref&gt; and open-source software to study emotional experience. Dr. Barrett and members at IASL study the nature of emotion broadly from social-psychological, psychophysiological, cognitive science, and neuroscience perspectives, and take inspiration from anthropology, philosophy, and linguistics. They also explore the role of emotion in vision and other psychological phenomena.

In 1996 she joined the Psychology Faculty at [[Boston College]]. Before that she was an [[Assistant Professor]] of Clinical Psychology at The [[Pennsylvania State University]].

Her research has focused on the main issues in the science of emotions such as: 
*What are the basic building blocks of emotional life? 
*Why is it that people are able to quickly and effortlessly perceive anger, sadness, fear in themselves and in others, yet scientists have been unable to specify a set of clear criteria for empirically identifying these emotional events? 
*What roles do language and conceptual knowledge play in emotion perception? 
*Are there really differences between the emotional lives of men and women?

===Theory of constructed emotion===
During her graduate training, Barrett developed the initial insights for her current [[theory of constructed emotion]].

She highlights differences in emotions between different cultures, and says that emotions "''are not triggered; you create them. They emerge as a combination of the physical properties of your body, a flexible brain that wires itself to whatever environment it develops in, and your culture and upbringing, which provide that environment."&lt;ref&gt;How Emotions Are Made, 2017, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph E. LeDoux|Joseph LeDoux]] has taken a similar view.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Myositis''' is [[inflammation]] or swelling of the [[muscle]]s. Injury, medicines, infection, or an immune disorder can lead to myositis.&lt;ref&gt;{{MedlinePlus|001245|Myositis}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a documented side effect of the lipid-lowering drugs [[statins]] and [[fibrate]]s.

==Types==
Types of myositis include:
* [[myositis ossificans]]
* (idiopathic) [[Inflammatory myopathy|inflammatory myopathies]]
** [[dermatomyositis]]
*** [[juvenile dermatomyositis]]
** [[polymyositis]]
** [[inclusion body myositis]]
* [[pyomyositis]]

==Diagnosis==
Elevation of [[creatine kinase]] in blood is indicative of myositis.
==Treatment==
Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are first treated with high doses of corticosteroids.

=== 2012 military coup d'etat ===
{{See also|2012 Malian coup d'etat}}
Following the coup d'état that suspended Mali's democratic institutions on the night of 21–22 March 2012, Oumar Mariko and his SADI political party created MP22, the ''Mouvement populaire du 22 mars'' (22 March People's Movement) supporting the coup plotters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20120325-mali-deux-mouvements-politiques-cr%C3%A9%C3%A9s-r%C3%A9action-putsch "Mali : deux mouvements politiques créés en réaction au putsch"], Radio France Internationale, 25 March 2012 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Malian parliamentary election, 2013|July&amp;ndash;August 2013 parliamentary election]], Mariko was re-elected to the National Assembly. He subsequently stood as a candidate for the post of President of the National Assembly, but in the vote held on 22 January 2014, the governing party's candidate, [[Issaka Sidibé]], won easily, with 115 votes against 11 for Mariko.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20140122-mali-issaka-sidibe-president-assemblee-nationale/ "Mali: Issaka Sidibé élu président de l'Assemblée nationale"], Radio France Internationale, 22 January 2014 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39997">'''Pharmacokinetics''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ''pharmakon'' "drug" and ''kinetikos'' "moving, putting in motion"; see [[chemical kinetics]]), sometimes abbreviated as '''PK''',  is a branch of [[pharmacology]] dedicated to determining the fate of substances administered to a living organism. The substances of interest include any chemical [[xenobiotic]] such as: [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, [[pesticide]]s, [[food additive]]s, [[cosmetics]], etc. It attempts to analyze chemical [[metabolism]] and to discover the fate of a chemical from the moment that it is administered up to the point at which it is completely [[excreted|eliminated from the body]]. Pharmacokinetics is the study of how an organism affects a drug, whereas [[pharmacodynamics]] (PD) is the study of how the drug affects the organism. Both together influence [[dosing]], benefit, and [[adverse effect]]s, as seen in [[PK/PD models]].

==Overview==
Pharmacokinetics describes how the body affects a specific xenobiotic/chemical after administration through the mechanisms of absorption and distribution, as well as the metabolic changes of the substance in the body (e.g. by metabolic [[enzyme]]s such as [[cytochrome P450]] or [[glucuronosyltransferase]] enzymes), and the effects and routes of excretion of the metabolites of the drug.&lt;ref&gt;Pharmacokinetics. (2006). In ''[[Mosby's Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing &amp; Health Professions]]''. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier Health Sciences. Retrieved December 11, 2008, from http://www.credoreference.com/entry/6686418&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmacokinetic properties of chemicals are affected by the route of administration and the dose of administered drug. These may affect the absorption rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Kathleen | last1 = Knights | first2 = Bronwen | last2 = Bryant | name-list-format = vanc | title = Pharmacology for Health Professionals | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam | year = 2002 | pages = | isbn = 0-7295-3664-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Models have been developed to simplify conceptualization of the many processes that take place in the interaction between an organism and a chemical substance. One of these, the [[pharmacokinetics#Multi-compartmental models|multi-compartmental model]], is the most commonly used  approximations to reality; however, the complexity involved in adding parameters with that modelling approach means that ''monocompartmental models'' and above all ''two compartmental models'' are the most-frequently used. The various compartments that the model is divided into are commonly referred to as the [[ADME]] scheme (also referred to as LADME if liberation is included as a separate step from absorption):
* [[Liberation (pharmacology)|'''&lt;u&gt;L&lt;/u&gt;'''iberation]] – the process of release of a drug from the [[pharmaceutical formulation]].&lt;ref name="KochRitschel1986"&gt;{{cite book | title = Synopsis der Biopharmazie und Pharmakokinetik | vauthors = Koch HP, Ritschel WA | year = 1986 | publisher = Ecomed | location = Landsberg, München | language = German | isbn = 3-609-64970-4 | chapter = Liberation | pages = 99–131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17630642"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruiz-Garcia A, Bermejo M, Moss A, Casabo VG | title = Pharmacokinetics in drug discovery | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences | volume = 97 | issue = 2 | pages = 654–90 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 17630642 | doi = 10.1002/jps.21009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[IVIVC]].
* [[Absorption (pharmacokinetics)|'''&lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;'''bsorption]] – the process of a substance entering the blood circulation.
* [[Distribution (pharmacology)|'''&lt;u&gt;D&lt;/u&gt;'''istribution]] – the dispersion or dissemination of substances throughout the fluids and tissues of the body.
* [[Metabolism|'''&lt;u&gt;M&lt;/u&gt;'''etabolism]] (or biotransformation, or inactivation) – the recognition by the organism that a foreign substance is present and the irreversible transformation of parent compounds into daughter metabolites.
* [[Elimination (pharmacology)|'''&lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;'''xcretion]] – the removal of the substances from the body. In rare cases, some [[drugs]] irreversibly accumulate in [[body tissue]]. {{Citation needed|reason=This is a strong claim and should be backed by literature reference(s)|date=February 2018}}

The two phases of metabolism and excretion can also be grouped together under the title elimination.
The study of these distinct phases involves the use and manipulation of basic concepts in order to understand the process dynamics. For this reason in order to fully comprehend the ''kinetics'' of a drug it is necessary to have detailed knowledge of a number of factors such as: the properties of the substances that act as [[excipient]]s, the characteristics of the appropriate [[Cell membrane|biological membranes]] and the way that substances can cross them, or the characteristics of the [[enzyme kinetics|enzyme reactions]] that inactivate the drug.

All these concepts can be represented through [[Expression (mathematics)|mathematical formulas]] that have a corresponding [[Graph of a function|graphical representation]]. The use of these models allows an understanding of the characteristics of a [[molecule]], as well as how a particular drug will behave given information regarding some of its basic characteristics such as its [[acid dissociation constant]] (pKa), [[bioavailability]] and [[solubility]], absorption capacity and distribution in the organism.

The model outputs for a drug can be used in industry (for example, in calculating [[bioequivalence]] when designing generic drugs) or in the clinical application of pharmacokinetic concepts. Clinical pharmacokinetics provides many performance guidelines for effective and efficient use of drugs for human-health professionals and in [[veterinary medicine]].

== Metrics ==
The following are the most commonly measured pharmacokinetic metrics:&lt;ref name="urlwww.agah.info"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.agah.eu/fileadmin/_migrated/content_uploads/PK-glossary_PK_working_group_2004.pdf |title = Collection of terms, symbols, equations, and explanations of common pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters and some statistical functions |author = AGAH working group PHARMACOKINETICS |date = 2004-02-16 |format = PDF |publisher = Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Angewandte Humanpharmakologie (AGAH) (Association for Applied Human Pharmacology) |accessdate = 2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{DoseConcentrationClearance}}
{{anchor|steady state}}
In pharmacokinetics, ''steady state'' refers to the situation where the overall intake of a drug is fairly in [[dynamic equilibrium]] with its elimination. In practice, it is generally considered that steady state is reached when a time of 4 to 5 times the half-life for a drug after regular dosing is started.

The following graph depicts a typical time course of drug plasma concentration and illustrates main pharmacokinetic metrics:
[[File:Linear PK Example.png|400px|thumb|left|The time course of drug plasma concentrations over 96 hours following oral administrations every 24 hours. Note that the AUC in steady state equals AUC&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; after the first dose.]]

== Pharmacokinetic models ==
Pharmacokinetic modelling is performed by noncompartmental or [[compartment (pharmacokinetics)|compartment]]al methods. Noncompartmental methods estimate the exposure to a drug by estimating the [[integral|area under the curve]] of a concentration-time graph. Compartmental methods estimate the concentration-time graph using kinetic models. Noncompartmental methods are often more versatile in that they do not assume any specific compartmental model and produce accurate results also acceptable for bioequivalence studies.
The final outcome of the transformations that a drug undergoes in an organism and the rules that determine this fate depend on a number of interrelated factors. A number of functional models have been developed in order to simplify the study of pharmacokinetics. These models are based on a consideration of an organism as a number of related compartments. The simplest idea is to think of an organism as only one homogenous compartment. This ''monocompartmental model'' presupposes that [[blood plasma]] concentrations of the drug are a true reflection of the drug’s concentration in other fluids or tissues and that the elimination of the drug is directly proportional to the drug’s concentration in the organism ([[first order kinetics]]).

However, these models do not always truly reflect the real situation within an organism. For example, not all body tissues have the same [[blood| blood supply]], so the distribution of the drug will be slower in these tissues than in others with a better blood supply. In addition, there are some tissues (such as the [[brain]] tissue) that present a real barrier to the distribution of drugs, that can be breached with greater or lesser ease depending on the drug’s characteristics. If these relative conditions for the different tissue types are considered along with the rate of elimination, the organism can be considered to be acting like two compartments: one that we can call the ''central compartment'' that has a more rapid distribution, comprising organs and systems with a well-developed blood supply; and a ''peripheral compartment'' made up of organs with a lower blood flow. Other tissues, such as the brain, can occupy a variable position depending on a drug’s ability to cross the [[Blood–brain barrier|barrier]] that separates the organ from the blood supply.

This ''two compartment model'' will vary depending on which compartment elimination occurs in. The most common situation is that elimination occurs in the central compartment as the [[liver]] and [[kidneys]] are organs with a good blood supply. However, in some situations it may be that elimination occurs in the peripheral compartment or even in both. This can mean that there are three possible variations in the two compartment model, which still do not cover all possibilities.&lt;ref name="Reverte"&gt;Milo Gibaldi, Donald Perrier. ''Farmacocinética''Reverté 1982 pages 1–10. {{ISBN|84-291-5535-X}}, 9788429155358&lt;/ref&gt;

This model may not be applicable in situations where some of the enzymes responsible for metabolizing the drug become saturated, or where an active elimination mechanism is present that is independent of the drug's plasma concentration. In the real world each tissue will have its own distribution characteristics and none of them will be strictly linear. If we label the drug’s [[volume of distribution]] within the organism '''Vd&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''' and its volume of distribution in a tissue '''Vd&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''' the former will be described by an equation that takes into account all the tissues that act in different ways, that is:

: &lt;math&gt;Vd_F = Vd_{T1} + Vd_{T2} + Vd_{T3} + \cdots + Vd_{Tn}\,&lt;/math&gt;

This represents the ''multi-compartment model'' with a number of curves that express complicated equations in order to obtain an overall curve. A number of [[computer program]]s have been developed to plot these equations.&lt;ref name="Reverte" /&gt; However complicated and precise this model may be, it still does not truly represent reality despite the effort involved in obtaining various distribution values for a drug. This is because the concept of distribution volume is a relative concept that is not a true reflection of reality. The choice of model therefore comes down to deciding which one offers the lowest margin of error for the drug involved.

[[File:Farmacocinética lineal.svg|thumb|250px|Graph representing the monocompartmental action model.]]

===Noncompartmental analysis===
Noncompartmental PK analysis is highly dependent on estimation of total drug exposure. Total drug exposure is most often estimated by area under the curve (AUC) methods, with the [[trapezoidal rule]] ([[numerical integration]]) the most common method. Due to the dependence on the length of ''x'' in the trapezoidal rule, the area estimation is highly dependent on the blood/plasma sampling schedule. That is, the closer time points are, the closer the trapezoids reflect the actual shape of the concentration-time curve.

===Compartmental analysis===
[[Multi-compartment model|Compartmental]] PK analysis uses kinetic models to describe and predict the concentration-time curve. PK compartmental models are often similar to kinetic models used in other scientific disciplines such as [[chemical kinetics]] and [[thermodynamics]]. The advantage of compartmental over some noncompartmental analyses is the ability to predict the concentration at any time. The disadvantage is the difficulty in developing and validating the proper model. Compartment-free modelling based on curve stripping does not suffer this limitation. The simplest PK compartmental model is the one-compartmental PK model with IV bolus administration and [[Biological half-life#First-order elimination|first-order elimination]]. The most complex PK models (called [[PBPK]] models) rely on the use of physiological information to ease development and validation.

=== Single-compartment model ===
''Linear pharmacokinetics'' is so-called because the graph of the relationship between the various factors involved ([[dose (biochemistry)|dose]], blood plasma concentrations, elimination, etc.) gives a [[line (geometry)|straight line]] or an approximation to one. For drugs to be effective they need to be able to move rapidly from blood plasma to other body fluids and tissues.

The change in concentration over time can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;C=C_\text{initial} \times e^{-k_\text{el} \times t}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Multi-compartmental models ===
[[File:Farmacocinética no lineal.svg|thumb|200px| Graphs for absorption and elimination for a non-linear pharmacokinetic model.]]
The graph for the non-linear relationship between the various factors is represented by a [[curve]]; the relationships between the factors can then be found by calculating the dimensions of different areas under the curve. The models used in ''non-linear pharmacokinetics'' are largely based on [[Michaelis–Menten kinetics]].
A reaction’s factors of non-linearity include the following:
* Multiphasic absorption: Drugs injected [[intravenous therapy|intravenously]] are removed from the plasma through two primary mechanisms: (1) Distribution to body tissues and (2) metabolism + excretion of the drugs. The resulting decrease of the drug's plasma concentration follows a biphasic pattern (see figure).[[File:Iv time conc curve.svg|thumb|Plasma drug concentration vs time after an IV dose]]
** '''Alpha phase''': An initial phase of rapid decrease in plasma concentration. The decrease is primarily attributed to drug distribution from the central compartment (circulation) into the peripheral compartments (body tissues). This phase ends when a pseudo-equilibrium of drug concentration is established between the central and peripheral compartments.
** '''Beta phase''': A phase of gradual decrease in plasma concentration after the alpha phase. The decrease is primarily attributed to drug metabolism and excretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gill SC, Moon-Mcdermott L, Hunt TL, Deresinski S, Blaschke T, Sandhaus RA |title=Phase I Pharmacokinetics of Liposomal Amikacin (MiKasome) in Human Subjects: Dose Dependence and Urinary Clearance | journal = Abstr Intersci Conf Antimicrob Agents Chemother |date=Sep 1999 | page = 33 (abstract no. 1195) | volume = 39 | url = http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/MeetingAbstracts/ma?f=102244695.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Additional phases (gamma, delta, etc.) are sometimes seen.&lt;ref name="isbn91-86274-92-9"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Daniel | last1 = Weiner | first2 = Johan | last2 = Gabrielsson | name-list-format = vanc | title = Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data analysis: concepts and applications | publisher = Apotekarsocieteten | location = | year = 2000 | pages = 527–36 | isbn = 91-86274-92-9 | url =  https://books.google.com/?id=K-gT2_Ukk0QC&amp;lpg=PA529&amp;dq=pharmacokinetic%20alpha%20beta%20gamma%20phase&amp;pg=PA528#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | chapter = PK24 – Non-linear kinetics – flow II }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A drug’s characteristics make a clear distinction between tissues with high and low blood flow.
* Enzymatic [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturation]]: When the dose of a drug whose elimination depends on biotransformation is increased above a certain threshold the enzymes responsible for its metabolism become saturated. The drug’s plasma concentration will then increase disproportionately and its elimination will no longer be constant.
* Induction or [[Enzyme inhibitor|enzymatic inhibition]]: Some drugs have the capacity to inhibit or stimulate their own metabolism, in negative or [[Positive feedback#In biology|positive feedback]] reactions. As occurs with [[fluvoxamine]], [[fluoxetine]] and [[phenytoin]]. As larger doses of these pharmaceuticals are administered the plasma concentrations of the unmetabolized drug increases and the [[Biological half-life|elimination half-life]] increases. It is therefore necessary to adjust the dose or other treatment parameters when a high dosage is required.
* The kidneys can also establish active elimination mechanisms for some drugs, independent of plasma concentrations.

It can therefore be seen that non-linearity can occur because of reasons that affect the entire pharmacokinetic sequence: absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination.

=== Variable volume in time models ===

[[Variable volume pharmacokinetic models]] can be drug centered models that imply a volume of drug distribution to be that volume in which the drug is distributed at that elapsed time following drug administration.&lt;ref name="Niazi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Niazi S | title = Volume of distribution as a function of time | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences | volume = 65 | issue = 3 | pages = 452–4 | date = March 1976 | pmid = 1263103 | doi=10.1002/jps.2600650339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wesolowski"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wesolowski CA, Wesolowski MJ, Babyn PS, Wanasundara SN | title = Time Varying Apparent Volume of Distribution and Drug Half-Lives Following Intravenous Bolus Injections | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 7 | pages = e0158798 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27403663 | pmc = 4942076 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0158798 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1158798W }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another possibility occurs when the body volume is changing in time, which would occur, for example, during dialysis when the volume in which a drug can be distributed is itself changing in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim DK, Lee JC, Lee H, Joo KW, Oh KH, Kim YS, Yoon HJ, Kim HC | title = Calculation of the clearance requirements for the development of a hemodialysis-based wearable artificial kidney | journal = Hemodialysis International. International Symposium on Home Hemodialysis | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 226–34 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26245302 | doi = 10.1111/hdi.12343 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bioavailability ==
{{Main | Bioavailability}}
At a practical level, a drug’s bioavailability can be defined as the proportion of the drug that reaches its site of action. From this perspective the [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] administration of a drug provides the greatest possible bioavailability, and this method is considered to yield a bioavailability of 1 (or 100%). Bioavailability of other delivery methods is compared with that of intravenous injection («absolute bioavailability») or to a standard value related to other delivery methods in a particular study («relative bioavailability»).

: &lt;math&gt;B_A = \frac{[ABC]_P \cdot D_{IV}}{[ABC]_{IV} \cdot D_P}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathit B_R = \frac{[ABC]_A \cdot \text{dose}_B}{[ABC]_B \cdot \text{dose}_A}&lt;/math&gt;

Once a drug’s bioavailability has been established it is possible to calculate the changes that need to be made to its dosage in order to reach the required blood plasma levels. Bioavailability is therefore a mathematical factor for each individual drug that influences the administered dose. It is possible to calculate the amount of a drug in the blood plasma that has a real potential to bring about its effect using the formula: &lt;math&gt;De = B \cdot Da\,&lt;/math&gt;; where ''De'' is the [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|effective dose]], ''B'' bioavailability and ''Da'' the administered dose.

Therefore, if a drug has a bioavailability of 0.8 (or 80%) and it is administered in a dose of 100&amp;nbsp;mg, the equation will demonstrate the following:

&lt;center&gt; ''De'' = 0.8 × 100 mg = 80 mg &lt;/center&gt;

That is the 100&amp;nbsp;mg administered represents a blood plasma concentration of 80&amp;nbsp;mg that has the capacity to have a pharmaceutical effect.

[[File:Pill box with pills.JPG|thumb|200px| Different forms of tablets, which will have different pharmacokinetic behaviours after their administration.]]
This concept depends on a series of factors inherent to each drug, such as:&lt;ref name="Winter" &gt;Michael E. Winter, Mary Anne Koda-Kimple, Lloyd Y. Young, Emilio Pol Yanguas ''Farmacocinética clínica básica'' Ediciones Díaz de Santos, 1994 pgs. 8–14 {{ISBN|84-7978-147-5}}, 9788479781477 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pharmaceutical drug|Pharmaceutical form]]
* Chemical form
* [[Route of administration]]
* Stability
* [[Metabolism]]

These concepts, which are discussed in detail in their respective titled articles, can be mathematically quantified and integrated to obtain an overall mathematical equation:

: &lt;math&gt;De = Q\cdot Da\cdot B\,&lt;/math&gt;

where '''Q''' is the drug’s purity.&lt;ref name="Winter" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;Va = \frac{Da \cdot B \cdot Q} \tau &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Va&lt;/math&gt; is the drug’s rate of administration and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the rate at which the absorbed drug reaches the circulatory system.

Finally, using the [[Henderson-Hasselbalch equation]], and knowing the drug’s &lt;math&gt;pKa\,&lt;/math&gt; ([[pH]] at which there is an equilibrium between its ionized and non ionized molecules), it is possible to calculate the non ionized concentration of the drug and therefore the concentration that will be subject to absorption:

: &lt;math&gt;pH = pKa + \log \frac B A &lt;/math&gt;

When two drugs have the same bioavailability, they are said to be biological equivalents or bioequivalents. This concept of [[bioequivalence]] is important because it is currently used as a yardstick in the authorization of [[generic drug]]s in many countries.

== LADME ==
{{Main | ADME}}

A number of phases occur once the drug enters into contact with the organism, these are described using the acronym LADME:
* [[Liberation (pharmacology)|Liberation]] of the active substance from the delivery system,
* [[Absorption (pharmacokinetics)|Absorption]] of the active substance by the organism,
* [[Distribution (pharmacology)|Distribution]] through the blood plasma and different body tissues,
* [[Metabolism]] that is inactivation of the xenobiotic substance, and finally
* [[Excretion]] or [[elimination (pharmacology)|elimination]] of the substance or the products of its metabolism.

Some textbooks combine the first two phases as the drug is often administered in an active form, which means that there is no liberation phase. Others include a phase that combines distribution, metabolism and excretion into a disposition phase. Other authors include the drug’s toxicological aspect in what is known as ''ADME-Tox'' or ''ADMET''.

Each of the phases is subject to physico-chemical interactions between a drug and an organism, which can be expressed mathematically. Pharmacokinetics is therefore based on mathematical equations that allow the prediction of a drug’s behavior and which place great emphasis on the relationships between drug plasma concentrations and the time elapsed since the drug’s administration.

==Analysis==

=== Bioanalytical methods ===
[[Bioanalysis|Bioanalytical methods]] are necessary to construct a concentration-time profile. Chemical techniques are employed to measure the concentration of drugs in [[biological matrix]], most often plasma. Proper bioanalytical methods should be selective and sensitive. For example, [[microscale thermophoresis]] can be used to quantify how the biological matrix/liquid affects the affinity of a drug to its target.&lt;ref name=Baaske&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baaske P, Wienken CJ, Reineck P, Duhr S, Braun D | title = Optical thermophoresis for quantifying the buffer dependence of aptamer binding | journal = Angewandte Chemie | volume = 49 | issue = 12 | pages = 2238–41 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20186894 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/anie.200903998 | laysummary = http://www.physorg.com/news186225693.html | laysource = Phsyorg.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wienken&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wienken CJ, Baaske P, Rothbauer U, Braun D, Duhr S | title = Protein-binding assays in biological liquids using microscale thermophoresis | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 1 | issue = 7 | pages = 100 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20981028 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms1093 | bibcode = 2010NatCo...1E.100W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mass spectrometry ===
Pharmacokinetics is often studied using [[mass spectrometry]] because of the complex nature of the matrix (often plasma or urine) and the need for high sensitivity to observe concentrations after a low dose and a long time period. The most common instrumentation used in this application is [[liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] with a [[quadrupole mass analyzer|triple quadrupole mass spectrometer]]. [[Tandem mass spectrometry]] is usually employed for added specificity. Standard curves and internal standards are used for quantitation of usually a single pharmaceutical in the samples. The samples represent different time points as a pharmaceutical is administered and then metabolized or cleared from the body. Blank samples taken before administration are important in determining background and ensuring data integrity with such complex sample matrices. Much attention is paid to the linearity of the standard curve; however it is common to use [[curve fitting]] with more complex functions such as [[quadratic function|quadratics]] since the response of most mass spectrometers is not linear across large concentration ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hsieh Y, Korfmacher WA | title = Increasing speed and throughput when using HPLC-MS/MS systems for drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic screening | journal = Current Drug Metabolism | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 479–89 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16787157 | doi = 10.2174/138920006777697963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Covey TR, Lee ED, Henion JD | title = High-speed liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry for the determination of drugs in biological samples | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 58 | issue = 12 | pages = 2453–60 | date = October 1986 | pmid = 3789400 | doi = 10.1021/ac00125a022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Covey TR, Crowther JB, Dewey EA, Henion JD | title = Thermospray liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry determination of drugs and their metabolites in biological fluids | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 474–81 | date = February 1985 | pmid = 3977076 | doi = 10.1021/ac50001a036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is currently considerable interest in the use of very high sensitivity mass spectrometry for [[microdosing]] studies, which are seen as a promising alternative to [[animal experimentation]].&lt;ref name="EMEA-MD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2009/09/WC500002720.pdf|format=PDF|title=ICH guideline M3(R2) on non-clinical safety studies for the conduct of human clinical trials and marketing authorisation for pharmaceuticals |author = Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) |date=December 2009 |id=EMA/CPMP/ICH/286/1995 |publisher=[[European Medicines Agency]], Evaluation of Medicines for Human Use |accessdate= 4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population pharmacokinetics==
''Population pharmacokinetics'' is the study of the sources and correlates of variability in drug concentrations among individuals who are the target patient population receiving clinically relevant doses of a drug of interest.&lt;ref name="pmid925881"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheiner LB, Rosenberg B, Marathe VV | title = Estimation of population characteristics of pharmacokinetic parameters from routine clinical data | journal = Journal of Pharmacokinetics and Biopharmaceutics | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 445–79 | date = October 1977 | pmid = 925881 | doi = 10.1007/BF01061728 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid466923"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheiner LB, Beal S, Rosenberg B, Marathe VV | title = Forecasting individual pharmacokinetics | journal = Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 294–305 | date = September 1979 | pmid = 466923 | doi =  10.1002/cpt1979263294}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16353916"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bonate PL | title = Recommended reading in population pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamics | journal = The AAPS Journal | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = E363–73 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16353916 | pmc = 2750974 | doi = 10.1208/aapsj070237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain patient demographic, pathophysiological, and therapeutical features, such as body weight, excretory and metabolic functions, and the presence of other therapies, can regularly alter dose-concentration relationships. For example, steady-state concentrations of drugs eliminated mostly by the kidney are usually greater in patients suffering from renal failure than they are in patients with normal renal function receiving the same drug dosage. Population pharmacokinetics seeks to identify the measurable pathophysiologic factors that cause changes in the dose-concentration relationship and the extent of these changes so that, if such changes are associated with clinically significant shifts in the therapeutic index, dosage can be appropriately modified.
An advantage of population pharmacokinetic modelling is its ability to analyse sparse data sets (sometimes only one concentration measurement per patient is available).

== Clinical pharmacokinetics ==

Clinical pharmacokinetics (arising from the clinical use of population pharmacokinetics) is the direct application to a therapeutic situation of knowledge regarding a drug’s pharmacokinetics and the characteristics of a population that a patient belongs to (or can be ascribed to).

An example is the relaunch of the use of [[ciclosporin]] as an [[Immunosuppressive drug|immunosuppressor]] to facilitate organ transplant. The drug's therapeutic properties were initially demonstrated, but it was almost never used after it was found to cause [[nephrotoxicity]] in a number of patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first2 = R.|last2= García del Moral|first3= M.|last3= Andujar |first1=F.|last1= O'Valle |url = http://www.revistanefrologia.com/es-publicacion-nefrologia-articulo-mecanismos-nefrotoxicidad-por-ciclosporina-a-nivel-celular-X0211699595022690|title = Mecanismos de nefrotoxicidad por ciclosporina A a nivel celular|language =Spanish|journal = Nefrologia|volume = 15 Supplement 1|date = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was then realized that it was possible to individualize a patient's dose of ciclosporin by analysing the patients plasmatic concentrations (pharmacokinetic monitoring). This practice has allowed this drug to be used again and has facilitated a great number of organ transplants.

Clinical monitoring is usually carried out by determination of plasma concentrations as this data is usually the easiest to obtain and the most reliable. The main reasons for determining a drug’s plasma concentration include:&lt;ref&gt;Joaquín Herrera Carranza [https://books.google.com/books?id=7Vw7a4wBzRgC Manual de farmacia clínica y Atención Farmacéutica] (in Spanish). Published by Elsevier España, 2003; page 159. {{ISBN|84-8174-658-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Robin Lane April 2010.jpg|thumb|Robin Lane performing at a [[Record Store Day]] 2010 event at [[That's Entertainment (comic shop)|That's Entertainment]]]]

'''Robin Lane''' (born 1947, [[Los Angeles, California]]) is an American rock singer and songwriter.  Her band, Robin Lane &amp; the Chartbusters, released three albums on [[Warner Bros. Records]] in the early 1980s, and was best known for its single "When Things Go Wrong".

Robin Lane grew up in Los Angeles.  Her father was [[Ken Lane]], songwriter and pianist for [[Dean Martin]]; her mother was a model.  While in her teens, Robin began singing and performing in folk-rock clubs in southern California.  From 1968 to 1970 she was married to future [[The Police|Police]] lead guitarist [[Andy Summers]]. In 1969, she sang backing vocals on the song "Round &amp; Round" on [[Neil Young]]'s album ''[[Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere]]''.  In the 1970s, Lane moved to eastern Pennsylvania and then to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], where her musical interests turned from folk-rock to a harder sound influenced by the growing [[punk rock]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] genres.

In 1978, Lane formed the Chartbusters with Asa Brebner and Leroy Radcliffe (of [[The Modern Lovers]]), Scott Baerenwald and Tim Jackson.  She had signed with [[Private Stock Records]], which shortly afterward went out of business.  After [[Jerry Wexler]] saw a Chartbusters show, however, he signed the band to [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Brothers]].  Their first album, ''Robin Lane &amp; the Chartbusters'' (1980) featured the singles "When Things Go Wrong" and "Why Do You Tell Lies?", earned favorable reviews, and received widespread airplay; the music video for "When Things Go Wrong" was the 11th song shown on [[MTV]]'s [[First music videos aired on MTV|first American broadcast day]], August 1, 1981.  The band had two more releases on Warner, the EP "5 Live" (1980) and "Imitation Life" (1981).  The limited commercial success of these records, combined with business disputes and Lane's desire to have a child, led to the breakup of the Chartbusters in 1983.

Lane continued writing and recording music, and released the independent EP "Heart Connection" (1984), the self-produced cassette ''In Concert'' (1989), and the full-length ''Catbird Seat'' (1995).  She co-wrote the song "Wishing On Telstar" for the 1991 [[Susanna Hoffs]] album ''[[When You're a Boy]]''.

In 2001, Lane and several of the Chartbusters regrouped for two reunion concerts, and decided to continue recording and performing; they released "Piece of Mind" in 2003.  Since then, Lane has moved to western Massachusetts, where she works with the [[Turners Falls, Massachusetts]] Women's Resource Center, using [[music therapy]] to aid survivors of abuse.
On 4 April 2014 Tim Jackson premiered his film of Lane's life and career, ''When Things Go Wrong'', followed by a Q &amp; A and a set by Robin Lane &amp; the Chartbusters, at the Regent Theatre in Arlington, Massachusetts.

'''Robstep''' ({{zh|c=易步|p=Yì Bù|l=Easy Step}}) is a line of two-wheeled, self-balancing, battery-powered [[electric vehicle]]s invented by Dongguan Robstep Robot Co., Ltd. of [[Guangdong]], Dongguan, China. The name "Robstep" is a [[portmanteau]] of the words "robot" and "step", meaning robotic steps. The devices have been compared to [[Segways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futurezone.at/produkte/robstep-mobiler-spass-ohne-auftrag/39.376.367|last=Kotrba|first=David|date=19 December 2013|title=Robstep: Mobiler Spaß ohne Auftrag|work=[[Futurezone]]|language=German|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haizhou"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2012-05/04/content_15209808.htm|title=It's a bird! It's a plane! No! It's a Robin|last=Haizhou|first=Zhang|date=2012-05-04|work=[[China Daily]]|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computers and motors inside of the device keep the Robstep upright when powered on with balancing enabled. A user commands the Robstep to go forward by shifting their weight forward on the platform, and backward by shifting their weight backward. The Robstep detects, as it balances, the change in its [[center of mass]], and first establishes and then maintains a corresponding speed, forward or backward. [[Gyroscopic sensor]]s and fluid-based [[level sensor]]s detect the weight shift. To turn, the user presses the handlebar to the left or the right.
Robsteps are driven by electric motors and can reach a speed of 9.3 miles per hour (15&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name="Haizhou" /&gt;

Robsteps are comparable to Segways.  They are known as human transporters and personal mobility devices.  Some customers use them as a disability device.  There are now two different types of batteries fitted on these devices.  One is considered a dangerous good for airline travel (lithium ion) and the other type is acceptable (nickel metal hydride).  Engineering conversion from one battery type to the other is now available from various after-market engineering firms and the conversion is indicated by an authorized sticker placed adjacent to the name plate on modified units.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6450">'''Sifap''' ("'''s'''troke '''i'''n young '''Fa'''bry '''p'''atients") is a Pan-[[Europe]]an study dedicated to investigating the correlation of juvenile [[stroke]] and a [[genetic disorder]] known as [[Fabry's disease]]. It was initiated by [[University of Rostock]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="SifapHome"/&gt; In recruiting 5,000 patients aged 18 to 55 it will be the largest study on stroke in the young. Approximately 50 study centres from about 15 European countries are participating in the project. The study is divided into two parts: sifap1 and sifap2. Whereas sifap1 analyses the frequency of Fabry disease within the patient cohort, sifap2 controls and investigates the rehabilitation phase of diagnosed Fabry patients.

==Background==
The goal of the study is to show that Fabry disease has to be considered to be one of the most frequent genetic causes of juvenile [[stroke]]. To date the frequency of Fabry disease among general population has been estimated to be around 1:40,000. However, recent investigations have shown that Fabry disease can occur in 1 of 83 stroke patients aged 18–55 and between 1 of 3,500 to 1 of 4,500 individuals of the general population. Sifap aims at scientifically testing and supporting these findings.

==Progress==
After the proof-of-principle phase (April to December 2007) the official start of the study was January 1, 2008. Sifap1 patients were recruited until June 30, 2009. Sifap2 runs simultaneously, and is scheduled to conclude on June 30, 2012.

==Technique==
[[File:MG 0581a.jpg|thumb|Preparation of the robot for the analysis]]
One of sifap’s unique characteristics is the fully automated analysis and storage of specimens in combination with the complete digital and web-based data handling. A pipetting robot extracts DNA from specimens and analyses them for Fabry disease. Afterwards, specimens are automatically stored in a biobank and consequently are available for future investigations.

==Committees==
In order to control, advise and establish professional structures two committees were formed. Publication issues and sifap basics are the responsibility of the steering committee. The nine members are: Miron Ginsberg (Miami, USA), Michael Hennerici (Mannheim, Germany), Christof Kessler (Greifswald, Germany), Edwin Kolodny (New York, USA), Peter Martus (Berlin, Germany), Bo Norrving (Lund, Sweden), Erich-Bernd Ringelstein (Münster, Germany), Peter Rothwell (Oxford, UK) and Graham Vanables (Sheffield, UK)
The biobank committee oversees the administration of stored specimens and decides in formal meetings on proposed new projects. The biobank committee consists of: Natan Bornstein (Tel Aviv, Israel), Peter Paul DeDeyn (Antwerp, Belgium), Martin Dichgans (Munich, Germany), Franz Fazekas (Graz, Austria), Hugh Markus (London, UK), Olaf Rieß (Tübingen, Germany) and Arndt Rolfs (Rostock, Germany).

The '''Sistema Único de Saúde''' ({{IPA-pt|sis.ˈte.mɐ ˈu.ni.ku dʒi sa.ˈu.dʒi}}, ''Single Health System''), better known by the acronym '''SUS''', is [[Brazil]]'s [[publicly funded health care]] system. SUS was created in 1990, and since then went through many revisions and reorganizations with the objective of better organizing its scope, reach and [[Decentralization|decentralizing]] its hierarchy. The system is entirely free of any cost, for any person, including foreigners.

==Creation==
After the fall of the [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]] that ruled the country for 20 years, the [[Brazilian Constitution|Brazilian Constitution of 1988]] sought to guarantee more rights and freedoms to the population, and set many objectives of social development. Among those, improving health care was set as a priority:

{{cquote|Health is a right of all and an obligation of the State, guaranteed by socioeconomic policies which seek to the reduction of the risk of disease and of other grievances and to the universal and equal access to the actions and services in its promotion, protection and recuperation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conselho.saude.gov.br/web_sus20anos/20anossus/legislacao/constituicaofederal.pdf ''Brazilian Constitution of 1988'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Two years later on 19 September 1990, the objectives set in the constitution were consolidated in the letter of the law by law number 8.080, whose articles created the SUS and defined its actuation.&lt;ref name="lei8080"&gt;LEI Nº 8.080, DE 19 DE SETEMBRO DE 1990 http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/l8080.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to that, only people who contributed with the [[social security]] were able to receive health care. The creation of SUS was important in the sense that more than 80% of the Brazilian population depend on it to receive medical treatment. Brazil provides [[two-tier health care]], but almost 25% of the population pay for private insurance.&lt;ref&gt;brasil.gov.br [http://www.brasil.gov.br/sobre/saude/atendimento/plano-de-saude-privado "Planos de Saúde Privado" ("Planos de Saúde Privado")]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The SUS's objectives are, by the law of its creation, defined as:&lt;ref name="lei8080" /&gt;
* The identification and publication of determinant and conditioning factors for human health;
* The formulation of the health policy;
* Assistance to the people through actions of promotion, protection and recuperation of health, with the integrated realization of assistance actions and preventive activities;
* [[Sanitation]] and [[health surveillance]];
* [[Epidemiology|Epidemiological]] vigilance;
* [[Occupational safety]] and health;
* Integral therapeutic assistance, including pharmaceutic;
* Organization of the formation of [[health human resources]];
* Nutritional vigilance and orientation;
* Collaboration with the protection of environment, including work environment;
* Formulation of policies regarding [[Pharmaceutical drugs|drugs]], [[Medical equipment|equipment]], immunobiologicals and other resources of interest for human health, and participation in its production;
* The control and fiscalization of services, products e substances of interest for human health;
* The fiscalization and inspection of food, water and beverages for human consumption;
* The participation in the control and fiscalization of the production, transportation, safety and utilization of [[radioactive]], toxic, and psychoactive substances and products;
* Scientific and technological developments in its area of actuation;
* The formulation and execution of the national policy for blood and its derivatives.

'''Sleep hygiene''' is the recommended behavioral and environmental practice that is intended to promote better quality sleep.&lt;ref name='SH2014'/&gt; This recommendation was developed in the late 1970s as a method to help people with mild to moderate [[insomnia]], but, {{as of|2014|lc=y}}, the evidence for effectiveness of individual recommendations is "limited and inconclusive".&lt;ref name='SH2014'/&gt;  Clinicians assess the sleep hygiene of people who present with insomnia and other conditions, such as depression, and offer recommendations based on the assessment.  Sleep hygiene recommendations include establishing a regular sleep schedule, using naps with care, not exercising physically or mentally too close to bedtime, limiting worry, limiting exposure to light in the hours before sleep, getting out of bed if sleep does not come, not using bed for anything but sleep and sex, avoiding alcohol as well as nicotine, caffeine, and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime, and having a peaceful, comfortable and dark sleep environment.

==Assessment==
Practice of sleep hygiene and knowledge of sleep hygiene practices can be assessed with measures such as the Sleep Hygiene Index,&lt;ref name="JDM_v29"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mastin|first1=David F.|last2=Bryson|first2=Jeff|last3=Corwyn|first3=Robert|title=Assessment of Sleep Hygiene Using the Sleep Hygiene Index|journal=Journal of Behavioral Medicine|date=24 March 2006|volume=29|issue=3|pages=223–227|doi=10.1007/s10865-006-9047-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sleep Hygiene Awareness and Practice Scale,&lt;ref name="JDM_v29" /&gt; or the Sleep Hygiene Self-Test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cho|first1=Sungkun|last2=Kim|first2=Gye-Seok|last3=Lee|first3=Jang-Han|title=Psychometric evaluation of the sleep hygiene index: a sample of patients with chronic pain|journal=Health and Quality of Life Outcomes|date=2013|volume=11|issue=1|pages=213|doi=10.1186/1477-7525-11-213}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; For younger individuals, sleep hygiene can be assessed by the Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale or the Children's Sleep Hygiene Scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lewandowski AS, Toliver-Sokol M, Palermo TM |title=Evidence-based review of subjective pediatric sleep measures |journal=J Pediatr Psychol |volume=36 |issue=7 |pages=780–93 |date=August 2011  |pmid=21227912 |pmc=3146754 |doi=10.1093/jpepsy/jsq119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recommendations==
Clinicians choose among recommendations for improving sleep quality for each individual and counselling is presented as a form of patient education.&lt;ref name=Hauri11&gt;Hauri, P. (2011). Sleep/wake lifestyle modifications: Sleep hygiene. In Barkoukis TR, Matheson JK, Ferber R, Doghramji K, eds.   ''Therapy in Sleep Medicine.''  Elsevier Saunders, Philadelphia, PA. pp. 151–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sleep schedule===
One set of recommendations relates to the timing of sleep. For adults, getting less than 7–8 hours of sleep is associated with a number of physical and mental health deficits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luyster|first1=Faith S.|last2=Strollo|first2=Patrick J.|last3=Zee|first3=Phyllis C.|last4=Walsh|first4=James K.|title=Sleep: A Health Imperative|journal=Sleep|date=1 June 2012|doi=10.5665/sleep.1846|pmc=3353049}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore a top sleep hygiene recommendation is allowing enough time for sleep. Clinicians will frequently advise that these hours of sleep are obtained at night instead of through napping, because while naps can be helpful after [[sleep deprivation]], under normal conditions naps may be detrimental to nighttime sleep.&lt;ref name='Hauri11'/&gt; Negative effects of napping on sleep and performance have been found to depend on duration and timing, with shorter midday naps being the least disruptive.&lt;ref name='Hauri11'/&gt;  There is also focus on the importance of awakening around the same time every morning and generally having a regular sleep schedule.&lt;ref name='SH2014'/&gt;

===Activities===
Exercise is an activity that can facilitate or inhibit sleep quality; people who exercise experience better quality of sleep than those who do not,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--

This review is fifteen years old !!

--&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Driver|first1=Helen S.|last2=Taylor|first2=Sheila R.|title=Exercise and sleep|journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews|date=August 2000|volume=4|issue=4|pages=387–402|doi=10.1053/smrv.2000.0110 |pmid=12531177}}&lt;/ref&gt; but exercising too late in the day can be activating and delay falling asleep.&lt;ref name='Hauri11'/&gt; Increasing exposure to bright and natural light during the daytime and avoiding bright light in the hours before bedtime may help promote a sleep-wake schedule aligned with nature's daily light-dark cycle.&lt;ref name='light'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Czeisler|first1=C. A.|last2=Gooley|first2=J. J.|title=Sleep and Circadian Rhythms in Humans|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology|date=January 2007|volume=72|issue=1|pages=579–97|doi=10.1101/sqb.2007.72.064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities that reduce physiological arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended.&lt;ref name='SH2014'/&gt; Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed has been shown to delay falling asleep.&lt;ref name='Stepanski'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stepanski|first1=Edward J|last2=Wyatt|first2=James K|title=Use of sleep hygiene in the treatment of insomnia|journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews|date=June 2003|volume=7|issue=3|pages=215–25|doi=10.1053/smrv.2001.0246|pmid=12927121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime.&lt;ref name='Stepanski'/&gt; Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep,&lt;ref name='Hauri11'/&gt; so in such situations a person may be advised to get out of bed and try something else for a brief amount of time.&lt;ref name='Stepanski'/&gt;

Generally, for people experiencing difficulties with sleep, spending less time in bed results in deeper and more continuous sleep,&lt;ref name='Hauri11'/&gt; so clinicians will frequently recommend eliminating use of the bed for any activities except sleep (or sex).&lt;ref name='Morin'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morin|first1=CM|last2=Bootzin|first2=RR|last3=Buysse|first3=DJ|last4=Edinger|first4=JD|last5=Espie|first5=CA|last6=Lichstein|first6=KL|title=Psychological and behavioral treatment of insomnia:update of the recent evidence (1998–2004).|journal=Sleep|date=November 2006|volume=29|issue=11|pages=1398–414|pmid=17162986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foods and substances===
A number of foods and substances have been found to disturb sleep, due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands. Avoiding [[nicotine]], [[caffeine]] (including coffee, energy drinks, soft drinks, tea, chocolate, and some pain relievers), and other [[stimulant]]s in the hours before bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sin|first1=Celia WM|last2=Ho|first2=Jacqueline SC|last3=Chung|first3=Joanne WY|title=Systematic review on the effectiveness of caffeine abstinence on the quality of sleep|journal=Journal of Clinical Nursing|date=January 2009|volume=18|issue=1|pages=13–21|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2702.2008.02375.x|pmid=19120728}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaehne|first1=Andreas|last2=Loessl|first2=Barbara|last3=Bárkai|first3=Zsuzsanna|last4=Riemann|first4=Dieter|last5=Hornyak|first5=Magdolna|title=Effects of nicotine on sleep during consumption, withdrawal and replacement therapy|journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews|date=October 2009|volume=13|issue=5|pages=363–77|doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2008.12.003|pmid=19345124}}&lt;/ref&gt; as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boutrel B, Koob GF |title=What keeps us awake: the neuropharmacology of stimulants and wakefulness-promoting medications |journal=Sleep |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=1181–94 |date=September 2004  |pmid=15532213 |doi=10.1093/sleep/27.6.1181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians, because, although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially, the arousal caused by metabolizing alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep.&lt;ref name='SH2014'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Irish|first1=Leah A.|last2=Kline|first2=Christopher E|last3=Gunn|first3=Heather E|last4=Buysse|first4=Daniel J|last5=Hall|first5=Martica H|title=The role of sleep hygiene in promoting public health: A review of empirical evidence|journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews|date=October 2014|doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2014.10.001|pmid= 25454674|pmc=4400203|volume=22|pages=23–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoking tobacco products before bed is also thought to reduce one's quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep, leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Abnormal Psychology: An Integrative Approach|last = Barlow|first = David|publisher = Wadsworth|year = 2012|isbn = 9781111343620|location = Belmont, CA|pages = 301|edition = 6th|last2 = Durand|first2 = Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both consumption of a large meal just before bedtime, requiring effort to metabolize it all, and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep;&lt;ref name='Hauri11'/&gt; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack before bedtime. Lastly, limiting intake of liquids before bedtime can prevent interruptions due to urinations.&lt;ref name='Hauri11'/&gt;

===Sleep environment===
Arranging a sleep environment that is quiet, very dark, and cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures have been shown to disrupt continuous sleep.&lt;ref name='light'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Xie H, Kang J, Mills GH |title=Clinical review: The impact of noise on patients' sleep and the effectiveness of noise reduction strategies in intensive care units |journal=Crit Care |volume=13 |issue=2 |page=208 |year=2009 |pmid=19344486 |pmc=2689451 |doi=10.1186/cc7154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other recommendations that are frequently made, though less studied, include selecting comfortable mattresses, bedding, and pillows,&lt;ref name='Hauri11'/&gt; and eliminating a visible bedroom clock, to prevent focusing on time passing when trying to fall asleep.&lt;ref name='Hauri11'/&gt;

In 2015, a [[systematic review]] of studies on [[mattress]]es concluded that medium-firm, custom-inflated mattresses were best for pain and [[Neutral spine|neutral spinal]] alignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Radwan|first = Ahmed|last2 = Fess|first2 = Philip|last3 = James|first3 = Darcy|last4 = Murphy|first4 = John|last5 = Myers|first5 = Joseph|last6 = Rooney|first6 = Michelle|last7 = Taylor|first7 = Jason|last8 = Torii|first8 = Alissa|title = Effect of different mattress designs on promoting sleep quality, pain reduction, and spinal alignment in adults with or without back pain; systematic review of controlled trials|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352721815001400|journal = Sleep Health|volume = 1|issue = 4|pages = 257–267|doi = 10.1016/j.sleh.2015.08.001|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Sleep hygiene studies use different sets of sleep hygiene recommendations,&lt;ref name='Stepanski'/&gt; and the evidence that improving sleep hygiene improves sleep quality is weak and inconclusive {{as of|2014|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name='SH2014'/&gt; Most research on sleep hygiene principles has been conducted in clinical settings, and there is a need for more research on non-clinical populations.&lt;ref name='SH2014'/&gt;

The strength of research support for each recommendation varies; some of the more robustly researched and supported recommendations include the negative effects of noisy sleep environments, alcohol consumption in the hours before sleep, engaging in mentally difficult tasks before sleep, and trying too hard to fall asleep.&lt;ref name='Hauri11'/&gt; There is a lack of evidence for the effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations, including getting a more comfortable mattress, removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, and limiting liquids.&lt;ref name='Hauri11'/&gt; Other recommendations, such as the effects of napping or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of napping, for example, seem to depend on the length and timing of napping, in conjunction with how much cumulative sleep an individual has had in recent nights.&lt;ref name='SH2014'/&gt;

There is support showing positive sleep outcomes for people who follow more than one sleep hygiene recommendation.&lt;ref name='Hauri11'/&gt;

While there is inconclusive evidence that sleep hygiene alone is effective as a treatment for insomnia, some research studies have shown improvement in insomnia for patients who receive sleep hygiene education in combination with [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] practices.&lt;ref name='de Biase'/&gt;

==Special populations==
Sleep hygiene is a central component of [[cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morin|first1=CM|last2=Bootzin|first2=RR|last3=Buysse|first3=DJ|last4=Edinger|first4=JD|last5=Espie|first5=CA|last6=Lichstein|first6=KL|title=Psychological and behavioral treatment of insomnia:update of the recent evidence (1998–2004)|journal=Sleep|date=November 2006|volume=29|issue=11|pages=1398–414|pmid=17162986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sleep hygiene recommendations have been shown to reduce or eliminate the symptoms of insomnia. Specific [[sleep disorder]]s may require other or additional treatment approaches, and continuing difficulties with sleep may require additional assistance from healthcare providers.&lt;ref name=niosh2012&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/768414_2 |title= Running on Empty: Fatigue and Healthcare Professionals: The Consequences of Inadequate Sleep |publisher= NIOSH: Workplace Safety and Health |date= August 2, 2012 |author= Caruso, Claire C |accessdate= December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

College students are at risk of engaging in poor sleep hygiene and also of being unaware of the resulting effects of sleep deprivation.&lt;ref name='brown'&gt;{{MEDRS|date=December 2014}} {{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Franklin C.|last2=Buboltz|first2=Walter C.|last3=Soper|first3=Barlow|title=Relationship of Sleep Hygiene Awareness, Sleep Hygiene Practices, and Sleep Quality in University Students|journal=Behavioral Medicine|date=January 2002|volume=28|issue=1|pages=33–8|doi=10.1080/08964280209596396|pmid= 12244643}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of irregular weekly schedules and the campus environment, college students may be likely to have variable sleep-wake schedules across the week, take naps, drink caffeine or alcohol near bedtime, and sleep in disruptive sleeping environments.&lt;ref name='brown'/&gt; Because of this, researchers recommend sleep hygiene education on college campuses.&lt;ref name='brown'/&gt;  [[Harvard University]], for example, requires all incoming first-year undergraduates to take a short online course on the subject before the fall semester begins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2018/08/31/harvard-sleep-101-freshmen Sleep 101: Harvard Freshmen Required To Take Sleep Course Before School Begins]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[shift work]]ers have difficulty maintaining a healthy sleep-wake schedule due to night or irregular work hours.&lt;ref name='aker'&gt;{{cite journal | author = Åkerstedt T | year = 1998 | title = Shift work and disturbed sleep/wakefulness | url = | journal = Sleep Medicine Reviews | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 117–28 | doi=10.1016/s1087-0792(98)90004-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shift workers need to be strategic about napping and drinking caffeine, as these practices may be necessary for work productivity and safety, but should be timed carefully. Because shift workers may need to sleep while other individuals are awake, additional sleeping environment changes should include reducing disturbances by turning off phones and posting signs on bedroom doors to inform others when they are sleeping.&lt;ref name='aker'/&gt;

Due to symptoms of low mood and energy, individuals with [[major depressive disorder|depression]] may be likely to have behaviors that are counter to good sleep hygiene, such as taking naps during the day, consuming alcohol near bedtime, and consuming large amounts of caffeine during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Doghramji K | year = 2003 | title = Treatment strategies for sleep disturbance in patients with depression | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 24–9 | pmid = 14658932 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to sleep hygiene education, [[light therapy|bright light therapy]] can be a useful treatment for individuals with depression. Not only can morning bright light therapy help establish a better sleep-wake schedule, but it also has been shown to be effective for treating depression directly, especially when related to [[seasonal affective disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Golden|first1=RN|last2=Gaynes|first2=BN|last3=Ekstrom|first3=RD|last4=Hamer|first4=RM|last5=Jacobsen|first5=FM|last6=Suppes|first6=T|last7=Wisner|first7=KL|last8=Nemeroff|first8=CB|title=The efficacy of light therapy in the treatment of mood disorders: a review and meta-analysis of the evidence.|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|date=April 2005|volume=162|issue=4|pages=656–62|pmid=15800134|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.4.656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals with breathing difficulties due to [[asthma]] or [[allergy|allergies]] may experience additional barriers to quality sleep that can be addressed by specific variations of sleep hygiene recommendations.

==Implementation==
Sleep hygiene strategies include advice about timing of sleep and food intake in relationship to exercise and sleeping environment.&lt;ref name='Hauri11'/&gt; Recommendations depend on knowledge of the individual situation; counselling is presented as a form of patient education.&lt;ref name='Stepanski'/&gt;

As attention to the role of sleep hygiene in promoting public health has grown, there has been an increase in the number of resources available in print and on the internet.&lt;ref name='SH2014'/&gt; Organizations running public health initiatives include the [[National Sleep Foundation]] and the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, both of which have created public websites with sleep hygiene resources, such as tips for sleep hygiene, instructional videos, sleep hygiene self-assessments, poll statistics on sleep hygiene, and tools to find sleep professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Sleep Foundation|title=National Sleep Foundation|url=http://sleepfoundation.org/|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Division of Sleep Medicine  at Harvard Medical School and WGBH Educational Foundation|title=Healthy Sleep|url=http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cooperative agreement between the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the [[American Academy of Sleep Medicine]] was established in 2013 to coordinate the [[National Healthy Sleep Awareness Project]], with one of their aims being to promote sleep hygiene awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=American Academy of Sleep Medicine|title=AASM partners with CDC to address chronic sleep loss epidemic|url=http://www.aasmnet.org/articles.aspx?id=4320|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|title=National Healthy Sleep Awareness Project|url=https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/projects_partners.htm|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While the term ''sleep hygiene'' was first introduced in 1939 by [[Nathaniel Kleitman]], a book published in 1977 by psychologist Peter Hauri introduced the concept within the context of modern sleep medicine.&lt;ref name='de Biase'&gt;de Biase et al. Sleep Hygiene. Chapter 27 in Sleepiness and human impact assessment. Eds. Garborino LN et al. Springer Milan, 2014. {{ISBN|978-88-470-5388-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|289}}&lt;ref name='Gigli'/&gt; In this book Hauri outlined a list of behavioral rules intended to promote improved sleep.&lt;ref name='Gigli'/&gt; Similar concepts are credited to Paolo Mantegazza who published a related original book in 1864.&lt;ref name='Gigli'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gigli|first1=Gian Luigi|last2=Valente|first2=Mariarosaria|title=Should the definition of "sleep hygiene" be antedated of a century? A historical note based on an old book by Paolo Mantegazza, rediscovered|journal=Neurological Sciences|date=30 June 2012|volume=34|issue=5|pages=755–60|doi=10.1007/s10072-012-1140-8|pmid=22752854}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1990 publication of the ''[[International Classification of Sleep Disorders]]'' (ICSD) introduced the diagnostic category Inadequate Sleep Hygiene.&lt;ref name='Gigli'/&gt;  Inadequate sleep hygiene was a subclassification of Chronic Insomnia Disorder in the ICSD-II published in 2005; it was removed from the 2014 ICSD-III along with two other classifications, because "they were not felt to be reliably reproducible in clinical practice."&lt;ref&gt;Bonnet MH, Arand DL.  Overview of insomnia. UpToDate, Topic 7684 Version 15.0. Last updated: Sep 02, 2014. Page accessed: Dec 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific sleep hygiene recommendations have changed over time. For example, advice to simply avoid [[hypnotic|sleeping pills]] was included in early sets of recommendations, but as more drugs to help with sleep have been introduced, recommendations concerning their use have become more complex.&lt;ref name="Hauri11"/&gt;

The '''Student National Medical Association''' ('''SNMA'''), established in 1964, is the oldest and largest independent, student-run organization focused on the needs and concerns of black medical students in the [[United States]]. It was established as a subdivision of the [[National Medical Association]] in 1964 by medical students from [[Howard University]] and [[Meharry Medical College]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snma.org/about-history.php&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is committed to supporting current and future underrepresented minority medical students, addressing the needs of underserved communities, and increasing the number of clinically excellent, culturally competent and socially conscious physicians.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snma.org/about.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
SNMA has over 150 medical chapters, which implement educational, outreach, and mentoring activities consistent with the goals of the organization.  Premedical MAPS chapters work with their host SNMA chapters to hold workshops, speakers, medical campus tours, and advising sessions. Chapters belong to one of ten SNMA regions, each headed by a Regional Director.  The Regional Director supports chapter programs and oversees a regional medical education conference, as well as other regional activities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snma.org/about-organization-structure.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011-2012 program focus==
In spring 2011, National President Michael G. Knight introduced the 2010-2011 programmatic strategy that is focused on envisioning the SNMA's organizational future, engaging the SNMA membership, and empowering underserved communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://jsnma.org/2011/05/2011-2012-snma-executive-agenda/&lt;/ref&gt;

President Knight launched two Presidential Initiatives for the 2011-2012 administrative year.
* The “MED Project”, is designed to develop an SNMA membership base that is engaged, invested in the SNMA, and provided with tools to enhance their personal and professional development. The first component of this initiative involves the Membership Engagement and Development (MED) Forums, which are focused meetings designed to provide enrichment for participants in their areas of interest. The second component is “Project Success", which is focused on enhancing the academic support provided by the SNMA for its membership.
* The second initiative, “The Signature Collection,” is designed to further define the SNMA’s signature programs, and to optimize their effectiveness and prominence. The first component is the Pipeline Initiative, which is focused on the continued development of our Pipeline Mentoring Institute, and involves a partnership with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, whose programs successfully reach a large group of youth nationwide. The second is the Community Empowerment Initiative. It involves the SNMA Greater Than AIDS campaign, which builds upon our well-established Sexual Health Awareness Protocol and its specific focus on HIV/AIDS education and prevention.

==Annual Medical Education Conference==
[[File:AMEC2012 logo2.JPG|thumb|AMEC 2012 Logo]]

The SNMA Annual Medical Education Conference is a focal activity for the national organization. It is held each spring in various locations around the country. Its purpose is to enhance and facilitate career development, continuing education, and networking among minority medical students. Included in the AMEC is the annual session of the House of Delegates and the election of national officers. The conference attracts over 1,100 students and professionals from across the country, and is consistently the largest gathering of underrepresented minority medical students in the US.&lt;ref&gt;http://snma.org/amec-participant.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==National protocols==
National protocols are implemented on the local level by individual SNMA chapters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snma.org/programs.php&lt;/ref&gt;  They reflect the community service goals of the national organization.

===Pipeline programs===
* Youth Science Enrichment Program
This program is focused on working with elementary and junior high school students to spark their interest in science and health.
* Health Professions Recruitment Exposure Program
This initiative functions to increase the exposure of high school students to science and careers in the health sciences.
* Minority Association of Pre-medical Students
Pre-medical students are able to form SNMA MAPS chapters at their undergraduate institutions. There are currently over 100 MAPS chapters nationwide that are supported by local SNMA chapters.

===Minority Association of Premedical Students===
This initiative represents future underrepresented medical students. Though each chapter is different the goal of these on-campus associations is to unite historically underrepresented minorities that aspire to become physicians and provide them with resources and a social network of premedical students to facilitate the journey to medical school.

===Health Education and Prevention===
* Sexual Health Awareness
* Smoking Prevention
* Tissue &amp; Organ Donation Education Recruitment Program (TODER)
* Violence Prevention
* Mental Health: Treatment, Awareness, and Prevention
* [[Healthy People 2010]] Health Fairs
* Obesity Prevention

Like most issues of mental illness and death, suicide is generally viewed as a [[taboo]] subject in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asiaone.com/singapore/more-arrested-attempting-suicide|title=More arrested for attempting suicide|work=AsiaOne|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cleo.com.sg/life/how-can-i-help-someone-who-is-suicidal/|title=How Can I Help Someone Who Is Suicidal?|date=2018-02-26|work=CLEO Singapore|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;This may hinder efforts to reduce suicide rates. Some argue that changing public opinion on [[clinical depression]] and similar mental disorders may be a huge step in improving the rate of suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmedani|first=Brian K.|date=2011|title=Mental Health Stigma: Society, Individuals, and the Profession|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3248273/|journal=Journal of social work values and ethics|volume=8|issue=2|pages=4–1–4-16|issn=1553-6947|pmc=3248273|pmid=22211117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore ranked 105th by age-standardised suicide rate according to the [[World Health Organization]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.MHSUICIDEASDR?lang=en|title=GHO {{!}} By category {{!}} Suicide rate estimates, age-standardized - Estimates by country|website=apps.who.int|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the rate of suicide is rising, in 2016 it was 8.54, up from 8.43 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/slight-rise-in-number-of-suicides-last-year|title=Slight rise in number of suicides last year|last=hermes|date=2017-07-28|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
Suicide is illegal in Singapore.&lt;ref name="sla1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/is-it-illegal-to-commit-suicide-in-singapore-will-i-be-punished-if-my-attempt-at-suicide-fails/|title=Is it illegal to commit suicide in Singapore? Will I be punished if my attempt at suicide fails? {{!}} SingaporeLegalAdvice.com|work=SingaporeLegalAdvice.com|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 309 of the Penal Code states that ''"Whoever attempts to commit suicide, and does any act towards the commission of such offence, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871?ProvIds=pr309-#pr309-|title=Penal Code - Singapore Statutes Online|website=sso.agc.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The section is rarely enforced, between 2013 and 2015, only 0.6% of reported cases was brought to court.&lt;ref name="sla1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/penal-code-review-committee-punishment-not-the-answer-for-people-attempting-suicide|title=Penal Code review committee: Punishment not the answer for people attempting suicide|last=hermesauto|date=2018-09-09|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also illegal to abet or assist another person in suicide.&lt;ref name="sla1" /&gt; Section 306 of the Penal Code states that ''"If any person commits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871?ProvIds=pr306-#pr306-|title=Penal Code - Singapore Statutes Online|website=sso.agc.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 305, also relates to the abetting of suicide, however it is specifically if the suicide victim is [[minor (law)|less than 18 years old]], [[substance intoxication|intoxicated]] or mentally ill. It states that ''"If any person under 18 years of age, any insane person, any delirious person, any idiot, or any person in a state of intoxication, commits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871?ProvIds=pr305-#pr305-|title=Penal Code - Singapore Statutes Online|website=sso.agc.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2018, the Penal Code review committee called for the law on attempted suicide to be repealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/abolish-law-attempted-suicide-proposes-committee-tasked-review-penal-code|title=Penal Code review committee calls for law on attempted suicide to be scrapped|work=TODAYonline|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Preventative measures==
{{main|Samaritans of Singapore}}
There are numerous preventative policies with the intention of reducing suicide. The [[Samaritans of Singapore]] (SOS) is a non denominational, non-profit suicide prevention centre. SOS is a member of the [[National Council of Social Service]] and is also affiliated to the [[American Association of Suicidology]] (AAS), [[International Association for Suicide Prevention]], [[Befrienders Worldwide]], and [[International Federation of Telephonic Emergency Services ]](IFOTES). The organisation provides multiple services such as a 24-hour suicide hotline, professional counselling and crisis support. 

Another measure, as mentioned above was outlawing suicide and its abetment.

==Notable cases==

A notable case is the slayers suicide pact also known as the Sheng Long Fu suicides or Singapore teen suicide pact. The suicide pact, which took place on 23 August 2008, had 9 teenagers agreeing to it.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/teenage-slayers-suicide-pact-that-shook-singapore-moving-on-10606186|title=‘I thought of my mother’: Moving on from the teenage suicide pact that shook Singapore|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the day of the suicide, one backed out,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; two committed suicide and the rest backing down after seeing the first suicides.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20090918-168687.html|title=Coroner: No one was forced to jump|website=www.asiaone.com|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/The+New+Paper/Story/A1Story20090909-166794.html|title=Teen leader's reason for group suicide pact|website=news.asiaone.com|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20090918-168684.html|title='We were all laughing at him'|website=www.asiaone.com|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case shook the island and many were appalled by the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sg.asia-city.com/city-living/news/20-headlines-shook-singapore-last-20-years|title=20 headlines that rocked Singapore in the last 20 years|date=2015-03-26|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer pressure and a lack of maturity were blamed for the incident.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

This case revealed brought media attention to teenage suicides in Singapore and how peer pressure can be used to manipulate the young.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics blame Singapore for having high stress levels which lead to a higher amount of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/families/article/2111822/downsides-singapores-education-system-streaming-stress-and|title=Singapore’s price for education success: streaming, stress and suicides|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also much criticism towards the way Singapore deals with suicide victims and survivors. For example, critics point out the fact that suicide survivors should receive treatment instead of getting punished.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "aware"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aware.org.sg/2013/02/suicide-law-deters-the-distressed-from-getting-help/|title=Suicide laws deter treatment, not attempts|last=Lim|first=Corianna|date=20 February 2013|website=aware|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also argue that someone in the state of mind where they consider suicide as an option, likely would not think of legal repercussion as a strong deterrent.&lt;ref name= ":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "aware" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48490">'''Transnational child protection''' refers to the protection of children from violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect in an international setting. When a non-national child comes into contact with public authorities and service providers, a series of checks, assessments and immediate measures sets in to identify the child and to assess her or his situation. Article 19 of the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]] provides for the protection of children in and out of the home, including in their [[country of origin]], [[Home|residence]] or a third country. Article 2 of the Convention provides for the [[Child migration#Right to non-discrimination|right to non-discrimination]], meaning children have the right to protection regardless of the national origin or status of the child or his or her parents or [[legal guardians]].

A child may become party to a transnational child protection case because of a need for protection, including: due to [[international adoption]], being born to parents with different or [[Dual nationality|multiple nationalities]], being born in a different country than either parent's nationality, and [[Child migration|migrating]] or being [[Child trafficking|trafficked]]. Being an [[unaccompanied minor|unaccompanied or separated minor]] comes with particular challenges.

==Case assessment==

=== Best interests’ assessment and determination ===
[[Best interests]], which derives from Article 3 of the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]], says that “in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration”. Assessing the best interests of a child means to evaluate and balance “all the elements necessary to make a decision in a specific situation for a specific individual child or group of children”.

The right of the child to have her or his best interests taken as a primary consideration means that the child's interests have high priority and are not just one of several considerations. The assessment is specific to the child as an individual, making it important to establish a trust-based relationship with the child and to communicate effectively in a language that the girl or boy understands. The assessments should ideally involve a multi-disciplinary team of qualified professionals. Best interests’ assessments and determinations are two steps of a process that aims to identify the elements and facts relevant for a specific child.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 14 (2013), par. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In transnational cases, risk and resilience assessments are a central component of the best interests’ determination process because they consider the context of destination and origin and also how the risks and resiliency of the child will change on the basis of any decision taken, including with regard to continued [[child migration|migration]], transfer to another state or [[repatriation]].

A comprehensive best interests’ assessment and determination process considers the following in transnational cases:

* Establishing the child's identity and the identity of any accompanying persons and the quality of their relations
* Case assessment, including the following components: 
** [[Right to be heard|Hearing the child]] 
** Assessment of the child's situation, background and needs 
** Social situation and family assessment
** Gathering evidence including through forensic examinations and interviews with the child 
** Risk and security assessments
** Mapping sources of support, skills, potentials and resources for empowerment 
* Developing a [[Transnational child protection#Life projects|life project]] 
* Comprehensive child impact assessment of any potential decisions 
* Identification of a [[Transnational child protection#Durable solutions|durable solution]] 
* Continued assessments during the implementation of the durable solution with due follow-up, review and monitoring, and adjustments to the durable solution arrangements, if and as required, according to the best interests of the child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childcentre.info/public/PROTECT/Guidelines_-_promoting_the_Human_Rights_and_the_Best_Interest_of_the_Child_in_Transnational_Child_Protection_Cases.pdf CBSS Guidelines Promoting the Human Rights and the Best Interests of the Child in Transnational Child Protection Cases] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310013229/http://www.childcentre.info/public/PROTECT/Guidelines_-_promoting_the_Human_Rights_and_the_Best_Interest_of_the_Child_in_Transnational_Child_Protection_Cases.pdf |date=2016-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Assessments ====
[[Best interests]]’ assessments can be conducted informally and ad hoc or as formalised processes. Assessments look at everyday matters and decisions with more or less severe implications for the child. The best interests of a child may change significantly over time as children grow and their situations and capacities evolve, so their best interests’ may need to be reassessed periodically.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 14 (2013), par. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Determinations ====
[[Best interests]]’ determinations are formal processes conducted with the involvement of public authorities and professional decision makers. The objective of the best interests’ determination is to reach a decision based on national law that safeguards the rights of the child and promotes her or his well-being, safety and development. Decision-makers weigh and balance all the relevant factors of the case, giving due consideration to all the rights of the child and the obligations of public authorities and service providers towards the child. The objective of the best interests’ determination process is the identification of a durable solution. Best interests’ determinations are carried out when the issues at stake are expected to have significant implications on the child's present and future life.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 14 (2013), par. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources of information===
Assessments leading to best interests’ determinations are based on diverse information sources which need to be verified and cross-checked in order to establish a reliable understanding of the child's situation and background.
* The central source of information is the child. It is fundamental that the story, the background, the views, needs and aspirations of the [[Right to be heard|child are heard]] and taken into account. 
* Professionals from different backgrounds should together take into account their perspectives, expert reports, and opinions, including with regard to the child's history and health, education, care, protection and developmental needs. 
* When in migration or movement, information about the child's reasons for leaving and conditions and experiences during the journey should be collected and considered. National and local authorities in countries of origin and transit can be important sources of information. When contacting authorities in countries of transit and origin, professionals and officials in the country of destination consider best interests of the child and in respect of confidentiality rules, especially for children who are applying for asylum.
* Family tracing and assessment constitutes another important source of information. National central authorities, ministries, regional or local social services may provide relevant information and contacts established through international networks such as the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], the [[International Social Service]] or the [[International Organization of Migration]]. In some cases, local social services get directly in contact with their counterparts in the child's country of origin. The information gathering and sharing with these sources should respect national data protection laws and regulations and any matters of confidentiality related to the asylum procedure.
* Child-specific and gender-specific country of origin information needs to be developed and used and child-specific forms of persecution recognised. Country of origin information is available from national migration authorities and their networks, as well as the [[European Asylum Support Office]], [[UNICEF]] and the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]].  
* Law enforcement agencies may be important sources of information in cases involving law enforcement investigations, in civil or criminal matters. [[Europol]], [[Interpol]] and national police liaison officers based abroad, constitute important points of entry for law enforcement enquiries in international cases. 
* Judges may seek regional and international networks of judges to gather information if a trial involves a transnational case that has been heard by a court of law in another country.&lt;ref&gt;European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, Handbook on European Data Protection Law, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;KOK e.V, Data Protection Challenges in Anti-Trafficking Policies, A practical guide, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Data protection and confidentiality====
Caseworkers and officers are bound by the rules of [[data protection]] and [[confidentiality]] and have to respect the child's [[right to privacy]], a requirement which can conflict with the need to share information about children with other authorities or professionals within countries of destination and across borders. National and international laws of the country of destination apply to the processing and use of personal information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childcentre.info/public/PROTECT/CBSS_4th_Expert_Meeting_Riga_November_2014_Full_Meeting_Report.pdf 4th PROTECT Expert Meeting], Riga, November 2014, presentations by Philip Ishola, Independent Child Protection, Human Trafficking, Human Rights Consultant, UK and Aiga Balode, Deputy Director, Data State Inspectorate of Latvia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;KOK e.V, Data Protection Challenges in Anti-Trafficking Policies, A practical guide, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of asylum seekers, confidentiality rules are observed when information is sought from or transferred to countries of origin. The authorities that receive and assess an asylum application must not inform the authorities of the applicant's country of origin about the asylum claim and must not share any information about the applicant with the country of origin. Confidentiality rules apply also for the communication with countries of origin that are considered safe. When an asylum application has been rejected and all legal remedies are exhausted, the country of destination is authorised to share limited personal data with the authorities of the country of origin in order to facilitate return. This may be necessary when the person has no valid [[identity documents]]. The fact that the person has applied for asylum must however not be disclosed to the authorities in the country of origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childcentre.info/public/PROTECT/CBSS_4th_Expert_Meeting_Riga_November_2014_Full_Meeting_Report.pdf 4th PROTECT Expert Meeting], Riga, November 2014, presentations by Philip Ishola, Independent Child Protection, Human Trafficking, Human Rights Consultant, UK and Aiga Balode, Deputy Director, Data State Inspectorate of Latvia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;KOK e.V, Data Protection Challenges in Anti-Trafficking Policies, A practical guide, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-agency and multi-disciplinary cooperation===
[[Best interests]]’ assessments and determination processes use the knowledge and perspectives from different professional groups in order to achieve a holistic understanding of the child’s situation and background. With the child at the center, officials and professionals from different backgrounds assess, plan and manage each case. The process benefits from trusted partnerships of multi-stakeholder and inter-disciplinary cooperation within countries and across borders. Free exchange of information among professionals, volunteers and caregivers provides an understanding of the different laws and regulations concerning the child as well as the child’s situation, experiences, needs and aspirations. A common understanding of key concepts, terms and definitions, familiarity with the mandates of each partner, clear regulations of working routines, including clear regulation of data protection and confidentiality, and rules for the division of tasks and leadership, ideally in an institutionalised context, enables good communication among stakeholders. The benefits of inter-agency and multi-disciplinary cooperation include:

* a balanced and [[holistic]] approach to the assessment and determination of the child’s best interests; 
* the views of the child inform the action of each professional or official while reducing the number of interviews or formal hearings with the child to a minimum; 
* the work is conducted effectively and efficiently, especially when approaches are child-sensitive and [[child-centred]], giving the child meaningful opportunities to be informed and heard, reducing risks of secondary victimisation during investigations and procedures, while also reducing the strain on individual professionals or agencies; 
* decision making processes are safe and sound and lead to rights-based and sustainable outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childcentre.info/public/PROTECT/Guidelines_-_promoting_the_Human_Rights_and_the_Best_Interest_of_the_Child_in_Transnational_Child_Protection_Cases.pdf CBSS Guidelines Promoting the Human Rights and the Best Interests of the Child in Transnational Child Protection Cases] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310013229/http://www.childcentre.info/public/PROTECT/Guidelines_-_promoting_the_Human_Rights_and_the_Best_Interest_of_the_Child_in_Transnational_Child_Protection_Cases.pdf |date=2016-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identification ===
Identification determines the child’s identity as part of a best interests’ assessment. Identification considers nationality, upbringing, ethnic, cultural and linguistic background of the child. Vulnerabilities and protection needs connected to the child's identity and background are identified.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No.6 (2005), par. 20. Committee on the Rights of the Child, The Rights of All Children in the Context of International Migration, Background Paper, Day of General Discussion, 2012, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, especially when children cannot present valid identity and [[travel documents]], establishing the identity of a child is a process that requires communication and information exchange between countries of origin and arrival. It entails the identification of a child's name and age, national and ethnic origin, family relations as well as the circumstances of the child's mobility. The identification process might also require an assessment of the nature of the relations between a child and the person they are traveling with.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No.6 (2005), par. 20. Committee on the Rights of the Child, The Rights of All Children in the Context of International Migration, Background Paper, Day of General Discussion, 2012, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Age assessment===

Age assessments are conducted when children arrive to a country without valid [[identity documents]] or the validity of their documents is questioned. It is not uncommon for children from less developed countries to not be registered at birth, making reliable information about their age and identity difficult for authorities in countries of destination to access.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR Guidelines on Unaccompanied and Separated Children Seeking Asylum, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF, Age Assessment: A technical note. UNHCR Guidelines on International Child Protection: Child asylum claims, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Separated Children in Europe Programme: Statement on Good Practice and Position Paper on Age Assessment in the Context of Separated Children in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EU 2011 Anti-trafficking Directive, Article 13.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EU Asylum Procedures Directive, Article 25.5. CRC General Comment No 6, par. 31(i). UNICEF and UNHCR Safe and Sound, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF Guidelines on the Protection of Child Victims of Trafficking, par. 3.1.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Asylum Support Office, Age Assessment Practice in Europe, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Identity established in a country of transit may appear incorrect. This could be the case with erroneous statements or assessments of age made in a first point of arrival and challenged or contested by the child or the authorities later on. The child or the authorities might want to fix this.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR Guidelines on Unaccompanied and Separated Children Seeking Asylum, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF, Age Assessment: A technical note. UNHCR Guidelines on International Child Protection: Child asylum claims, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Separated Children in Europe Programme: Statement on Good Practice and Position Paper on Age Assessment in the Context of Separated Children in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EU 2011 Anti-trafficking Directive, Article 13.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EU Asylum Procedures Directive, Article 25.5. CRC General Comment No 6, par. 31(i). UNICEF and UNHCR Safe and Sound, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF Guidelines on the Protection of Child Victims of Trafficking, par. 3.1.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Asylum Support Office, Age Assessment Practice in Europe, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relevance====

Establishing the age of the person is relevant for a range of matters:

* Age determines whether the person is a ‘child’ and therefore eligible to enjoy the rights afforded under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and national laws concerning children. 
* Age can make a difference for the referral of the person to shelters and support services, not only for differentiating between accommodation for adults and children but also because younger children and adolescents may fall under the responsibility of different authorities. 
* Age is a factor in the appointment of a guardian, the child's right to access work and legal employment, and establishing criminal responsibility. 
* Age affects the child's [[right to be heard]], including in legal and administrative proceedings, to act as party to proceedings, to appeal decisions independently and to have access to legal assistance and representation. 
* Age matters when children have been granted a temporary protection status (‘[[leave to remain]]’) until they turn 18 years old.

From a human rights perspective, continuity of care and supporting the young person's development into adulthood may have priority than the age determination in some cases, including when the child is returned to a country of origin.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR Guidelines on Unaccompanied and Separated Children Seeking Asylum, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF, Age Assessment: A technical note. UNHCR Guidelines on International Child Protection: Child asylum claims, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Separated Children in Europe Programme: Statement on Good Practice and Position Paper on Age Assessment in the Context of Separated Children in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EU 2011 Anti-trafficking Directive, Article 13.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EU Asylum Procedures Directive, Article 25.5. CRC General Comment No 6, par. 31(i). UNICEF and UNHCR Safe and Sound, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF Guidelines on the Protection of Child Victims of Trafficking, par. 3.1.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Asylum Support Office, Age Assessment Practice in Europe, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methods====

Common methods for assessing age include medical and physical examinations and social observations. A purely physical examination may be unreliable. [[X-rays]] of the person's wrist or other physical examinations are criticised for being invasive of the person's privacy and physical inviolability. They are also known to be inaccurate, arbitrary or imprecise and have a significant margin of error. Poor living conditions, nutrition and hygiene can lead to stunted growth and development of children coming from contexts characterised by poverty.  Cultural matters, environmental and living conditions as well as the individual physical, psychological and cognitive development can have a strong impact on the way a young person is perceived. In some cultures, children under 18 are considered adults as soon as they perform an [[initiation rite]], regardless of their biological age, and their behaviour may appear very mature.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR Guidelines on Unaccompanied and Separated Children Seeking Asylum, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF, Age Assessment: A technical note. UNHCR Guidelines on International Child Protection: Child asylum claims, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Separated Children in Europe Programme: Statement on Good Practice and Position Paper on Age Assessment in the Context of Separated Children in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EU 2011 Anti-trafficking Directive, Article 13.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EU Asylum Procedures Directive, Article 25.5. CRC General Comment No 6, par. 31(i). UNICEF and UNHCR Safe and Sound, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF Guidelines on the Protection of Child Victims of Trafficking, par. 3.1.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Asylum Support Office, Age Assessment Practice in Europe, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

International guidelines recommend that, in cases of doubt, the person shall be assumed to be under 18 years old, be referred to child protection services and shall have an appointed guardian. When an age assessment is necessary, the assessment shall be multi-disciplinary and take the child's origin and background into account while not compromising the physical integrity of the person and respect for her or his dignity.  Multi-disciplinary means that one authority, ideally the social services, take the lead in the assessment and engage all other relevant agencies involved with the case in order to achieve a holistic approach while avoiding unnecessary repetition of interviews with the child or examinations by different agencies. Age assessment procedures shall involve a hearing of the person and be conducted in a child- and gender-sensitive way, with the informed consent of the person. The person should be assisted by a guardian or another competent support person, and be informed about the procedure and the implications of its outcomes. The person should be have the possibility and access to support to appeal the results. The margin of error should be applied giving the benefit of the doubt in the individual's favour.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR Guidelines on Unaccompanied and Separated Children Seeking Asylum, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF, Age Assessment: A technical note. UNHCR Guidelines on International Child Protection: Child asylum claims, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Separated Children in Europe Programme: Statement on Good Practice and Position Paper on Age Assessment in the Context of Separated Children in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EU 2011 Anti-trafficking Directive, Article 13.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EU Asylum Procedures Directive, Article 25.5. CRC General Comment No 6, par. 31(i). UNICEF and UNHCR Safe and Sound, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF Guidelines on the Protection of Child Victims of Trafficking, par. 3.1.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Asylum Support Office, Age Assessment Practice in Europe, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessing risk factors, resiliency and sources of support===
Caseworkers and officers are better able to protect children when they have a good understanding of the risks the child faces. Risk assessments are conducted at different moments in the reception and care of a child and are part of social inquiries and best interests’ determinations. Assessed risks are factors in transnational child protection cases:
* in decisions about the child's referral, placement and arrangements for care and security; 
* in the identification of a durable solution; 
* in relation to criminal investigations and proceedings, when the child is known or presumed to be a victim of trafficking or other crime and when the child acts as witness; 
* when the child has been involved in illegal or criminal activities and there are reasons to assume that the child has been exploited or abused in this context; 
* when the child is transferred to another country under the Dublin III Council Regulation; and 
* when the possibility and conditions for a child to return are being assessed.

Risk assessments analyse individual, family and structural or institutional factors that could cause or increase the risks of a child. These assessments are an opportunity to assess and understand the resiliency of the child and the family and to identify the support available from the family or community, from social support networks and service providers. Mapping sources of risk and resiliency for the child and the family is a precursor to preparing a safety and the identification and implementation of a durable solution. Risk assessments give very concrete hints about what kind of support is needed to build resiliency, to strengthen the protective resources and capacities of the child, the family and the social context.

A risk assessment takes into account: 
* Age- and gender-specific risks,
* The child's awareness and understanding of risks, 
* The knowledge about rights, entitlements and sources of support and the access and use of these,
* Previous experiences of violence, exploitation and abuse,
* Any emotional or behavioural problems, and
* The educational background of the child and caregivers.

A number of factors can affect the risk assessment:
* Family relations and the socio-economic situation of the family and their social inclusion or exclusion in the community, including access to and use of social support networks and family support services.
* Awareness within the family of childcare and protection, parenting skills and the prevalence of domestic or gender-based violence. 
* The capacity of local service providers to support the child and the family effectively through services for protection, rehabilitation and the prevention of further harm. 
* Socio-political dynamics, such gender-based and other discrimination, inequalities or exclusion of certain population groups or minorities. 
* The level of tolerance of violence, including specifically violence against women and children. 
* Risk assessments that are multi-disciplinary in nature, involving the child and the family, the authorities and key professions in the country of destination and origin give the most accurate picture.

==Protective measures==

===Guardians and representatives for non-national children ===
[[Unaccompanied minor|Unaccompanied or separated minors]] are appointed guardians who represent and promote the best interests of the child and support the child when in contact with the authorities and service providers. Caseworkers, officers and service providers involve the guardian in the care planning and decision making processes, in hearings concerning immigration matters and appeal, and all other matters relevant for the child's case. In order to enable the effective communication with the child, guardians may need access to quality interpretation. The guardian or representative does not usually give legal advice. Children who are involved in administrative or judicial proceedings, including asylum proceedings, are provided a lawyer and legal assistance separately. When a child is moved from one accommodation to a different shelter, reception centre or foster family, continuity of guardianship ensures stability for the child. When a child is returned to a country of origin or nationality, caseworkers and officers ensure continuity of guardianship to enable the cooperation between guardians in countries of destination and return and the hand-over of guardianship responsibilities across borders.&lt;ref&gt;Fonseca, Ana, Anna Hardy and Christine Hardy, Unaccompanied migrant children and legal guardianship in the context of returns: The missing links between host countries and countries of origin, International Organisation of Migration, Children on the Move, 2013, pp. 45-61, p. 47, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No.6 (2005), par. 33, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Family tracing and re-establishing family links ====
Family tracing is the first step towards re-establishing the contact between an unaccompanied child and her or his family of origin. It is necessary to assess the child's family situation.

Family tracing can be initiated upon the request of the child or on the initiative of the authorities. Informed consent of the child and the child's views about family tracing should be heard prior to initiating the process. If the child is against family tracing, the dialogue with the child should be sought to understand the child's position. Family tracing shall only be conducted when it is considered to be in the best interests of the child. This means that tracing and restoring the family ties is expected not to cause the child or the family any harm or other adverse effects.&lt;ref&gt;Fonseca, Ana, Anna Hardy and Christine Hardy, Unaccompanied migrant children and legal guardianship in the context of returns: The missing links between host countries and countries of origin, International Organisation of Migration, Children on the Move, 2013, pp. 45-61, p. 47, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No.6 (2005), par. 33, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Family tracing can take place in the child's country of origin or another country to where the family has [[Human migration|migrated]], within the European Union or in third countries, according to the family situation and their history of migration or displacement. Caseworkers and officers can request the assistance of international organisations for family tracing, for instance the national branch of the [[International Social Service]] or the [[Red Cross]].

When unaccompanied children from third countries seek asylum in a Member State of the European Union, the [[List of international and European law on child protection and migration#Reception Conditions Directive|EU Reception Conditions Directive]] says family tracing shall start as soon as possible after an application for international protection is made whilst protecting the best interests’ of the child. In cases where there may be a threat to the life or integrity of the child or her or his close relatives, family tracing must be undertaken on a confidential basis, in order to avoid jeopardising the safety of the child or the family members. This applies when the child's asylum application is being processed or in a third country.

For children who migrate within the EU and who have lost contact with their families, the authorities in the country of destination might initiate a family tracing before returning the child to her or his country of origin as part of a best interests’ determination. These assessments are usually done in cooperation with the authorities in the country where the family lives. The authorities in the country of destination can however also decide to return the child to the country of origin without conducting family tracing when the country is considered safe. This is a common practice within the European Union as all Member States are considered safe and national child protection authorities are considered competent and qualified to trace a family, to assess the best interests of the child with regard to family reunification and to provide quality alternative care if necessary. An individual assessment for each child is required in order to ensure that return without prior family tracing is in the best interests of the child and to exclude any risks to the child in the country of origin.&lt;ref&gt;List_of_international_and_European_law_on_child_protection_and_migration#European_Union&lt;/ref&gt;

For child victims of trafficking who have been officially recognised as such in a country of destination, family tracing is conducted in order to explore the possibility of returning the child to the family of origin, and to assess any possible risks as well as sources of protection in the family environment.

====Maintaining family relations and contact====
Children who are unaccompanied or separated from their family have a right to remain in contact and to maintain family relations, wherever this is not contrary to the best interests of the child.&lt;ref&gt;Convention on the Rights of the Child Article 9.3&lt;/ref&gt;

When legal regulations on family contact for unaccompanied children are not in place, the support of care staff, guardians and other relevant professionals is essential to ensure that unaccompanied children maintain relations and contact with their home countries, communities and families, wherever this is in their best interests and in accordance with confidentiality standards during the asylum procedure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childcentre.info/public/PROTECT/Guidelines_-_promoting_the_Human_Rights_and_the_Best_Interest_of_the_Child_in_Transnational_Child_Protection_Cases.pdf CBSS Guidelines Promoting the Human Rights and the Best Interests of the Child in Transnational Child Protection Cases] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310013229/http://www.childcentre.info/public/PROTECT/Guidelines_-_promoting_the_Human_Rights_and_the_Best_Interest_of_the_Child_in_Transnational_Child_Protection_Cases.pdf |date=2016-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Durable solutions==
A durable solution is identified on the basis of a best interests’ determination and it is therefore different for each individual unaccompanied or separated child, including refugees and asylum seekers, and children who are victims of trafficking. Its longer-term objectives ensure the child's safety, well-being and development. It leads to family reunification or alternative care arrangements according to the best interests of the child.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No.6 (2005), par. 20, 86., par. 79. United Nations Children’s Fund, Guidelines on the Protection of Child Victims of Trafficking, September 2006, p. 3.  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR Guidelines on Determining the Best Interests of the Child, 2008, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The identification and implementation of a durable solution involves different agencies and the child's guardian. The child is at the centre of the process and her or his views have to be heard and taken into due consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Separated Children in Europe Programme, Statement of Good Practice, 4th Revised Edition, Save the Children, UNHCR, UNICEF, 2009, p. 15, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the best interests’ determination process concludes that a child has no grounds for international protection and that transfer to a third country is not an option, the possibility of returning the child to the country of origin will be assessed. In these situations, a comprehensive assessment looks for updated information on the following matters: 
* The safety and security situation in the place of return; 
* The conditions awaiting the child upon return, including socio-economic conditions;
* The availability and appropriateness of care arrangements for the child according to her or his individual needs;
* The continuity in a child's upbringing, care arrangements and development; 
* The views of the child and the caretaker(s) regarding return; 
* The child's level of integration in the country of destination;
* The duration of absence from the country of origin and the quality of the child's relations and contact with the home country;

* The child's ethnic, religious, cultural and linguistic background.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No.6 (2005), par. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

When these assessments conclude that return is indeed in the best interests of the child, return will be ordered and the preparations for return will set in. In any other case, where there are doubts that return corresponds to the best interests of the child or where the assessments do not lead to satisfactory outcomes, the option of return must be reconsidered.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No.6 (2005), par. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Separated Children in Europe Programme, Statement of Good Practice, 4th Revised Edition, Save the Children, UNHCR, UNICEF, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund, Guidelines on the Protection of Child Victims of Trafficking, UNICEF Technical Notes, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No.6 (2005) on the treatment of unaccompanied and separated children outside their country of origin, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swiss Foundation of the International Social Service, Separated Children Handbook, From identification to the search for a durable solution, A practical guide for professionals, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, United Nations Children’s Fund, Safe and Sound, What States can do to ensure respect for the best interests of unaccompanied and separated children in Europe, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR Guidelines on Formal Determination of the Best Interests of the Child, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===For unaccompanied children===
A durable solution for an [[Unaccompanied minor|unaccompanied or separated child]] is understood as “a sustainable solution that ensures that the unaccompanied or separated child is able to develop into adulthood, in an environment which will meet his or her needs and fulfil his or her rights as defined by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and will not put the child at risk of persecution or serious harm. Because the durable solution will have fundamental long-term consequences for the unaccompanied or separated child, it will be subject to a best interests’ determination. A durable solution also ultimately allows the child to acquire, or to re-acquire, the full protection of a state.”&lt;ref&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, United Nations Children’s Fund, Safe and Sound, What States can do to ensure respect for the best interests of unaccompanied and separated children in Europe, 2014, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term durable solution comprises three options:
* The [[voluntary return|return]] and reintegration in the country of origin; 
* The granting of international protection or other legal residence status allowing children to integrate in the country of destination; or 
* [[third country resettlement|Resettlement]] to a third country.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, Action Plan on Unaccompanied Minors (2010-2014), COM(2010)213 final, Brussels, 6 May 2010, p. 12. Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No.6 (2005), par. 79-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life projects==
In 2007, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a recommendation on ‘life projects’ for unaccompanied children. The recommendation aims to promote the identification of “... lasting solutions for and with unaccompanied migrant minors that will help them to build life projects guaranteeing them a better future”.

A ‘life project’ is an individual care planning and case management tool. It helps [[Unaccompanied minor|unaccompanied children]] and the competent state authorities to collaborate in a transparent and respectful way. The objective is to jointly confront the challenges that result from the child's migration and to plan and implement a sustainable solution for the child.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, Committee of Ministers, Recommendation CM/Rec(2007)9 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on life projects for unaccompanied migrant minors, 2007, Appendix, par. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Life project planning starts as early as possible and proceeds in parallel to the best interests’ determination process. Life project planning supports the identification and implementation of a durable solution, without interfering with the decision about where the durable solution is implemented.  Life projects do not anticipate any decision about the child's stay in the destination country, return or resettlement. The responsibility for developing life projects rests primarily with the authorities of the destination country, while the implementation might involve the countries of origin or other states. Life projects help children and young people transition into adulthood and an independent life. Strengthening the transnational cooperation between the relevant authorities is a key aspect for the development and implementation of life projects.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, Committee of Ministers, Recommendation CM/Rec(2007)9 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on life projects for unaccompanied migrant minors, 2007, Appendix, par. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missing children==
In countries of destination, many children leave care arrangements without informing the authorities of their whereabouts. When children go missing, they risk being exposed to harmful and destitute living conditions, exploitation and abuse.&lt;ref&gt;European Migration Network, Policies, Practices and Data on Unaccompanied Minors in the EU Member States and Norway, Synthesis Report: 2015, pp. 28-32.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Some children who ‘go missing’ move on to other countries. Children may refuse to lodge an asylum application. Some children do not wait for the decision on their application before leaving reception centres and others leave when their applications have been rejected. Some might continue their journeys in order to reach their final destinations, to join family members or other contacts abroad. Others might be trafficked and follow the routes determined by their traffickers or exploiters. Effective national responses and transnational cooperation are important to locate these children and to ensure their safety.&lt;ref&gt;European Migration Network, Policies, Practices and Data on Unaccompanied Minors in the EU Member States and Norway, Synthesis Report: 2015, pp. 28-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Care staff, guardians and service providers prevent children from going missing by establishing a trust-based relationship and communication with the child and supporting children in integrating socially into the community of destination. This includes demonstrating that the child's views, needs and aspirations are being heard and taken into account in a meaningful way at all stages of their reception, referral and care and in the best interests’ determination. Social contacts and support networks may help to prevent a child from going missing. When children have mobile phones and e-mail accounts and share their contact details with care staff or trusted persons, remaining in contact can be a way for reconnecting children to services once they have left. Previous identification and registration, including of photographs, is critical to look for children once they have left. National protocols for missing persons can guide the cooperation of different authorities in preventing and tracing missing children and should ideally be extended across borders.&lt;ref&gt;European Migration Network, Policies, Practices and Data on Unaccompanied Minors in the EU Member States and Norway, Synthesis Report: 2015, pp. 28-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

When an [[Unaccompanied minor|unaccompanied child]] goes missing, police investigate the case in the same way as cases of national children missing. This is required under the obligations of the state to ensure the safety and well-being of any child within its jurisdiction, as afforded under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, in particular the principle of [[Child migration#Right to non-discrimination|non-discrimination]] under Article 2. The child's guardian, social services and care staff and the child's lawyer, where applicable, should be informed about the progress of the investigations. Guardianship arrangements do not cease when a child is missing.&lt;ref&gt;European Migration Network, Policies, Practices and Data on Unaccompanied Minors in the EU Member States and Norway, Synthesis Report: 2015, pp. 28-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further information and technical assistance==
Many transnational child protection cases are complex and difficult to assess, especially when criminal acts are involved, such as exploitation and trafficking, and when the child's identity, relations and aspirations are not entirely clear. Specialised expertise is key, including expertise in child protection, social affairs, family mediation, criminal law and security matters, migration issues, interpretation and cultural mediation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childcentre.info/public/PROTECT/Guidelines_-_promoting_the_Human_Rights_and_the_Best_Interest_of_the_Child_in_Transnational_Child_Protection_Cases.pdf CBSS Guidelines Promoting the Human Rights and the Best Interests of the Child in Transnational Child Protection Cases] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310013229/http://www.childcentre.info/public/PROTECT/Guidelines_-_promoting_the_Human_Rights_and_the_Best_Interest_of_the_Child_in_Transnational_Child_Protection_Cases.pdf |date=2016-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialised knowledge and experience with unusual and complex cases may however not be available in each municipality, especially in small towns and in rural areas. For officials and professionals working with and for children should know whom to contact in order to seek information, technical assistance and specialised expertise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childcentre.info/public/PROTECT/Guidelines_-_promoting_the_Human_Rights_and_the_Best_Interest_of_the_Child_in_Transnational_Child_Protection_Cases.pdf CBSS Guidelines Promoting the Human Rights and the Best Interests of the Child in Transnational Child Protection Cases] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310013229/http://www.childcentre.info/public/PROTECT/Guidelines_-_promoting_the_Human_Rights_and_the_Best_Interest_of_the_Child_in_Transnational_Child_Protection_Cases.pdf |date=2016-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are some key contact points to approach:
* National institutes, commissions or Ombuds Offices for human rights or specifically for children's rights
* Central authorities for child protection, which are in place for different themes and are usually connected to the Hague Conventions on child protection and international family law and to the [[Brussels II bis|Brussels II bis Regulation]]  
* The national migration authorities  
* National Rapporteurs or observatories on human trafficking 
* The national branches of the [[International Social Service]] in the countries involved in the case
* NGOs and child rights advocates focusing on matters concerning children on the move and/or child victims of crime
* National institutions supporting victims of crime 
* National or regional offices of [[UNICEF]], the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) or the [[International Organization for Migration]] (IOM).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childcentre.info/public/PROTECT/Guidelines_-_promoting_the_Human_Rights_and_the_Best_Interest_of_the_Child_in_Transnational_Child_Protection_Cases.pdf CBSS Guidelines Promoting the Human Rights and the Best Interests of the Child in Transnational Child Protection Cases] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310013229/http://www.childcentre.info/public/PROTECT/Guidelines_-_promoting_the_Human_Rights_and_the_Best_Interest_of_the_Child_in_Transnational_Child_Protection_Cases.pdf |date=2016-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transurethral microwave thermotherapy''' is one of a number of effective and safe&lt;ref&gt;Stravodimos KG, Goldfischer ER, Klima WJ, Jabbour ME, Smith AD. 1998 Jun. Transurethral microwave thermotherapy for management of benign prostatic hyperplasia: a single-institution experience. | {{PMID|9609641}}&lt;/ref&gt; procedures used in the treatment of [[lower urinary tract symptoms]] caused by [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]]. '''Transurethral microwave thermotherapy''' provides a one-time efficacious treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hypertrophy. It is an alternative treatment to pharmacotherapy such as [[alpha blocker]]s, [[transurethral resection of the prostate]], [[transurethral needle ablation of the prostate]], photoselective vaporization of the prostate and prostatic removal or [[prostatectomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Rubenstein, MD | Transurethral Microwave Thermotherapy of the Prostate (TUMT) http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3070.htm | Feb 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Transurethral microwave thermotherapy is a non-surgical, minimally invasive therapy that can be performed under a local anesthetic on an outpatient basis. The treatment involves  inserting a special microwave urinary catheter into the hyperplastic prostatic urethra. The microwave antenna within the catheter then emits microwaves to heat and destroy the surrounding prostatic tissue.

The procedure can take from 30 minutes to one hour and is well tolerated by patients. Following the procedure, the prostatic tissue will be swollen and irritated. Urologists often place a [[Foley catheter]] to prevent the patient from having urinary retention. After three to five days the Foley catheter can be replaced by a temporary prostatic stent  to improve voiding without exacerbating irritation symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Dineen MK, Shore ND, Lumerman JH, Saslawsky MJ, Corica AP (2008 March 26). Use of a Temporary Prostatic Stent After Transurethral Microwave Thermotherapy Reduced Voiding Symptoms and Bother Without Exacerbating Irritative Symptoms. {{PMID|18374395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
The main risks of transurethral microwave thermotherapy include:

* Urinary retention
* Infection
* Postprocedural pain
* [[Retrograde ejaculation]]
* Intense pain during the procedure
* Urination pain for several weeks

Evidence is turning in favour of transurethral microwave thermotherapy over [[transurethral resection of the prostate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rowland Illing |title=Surgical and Minimally Invasive Interventions for LUTS/BPH: Highlights from 2006 |volume=6 |issue=12 |pages=701–709 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.eursup.2007.04.003 |journal=European Urology Supplements}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftercare==
The [[International Prostate Symptom Score]] including a [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]] survey, is often used to quantify symptoms and to monitor the response to the treatment. Convalescence is relatively rapid, with most patients able to void and a mean recovery time of less than 5 days at home.

However, prostatic [[edema]] is expected after microwave therapy, and this can lead to a risk of urinary retention. While some protocols suggest leaving a Foley catheter in for up to 2 weeks in all patients, other urologists are choosing to place a temporary [[prostatic stent]] after the first week following treatment. The stent is worn for 30 days and allows the patient to have volitional voiding with improved quality of life compared to a Foley catheter. Urinary flow generally improves over a few months.

Patients maintained on alpha-blockers after transurethral microwave thermotherapy may experience fewer urinary symptoms and have a decreased incidence of retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Neal D. Shore |author2=Martin K. Dineenb‡ |author3=Mark J. Saslawskyc |author4=Jeffrey H. Lumermand |author5=Alberto P.

The '''United Nations Association of South Africa University of Cape Town (UNASA UCT)''' is an official chapter of the [[United Nations Association]] of South Africa (UNASA) and affiliated to the [[World Federation of United Nations Associations]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unasa.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=21&lt;/ref&gt;. UNASA UCT is a registered political society at the [[University of Cape Town]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uct.ac.za/students/recreation/societies/&lt;/ref&gt;. The aim of the society is to work in collaboration with various stakeholders in South Africa to promote and support the goals, vision and principles of the UN and its agencies.

== History ==

UNASA UCT was founded in 2007 at the University of Cape Town (UCT) as a society and a flagship chapter of the organisation. Membership has grown steadily over the years and, in 2011, the society had over 250 members {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}. In February 2012, UNASA UCT recruited over 500 members making it one of the largest student societies on campus where it remains one of the most active.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}. 

== Vision ==

UNASA UCT is part of a greater movement that works to breach the gap between the UN and the people of the world. It aims to provide a platform for University of Cape Town students to contribute to the achievement of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] of the United Nations. It also seeks to create awareness and facilitate discourse about current and international affairs that shape the future of South Africa. The organization, aiming to inspire a culture of [[Global citizenship]], wishes to use the university space to unite students from across the globe to exchange ideas, perceptions and experiences. 

Furthermore, UNASA UCT strongly desires to be proactive in national and international spheres by campaigning for greater youth involvement in the work of the UN.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unasa.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual events and campaigns==
[[File:SchoolMUN CapeTown.jpg|thumb|School MUN 2011 conference in progress at Provincial Parliament in [[Cape Town]]]]

=== UCT Model United Nations (MUN) ===

UNASA UCT annually hosts its university-level [[Model United Nations]] (MUN) conference attracting delegates from all other major UNASA university chapters in the country. Model UN simulations are used as a tool to educate participants about international relations and the 2030 Agenda, while also promoting skills in diplomacy, research, public speaking and debate.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/gmun&lt;/ref&gt; The UCT chapter has successfully hosted its MUN conference each year seeing year-on-year growth in both size and participation. 

The society's best delegates also have the opportunity to participate in the South African Universities Model UN conference hosted at the University of Pretoria by its sibling chapter UNASA UP.

In 2011, an inaugural School Model United Nations was launched by UNASA UCT which brought together 20 high schools in the Cape Town area, exposing pupils to the world of Model UN. This event was hosted at the [[Western Cape Provincial Parliament]] in Cape Town.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uct.ac.za/dailynews/archives/?id=7908#unschools&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the South African School's Model UN (SASMUN) program has become an annual initiative organised by UNASA National with the support of its chapters in the Western Cape. UNASA UCT also offers its members the opportunity to volunteer as tutors to assist high school teams in preparing for the SASMUN conference.


=== WIMUN ===

In 2017 UNASA UCT sent its very first delegation to the 3rd WFUNA International Model UN (WIMUN) conference hosted at the UN Headquarters in New York. The delegation of 10 UCT students went on to receive the Outstanding Delegation Award in the Africa Group. 


[[File:BlueWeek marchingband.jpg|thumb|A marching band performs at the University of Cape Town during Blue Week]]

=== Blue Week ===

UNASA UCT hosted its inaugural Blue Week at the University of Cape Town in 2011- a week dedicated to promoting the MDGs and creating awareness to the student body about existing social issues. Blue Week is now an annual event. It exposes UCT students to current issues and discourse that affect the wider community in terms of race, [[human rights]] and poverty.

The campaigns and events run during Blue Week include the E-RACE IT campaign, primary Blue Week theme to create awareness on existing racism and issues surrounding [[racial discrimination]] ; End Poverty Now Campaign, aimed to establish consciousness of ongoing poverty and encourage students to contribute to eradication of poverty; MDGs education day, one day in Blue Week dedicated to creating awareness about the MDGs amongst students; and a Human Rights seminar, a thought provoking discussion of the current trends in human rights.

=== Other annual events ===

UNASA UCT also organizes other events during the year including a pub quiz, tree planting days, UN career talks and movie screenings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15895">'''Unlicensed assistive personnel''' ('''UAP''') is a class of [[paraprofessional]]s who assist individuals with [[physical disabilities]], mental impairments, and other [[health care]] needs with their [[activities of daily living]] (ADLs). UAPs also provide bedside care—including basic nursing procedures—all under the supervision of a [[registered nurse]], [[licensed practical nurse]] or other [[health care provider|health care professional]]. UAPs must demonstrate their abilities and competencies before gaining any expanded responsibilities within the clinical setting. While providing this care, UAP's offer compassion and patience and are part of the patient's healthcare support system. Communication is key between UAP's and Registered Nurses (RN) as they are working together in best interest of the patient.

They provide care for [[patient]]s in [[hospital]]s, residents of [[nursing home|nursing facilities]], clients in private homes, and others in need of their services due to effects of [[old age]] or [[disability]]. UAPs, by definition, do not hold a license or other [[healthcare provider requisites|mandatory professional requirements]] for practice, though many hold various certifications. They are collectively categorized under the group "personal care workers in health services" in the [[International Standard Classification of Occupations|International Standard Classification]] [[International Standard Classification of Occupations|of Occupations]], 2008 revision.

Nursing assistant, nursing auxiliary, [[auxiliary nurse]], patient care technician, home health aide/assistant, geriatric aide/assistant, psychiatric aide, nurse aide, or nurse tech are all common titles that are considered to be UAPs in many countries.

In the United States, certified nursing assistants (CNAs) typically work in a nursing home or hospital and perform everyday living tasks for the elderly, chronically sick, or rehabilitation patients who cannot care for themselves. There are some differences in scope of care across UAPs based on title and description. CNAs must become certified based on respective states' requirements. Not all states' requirements are the same. Below is a list of general requirements:&lt;ref&gt;Certified Nursing Exam Board [http://cnaexamcram.com/requirements-to-become-a-cna/ "Requirements to Become a CNA".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316123448/http://cnaexamcram.com/requirements-to-become-a-cna/ |date=2014-03-16 }} Accessed 16 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Pass an accredited course
* Pass that state’s respective CNA exam
* Pass a practical exam that will assess the ability to perform basic CNA activities
* Obtain a certain amount of on-duty experience while under supervision
* Register within the state in which the exams were performed

Once the above requirements are completed, the person will then be certified for that respective state. Moving to a different state, however, would require recertification in the new state, unless both states use the NNAAP standard.&lt;ref&gt;National Council of State Boards of Nursing. [https://www.ncsbn.org/1721.htm "NNAAP Testing Standard".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210200936/https://www.ncsbn.org/1721.htm |date=2014-02-10 }} Accessed 16 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the new state would accept previous NNAAP test scores and allow registration. These certification exams are distributed by the state. Classes to study for these exams are provided by the [[American Red Cross]] as well as other providers. The courses offered by the American Red Cross encompass all facets that are addressed in the state exams from communication to health terms to sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;National Certified Nurse Assistant Resource [http://www.cnaclasses.net/ "CNA Resource".] Accessed 11 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar titles in the [[United Kingdom]] and elsewhere include healthcare assistant, healthcare support worker, or clinical support worker. These providers usually work in hospitals or community settings under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional.&lt;ref name="NHS"&gt;National Health Service. [http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/Default.aspx?Id=485 ''NHS Careers in Detail: Healthcare assistants/auxiliary nurses''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405092519/http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/Default.aspx?Id=485 |date=2011-04-05 }} Accessed 12 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A home health aide (HHA) provides in-home care for patients who need assistance with daily living beyond what family or friends are capable of providing. Patients include those who have a physical or mental disability, are recovering from an injury or surgery, have a chronic illness, or are advanced in age. Training requirements to become an HHA are generally minimal and vary depending on the state. HHA training is available from various outlets such as:&lt;ref&gt;Home Health Aide training [http://howtobecomeahomehealthaide.com/hha-training/ "How to Get Home Health Aide Training".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025195659/http://www.howtobecomeahomehealthaide.com/hha-training/ |date=2014-10-25 }} Accessed 16 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Home health care agencies
*Community colleges
*Vocational schools
*Eldercare programs
*On-the-job training

Personal support worker (PSW) is the title for a similar type of health worker in the Province of Ontario in [[Canada]]. Some of the responsibilities and duties of a personal support worker include, but are not limited to:&lt;ref&gt;Personal Support Worker Canada. [http://www.personalsupportworker.ca/psw_information.html ''PSW Personal Support Worker Information''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706200307/http://www.personalsupportworker.ca/psw_information.html |date=2011-07-06 }} Accessed 12 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Observing, documenting and reporting clinical and treatment information, including patients' behavioral changes
* Assisting with motion exercises and other [[physiotherapy|rehabilitative measures]]
* Taking and recording [[blood pressure]], [[normal human body temperature|temperature]], [[pulse]], [[respiratory system|respiration]], and body weight
* Assisting with [[ambulating|ambulation]] and mobilization of patients
* Collecting specimens for required medical tests
* Providing emotional and support services to patients, their families and other [[caregiver]]s
* Assisting with [[personal hygiene]]
* Assisting with meal preparation, grocery shopping, dietary planning, and food and fluid intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HHA Job Description|url=http://commhealthcare.com/home-care-services/home-health-aides-hha/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208140126/http://commhealthcare.com/home-care-services/home-health-aides-hha/|archivedate=2016-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Personal support work is unique among health care professions in that the scope of the PSW's duties does not extend beyond what the client could do him/herself, if the client were physically and cognitively able. No other profession's scope is similarly described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psno.ca/about-psws.html|title=About PSWs|work=Personal Support Network of Ontario|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924202733/http://www.psno.ca/about-psws.html|archivedate=2014-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Surgical technologist]]s are considered UAPs in the US, where they are also sometimes called "scrub tech". However this title can mean different things in different countries. For example, in [[Mozambique]], surgical technologists are medical professionals trained and registered to perform advanced clinical procedures including emergency surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Cumbi A et al. "Major surgery delegation to mid-level health practitioners in Mozambique: health professionals' perceptions." ''Human Resources for Health''; 2007, 5:27 {{DOI|10.1186/1478-4491-5-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Birth attendant|Birth assistants]], such as [[doula]]s, childbirth educators and other persons providing emotional support and general care and advice to women and families during pregnancy and [[childbirth]], are also typically considered UAPs. They are distinguished from midwives, physicians, nurses, and other professionals who are trained and licensed to provide basic and emergency pregnancy and childbirth-related health care services and manage complications.

== Training and practice ==
{{See also|Activities of daily living assistance}}
Unlicensed assistive personnel are important members of the health care team who often hold a high level of experience and ability. While they do not require extensive health care training to practice their profession, a high level of manual dexterity and good interpersonal communication skills are usually necessary. They often undergo some formal education, apprenticeship or on-the-job training in areas such as body mechanics, [[nutrition]], anatomy and physiology, cognitive impairments and mental health issues, [[infection control]], personal care skills, and records-keeping.&lt;ref name="NHS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO2010"&gt;World Health Organization. ''Classifying health workers: mapping occupations to the international standard classification''. Geneva, WHO, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BLS1"&gt;U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. [http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos165.htm ''Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition – Nursing and Psychiatric Aides''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103065604/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos165.htm |date=2006-11-03 }} Accessed 12 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Association of Career Colleges. [http://www.nacc.ca/w_personal_support_worker.aspx ''Personal Support Worker''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112174848/http://www.nacc.ca/w_personal_support_worker.aspx |date=2011-01-12 }} Accessed 12 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Most community colleges offer CNA training in one semester. However, there are other sources that offer accelerated programs. Many nursing homes will actually pay for their employees to take CNA training on the premise that once completed the student will then work for them.

In the context of aging populations and [[health care reform]], UAPs are in growing demand in many countries.

However, without formal health professional qualifications, UAPs are often unable to perform some tasks due to issues of liability and legality. Attempts to [[healthcare provider requisites|regulate]], control, and verify education have been made in some places. This allows an employer to verify experience and knowledge as well as to assist in preventing individuals who have been "struck off" (had registration/certification invalidated) from continuing to work in healthcare roles. For example, in the UK, the credibility of the Healthcare Assistant and other [[social care]] workers is intended to be strengthened by their compulsory registration from 2009 with the [[General Social Care Council]] in England or its Scottish or Welsh equivalents.

In the United States, families and employers can verify a UAPs certification in accordance with state and local laws by checking with a Family Care Safety Registry (FCSR). A Family Care Safety Registry was established by law to promote family and community safety. The registry helps to protect children, seniors, and the disabled by providing background information on that individual. Families and employers can call the registry's toll-free line by phone, fax or E-mail to request background information on registered child care, elder care, and personal care workers or to request licensure status information on licensed child care and elder care providers at no-cost to the requestor.

In Ontario, Canada in May 2011, the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC) announced the creation of a Registry of Personal Support Workers to acknowledge the care they provide daily to some of Ontario's most vulnerable populations, including seniors and people with chronic illnesses and disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pswregistry.org/Web%20Documents/junk/MOHLTCv20110519.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320232214/http://pswregistry.org/Web%20Documents/junk/MOHLTCv20110519.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 1, 2012, the Ontario PSW Registry was officially launched and now has over 23,000 registered PSWs and counting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pswregistry.org/Pages/en/AboutUs.aspx|title=About the Ontario PSW Registry|work=pswregistry.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320215213/http://pswregistry.org/Pages/en/AboutUs.aspx|archivedate=2014-03-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[European Care Certificate|Care Certificate]] was introduced in April 2015, following the [[Camilla Cavendish|Cavendish Review of April 2013]] into standards of care among health care assistants and support workers in the NHS and social care settings.&lt;ref name="cqc.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cqc.org.uk/content/cqc-welcomes-launch-care-certificate-april|title=CQC welcomes launch of the Care Certificate from April|work=cqc.org.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003173312/http://www.cqc.org.uk/content/cqc-welcomes-launch-care-certificate-april|archivedate=2015-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced to address inconsistencies in training and competencies in the workforce so that all staff have the same introductory skills, knowledge and behaviours to provide safe, high quality and compassionate care of the highest standards.&lt;ref name="cqc.org.uk" /&gt; The Care Certificate was jointly developed by Skills for Health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/|title=Skills for Health - Home|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003174404/http://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/|archivedate=2015-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health Education England&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hee.nhs.uk/|title=Health Education England|author=|date=27 March 2015|website=hee.nhs.uk|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318224805/https://www.hee.nhs.uk/|archivedate=18 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Skills for Care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Standards/Care-Certificate/Care-Certificate.aspx|title=Care Certificate|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003144552/http://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Standards/Care-Certificate/Care-Certificate.aspx|archivedate=2015-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/standards/item/216-the-care-certificate|title=The Care Certificate|work=skillsforhealth.org.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003175226/http://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/standards/item/216-the-care-certificate|archivedate=2015-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Turnover and job stability ==
Typically, the turnover rate among unlicensed assistive personnel within an organization is very high, which can be detrimental to quality of care of patients and also create negative stress and dissatisfaction among the personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen-Mansfield, Jiska. "Turnover among nursing home staff: A review." Nursing management 28.5 (1997): 59-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies exploring the reasons for turnover show that turnover is not simply a matter of higher pay, but can have many factors such as the degree of respect experienced by the unlicensed personnel, scheduling flexibility, commitment and calling to the profession and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Kupperschmidt. B.R. (2002). Unlicensed assistive personnel retention and realistic job previews. ''Nursing Economics, 20'', 279-283.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Virtual Hospital''' is an international [[non-government organization]] that operates as part of Virtual Healthcare Limited. Virtual Hospital uses [[telemedicine]] to deliver medical care to the developing world. Virtual Hospital works directly with doctors and patients and seeks to ensure that the benefits of modern medicine are available to all people and that the poor are not deprived of medical treatment for want of money, or a lack of access to effective healthcare.

==How Virtual Hospital Works==
Virtual Hospital interconnects villages in the developing world with their main county [[hospital]]s and hospitals in the West using [[Telemedicine]]. Virtual Hospital is based on a traditional healthcare referral system where the patients’ medical information is collected by e-clinics in rural [[third world]] communities using a computer, or [[mobile phone]] and sent to a [[general practitioner|general medical practitioner]] (GP) based at the Virtual Hospital (Hub).  The GP at the Hub then either provides a diagnosis, or refers the patient to the relevant Virtual Hospital Department where specialist consultants across the world are linked together through the Internet.

==Influence on Virtual Hospital==
The work of Virtual Hospital is influenced to a great extent by reports published by the [[World Health Organization (WHO)]] on Telemedicine developments,&lt;ref name="TELEMEDICINE in Member States"&gt;{{cite report|last=Kay|first=Misha|author2=Santos, Takane |title=Telemedicine opportunities and developments in Member States|series=Global Observatory for eHealth series|year=2010|volume=2|publisher=[[WHO]]|url=http://www.virtualhospital.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/WHO-Telemedicine-Developments.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Telemedicine Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grady|first=Bryan|title=PRACTICE GUIDELINES FOR VIDEOCONFERENCING-BASED TELEMENTAL HEALTH|journal=Practice guidelines for video conferencing-based telemental Health|date=October 2009|url=http://www.virtualhospital.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Telemedicine-guideline-report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the work of Zaidi et all 2004 and Denis Gilhooly Principal Adviser in the [[United Nations]].

According to WHO’s report on 'Telemedicine - Opportunities and Developments in Member States' : 'Information and communication technologies have great potential to address some of the challenges met both developed and developing countries in providing accessible, cost effective high quality health care services. Telemedicine uses [[Information and communications technology|ICTs]] to overcome geographical barriers and increase access to healthcare services. This is particularly beneficial for rural and underserved communities in developing countries - groups that traditionally suffer form lack of access to healthcare.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Gilhooly|first=Denis|title=Confronting the Diseases of Poverty: Creating a Digital He@lth Dynamic|year=2009|url=http://www.virtualhospital.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Creating-a-Digital-He@lth-Dynamic.pdf|location=Las Vegas, USA|conference=American Telemedicine Association Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''You're Gonna Miss Me''''' is an American [[documentary film]] by Keven McAlester. It focuses on [[Roky Erickson]], the former frontman for the [[rock music|rock]] band [[The 13th Floor Elevators]]. The band is cited as pioneers of the [[psychedelic rock]] genre. The film covers Erickson's rise to fame, his excessive use of [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], struggles with [[schizophrenia]], and his 1969 [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] arrest that led to stays at [[Austin State Hospital]] and Rusk State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Erickson was irrevocably changed after the onset of his illness and he went long stretches with little interest in making or performing music. The film opens with Erickson, who had been living as a total recluse for over a decade. What follows is a closer look at how "the great lost vocalist of rock and roll" came to live in poverty and isolation, struggles to receive effective treatments, and how he manages to return to music and life. The film takes its name from the debut single by The 13th Floor Elevators.

The documentary was nominated for a 2007 [[Independent Spirit Award]] for Best Documentary.
