'''Applied Scholastics''' is a [[non-profit]] corporation founded in 1972 to promote the use of study techniques created by [[L. Ron Hubbard]], the founder of the [[Church of Scientology]].  Hubbard called his theories on learning and education "[[study technology]]." Applied Scholastics runs the "Hollywood Education and Literacy Project" (HELP),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helplearn.org/index-flash.html Hollywood Education and Literacy Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207202503/http://www.helplearn.org/index-flash.html |date=2006-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[World Literacy Crusade]], "Education Alive", and the "Literacy, Education and Abilities Program" (LEAP).

Applied Scholastics' declared mission is: "to promote and develop programs of effective education for educators, business trainers, tutors, parents, children and people in all walks of life who need improved study skills to enhance their scholastic, business and personal activities."

Applied Scholastics is sponsored by the [[Church of Scientology]].&lt;ref name="times2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tighe|first1=Mark|title=Scientologists target schoolchildren|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/ireland/scientologists-target-schoolchildren-m0sv2xgk3|website=The Times|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studytech.org/asi.php |title=Scientology's Education Fronts - Applied Scholastics International |year=2007 |publisher=''studytech.org'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514032959/http://www.studytech.org/asi.php |archivedate=2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study Tech==
{{Main|Study Tech}}
Study Tech is a teaching methodology developed by [[L. Ron Hubbard]].

Hubbard's theories on education describe three "barriers to learning". The first is the absence of mass, pertaining to the lack of a physical object relating to a concept. The second is a steep study "gradient", meaning a necessary previous step was skipped to master a skill. The third is the "misunderstood word", which necessitates looking up unclear words in the dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Texts highlight scientology's role in education. |journal=Education Week |last=Walsh |first=Mark |issn=0277-4232 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-12-01 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Students are taught that "misunderstood words" are a major cause of confusion and misunderstanding. They are taught to use dictionaries extensively. Emphasis is also put on making sure children are taught at a "gradient", so that a subject's crucial elementary concepts come before more difficult concepts. "Mass" is described as a measure of mental tangibility that students ascribe to a subject, so that students have a picture in their mind of the thing they are learning about.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Applied Scholastics licenses [[Study Tech]] to a number of schools throughout the world. In return, these schools pay 4% of their [[gross income]] to Applied Scholastics.&lt;ref name="License Agreement"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040715154510/http://www.able.org/pages/grp_forms/aps_lic_agr.pdf ABLE license contract for the use of Applied Scholastics trademarks] ([[PDF]] format. Archived March 18, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==
In 1992, [[Applied Materials]] settled a lawsuit for an estimated $600,000. The lawsuit claimed that the three former employees who filed the lawsuit had been driven out of the company because they had complained about the seminars Applied Scholastics had been contracted to teach there. Applied Scholastics said regarding the case, "In ten years of business, we've never had anything come up like this." &lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{Cite news

In 1998, the group submitted five of its books for approval as supplemental classroom texts to the [[California Department of Education]]. The review board found no religious content to object to, although they did object to the lack of portrayals of disabled persons and people of color. The Southern California [[American Civil Liberties Union]], however, objected on the basis that the books used many of the terms and concepts that the Church of Scientology uses elsewhere in its [[Study Tech]].&lt;ref name=Free&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Szalanski|first=Andrea |title= 'Clearing' Johnny to read |journal=[[Free Inquiry]]|volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=12 |id= |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], Applied Scholastics convinced the principal of Prescott Middle School in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] to implement a program of Study Tech.&lt;ref name=door/&gt; Critics worried that the move was "an insidious plan ultimately aimed at promoting Scientology."&lt;ref name=door&gt;{{cite news | first = Robert | last = Farley | title = Scientology makes it in classroom door | url = http://www.sptimes.com/2007/05/20/Worldandnation/Scientology_makes_it_.shtml | publisher = [[St. Petersburg Times]] | date = 2007-05-20 | accessdate = 2008-11-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080919141137/http://www.sptimes.com/2007/05/20/Worldandnation/Scientology_makes_it_.shtml| archivedate= 19 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Prescott's principal and two education experts claimed that they "saw [no] hidden Scientology agenda or proselytizing in the text."&lt;ref name="door" /&gt; The school's principal felt that the program was worthwhile.&lt;ref name="door" /&gt; In October 2005, [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] Public Schools superintendent Creg Williams discovered the group's Scientology connections and immediately advised area principals to cease working with Applied Scholastics. Additionally, CEO Bennetta Slaughter falsely claimed a "partnership" with the Hazelwood School District in St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Kristen | last = Hinman | title = L Is for L.

Some parents were upset when Applied Scholastics methods were introduced in September 2008 at Bambolino [[Montessori method|Montessori]] Academy, a private school in [[Toronto]]. The owner/principal and dean of the school are both Scientologists but they say that Applied Scholastics is secular and that they do not teach Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/09/18/bambolino-school.html|title=Scientology link at Montessori school alarms parents|date=2009-09-18|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=2008-09-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080923044223/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/09/18/bambolino-school.html| archivedate= 23 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a charter{{clarify|date=August 2017}} school group in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] came under criticism for using tools provided by Applied Scholastics.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/2013/03/27/174441623/peter-o-dowd-tk&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5285">The '''Association for Laboratory Phonology''' is a non-profit professional society for researchers interested in the sound structure of language. It was founded to promote the scientific study of all aspects of [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]] of oral and sign languages through scholarly exchange across disciplines and through the use of a hybrid methodology.&lt;ref name="LabPhon1"&gt;Beckman, M. and J. Kingston ''Introduction.'' In J. Kingston and M. Beckman (eds.) ''Papers in Laboratory Phonology I: Between the Grammar and the Physics of Speech''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press: 1–16.&lt;/ref&gt; The founding and honorary members are Amalia Arvaniti, [[Mary Beckman]], Cathi Best, [[Catherine Browman]], [[Jennifer S. Cole]], Mariapaola D'Imperio, [[Louis M. Goldstein]], [[José Ignacio Hualde]], [[Patricia Keating]], John Kingston, D.R. Ladd, [[Peter Ladefoged]], [[Janet Pierrehumbert]], Caroline Smith, Paul Warren and [[Douglas Whalen]]. The Association is an international body open to scholars world-wide, and currently has over 100 members. 

Since the Association's inception, the methodologies of laboratory phonology are emerging as the dominant approach to the study of sound systems in universities in North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and many other locations. In this way, the success of the approach promoted by the Association for Laboratory Phonology can be attributed to its interdisciplinary nature:  bridging [[linguistics]] with [[psychology]], [[computer science]], etc., and defining the relationship between the cognitive and physical aspects of [[human speech]] as a question of [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name="Cohn"&gt;Cohn, Abigail. [http://conf.ling.cornell.edu/cohn/LPhon&amp;Tphonho.pdf ''Phonology: An Appraisal of the Field in 2007''], Presented at the Annual Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America. January 5, 2007. Anaheim, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meetings==
The biennial Conference on Laboratory Phonology (LabPhon) brings together researchers across the many relevant disciplines to present work on the phonological patterns and structures of natural languages. All oral paper sessions are plenary, and are organized to promote discussion across the disciplines. Each session groups together invited and submitted talks on a conference theme and ends with a talk by an invited discussant followed by an open discussion by the entire conference audience. Since the second conference in 1989, there have also been one or more poster sessions, which also are plenary. Conferences generally have between four and six themes, which are broadly defined in order to bring together speakers and commentators from different disciplines and theoretical backgrounds.

==Publications==
The proceedings of the Conference on Laboratory Phonology were published as Papers in Laboratory Phonology by [[Cambridge University Press]] from 1991 (Vol 1) to 2004 (Vol 6).  Beginning with Vol 7, the series was renamed to Laboratory Phonology and published by [[Mouton de Gruyter]]. After the publication of Laboratory Phonology 10 in 2010, the book series was replaced  by the journal Laboratory Phonology. The first six volumes of the journal were published by Mouton de Gruyter, and then starting with volume 7 in 2016, the journal moved to [[Ubiquity Press]], to become an online-only, open-access publication.  
The journal encompasses the scientific study of the elements of oral language, their organization, their grammatical function, and their role in speech communication. Research questions and some of the methods addressed in the publications also extend naturally to the parallel investigation of [[manual communication|manual signs]] as the encoding elements of [[sign languages]].

The '''California Digital Library''' ('''CDL''') was founded by the [[University of California]] in 1997. In collaboration with the ten [[University of California Libraries]] and other partners, CDL has assembled one of the world’s largest digital research libraries.  CDL facilitates the licensing of online materials and develops shared services used throughout the UC system. Building on the foundations of the [[Melvyl]] Catalog (UC’s union catalog), CDL has developed one of the largest online library catalogs in the country and works in partnership with the UC campuses to bring the treasures of California's libraries, museums, and cultural heritage organizations to the world. CDL continues to explore how services such as digital curation, scholarly publishing, archiving and preservation support research throughout the information lifecycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher= [[International Coalition of Library Consortia]] (ICOLC)|title=California Digital Library|url=http://icolc.net/consortia/128|accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The California Digital Library (CDL) is an eleventh library for the University of California (UC). A collaborative effort of the ten campuses, organizationally housed at the University of California Office of the President, it is responsible for the design, creation, and implementation of systems that support the shared collections of the University of California. Several CDL projects focus on collaboration with other California Universities and organizations to create and extend access to digital material to UC partners and to the public at large.

The CDL was created as the result of a three-year planning process, beginning with the Digital Library Executive Working Group commissioned by Library Council and culminating with the Library Planning and Action Initiative commissioned by the Provost, which involved UC faculty, librarians, and administrators.

==Access &amp; Publishing Services==

The Access &amp; Publishing Group, comprising the Publishing and Digital Special Collections (DSC) teams, develops and maintains production services that enable robust access to the unique digital assets of the University of California and beyond. The Publishing team provides the University of California scholarly community with innovative digital publication and distribution opportunities through the development of advanced technologies and creative partnerships. The DSC team supports collaboration between libraries, archives, and museums throughout the State of California to provide access to a world class digital collection that serves an array of end users, from researchers and scholars to students and the general public.

===eScholarship===

eScholarship is a suite of [[open access]] scholarly publishing services and research tools that enable UC departments, research units, publishing programs, and individual scholars to have direct control over the creation and dissemination of their scholarship.

===Online Archive of California (OAC)===

The Online Archive of California (OAC) provides free public access to primary sources—including manuscripts, photographs, artwork, scientific data and more—through more than 38,000 collection guides and 200,000 digitized images and documents.

===Calisphere===

Calisphere is a free website that offers educators, students, and the public access to more than 200,000 primary sources such as photographs, documents, newspapers, political cartoons, works of art, diaries, transcribed oral histories, and other cultural artifacts. These materials reveal the diverse history and culture of California and its role in national and world history.

==Collection Development and Management==

The Collection Development and Management Program oversees and coordinates shared library collections on behalf of the ten University of California campuses. The program acquires scholarly content, manages UC's mass digitization efforts, organizes and supports shared physical library collections, and is responsible for the system-wide negotiation and licensing of shared digital materials for the UC libraries.

===Licensed Resources===

These are the electronic journals, databases, ebooks and other e-resources licensed by CDL on behalf of and in coordination with the ten UC campuses.

===Shared Print===

The University of California Libraries' Shared Print collections consist of information resources jointly purchased or electively contributed by the libraries. Such resources are collectively governed and managed by the University Librarians.

===Mass Digitization===

The UC Libraries are digitizing millions of books from their collections through participation in mass digitization projects with Google, the Internet Archive, and the HathiTrust Digital Library. These projects expand the UC Libraries’ ability to give faculty, students and the public access to information and support our exploration of new service models.

===Shared Cataloging===

The Shared Cataloging Program (SCP) provides catalog records for the University of California campus libraries. Established in January 2000, the program is based at UC San Diego.

==Discovery &amp; Delivery==

The focus of the CDL's Discovery and Delivery team is the integration of library services and resources in order to remove barriers between users and content.&lt;ref name=disc&amp;deli&gt;{{cite web|last=California Digital Library|title=Discovery &amp; Delivery: What we do|url=http://www.cdlib.org/services/d2d/about.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to connect faculty, students, and staff with access to the University of California libraries’ extensive research collections.&lt;ref name="disc&amp;deli"/&gt;

===Melvyl===

Melvyl is the discovery platform for the UC Libraries. Melvyl, powered by OCLC WorldCat Local, offers the ability to search 800 million+ items from research institutions throughout the world.

===UC-eLinks===

UC-eLinks is a feature developed to request resources in the CDL. The UC-eLink button is inserted, through personalized URL manipulation, into library catalogs, online databases, citation programs, and in the citations of articles themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=California Digital Library|title=What UC-eLinks Does|url=http://www.cdlib.org/services/d2d/ucelinks/about_ucelinks.html|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can then use UC-eLinks to access the associated publication, or request access if it is a print-only resource. Interlibrary loan requests can also be made.&lt;ref name="ILL"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huwe|first=Terence|title=Convergence of Interlibrary Loan and Local Collections|journal=Computers in Libraries|date=March 2004|volume=3|issue=24|url=http://irle.berkeley.edu/faculty/huwe/column/mar04.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, UC-eLinks has provided a new opportunity for the analysis of user's resource utilization and request patterns.

'''Chabot Space and Science Center''', located in [[Oakland, California]], is a hands-on center featuring interactive exhibits, a digital [[planetarium]], a large screen theater, hands-on activities and three powerful [[telescopes]].

The Center is the continuation and expansion of a [[public observatory]] that has served [[San Francisco Bay Area]] schools and citizens with [[astronomy]] and [[science]] education programs since 1883. It is named after the father of [[hydraulic mining]] and benefactor of the original Oakland Observatory, [[Anthony Chabot]]. Since 2000, the Center has been located on the western border of Redwoods Regional Park.

==History==
[[Image:Chabot SSC front.jpg|thumbnail|left|The sign at the entrance of the Chabot Space and Science Center.]]

The institution began in 1883 as the Oakland Observatory, through a gift from [[Anthony Chabot]] to the City of Oakland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabotspace.org/aboutus/ |title=Chabot Space &amp; Science Center (CSSC) educates students of all ages on Planet Earth and the universe |accessdate=August 19, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060815021228/http://www.chabotspace.org/aboutus/ |archivedate=August 15, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Oakland Observatory was located in [[downtown Oakland]] and provided public telescope viewing for the community. For decades, it also served as the official timekeeping station for the entire Bay Area, measuring time with its [[transit telescope]].

The observatory moved to its Mountain Boulevard location in 1915 due to increasing [[light pollution]] and urban congestion. In the mid-1960s, the facility was expanded considerably. Throughout this time, the Chabot Science Center, as it was renamed, was staffed mainly by Oakland Unified School District personnel and volunteers. In 1977, seismic safety concerns terminated public school students’ access to the original observatory facility. The observatory building remained open to the general public, but school activities were limited to outlying classroom buildings and the planetarium.

[[File:Wightman Observatory Plaza at Chabot Space and Observatory Center.jpg|thumbnail|Wightman Observatory Plaza at the current location.]]

Recognizing the need to restore full access to the facility, either by repair or relocation, in 1989 Chabot Observatory &amp; Science Center was formed as a Joint Powers Agency with the City of Oakland, the Oakland Unified School District, and the East Bay Regional Park District, in collaboration with the [http://www.eastbayastro.org Eastbay Astronomical Society], and in 1992 was recognized as a nonprofit organization. The project was led by Chabot's Executive Director and CEO, Dr. [[Michael D. Reynolds]], breaking ground for the facility in October 1996 with construction of the new {{convert|88000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} Science Center beginning in May 1998.

In January 2000, anticipating the opening of the new facility, the organization changed its name from Chabot Observatory &amp; Science Center to Chabot Space &amp; Science Center. The new name was chosen to better convey the organization's focus on astronomy and the [[space sciences]], while communicating both the broad range and the technologically advanced nature of programs available in the new Science Center.

Opened August 19, 2000, the Chabot Space &amp; Science Center is an {{convert|86000|sqft|m2|sing=on}}, state-of-the-art science and technology education facility on a {{convert|13|acre|m2|sing=on}} site in the hills of Oakland, California. The museum was formerly an affiliate in the [[Smithsonian Affiliations]] program.&lt;ref name="Chabot"&gt;{{cite web|year=2011|title=Chabot Space and Science Center|work=Affiliate Details|publisher=Smithsonian Affiliations|url=http://affiliations.si.edu/AffiliateDetail.Asp?AffiliateID=17|accessdate=July 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is currently no longer an affiliate.

==Attractions==
Aside from its telescopes, it contains:

[[Image:chabot planetarium.jpg|thumbnail|200px|left|Chabot's Ask Jeeves Planetarium]]

The Planetarium seats 250 people under a {{convert|70|ft|m|sing=on}} diameter dome, and features live weekly shows and daily pre-recorded "[[fulldome]]" shows.  The weekly live shows are presented by a staff astronomer.

*'''Live Show:'''
''Cosmos 360''  uses the planetarium's digital [[fulldome]] system to view the night sky as well as flying through space to see the universe from a different perspective. The guided tour include in-depth views of planets, constellations and other current astronomical events. The show is updated to reflect seasonal night skies.

*'''Daily Shows:'''
The daily shows range from content geared for young children through more sophisticated shows designed for a general audience.

A complete schedule and listing of daily shows as well as current show times can be found at the center's [http://www.chabotspace.org/planetarium-shows.htm planetarium page].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabotspace.org/planetarium-shows.htm Chabot's Planetarium&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] Retrieved August 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Galaxy Explorers program==
The Chabot Space and Science Center offers volunteer and educational opportunities to local teens, who work as explainers on the museum floor or on outreach trips. The program was initiated by a grant from ''YouthALIVE!'' (Youth Achievement through Learning Involvement, Volunteer and Employment!) through the Association of Science-Technology Centers.

{{nihongo|'''''Chagurin'''''|ちゃぐりん}} is a children's magazine published by the "Family Light Association" (家の光協会 ''Ie no Hikari Kyōkai'') in [[Japan]]. The magazine was formerly published under the title '''''Children's Light''''' (こどもの光 ''Kodomo no Hikari'').  

==History and profile==
The magazine was started under the name ''Kodomo no Hikari'' in 1964.&lt;ref name=iru&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Present Status and Problems of the Japanese Cooperative Organizations|journal=IRU - Courier|date=July 2013|issue=2|url=http://www.iru.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/2-2013-E.pdf|accessdate=3 August 2015|publisher=International Raiffeisen Union|location=Bonn|issn=1682-1831}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication is funded by the [[Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Debito Arudou|Arudou, Debito]], "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2013/03/05/issues/childs-quibble-with-u-s-poverty-superpower-propaganda-unravels-a-sobering-story-about-insular-japan/#.UTUds2dy1yI Child’s quibble with U.S. ‘poverty superpower’ propaganda unravels a sobering story about insular Japan]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 5 March 2013, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; It is published on a monthly basis.&lt;ref name=iru/&gt;

In August 1993 the title of the magazine was changed into its current name, ''Chagurin''.&lt;ref name=iru/&gt; The goal of the magazine is to educate the next generation of [[Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives|Japan Agricultural Cooperative]] (or "JA") members. The magazine is difficult to find in the average bookstore in Japan, but it can be purchased at any local JA office. Clear submission guidelines for the children of the magazine's readers are available at any local JA office as well. The contents of ''Chagurin'' are intended to be similar to the educational magazines published by [[Shogakukan]] up through the 1960s, and has received a recommendation from the National PTA of Japan.

Like other magazines aimed at children, it includes a variety of [[manga]]. However, the manga found in ''Chagurin'' tends to be fairly mainstream, non-controversial, and is not generally collected in [[tankōbon]] format (''[[Doraemon]]'' and ''[[Kiteretsu Daihyakka]]'' being exceptions).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5203">'''Cooper Harold Langford''' (25 August 1895, Dublin, [[Logan County, Arkansas]] – 28 August 1964) was an analytic philosopher and mathematical logician who co-authored the book ''Symbolic Logic'' (1932) with [[Clarence Irving Lewis|C. I. Lewis]].

After spending his freshman year at the [[University of Arkansas]], Langford transferred in 1915 to [[Clark University]], where he received his A.B. degree in 1920. His college education was interrupted by World War I in 1917 when he joined the U.S. army and spent 20 months overseas. After receiving his A.B. degree, Langford enrolled in 1920 as a graduate student at [[Harvard University]], where he earned his Ph.D. in psychology under [[Edwin Boring]] in 1924. With the aid of a Sheldon Traveling Fellowship, he studied logic and philosophy at [[Cambridge University]] during 1924–1925. Upon his return to the U.S., Langford became an instructor at Harvard from 1925 to 1927. After spending two academic years, 1927–1929, as an assistant professor at the [[University of Washington]], he became in the autumn of 1929 an associate professor with tenure in the philosophy department at the [[University of Michigan]]. Langford became a full professor at U. Michigan in 1933, remaining there for the rest of his career. In the academic year 1935–1936, he was a Guggenheim fellow, dividing his time between Vienna and Cambridge England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://um2017.org/faculty-history/faculty/cooper-harold-langford Cooper Harold Langford | Faculty History Project – U. of Michigan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gf.org/fellows/8401-cooper-harold-langford Cooper Harold Langford – John Simon Guggeheim Memorial Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Langford is famous as co-author of the 1932 book ''Symbolic Logic'' and the [[S5 (modal logic)|system of modal logic S5]]. His doctoral students include [[Arthur Burks]].

In Philosophy of Language Langford is known for the Langford Substitution test. The test distinguishes used from merely mentioned expressions in a given sentence by translating the sentence into a different language (see Langford 1937). If the very same expression reoccurs in the translation, it was mentioned rather than used in the original sentence. If the expression does not reoccur and is replaced by some other (usually synonymous) expression, then it was used in the original sentence. This test is used by a famous argument from [[Alonzo Church]] concerning Carnaps treatment of belief attributions and other analyses of beliefs as relations to sentences  (see Church 1950).

Langford was married twice. His son [[Cooper H. Langford]] was a chemist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=William|first1=William|last2=Burks|first2=Arthur W.|title=Cooper Harold Langford 1895-1964|journal=Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association|volume=38|pages=99–101|jstor=3129489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Easter term''' is the summer term at the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]], [[University of Durham]], and formerly [[University of Newcastle upon Tyne]] (before 2004&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070521020836/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press.office/newslink/?ref=1077708461 University terms to be renamed], [[University of Newcastle upon Tyne]], UK, 25 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;), in the [[United Kingdom]]. It runs from April to June.

The expression is also used for the third term of the [[legal year]] in the [[Courts of England and Wales]], many schools and other educational institutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6733">'''Ecological literacy''' (also referred to as ''ecoliteracy'') is the ability to understand the [[systems ecology|natural systems]] that make [[life]] on [[earth]] possible. To be ecoliterate means understanding the principles of organization of ecological communities (i.e. [[ecosystem]]s) and using those principles for creating [[sustainable]] human communities. The term was [[neologism|coined]] by American educator [[David W. Orr]] and physicist [[Fritjof Capra]] in the 1990s&lt;ref name=orr&gt;{{cite book| last = Orr| first = David|authorlink=David W. Orr|title = Ecological Literacy: Education and the Transition to a Postmodern World| publisher = S.U.N.Y. Press, NY| year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritjof Capra]], The Web of Life, Harper Collins (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;- thereby a new value entered education; the “well-being of the earth”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Sterling]], Whole Systems Thinking as a Basis for Paradigm Change in Education, PhD paper, University of Bath. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; 

An ecologically literate society would be a [[sustainability|sustainable]] [[society]] which did not destroy the [[natural environment]] on which they depend. Ecological literacy is a powerful concept as it creates a foundation for an integrated approach to environmental problems. Advocates champion eco-literacy as a new educational paradigm emerging around the poles of [[holism]], [[systems thinking]], [[sustainability]], and [[complexity]]. 

== Overview ==
Ecoliteracy concerns understanding the principles of organisation of ecosystems and their potential application to understanding how to build a sustainable [[human society]].&lt;ref&gt;(Capra, 1997: 89).&lt;/ref&gt; It combines the sciences of systems and ecology in drawing together elements required to foster learning processes toward a deep appreciation of nature and our role in it. Systems thinking is the recognition of the world as an integrated whole rather than a collection of individual elements. Within systems thinking, basic principles of organization become more important than the analysis of various components of the system in isolation. Ecological literacy and systems thinking implies a recognition of the manner in which all phenomenon are part of networks that define the way that element functions. Systems thinking is necessary to understand complex [[interdependence]] of [[ecological systems]], [[social system]]s and other systems on all levels.

According to [[Fritjof Capra]], “In the coming decades, the survival of humanity will depend on our ecological literacy – our ability to understand the basic principles of ecology and to live accordingly. This means that ecoliteracy must become a critical skill for [[politician]]s, business leaders, and professionals in all spheres, and should be the most important part of education at all levels – from primary and secondary schools to colleges, universities, and the continuing education and training of professionals.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritjof Capra]], "The New Facts of Life," 2008, {{cite web |url=http://www.ecoliteracy.org/publications/fritjof_capra_facts.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814051039/http://www.ecoliteracy.org/publications/fritjof_capra_facts.html |archivedate=2009-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David W. Orr]] has stated that the goal of ecological literacy is “built on the recognition that the disorder of ecosystems reflects a prior disorder of mind, making it a central concern to those institutions that purport to improve minds. In other words, the ecological crisis is in every way a crisis of education.... All education is environmental education… by what is included or excluded we teach the young that they are part of or apart from the natural world.” He also emphasizes that ecoliteracy does not only require mastery of subject matter, but the creation of meaningful connections between head, hands, and heart as well.&lt;ref&gt;Michael K. Stone and [[Zenobia Barlow]], eds., Ecological Literacy: Educating Our Children for a Sustainable World, Sierra Club Books (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Others have reiterated the urgent importance of ecological literacy in today's world, where young people are faced with escalating environmental challenges, including climate change, depletion of resources, and environmentally linked illnesses. {{quote|This generation will require leaders and citizens who can think ecologically, understand the interconnectedness of human and natural systems, and have the will, ability, and courage to act|Michael K. Stone&lt;ref&gt;Michael K. Stone/[[Center for Ecoliteracy]], Smart by Nature: Schooling for Sustainability, Watershed Media (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With an understanding of ecological literacy, [[perceptions]] naturally shift. The need to protect the ecosystems is not simply a belief held by [[environmentalist]]s; it is a biological imperative for survival over the time. This [[Value (ethics)|value]] will become a basic principle for prioritizing thought and action in a sustainable society. In the face of the increasing capacity of industrial systems to destroy habitats and the [[climate system]], the explicit declaration of the principles of ecological literacy – and the resulting awareness of the importance of living within the ecological [[carrying capacity]] of the earth, is increasingly necessary. Whether ecoliteracy can address the infamous [[value-action gap]] is unclear.

'''Education in [[Lower Dir District]]''' in [[Pakistan]].

==Education demographics==
The total gross enrollment ratio is 73.83%&lt;ref&gt;Education department survey for UPE in year 2005&lt;/ref&gt; without including [[Kachhi (caste)|Kachi]] and 79.59% including Kachi class. Student teacher ratio is 43 students per teacher and there are 41 boys per male teacher and 46 girls per female teacher.

According to the recent [[Universal Primary Education]] (UPE) survey, the total number of children in the age group 5–7 years is 104,498&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Education Department Survey for UPE in 2005&lt;/ref&gt; in which 56,937 &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; are boys and 47,561 are girls. Due to the limited access the number of the out of school children among the age group (5–7 years) are 25,169,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; almost 24% children of the total (age group 5–7 years) are out of the school. In which 19% are boys and 30% are girls. These figures also include the dropped out students both boys and girls.

==Census of schools==
There are 1,023 &lt;ref&gt;Census report of District in 1998&lt;/ref&gt; villages in district Dir lower. There are:
*827 boys primary schools &lt;ref name="EMIS Data Dir Lower"&gt;EMIS Data Dir Lower&lt;/ref&gt;
*405 girls primary schools&lt;ref name="EMIS Data Dir Lower"/&gt;
*62 girls middle schools&lt;ref name="EMIS Data Dir Lower"/&gt;
*90 boys middle schools&lt;ref name="EMIS Data Dir Lower"/&gt;
*14 girls high schools ([[Badwan]], Brangola, [[Chakdara]], Hajiabad, Khadagzai, Talash, [[Timergara]], ...)
*52 boys high school
*12 boys higher secondary schools (Brangola, [[Chakdara]], Hajiabad, Talash, [[Timergara]], ...)
*3 girls secondary school
*120 private schools.
*2 Boys Colleges (Gulabad, [[Timergara]])
*2 Girls Colleges ([[Chakdara]], [[Timergara]])
*1 University ([http://www.uom.edu.pk University of Malakand] at Chakdara, Established in 2001)

Beside the government primary schools, [http://www.khwendokor.org.pk Khwendo Kor] NGO is running 15 schools, [http://www.eef.org.pk Elementary Education Foundation (EEF)] is running 25 schools, ILO is running 7 schools and Non Formal Basic Education (NFBE) is running 95 schools. The numbers of [[madrassas]] (religious schools) are not yet available.

==Literacy rate==
The adult literacy ratio of the district among the population aged 10 years and above is 93.9&lt;ref name="Census District Dir in 1998"&gt;Census District Dir in 1998&lt;/ref&gt; percent which has increased significantly since 1981 when it was just 10.16 percent .The male literacy ratio is higher i.e. 95.76 &lt;ref name="Census District Dir in 1998"/&gt; compared to 85.25 &lt;ref name="Census District Dir in 1998"/&gt; percent for females, according to census report 1998. In district Dir some government and some non government organizations are working on adult literacy.

==Quality measures==
The term Quality Education needs clarity and no such practices are observed in the schools. The PTAs are formed in the schools according to government procedures, but these are only limited to school petty repairs and not involved in the school management.

==International development programmes==
In District Dir the schools and literacy department is supported by the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) for a girls enrollment enhancement programme. They provide the edible oil to the girls enrolled in the low enrollment school. There is need of developing more partnerships among these stakeholders so that the problems of education especially in the [[female education]] are solved.

The [[NGO]] [http://www.khwendokor.org.pk Khwendo Kor] (KK) started a project on “Promotion of Girls Education in Dir” in this project KK strengthened and transformed the VECs (Village Education Committees) formed around the Community Based Girl Schools. The PRAs (Participatory Rural Appraisal) was carried out in 25 villages. Other activities running in District Dir are Women and Men Organization formation, the capacity building of the women organization and men organization was made in social activist, record keeping, PRAs, financial management etc.

KK has now initiated a project on female education in Dir. This project is the combination of some activities, like the Development of District Education Planning, reactivating, strengthening and capacity building of PTAs, [[Education For All|EFA]] forum activation and strengthening, educational budget tracking and Education Facilitation Center establishment, functionalization of the middle and primary schools. KK will facilitate the [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTAs]] to register themselves as CCB with district government and get extra funds from the district development budget. This project will strengthen the public private partnership in education sector. KK has already signed the MoU with School and Literacy Department for undertaking these activities. 
CRC (SPARC) Child rights committee for [[Lower Dir district]] has also focused recently on the Education ratio in Lower Dir. CRC is a  voluntary organization of SPARC working for the children rights in Lower Dir by means of lobbying and advocacy. CRC has now started a campaign against child marriage. Child marriage is also one of those harmful traditional practices which has been declared a criminal offence by the Child Marriage Restraint act 1929, yet they are being held with impunity throughout KPK, where the tradition has stronger roots than law.

==Problems==
According to the [http://www.enwfp.com/index.cfm] EMIS] of the School and literacy department, schools have different problems like drinking water supply, boundary walls, electricity and latrines. After devolution plan improvements are still awaited and the involvement of elected representatives in the monitoring and problem solving will take time. The role of CCBs in the education and schools is not explored and it can give better results if they are engaged in the education.

{{Education in the U.S.}}
The '''Every Student Succeeds Act''' ('''ESSA''') is a US law passed in December 2015 that governs the United States [[K–12]] [[public education in the United States|public education]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Hirschfeld Davis | first = Julie | date = 10 December 2015 | title = President Obama Signs Into Law a Rewrite of No Child Left Behind | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/11/us/politics/president-obama-signs-into-law-a-rewrite-of-no-child-left-behind.html?_r=0 | newspaper = New York Times | access-date = 19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law replaced its predecessor, the [[No Child Left Behind Act|No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB)]], and modified but did not eliminate provisions relating to the periodic [[standardized tests]] given to students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Korte|first= Gregory|date=11 December 2015|title= The Every Student Succeeds Act vs. No Child Left Behind: What's changed?|url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/12/10/every-student-succeeds-act-vs-no-child-left-behind-whats-changed/77088780/|newspaper= USA Today|access-date= 18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Walker | first = Tim | date = 9 December 2015 | title = With Passage of Every Student Succeeds Act, Life After NCLB Begins | url = http://neatoday.org/2015/12/09/every-student-succeeds-act/ | newspaper = NEA Today | access-date = 19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the No Child Left Behind Act, ESSA is a reauthorization of the 1965 [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]], which established the federal government's expanded role in public education.

The Every Student Succeeds Act passed both chambers of Congress with bipartisan support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 10 December 2015 | title = President Obama Signs Education Law, Leaving 'No Child' Behind | url = https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/12/10/459219774/president-obama-signs-education-law-leaving-no-child-behind | newspaper = National Public Radio | access-date = 22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:President Barack Obama signs Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).jpg|thumb|left|President [[Barack Obama]] signs the Act into law, December 2015]]

The bill is the first to narrow the United States federal government's role in elementary and secondary education since the 1980s. The ESSA retains the hallmark annual [[standardized testing]] requirements of the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act but shifts the law's federal accountability provisions to states. Under the law, students will continue to take annual tests between the third and eighth grades.&lt;ref name="Vox: explainer"/&gt;

ESSA leaves significantly more control to the states and districts in determining the standards students are held to. States are required to submit their goals and standards and how they plan to achieve them to the US Department of Education, which must then submit additional feedback, and eventually approve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=DeVos's Hard Line on New Education Law Surprises States|last=Green|first=Erica L|date=July 7, 2017|work=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, the DOE still holds states accountable by ensuring they are implementing complete and ambitious, yet feasible goals. Students will then be tested each year from third through eighth grade and then once again their junior year of high school.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Darrow|first=Alice-Ann|date=October 2016|title=The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)|url=|journal=General Music Today|volume=30|pages=41–44|via=EBSCO host}}&lt;/ref&gt; These standardized tests will determine each student's capabilities in the classroom, and the success of the state in implementing its plans. The states are also left to determine the consequences low-performing schools might face and how they will be supported in the following years.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The USDOE defines low-performing schools as those in the bottom ten percent of the state, based on the number of students who successfully graduate or the number of students who test proficient in reading or language arts and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ed.gov/race-top/district-competition/definitions|title=Definitions|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Department of Education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another primary goal of the ESSA is preparing all students, regardless of race, income, disability, ethnicity, or proficiency in English, for a successful college experience and fulfilling career.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Therefore, ESSA also requires schools to offer college and career counseling and advanced placement courses to all students.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The No Child Left Behind Act was due for reauthorization in 2007, but was not pursued for a lack of bipartisan cooperation.&lt;ref name=mrich2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rich|first1=Mokoto|title=‘No Child’ Law Whittled Down by White House|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/06/education/no-child-left-behind-whittled-down-under-obama.html|accessdate=12 December 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many states failed to meet the NCLB's standards, and the Obama Administration granted waivers to many states for schools that showed success but failed under the NCLB standards.&lt;ref name=mrich&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rich|first1=Motoko|title=No Child Left Behind Law Faces Its Own Reckoning|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/us/politics/schools-wait-to-see-what-becomes-of-no-child-left-behind-law.html|accessdate=12 December 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these waivers usually required schools to adopt academic standards such as the [[Common Core]].&lt;ref name=mrich/&gt; The NCLB was generally praised for forcing schools and states to become more accountable for ensuring the education of poor and minority children.&lt;ref name=mrich2/&gt; However, the increase in standardized testing that occurred during the presidencies of Bush and Obama met with resistance from many parents, and many called for a lessened role for the federal government in education.&lt;ref name=mrich/&gt;
Similarly, the president of the [[National Education Association]] decried the NCLB's "one-size-fits-all model ... of test, blame and punish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eskelsen García|first=Lily|title=Get rid of 'test, blame, punish': Opposing view|newspaper=USA Today|date=21 April 2015|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/21/no-child-left-behind-national-education-association-editorials-debates/26148257/|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his 2014 re-election, Senate [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|HELP Committee]] Chairman [[Lamar Alexander]] (R-TN), who had served as [[United States Secretary of Education|Education Secretary]] under President [[George H.W. Bush]], decided to pursue a major rewrite of No Child Left Behind.&lt;ref name=mseverns/&gt; Alexander and [[Patty Murray]] (D-WA), the ranking member of the HELP committee, collaborated to write a bipartisan bill that could pass the Republican-controlled Congress and earn the signature of President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name=mseverns/&gt; At the same time, [[John Kline (politician)|John Kline]] (R-MN), chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|House Committee on Education and the Workforce]], pushed his own bill in the House. In July 2015, each chamber of the United States Congress passed their own renewals of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.&lt;ref name="Huff: committee"/&gt; President Obama remained largely outside of the negotiations, though Alexander did win Obama's promise to not threaten to veto the bill during negotiations.&lt;ref name=mseverns/&gt; As the House and Senate negotiated for the passage of a single bill in both houses, [[Bobby Scott (U.S. politician)|Bobby Scott]] (D-VA), the ranking member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, became a key player in ensuring Democratic votes in the House.&lt;ref name=mseverns/&gt; By September 2015, the House and Senate had been able to resolve most of the major differences, but continued to differ on how to evaluate schools and how to respond to schools that perform poorly.&lt;ref name=mseverns/&gt; House and Senate negotiators agreed to a proposal from Scott to allow the federal government to mandate specific circumstances in which states had to intervene in schools, while broadly giving states leeway in how to rate schools and in how to help struggling schools.&lt;ref name=mseverns/&gt; Other major provisions included a pre-K program (at the urging of Murray), a provision to help ensure that states would not be able to exempt large swaths of students from testing (at the behest of civil rights groups), and restrictions on the power of the Education Secretary (at the urging of Alexander and Kline).&lt;ref name=mseverns/&gt; The surprise resignation of Speaker [[John Boehner]] nearly derailed the bill, but incoming Speaker [[Paul Ryan]]'s support of the bill helped ensure its passage.&lt;ref name=mseverns/&gt; In December 2015, the House passed the bill in a 359–64 vote; days later, the Senate passed the bill in an 85–12 vote.&lt;ref name="Vox: explainer"/&gt; President Obama signed the bill into law on December 10, 2015.&lt;ref name=mseverns&gt;{{cite news|last1=Severns|first1=Maggie|title=How Congress finally killed No Child Left Behind|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/paul-ryan-congress-no-child-left-behind-216696|accessdate=12 December 2015|publisher=Politico|date=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Students with disabilities ==
The Every Student Succeeds Act also sets new mandates on expectations and requirements for students with disabilities. Most students with disabilities will be required to take the same assessments and will be held to the same standards as other students. ESSA allows for only one percent of students, accounting for ten percent of students with disabilities, to be excused from the usual standardized testing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samuels|first=Christina A.|date=January 6, 2016|title=Special Education Community Gears Up for Advocacy|url=|journal=Education Week|volume=35|pages=21|via=EBSCO Host}}&lt;/ref&gt; This one percent is reserved for students with severe cognitive disabilities, who will be required to take an alternate assessment instead.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccsso.org/Documents/2016/ESSA/ESSA_Key_Provisions_Implications_for_SWD.pdf|title=ESSA: Key Provisions and Implications for Students with Disabilities|last=|first=|date=|website=Council of Chief State School Officers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a smaller percentage of students than under past mandates, mainly because there is not enough staff available to administer the assessments to the students one-on-one.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The Department of Education does not define disabled, rather, each state decides its own definition in order to determine which students will be allowed to take the alternate assessment. This could prove to be more challenging, though, when it comes to comparing students to one another because not all states will define disabled the same way.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The ESSA has also recognized that bullying and harassment in schools disproportionately affects students with disabilities. Because of this, the ESSA requires states to develop and implement plans on how they will combat and attempt to reduce bullying incidents on their campuses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Reception and Opinion==
[[File:President Barack Obama after signing Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).webm|thumb|right|President Obama explains why he signed the Act]]

Libby Nelson of ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' wrote that the ESSA was a victory for conservatives who wished to see federal control of school accountability transferred to states, and that states could choose to make less effort to improve schools serving impoverished students.&lt;ref name="Vox: explainer"/&gt;

== Suspension of accountability requirements ==

An inauguration day directive on January 20, 2017 from President Donald Trump’s Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff “Regulatory Freeze Pending Review”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/24/implementation-regulatory-freeze |title=Memorandum: Implementation of Regulatory Freeze |last= Mark |first= Sandy |date=January 20, 2017 |website=whitehouse.gov |publisher=White House Press Office |access-date=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; delayed implementation of new regulations, including portions of the Every Student Succeeds Act. On February 10, 2017, U.S. Secretary of Education [[Betsy DeVos]] wrote to chief state school officers that “states should continue their work” in developing their ESSA plans and noted that a revised template may be issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2017/02/betsy_devos_to_state_chiefs_ESSA_full_speed_ahead.html

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5274">'''Evolving capacities''' is the concept in which [[education]], [[child development]] and [[youth development]] [[youth programs|programs]] led by adults take into account the capacities of the [[child]] or [[youth]] to exercise [[youth rights|rights]] on his or her own behalf. It is also directly linked to the right to be heard, requiring adults to be mindful of their responsibilities to respect children's rights, protect them from harm, and provide opportunities so they can exercise their rights.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolving Capacities of the Child|last=Lansdown|first=Gerison|publisher=UNICEF|year=2005|isbn=8889129158|location=New York|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of evolving capacities is employed internationally as a direct alternative to popular concepts of [[child development|child]] and [[youth development]].&lt;ref&gt;Lansdown, G. (2005) ''Understanding the implications of human rights treaty: evolving capacities of the child.'' UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre.&lt;/ref&gt;  

==About==

The concept of evolving capacities of the child first emerged in international law through the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. Article Five of the Convention says that:

{{cquote|States Parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents or, where applicable, the members of the extended family or community as provided for by local custom, legal guardians or other persons legally responsible for the child, to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the present Convention.}}

Article twelve also addresses evolving capacities, stating that:
{{cquote|States Parties shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her own views the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child. For this purpose, the child shall in particular be provided the opportunity to be heard in any judicial and administrative proceedings affecting the child, either directly, or through a representative or an appropriate body, in a manner consistent with the procedural rules of national law.}}

Evolving capacities recognizes that as children acquire enhanced competencies there is less need for protection and a greater possibility that they can take responsibility for decisions affecting their lives. It is presupposed by the [[Gradualism|gradualist conception]] of children's rights, which suggests that children move progressively from a situation in which their rights primarily protect their interests to one in which their rights primarily protect their choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Educational Theory and Philosophy|last=Phillips|first=D.C.|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2014|isbn=9781452230894|location=Los Angeles, CA|pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Convention allows for the recognition that children in different environments and cultures, and faced with diverse life experiences, will acquire competencies at different ages. This is the reason why the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]] has sought information on minimum legal ages for legal and medical [[List of counseling topics|counseling]] or medical treatment without parental consent, creating and joining associations, and participating in administrative and judicial proceedings when it developed the guidelines relating to Article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The [[Canadian International Development Agency]] reports that there are three primary points to consider regarding evolving capacities:
#Evolving capacities should be understood in the context of where children grow;
#Evolving capacities should grow out of respect for the competencies young people already have, and;
#Adults should protect young people from experiences and decisions they have not yet acquired the capacity to take responsibility for.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.) ''Evolving Capacities and Participation.'' Canadian International Development Agency.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adequate and systematic documentation is an example of initiatives that integrate the concept of evolving capacities in education. The strategy can support teacher determine how learners' capacities evolve over time and develop necessary interventions and responses to meaningfully address individual children's right to development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning and Teaching in the Early Years|last=Page|first=Jane|last2=Tayler|first2=Colette|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2016|isbn=9781107697188|location=Melbourne|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fourth year''', also known as '''S4''', is the fourth year of schooling in Scottish, Venezuelan, Ecuadorian, Colombian, and other Latin American countries  [[secondary schools]], and is roughly equivalent to [[Year Eleven (School)|Year 10]] in England and Wales and Year 12 (Sixth Form) in Northern Ireland. In Latin American countries, it is equal to the United States high school's [[senior (education)|senior year]], but the Scottish S4 is equivalent to [[10th grade]]. Most pupils are 15 or 16 years old at the end of S4. It is at the end of this year the pupils completed their [[Standard Grade]], or Intermediates examinations, as of 2013 it is the National 4/5 examinations for the new Curriculum for Excellence . It is also usually the last year of compulsory education in Scotland, depending on what time of the year the pupil was born. Near the end of fourth year pupils pick the subjects they want to take for highers (or A levels as they call it in England). They can also leave school if they are 16.

The term can also refer to the fourth year of a [[university]] course.

'''fraLine''' is a non-profit (research) project of [[Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankfurt-university.de/de/fachbereiche/fb2/forschung_institute_projekte/fraline.html Project on the Website of the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt; Project and research activities focus on IT services management for schools and the use of digital media in educational settings. fraLine is also a joint project between the University of Applied Sciences and the city of [[Frankfurt]] am Main (represented by the "Stadtschulamt" = municipal school-maintaining body).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=4096&amp;_ffmpar_id_inhalt=20557 City of Frankfurt website]&lt;/ref&gt; fraLine and the city of Frankfurt cooperate in the fields of IT support and IT service management in educational contexts as well as technical implementation of digital media in class. fraLine also cooperates with the Hessian state education authority ("[[:de:Staatliches Schulamt|Staatliches Schulamt]]") in the field of media education and digital media training for teachers. 
fraLine was launched in 2001 and employs mainly technical students of the University of Applied Sciences and [[Goethe University Frankfurt]], but also IT professionals, engineers and media educators.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [http://www.thomas-knaus.de Dr. Thomas Knaus] and [http://fraline.de/personen/team fraLine team page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development projects==

===Projects===
fraLine conducts research in the fields of [[IT service management]] according to [[ITIL]] recommendations&lt;ref&gt;cf. e.g. [http://fraline.de/images/Downloads/Qualifikationsarbeiten/diplomarbeit_itil_schmelz_09Aug.pdf "Analysis of ITSM elements in the technical support for schools of a major school-maintaining body as to their consistency with ITIL recommendations" by Anthony Schmelz]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the field of IT support and digital media use in educational contexts including [[educational software]], [[media literacy]] etc. 
Research results and concepts are provided to the city of Frankfurt ("Stadtschulamt") for the improvement of information technology in schools and the establishment of a centrally managed school IT infrastructure in the municipal area. Therefore, fraLine also offers advisory services to the city of Frankfurt, to all municipal schools as well as other educational institutions on topics such as acquisition of computers or computer parts, hardware, IT security, remote service etc.

Research in technical areas is complemented by studies in media education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomas-knaus.de/index.php/en/research Research projects by Dr. Thomas Knaus]&lt;/ref&gt; Results in the field of media education and current media projects are presented on the annual expert conference "fraMediale"&lt;ref&gt;The list of speakers in 2009 included the mayor of Frankfurt Mrs. [[Jutta Ebeling]] and the President of the University of Applied Sciences Frankfurt Dr.-Ing. [[Detlev Buchholz]] as well as several representatives of "Project Lehr@mt" at Frankfurt Goethe University [http://www.zlf.uni-frankfurt.de/wir-ueber-uns/neue-medien/index.html "Project Lehr@mt"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.framediale.de Conference webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; which is hosted and organized by fraLine.&lt;ref&gt;A conference volume is published by "kopaed" (German publishing house) under the title [http://www.kopaed.de/kopaedshop/index.php?PRODUCT_ID=697 "fraMediale - digitale Medien in Bildungseinrichtungen"]&lt;/ref&gt;

fraLine developed the "fraDesk", a multi-user capable [[trouble ticket system]] for coordinating and documenting customer requests, incident reports or general processes based on division of labor. fraLine uses this software in its own everyday routine. The "fraDesk" is free software and was presented at the [[CeBIT]] 2008 in [[Hanover]], Germany.

Other research projects conducted by fraLine employees&lt;ref&gt;cp. [http://www.fraline.de/index.php/en/publications/academic-papers-and-reports List of publications on the project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; include the development of standard resource administration and user management for schools, improvement of school support via remote maintenance and support, but also media educational topics such as content filtering, evaluation of [[educational software]] and media communication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kopaed.de/kopaedshop/index.php?PRODUCT_ID=637 "Kommunigrafie - eine empirische Studie zur Bedeutung von Text und Bild in der digitalen Kommunikation" ("An empirical study concerning the meaning of text and image in digital communication") by Dr. Thomas Knaus ]&lt;/ref&gt;

fraLine publishes relevant information for schools as well as research results in the form of test reports and academic papers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fraline.de/index.php/en/publications Test reports and academic papers]&lt;/ref&gt; a glossary,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fraline.de/index.php/de/glossar Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; and a large set of FAQ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fraline.de/faq/ fraLine "FAQ" knowledge database"]&lt;/ref&gt; The FAQ database is a practical [[knowledge base]] [[Knowledge base]] and used as a point of reference for local teachers and others. It includes technical tutorials and information on the Frankfurt local school network, operating systems, software, hardware, peripheral equipment, the Internet, licenses and rights of utilization. 
Additionally, fraLine offers tutorials and introductory courses imparting theoretical and practical knowledge to school teachers and school IT representatives in Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Online platform for providers of seminars and workshops in Frankfurt hosted by the state education authority ("Staatliches Schulamt für die Stadt Frankfurt am Main") [http://www.medienbildung-frankfurt.de/ "Regionale Medienbildung"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support services for schools==
The fraLine student team offers practical IT support to all 152 schools in Frankfurt by operating a telephone hotline, the Internet-based helpdesk "fraDesk" and through on-site service. Financed by public funds through the city of Frankfurt the service is free of charge for schools. It covers everyday troubleshooting relating to [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]], as well as software installation, actualisation and handling. In order to coordinate its support services, fraLine cooperates with so-called "IT representatives" in every school. They are appointed by their school principals and responsible for collecting IT-incidents and requests in their schools and communicating them to fraLine. Here, fraLine functions as first point of contact ("single-point-of-contact"). If problems cannot be solved by telephone, fraLine employees visit schools on-site or help them to refer their request to the competent authorities (e.g. school maintaining body ("Stadtschulamt"), or the Department of Information and Communicational Technology).&lt;ref&gt;e.g. the Deutschherrenschule (secondary school in Frankfurt) includes fraLine in its [http://www.schuleundzukunft.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Medienschulen/Medienkonzept_Deutschherrenschule.pdf  "media concept" (page 3f.)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes criticized that IT-support carried out by students does not match the schools´ need for a "professional" support. On the other hand, only senior students who are identified as possessing the necessary qualifications are accepted at the project. 
In addition to the technical support, fraLine also offers training courses for teachers and school administration staff in the fields of IT-infrastructure and media use in educational contexts.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Online platform for providers of seminars and workshops in Frankfurt hosted by the state education authority ("Staatliches Schulamt für die Stadt Frankfurt am Main") [http://www.medienbildung-frankfurt.de/ "Regionale Medienbildung"]&lt;/ref&gt; 
As another way to support schools, fraLine launched the project "educational-technical assistance". As part of this project, fraLine employees accompany teachers during class offering them technical assistance with the digital media devices they plan to use in their lesson. The project aims at reducing technical insecurities of teachers and wants to promote a broader use of digital media in education.

==Partnerships, cooperations and awards==
fraLine contributes to various multi-organisational and interdisciplinary initiatives in Frankfurt am Main, in the federal state of Hesse and in Germany responding to the growing demand for a sensible use of media in education. Thus, fraLine maintains close partnerships with its sister projects in Bremen&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schul-support-service.de/ School support service in the city of Bremen "S3"]&lt;/ref&gt; and Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://3s.hh.schule.de/ School support service in the city of Hamburg "3S"]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2007, fraLine was awarded with the "Germany – Land of Ideas" award. "Land of Ideas" is an initiative under the patronage of former German Federal President [[Horst Köhler]]. Public or private institutions that have developed innovations and ideas are nominated as so-called "landmarks in the land of ideas" for one year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.land-of-ideas.org/CDA/landmark_of_the_day,6482,1,,en.html?action=detail&amp;id=3303 ''Land of Ideas'' (June 10, 2008), "A Win-Win Situation"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Glenlee''''' is a steel-hulled three-masted [[barque]], built in 1896 for Glasgow owners, trading as a cargo ship.&lt;ref name="Schäuffelen2005" /&gt; From 1922 she was a sail training ship in the Spanish Navy. She is now a [[museum ship]] at the [[Riverside Museum]] on Pointhouse Quay, [[Glasgow]], known as '''The Tall Ship at Glasgow Harbour'''.

== Description ==

''Glenlee'' was built by Anderson Rodger &amp; Company at their Bay Shipyard in [[Port Glasgow]] for the Glen-line of the Glasgow shipping company Archibald Sterling &amp; Co. Ltd., and was launched on 3 December 1896.&lt;ref name="Brown2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Brown|title=Britain's Historic Ships: A Complete Guide to the Ships that Shaped the Nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=moZ-uEETj1QC&amp;pg=PA48|date=4 August 2009|publisher=Bloomsbury USA|isbn=978-1-84486-093-7|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has a hull length of {{convert|245.5|ft|m|abbr=on}}, beam of {{convert|37.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} and depth of {{convert|22.5|ft|m|abbr=on}}, the [[o/a|over-all]] length with the spike bowsprit is {{convert|282|ft|m|abbr=on}}.

She has 1,613 GRT and 1,490 NRT.{{clarify|reason=Not same as listed in infobox; which is correct?|date=August 2014}} Rigged only with double topgallant sails over double top sails, she was not equipped with [[royal (sail)|royal sails]] (baldheader rigging) to save costs concerning gear and seamen. As with many baldheaded sailing ships the square sails were a little wider than the sails of a standard rigging to gain sail area for a better propulsion.

== Career ==
[[File:Glenlee at Riverside Museum.jpg|200px|thumb|left|''Glenlee'' docked at her new home outside the [[Riverside Museum]], Glasgow.]]
On 13 December 1896, just ten days after she was launched fully rigged and seaworthy, her maiden voyage brought her in [[ballast tank|ballast]] to [[Liverpool]] and from there with a general cargo to [[Portland, Oregon]]. For 23 years she traded as a bulk cargo carrier under the [[Civil ensign|Red Ensign]] via [[Cape of Good Hope]] to [[Australia]], returning via [[Cape Horn]], firstly under the ownership of Archibald Sterling and Co, Glasgow, then as ''Islamount'' of Islamount Sailing Ship Co Ltd (Robert Ferguson &amp; Co), [[Dundee]](1898-1905), and finally with the Flint Castle Shipping Co Ltd (Robert Thomas &amp; Co), Liverpool (1905-1918).

''Islamount'' was renamed the ''Clarastella'' in 1919 when she changed hands to the Star of Italy Italian Shipping Company ({{lang-it|Società Italiana di Navigazione Stella d'Italia}}) of [[Milan]] who registered her in [[Genoa]]. The new owner had her repaired and equipped with two auxiliary diesel engines (1922).

In 1922 the ship came into the hands of the Officers' Military Navy School ({{lang-es|[[Escuela Naval Militar de Oficiales]]}}) as ''Galatea'' to be used as a sail training ship. During this period the ship underwent a lot of changes to her [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] and [[superstructure]]. A flying bridge was installed on the [[poop deck]], a flying jibboom was attached to the spike bowsprit, and many other changes such as the installation of accommodation facilities for 300 cadets.

In April 1931 she became part of the [[Spanish Republican Navy]]. At the time of the [[Spanish coup of July 1936|coup of July 1936]] she was at sea and reached [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]], a harbour that had been taken by the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist faction]].

== Preservation ==

After more than 47 years of service as a sail and later on as a stationary training ship she was first laid up in [[A Graña]], Ferrol, her Spanish port of registry. In 1981 the underwater hull was re-plated at the drydock in Ferrol. Later ''Galatea'' was completely de-rigged down to a hulk (all yards with standing and running rigging and even the masts removed) and was towed to [[Seville]] to be used as a floating museum, but left forgotten. Some sources{{which|date=August 2014}} even reported that the ship was sunk in the harbour by removing her bronze sea cock valve, but salvaged later by the Spanish Navy.

In any case, the ship was in such poor condition that it was eventually decided to scrap her. In 1990 a British naval architect (Dr. Sir John Brown, 1901-2000) discovered the ship and in 1993 she was rescued from being scrapped and subsequently bought by the Clyde Maritime Trust at auction for ₧5000,000 or £40,000. After making the hull seaworthy (all openings on deck were closed and the flying bridge spanning the poop deck during her service in Spain and the attached flying jibboom were removed) the ship was returned to Glasgow months later in tow from Seville. 
[[File:Glenlee figurehead.jpg|200px|thumb|left|''Glenlee''{{'}}s figurehead "Mary Doll".]]
After preliminary works in dry-dock such as the removal of the unnecessary propellers, the check and repair of all the plates below the waterline and new paint, a six-year-long process of restoration began including a new cut wooden figurehead, a complete set of new rigging including the re-assembling and re-stepping of her original masts and re-crossing of the old yards (1998), as well as many other replacements (original deckhouses) and repairs. Her old masts and many of the old yards, which still existed somewhere in Spain, were given back by the Spanish when they realized that the old ship would be really renewed to her original "Cape Horn status", painted grey again with "gun ports".{{clarify|reason=Why scare quotes?|date=August 2014}}

Except for the hull a new ship had to be rebuilt. All the changes made to the ship by the Spanish and previous owners had to be removed, such as all the cabins built for the trainees and a lot of scrap iron ballast in the frames of the holds. First of all she was given back her original name, ''Glenlee'', by the Lord Provost of Glasgow on 6 July 1993 when the ship arrived in Glasgow for the first time since her launch in 1896 at her old and new port of registry - Glasgow Harbour. ''Glenlee'' is now recognised as part of the [[National Historic Fleet]].
 
As a museum ship and tourist attraction, ''Glenlee'' offers educational programmes, events including exhibitions and is a venue for the [[West End Festival]] and volunteering opportunities. Since June 2011, the ship has been open at Glasgow's new [[Riverside Museum]].

Goseck, a [[monastery]] built on the foundations of a [[castle]], as well as the [[vineyard]] of Dechantenberg is located in the municipality of Goseck of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] in [[Germany]]. It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. The World Heritage nomination [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]] is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the [[High Middle Ages]] between 1000 and 1300: [[Christianization]], the so-called “[[Landesausbau]]”  and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Robert|title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350|date=1994|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== World Heritage Nomination ==
Goseck and its vineyard is one of the eleven components of the cultural landscape [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]]. Together with the agricultural features on the northern slopes of the Saale and the sandstone quarries used for the building of the monastery, this ensemble conveys the different forms of land use of the [[medieval]] monastery structures.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2017): WHC/17/41.COM/INF.8B1.{{cite book|title=Nominations to the World Heritage List (Krakow, 2017).|publisher= UNESCO press|page=54|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History == 
[[File:Vineyard Steinmeister.jpg|thumb|Vineyard Steinmeister]]
Goseck Castle was part of a network of [[Franks|Frankish]] [[castles]] on the [[Saale]] River. It was founded around the year 800. The counts of Goseck were one of the noblest aristocratic families of the empire in the [[10th Century in Germany|10th]] and [[11th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Pfalzgrafen von Sachsen bis zum Jahre 1088. ''In:'' Braunschweigisches Jahrbuch 36.|trans-title= The palsgraves of Saxony until the year 1088.''In:'' Yearbook of Braunschweig 36.|page=24–52|author=Starke, Heinz-Dieter|publisher=City of Braunschweig|date=1955|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Count Frederick I of Goseck had his center of power in Goseck . In 1041, Adalbert (archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen from 1043) founded a [[Benedictine monastery]] in the eastern part of the noble castle of Goseck. The minster was erected in 1046.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Burg, Kloster und Schloss Goseck. Zum Stand der baugeschichtlichen Erforschung. ''In:'' Denkmalpﬂege in Sachsen-Anhalt 7 |trans-title=Castle, monastery and palace Goseck. Research on the building history. In: Preservation of historical monuments in Saxony-Anhalt 7.|page=1–30|author=Schmitt, Reinhard|publisher=Saxony-Anhalt|date=1999|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
It is situated 9 kilometers northeast of Naumburg across the Saale Valley on the opposite bank. This monastery of the 11th century is a preserved and documented structure of the High Middle Ages. It was built to be visible from afar, offering lines of sight to most of the monuments in the nominated areas.

== Architecture ==
The [[crypt]] and [[choir]] of the monastery church display the very best of [[Salian]] architecture. Goseck is an example for the transformation of a noble family’s hereditary seat into a monastery with dynastic memorial tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quellen zur Geschichte und Baugeschichte von Burg, Kloster und Schloss Goseck. ''In:'' Saale-Unstrut-Jahrbuch 4. |trans-title=Sources on history and building history of the castle, monastery and palace Goseck. In: Yearbook of Saale-Unstrut 4.|page=28–43|author=Schmitt, Reinhard|publisher=Saxony-Anhalt|date=1999|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Viniculture ==
In the chronicles of the Benedictines of the Goseck monastery the terraced vineyard below the site is dated back to the year 1093; it is the oldest vineyard in continuous use in the nominated region. The Dechantenberg vineyard is exposed to the south.

'''Highland Aviation Training Ltd''' is an Authorised Training Facility at [[Inverness Airport]].&lt;ref  name=CAAstd31&gt;Civil Aviation Authority. Standards Document 30: Private Pilots Licensing Registered Training Facilities including Seaplane Training Facilities. 10 January 2012. [http://www.caa.co.uk/application.aspx?catid=33&amp;pagetype=65&amp;appid=11&amp;mode=detail&amp;id=1210]&lt;/ref&gt;

Highland Aviation provides training towards the [[Pilot licensing in the United Kingdom|EASA/CAA Private Pilots Licence (PPL), the EASA/CAA Light Aircraft Pilot's Licence (LAPL)]] and the CAA UK National Private Pilots Licence (NPPL).  It also provides training for the UK CAA IMC rating (EASA IR(R)) and the night rating.&lt;ref name=CAAstd31 /&gt;  

In addition to these ratings Highland Aviation also provides beach landing courses&lt;ref name=beach&gt;Highland Aviation. The Inverness Flying School. ''Beach Landing course''. [http://www.highlandaviation.com/courses__prices/beach_landing.asp] Retrieved 6 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and mountain flying training.&lt;ref name=mountain&gt;Highland Aviation.

== Mountain flying ==
Situated near the [[Cairngorms]] and the [[Scottish Highlands]], Inverness Airport is a suitable place from which to explore and learn to fly around mountains. Highland Aviation offers trial flights and training courses in mountain flying.&lt;ref name=mountain /&gt; 

[[Ben Nevis]], Scotland's highest mountain, extends up to only 4,409&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.munromagic.com/MountainInfo.cfm?Mountain=1  MunroMagic.

Article discussing performance vs altitude]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beach landings ==
[[File:GLAZL GBNHG atSollas.jpg|thumb|left|Highland Aviation aircraft&lt;ref name=Aircraft/&gt; at [[Sollas]]]]
Beach landing is illegal in most countries without proper permission.&lt;ref name=newyorktimearticle &gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/nyregion/06plane.html New York Times. Article concerning pilot who landed on a beach]&lt;/ref&gt;  With many secluded areas with long sandy beaches, Scotland is one of the few regions in the world where beach landings are possible.  Highland Aviation is the only training provider in the UK to offer a dedicated course of beach landing instruction. Most of the course is completed at [[Barra Airport (Scotland)|Barra]] and [[Sollas]].&lt;ref name=beach /&gt;

Beach landings are accomplished by using a ''soft field'' approach&lt;ref&gt;[http://flighttraining.aopa.org/students/maneuvers/skills/softfield.html  FlightTraining.AOPA. Article discussing Soft Field Landing Techniques]&lt;/ref&gt; with power remaining on throughout the procedure.  This will result, if executed correctly, in a very smooth touchdown with a high nose attitude.  The nose can then be lowered onto the beach gently to avoid digging into the soft sand.

== History ==

Ed Lerner, a former [[ABC News]] documentary maker, founded the company with his wife Ana Cristina Lerner in order to create informational and educational programming that reflected the burgeoning [[Information Age]]. In 1992, ITV produced its first series, ''The Cutting Edge Medical Report'', a documentary medical series which went on to a 10-year run of 200 half-hour episodes which aired on PBS. In 2004, ''The Cutting Edge Medical Report'' was revamped and became ''Healthy Body, Healthy Mind'', a similar series but with an increased focus on health and wellness. As of May 2, 2016, a total of 300 episodes of ''Healthy Body, Healthy Mind'' have aired over the course of 32 seasons on more than 200 public television stations nationwide.

ITV also produced other educational televisions shows focused around children and teen health issues. In 1997, ITV produced ''Hall Pass'', a syndicated teen news show, which ran for one season and featured the first television appearance of then 14-year-old [[Chyler Leigh]] as co-host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1997-02-04/news/9702060278_1_teens-miami-florida-atlantic-university|title=Stars Are Born - Locally Produced TV Program Hall Pass Finds Talent Close To Home|last1=Eisner|first1=Randi|last2=Cohen|first2=Nina|date=February 4, 1997|quote=Hall Pass episodes will be taped during the spring at Information Television Studios in Boca Raton.|access-date=May 2, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428200857/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1997-02-04/news/9702060278_1_teens-miami-florida-atlantic-university|archivedate=April 28, 2016|newspaper=South Florida Sun-Sentinel|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, ITV produced ''Kids HealthWorks'', a documentary series on children's health which aired on [[Discovery Health Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=The National Dairy Council and The American Academy of Pediatrics Partner In New Discovery Health Channel Series Called Kids HealthWorks|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-national-dairy-council-and-the-american-academy-of-pediatrics-partner-in-new-discovery-health-channel-series-called-kids-healthworks-77038517.html|website=prnewswire.com|publisher=PR Newswire|quote=[...] in a new Discovery Health Channel series called Kids HealthWorks.|location=Rosemont, Illinois|date=April 18, 2002|access-date=May 2, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428202904/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-national-dairy-council-and-the-american-academy-of-pediatrics-partner-in-new-discovery-health-channel-series-called-kids-healthworks-77038517.html|archivedate= April 28, 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ITV produced ''E-Venture Kids'', a pre-teen educational television pilot, which aired on more than 40 PBS stations and featured the first television acting appearance of then 10-year-old [[Ariana Grande]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2005-05-05/news/0505041529_1_world-surfing-dream-foundation-pilot|title=World Surfing - Boca Philanthropist Backs TV Show Taking Kids On Computer Adventure|last=Fernandez|first=Mireidy|date=May 5, 2005|quote=The pilot for E-Venture Kids will premiere on WXEL at 8 p.m. Saturday and air on more than 40 other PBS stations nationwide.|access-date=May 2, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026004821/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2005-05-05/news/0505041529_1_world-surfing-dream-foundation-pilot|archivedate=October 26, 2015|newspaper=South Florida Sun-Sentinel|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Planetarium Society, Inc.''' (IPS) is the global association of [[planetarium]] professionals. Its nearly 700 members come from [[List of planetariums|35 countries]] around the world. They represent schools, colleges and universities, museums, and public facilities of all sizes, including both fixed and portable planetariums. The primary goal of the Society is to encourage the sharing of ideas among its members through conferences, publications, and networking. By sharing their insights and creative work, IPS members become better planetarians.

IPS membership is open to anyone interested in planetariums. Members include directors, teachers, technicians, writers, artists, media specialists, digital artists and producers, presenters, vendors, scientists, students, and sponsors and friends of the planetarium dome and its starry sky.

More than 20 regional and national planetarium associations from around the world are affiliated with IPS. Representatives from those affiliates, together with the elected officers, make up the Executive Council, the ruling body of the organization.

== History&lt;ref&gt;"[https://ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/?page=a_Engle1982 Historical Aspects of the International Planetarium Society]," Paul R. Engle, ''Planetarian'', Vol. 11 No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/?page=weinrich40year A Forty-year Perspective of the International Planetarium Society]," Dave Weinrich, ''Proceedings of the 47th Annual GLPA Conference'' in Champaign, Illinois, October 19–22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ==
The genesis of what was to become the International Planetarium Society began with a meeting of planetarium educators in 1958 at the Cranbrook Institute in Michigan. Sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF), about 100 delegates from 67 facilities attended. The conference's proceedings were published as ''[https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/pdf-pubs/1958_cranbrook_proceedings.pdf Planetaria and Their Uses for Education]''.

Another meeting was sponsored by the NSF in 1960, this time in Cleveland, Ohio, and resulted in ''[https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/pdf-pubs/1960_cleveland_proceedings.pdf Planetariums and Their Uses for Education, Volume 2].'' At this meeting those attending voted to initiate a national planetarium association called the American Association of Planetarium Operators, but nothing came out of the action.

Regional associations of planetarium educators formed in the 1960s, resulting in the forming of GLPA, MAPS, SWAP, PPA, RMPA, and SWAP, and PAC was formed in Canada.

More than 300 planetarians gathered in 1970 at the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University in East Lansing at a meeting called CAPE - the Conference of Planetarium Educators. At this meeting the decision was made to organize a North American planetarium association and publish a journal. By-laws for the International Society of Planetarium Educators were approved in 1971, and the journal, ''Planetarian'', began in 1972. Paul Engle from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock Planetarium became the first president, and the first editor was Frank C. Jettner from the Department of Astronomy at the State University of New York at Albany. Among the articles in the first issue was "Science and Communication" by Isaac Asimov.

== Early Planetarians ==
The planetarium field's earliest members were those who invented and modified the equipment used to project the stars onto the dome.
Among them are
* [[Walther Bauersfeld]], often called the "father" of planetariums, for his development of the Zeiss 1 model opto-mechanical projector in 1923
* [[Armand Spitz]], who developed an early inexpensive opto-mechanical projector
* [[Richard H. Emmons]], who helped establish more than 23 planetariums

== Awards ==
The highest award given by IPS is the '''Service Award''', started in 1982. This award is bestowed, from time to time, by the Society upon an individual or institution whose presence and work in the planetarium field has been, through the years, an inspiration to the profession and its members.” Since 1982 there have been 23 people&lt;ref&gt;https://ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/?page=awardees&lt;/ref&gt; awarded with the IPS Service Award.

Similarly, the IPS '''Technology and Innovation Award''' is given by the Society, from time to time, upon an individual whose technology and/or innovations in the planetarium field have been, through the years, used or replicated by other members and/or other planetariums.” The award began in 2009 and 4 persons&lt;ref&gt;https://ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/?page=awardees&lt;/ref&gt; have been recognized.

Deserving IPS members also may be named a '''Fellow''' of the Society. To be named, a member must have continuous active membership in good standing in IPS for at least five years and substantial contributions in at least two of the following respects:

* Serving IPS in effective office, diligent and/or devoted committee work, and the organization of conferences and meetings.
* Relevant and significant publications and/or conference presentations.
* Cooperation with professional societies, organizations and groups which bring attention to the importance of planetariums’ existence.
* The development of new methods in the planetarium field.

'''John Stewart Williamson''' (April 29, 1908 – November 10, 2006), who wrote as '''Jack Williamson''', was an American [[list of science fiction authors|science fiction writer]], often called the "Dean of Science Fiction" after the death of [[Robert Heinlein]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfwa.org/pressbook/SFWAPR/20060717-HeinleinAward.html "Jack Williamson, Greg Bear: Two SFWA pillars honored with 2006 Heinlein Award"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924230659/http://www.sfwa.org/pressbook/SFWAPR/20060717-HeinleinAward.html |date=2006-09-24 }}. [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America|SFWA]] Pressbook.  Retrieved 2007. {{page needed |date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his career he sometimes used the [[pseudonym]]s '''Will Stewart''' and '''Nils O. Sonderlund'''.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;

== Early life ==

Williamson was born April 29, 1908 in [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]], [[Arizona Territory]], and spent his early childhood in western Texas. In search of better pastures, his family migrated to rural [[New Mexico]] in a horse-drawn [[Conestoga wagon|covered wagon]] in 1915.&lt;ref name="autobio"&gt;Williamson, Jack. ''Wonder's Child: My Life in Science Fiction'' (Benbella Books, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The farming was difficult there and the family turned to ranching, which they continue to this day.  He served in the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] in [[World War II]] as a [[weather forecaster]].

As a child Williamson enjoyed storytelling to his brother and two sisters. As a young man, he discovered the magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', established in 1926 by [[Hugo Gernsback]], after answering an ad for one free issue. He strove to write his own fiction and sold his first story to Gernsback at age 20: "The Metal Man" was published in the December 1928 issue of ''Amazing''.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; During the next year Gernsback published three more of his stories in the new [[pulp magazines]] ''Science Wonder Stories'' and ''[[Air Wonder Stories]]'', and separately published "The Girl from Mars" by [[Miles J. Breuer]] and Williamson as ''Science Fiction Series #1''.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; His work during this early period was heavily influenced by [[Abraham Merritt|A. Merritt]],&lt;ref name="moskowitz"&gt;[[Moskowitz, Sam]]. "Jack Williamson: Four-Way Pioneer". ''Amazing Stories'', October 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; author of ''[[The Metal Monster]]'' (1920) and other fantasy serials. Noting the Merritt influence, [[Algis Budrys]] described "The Metal Man" as "a story full of memorable images".&lt;ref&gt;"Galaxy Bookshelf", ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'', December 1967, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on, Williamson became impressed by the works of [[Miles J. Breuer]] and struck up a correspondence with him. A doctor who wrote science fiction in his spare time, Breuer had a strong talent and turned Williamson away from dreamlike fantasies towards more rigorous plotting and stronger narrative. Under Breuer's tutelage, Williamson would send outlines and drafts for review.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; Their first work together was the novel ''Birth of a New Republic'' in which [[Moon]] colonies were undergoing something like [[the American Revolution]]—a theme later taken up by many other SF writers, particularly in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]]''.

Wracked by emotional storms and believing many of his physical ailments to be psychosomatic, Williamson underwent psychiatric evaluation in 1933 at the [[Menninger Clinic]] in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Kansas]], in which he began to learn to resolve the conflict between his reason and his emotion.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; From this period, his stories take on a grittier, more realistic tone.

By the 1930s he was an established genre author, and the teenaged [[Isaac Asimov]] was thrilled to receive a postcard from Williamson, whom he had idolized, which congratulated him on his first published story and offered "welcome to the ranks".&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt; Williamson remained a regular contributor to the [[pulp magazine]]s but did not achieve financial success as a writer until many years later.

An unfavorable review of one of his books, which compared his writing to that of a [[comic strip]], brought Williamson to the attention of ''The New York Sunday News'', which needed a science fiction writer for a new comic strip. Williamson wrote the strip ''[[Beyond Mars]]'' (1952–55), loosely based on his novel ''[[Seetee Ship]]'', until the paper dropped all comics.

Beginning 1954 and continuing into the 1990s, Williamson and [[Frederick Pohl]] wrote more than a dozen science fiction novels together, including the series Jim Eden, Starchild, and Cuckoo.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;
Williamson continued to write as a [[nonagenarian]] and won both the [[Hugo Award|Hugo]] and [[Nebula Award]]s during the last decade of his life, by far the oldest writer to win those awards.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt061114"/&gt;

In his later years, he would also criticize attempts to write "serious" science fiction:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/interviews/williamson54interview.htm Science Fiction Studies - An Interview with Jack Williamson]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Maybe because of my own background of writing commercial SF for so many years, I have a great deal of respect for good craftsmanship of the sort that commercial writers must develop. The labels you hear so much of—"commercial," "serious writer," "mainstream," "hack," "New Wave," "experimental"—are usually very misleading.
 
In my own field, Ed Hamilton and Hank Kuttner and more recently [[Bob Silverberg]] are all writers who formed a fine command of the SF genre early in their careers and who later on used this to do work that is more consciously "literary" and hence more admired by critics. But certainly the writing they did earlier was deservedly popular among SF fandom, who evidently found these works "serious" enough to merit reading.

I am opposed, however, to literary tricks that tend towards obscurity or artificial difficulty, though I can see arguments for that kind of approach. My own experience as a teacher of writing confirms my sense that new authors with artistic ambitions may find themselves scorning too many of the old forms and patterns simply because they blindly associate them with hack work. The point is that these patterns and structures form the basic vocabulary through which all SF writers must speak. That's one reason I'm not completely sympathetic with contemporary writers like Silverberg and [[Chip Delany]] and [[Tom Disch]], who are clearly aiming to get themselves recognized as "serious" or mainstream authors.}}

== Academic career ==

Williamson received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Master of Arts]] degrees in [[English studies|English]] in the 1950s from [[Eastern New Mexico University]] (ENMU) in [[Portales, New Mexico|Portales]] (near the Texas panhandle), joining the faculty of that university in 1960. He remained affiliated with the school for the rest of his life. In the late 1990s, he established a permanent trust to fund the publication of ''El Portal'', ENMU's journal of literature and art.&lt;ref name="El Portal"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.enmu.edu/academics/williamson/el-portal.shtml | title=Jack Williamson: El Portal | publisher=Eastern New Mexico University | accessdate=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, he made a sizable donation of books and original manuscripts to ENMU's library, which resulted in the formation of a Special Collections department; the library now is home to the Jack Williamson Science Fiction Library, which ENMU's website describes as "one of the top science fiction collections in the world".&lt;ref&gt;[https://my.enmu.edu/web/golden-library/special-collections/jack-williamson-science-fiction "Jack Williamson Science Fiction Library"]. Golden Library Special Collections. Eastern New Mexico University (ENMU). Retrieved 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Williamson hosted the ''Jack Williamson Lectureship Series'', an annual lectureship where Guests of Honor and other noted authors give lectures, read from their works, and participate in lively panel discussions on a variety of topics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enmu.edu/academics/colleges-departments/college-liberal-arts-sciences/department-languages-literature/special-programs/jack-williamson-lectureship Jack Williamson Lectureship]&lt;/ref&gt; The lectureship is still celebrated at ENMU each year. The Jack Williamson Liberal Arts building houses the Languages &amp; Literature, Mathematical Sciences, History, Religion &amp; Social Sciences, and Psychology &amp; Political Science Departments of the university, as well as the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Dean's Office.

Williamson completed his [[Ph.D.]] in English literature at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], focused on [[H.G. Wells]]' earlier works, demonstrating that Wells was not the naive optimist that many believed him to be. In the field of science, Jack Williamson coined the word [[terraforming]] in a science-fiction story published in 1942 in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/125 | title=Science Fiction Citations: terraforming |publisher=Unknown (''jessesword.com'') | accessdate=2006-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later years ==

The [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] named Williamson its second [[SFWA Grand Master|Grand Master of Science Fiction]] after Robert Heinlein, presented 1976.&lt;ref name=SFAwards/&gt;&lt;ref name=SFWA/&gt;

After retiring from teaching full-time in 1977, Williamson spent some time concentrating on his writing, but after being named Professor Emeritus by ENMU, he was coaxed back to co-teach two evening classes, "Creative Writing" and "Fantasy and Science Fiction" (he pioneered the latter at ENMU during his full-time professorship days). Williamson continued to co-teach these two classes into the 21st century. After he made a large donation of original manuscripts and rare books from his personal collection to the ENMU library, a special collections area was created to house these and it was named the "Jack Williamson Special Collection".

In 1994 Williamson received a [[World Fantasy Award]] for Lifetime Achievement.&lt;ref name=SFAwards/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=World Fantasy Convention |title=Award Winners and Nominees |url=http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/awardslist.html/ |accessdate=2011-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201074405/http://worldfantasy.org/awards/awardslist.html |archivedate=December 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[EMP Museum#Science Fiction Hall of Fame|Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame]] inducted Williamson in 1996, its inaugural class of two deceased and two living persons.&lt;ref name=SFAwards/&gt;&lt;ref name=sfhof-old/&gt;

The [[Horror Writers Association]] conferred its [[Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement]] in 1998&lt;!--officially dated 1997, don't know whether he attended the 1998 ceremony--&gt;&lt;ref name=HWA/&gt; and the [[World Horror Convention]] elected him [[World Horror Convention Grand Master Award|Grand Master]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=SFAwards/&gt; &lt;!-- 16/17th Stoker and 14th Grand Master if anyone's counting--&gt;

In November 2006, Williamson died at his home in [[Portales, New Mexico]] at age 98.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, Karl (November 11, 2006). [http://www.pntonline.com/news/williamson_9214___article.html/fiction_enmu.html "Sci-fi legend Williamson dies"]. ''Portales News-Tribune''. Retrieved 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his age, he had made an appearance at the Spring 2006 ''Jack Williamson Lectureship'' and published a 320-page novel, ''The Stonehenge Gate'', in 2005.

== Legion of Space series ==

While attending a [[Great Books]] course, Williamson learned that [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]] had created one of his works by taking ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' of [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]] and pairing them with [[John Falstaff]] of [[William Shakespeare]]. Williamson took this idea into science fiction with ''The [[Legion of Space]]''.

Desperate for money, he searched for a quick source of income. While most pulps of the time were slow to pay, the recently restarted ''Astounding'' was an exception. However, they did not accept novels, so Williamson submitted three short stories and a novelette. Learning that they were also accepting novels for serialization, he sent in ''[[The Legion of Space]]'', which was published in six parts. It quickly became a genre favorite, and was quickly collected into a [[hardcover]].

The story takes place in an era when humans have colonized the [[Solar System]] but dare not go farther, as the first extra-solar expedition to [[Barnard's Star]] failed and the survivors came back as babbling, grotesque, diseased madmen. They spoke of a gigantic planet, populated by ferocious animals and the single city left of the evil "Medusae". The Medusae bear a vague resemblance to jellyfish, but are actually elephant-sized, four-eyed, flying beings with hundreds of tentacles. The Medusae cannot speak and communicate with one another via a microwave code.

The Falstaff character is named Giles Habibula. He was once a criminal, and can open any lock ever made. In his youth he was called Giles The Ghost. Jay Kalam (Commander of The Legion) and Hal Samdu are the names of the other two warriors. In this story, these warriors of the 30th Century battle the Medusae, the alien race from the lone planet of Barnard's Star. The Legion itself is the military and police force of the Solar System after the overthrow of an empire called the Purple Hall that once ruled all humans.

In this novel, renegade Purple pretenders ally themselves with the Medusae as a means to regain their empire. But the Medusae, who are totally unlike humans in all ways, turn on the Purples, seeking to destroy all humans and move to the Solar System, as their own world, far older than Earth, is finally spiraling back into Barnard's Star. One of the Purples, John Ulnar, supports the Legion from the start, and he is the fourth great warrior. His enemy is the Purple pretender Eric Ulnar, who sought the Medusae out in the first place, seeking to become the next Emperor of The Sun.

The Medusae conquered the Moon, set up their bases there, and went on to attempt conquest of the Solar System. The Medusae had for eons used a reddish, artificial [[greenhouse gas]] to keep their dying world from freezing. The Medusae learned from the first human expedition to their world that the gas rots human flesh, and the Medusae use it as a potent chemical weapon, attempting ecological destruction by means of projectiles fired from the Moon. Their vast spaceships also have very effective plasma weapons, very similar to those the [[Romulan]]s had in a Star Trek episode called ''[[Balance of Terror]]''.

The Legion works also featured a force field called AKKA which can erase from the Universe any matter, of any size, anywhere, even a star or a planet. AKKA was a weapon of mass destruction and the secret of it was entrusted to a series of [[women]]. AKKA was used in the past to overthrow the Purple tyranny. It was also used to wipe out most of the Medusae, though they had tried to steal the secret. When they were wiped out, the [[Moon]] where they had established their base was erased out of existence. At the end of the story, John Ulnar falls in love with the keeper of AKKA, Aladoree Anthar, and marries her. Aladoree Anthar is described as a young woman with lustrous brown hair and gray eyes, beautiful as a [[goddess]].

Williamson next wrote ''[[The Cometeers]]'' which takes place twenty years after ''The Legion of Space'' in which the same characters battle another alien race, this one of different origin.

In this second tale, they fight [[The Cometeers]] who are an alien race of energy beings controlling a "comet" which is really a giant force field containing a swarm of planets populated by their slaves. The [[slave]] races are of flesh and blood, but none are remotely similar to humans. The Cometeers cannot be destroyed by AKKA, as they are incorporeal from the Universe's point of view and exist for the most part in an alternate reality. The ruling Cometeers feed on their slaves and literally absorb their souls, leaving disgusting, dying hulks in their wake. It is said that they do so, as they were once fleshly entities themselves of various species. Hence, the ruling Cometeers keep other intelligent beings as slaves and "cattle". They fear AKKA, though, as it can erase all their possessions.

They are defeated by the skills of Giles Habibula. Giles broke into a secret chamber guarded by complex locks and force fields that the incorporeal Cometeers could not penetrate. In it the ruler of the Cometeers had kept its own weapon of mass destruction, one that would cause the Cometeers to disintegrate. The ruling Cometeer kept this weapon to enforce its rule over the others of its kind. Once the Cometeers were destroyed, their slaves were ordered by the Legion to take the comet and leave the Solar System, and never return.

Another novel, ''[[One Against the Legion]]'', tells of a Purple pretender who sets up a robotic base on a world over seventy light years from Earth, and tries to conquer the Solar System via matter [[Teleportation|transporter]] technology he has stolen. In this story [[robot]]s are outlawed, as they are in ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]''. The story also features Jay Kalam, lobbying to allow the New Cometeers to leave the Solar System in peace, as many people were demanding that AKKA be used to obliterate the departing swarm of planets once and for all.

In 1983, Williamson published a final Legion novel, ''The Queen of the Legion''. Giles Habibula reappears in this final novel, which is set after the disbanding of the Legion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2503">'''Konrad Wachsmann''' (May 16, 1901 in [[Frankfurt an der Oder]], [[Germany]] – November 25, 1980 in [[Los Angeles, California]]) was a German modernist architect. He is notable for his contribution to the [[mass production]] of building components.

Originally apprenticed as a cabinetmaker, Wachsmann studied at the arts-and-crafts schools of [[Berlin]] and [[Dresden]] and at the [[Berlin Academy of Arts]] (under the Expressionist architect [[Hans Poelzig]]). During the late 1920s he was chief architect for a manufacturer of timber buildings. He designed a summer house for [[Albert Einstein]], one of his lifelong friends, in [[Caputh, Brandenburg]]. He received the [[Prix de Rome]] from the [[German Academy in Rome]] in 1932.

In 1938 he emigrated to Paris and in 1941 to the United States, where he began a collaboration with [[Walter Gropius]] and developed the "Packaged House System", a design for a house which could be constructed in less than nine hours. Before the end of the [[Second World War]] he also developed a mobile aircraft hangar for the [[Atlas Aircraft Corporation]]. He would later design aircraft hangars for the [[U.S. Air Force]] in the 1960s.

In 1943 he assisted the war effort by helping the US air-force construct the [[German Village (Dugway proving ground)]], a simulation of German working class dwellings to be used to perfect fire-bombing techniques on German residential areas.

Wachsmann taught at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in [[Chicago]] from 1949 to 1964 and at the [[USC School of Architecture]] and the [[University of Southern California]] in [[Los Angeles]] from 1964 to 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{archINFORM|arch|3420}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the first recipient of the [[Cal Poly Pomona College of Environmental Design|Neutra Medal for Professional Excellence]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://archrecord.construction.com/features/critique/0810critique2.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried in his native [[Frankfurt an der Oder]].

'''''Matura''''' or its translated terms (''Mature'', ''Matur'', ''Maturita'', ''Maturità'', ''Maturität'', ''Maturité'', ''Mатура'') is a Latin name for the [[secondary education|secondary school]] exit [[exam]] or "maturity diploma" in various countries, including [[Albania]], [[Austria]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Kosovo]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Poland]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Ukraine]].

It is taken by young adults (usually aged from 17 to 20) at the end of their [[secondary education]], and generally must be passed in order to apply to a university or other institutions of [[higher education]]. ''Matura'' is a [[matriculation examination]] and can be compared to [[A-Level exams]] or ''[[Abitur]]''.

==Matura in Albania==
The official name is ''[[Matura Shtetërore]]'' (State Matura) which was introduced in 2006 by the Ministry of Education and Science replacing the school based ''Provimet e Pjekurisë'' (Maturity Examination). The ''Matura'' is the obligatory exam after finishing the ''gjimnaz'' (secondary school) to have one's education formally recognized and to become eligible to enroll in universities. Vocational schools are part of the ''Matura'' with a somehow different exam structure.The Matura is a centralized affair, conducted by the AVA (Central Evaluation Agency) which is in charge of selecting tasks, appointing national examiners, grading the sheets; the MoES (Ministry of Education and Sports) does the general administration and logistics of the nationwide exams. A second Agency (APRIAL) modeled after the UK University &amp; Colleges Admissions Service and the German Zentralstelle für die Vergabe von Studienplätzen is in charge for the admission to all Albanian (public so far) universities the applicants have applied for.

The two compulsory subjects to complete secondary education are Albanian language and literature and mathematics. For being admitted in a university students must take two additional exams which they choose themselves out of a list of eight subjects. The ''Matura'' exams take place in three separate days usually in the June/July period. The two first days are for each of the compulsory subjects; the third day is for the two additional exams. The basic marks range from 4 to 10; for university admissions though a more complex system called MeP (''Meritë-Preference'') is used. The State ''Matura'' and the MeP replaced an admission system conducted individually by each faculty/university which was seen as abusive.

==Matura in Austria==
{{update|section|date=May 2014}}
{{main article|Maturazeugnis}}
The official term for ''Matura'' in Austria is ''Reifeprüfung''. The document received after the successful completion of the written and oral exams is called Maturazeugnis.

In the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (AHS), which, as opposed to vocational schools, focuses on general education, the ''Matura'' consists of 3–4 written exams (referred to as ''Klausurarbeiten'', four to five hours each) to be taken on consecutive mornings (usually in May) and three to four oral exams to be taken on the same half-day about a month later (usually in June). All examinations are held at the school which the candidate last attended. Candidates have the option to write a scholarly paper (called ''Fachbereichsarbeit'') to be submitted at the beginning of the February preceding the final exams, which, if accepted, reduces the number of written exams by one, as the Fachbereichsarbeit is seen as an equivalent to a subject. This paper also needs to be defended in the corresponding oral exam.

The [[Grade (education)|grading system]] is the one universally used in Austrian schools: ''1'' (''sehr gut'') is excellent; ''2'' (''gut'') is good; ''3'' (''befriedigend'') is satisfactory; ''4'' (''genügend'') is passed and ''5'' (''nicht genügend'') means that the candidate has failed. In addition, a candidate's ''Maturazeugnis'' contains a formalized overall assessment: "''mit ausgezeichnetem Erfolg bestanden''" (pass with distinction: an average of 1.5 or better, no grade above 3), "''mit gutem Erfolg bestanden''" (pass with merit: an average of 2.0 or better, no grade above 3), "''bestanden''" (pass: no grade above 4); and '"''nicht bestanden''" (fail: at least one grade 5). Candidates who have failed may re-take their exams in September/October or February/March of the following school year.

Compulsory subjects for the written finals are always [[German language|German]] and [[Mathematics]], as well as a foreign language (usually [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Latin]] or sometimes [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]). Schools with a focus on science may require their students to take written finals in Biology or Physics.

The Austrian "Matura" used to be a decentralized affair, however since 2014 tests in the subjects:[[German language|German]] and [[Mathematics]], as well as a foreign language, are now centralized and held at the same day throughout Austria. There is only one external examiner: Candidates are set tasks both for their written and oral finals by their own (former) teachers. Formally, however, there is an examination board consisting of a candidate's teachers/examiners, the headmaster/headmistress and one external ''Vorsitzende(r)'' (head), usually a high-ranking school official or the head of another school. Oral exams are held publicly, but attendance by anyone other than a candidate's former schoolmates is not encouraged, and indeed rare.

It is possible for Austrians of all age groups to take the Matura. Adults from their twenties on are usually tutored at private institutions of adult education before taking their final tests, held separately before a regional examination board.

===The new centralized Matura (Zentralmatura)===
In 2015, the old Matura system was replaced by a new concept called ''Zentralmatura'' (centralized Matura). Graduation exams are now put together by ''bifie'' (an institution for research in education) and every graduation exam in Austria is now held on the same day. However, the teachers still correct all the exams themselves using an answer sheet that is included in the exam packages.

Students can still choose either four or three written exams (maths, German and one foreign language are compulsory; one additional language can also be chosen). When students choose three written exams, they will have to do another three oral exams. When choosing four written exams, only two additional oral exams are necessary.

What is also new is that every student now has to write a graduation paper called ''VWA'' (''Vorwissenschaftliche Arbeit'' or, literally translated, "Pre-scientific paper"). They can choose any topic they want, usually one year before graduating. When they have finished writing it (it should usually be 30.000 to 40.000 characters long), they have to present it to teachers and to the head (''Vorsitzende(r)''). The ''VWA'' is another grade in the ''Maturazeugnis''.

==Matura in Bulgaria==
In Bulgarian the matura is formally called ''държавен зрелостен изпит'' ([[Romanization of Bulgarian|Romanization]]: ''dǎrzhaven zrelosten izpit'', State Maturity Exam) or ДЗИ (DZI), but usually it is called simply ''матура''. There is only one compulsory subject – ''Bulgarian Language and Literature'', but students are required to select an additional subject of their choice; they can also request a third subject. Each exam consists of a single written test. The second subject must be chosen between:
* A foreign language (English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian)
* Mathematics
* Physics and astronomy
* Biology and health education
* Chemistry and environmental science
* History and civilization
* Geography and economics
* cycle of "Philosophy"

In 2008, according to the statistics on the web site of the Bulgarian Ministry of Education,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zamaturite.bg/news/76-013-zrelostnitsi-sa-podali-zayavlenie-za-yavyavane-na-darzhavni-zrelostni-izpiti.html zamaturite.bg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515205949/http://www.zamaturite.bg/news/76-013-zrelostnitsi-sa-podali-zayavlenie-za-yavyavane-na-darzhavni-zrelostni-izpiti.html |date=2008-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 76013 students have registered for the matura exams. Of them only 1748 students registered for a third, voluntary subject. Only 845 of them passed the third examination successfully. Because of the exam's challenging nature, students who request a third subject have a significant advantage in the university admissions process.

==Matura in Croatia==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
Nationwide leaving exams (''državna matura'') were introduced for [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] students in the school year 2009–2010. There are three compulsory subjects: [[Croatian language]] (or [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]] or [[Czech language|Czech]] for minorities), [[Mathematics]] and a foreign language ([[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[French language|French]]). Classical gymnasium students are also able to choose [[Latin]] or [[Ancient Greek]] instead of or in addition to a modern foreign language. The optional subjects will be [[Geography]], [[Biology]], [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]], [[Computer science]], [[History]], [[Music]], [[Visual arts]], [[Ethics]], [[Religious studies]], [[Philosophy]], [[Psychology]], [[Sociology]], [[Politics]] and [[Logics]].

The compulsory subjects are also available at a basic or extended level with 1 point of the extended level exam being worth 1.6 points of the basic level exam. Points of the basic level are converted into points of the extended level by dividing them by 1.6, so a student achieving 100/100 points in the basic exam, in the end will only be given 62.5 points (100/1.6). The extended level offers the possibility of achieving 100 points but carries the risk of gaining a lower result due to the elevated difficulty level.

The examinations are conducted by the National centre for external evaluation of education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncvvo.hr ncvvo.hr], ''Nacionalni centar za vanjsko vrednovanje obrazovanja''&lt;/ref&gt;

Students receive their exams in sealed opaque silver bags. They are required to open the bags (usually done by piercing the top of sealed bags with a pen and opening them like a bag of potato chips). Inside the bag, they get the exam booklet, piece of paper for marking the answers (only answers written on this piece of paper are graded), a concept booklet, a piece of paper with stickers which contain a [[barcode]] and need to be glued on everything of the aforementioned prior to the beginning of exam, including a new bag, in which everything is put and the bag sealed up at the end of the exam, with the bags then sent to NCVVO. The answers of the exams are publicly available two days after the exam. Examinees can complain on individual questions/answers after the early results are in, about a week before the final results. This resulted in 7 questions being cancelled in 2012 Croatian Matura exam, with examinees getting all the points due to possible multiple interpretations of the source text and the indiscrimination by the examinees shown by psychometric analysis.

Croatian Language exam has two parts: literature written exam and an essay. Students can choose whether to write the basic or extended level of the exam. The literature appearing in the exam changes annually; however, the list of works which can appear remains the same, and it consists of the following: Camus' [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]], Cesarić's Lirika, Gundulić's Dubravka, Ibsen's [[A Doll's House]], Krleža's [[The Glembays]], Matoš's Pjesme, Novak's Posljednji Stipančići and Sophocles' [[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]] for the basic level and Camus' Stranger, Dostoyevsky's [[Crime and Punishment]], Držić's Dundo Maroje, Flaubert's [[Madame Bovary]], Goethe's [[The Sorrows of Young Werther]], Kafka's [[The Metamorphosis]], Krleža's The Glembays and The Return of Filip Latinovicz, Marinković's Ruke, Nehajev's Bijeg, Poe's [[The Black Cat (short story)|The Black Cat]], Salinger's [[The Catcher in the Rye]], Sophocles' Antigone, Šimić's Preobraženja and Šoljan's Kratki izlet for the extended level, respectively.

The literature exam is 80 minutes long and is composed mostly of the multiple choice assignments, but also has a couple of matching questions assignments, whereas the written essay part of the exam is 160 minutes long and requires from 400 to 600 words.

The literature exam will take place in May and the essay exam will take place two days later.

Further enrollment into university programmes is conducted via Internet. Lists of students with right to enrollment are processed by the central computer for each university based on the results of the exams. The points gained in the exams are converted into points for enrollment. Each university sets its own criteria of valuing these exams depending on the area of science or art which is taught, for example, a student enrolling in a Philosophy programme will have 0% or 5% of points for enrollment extracted from his Mathematics exam, but up to 80% from Croatian so if the result of the Math test is excellent, but the Croatian test is bad, the student's chances are reduced because only 5% will be extrapolated from the excellent Math test and a large 80% percent from the slim result in Croatian, giving the student a lower sum of enrollment points. However, the same student may apply to a Mathematics programme and will be given points based on the very same exams, but a different percentage will be extrapolated, giving advantage to Mathematics. In the end the final 100% percent must be extrapolated from the exams, but the exams themselves are set by the universities. In general, the universities demand the three compulsory exams (Croatian, Math, Foreign language) to be passed (although can have 0% percent extrapolated as points for enrollment) along with one optional subject that is generally given higher attention (up to 70%). Each student has the right to attempt to enroll into a maximum of ten universities, and when chosen the preferred university (or universities) is deleted from the lists of the other 9 (or 8, etc.) thus allowing other students to move up these lists and achieve the right of enrollment in their preferred university.

==Maturita in the Czech Republic==
The official term for Matura in the Czech Republic is ''maturita'' or ''maturitní zkouška''. In 2010 the Czech Republic introduced a system of state exams which divided the previous system into two parts. The first is the state exam which consists of two compulsory subjects: ''Czech language and literature'' and either a [[foreign language]] (mostly [[English language|English]], but also [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[French language|French]]) or mathematics (the combination is chosen by students). The second part consists of Czech language and literature and minimum of two but usually of three school, so called "profile" subjects which vary between schools. Gymnázium (similar to grammar school) students usually choose from:
* [[Biology]]
* [[Chemistry]]
* Foreign language
* [[Geography]]
* [[History]]
* [[Information technology|Information Technologies]]
* [[Mathematics]]
* [[Physics]]
* [[Social science|Social Sciences]] (usually includes [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[law]], [[political science]], [[philosophy]] and [[international relations]])

The state part of the exam is supervised by CERMAT (formerly ''Centrum pro reformu maturitní zkoušky'', "Centre for Maturita Reform; now ''Centrum pro zjišťování výsledků vzdělávání'', "Centre for Detection of Education Results"), a state managed company. CERMAT issues final tests for the state part of the exam, documentation and practical tests, holds training for teachers who correct essays and supervise the students during the exams. The main part of the company is the tech centre, which is used for auto correcting the students exams. State exams are subject to continual improvement. Today the tests consist of four exams from which two are state organized and two school organized, in the future the state wants to add at least one more state exam and one more compulsory school exam.

In 2012 the state part of the ''maturita'' exam was split into two difficulty levels – students could choose between basic and advanced tests. This solution was found to be ineffective and was canceled the following year.

The Czech Republic also has a separate examination system called ''Národní srovnávací zkoušky'' ("National Comparative Test"), owned and managed by the private company Scio, s.r.o. which provides tests for all subjects. Some Czech universities recognize the results of these tests and students can be accepted based on these results, however, they still have to succeed in the ''maturita'' exam.

The examination itself is also divided between written and oral parts but not all subjects require both written and spoken input (for example math is formed by a written test only). Usually both the written and the oral part of the exam are set in late spring. The state part of the written exam is set to one day in which students in the whole country write identical tests, different tests are always issued on the day the exam takes place. The school (profile) part is always different and is based on requirements of the school which issues the test so it may be both written and spoken, but it can also be only one of the options.

The oral part of the ''maturita'' exam takes part in a classroom in which a commissioner must be present. The oral exam is divided into two 15 minute parts (except Czech language and literature where the preparation time is 20 minutes), first a student draws a number of his question and then begins 15 minutes of preparation often called ''potítko'' ("sweat lodge") after the first 15 minutes he is called in to the 15 minute oral exam. The commission is composed of the class teacher, commissioner and either a principal or a representative principal. The student is examined by the examiner and an assessor. The examiner and the assessor usually agree on a grade which should be assigned to the student and if not the commission takes a vote for the grade. Students can graduate with a grade better than 5 (grades are 1–5, where 1 is the best).

Exam duration, for both oral and written exams, as well as preparation time, can be longer for students with disabilities.

If students fail in one subject, they have the option to repeat the subject, if they fail more than one subject, then they have to repeat the complete set of exams including the written part. All students have a maximum of three attempts to succeed in this exam, if they fail to succeed they end secondary school without the ''maturita'' and are unable to apply for college or university. They still have a chance to do maturita exam on another secondary school in the future, but this mostly means that they should finish study on that another school in full length, e.g. 4 years.

==Matura in Hungary==
The official term for Matura in Hungary is érettségi (vizsga). This happens usually after 12 or 13 years of schooling. Each candidate who passes their final exams receives a document that contains their grades and which formally enables them to go to a university.

Hungarian students have to take an exam of ''Hungarian literature and grammar'', ''Mathematics'', ''History'', one ''foreign language'' and one subject of the ''student's choice'' (this can be anything that they have learned before for at least 2 years).

In Hungary, the "examination of maturity" assesses knowledge in five grades: excellent (5), good (4), medium (3), pass (2), and fail (1). The UK GCE Advanced Level grade equivalent is: AAA or AAB (5), ABB or BBB (4), and BBC or BCC (3).

==Maturità in Italy==
In [[Italy]] the examination is commonly called ''(Esame di) Maturità'' ('maturity exam') or just ''Esame di Stato'' ('state exam'), but the official name is ''Esame di Stato conclusivo del corso di studio di istruzione secondaria superiore'' ('Final state exam of the upper secondary cycle of studies'). This is the final exam for secondary school, which students are normally required to pass in order to be admitted to colleges and universities.

In Italy, the maturità is informally regarded as a [[rite of passage]] from adolescence to adulthood{{citation needed|reason=subjective opinion|date=February 2016}}, after which secondary school graduates get ready for higher education and/or a job.

Examination boards are composed of three internal teachers belonging to the student's school, three external teachers and an external president of the board. Every year the [[Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (Italy)|Ministry of Education]] decides which subjects will be assigned to external teachers; these are different depending on the type of school.

The exam is divided into written and oral sections. The written section consists of three tests. The first one is Italian and is identical nationwide: students are required to write an essay, an article on a given topic, but they can also choose to analyse and comment on a text (usually a poem). The second test changes according to the type of school the student attended, so it can be on a wide variety of different subjects, such as [[Pedagogy]] and [[Psychology]], [[Mathematics]], Foreign Language, [[Latin]], and [[Ancient Greek]]. It is identical nationwide for schools of the same type. The subject is decided by the Ministry a few months before the exam: it is almost always the same for some types of school (for example Mathematics for [[liceo scientifico]]) and it is chosen among the "written" subjects for other schools (for example, it is chosen between Latin and Ancient Greek for [[liceo classico]] or one of the three different Foreign Languages studied, included English, in [[liceo linguistico]]). Finally, the third test is about a maximum of five selected subjects of the last year, and it is written by every single examining commission. The student doesn't know before which subjects are in the text. Starting the school year 2018-2019 the third test will be abolished leaving the first and the second written tests and the oral test. The interview section is to assess that the student has really reached a personal and intellectual maturity concerning the various subjects of his or her last school year; the examining commission is supposed to ask about every subject, but has got to make sure that the candidate is also able to discuss about a variety of themes explaining and justifying his or her opinion; also, in recent years has become customary for each student to prepare a short essay (''tesina'') on a free topic, intended to showcase the ability to cover different sides of the topic using extensively the notions and methods learnt in school.

The scoring has been changed various times since 1969:
*1969–1998: pass 36, maximum 60
*1999–2006: pass 60, maximum 100 (45&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;35&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;20)
*2007-2008: pass 60, maximum 100 ''cum laude''
*2009–2018: pass 60, maximum 100 ''cum laude'' (45&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;30&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;25)
*2019: pass 60, maximum 100 ''cum laude'' (40&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;20&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;40)

The score is calculated by adding up:
* Credits: up to 25 points from school grades; the top score is assigned to students who have an average above 9 out of 10. Starting the school year 2018-2019 up to 40 points.
* Written exam: the pass mark is of 30 points out of 45. The candidate sits 3 written tests. For each one the passing mark is 10 points out of 15. Starting the school year 2018-2019 up to 40 points. The candidate sits 2 written tests. For each one up to 20 points.
* Oral exam: the passing mark is 20 points out of 30. Starting the school year 2018-2019 up to 20 points.
* Bonus: an extra 5 points can be awarded to the candidate by the examining commission. In order to get this bonus, candidates must have received at least 15 credits and the sum of their oral and written exams must be at least 70.

The students who are able to reach 100 points without needing a bonus can be awarded the "lode" (cum laude) praise by the examination board.

==Matura in Kosovo==
In [[Kosovo]] Testi i Maturës Shtetërore/Državni maturski ispit (the State Mature Exam) is mandatory for every high school student in order to get the high school certificate. Without passing the Matura Exam, one cannot apply to any university within Kosovo. It has different number of questions per subject, depending on the High School's profile.

It is held every year in June, and with the latest reforms, there are two tests, on two different days:

The First one has 100 questions, and has questions about general subjects;

The Second one has 100 questions, and has professional subjects questions.

The tests are held on the same day for every school, usually in the middle of June. There is also a similar test for the Primary School pupils as well, called Testi i Semi-Maturës Shtetërore/Državni malomaturski ispit (State Semi-Matura Exam) which has 100 questions, and is mandatory for every pupil who will continue to High School.
The Tests are provided by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, and are in Albanian, Serbian, Turkish and Bosniak, who make the ethnical groups of Kosovo.

==Matura in Macedonia==
In [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] the matura is obligatory for every high school student who is planning on going to college afterwards. It is called ''државна матура'' ("state matura") or simply ''матура'' ("matura"). Every student who intends to pass the matura is required to complete four exams:
* Native language (either [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]] or [[Turkish language|Turkish]]): demonstrating knowledge of literature and grammar of the four-year high school studying, as well as essay writing.
* [[Mathematics]]/[[foreign language]]: students choose whether they will take mathematics (basic or advanced level) or a foreign language (typically English, German, French or Russian).
* two subjects by student's choice (subjects available, beside the aforementioned ones, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Geography, Sociology, Informatics, Latin, Ancient Greek, Art, Music, Aesthetics, History, Philosophy and Business)
* a project task

==Matura in Poland==
[[File:HenrykZieliński-swiadectwo dojrzalosci-1938.jpg|thumb|210px|A 1938 ''matura'' certificate (titled ''świadectwo dojrzałości'', "certificate of maturity")]]
[[File:Swiadectwo maturalne.png|thumb|210px|A 2008 ''matura'' certificate]]

In the [[Polish education system]], the exam is officially called ''egzamin maturalny'', but it is commonly known as ''matura''. It is taken on completion of high school, in May (with additional dates in June, and retakes available in August). The exam is not compulsory, although Polish students must pass it in order to be able to apply for [[higher education]] courses in Poland and elsewhere.

A major reform of the exam (originally enacted in 1999, although its introduction was delayed) came into effect as from 2005. Under the old system (popularly called ''stara matura'') candidates' performance was assessed solely by teachers from their own schools. In the new system ''(nowa matura)'' written work is assessed by independent examiners. This is considered to make the results more objective, and as a result Polish higher education institutions no longer run entrance exams (as they did under the old system), but base their admissions primarily on ''matura'' results.

As of 2015, every student taking the ''matura'' takes three compulsory exams at "basic level" ''(poziom podstawowy)'' in:
*[[Polish language]] (including knowledge of Polish and European literature)
*A selected modern language ([[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Russian language|Russian]])
*[[Mathematics]]
as well as at least one subject at "extended level" ''(poziom rozszerzony)''. These include the above as well as [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[geography]], [[social studies]], [[history]], [[history of art]], [[history of music]], [[information technology]], [[physics]] and [[astronomy]], [[Latin]] and Ancient History, [[philosophy]], another modern language, languages of [[ethnic group]]s in Poland ([[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]), and the [[Kashubian language]].

Exams in Polish language and other languages include both a written paper and an oral examination.

Results are currently expressed as percentages. To pass the ''matura'' it is necessary to score at least 30% in each of the three compulsory exams. The results of the additional exams do not affect whether a student passes, but are usually a factor when applying for higher education places. Since the year 2015 the results are expressed not only as percentages, but are also accompanied by [[Percentile|percentiles]] on the Matura certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | language = Polish
 | trans-title = About the "new" Matura exam
 | access-date = 2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aims to make comparisons between Matura scores from different years fairer.

The exams are conducted by the Central Examination Board ''(Centralna Komisja Egzaminacyjna; CKE)'' [http://www.cke.edu.pl/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=291&amp;Itemid=163/], assisted by a number of Regional Examination Boards ''(Okręgowa Komisja Egzaminacyjna; OKE)''. The same bodies also conduct tests for pupils completing primary school, and examinations at the end of middle school ''([[gimnazjum]])''.

A custom associated with the ''matura'' is the ''[[studniówka]]'', a ball organized for students and their teachers approximately one hundred days before the examinations begin. Following a popular superstition, candidates (particularly female ones) wear red underwear at the ball, and then wear the same items for the exam itself, to bring luck.

==Matura in Slovakia==
In Slovakia the matura is formally called ''Maturitná skúška''. It consists of several parts. The first "written" part is usually held in March. In this part every student has to undergo tests from the Slovak language and literature, foreign language (English, German, French, Russian or Spanish) and math (only if chosen by student). There are also tests from Ukrainian or Hungarian language for students of schools with these as teaching languages. These tests are prepared and electronically assessed by NÚCEM (Národný ústav certifikovaných meraní vzdelávania, eng. National Institute for Certified Educational Measurements). This part also includes writing an essay in every language student is tested in. Topics are prepared by NÚCEM, but essays are assessed by student's school. Ranges of essays are 1.5 – 3 pages (A4 format) in Slovak language and 160 – 180 words for level B1, 200 – 220 for B2 level or 260 – 320 words for C1 level of foreign language tests. There are only two compulsory subjects – ''Slovak language and literature'' and a [[foreign language]]. Gymnázium (similar to grammar school) students have to choose at least two additional subjects such as:
* Mathematics
* Physics
* Biology
* Chemistry
* History
* Geography
* Philosophy
* Arts and cultures
* Economics
* Informatics and IT
* Social Sciences (usually includes psychology, sociology, economics, law, political science, philosophy and international relations)

Exam from these additional subjets consists only of oral part usually held in May. One exception is Mathematics which consists of both written and oral parts. Students can also choose another foreign language as additional subject.

The students can choose a level of matura from the foreign language according to [[CEFR]] – B1 (intermediate) or B2 (upper intermediate). Students of gymnázium school have to choose at least one foreign language at level B2. Students of linguist-specialized (bilingual) gymnázium school have to pass test from the foreign language at level C1 (English level of bachelor's degree). In the past, if the student had got an additional certificate from foreign language (IELTS, TOEFL, CAE, FCE), at least at level B1, he/she did not need to pass the foreign language exam. However, this was cancelled in 2014 and now all secondary education students are required to pass the foreign language exam as a part of their matura.

==Matura in Slovenia==
In [[Education in Slovenia|Slovenia]], the ''splošna matura'' (college-prep leaving exam) is an obligatory exam after finishing ''gimnazija'' (upper secondary school) to have one's education formally recognised and to become eligible to enroll in colleges and universities. It should not be confused with the ''poklicna matura'' (vocational leaving exam), which is the final examination at vocational schools and does not lead to university studies. Since there is no entrance examination at the vast majority of Slovenian universities programmes (notable exceptions are only art and music programmes, architecture studies and sports studies), the score on this exam is the main criterion for admission (grades achieved during studies also play a small part).

It consists of three compulsory and two elective subjects. One must take [[Slovene language|Slovene]] ([[Italian language|Italian]] or [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] for members of minorities), [[Mathematics]] and one foreign language (usually [[English language|English]], although [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Italian language|Italian]] are provided, as well). The elective subjects can be chosen among all the other subjects, one has encountered during his schooling ([[Greek language]], [[Latin language]], [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]], [[Biology]], [[Geography]], [[History]] or [[History of Art]], [[Philosophy]] or [[Sociology]] or [[Psychology]], [[Music]] or [[Graphic Arts]], [[History of drama]], [[Economics]], [[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]], [[Biotechnology]], [[Electrotechnics]], [[Mechanics]], [[Materials Science]]). It is possible to choose the second foreign language as one of the elective subjects.

The leaving exam is a centralised affair, conducted by the  National Examination Centre,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ric.si/ ric.si]&lt;/ref&gt; which is in charge of selecting tasks, appointing national examiners, grading the sheets and sending the scores to all Slovenian universities the applicants have applied for.

Grading is somewhat complicated, as there exist three different criteria for different sets of subjects.

*Slovene is unique and is graded on scale of 1 to 8.
*It is possible to take mathematics and all foreign languages on a higher or basic level. Basic marks range from 1 to 5, whereas marks for the higher level range from 1 to 8. The examinee may only take up to two subjects on the higher level (two foreign languages, or mathematics and one foreign language).
*All other subjects are graded from 1 to 5.

The only failing score is 1; all other scores are passes.

It is also possible to pass the exam with grade 1 in one subject, however, two conditions must be met:
*The examinee has achieved at least 80% of the points required for grade 2 on a basic level in this subject, and
*The examinee received at least grade 2 in all other subjects, whereof
**At least 2 subjects have received grade 3 or higher (if the subject passed with grade 1 is a compulsory subject), or
**At least 1 subject has received grade 3 or higher (if the subject passed with grade 1 is an elective subject).

Thus, it is possible to gain from 10 to 34 points. Students who have achieved 30 or more points are awarded leaving exam diplomas [[cum laude]] (Slovene: ''zlata matura'' 'golden leaving exam') and are usually congratulated by the president of Slovenia at a festive reception in September.

Structure of particular exams:
* ''Mother tongue – Slovene (Hungarian or Italian for members of minorities respectively)''
** Sheet 1: Students write an essay (1000 words) on the two pieces of literature (in 2010: ''[[Prišleki]]'' by [[Lojze Kovačič]], ''[[Dreams of My Russian Summers]]'' by [[Andreï Makine]]; in 2011: ''[[Ločil bom peno od valov]]'' by [[Feri Lainšček]] and ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' by [[Gustave Flaubert]]). The national committee for Slovene (''Državna predmetna komisija za splošno maturo za slovenščino'') publishes the titles of the two works the examinees are expected to know one year ahead. This sheet represents 50% of the final score.
** Sheet 2: Students are given an unknown text from a newspaper, magazine etc., followed by some 30 tasks, testing their ability to read, interpret, and understand the text. Also, students' knowledge of [[Slovene grammar]], word-formation and spelling is tested. The last task is to form a certain type of text, being an invitation, a letter of complaint, biography etc. This sheet represents 30% of the final mark.
** Oral exam: A candidate is given three questions. The first two are related to the world literature, whereas the third asks about the historical development of literary Slovene from its beginnings in the year 1551 to the present. It is possible to gain 20%.

The final score is expressed in points from 1 (failure) to 8 (the highest standard of knowledge).
*Mathematics
It is possible to take this subject on a higher or basic level.
** Sheet 1: Students are given approximately ten tasks, evaluating their knowledge of different fields in mathematics. This sheet accounts for 53.3% (on a higher level) or 80% (on a basic level).
** Sheet 2 (only on a higher level): Students are given three more difficult tasks. This sheet is worth 26.7%.
** Oral exam: An examinee is given three questions, testing their ability to prove certain theorems or explain some mathematical axioms and definitions.

The final score is expressed in points from 1 (failure) to 5 (the highest mark on a basic level) or 8 (the highest mark on a higher level).
*Foreign languages
*Chemistry
*Information technology, Computer science (separate)
*Physics
*Geography
*History
*Sociology, Philosophy, Psychology

The nationwide leaving exam was reintroduced in Slovenia in 1994, after all upper secondary schools had been suspended in the 1980s and reopened in 1991. The exam is conducted in two terms, the first one being in spring (May/June) and the second one in autumn (September). Due to the university admittance procedure, of which the first call concludes in July, applicants passing the exam in September have usually a very limited choice of university programmes for that year.

There has been a heated debate lately whether this leaving exam should once again be completely abolished. As of January 2007, the position of the Ministry of Education remains that the ''matura'' will still be the only way of completing secondary education. The decision on whether universities should introduce entrance examinations and reduce the importance of the leaving exam to a mere pass/fail has not been made yet.

==Matura in Switzerland==

===Gymnasiale Matura, Maturité gymnasiale, Maturità liceale===
In [[Education in Switzerland|Switzerland's education system]], secondary school has several tiers oriented towards different professional tracks. The [[Mittelschule|gymnasium]], leading to the Matura graduation, is the highest tier, offering broad and thorough academic foundations to prepare its students for direct entry to university. Approximately 20% of youth attain the Matura every year, although this figure varies among the different cantons, which are in charge of (upper) secondary education. The gymnasial Matura is required and sufficient (except for medicine, where the number of students is restricted) for Swiss students to study at a university or a federal institute of technology irrespective of their subject choice.&lt;ref name=SERIMatur&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbfi.admin.ch/themen/01366/01379/index.html?lang=de |title=Maturität |publisher=Swiss Federal State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation, SERI |location=Berne, Switzerland |date=17 March 2015 |language=German, French, Italian |type=official site |accessdate=2015-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425193913/http://www.sbfi.admin.ch/themen/01366/01379/index.html?lang=de |archivedate=25 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific requirements for a Matura graduation vary slightly among the cantons. In general they involve two parts: The grades of the last school year and standardized Matura exams at the end of 12th or 13th grade, depending on the [[Canton (country subdivision)|canton]]. Also a scientific Matura paper of about 25 pages has to be executed. Grades attained in classes during the last school year and at the exams, as well as the Matura paper contribute equally to the final grade. With a revision in 2007, among others an appreciation of science subjects were carried out by individual graduation of biology, physics and chemistry, increasing the proportion of teaching mathematics and natural science subjects as well as the introduction of computer science as a supplementary subject.&lt;ref name=SERIMatur/&gt;

6 is the best grade, 1 is the lowest. The required average grade to attain Matura is 4. In order to pass, all grades below 4 have to be compensated by better grades in double, and no more than four grades lower than 4 are allowed.&lt;ref name=SR41311&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19950018/index.html |title=SR 413.11 Verordnung über die Anerkennung von gymnasialen Maturitätsausweisen (MAV/ORM) |publisher=Swiss Federal State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation, SERI |location=Berne, Switzerland |date=1 January 2013 |language=German, French, Italian |type=official site |accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cantons are responsible for the organisation of the final tests. Exams include a series of oral and written tests. Tests are typically administered by a team consisting of a teacher who was involved in the student's classes and an independent expert. This cantonal Matura exam is recognised in the whole country but there is no single standardised test on a national level in contrary to what exists in France, for instance where the same test with the same questions and the same themes is passed by all students on the same day.

The gymnasial Matura subjects by federal ordinance (''MAV/ORM'', ''SR 413.11'') are (''Art. 9''):&lt;ref name=SR41311/&gt;

The Matura consists of:
# all 10 or 11 (depends on the canton) '''basic subjects'''
# one '''major subject'''
# one '''additional subject'''
# '''Matura paper''', evaluated by work process, written paper, and oral presentation
* '''Basic subjects''' are:
# a ''first National Language'', such as [[French language|French]], [[Swiss Standard German|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], or [[Romansh language|Romansh]] (only in canton of [[Grisons]]); including its related [[literature]]
# a ''second National Language''
# a ''third language'': either a third National Language, or [[English language|English]], or a classic language, either [[Latin]] or [[Ancient Greek]]
# [[Mathematics]]
# [[Biology]]
# [[Chemistry]]
# [[Physics]]
# [[History]]
# [[Geography]]
# [[Visual Arts]] or [[Music]]
# ''Cantons (such as [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]]) may voluntarily provide an additional basic subject:'' [[Philosophy]]
* The '''major subject''' is selected from:
** ''Classic Languages'' (Latin and/or Ancient Greek)
** A ''Modern Language'' (a third national language, English, [[Spanish language|Spanish]], or [[Russian language|Russian]])
** Physics and Applied Mathematics
** Biology and Chemistry
** [[Economics]] and [[Law]]
** [[Philosophy]], [[Education]], [[Psychology]]
** Visual Arts
** Music
* The '''additional subject''' is selected from (must not be equal to major subject):
** Physics
** Chemistry
** Biology
** Applied Mathematics
** [[Informatics]] (Computer Science)
** History
** Geography
** Philosophy
** Religion
** Economics and Law
** Education/Psychology
** Visual Arts (excluded, if major subject is either Visual Arts or Music)
** Music (excluded, if major subject is either Visual Arts or Music)
** Sports (excluded, if major subject is either Visual Arts or Music)

The distribution of teaching hours among the subjects must adhere to the following scheme:
* For basic subjects:
** Languages (first, second, and third): 30–40%
** Mathematics and Natural Sciences (Physics, Chemistry and Biology): 25–35%
** Human and Social Sciences (History, Geography, Introduction in Economics and Law, possibly also Philosophy): 10–20%
** Arts (Visual Arts and/or Music): 5–10%
* For major and additional subjects, and Matura paper: 15–25%

Matura exams are executed on at least five of the following subjects (all written exams and optionally also oral):
# The first language
# A second National (or Cantonal) Language
# Mathematics
# the major subject
# ''another subject chosen by cantonal preferences''

A ''Federal Matura'' exists on a national level, though each ''Cantonal Matura'' is also inherently approved on a federal level. The Federal Matura&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbfi.admin.ch/themen/01366/01379/01626/index.html?lang=de |title=Schweizerische Maturitätsprüfung |publisher=Swiss Federal State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation, SERI |location=Berne, Switzerland |date=17 March 2015 |language=German, French, Italian |type=official site |accessdate=2015-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428074034/http://www.sbfi.admin.ch/themen/01366/01379/01626/index.html?lang=de |archivedate=28 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is organised by the [[State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation]] (SERI) twice a year in each linguistical region.

An additional exam called ''Latinum Helveticum'', also organised by the [[State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbfi.admin.ch/themen/01366/01379/01628/index.html?lang=de |title=Ergänzungsprüfung 'Latinum Helveticum' |publisher=Swiss Federal State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation, SERI |location=Berne, Switzerland |date=17 March 2015 |language=German, French, Italian |type=official site |accessdate=2015-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506051742/http://www.sbfi.admin.ch/themen/01366/01379/01628/index.html?lang=de |archivedate=6 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; allows the student to study a field at a university that requires [[Latin]] knowledges.

===Fachmatura / Maturité de culture générale / Maturità specializzata / Maturita media spezialisada===
The Fachmatura/Maturité de culture générale/Maturità specializzata/Maturita media spezialisada is a relatively new program (success rates were first published in 2008).  The exam is taken after completion of a [[Mittleschule|Fachmittelschule]] and it opens up certain technical college courses.  The program requires successful completion of general education subjects as well as one year of additional training in one or two professional fields and writing a matura paper.  The following fields may be chosen from; health, social work, science, communication and information, music/dance/theater, art and design and education.&lt;ref name=BFS/&gt;

===Berufsmatura / Maturité professionelle / Maturità professionale===
The advanced vocational certificate (Berufsmatura/Maturité professionelle/Maturità professionale) allows access to the [[Fachhochschule]] or University of Applied Sciences and indicated both successful completion of the vocational program as well as additional advanced studies.  It can be earned either during the vocation course or after course completion.  Originally there were six specialties in which the certificate could be earned.  Following the new vocational regulations of May 2015 there are now five orientations with two variants for each of the first three; "Technology, Architecture and Life Sciences", "Economics and Services", "Health and Welfare", "Art and Design", and "Nature, Agriculture and Food Services".&lt;ref name=BFS&gt;[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/15/17/blank/01.informations.405102.4015.html Bildungssystem Schweiz - Indikatoren, Abschlüsse und Kompetenzen - Maturitätsquote] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820154633/http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/15/17/blank/01.informations.405102.4015.html |date=2016-08-20 }} {{de icon}} accessed 9 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Matura in the Ukrainian Diaspora==
Matura is common in Ukrainian secondary education in the [[Ukrainian diaspora]], specifically in the [[Ukrainian American|United States]] and [[Ukrainian Canadian|Canada]]. It is usually run by Saturday Ukrainian Education schools sponsored by the [[Ukrainian Congress Committee of America]], which regulates and writes the various tests. Children of Ukrainian descent are tested on Saturdays during a month-long period toward the end of their junior or senior year of [[high school]] on their knowledge of [[Ukrainian language]], [[Geography of Ukraine|geography]], [[History of Ukraine|history]], [[Ukrainian Culture|culture]], and [[Ukrainian Literature|literature]]. Often, these tests are approved by local governments' accreditation standards as a [[language school|second-language school]] which can, under certain circumstances, be applied to other schools.

The '''Murasu Archive''' is a collection of [[cuneiform]] tablets, excavated between 1888 and 1900, from the ruins of [[Nippur]] in central [[Babylonia]]. Named after the chief member of a single family, the Murasu Archive is a collection of business records that spans four generations. Assembled during the reigns of the Persian kings [[Artaxerxes I]], [[Darius II]], and [[Artaxerxes II]], the Murasu Archive provides the largest and most illuminating view into the business activities and conditions of Persian-ruled Babylonia during the last hundred and fifty years of the [[Achaemenid]] kingship.

== Excavation and discovery ==

In a series of excavations directed by [[John Henry Haynes]], the Murasu Archive was discovered six meters under a mound on the floor of a small room. The original collection comprised 330 whole tablets, 400 or more damaged tablets and fragments, and 20 small clay tags with seal impressions.&lt;ref&gt;Stolper, 1&lt;/ref&gt; After the original discovery, a portion of the tablets was shipped to [[Istanbul]] for analysis, where [[Hermann Vollrat Hilprecht]] first identified the texts as records of a late Babylonian business house called “Murasu Sons of Nippur”.&lt;ref&gt;Stolper, 1&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the Murasu Archive was scattered around the world, to museums and private collections in [[London]], Istanbul, [[Philadelphia]], [[Jena]], and [[California]].

== Contents of the tablets ==
The Murasu Archive comprises business records regarding legal issues, loans, rents, transactions, trips to various capital cities, and the use of agents and subordinates to manage affairs. In essence, the Murasu Archive was the business repository of the Murasu firm - a business house dealing mainly with the management of [[agriculture]].
The Murasu firm would lease land and water from its owners, farm the land to produce crops, pay rents and taxes to the owners, and even sublet the leased lands to tenants, who would work the land with livestock, seeds, and equipment provided by the firm. In addition, the Murasu firm converted the produce from the lands they managed into [[Silver standard|specie—silver]].,&lt;ref&gt;Stolper, 28&lt;/ref&gt; which was lent on the basis of real security, or collateral.

== Context of greater socio-economic and political setting ==
The Murasu firm provides a greater insight into the economic strength and stability of the Persian-ruled provinces. [[Marc Van De Mieroop]] argues that, through such business practices as the Murasu firm, the Persians were able to draw upon their resources throughout their provinces and vassal states to pull together enormous armies with which to intimidate and conquer their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Van De Mierroop, Marc (2007). A history of the ancient Near East, ca 3000-323 B.C. (2 ed.). Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishing. p. 78. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-4911-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptions of the Persians by Greek writers such as [[Herodotus]] show how the armies and practices of the Persians left a very real impression on the western world and shape the classical western view of Asia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7135">In [[education]], '''narrative evaluation''' is a form of performance measurement and feedback which can be used as an alternative or supplement to [[grade (education)|grading]].  Narrative evaluations generally consist of several paragraphs of written text about a student's individual performance and course work. The style and form of narrative evaluations vary significantly among the educational institutions using them, and they are sometimes combined with other performance metrics, including [[Grading in the United States|letter and number grades]] and pass/fail designations.

The '''National Security Education Program''' ('''NSEP''') is a [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] initiative to enhance the national security of the U.S. by  increasing the national capacity to understand and interact effectively with foreign cultures and languages.  NSEP oversees nine critical initiatives designed to attract, recruit, and train a future national security workforce.  Some funding comes in exchange for a commitment to U.S. federal government service upon completion of academic study. NSEP is aimed at building a wider pool of Americans with [[foreign language]] and international skills by involving participants in "innovative, intensive, and long-term programs designed to provide meaningful opportunities to gain significant competencies in these [[Linguistic competence|languages]] and [[Cultural competence|cultures]]."  &lt;ref&gt;  "Mission and objectives" [http://www.nsep.gov/about/mission/] &lt;/ref&gt;

NSEP was established by the National Security Education Act. Oversight for NSEP is provided by the '''National Security Education Board''' ('''NSEB'''), which meets "to review and make recommendations based on program mission and objectives." The NSEB consists of a 13-member board including representatives from seven Cabinet-level departments.  Six non-federal members, appointed by the President also serve on the NSEB. The Office of the [[Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness]] (OSD/P&amp;R) provides policy oversight to NSEP. 

On February 6, 2012, the Defense Language Office and the National Security Education Program were merged to form the Defense Language and National Security Education Office.

==Initiatives==
NSEP has nine initiatives:

'''Porter and Chester Institute''' is a [[for-profit school|for-profit]] [[technical school]] with nine locations throughout [[Connecticut]] and [[Massachusetts]] in the United States. Porter and Chester Institute features 10 different career programs.

==Campuses==
Porter and Chester Institute has nine campuses located throughout Connecticut and Massachusetts. The main campus is located in [[Stratford, Connecticut]]. The other Connecticut campuses are in [[Watertown, Connecticut|Watertown]], [[Rocky Hill, Connecticut|Rocky Hill]], and an affiliate campus in [[Branford, Connecticut|Branford]]. In Massachusetts, there are locations in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]], [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee]], [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]].

==History==
The history of Porter and Chester Institute began in 1946 with the founding of the '''Porter School of Engineering Design''' in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].

In 1973, the Porter School of Engineering Design and the Chester Institute for Technical Education of Stratford, Connecticut, merged into one institution. Subsequently, the name Porter and Chester Institute was adopted, and the curricula contents and operational policies of the two institutions were standardized. At the same time, the Porter School, which was located in [[Rocky Hill, Connecticut]], became the Rocky Hill Campus of Porter and Chester Institute.

The Waterbury Campus was established in 1977. In 1979, the Enfield Campus was added. In 1986 the Waterbury Campus was expanded and moved to Watertown, and in 1987 the Rocky Hill Branch was also moved to larger quarters in Wethersfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/1090537031.html?dids=1090537031:1090537031&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+05%2C+2006&amp;author=ANN+MARIE+SOMMA%3B+Courant+Staff+Writer&amp;pub=Hartford+Courant&amp;desc=INSTITUTE+MOVING+TO+AMES+LOCATION&amp;pqatl=google|title=Institute Moving to Ames Location|last=SOMMA|first=Ann Marie|date=August 5, 2006|work=Hartford Courant|accessdate=25 February 2010|location= Hartford, Conn. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicopee, Massachusetts Campus was established in 1993.

In August 1995, the stockholders of Porter and Chester Institute purchased the Connecticut School of Electronics (CSE). CSE had been established in 1947 in New Haven, CT. In 1996, CSE moved from New Haven to larger quarters in Branford, Connecticut.

In 2002, a new campus  was established in Westborough, Massachusetts.

In 2010 PCI further expanded its presence in Eastern Massachusetts by opening branches in Canton and Woburn. The Woburn campus will be the largest campus for Porter and Chester and will allow PCI to better serve the metropolitan areas of Boston, Quincy and Brocton as well as surrounding towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.porterchester.com/canton.html |title=Canton, Massachusetts campus &amp;#124; Porter and Chester Institute |publisher=Porterchester.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founder Arrested in West Bank &amp; Israel===
In December, 2004, one of QUIT!'s founders, [[Kate Bender-Raphael]] was arrested by Israeli authorities while "filming a clash between Israeli soldiers and activists protesting the building of the [[separation barrier]] in the [[West Bank]] village of [[Bil'in]]."&lt;ref name="jewishsf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/24482/edition_id/481/format/html/displaystory.html |title=Shorts: Mideast &amp;#124; j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California |publisher=Jewishsf.com |date=2004-12-17 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishsf_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/21223/edition_id/433/format/html/displaystory.html |title=Protesters rally for jailed Berkeley radical, condemn security fence &amp;#124; j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California |publisher=Jewishsf.com |date=2004-01-09 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/21275/edition_id/434/format/html/displaystory.html |title=Berkeley radical released from jail, may be deported &amp;#124; j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California |publisher=Jewishsf.com |date=2004-01-16 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bender-Raphael had been arrested in Israel and deported in 2003 "also for filming the [[Israel Defense Forces]]' reaction to a demonstration against the barrier."&lt;ref name="jewishsf" /&gt; As a result of her arrest, QUIT! staged a protest outside the Israeli [[Consulate]] in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="jewishsf_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Demian Bulwa |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/01/06/BAGTL448JG1.DTL&amp;hw=Queers+Undermining+Israeli+Terrorism&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 |title=SAN FRANCISCO / Activists to protest at Israeli Consulate |publisher=SFGate |date=2004-01-06 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boycott World Pride Jerusalem===
In late 2004, in response to Interpride's decision that the Israeli group Jerusalem Open House would host the second [[World Pride]] parade in 2005, QUIT! launched a  Boycott World Pride&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boycottworldpride.org |title=de beste bron van informatie over boycott world pride. Deze website is te koop! |publisher=boycottworldpride.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; campaign.  The boycott picked up steam after the event was postponed until August 2006 because of the pullout of the Israeli settlements from the Gaza Strip.  QUIT and many other individuals and organizations contended that it was inappropriate to hold an event titled "Love Without Borders" in a city bisected by a 30-foot concrete wall. The  International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iglhrc.org |title=International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission |publisher=IGLHRC |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; decided, in March 2006, not to participate in World Pride Jerusalem, stating, "IGLHRC recognizes that many LGBTI people in the region who wish to attend World Pride 2006, named 'Love without Borders,' will be unable to do so due to travel restrictions and conditions that limit mobility and participation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iglhrc.org/site/iglhrc/section.php?id=5&amp;detail=615 International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission - Human Rights For Everyone.

===San Francisco LGBT Film Festival===
In March, 2007, QUIT! and the [[South West Asian, North African Bay Area Queers]] (SWANABAQ)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swanaqueers.com/sf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101090836/http://www.swanaqueers.com/sf |date=January 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; initiated a campaign to pressure [[Frameline]], the organizer of the [[Frameline|San Francisco International LGBT Film Festival]], to cut its ties with the Israeli government.&lt;ref name=electronicintifada&gt;{{cite web|author=Nour Joudah |url=http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article6966.shtml |title=San Francisco Queers Say No Pride in Apartheid |publisher=The Electronic Intifada |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an open letter signed by more than 100 artists and writers, including [[Sophie Fiennes]], [[Elia Suleiman]], [[Ken Loach]], [[Haim Bresheeth]], [[Jenny Morgan]], [[John Berger]], [[Arundhati Roy]], [[Ahdaf Soueif]], [[Eduardo Galeano]], [[Brian Eno]], and [[Leon Rosselson]], Frameline was asked "to honor calls for an international boycott of Israeli political and cultural institutions, by discontinuing Israeli consulate sponsorship of the LGBT film festival and not cosponsoring events with the Israeli consulate."&lt;ref name=electronicintifada/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bajko |first=Matthew S. |url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=1838 |title=The Bay Area Reporter Online &amp;#124; Political Notebook: Queer activists reel over Israel, Frameline ties |publisher=Ebar.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal College of Chemistry''' ('''RCC''') was a college originally based on [[Oxford Street]] in central [[London]], [[England]]. It operated between 1845 and 1872.

The College was set up to teach practical [[chemistry]]. Many politicians donated funds to establish the college, including [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] and [[Robert Peel]]. It was also supported by [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]].

The first director was [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]]. [[Frederick Augustus Abel]] studied under von Hofmann. Sir [[William Crookes]], [[Edward Divers]] and [[J. A. R. Newlands]] also attended the college.

The young [[William Henry Perkin]] studied and worked at the college under von Hofmann, but resigned his position after discovering the first [[synthetic dye]], [[mauveine]], in 1856. Perkin's discovery was prompted by his work with von Hofmann on the substance [[aniline]], derived from [[coal tar]], and it was this breakthrough which sparked the synthetic dye industry, a boom which some historians have labelled 'the second [[chemical revolution]]'.

The college was merged into the [[Royal School of Mines]] in 1853. It was the first constituent college of [[Imperial College London]] and  eventually became the Imperial College Chemistry Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.imperial.ac.uk/ugprospectus/facultiesanddepartments/chemistry | title=Undergraduate Prospectus | work=Department of Chemistry | publisher=[[Imperial College London]] | location=UK | accessdate=30 March 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330221245/http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/ugprospectus/facultiesanddepartments/chemistry | archivedate=30 March 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sibley County Interactive Cable TV (ICTV) System''' was a groundbreaking form of [[distance education]] using [[interactive television]] that drew national media attention.
&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/05/education/blackboard-just-the-fax.html|title=BLACKBOARD - Just The Fax - NYTimes.com|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fax+and+TV+team+up+in+remote+classroom+learning+program.-a010577461|title=Fax and TV team up in remote classroom learning program. - Free Online Library|publisher=thefreelibrary.com|accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

Launched in 1985, the ICTV system connected classrooms in four [[Sibley County, Minnesota]] schools together by using four unused channels on Triax Cablevision's cable TV lines that already served the communities (installed a few years prior). The system was designed to address the problem of falling enrollments that the four schools were facing (and thus falling funding for teachers), by allowing the schools to share teachers among each other.

* The schools on the system were [[Gibbon, Minnesota|Gibbon]], [[Winthrop, Minnesota|Winthrop]], [[Arlington, Minnesota|Arlington]], and [[Gaylord, Minnesota|Gaylord]].
* The total cost of the system was $150,000.

The system allowed a teacher to teach a class to students at any or all of the schools. The teacher could physically be located at any of the schools. The teacher and students at all of the schools could see and to talk to each other, although assignments and tests had to be sent by courier (later fax) between the schools. Additionally, in the evenings professors from nearby [[Minnesota State University, Mankato|Mankato State University]] traveled to a school of their choice and taught introductory classes on the system, allowing high school students at the schools to receive post-secondary education (i.e. college) credits at no cost and without having to travel to the university.

== Operation ==

At each school, the system consisted of a classroom wired with the following equipment:

* 8 Televisions.
** 4 facing the teacher, showing each of the four classrooms.
** 4 facing the students, showing each of the four classrooms.
* 3 Cameras. Only one could be active at a time, select-able via push-buttons on the teacher's podium.
** 1 facing the teacher.
** 1 facing down at the teacher's podium (mounted on the ceiling).
** 1 facing the students.
* 2 Microphones.
** 1 to pick up the teacher's sounds (clip-on).
** 1 to pick up the student's sounds (mounted on the ceiling).
* 1 Computer running a slide show program (optional).
* 1 Push-button switchbox (as previously mentioned).
* 1 Cable TV Modulator.

At the teacher's school, the teacher typically alternated between selecting the podium's camera and the teacher's camera. At the remote student's schools, the student's camera was typically always selected.

To transport the TV signals generated by each school to all of the other schools, they were broadcast over the local cable television system that already connected the four communities, on four unused channels:

* Channel 32: Gibbon
* Channel 33: Gaylord
* Channel 34: Winthrop
* Channel 35: Arlington

Because the cable TV system was used, people at home in the communities could also watch classes being taught, although they could not interact with them. Taking advantage of this "feature", each school also connected a computer running a slide-show program to the system that broadcast school-related news and information (announcements, calendars, lunch menus, etc.) to their respective communities when classes weren't being taught. The computer was select-able from the push-button switchbox.

== Shutdown ==

The system was shut down around 1990. By this time, Gibbon, [[Fairfax, Minnesota|Fairfax]], and Winthrop had consolidated to form [[GFW Schools]], and Arlington and Gaylord had consolidated to form [[Sibley East Public Schools|Sibley East Schools]].

The larger class sizes as a result of these consolidations meant the system was no longer necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42765">The movement to start school later consists of efforts by health care professionals, sleep scientists, educators, economists, legislators, parents, students, and other concerned citizens to restore a later start to the school day. Based on a growing body of evidence that starting middle and high schools too early in the morning is unhealthy, counterproductive, and incompatible with adolescent sleep needs and patterns. During the second half of the 20th century, many public schools in the United States began shifting instructional time earlier than the more conventional bell time, thought{{By whom|date=March 2017}} to be about 9&amp;nbsp;a.m. Today it is common for American schools to begin the instructional day in the 7&amp;nbsp;a.m. hour and end about seven hours later, around 2&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = School Start 3Times for Middle School and High School Students — United States, 1738 School Year|url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6430a1.htm?s_cid=mm6430a1_e|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = August 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most sleep research suggests that morning classes should begin no earlier than 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. for middle and high school students.&lt;ref name="Group peds.2014-1697"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = School Start Times for Adolescents|url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/08/19/peds.2014-1697|journal = Pediatrics|date = August 25, 2014|issn = 0031-4005|pmid = 25156998|pages = peds.2014-1697|doi = 10.1542/peds.2014-1697|language = en|first = Adolescent Sleep Working|last = Group|first2 = And Council on School Health|last2 = Committee on Adolescence|volume=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of a return to later school start times argue that sleep and school hours should be viewed as a public health issue, citing evidence linking early school start times to widespread [[sleep deprivation]] among teenagers as well as a wide array of acute and chronic physical, psychological, and educational problems. Not only do students consistently get significantly more sleep on school nights when their schools move to later start times, but later school hours have been consistently linked with improved school performance, reduced impulsiveness, and greater motivation, as well as with lower rates of depression, tardiness, truancy, and morning automobile accidents.&lt;ref name="Group peds.2014-1697"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = School Start Times for Middle School and High School Students — United States, 2011–12 School Year|url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6430a1.htm?s_cid=mm6430a1_ev|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = August 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent (2011) studies suggest that early school start times disproportionately hurt economically disadvantaged students and may even negatively impact future earning potential of students, offsetting any financial savings to the school system attributed to earlier hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teensneedsleep.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/jacob-and-rockoff-organizing-schools-to-improve-student-achievement.pdf|title=Jacob &amp; Rockoff, "Organizing Schools to Improve Student Achievement: Start Times, Grade Configurations, and Teacher Assignments", Hamilton Project, Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, September 2011|website=Wordpress.com|access-date=October 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the early 1990s, the [[University of Minnesota]]'s landmark School Start Time Study tracked high school students from two Minneapolis-area districts – [[Edina, Minnesota|Edina]], a suburban district that changed its opening hour from 7:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. and the [[Minneapolis Public Schools]], which changed their opening from 7:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 8:40&amp;nbsp;a.m. Many positive benefits to students were found, including:
* Improved attendance and enrollment rates
* Less sleeping in class
* Less student-reported depression
* Fewer student visits to school counselors for behavioral and peer issues
* More even temperament at home

A longitudinal follow-up study of the Minneapolis Public Schools after five years revealed that these and other positive benefits had persisted. In 2014, a three-year project using data from more than 9,000 students attending eight high schools in three states, found that when schools switched to a start time of 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. or later, attendance, [[standardized test]] scores and academic performance improved, and tardiness, substance abuse, symptoms of depression, consumption of caffeinated drinks, and the rate of traffic accidents involving teen drivers decreased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/11299/162769/1/Impact%20of%20Later%20Start%20Time%20Final%20Report.pdf Kyla L.

== Shifted Circadian Rhythms and Sleep Deprivation ==
Proponents of a return to later school hours cite abundant evidence that starting middle and high school before about 8:30 or 9&amp;nbsp;a.m. is incompatible with the [[biological clocks]] of teenagers and young adults.&lt;ref&gt;National Sleep Foundation. Backgrounder: Later School Start Times http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/hot-topics/backgrounder-later-school-start-times&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, a team led by [[Mary Carskadon]], PhD, of [[Brown University]] showed that changes in [[circadian]] biology during [[puberty]] drive a "sleep-phase delay," a shift in the sleep-wake patterns of adolescents that leads them to fall asleep and wake up later than younger and older people. Subsequent studies have confirmed these findings, explored the impact of school start times on the sleep needs and patterns of adolescents.,&lt;ref name="McGeorgeDavid"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGeorge | first1 = David | year = 2012 | title = Sleepless in America: School start times (Editorial) | url = | journal = Education and Health | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 56–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrated a "phase shift" in the release of [[melatonin]] at puberty, which appears to be involved in shifting the sleep-wake cycle several hours later during the adolescent years.&lt;ref&gt;Later Start Times for High School Students, [[University of Minnesota]], June 2002, {{cite web |url=http://www.cehd.umn.edu/research/highlights/Sleep/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502065827/http://www.cehd.umn.edu/research/highlights/Sleep/ |archivedate=2014-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carskadon"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carskadon | first1 = MA | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1980 | title = Pubertal changes in daytime sleepiness | url = | journal = Sleep | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 453–460 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carskadon | first1 = MA | last2 = Vierira | first2 = C | last3 = Acebo | first3 = C | year = 1993 | title = Association between puberty and delayed phase preference | url = | journal = Sleep | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 258–262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This same shift to a delayed phase in the release of melatonin during puberty has also been seen in other mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=21397604|pmc=3112245|year=2011|author1=Hagenauer|first1=M.

The shifted [[circadian rhythm]]s associated with puberty make it difficult, if not impossible, for many teenagers—who may have to rise at 5 or 6 a.m. to get ready and commute to school in time for 7 a.m. school bells—to get sufficient sleep on school nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carskadon | first1 = MA | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1998 | title = Adolescent sleep patterns, circadian timing and sleepiness at a transition to early school days | url = | journal = Sleep | volume = 21 | issue = 8| pages = 871–881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even discounting for the distractions of homework and extracurricular demands and electronics, most adolescents find it difficult to fall asleep before about 11 p.m. or rise before about 8 a.m. In addition, they need to sleep in until 8 a.m. or so to get the 9 or more hours of sleep that most sleep research suggests they need.&lt;ref name="Carskadon" /&gt; As a result, many teenagers arrive at school sleep-deprived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2005 | title = The impact of school daily schedule on adolescent sleep | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/115/6/1555.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 115 | issue = 6| pages = 1555–1561 | doi=10.1542/peds.2004-1649}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eaton | first1 = McKnight-Eily L | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2010 | title = Prevalence of insufficient, borderline, and optimal hours of sleep among high school students – United States, 2007 | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 399–401 | doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2009.10.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=2735816|year=2009|author1=Roberts|first1=R.

== Health and Safety Impact of Early School Hours ==

Due to the fact that almost 70% of teens don't get enough sleep&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezp.tccd.edu/docview/1705538712/E237BDD4B346D7PQ/1?accountid=7079|title=TCCD Library Databases Login (EZProxy)|website=search-proquest-com.ezp.tccd.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, there are increases in [[stimulant]] abuse, [[weight gain]], risk of [[diabetes]],&lt;ref&gt;Sleep Loss and Obesity http://startschoollater.pbworks.com/w/page/60412574/Sleep%20Loss%20and%20Obesity&lt;/ref&gt; [[immune disorders]], [[mood swings]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], and [[suicidal ideation]], as well as reduced impulse control.&lt;ref&gt;Sleep Loss and Behavioral or Emotional Issues http://startschoollater.pbworks.com/w/page/60412566/Sleep%20Loss%20and%20Behavioral%20or%20Emotional%20Issues&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Consequences of Insufficient Sleep in Adolescents {{cite web |url=http://startschoollater.pbworks.com/w/page/60412578/Consequences%20of%20Insufficient%20Sleep%20-%20Adolescents |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928092256/http://startschoollater.pbworks.com/w/page/60412578/Consequences%20of%20Insufficient%20Sleep%20-%20Adolescents |archivedate=2013-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, early school start times have been associated with [[drowsy driving]] in new teen drivers and higher car crash rates. Schools ending early in the afternoon may also increase the risk of engaging in unhealthy, risky behaviors among sleep-deprived adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lr | first1 = McKnight-Eily | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2011 | title = Relationships between hours of sleep and health-risk behaviors in US adolescent students | url = | journal = Prev Med | volume = 53 | issue = 4-5| pages = 271–273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sending children to school before sunrise also means they must wait or walk in dark, with low visibility.&lt;ref&gt;Sleep Loss and Accidents or Injury http://startschoollater.pbworks.com/w/page/60412558/Sleep%20Loss%20and%20Accidents%20or%20Injury&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on School Performance ==

Sleep deprivation can result in low motivation, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, slowed reaction times, lack of energy, frequent errors, forgetfulness, and impaired decision-making skills. Studies, many spearheaded by Kyla Wahlstrom and her research team at [[University of Minnesota]]'s Center for Applied Research and Educational Improvement (CAREI), have tied these effects to early school start times, which, in turn, have repeatedly been linked to increased rates of tardiness, truancy, absenteeism, and dropping out.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan LA, The Effects of Sleep Deprivation on School Attendance and Dropout Rates, Sleeping Resources 2012 http://sleepingresources.com/sleep-deprivation-and-dropout-rates/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sleep Loss and Academic Achievement http://startschoollater.pbworks.com/w/page/60412535/Sleep%20Loss%20and%20Academic%20Achievement&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 a study using data from Wake County, North Carolina, showed that delaying middle school start times by one hour, from roughly 7:30 to 8:30, increases standardized test scores by at least two percentile points in math and one percentile point in reading. The effect was largest for students with below-average test scores, suggesting that later start times would narrow gaps in student achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edwards | first1 = F | year = 2012 | title = Do schools begin too early? | url = http://educationnext.org/do-schools-begin-too-early/#.T6JrcBYJQKM.facebook | journal = Education Next | volume = 12 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equity Impact of Early School Hours ==

The impact of later start times on school performance—including reduced [[truancy]], [[absenteeism]], and increased overall academic achievement—is approximately double in economically disadvantaged students.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob BA, Rockoff JE, Organizing Schools to Improve Student Achievement: StartTimes, Grade Configurations, and

== Economic Impact of Early School Hours ==

A 2017 report by the [[RAND Corporation]] concluded that delaying school start times to 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. is a cost-effective, population-level strategy that would significantly impact public health and the U.S. economy, with benefits quickly outweighing any immediate costs. After just two years, the study conservatively projected a gain of $8.6 billion to the U.S. economy. After a decade, this gain would increase to $83 billion, and after 15 years to $140 billion, amounting to an average annual gain to the U.S. economy of $9.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2109.html|title=Starting School Later Would Boost the Economy|date=October 29, 2017|website=RAND.org|access-date=October 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier Hamilton Project Report published by the [[Brookings Institution]] concluded that starting class later can be an immediate and inexpensive way to boost health, safety, and achievement for all students. The authors, economists Brian A. Jacob and Jonah E. Rockoff, predicted that starting high schools one hour later, at about 9 a.m., would result in roughly $17,500 in increased future earnings per student in present value—a benefit:cost ratio of at least 9:1 even when changing schedules requires upfront investment to alter bus schedules and/or accommodate later after-school activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2011/9/organization%20jacob%20rockoff/092011_organize_jacob_rockoff_paper.pdf|title=Jacob BA, Rockoff JE, Organizing Schools to Improve Student Achievement: StartTimes, Grade Configurations, and Teacher Assignments.

The Fairfax County (Virginia) Public Schools ([[Fairfax County Public Schools|FCPS]]) Board of Education passed a resolution in April 2012 affirming their goal to find ways to start county high schools after 8 a.m. to allow students to get sufficient sleep, a resolution supported by the ''[[Washington Post]]'s'' editorial board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Board |first=Editorial |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-04-18/opinions/35451986_1_high-schools-bell-schedule-school-buses |title=Fairfax revisits when high school classes should start - The Washington Post |publisher=Articles.washingtonpost.com |date=April 18, 2012 |access-date=2015-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213453/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-04-18/opinions/35451986_1_high-schools-bell-schedule-school-buses |archivedate=October 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013 FCPS contracted a team from the [[Children’s National Medical Center]]'s Division of Sleep Medicine to partner with Fairfax County students, parents, educators, administrators, and other community stakeholders to develop a plan to accomplish this task.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130624202115/http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/sleep-specialists-contracted-to-work-with-fairfax-county-schools-on-delaying-start-times/2013/06/16/85772934-d6cc-11e2-ab72-3f0d51ec1628_story.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; This effort led the Washington Post's editorial board to endorse later school start times as a "smarter way to start high schoolers' days" in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Board |first=Editorial |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-smarter-way-to-start-high-schoolers-days/2013/08/18/e2d24276-f49f-11e2-9434-60440856fadf_story.html |title=A smarter way to start high-schoolers’ days |publisher=The Washington Post |date=August 18, 2013 |access-date=2015-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This editorial was tweeted by U.S. Education Secretary [[Arne Duncan]] along with the comment that starting high school later and letting teens sleep more was a "common sense" way "to improve student achievement that too few have implemented."&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Arne (arneduncan).

In England, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]'s Sleep and Circadian Neurosciences Institute (SCNi) in 2015 began a study involving sleep education for teenagers in England and Wales. Professors [[Russell Foster (neuroscientist)|Russell Foster]] and [[Colin Espie]] with their project "Teensleep" will assess whether ten half-hour lessons in year 10 will improve academic performance and well-being. Taught by specially trained teachers, the lessons introduce scientific theory on the importance of sleep and the effects of sleep deprivation as well as techniques for stress management.  The study has been redesigned since it was originally announced; it was previously considerably more ambitious, including a later start time at about twenty-five schools, sleep education in others, both in some schools and neither in others. Students will be evaluated before and after the sleep education periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teensleep|url=http://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/research/sleep-circadian-neuroscience-institute/research-projects-4/teensleep|website=Sleep &amp; Circadian Neuroscience Institute|publisher=University of Oxford|access-date=21 April 2016|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grassroots Advocacy ==

Community groups have sporadically arisen in various school communities since the 1990s, sometimes prompting studies and reform proposals but often dying out as concerned, active families grew out of the system.&lt;ref name="McGeorgeDavid" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snider, Terra Ziporyn Snider.

More recently, [[social media]] tools have allowed once isolated advocates to unite efforts and share resources. In fall 2011, an [[online petition]] effort galvanized a national non-profit organization, [[Start School Later]], a coalition of health professionals, sleep scientists, educators, parents, students, and other concerned citizens dedicated to increasing public awareness about the relationship between sleep and school hours and to ensuring school start times compatible with health, safety, education, and equity.

* [[Sudbury Valley School]] and other [[Sudbury School]]s – A school model with no set hours.  Students attend 5 or 6 hours during open hours (e.g. 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 5 p.m.) depending only on the applicable laws for [[compulsory education]]. In some states in the United States, this statute is referred to as "Student Learning Time".

'''''Stuff You Should Know''''', often abbreviated as '''SYSK''', is an award-winning [[podcast]] and video series published by the [[HowStuffWorks]] [[website]] and hosted by Josh Clark and Charles W. "Chuck" Bryant, both writers at HowStuffWorks. The podcast is consistently ranked in the Top 10 on iTunes. It is one of the most popular podcasts in the world, being downloaded millions of times each month.&lt;ref name=replacing/&gt;

The podcast, released every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, educates listeners on a wide variety of topics, often using popular culture as a reference giving the podcast comedic value.&lt;ref name=mediashift/&gt; The podcast is available for free on the [[iTunes Store]]&lt;ref name=itunes/&gt; and consistently appears in the platform's Top 10.&lt;ref name=stars/&gt; On January 19, 2013, a television show based on the series aired on Science Channel and ran for one season. On April 1, 2017, replays of podcasts specially selected by the hosts, known as SYSK Selects, began running on Saturdays.

==Josh &amp; Chuck==
''Stuff You Should Know'' is hosted by two senior editors at [[HowStuffWorks.com]], Josh Clark&lt;ref name=josh/&gt; and Charles Wayne "Chuck" Bryant. Their producer is Jeri "Jerome" Rowland.&lt;ref name=waves/&gt;&lt;ref name=duo/&gt;&lt;ref name=quiz/&gt;

Clark was a host of the show since the beginning, and before Bryant took over the co-hosting duties Clark was joined by several other editors.&lt;ref name=mediashift/&gt;&lt;ref name=duo/&gt; The chemistry between the two was immediately apparent, and Bryant became a permanent co-host (despite his actual knowledge on subject matter which is researched before hand) Some speculate that Bryant's assertive albeit incorrect statements are meant to be a humorous device. This has not been confirmed by either Clark or Bryant.&lt;ref name=featured/&gt;&lt;ref name=way/&gt; Bryant started working at HowStuffWorks about a month after Clark.&lt;ref name=grows/&gt; They had desks catty-cornered [sic] across from each other and would often pop up to share their research.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Clark.

In the "Christmas" reference he says he was born in 1976.  In the "mobs" reference he gives his birthday as July 15.  This date assumes that he did the math wrong in the "space" episode and combines the day in "mobs" with the year in "Christmas".---&gt; He grew up in Toledo, Ohio&lt;ref name=duo/&gt; where his nickname was Pillsbury Doughboy.&lt;ref name=team2/&gt; He was raised Catholic&lt;ref name=xmas/&gt; and attended a Catholic school.&lt;ref name=haunted/&gt; He moved to Marietta, Georgia as a teenager.&lt;ref name=duo/&gt; Clark's father's name is Mal,&lt;ref name=born/&gt; an HVAC engineer.&lt;ref name=geothermal/&gt; He has a sister named Karen,&lt;ref name=born/&gt; and two brothers-in-law,&lt;ref name=moonshine/&gt; one of whose name is also Josh.&lt;ref name=drought/&gt;

He is a former smoker,&lt;ref name=interviewjosh/&gt; drinks a lot of coffee,&lt;ref name=interviewjosh/&gt; and is an amateur mixologist.&lt;ref name=stg/&gt; His hero is [[Muhammad Yunus]].&lt;ref name=quiz/&gt;  His favorite books include 1491 &amp; 1493 by [[Charles C. Mann]] which he frequently quotes and/or references in the SYSK podcast. Josh is also a fan of [[The Simpsons]], [[Firefly]], [[Dollywood]], and [[Quentin Tarantino]].&lt;ref name=way/&gt;

He attended [[Sprayberry High School]]&lt;ref name=duo/&gt; and studied history and anthropology at the [[University of Georgia]].&lt;ref name=josh/&gt;&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref name=clark/&gt;&lt;ref name= toronto/&gt;&lt;ref name=bites/&gt; As a youth interested in the [[paranormal]], he wanted to study [[parapsychology]] at [[Duke University]].&lt;ref name=Nostradamus/&gt; Also as a child, he was an avid reader of [[Uncle John's Bathroom Reader]], as mentioned in many podcasts, and he jokingly cites Uncle John's Bathroom Reader as the source of the majority of his knowledge. This admiration was eventually reciprocated when UJBR mentioned SYSK on their website and had one of their employees feature as a guest on SYSK's Barbie® doll podcast.&lt;ref name=bath/&gt;

After college he pursued a career in journalism,&lt;ref name=featured/&gt; working as "a cub reporter" in [[Henry County, Georgia]],&lt;ref name=planning/&gt; and was the founding editor of The Washboard Weekly, an "edgy tabloid" in Johnson City, Tennessee.&lt;ref name=duo/&gt;&lt;ref name=grows/&gt; It went out of business due to a lack of advertising.&lt;ref name=duo/&gt;&lt;ref name=grows/&gt; His neighbors in Johnson City lived on the side of a mountain in a converted school bus with a chimney coming out of it.&lt;ref name=moonshine/&gt;

Before joining How Stuff Works in 2007&lt;ref name=duo/&gt;&lt;ref name=sugar/&gt; he was a self described [[wikt:factotum#Noun|factotum]] who held many jobs.&lt;ref name=interviewjosh/&gt; He had a paper route, washed dogs, and held "jobs that involved shovels."&lt;ref name=interviewjosh/&gt; Before recording his first episode in 2008, Clark had never listened to a podcast,&lt;ref name= toronto/&gt; and didn't know what one was.&lt;ref name=popular/&gt;

===Charles W. "Chuck" Bryant===
Charles Wayne&lt;ref name=quiz/&gt;&lt;ref name=norris/&gt; Bryant is always introduced on the show as Charles W. "Chuck" Bryant, but fans often refer to him as "Chuckers."&lt;ref name=team/&gt; Born March 15,&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;&lt;ref name=blood/&gt; 1971,&lt;ref name=Christmas/&gt; Bryant was raised Baptist&lt;ref name=haunted/&gt; and played church league sports,&lt;ref name=dog/&gt; although his "constant struggle with [his] religious upbringing"&lt;ref name=gypies/&gt; has been "well documented over the years."&lt;ref name=gypies/&gt; He is part [[Choctaw]].&lt;ref name=empathy/&gt;

Bryant grew up in [[DeKalb County, Georgia]] but his family lived in "rural Mississippi since the dawn of time."&lt;ref name=march/&gt; He attended an elementary school where his father was the principal&lt;ref name=hinkley/&gt; and graduated from [[Redan High School]].&lt;ref name=duo/&gt; His mother, Diane,&lt;ref name=flu/&gt; was also a teacher.&lt;ref name=teach/&gt; He has a brother named Scott&lt;ref name=reverse/&gt; who is three years older than him,&lt;ref name=jv/&gt; a sister who is six years older,&lt;ref name=jv/&gt; and a brother-in-law who is a Marine Corps General.&lt;ref name=citizen/&gt;&lt;ref name=things/&gt; His uncle, [[Ed Bryant]], is a former Republican member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from Tennessee. Bryant once appeared on the cover of ''[[Guideposts]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=satan/&gt;

Bryant attended the [[University of Georgia]]&lt;ref name=duo/&gt; where he studied English.&lt;ref name=bites/&gt; After college, he took classes in screenwriting at New York University's film school and then moved to Los Angeles for four years.&lt;ref name=duo/&gt; He has also lived in New Jersey.&lt;ref name=stonehenge/&gt;

Bryant is married to Emilie Sennebogen,&lt;ref name=stg/&gt; and in 2015 the couple adopted a daughter, Ruby Rose, who shares a birthday with Clark.&lt;ref name=ruby/&gt;&lt;ref name=racial/&gt;  As a self-described "crazy animal person," he has multiple pets.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt; He plays the guitar in an "old man band," called "El Cheapo".&lt;ref name=stg/&gt;&lt;ref name=toronto/&gt; Humorist [[John Hodgman]] is a "dear friend."&lt;ref name=Hodgman/&gt;

He is the author of six screenplays,&lt;ref name="duo" /&gt; including one about a Southern Baptist church called "Sweet, Sweet Spirit,"&lt;ref name="grows" /&gt; but did not find success in that field.&lt;ref name="grows" /&gt;&lt;ref name="drink" /&gt;&lt;ref name="popular" /&gt; While in Los Angeles, he was a production assistant on TV commercials, a few indie movies, and music videos, which he says helped with the TV version of ''Stuff You Should Know''.&lt;ref name="drink" /&gt;&lt;ref name="popular" /&gt; He was hired at How Stuff Works after a friend got a job there, and submitted the first act of a screenplay as a writing sample.&lt;ref name="featured" /&gt;

==Podcast==
{{main article|List of Stuff You Should Know episodes}}

===History===
The podcast was launched on April 17, 2008, with Bryant making his debut on May 13, 2008.&lt;ref name=grows/&gt; Bryant became the permanent cohost on July 15, 2008.&lt;ref name=grows/&gt; The podcast, which was named by Clark,&lt;ref name=duo/&gt; began as an attempt to re-purpose some of the written content on HowStuffWorks.com.&lt;ref name=way/&gt;&lt;ref name=QA/&gt; Clark had never listened to a podcast before he recorded his first episode in 2008.&lt;ref name=mediashift/&gt;&lt;ref name=toronto/&gt; [[Jesse Thorn]] has held the name up as a model of how a podcast should be named saying "it's like daring the listener ''not'' to listen to it."&lt;ref name=purpose/&gt;

The podcast has steadily grown in popularity since its introduction and has made appearances at events including [[South by Southwest]] and [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]]. On October 26, 2017, ''Stuff You Should Know'' released their 1000th episode. Several episodes have been recorded during live events, including two during their World Tour of Canada in September and October 2014.&lt;ref name=Canada/&gt; While in Canada they also participated in the Northwest Podcast Festival,&lt;ref name=northwest/&gt; at SXSW in 2011 and 2012,&lt;ref name=sxsw/&gt; and New York Comic Con in 2012 where they recorded their discussion entitled "Time Travel: Science Fact or Science Fiction?"&lt;ref name=way/&gt;&lt;ref name=invades/&gt;

During the 4th of July weekend in 2011 there was a Stuff You Should Know About America [[Marathon (media)|marathon]] on Sirius XM radio.&lt;ref name=sirius/&gt; It featured previous episodes, as well as a live segment with [[Wyatt Cenac]] and [[Hallie Haglund]] of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' as well as [[Joe Randazzo]], [[Joe Garden]] and [[Jill Morris]] of ''[[The Onion]]''.&lt;ref name=sirius/&gt; Their [[420 (cannabis culture)|420th]] episode was on [[medical marijuana]], although this was reportedly a coincidence.&lt;ref name=mars/&gt;

In 2011 the podcast added "Bonus Videos" to the podcast feed. These consist of humorous 60 second videos where Clark and Bryant converse about subjects they covered on previous podcasts while doing a variety of random activities (playing checkers, getting fitted for a suit, going to a doctor, driving through a car wash). As they speak, the scene changes repeatedly to something completely different, though their conversation continues uninterrupted as though nothing had happened. These clips have also aired during [[Television advertisement|commercial]] slots on [[Science Channel|Science]] and appear on their YouTube channel.

There is one unaired episode on [[animal detectives]] that they hope will never be published.&lt;ref name=popular/&gt; They have twice repeated a topic. They revisited the topic of [[Murphy's Law]] in 2011 after first doing it in 2008. As one of their first episodes, it was under 6 minutes in length. They also accidentally repeated a podcast on customs.&lt;ref name=customs/&gt; The first time was in 2010 and the second was in 2016.&lt;ref name=customs/&gt;

===Format===
The podcast has been described as the "heart and soul of the operation,"&lt;ref name=toronto/&gt; and the "well researched" episodes cover a variety topics from the fields of "science, history, urban legends, and pop culture, with the occasional conspiracy theory thrown in for good measure."&lt;ref name=way/&gt; Clark and Bryant have a conversation about the given topic such that, by the end, listeners have a "basic working knowledge of that subject."&lt;ref name=way/&gt; Clark has said they are on a "never ending quest to explain absolutely everything there is on planet earth and beyond."&lt;ref name=circus/&gt;

Their "biggest hits" include episodes on [[Spam (food)|Spam]], hangovers, tipping in restaurants, cheese, Barbie, and pinball.&lt;ref name=toronto/&gt; The topics that get the greatest response from listeners include death and grieving,&lt;ref name=toronto/&gt; and episodes that received "less enthusiastic feedback" include shows on homelessness/addiction, Tourette's Syndrome, and transgender issues.&lt;ref name=way/&gt; It was the second podcast on HowStuffWorks.&lt;ref name=duo/&gt; Episodes are normally around 45 minutes in length, although for more in-depth topics the show occasionally runs long as an hour or more. Initial episodes were much shorter in duration, often less than 10 minutes.

One of the reasons the hosts believe the show has been so successful is that they are "definitely not experts" in the myriad subjects they explore, but are instead "just guys who enjoy research and [are] very curious."&lt;ref name = toronto/&gt; Their formula "is part self-deprecating humour, part infectious wonder and part self-discipline to go their separate ways and do all their own research and reflection before they get to the studio."&lt;ref name=toronto/&gt; They often try to surprise one another with their research,&lt;ref name=way/&gt;&lt;ref name=popular/&gt; and do not have a script or a time limit before they sit down to record.&lt;ref name=duo/&gt;&lt;ref name = toronto/&gt;

Most episodes end with listener mail, although there is an occasional segment known as "Administrative Details." Listener mail debuted on November 25, 2008, in the episode named "How Albert Einstein's Brain Worked".&lt;ref name=albert/&gt; On that episode, they called it "Correction Time." The first time it was known as "Listener Mail" was on January 8, 2009, an episode that was inspired by a listener's email.&lt;ref name=armor/&gt; During the Listener Mail portion of the podcast on April 11, 2013, a new jingle for the show was introduced.&lt;ref name=brains/&gt; It was written and recorded by Rusty Matyas of Winnipeg, Manitoba in Canada, a musician and fan.&lt;ref name=brains/&gt; [http://www.jonbiegen.com Jon Biegen], another fan who covered Matyas' band, The Sheepdogs, has produced several new jingles for the show.&lt;ref name=movies/&gt;

The ''Stuff You Should Know'' staff includes Rebecca, the web producer, Matt and Noel, the occasional guest producers, as well as Sherry and Joe.&lt;ref name=placebo/&gt; Their studio is slightly larger than a broom closet.&lt;ref name=replacing/&gt;

==YouTube==
''Stuff You Should Know'' also has a YouTube channel. Animated shorts are released on Mondays, This Day in History videos are released on Tuesdays, and Clark's series Don't Be Dumb airs a new episode on Thursdays.&lt;ref name=welcometext/&gt; In addition, the pair also offers live shorts and movie reviews.&lt;ref name=welcome/&gt;

In "Don't Be Dumb," Clark explains a topic while wearing a tweed jacket and bow tie. His posture, gestures, and stilted language are intentionally uncomfortable and awkward. Each episode ends with Clark saying: "So, next time someone tells you [subject of video], you set them straight! And tell them Josh sent you."

Internet Roundup is a new video segment filmed in the studio. Chuck and Josh highlight a couple of posts found deep in the web that they find interesting, entreating or amusing. In 2009, Clark and Bryant began a "short lived" webscast.&lt;ref name=zero/&gt;&lt;ref name=webcast/&gt;

==TV show==
A full-length ''Stuff You Should Know'' TV show premiered on January 19, 2013 on the [[Science Channel]], which was owned by [[Discovery Network]], the parent company of ''HowStuffWorks''. The show included a pilot and 10 episodes each 30 minutes in length.&lt;ref name=stars/&gt;&lt;ref name=pilot/&gt; The series was produced by production company School of Humans.

Described as the "love child of the British version of [[The Office (UK TV series)|''The Office'']] and an overheard conversation about science between two reasonably informed guys,"&lt;ref name=csi/&gt; the show was about a real podcast that is set in a fictional world. Each episode followed Josh and Chuck inside and outside the recording booth, combining the factual information of their podcast with humorous, fictional story lines that align with each podcast topic.&lt;ref name=tvshow/&gt;

The show had "the attention span of a teenaged boy" and "bounces from scene to scene without explanation or sense."&lt;ref name=csi/&gt; Focus groups at the 2012 South by Southwest screened episodes and provided feedback for the development of the show, and its pacing in particular.&lt;ref name=way/&gt;

The lead actress on the show was [[Caitlin Bitzegaio]] of the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]].&lt;ref name=popular/&gt; The shows were directed by L.C. Crowley&lt;ref name=cast/&gt; with a theme song and score composed by The Henry Clay People,&lt;ref name=sxsw/&gt; the "unofficial house band" of Stuff You Should Know.&lt;ref name=ticks/&gt; Guests on the show included [[John Hodgman]], [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], and [[Michio Kaku]].&lt;ref name=abouttv/&gt;

The show was canceled after the first season "due to poor ratings",&lt;ref name=ratings/&gt; although each episode is made available for purchase on [[iTunes]] and [[Google Play]]. It was the most expensive pilot episode ever produced by the Discovery Channel.&lt;ref name=way/&gt;

==Outside activities==
As with the other podcasts offered by HowStuffWorks, Stuff You Should Know has its own [[blog]] updated daily by its hosts and often featuring the same type of material found in the podcasts, often with show followups. There is also both a Twitter account and Facebook page for SYSK. Clark and Bryant were the co-hosts for the Science of Cyborgs event hosted by the [[Science &amp; Entertainment Exchange]].&lt;ref name=featured/&gt;

===Microlending===
Starting in 2009, after doing an episode on how [[microlending]] works, the show began encouraging listeners to make loans on the online microlending site [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]].&lt;ref name=mediashift/&gt; A Stuff You Should Know team had raised $150,000 by the middle of 2010,&lt;ref name=mediashift/&gt; and more than $2.75 million by November 2014.&lt;ref name=kiva/&gt; In 2009 they challenged [[Stephen Colbert]] to see whose team could raise $100,000 first&lt;ref name=colbert/&gt; and they "beat the pants off of" him, reaching that goal in three months.&lt;ref name=microlend/&gt;

The lending team is now run by fan volunteers,&lt;ref name=mediashift/&gt; has since consistently ranked among the top five teams in terms of both donations and users. {{As of|2014|11}} the team ranked #7 for new users among new Kiva users, and in the "Friends" category of teams, ranked #2 for new users and amount loaned.&lt;ref name=kiva/&gt;

===Books===
Clark and Bryant also present two longer and more in-depth audio programs featuring interviews and portions recorded [[Location shooting|on location]] available for purchase as [[audiobook]]s, which are entitled ''The Super Stuffed Guide to the Economy'' and ''The Super Stuffed Guide to Happiness''.

They are also working on a ''Stuff You Should Know'' book, which they hope to have published "before the end of the decade."&lt;ref name=stg/&gt;

===Cooperative for Education===
In February 2010,&lt;ref name=CoEd/&gt; Clark, Bryant, and Rowland traveled to Guatemala to promote [[Cooperative for Education]], an organization which gives textbooks to schools in Guatemala to be rented by students for a small fee that is then deposited into an account that will be used to replace old textbooks in the future.&lt;ref name=bites/&gt; They produced a pair of podcasts on the topic.&lt;ref name=CoEd/&gt;

==Reception==
The show is downloaded more than 1 million times per week and is consistently on the iTunes Top 10 podcast rankings,&lt;ref name=stars/&gt; peaking at #1.&lt;ref name=mediashift/&gt; It is "one of the most downloaded podcasts on the planet."&lt;ref name=grows/&gt; The show won the 2014 People's Voice [[Webby Award]] in the Mobile – Podcast division.&lt;ref name=webby/&gt; and a place in [[Podcast Awards]]'s Education category.&lt;ref name=mediashift/&gt; At live events the demographics of the audiences are "all over the map. There are some geeks here and there, but also super cool people, and families and kids, and old people."&lt;ref name=age/&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' chose the TV show in early February 2013 as #7 for their "The Must List: The Top 10 Things We Love This Week," writing, "Whether you're curious about [[Beehive|bee colonies]] or [[Weather modification|weather control]], Josh Clark and Chuck Bryant have the scoop."&lt;ref name=EW/&gt; The podcast has been said to cover "a truly staggering range of topics."&lt;ref name=way/&gt;

Clark and Bryant have been described as "hosts so lovely you may just fall in love with them,"&lt;ref name=cosmo/&gt; and provide the show with "an everyman, conversational feel to the show — two pals sitting back and picking apart one topic after another."&lt;ref name=grows/&gt; Several couples have been brought together because of their mutual fondness for the podcast, and one even had a ''Stuff You Should Know''-themed wedding.&lt;ref name=grows/&gt;

They receive over 350 pieces of fan mail a week.&lt;ref name=mediashift/&gt;&lt;ref name=featured/&gt; After two months, their Facebook page had over 10,000 likes,&lt;ref name=mediashift/&gt; and as of September 2015 it had more than 750,000. One reviewer said of it: "It is never not fun to listen to."&lt;ref name=pod/&gt;

''Stuff You Should Know''{{'}}s "beautifully, beautifully done" production has set "the audio standard," according to podcast reviewers [[Pod on Pod]]. They added that the audio quality "could not be improved" on the NPR-level production.&lt;ref name=pod/&gt;

The podcast ''[[Catholic Stuff You Should Know]]'' is modeled after Clark and Bryant's podcast.&lt;ref name=CSYSK/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8753">'''Technology For All''' is a nonprofit organization based in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. Developed in 1997 by local entrepreneurs, Technology For All services community-based organizations (such as development centers, YMCAs, and local schools) with computer technology, training, and other digital incentives “to empower under-resourced communities through the tools of technology.” Through the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]]'s Broadband Technology Opportunities Program grant, Technology For All (TFA) currently hosts 19 public computer centers.

==History==
Technology For All was formed in 1997 as a response to a perceived lack of [[digital inclusion]] for historically low-income areas. In 1998, it received M.D Anderson Foundation's first $50,000 grant to help build a [[community technology center]] at the M.D. Anderson [[YMCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Betty|title=Ministry taps computer technology to create jobs / Focus is to train area residents with low incomes|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/2005_3834921/ministry-taps-computer-technology-to-create-jobs-f.html|accessdate=6 August 2011|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|date=13 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to their website, TFA has created 180 community technology centers in the United States since its inception, all partnered with community-serving organizations.

When the [[Reliant Astrodome]] sheltered [[Hurricane Katrina]] refugees in 2005, TFA coordinated a lab with 40 computers and other free supplies. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Associated Press|title=Phones, PCs coming to Astrodome refugees|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9175720/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/phones-pcs-coming-astrodome-refugees/#.TlLRlF0t25A|work=Techs and Gadgets|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community development==
Technology For All divides its goals into three priorities: community technology center support and development, technology research and innovation, and technology services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Priorities|url=http://techforall.org/AboutUs/2011Priorities/tabid/76/Default.aspx|publisher=Technology For All|accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===TFA-Wireless===
TFA and [[Rice University]] operate the TFA-Wireless project, which provides free high-speed wireless Internet to [[Pecan Park, Houston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TFA and Rice Wireless Network|url=http://tfa.rice.edu/|publisher=Rice University|accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2011, they installed the first residential deployment of [[Super Wi-Fi]], which uses longer wavelengths to penetrate typical wireless barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Myslewski|first=Rik|title=Texas grandma gets first 'Super Wi-Fi'|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/19/super_wi_fi/|accessdate=20 August 2011|newspaper=The Register|date=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texas Connects Coalition===
Texas Connects Coalition (TXC2) is a partnership between TFA, [[Austin FreeNet]] (AFN), and the [[Metropolitan Austin Interactive Network]] (MAIN). It was recently awarded a Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) grant valued at over nine million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technology For All, Inc.|url=http://www2.ntia.doc.gov/grantee/technology-for-all-inc|work=Grants Awarded: Public Computer Centers|publisher=Broadband USA|accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The grant is provided by the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]] and funded by the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]. The coalition is summarized as a “comprehensive … initiative significantly expanding broadband public computer center capacity ... across Texas.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technology For All Inc.|url=http://www.ntia.doc.gov/legacy/broadbandgrants/applications/results.htm|work=Applications Database|publisher=Broadband USA|accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the grant, TXC2 plans to install and maintain 70 public computer centers throughout [[Austin]], [[San Antonio]], [[Houston]], and the [[Brazos Valley]] to "provide computer access, technical support, digital literacy, workforce development and other services to low-income and vulnerable populations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Steele|first=Kim|title=Library receives grant|url=http://www.madisonvillemeteor.com/news/article_c4945c9a-4a8d-11e0-a618-001cc4c002e0.html|accessdate=22 August 2011|newspaper=The Madisonville Meteor|date=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the BTOP grant, TFA aims to extend its network of public computer centers to 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Texas Connects Coalition|title=Public Computer Center (PCC) Sites|url=http://txc2.org/site/3|publisher=txc2.org|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each lab is partnered with organizations in historically underprivileged neighborhoods, such as Eastside University Village Community Learning Center in [[Third Ward, Houston|Third Ward]] and the Spring Branch Family Development Center. Each center provides public computers, printers, and Internet access, plus a trainer to manage the center and teach various computer literacy courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spring Branch community to benefit from computer lab at Esperanza|url=http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/memorial/living/article_51de027f-64e7-5eb4-95bc-aec1800fdd47.html?mode=story|accessdate=24 August 2011|newspaper=The Memorial Examiner|date=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Steve Biko Foundation]] launched the '''Steve Biko Memorial Lecture''' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;The Steve Biko Memorial Lectures 2000-2008, The Steve Biko Foundation and Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 11th Annual Steve Biko Memorial Lecture==
12 September 2010 marked the 33rd anniversary of the murder of [[Steve Biko]]. In commemoration, the Steve Biko Foundation hosted Professor [[Alice Walker]], the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ''[[The Color Purple]]'', in South Africa for a series of events to celebrate the life and works of Steve Biko.

The 33rd anniversary commemoration consisted of two events. The first. "An Evening with Alice Walker", took place on 7 September at the State Theatre in Pretoria. Along with readings by Professor Walker, the event featured South African artists.  The second component was the  11th Annual Steve Biko Memorial Lecture, held at Jameson Hall at the University of Cape Town on Thursday 9 September.

==Excerpts from the Steve Biko Memorial Lectures Book==
''"A young man with a sharp intellect and flair for organisation and leadership, Biko realised the need to raise the sagging morale of black people, to raise their consciousness and self-esteem; in his own words to 'overcome the psychological oppression of black people by whites'." -'''Chinua Achebe'''''&lt;ref&gt;Professor Chinua Achebe, "Fighting Apartheid with Words" delivered on 12 September 2002, published in ''The Steve Biko Memorial Lectures 2000–2008'', Macmillan, 2009, pp. 41–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

''"Steve Biko, whom we have come to honour, is among this great gallery of people whose work and devotion have impacted those beyond the native shores, and which make it possible for us even to talk about the possibilities of a new Africa out of the colonial ashes of latter-day empires." - '''Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o'''''&lt;ref&gt;Ngugi wa Thiong'o "Recovering our Memory: South Africa in the Black Imagination", delivered 12 September 2003, published in ''The Steve Biko Memorial Lectures 2000–2008'', Macmillan, 2009, pp. 51–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

''"History from time to time, brings to the fore the kind of leaders who seize the moment,who cohere the wishes and inspirations of the oppressed.Such was Steve Biko,a fitting product of his time;a proud representative of the reawakening of a people."- '''Nelson Mandela'''''&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Mandela "Ten Years of Democracy:1994-2004" delivered 10 September 2004, also published in ''The Steve Biko Memorial Lectures 2000–2008'', Macmillan, 2009, pp. 73–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
A response to ''[[The Bell Curve]]'' (1994), by [[Richard Herrnstein]] and [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]], ''The Bell Curve Debate'' includes 81 articles by 81 authors. Contemporary authors whose writings are collected in the book include [[K. Anthony Appiah]], [[Gregg Easterbrook]], [[Howard Gardner]], [[Eugene D. Genovese]], [[Nathan Glazer]], [[Stephen Jay Gould]], [[Bob Herbert]], Richard Herrnstein, [[Christopher Hitchens]], [[Irving Louis Horowitz]], [[Arthur Jensen]], [[Leon J. Kamin]], [[Charles Lane (journalist)|Charles Lane]], [[Glenn C. Loury]], [[Richard E. Nisbett]], [[Nell Irvin Painter]], Hugh Pearson, Adolph Reed Jr., [[Carl Rowan]], [[Alan Ryan]], [[Brent Staples]], [[Ellen Willis]], and [[Christopher Winship]]. Jacoby and Glauberman republish historical materials by authors including [[Carl Brigham]], [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], [[Francis Galton]], [[Walter Lippmann]], [[Karl Pearson]], and [[Lewis Terman]]. The publisher, Times Books, describes the book as a compilation of "the best of recent reviews and essays, and salient documents drawn from the curious history of this heated debate" capturing "the fervor, anger, and scope of an almost unprecedented national argument over the very idea of democracy and the possibility of a tolerant, multiracial America.

'''Theresa Serber Malkiel''' (1874-1949) was a Russian-born American labor activist, [[Women's suffrage in the United States|suffragist]], and educator. She was the first woman to rise from factory work to leadership in the Socialist party. Her 1910 novel, ''The Diary of a Shirtwaist Striker'', is credited with helping to reform New York state labor laws. As head of the Woman's National Committee of the [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA), she established an annual Woman's Day which was the precursor to [[International Women's Day]]. In 1911, while on a speaking tour of the [[American South]], she called attention to the problem of [[white supremacism]] within the party. She spent her later years promoting [[adult education]] for women workers.

== Early life ==

Theresa Serber was born in Bar, Russia (now Ukraine) on May 1, 1874, one of four sisters. The family moved to the [[Lower East Side]] of New York City in 1891, and seventeen-year-old Theresa went to work as a cloakmaker in a garment factory.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1978), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==

Soon after her arrival in New York she joined the Russian Workingmen's Club. In 1892 she organized the Infant Cloakmaker's Union of New York, a group of mostly Jewish women, and became its first president.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1978), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few years she represented her union in the [[Knights of Labor]], the Central Labor Federation, and the [[United Hebrew Trades]]. Her exposure to the radicalism of the latter two groups reinforced her socialist beliefs, and in 1893 she joined the [[Socialist Labor Party]] (SLP). She was an active member of the SLP for six years, representing her union at the first convention of the [[Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance]].&lt;ref name="miller1923"&gt;Miller (1978), pp. 192-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899 she left the SLP and joined the [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA). Malkiel believed that only socialism could liberate women, and that socialism, in turn, could not survive without the full participation of women. In theory, the Socialist party was committed to equal rights for men and women, but in practice, it made no effort to reach out specifically to women workers and showed little interest in their concerns. Malkiel concluded that socialist women would have to fight their own parallel battle for equality.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1978), pp. 192-3, 197-8, 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Her 1909 essay, "Where Do We Stand on the Woman Question?" expresses her frustration with this state of affairs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the workingwoman of today finds herself between two fires&amp;mdash;on the one hand, she faces the capitalist class, her bitterest enemy; it foresees a far-reaching danger in her emancipation and with all the ability of its money power tries to resist her eventual advent into the civilized world. In her anguish the workingwoman turns towards her brothers in the hope to find a strong support in their midst, but she is doomed to be disillusioned, for they discourage her activity and are utterly listless towards the outcome of her struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Malkiel (1909), pp. 160-161.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1905, Malkiel organized the Women's Progressive Society of Yonkers, which became a branch of the Socialist Women's Society of New York. Although the socialist party was officially opposed to [[separatism]], Malkiel believed a women's organization was necessary to attract women to the party, and as a practice ground for women activists. Women were tired of their limited positions in the party as "official cake-bakers and money-collectors," she said.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1978), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, she wrote socialist [[propaganda]] leaflets and published numerous articles on socialism and the [[woman question]] in journals such as the ''[[The Socialist Woman|Progressive Woman]]'', ''Machinists' Monthly'', and the ''[[International Socialist Review (1900)|International Socialist Review]]''. She also contributed to the ''[[New York Call]]'', a socialist journal she co-founded with her husband.&lt;ref name="taitz" /&gt;

=== Woman's National Committee ===

Malkiel was elected to the Woman's National Committee of the Socialist party in 1909. She served as a delegate to several conventions, campaigned, wrote pamphlets, and, like [[Rose Pastor Stokes]], helped raise awareness of immigrant women's concerns. She established suffrage clubs designed to appeal to working women and bring them into the party.&lt;ref name="taitz" /&gt; She also established an annual Woman's Day, starting on February 28, 1909, which was observed by several European socialist parties as well as the SPA.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1978), pp. 195, 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Woman's Day was the precursor to [[International Women's Day]] which is celebrated each year on March 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=United Nations |title=International Women's Day |url=https://www.un.org/events/women/iwd/2008/history.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 she worked closely with the [[Women's Trade Union League]] (WTUL) to support the [[New York shirtwaist strike of 1909|New York shirtwaist strike]] with publicity and fundraising.&lt;ref name="taitz" /&gt;

=== ''The Diary of a Shirtwaist Striker'' ===

In 1910, Malkiel published ''The Diary of a Shirtwaist Striker'', a fictionalized account of the shirtwaist strike. She depicted the strike from the point of view of an American-born worker who is initially wary of her immigrant co-workers. Over time she grows closer to them and becomes increasingly aware of the need to win the ballot as well as the strike, and of the need for more solidarity between male and female workers.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1978), p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] the following year, the book garnered public attention and helped trigger legislative reforms.&lt;ref name="taitz"&gt;{{cite web |website=Jewish Women's Archive |title=Theresa Serber Malkiel, 1874 – 1949 |first1=Emily |last1=Taitz |url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/malkiel-theresa-serber}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later scholars tended to dismiss the book as propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Basch (1990), p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 it was reprinted by [[Cornell University Press]] with an introduction by historian Françoise Basch, and received positive reviews from [[Alice Kessler-Harris]], [[Mari Jo Buhle]], and the ''[[ILR Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Basch (1990), back cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tour of the American South ===

During a speaking tour of the American South in 1911, Malkiel was appalled to learn that white socialists were practicing [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]]. In one Arkansas town, she was invited to speak at a gathering of over a thousand African Americans, but party organizers would not allow it. In another, the Socialist local refused to allow African Americans to join. At one event in Mississippi she gave a speech in the pouring rain to a group of dues-paying African-American socialists who were denied entry to the local meeting hall. Her scathing report in the ''[[New York Call]]'' created a stir:&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2013), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lord preserve us from this kind of Socialists....We must not preach Socialism to the negroes because the white workingmen are foolish enough to allow their masters to arouse their prejudices against their fellow workers in order to keep them divided so as to play off one against the other.&lt;ref name="nycall"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Theresa |last1=Malkiel |newspaper=The New York Call |date=August 21, 1911 |title='Socialists' Despise Negroes in the South |url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2014/New%20York%20NY%20Evening%20Call/New%20York%20NY%20Evening%20Call%201911/New%20York%20NY%20Evening%20Call%201911%20-%200610.pdf}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite her occasional use of terms that are now considered ethnic slurs, it is clear she was vehemently opposed to segregation and considered it incompatible with socialism. Her disillusionment in this regard echoes her earlier laments about the party's treatment of women.&lt;ref name="nycall" /&gt; In modern terms, she supported an early form of [[intersectionality]].

=== Other activist work ===

In 1914, as head of the Socialist Suffrage Campaign of New York, Malkiel organized a mass meeting at [[Carnegie Hall]]. In 1916, she was one of three women appointed by the National Executive Committee to travel across the country campaigning for suffrage. Although the Socialist party was officially opposed to cooperating with suffragist organizations such as the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]], Malkiel supported the idea, stipulating that socialists should always present their views from a socialist perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1978), pp. 200-201.&lt;/ref&gt; She was suspicious of well-to-do suffragists such as [[Alva Belmont]],&lt;ref name="adickes"&gt;Adickes (2000), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; and warned against being distracted by the "[[false consciousness]]" of [[bourgeois]] feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Gerald |last1=Sorin |authorlink=Gerald Sorin |website=Jewish Women's Archive |title=Socialism in the United States |url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/socialism-in-united-states}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malkiel went on two national tours for the Socialist party during [[World War I]], speaking on women's rights and against American involvement in the war. In 1920 she ran for the [[New York State Assembly]] on the Socialist ticket and was narrowly defeated.&lt;ref name="taitz" /&gt;

== Adult education ==

Malkiel spent the last two decades of her life promoting education for immigrant women and assisting them with [[naturalization]]. She founded the Brooklyn Adult Students Association and directed its classes and summer camp.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1978), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

She married attorney and fellow socialist Leon A. Malkiel in 1900 and moved to Yonkers. She gave birth to a daughter, Henrietta, in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Basch (1990), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Although no longer a factory worker herself, she remained committed to improving the lives of working women. She died on November 17, 1949.&lt;ref name="taitz" /&gt;

[[Image:UNU-OP's Office Building at UNESCO.jpg|thumb|UNU Office at UNESCO building]]
The '''United Nations University Office at UNESCO''' serves as academic interface between the [[United Nations University|United Nations University (UNU)]] and its [http://www.unu.edu/system/centres.html Institutes] and [[UNESCO]] and its [https://web.archive.org/web/20100707080126/http://erc.unesco.org/portal/PermanentDelegations.asp?language=en Permanent Delegations] in [[Paris|Paris, France]]. The UNU Office at [[UNESCO]] also develops contacts between UNU and other [[Paris]]-based international organisations as well with [[France|French]] [[academia]].

The aim of the UNU Office at [[UNESCO]] is to make UNU a [[Stakeholder (law)|stakeholder]]{{dn|date=August 2018}} and a full-fledged partner of the [[UNESCO]] system and the diplomatic environment in [[Paris]].
The Office seeks to strengthen existing cooperation and to explore potential joint projects in areas of mutual interest to the two organisations.

To this end, the UNU Office at [[UNESCO]] organises public events aimed at presenting UNU’s activities. It represents UNU at meetings of [[UNESCO]], particularly the spring session of the [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/executive-board/sessions/introduction/ Executive Board] and the [http://www.unesco.org/en/general-conference-35th-session/general-conference/ General Conference], major world conferences as well as more informal meetings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="797">The '''Vorarlberg School of Architecture''' (German: ''Vorarlberger Schule'') refers to a group of architects and builders founded in 1657 by [[Johann Michael Beer]] in the [[Austria]]n town of [[Au im Bregenzerwald]]. The school remained active in southern [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]] until the end of the 18th century. Its most important members came from the Beer, Moosbrugger and Thumb families. The Vorarlberg School developed a distinct design for churches known as ''Vorarlberger Münsterschema''. The school is notable for the its skillful blending of buildings (most of which are abbeys) with the surrounding landscape.

'''Yara Yavelberg ''' (May 7, 1943 – August 20, 1971) was a [[Brazil]]ian [[psychologist]] and university lecturer, member of the Brazilian resistance movement against the [[Brazilian military government]]. She was believed to have committed suicide in [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]], Bahia in 1971, but a recent autopsy has shown that she has been murdered by security agents.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

==Biography==
Yara Yavelberg was born in [[São Paulo]]. She was initially a passive supporter of the resistance movement, but eventually became a member of [[MR-8]]. She had a relationship with [[Carlos Lamarca]], a Brazilian Army officer who deserted and became one of the most important leaders of the guerrilla movement that opposed the dictatorship. With the collapse of the guerrilla movement, Yavelberg and Lamarca fled to [[Bahia]].

==Homages==
[[University of São Paulo]]'s Psychology Institute paid a homage to Yavelberg, an alumnus of their Psychology School, by naming its academic center the Yara Yavelberg Academic Center.

She was a friend of the former Brazilian president [[Dilma Rousseff]], who paid a tribute to her during the launch of her candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.estadao.com.br/noticias/impresso,indicada-pre-candidata-do-pt-dilma-prega-estado-forte,513970.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zoological Collection Rostock''' ('''ZSRO''', German: '''Zoologische Sammlung Rostock''') is a scientific university collection and associated with the [[Zoology|zoological]] department of the [[University of Rostock]], Germany. The collection was founded in 1775 by [[Oluf Gerhard Tychsen]] and is used both for teaching and research. Parts of the collection are open to the public.

== History ==
[[File:Zoolog. Inst. HRO-20160411 195759.jpg|thumb|Plaque at the Zoological Institute of the Rostock University]]
The zoological collection was founded in 1775 by Oluf Gerhard Tychsen, an orientalist and head librarian of the University of Rostock.&lt;ref&gt;Kinzelbach, Ragnar: Die Zoologische Sammlung der Universität Rostock in: Stier und Greif. Blätter zur Kultur- und Landesgeschichte in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Schwerin, Band 13 (2003), S. 196-197&lt;/ref&gt; In 1789, the collection became part of the “Academic Museum”. It was relocated to the Universitätsplatz in 1844 after the adoption of parts of the collection of the grand duke in [[Ludwigslust]]. The zoological collection is still located at the Universitätsplatz. Since 2002, it features a public exhibition room with changing special exhibitions.

The collection holds about 140.000 series of [[taxa]] from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.zoologie.uni-rostock.de/zoologische-sammlung/zoologische-sammlung/ Homepage of the zoological collection] (German)&lt;/ref&gt; The collection focus includes mollusca (ca. 14.000), Polychaeta (ca. 2.500), fish (ca. 2.500), birds (ca. 2.400), and scorpions (ca. 1.000). Furthermore, the collection owns important historical teaching models, including models by the [[Blaschka]] brothers and Ziegler wax models. It is also home to the ''Rostocker [[Pfeilstorch]]'', which provided early evidence for long-distance migration by storks.
