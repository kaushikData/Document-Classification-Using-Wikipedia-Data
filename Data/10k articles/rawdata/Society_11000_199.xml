'''African Swedish ''' include [[Naturalization|naturalized]] [[Citizenship|citizens]] and residents of [[Sweden]] who were born in [[Africa]]. As of 2016, there are 110,758 people of at least partial African descent, or residents of [[African countries]], in Sweden.&lt;ref name="Citzp"/&gt;

==History==
African immigrants have been living in Sweden since the 17th century,&lt;ref name=Diakite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelundian.com/afroswedes.pdf|title=African diasporas in Sweden: An unfinished history|work=The Lundian|first=Madubuko A.|last=Diakité|year=2005|access-date=2010-08-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717011548/http://www.thelundian.com/afroswedes.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in very few numbers. In 1900, there were 79 Africans in Sweden, of which 5, all South Africans, were citizens.&lt;ref name=Tabeller/&gt;  One of the early documented Africans in Sweden was [[Gustav Badin]], (1747 or 1750 to 1822), a black court-servant and diarist, originally a slave, butler of [[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia|Queen of Sweden, Louisa Ulrika]] and later [[Sophia Albertina, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Princess Sophia Albertine of Sweden]].&lt;ref name=Diakite/&gt;

In the 1880s, a circus performer named John Hood moved from the US to Sweden. It is unclear if John Hood was of complete African descent or if he was half-European. Hood was the great-great-grandfather of Frederik Reinfeldt, who was prime minister of Sweden from 2006-2014. With either 1/16 or 1/32 African blood, Reinfeldt was the first head of state in any European country to be known to have black ancestry.


The 1970s, 1980s and 1990s saw increasing immigration from Africa, often as a consequence of [[civil war]]s.&lt;ref name="Invandring"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.scb.se/statistik/_publikationer/BE0701_1950I02_BR_BE51ST0405.pdf|chapter=Invandring och utvandring för grupperav länder|title=Efterkrigstidens invandring och utvandring|trans-title=Immigration and Emigration in the Postwar Period|language=Swedish|first=Åke|last=Nilsson|year=2004|publisher=Statistiska centralbyrån|location=Stockholm|pages=32–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish statistical data show that the African-born population has grown from 596 in 1960 to 4,149 in 1970, to 10,025 in 1980, 27,343 in 1990, 55,138 in 2000 and 103,077 in 2009.&lt;ref name=Tabeller&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scb.se/statistik/_publikationer/BE0101_2009A01_BR_BE0110TAB.pdf|title=Tabeller över Sveriges befolkning 2009|language=Swedish|trans-title=Tables on the population in Sweden 2009|date=June 2010|publisher=Statistiska centralbyrån|location=Örebro|pages=20–27|issn=1654-4358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption==
Swedish families have been adopting children from [[Ethiopia]] since 1969. Between 1969 and 2005, 1,015 Ethiopian children found new parents in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mia.eu/publikationer/MIAblad/MIAinfo1_2006/ursprungslander.htm|title=Information och intryck från några ursprungsländer|trans-title=Information and impressions from some countries of origin|language=sv|publisher=mia.eu|accessdate=28 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720164735/http://www.mia.eu/publikationer/MIAblad/MIAinfo1_2006/ursprungslander.htm|archivedate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest in adopting children from [[Africa]] has been increasing, with increases in the numbers of children adopted from [[South Africa]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Madagascar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/fler-villiga-adoptera-aldre-barn-1.1072915 |title=Fler villiga adoptera äldre barn |trans-title=More willing to adopt older children |language=sv |publisher=dn.se |date=6 April 2010 |accessdate=27 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410083206/http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/fler-villiga-adoptera-aldre-barn-1.1072915 |archivedate=10 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[News anchor]] [[Katarina Sandström]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/wendela/article131675.ab|title=När jag var riktigt liten ville jag bli präst|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; TV-comedian [[Marika Carlsson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eventnews.se/Nyheter091022.html|title=eventnews.se nyheter 091022 Intervju med Marika Carlsson|website=www.eventnews.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; and restaurateur and celebrity chef [[Marcus Samuelsson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starchefs.com/chefs/MSamuelsson/html/bio.shtml|title=Marcus Samuelsson ofAquavit : Biography and Swedish Recipes on StarChefs|website=www.starchefs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; are three well-known Swedes adopted from [[Ethiopia]].

== History ==
[[Image:الفلكلور الشعبى فى مصر 28 (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|upright|A dancer dancing Raqs Baladi in Cairo]]
Historically, dance has always been an important part of [[Arab culture]]. One of the oldest social dances enjoyed by the [[Arab people]] in the Middle East and North Africa of all ages and sexes at ceremonial events named Raqs Baladi means in ({{lang-ar|بلدي|translit=baladī|translit-std=ALA|link=no}}&lt;span style="margin-left:3px"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Nisba|relative]]-adjective "of town", "local", "rural", comparable to English "[[:wikt:folk#Adjective|folk]]", with a lower-class connotation). During the series of invasions on the Arab world, Europeans were influenced by Arab culture, During the [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria]] in 1798, Europeans were interested in the Arab world. In the middle of the 19th century, the Arab lands, especially the [[Levant]], [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Egypt]] were collectively referred to as the East. The Middle East attracted European painters and writers in the 19th century who came to be orientalists, among the most prominent personalities are [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], [[Eugène Delacroix]] and [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buonaventura|first1=Wendy|title=Serpent of the Nile : women and dance in the Arab world|date=2010|publisher=Saqi|location=London|isbn=0863566286|edition=[Newly updated ed.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Oriental motion has undoubtedly contributed to the misconception of the popular dance as a dance of temptation, conducted for the pleasure of men. In fact, because of the traditional gender segregation, women in the Middle East usually dance only in the women's company between parents and friends. Sometimes a professional dancer and musicians were invited to the women's Caucus. Today, gender segregation is not strictly practised in many urban areas, and sometimes both men and women dance socially at family and/or community events.

Arabic dance was performed in the United States in 1893 at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]], which included an exhibition entitled "The streets of Cairo". The exhibition was attended by dancers from several [[Arab countries]] from the Middle East and North Africa, including [[Syria]] and [[Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/arts/design/a-wriggle-in-time-historical-artifacts-of-belly-dancing.html|title=A Wriggle in Time: Historical Artifacts of Belly Dancing|last=Kahn|first=Eve M.|date=2016-11-10|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "belly dancing" is often credited to [[Sol Bloom]], its entertainment director, but referred to the dance as ''danse du ventre'', the name used by the French in Algeria. In his memoirs, Bloom states, "when the public learned that the literal translation was "belly dance", they delightedly concluded that it must be salacious and immoral...I had a gold mine."&lt;ref&gt;Donna Carlton (1995) ''Looking for Little Egypt''.

''Ardah'' ({{lang-ar|العرضة|translit=al-‘arḍah|translit-std=ALA-LC}}) is a type of [[folkloric]] [[dance]] in [[Arabia]].

The term 'Ardah' is thought to derive from the [[Arabic]] verb ''ard'' meaning 'to show' or 'to parade'. It was so named because its purpose was to publicly display the fighting strength of a tribe and boost morale before an armed engagement.&lt;ref name="urkevich1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Urkevich|first=Lisa|title=Music and Traditions of the Arabian Peninsula: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gy-cBQAAQBAJ|format=Google Play|page=131/689|chapter=5|publisher=Routledge|date=19 December 2014|isbn=978-0415888721}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are regional variations of the particular rendition of ardah, the purpose it serves is nearly identical throughout the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref name="urkevich1"/&gt;

The '''Aragonese''' ([[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] and {{lang-es|aragoneses}}, {{lang-ca|aragonesos}}) are the people self-identified with the [[region|historical region]] of [[Aragon]], in inland northeastern [[Spain]]. Their [[Aragonese language]], which might have been spoken in the whole of the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Navarre]] and [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]] in the [[Middle Ages]], is nowadays a seriously [[endangered language]], natively spoken only by a few thousands in some northern villages. 

Most Aragonese (90% or more) speak the [[Spanish language]] in its northern form but with some regional traits, particularly in intonation and vocabulary. The use of the native Aragonese language is decreasing and maybe dying out. In the easternmost areas, [[La Franja]], varieties of the [[Catalan language]] are spoken by about 90% of the Population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.gencat.net/llengcat/socio/docs/EULF2004.pdf Statistics about languages in Catalan-Speaking Aragon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920000405/http://www6.gencat.net/llengcat/socio/docs/EULF2004.pdf |date=September 20, 2009 }} [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Australian English]] is a major variety of the [[English language]] spoken throughout [[Australia]]. Most of the vocabulary of Australian English is shared with [[British English]], though there are notable differences.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Hennings, Australian and New Zealand impact on the English language, 2004, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The vocabulary of Australia is drawn from many sources, including various dialects of British English as well as [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic languages]], some [[Indigenous Australian languages]], and [[Polynesian languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://crsi.mq.edu.au/public/download.jsp?id=10585 |title=International Students: Negotiating life and study in Australia through Australian Englishes |author=Macquarie University |year=2007 |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first dictionaries of Australian slang was [[Karl Lentzner]]'s ''Dictionary of the Slang-English of Australia and of Some Mixed Languages'' in 1892.{{Primary source-inline|date=September 2013}} The first dictionary based on historical principles that covered Australian English was [[E. E. Morris]]'s ''Austral English: A Dictionary of Australasian Words, Phrases and Usages'' (1898). In 1981, the more comprehensive [[Macquarie Dictionary|''Macquarie Dictionary of Australian English'']] was published. Oxford University Press published their own ''[[Australian Oxford Dictionary]]'' in 1999, as a joint effort with the [[Australian National University]]. Oxford University Press also published ''[[The Australian National Dictionary]]''.

It has been claimed that, in recent times, the popularity of the [[Barry McKenzie]] character, played on screen by [[Barry Crocker]], and in particular of the soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'', led to a "huge shift in the attitude towards Australian English in the UK", with such phrases as "chunder", "liquid laugh" and "technicolour yawn" all becoming well-known as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27805070|title=The rise and fall of Australian slang|first=Jon|last=Donnison|date=11 June 2014|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=30 August 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Words of Australian origin ==

The Australian English term ''[[Outback]]'' means a "remote, sparsely-populated area". ''[[Jackaroo (trainee)|Jackaroo]]'' is a type of agricultural worker.&lt;ref name="anu"/&gt;

A ''Battler'' is a person with few natural advantages, who works doggedly and with little reward, who struggles for a livelihood and who displays courage. The first citation for this comes from [[Henry Lawson]] in While the Billy Boils (1896):&lt;blockquote&gt;I sat on him pretty hard for his pretensions, and paid him out for all the patronage he'd worked off on me... and told him never to pretend to me again he was a battler.&lt;ref name="anu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andc.anu.edu.au/australian-words/meanings-origins?field_alphabet_value=71 |title=Meanings and origins of Australian words and idioms |publisher=Australian National Dictionary Centre, ANU College of Arts &amp; Social Sciences |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The origins of other terms are not as clear, or are disputed. ''Dinkum'' or ''fair dinkum'' means "true", "the truth", "speaking the truth", "authentic" and related meanings, depending on context and inflection. The Evening News (Sydney, NSW) 23 August 1879 has one of the earliest references to ''fair dinkum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Morning Gallops|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article107161756 |date=August 23, 1879| accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It originated with a now-extinct dialect word from the [[East Midlands]] in England, where ''dinkum'' (or ''dincum'') meant "hard work" or "fair work", which was also the original meaning in Australian English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/ozwords/November_98/7._dinkum.htm |title=The dinkum oil on dinkum: Where does it come from? |publisher=Australian National University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020511010247/http://www.anu.edu.au/ANDC/Ozwords/November_98/7._dinkum.htm |archivedate=2002-05-11 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Digger (soldier)|Digger]] is an Australian soldier. The term was applied during the First World War to Australian and New Zealand soldiers because so much of their time was spent digging trenches. An earlier Australian sense of digger was "a miner digging for gold". [[Billy Hughes]], prime minister during the First World War, was known as the Little Digger. First recorded in this sense 1916.&lt;ref name="anu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="immi"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.immi.gov.au/living-in-australia/values/book/english/lia_english_full.pdf |title=Life in Australia |author=Department of Immigration &amp; Citizenship |year=2007 |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fair go'' is a reasonable chance, a fair deal. Australia often sees itself as an egalitarian society, the land of the fair go, where all citizens have a right to fair treatment.&lt;ref name="anu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="immi"/&gt;

A "[[wikt:yobo|Yobo]]," also spelled [[Yobbo]], is someone who tends to be loud and obnoxious, lacks in social skills and general behaviour. A Yobbo can also apply to someone who over indulges in alcohol and may have little or no regard for his/her appearance. Historically (1970-1990) Yobbos have also been known to have hairstyles such as the '[[Mullet (haircut)|Mullet]]' or '[[Rattail (haircut)|Rattails]]'. May also be shortened to Yob.

A [[bogan]] is another term for describing someone who is a Yobbo, although may have subtle regional differences such as "Bevan" in and around [[Brisbane]] (although bogan is more commonly used), and "Boonah" around [[Canberra]]. The major difference between the two is that Yobbo tends to be used as a noun, whereas bogan is a noun that is also used adjectively and can describe objects that are pertaining to people who are themselves bogan (or Yobbo).

=== Words of Australian Aboriginal origin ===
{{Main|List of English words of Australian Aboriginal origin}}
Some elements of [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal languages]] have been incorporated into [[Australian English]], mainly as names for flora and fauna (for example [[koala]], [[dingo]], [[kangaroo]]).

Some examples are ''[[cooee]]'' and ''yakka''. The former is a high-pitched call ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|uː|iː}}) which travels long distances and is used to attract attention, which has been derived from [[Darug|Dharug]], an Aboriginal language spoken in the Sydney region.&lt;ref name="anu2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andc.anu.edu.au/australian-words/meanings-origins?field_alphabet_value=71|title=Meanings and origins of Australian words and idioms|publisher=Australian National Dictionary Centre, ANU College of Arts &amp; Social Sciences|accessdate=2013-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cooee'' has also become a notional distance: ''if he's within cooee, we'll spot him''. ''Yakka'' means work, strenuous labour, and comes from 'yaga' meaning 'work' in the [[Turrubal language|Yagara]] indigenous language of the Brisbane region. Yakka found its way into nineteenth-century Australian pidgin, and then passed into Australian English. First recorded 1847.&lt;ref name="anu"/&gt;

''[[Boomerang]]'' is an Australian word which has moved into International English. It was also borrowed from [[Darug|Dharug]].&lt;ref name="anu"/&gt;

''[[Didgeridoo]]'' is a wind instrument that was originally found only in [[Arnhem Land]] in northern Australia. It is a long, wooden, tubular instrument that produces a low-pitched, resonant sound with complex, rhythmic patterns but little tonal variation.&lt;ref name="anu"/&gt;

== Words of British and Irish origin ==

Many such words, phrases or usages originated with British and Irish settlers to Australia from the 1780s until the present. For example: a ''[[Stream|creek]]'' in Australia (as in [[North America]]), is any "[[stream]] or small [[river]]", whereas in England it is a small watercourse flowing into the [[sea]]; ''paddock'' is the Australian word for "[[Field (agriculture)|field]]", while in England it is a small enclosure for [[livestock]]. ''[[The Bush|Bush]]'' (as in North America) or ''scrub'' means "wooded areas" or "country areas in general" in Australia, while in England they are commonly used only in proper names (such as [[Shepherd's Bush]] and [[Wormwood Scrubs]]). Australian English and several [[British English]] dialects (e.g., [[Cockney]], [[Scouse]], [[Geordie]]) use the word ''[[Mate (colloquialism)|mate]]'' to mean a friend, rather than the conventional meaning of "a spouse", although this usage has also become common in some other varieties of English.

''Fair dinkum —'' Reliable; genuine; honest; true comes from British dialect. It is recorded from [[Lincolnshire]], England in 1881, and is the equivalent of West Yorkshire fair doos fair dealing. The adjective is first recorded in Australia from the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slll.cass.anu.edu.au/centres/andc/meanings-origins/d School of Literature, Languages and Linguistics] - Meanings and origins of Australian words and idioms&lt;/ref&gt;

''G'day —'' a greeting, meaning "good day".&lt;ref name="immi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian English - British English|url=http://www.englisch-hilfen.de/en/words/australian_british_english.htm|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[wikt:sheila|Sheila]] —'' Australian slang for "woman", is derived from the [[Irish language|Irish]] girls' name ''Síle'' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPAc-ga|s'|í|l'|@}}, anglicised ''Sheila'').

''Bludger'' — A person who avoids working, or doing their share of work, a loafer, a hanger-on, one who does not pull his weight. Originally, a pimp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andc.anu.edu.au/ozwords/December%202001/Bludger.html |title=ANU: Ozwords December 20 2001 |publisher=ANU|date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Billy'' — a tin or enamel cooking pot with a lid and wire handle, used outdoors, especially for making tea. It comes from the Scottish dialect word billy meaning "cooking utensil".&lt;ref name="anu"/&gt;

''Manchester'' (frequently lower-case) –  [[household linen]] (sheets, pillow cases etc.), as in "manchester department" of a department store. From "Manchester wares" with exactly the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Australian National Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=1988|isbn=0195547365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rhyming slang ==

Rhyming slang is more common in older generations; it is similar, and in some cases identical, to [[Cockney rhyming slang]], for example ''plates'' (of meat) for "feet" and ''china'' (plate) for "mate". Some specifically Australian examples are ''dead horse'' for "sauce",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article130807689 |title=The Cockneys Started It |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]] |volume=59, |issue=9,024 |location=South Australia |date=11 July 1952 |accessdate=28 October 2017 |page=13 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Jack Holt'' for "salt" (one famous [[Jack Holt (trainer)|Jack Holt]] was a horse trainer, another a boxing promoter), ''Barry Crocker'' for "shocker" ([[Barry Crocker|Crocker]] is a well-known entertainer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andc.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/ozwords_oct05.pdf |title=OzWords: When People Become Words |publisher=Australian National Dictionary Centre, [[Australian National University]] |date=October 2005 |accessdate=20 February 2010 |format=pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409200400/http://andc.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/ozwords_oct05.pdf |archive-date=9 April 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chunder'' for "vomit" most likely comes from ''Chunder Loo'' = "spew" ("Chunder Loo of Akim Foo" was a [[Norman Lindsay]] character; "[[wikt:spew|spew]]" is synonym for "vomit").&lt;ref&gt;{{ShorterOxfordEnglishDictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andc.anu.edu.au/pubs/ozwords/June2002/Aussiewords.html|title=Aussie words: chunder|author=Frederick Ludowyk|publisher=National Dictionary Centre|access-date=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diminutives and abbreviations==
{{Main article|Diminutives in Australian English}}Australian English vocabulary draws heavily on [[diminutive]]s and abbreviations. These may be confusing to foreign speakers when they are used in everyday conversations.

There are over 5,000 identified diminutives in use. While other English dialects use diminutives in a similar way, none are so prolific or diverse. A large number of these are widely recognised and used by Australian English speakers. However, many are used only by specific demographic groups or in localised areas. Researchers are now beginning to study what psychological motivations cause Australians to abbreviate so many words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2010/08/why-we-shorten-barbie,-footy-and-arvo/ Why we shorten words], Australian Geographic, 2 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colloquial phrases==

Numerous idiomatic phrases occur in Australian usage, some more historical than contemporary in usage. [[Send her down, Hughie]] is an example.

==Alcohol==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Australian English]] --&gt;
''Amber'' is generic term for any beer (lager/stout/ale) in general, but especially cold and on-tap.&lt;br /&gt;

Not only has there been a wide variety of measures in which [[beer]] is served in [[pub]]s in Australia, the names of these glasses differ from one area to another. However, the range of glasses has declined greatly in recent years.

==Pre-decimal currency==
Prior to [[Decimalization#Australia and New Zealand|decimalization]], Australian monetary units closely reflected British usage: four farthings (obsolete by 1945) or two halfpence to a penny; 12 pence to a shilling; 20 shillings to a pound, but terms for the coinage were uniquely Australian, particularly among working-class adult males:
"Brown": a penny (1d.); "Tray": threepence (3d.); "Zac": sixpence (6d.); "Bob" or "Deener": a shilling (1s.); "Two bob bit": a florin (2s.)

Slang terms for notes mostly followed British usage: "Ten bob note": ten shillings (10s.); "Quid" (or "fiddly did"): pound note (₤1); "Fiver": five pound note (₤5); "Tenner" or "Brick": ten pound note (₤10). Other terms have been recorded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article133189353 |title=What's the Reason for this Rhyme? |newspaper=[[Newcastle Morning Herald And Miners' Advocate]] |issue=23,640 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=12 July 1952 |accessdate=28 October 2017 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rarely used outside the racetrack.  One confusing matter is that five shillings prior to decimal currency was called a "Dollar", in reference to the Spanish Dollar and "Holey Dollar" which circulated at a value of five shillings, but the Australian Dollar at the introduction of decimal currency was fixed at 10 shillings.

Australia has four codes of football, [[rugby league]], [[rugby union]], [[Australian rules football]], and [[Association football|soccer]]. Generally, rugby league is called football in New South Wales and Queensland, while rugby union is called either rugby or union throughout. Both rugby league and rugby union are often collectively referred to as rugby in other states where Australian rules football is called football. Association football was long known as ''soccer'' in Australia. In 2005, the governing body changed its name to [[Football Federation Australia]]. Association Football in Australia is called 'football' only when mentioned in conjunction with a specific league, such as the A-League or Premier League, meaning either Australian football or rugby on its own depending on the region of Australia.

[[Image:Kronjuwelen2, Schatzkammer Residenz München.jpg|thumb|280px|Royal regalia of Bavaria]]
The '''Bavarian Crown Jewels''' are a set of [[crown jewels]] created for the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], which existed from 1806 to 1918.  In 1806, as part of his wholescale re-ordering of the map of [[Europe]], [[Napoléon I of France|Emperor Napoléon I of the French]] upgraded the independent [[Germany|German]] [[duchy]] of [[Bavaria]] to full [[monarchy|kingdom]] status. The former ''Duke of Bavaria'', now [[King of Bavaria]], [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Maximilian I]], commemorated the fact by commissioning a set of [[crown jewels]] for use by Bavarian monarchs.  However, there was no coronation ceremony, and the king never wore the crown in public. Rather, it was placed on a cushion when displayed on occasions such as the king's ascension or his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.residenz-muenchen.de/englisch/treasury/pic01.htm |title=Bavarian Palace Department &amp;#124; Munich Residenz &amp;#124; Treasury &amp;#124; Picture gallery |publisher=Residenz-muenchen.de |date= |accessdate=2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Included in the regalia were:
* The [[Crown of Bavaria]] - the King's crown, which was set with [[Ruby|rubies]], [[diamond]]s, [[emerald]]s, [[sapphire]]s and [[pearl]]s;
* the Crown of the Queens of Bavaria, which was made for the then queen, [[Karoline of Baden]], and which contains huge pearls and large diamonds;
* The 96 centimetre long [[sword of state|State Sword]];
* The Royal [[Globus cruciger|Orb]] - made of [[gold]];
* The 89 centimetre long Royal Sceptre set with brilliants, emeralds and sapphires and the top is surmounted by a small round crown.

The [[Palatinate Pearl]] is also kept with the crown jewels, however it is not officially part of the collection. As a result of the First World War, the German monarchies were abolished in 1918 and since then, Bavaria has not had a monarch. The Bavarian Crown Jewels are currently on display in the Treasury of the [[Residenz, Munich|Residenz]] [[palace]] in [[Munich]].

The '''Bharwad''' are a [[Hindu]] [[caste]] found in the state of [[Gujarat]] in India.

== Etymology ==
The Bharwad name may derive from the [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] word ''badawad'', constructed from ''bada'' (sheep) and ''wada'' (a compound or enclosure). ''[[Gadaria]]'' is another word that may have the same origin. In the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra region]] of western Gujarat they exist as two [[endogamy|endogamous]] groups, known as the Mota Bhai (Motabhai) and the Nana Bhai (Nanabhai). According to the [[Anthropological Survey of India]]'s ''People of India'' series, Bharwads in the Saurashtra region often append ''[[Ahir]]'' to their names, while in south Gujarat it is common to see ''[[Patel]]'' appended.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}

== Origin ==
The Bharwads consider themselves to be descended from the mythological [[Nandvanshi]] line that began with [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]], the foster-father of [[Krishna]]. Legend has it that Nanda came from [[Gokul]], in [[Mathura district]], and passed through Saurashtra on his way to [[Dwarka]].{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}} According to their traditions, the Bharwads were at some time based around [[Mathura]] and migrated to [[Mewar]] before later spreading out in Gujarat.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} Sudipta Mitra considers their move to Gujarat to have been predicated by a desire to keep away from the [[Muslim]] invasion of [[Sind]]. They arrived in the northern town of [[Banaskantha]] in 961 CE and later spread out to Saurashtra and other areas.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}}

There are other theories of origin. These include that they are an offshoot of the [[Bharude]] cattle-herders of [[Madhya Pradesh]] and that they are descendants of Anavil Bharwad, who helped a [[Chavda]] prince regain his kingdom. It is also possible that they are related to the Ahirs of Gujarat, with whom they share a common traditional occupation.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}

== Divisions ==
Of the various reasons given for the division between Motabhai and Nanabhai, the most popular is that two shepherd brothers were ordered by [[Krishna]] to take their flocks to different places. The older of the brothers went on to marry a Bharwad woman while the other married a [[Koli people|Koli]]. Since the latter was a marriage outside the community, the offspring were deemed to be [[untouchability|ritually polluted]]. Thus the Motabhai (literally, "big brother") descend from the first and the Nanabhai ("little brother") from the latter.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=147|ps=}}

The Bharwads have numerous subgroups known as ''ataks'' or ''guls'' (clans) whose main purpose is to determine eligibility for marriage. A constrained [[exogamy]] is practised between clans{{efn|For example, the Rathadia, Jadav and Yadav clans of the Mota Bhai consider that they are socially superior to the other clans and will only marry between themselves.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}}} but endogamy exists between the two Saurashtrian divisions despite there being no other social constraints on mixing. The Saurashtra Bharwads also hold a higher status than those in the south and thus marriage between the two regional groups operates in one direction only: daughters of southern Bharwads can marry into the family of those from Saurashtra.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}

&lt;!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY FURTHER CLANS HERE UNLESS THEY ARE SOURCED--&gt;
Clans of the Mota Bhai Bharwads include the Babha, Bathela, Colthar, Dabi, Dhangia, Dharangia, Garia, Gomara, Jadav, Kathodi, Ker, Lambari, Matia, Mundhva, Pancha, Rathadia, Zampda, Sania, Sasda, Tota and Yadav.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}

Among the Bharwad of south Gujarat, their main clans are the Chandulka, Dahika, Gundarya, Jodika, Kalwamia, Khohadya, Kuhadiya and Rokadka.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}
&lt;!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY FURTHER CLANS HERE UNLESS THEY ARE SOURCED--&gt;

== Varna and socio-economic status ==
The [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]] system of Hinduism is a traditional ritual ranking system based on levels of purported religious purity. Within this four-fold scheme, the Bharwads consider themselves to be [[Vaishya]] but they also believe themselves to be equal to [[Rajput]] communities that are generally considered to be of the more pure [[Kshatriya]] varna. They also believe themselves to be of a higher ritual status than [[artisan]] groups such as the [[Lohar]]s and [[Suthar]]s.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}

Despite their own beliefs, the Bharwads are generally treated within regional society as being somewhat below the [[Brahmin]], [[Bania (caste)|Vania]], [[Lohana]], Patel, [[Charan]] and [[Dharjee]] communities.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} Mitra notes that they are generally considered to be among the lowest of the pastoral castes, being engaged primarily in the herding of goats and sheep.{{efn|Some Bharwads are cattle-herders but their number is declining.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}}}} However, although one of the [[Maldhari]] nomadic communities, they are also among the most urbanised of the region and, combined with their niche position in the supply of milk, which forms their main source of income, this has enabled them to improve their traditional social position.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|pp=65, 84|ps=}}

== Customs ==

=== Religion ===
The Bharwad are Hindu, and like other Hindu pastoral communities pay special reverence to Krishna. Each clan also has its own deity, while their chief goddess is Masu Mata. Their most sacred place is at [[Morbi]] and they also make pilgrimages to place such as Dwarka. Some Bharwads in the south have become [[vegetarian]] as a consequence of outside influences.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}

=== Family arrangements ===
Members of the community practice [[monogamy]] and [[arranged marriage]]s are traditional, usually accompanied by a ritualised exchange of gifts between the partners.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} There is anecdotal evidence that ''pet chandla'' (marriage of children while they are still in the womb) is practised by some members of the community.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=272|ps=}} In other cases, a ''sagai'' (engagement) ceremony takes place when children are aged 2–3, with the marriage age usually being between 18-20 for women and 20-22 for men.{{efn|Marriages of six-year-olds have been recorded but most do not marry so young.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=155, 253|ps=}}}} Remarriage in situations where the couple are childless requires the consent of the wife, and divorce is not usually tolerated except in this situation and that of mental infirmity. Remarriage upon widowhood is also accepted but men are expected generally to prefer a younger unmarried sister of their late wife.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}

Married couples live in a [[patrilocal]] arrangement. The Bharwads practice male [[equigeniture]], meaning that property is inherited equally by the male children, and it is the eldest son who becomes head of household on the death of the father. Women have no rights of inheritance over property. Although consulted, they also have no final say in the making of significant decisions.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}

=== Clothing ===
The Bharwads practice "sartorial conservatism", according to Emma Tarlo, and it is not enough to be born a Bharwad if a person wants to be accepted as one: conforming with standards of dress and other customs is a necessity if a person is not to be considered a deserter from the community.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=258, 262-263|ps=}} The details of clothing&amp;nbsp;— in terms of style, colour and material&amp;nbsp;— have changed over time while retaining a distinct Bharwad character. Despite it being a relatively recent practice, the wearing of pink and red shawls by both women and men is one of the most obvious identifiers of the modern community and they are worn even by those who shun the other aspects of the Bharwadi dress code in favour of Western styles.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=271-272|ps=}} The desire to identify through clothing and also through [[tattoo]]s may be a reflection of the community's traditional itinerant lifestyle, whereby a means of recognising their fellows was a significant social factor.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=273|ps=}}

The clothing worn by Bharwad women was traditionally made from coarse wool woven by members of local [[Untouchability|untouchable]] communities. In addition, they embroidered their own open-backed [[bodice]]s. The garments at that time&amp;nbsp;— as late as the early 20th century&amp;nbsp;— comprised the bodice, an unstitched black or red waist-cloth, known as a ''jimi'', and a veil. Motabhai clothing was made from thicker wool than that of the Nanabhai, leading to the two groups referring to themselves as "thick cloth" and "thin cloth". The veil was dyed black and bore red dots if the woman was a Motabhai and yellow if she was Nanabhai. While the styles and colours remain similar, modern Bharwad women use [[man-made fibre]]s, such as [[polyester]], and cotton. This change may be in part because the modern materials are of finer texture but it is more likely than it came about because of their relative cheapness. Cost is an important factor among the generally penurious community and women could sell the woollen fabric that they had used for clothing for a greater price than they paid for the replacement man-made fabric clothes.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=xiii, 147, 267|ps=}} Tarlo quotes a Bharwad woman saying that "If you wear a sari then you can no longer be called a Bharwad. That is the way it is among our caste. Better to die than change your clothes."{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=257|ps=}}

The men commonly wear a silver ear-ring, called a ''variya'', and a [[pagri (turban)]]. The length of the turban differs between the two divisions,{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} and there are numerous ways of tying them. A white turban, rather than the more usual pink or red, is a symbol of seniority.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=271|ps=}} Wearing Western-style clothing is still not generally accepted but the traditional three woollen blankets, worn around the head, waist and shoulders, have in many cases been replaced by a cotton ''[[kediyun]]'' together with a ''[[dhoti]]'' or ''[[chorni]]''.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=151|ps=}} As with the women, Carol Henderson notes that {{quote|[Bharwads] say that if a man doesn't wear their dress, he ceases to be Bharwad. Being Bharwad means dressing Bharwad. Bharwad men wear a distinctive short gathered smock with long, tight sleeves, massive wound turban, gathered pantaloons, and a shawl.{{sfnp|Henderson|2002|p=113|ps=}}}}

== Occupations ==
[[Image:Map Guj Gir NatPark Sanctuary.png|thumb|right|Many of the Bharwad community are found in the [[Gir Forest National Park]].]]
Bharwads are rarely educated beyond primary level and literacy rates are poor. Many of them live in and around the [[Gir Forest National Park]], where they tend to keep away from the forest itself when grazing their livestock due to the danger of attacks by [[Asiatic lion]]s. Aside from their involvement with livestock, the main source of income is agricultural labouring; few of them own land.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|pp=65, 84|ps=}}

== Community associations ==
There is a hierarchy of ''nyat [[panchayat]]s'' (community councils) for the resolution of disputes. These are headed by chiefs and comprise several other members. The lowest tier of this are those that operate at the level of a single village or of a group of villages if the Bharwad population is small. Matters that cannot be settled at that level are referred upwards to a regional ''panchayat'' and thereafter to a central body based at [[Rajkot]]. If matters are still not resolved after referral to Rajkot then the parties will seek intervention form law enforcement agencies, although this is rare.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}

There also exists a community welfare association called the Gujarat Rajya Gopalak Sakahari Sangh, which was formed in 1950 at [[Ahmedabad]]. This has worked to document the history and traditions of the Bhardwads and has also established several hundred co-operative societies. In addition, it has worked to bring an end to some traditional social practices that are now deemed to be inappropriate, such as [[bride price]].{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}

The '''Campaign to End the Death Penalty''' (CEDP) is an anti-[[death penalty]] organization in the United States, built on the philosophy that death row inmates and their family members must be at the center of fighting to abolish the death penalty. According to CEDP, "Abolition will not come from the desks of local politicians or the power brokers in Washington, whose lives have likely never been touched by the death penalty and whose careers have often been bolstered by it. Abolition can only come from organizing within communities and from people demanding a change."&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nodeathpenalty.org/about-us |title=About Us |publisher=CEDP |accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
CEDP has chapters in California, Texas, Delaware, New York, and Chicago. {{as of|2016}} it has a staff of five.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; It was founded in 2004&lt;ref name="wcadp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcoalition.org/Campaign-to-End-the-Death-Penalty.html |title=Campaign to End the Death Penalty |publisher=World Coalition Against the Death Penalty |accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is based in Chicago.&lt;ref name="mj"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/california-death-row-inmates-proposition-62 |title=California Has a Plan to Ban Executions, But Death Row Inmates Hate It |last=Patterson |first=Brandon Ellington |journal=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |date=November 3, 2016 |accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEDP is a member of the [[World Coalition Against the Death Penalty]].&lt;ref name="wcadp"/&gt; Its national board includes Yusuf Salaam, one of the since-exonerated [[Central Park 5]], whose death was publicly urged by [[Donald Trump]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="salaam"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/10/trump-central-park-five-jogger-wrongful-conviction/ |title=Defying Trump’s Racist Death Sentence |journal=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]] |date=October 31, 2016 |last1=Katch  |first1=Danny |last2=Salaam |first2=Yusuf |accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CEDP gained prominence in attempting to save [[Stan "Tookie" Williams]], who was executed in California on December 13, 2005, after being denied clemency by governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].  Previously, the CEDP was heavily involved in defending [[Kevin Cooper (inmate)|Kevin Cooper]], a California inmate who was granted a new trial on the day he was scheduled to be executed, as well as Chicago's [[Death Row 10]], death row inmates who the CEDP claims were sentenced on the basis of confessions extracted by police torture.  Four of the Death Row 10 were pardoned in 2002 by then-Illinois governor [[George Ryan]], who also emptied the state's death row in a mass commutation of sentences.

The organization also opposes [[life imprisonment]] without [[parole]]. In 2016 CEDP surveyed death row inmates on their views of two California ballot measures, [[California Proposition 62 (2016)|Propositions 62]]  and [[California Proposition 66 (2016)|66]]. Unsurprisingly, the inmates opposed Proposition 66, which calls for the speed-up of executions in California. However, inmates also opposed Proposition 62, since it enforces life imprisonment without parole, which is characterized by inmates, according to CEDP director Lilly Hughes, as "just a death sentence with a different name."&lt;ref name="mj"/&gt;

There were estimated to be 25,000 '''Cape Verdeans in Senegal''' {{asof|1995|lc=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.umassd.edu/SpecialPrograms/CaboVerde/wwpopest.html |title=Cape Verdean Diaspora Population Estimates |publisher=Caboverde Informatics Project, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth |accessdate=2009-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829094133/http://www.umassd.edu/specialprograms/caboverde/wwpopest.html |archivedate=2009-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration history==
[[Senegal]] became popular as a destination for [[Cape Verde]]an migrants in the 1920s, as immigration to the United States became more difficult as a result of the [[Emergency Quota Act]] of 1921 and then the [[Immigration Act of 1924]]. The United States had previously functioned as an escape route for Cape Verdeans who hoped to avoid coerced migration to other Portuguese colonies such as [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] or [[Angola]]. Portuguese authorities often refused to issue passports or travel permits for other destinations; however, Senegal's proximity to Cape Verde allowed emigrants to travel there in a clandestine fashion. Women typically pursued [[domestic workers|domestic work]] in the homes of French colonists, while the men were employed as artisans. The flow of Cape Verdean emigrants to Dakar continued until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carling|Batalla|2008|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Senegal achieved independence in 1960, some Cape Verdeans followed their French colonist employers to France, augmenting the numbers of Cape Verdeans already found in France in cities such as [[Paris]], [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], and [[Nice]]. However, many others chose to remain in Senegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carling|Batalla|2008|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are roughly 300 people among the Cape Verdean community in Senegal who have migrated back to the land of their ancestors. Most completed their education in Senegal, but then, unable to find suitable work in the country of their birth, came to Cape Verde for work as teachers or in the health field. However, few Cape Verdean parents in Senegal  have followed their children back to Cape Verde.&lt;ref name="Arena" /&gt;

'''Celebrity''' or the slang term celeb, refers to the fame and public attention accorded by the [[mass media]] to individuals or groups or, occasionally, animals, but is usually applied to the persons or groups of people (celebrity couples, families, etc.) themselves who receive such a status of fame and attention. Celebrity status is often associated with [[wealth]] (commonly referred to as ''fame and fortune''), while fame often provides opportunities to earn revenue.

Successful careers in [[sport]]s and [[entertainment]] are commonly associated with celebrity status,&lt;ref name = "I want to be famous "&gt;{{cite news |title= I want to be famous|url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/apr/17/i-want-to-be-famous |publisher= Celebbuzz|date= April 17, 2010|accessdate=November 17, 2011|location=London|first=Emma|last=Brockes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Western world kids want to grow up to be famous Children in developing countries want to be doctors "&gt;{{cite news |title=Western world kids want to grow up to be famous |url=http://www.news1130.com/news/local/article/304123--western-world-kids-want-to-grow-up-to-be-famous |publisher=[[News1130]] |date=November 28, 2011 |accessdate=December 25, 2011 |location=Vancouver |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101230510/http://www.news1130.com/news/local/article/304123--western-world-kids-want-to-grow-up-to-be-famous |archivedate=January 1, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[political leaders]] often become celebrities. People may also become celebrities due to media attention on their lifestyle, wealth, or controversial actions, or for their connection to a famous person.

==History==
Athletes in [[Ancient Greece]] were welcomed home as heroes, had songs and poems written in their honor, and received free food and gifts from those seeking [[celebrity endorsement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ancient Greek Athletics|last = Miller|first = Stephen|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 2004|isbn = 0-300-11529-6|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Rome]] similarly lauded actors and notorious gladiators, and [[Julius Caesar]] appeared on a coin in his own lifetime (a departure from the usual depiction of battles and divine lineage).&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1777554.stm|title = A brief history of celebrity|date = April 4, 2003|accessdate = June 8, 2014|website = BBC News|publisher = BBC|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 12th century, [[Thomas Becket]] became famous following his murder. He was promoted by the Christian Church as a martyr and images of him and scenes from his life became widespread in just a few years. In a pattern often repeated, what started out as an explosion of popularity (often referred to with the suffix 'mania') turned into a long-lasting fame: pilgrimages to Canterbury Cathedral where he was killed became instantly fashionable and the fascination with his life and death have inspired plays and films.

The cult of personality (particularly in the west) can be traced back to the Romantics in the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = A Short History of Celebrity|author = Morgan, Dr Simon|publisher = Princeton University Press|date  = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose livelihood as artists and poets depended on the currency of their reputation. The establishment of cultural hot-spots became an important factor in the process of generating fame: for example, London and Paris in the 18th and 19th centuries. Newspapers started including gossip columns &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/news/concisehistbritnews/britnews19th/ | title = Concise History of the British Newspaper in the Nineteenth Century | publisher = British Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; and certain clubs and events became places to be seen in order to receive publicity.

The movie industry spread around the globe in the first half of the 20th century and with it the now familiar concept of the instantly recognizable faces of its superstars. Yet, celebrity wasn't always tied to actors in films, especially when cinema was starting out as a medium. As Paul McDonald states in ''The Star System: Hollywood's Production of Popular Identities'', "in the first decade of the twentieth century, American film production companies withheld the names of film performers, despite requests from audiences, fearing that public recognition would drive performers to demand higher salaries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Star System: Hollywood's Production of Popular Identities|last = McDonald|first = Paul|publisher = Wallflower|year = 2000|isbn = 978-1-903364-02-4|location = Great Britain|pages = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Public fascination went well beyond the on-screen exploits of [[movie star]]s and their private lives became headline news: for example, in Hollywood the marriages of [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and in [[Bollywood]] the affairs of [[Raj Kapoor]] in the 1950s.

The second half of the century saw television and popular music bring new forms of celebrity, such as the rock star and the pop group, epitomised by [[Elvis Presley]] and [[the Beatles]], respectively. [[John Lennon]]'s highly controversial 1966 quote: "We're more popular than [[Jesus]] now,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.beatlesbible.com/1966/03/04/how-does-a-beatle-live-by-maureen-cleave/ |publisher = London Evening Standard|date  = 1966|author = Cleave, Maureen|title=How does a beatle live}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he later insisted was not a boast, and that he was not in any way comparing himself with Christ,{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=295}} gives an insight into both the adulation and notoriety that fame can bring. Unlike movies, television created celebrities who were not primarily actors; for example, presenters, talk show hosts, and news readers. However, most of these are only famous within the regions reached by their particular broadcaster, and only a few such as [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Jerry Springer]], or [[David Frost]] could be said to have broken through into a wider stardom.

In the '60s and early '70s the book publishing industry began to persuade major celebrities to put their names on autobiographies and other titles in a genre called celebrity publishing. In most cases the book was not written by the celebrity but by a ghost-writer, but the celebrity would then be available for a book tour and appearances on talk shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Another Life: A Memoir of Other People|last=Korda|first=Michael|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=|isbn=9780679456599|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional and cultural implications==
[[File:Lydia Canaan in Concert.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lydia Canaan]], first rock star of the [[Middle East]]]]

Cultures and regions with a significant population may have their own independent celebrity systems, with distinct hierarchies. For example, the Canadian province of [[Quebec]], which is French-speaking, has its own system of French-speaking television, movie and music celebrities. A person who garners a degree of fame in one culture may be considered less famous or obscure in another. Some nationwide celebrities might command some attention outside their own nation; for example, the singer [[Lara Fabian]] is widely known in the [[French-speaking]] world, but only had a couple of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' hits in the U.S., whereas the francophone Canadian singer [[Celine Dion]] is well known in both the French-speaking world and in the United States.

Regions within a country, or cultural communities (linguistic, ethnic, or religious) can also have their own celebrity systems, especially in linguistically or culturally distinct regions such as [[Quebec]] or [[Wales]]. Regional radio personalities, [[newscasters]], politicians or community [[leader]]s may be local or regional celebrities.

In politics, certain politicians are recognizable to many people, usually the head of state and the Prime Minister. Yet only heads of state who play a major role in international politics have a good chance of becoming famous outside their country's borders, since they are constantly featured in [[mass media]]. [[The President of the United States]], for instance, is famous by name and face to millions of people around the world. Since World War II the [[U.S. Presidential elections]] are followed closely all across the globe, making the elected candidate instantly world-famous as a result. In contrast, both the [[Pope]] and [[The Dalai Lama]] are far more famous under their official title than under their actual names. Usually when politicians leave active politics their recognizability tends to diminish among general audiences, as other politicians replace them in their official political functions. Certain politicians, however, are still famous today, even decades or centuries after they were in power. They owe their fame to historical deeds which are kept in memory in history classes, for instance people like [[Julius Caesar]], [[Genghis Khan]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Mao Zedong]]. [[Scandal]] can also unwillingly make certain politicians famous, even among those who aren't particularly interested in politics.

English-speaking media commentators and journalists will sometimes refer to celebrities as belonging to the ''[[A-List]]'' or state that a certain actor belongs to the ''B-List'', the latter being a disparaging context. These informal rankings indicate a placing within a hierarchy. However, due to differing levels of celebrity in different regions, it is difficult to place people within one bracket. A Brazilian actor might be a B-list action film actor in the U.S., but an A-list star in Portugal.

Some elements are associated with fame, such as appearing on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', being spoofed in ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', having a wax statue in ''[[Madame Tussauds]]'', or receiving a star on the ''[[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].''
 
Certain people are known even to people unfamiliar with the area in which they excelled. If one has to name a famous boxer, they are more likely to name [[Muhammad Ali]] or [[Mike Tyson]], since their fame expanded beyond the sport itself. [[Pablo Picasso]]'s style and name are known even to people who are not interested in art; likewise many know that [[Harry Houdini]] was an illusionist, [[Tiger Woods]] a golfer, [[Richard Branson]], [[Bill Gates]], and [[Donald Trump]] are entrepreneurs, [[Albert Einstein]] a scientist; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] classical composers; [[Luciano Pavarotti]] an opera singer, [[Bruce Lee]] a martial artist, [[William Shakespeare]] a playwright, [[Walt Disney]] an animator and [[Yuri Gagarin]] and [[Neil Armstrong]] astronauts.

Criminals can also become world-famous if the media cover their crimes, arrest, trial and possible punishment extensively and/or if the crime itself is sensational enough. Assassins of high-profile celebrities can become famous, like [[Brutus]] who is remembered for murdering [[Julius Caesar]]. People who commit extremely gruesome crimes can also achieve infamy, such as Nazi doctor [[Josef Mengele]]. Certain criminals have achieved lasting fame thanks to romanticization in popular culture, such as [[Guy Fawkes]], [[Blackbeard]], [[Billy the Kid]] and [[Bonnie &amp; Clyde]]. Others owe their fame to never being identified or caught, like [[Jack the Ripper]], or by regularly  being interviewed in jail, like [[Charles Manson]]. However, certain criminals are covered far less extensively in media and, as such, don't become very famous at all. In other cases the huge media coverage disappears after the conclusion of their trial, causing them to fade in obscurity again. This has even happened to people who commit high-profile crimes, like [[François Ravaillac]] whose murder of [[Henry IV of France]] in 1610 is nowadays only remembered by people with historic knowledge. In some cases people who've been acquitted of certain crimes are still remembered as being guilty today, like [[Lizzie Borden]], showing that the sensation occasionally overshadows the actual facts.

===Fictional implications===
The same phenomenon is true for fictional characters. [[Sherlock Holmes]], [[Dracula]], [[Frankenstein's Monster]] and [[James Bond]] continue to be portrayed in film, television and literature decades after the original stories were published. [[Superman]], [[Spider-Man]], [[The Hulk]], [[Wonder Woman]], and [[Batman]] represent super heroes to a far wider audience than that of the comics and graphic novels in which they appear. The same can be said about other comics characters which enjoy international distribution and syndication such as [[Popeye]], [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]], [[Snoopy]], [[Astérix]], [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] and [[Astro Boy]]. [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] have theme parks around the world which rely on the fame of its creations headed by [[Mickey Mouse]]. Thanks to the global reach of film and television characters like [[King Kong]], [[Godzilla]], [[The Flintstones]], [[The Muppets]] and [[The Simpsons]] are instantly recognizable to millions. Certain fictional characters known from TV series have become so famous that their names are more well known than those of the actors who perform them. A good example is [[Larry Hagman]] who played [[J.R. Ewing]] on the TV series ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''. When his character was shot during a [[cliffhanger]] episode without the viewers knowing who was the killer, it caused a media hype around the question: ''[[Who Shot J.R.?]]''. By the time the answer was given in the first episode of the next season millions of people instantly recognized Hagman's face as J.R. rather than that of himself. Some characters from video and computer games have developed a celebrity life beyond these media, such as [[Mario]], [[Lara Croft]] and [[Pikachu]]. Certain advertising characters have also become iconic thanks to decades of constant merchandising, such as [[Ronald McDonald]]
, [[Bibendum]] and [[Hello Kitty]].

==Becoming a celebrity==
[[File:A. Schwarzenegger.jpg|thumb|[[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] is an Austrian-American actor, producer, businessman, investor, author, philanthropist, activist, politician, and former professional bodybuilder. He served two terms as the 38th Governor of California from 2003 to 2011]]

People may become celebrities in a wide range of ways; from their professions, following appearances in the media, or by complete accident. The term "instant celebrity" describes someone who becomes a celebrity in a very short period of time. Someone who achieves a small amount of [[15 minutes of fame|transient fame]] (through, say, [[Media circus|hype]] or mass media) may become labeled a "B-grade celebrity". Often, the generalization extends to someone who falls short of mainstream or persistent fame but who seeks to extend or exploit it.

===Success===
There are, of course, no guarantees of success for an individual to become a celebrity. Though celebrities come from many different working fields, most celebrities are typically associated with the fields of sports and entertainment, or a person may be a public figure who is commonly recognizable in mass media with commercial and critical acclaim.

Though glamour and wealth may certainly play a role for only famous celebrities, most people in the sports and entertainments spheres, be it music, film, television, radio, modelling, comedy, literature etc. live in obscurity and only a small percentage achieve fame and fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Book of Odds (View Profile) |url=http://www.divinecaroline.com/50616/110803-odds-becoming-youtube-celebrity |title=Odds of Becoming a YouTube Celebrity |publisher=DivineCaroline |date= |accessdate=2011-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102034806/http://www.divinecaroline.com/50616/110803-odds-becoming-youtube-celebrity |archivedate=January 2, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Natalie Boxall |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/may/26/graduates.careers |title=Making it in the music industry &amp;#124; Money |work=The Guardian |date= May 30, 2007|accessdate=2011-12-27 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=White |first=Alison |url=http://careers.guardian.co.uk/careers-blog/music-industry-careers?commentpage=all |title=Live Q&amp;A: Career options in the music industry &amp;#124; Guardian careers &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Careers.guardian.co.uk |date=2011-07-30 |accessdate=2011-12-27 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cumberlandminorhockey.ca/to_the_nhl/chances.htm |title=Chances of Making it to the NHL |publisher=Cumberlandminorhockey.ca |date=2002-04-01 |accessdate=2011-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219081012/http://www.cumberlandminorhockey.ca/to_the_nhl/chances.htm |archivedate=December 19, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the sports and entertainment sphere, the top inventors, professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and scientists, etc. are unlikely to become celebrities even if they are enormously successful in their field due to society's disinterest in science, [[invention]], [[medicine]], and courtroom law which is not fictional. American microbiologist [[Maurice Hilleman]] is credited with saving more lives than any other medical [[scientist]] of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Maurice R.

A number of [[Sportsperson|athletes]] who are unable to turn professional take a second job or even sometimes abandon their athletic aspirations in order to make ends meet. A small percentage of entertainers and athletes are able to make a decent living but a vast majority will spend their careers toiling from hard work, determination, rejection, and frequent unemployment. For minor league to amateur athletes, earnings are usually on the lower end of the pay-scale. Many of them take second jobs on the side or even venture into other occupations within the field of sports such as coaching, [[general management]], [[referee]]ing, or recruiting and scouting up-and-coming athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=E.

The [[Screen Actors Guild]], a union representing actors and actresses throughout [[Hollywood]] reports that the average television and film actor earns less than US$50,000 annually; the median hourly wage for actors was $18.80 in May 2015.&lt;ref name = "Actors, Producers, and Directors "&gt;{{cite news |title=Actors|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/actors.htm |publisher= U.S. Bureau of Labor Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2015 Edition|date= |accessdate=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://redbirdstudio.com/AWOL/life.html |title=An Actor's Life |publisher=Redbirdstudio.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111040742/http://www.redbirdstudio.com/AWOL/life.html |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegegrad.com/careers/proft23.shtml |title=Career Information – Actors, Producers, and Directors |publisher=Collegegrad.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actors sometimes alternate between theater, television, and film or even branch into other occupations within the [[List of entertainment industry topics|entertainment industry]] such as becoming a singer, comedian, producer, or a television host in order to be monetarily diversified, as doing one gig pays comparatively very little. For instance, [[David Letterman]] is well known for branching into [[late night television]] as a [[talk show host]] while honing his skills as a stand-up comedian, [[Barbra Streisand]] ventured into acting while operating as a singer, or [[Clint Eastwood]], who achieved even greater fame in Hollywood for being a film director and a producer than for his acting credentials.

Celebrity endorsements have proven very successful around the world where, due to increasing [[consumerism]], an individual is considered to own a status symbol when they purchase a celebrity-endorsed product{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}. Although it has become commonplace for celebrities to place their name with endorsements onto products just for quick money, some celebrities have gone beyond merely using their names and have put their entrepreneurial spirit to work by becoming entrepreneurs by attaching themselves in the business aspects of entertainment and building their own business brand beyond their traditional salaried activities. Along with investing their salaried wages into growing business endeavors, a number of celebrities have become innovative business leaders in their respective industries, gaining the admiration of their peers and contributing to the country’s economy.

Numerous celebrities have ventured into becoming [[business mogul]]s and established themselves as entrepreneurs, idolizing many well known American business leaders such as [[Bill Gates]] and [[Warren Buffett]]. For instance, basketball legend [[Michael Jordan]] became an active entrepreneur involved with many sports related ventures including investing a minority stake in the [[Charlotte Bobcats]], [[Paul Newman]] started his own [[salad dressing]] business after leaving behind a distinguished acting career, and rap musician [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]] started his own [[record label]], clothing line, and an [[oil well|oil business]] while maintaining a career as a rap artist. Brazilian football legend and World Cup winner [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] became the majority owner of La Liga club [[Real Valladolid]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ronaldo: Former Brazil striker buys controlling stake in Real Valladolid |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45397137 |accessdate=6 September 2018 |agency=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other celebrities such as [[Tyler Perry]], [[George Lucas]], and Steven Spielberg have become successful entrepreneurs through starting their own film production companies and running their own [[movie studio]]s beyond their traditional activities of screenwriting, directing, animating, producing, and acting.&lt;ref name="Paul Newman Donates Salad Dressing Ownership To Charity "&gt;{{cite news |title=Paul Newman Donates Salad Dressing Ownership To Charity|url= http://www.looktothestars.org/news/890-paul-newman-donates-salad-dressing-value-to-charity|publisher= Look to the Stars|date= June 11, 2008|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tabloid magazines and talk TV shows bestow a great deal of attention on celebrities. To stay in the public eye and build wealth in addition to their salaried labor, numerous celebrities have participating and branching into various business ventures and endorsements. Many celebrities have participated in many different endorsement opportunities that include: animation, publishing, fashion designing, cosmetics, [[consumer electronics]], household items and [[home appliance|appliance]]s, cigarettes, [[soft drink]]s and alcoholic beverages, hair care, hairdressing, [[jewelry design]], fast food, credit cards, video games, writing, and toys.&lt;ref name="Best And Worst Celebrity Side Businesses "&gt;{{cite news |title=Best And Worst Celebrity Side Businesses |url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/07/22/stars-biz-successful-forbeslife-cx_dp_0722style_2.html= |work=Forbes |date=July 22, 2009 |accessdate=November 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118190511/http://www.forbes.com/2008/07/22/stars-biz-successful-forbeslife-cx_dp_0722style_2.html%3D |archivedate=January 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to various endorsements, a number of celebrities have been involved with some business and investment related ventures also include:  and toddler related items, [[List of professional sports team owners|sports team ownership]], [[fashion design|fashion retailing]], establishments such as restaurants, cafes, hotels, and casinos, movie theaters, advertising and event planning, management related ventures such as [[sports management]], financial services, [[modeling agency|model management]], and [[talent management]], [[record label]]s, [[film production]], [[television producer|television production]], publishing such as [[book publisher|book]] and [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishing]], massage therapy, [[Beauty salon|salon]]s, health and fitness, and real estate.&lt;ref name="Best And Worst Celebrity Side Businesses "/&gt;

Although some celebrities have achieved additional financial success from various business ventures, the vast majority of celebrities are not successful businesspeople and still rely on salaried labored wages in order to earn a living. Most businesses and investments are well known to have a 90 to 95 percent failure rate within the first five years of operation. Not all celebrities eventually succeed with their own businesses and other related side ventures. Some celebrities either went [[wikt:broke|broke]] or filed for bankruptcy as result of dabbling with such side businesses or endorsements. Though some might question such a validity since celebrities themselves are already well known, have mass appeal, and are well exposed to the general public. The average entrepreneur who is not well known and reputable to general public doesn't the same marketing flexibility and status-quo as most celebrities allow and have. Therefore, compared to the average person who starts a business, celebrities already have all the cards and odds stacked in their favor. This means they can have an unfair advantage to expose their business ventures and endorsements and can easily capture a more significant amount of market share than the average entrepreneur.&lt;ref name="7 Most Embarrassing Celebrity Business Failures"&gt;{{cite news|title=7 Most Embarrassing Celebrity Business Failures |url=http://www.growthink.com/business-plan/7_Most_Embarrassing_Celebrity_Business_Plan_Failures.html |publisher=Growthink |year=2007 |accessdate=November 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702110650/http://www.growthink.com/business-plan/7_Most_Embarrassing_Celebrity_Business_Plan_Failures.html |archivedate=July 2, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a mass media phenomenon==
[[File:Kim Kardashian 2017 (cropped).png|thumb|[[Kim Kardashian]], reality TV star]]

Celebrities often have fame comparable to [[royal family|royalty]]. As a result, there is a strong public curiosity about their private affairs. The release of [[Kim Kardashian]]'s [[Celebrity sex tape|sex tape]] with rapper [[Ray J]] in 2003 brought her to a new level of fame, leading to magazine covers, book deals, and [[Keeping Up with the Kardashians|reality TV]] series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title="Kim Kardashian Superstar Featuring Ray J" 18 U.S.C. 2257 Compliance Records | author=S Hirsch | journal=Vivid Entertainment LLC. – 18 U.S.C. 2257 Compliance Records | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vivid&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hiphoppress.com/2007/02/vivid_entertain.html|title= Vivid Entertainment Spends $1-Million To Acquire Notorious Video 'Starring' Sexy Socialite Kim Kardashian And Hip Hop Star Ray J|accessdate= 2008-10-06|author= [[Vivid Entertainment]]|date= 2007-02-07|publisher= Hip Hop Press|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080923231924/http://www.hiphoppress.com/2007/02/vivid_entertain.html|archivedate= September 23, 2008|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrities may be resented for their accolades, and the public may have a love/hate relationship with celebrities. Due to the high visibility of celebrities' private lives, their successes and shortcomings are often made very public. Celebrities are alternately portrayed as glowing examples of perfection, when they garner awards, or as decadent or immoral if they become associated with a scandal. When seen in a positive light, celebrities are frequently portrayed as possessing skills and abilities beyond average people; for example, celebrity actors are routinely celebrated for acquiring new skills necessary for filming a role within a very brief time, and to a level that amazes the professionals who train them. Similarly, some celebrities with very little formal education can sometimes be portrayed as experts on complicated issues. Some celebrities have been very vocal with their political views. For example, [[Matt Damon]] expressed his displeasure with 2008 US vice presidential nominee [[Sarah Palin]], as well as with the 2011 [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|United States debt-ceiling crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,420621,00.html |title=Matt Damon: Sarah Palin Presidency Would Be Like a 'Really Bad Disney Movie' |publisher=Fox News |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2011-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Young |first=Kevin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/8617149.stm |title=Election 2010: Political celebrities – then and now |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-04-20 |accessdate=2011-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous for being famous==
{{Main article|Famous for being famous}}
[[File:Paris Hilton 2009.jpg|thumb|American [[socialite]] [[Paris Hilton]] was one of the first celebrities to be described as '[[#Famous for being famous|famous for being famous]]', she has since expanded her brand into a  multibillion-dollar empire]]
Famous for being famous, in [[popular culture]] terminology, refers to someone who attains celebrity status for no particular identifiable reason, or who achieves fame through association with a celebrity.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Joe|title=Contemporary moral issues|publisher=Heinemann|year=2002|edition=4, illustrated|series=Examining Religions |page=178|isbn=978-0-435-30309-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is a [[pejorative]], suggesting that the individual has no particular talents or abilities.&lt;ref name="JenJones"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Jen|title=Being Famous|publisher=Capstone Press|year=2007|series=Snap Books: 10 Things You Need to Know about|page=20|isbn=978-1-4296-0126-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when their fame arises from a particular talent or action on their part, the term will sometimes still apply if their fame is perceived as disproportionate to what they earned through their own talent or work.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The coinages "[[famesque]]" and "[[celebutante]]" are of similar pejorative gist.

==Internet celebrities==
Also known as being ''[[Internet celebrity|internet famous]]'', contemporary fame doesn't always involve a physical red carpet.

===Online Fame in Asia===
A report by [[BBC]] highlighted a longtime trend of Asian internet celebrities such as [[Chinese people|Chinese]] celebrity [[Wang Hong]] (birth name Ling Ling).&lt;ref name="Chinese Internet Fame"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/36802769 "Wang Hong: China's online stars making real cash"] ''[[BBC News]]''. May 1, 2017. Retrieved May 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; According to BBC, there are two kinds of online celebrities in China—those who create original content, such as [[Papi Jiang]], who is regularly censored by Chinese authorities for cussing in her videos, and those such as Wang Hong and Zhang Dayi, who fall under the second category, as they have clothing and cosmetics businesses on Taobao, China's equivalent of [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].&lt;ref name="Chinese Internet Fame"/&gt;

===Social networking and video hosting===
Most high-profile celebrities participate in [[social networking]] and photo or video hosting platforms such as [[List of YouTubers|YouTube]], Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat.&lt;ref&gt;Murad, Ahmed [http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article5641893.ece "The 50 most popular celebs on Twitter"], The Sunday Times, February 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Social networking sites allow celebrities to communicate directly with their fans, removing the middle-man known as traditional media. Social media humanizes celebrities in a way that arouses public fascination as evident by the success of magazines such as ''[[Us Weekly]]'' and ''[[People (magazine)|People Weekly]]''. Celebrity blogging have also spawned stars such as [[Perez Hilton]] who is well known for not only blogging, but also [[outing]] celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Anne|date=Spring 2007|title=Celebrity juice, not from concentrate: Perez Hilton, gossip blogs, and the new star production|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc49.2007/PerezHilton/index.html|journal=Jump Cut|volume=49|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media sites have also contributed to the fame of some celebrities, such as [[Tila Tequila]] who became known through MySpace.&lt;ref&gt;Trebay, Guy [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/fashion/28fame.html "She's Famous (and So Can You)"], The New York Times, October 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Families==
Another example of celebrity is a family that has notable ancestors or is known for its wealth. In some cases, a well-known family is associated with a particular field. For example, the [[Kennedy family]] is associated with US politics; The [[House of Windsor]] with royalty; The [[Hilton family|Hilton]] and [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] families with business; the [[Jackson family]] with popular music; and the [[The Osbournes|Osbourne]], [[Chaplin family|Chaplin]], [[Keeping Up with the Kardashians|Kardashian]], [[Baldwin family|Baldwin]], and [[Barrymore family|Barrymore]] families with television and film.

==Restricted access==
Access to celebrities is strictly controlled by their entourage of staff which includes [[Talent manager|manager]]s, [[publicist]]s, [[Talent agent|agent]]s, [[personal assistant]]s, and [[bodyguard]]s. Even journalists find it difficult to access celebrities for interviews. An interview with writer and actor [[Michael Musto]] cites:

{{quote|You have to go through many hoops just to talk to a major celebrity. You have to get past three different sets of publicists: the publicist for the event, the publicist for the movie, and then the celebrity's personal publicist. They all have to approve you.|[[Michael Musto]]|&lt;ref&gt;[[n:An interview with gossip columnist Michael Musto on the art of celebrity journalism|en.wikinews.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Celebrities often hire one or more bodyguards (or close protection officer) to protect themselves and their families from threats ranging from the mundane (intrusive [[paparazzi|paparazzi photographers]] or [[autograph]]-seeking [[Fan (person)|fans]]) to serious ([[assault]], [[kidnapping]], [[assassination]], or [[stalking]]). The bodyguard travels with the celebrity during professional activities (movie shoots or concerts) and personal activities such as recreation and errands.

Celebrities also typically have security staff at their home, to protect them from similar threats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iacpo.org/ International Association of Close Protection Officers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Celebrity-stalking has common threads "&gt;{{cite news |title= Celebrity-stalking has common threads|url= http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/entertainment&amp;id=6730960= |publisher= ABC|date= March 26, 2009|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult of celebrity==

===15 minutes of fame===
{{see also|15 minutes of fame|One-hit wonder}}
[[File:Andy Warhol 1975.jpg|thumb|[[Andy Warhol]] coined the phrase "[[15 minutes of fame]]"]]

[[Andy Warhol]] famously coined the phrase "[[15 minutes of fame]]" in reference to a short-lived publicity. Certain "15 minutes of fame" celebrities can be average people seen with an A-list celebrity, who are sometimes noticed on entertainment news channels such as [[E! News]]. These persons are ordinary people becoming celebrities, often based on the ridiculous things they do.  "In fact, many reality show contestants fall into this category: the only thing that qualifies them to be on TV is that they're real."&lt;ref&gt;Maasik, Sonia, and Jack Solomon. ''Signs of Life in the USA''. 5th ed. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain people are only remembered today because of a movie portrayal, certain story or [[urban legend]] surrounding their life and less for their accomplishments. [[Antonio Salieri]] was a famous and well-known 18th-century composer, but his fictional portrayal as an [[antagonist]] (for example, in the musical and film ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'') has been more famous than his music since the end of the 20th century. [[Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle]] and [[O. J. Simpson]] are more notorious for their association with murder trials than for their respective movie and sports careers. Centuries after his death, [[Andrea Mantegna]] is now better known as the mentor of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] than for his own paintings.

==Health implications==

[[John Cleese]] said being famous offers some advantages such as financial wealth and easier access to things that are more difficult for non-famous people to access, such as the ability to more easily meet other famous or powerful people, but that being famous also often comes with the disadvantage of creating the conditions in which the celebrity finds themselves acting, at least temporarily (although sometimes over extended periods of time), in a superficial, inauthentic fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PJaHSovyZ4 John Cleese Speaking at the American School in London] (beginning at about 44:25 into the video)&lt;/ref&gt;

Common threats such as [[stalking]] have spawned [[celebrity worship syndrome]] where a person becomes overly involved with the details of a celebrity's personal life.&lt;ref name="Schumaker"&gt;Schumaker, John F., 'Star Struck' New Internationalist; Issue 363, p34-35, 2p, December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;    Psychologists have indicated that though many people obsess over glamorous film, television, sport and music stars, the disparity in salaries in society seems to value [[professional athlete]]s and [[list of entertainment industry topics|entertainment industry based professional]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Horovitz|first=Bruce|title=The good, bad and ugly of America's celeb obsession|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2003-12-19-celeb_x.htm|work=USA Today|accessdate=May 5, 2012|date=December 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=America's Obsession with Celebrities|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahradio/Americas-Obsession-with-Celebrities|work=June 4th 2007|publisher=Oprah.com|accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that singers, musicians, actors and athletes die younger on average than writers, composers, academics, politicians and businesspeople, with a greater incidence of cancer and especially lung cancer. However, it was remarked that the reasons for this remained unclear, with theories including [[innate]] tendencies towards risk-taking as well as the pressure or opportunities of particular types of fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|website=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-22189177|title=Fame may 'lead to a shorter life'|date=April 18, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, some have said fame might have negative [[psychological]] effects, and may lead to increasingly selfish tendencies and psychopathy.[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/22/health/psychology/22fame.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0]

Recently, there has been more attention toward the impact celebrities have on health decisions of the population at large.&lt;ref&gt;S.J. Hoffman, C. Tan. 2015. “Biological, psychological and social processes that explain celebrities' influence on patients' health-related behaviors,” Archives of Public Health 73(3): 1-11. doi:10.1186/2049-3258-73-3&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the public will follow celebrities' health advice to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;S.J. Hoffman, C. Tan. 2013. “Why Do So Many People Follow Celebrities’ Medical Advice? A Meta-Narrative Review,” British Medical Journal 347: f7151. doi:10.1136/bmj.f7151.&lt;/ref&gt; This can have positive impacts when the celebrities give solid, evidence informed health advice, however it can also have detrimental affects if the health advice is not accurate enough.

There has been a recognisable community of '''Chinese people in Korea''', also known as '''Chinese Koreans''', since the 1880s. Most early migrants came from [[Shandong]] province on the east coast of [[China]]; many of them and their descendants have emigrated. However, the [[reform and opening up]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and the normalisation of [[People's Republic of China – South Korea relations]] has resulted in a new wave of Chinese migration to South Korea.&lt;ref name="KimHJ"&gt;{{citation|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/152641.html|date=2006-08-29|accessdate=2006-12-08|title=No 'real' Chinatown in S.

When writing in English, scholars use a number of different terms to refer to Chinese people in Korea, often derived from [[Sino-Korean vocabulary]]. One common one is ''yeohan hwagyo'' (Korean) or ''lühan huaqiao'' (Mandarin), meaning "Chinese staying in Korea".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kim|2004|p=688}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Korean reading is often shortened to ''hwagyo'' (also spelled ''huakyo''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freekorea.us/2017/08/01/propaganda-in-the-age-of-kim-jong-un-a-discussion-with-professor-b-r-myers/|title=Propaganda in the age of Kim Jong-Un: A discussion with Professor B.R. Myers|website=Freekorea.us|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which simply means "overseas Chinese" but in English literature typically refers specifically to the overseas Chinese of Korea. Other authors call them ''huaqiao'', but this term might be used to refer to overseas Chinese in any country, not just Korea, so sometimes a qualifier is added, for example "Korean-''Huaqiao''".&lt;ref name="Choi 2001 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Choi|2001|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rhee|2009|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "Chinese Korean" and "Korean Chinese" are also seen.&lt;ref name="Choi 2001 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Article: The vanishing of Chinatown: Chinese fail to thrive in South Korea|date=1996-08-03|accessdate=2009-10-15|periodical=The Economist|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18546294.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this usage may be confused with [[Koreans in China]], who are also referred to by both such names.

==Early history==
{{Main|Korean clans of foreign origin#China}}

[[Jizi]] came to Korea during the [[Shang dynasty]] and established [[Gija Joseon]] and [[Wiman of Gojoseon]] came from [[Han dynasty]] China and established [[Wiman Joseon]].

Chinese colonists settled in the [[Four Commanderies of Han]] after the Han dynasty conquered [[Wiman Joseon]], especially in [[Lelang Commandery]]. At Lelang Han colonies of peasants were settled there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Atlas of the Classical World, 500 BC--AD 600|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOzKGAAACAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books|isbn=978-0-7607-1973-2|page=2.24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other minority ethnicities from China such as the Xianbei, Khitan, and Jurchen also migrated into the Korean peninsula.

Fleeing from the [[Mongols]], in 1216 the [[Khitan people|Khitans]] invaded [[Goryeo]] and defeated the Korean armies multiple times, even reaching the gates of the capital and raiding deep into the south, but were defeated by Korean General [[Kim Chwi-ryeo]] who pushed them back north to [[Pyongan Province|Pyongan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kim Chwi-ryeo|url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0010816|website=Encyclopedia of Korean Culture|publisher=Academy of Korean Studies|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Goryeosa: Volume 103|url=https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/%E9%AB%98%E4%B8%BD%E5%8F%B2103%E5%8D%B7|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the remaining Khitans were finished off by allied Mongol-Goryeo forces in 1219.&lt;ref name="EbreyWalthall2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patricia Ebrey|author2=Anne Walthall|title=Pre-Modern East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History, Volume I: To 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6F2XLmIVAaYC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=khitan+defeated+goryeo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAWoVChMIz_yL7Ny3xwIVwz4-Ch3Oyw1R#v=onepage&amp;q=khitan%20defeated%20goryeo&amp;f=false|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-133-60651-2|pages=177–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ki-Baik|title=A New History of Korea|date=1984|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]|isbn=067461576X|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Khitans are possibly the origin of the [[Baekjeong]].

One of [[Mencius]]' descendants moved to Korea and founded the [[Sinchang Maeng clan]]. A Chinese descended from a student of Confucius founded the [[Muncheon Gong clan]] and [[Gimpo Gong clan]] in Korea.

During the [[Yuan dynasty]], one of [[Confucius]]' descendants, who was one of the [[Duke Yansheng]] Kong Huan's [[w:zh:孔浣|孔浣]] sons, named Kong Shao 孔紹, moved from China to [[Goryeo]] era Korea and established a branch of the family there called the [[Gong clan of Qufu]] after marrying a Korean woman (Jo Jin-gyeong's 曹晉慶 daughter) during [[Toghon Temür]]'s rule.

[[Chen Li (emperor)|Chen Li]] went to Korea. The Chinese rebel leader Ming Yuzhen's son Ming Sheng went to Korea and founded the [[Yeonan Myeong clan]], [[Seochok Myeong clan]] and [[Namwon Seung clan]].

Individual Chinese are recorded on the Korean peninsula as early as the 13th century, with some going on to found [[Bon-gwan|Korean clans]].&lt;ref name="Rootsweb"&gt;For example, the [[Deoksu Jang clan]], founded by a [[Hui Chinese]] in 1275.

Accompanying the troops were some 40 Chinese merchants and other civilians.&lt;ref name="KimHJ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kim|2004|p=689}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August that same year, Qing Superintendent for Trade for the Northern Ports [[Li Hongzhang]] lifted restrictions on coastal trade and signed the Regulations for Maritime and Overland Trade Between Chinese and Korean Subjects, and two further agreements the following year, which granted Chinese merchants permission to trade in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamashita|2001|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in other Asian countries, 90% of the early overseas Chinese in Korea came from [[Shandong]], rather than the southern coastal provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian]].&lt;ref name="Rhee 2009 113"&gt;{{harvnb|Rhee|2009|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 19th and early 20th century Shandong was hard hit by famine, drought, and banditry especially in its northwest, and caused many to migrate to other parts of Shandong, China, and Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larsen|2008|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Shandong people]]. Chinese merchants did well in competition with the Japanese due to their superior access to credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamashita|2001|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were not confined to port cities, and many did business in inland parts of Korea. Generally speaking, Japanese traders were more interested in quick profits, while the Chinese established relationships with customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duus|1995|pp=256–257}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Chinese school in Korea, the Joseon Hwagyo Primary School, was established in 1902 in [[Incheon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yi|2007|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Under Japanese rule==
[[File:Seoul Overseas Chinese Primary School.jpg|thumb|right|The gate of the Overseas Chinese Primary School in [[Myeongdong]].[[Seoul]]]]

By 1910, when [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea formally came under Japanese rule]], the number of Chinese in Korea had risen to 12,000.&lt;ref name="doRosario"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/55a/326.html|title=Seoul's invisible Chinese rise up|last=do Rosario|first=Louise|date=2000-10-22|accessdate=2006-12-08|periodical=The Straits Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese migrants established schools in [[Seoul]] in 1910, [[Busan]] in 1912, [[Sinuiju]] in 1915, [[Nampho]] in 1919, and [[Wonsan]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yi|2007|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of Chinese in Korea would expand to 82,661 by 1942, but contracted sharply to 12,648 by 1945 due to economic hardships faced during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Rhee 2009 114"&gt;{{harvnb|Rhee|2009|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Division of Korea==
===South Korea===
[[File:Busan chinatown.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Paifang|gate]] of [[Busan]]'s [[Chinatown]], located in Choryang-dong, [[Dong-gu, Busan|Dong-gu]]]]

Prior to and during the [[Korean War]], many Chinese residing in the northern half of the Korean peninsula migrated to the southern half.&lt;ref name="Rhee 2009 114"/&gt; After the [[division of Korea]], the Chinese population in South Korea would remain stable for some time; however, when Park Chung Hee took power in a coup on May 16, 1961, he began to implement currency reforms and property restrictions which severely harmed the interests of the Chinese community, spurring an exodus.&lt;ref name="Rhee 2009 113"/&gt; [[Incheon]] once had the largest Chinese population in Korea, but as the pace of emigration increased, the number diminished. It is estimated that only 26,700 of the old Chinese community now remain in South Korea; they largely hold [[Nationality law of the Republic of China|Republic of China nationality]].&lt;ref name="KimHJ"/&gt;

However, in recent years, immigration from mainland China has increased; 696,861 persons of [[Nationality law of the People's Republic of China|PRC nationality]] have immigrated to South Korea, making them 55.1% of the total 1,139,283 foreign citizens living in South Korea. Among them are 488,100 of Korean descent (70% of PRC citizens in South Korea, and 40% of the total number of foreign citizens), and 208,761 of other ethnicities. Most of these new residents live in [[Seoul]] and its surroundings.&lt;ref name="ChosunIlbo20090806"/&gt;

There is a Chinese-language primary school in [[Myeongdong]], as well as a high school in Seodaemun.&lt;ref name="SeoulOCHS"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.scs.or.kr/|title=韓國漢城華僑中學|publisher=Seoul Overseas Chinese High School|accessdate=2006-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Korea===
After the [[surrender of Japan]] and the liberation of Korea from Japanese rule, Chinese living in the northern half of Korea quickly established new schools and rebuilt Chinese-language education, with aid from the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC). In April 1949, the CPC's Northeast Administrative Committee formally handed control of these schools over to the North Korean government, which began some efforts to integrate them into the national educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mu|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early financial assistance from the North Korean government actually helped to maintain and expand Chinese education; the schools continued operation even during the Korean War, and the era after the cessation of hostilities up to around 1966 was described as a "golden era" for the schools. After that time, the North Korean government began to pursue a policy of reform and indigenisation towards the schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mu|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of the late 1990s, there were still four Chinese middle schools which followed the PRC curriculum.&lt;ref name=lankov245/&gt; Some of their graduates go on to PRC universities; for example, [[Jinan University]] in [[Guangzhou]] had over 100 overseas Chinese students from North Korea {{asof|2002|lc=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=//www.dprktime.com/koreaclass/index-1.html |periodical=时代朝鲜网 |title=中国是祖国，朝鲜是家乡 |accessdate=2009-10-15 |author=李成爱 |date=2002-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204192818/http://www.dprktime.com/koreaclass/index-1.html |archivedate=February 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yanbian University]] in the [[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture]] of China also began offering [[teacher education|training programmes for teachers]] in overseas Chinese schools in North Korea beginning in 2002; 38 students from their first class graduated in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://newspaper.ybu.edu.cn/show.php?newsid=349|periodical=Yanbian University News|date=2005-09-05|accessdate=2009-10-15|title=首届朝鲜华侨教师大专班毕业/First North Korean overseas Chinese teacher training class graduates|author=张顺兴 (Zhang Shunxing)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being foreign citizens, North Korea's Chinese people were not eligible to join the ruling [[Korean Workers Party]] or advance in the military or the civil bureaucracy. On the other hand, they were allowed somewhat greater freedoms, such as the right to own a radio that was not sealed to only allow being tuned to North Korean stations (as long they did not listen to foreign stations in the presence of North Koreans). More importantly, since around 1980 they were allowed to travel abroad, and participate in the important and profitable export-import business.&lt;ref name=lankov245/&gt; After the PRC government came out in support of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874]] in June 2009, which imposed sanctions in North Korea, it was reported that North Korean surveillance and repression of Chinese residents had increased, and many had chosen to avoid making trips out of the country to avoid scrutiny. One Chinese resident was allegedly charged with espionage.&lt;ref name="ChosunIlbo20091010"/&gt;

The population of PRC citizens in North Korea was estimated as 14,351 persons (in 3,778 households) in 1958, shrinking to a mere 6,000 by 1980, as they had been encouraged by the North Korean government to leave for China in the 1960s and 70s.&lt;ref name=lankov245/&gt; Recent estimates of their population vary. China's official [[Xinhua News Agency]] published a figure of 4,000 overseas Chinese and 100 [[international student]]s in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://2008.163.com/08/0427/10/4AHEVUT600742CMG.html|periodical=Xinhua News|date=2008-04-27|accessdate=2009-09-16|title=平壤中国留学生和华侨火炬手的心声 祝福北京奥运/Pyongyang's Chinese migrants and international students wish the Beijing Olympics good luck}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Chosun Ilbo]]'', a South Korean newspaper, gave a higher estimate of 10,000 people in 2009.&lt;ref name="ChosunIlbo20091010"&gt;{{citation|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/10/10/2009101000229.html|date=2009-10-10|accessdate=2009-10-15|periodical=Chosun Ilbo|title=Chinese in N.Korea 'Face Repression'}}&lt;/ref&gt; They live mostly in [[Pyongyang]] and in the areas near the Chinese border.&lt;ref name=lankov245/&gt;

==Secondary migration==
Due to the South Korean regulations in the 1960s which limited foreign property ownership, many Chinese in South Korea left the country.&lt;ref name="Kim 2004 690"&gt;{{harvnb|Kim|2004|p=690}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, 15,000 are estimated to have moved to the [[United States]], and another 10,000 to Taiwan. Further outmigration occurred during the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]].&lt;ref name="Rhee 2009 115"&gt;{{harvnb|Rhee|2009|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others went to the PRC after its [[gaige kaifang|reform and opening up]], to pursue commercial opportunities or simply to return to their ancestral hometowns.&lt;ref name="Kim 2004 690"/&gt; For example, in [[Rizhao]], Shandong alone, there are 8,200 returned overseas Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chao|1998|p=463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Chinese from Korea who migrated to the U.S. have settled in areas with large [[Korean American]] communities, such as [[Los Angeles]], and they have tended to integrate into the [[Korean American]] rather than [[Chinese American]] community.&lt;ref name="Rhee 2009 115"/&gt; Yet, some who went to the United States or Taiwan found they could not adapt to life there either due to linguistic and cultural barriers, and ended up returning to South Korea, in a form of [[circular migration]].&lt;ref name="Kim 2004 690"/&gt;

==Korea overseas Chinese history==
Overseas Chinese are person that born in China, settled in other countries and is working in that country. The origin of the Overseas Chinese in Korea can find in the Im-O Military Revolt in 1882.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = [특별기고] 한국 화교 그 애잔한 이름 - 일간투데이|url = http://www.dtoday.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=175107|website =Dtoday.co.kr|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Chinese 吳長慶 came to fetch the Chinese military 4000 people in order to rectify the Im-O Military Revolt in Korea, and the settlement of Overseas Chinese began from the Qing Dynasty merchants that came along to procure munitions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As Qing Dynasty 租界地  was set to near Incheon Jemulpo Port in 1884, in earnest, the Overseas Chinese came to Korea and was nationally spread.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = 한국화교이야기 &gt; 한국화교현황 {{!}} 인천차이나타운|url = http://www.ichinatown.or.kr/introduction/overseas_chinese/drift.asp|website =Ichinatown.or.kr|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, overseas Chinese society is atrophied because of Various institutional limits and discrimination of our government.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = [수도권] '130년 역사' 화교들, 인천 떠난다…왜?|url = http://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?news_id=N1002729365|website = SBS NEWS|accessdate = 2015-12-07|language = ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Korea conducted favorable policy for foreign In 1998, overseas Chinese has become increasingly stable as 22,917 people In 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 한국은 화교자본 성공 못한 유일한 나라…인천특구·새만금도 외면|url = http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?no=990922&amp;year=2014|website = Mk.co.kr|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; And The rise of China and the 21st century global era, especially, Since the 1997 IMF crisis, as importance of foreign capital was emphasized, Overseas Chinese in Korea has arranged the foundation of a new leap forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 한국화교이야기 &gt; 한국화교현황 {{!}} 인천차이나타운|url = http://www.ichinatown.or.kr/introduction/overseas_chinese/jump.asp|website = Ichinatown.or.kr|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 인천시립박물관 특별전 ‘오래된 이웃, 화교’|url = http://www.ajunews.com/view/20141127102925703|website = Ajunews.com|accessdate = 2015-12-07|language = ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
It has been documented that most Chinese in South Korea are followers of [[Chinese folk religion]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]]. Chinese have established some folk temples dedicated to various gods, which provide networks linking back to mainland China or Taiwan. Otherwise, there are no formal [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist]] and [[Taoist temple]]s in Korea. Chinese Buddhist attend temples of [[Korean Buddhism]]. Many Chinese belong to [[Yiguandao]], a religious movement originating from Chinese folk religion. Since the 1990s, Christianity has made some inroads among the Chinese of Korea, with at least one Chinese-language church established by a pastor from Taiwan. Chinese Catholics attend Korean Catholic churches.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Communicative planning''' is an approach to [[urban planning]] that gathers stakeholders and engages them in a process to make decisions together in a manner that respects the positions of all involved.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collaborative Planning: Shaping Places in Fragmented Societies|last=Healey|first=Patsy|publisher=UBC Press|year=1997|isbn=0774805986|location=|pages=5|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes called collaborative planning among planning practitioners or collaborative planning model.

== History and theory ==
Since the 1970s, communicative planning theory has formed based on several key understandings. These key points include the notions that communication and reasoning come in diverse forms, knowledge is socially constructed, and people’s diverse interests and preferences are formed out of their social contexts.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Healey|first=Patsy|year=1996|title=The Communicative Turn in Planning Theory and its Implications for Spatial Strategy Formation|url=|journal=Readings in Planning Theory|volume=23|pages=217–234|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1068/b230217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communicative theory also draws on [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]] analyses of power in that it recognizes that power relations exist in practice and have the ability to oppress individuals.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Specific to a community and urban planning context, communicative theory acknowledges that planners' own actions, words, lived experiences, and communication styles have an effect on the planning process the planner is facilitating.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Finally, communicative planning theory advances the idea that planning happens in everyday practice and social relations, and consensus-building can be used to organize people's thoughts and move past traditional ways of knowing and decision-making.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

In the 1990s, a number of planning scholars began writing about a new orientation to urban planning theory that moved away from the prevalent rational approach to planning. [[Judith Innes]] is credited with coining the term "communicative planning" in her article ''Planning Theory’s Emerging Paradigm: Communicative Action and Interactive Practice.''&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Judith|year=1995|title=Planning Theory’s Emerging Paradigm: Communicative Action and Interactive Practice|url=http://jpe.sagepub.com/content/14/3/183.extract|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|volume=14|pages=183–189|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0739456x9501400307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innes' tries to bridge the gap between planning theories and planning in practice, and offers consensus-building as a tool for urban planners to create collaborative and engaging planning environments that allow different stakeholders to participate.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Judith E.|last2=Booher|first2=David E.|date=1999-12-31|title=Consensus Building and Complex Adaptive Systems|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01944369908976071|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=65|issue=4|pages=412–423|doi=10.1080/01944369908976071|issn=0194-4363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Booher|first=David E.|last2=Innes|first2=Judith E.|date=2002-03-01|title=Network Power in Collaborative Planning|url=http://jpe.sagepub.com/content/21/3/221|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|pages=221–236|doi=10.1177/0739456X0202100301|issn=0739-456X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Judith E.|last2=Booher|first2=David E.|date=1999-03-31|title=Consensus Building as Role Playing and Bricolage|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01944369908976031|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=65|issue=1|pages=9–26|doi=10.1080/01944369908976031|issn=0194-4363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Around the same time as this article was published, Patsy Healey also published a number of planning theory texts exploring communicative and collaborative planning. Drawing on the theory of [[Jürgen Habermas]] in particular, Healey's work focuses on the impact that communicative acts (which can be in spoken or written form) have on a community planning process.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Healey also expands on the work of urban planner [[John F. Forester]] and economic geographer [[Bent Flyvbjerg]], both of whom examine Habermasian communication and power structures in their planning work.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The emerging field of therapeutic planning is closely related to communicative planning. Therapeutic planning operates on the basis that communities can experience collective trauma, including from past planning processes, and that carefully facilitated community engagement can act as catalysts for community-wide healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erfan|first=Aftab|date=2016-11-21|title=Confronting collective traumas: an exploration of therapeutic planning|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14649357.2016.1249909|journal=Planning Theory &amp; Practice|volume=0|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1080/14649357.2016.1249909|issn=1464-9357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aftab|first=Erfan,|date=2013-09-09|title=An experiment in therapeutic planning : learning with the Gwa'sala-'Nakwaxda'xw First Nations|url=https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0074273|doi=10.14288/1.0074273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ENsYDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=therapeutic+planning+community&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6BKoIae-W0&amp;sig=cRmujL8p6qsJhL9fG0b_YN6ZFXc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS6djzttfQAhUG9GMKHXhZBaAQ6AEIRjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=therapeutic%20planning%20community&amp;f=false|title=The Global City and the Holy City: Narratives on Knowledge, Planning and Diversity|last=Fenster|first=Tovi|date=2016-09-16|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317880097|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some planning practitioners use untraditional planning approaches, such as filmmaking and other artistic media, to engage community members in therapeutic planning processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sandercock|first=Leonie|last2=Attili|first2=Giovanni|date=2014-01-16|title=Changing the Lens Film as Action Research and Therapeutic Planning Practice|url=http://jpe.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/01/16/0739456X13516499|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|language=en|pages=0739456X13516499|doi=10.1177/0739456X13516499|issn=0739-456X|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communicative process and tools ==
In a communicative planning process, planning practitioners play more of a facilitative role. They often act as a ‘knowledge mediator and broker’&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; to help reframe problems in order to promote more creative thinking about possible solutions.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Planning in divided cities: collaborative shaping of contested space|last=Gaffikin|first=Frank|last2=Morrissey|first2=Mike|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|year=2011|isbn=978-1-405-19218-7|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this process, information should be produced collectively by the full range of stakeholders who may be affected by the outcome of the process.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Judith E.|date=1998-03-31|title=Information in Communicative Planning|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01944369808975956|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=64|issue=1|pages=52–63|doi=10.1080/01944369808975956|issn=0194-4363}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, all of the stakeholders should be involved in negotiating both the problem definition and the solution together.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In doing so, solutions to conflicts amongst stakeholders may be re-framed as ‘win-win’, as opposed to the ‘zero sum’ mindset which occurs when stakeholders are bargaining on the basis of their own fixed interests.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Consensus-building is an important part of this collective meaning-making process, as information is discussed and validated within the group of sakeholders, resulting in information which holds more significance to the group.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

To aid in consensus-building efforts, power should be distributed amongst the stakeholders such that they are equals in the process.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Openness and trust are also crucial for building consensus.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The objectives, underlying assumptions, and positions of these stakeholders should be considered along with the uncertainties about future conditions, such as population growth, and decisions which are linked to other decisions.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chakraborty|first=Arnab|date=2012-03-01|title=Recognizing Uncertainty and Linked Decisions in Public Participation: A New Framework for Collaborative Urban Planning|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sres.2102/abstract|journal=Systems Research and Behavioral Science|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=131–148|doi=10.1002/sres.2102|issn=1099-1743}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to have the stakeholders identify this information for themselves, as it will help reduce the biases present in both analyses driven by only one future and position-based discussions, as well as bring to the forefront any conflicts between the underlying values of the stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; By considering this broad range of information, commonalities between different stakeholders may be identified, which can help build consensus. However, this cannot guarantee consensus, as positions might in fact be too different.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In order to deal with the challenges that arise from positions being very different and the increasing complexity of analysis required, new models of collaboration are needed which build on various principles of conflict management, including engaging early and engaging often.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

'''The Neighbourhood Revitalization Program (NRP) - 1990'''

In 1990, the city of [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] launched a 20-year program designed to empower residents in local decision making and share community planning responsibilities among residential, government and private stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elwood|date=2002|title=Neighbourhood Revitalization through Collaboration: Assessing the implications of neoliberal urban policy at the grassroots.|journal=GeoJournal|volume=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combat the dwindling standard of living within Minneapolis neighbourhoods, the NRP was conceptualized as a means of involving citizens in the prioritization of revitalization efforts. The Minneapolis government divided 400 million dollars between 81 neighbourhood organizations who utilized the funding over two decades to assess priorities, reach consensus and implement neighbourhood improvement projects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Within the first decade of the NRP, 48% of funding was used for upgrading housing and 16% went towards job creation and economic developments.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=J.|last2=Pentel|first2=P.|date=2002|title=What the Neighbours Want: The Neighborhood Revitalization Program's First Decade.|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=68|issue=4|pages=435–449|doi=10.1080/01944360208976284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other priorities included public safety, the preservation of green space and improving transportation infrastructure.

Through the completion and adoption of 66 unique neighbourhood plans, stakeholders from various organizations including the general public, [[Minneapolis Public Library]], Minneapolis Parks and Recreation, Public Works, Housing Inspection and [[Hennepin County]] all came together to articulate and agree upon feasible and mutually beneficial neighbourhood directives.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fung|date=2006|title=Empowered Participation in Urban Governance: The Minneapolis Revitalization Program.|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|volume=30|issue=3|pages=638–655|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2006.00685.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; With emphasis placed on citizen participation, municipal planners took on an advisory role and assisted neighbourhood planning organizations in encouraging participation, engaging a diverse audience and reviewing completed plans through a technical lens.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Despite the creation of Participation Agreements which stood as formal commitments to holding an inclusive engagement process, the NRP has been criticized for a lack of representation from all neighbourhood members.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While the NRP has been applauded for its communicative and collaborative values, critics point to cases of exclusion and the enormous amount of continuous time and energy required for its success as main drawbacks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Seattle's Neighbourhood Planning Program - 1994'''

In 1994, [[Seattle]] developed the Neighbourhood Planning Program (NPP) in response to outcry from the general public surrounding a lack of involvement in a recently completed comprehensive plan.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siranni|first=Carmen|date=2007|title=Neighbourhood Planning as Collaborative Design|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=73|issue=4|pages=373–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NPP intended to build a partnership between residents and the local government and provided neighbourhoods with the choice to create their own unique local plan or continue by the comprehensive plan. While these neighbourhood plans had to be consistent with the broad goals of the comprehensive plan, participating neighbourhoods were afforded the opportunity to identify their own priorities and provide a list of recommendations to the city.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Initially, each participating neighbourhood was given 10,000 dollars to begin a communicative engagement process and identify a vision for their local community.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neighbor Power: Building Community the Seattle Way|last=Diers|first=Jim|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Seattle|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional funding for the planning stage would not be rewarded until the City felt as though enough stakeholders and community representatives had been included in the process.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building Community Capacity: How collaborative planning is changing the culture of governance in Seattle.|last=Kobler|first=A|publisher=Iowa State University ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the visioning process was deemed to be inclusive and rigorous, the city provided each neighbourhood with between 60,000-100,000 dollars to develop a plan.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In total, 38 neighbourhoods participated and developed their own neighbourhood plan for the municipality to follow.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;   Before approving each neighbourhood plan, the municipality would hold public hearings in the neighbourhood to share the plan and ensure there was consensus among all the residents in the area.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  By 1999, the City had adopted these plans and began implementing the shared visions of each neighbourhood.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Each plan varied significantly as each neighbourhood was afforded the opportunity to hire their own planner or consultants to assist them in the process.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Planning professionals participated in the process mainly as mediators who helped guide participatory sessions and facilitated the consensus-building process.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Between 20, 000 and 30, 000 residents participated directly in the NPP.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The program has been recognized as a successful example of communicative planning and [[collaborative governance]] due to the high level of participation and the frequency with which consensus was genuinely reached.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==  Challenges and critiques ==
Critiques of Innes, Healey, and communicative planning focus on the planning processes and outcomes.

Older critiques of communicative planning theory question whether the theory they find idealist can translate a consensus-based process into authentic outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tewdwr-Jones|first=M.|last2=Allmendinger|first2=P.|date=1998-11-01|title=Deconstructing Communicative Rationality: A Critique of Habermasian Collaborative Planning|url=http://epn.sagepub.com/content/30/11/1975|journal=Environment and Planning A|language=en|volume=30|issue=11|pages=1975–1989|doi=10.1068/a301975|issn=0308-518X}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also question whether consensus is a valuable goal when they see critical planning decisions as being made gradually.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=aetrlrhK37sC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=rationality+and+power&amp;ots=a7lj21LT2d&amp;sig=0_-GsZZkld1rJoEsk3Ui8Y_pT4s#v=onepage&amp;q=rationality%20and%20power&amp;f=false|title=Rationality and Power: Democracy in Practice|last=Flyvbjerg|first=Bent|date=1998-02-28|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226254494|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional critiques relate to power: who has the power to exclude and include stakeholders and whether stakeholders will use their power to manipulate the consensus building process (given that consensus must be reached).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Older critiques of communicative planning practice also see a lack of real world outcomes from the communicative planning processes because deeper political and institutional change is needed first.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Judith Innes directly responded to these critiques in her article ''Consensus Building: Clarifications for the Critics''.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Judith E.|date=2004-03-01|title=Consensus Building: Clarifications for the Critics|url=http://plt.sagepub.com/content/3/1/5|journal=Planning Theory|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=5–20|doi=10.1177/1473095204042315|issn=1473-0952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, she expanded her description of the consensus building process and communicative planning's roots.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Newer [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] critiques argue collaborative planning is a way to maintain larger political and institutional systems while creating a process that only seems to better represent the public.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Purcell|first=Mark|date=2009-05-01|title=Resisting Neoliberalization: Communicative Planning or Counter-Hegemonic Movements?|url=http://plt.sagepub.com/content/8/2/140|journal=Planning Theory|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=140–165|doi=10.1177/1473095209102232|issn=1473-0952}}&lt;/ref&gt; They see collaborative planning as a way to keep neoliberals in power and political systems stable, rather than creating real changes to the governing system.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

[[Indonesia]]'s '''Corruption Eradication Commission''' ({{lang-id|Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi}}), abbreviated as '''KPK''', is a government agency established to fight [[political corruption|corruption]]. As of 2015, its chairman is [[Agus Raharjo]].&lt;ref name=JP312&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/12/03/house-s-kpk-picks-politically-motivated.html |title=House’s KPK picks 'politically motivated' |date=3 December 2011 |work=The Jakarta Post |accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the agency won the [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]].

==History==
===Background===
Anti-corruption efforts began in Indonesia in the 1950s. Following strong criticism of corruption at the beginning of the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] regime in the late 1960s a ''Commission of Four'' was appointed by president [[Soeharto]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. C. Mackie, 'The report of the Commission of Four on corruption', ''Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies'', 6 (3), 1970, pp. 87-101.&lt;/ref&gt; The report of the commission noted that corruption was "rampant" but none of the cases it said were in need of urgent action were followed up. Laws were passed in 1999 giving the [[Indonesian National Police|Police]] and [[Attorney General of Indonesia|prosecution service]] the authority to investigate corruption cases.

===Establishment===
Law No.30/2002 on the Corruption Eradication Commission was passed in 2002 providing a legal basis for the establishment of the KPK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.icac.org.hk/newsl/issue22eng/button3.htm|title= KPK: The Corruption Eradication Commission of Indonesia|author= |date= |work= |publisher= Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A Nation in Waiting: Indonesia in the 1990s|last= Schawrz|first= Adam|year= 1994|publisher= Allen &amp; Unwin|location= Australia|isbn= 1-86373-635-2|pages= 137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Commission has engaged in significant work revealing and prosecuting cases of corruption in crucial government bodies reaching as high as the [[Supreme Court of Indonesia|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/07/02/kpk-resumes-battle-against-judicial-mafia-courts.html KPK resumes battle against judicial mafia in courts], Jakarta Post. 2 July 2016. Accessed 27 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties==
The KPK vision is to free Indonesia from corruption. Its duties include investigating and prosecuting corruption cases and monitoring the governance of the state. It has the authority to request meetings and reports in the course of its investigations. It can also authorise wiretaps, impose travel bans, request financial information about suspects, freeze financial transactions and request the assistance of other law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpk.go.id/modules/edito/content.php?id=15|title=Vision and Mission|author=|date=|work=KPK website|publisher=|accessdate=17 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016073222/http://www.kpk.go.id/modules/edito/content.php?id=15|archivedate=16 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpk.go.id/modules/wmpdownloads/files/KPK_Annual_Report_2008.pdf|title=Corruption Eradication Commission 2008 Annual Report|author=|date=|work=|publisher=KPK|accessdate=17 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122152020/http://www.kpk.go.id/modules/wmpdownloads/files/KPK_Annual_Report_2008.pdf|archivedate=22 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also has the authority to detain suspects, including well-known figures, and frequently does so.

==Achievements==
[[File:Johan Budi.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Johan Budi, the former spokesman of the Commission]]
The work of the KPK is a source of continuing controversy in Indonesia. The commission is careful, but sometimes quite aggressive, in pursuing high-profile cases.  For example, in reporting on the activities of the KPK, one foreign observer noted that the commission has "confronted head-on the endemic corruption that remains as a legacy of President Suharto’s 32-year-long kleptocracy. Since it started operating in late 2003, the commission has investigated, prosecuted and achieved a 100-percent conviction rate in 86 cases of bribery and graft related to government procurements and budgets."&lt;ref&gt;Norimitsu Onishi, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/world/asia/26indo.html?pagewanted=all Corruption Fighters Rouse Resistance in Indonesia]", ''New York Times'', 25 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; To display once more its resolve to crack down on graft suspects, the KPK named on 7 December 2012, both brothers of Indonesian [[socialite]] [[Rizal Mallarangeng]], Indonesia's Sports Minister [[:id:Andi Mallarangeng|Andi Mallarangeng]] and [[Fox Indonesia]] consultant Choel Mallarangeng suspects in a multimillion-dollar corruption case, in the latest scandal to hit the President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]]'s ruling party ahead of [[Indonesian presidential election, 2014|Indonesia's 2014 Presidential election]]. Mallarangeng is the first minister to resign on graft allegations since the KPK began operating in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesian Minister Andi Mallarangeng resigns over graft charges|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20638970|accessdate=5 January 2013|newspaper=BBC News Asia|date=7 December 2012|agency=British Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia's sports minister resigns amid graft probe|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/se-asia/story/indonesias-sports-minister-resigns-amid-graft-probe-20121207|accessdate=5 January 2013|newspaper=Straits Times|date=7 December 2012|agency=AFP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KPK public education division official Budiono Prakoso said in December 2008 that because of its limited manpower and resources, of some 16,200 cases reported to the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), only a small number had been dealt with.&lt;ref name="TheJakartaPost"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/12/03/kpk-backlog-reaches-more-16000-cases.html |title=KPK backlog reaches more than 16,000 cases |first=Ni Komang |last=Erviani |date=3 December 2008 |newspaper=The Jakarta Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of the solid reports informed the KPK of alleged cases of corruption and misuse of budget funds by government agencies at national and regional levels. "The main problem is the political will of the government at regional and national levels. Political will remains low. Everything is still at a lip-service level," he said.

NGO activists often urge the KPK to be more aggressive in its work.  For example, Bali Corruption Watch (BCW) head Putu Wirata Dwikora asked the KPK to investigate corruption cases in Bali. He lamented the commission's practice of handing over corruption cases in Bali to the local prosecutors office for further investigation. "The KPK should be directly involved in investigations to create a deterrent effect," Putu said.&lt;ref name="TheJakartaPost"/&gt;

On the other hand, the success of the KPK in using controversial tools like warrantless wiretaps, and its focus on high-level targets like "businessmen, bureaucrats, bankers, governors, diplomats, lawmakers, prosecutors, police officials and other previously untouchable members of Indonesian society", has led to something of a backlash. There have been reported attempts to undermine the Commission in [[People's Consultative Assembly|Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;Onishi, "Corruption Fighters Rouse Resistance in Indonesia."&lt;/ref&gt;

==KPK and police==
In the view of many Indonesian observers, the "gecko vs crocodile" dispute illustrated the tensions said to exist between the KPK and the [[Indonesian National Police]]. Some high-profile investigations carried out by the KPK have focused on allegations of corruption at senior levels of the police force. This approach is reported to have led to widespread resentment within the police force towards the work of the KPK.&lt;ref&gt;Muradi, 'Police versus KPK: A new chapter of rivalry?', ''The Jakarta Post'', 9 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Sharp tensions surfaced in early December 2012 when the KPK took the highly unusual step of detaining Inspector General Djoko Susilo, a senior and active police general, on charges of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Rabby Pramudatama, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/12/04/kpk-locks-police-general.html KPK locks up police general'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 4 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  A few days later, president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono expressed public concern about the tensions between the KPK and the national police.&lt;ref&gt;Margareth S. Aritonang and Bagus BT Saragih, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/12/07/sby-concerned-over-unsettled-kpk-police-quandary.html SBY 'concerned' over unsettled KPK-Police quandary'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 7 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Gecko vs Crocodile" dispute===
[[File:Corruption Eradication Commission rally.jpg|thumb|Rally in support of the KPK. Slogan translates as "Killing the KPK is the same as killing this nation".]]
In April 2009, angry that the KPK had tapped his phone while investigating a corruption case, Indonesian Police chief detective [[Susno Duadji]] compared the KPK to a gecko ({{lang-id|cicak}}) fighting a crocodile ({{lang-id|buaya}}) meaning the police. Susno's comment, as it turned out, quickly backfired because the image of a ''cicak'' standing up to a ''buaya'' (similar to [[David and Goliath]] imagery) immediately had wide appeal in Indonesia. A noisy popular movement in support of the ''cicak'' quickly emerged.  Students staged pro-''cicak'' demonstrations, many newspapers ran cartoons with ''cicaks'' lining up against an ugly ''buaya'', and numerous TV talk shows took up the ''cicak'' versus ''buaya'' topic with enthusiasm. As a result, references to ''cicaks'' fighting a ''buaya'' have become a well-known part of the political imagery of Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Antagonism between the KPK and the police, with memories of the ''cicak'' versus ''buaya'' clash, remained deeply embedded in the relationship between the KPK and the police after the clash. See, for example, references to the clash in 2012 in Ina Parlina, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/05/18/doubts-over-kpk-inquiry-police-bank-accounts.html Doubts over KPK inquiry into police bank accounts'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 18 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September two KPK deputy chairmen [[Chandra Hamzah]] and [[Bibit Samad Rianto]], who had been suspended in July, were arrested on charges of extortion and bribery. The two men denied the charges, saying they were being framed to weaken the KPK. There were demonstrations in several cities in support of the men and a support campaign on the [[Facebook]] social networking site gathered one million members. On 2 November 2009 president [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] established a team to look into the allegations. The following day, during a hearing at the [[Constitutional Court of Indonesia|Indonesian Constitutional Court]], dramatic tapes were played of bugged phone conversations apparently revealing a conspiracy to undermine the KPK. The names of businessman Susno Duadji as well as Deputy Attorney General Abdul Hakim Ritonga and a businessman, Anggodo Widjojo, were mentioned in the tapes.  Bibit and Chandra were released later the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14816720|title= The gecko bites back|author= |date= 5 November 2009|work= [[The Economist]]|publisher= |accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.radioaustralianews.net.au/stories/200910/2728708.htm?desktop|title= SBY vows to defends Indonesia's anti-graft agency

[[File:KPKMural.png|left|150px|thumb|A mural expressing support for KPK on a support pillar of the abandoned [[Jakarta Monorail]]. The caption reads "do you want to eradicate corruption or eradicate the KPK?]]On 10 November, at the trial of KPK chairman [[Antasari Azhar]], who had been arrested in May for allegedly organising the murder of a businessman, former South Jakarta police chief Williardi Wizard testified that senior police officers had asked him to help them frame Azhari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/11/11/antasari-%E2%80%98framed%E2%80%99.html|title= Antasari ‘framed’|author= Hasyim Widhiarto|date= 11 November 2009|work= [[The Jakarta Post]]|publisher= |accessdate= 17 November 2009|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091117055359/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/11/11/antasari-%E2%80%98framed%E2%80%99.html|archivedate= 17 November 2009|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team established by the president, the "Team of Eight", presented its recommendations on 17 November 2009. These included a halt to the prosecution of Bibit and Chandra, punishment for officials guilty of wrongdoing and the establishment of a state commission to implement institutional reforms of law enforcement agencies. The president said he would respond in a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/11/18/team-reports-steamroller-plows.html|title= Team reports, steamroller plows on|author= Erwida Maulia and Dicky Christanto|date= 18 November 2009|work= [[The Jakarta Post]]|publisher= |accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 November 2009 the president made a speech responding to the Team of Eight's findings. He said that it would be better if the Bibit-Chandra case were settled out of court but did not call for the case to be dropped. He also said there was a need for reforms within the Indonesian National Police, the Attorney General's office and the KPK. His speech caused confusion among Team of Eight members and provoked a protest from activists who symbolically threw in their towels as a way of criticising what they judged to be the president's unconvincing response. On 3 December 2009, the president was officially informed that charges against Bibit and Chandra had been dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/11/24/a-better-solution-don%E2%80%99t-take-case-court-says-sby.html|title= A better solution: Don’t take the case to court, says SBY|author= Erwida Maulia|date= 24 November 2009|work= [[The Jakarta Post]]|publisher= |accessdate= 6 December 2009|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091128230907/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/11/24/a-better-solution-don%E2%80%99t-take-case-court-says-sby.html|archivedate= 28 November 2009|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://thejakartaglobe.com/home/yudhoyono-calls-for-reform-of-indonesias-police-and-ago/343393|title= Yudhoyono Calls for Reform of Indonesia's Police and AGO|author= Kinanti Pinta Karana|date= 23 November 2009|work= [[The Jakarta Globe]]|publisher= |accessdate= 6 December 2009|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091127115953/http://thejakartaglobe.com/home/yudhoyono-calls-for-reform-of-indonesias-police-and-ago/343393|archivedate= 27 November 2009|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://thejakartaglobe.com/home/president-ready-to-issue-a-decree-reinstating-chandra-and-bibit-to-kpk/345660|title= President Ready to Issue a Decree Reinstating Chandra and Bibit to KPK|author= Heru Andriyanto &amp; April Aswadi|date= 5 December 2009|work= [[The Jakarta Globe]]|publisher= |accessdate= 6 December 2009|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717012547/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/president-ready-to-issue-a-decree-reinstating-chandra-and-bibit-to-kpk/345660|archivedate= 17 July 2011|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrest of KPK deputy chairman [[Bambang Widjojanto]] by [[Indonesian Police]] on 23 January 2015 revived the "gecko vs crocodile" dispute. The arrest was made after the commission declared the [[Peoples Representative Council|parliament]]-approved candidate for the chief of Indonesian Police [[Budi Gunawan]] a suspect in a gratification case on 14 February, just days before his scheduled inauguration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribunnews.com/nasional/2015/01/23/cicak-versus-buaya-jilid-ii-dimulai-i|title= Cicak vs Buaya Jilid II Dimulai|author= Reza Gunadha|date= 23 January 2015|work= Tribunnews|publisher= |accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indonesian public saw the arrest as an attack against KPK, and there was immediate support for the KPK. Immediately after the news of his arrest broke, various groups demonstrating in front of KPK headquarters in [[South Jakarta]] to show support for the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.metrotvnews.com/read/2015/01/23/349050/pendukung-kpk-bertambah-banyak-jalan-rasuna-said-macet|title= Pendukung KPK Bertambah Banyak, Jalan Rasuna Said Macet|author= Al Abrar|date= 23 January 2015|work= [[Metro TV]]|publisher= |accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netizens also created the [[hashtag]] #SaveKPK and it emerged as a worldwide trending topic on social media [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/01/23/savekpk-worldwide-trending-topic-twitter.html|title= #SaveKPK worldwide trending topic on Twitter|author= Nurfika Osman|date= 23 January 2015|work= [[The Jakarta Post]]|publisher= |accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resources==

Resources provided to the KPK have expanded in recent years.  However, the work of the commission is still restricted by limited budgets and a small number of total staff.

'''Cumberland Grove Country Club''' formerly known as '''Orange Grove Golf Club''' from 1962 till 1990, then known as '''Grove Golf Club''' from 1991 until January 1998, is located on the Cumberland Highway (Orange Grove Road) in [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]], New South Wales and is the new home to the Rale Rasic International Football Academy.

==Orange Grove Golf Club==
Orange Grove Golf Club began in 1962 through the dissatisfaction of a few golfers over conditions at their club. They sought fresh fields and called a meeting, at which they unanimously voted to buy land and establish their own club. By the mid seventies the club had through mismanagement and theft reached the brink of closing. In 1976 George Jarrett was appointed Secretary Manager. By negotiating with creditors and suppliers Jarrett was able to trade the club out of difficulties and ensure that the golfing public of Liverpool had access to this wonderful facility. During this time once a week was ladies day and the most famous player on these occasions was Margaret Whitlam - wife of the then recently deposed Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam.

==Cumberland Grove Sporting Educational &amp; Research Institute==
On 16 August 2006, former [[Prime Minister]] and former Federal Member for [[Werriwa]], The Honourable [[Gough Whitlam|Edward Gough Whitlam, AC, QC]] launched the Cumberland Grove Sporting Educational &amp; Research Institute at the Cumberland Grove Country Club which is to be turned into a $40,000,000 soccer football training complex for the children of Australia. Cumberland Grove became a reality through the efforts of Sydney businessman '''Edmond M Parilo''' and the international soccer legend and coach of the 1974 Socceroo's, [[Rale Rasic|Rale Rasic OAM]] Cumberland Grove is now the home of:
*Cumberland Grove Country Club
*Cumberland Grove Sporting Educational &amp; Research Institute
*Cumberland Grove Function Centre
*Rale Rasic International Football Academy
*The Rale Rasic Goalkeeping Academy
*Liverpool United FC
*Southern Districts Soccer Football Association Headquarters
*The Inaugural Australian Football Museum
*Cafe Club 74

The Master of Ceremonies at the launch was [[Network 10]] Reporter/Presenter Frank Coletta and saw 30 children from '''Southern Districts''' in their different uniforms playing soccer on the new fields. The launch was highly publicized throughout Australia by [[Network 10]], [[Nine Network]], [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]], the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]], The [[Daily Telegraph]] and the [[Sydney Morning Herald]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5066">'''Datafly algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] for providing anonymity in medical data. The algorithm was developed by [[Latanya Arvette Sweeney]] in 1997&amp;minus;98.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Latanya Sweeney|title=Datafly: a system for providing anonymity in medical data|url=http://dataprivacylab.org/datafly/|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Sweeney, Datafly: a system for providing anonymity in medical data. Database Security, XI: Status and Prospects, T. Lin and S. Qian (eds), Elsevier Science, Amsterdam, 1998.[http://dataprivacylab.org/datafly/paper2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Anonymization is achieved by automatically generalizing, substituting, inserting, and removing information as appropriate without losing many of the details found within the data. The method can be used on-the-fly in [[Role-based access control|role-based]] security within an institution, and in [[batch processing|batch]] mode for [[Import and export of data|exporting data]] from an institution.
Organizations release and receive medical data with all explicit [[identifier]]s -- such as name -- removed, in the erroneous belief that [[Physician–patient privilege|patient confidentiality]] is maintained because the resulting data look anonymous. However the remaining data can be used to re-identify individuals by linking or matching the data to other databases or by looking at unique characteristics found in the [[field (computer science)|field]]s and [[row (database)|records]] of the [[database]] itself.

The Datafly algorithm has been criticized for trying to achieve anonymization by over-generalization. The algorithm selects the [[attribute (computing)|attribute]] with the greatest number of distinct [[value (computer science)|value]]s as the one to generalize first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Li Xiong|title=Data Anonymization - Generalization Algorithms|url=http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~lxiong/cs573_s12/share/slides/0131_generalization_slawek.pdf|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core algorithm==
An outline of the Datafly algorithm is presented below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Latanya Sweeney|title=Computational Disclosure Control A Primer on Data Privacy Protection|publisher=MIT|page=113|url= http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/8589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Input (computer science)|Input]]''':
Private [[Table (database)|Table]] PT; [[quasi-identifier]] QI = (  ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; ), ''k''-anonymity constraint ''k''; domain generalization hierarchies DGH&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''i'' = 1,...,''n'' with accompanying [[function (mathematics)|function]]s ''f''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, and loss, which is a limit on the percentage of [[tuple]]s that can be suppressed. PT[id] is the set
of unique identifiers or keys for each tuple.

'''[[Output (computing)|Output]]''':
MGT a generalization of PT[QI] that enforces ''k''-anonymity

'''algorithm Datafly''':

// Construct a frequency [[List (abstract data type)|list]] containing unique [[sequence]]s of values across the quasi-identifier in PT,

Each element is of the form ( QI, frequency, SID ), where SID = { ''id&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' :  &amp;exist;  ''t''[''id''] &amp;isin; [''id'']  &amp;rArr; ''t''[''id''] = ''id''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; }; and, frequency = |SID|. Therefore, freq is also accessible as a table over (QI, frequency, SID).

:2. let pos &lt;math&gt; \gets&lt;/math&gt; 0, total &lt;math&gt; \gets&lt;/math&gt; 0

:3. while total ≠ |PT| do

::3.1 freq[pos] &lt;math&gt; \gets&lt;/math&gt; ( ''t''[QI], occurs, SID ) where ''t''[QI] &amp;isin; [QI], ( ''t''[ QI ],__, ___ ) &lt;math&gt;\not\in&lt;/math&gt; freq; occurs = |PT| - |PT[QI] – {''t''[QI]}|; and, SID = { ''id''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; : &amp;exist; ''t''[''id''] &lt;math&gt; \gets&lt;/math&gt; PT[id] &amp;rArr;    ''t''[''id''] = ''id''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; }

::3.2 pos &lt;math&gt; \gets&lt;/math&gt; pos + 1, total &lt;math&gt; \gets&lt;/math&gt; total + occurs

:// Make a solution by generalizing the attribute with the most number of distinct values

:// and suppressing no more than the allowed number of tuples.

:4. let belowk &lt;math&gt; \gets&lt;/math&gt; 0

:::5.2.1 belowk &lt;math&gt; \gets&lt;/math&gt; belowk + count

:6. if belowk &gt; ''k'' then do: // Note. loss * |PT| = ''k''.

::6.1 freq &lt;math&gt; \gets&lt;/math&gt; generalize(freq)

::6.2 go to step 4

==Other demographics statistics==
32.3% of Canadians considered their ethnic origin to be Canadian. Other major groups recorded were English (18.3%), Scottish (13.9%), French (13.6%), Irish (13.4%), German (9.6%) and Chinese (5.1%). When reading these figures, you should bear in mind that census respondents could select multiple ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="WPR 2018"/&gt;

Nearly 22% of the population is now foreign-born, and about 60% of new immigrants come from Asia, particularly China and India.&lt;ref name="WPR 2018"/&gt;

Frank Trovato, a professor of population and demography studies at the University of Alberta, told CBS news that "Canada needs a robust increase to keep up with demands in the workforce and maintain a strong economy. It may be time for policymakers in the country to consider ways to boost Canada's fertility rates, such as with "family friendly" policies that allow women to combine a family with a career."&lt;ref name="WPR 2018"/&gt;

Although there are 11 aboriginal languages, only a few are spoken by enough people to ensure that they are safe from extinction.&lt;ref name="WPR 2018"/&gt;

==Ethnicity==

===Ethnic origin===
{{Main|Ethnic origins of people in Canada}}
As data is completely self-reported, and reporting individuals may have varying definitions of "Ethnic origin" (or may not know their ethnic origin), these figures should not be considered an exact record of the relative prevalence of different ethno-cultural ancestries but rather how Canadians self-identify.

Statistics Canada projects that immigrants will represent between 24.5% and 30.0% of Canada’s population in 2036, compared with 20.7% in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/91-551-x/91-551-x2017001-eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics Canada further projects that visible minorities will make up 33.7-34.3% of Canada's total population, compared to 22.3% in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/91-551-x/2017001/tbl/tbl_05-eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Counting both single and multiple responses, the most commonly identified ethnic origins were (2016):

==Characteristics==
[[Image:Malta demography.png|thumb|250px|right|Demographics of Malta, Data of [[FAO]], year 2005; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
[[Malta]] is the most densely populated country in the EU and one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with about 1,265 inhabitants per square kilometre (3,000 per square mile). This compares with about 32 per square kilometre (85 per square mile) for the United States. A census (held every 10 years) was held in November 2005.

Inhabited since prehistoric times, Malta was first colonized by [[Sicily|Sicilians]]. Subsequently, [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Byzantine]]s, [[Arab]]s in 870 CE&lt;ref&gt;The Arabs in Malta / G. Wettinger. In: Malta: Studies of its Heritage and History / ed.

Roman Catholicism is established by law as the religion of Malta with 98%; however, full liberty of conscience and freedom of worship is guaranteed, and a number of faiths have places of worship on the island (rather small groups, a combined total of 2% of the people are [[Protestant]]s, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Muslims]] and [[Jews]]).

Malta has two official languages--[[Maltese language|Maltese]] (a Semitic language derived from [[Siculo-Arabic]] and heavily influenced by [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and Italian), and English. Both languages are compulsory subjects in Maltese primary and secondary schools. A large portion of the population is also fluent in Italian, which was, until 1936, the national language of Malta. The literacy rate has reached 93%, compared to 63% in 1946. Schooling is compulsory until age 16.

Since 2000, the shift in the age composition towards an older population continued to materialise. In fact, the average age of the Maltese population increased from 38.5 in 2005 to 40.5 in 2011. This resulted from the increase in the number of persons aged 55 and over, together with a decrease in the number of persons under 25 years of age. The average in Gozo and Comino (41.6 years) was higher than that observed for Malta.
Persons aged 65 and over more represent 16.3% of the total population in 2011, compared to 13.7% in 2005. In contrast, persons aged 14 and under make up 14.8% of the population in 2011, compared to 17.2% in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://census2011.gov.mt/downloads/Census2011_PreliminaryReport.pdf|title=Census 2011 Preliminary Report|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111221856/http://census2011.gov.mt/downloads/Census2011_PreliminaryReport.pdf|archivedate=11 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emigration ===
[[File:Malta - Floriana - Valletta Waterfront - Laguna Marina - Child Migrants' Memorial 03 ies.jpg|thumb|Child Migrants' Memorial at the [[Valletta Waterfront]], commemorating the 310 Maltese child migrants who travelled to Australia between 1950 and 1965.]]
{{main|Emigration from Malta}}

Malta has long been a country of emigration, with big Maltese communities in English-speaking countries abroad.
Mass emigration picked up in the 19th century, reaching its peak in the decades after World War II. 

In the nineteenth century, most migration from Malta was to [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] (particularly [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Egypt]]), although rates of [[Repatriation|return migration]] to Malta were high.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Modern emigration from Malta|first=Huw R.|last=Jones|year=1973|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|volume=60|pages=101–119|jstor=621508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Maltese communities formed in these regions. By 1900, for example, British consular estimates suggest that there were 15,326 Maltese in [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref name="Attard"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great Exodus (1918–1939)|first=Lawrence E.|last=Attard|year=1989|location=Malta|publisher=Publishers Enterprises Group|url=http://www.maltamigration.com/history/exodus/chapter3-4.shtml?s=4E1675C4-7F000001-7DA803104013-6891|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406130103/http://www.maltamigration.com/history/exodus/chapter3-4.shtml?s=4E1675C4-7F000001-7DA803104013-6891|archivedate=6 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is little trace left of the Maltese communities in North Africa, most of them having been displaced, after the rise of independence movements, to places like [[Marseille]], the United Kingdom or Australia. 

After World War II, Malta's Emigration Department would assist emigrants with the cost of their travel. Between 1948 and 1967, 30 per cent of the population emigrated.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; Between 1946 and the late 1970s, over 140,000 people left Malta on the assisted passage scheme, with 57.6 per cent migrating to Australia, 22 per cent to the UK, 13 per cent to Canada and 7 per cent to the United States.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Maltese migration cycle: An archival survey|first=Russell|last=King|year=1979|journal=Area|volume=11|issue=3|pages=245–249|jstor=20001477}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Maltese Australians]]; [[Maltese people in the United Kingdom]])

46,998 Maltese-born residents were recorded by the 2001 [[Census in Australia|Australian Census]], 30,178 by the [[2001 UK Census]], 9,525 by the [[Canada 2001 Census|2001 Canadian Census]] and 9,080 by the [[2000 United States Census]].&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/23/34792376.xls |title=Country-of-birth database |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] |accessdate=3 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617032129/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/23/34792376.xls |archivedate=17 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emigration dropped dramatically after the mid-1970s and has since ceased to be a social phenomenon of significance. However, since Malta joined the [[European Union|EU]] in 2004 [[expatriate]] communities emerged in a number of European countries particularly in [[Maltese in Belgium|Belgium]] and Luxembourg. At the same time, Malta is becoming more and more attractive for communities of immigrants, both from Western and Northern Europe (Italians, Brits) and from Eastern Europe (Serbs).

{{main|Immigration to Malta}}

Most of the foreign community in Malta, predominantly active or retired British nationals and their dependents, is centred on [[Sliema]] and surrounding modern suburbs. Other smaller foreign groups include Italians, French, and [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], many of whom have assimilated into the Maltese nation over the decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20070805/opinion/genetic-origin-of-contemporary-maltese|title=Genetic origin of contemporary Maltese|first=Allied Newspapers|last=Ltd|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 20th century, Malta has become a transit country for migration routes from Africa towards Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malta guards Europe's gates against African immigrants|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/09/world/la-fg-malta-refugees-20101009|accessdate=30 April 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310075319/http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/09/world/la-fg-malta-refugees-20101009|archivedate=10 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a member of the [[European Union]] and of the [[Schengen agreement]], Malta is bound by the [[Dublin Regulation]] to process all claims for asylum by those asylum seekers that enter EU territory for the first time in Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Maltese Anger Mounts Over Rising Illegal Immigration|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,3621641,00.html|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irregular migrants (formal [[Maltese language|Maltese]]: ''immigranti irregolari'', informal: ''klandestini'') who land in Malta are subject to a [[immigration detention|compulsory detention policy]], being held in several camps organised by the [[Armed Forces of Malta]] (AFM), including those near [[Ħal Far]] and [[Safi, Malta|Ħal Safi]]. The compulsory detention policy has been denounced by several NGOs, and in July 2010, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] found that Malta's detention of migrants was arbitrary, lacking in adequate procedures to challenge detention, and in breach of its obligations under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/18/malta-migrant-detention-violates-rights|title=Malta: Migrant Detention Violates Rights|date=18 July 2012|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314162400/https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/18/malta-migrant-detention-violates-rights|archivedate=14 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malta faces problems with children of illegal immigrants|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20080610/local/malta-faces-problems-with-children-of-illegal-immigrants.211803|accessdate=30 April 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510111154/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20080610/local/malta-faces-problems-with-children-of-illegal-immigrants.211803|archivedate=10 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few migrants arrived in Malta in 2015, despite the fact that the rest Europe is experiencing a [[European migrant crisis|migrant crisis]]. Most migrants who were rescued between Libya and Malta were taken to Italy, and some refused to be brought to Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rescued migrants refusing to be brought to Malta|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150926/local/rescued-migrants-refusing-to-be-brought-to-malta.585856|accessdate=26 September 2015|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Duchy of Braganza''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: '''Ducado de Bragança''') has been the fief of an important [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Nobility|noble]] family: the [[House of Braganza]], and is one of the most important [[List of Dukedoms in Portugal|Dukedoms of Portugal]].  Created in 1442 by King [[Afonso V of Portugal]] for his uncle [[Afonso, Duke of Braganza|Afonso]], Count of Barcelos (natural son of [[John I of Portugal]]), it is one of the oldest [[fief]]doms in Portugal.

After the accession of the House of Braganza to the Portuguese throne in 1640, following the [[House of Habsburg]], the heir to the [[Portuguese monarchs|throne of Portugal]] was styled as the [[Duke of Braganza]] (see that article for further developments of the dukedom) together with [[Prince of Brazil]], and later [[Prince Royal of Portugal]].  After the foundation of the Portuguese Republic in 1910, the tradition of the heir to the throne being titled Duke of Braganza was revived by some pretenders to signify their claims to the throne.

==History==

The Duchy of Braganza, a [[List of Dukedoms in Portugal|Dukedom]], was created in 1442 by king [[Afonso V of Portugal]] for his uncle [[Afonso, Duke of Braganza|Afonso]], Count of Barcelos (natural son of [[John I of Portugal]]).  Along with the duchies of [[Duke of Coimbra|Coimbra]] and [[Duke of Viseu|Viseu]] created by [[John I of Portugal|John I]] for his sons Peter and Henry after their capture of [[Ceuta]] from the Moors in 1415, it is one of the first duchies of [[Portugal]].

By 1640, Portugal was on the verge of rebellion and a new Portuguese king had to be found. The choice fell upon the eighth duke, [[John IV of Portugal|John II of Braganza]], who had a claim both through his grandmother, Infanta Catherine, and through his great-great-grandfather, the 4th duke, nephew of King Manuel. The duke was a modest man without particular ambitions to the crown. Legend says that his wife, Leonor of Guzman, daughter of the duke of Medina-Sidónia, urged him to accept the offer saying, ''I'd rather be Queen for one day than duchess for a lifetime''. He accepted the leadership of the rebellion, which was successful, and was acclaimed John IV of Portugal on December 1, 1640.

After the accession of the Braganzas to the throne, the duchy was linked to the Crown and the Duke of Braganza became the traditional title of the heir to the Crown, together with or alternate to [[Prince of Beira]], much as [[Prince of Wales]] is in the United Kingdom. The fief itself became merged in the crown.

The '''Dynamic Microsimulation Model of the Czech Republic'''
&lt;ref name=Deloitte2&gt;{{cite book|last=Deloitte|title=The summary based on the Final Project Report of the Dynamic Micro-simulation Model of the Czech Republic|year=2011|publisher=Deloitte|url=http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_CZ/cz/publications/technical-articles/92ff26874a859310VgnVCM2000001b56f00aRCRD.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130102133027/http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_CZ/cz/publications/technical-articles/92ff26874a859310VgnVCM2000001b56f00aRCRD.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bednařík|first=Petr|title=Mikrosimulační model českého důchodového systému se stochastickými kariérami|journal=Pojistné rozpravy|year=2011|volume=28|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;
is a [[dynamic microsimulation pension model]] simulating the pension system of the [[Czech Republic]], owned by the [[Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcement of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs|url=http://www.mpsv.cz/files/clanky/10756/06052011.pdf|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model was developed in 2011 by [[Deloitte]]. The project was funded with support from the European Commission's Progress programme, for projects related to the development of administrative datasets and models for labour market and pension analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Commission, PROGRESS programme, Ref. No. VP/2009/006|url=http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=987&amp;langId=en&amp;callId=211&amp;furtherCalls=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==

The model was implemented by Deloitte (Actuarial &amp; Insurance Solutions, Central Europe)
&lt;ref name=Deloitte&gt;{{cite web|title=Deloitte A&amp;IS |url=http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_CZ/cz/services/consulting/actuarial/index.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121144946/http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_CZ/cz/services/consulting/actuarial/index.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
using a software system called Prophet developed by [[SunGard]]. A special library containing the entire code was prepared by Deloitte specifically for this purpose.&lt;ref name=Deloitte2 /&gt; Deloitte had previously developed and implemented similar pension models in other countries, such as Hungary.&lt;ref name=GHOD2009&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gál, R. I. |author2=Horváth, A. |author3=Orbán, G. |author4=&amp; Dekkers, G. |title=PENMICRO: Monitoring pension developments through micro socioeconomic instruments based on individual data sources: feasibility study|year=2009|publisher=TARKI Social Research Institute|pages=67|url=http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&amp;catId=89&amp;newsId=490&amp;furtherNews=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dynamic Microsimulation Model allowed the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs to use individual data, along with aggregate results, to explore the impact on [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] of [[pension]]s, poverty of pensioners, impact of the changes of the pension formula on distributional properties of the pension system and so on.

The model is parametrised to the existing pension system. However, all the major parameters of the current system are stored in the system of tables and can be changed in order to investigate the impact of the parameter change on the pension system. The model also includes the functionality of a funded pillar and enables simulation of the impact of introduction of the funded pillar.

{{History of Myanmar}}

The '''First Toungoo Empire''' ({{lang-my|တောင်ငူ ခေတ်}}, {{IPA-my|tàʊɴŋù kʰɪʔ|}}; also known as the '''First Toungoo Dynasty''', the '''Second Burmese Empire''' or simply the '''Toungoo Empire''') was the dominant power in [[mainland Southeast Asia]] in the second half of the 16th century. At its peak, Toungoo "exercised suzerainty from [[Manipur]] to the [[Cambodia]]n marches and from the borders of [[Kingdom of Mrauk U|Arakan]] to [[Yunnan]]" and was "probably the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia."&lt;ref name=vbl-151-152/&gt; The "most adventurous and militarily successful" dynasty in [[History of Myanmar|Burmese history]] was also the "shortest-lived."&lt;ref name=atat-137-138/&gt;

The empire grew out of the principality of Toungoo, a minor vassal state of [[Ava Kingdom|Ava]] until 1510. The landlocked petty state began its rise in the 1530s under [[Tabinshwehti]] who went on to found the largest polity in [[Myanmar]] since the [[Pagan Kingdom|Pagan Empire]] by 1550. His more celebrated successor [[Bayinnaung]] then greatly expanded the empire, conquering much of mainland Southeast Asia by 1565. He spent the next decade keeping the empire intact, putting down rebellions in [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Siam]], [[Lan Xang]] and the northernmost [[Shan states]]. From 1576 onwards, he declared a large sphere of influence in westerly lands—trans-Manipur states, Arakan and [[Ceylon]]. The empire, held together by [[patron-client relationship]]s, declined soon after his death in 1581. His successor [[Nanda Bayin|Nanda]] never gained the full support of the vassal rulers, and presided over the empire's precipitous collapse in the next 18 years.

The First Toungoo Empire marked the end of the period of petty kingdoms in mainland Southeast Asia. Although the overextended empire proved ephemeral, the forces that underpinned its rise were not. Its two main successor states—[[Nyaungyan period|Restored Toungoo Burma]] and Ayutthaya Siam—went on to dominate western and central mainland Southeast Asia, respectively, down to the mid-18th century.

==Backgrounder==

===Name of the period===
The polity is known by a number of names. The prevailing terms used by most international scholars are the "First Toungoo Dynasty";&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-13&gt;Lieberman 1984: 13&lt;/ref&gt; the "First Toungoo Empire";&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-15&gt;Lieberman 1984: 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hj-1291&gt;James 2004: 1291&lt;/ref&gt; and/or the "Second Burmese Empire".&lt;ref name=mha-104&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-td&gt;Lieberman 1984: transcriptions, dates&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional Burmese historiography, however, the period is known as either the "Toungoo–Hanthawaddy Period" ({{lang-my-Mymr|တောင်ငူ–ဟံသာဝတီ ခေတ်}}), or simply the "Toungoo Period" ({{lang-my-Mymr|တောင်ငူ ခေတ်}}).&lt;ref group=note&gt;Some historians of Burmese origin have used “Toungoo Dynasty” in English language publications to mean just the First Toungoo period as used in Burmese historiography. See (Aung-Thwin and Aung-Thwin 2012: 129) for example.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, in international usage, the terms "Toungoo Dynasty/Empire" cover both "First Toungoo Dynasty/Empire" and "Restored Toungoo Dynasty/Empire".&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-15/&gt;&lt;ref name=geh-153&gt;Harvey 1925: 153&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Burmese historiography treats the Restored Toungoo Dynasty/Empire period as a separate era called the [[Nyaungyan period]] ({{lang-my-Mymr|ညောင်ရမ်း ခေတ်}}).&lt;ref name=atat-143&gt;Aung-Thwin and Aung-Thwin 2012: 143&lt;/ref&gt;

===Place names===
This article, for the most part, uses prevailing academic names for place names, not the current official English transliterations in use in Myanmar since 1989. For example, the official English spelling of the city after which the dynasty is named since 1989 has been "Taungoo", replacing the older spelling of Toungoo; likewise, the older spellings such as Ava, Pegu, Martaban are now Inwa, Bago and Mottama; and so on. However, the changes have not been adopted in international publications on Burmese history.&lt;ref group=note&gt;See (Lieberman 2003), (Myint-U 2006), (Aung-Thwin and Aung-Thwin 2012). Even historians such as Michael Aung-Thwin and Thant Myint-U, who use Myanmar to refer to the country, nonetheless use older terms such as Ava, Toungoo, Pegu, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Principality of Toungoo===
{{see also|List of rulers of Toungoo}}
[[File:Toungoo ou taungû.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of old Toungoo (Taungoo) from a later period, though the 14th-century Toungoo might not have been much different.]]

The earliest known record of administration of the region dates to the late [[Pagan Kingdom|Pagan period]]. In 1191, King [[Narapatisithu|Sithu II]] (r. 1174–1211) appointed [[Ananda Thuriya of Kanba Myint|Ananda Thuriya]] governor of [[Yedashe Township|Kanba Myint]]. In 1279, two great grandsons of Ananda Thuriya—[[Thawun Gyi]] and [[Thawun Nge]]—founded a new settlement of 370 households, about 40&amp;nbsp;km farther south.&lt;ref name=sll-18&gt;Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 18&lt;/ref&gt; It was named Toungoo (Taungoo) ({{my|တောင်ငူ}}, "Hill's Spur") because of its location by the hills in the narrow [[Sittaung river]] valley between the [[Bago Yoma]] range and southern [[Shan Hills]].&lt;ref name=sll-15&gt;Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrow valley at the southern edge of the dry zone was not easily accessible from Central or Upper Burma; the best access to the region was from the south, via the Sittaung. Its hard-to-reach location would shape much of its early history. In the 14th century, the settlement grew to be the principal city of the frontier region, which remained a lawless place. Toungoo's first rebellion of 1317–18 failed but its nominal overlord [[Pinya]] had little control over it. Usurpers routinely seized office by assassinating the governor—in 1325, 1344 and 1347—without incurring any reprisals by Pinya.&lt;ref group=note&gt;(Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 19–20): Pinya responded to the first assassination, of Thuwun Gyi in 1317 by Thawun Nge, by sending an army there. Even then, the army returned when Thawun Nge agreed to submit, and allowed Thawun Nge to remain in office. Similarly, later assassin-turned-rulers per (Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 20–22) may have nominally submitted to Pinya.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1358, Toungoo outright revolted.&lt;ref name=sll-22&gt;Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 22&lt;/ref&gt; Pinya's successor [[Ava Kingdom|Ava]] (Inwa) regained Toungoo in 1367 but gubernatorial assassinations continued: 1375, 1376 and 1383, at times with Ava's own permission. Only in 1399 could Ava impose tighter control.&lt;ref name=sll-23-25&gt;Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 23–25&lt;/ref&gt;

By then, Toungoo, along with [[Pyay|Prome]] (Pyay), had received waves of Burmese-speaking migrants, driven out of Upper Burma by the successive [[Shan people|Shan]] raids in the second half of the 14th century, and both southern vassal states had emerged as new centres of economic activity as well as of [[Bamar|Burman]] (Bamar) culture.&lt;ref name=vbl-150&gt;Lieberman 2003: 150&lt;/ref&gt; Toungoo's growth continued especially after the [[Forty Years' War]] (1385–1424) left Ava exhausted. From 1425 onwards, Ava regularly faced rebellions whenever a new king came to power, who then had to restore order, often by war. Toungoo's “relentlessly ambitious leaders” repeatedly tested Ava's resolve by staging assassinations (in 1440, 1451, and 1459)&lt;ref name=sll-30-33-34&gt;Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 30, 33, 34&lt;/ref&gt; and rebellions (in 1426–40, 1451–59 and 1468–70) at times with Pegu's help.&lt;ref name=vbl-150/&gt;&lt;ref name=sll-28-37&gt;Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 28–30, 33–35, 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Start of Toungoo dynasty===
{{main|Toungoo dynasty}}
In 1470, King [[Thihathura of Ava]] (r. 1468–80) appointed [[Sithu Kyawhtin of Toungoo|Sithu Kyawhtin]], the general who put down the latest Toungoo rebellion, viceroy-general of the restive province. A distant member of the Ava royalty, Sithu Kyawhtin remained loyal to Thihathura's successor [[Minkhaung II]] (r. 1480–1501), who was greeted with a wave of rebellions by lords of [[Yamethin]] (1480), [[Salin, Myanmar|Salin]] (1481) and Prome (1482). Sithu Kyawhtin died in action at Yamethin in 1481, and was succeeded by his son [[Min Sithu of Toungoo|Min Sithu]].&lt;ref name=sll-37-38&gt;Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1485, Min Sithu became the [[List of rulers of Toungoo|eleventh ruler of Toungoo]] to be assassinated in office. The assassin was none other than his nephew [[Mingyi Nyo]] (r. 1510–30). It would be yet another rebellion except that Nyo won Minkhaung's acquiescence by offering his full support to the embattled king.&lt;ref name=sll-51-52&gt;Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; Nyo turned out to be an able leader. He quickly brought law and order to the region, which attracted refugees from other parts of Central and Upper Burma. Using increased manpower, he sponsored a series of elaborate reclamation and irrigation projects to compensate for the Sittaung valley's modest agriculture.&lt;ref name=vbl-150/&gt;

By the 1490s, Toungoo had grown, and a more confident Nyo began to test the limits of his authority. He built a new “palace”, replete with royal pretensions, in 1491.&lt;ref name=sll-57&gt;Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 57&lt;/ref&gt; He then, without Ava's permission, raided [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom|Hanthawaddy]] territory, during the southern kingdom's succession crisis. It was a disaster: Toungoo barely survived the 1495–96 counterattack by King [[Binnya Ran II]] (r. 1492–1526). At Ava, Minkhaung ignored Nyo's transgressions for he needed Nyo's support against Yamethin.&lt;ref name=sll-59-61&gt;Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 59–61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Break from Ava===
[[File:Burma (Myanmar) in 1530.png|thumb|left|Political map of Burma (Myanmar) in 1530]]
Toungoo's inevitable break with Ava came soon after the death of Minkhaung II in 1501. The new king [[Shwenankyawshin|Narapati II]] (r. 1501–27) was greeted with a new round of rebellions. By 1502, Mingyi Nyo had already decided to break away despite Narapati's desperate attempt to retain his loyalty by granting the all-important [[Kyaukse district|Kyaukse granary]].&lt;ref name=sll-64&gt;Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 64&lt;/ref&gt; In 1503, Nyo's forces began surreptitiously aiding ongoing rebellions in the south. In 1504, he openly entered into an alliance with Prome with the intention of taking over all of Central Burma. But Ava was not yet a spent force. It decisively defeated the alliance's raids in 1504–05 and in 1507–08.&lt;ref name=sll-66-67&gt;Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 66–67&lt;/ref&gt;

The setbacks forced Mingyi Nyo to recalibrate his ambitions. He formally declared independence from Ava in 1510 but also withdrew from participating in the internecine warfare.&lt;ref group=note&gt;(Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 103–106): Though Toungoo stayed out of the warfare, for the most part, it continued to aid Ava's enemies. It even seized Yamethin and Taungdwin in March 1523. But Ava counterattacked and retook the lands in early 1526.&lt;/ref&gt; Ava could not and did not take any action. It was facing an existential threat in the ongoing war with the [[Confederation of Shan States]], and would ultimately fall in 1527.&lt;ref name=sll-107&gt;Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 107&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, Nyo focused on strengthening the economy and the stability of his kingdom. His policy of non-interference attracted refugees to the only region in Upper Burma at peace. By his death in 1530, Mingyi Nyo had successfully turned Toungoo into a small but strong regional power. History shows that the former vassal was about to "overawe the metropole".&lt;ref name=vbl-150-151&gt;Lieberman 2003: 150–151&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise===
[[File:Toungoo campaigns (1534–1547).png|thumb|250px|Toungoo military campaigns (1534–47)]]
[[File:Tabinshwehti Nat.jpg|left|thumb|King Tabinshwehti depicted as the Tabinshwehti ''[[Nat (spirit)|Nat]]'']]

The period between 1526 and 1533 saw power change hands in all of the major states of Burma. Three of the states were succeeded by weak rulers: [[Takayutpi|Taka Yut Pi]] (r. 1526–39) at Hanthawaddy; [[Bayin Htwe]] (r. 1526–32) and [[Narapati of Prome|Narapati]] (r. 1532–39) at Prome; and [[Thohanbwa]] (r. 1533–42) at Ava (Confederation). Two of the states were succeeded by ambitious and able rulers: [[Tabinshwehti]] (r. 1530–50) at Toungoo, and [[Min Bin]] (r. 1531–54) at [[Mrauk-U Kingdom|Mrauk-U (Arakan)]]. Though Arakan would become a power in its own right, its geographic isolation meant it would remain a marginal player in mainland affairs. This left the tiny Toungoo, which would bring war to much of mainland Southeast Asia till the end of the century.&lt;ref name=vbl-150/&gt;

The initial impetus for Toungoo's military campaigns was defensive. The landlocked state was being encircled by the powerful Confederation, which by 1533 had defeated its erstwhile ally Prome. Fortunately for Toungoo, the Confederation's paramount leader [[Sawlon|Saw Lon]] was assassinated a few months later, and the coalition suddenly ceased to be a coherent force.&lt;ref name=geh-153&gt;Harvey 1925: 153&lt;/ref&gt; Tabinshwehti and his court decided to take advantage of the lull, and break out of their increasingly narrow realm by attacking Hanthawaddy, the larger and wealthier but disunited kingdom to the south. In 1534, Toungoo forces began annual raids into Hanthawaddy territory. They finally broke through in 1538, capturing [[Bago, Burma|Pegu]] (Bago) and the Irrawaddy delta.&lt;ref name=vbl-151&gt;Lieberman 2003: 151&lt;/ref&gt; In 1539, Tabinshwehti moved the capital to Pegu where it would remain until the end of the century.&lt;ref name=vbl-151/&gt;

Toungoo went on to [[Toungoo–Hanthawaddy War (1534–41)|conquer all of Lower Burma]] by 1541, gaining complete control of Lower Burma's manpower, access to [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] firearms and maritime wealth to pay for them. And Tabinshwehti would quickly exploit these new found assets for further expansions.&lt;ref name=geh-154-155&gt;Harvey 1925: 154–155&lt;/ref&gt; By incorporating Portuguese mercenaries, firearms and military tactics as well as experienced former Hanthawaddy military commanders to the [[Royal Burmese armed forces|Toungoo armed forces]], the upstart kingdom [[Toungoo–Ava War (1538–45)|seized up to Pagan (Bagan)]] from the Confederation by 1545.&lt;ref name=hy-2-220-222&gt;Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 220–222&lt;/ref&gt; The campaigns against [[Toungoo–Mrauk-U War (1545–47)|Arakan (1545–47)]] and [[Burmese–Siamese War (1547–49)|Siam (1547–49)]], however, fell short. In both campaigns, Toungoo forces won all major open battles but could not overcome the heavily fortified defences of [[Mrauk-U]] and [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]].&lt;ref name=geh-158-160&gt;Harvey 1925: 158–160&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the setbacks, Tabinshwehti had founded the most powerful polity in Burma since the fall of Pagan in 1287. The king attempted to forge a "Mon–Burman synthesis" by actively courting the support of ethnic Mons of Lower Burma, many of whom were appointed to the highest positions in his government and armed forces.&lt;ref name=vbl-199&gt;Lieberman 2003: 199&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
[[File:Toungoo campaigns (1550–1565).png|thumb|left|250px|Major military campaigns and the expansion of Toungoo Empire (1550–65)]]
[[File:Bayinnaung.JPG|thumb|Statue of King Bayinnaung in front of the [[National Museum of Myanmar|National Museum]] in Yangon]]
But the nascent empire fell apart right after Tabinshwehti was assassinated in 1550. Several vassal rulers immediately declared independence, forcing Tabinshwehti's chosen successor [[Bayinnaung]] (r. 1550–81) to reunify the kingdom in the next two years. Bayinnaung then pushed up the Irrawaddy in an effort to join Upper Burma and Lower Burma for the first time since Pagan. Victory in the north "promised to strengthen control over interior gems and bullion, and to supply additional levies."&lt;ref name=vbl-151-152&gt;Lieberman 2003: 151–152&lt;/ref&gt; In 1555, Upper Burma fell to the southern forces. Over the next decade, a series of “breathtaking campaigns” reduced [[Manipur]] and the entire [[Tai languages|Tai-Shan]] world to tributary status: cis-[[Salween]] [[Shan states]] (1557), [[Lan Na]] (1558), [[Manipur]] (1560), [[Keng Tung]] (1562), the [[Mong Mao|Chinese Shan States]] (1563), [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Siam]] (1564) and [[Lan Xang]] (1565).&lt;ref name=vbl-151-152/&gt;

The victories were enabled by a more martial culture and greater military experience of Toungoo armies, Portuguese firearms, and the greater manpower that came with each successive victory. The conquests ended at a stroke, over two centuries of Shan raids into Upper Burma, and "extended lowland control much farther than Pagan had dreamed possible:" Pegu now “exercised suzerainty from Manipur to the Cambodian marches and from the borders of Arakan to Yunnan.”&lt;ref name=vbl-151-152/&gt;

Bayinnaung's authority would be vigorously contested in the following decade. His forces never quite vanquished the Lan Xang resistance in the Laotian hills and jungles, and in 1568, Siam, the most powerful vassal state, revolted.&lt;ref name=geh-168-169&gt;Harvey 1925: 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; Leveraging the manpower of much of the western and central mainland, he managed to defeat the Siamese rebellion with great difficulty in 1569.&lt;ref name=geh-170&gt;Harvey 1925: 170&lt;/ref&gt; Yet defeating the guerrilla resistance at the remote hill states—[[Mohnyin]] and [[Mogaung]] in the extreme north also revolted in 1571—proved far more difficult. Toungoo armies suffered heavy casualties from disease and starvation in their fruitless annual campaigns in search of elusive bands of rebels. Pegu reestablished some semblance of control over Lan Xang only in 1575&lt;ref name=my-3-44-45&gt;Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; and Mohnyin and Mogaung in 1576.&lt;ref name=my-3-48-50&gt;Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 48–50&lt;/ref&gt;

No sooner than the Tai-Shan world finally became quiet, the king turned his attention to [[Portuguese India|Portuguese Goa]] and the advancing [[Mughal Empire]] in the west. In response to competing requests by the Ceylonese kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Kotte|Kotte]] and [[Kingdom of Kandy|Kandy]] for military aid, he finally sent an elite army in 1576 to Kotte, which he considered a protectorate, ostensibly to protect Theravada Buddhism on the island from the Portuguese threat.&lt;ref name=geh-174&gt;Harvey 1925: 174&lt;/ref&gt; Goa considered it was technically at war with Pegu although no war ever broke out.&lt;ref name=app-118-119/&gt; Closer to home, he responded to the Mughals' 1576 annexation of Bengal by claiming the entire swath of lands in present-day northeast India, as far west as the Ganges&lt;ref name=yt-2-lxxx/&gt;&lt;ref name=my-76/&gt; and by sending an invasion force to Arakan in 1580.&lt;ref name=geh-174/&gt;

Bayinnaung's empire was "probably the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia,"&lt;ref name=vbl-152&gt;Lieberman 2003: 152&lt;/ref&gt; and what the Portuguese regarded as "the most powerful monarchy in Asia except that of China".&lt;ref name=chsea-72-73&gt;Tarling 1999: 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; The king standardised laws, calendars, weights and measurements, and Buddhist religious practices throughout the land.&lt;ref name=mha-127&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=geh-171&gt;Harvey 1925: 171&lt;/ref&gt; But he introduced administrative reforms only at the margins. The "absurdly overextended" empire was largely held together by his personal relationships with the vassal rulers, who were loyal to him and not to Toungoo Burma.&lt;ref name=vbl-154-155&gt;Lieberman 2003: 154–155&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline and fall===
In the tradition of the prevailing [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|Southeast Asian administrative model]], every new high king had to establish his authority with the vassals all over again. This was already a difficult task when vassals were situated in the same geographic region but nearly impossible with faraway lands, given inherent difficulties in bringing serious warfare to those lands.&lt;ref name=atat-137-138&gt;Aung-Thwin and Aung-Thwin 2012: 137–138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vbl-154-155/&gt;

King [[Nanda Bayin|Nanda]] (r. 1581–99) never gained the full support of his father's chosen vassal rulers. Within the first three years of his reign, both Ava and Ayutthaya revolted. Though he managed to defeat the Ava rebellion in 1584, the king never did establish firm control over Upper Burma and the surrounding Shan states. He could not get the most populous region in Burma to contribute much to his war effort in Siam. (His best troop levels were never more than a third of his father's.) He should have focused on reestablishing his authority in Upper Burma, and let Siam go—but he could not see it.&lt;ref name=geh-181&gt;Harvey 1925: 181&lt;/ref&gt; He feared that acknowledging Ayutthaya's independence would invite yet more Tai rebellions, some perhaps closer to home.&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-39&gt;Lieberman 1984: 39&lt;/ref&gt; Nanda launched [[Burmese–Siamese War (1584–93)|five major punitive campaigns against Siam]] between 1584 and 1593, all of which failed disastrously. With each Siamese victory, other vassals grew more inclined to throw off allegiance and more reluctant to contribute military forces. By the late 1580s and early 1590s, Pegu had to lean ever more heavily on the already modest population of Lower Burma for the debilitating war effort. Able men all over Lower Burma fled military service to become monks, debt slaves, private retainers, or refugees in nearby kingdoms. As more cultivators fled, rice prices in Lower Burma reached unheard of levels.&lt;ref name=geh-180&gt;Harvey 1925: 180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vbl-156&gt;Lieberman 2003: 156&lt;/ref&gt;

The empire's precipitous collapse ensued. Siam seized the entire [[Tenasserim coast]] in 1595, and the rest of the vassals had broken away—de jure or de facto—by 1597. The breakaway state of Toungoo and the western kingdom of Arakan jointly invaded Lower Burma in 1598, and captured Pegu in 1599. The allies thoroughly looted, and burned down the imperial capital, “one of the wonders of Asia”, in 1600.&lt;ref name=vbl-156/&gt; The First Toungoo Dynasty, “the most adventurous and militarily successful in the country's history”, ceased to exist; it was also the "shortest-lived" major dynasty.&lt;ref name=atat-137-138/&gt; The First Toungoo Empire was "a victim of its own success." Its "stunning military conquests were not matched by stable administrative controls in the Tai world or outlying areas of the Irrawaddy basin," and the "overheated" empire "disintegrated no less rapidly than it had been constructed".&lt;ref name=vbl-155-156&gt;Liberman 2003: 155–156&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
[[File:Restored Taungoo Dynasty.png|thumb|250px|The restored Taungoo dynasty, or Nyaungyan dynasty, c. 1650]]
Even before the fall of Pegu, the breakaway states of the empire had been engaged in a series of “confused, many-sided wars” since the mid-1590s.&lt;ref name=vbl-158&gt;Lieberman 2003: 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Prome attacked Toungoo in 1595.&lt;ref name=my-3-96&gt;Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 96&lt;/ref&gt; Prome and Ava fought for central Burma in 1596–97.&lt;ref name=my-3-97-112&gt;Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 97, 112&lt;/ref&gt; Prome and Toungoo later agreed to attack Ava in 1597 but Toungoo broke off the alliance and attacked Prome in 1597.&lt;ref name=my-3-112-113&gt;Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 112–113&lt;/ref&gt; In the central mainland, Lan Xang and Lan Na went to war in 1595–96 and again in 1598–1603.&lt;ref name=nc-68-69&gt;Ratchasomphan 1994: 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ss-92&gt;Simms and Simms 2001: 92&lt;/ref&gt; Siam supported a Chiang Rai rebellion against Lan Na (Chiang Mai) in 1599.&lt;ref name=jf-50-51&gt;Fernquest 2005: 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; By 1601, Lan Na was divided into three spheres: Chiang Mai, Siam-backed Chiang Rai, Lan Xang-backed Nan. Chiang Mai defeated the Siam-backed rebellion in Chiang Rai in 1602 only to submit to Ayutthaya later that year.&lt;ref name=jf-52&gt;Fernquest 2005: 52&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang Mai retook Nan from Lan Xang in 1603.&lt;ref name=nc-68-69/&gt; In the western mainland, Siam invaded Lower Burma in 1600, and went on to attack Toungoo only to be driven back by Toungoo's ally Arakan.&lt;ref name=mha-134&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 134&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese garrison at Syriam switched allegiance from Arakan to Goa in 1603.&lt;ref name=tt-2011-135-136&gt;Than Tun 2011: 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; Siamese vassal Martaban then entered into an alliance with Portuguese Syriam.&lt;ref name=tt-2011-135-136/&gt; Ava had seized cis-Salween Shan states by 1604. Siam planned to invade Ava's vassal southern Shan states in 1605 before cancelling it because of the sudden death of its warrior king [[Naresuan]] (r. 1590–1605).&lt;ref name=my-3-128&gt;Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jf-53&gt;Fernquest 2005: 53&lt;/ref&gt; Ava conquered Prome (1608), Toungoo (1610), Portuguese Syriam (1613), Siamese Martaban and Tavoy (1613), and Lan Na (1614).&lt;ref name=mha-139&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=geh-185-189&gt;Harvey 1925: 185–189&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, in contrast to 250 years of political fragmentation that followed Pagan's collapse, this interregnum proved brief. As ephemeral as the overextended Toungoo Empire was, the underlying forces that underpinned its rise were not. By 1622, a branch of the fallen house (known retrospectively as the Restored Toungoo Dynasty or Nyaungyan Dynasty) had succeeded in reconstituting a major portion of the First Toungoo Empire, except for Siam, Lan Xang and Manipur. The new dynasty did not overextend itself by trying to take over Siam or Lan Xang. This was a more “realistic and organic” polity that would last until the mid-18th century.&lt;ref name=vbl-161&gt;Lieberman 2003: 161&lt;/ref&gt; The new dynasty proceeded to create a political and legal system whose basic features would continue under the [[Konbaung dynasty]] (1752–1885) well into the 19th century.&lt;ref name=vbl-158/&gt;

==Government==
The Toungoo Empire was “in theory and fact, a poly-ethnic political formation.”&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-td/&gt; The Toungoo kings largely employed then prevailing Southeast Asian [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|administrative model of solar polities]] in which the high king ruled the core while semi-independent tributaries, autonomous viceroys, and governors actually controlled day-to-day administration and manpower.&lt;ref name=vbl-35&gt;Lieberman 2003: 35&lt;/ref&gt; The system did not work well even for mid-size kingdoms like Ava and Siam. Now, because of the sheer size of the empire, the system was even more decentralised and stretched thinner still. At any rate, it was the only system the Toungoo kings knew, and they "had no choice but to retain it."&lt;ref name=vbl-154-156/&gt; The kings attempted administrative reforms only at the margins, which proved insufficient to hold the empire after Bayinnaung. Indeed, "Bayinnaung's goal of controlling virtually the entire mainland from Pegu proved utterly mad."&lt;ref name=vbl-275&gt;Lieberman 2003: 275&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative Divisions===

====Core Region====
The dynasty's original home was the Toungoo region, with the capital at Toungoo. But from 1539 onward, the High King, styled as “King of Kings”, moved the capital to Pegu (Bago), and governed only what used to be the Hanthawaddy Kingdom.&lt;ref name=vbl-151/&gt;&lt;ref name=geh-171&gt;Harvey 1925: 171&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time in Burmese history that a capital, which had the authority over the entire Irrawaddy basin, was located near the coast.&lt;ref name=vbl-151/&gt; The Toungoo kings retained the traditional three-province structure of the old Hanthawaddy Kingdom;&lt;ref name=geh-171/&gt; Bayinnaung later annexed the Siamese Province of Mergui into the core administration for its maritime revenues.&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-31&gt;Lieberman 1984: 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The province was annexed at least by 1568 per (Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 295) when the governor of Tenasserim built a gate at the new Pegu city. Since the construction of the city began in 1565, the annexation may have taken place in 1565.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

The provinces and their constituent divisions were ruled by vassal rulers,&lt;ref group=note&gt;One exception was that the Martaban Province had a viceroy, [[Minye Sithu of Martaban|Minye Sithu]] between 1552 and 1556 and another, [[Thiri Thudhamma Yaza of Martaban|Thiri Thudhamma Yaza]], between 1581 and 1584.&lt;/ref&gt; who lived off apanage grants and local taxes. The core region's bureaucracy was a continuation of the old Hanthawaddy court. Most local governors as well as most officials and ministers at the Pegu court—e.g., [[Saw Lagun Ein]], [[Smim Payu]], [[Binnya Dala (minister-general)|Binnya Dala]], Binnya Law, Daw Binnya, Binnya Kyan Htaw—were most probably ethnic [[Mon people|Mons]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;These were ethnic Mon titles, and the majority of them were likely ethnic Mons. But not all officials with Mon titles were ethnic Mons. For example, per (Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 280), the leader of the 1565 rebellion at Pegu, was styled as Binnya Kyan Htaw but was an ethnic Shan. Similarly, about two hundred years later, kings [[Smim Htaw Buddhaketi]] and [[Binnya Dala]] of the Restored Hanthawaddy, despite their Mon titles, were ethnic Burman and Shan, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; The word used by European visitors to describe a court official was semini, Italian translation of ''smim'', Mon for lord.&lt;ref name=geh-178&gt;Harvey 1925: 178&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kingdoms====
Surrounding the core region were the tributary kingdoms. The vassal rulers were still styled as kings, and were allowed to retain full royal regalia. They were required to send tributes to the crown but they generally had a freehand in the rest of the administration. Pegu generally did not get involved in local administration; its remit was national. The court launched standardisation drives to unify laws, weights and measurements, calendars, and Buddhist reforms throughout the empire.&lt;ref name=chsea-72-73/&gt;&lt;ref name=mha-127/&gt;&lt;ref name=geh-171/&gt; The court also drew the borders between the vassal states.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Pegu kept Prome and Toungoo, traditional vassal states of Ava, as separate kingdoms. It also annexed Tennaserim from Siam to Hanthawaddy. The court also placed much contested regions between Lan Na and Lan Xang under the Chiang Mai administration.&lt;/ref&gt; But the centuries-old disputes never went away. They resurfaced as soon as Pegu's authority waned, and resulted in the confused, multi-party wars of 1590s and 1600s.

The Pegu court did not possess a centrally run bureaucracy, as Restored Toungoo and Konbaung dynasties would attempt, to administer the vassal states. Unlike in later periods, Pegu even at the height of the empire maintained no permanent military garrisons, or representatives in the vassal states to keep an eye on the local ruler in the peacetime.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Pegu maintained garrisons only for short durations: e.g., at Chiang Mai (1558–59, 1564–65), at Ayutthaya (1569–70), at Ava (1593–97). [[Vientiane]] was a costly exception. Pegu kept a garrison there throughout the 1560s and 1570s when the garrison was not overrun (1568, and 1571/72), or kept out (1568–69; 1572–74).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the High King heavily depended on the vassal king to be both loyal and able. Ineffective vassal rulers, who did not command respect from their local sub-vassal rulers, such as those in Lan Xang and in Upper Burma after 1584, only brought constant trouble for the crown. On the other hand, able kings such as [[Mahathammarachathirat (king of Ayutthaya)|Maha Thammarachathirat]] (r. 1569–90) of Siam and [[Thado Minsaw of Ava]] (r. 1555–84) kept their kingdoms peaceful for the High King they were loyal to: Bayinnaung. The downside was that the able rulers were also the most likely to revolt when the High King was not Bayinnaung; and they did.

====Princely states====
A rank below the vassal kingdoms were the princely states, ruled by ''[[saopha|sawbwas]]'' (chiefs, princes). Except for [[Manipur]], they were all [[Shan states]] that ringed the upper Irrawaddy valley (i.e. the Kingdom of Ava) from the Kalay State in the northwest to the Mong Pai State in the southeast. Manipur was not a Shan state, and its ruler styled himself ''raja'' (king). Nevertheless, Pegu classified the ''raja'' a "''sawbwa''", and treated Manipur as another princely state, albeit a major one. Two other major states were Kengtung and Mogaung, whose rulers retained the full royal regalia.

For administrative purposes, the court grouped the states into provinces (''taing'' (တိုင်း)). During Bayinnaung's reign, Ava served as the intermediary between Pegu and the hill states. But in Nanda's reign, the court became concerned by the overly close relationship between Thado Minsaw and the ''sawbwas''. From 1584 onwards except for 1587–93, Nanda pursued a policy of devolution in the upcountry in which Ava's role was essentially eliminated. The direct rule did not work as evidenced by the near total absence of contribution from the Shan states and Manipur towards Pegu's war effort in Siam.

Bayinnaung considered control of the Shan states of utmost strategic importance for his hold of the upcountry. Raids by nearby highland Shan states had been an overhanging concern for successive lowland regimes since the 14th century. The most feared were Mohnyin and Mogaung, the twin Shan states, which led most of the raids. Bayinnaung introduced a key administrative reform, which turned out to be his most important and most enduring of his legacies.&lt;ref name=mha-117-118&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 117–118&lt;/ref&gt; The king permitted the ''sawbwas'' to retain their feudal rights over their subjects. The office of the ''sawbwa'' remained hereditary. But the incumbent ''sawbwa'' could now be removed by the king for gross misconduct although the king's choice of successor was limited to members of the ''sawbwa's'' own family. The key innovation was that he required sons of his vassal rulers to reside in the palace as pages, who served a dual purpose: they were hostages for good conduct of their fathers and they received valuable training in Burmese court life. His Shan policy was followed by all Burmese kings right up to the final fall of the kingdom to the British in 1885.&lt;ref name=mha-117-118/&gt;

====Spheres of influence====
According to contemporary sources, Pegu also claimed lands far beyond the princely states as tributaries or protectorates. Scholarship does not accept the claims of control; the states were at least what Pegu considered within its sphere of influence. The claims include:

| Sein Taing

| The Province of Sein ("Chinese Province") reportedly included lands beyond Kawsampi (Ko Shan Pyay).&lt;ref name=yt-2-lxxx/&gt; The exact border was not mentioned during Bayinnaung's and Nanda's reigns (although the [[Mekong]] presumably could have served as the natural border).&lt;ref group=note&gt;See the maps in (Harvey 1925: 151) and (Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 44) both of which mark the border with Ming China on the Mekong at Kenghung. Sein Lwin Lay's border goes farther up along the Mekong's than Harvey's.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1594, China established eight frontier “Iron Gates” inside Yunnan,&lt;ref name=geh-323&gt;Harvey 1925: 323&lt;/ref&gt; which Restored Toungoo kings came to regard as the de facto border.&lt;ref group=note&gt;(Than Tun Vol. 1 1983: 18–19, 181–182): The royal order dated 14 November 1598 (1st waning of Tazaungmon 960 ME) by King [[Nyaungyan Min|Nyaungyan]] says that the extent of Nyaungyan's domain included the Iron Bridge in the east, Siam in the south, the sea coast in the west, and Manipur and northern Shan states (Kachin State) in the north.&lt;/ref&gt; To be sure, Ming China did not view the gates as the extent of its realm, and continued to claim lands beyond the gates.

Indeed, Pegu's authority dissipated as soon as the armies departed. The lack of firm authority over Lan Xang was the reason why the fruitless campaigns had to be undertaken year-after-year in the first place.

After 1576, Goa considered it was technically at war with Burma for her interference in Ceylon.&lt;ref name=app-118-119&gt;Phayre 1967: 118–119&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

The expansive spheres of influence shrank greatly after Bayinnaung's death. Nanda, according to a 1593 inscription, continued to claim his father's realm even after his latest defeat in Siam.&lt;ref name=yt-2-lxxx/&gt; In reality, he never had full control of the upcountry, let alone the peripheral states.

====Size====
The size of the empire was approximately between 1.5 and 1.6 million km², without counting the far-flung claimed spheres of influence. Scholarship agrees that the Empire controlled at least much of modern Myanmar (except northern Arakan/Rakhine), Siam (which in the 16th century included modern western Cambodia, and possibly northern Malaysia), Lan Na (northern Thailand), Lan Xang (modern Laos and northeastern Thailand), Manipur and Chinese Shan states (modern southern Yunnan).&lt;ref name=vbl-151-152/&gt;&lt;ref name=geh-151&gt;Harvey 1925: 151&lt;/ref&gt;
* The total area of the core states (Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and Manipur), using modern borders, and not counting Siamese dependencies in Cambodia or Lan Xang dependencies in Vietnam and Cambodia, is 1.45 million km². Subtracting half of Arakan yields 1.43 million km².&lt;ref group=note&gt;The sum of Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and Manipur is 1,448,825 km², where Myanmar=676,578 km²; Thailand=513,120; Laos=236m800; Manipur=22,327. Subtracting half the modern Rakhine State (36,778) yields the total of 1,430,436.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adding southern cis-Mekong prefectures of Yunnan ([[Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture|Nujiang]], [[Baoshan, Yunnan|Baoshan]], [[Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture|Dehong]], [[Lincang]], [[Ning'er Hani and Yi Autonomous County|Pu'er]] and [[Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture|Xishuangbanna]]) gives 1.56 million km².&lt;ref group=note&gt;Modern borders of southern Yunnan adds up to 131,931 km²: Nujiang=14,703 km²; Baoshan=19,064; Dehong=11,171; Lincang=23,621; Pu'er=44,265; Xishuangbanna=19,107.&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholarship assigns only about half of cis-Mekong regions to Toungoo Burma,&lt;ref group=note&gt;See (Harvey 1925: 151) for his estimate of the border of Chinese Shan states in Yunnan.&lt;/ref&gt; which gets the total size to about 1.5 million km².
* Adding Siamese dependencies in modern western Cambodia and those of Manipur in modern northeast India pushes the total towards 1.6 million km².&lt;ref group=note&gt;The total size of western Cambodian province totals to 49,359 km²: Battambang=11,702 km²; Pailin=803; Banteay Meanchey=6679; Oddar Meanchey=6158; Preah Vihear=13,788; Siem Reap=10,229. See (Harvey 1925: 151) for his estimate of Manipur's 16th-century borders.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal and commercial standardisations===
In Bayinnaung's reign, the king introduced a measure of legal uniformity by summoning learned monks and officials from all over dominions to prescribe an official collection of law books. The scholars compiled ''Dhammathat Kyaw'' and ''Kosaungchok'', based on King [[Wareru]]'s ''[[dhammathat]]''. The decisions given in his court were collected in ''Hanthawaddy Hsinbyumyashin Hpyat-hton''.&lt;ref name=geh-171/&gt; According to Huxley, the 16th-century Burmese legalism was "quite different from those of its neighbors in East and South Asia", and some aspects "are reminiscent of Western European approaches to law and kingship."&lt;ref name=ah-230&gt;Huxley 2012: 230&lt;/ref&gt; Bayinnaung promoted the new law throughout the empire so far as it was compatible with customs and practices of local society.&lt;ref name=mha-117-118/&gt; The adoption of Burmese customary law and the [[Burmese calendar]] in Siam began in his reign.&lt;ref name=mha-127&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 127&lt;/ref&gt; He also standardised the weights and measurements such as the cubit, tical, basket throughout the realm.&lt;ref name=chsea-72-73/&gt;&lt;ref name=geh-171/&gt;

===Military===
{{Main|Military history of Toungoo Dynasty}}
{{Campaignbox Wars of Toungoo Dynasty}}
[[File:RBA mobilization, Toungoo Empire.png|thumb|300px|[[Royal Burmese Army]] mobilisation (1530–99)]]
The First Toungoo Dynasty was "the most adventurous and militarily successful in the country’s history."&lt;ref name=atat-137-138/&gt; It founded the largest empire in Southeast Asia on the back of “breathtaking” military conquests. The success has been attributed to a "more martial culture" of Toungoo, incorporation of Portuguese firearms and foreign mercenaries, and larger forces.&lt;ref name=vbl-151-152/&gt; But even at its peak, the vaunted Toungoo military had trouble dealing with guerrilla warfare, and faced severe logistic issues in suppressing rebellions in remote hill states.

====Organisation====
The Toungoo military organisation drew on its Upper Burma precedent. The military was organised into a small standing army of a few thousand, which defended the capital and the palace, and a much larger conscript-based wartime army. The wartime army consisted of infantry, cavalry, elephantry, artillery and naval units. The navy was mainly river-borne, and used mostly for transportation of troops and cargo. Conscription was based on the ''ahmudan'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|အမှုထမ်း}}, "crown service") system, which required local chiefs to supply their predetermined quota of men from their jurisdiction on the basis of population in times of war.&lt;ref name=vbl-154-156&gt;Lieberman 2003: 154–156&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ahmudan'' were a class of people, who were exempt from most personal taxes in exchange for regular or military service of the crown. The quotas were fixed until the 17th century, when Restored Toungoo kings instituted variable quotas to take advantage of demographic fluctuations.&lt;ref name=vbl-185&gt;Lieberman 2003: 185&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest extant record of organisation of the [[Royal Burmese Army]] dates only from 1605 but the organizational structure of the earlier First Toungoo era is likely to be similar, if not essentially the same. A 1605 royal order decreed that each regiment shall consist of 1000 foot soldiers under 100 company leaders called ''akyat'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|အကြပ်}}), 10 battalion commanders called ''ahsaw'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|အဆော်}}) and 1 commander called ''ake'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|အကဲ}}), and all must be equipped with weapons including guns and cannon. A typical 17th-century regiment was armed with 10 cannon, 100 guns and 300 bows.&lt;ref name=wod-35-37&gt;Dijk 2006: 35–37&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to raise more conscripts depended greatly on the High King's grip over his vassals. Bayinnaung required newly conquered states to provide their quota of manpower for the next campaign. According to scholarship, at the peak of the empire, the imperial army could perhaps raise about 100,000 troops,&lt;ref name=geh-164&gt;Harvey 1925: 164&lt;/ref&gt; and the largest initial troop level for a single campaign was about 70,000.&lt;ref name=geh-334&gt;Harvey 1925: 334&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Chronicles claim over 500,000 troops for a single campaign. But (Harvey 1925: 333–336) rejects the claim, saying that Bayinnaung at most could have raised 300,000 men, based on the size of the population but such "so high a figure is improbable: he had no transport, and could not have fed them." (Lieberman 1984: 98) concurs: "Military mobilizations were probably more of a boast than a realistic estimate. Modern industrial states have difficulty placing 10% of their people under arms."&lt;/ref&gt; A major weakness of the system was that the vast majority of the potential levy hailed from outside the capital region. In 1581, only 21% of residents within a 200-km radius of Pegu were ''ahmudans'' (whereas in 1650 in the Restored Toungoo period, over 40% of the ''ahmudans'' were within 200&amp;nbsp;km of the capital Ava).&lt;ref name=vbl-163&gt;Lieberman 2003: 163&lt;/ref&gt; It meant that the High King of the First Toungoo period needed to rely far more on his vassal rulers to raise the troops. The weakness was brutally exposed when the High King was not Bayinnaung. Nanda's troops most probably never totalled more than 25,000.&lt;ref name=geh-334/&gt;

====Firearms====
One crucial factor in Toungoo's success was the army's early adoption of Portuguese firearms (arquebus [[matchlock]]s and cast-metal [[muzzleloader]] [[cannon]]), and formation of musket and artillery units. Portuguese weaponry proved superior in accuracy, safety, ballistic weight, and rapidity of fire than Asian-made counterparts.&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-28-29&gt;Lieberman 1984: 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; The first special musket and artillery units, made up mostly of Portuguese and Indian Ocean (mostly Muslim) mercenaries, were formed in the late 1530s.&lt;ref name=vbl-151-152/&gt; The Burmese later learned to integrate matchlocks into both infantry and elephanteer units. In some late 16th-century campaigns, as high as 20–33 percent of the troops were equipped with muskets.&lt;ref name="wod-35-37"&gt;Dijk 2006: 35–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vbl-153&gt;Lieberman 2003: 153&lt;/ref&gt; But artillery units continued to be manned by foreign mercenaries throughout the 16th century. Toungoo artillery corps never acquired massive siege guns of Europe but they "used Portuguese cannon to good effect by mounting them on high mounds or towers, and then shooting down into besieged towns".&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-28-29/&gt; Portuguese firearms proved particularly effective against interior states like the Shan states. However, the advantage of firearms was neutralised against Siam, a prosperous coastal power with its own well-equipped military.&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-28-29/&gt;&lt;ref name=vbl-153/&gt;

====Martial culture====
[[File:Pyinoolwin -- DSA Bayinnaung.JPG|thumb|Statue of Bayinnaung in front of the [[Defence Services Academy|DSA]]]]
Another key factor was Toungoo's "more martial culture" and "more aggressive leadership".&lt;ref name=vbl-274&gt;Lieberman 2003: 274&lt;/ref&gt; Toungoo was a product of Upper Burma's ceaseless wars of the prior centuries. In the age of rampant gubernatorial revolts, any rulers hoping to rule a kingdom needed to take command of the army. All senior princes of the House of Toungoo received a military style education since childhood, and were expected to take the field in person.&lt;ref name=sll-109&gt;Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 109&lt;/ref&gt; Several Toungoo leaders of the era, including Tabinshwehti, Bayinnaung, Nanda, [[Thado Minsaw of Ava|Thado Minsaw]], [[Minye Thihathu II of Toungoo|Minye Thihathu]], [[Thado Dhamma Yaza III of Prome|Thado Dhamma Yaza III]] and [[Natshinnaung]], first took the field in their teenage years. This kind of martial tradition simply did not exist in "far larger, more secure" kingdoms like Siam.&lt;ref name=vbl-274/&gt; (Indeed, the same kind of complacency afflicted later Restored Toungoo kings, who from 1650 onwards stopped taking the field as the country became largely stable.) Their more martial culture and battlefield successes gave the Toungoo command an increasingly greater field experience, which their rival commands in the region simply could not match. According to [[Victor Lieberman|Lieberman]], this was a key factor that enabled a western mainland polity "to conquer the central mainland rather than vice versa".&lt;ref name=vbl-274/&gt;

====Limits of military power====
Even at the peak of its might, the Toungoo military had the most difficult time controlling remote hill states. They never solved the sheer logistical issues of transporting and feeding large numbers of troops for sustained periods of time. Bayinnaung's persistence in sending troops year after year cost an untold number of lives, which at one point caused his senior advisers to murmur loudly.&lt;ref name=app-116&gt;Phayre 1967: 116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=geh-177/&gt; The conqueror king was fortunate that a charismatic guerrilla leader like King [[Setthathirath]] of Lan Xang (r. 1548–72) was assassinated by a local rival. After Bayinnaung, Lower Burma lost the manpower advantage over a far more populous Siam. Ayutthaya's larger, well-equipped armies not only repulsed Nanda's undermanned invasions but also ended up seizing the Tenasserim coast in the process.

====Legacy====
The First Toungoo dynasty's military organisation and strategy were adapted by its two main successor states: Restored Toungoo and Siam. Restored Toungoo kings used the First Toungoo's formula of greater military experience, modern firearms and (comparatively greater) manpower to partially restore the empire in the following two decades. Likewise, Siam's military service system, ''phrai luang'', was reorganised, modelled after the ''ahmudan'' system in the 1570s—indeed to fulfill Bayinnaung's demands for conscripts. Likewise, the First Toungoo dynasty's military strategy and tactics were likely adopted by Siam's new generation of leadership, [[Naresuan]] and [[Ekathotsarot]], who grew up in Pegu, and were most probably exposed to Toungoo military strategy. By 1600, Siam had not only regained the Tenasserim coast from Burma but also expanded deeper into Cambodia.&lt;ref name=vbl-275-276/&gt; After 1614, an equilibrium of sorts prevailed between the two successor states. Neither state extended in any direction to a point her supply lines were more extended than those of her nearest rival.&lt;ref name=vbl-161/&gt;

==Culture and society==

===Demography===

====Size of population====
Estimates&lt;ref group=note&gt;(Lieberman 1984: 18): No large-scale censuses of any kind were conducted. Extant censuses from the period cover just four corridors of settlement in Lower Burma: Bassein-Myaungmya in the western delta; Martaban-Moulmein littoral; Myan Aung to Danubyu in the eastern delta; Pegu-Syriam-Dagon—capital region. (Lieberman 1984: 21–22): In 1581, a regional census of the 16 leading townships of Lower Burma showed a combined population of less than 28,000 households (~200,000 people). (Lieberman 1984: 20): The first-ever Irrawaddy valley-wide census was conducted only in 1638, and the results did not survive.&lt;/ref&gt; of the population of the empire point to over 6 million. In 1600, the most populous region of the erstwhile empire was Siam (2.5 million),&lt;ref name=vbl-295&gt;Lieberman 2003: 295&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Upper Burma (1.5 million),&lt;ref name=vbl-52-175&gt;Lieberman 2003: 52, 175&lt;/ref&gt; the Shan high lands (1 million)&lt;ref name=vbl-175&gt;Lieberman 2003: 175&lt;/ref&gt; and Lower Burma (0.5 million)&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-21&gt;Lieberman 1984: 21&lt;/ref&gt;—for a total of at least 5.5 million. Estimates for Lan Na, Lan Xang and Manipur are not known. The size of the population of the empire before the devastating wars of 1584–99 was probably over 6 million. The population of the Pegu capital region, according to a 1581 census, was only about 200,000.&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-21/&gt;

The low population spread across a comparatively large region meant that the rulers prized manpower more than land. Winners of wars never failed to deport the local population to their capital region where they can be controlled closer. The deportations also deprived the defeated regions of valuable manpower with which to revolt.

====Ethnic groups====
The First Toungoo Empire was a multi-ethnic society although the concept of ethnicity was still highly fluid, heavily influenced by language, culture, class, locale, and political power. Still, by the 16th century, broad “politicized” ethnic patterns had emerged. In the western mainland, four main politico-ethnic groups had emerged—Mons in the region south of 18:30N, known in contemporary writings as ''Talaing-Pyay'' or ''Ramanya-Detha'' (“land of the Mons”); Burmans in the region north of 18.30N called ''Myanma-Pyay'' (“land of the Burmans”); Shans in the hill regions called ''Shan Pyay'' (“land of the Shans”); and Rakhines in the western coastal region called ''Rakhine Pyay'' (“land of the Rakhines”).&lt;ref name=vbl-132&gt;Lieberman 2003: 132&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the central mainland, nascent politico-ethnic identities of Tai Yuans in Lan Na; Laotians in Lan Xang, and the Siamese in Siam had emerged.&lt;ref name=vbl-267-268-271&gt;Lieberman 2003: 267–268, 271&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the main politico-ethnicities were several smaller ethnic minority groups. In predominantly Mon-speaking Lower Burma, a sizeable number of Burmans, Karens, and Shans (as well as a host of Europeans, Jews, Armenians, Persians, etc. at key ports) came to settle in this period.&lt;ref name=atat-131&gt;Aung-Thwin and Aung-Thwin 2012: 131&lt;/ref&gt; Several deportees from the conquered states as far away as Lan Xang were settled in Lower Burma. In Upper Burma, Shans, Kadus, Karens, Chins and other minorities still occupied dry zone fringes.&lt;ref name=vbl-134&gt;Lieberman 2003: 134&lt;/ref&gt; The Shan states had Chins, Kachins, Was, Palaungs, Karennis, etc. Over in the central mainland, several linguistically distinct Tai groups coexisted alongside sizeable numbers of Mons, Khmers, and a host of hill minorities.&lt;ref name=vbl-267-273&gt;Lieberman 2003: 267, 273&lt;/ref&gt; The [[entrepôt]] of Ayutthaya hosted significant communities of Bengalis, Arabs and Persians.&lt;ref name=vbl-254&gt;Lieberman 2003: 254&lt;/ref&gt;

To be sure, the ethnic definitions were loose categorisations. Overarching politico-ethnic identities were still in their early stages of development. In the western mainland, even the so-called major ethnic groups—such as Burmans, Mons, Shans—were themselves divided into rival centres, with distinctive local traditions and in many cases different dialects.&lt;ref name=vbl-134-135&gt;Lieberman 2003: 134–135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-17&gt;Lieberman 1984: 17&lt;/ref&gt; The same was true for smaller minorities still—indeed, terms like Kachins, Karens, and Chins are exonyms given by Burmans that summarily group several different groups. In the central mainland, the main Siamese, Lao and Yuan ethnicities were still in an embryonic stage, and a chiefly elite concept.&lt;ref name=vbl-267-273/&gt; In Siam, the Siamese language and ethnicity were the “preserve” of the aristocracy called the ''munnai'', and most commoners in Ayutthaya, according to an early 16th-century Portuguese observer, still spoke Mon dialects rather than still emerging Siamese, and cut their hair like the Mons of Pegu.&lt;ref name=vbl-273&gt;Lieberman 2003: 273&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effects of fluid ethnic identities====
Weak or embryonic ethnic identities had broad geopolitical implications. One key result was that patron-client structures often preempted ethnic identity, giving rise to frequent political alliances across ethnic lines.&lt;ref name=atat-132-133&gt;Aung-Thwin and Aung-Thwin 2012: 132-133&lt;/ref&gt; The same phenomenon was also prevalent in states as diverse as Vietnam, Russia and France during this period. Not surprisingly, all armies and courts of the era consisted of significant minority ethnicities. Frequent cross-ethnic defections "bore no particular stigma." States large and small readily shifted alliances with little regard to ethnic loyalties.&lt;ref name=vbl-135&gt;Lieberman 2003: 135&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not to say that neither wars nor population movements had little effect. In the Irrawaddy valley, for example, north-to-south migrations "pitted newcomers against established populations and encouraged stereotyping both as an emotional response to an alien presence and as a (perhaps unconscious) strategy of group mobilization. Shan raids on Upper Burma, which bred bitter anti-Shan diatribes, offer the most dramatic example."&lt;ref name=vbl-133&gt;Lieberman 2003: 133&lt;/ref&gt; But the weak link between ethnicity and political loyalty meant patron-client relationships remained the single most important factor in state building. One figure who successfully exploited this at the grandest scale was Bayinnaung. The emperor formed patron-client relationships based on universal Buddhist cultural concepts—alongside the threat of massive military reprisals—to hold the empire. He presented himself as ''[[Chakravartin|cakkavatti]]'', or World Ruler, par excellence,&lt;ref name=vbl-154&gt;Lieberman 2003: 154&lt;/ref&gt; and formed personal relationships based on the concepts of ''thissa'' (allegiance) and ''kyezu'' (obligation).&lt;ref name=tk-115-116&gt;Thaw Kaung 2010: 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of cross-ethnic patron-client relationships continued to thrive, albeit at smaller scales, in mainland Southeast Asia down to the 19th century.

====Social classes====
The First Toungoo society in the Irrawaddy valley followed Pagan and Ava precedents.&lt;ref name=vbl-153/&gt; At the top of the pyramid were the immediate royal family, followed by the upper officialdom made up of extended royal family members. Royalty and officials— known collectively as “rulers” or ''min''—were "divided into numerous sub-grades, each with its own sumptuary insignia".&lt;ref name=vbl-194&gt;Lieberman 2003: 194&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the people belonged to one of four broad group of commoners (''hsin-ye-tha,'' lit. “people of poverty”).&lt;ref name=vbl-113&gt;Lieberman 2003: 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=at-1985-71-73&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 71–73&lt;/ref&gt;

| ''ahmudan''
| Royal servicemen who received land grants from the crown, and were exempt from most personal taxes in exchange for regular military service. They were called ''kyundaw'' in the Pagan period. Their authority crosscut the territorial jurisdictions of local governors and headmen. They provided the crown with labour on a fixed or rotational basis. Besides military service, ''ahmudans'' also supplied the palace with a “variety of specialized services ranging from bird-shooing to perfume-making to the painting of magical signs.”&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-97-98&gt;Lieberman 1984: 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 16th century, the ''ahmudan'' system broke down as people fled to avoid military service. Early Restored Toungoo kings had to rebuild the ''ahmudan'' system from ground up by deporting large number of prisoners to lowland areas, close to the capital.&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-97-98/&gt;

|-

A similar system was in place in Siam.

|}

In both sectors of the empire, the society was deeply stratified: the division between the elite and the commoners was stark. In the Irrawaddy valley, ''min'' males on balance were more likely to study for long periods in monasteries, to be knowledgeable in Pali, even Sanskrit; to wear Indian and Chinese textiles, to be familiar with foreign conventions than their ''hsin-ye-tha'' counterparts.&lt;ref name=vbl-194/&gt; In the Chao Phraya valley, the ''munnai'' like the aristocrats in Lan Xang and Lan Na "were a kind of a caste." Marriage between capital and provincial ''munnai'' was possible but between social classes was "out of the question." What subsequently became known as Siamese language, culture and ethnicity were their more or less exclusive preserve.&lt;ref name=vbl-273/&gt;

===Literacy and literature===
Literacy throughout the empire remained essentially the preserve of the aristocrats and the monks. In the Irrawaddy valley, the system of near-universal village monasteries and male education characteristic of later centuries was not fully yet developed. Unlike in later periods, monks continued to staff the modest royal secretariats of the regional courts, and most of the Burmese (and certainly Pali) literature of the era were produced by the aristocrats and the clergy.&lt;ref name=vbl-136&gt;Lieberman 2003: 136&lt;/ref&gt; Because scribal talent remained rare, the cost of [[Tripiṭaka|Tipitika]] transcriptions as late as 1509 may not have been much lower than in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=vbl-136/&gt;

Burmese orthography continued to follow the antique square format developed for aristocratic stone inscriptions, rather than the cursive format that took hold from the 17th century, when popular writings led to wider use of palm leaves and folded papers known as ''[[parabaik]]s''.&lt;ref name=vbl-136/&gt; The Burmese language and script continued to affect other languages and scripts in the Irrawaddy valley. Since the 15th century, Mon inscriptions had adopted Burmese orthographic conventions and to incorporate, consciously or not, large numbers of Burmese loan words.&lt;ref name=vbl-133/&gt; Various Tai-Shan scripts were developed based on the Burmese script.&lt;ref name=sat-27&gt;Aung Tun 2009: 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Low literacy rates notwithstanding, this period saw the continued growth of Burmese literature both in terms of quantity and genres—a trend that began in the Ava period (1364–1555). Chiefly through the efforts of monks and aristocrats, a new generation of chronicles, law codes, and poetry were written in vernacular Burmese, or in addition to Pali.&lt;ref name=vbl-131-134&gt;Lieberman 2003: 131, 134&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the chronicles such as ''[[Razadarit Ayedawbon]]'' and ''[[Hanthawaddy Hsinbyushin Ayedawbon]]'' have survived to this day. A new form of poetry, called ''[[yadu (poetry)|yadu]]'', first pioneered in the Ava period, flourished. Indeed, some of the most well-known ''yadu'' poets such as Shin Htwe Hla, Yaza Thara, Nawaday, [[Hsinbyushin Medaw]], and [[Natshinnaung]] hailed from this period.&lt;ref name=geh-170-171&gt;Harvey 1925: 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Chao Phraya valley, literacy in Siamese, not to mention Pali, were strictly the domain of the elite. Monastic education for the commoners (''phrai'') remained "quite a luxury.".&lt;ref name=vbl-274/&gt; In Lan Xang and Lan Na too, the literacy in Lao and Lan Na scripts was the preserve of the aristocrats.&lt;ref name=vbl-266-269&gt;Lieberman 2003: 266, 269&lt;/ref&gt; The Siamese language (central Thai), a mixture of a more northerly Tai dialect with Khmerized Tai from the Ayutthaya area, was coalescing. The Siamese script too underwent several modifications before achieving its final form by about 1600.&lt;ref name=vbl-275/&gt;

===Religion===

====Buddhist reforms====
[[Image:PhuKhaoThong.jpg|thumb|Wat Phu Khao Thong just outside [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]] donated by Bayinnaung]]
An enduring legacy of the First Toungoo Dynasty was the introduction of a more orthodox version of [[Theravada Buddhism]] (Mahavihara school of Ceylon) to Upper Burma and the Shan States.&lt;ref name=vbl-151-152/&gt; The Toungoo reforms were modelled after those instituted by King [[Dhammazedi]] of [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom|Hanthawaddy]] (r. 1471–92).&lt;ref name=geh-172-173&gt;Harvey 1925: 172–173&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of religious practices in western and central mainland Southeast Asia before the rise of the empire was highly fragmented. In general, the lowland areas were largely—nominally—Theravada Buddhist, and highland regions were a mix of Theravada Buddhist and animist to strictly animist.&lt;ref name=vbl-135/&gt; Pre-Buddhist rituals remained part and parcel of accepted religious practices throughout the mainland. For example, on the Shan highlands, as late as 1557, Shan ''sawbwas''' favourite servants and animals were customarily killed and buried with him.&lt;ref name=vbl-135-136&gt;Lieberman 2003: 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; Even in predominantly Buddhist lowland Upper Burma, down to the 16th century, animal sacrifices were still regularly performed and distilled liquored was consumed in Buddhist-sanctioned events (often attended by Buddhist abbots and the royalty).&lt;ref group=note&gt;(Lieberman 2003: 135–136): The soldiers of King [[Mohnyin Thado]] (r. 1426–39) celebrated their king’s access by sacrificing horses and cattle to the Mahagiri spirt. Still in Upper Burma, down to the 16th century, forest dweller monks presided over land-transfer rituals in which distilled liquor (''ayek'') was consumed, and cattle, pigs, and fowls were slaughtered. Princes and even Buddhist abbots attended these ceremonies.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in Lower Burma, where Theravada Buddhist practices had become more orthodox since the 1480s, "monastic practices were deficient by later standards, and spirit propitiation was a dominant local concern."&lt;ref name=vbl-135-136/&gt;

Bayinnaung brought Dhammazedi's Sinhalese-style orthodox reforms to lands throughout his domain. Viewing himself as the "model Buddhist king," the king distributed copies of the scriptures, fed monks, and built pagodas at every new conquered state from Upper Burma and Shan states to Lan Na and Siam. Some of the pagodas are still to be seen, and in later ages the Burmese would point to them as proof of their claim to rule those countries still.&lt;ref name=geh-172-173/&gt; Following in the footsteps of Dhammazedi, he supervised mass ordinations at the ''Kalyani Thein'' at Pegu in his orthodox Theravada Buddhism in the name of purifying the religion.&lt;ref name=geh-172-173/&gt; He prohibited all human and animal sacrifices throughout the kingdom. The ban also extended to the foreign settlers’ animal sacrifices such as the [[Eid al-Adha]].&lt;ref name=geh-166-167&gt;Harvey 1925: 166–167&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Bayinnaung's reforms were continued by his successors of the Restored Toungoo Dynasty. The Forest dweller sect virtually disappeared.&lt;ref name=vbl-159&gt;Lieberman 2003: 159&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, Theravada practices became more regionally uniform, the hill regions were drawn into closer contact with the basin in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name=vbl-191-192&gt;Lieberman 2003: 191–192&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other practices====
Various animist practices remained alive and well, not just hill regions but even in the lowlands. Bayinnaung's attempts to rid of animist ''[[nat (spirit)|nat]]'' worship from Buddhism failed.&lt;ref name=mha-117-118/&gt; Adherents of [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic faiths]] also came to settle. The foreign merchants and mercenaries brought their Islam and Roman Catholicism. In the 1550s, the Muslim merchants at Pegu erected what appears to have been their first mosque.&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-28&gt;Lieberman 1984: 28&lt;/ref&gt; The descendants of Muslim and Catholic mercenaries continued to fill the ranks of the army's elite artillery units.&lt;ref name=vbl-166&gt;Lieberman 2003: 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Agriculture, and maritime trade dominated the economy of the empire. Maritime trade was most prevalent in Lower Burma and southern Siam. Agriculture was dominant in Upper Burma and surrounding highlands. The Ayutthaya region also had a strong agriculture-based economy.

===Agriculture===
In the western mainland, the three principal irrigated regions were all located in Upper Burma: [[Kyaukse]], [[Minbu]] and [[Mu river|Mu valley]]—as had been the case since the 13th century. Lower Burma's agriculture was not well developed—less than 10% of the acreage of the mid-1930s in the [[British rule in Burma|British colonial period]] was under cultivation in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-18-19&gt;Lieberman 1984: 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; Upper Burma had about 730,000 hectares (1.8 million acres) under cultivation c. 1600, divided even between rice and dry crops.&lt;ref name=vbl-174&gt;Lieberman 2003: 174&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to rice, New World peanuts, tobacco and maize were grown. Cotton became the major crop in dry zone areas ill-suited for rice, as in Meiktila, Yamethin and Myingyan districts. Cotton was Burma's principal export commodity to China, and drove domestic handicraft industry.&lt;ref name=vbl-175/&gt;

===Trade===
The coastal region instead relied heavily on trade. The main ports were Pegu, Martaban, Tavoy, and Mergui. Products and goods from the interior—rice, and other food stuffs, as well as a variety of luxury goods (rubies, sapphires, musk, lac, benzoin, gold)—were exported to [[Malacca]], [[Sumatra]], the [[Coromandel Coast]] (Portuguese [[Pulicat]], [[Machilipatnam|Masulipatam]]), [[Bengal]] and [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-27-28&gt;Lieberman 1984: 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; In return, Pegu imported Chinese manufactures and spices from Malacca and Sumatra, and Indian textiles from the Indian states; and indeed highly sought after state-of-the-art firearms from the Portuguese.&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-27-28/&gt;&lt;ref name=vbl-168&gt;Lieberman 2003: 168&lt;/ref&gt;

The crown closely supervised trade, and collected duties on any trade that touched the coasts of Lower Burma and Siam. At Pegu, overseas trade was in the hands of eight brokers appointed by the king. Their fee was two percent.&lt;ref name=geh-175&gt;Harvey 1925: 175&lt;/ref&gt; The crown appointed officials at Mergui, a former Siamese dependency, to supervise lucrative trade between Siam and India.&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-31-32&gt;Lieberman 1984: 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; His majesty's government was actively involved in the import-export business. The crown exported luxury products (musk, gold, gems) obtained through the tribute quotas from the interior states. Bayinnaung built a fleet of oceangoing vessels in the 1570s to undertake voyages on behalf of the crown.&lt;ref name=chsea-72-73/&gt;&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-31-32/&gt;

Overland trade was principally with China. Burma's principal export to China was cotton. Based on Sun Laichen's analysis of Chinese sources, exports to Yunnan of Burmese raw cotton by c. 1600 had reached 1000 [[tonne]]s annually. Burma also exported finished Indian (and possibly Burmese) textiles as well as spices, gems, and salt to Yunnan. These goods were moved by boat to the upper Irrawaddy, where they were transferred to north-bound trains of oxen and ponies. In the opposite direction flowed Chinese iron and copper vessels, weapons, tea, and silk as well as copper and silver from Yunnanese mines.&lt;ref name=vbl-145&gt;Lieberman 2003: 145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Currency===
The Toungoo empire had no official [[coin]]age. According to European company records, non-barter trade was chiefly conducted in lumps of copper-lead alloys called ''ganza'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|ဂင်ဇာ}}, {{IPA-my|gɪ̀ɴzà|}}) to the 1560s. But New World silver began arriving via the Spanish Philippines and India in the last centuries of the 16th century, and silver gradually overtook ''ganza'', and became the standard medium of exchange by the early 17th century. The greater availability of silver greatly aided commercial expansion throughout the empire.&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-121-122&gt;Lieberman 1984: 121–122&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conditions===
Maritime trade wealth sustained Pegu's military might, enabling Pegu to pay for Portuguese firearms and mercenaries.&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-27-28/&gt; Contemporary European travellers reported immense wealth of Pegu during Bayinnaung's reign.&lt;ref name=geh-175/&gt; By the 1570s, Pegu's “wealth and power were now unequaled”, and regarded by the Portuguese as “the powerfullest Monarchy in Asia, except that of China”.&lt;ref name=chsea-72-73/&gt;&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-31-32/&gt; The prosperous life at the capital, however, was probably not replicated at the countryside. Annual mobilisations of men greatly reduced the manpower necessary to cultivate the rice fields. Even during at the peak of the empire, harvests at times fell perilously low, causing severe rice shortages such as in 1567.&lt;ref name=geh-177&gt;Harvey 1925: 177&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1590s, constant warfare left Lower Burma severely depopulated and rice prices at unheard of levels.&lt;ref name=geh-180/&gt;&lt;ref name=vbl-156/&gt;

==Legacy==
The First Toungoo Empire left no monumental architecture as the Pagan Empire did. The grandeur of Pegu was forever lost, and is known only from contemporary European accounts. Unlike the Ava period, few literary innovations came out. Its main legacies were political and cultural consolidations in both western and central mainland Southeast Asia.

The empire marked the end of the period of petty kingdoms in mainland Southeast Asia. Not only did the dynasty successfully reunify the Irrawaddy valley for the first time since the late 13th century but it also absorbed the surrounding highlands into the lowland orbit for good. Toungoo came of age in a period when the arrival of European firearms and an increase in Indian Ocean commerce enabled lowland polities to project power into interior states.&lt;ref name=vbl-1984-13/&gt; The advantages of the lowland states persisted even after the monumental collapse of the empire. Of the successor states, Restored Toungoo and Siam were the two winners that emerged to dominate the western and central mainland Southeast Asia, respectively, although Ayutthaya's sway in the central mainland was less complete than Restored Toungoo's near complete domination of the western mainland. (Whereas only Arakan escaped Restored Toungoo's restoration, Lan Xang and Cambodia remained independent, albeit greatly weakened, out of Siam's grasp till the 19th century. On the other hand, Lan Na's loss of independence was permanent: after 1558, she remained a Burmese province for the better part of two centuries whereupon Lan Na entered the Siamese empire.) Still, the accelerated thrusts towards regional hegemony were comparable in both sectors.&lt;ref name=vbl-275-276&gt;Lieberman 2003: 275–276&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key legacy was the 17th-century administrative reforms that addressed the empire's numerous shortcomings. In both Restored Toungoo Burma and Siam, monarchs worked to reduce the power of viceroys and governors. Similarities between Burmese and Siamese reforms “reflected, in part, independent responses to similar challenges” but they also suggest “a degree of squint-eyed mutual borrowing.” In both sectors, the crown reduced or stopped the appointment of senior princes to provincial towns, and obliged them to reside at the capital in special palaces where they could more easily be monitored. The actual administrators of the provinces went to commoner officials with no claims to the throne.&lt;ref name=vbl-275-276/&gt;

As a result of political and economic integration, the cultural norms in the Irrawaddy valley continued to synthesize in the 17th century. More orthodox practices of Theravada Buddhism of Hanthawaddy and Ceylon spread to the upcountry and the Shan states. The Burmese language and customs pushed outward of Upper Burma in all directions in the following centuries.&lt;ref name=vbl-188-192&gt;Lieberman 2003: 188–192&lt;/ref&gt;

The memories of the First Toungoo Empire still loom large not just in Myanmar but also in Thailand and Laos. In Myanmar, Tabinshwehti's and Bayinnaung's exploits are widely recounted in schoolbooks. According to [[Thant Myint-U|Myint-U]], Bayinnaung is the favourite king of the present-day Burmese generals, who often see themselves "as fighting the same enemies and in the same places... their soldiers slugging their way through the same thick jungle, preparing to torch a town or press-gang villagers. The past closer, more comparable, a way to justify present action. His statues are there because the ordeal of welding a nation together by force is not just history."&lt;ref name=tmu-71&gt;Myint-U 2006: 71&lt;/ref&gt; On the opposite side of the same token, warrior kings Naresuan of Ayutthaya and Setthathirath of Lan Xang remain the most celebrated kings in Thailand and Laos respectively—Naresuan for returning Siam to independence and Setthathirath for his pesky resistance to the empire.

[[Image:Kathoey.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|[[Kathoey]] working in a go-go bar in [[Bangkok]]'s [[Nana Plaza]] entertainment neighborhood]]

The term '''go-go bar''' originally referred  to a nightclub, bar, or similar establishment that featured [[go-go dancer]]s; while some go-go bars in that original sense still exist, the link between its present uses and that original meaning is often more tenuous and regional. Speaking broadly, the term has been used by venues that cover a wide range of businesses, from [[nightclub]]s or [[discotheques]], where dancers are essentially there to set the [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], to what are in essence [[burlesque]] theaters or [[strip clubs]], where dancers are part of a show and the primary focus.

==United States==
The term '''go-go bar''' is often used for certain sorts of  [[strip club]]s. In regions where the term is used, go-go bars are considered lower in class when compared to [[Gentlemen's club (adult entertainment)|gentlemen's clubs]], which offer a more coordinated and show-centric experience. In these bars:

*There is no [[Champagne room|champagne court]].
*Dress codes are more lax for both patrons and performers.
*There are no staging, choreography, or special effects considerations.
*A House Mother monitors activity and assists performers in the dressing area.
*Feature performers usually do not perform at go-go bars.

==Southeast Asia==
In Southeast Asia, and particularly in Thailand and parts of the Philippines, Go Go bars can include a wide variety of indoor bars with dancers and/or hostesses; these typically do not offer striptease. These are most often venues for [[prostitution]], and the dancers are usually available to be [[bar fine]]d by customers. These are often, but not exclusively, found in [[List of red-light districts#Asia|red light districts]] catering to foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=van der Velden |first=Leo |year=1982 |title=Tussen prostituée en maitresse: de hospitality girls van Ermita, Manila |type= |chapter= |publisher=Universiteit van Amsterdam |docket= |oclc= |url=http://www.scriptiesonline.uba.uva.nl/en/scriptie/573463 |access-date=|language=nl|trans-title=Between Prostitute and Mistress: the Hospitality Girls of Ermita, Manila}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work|volume=Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SKBvqXL0jTQC|first=Melissa Hope|last=Ditmore|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn=9780313329692|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The origin of the term go-go dancing goes back to a 1949 British film ''[[Whisky Galore! (1949 film)|Whisky Galore!]]''. This film tells the story of the sinking of a ship loaded with whiskey. The French title of this film was ''Whisky à gogo !'', "à gogo" being Parisian slang for "galore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Modern Colloquial French|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-MaHAgAAQBAJ|first1=Edwin A|last1=Lovatt|first2=René James|last2=Hérail|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=9781134930623|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period that this film was showing in France, discotheques were just introduced as a new form of entertainment. Due to the success of the film and the snob appeal of drinking whiskey in France, a number of discotheques were given the name "Whiskey à Go-Go". 

The first ''Whisky à Gogo'' nightclub opened in Paris in 1947, drawing the "Whisky" part of its name from the whisky labels that lined its walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Girl Culture: An Encyclopedia [2 Volumes]: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9PRoPX3DIwgC|first1=Claudia|last1=Mitchell|first2=Jacqueline|last2=Reid-Walsh|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2007|isbn=9780313084447|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 it became the first [[discotheque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=DJs: A Children's Guide to the Origins of Hip Hop|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sptLAgAAQBAJ|first=Lamont|last=Clark|publisher=70 West Press|year=2013|series=The Five Elements of Hip Hop|volume=Volume 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was franchised, first in Chicago in 1958 and then in Los Angeles in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fashion Fads Through American History: Fitting Clothes into Context: Fitting Clothes into Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GDoVCwAAQBAJ|first=Jennifer Grayer|last=Moore|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2015|isbn=9781610699020|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1964 the Los Angeles club was featured in [[Life (magazine)|Life magazine]] and by 1965 clubs called ''Whisky à Go-Go'' (or ''Whiskey à Go-Go'') had appeared in Milwaukee, Washington, San Francisco and Atlanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How the Beatles Destroyed Rock 'n' Roll: An Alternative History of American Popular Music|first=Elijah|last=Wald|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYXYrAqAdv4C|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780199753567|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Los Angeles club a new style of dance was taking place, as go-go dancers in short, fringed skirts and high boots danced in a glass booth above the patrons. The first recorded occurrence of topless go-go dancing was in the Condor nightclub in San Francisco in 1964, and topless go-go dancing quickly became a part of the adult entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Sixties: A Decade of Culture and Counterculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JscEZeXBsZYC|editor-first1=Abbe Allen|editor-last1=DeBolt|editor-first2=James S.|editor-last2=Baugess|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2011|isbn=9780313329449|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also the time when dances became popular, where partners were dancing apart from each other. Not long after the success of the discotheques in France, they were opened in French style in New York City, with the same name as their French example: “Whiskey A Go-Go”. American discos introduced soon a form of entertainment of young girls dancing in the new, loose style, without a partner. The go-go dancer was born.&lt;ref&gt;A.O.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60473">[[Tracheal intubation]] (usually simply referred to as '''intubation'''), an [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|invasive medical procedure]], is the placement of a flexible plastic [[catheter]] into the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. For millennia, [[tracheotomy]] was considered the most reliable (and most risky) method of tracheal intubation. By the late 19th century, advances in the sciences of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]], as well as the beginnings of an appreciation of the [[germ theory of disease]], had reduced the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] of this operation to a more acceptable rate. Also in the late 19th century, advances in [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] instrumentation had improved to such a degree that direct [[laryngoscopy]] had finally become a viable means to secure the [[airway]] by the non-surgical orotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation was not widely practiced until the early 20th century. The 20th century saw the transformation of the practices of tracheotomy, endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation from rarely employed procedures to essential components of the practices of [[anesthesia]], [[Intensive-care medicine|critical care medicine]], [[emergency medicine]], [[gastroenterology]], [[pulmonology]] and [[surgery]].

==Tracheotomy==
{{See also|Tracheotomy}}
[[File:Tracheotomy1.jpg|thumb|This portrait, though undated, supports the view that tracheotomy was practiced in [[ancient history]]]]

The earliest known depiction of a tracheotomy is found on two [[Egypt]]ian [[Clay tablet|tablets]] dating back to circa 3600 BC.&lt;ref name=Pahor1992I/&gt; The 110-page [[Ebers Papyrus]], an [[Egyptian medical papyri|Egyptian medical papyrus]] that dates to around 1550 BC, also refers to the tracheotomy.&lt;ref name=Pahor1992I/&gt;&lt;ref name=Frost1976/&gt; Tracheotomy was described in an ancient Indian scripture, the [[Rigveda]]: the text mentions "the bountiful one who, without a ligature, can cause the windpipe to re-unite when the cervical cartilages are cut across, provided they are not entirely severed."&lt;ref name=Frost1976/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stock1987/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pahor1992/&gt; The [[Sushruta Samhita]] (circa 400 BC) is another text from the [[Indian subcontinent]] on ayurvedic medicine and surgery that mentions tracheotomy.&lt;ref name=Sushruta/&gt;

The [[Greeks|Greek]] physician [[Hippocrates]] (ca. 460–ca. 370 BC) condemned the practice of tracheotomy. Warning against the unacceptable risk of death from inadvertent laceration of the [[Common carotid artery|carotid artery]] during tracheotomy, Hippocrates also cautioned that "The most difficult [[fistula]]s are those that occur in the cartilaginous areas."&lt;ref name=Connell1951/&gt; [[Homerus of Byzantium]] is said to have written of [[Alexander the Great]] (356–323 BC) saving a soldier from [[asphyxia]]tion by making an incision with the tip of his sword in the man's trachea.&lt;ref name=Szmuk2008/&gt;

Despite the concerns of Hippocrates, [[Galen]] of [[Pergamon]] (129–199) and [[Aretaeus]] of [[Cappadocia]] (both of whom lived in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] in the 2nd century AD) credit [[Asclepiades of Bithynia]] (ca. 124–40 BC) as being the first physician to perform a non-emergency tracheotomy.&lt;ref name=Gumpert1794/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yapijakis2009/&gt; However, Aretaeus warned against the performance of tracheotomy because he believed that incisions made into the tracheal [[cartilage]] were prone to secondary [[wound infection]]s and therefore would not heal. He wrote that "The lips of the wound do not coalesce, for they are both cartilaginous and not of a nature to unite".&lt;ref name=Goodall1934/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grillo2003/&gt; [[Antyllus]], another Greek surgeon who lived in Rome in the 2nd century AD, was reported to have performed tracheotomy when treating oral diseases. He refined the technique to be more similar to that used in modern times, recommending that a [[Transverse plane|transverse]] incision be made between the third and fourth tracheal rings for the treatment of life-threatening airway obstruction.&lt;ref name=Goodall1934/&gt; Antyllus wrote that tracheotomy was not effective however in cases of severe [[Croup|laryngotracheobronchitis]] because the [[pathology]] was distal to the operative site. Antyllus' original writings were lost, but they were preserved by [[Oribasius]] (ca. 320–400) and [[Paul of Aegina]] (ca. 625–690), both of whom were Greek physicians as well as historians.&lt;ref name=Goodall1934/&gt; Galen clarified the anatomy of the trachea and was the first to demonstrate that the larynx generates the voice.&lt;ref name=Galen1956-oxford/&gt;&lt;ref name=Galen1956-rsm/&gt; Galen may have understood the importance of artificial ventilation, because in one of his experiments he used bellows to inflate the lungs of a dead animal.&lt;ref name=Galen1528/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker1971/&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], scientific discoveries were few and far between in much of Europe. However, the scientific culture flourished in other parts of the world. In 1000, [[Albucasis|Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]] (936-1013), an Arab who lived in [[Al-Andalus]], published the 30-volume ''[[Al-Tasrif|Kitab al-Tasrif]]'', the first illustrated work on surgery. He never performed a tracheotomy, but he did treat a slave girl who had cut her own throat in a suicide attempt. Al-Zahrawi (known to Europeans as ''Albucasis'') sewed up the wound and the girl recovered, thereby proving that an incision in the larynx could heal. Circa 1020, [[Avicenna|Ibn Sīnā]] (980–1037) described the use of tracheal intubation in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' to facilitate [[breathing]].&lt;ref name=Skinner2008/&gt; In the 12th century medical textbook ''Al-Taisir'', [[Ibn Zuhr]] (1091–1161) of Al-Andalus (also known as Avenzoar) provided an anatomically correct description of the tracheotomy operation.&lt;ref name=Abdel2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shehata/&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] saw significant advances in anatomy and surgery, and surgeons became increasingly open to surgery on the trachea. Despite this, the mortality rate failed to improve.&lt;ref name=Goodall1934/&gt; From 1500 through 1832 there are only 28 known descriptions of successful tracheotomy in the literature.&lt;ref name=Goodall1934/&gt; The first detailed descriptions on tracheal intubation and subsequent [[artificial respiration]] of animals were from [[Andreas Vesalius]] (1514–1564) of Brussels. In his landmark book published in 1543, ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'', he described an experiment in which he passed a [[reed (plant)|reed]] into the trachea of a dying animal whose [[thorax]] had been opened and maintained ventilation by blowing into the reed intermittently.&lt;ref name=Baker1971/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vesalius1543/&gt; Vesalius wrote that the technique could be life-saving. [[Antonio Musa Brassavola]] (1490–1554) of [[Ferrara]] treated a patient suffering from [[peritonsillar abscess]] by tracheotomy after the patient had been refused by [[barber surgeon]]s. The patient apparently made a complete recovery and Brassavola published his account in 1546. This operation has been identified as the first recorded successful tracheostomy, despite many ancient references to the trachea and possibly to its opening.&lt;ref name=Goodall1934/&gt;

[[Image:Acquapendente - Operationes chirurgicae, 1685 - 2984755.tif|thumb|[[Hieronymus Fabricius]], ''Operationes chirurgicae'', 1685]]
Towards the end of the 16th century, anatomist and surgeon [[Hieronymus Fabricius]] (1533–1619) described a useful technique for tracheotomy in his writings, although he had never actually performed the operation himself. He advised using a vertical incision and was the first to introduce the idea of a tracheostomy tube. This was a straight, short [[cannula]] that incorporated wings to prevent the tube from advancing too far into the trachea. Fabricius' description of the tracheotomy procedure is similar to that used today. [[Julius Casserius]] (1561–1616) succeeded Fabricius as professor of anatomy at the University of Padua and published his own writings regarding technique and equipment for tracheotomy, recommending a curved silver tube with several holes in it. [[Marco Aurelio Severino]] (1580–1656), a skillful surgeon and anatomist, performed multiple successful tracheotomies during a [[diphtheria]] [[epidemic]] in [[Naples]] in 1610, using the vertical incision technique recommended by Fabricius. He also developed his own version of a trocar.&lt;ref name=Armytage1960/&gt;

In 1620 the French surgeon [[Nicholas Habicot]] (1550–1624), surgeon of the [[Duke of Nemours]] and anatomist, published a report of four successful "bronchotomies" he had performed.&lt;ref name=Habicot1620/&gt; One of these is the first recorded case of a tracheotomy for the removal of a foreign body, in this instance a blood clot in the larynx of a stabbing victim. He also described the first known tracheotomy performed on a [[Pediatrics|pediatric]] patient. A 14-year-old boy swallowed a bag containing 9 gold coins in an attempt to prevent its theft by a [[highwayman]]. The object became lodged in his [[esophagus]], obstructing his trachea. Habicot suggested that the operation might also be effective for patients suffering from inflammation of the larynx. He developed equipment for this surgical procedure that are similar in many ways to modern designs.

[[Sanctorius]] (1561–1636) is believed to be the first to use a trocar in the operation. He recommended leaving the cannula in place for a few days following the operation.&lt;ref name=Sanctorii1646/&gt; Early tracheostomy devices are illustrated in Habicot’s ''Question Chirurgicale''&lt;ref name=Habicot1620/&gt; and Julius Casserius' posthumous ''Tabulae anatomicae'' in 1627.&lt;ref name=Casserius1632/&gt; Thomas Fienus (1567–1631), Professor of Medicine at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Louvain]], was the first to use the word "tracheotomy" in 1649, but this term was not commonly used until a century later.&lt;ref name=Cawthorne1959/&gt; Georg Detharding (1671–1747), professor of anatomy at the [[University of Rostock]], treated a drowning victim with tracheostomy in 1714.&lt;ref name=Detharding1745/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wischhusen1977/&gt;&lt;ref name=Price1962/&gt;

Fearful of complications, most surgeons delayed the potentially life-saving tracheotomy until a patient was moribund, despite the knowledge that irreversible organ damage would have already occurred by that time. This began to change in the early 19th century, when the tracheotomy finally began to be recognized as a legitimate means of treating severe airway obstruction. In 1832, French physician [[Pierre Bretonneau]] (1778–1862) employed tracheotomy as a last resort to treat a case of [[diphtheria]].&lt;ref name=Trousseau1833/&gt; In 1852, Bretonneau's student [[Armand Trousseau]] (1801–1867) presented a series of 169 tracheotomies (158 of which were for [[croup]] and 11 for "chronic maladies of the larynx").&lt;ref name=Trousseau1852/&gt; In 1871, the German surgeon [[Friedrich Trendelenburg]] (1844–1924) published a paper describing the first successful elective human tracheotomy performed to administer general anesthesia.&lt;ref name=Trendelenburg1871/&gt;&lt;ref name=hargrave1934/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bain1964/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wawersik1991/&gt; After the death of German Emperor [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]] from [[laryngeal cancer]] in 1888, Sir [[Morell Mackenzie]] (1837–1892) and the other treating physicians collectively wrote a book discussing the then-current [[Indication (medicine)|indications]] for tracheotomy and when the operation is absolutely necessary.&lt;ref name=Mackenzie1888/&gt;

In the early 20th century, physicians began to use the tracheotomy in the treatment of patients afflicted with paralytic [[poliomyelitis]] who required mechanical ventilation. The currently used surgical tracheotomy technique was described in 1909 by [[Chevalier Jackson]] (1865–1958), a professor of laryngology at [[Jefferson Medical College#Jefferson Medical College|Jefferson Medical College]] in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=Jackson1909/&gt; However, surgeons continued to debate various aspects of the tracheotomy well into the 20th century. Many techniques were employed, along with many different surgical instruments and tracheal tubes. Surgeons could not seem to reach a consensus on where or how the tracheal incision should be made, arguing whether the "high tracheotomy" or the "low tracheotomy" was more beneficial. Ironically, the newly developed [[Inhalational anaesthetic|inhalational anesthetic agents]] and techniques of general anesthesia actually seemed to increase the risks, with many patients suffering fatal postoperative complications. Jackson emphasised the importance of postoperative care, which dramatically reduced the mortality rate. By 1965, the surgical anatomy was thoroughly and widely understood, [[antibiotic]]s were widely available and useful for treating postoperative infections and other major complications of tracheotomy had also become more manageable.

While all these surgical advances were taking place, many important developments were also taking place in the science of [[optics]]. Many new [[optical instrument]]s with medical applications were invented during the 19th century. In 1805, a German army surgeon named [[Philipp Bozzini|Philipp von Bozzini]] (1773–1809) invented a device he called the ''lichtleiter'' (or light-guiding instrument). This instrument, the ancestor of the modern endoscope, was used to examine the [[urethra]], the human [[urinary bladder]], [[rectum]], oropharynx and nasopharynx.&lt;ref name=Bozzini1806/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bozzini1810/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bush1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pearlman1949/&gt; The instrument consisted of a candle within a metal chimney; a mirror on the inside reflected light from the candle through attachments into the relevant body cavity.&lt;ref name=Engel2007/&gt; The practice of gastric endoscopy in humans was pioneered by United States Army surgeon [[William Beaumont]] (1785–1853) in 1822 with the cooperation of his patient [[Alexis St. Martin]] (1794–1880), a victim of an accidental gunshot wound to the stomach.&lt;ref name=Beaumont1838/&gt; In 1853, [[Antonin Jean Desormeaux]] (1815–1882) of Paris modified Bozzini's lichtleiter such that a mirror would reflect light from a [[kerosene lamp]] through a long metal channel.&lt;ref name=Engel2007/&gt; Referring to this instrument as an ''[[Endoscopy|endoscope]]'' (he is credited with coining this term), Desormeaux employed it to examine the urinary bladder. However, like Bozzini's lichtleiter, Desormeaux's endoscope was of limited utility due to its propensity to become very hot during use.&lt;ref name=Engel2007/&gt; In 1868, [[Adolph Kussmaul]] (1822–1902) of Germany performed the first [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy]] (a [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] procedure in which an endoscope is used to visualize the esophagus, stomach and [[duodenum]]) on a living human. The subject was a [[Sword swallowing|sword-swallower]], who swallowed a metal tube with a length of 47 centimeters and a diameter of 13 millimeters.&lt;ref name=Killian1911/&gt;&lt;ref name=Modlin2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Elewaut2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vilardell2006/&gt; On 2 October 1877, [[Berlin]] [[Urology|urologist]] [[Maximilian Nitze|Maximilian Carl-Friedrich Nitze]] (1848–1906) and [[Vienna|Viennese]] instrument maker Josef Leiter (1830–1892) introduced the first practical [[Cystoscopy|cystourethroscope]] with an electric light source.&lt;ref name=Mouton1998/&gt; The instrument's biggest drawback was the [[tungsten]] filament [[incandescent light bulb]] (invented by [[Alexander Lodygin]], 1847–1923), which became very hot and required a complicated [[water cooling]] system.&lt;ref name=Engel2007/&gt; In 1881, Polish physician [[Jan Mikulicz-Radecki]] (1850–1905) created the first rigid gastroscope for practical applications.&lt;ref name=Mikulicz1881/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schramm1881/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kielan2005/&gt;

In 1932, [[Rudolf Schindler (doctor)|Rudolph Schindler]] (1888–1968) of Germany introduced the first semi-flexible gastroscope.&lt;ref name=Schafer2004/&gt; This device had numerous [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] positioned throughout the tube and a miniature light bulb at the distal tip. The tube of this device was 75 centimeters long and 11 millimeters in diameter, and the distal portion was capable of a certain degree of flexion. Between 1945 and 1952, [[Optical engineering|optical engineers]] (particularly Karl Storz (1911–1996) of the [[Karl Storz GmbH]] company of Germany, [[Harold Hopkins (physicist)|Harold Hopkins]] (1918–1995) of England and [[Mutsuo Sugiura]] of the Japanese [[Olympus Corporation]]) built upon this early work, leading to the development of the first "gastrocamera".&lt;ref name=Uji1951/&gt;&lt;ref name=HistoryVol2/&gt; In 1964, Fernando Alves Martins (born 17 June 1927) of Portugal applied [[optical fiber]] technology to one of these early gastrocameras to produce the first gastrocamera with a flexible fiberscope.&lt;ref name=HistoryVol3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Martins2009/&gt; Initially used in esophagogastroduodenoscopy, newer devices were developed in the late 1960s for use in [[bronchoscopy]], [[rhinoscope|rhinoscopy]] and laryngoscopy. The concept of using a fiberoptic endoscope for tracheal intubation was introduced by Peter Murphy, an English anesthetist, in 1967.&lt;ref name=Murphy1967/&gt; By the mid-1980s, the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope had become an indispensable instrument within the [[pulmonology]] and anesthesia communities.&lt;ref name=Wheeler2007/&gt;

''Figures contemporaines tirées de l’Album Mariani'', Volume I. Paris:Ernest Flammarion.]]

In 1854, a Spanish [[Vocal pedagogy|vocal pedagogist]] named [[Manuel Patricio Rodríguez García|Manuel García]] (1805–1906) became the first man to view the functioning glottis in a living human. García developed a tool that used two mirrors for which the Sun served as an external [[Light source#Light sources|light source]].&lt;ref name=Garcia1855/&gt; Using this device, he was able to observe the function of his own glottic apparatus and the uppermost portion of his trachea. He presented his observations at the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]] in 1855.&lt;ref name=Garcia1855/&gt;&lt;ref name=Radomski2005/&gt;

In 1858, [[Eugène Bouchut]] (1818–1891), a [[Pediatrics|pediatrician]] from Paris, developed a new technique for non-surgical orotracheal intubation to bypass laryngeal obstruction resulting from a diphtheria-related pseudomembrane. His method involved introducing a small straight metal tube into the larynx, securing it by means of a silk thread and leaving it there for a few days until the pseudomembrane and airway obstruction had resolved sufficiently.&lt;ref name=Bouchut1858/&gt; Bouchut presented this experimental technique along with the results he had achieved in the first seven cases at the [[French Academy of Sciences]] conference on 18 September 1858.&lt;ref name=SPerati2007/&gt; The members of the Academy rejected Bouchut's ideas, largely as a result of highly critical and negative remarks made by the influential Armand Trousseau.&lt;ref name=Trousseau1858/&gt; Undaunted, Bouchut later introduced a set of tubes ("Bouchut's tubes") for intubation of the trachea, as an alternative to tracheotomy in cases of diphtheria.

In March 1878, Wilhelm Hack of [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]] published a paper describing the use of non-surgical orotracheal intubation in the removal of [[Vocal fold nodule|vocal cord polyps]].&lt;ref name=Hack1878-uber/&gt; In November of that year, he published another study, this time on the use of orotracheal intubation to secure the airway of a patient with acute [[epiglottitis|glottic edema]], progressively introducing sizes 3 through 11 of "Schrotter's graduated triangular [[Vulcanization|vulcanite]] bougies" into the larynx.&lt;ref name=Hack1878-sammlung/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macewen18800731/&gt; In 1880, the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] surgeon [[William Macewen]] (1848–1924) reported on his use of orotracheal intubation as an alternative to tracheotomy to allow a patient with glottic edema to breathe, as well as in the setting of general anesthesia with [[chloroform]].&lt;ref name=Macewen18800731/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macewen18800724/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macmillan2010/&gt; All previous observations of the glottis and larynx (including those of García, Hack and Macewen) had been performed under indirect vision (using mirrors) until 23 April 1895, when [[Alfred Kirstein]] (1863–1922) of Germany first described direct visualization of the vocal cords. Kirstein performed the first direct laryngoscopy in Berlin, using an esophagoscope he had modified for this purpose; he called this device an ''autoscope''.&lt;ref name=Hirsch1986/&gt; The death in 1888 of Emperor Frederick III&lt;ref name=Mackenzie1888/&gt; may have motivated Kirstein to develop the autoscope.&lt;ref name=Burkle2004/&gt;

Until 1913, [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]] was performed by mask [[Inhalational anaesthetic|inhalation anesthesia]], topical application of [[local anesthetic]]s to the [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]], rectal anesthesia, or [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] anesthesia. While otherwise effective, these techniques did not protect the airway from obstruction and also exposed patients to the risk of pulmonary aspiration of blood and [[mucus]] into the tracheobronchial tree. In 1913, [[Chevalier Jackson]] was the first to report a high rate of success for the use of direct laryngoscopy as a means to intubate the trachea.&lt;ref name=Jackson1913/&gt; Jackson introduced a new laryngoscope blade that had a light source at the distal tip, rather than the proximal light source used by Kirstein.&lt;ref name=Zeitels1998/&gt; This new blade incorporated a component that the operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an endotracheal tube or bronchoscope.&lt;ref name=Jackson1922/&gt;

That same year, [[Henry Harrington Janeway|Henry H. Janeway]] (1873–1921) published results he had achieved using a laryngoscope he had recently developed.&lt;ref name=Janeway1913/&gt; An American anesthesiologist practicing at [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue Hospital]] in [[New York City]], Janeway was of the opinion that direct intratracheal [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] of [[Volatile anaesthetic|volatile anesthetics]] would provide improved conditions for [[Otolaryngology|otolaryngologic]] surgery. With this in mind, he developed a laryngoscope designed for the sole purpose of tracheal intubation. Similar to Jackson's device, Janeway's instrument incorporated a distal light source. Unique however was the inclusion of [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] within the handle, a central notch in the blade for maintaining the tracheal tube in the midline of the oropharynx during intubation and a slight curve to the distal tip of the blade to help guide the tube through the glottis. The success of this design led to its subsequent use in other types of surgery. Janeway was thus instrumental in popularizing the widespread use of direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in the practice of anesthesiology.&lt;ref name=Burkle2004/&gt;

After [[World War I]], further advances were made in the field of intratracheal anesthesia. Among these were those made by Sir [[Ivan Magill|Ivan Whiteside Magill]] (1888–1986). Working at the [[Frognal House|Queen's Hospital for Facial and Jaw Injuries]] in [[Sidcup]] with plastic surgeon Sir [[Harold Gillies]] (1882–1960) and anesthetist E. Stanley Rowbotham (1890–1979), Magill developed the technique of awake blind nasotracheal intubation.&lt;ref name=Rowbotham1921/&gt;&lt;ref name=Magill1923-provision/&gt;&lt;ref name=Magill1928/&gt;&lt;ref name=Magill1930/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas1978/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mclachlan2008/&gt; Magill devised a new type of angulated forceps (the Magill forceps) that are still used today to facilitate nasotracheal intubation in a manner that is little changed from Magill's original technique.&lt;ref name=Magill1920/&gt; Other devices invented by Magill include the Magill laryngoscope blade,&lt;ref name=Magill1926/&gt; as well as several apparati for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents.&lt;ref name=Magill1921-portable/&gt;&lt;ref name=Magill1921-warming/&gt;&lt;ref name=Magill1923-apparatus/&gt; The Magill curve of an endotracheal tube is also named for Magill.

Sir [[Robert Reynolds Macintosh]] (1897–1989) also achieved significant advances in techniques for tracheal intubation when he introduced his new curved laryngoscope blade in 1943.&lt;ref name=Macintosh1943/&gt; The Macintosh blade remains to this day the most widely used laryngoscope blade for orotracheal intubation.&lt;ref name=Scott2009/&gt; In 1949, Macintosh published a case report describing the novel use of a [[Natural rubber|gum elastic]] [[Urinary catheterization#Catheter types|urinary catheter]] as an endotracheal tube introducer to facilitate difficult tracheal intubation.&lt;ref name=Macintosh1949/&gt; Inspired by Macintosh's report, P. Hex Venn (who was at that time the anesthetic advisor to the British firm Eschmann Brothers &amp; Walsh, Ltd.) set about developing an endotracheal tube introducer based on this concept. Venn's design was accepted in March 1973, and what became known as the Eschmann endotracheal tube introducer went into production later that year.&lt;ref name=Venn1993/&gt; The material of Venn's design was different from that of a gum elastic bougie in that it had two layers: a core of tube woven from [[polyester]] threads and an outer [[resin]] layer. This provided more stiffness but maintained the flexibility and the slippery surface. Other differences were the length (the new introducer was {{convert|60|cm|0|abbr=on}}, which is much longer than the gum elastic bougie) and the presence of a 35° curved tip that let it be steered around obstacles.&lt;ref name=Viswanathan1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henderson2003/&gt; The concept of using a stylet for replacing or exchanging orotracheal tubes was introduced by Finucane and Kupshik in 1978, using a [[central venous catheter]].&lt;ref name=Finucane1978/&gt;

[[File:Glidescope 01.JPG|thumb|Glidescope video laryngoscope, incorporating a [[CMOS]] [[active pixel sensor]] (CMOS APS) [[video camera]] and a [[Image resolution|high resolution]] [[TFT LCD|LCD monitor]]]]

The 20th century saw the transformation of the practices of tracheotomy, endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation from rarely employed procedures to essential components of the practices of anesthesia, [[Intensive-care medicine|critical care medicine]], [[emergency medicine]], [[gastroenterology]], pulmonology and surgery. The [[Information Age|"digital revolution"]] of the 21st century has brought newer technology to the art and science of tracheal intubation. Several manufacturers have developed [[Video laryngoscope#Video laryngoscope|video laryngoscopes]] that use [[Digital electronics|digital technology]] such as the [[CMOS]] [[active pixel sensor]] (CMOS APS) to generate a view of the glottis so that the trachea may be intubated. The Glidescope video laryngoscope is one example of such a device.&lt;ref name=Agro2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooper2005/&gt;

[[Bahrain]] is a Source and destination country for men and women subjected to [[human trafficking|trafficking in persons]], specifically [[forced labor]] and [[forced prostitution]]. Men and women from [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]], the [[Philippines]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[Eritrea]] migrate voluntarily to Bahrain to work as [[domestic worker]]s or as unskilled laborers in the construction and service industries. Some, however, face conditions of forced labor after arriving in Bahrain, through use of such practices as unlawful withholding of [[passport]]s, restrictions on movement, contract substitution, non-payment of wages, threats, and physical or sexual abuse.

A study by the Bahrain Government’s Labor Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA) found that 65 percent of [[migrant worker]]s had not seen their employment contract, and that 89 percent were unaware of their terms of employment upon arrival in Bahrain. Many labor recruitment agencies in Bahrain and source countries require workers to pay high recruitment fees – a practice that makes workers highly vulnerable to forced labor once in Bahrain. The LMRA study found that 70 percent of foreign workers borrowed money or sold property in their home countries in order to secure a job in Bahrain.

Some Bahraini employers illegally charge workers exorbitant fees to remain in Bahrain working for third-party employers (under the “free visa” arrangement). The LMRA estimates that approximately 10 percent of migrant workers were in Bahrain under illegal “free visa” arrangements – a practice that can contribute to [[debt bondage]] – while the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry puts the figure at 25 percent. Women from Thailand, the Philippines, [[Morocco]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Vietnam]] and Eastern European States are subjected to forced prostitution in Bahrain.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Bahrain". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142759.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Bahrain]] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government reported its second and third prosecutions under its anti-trafficking statute, and continued to educate potential trafficking victims on their rights. However, the government did not show evidence of progress in providing protective services to victims or prosecuting offenses related to labor trafficking, the most prevalent form of trafficking in Bahrain.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt; 

U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2"]]  in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been classified in Tier 3 during the 2007 report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bahrain: Reform, Security, and U.

By 2010, it remained in the Tier 2 category but the watch list designation was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Stability and U.S. National Security|last=Boon|first=Kristen|last2=Huq|first2=Aziz|last3=Lovelace|first3=Douglas|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199915897|location=Oxford|pages=545}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are sectors within the country that views the human trafficking report and the initiative to improve the performance against human tracking as an intrusion to Bahrain's domestic affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Report: Emerging Bahrain 2007|last=Oxford Business Group|first=|publisher=Oxford Business Group|year=2007|isbn=9781902339733|location=Oxford|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there are also those who argue that these commitments allow Bahrain to burnish its credentials as a model  state in the [[Middle East]], particularly with respect to its responses to the human tracking problem.

==Prosecution==
The Government of Bahrain made some progress in conducting anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts during the year. The 2008 Law to Combat Trafficking in Persons prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons and prescribes penalties ranging from three to 15 years’ imprisonment, which are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as [[rape]].

The Bahrain government reported two new prosecutions and one new investigation under the anti-trafficking law in the reporting period; all three of these cases involved sex trafficking. One of the prosecutions involved a Bahraini employee of the Ministry of Interior and a [[Thailand|Thai]] national accused of trafficking Asian women into prostitution. The other involved a Bahraini and a Russian national accused of trafficking [[Women in Russia|Russian women]]. Furthermore, two Bahraini nationals were sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] in April and October 2009 for murdering their [[Indonesia]]n and [[Ethiopia]]n housemaids, respectively; the government reported that these cases contained elements of [[human trafficking]]. The government did not criminally prosecute any employers or labor agents for [[unfree labour|forced labor]] of migrant laborers, including domestic workers.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

There is some indication that government officials may be involved in human trafficking. [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and laborers assert that Bahraini officials provide Bahrainis with authorization to sponsor more expatriate workers than they could reasonably employ, and that in their private capacities, some officials illegally engage in “free visa” arrangements and withhold employees’ passports and salaries. The Royal Police Academy provided new police recruits with specific instruction on identifying trafficking victims during the reporting period. In addition, 29 law enforcement officers participated in a three-day trafficking-related investigations course run by [[International Organization for Migration]] (IOM), one of several anti-trafficking programs run by IOM in partnership with the Government of Bahrain. In early 2010, the Government of Bahrain centralized all trafficking-related prosecutions within the office of the Chief Prosecutor for the [[Manama]] district.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The Government of Bahrain made no discernible progress in improving protective services available to trafficking victims over the last year. The government continued to lack a formal procedure to identify victims among vulnerable groups, such as [[migrant domestic workers]] who have left their employers or women arrested for prostitution. As a result, potential trafficking victims may have been charged with employment or immigration violations, detained, and deported without adequate protection. Most [[migrant worker]]s who were able to flee their abusive employers were frequently charged as “runaways,” sentenced to two weeks’ [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]], and [[deportation|deported]]. The government does not ensure that victims receive access to essential protective services, except for the very small number referred to the government’s primary shelter.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The 120-bed government-funded, NGO-run Dar Al Aman shelter provided shelter to a small number of trafficking victims. The majority of victims continued to seek shelter at their embassies or at the Migrant Workers Protection Society’s shelter. The Dar Al Aman shelter does not advertise that it accepts trafficking victims, and many police officers were unfamiliar with procedures for referring victims of labor abuse and human trafficking. An international NGO reported that the shelter restricted residents’ [[freedom of movement]], was not staffed with qualified personnel, and did not provide long-term shelter or housing benefits to victims.

There is a restrictive intake process for non-Bahraini victims; however, in January 2010, the government’s inter-ministerial anti-trafficking committee indicated that it instructed police and prosecutors to refer any abused female worker to the shelter, regardless of signs of abuse. There are no shelters for male trafficking victims or abused or runaway workers.

The three trafficking victims who the government identified during the reporting period were referred to the Dar Al Aman shelter and received legal, medical, and psychological services. The government of Bahrain encouraged victims to participate in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers. However, discouraged workers typically did not file court cases against employers due to fear or ignorance of the law, distrust of the legal system, inability to afford legal representation, lack of interpretation/translation, fear of losing residency permits during legal proceedings, and to avoid additional maltreatment at the hands of the employer. The government does not provide legal alternatives for the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face retribution or hardship. The Ministry of Interior established a toll-free [[hotline]] in January 2010 for trafficking victims, although NGOs report that news of the hotline has not been widely disseminated.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The government made limited progress in preventing [[human trafficking]] over the reporting period. While Bahrain’s Ministry of Labor has pledged to end the sponsorship (kafala) system, foreign workers remain tied to a Bahraini sponsor.

The government implemented reforms in August 2009 which designated the Labor Market Regulatory Authority as the lead agency for granting work permits to foreign workers, and expanding labor mobility for expatriate workers, under certain conditions. These reforms do not cover Bahrain’s approximately 70,000 [[domestic worker]]s – the group that is most vulnerable to trafficking. Another labor market reform limited the number of foreign workers small businesses many sponsor, which the LMRA states will cut back on illegal “free visa” arrangements and other labor abuses.

The parliament’s upper house recently approved a new labor law; however, it does not afford basic protections to domestic workers – the group most vulnerable to human trafficking. Moreover, the law against withholding workers’ [[passport]]s – a common practice that restricts the mobility of migrant workers and contributes to [[forced labor]] – was not enforced effectively, and the practice remained widespread. The LMRA continued to distribute pamphlets – prepared in coordination with the IOM – that explained how to legally obtain, maintain and switch a [[work visa]], and provided contact details to report suspected labor violations.

The LMRA also sponsored a [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]] radio show designed to raise awareness of workers’ rights. The government closed down a number of low-end hotels associated with organized [[prostitution]]. The government continued to provide financial support towards an IOM anti-trafficking capacity building program. The government does not have a National Plan of Action to address [[trafficking in persons]]. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ Undersecretary chaired an inter-ministerial committee that coordinates policies designed to combat trafficking. This committee convenes every other month on average, and includes government ministries, NGOs, and the Bahrain Women’s Union. The Ministry of Labor, which deals with most workers’ complaints, is currently not represented on this committee.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

'''Immigration reduction''' refers to a movement in the United States that advocates a reduction in the amount of [[immigration]] allowed into the country. Steps advocated for reducing the numbers of [[immigrants]] include advocating stronger action to prevent [[illegal entry]] and [[illegal immigration]], and reductions in non-immigrant temporary [[work visas]] (such as [[H-1B visa|H-1B]] and [[L-1 visa|L-1]]). Some advocate a tightening of the requirements for legal immigration requirements to reduce total numbers, or move the proportions of legal immigrants away from those on [[Anchor baby|family reunification]] programs to skills-based criteria. What separates it from others who want [[immigration reform]] is that reductionists see immigration- or one of its forms- as being a significant source of social, economic, and environmental problems, and wish to cut current immigration levels.

Many immigration reformists support continued legal immigration, only opposing illegal immigration. Some immigration reductionists want legal immigration to be set at a percentage of current levels until fewer adverse effects are created by legal immigration.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Tancredo's 2003 Bill [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:H.R.946.IH:]''As used in this Act, the term `immigration moratorium' means the period beginning on October 1, 2003, and ending on September 30 of the first fiscal year after fiscal year 2008 during which the President submits a report to Congress, which is approved by a joint resolution of Congress, that the flow of illegal immigration has been reduced to less than 10,000 aliens per year and that any increase in legal immigration resulting from termination of the immigration moratorium would have no adverse impact on the wages and working conditions of United States citizens, the achievement or maintenance of Federal environmental quality standards, or the capacity of public schools, public hospitals, and other public facilities to serve the resident population in those localities where immigrants are likely to settle.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The related terminology "self-deportation" or "to self-deport" refers to the viewpoint that social policy that illegal immigration to the U.S. can be reduced by causing residents to leave the U.S. on their own, thus creating a reduction.

==History==

Antecedents to immigration reduction or control exist in antiquity, notably in the Roman Empire, where high living standards were an attractant to poorer tribes at the edge of the Empire. Specifically the immigration from Northern Africa, the Middle East, and of Germanic tribes from the northern European continent and Pictish peoples north of [[Hadrian's Wall]] in [[Brittania]] were viewed as unwanted population influxes.

===Modern history of the immigration reduction movement===

There have been several discernible groups at various times within the United States, which pushed for immigration restrictions, with separate concerns, origins, and aims; thus there are several antecedents for the modern immigration reduction movement.  These include the [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] United States American Party, often called the [[Know Nothing]] movement of the mid-19th century, which objected to increased [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] immigration of predominantly Irish and German origin; the [[Immigration Restriction League]], which objected to greatly increased immigration from southern and eastern Europe during the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and the joint congressional [[Dillingham Commission]], which studied this latter complaint and proposed numerical restrictions. Eventually, following [[World War I]], these studies led to the [[Emergency Quota Act]] of 1921 and the [[Immigration Act of 1924]].

[[Organized labor]] and parts of the political [[left-wing|left]] have also had an ongoing debate over immigration levels into the U.S. going back to the 19th century.  The [[National Labor Union]] (1866–1874) campaigned for immigration restrictions as well as the [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]], as did the [[American Federation of Labor]] under the leadership of [[Samuel Gompers]].  The [[AFL-CIO]] did not reverse its position on immigration restrictions until 1999.  The early [[United States Socialist Party]] was split over the issue, with some Socialist leaders including [[Jack London]] and Congressman [[Victor Berger]] supporting immigration restrictions; the party as a whole never had consensus and officially opposed only the importation of strikebreakers.

A separate issue with some overlap was concern over [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].  The leading early influence on that issue was [[Paul R. Ehrlich]], who both founded [[Population Connection|Zero Population Growth]] and published ''[[The Population Bomb]]'' in 1968. The popular book foretold alarming disasters that would inevitably occur in the next decades. Though some of his predictions did not come to pass, many believe his main points are valid, and they succeeded in inspiring a movement. Environmentalists including [[David R. Brower]] and [[David Foreman]] took the threat seriously.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, B. Meredith. "[http://www.commondreams.org/views/061500-104.htm Immigration's Dire Effect on the Environment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204034228/http://www.commondreams.org/views/061500-104.htm |date=February 4, 2012 }}." [[Seattle Times]]. June 15, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Zero Population Growth organization did not involve itself, for the most part, in U.S. immigration policy, and a subset of the [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] movement grew which believed that immigration needed to be reduced, arguing that immigration was driving most U.S. population growth.  These activists founded organizations separate from ZPG which would specifically address immigration issues.  Among the important early organizations was [[Negative Population Growth]], founded in 1972 by Donald Mann.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org/whatis.html What is NPG?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608192353/http://www.npg.org/whatis.html |date=2011-06-08 }}. Negative Population Growth: Who We Are. Accessed January 5, 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading inspiration for the modern movement is [[John Tanton]], a self-described [[Progressivism|progressive]] and critic of [[neoclassical economics]].[http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/2608/keeping_america_empty/] Tanton founded the [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]] (FAIR) in 1979, the largest and best funded organization in the movement. Three years later, Tanton formed ''US, Inc''. as an incubator and funding source to help form other organizations. According to public tax records, US, Inc, FAIR, and other Tanton organizations have received large donations from the [[Pioneer Fund]] and from the foundations controlled by [[Richard Mellon Scaife]]. Tanton created ''US English'' (an English-only advocacy group), the [[Center for Immigration Studies]] (CIS), [[ProEnglish]] (another English-only advocacy group),  and [[The Social Contract Press]].  US, Inc and FAIR have provided funding and logistical support to other organizations, including [[American Immigration Control Foundation]] (AICF), [[California Coalition for Immigration Reform]] (CCIR), [[Californians for Population Stabilization]] (CAPS), and the recent [[Protect Arizona Now]] (PAN) initiative, ''Proposition 200''. FAIR claims that there is a relationship between lax immigration policies and [[terrorism]] such as the [[9/11]] attack, and it asserts there is no connection between itself and eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairus.org/site/PageServer?pagename=media_mediaff8a Dan Stein, ''Recognizing the Holes in Immigration Policies'', June 22, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;
 {{wikinews|Interview with U.S. Republican Presidential candidate Tom Tancredo}}

The movement seemed to be triumphant in 1994 when California voters passed [[Proposition 187]], an initiative that limited benefits to illegal aliens that had been authored and promoted by CCIR. However, one federal judge enjoined implementation of parts of the law as unconstitutional, and Democratic governor [[Gray Davis]] refused to pursue an appeal of the lower court decision, abandoning Proposition 187.  Residual resentment over the racially divisive campaigns on both sides of the issue made immigration a topic that politicians largely avoided dealing with. A notable exception has been [[Tom Tancredo]], who was elected to Congress from [[Littleton, Colorado]] in 1994. Together with [[Patrick Buchanan]] and the Tanton network, Tancredo has emerged as the most conspicuous voice advocating immigration reform in Congress.

The immigration reduction movement was partly rejuvenated by The ''Alliance for Stabilizing America's Population'' coalition. In 1997 members from a range of immigration reduction and environmental organizations met to rededicate themselves to the effort of population stabilization. Organized by Population-Environment Balance, it included such diverse groups as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balance.org/asap/asapsignatories.html Signatories - Alliance for Stabilizing America's Population]. Population-Environment Balance. June 2005. Accessed July 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Californians for Population Stabilization]] (CAPS)

Another effort was the coalition formed under the name ''U.S. Sustainable Population Policy Project'' (USS3P) in 1996 by [[Doug LaFollette|Douglas La Follette]] and [[David Pimentel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecofuture.org/pop/uss3p.html|title=USS3P - U.S. Sustainable Population Policy Project - EcoFuture Population and Sustainability|first=Fred|last=Elbel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USS3P membership contained many immigration reductionists of the time. In 1999 it sought cosponsors for a major national conference on immigration. A number of major individuals and minor organizations joined as co-sponsors, but no large national groups joined and it folded in 2000 without holding the intended conference.

The Internet offered new opportunities for communication by immigration reductionists, as it has with countless other movements. [[Peter Brimelow]] founded his [[VDARE]] writers collective in 1999. The year 1999 also saw the founding by Craig Nelson of [[ProjectUSA]] in New York City, which used billboards to advertise [[Census Bureau]] and other statistics about immigration in a campaign dubbed "Billboard Democracy," and publishes an ezine in which the term "Minuteman" was first used (2002) in connection with civilian border patrols. The [[NumbersUSA]] group founded by [[Roy Beck]] set up automated system for website visitors to send advocacy faxes to their legislators on immigration topics.  Numerous websites, email lists, weblogs, and other resources furthered the effort.

The electoral success of [[Arizona]]'s Proposition 200, PAN, indicates the support for immigration reductionism among voters. The PAN initiative qualified for the ballot following the expenditure by FAIR of hundreds of thousands of dollars for signature gathering, plus comparable sums for campaigning with some additional amounts raised locally. The initiative was adopted by the public by a significant margin and is likely to inspire similar efforts in other states.  The success of Proposition 200 in Arizona was followed in April 2005 by the [[Minuteman Project]], in which volunteers came to Arizona to help patrol the border, although this project did not have the support of the [[United States Border Patrol]] and generated some controversy.  The organizers of the Minuteman Project have announced plans for similar projects in other states including [[Texas]], [[California]], and [[Michigan]].

==Reasons for reducing immigration==
{{POV|date=April 2013}}
Reasons for favoring immigration reduction given by supporters include:
*[[Human overpopulation|Overpopulation]] and other [[environmentalism|environmental]] issues.
*Continued strong population growth through immigration drives up demand for housing.  Although various factors impact housing prices, high population growth conflicts with goals for "affordable housing."
*High levels of immigration may be seen as providing a steady source of cheap or low-wage [[labour (economics)|labor]] to [[corporations]].  This can be seen as detrimental to [[wages|wage]] levels in the U.S., and as a threat to the ability of [[labor union]]s to organize workplaces, with the threat always present that if workers organize they can easily be replaced by cheaper legal or illegal labor.
*Mass immigration has long been blamed for interfering with the employment of [[African-Americans]] and other minorities.&lt;ref name="PoC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ImmigrationHurtsPOC.com|title=Immigration Hurts Blacks and other Minorities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some believe the high levels of immigration into the US, whether legal or illegal, are at rates too high to allow recent immigrants to assimilate into US culture and discourages recent immigrants from learning the [[English language]].
*Illegal immigration is often seen as symptomatic of widespread lawbreaking by employers, who hire workers illegally in the country in order to escape wage, workplace safety, and labor laws.  This is especially a problem in the [[agriculture]] sector, where it is estimated that over 80% of workers are in the country illegally.  Supporters and critics of the movement debate over whether these workers could easily be replaced by legal workers being paid in accordance with wage laws.
*Temporary work visas are often used to replace high-wage workers in industries such as [[computer]] programming, [[biotechnology]] and [[engineering]] with lower-wage workers imported from other countries. This is seen by many{{who|date=December 2010}} as closely related to the practices of [[outsourcing]] and [[offshoring]] of jobs. The overall erosion of wages has been claimed to have resulted in many fewer Americans opting to pursue scientific majors in college and careers, and an overall decrease in the scientific ability of America's citizenry.

==Target immigration levels==
Immigration reductionists differ on the ideal level of immigration they would like to see into the United States.  Some believe the numbers should be set each year at whatever level would, in conjunction with the current [[fertility rate]] and emigration from the U.S., maintain zero population growth in the country.  The most prominent immigration reductionist in government today is U.S. Congressman [[Tom Tancredo]] R-CO. Tancredo has authored a bill that calls for limiting annual immigration to between 30,000 and 300,000. The organization, [[Population-Environment Balance]] (PEB), has issued a ''Immigration Moratorium Action Plan'' [http://www.balance.org/asap/asapplan.html] calling for a "non-piercable" cap of 100,000 persons annually, which would be a 95% cut from current levels. [[Carrying Capacity Network]] (CCN), another small reductionist group closely related to PEB, shares that goal while repeating that it is not opposed to immigration.

There are also some who support a moratorium on immigration. The [[Diversity Alliance for a Sustainable America]] claims that 43% of Californians polled said that a 3-year moratorium on immigration would be beneficial to the state (compared to 40% who said it would be unbeneficial).[https://web.archive.org/web/20041209192005/http://www.diversityalliance.org/docs/Poll-press.html] The [[America First Party (2002)|America First Party]] calls for a ten-year moratorium, with only spouses and children of citizens allowed in. [http://www.americafirstparty.org/docs/platform.shtml] Other advocates for  moratoriums include the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]][http://reformparty.org/platform.htm] and 2004 [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]] presidential candidate [[Michael Peroutka]] [http://www.issues2000.org/2004/Michael_Peroutka_Immigration.htm]. [[Robert Locke]] surpasses them by calling for a negative immigration rate. He has defined this as restricting immigration to the U.S. to what he calls the "normal" (i.e., pre-1965) average flow of immigrants throughout U.S. history, combined with the [[deportation]] of all illegal immigrants.[http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=2427]

The Carrying Capacity Network (CCN) and Population-Environment Balance '''(Now Defunct)''', two groups that both operate out of the same Washington, D.C. address, issue frequent statements that advocating for the numbers recommended by the Jordan Commission, 700,000 annually, is "counter-productive". In a ''National Alert'' the CCN warned that organizations supporting numbers higher than 300,000 undercut the movement, and they specifically criticize the Federation for American Immigration Reform and NumbersUSA. [https://web.archive.org/web/20041130023309/http://carryingcapacity.org/ealert2.html]

Some groups not connected to the immigration reduction movement nonetheless support a reduction to legal immigration levels of around 500,000 to 600,000. In their 1997 book, ''Misplaced Blame'', Alan Durning and Christopher Crowther of Northwest Environment Watch write that illegal immigration gets too much attention, and identify five main sources of population growth, including lack of access to [[family planning]] as well as a misguided legal immigration policy, and subsidies to domestic migration. They readily admit that immigration should be reduced by an unspecified amount, but they also show concern for the rights of existing residents. [https://web.archive.org/web/20040113202707/http://www.northwestwatch.org/publications/mpblamedownload.asp].  The AFL-CIO and some mainstream [[environmentalist]] groups used to be on record favoring lower immigration numbers, although most have quietly dropped this position in recent years.

==Proposed methods of reducing illegal immigration==

===Border barriers===
{{Main article|Mexico–United States barrier}}
The focus of some immigration reduction groups is hindering [[illegal entry]] by building barriers on the border.  The [[United States-Mexico barrier]] has been partially constructed to reduce the flow of unauthorized migrants into the United States. Mexico is constructing a barrier to immigration along its southern border. Presently, [[India]] is constructing a fence along the border to restrict migrants from [[Bangladesh]],&lt;ref name="BBC-FOOC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Villagers left in limbo by border fence|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4653810.stm|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=BBC|date=2006-01-28|work=BBC News website}}&lt;/ref&gt; the {{convert|4,000|km|mi|sp=us}} long [[Indo-Bangladeshi barrier]]; The stated aim of the fence is to stop infiltration of terrorists, prevent smuggling, and to bring a close to unauthorized migration from Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="JPost-Fences"&gt;{{cite web|title=The good fences epidemic|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1170359860662&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/Printer|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|date=2007-02-14|work=The Jerusalem Post|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209170816/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1170359860662&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter|archivedate=2011-12-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesOnline"&gt;{{cite news|title=India builds a 2,500-mile barrier to rival the Great Wall of China|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article782933.ece|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd|date=2005-12-28|work=The Times Online website | location=London | first=Raekha | last=Prasad}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[People's Republic of China]] is building a security barrier along its border with [[North Korea]] to prevent defectors or refugees from North Korea from entering the country illegally.&lt;ref name="Jurist"&gt;{{cite web|title=China building border fence facing North Korea |url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/10/china-building-border-fence-facing.php |accessdate=2008-08-16 |publisher=Bernard J.

===Attrition through enforcement===
{{main|Self-deportation}}
Pro-enforcement U.S. think tanks such as the [[Center for Immigration Studies]] have supported an "attrition through enforcement" doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cis.org/articles/2006/back406.html | publisher=[[Center for Immigration Studies]] | title=Attrition Through Enforcement: A Cost-Effective Strategy to Shrink the Illegal Population | author=Vaughan, Jessica M. |date=April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The aim here is to, as that organization states, "Shrink the illegal population through consistent, across-the-board enforcement of the immigration law. By deterring the settlement of new illegals, by increasing deportations to the extent possible, and, most importantly, by increasing the number of illegals already here who give up and deport themselves, the United States can bring about an annual decrease in the illegal-alien population, rather than allowing it to continually increase."&lt;ref name="cis.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cis.org/articles/2005/back605.html|title=Downsizing Illegal Immigration|website=CIS.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach concedes that mass deportations of illegal aliens is logistically, economically, and politically untenable.&lt;ref name="cis.org"/&gt;

[[Arizona SB1070]], the broadest and strictest anti-illegal immigration measure enacted in the U.S. in generations,&lt;ref name="nyt-az-law"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/us/politics/24immig.html?ref=us | title=U.S.’s Toughest Immigration Law Is Signed in Arizona | author=Archibold, Randal C. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 24, 2010 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly states its intent as implementing the attrition through enforcement strategy.&lt;ref name="sb1070 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf | title=State of Arizona: Senate Bill 1070, Section 1.| publisher=[[Arizona State Legislature]] | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intergovernmental cooperation===
Conservative blogger [[Michelle Malkin]] supports coordination with federal authorities through the use of [[Section 287(g)]] of the [[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act]]. Section 287(g) provides for the deputization of state and local law enforcement officers, for the purposes of reporting of immigrants who have violated immigration law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michellemalkin.com/2005/01/17/bushs-open-borders-nominees-2/|title=MichelleMalkin.com|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022142806/http://michellemalkin.com/2005/01/17/bushs-open-borders-nominees-2/|archivedate=2007-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morristown, New Jersey]] mayor [[Donald Cresitello]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]) has sought to deputize his police as immigration agents. [[Newark, New Jersey]] city councilman Ron Rice, Jr. has proposed a resolution mandating police to report felony suspects when they are found to be in the United State illegally.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Llorente, "Newark killings become immigration flash point," North Jersey Media Group, August 14, 2007 {{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr%3DeXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTgxNjYzJnlyaXJ5N2Y3MTdmN3ZxZWVFRXl5Ng%3D%3D |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070616140555/http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTgxNjYzJnlyaXJ5N2Y3MTdmN3ZxZWVFRXl5Ng== |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 16, 2007 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[Attorney General of New Jersey]] [[Anne Milgram]] has expanded officers power regarding [[illegal immigrant]]s. She told the [[state police]] to inform federal authorities when an illegal immigrant is arrested in an indictable crime or for drunk driving. There are an estimated 380,000 people living in New Jersey without proper immigration documents. She said that she wanted local, county and state police to hand more serious cases directly to [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Baldwin, "State AG broadens officers' power over illegal immigrants" "Gannett New Jersey" August 23, 2007  http://www.courierpostonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070823/NEWS01/708230422/1006/news01&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative initiatives===
Others focus on [[lobbying]] to lower future illegal immigration levels through congressional action, and to fight amnesties for existing illegal immigrants.

Many immigration restrictionists question the 1898 Supreme Court ruling ''[[U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark]],'' which held that individuals born on U.S. soil to non-citizen parents are U.S. citizens and guaranteed all the rights thereof. They feel that citizenship should be denied to the children of immigrants without valid immigration status.  Thus they have sought to end [[Birthright citizenship in the United States of America|birthright citizenship]], through a constitutional amendment or a congressional act.

Denial of public benefits to undocumented individuals is believed to remove the incentives and rewards for illegal immigrants.  The 1994 California [[California Proposition 187 (1994)|Proposition 187]] and the 2004 Arizona Proposition 200 ''[[Protect Arizona Now]]'' were written to require proof of legal status in order to receive non-mandated benefits.

==Differences within immigration reductionism==
Many who support reduced immigration numbers oppose association with the more extreme groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inthesetimes.com/article/2608/keeping_america_empty|title=Keeping America Empty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]] has spoken out in 2004 against the views of another reductionist leader, [[Virginia Abernethy]], calling her views "repulsive separatist views," and called on her to resign from the advisory board of Protect Arizona Now in Arizona. PEB and CCN are also critical of FAIR for FAIR's support of a national ID card, which PEB and CCN oppose. The Protect Arizona Now movement split, with two rival state-level organizations, one supported by FAIR, the other supported by PEB and CCN, working to support the passage of the ballot initiative.

==Public opinion on immigration reduction==
Some polls such as a late 2013 survey by the [[Public Religion Research Institute]] have found widespread opposition to immigration reduction. Said survey stated that 63% of Americans support creating a pathway to citizenship so that formerly illegal residents of the U.S. could gradually acquire it while only 18% back a hypothetical plan to find and deport all illegal residents.&lt;ref name=long-past&gt;{{cite news | last = Frumin | first =Aliyah | title = Obama: ‘Long past time’ for immigration reform | date = November 25, 2013| url = http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/obama-long-past-time-reform | publisher = [[MSNBC.com]]|accessdate = January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indo-Martiniquais''' are an ethnic group of [[Martinique]], compromising approximately 10% of the population of the island. The Indo-Martiniquais are descendants of indentured laborers of the nineteenth century from [[India]] of primarily [[Tamil people|Tamil]] and of other  [[Indian people|Indian]] origin. They are primarily most concentrated in the northern communes of [[Martinique]], where the main plantations are located.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=ZOlNv8MAXIEC&amp;pg=PA594&amp;dq=indian+Martinique&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjiyL2e8rPRAhWFjSwKHesnAacQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=indian%20Martinique&amp;f=false|title=The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: South Asia : the Indian subcontinent|last=Nettl|first=Bruno|last2=Stone|first2=Ruth M.|last3=Porter|first3=James|last4=Rice|first4=Timothy|date=1998-01-01|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780824049461|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indo-Martiniquais speak [[Antillean Creole French|Antillean]] a French-based creole.

==Migration history==
In 1851 the Martinique authorities, seeking to replace former slave labourers who had abandoned plantation work on being given their liberty, recruited several thousand labourers from the Indian French colonial settlements of [[Madras]], [[Pondicherry district|Pondichéry]], [[Chandernagor]] and [[Karaikal]]. Workers were offered free passage and pay in exchange for serving a five-year period of labour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/category,COI,,,MTQ,4954ce38c,0.html : World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples - Martinique : Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initial experiences of racial discrimination and labour exploitation, many of the immigrants were subsequently well-integrated into the population,&lt;ref&gt;[http://membres.multimania.fr/fdl/e-histo.htm : A SHORT HISTORY OF MARTINIQUE]&lt;/ref&gt; and by the late 20th century the labourers' descendants were broadly assimilated into Martiniquais culture.

The past two decades have seen Indo-Martiniquais people increasingly asserting the distinctively Indian aspects of their heritage (a phenomenon known as "indianité"). People of Indian descent have paid renewed attention to the history and culture of India, and local groups have established contact with peoples of Indian descent from throughout the Caribbean and further afield. One token of this has been the recent revival of a traditional Hindu annual [[mela]] on the island, sustained by the Hindu temples and shrines that were introduced by the migrant labourers and remain operational today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everyculture.com/Ma-Ni/Martinique.html : Countries and their Cultures: MARTINIQUE]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

The majority of Indo-Martiniquais follow [[christianity]] with the minority following Islam and Hinduism. The Hinduism in [[Martinique]] constitutes of a variation of popular Tamil Hinduism, which was characterized by the practice of animal sacrifice, the veneration of village deities and the use of the [[Tamil language]] as the ceremonial language, although the language has lost its usage in the plantation and post-plantation society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=XOyYCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA356&amp;lpg=PA356&amp;dq=hinduism+in+martinique&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dR56Y-sXEV&amp;sig=Cipo7sOHplj9WTknYzp3RDQmCrU&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdh-WY_bPRAhUQKywKHTbnAaQQ6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=hinduism%20in%20martinique&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of Caribbean Religions: Volume 1: A - L; Volume 2: M - Z|last=Taylor|first=Patrick|last2=Case|first2=Frederick I.|date=2013-04-30|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252094330|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of Martinique's most famous dishes, the '''Colombo''', derives from Indian cuisine. The word Colombo derives from the Tamil word ''குழம்பு- kulambu'' meaning curry sauce. The dish is a unique curry of chicken, meat or fish with vegetables, spiced with a distinctive masala of Tamil origin, acidulated with tamarind and often containing wine, coconut milk, and rum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theculturetrip.com/caribbean/martinique/articles/top-10-martinican-dishes/|title=Top 10 Martinican Dishes You Just Have to Try|last=Rabikowska|first=Suzy|newspaper=Culture Trip|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kalpak is used to keep the head warm in winter and shade out the sun during summer. There are different kalpaks for different seasons, with kalpaks used in winter being thicker and the ones used in summer being thinner but broader for shading purposes.

There are many styles of kalpak. They usually can be folded flat for keeping or carrying when not being worn. The brim can be turned up all the way around. Sometimes there is a cut in the brim so that a two-pointed peak can be formed. Plain white ones are often reserved for festivals and special occasions. Those intended for everyday use may have a black velvet lining. In the Turkic cultures of central Asia, they have a sharp tapering to resemble a mountain, rather than the cyndrical kalpaks of Turkey.

The word ''kalpak'' is also a component of the [[ethnonym]] of a Turkic group of uncertain relatedness: the "[[Karakalpaks|Karakalpak]]" (literally "black kalpak" in [[Karakalpak language|Karakalpak]]).

In Russian and Persian, the word is also used for [[hubcap]] (for a car wheel's hub; see also the Wiktionary entry ''[[wikt:hubcap#Translations|hubcap]]'').

Amongst [[overseas Chinese]], the word ''kongsi'' was applied to reference both clan organizations, whose members shared a common descent, and social clubs, for Chinese immigrants originating from the same province. After the 19th century, these organizations came to be known as '''hui guan''' or '''hwee kuan''' (會館, literally meaning "meeting hall").

== Southeast Asia ==
In Southeast Asia, the [[kongsi republics]] were made up of [[Hakka people|Hakka]] Chinese mining communities that united into political entities that functioned as self-governing states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34635810|title="Chinese Settlements in Rural Southeast Asia: Unwritten Histories" in Sojourners and settlers : histories of Southeast Asia and the Chinese : in honour of Jennifer Cushman|last=Heidhues|first=Mary Somers|date=1996|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|others=Reid, Anthony, 1939-, Alilunas-Rodgers, Kristine., Cushman, Jennifer Wayne, 1944-, Asian Studies Association of Australia.|year=|isbn=1863739904|location=St Leonards, NSW|pages=|oclc=34635810}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-nineteenth century, the kongsi republics controlled most of western [[Borneo]].

==Functions of the Kongsi system==

The system of ''kongsi'' was utilized by Cantonese throughout the [[diaspora]] to overcome economic difficulty, social ostracism, and oppression.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} In today's [[Cantonese]] communities throughout the world, this approach has been adapted to the modern environment, including political and legal factors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} The kongsi is similar to modern business partnerships, but also draws on a deeper spirit of cooperation and consideration of mutual welfare. It is believed by some that the development and thriving of Cantonese communities worldwide are the direct result of the kongsi concept.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} A vast number of Cantonese-run firms and businesses that were born as ''kongsi'' ended up as multinational conglomerates.

'''Laotong''' (in English: old sames; written: 老同 in Chinese) is a type of relationship within Chinese culture, which was practised in [[Hunan]],{{when|date=February 2016}} that bonded two girls together for eternity as kindred sisters.

There were two cultural practises in [[Hunan]] in past centuries{{when|date=February 2016}} that acknowledged women's social bonds. One was Laotong, the other was Laotang.

Chinese women commonly refer to each other as "Sisters". This is a recognition of the importance of women's supportive relationships, which helped them endure hardship over their lives. Preparation for marriage might involve a Laotang relationship between several young women; the sisterhood would be dissolved upon marriage. After marriage, new sisterhoods could be formed later between married or widowed women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's life in China|url=http://www.dimsum.co.uk/china/womens-life-in-china.html|publisher=DimSum: The British Chinese Community Website|accessdate=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Chinese women, the Laotong or "old-sames" relationship was the strongest and most precious bond of female friendship. This was a more rare and formal relationship between women. A woman could only have one Laotong, and the intensely unbreakable bond was for life. 

Often a Laotong relationship would be formed when a marriage was contracted between families who were expecting babies. This was done before the babies were born. If both children turned out female against the hopes of their families, the daughters could be brought together as Laotong. An intermediary, in some places a matchmaker, would form a Laotong relationship between two girls, similar to an arranged marriage. The Chinese astrological profiles of the girls were considered during the matching process. It was unusual for a Laotong relationship to be broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's life in China|url=http://www.dimsum.co.uk/china/womens-life-in-china.html|publisher=DimSum: The British Chinese Community Website|accessdate=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship was made formal by the signing of a contract, which would be done much like a legal contract, using a [[seal (East Asia)|seal]]. Laotong would frequently develop a language to use to communicate between them that only they could understand (a type of [[Nu shu]]), allowing them to send messages back and forth to one another. 

These elements of the Laotong practise are shown in [[Lisa See]]'s novel ''[[Snow Flower and the Secret Fan]]'', which was made into a [[Snow Flower and the Secret Fan (film)|2011 movie]] directed by [[Wayne Wang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wang|first=Wayne|title=Snow Flower and the Secret Fan|url=http://www.landmarktheatres.com/letters/snowflowersecretfan.htm|publisher=Landmark Theatres|accessdate=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7189">The '''Maltese Falcon Society''' is an organization for admirers of [[Dashiell Hammett]], his novel ''[[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|The Maltese Falcon]],'' and [[hardboiled]] mystery books and writers in general. Founded in [[San Francisco]] in 1981, the organization is no longer active in the [[United States]]; however, a chapter in [[Japan]] has been active continuously since 1982. The Japanese branch of the society presents the [[Falcon Award]], Japan's highest honor in the mystery field, to honor the best hardboiled mystery novel published in Japan.

==Beginnings==
The Maltese Falcon Society was founded in [[San Francisco]] on May 20, 1981&lt;ref name="donherron.com"&gt;[http://www.donherron.com/falcon_flyer.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118012218/http://www.donherron.com/falcon_flyer.html |date=November 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by literary historian and biographer [[Don Herron]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/25/travel/shadowing-sam-spade.html?sec=travel|title= Shadowing Sam Spade|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 25, 1981|accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and private investigator Jayson Wechter.&lt;ref&gt;"The society that detects the mystique of mysteries" by Bethany Korwin-Pawlowska, ''Oakland Tribune'', October 23, 1981, pp. C-1, C-5&lt;/ref&gt; The society's first meeting was held at [[John's Grill]],&lt;ref&gt;"Maltese Falcon Society: Mystery lovers in spades", by Mike Hudson, ''Oakland Tribune'', May 26, 1981, p. C-4&lt;/ref&gt; a restaurant where Dashiell Hammett ate and which he featured in ''The Maltese Falcon''. The speakers at that first meeting were David Fechheimer, a Hammett researcher and private investigator, and [[E. Hoffmann Price]], a pulp fiction author.&lt;ref name="The Dashiell Hammett Tour 2009. Page 199"&gt;''The Dashiell Hammett Tour: Thirtieth Anniversary Guidebook''. By Don Herron. San Francisco: Vince Emery Productions, 2009. Page 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society opened chapters in New York&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/25/arts/in-footsteps-of-thin-man.html?scp=38&amp;sq=herbert%20mitgang%20dashiell%20hammett&amp;st=cse |title=In footsteps of 'Thin Man'|author=Herbert Mitgang|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 25, 1981|accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan.&lt;ref name="donherron.com"/&gt; By 1982, the society had 110 members in San Francisco, 55 in Japan, and 50 in New York.&lt;ref&gt;"Ryan's Dope" by William H. Ryan, ''San Francisco Appeal to Reason'', v. 1 n. 4, 1982, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; As its official toast, the society adopted the one used by Sam Spade in Chapter 2 of ''The Maltese Falcon'': "Success to crime."&lt;ref name="donherron.com"/&gt;

==Activities==
William Nadel of the New York chapter conducted a Dashiell Hammett/''Thin Man'' walking tour of Manhattan.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Founded by mystery writer Jiro Kimura,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thrillingdetective.com/terada.html |title=Sachinosuke Terada |publisher=Thrillingdetective.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Japanese chapter produced a newsletter called ''The Maltese Falcon Flyer'' ten times a year, and in 1983 began to present the annual Falcon Award. Co-founder Herron began to conduct the Dashiell Hammett Tour in San Francisco, the longest running literary tour in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donherron.com/ |title=Up and Down These Mean Streets &amp;#124; The official website of Don Herron |publisher=Donherron.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The San Francisco chapter meetings heard presentations by mystery novelists [[Julie Smith (novelist)|Julie Smith]], [[Charles Willeford]], Stephen Greenleaf, and [[Joe Gores]]. Other speakers included Hammett biographers [[Diane Johnson]] and [[William F. Nolan]], bounty hunter Tiny Boyles, people who knew Hammett including [[Jerome Weidman]], and coroners, crime reporters, FBI agents, and bail bondsmen. The San Francisco chapter also staged special events, such as a "shootout" conducted at the 1981 Marin Designers Showcase in Mill Valley, California, which resulted in the police being called.&lt;ref&gt;"Marin Showcase opens with a bang" by Tony Lewis and Jorie Parr, ''Mill Valley Record'', September 16, 1981, pp. 1, 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York chapter became inactive in the late 1980s. The fifth anniversary meeting of the San Francisco chapter was held May 27, 1986, on the 92nd anniversary of Hammett's birth, and it was the chapter's last. The author's daughter Jo Hammett was the final speaker.&lt;ref name="The Dashiell Hammett Tour 2009. Page 199"/&gt;

By 1990, only the Japanese chapter of The Maltese Falcon Society was still active. In 2006, the Japanese chapter produced a large-format softcover book in Japanese, ''The Complete Maltese Falcon Flyer 1982-2006'', which includes the first 250 issues of the newsletter with new introductions by Don Herron and other writers. In 2009, with about 90 members, the Japanese chapter continues to hold meetings in Tokyo and Osaka, to produce ''The Maltese Falcon Flyer'', and to present the Falcon Award.

==Falcon Awards==

'''Mexican Sign Language''' (''"lengua de señas mexicana"'' or '''LSM''', also known by several other names), is the language of the [[Deaf]] community in the urban regions of [[Mexico]]. It is the primary language of 87,000 to 100,000 people (1986 T. C. Smith-Stark).

==Geographic distribution and variation==
Core signing populations are found in [[Mexico City]], [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]] and [[Monterrey]], with a number of smaller cities containing signing communities. Some regional variation is found (80%-90% lexical similarity across the country according to Faurot et al. 2001).

Variation is high between age group and people of completely different religious backgrounds.

=={{anchor|Signed Spanish}}Relationship of LSM to Spanish==
[[File:Red de museos para la atencion a personas con discapacidad.webm|thumb|Public service announcement with Mexican sign language interpretation]]
LSM is quite distinct from [[Spanish language|Spanish]], with completely different verb inflections, different discourse structure and preferences for [[word order]], and little use of the verb [[to be]]. However, there is extensive use of [[initialised signs]] with one study finding 37% of a 100-word list are initialised, compared to 14% for American Sign Language (Faurot et al. 2001). The same authors suggest that the Deaf community's comprehension of the Spanish language is very low.

The term "[[Signed Spanish]]” refers to signing that uses LSM signs ([[lexicon]]) in a Spanish word order, with some representations of Spanish morphology. There is a group of suffixes that signed Spanish uses in a way similar to that of [[signed English]], e.g. signed symbols for -dor and -ción (for nouns). Articles and pronouns are fingerspelled. Signed Spanish (or [[contact sign|Pidgin Signed Spanish]]) is often used by interpreters and during public reading or song-leading. Signed Spanish is also used by some hard of hearing and late deafened people.

==Relationship to other sign languages==
LSM is widely believed by the deaf community to have derived from [[Old French Sign Language]] (OFSL), which combined with pre-existing local sign languages and [[home sign]] systems when deaf schools were first established in 1869. However, it is mutually unintelligible with American Sign Language, which emerged from OFSL 50 years earlier in the US, although the [[American manual alphabet]] is almost identical to the Mexican one. [[Spanish Sign Language]] used in Spain is different from Mexican Sign Language, though LSM may have been influenced by it.

==Status==
In 2005, Mexican Sign Language was officially declared a "national language", along with Spanish and indigenous languages, to be used in the national education system for the deaf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsia.uv.mx/bolsadetrabajo/documentos/LEY-GENERAL-PERSONAS-CON-DISCAPACIDAD.pd Ley general - Personas con discapacidad]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before 2005, the major educational philosophy in the country focused on [[oralism]] (speech and lipreading) and with few schools that conducted classes in LSM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-01.sil.org/mexico/lenguajes-de-signos/G009i-Identity-mfs.pdf The identity of Mexican sign as a language] p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

A 5-minute signed segment of a nightly television news program was broadcast in [[Signed Spanish]] in the mid 1980s, then again in the early 1990s, discontinued in 1992, and resumed as a 2-minute summary of headlines in 1997.

==Alternate names==
* Seña Español ("Spanish Sign" - LSM is widely known by this name among the Deaf Community in Mexico, although the language is unrelated to Spanish)
* Lenguaje de señas mexicano
* Lenguaje de las Manos
* Lenguaje Manual Mexicano

'''Mind the Gaps''' is a state-level legislative campaign created by the Connecticut-based education advocacy organization [[ConnCAN]]. The stated goal of the campaign is to support "three commonsense school reforms—funding to grow high-performing public charter schools, teacher quality and education transparency—to help close Connecticut’s achievement gap."

The campaign was launched on February 5, 2009 alongside the website www.PleaseMindtheGaps.org. In its first official release, it uncovered budget gaps that it claimed would result in the loss of 695 seats for students in the state's charter schools. The website includes details of the policy agenda, a blog and a video produced by Kevin Munn featuring the principals of Elm City College Prep in [[New Haven, CT]] and Macdonough School in [[Middletown, CT]].

Both the campaign name and logo reference the famous phrase [[Mind the Gap]] from the [[London Underground]] rapid transit system.

[[ConnCAN]] (Connecticut Coalition for Achievement Now) is an [[United States|American]] [[think tank]] and state-level education [[advocacy group]] founded in January 2005, with offices in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] and [[New Haven, Connecticut]].

Among the 48 board and advisory board members are [[Richard C. Levin]], president of [[Yale University]], Allan Taylor, chair of the Connecticut State Board of Education, and [[Ron Howard]], Co-Chairman of [[Imagine Entertainment]].

On November 28, 2016, a terrorist [[Vehicle-ramming attack|vehicle-ramming]] and [[Stabbing as a terrorist tactic|stabbing attack]] occurred at 9:52{{nbsp}}a.m. EST at [[Ohio State University|Ohio State University's]] [[Watts Hall]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. The attacker, [[Somalia|Somali]] refugee Abdul Razak Ali Artan, was shot and killed by the first responding OSU police officer, and 13 people were hospitalized for injuries.

Authorities began investigating the possibility of the attack being an act of terrorism. On the next day, law enforcement officials stated that Artan was inspired by terrorist propaganda from the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) and the late radical Muslim cleric [[Anwar al-Awlaki]]. [[Amaq News Agency]] released a statement claiming the attacker responded to an ISIL call to attack [[Military intervention against ISIL#International coalitions against ISIL|coalition]] citizens, though there is no evidence of direct contact between the group and Artan.

There had been high concerns from federal law enforcement officials about [[Car ramming attack|car ramming]] and [[stabbing]] attacks being encouraged by online extremist propaganda due to the relative ease of committing them compared to bombings.&lt;ref name="CBS.Known"/&gt; In the weeks prior to the incident, ISIL had been urging its followers to copy [[2016 Nice attack|a car ramming attack]] in [[Nice]], France, that killed 86 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abc7chicago.com/news/officials-investigating-anti-us-facebook-rant-believed-linked-to-osu-attacker/1629153/|title=Officials Investigating Anti-US Facebook Rant Believed Linked to OSU Attacker|publisher=WLS-TV|date=November 28, 2016|accessdate=November 28, 2016|quote=The attack comes as the ISIS terror group has been urging its followers in recent weeks to copy the vehicle attack that took place in Nice, France, when 84 people were killed by a terrorist driving a semi-truck through a Bastille Day celebration.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier that year in February, a man [[2016 Ohio machete attack|attacked patrons at the Nazareth Restaurant]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], wounding four before being shot and killed by responding police officers. About seven months later, [[2016 Minnesota mall stabbing|a mass stabbing]] occurred at the [[Crossroads Center (St. Cloud, Minnesota)|Crossroads Center]] shopping mall in [[St. Cloud, Minnesota]]. During the attack, a Somali refugee stabbed and injured nearly a dozen people before also being fatally shot by police.

In the week prior to the attack, the perpetrator, [[#Perpetrator|Abdul Razak Ali Artan]], traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]], and purchased a knife at a [[The Home Depot|Home Depot]] there. The day before the attack, Artan bought a second knife at a [[Walmart]] in Columbus. Investigators have not determined whether either knife was used in the attack, but were particularly suspicious of Artan traveling to the U.S. capital, roughly {{convert|400|mi}} from Columbus by car, to buy a knife.&lt;ref name="NBC.Bought"/&gt;

In August, on his first day at OSU, Artan was interviewed by ''[[The Lantern]]'', the school newspaper. In the interview, he said that he was having trouble finding a place to pray in comparison to his old school at Columbus State, which provided private prayer rooms. However, he was apparently unaware of a prayer space provided in the OSU student union. Artan added that he was scared about other people's opinions of him because of what he perceived to be negative portrayal of Muslims in the media, and criticized the then Presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]] for not being "educated on Islam".&lt;ref name="CBS.Known"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes.Path"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time.Know"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Humans of Ohio State |first=Kevin |last=Stankiewicz |publisher=''[[The Lantern]]'' |via=[[issuu]] |date=October 18, 2016 |url=https://issuu.com/thelantern/docs/082516/5 |accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whio.com/news/local/ohio-state-attack-who-the-suspect/xTzV8374LqMo6wvsdOZ2LL/|title=OHIO STATE ATTACK: Who is the suspect?|publisher=WHIO|date=November 28, 2016|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interview, Artan expressed fear about Donald Trump’s rhetoric toward Muslims, and what it might mean for immigrants and refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/11/30/i-interviewed-the-ohio-state-attacker-on-the-first-day-of-school-it-felt-important-now-its-chilling/|title=

== Investigation ==
The FBI's [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]] and the ATF became involved in the investigation.&lt;ref name="NYTimes.Alert"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/public/2016/osu-attack/isis-claims-responsibility-for-ohio-state-attack.html|title=ISIS claims credit for inspiring attack at Ohio State that injured 11|work=The Columbus Dispatch|date=November 29, 2016|accessdate=November 29, 2016|first1=Earl|last1=Rinehart|first2=Beth|last2=Burger|quote=The case is being investigated as a potential terrorist act by the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force, which includes Columbus police, Columbus police spokesman Rich Weiner said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation is ongoing; police have not ruled out terrorism as a motive as of November 28.&lt;ref name="GrayAttacker"/&gt;

Per university policy, Alan Horujko, the campus officer who shot and killed Artan, was placed on administrative leave. Columbus police began investigating the officer-involved shooting.&lt;ref name="WYKC.Released"/&gt;

Though two people were taken into custody in the immediate aftermath of the attack,&lt;ref name="DDN.Search"/&gt; Artan was ultimately believed by police to have acted alone.&lt;ref name="CBF.Identified"/&gt; His apartment was searched by the FBI and a Franklin County Sheriff's Office bomb squad.&lt;ref name="Dispatch.Suspect"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2016/11/fbi_searching_house_of_suspect.html |title=FBI searches house of suspect in Ohio State campus attack |publisher=[[Cleveland.com]] |date=November 28, 2016 |accessdate=November 28, 2016 |first=Adam |last=Ferrise |quote=Dozens of FBI agents showed up at the apartment of Abdul Razak Ali Artan about 7 p.m. Monday.

On November 30, the FBI appealed to the public for assistance in filling in an unaccounted time gap between Artan's purchase of a knife on the morning of the attack and the attack itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/30/us/ohio-state-university-attack/|title=Ohio State University attack investigation: FBI asks public for help|work=CNN|date=November 30, 2016|accessdate=December 2, 2016|first=Catherine E.|last=Shoichet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI began a search into Artan's digital history to see if he had contact with suspected terrorists or had access to terrorist propaganda.&lt;ref name="FOX.Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/28/fbi-investigates-possible-facebook-declaration-by-osu-attack-suspect.html|title=FBI investigates possible Facebook 'declaration' by OSU attack suspect|publisher=Fox News|date=November 28, 2016|accessdate=November 28, 2016|quote=Law enforcement sources told Fox News that the FBI is combing through Artan’s digital history and devices to see if he had contact with any suspected terrorists and for any traces of terrorist propaganda.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artan had not been known to the FBI as a potential threat prior to the attack.&lt;ref name="GlobalNews.Hails"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yahoo.Inspired"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/ohio-state-attacker-may-inspired-overseas-militants-fbi-185743642.html|title=Ohio State attacker may have been inspired by overseas militants: FBI|publisher=Yahoo!

On the day after the attack, two law enforcement sources confirmed investigators' beliefs that Artan was inspired by terrorist propaganda from ISIL and al-Awlaki, citing Artan's Facebook post and the method used to carry out the attack. The sources added that Artan has currently not been found to have any communication with terror groups, and that the attack appears to be an act of a [[lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf]].&lt;ref name="CNN.Inspired"/&gt; These sources were confirmed by an FBI official on November 30.&lt;ref name="Yahoo.Inspired"/&gt; Other law enforcement officials said that Artan may have been motivated by exposure to a "mix of radical messages" from both ISIL and [[Al-Qaeda]], much like the perpetrators of [[2015 San Bernardino attack|the San Bernardino attack]] in December 2015, and the September 2016 [[2016 New York and New Jersey bombings|bombings and bombing attempts in New York and New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ohio-state-university-attack-abdul-razak-ali-arta-may-have-come-out-of-the-blue/|title=Ohio State attacker may have been inspired by radical messages|work=CBS News|date=November 28, 2016|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 30, a senior official of the FBI's Cincinnati division claimed it was "too early to speculate on the extent of" Artan's involvement with ISIL.&lt;ref name="ColumbusDispatch.Sorting"/&gt;

Despite ISIL's claim of responsibility for the attack (see [[#Reactions|below]]), it was reported that no evidence has emerged to suggest the terrorist organization's foreknowledge of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/details-emerge-ohio-state-community-make-sense-attack/story?id=43864565|title=Details Emerge as Ohio State Community Tries to Make Sense of Attack|work=ABC News|date=November 30, 2016|accessdate=November 30, 2016|first1=Brian|last1=Ross|first2=Mike|last2=Levine|quote=While ISIS has repeatedly called on its followers to conduct attacks in the U.S., no evidence has emerged publicly to suggest ISIS had foreknowledge of the OSU plot.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drake]] said that he met with Alan Horujko and thanked him for "following his training and being able to neutralize the circumstance within roughly one minute".&lt;ref name="Lantern.Recap"/&gt; He also credited the school's [[active shooter]] training and campus alert system for maintaining order while police secured the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cltv.com/2016/11/29/ohio-state-suspect-abdul-razak-ali-artan-posted-facebook-rant-before-attack/|title=Ohio State suspect Abdul Razak Ali Artan posted Facebook rant before attack|work=Chicagoland Television|date=November 29, 2016|accessdate=December 2, 2016|quote=Ohio State President Dr. Michael V.

At around 10:00{{nbsp}}p.m. on November 28, OSU students and employees gathered in front of a church located near the scene of the attack, to pray for the injured.&lt;ref name="WWL.Timeline"/&gt; On November 30, two days after the attack, more than 500 students, employees, and community members attended the "#BuckeyeStrong" event at [[St. John Arena]]. Drake spoke at the event, praising the heroic acts of the school community in the immediate aftermath of the attack, as well as the work of the first responders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osu.edu/features/2016/moving-forward-staying-buckeye-strong.html|title=Moving forward.

On December 1, Stephanie Clemons Thompson, assistant director of student life at OSU, made a [[Facebook]] post calling for compassion to be directed at Artan and hashtagging #BuckeyeStrong #BlackLivesMatter #SayHisName. The post received condemnation on social media for defending a person who attempted to kill others, for implying that Artan's death was wrong, and for comparing a terrorist who targeted his fellow students with victims of police brutality. A [[Change.org]] petition calling for Thompson's termination from OSU received over 1,200 signatures. An OSU spokesman said that the post "clearly is not an official statement of the university and represents her own personal viewpoint."  Some people have defended Thompson for writing the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/12/01/a-school-official-called-for-compassion-for-the-ohio-state-attacker-people-are-demanding-she-be-fired/|title=A school official called for compassion for the Ohio State attacker.

=== Politicians ===
Governor [[John Kasich]] [[tweeted]] his condolences to the school community and urged people to "listen to first responders".&lt;ref name="NYTimes.Alert"/&gt; He later praised the "professional, coordinated response" of first responders in another official statement.&lt;ref name="WABC.Campus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc7ny.com/news/ohio-state-student-drives-into-crowd-stabs-people-on-campus/1628709/|title=Ohio State Student Drives Into Crowd, Stabs People on Campus|publisher=WABC-TV|date=November 28, 2016|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor [[Andrew Ginther]] said that he met with several of the injured, and also declared the city's solidarity with OSU and praised the actions of Alan Horujko and other law enforcement officers.&lt;ref name="DDN.Search"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbc4i.com/2016/11/28/active-shooter-reported-at-osu-campus/|title=Officer who stopped Ohio State stabbing attack identified, 11 people hospitalized|publisher=NBC4I|date=November 28, 2016|accessdate=November 28, 2016|quote='I have personally met with several of the victims this afternoon, and I am pleased to report that their spirits are good and they are receiving the best of care.

Vice President-elect [[Mike Pence]] called the attack "tragic" and expressed his condolences.&lt;ref name="AP.Suspected"/&gt; In a [[Facebook]] post, [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[Donald Trump]] thanked the [[first responder]]s present at the scene of the attack for "react[ing] immediately and eliminat[ing] the threat on campus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Allan|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-responds-ohio-state-2016-11|title=Trump responds to Ohio State attack, thanks first responders|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=November 28, 2016|accessdate=November 28, 2016|quote=President-elect Donald Trump on Monday responded to an attack at Ohio State University in a Facebook post, thanking first responders for quickly eliminating 'the threat on campus.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later tweeted that Artan "should not have been in our country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-tweets-about-ohio-state-university-stabbing-attack/|title=Donald Trump tweets about Ohio State University stabbing attack|work=CBS News|date=November 30, 2016|accessdate=November 30, 2016|quote=President-elect Donald Trump weighed in on the Ohio State University attack in a tweet early Wednesday morning, claiming that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) was 'taking credit' for the attack. The tweet also claimed that the suspect, a Somali refugee, 'should not have been in our country.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muslim and Somali-American reaction ===
The attack was condemned by several leaders of Muslim organizations and mosques in the Columbus and Greater Detroit area.&lt;ref name="AP.Suspected"/&gt; Imad Hamad, Executive Director of the American Human Rights Council, released a statement denouncing the assault and cautioned against scapegoating the wider Muslim community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AHRC condemns heinous Ohio State University attack|url=http://thearabdailynews.com/2016/11/30/ahrc-condemns-heinous-ohio-state-university-attack/|publisher=Arab News Daily|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omar Hassan, president of the Somali Community Association of Ohio, likewise expressed shock at the attack, and asserted that the community put a great amount of effort into preventing radicalization. The leader of the mosque that Artan frequented also indicated that while he was not familiar with him, the mosque had numerous programs dedicated to helping youth and preventing self-radicalization.&lt;ref name="WWL.Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwltv.com/news/local/updates-classes-to-resume-at-ohio-state-on-tuesday/356923983|title=Timeline of Ohio State University attacks|work=WWL-TV|date=November 30, 2016|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After-effects ===
Colleges across the U.S. began revisiting their emergency response plans as a result of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/ohio-state-attack-prompts-colleges-to-review-emergency-response-plans-1480605230|title=Ohio State Attack Prompts Colleges to Review Emergency-Response Plans|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=December 1, 2016|accessdate=December 1, 2016|first1=Melissa|last1=Korn|first2=Kris|last2=Maher|first3=Douglas|last3=Belkin|quote=Colleges nationwide are revisiting their emergency-response plans in the wake of the attack on the Ohio State University campus Monday that left 11 injured and the attacker dead.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack prompted calls to allow firearms on campuses in Ohio. [[Ohio House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Ron Maag]] made a proposal for the expansion of "[[concealed carry]] locations". The proposal downgraded the felony charge of illegally bringing a gun on campus to a misdemeanor, and gave universities the option to allow concealed firearms on their campuses. The proposal was met with a mixed response, with proponents saying that students would feel safer with access to concealed firearms, and opponents arguing that the expansion of concealed carry locations is unnecessary and could even complicate law enforcement response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2016/11/30/after-osu-attack-should-ohio-allow-concealed-carry-campus/94640798/|title=After OSU attack, should Ohio allow concealed carry on campus?|work=Cincinnati.com|date=November 30, 2016|accessdate=November 30, 2016|first=Jessie|last=Balmert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcpo.com/news/state/state-ohio/in-wake-of-osu-attack-should-guns-be-allowed-on-university-campuses-|title=In wake of OSU attack, should guns be allowed on university campuses?|work=WCPO|date=November 29, 2016|accessdate=November 30, 2016|first=Liam|last=Niemeyer|quote=In the aftermath of an attack on Ohio State University’s campus, a bill could be passed in the Ohio Senate that would reduce the penalty from a felony to a misdemeanor for having a gun on a university campus. All university-mandated rules prohibiting guns on campus would continue to remain in effect if the bill becomes law, but universities would now have the choice as to whether to keep those mandated rules.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the OSU attack and [[Orlando nightclub shooting|a mass shooting at a gay nightclub]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], in which at least one victim bled to death, a new federal initiative was launched. It was designed to train people working at schools and other public places on how to treat injuries before paramedics arrive at the scene. Doctors have emphasized the importance for school faculty members to stay calm and assess injuries, but also discouraged the use of more invasive emergency procedures such as removing a bullet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ohio-state-university-attack-need-training-ordinary-people-save-lives/|title=Ohio State University attack highlights need for training ordinary people to save lives|publisher=CBS News|agency=Associated Press|date=November 30, 2016|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ISIL claim of responsibility ===
[[Amaq News Agency]], a purported ISIL mouthpiece, released a statement calling Artan a "soldier of the Islamic State" who "carried out the operation in response to calls to target citizens of international coalition countries."&lt;ref name="GlobalNews.Hails"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC.Know"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DesantisISIS"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Desantis|first1=Candace Goforth|last2=Brown|first2=Stephen Rex|title=ISIS takes responsibility for Ohio State attack, proclaims Abdul Artan a 'soldier'|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ohio-state-attacker-ranted-muslim-sleeper-cell-article-1.2891401|accessdate=November 29, 2016|publisher=The New York Daily News|date=November 29, 2016|quote=The Somali-born Ohio State student who rammed his car into a crowd before attacking them with a butcher knife was an ISIS 'soldier,' the terrorist group proclaimed Tuesday.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HellmanISIS"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hellman|first1=Jesse|title=ISIS claims responsibility for Ohio State attack|url=http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/307907-isis-claims-responsibility-for-ohio-state-university-attack|accessdate=November 29, 2016|quote=The terror group's Amaq News Agency on Tuesday claimed the attack, carried out by an 18-year-old Ohio State student, was perpetrated by a 'soldier of the Islamic State.'|publisher=The Hill|date=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political dynasties''' have long been a feature of the [[Politics of the Philippines|Philippine political landscape]]. They are typically characterized as families that have established their political or economic dominance in a province and have coordinated efforts to move on to involvement in national government or other positions of national political prominence. Political dynasties usually have a strong, consolidated support base concentrated around the province in which they are dominant. Members of such dynasties usually do not limit their involvement to strictly political activities, and have been found participating in business or culture-related activities."

Political dynasties started emerging after the [[Philippine Revolution]] when the [[First Philippine Republic|First Republic of the Philippines]] was established. With the decline of Spain's economic power and international prestige in the 19th century, the expansion of British and American influence around the world, and the political current of [[Filipino nationalism|emergent nationalism]] among the children of the economically enfranchised bourgeois, the power of the [[peninsulares]]', or Spanish-born aristocracy declined propitiously.  Following the defeat of the Spanish in the Spanish–American War, the surviving members of the [[Principalia|Spanish or Spanish-sanctioned landholding elite]] and the newly ascendant merchant elite, who were mostly foreign expatriates or of [[Sangley|Chinese origin]], formed a de facto aristocracy to replace the power vacuum the Spanish had left.

Aristocracy survived and prospered under the American colonial regime, and remained a permanent fixture in Philippine society even following the independence of the Philippines was finally confirmed following the devastation of the Philippines under the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]] during World War II. Over the years, political dynasties continued to adapt, as newer dynasties emerged to fill power vacuums left behind by the extinction of older dynasties. The majority of the available positions in Philippine government are currently held by members of these political dynasties. Notable Philippine political dynasties include the Aquino, Marcos, Arroyo, Binay, Duterte, and Roxas families." 
There has been a lot of debate regarding the effects political dynasties have on the political and economic status of Philippine society. Despite the negative reaction of the populace towards political dynasties and the association between dynastic activities and corruption,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; it is only prohibited in the members of the youth-oriented [[Sangguniang Kabataan]].

== Definition ==
Political dynasties refer to family units with members involved in government activities. In the Philippines, 
political dynasties refer to groups of politicians who come from the same family. The group in question is usually associated with a certain province or city, which members of the family have led or represented for successive generations. This can occur in two ways. One way is for members of a family to occupy a same certain government position in every term. Once the term of the member of a political dynasty runs out, a relative of the incumbent will run in his stead, thus ensuring political dominance. The second way is for a number of family members to occupy government positions at the same time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nscb.gov.ph/ncs/12thncs/papers/INVITED/IPS-11%20Governance%20Statistics/IPS-11_1%20Political%20Dynasties%20and%20Poverty_Evidence%20from%20the%20Philippines.pdf|title = POLITICAL DYNASTIES AND POVERTY: EVIDENCE FROM THE PHILIPPINES|last = Mendoza|first = Ronald U.|date = October 1, 2013|journal = 12th National Convention on Statistics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the moment, there are no legal documents or laws that officially define a political dynasty in the Philippines. There have been bills that attempt to define a political dynasty such as the Anti-Dynasty Bill.  However, such attempt usually miscarry and end in failure, as proven by the defeat of the Anti-Dynasty Bill in Philippine Congress on February 2, 2016.

== Philippine laws ==
The 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines]] states in Article II Section 26: ''"The State shall guarantee equal access to opportunities for public service, and prohibit political dynasties as may be defined by law."''

Despite the provision in the Constitution, only the [[Sangguniang Kabataan]] Reform Act of 2016 is the only statute that has been implemented concerning the status of political dynasties in the Philippines. The closest explicit mention of political dynasties in Philippine law can be seen in Republic Act 7160 or the Local Government Code, where Book I, Title Two, Chapter 1, Section 43 states the term limit of local government officials.  However, it does not include any limitations on the running of the incumbent's family relations or on the holding of multiple political positions by members of the same family.

{{Quote|text=(a) The term of office of all local elective officials elected after the effectivity of this Code shall be three (3) years, starting from noon of June 30, 1992 or such date as may be provided for by law, except that of elective Barangay officials: Provided, That all local officials first elected during the local elections immediately following the ratification of the 1987 Constitution shall serve until noon of June 30, 1992.
(b) No local elective official shall serve for more than three (3) consecutive terms in the same position. Voluntary renunciation of the office for any length of time shall not be considered as an interruption in the continuity of service for the full term for which the elective official concerned was elected.
(c) The term of office of Barangay officials and members of the Sangguniang kabataan shall be for three (3) years, which shall begin after the regular election of Barangay officials on the second Monday of May 1994.}}

Several bills have been filed in relation to the prohibition of political dynasties, and are currently pending to be approved by the Congress. Many have called for the Congress to pass the Anti-Dynasty Law, but this bill has been passed over by each Congress since 1987.

On January 24, 2011, Senator [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]] filed [http://www.senate.gov.ph/lisdata/106169091!.pdf Senate Bill 2649] which prohibits political dynasties from holding or running for elected local government positions. The bill disqualifies the following candidates from running for local government positions:
* relatives of an incumbent elected official running for re-election up to the second degree of consanguinity, and are planning to run in the same province in the same election as the elected official
* relatives of an incumbent elected official that holds a national position up to the second degree of consanguinity, and are planning to run in the province of origin of the elected official
* persons that are not relatives of an elected official that are candidates to the same position in the same province in the same election but are related to each other up to the second degree of consanguinity.
The bill also prohibits relatives within the prohibited civil degree of relationship of an incumbent from succeeding to the incumbent's position, except for the positions of [[Punong Barangay]] and [[Sangguniang Barangay]].

Three bills were filed in the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] which are also in relation to the prohibition of political dynasties, which are similar in content to Senate Bill 2649:
# House Bill 172 filed on July 1, 2013, by representatives under the [[Bayan Muna]], [[GABRIELA Women's Party|Gabriela]], [[Alliance of Concerned Teachers|ACT]], [[Anakpawis]] and Kabataan party lists. 
# House Bill 837 filed on July 2, 2013, by Representative Erlinda Santiago of the 1-SAGIP party list.
# House Bill 2911 filed on September 18, 2013, by Representative Oscar Rodriguez from the [[Legislative districts of Pampanga#3rd District|3rd district of Pampanga]].

On December 16, 2013, the House of Representatives Committee on Suffrage and Electoral Reforms agreed to replace the three House bills into a single bill filed as [http://congress.gov.ph/download/basic_16/HB03587.pdf House Bill 3587].

In 2016, the Sangguniang Kabataan Reform Law (Republic Act No. 10742) was signed into law which made some significant changes to the [[Sangguniang Kabataan]] (SK).&lt;ref name=PanayNews2016 /&gt;  It changed the age of the council from 15 to 17 years old to 18 to 24 years old and it forbids individuals from seeking a youth council appointment who are closer than the second degree of [[consanguinity]] (have the same grandparents) from any elected or appointed official in the same area. &lt;ref name=PanayNews2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=GOLEZ|first1=PRINCE|title=Aquino signs SK reform bill|url=http://panaynewsphilippines.com/2016/01/20/aquino-signs-sk-reform-bill/|accessdate=23 January 2016|publisher=Panay News|date=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the first Philippine law with an anti-[[political dynasty]] restriction for elected positions, as permitted by the 1987 [[Philippine Constitution]].&lt;ref name=MSN2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Musico|first1=Jelly F.|last2=Reyes|first2=Ernie|title=Newly signed SK Reform Law bars gov’t officials’ relatives from running|url=http://www.msn.com/en-ph/news/national/newly-signed-sk-reform-law-bars-gov%E2%80%99t-officials%E2%80%99-relatives-from-running/ar-BBorBiT|accessdate=23 January 2016|agency=Philippines News Agency and InterAksyon.com|publisher=MSN.com|date=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistics of Philippine political dynasties ==
Due to the increasing number of political dynasties in the Philippines, majority of the positions in government are held by politicians that are members of political dynasties. In fact, in the years 1995-2007, an average of 31.3% of all congressmen and 23.1% of governors were replaced by relatives. In the 1995 elections, of the 83 congressmen elected on to their third term, 36 of them were replaced by a relative in the succeeding elections. The term "relative" here referring to anyone with a familial connection such as a wife, a son or daughter, a cousin, etc. In many of these cases, the people who would eventually go on to take their place had no previous political background or experience save their familial connection.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An Empirical Analysis of Political Dynasties in the 15th Philippine Congress|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228276641_An_Empirical_Analysis_of_Political_Dynasties_in_the_15th_Philippine_Congress|journal = |doi = 10.2139/ssrn.1969605|first = Ronald U.|last = Mendoza|first2 = Edsel L.|last2 = Beja|first3 = Victor Soriano|last3 = Venida|first4 = David|last4 = Yap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study done in 2012 by economists Beja, Mendoza, Venida, and Yap, it was estimated that 40% of all provinces in the Philippines have a provincial governor and congressman that are related in some way.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another 2014 study done by Querubin of the Department of Politics in New York University indicated that an estimate 50-70% of all politicians are involved or associated in a political dynasty within the Philippines, including local government units. In the same study, it was concluded that approximately 70% of all jurisdiction-based legislators in the current Congress are involved in a political dynasty, with 40% of them having ties to legislators who belonged to as far as 3 Congresses prior. It is also said that 77% of legislators between the ages of 26-40 are also dynastic, which indicates that the second and third generations of political dynasties in the Philippines have begun their political careers as well.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Political Reform and Elite Persistence: Term Limits and Political Dynasties in the Philippines|ssrn = 2108036|date = 2012-01-01|location = Rochester, NY|first = Pablo|last = Querubin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to analyze patterns of political dynasties within the 15th Congress, categories were formed according to the number of familial ties each politician had to politicians belonging to previous Congresses:

''Category 1:'' Those with ties to the 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th Congress as well as at least one family member elected into a local government unit between the years 2001 and 2010

''Category 2:'' Those with familial connections to at least one person belonging to the 12th, 13th, or 14th Congress

''Category 3:'' Those who share kinship with at least one person belonging to the 12th, 13th, or 14th dynasty, or at least one relative with a [[Local government unit|local government unit (LGU)]] position from the 2001, 2004, or 2007 elections

''Category 4:'' Those with at least one relation in the 12th, 13th, or 14th Congress or holding a local government unit (LGU) position in the elections in between 2001 and 2010

In a population of 229 legislators in the 15th Congress, 155 of them are classified as belonging to the fourth category. Of those 155, 144 of them also belong to the third category. 84 of the 144 belong in the second category, and of the 84, 10 belong to the first category.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Critical reception ==
Various writers wrote articles that analyze and critique politicians that fall under the domain of a political dynasty. Often, these articles hold these said persons and families in a critical light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ‘It Runs In The Family’ The Making Of Political Dynasties In The Philippines {{!}} University of the Philippines System Website|url = http://www.up.edu.ph/it-runs-in-the-family-the-making-of-political-dynasties-in-the-philippines/|website = www.up.edu.ph|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although political dynasties have already been present in the Philippines for a significant period of time, the public has only recently started clamoring for a change in system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is wrong with political dynasties?|url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/276345/opinion/what-is-wrong-with-political-dynasties|website = GMA News Online|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public support for the bill against political dynasties has steadily increased because the president, while part of a dynasty himself, fully supports the passage of the Anti-Dynasty Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SONA 2015: President Aquino calls for passage of anti-dynasty law|url = http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2015/07/27/aquino-anti-dynasty-law-2015.html|website = cnn|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a provincial scale, political dynasties are often held in higher regard- contrasted with dynasties that oversee a wider public, where reception is mostly negative. A study that used empirical data correlated political dynasty presence with socio-economic development. This study stated that "this partial correlation coefficient finds a positive relationship between poverty incidence and the proportion of political dynasties in each province." Although the study found a correlation, this does not determine whether it is a causal relationship since poverty is multifaceted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Inequality in democracy: Insights from an empirical analysis of political dynasties in the 15th Philippine Congress|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01154451.2012.734094|journal = Philippine Political Science Journal|date = 2012-12-01|issn = 0115-4451|pages = 132–145|volume = 33|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/01154451.2012.734094|first = Ronald U.|last = Mendoza|first2 = Edsel L.

== Influence ==

=== Negative ===
One of the more notable theories concerning the negative effects of political dynasties is a political "Carnegie Effect", named after [[Andrew Carnegie]]. The "Carnegie Effect" is based on Carnegie's decision to give all his wealth to non-family members, where he argues that his son might have less incentive of working hard if he were to be assured of his father's wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Family Firms Need Professional Management|url = https://hbr.org/2011/03/family-firms-need-professional|website = Harvard Business Review|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of inherited wealth and connections discouraging future generations to work hard can also be attributed to dynastic politicians. Dynastic politicians have a significant advantage from the start of their political career They have a statistically higher probability, due to factors like popularity and incumbency advantage, to win elections when pitted against politicians with no such political networks. Dynastic politicians also have generally lower educational attainment, because of their reliance on dynastic connections rather than bureaucratic or academic competence for their position.&lt;ref&gt;Daniele, Gianmarco, and Benny Geys. "Born in the Purple: Political Dynasties and Politicians' Human Capital." June 1, 2014. Accessed September 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also significant evidence to suggest that Philippine political dynasties use their political dominance over their respective regions to enrich themselves, using methods such as graft or outright bribery of legislators. These kinds of situations arise as conflicts of interests- political dynasties often hold significant economic power in a province- and their interests are overrepresented due to dynastic politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is wrong with political dynasties?|url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/276345/opinion/what-is-wrong-with-political-dynasties|website = GMA News Online|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another negative effect of political dynasties is that political dynasties tend to be for the status quo and develop interests largely separate from the people they were supposed to be serving.  Dynastic candidates, being almost exclusively from the upper classes, are naturally biased towards defending their own vested economic interests, which presents conflict of interest problems. Political dynasties also prevent challengers with potentially effective policy ideas from being able to take office, which limits the capacity for bureaucratic responsiveness and administrative effectiveness and adaptation to new ideas.

=== Positive ===
Political dynasties also have extra incentive to develop their own jurisdictions. Based on Mancur Olson's theory of political governance or the "Roving Bandits vs. Stationary Bandits" theory, dynastic politicians are more likely to pursue long-term development oriented strategies since they expect to hold power and benefit from their position for longer. This is usually set in contrast to non-dynastic politicians who would, under this theory, have less incentive to develop due to their limited term. Political dynasties can gain benefits either directly or indirectly through their relatives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = BusinessWorld {{!}} Family affairs: The two faces of political dynasties|url = http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=&amp;title=Family-affairs:-The-two-faces-of-political-dynasties-&amp;id=59508|website = www.bworldonline.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political dynasties are also responsible for the increase in women's political participation in politics. Female politicians hailing from political dynasties can easily get into politics due to their connections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Political dynasties have the advantage of continuity. The more control the family has over the government unit, the more members of the family can occupy positions of power. Political dynasties can use this continuity by promoting and enacting laws and ordinances that are long term in nature; with only a slim chance of other candidates outside of the dynasty interfering with the plans.

{{See also|List of political families in the Philippines}}

=== Ampatuan ===
The Ampatuan family has exercised political crowd control over the [[Maguindanao]] region since 2001, with several of its members holding positions in government. The family's patriarch, [[Andal Ampatuan Sr.]], was elected Governor of Maguindanao in 2001. His sons, [[Andal Ampatuan Jr.]] and [[Zaldy Ampatuan]], were the former mayor of [[Datu Unsay, Maguindanao|Datu Unsay]] and former governor of ARMM respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The bloody life and times of Andal Ampatuan Sr. |url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/2015/07/18/1478340/bloody-life-and-times-andal-ampatuan-sr. |website=philstar.com |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 80 members of the Ampatuan clan ran for governmental positions during the 2013 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reporting Political Dynasties |url=http://www.cmfr-phil.org/mediaandelections/?p=1087 |website=Media and Elections |accessdate=2015-11-06 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ampatuans' rise to power is attributed to support received from former President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo|Gloria Arroyo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Making of a Massacre in the Philippines |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/world/asia/11iht-massacre.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2009-12-10 |access-date=2015-11-06 |issn=0362-4331 |first=Carlos H. |last=Conde}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of their connection, the Ampatuans won Arroyo a large majority of votes from Maguindanao during the 2004 presidential elections. The Arroyo administration's issuance of Executive Order 546 then allowed the Ampatuans to form their own private army, also known as civilian volunteer organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Amid the fighting, the clan rules in Maguindanao {{!}} Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism |url=http://pcij.org/stories/amid-the-fighting-the-clan-rules-in-maguindanao/ |website=pcij.org |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their prominence in Maguindanao, the Ampatuans were generally unheard of outside of the region until the infamous 2009 [[Maguindanao massacre|Maguindanao Massacre]]. They are considered the main suspects behind the massacre that killed 57 people. The victims had been on their way to file the candidacy of [[Esmael Mangudadatu|Esmael "Toto" Mangudadatu]] for the 2010 elections when they were stopped by an armed convoy. They were later abducted and murdered; some victims were also reported to have been raped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Five Years After Maguindanao |url=http://time.com/3598796/its-been-five-years-since-the-maguindanao-massacre-and-the-perpetrators-are-still-free/ |website=TIME.com |accessdate=2015-11-06 |first=Emily |last=Rauhala}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Behind the Philippines' Maguindanao Massacre |url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1943191,00.html |newspaper=Time |date=2009-11-27 |access-date=2015-11-06 |issn=0040-781X |first=Alastair |last=McIndoe}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the discovery of the mass graves, President Arroyo declared martial law in Maguindanao.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arroyo declares martial law in Maguindanao province |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/178575/news/nation/arroyo-declares-martial-law-in-maguindanao-province |website=GMA News Online |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 198 people, including Andal Ampatuan Sr. and Andal Ampatuan Jr., were charged with murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DOJ probes 50 new suspects in Maguindanao Massacre |url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/87148-doj-new-suspects-maguindanao-massacre |website=Rappler |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charges against some of the suspects have been dropped in the years since. Andal Ampatuan Sr., suspected to be the mastermind behind the [[Maguindanao massacre|massacre]], died on July 17, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maguindanao massacre suspect Ampatuan Sr dead |url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/99713-maguindanao-massacre-suspect-andal-ampatuan-sr-dead |website=Rappler |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial remains ongoing today.

=== Aquino ===
The Aquinos are a political family that originated from [[Tarlac]]. The dynasty began with [[Servillano Aquino]], a general during the Philippine Revolution and delegate of the Malolos Congress. His son, [[Benigno Aquino, Sr.|Benigno "Igno" Aquino, Sr.]], was a Speaker in the House of Representatives during the Second Philippine Republic. He was charged and arrested for collaborating with the Japanese during World War II. Nowadays, the Aquinos are oftentimes viewed as opponents of the Marcos family, mainly due to the actions of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino, Jr.]] A former governor of Tarlac who has his critical views against the Marcoses resulting to a family-political feud. He was imprisoned and was sentenced to death but was pardoned and exiled to the US by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] for his recovery after suffering from heart attack. On August 21, 1983, few days upon his recovery and decision to run for presidency, he returned to the Philippines. Upon leaving the plane, Ninoy was assassinated on the tarmac in the Manila International Airport. An estimated two million Filipinos attended his funeral procession. After his death, his wife, [[Corazon Aquino]], became more active in politics. She was a key figure during the [[People Power Revolution]]. Cory later became the first female president of the Philippines after beating Ferdinand Marcos in the snap elections.  Her death in 2009 garnered widespread public support reminiscent of her husband's.
Other active politicians from the Aquino family include [[Bam Aquino|Paolo Benigno "Bam" Aquino]], the youngest ever senator in the 16th Philippine Congress.

=== Estrada ===
The Estrada political dynasty began with [[Joseph Estrada|Joseph "Erap" Ejercito Estrada]], who began as a successful film actor. The popularity Estrada gained from acting would prove to be valuable when he pursued a career in politics. He served as the mayor of San Juan from 1969 to 1986, senator from 1987 to 1992, and vice president from 1992 to 1998.  He later succeeded [[Fidel V. Ramos|Fidel]] to be the 13th President of the Philippines. During his term, Estrada's wife and First Lady, [[Loi Estrada]], served as senator. Allegations of corruption under his administration led to an impeachment trial, which was discontinued after the court voted against opening an envelope possibly containing incriminating evidence. This resulted in the four-day-long [[Second EDSA Revolution|Second People Power Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Estrada’s aborted impeachment trial haunts Senate|url = http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/117133/estrada%25E2%2580%2599s-aborted-impeachment-trial-haunts-senate|website = newsinfo.inquirer.net|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; His resignation from presidency was declared soon afterwards. Despite this, the absolute pardon given by former President Arroyo allowed Estrada to run for and eventually became the mayor of Manila in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Estrada wins: SC junks disqualification case|url = http://www.rappler.com/nation/81510-sc-estrada-disqualification-case|website = Rappler|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other members of the Estrada dynasty are still active in politics, particularly in San Juan. Among these are his sons, [[Jinggoy Estrada]] and [[JV Ejercito]], who both served as Mayor of San Juan. JV's mother, [[Guia Gomez]], is the current mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Erap: We're not a dynasty in San Juan City|url = http://www.philstar.com/nation/2015/10/02/1506355/erap-were-not-dynasty-san-juan-city|website = philstar.com|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jinggoy Estrada himself has been a member of the Senate since 2004. He is currently under trial for his alleged involvement in the multi-billion peso pork barrel scam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Will Jinggoy Estrada get out of jail?|url = http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/99672-jinggoy-estrada-out-jail|website = Rappler|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marcos ===
The Marcoses are one of the most well-known political dynasties in the Philippines. The dynasty started with [[Mariano Marcos]], a lawyer from Ilocos Norte who was a member of the House of Representatives back in 1925. [[Ilocos]] remains to be the Marcoses’ political stronghold today.

The dynasty was at its most prominent during the presidency of [[Ferdinand Marcos]], son of Mariano Marcos. Ferdinand is one of the most controversial figures in Philippine history, due to his declaration of martial law and the numerous human rights violations and rampant corruption of public funds during his rule. He and his father, Mariano Marcos, were also convicted for the murder of their political rival, Julio Nalundasan, who was killed by a sniper while brushing his teeth at his home on September 20, 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Murder most foul: Marcos' youthful exuberance | url = http://news.abs-cbn.com/blogs/opinions/09/09/15/murder-most-foul-marcos-youthful-exuberance}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferdinand Marcos supposedly declared Martial law to suppress the widespread of communism and civil strife. However, he used it to suppress dissent, and consolidate power through the ratification of a new constitution. Marcos family members also held several governmental positions during this period and were involved in the misuse of public funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The curse called 'Political Dynasty'|url = http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/ispeak/62813-curse-political-dynasty|website = Rappler|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though they were exiled as a result of the [[People Power Revolution]], the Marcos family has since regained power and is currently active in Philippine politics. [[Imelda Marcos]], wife of Ferdinand and former first lady, is currently a district representative of the second district of Ilocos Norte. Marcos’ daughter, [[Imee Marcos]], is a governor of Ilocos Norte. His son, [[Bongbong Marcos|Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr.]], was a former senator who was a candidate for vice president in the 2016 national elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bongbong Marcos running for vice president in 2016|url = http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2015/10/05/bongbong-marcos-vice-president-elections-2016-the-filipino-votes.html|website = cnn|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marcoses currently cannot set foot in any United States territory because of a contempt judgement regarding their human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Marcoses lose US appeal | url = http://globalnation.inquirer.net/54454/marcoses-lose-us-appeal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ortega===
The Ortega political clan is believed to be the Philippines' political dynasty with the longest unbroken political rule, ruling over the province of [[La Union]] for over a century.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/philippine-daily-inquirer/20130501/281539403457839&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tan===

The Tan family has been in power in Samar since the late 1990s. The Tans were initially an entrepreneurial family and they were well known in their district. They have been fielding family members in various electoral posts since Mila Tan sought a seat in the provincial board in 1998 and won.&lt;ref&gt;hhttps://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections-2013/27089-the-tans-of-samar-expanding-a-dynasty&lt;/ref&gt;


===Roxas===
The Roxas political dynasty started with [[Manuel Roxas]], the fifth president of the Philippines. Before being president, he served as the governor of Capiz (now named Roxas City). As a descendant of Antonia Róxas y Ureta, he is also related to the [[Zobel de Ayala family|Zobel de Ayalas]], a prominent business family. His son, [[Gerardo Roxas]], served as a representative of the First District of Capiz and senator. His grandson, [[Mar Roxas]], was a former senator and Department of Interior and local government secretary. He lost the vice presidency in 2010, and lost the presidency in 2016 elections.

===Duterte===
* [[Rodrigo Duterte]], president since 2016 ([[Mayor of Davao City]] 1988-1998, 2001-2010, 2013–16)
* [[Sara Duterte]], mayor since 2016 (Vice Mayor 2007-2010, [[Mayor of Davao City]] 2010-2013)
* [[Paolo Duterte]], vice mayor since 2013

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2338">The '''Raysipotra''' are a [[Muslim]] community found in the state of [[Gujarat]] in [[India]] and a province of [[Sindh]] in [[Pakistan]]. They are one of a number of communities of pastoral nomads found in the [[Banni Grasslands Reserve|Banni]] region of [[Kutch]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  Three edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 1201-1206&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==

The Raysipotra get their name from Raysojee, who belonged to the Dal Muslim community. They are a small [[Maldhari]] community found in the village of Bhirandiara in the [[Banni Grasslands Reserve|Banni]] region of [[Kutch]]. They are also found in the village of Gadhiyado. Their habitat is located in the heart of the [[Banni Grasslands Reserve|Banni]]  region, a semi-desert ecosystem. The climate is dry and hot, and pastoral lifestyle is the only option for the inhabitants. They speak [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]] with many [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] loanwords.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  Three edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 1201-1206&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==

The community has no sub-divisions, and are an endogamous community, but do marry with other [[Samma (tribe)|Samma]] . They prefer parallel cousin and cross cousin marriages.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  Three edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 1369-1373&lt;/ref&gt;

The Raysipotra are a community of [[Maldhari]] cattle breeders. They take their cattle to bazaars of [[Bhuj]]. In addition to cattle rearing, they also raise goats and buffaloes. Like other Kutchi communities, many of them have migrated to other parts of [[India]] in search of employment. They are [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s  and most follow the [[Barelvi]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  Three edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 1369-1373&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Romanians'''  in Germany, are one of the sizable communities of the [[Romanian diaspora]] in [[Western Europe]]. According to German statistical data from 2016, the number of [[Romania|Romanian]] nationals in [[Germany]] on 31 December 2015 was 452,718 (up from 94,326 in 2008).&lt;ref name="stats2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.destatis.de/DE/Publikationen/Thematisch/Bevoelkerung/MigrationIntegration/AuslaendBevoelkerung.html|title=Ausländische Bevölkerung.

==History==
[[File:Dorotheenstrasse 62-66 Berlin.jpg|thumb|Romanian embassy in [[Berlin]]]]

Emigration to Germany from Romania was common throughout the 20th century, and continued steadily way into the early 21st century. Large numbers of ethnic [[Germans of Romania]] (most notably [[Transylvanian Saxons]] and [[Banat Swabians]]) left the country prior, during, and after the events that ultimately led to [[World War II]]. 

In the times of the [[communist Romania|communist regime in Romania]], albeit the borders were officially closed by authorities, significant  numbers of Romanian-Germans were allowed to emigrate to [[West Germany]], particularly in the later years of the [[Nicolae Ceaușescu|Ceaușescu era]]. This formed part of a series of ethnic migrations (including [[Jews]] to [[Israel]] and [[Hungarians]] to [[Hungary]]), which were tolerated under the then socialist rulership. During the 1980s, more than half of the people who left Romania went to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Porumbescu|first=Alexandra|year=2015|title=Historical Landmarks of the Romanian's Migration to Germany|url=http://www.journal.faaa.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1_1_article_alexandra_porumbescu.pdf|journal=Journal of Humanities, Culture and Social Sciences|volume=1|issue=1|pages=27–40|issn=2393-5960|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Romanian Revolution]] which took place in December of 1989, there has been a mass migration of [[Transylvania Saxons]] to Germany, in what was referred by British daily newspaper ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' to as 'the most astonishing, and little reported, ethnic migration in modern Europe'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/oct/01/romania-saxon-conservation-village|title=A forgotten Saxon world shows how ancient and modern can co-exist|last=Jenkins|first=Simon|date=2009-10-01|website=The Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Emigration of ethnic Romanians to Germany become quite common in the 21st century, particularly after the entry of Romania in the [[European Union]] in 2007. The [[Romanian diaspora]] in Germany has a strong presence. If descent is actually taken into account as the main criterion of immigration, then the total number of individuals living in Germany who stem from Romania (both Romanian-German and Romanian) may amount to as much as 2,000,000 residents, therefore putting the Romanian diaspora living in this country the largest of all Romanian ones living within the European Union.

The '''Samma dynasty''' ({{lang-sd|سمن جو راڄ}}, {{lang-ur|سلسله سماں}}) was a Muslim [[Rajput]] power on the [[Indian Subcontinent]], that ruled in [[Sindh]], [[Kutch]], [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurastra]] and parts of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]] from {{circa}} 1351 to {{circa|lk=no}} 1524&amp;nbsp;CE, with their capital at [[Thatta]] in modern [[Pakistan]]; before being replaced by the [[Arghun dynasty]].

The Samma dynasty has left its mark in Sindh with magnificent structures including the necropolis of  and royalties in Thatta.&lt;ref name="(Pakistan)Latif1976"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Census Organization (Pakistan)|author2=Abdul Latif|title=Population Census of Pakistan, 1972: Larkana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=63maAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=yadav+rajputs&amp;dq=yadav+rajputs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kXyZTYzZJ8jZrQfzppH0Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAThu|year=1976|publisher=Manager of Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Population Census of Pakistan, 1972: Jacobabad&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Multan15.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Tomb at [[Uch|Uch Sharif]]]]
Before the Samma dynasty took control, the Sindh was ruled by the [[Soomro|Soomra]], first as nominal vassals of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] of [[Cairo]], later as vassals of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], which reached its greatest extent under [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] ({{circa|lk=no}} 1300–1351).

The Sammas, the Jat Rulers, gained control of Thatta in the southern Sindh from the Sumras around 1335, and expanded their territory northward to [[Bhakkar]] and beyond. In 1361-62, [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq]] of Delhi Sultanate, invaded Sindh and again brought Sammas under his suzerainty. Throughout the period of the Samma dynasty, [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] groups were pushing down from the northwest, including those led by [[Timur]] (Tamerlane) who sacked Delhi in 1398. Sindh remained under control of [[Khizr Khan]], founder of [[Sayyid dynasty]], who was an who was an appointed governor of Sindh and Multan provinces by Timur on his behalf. Sammas remained under Sayyid dynasty till 1451. Later Sammas were finally defeated by the [[Arghun dynasty]], who had been displaced from [[Kandahar]] in [[Afghanistan]] by Babur, in 1519–1520.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

==Beginnings==

Information about the early years of the Samma dynasty is very sketchy. We know from [[Ibn Battuta]] that in 1333 the Sammas were in rebellion, led by the Jat founder of the dynasty, [[Jam Tamachi]] Unar. The Sammas overthrew the [[Soomro|Soomras]] soon after 1335 and the last Soomra ruler took shelter with the governor of [[Gujarat]]. Mohammad bin Tughlaq made an expedition against Sindh in 1351 and died at Sondha, possibly in an attempt to restore the Soomras. With this, the Sammas became independent.  The next sultan, [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq]] attacked Sindh in 1365 and 1367, but were completely defeated but with reinforcements from [[Delhi]] he later obtained Banbhiniyo's surrender. The Samma dynasty overtook the [[Sumra dynasty]] and ruled Sindh during 1365–1521. Around that time, the [[Sindhi Swarankar community]] returned from Kutch to their home towns in Sindh, and some settled empty land on the banks of Sindhu River near Dadu, Sindh. By the end of year 1500, nearly the entire Sindhi Swarankar community had returned to Sindh. This period marks the beginning of Sufistic thought and teachings in Sindh.

The dynasty independently ruled Sindh and the Sultanate of Delhi were unable to defeat or conquer them. Their kingdom turned out to be Golden period of Sindh because unlike the nomadic tribes of Delhi Sultanate with their tribal lack of civility; they had well established cultural and social foundation rooted in pre-Islamic secular Indian culture and Islam.&lt;ref name="panhwar.com"&gt;[http://www.panhwar.com/Article162.htm Directions in the History and Archaeology of Sindh by M. H. Panhwar]&lt;/ref&gt; During most of period of Samma rule, the Sindh was [[politically]] and [[economically]] tied to the [[Gujarat Sultanate]], with occasional periods of friction. Coins struck by the Samma dynasty show the titles "[[Sultan]]" and "[[Shah]]" as well as "[[Jam (title)|Jam]]", the [[Jadeja]] rulers of western Gujarat also part of [[Samma tribe]] and directly descended from [[Jam Unar]], the first Samma sultan of Sindh. Even the [[Chudasama]] [[Rajputs of Gujarat]] are also part of Samma tribe, who are still Hindu, and distributed in [[Junagadh]] District and Bhal Region of Gujarat.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

==History==
{{Samma monarchs}}

The Samma dynasty took the title "Jam", the equivalent of "King" or "Sultan", because they claimed to be descended from [[Jamshid]]. This is almost certainly fictitious.&lt;ref name="M.H. Syed p240"&gt;[History of Delhi Sultanate by M.H. Syed (p240), 2005 {{ISBN|978-8-12611-830-4}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main sources of information on the Samma dynasty are Nizammud-din, Abu-'l-Fazl, [[Firishta]] and Mir Ma'sum, all lacking in detail, and with conflicting information. A plausible reconstruction of the chronology is given in the ''History of Delhi Sultanate'' by M. H. Syed, at right.&lt;ref name="M.H. Syed p240"/&gt;

===Jam Unar===

{{Main article|Jam Unar}}
Jam Unar was the founder of Samma dynasty mentioned by [[Ibn Battuta]], the famous traveller from [[North Africa]] (Ibn Battuta visited Sindh in 1333, and saw Samma's rebellion against Delhi government&lt;ref name="panhwar.com"/&gt;). Jam Unar, the Samma chief, taking advantage of the strained relation between the [[Soomra dynasty|Soomra]] and the [[Sultanate of Delhi]], defeated the last Soomra ruler, son of Dodo, and established Samma rule.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

===Jam Salahuddin===

Jám Saláhuddìn bin Jám Tamáchí was the successor of his father Jám Tamáchí. He put down revolts in some parts of the country, by sending forces in those directions and punished the ringleaders. Some of these unruly bands fled to Kachh, to which place Jám Saláhuddín pursued them, and in every engagement that took place he defeated them and ultimately subjugated them. He died after a reign of 11 years.

===Jam Ali Sher===

Jám Alí Sher bin Jám Tamáchí ruled the country very discreetly. Tamáchí’s other sons Sikandar and Karn, and Fateh Khán son of Sikandar, who had brought ruin on the last Jám, were now conspiring against Jám Alísher. They were therefore looking for an opportunity to fall upon him while he was out enjoying the moonlight as usual. They spent their time in the forests in the vicinity of the town. One Friday night, on the 13th of the lunar month, they took a band of cut-throats with them, and with naked swords attacked Jám Alísher who had come out in a boat to enjoy the moonlight on the quiet surface of the river and was returning home. They killed him, and red-handed they ran to the city, where the people had no help for it but to place one of them, Karan, on the vacant throne. The reign of Jám Alí Sher lasted for seven years.

===Jam Fateh Khan bin Jam Sikandar===

Jám Karan was succeeded by his nephew Jám Fateh Khán bin Sikandar. He ruled quietly for some time and gave satisfaction to the people in general.

About this time, [[Mirza]] [[Pir Muhammad bin Jahangir Mirza|Pir Muhammad]] one of [[Timur|Amir Timur]]’s grandsons came to [[Multan]] and conquered that town and [[Uch]]. As he made a long stay there, most of the horses with him died of a disease and his horsemen were obliged to move about as foot-soldiers. When Amir Timur heard of this, he sent 30,000 horses from his own stables to his grandson to enable him to extend his conquests. Pir Muhammad, being thus equipped, attacked those of the [[zamindar]]s who had threatened to do him harm and destroyed their household property. He then sent a messenger to Bakhar calling the chief men of the place to come and pay respects to him. But these men fearing his vengeance left the place in a body and went to Jesalmer. 

Mirzá Pír Muhammad soon went to Delhi, which place he took and where he was crowned as king. [[Multan]] remained in the hands of Langáhs, and Sind in those of the Sammah rulers as before.

===Jam Taghlak===

Jám Taghlak was fond of hunting and left his brothers to administer the affairs of state at Sehwán and Bakhar. In his reign some Balóch raised the standard of revolt in the outskirts of Bakhar, but Jám Taghlak marched in the direction and punished their ring-leaders and appointed an outpost in each [[pargana]]h to prevent any future rebellion of the kind. He died after a reign of 28 years.

===Jam Sikandar===

Jám Sikandar bin Jám Taghlak was a minor when he succeeded his father to the throne. The governors of Sehwán and Bakhar shook off their yoke, and prepared to take offensive steps. Jám Sikandar was obliged to march out from Tattá to Bakhar. When he came as far as Nasarpúr, a man by name Mubárak, who during the last Jám’s reign had made himself celebrated for acts of bravery, proclaimed himself king under the name of Jám Mubárak. But as the people were not in league with him, he was driven away within 3 days and information sent to Jám Sikandar, who made peace with his opponents and hastened to Tattá. After a year and a half, he died.

===Jam Nizamuddin I===

After Jam Salahuddin’s death, the nobles of the state put his son Jám Nizámuddín I bin Jám Saláhuddín on the throne. Jam Nizamuddin ruled for only a few months. His first act of kindness was the release of his cousins Sikandar, Karn and Baháuddín and Ámar, who had been placed in captivity by the advice of the ministers. He appointed every one of them as an officer to discharge administrative duties in different places, while he himself remained in the capital, superintending the work done by them and other officials in different quarters of the country.

Before long, however, his cousins, very ungratefully made a conspiracy among themselves and stealthily coming to the capital attempted to seize him. But Jám Saláhuddín learning their intention in time, left the place at the dead of night with a handful of men and made his escape to [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]]. In the morning, men were sent after him, but before any information could be brought about him, the people summoned Alísher, son of Jám Tamáchí, who was living in obscurity, and raised him to the throne. Meanwhile, Jám Nizámuddín also died in his flight and his cousins too being disappointed in every thing, lived roving lives.

===Jam Sanjar===

{{Main article|Jam Sanjar}}

On Ráinah’s death, Sanjar (Radhan) Sadr al-Din became the Jám of Sind. He is said to have been a very handsome person, and on that account was constantly attended by a large number of persons, who took pleasure in remaining in his company. It is believed that before his coming to the throne, a pious fakír had been very fond of him; that one day Sanjar informed him that he had a very strong desire to become the king of Tattá though it should be for not more than 8 days; and that the fakír had given him his blessings, telling him that he would be the king of the place for 8 years.

Jám Sanjar ruled the country very wisely. Under no ruler before this had the people of Sind enjoyed such ease of mind. He was very fond of the company of the learned and the pious. Every Friday he used to distribute charities and had fixed periodical allowances for those who deserved the same. He increased the pay of responsible officers. One Kází Maarúf, who had been appointed by the late rulers to be the Kází of Bakhar, was in the habit of receiving bribes from the plaintiffs as well as from the defendants. When this fact came to the notice of Jám Sanjar, he sent for the Kází and asked him about it. The Kází admitted the whole thing. “Yes” said he “I do demand something from the plaintiffs as well as the defendants, and I am anxious to get something from the witnesses too, but before the case closes, they go away and I am disappointed in that.” Jám Sanjar could not help laughing at this. The Kází continued “I work in the court for the whole day and my wife and children die of hunger at home, because I get very little pay.” Jám Sanjar increased his pay and issued general orders for the increase of every government post of importance.

===Jam Nizamuddin II===

{{Main article|Jam Nizamuddin II}}

Jám Nizámuddín II (866–914AH, 1461–1508AD) was the most famous Sultan of the Samma or Jamot dynasty,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/mag/2004/04/11/stories/2004041100590800.htm The Hindu - The world's largest necropolis]&lt;/ref&gt; which ruled in Sindh and parts of Punjab and Balochistan (region) from 1351-1551 CE. He was known by the nickname of Jám Nindó. His capital was at Thatta in modern Pakistan. The Samma Sultanate reached the height of its power during the reign of Jam Nizamuddin II, who is still recalled as a hero, and his rule as a golden age.

Shortly after his accession, he went with a large force to [[Bhakkar]], where he spent about a year, during which time he extirpated the freebooters and robbers who annoyed the people in that part of the country. After that, for a period of forty-eight years he reigned at Tatta with absolute power.

In the last part of Jám Nindó’s reign, after 1490 CE, a Mughul army under Shah Beg Arghun came from [[Kandahar]] and fell upon many villages of Chundooha and Sideejuh, invading the town of Ágrí, Ohándukah, Sibi Sindichah and Kót Máchián. Jám Nindó sent a large army under his Vazier Darya Khan[1], which, arriving at the village known by the name of Duruh-i-Kureeb, also known as Joolow Geer or Halúkhar near Sibi, defeated the Mughuls in a pitched battle. Sháh Beg Arghun’s brother Abú Muhammad Mirzá was killed in the battle, and the Mughuls fled back to Kandahár, never to return during the reign of Jám Nizámuddín[2].

Jam Nizamuddin's death was followed by a war of succession between the cousins Jam Feroz and Jam Salahuddin.

===Jam Feruzudin===

{{Main article|Jám Feróz}}
[[File:Coin of jam feroz.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Coin during the rule of Jam Feraz]]
Jam Feruz bin Jam Nizam was the last ruler of the Samma dynasty of Sindh. Jám Feróz succeeded his father Jám Nizámuddín at a minor age. Jám Feróz was a young man, and as from the commencement the management of the state affairs was in the hands of his guardian he spent his time in his harem and seldom went out. But he was fearful of his ministers.

As a precautionary measure he enlisted in his service Kíbak Arghún and a large number of men belonging to the tribes of Mughuls, who had during his reign, left Sháhbeg Arghún and came to Tattá. Jám Feróz gave them the quarter of the town, called Mughal-Wárah to live in. He secretly flattered himself for his policy in securing the services of intrepid men to check Daryá Khán, but he never for a minute imagined what ruin these very men were destined to bring on him. For, it was through some of these men that Sháhbeg Arghún was induced to invade and conquer Sind in 926 AH (1519 AD) at the [[Battle of Fatehpur (1519)]], which resulted in the displacement of the Sammah dynasty of rulers by that of Arghún.

==Legacy==
[[File:Makli3.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Tombs at Makli]]
The rise of Thatta as an important commercial and cultural centre was directly related to Jam Ninda's patronage and policies. At the time the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese took control]] of the trading centre of [[Hormuz Island|Hormuz]] in 1514 CE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Hormuz |volume=12 |page=694}}&lt;/ref&gt; trade from the Sindh accounted for nearly 10% of their customs revenue, and they described Thatta as one of the richest cities in the world. Thatta's prosperity was based partly on its own high-quality cotton and silk textile industry, partly on export of goods from further inland in the Punjab and northern India. However, the trade declined when the Mughals took over.  Later, due to silting of the main Indus channel, Thatta no longer functioned as a port.&lt;ref&gt;[The Global World of Indian Merchants, 1750-1947: Traders of Sind from Bukhara to Panama by Claude Markovits, 2000 {{ISBN|978-0-521-62285-1}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Samma civilization contributed significantly to the evolution of the [[Indo-Islamic architecture|Indo-Islamic architectural]] style. Thatta is famous for its necropolis, which covers 10 square km on the [[Makli Hill]].  It assumed its quasi-sacred character during Jam Ninda's rule.  Every year thousands perform pilgrimage to this site to commemorate the saints buried here. The graves testify to a long period when Thatta was a thriving center of trade, religion and scholarly pursuits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archnet.org/library/places/one-place.jsp?place_id=2179&amp;order_by=year&amp;showdescription=1 Archnet.org: Thattah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606120407/https://archnet.org/library/places/one-place.jsp?place_id=2179&amp;order_by=year&amp;showdescription=1 |date=2012-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shawn Timothy Nelson''' (August 21, 1959&lt;ref&gt;[http://vitals.rootsweb.ancestry.com/ca/death/search.cgi?surname=Nelson&amp;given=Shawn California Death Records]; accessed May 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; – May 17, 1995) was a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[veteran]] and unemployed [[plumber]] who stole an [[M60 Patton|M60A3 Patton]] tank from a [[United States National Guard]] [[armory (military)|Armory]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]], and went on a [[running amok|rampage]] on May 17, 1995, destroying cars, [[fire hydrant]]s, and a [[recreational vehicle]] before being shot and killed by police.&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DD1639F93AA25756C0A963958260 "Man Killed After Stealing Tank for Rampage"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 19, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prior to the incident==
Nelson was hospitalized in 1990 for neck and back injuries from a motorcycle accident. He sued the hospital for $1.6 million citing [[negligence]], [[assault]], [[battery (crime)|battery]], and [[false imprisonment]]. A [[superior court]] judge dismissed the case, and the hospital [[counterclaim|counter-sued]] for $6,640 in medical fees and legal expenses. Nelson claimed that he was forced to be treated without his consent.

His wife of six years filed for divorce against him in 1991, and both of his parents died of [[cancer]] in 1992. Scott Nelson, Shawn's brother, said that Shawn became addicted to [[methamphetamine]] in the few years prior to the incident. His neighbors complained to authorities of Shawn yelling at his roommate at night. Nelson then began to exhibit unusual behavior. On one occasion, he dug a hole {{convert|15|ft|m}} deep in his backyard in an attempt to mine for [[gold]].&lt;ref name=latimes1&gt;Rotella, S. and C. Kraul. [http://articles.latimes.com/1995-05-19/news/mn-3459_1_tank-battalion Tank's Driver Beset by Drug, Money Problems], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''. May 19, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In February 1995, he filed a notice informing the county of his plans to mine [[bedrock]] in his backyard.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Nelson's fishing friend, Carson Honings, referred to the [[shaft mining|mine shaft]] as Shawn's "new hobby". In April, he filed two damage claims against the city totaling $2,000,000. One of them was for police negligence, and another for [[false arrest]].

Nelson's neck and back problems, combined with the theft of plumbing equipment from his truck, effectively halted his business. With no income, his utilities were cut off and his house was in [[foreclosure]].&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt; In April 1995, his live-in girlfriend died of a drug overdose. His brother, Scott, said of him, "My brother was a good man. He'd help anybody. He just couldn't help himself."{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Tank rampage==
[[File:American M60A3 tank Lake Charles, Louisiana April 2005.jpg|thumb|right|alt=M60A3 Patton on display in Lake Charles, Louisiana, in April 2005|An M60A3 Patton – the same type of tank Shawn Nelson drove on his 1995 rampage in San Diego – on display in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]], in April 2005.]]According to [[San Diego Police Department|San Diego police]], the week before his tank rampage Nelson told a friend that he was thinking of committing [[suicide]], and the following weekend, told a friend that "Oklahoma was good stuff,"&lt;ref name=latimes1/&gt; in apparent reference to the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] which happened about a month before. Whether Nelson condoned the attack or simply meant that he enjoyed the drama is not clear. Police did not believe Nelson had any connection with the bombing or with a terrorist group.

At dusk&lt;ref name=latimes1/&gt; on Wednesday, May 17, 1995, Nelson drove his [[Chevrolet]] van to the [[California Army National Guard]] [[armory (military)|Armory]] in the [[Kearny Mesa, San Diego|Kearny Mesa]] neighborhood of San Diego. Although the gate to the vehicle yard was usually locked after 5:00 p.m.,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} employees at the armory were working late, and left the gate open. The vehicle yard was completely deserted. 

Nelson likely used a [[crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] to break open the tank hatches{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} . The tanks involved started with a push button and did not require an ignition key. The first two tanks he broke into would not start. As he lowered himself into the third tank, a 57-ton [[M60 Patton|M60A3]], he was finally noticed by a guardsman, who approached the tank. Nelson started the vehicle, and with little chance of stopping him, the guardsman rushed to a phone and called police. As ammunition was kept in another building, none of the vehicle's weapons could be loaded or used by Nelson.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt;

Nelson led police on a 23-minute, televised chase through the streets of the [[Clairemont, San Diego|Clairemont]] neighborhood of San Diego. Phillip Cady was the first police officer on the scene of the tank chase. The tank had a top speed of {{convert|30|mph}}, making the chase slow compared to police chases involving automobiles. The 57-ton tank easily plowed through road signs, traffic lights, utility poles, fire hydrants and crushed several parked vehicles including an RV. The damage to utility poles knocked out power to at least 5,100 [[San Diego Gas &amp; Electric]] customers in the [[Linda Vista, San Diego|Linda Vista]] neighborhood. Nelson traveled north on Convoy St, west on to Balboa Ave, and entered Interstate 805 heading south.  While on Interstate 805 he attempted to knock down a pedestrian bridge by running into the supports, but gave up after he failed to topple it with the first few hits. Nelson drove the tank onto the [[California State Route 163|State Route 163]] freeway heading southbound, resulting in the freeway being closed and thousands of motorists being stuck. He eventually became caught on a [[concrete]] [[Jersey barrier|median barrier]] on State Route 163 north of the Genesee Avenue interchange located at approximately {{coord|32.795687|-117.157627}}, as he attempted to cross into oncoming traffic. Four police officers climbed onto the tank. San Diego Police officer Paul Paxton, a [[gunnery sergeant]] at the time with the [[Marine Corps Reserve]], opened the hatch. The officers ordered Nelson to surrender, but he said nothing and began lurching the tank back and forth in attempt to free it from the median.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=LaVelle|first1=Philip J.|last2=Dibsie|first2=Patricia|title=Stolen 57-ton vehicle leaves ruin in its tracks – Police kill driver on Route 163|work=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=May 18, 1995|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-stolen-57-ton-vehicle-leaves-ruin-its-tracks-polic-1995may18-story.html|accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officer Paxton's partner, Richard Piner, leaned in and shot Nelson. The bullet entered through Nelson's shoulder. Nelson later died at [[Sharp Memorial Hospital]]. Despite the widespread property destruction, Nelson was the only fatality in the incident.

===Police action===
Questions were raised as to whether it was necessary for the police to kill Nelson. Police Captain Tom Hall said that if Nelson had managed to free the tank, he "could have taken out no less than 35 vehicles that were passing at that moment."&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt; 

Police decided that if non-lethal action such as [[tear gas]] were used, this might have stopped Nelson, but not the tank, and officers would not be able to enter the tank if it were still mobile with tear gas present. According to live news coverage at the time, officials were seriously considering asking for help from the [[United States Marine Corps]] at [[Camp Pendleton]] in the form of a [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|Cobra]] [[attack helicopter]], as the police force lacked the means for disabling a tank.{{cn|date=November 2013}} Scott Nelson, when asked, stated that police were justified in shooting his brother.&lt;ref name=latimes1/&gt;

===News coverage===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
Local television news station [[KGTV]], Channel 10, broadcast footage of Nelson's shirtless, bloody body being pulled from the tank by police both live and during the eleven o'clock news. It was in the broadcast that Scott Nelson recognized his brother as the perpetrator. KGTV was the only station that decided to air this footage. Jeff Klotzman, then the news director at KGTV, said in response to criticism, "We felt it was a critical part of the story. We warned our viewers three different times that it was graphic, and it was." Richard Tuininga, news director of [[KUSI]], Channel 51, supported Klotzman's decision, even though his own news program decided not to air the footage.

==Armory security==
Officials at the National Guard armory where Nelson stole the tank were criticized for what appeared to be a huge lapse in security, especially after the attack in Oklahoma City the previous month. In addition to the open, unguarded gate to the vehicle lot, the fence surrounding the lot had damaged [[barbed wire]] in some places. 

Residents near the armory said that even if the gate had been locked, Nelson could have simply climbed the fence in sections where the barbed wire was damaged. Armory officials said that only a few people are given keys to the vehicles, that the vehicles were kept far away from fences to make them difficult to reach, that only someone with proper knowledge could operate and even start a tank, and that there was just no way to foresee such an event taking place. After Nelson's theft of the tank, security was tightened at the Kearny Mesa armory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1D61339F932A15756C0A963958260 "Theft of Tank Raises Questions About the Security at Armories"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 21, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentary==
''Cul de Sac: A Suburban War Story'', a documentary film, was based on the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0317273|title=Cul de Sac: A Suburban War Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''shooting of [[Datuk#Malaysia|Datuk]] Ong Teik Kwong''' occurred on 1 December 2016, in Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway, [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]]. Ong, a 32-years-old [[businessman]] was on the way to Penang when his bodyguard, Ja'afar Halid had pulled out his gun and started shooting at him and the passenger. Ja'afar Halid accidentally shot at more than seven people in the scene, resulting in Ong's and two passers-by's death. The incident also left four injured.

'''Tatars''' ({{lang-ro|Tătari}}), a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking ethnic group,  have been present on the territory of today's [[Romania]] since the 13th century. According to the 2011 census, 20,282 people declared their nationality as Tatar, most of them being [[Crimean Tatars]] living in [[Constanţa County]]. They are the main factor of [[Islam in Romania]].

==History==
{{further|Tatars|Tartary}}
===Middle Ages===
The roots of the Crimean Tatar community in Romania began{{how|date=September 2016}} with the [[Cumans|Cuman]] migration in the 10th century. Even before the Cumans arrived, other Turkic people like the [[Huns]] and the [[Bulgars]] settled in this region.  The Tatars first reached the mouths of the [[Danube]] in the mid-13th century at the height of the power of the [[Golden Horde]]. In 1241, under the leadership of Kadan, the Tatars crossed the Danube, conquering and devastating{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} the region. The region was probably not under the direct rule of the Horde, but rather, a vassal of the [[Bakhchisaray]] Khan.&lt;ref name="Stan44"&gt;Stănciugel et al., p.44-46&lt;/ref&gt; It is known from Arab sources that at the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th century that descendants of the [[Nogai Horde]] settled in [[Isaccea]]. Another Arab scholar, [[Ibn Battuta]], who passed through the region in 1330–31, talks about ''Baba Saltuk'' ([[Babadag]]) as the southernmost town of the Tatars.&lt;ref name="Stan44"/&gt;

The Golden Horde began to lose its influence after the wars of 1352-1359 and at the time, a Tatar warlord [[Demetrius, Prince of the Tatars|Demetrius]] is noted defending the cities of the Mouths of the Danube. In the 14th and 15th centuries the [[Ottoman Empire]] colonized [[Dobruja]] with [[Nogais]] from [[Budjak|Bucak]]. Between 1593 and 1595 Tatars from Nogai and [[Budjak|Bucak]] were also settled to Dobruja. (Frederick de Jong)

===Early modern period===
Toward the end of the 16th century, about 30,000 Nogai Tatars from the [[Budjak]] were brought to [[Dobruja]].&lt;ref name="Stan147"&gt;Stănciugel et al., p.147&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774|Russian annexation of Crimea]] in 1783 [[Crimean Tatars]] began emigrating to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] coastal provinces of  [[Dobruja]] (today divided between [[Romania]] and  [[Bulgaria]]). Once in Dobruja most settled in the areas surrounding [[Medgidia|Mecidiye]], [[Babadag]], [[Constanţa|Köstence]], [[Tulcea|Tulça]], [[Silistra|Silistre]], [[Beștepe, Tulcea|Beştepe]], or [[Varna]] and went on to create villages named in honor of their abandoned homeland such as Şirin, Yayla, Akmecit, Yalta, Kefe or Beybucak.{{when|date=September 2016}}

===Late modern period===
From 1783 to 1853 tens of thousands of Crimean Tatars and [[Nogais]] emigrated to the [[Rousse|Rusçuk]] region which subsequently became known as "Little Tartary". Following the Russian conquest of 1812, Nogais from Bucak also immigrated to Dobruja. Tatars who settled in Dobruja before the great exodus of 1860 were known as ''Kabail''. They formed the Kabail Tatar squadron in the ''[[Nizam-ı Cedid]]'' (New Order) army of sultan [[Selim III]]. They played a key role in [[Mahmud II]]'s struggle with [[Mehmet Ali Pasha]] of Egypt, suppressed rebellions in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Kurdistan]], and the Arab provinces and served with the Ottomans during the [[Crimean War]].

Tatars together with Albanians served as [[Bashi-bazouk|gendarmes]], who were held in high esteem by the Ottomans and received special tax privileges. The Ottoman's additionally accorded a certain degree of autonomy for the Tatars who were allowed governance by their own [[kaymakam]], Khan Mirza. The [[Giray dynasty]] (1427 - 1878) multiplied in Dobruja and maintained their respected position. A Dobrujan Tatar, [[Kara Hussein]], was responsible for the destruction of the [[Janissary]] corps on orders from Sultan Mahmut II.

From 1877-1878 it is estimated that between 80,000 and 100,000 Crimean Tatars emigrated from Dobruja to [[Anatolia]], which continued in smaller numbers until World War I. The reasons for the emigration were several: In 1883 the Romanian government enacted laws requiring compulsory military service for all Romanian subjects including Tatars who were concerned that serving a Christian army was not in accord with their Muslim identity. Other reasons included the 1899 famine in Dobruja, a series of laws from 1880 to 1885 regarding confiscation of Tatar and Turkish land, and the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912–13) which devastated the region.

==Early 20th century to WWII==
[[Image:Dobethn1903.png|300px|thumb|Nationalities in Northern Dobruja at the beginning of the 20th century, with Tatars in yellow]]

A unique Crimean Tatar national identity in Dobruja began to emerge in the last quarter of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tatar.ro Romanian Tatars' Site]&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Ismail Gasprinski]], considered by many to be the father of Crimean Tatar nationalism, visited [[Constanţa|Köstence]] ([[Constanţa]]) in 1895 he discovered his newspaper ''Tercüman'' was already in wide circulation. However, it was the poet [[Mehmet Niyazi]] who is most credited with spreading nationalist ideas among the Tatars of Dobruja. In the wake of the fall of the [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] government, Dobruja became the foremost place of refuge for Tatars from Crimea. Many of these refugees were inspired to join the [[Prometheism|Prometheus movement]] in Europe which aimed for the independence of Soviet nationalities. During this period Mustecip Hacı Fazıl (later took the surname Ulkusal) was the leader of community in Dobruja. In 1918, when he was 19 he went to Crimea to teach in Tatar schools and published the first Tatar journal in Dobruja, ''Emel'' from 1930 to 1940. He and other nationalists protested Tatar emigration from Dobruja to Turkey, believing resettlement in [[Crimea]] was preferable.

In the 1920s Dobruja persisted as the primary destination for refugees  escaping the Soviets. The Tatars were relatively free to organize politically and publish journals founded on nationalist ideas. During [[World War II]] many Tatars escaped from [[Crimea]] and took refugee with Crimean Tatar families in Dobruja who were subsequently punished harshly by [[Communist Romania]]. The refugees who attempted escape by sea were attacked by Red Army aircraft, while those who followed land routes through [[Moldavia]] managed to reach Dobruja before the Red Army captured and deported most of them to Siberia on May 18, 1944. Necip Hacı Fazıl, the leader of the smuggling committee was executed and his brother Müstecip Hacı Fazıl fled to Turkey.

==Developments Post-WWII==

In 1940 [[Southern Dobruja]] was given to Bulgaria and by 1977 an estimated number of 23,000 Tatars were living in Romania. According to Nermin Eren that number increased to around 40,000 by the 1990s. In 2005 The [[Democratic Union of Turkish-Muslim Tatars of Romania]] claimed that there are 50,000 Tatars in Romania, believing the census estimate is artificially low because most Tatars identified themselves as Turks. Nermin Eren also estimated the number of Tatars in Bulgaria to be around 20,000 in 1990s. The Bulgarian sources estimate it to be around 6,000, though they are aware that most Tatars intermarry Turks or identify themselves as Turks. Between 1947-1957 Tatar schools began operating in Romania and in 1955 a special alphabet was created for the Tatar community. In 1990 the Democratic Union of Muslim Tatar-Turks was established. Currently Romania respects the minority rights of Tatars and does not follow any policy of [[Romanianization]].

==Subgroups==

===Crimean Tatars===
[[Crimean Tatars]] were brought to Dobruja by the Ottomans following the increasing power of the Russians in the region and its annexation of Crimea in 1783. However, after the independence of Romania in 1877-1878, between 80,000 and 100,000 Crimean Tatars moved to [[Anatolia]], a migration which continued afterwards. As such, the number of Tatars in [[Northern Dobruja]] decreased from 21% in 1880 to 5.6% in 1912. In 2002, they formed 2.4% of the population.

===Nogais===
The [[Nogais|Nogai]] component of the Tatar population are not separately enumerated in Romanian censuses. Most have emigrated to [[Turkey]] but it is estimated that a few thousand Nogais still live in Dobruja, notably in the town of [[Mihail Kogălniceanu, Constanța|Mihail Kogălniceanu]] (Karamurat) and villages of [[Lumina, Constanța|Lumina]] (Kocali), [[Medgidia|Valea Dacilor]] (Hendekkarakuyusu) and [[Cobadin]] (Kubadin).

'''Youth in Nigeria''' includes citizens of the Federal Republic of [[Nigeria]] aged 18–35 years.&lt;ref name="Youth Policy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nigeria 2009 National Youth Policy https://www.k4health.org/toolkits/youthpolicy/nigeria-national-youth-policy-and-strategic-plan-action}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variance in chronologies are used in defining [[youth]] and are addressed by members of the state in accordance to their particular society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=Andy|title=Youth Studies An introduction|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415564793}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nigeria is the most populous country in [[Africa]] with one of the largest populations of youth in the world, comprising 33,652,424 members. Excessive mortality from [[HIV/AIDS]] results in low life expectancy in Nigeria.  As a result, the median age is 17.9.&lt;ref name="World Factbook"&gt;{{cite book|title=The CIA World Factbook 2014|date=2013|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc|isbn=9781626360730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, formerly the President of Nigeria from 1999 until 2007, believes that identifying and addressing issues that would enhance the lives of the youth would improve overall national development. He has stated that, "Youth constitute Nigeria's only hope for a real future". The Nigerian government characterizes youth as ambitious, enthusiastic, energetic and promising. They are considered vulnerable in society because of the rapid pace of change they experience at this time in their lives.&lt;ref name="Youth Policy"/&gt; A National Youth Development Policy was created and designed to advocate for youth and youth development. The policy views youth welfare as vital to the Nigerian nation and its socioeconomic development. This policy is seen as a youth participation project, versus a project identifying problems and needs.&lt;ref name="Youth Policy"/&gt;

==National Youth Policy of the Federal Republic of Nigeria==
The 2009 National Youth Policy recognizes 5 priority areas that need to be addressed to enhance youth lives.  These include the impact of globalization, access and use of communication technology, the impact of [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]]s and HIV/AIDS, intergenerational issues in an aging society, and youth perpetrators and victims of armed conflict.&lt;ref name="Youth Policy"/&gt;  The 2009 National Youth Policy is guided by several national and international policy initiatives, including National Policies for education, gender, health, population for sustainable development, and the National Economic Empowerment Development Strategy (NEEDS).  The [[Millennium Development Goals]], the [[African Youth Charter]], and other international agreements further guide the policy goals found in the document.&lt;ref name="Youth Policy"/&gt;

[[File:Women for health (7139243509).jpg|thumb|left|Women for health training to support girls and women to train as health workers in northern Nigeria by 2016, providing support to meet entry standards.]] National Youth Policy prioritizes the difficulties women have faced throughout history. Some women experience less occupational opportunity, physical violence and abuse, and labor exploitation.   They suffer negative consequences from teenage marriages and pregnancies. The policy seeks to protect their rights and promote female youths' interests and goals. By empowering females, restoring their dignity, establishing programs to end gender-based discrimination and promoting the rights, Nigerian youth policy places emphasis on the needs of young women.&lt;ref name="Youth Policy"/&gt;

The National Youth Policy has adopted a program for youth that are disabled. The Federal Republic of Nigeria believes that persons with disabilities have rights that should be protected by the government. The program promotes awareness of struggles that the disabled face, removing negative attitudes, while empowering the young men and women with disabilities.&lt;ref name="Youth Policy"/&gt;

==National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN)==
The [[National Youth Council of Nigeria]] (NYCN) was founded in 1964 to be the voice and the umbrella
organization for youth organizations in the country. The Youth Council is
non‐governmental, non‐partisan, and not‐for‐profit organization. The
council comprises the National Executive Committee (NEC) of 23‐
members. The NEC members are democratically elected from their
respective state chapters and its affiliated voluntary youth organizations.
The National Youth Council of Nigeria is a major stakeholder in the
implementation of the National Youth Policy, 
As an umbrella organization for youth NGOs, and youth organizations
across the country the NYCN  pursues democratic norms at all times,
embrace the principles of accountability and transparency in all its
conduct, and initiate and execute activities that are in consonance with the
goals of the National Youth Policy. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.youthpolicy.org/national/Nigeria_2009_National_Youth_Policy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family formation==
Most Nigerians live in extended large families with separate living quarters. A Nigerian child may be breastfed until the age of 2. Mothers believe there is a bond created between mother and child by [[breastfeeding]]. Educating children is regarded as a community responsibility in some ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="World Trade Press"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nigeria Society and Culture|date=2010|publisher=World Trade Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parenting styles]] differ among cultures in Nigeria. Nigerian children adapt to one of three roles: authoritarian, authoritative, or permissive, depending on their culture.&lt;ref name="World Trade Press"/&gt;

Both boys and girls learn to be responsible and hard-working at age 5.&lt;ref name="Esther"/&gt; Boys contribute to routine tasks outside the home such as helping with the livestock, and helping in the fields. Girls contribute inside the home by cooking and cleaning. Elders tend to value boys higher than girls for their physical abilities and their [[ancestry]]. First, fifth, tenth, and fifteenth birthdays are marked by a large gathering for socializing and food and drink consumption as a traditional celebration.&lt;ref name="World Trade Press"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Esther"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Akinsola|first1=Esther|title=Cultural Variation in Parenting Styles in the majority World Evidences From Nigeria and Cameroon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigerian [[urban area|urban]] youth develop romantic relationships that are kept a secret. Urban Nigerians are increasingly accepting meeting publicly; romantic relationships often lead to marriage. [[Cohabitation]] in urban areas is increasingly accepted prior to marriage while a romantic couple saves money to marry.&lt;ref name="Esther"/&gt;

Marriage is a [[coming of age]] practice among some ethnic groups. The legal minimum age to marry is 18 in most regions. Coming of age practices vary among different cultures. The [[Tiv people]] perform a ritual by marking a girl's abdomen with four incisions to make sure they are capable of conceiving a child. The Okrika Tribe hold ceremonies to mark the stage when girls are ready for marriage. These girls are painted and judged by characteristics such as beauty, grace and [[chastity]]. The girls then run a race with young men chasing them. [[Muslim]] people arrange marriages for their daughters, placing the male's family finances as an influential factor when choosing her husband.  Girls are expected to marry soon after finishing school.&lt;ref name="Esther"/&gt;

==Education==
Educating youth in Nigeria is prioritized with the goal of reducing [[poverty]], inequality, and overall increasing economic growth.&lt;ref name="Worldbank"&gt;{{cite web|website=data.worldbank.org/country/nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt; Youth in Nigeria school system consists of six years of primary education, three years of junior secondary, three years of senior secondary, and four years of tertiary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayfield|first1=Merry|title=Cultural Literacy and African Education|date=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary school completion rates are 93% for males, and 91% for females.&lt;ref name="Worldbank"/&gt;

It is a requirement for every child in Nigeria to receive a minimum of nine years of free education. The government's dominant role with funding provides funds from the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC), and Education Trust Fund (ETF). Some of the problems Nigerian youth face in education are unbiased access to junior secondary, and senior secondary education for the poor, and the need to adjust the school curriculum to focus on the transition from school to [[labour market|labour economics]].&lt;ref name="Worldbank"/&gt;
The National Youth Policy has implemented a variety of focuses in hopes to improve overall quality of education. These focal points include: development of critical fields of knowledge in applied science and technology, technical skills, vocational skills in agriculture, and promotion of the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT).&lt;ref name="Youth Policy"/&gt;

 
The policy developed leadership roles and life training skills which seek to keep youth focused on education, politics and overall youth agency. The youth are encouraged to partake in a variety of programs including: gang related violence prevention programs, Extra-curricular competitive and recreational game activities through organizations, and a student union was launched encouraging leadership roles for youth and democratic culture.&lt;ref name="Youth Policy"/&gt;

==Labor and employment==
Individuals in Nigeria can legally work when they are 15 years old.&lt;ref name="World Trade Press"/&gt;  Data on youth employment in Nigeria are scarce due to underresourced agencies responsible for their collection.  Eleven million youth unemployment in Nigeria were believed to be unemployed in 2012.&lt;ref name=Akande&gt;{{cite web|last1=Akande|first1=Tunji|title=Youth Unemployment in Nigeria: A Situation Analysis|url=http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/africa-in-focus/posts/2014/09/23-youth-unemployment-nigeria-akande|website=Brookings Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health risks==
Nigerian youth have experienced increasing rates of [[sexually transmitted diseases]] (STD's) and [[HIV/AIDS]]. Prevalence of female youth STD contraction is 17.2%.&lt;ref name="Ayo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adebowale |first1=Ayo|last2= Titiloye|first2= Musibau|last3=Fagbamigbe|first3= Adeniyi|last4=Akinyemi|first4=Odunaya|title=Statistical modeling of social risk factors for sexually transmitted diseases among female youths in Nigeria|date= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV/AIDS prevalence among all youth is 5.2%, compared to the national prevalence at 4.4%.The Federal Government of Nigeria National Youth Policy attempts to mitigate prevalence by providing care, treatment and support for infected young people. In doing so, government promotes prevention activities through risk reduction, abstinence, and condom use.&lt;ref name="Youth Policy"/&gt;

STD and HIV/AIDS contraction can cause serious, permanent health issues, infertility, death and social consequences such as social exclusion. Many social factors contribute to the rates of contraction.&lt;ref name="Ayo"/&gt; Advancements in [[information communication technology]] expose youth to a variety of values and ways of thinking which differ from their elder generations.&lt;ref name="Youth Policy"/&gt;
Cultural [[norm (social)|norm]]s serve as barriers to protect themselves in many cultures. [[Condom]] use is not a common practice.&lt;ref name="Ayo"/&gt;

Infection rates among youth vary according to gender, region, education, marital status, and other factors. Gender norms constrain youth women from controlling their reproductive and sexual lives. The highest rates of infection happen in the north-central part of the country (with Benue State having the highest prevalence rate), lowest in the Northeast.  Urban areas have the higher rates than rural places of residency. Youth with little or no education compromised 1.3% of infected youth, in contrast to higher levels of education whose rates were 4.7%. Prevalence of contraction was higher among youth who had never been married at 2.6%, in contrast to those who were married, 1.8%. [[Premarital sex]] is common, even though it is considered a [[taboo]] in many ethnic groups. It is common in urban areas for inter-ethnic dating to occur, though inter-religious dating does not occur.&lt;ref name="Esther"/&gt; Youth who had previous education and testing of HIV/AIDS had higher rates of STD contraction in contrast to those who had no awareness of HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="Youth Policy"/&gt;

==Suffrage==
Nigerian youth have the right to [[vote]] in political elections at 18 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=www.youth Policy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nigerian youth are campaigning for reduction in age qualification for political position with the [[Not Too Young To Run]] bill, which seeks to reduce the age too run for President from 40years to 30years; Governor 35 to 30, Senate 35 to 30, House of Representatives 30 to 25 and State of Assembly 30 to 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Olanrewaju|first1=Eweniyi|title=The Nigerian Senate Finally Passes The 'Not Too Young To Run' Bill|url=http://www.konbini.com/ng/lifestyle/the-nigerian-senate-finally-passes-the-not-too-young-to-run-bill/|accessdate=24 December 2017|publisher=Konbini|date=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=YOUTH INITIATIVE FOR ADVOCACY, GROWTH &amp; ADVANCEMENT|first1=YIAGA|title=#NotTooYoungToRun|url=http://yiaga.org/nottooyoungtorun/the-bill/|website=www.yiaga.org|publisher=YOUTH INITIATIVE FOR ADVOCACY, GROWTH &amp; ADVANCEMENT|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth in armed conflict==
Since the [[Post Cold War era]], oil based revenues and its disbursements in the [[Niger Delta]] region has led to massive protests and violence among youth. Young people have engaged in attacks  against oil firms and Nigerian militants, hostage taking and hijacking oil workers, youth militancy, vandalizing oil pipelines, and detonating bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ukkiwo|first1=U|title=From Pirates to Milirtants: a Historical Perspective on Anti-state and Anti-oil company mobalisation among the Ijaw of Warri, Western Niger Delta|journal=African Affairs|volume=106|issue=425|pages=587–610}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tension in the public has caused conflict among minority and majority groups which has crippled national and social development.&lt;ref name="Arowosegbe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arowosegbe|first1=Jeremiah|title=Violence and National Development in Nigeria: The Political Economy of Youth Restiveness in the Niger Delta|journal=Review of African Political Economy|doi=10.1080/03056240903346178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youth's participation in violence is their way of expressing feelings of [[marginalization]] and that their voices are not heard in competing for resources.&lt;ref name="Arowosegbe"/&gt;

==Characteristics==
Author and political commentator [[Victor Davis Hanson]] has written:
{{quote|Yuppism, remember, is not definable entirely by income or class. Rather, it is a late-twentieth-century cultural phenomenon of self-absorbed young professionals, earning good pay, enjoying the cultural attractions of sophisticated urban life and thought, and generally out of touch with, indeed antithetical to, most of the challenges and concerns of a far less well-off and more parochial Middle America.&lt;ref name=VDH&gt;{{Cite news|author=[[Victor Davis Hanson]]|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/243667/obama-fighting-yuppie-factor-victor-davis-hanson|title=Obama: Fighting the Yuppie Factor|accessdate=August 16, 2010|publisher=''National Review''|date=August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
[[Joseph Epstein (writer)|Joseph Epstein]] was credited for coining the term in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Movers And Shakers: A Chronology of Words That Shaped Our Age | year = 2006 | publisher = Oxford University Press | last = Ayto | first = John | isbn = 0-19-861452-7 | page = 128}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is contested. The first printed appearance of the word was in a May 1980 ''Chicago'' magazine article by [[Dan Rottenberg]].&lt;ref name=ChicagoMagazine&gt;{{Cite news|title= About that urban renaissance.... there'll be a slight delay |url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/May-1980/Yuppie/|first=Dan|last=Rottenberg|publisher=[[Chicago Magazine]]|date=May 1980|page = 154ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term gained currency in the United States in 1983 when syndicated newspaper columnist [[Bob Greene]] published a story about a business networking group founded in 1982 by the former radical leader [[Jerry Rubin]], formerly of the [[Youth International Party]] (whose members were called "[[yippie]]s"); Greene said he had heard people at the networking group (which met at [[Studio 54]] to soft classical music) joke that Rubin had "gone from being a yippie to being a yuppie". The headline of Greene's story was "From Yippie to Yuppie'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Global Finance and Urban Living: A Study of Metropolitan Change| first = Leslie| last = Budd|author2=Whimster, Sam | year = 1992| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 0-415-07097-X| page = 316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hadden-Guest, Anthony (1997). ''The Last Party: Studio 54, Disco, and the Culture of the Night''. New York: William Morrow. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[East Bay Express]]'' humorist Alice Kahn claimed to have coined the word in a 1983 column. This claim is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Clarence Petersen. |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-28/features/8601230082_1_diaper-chronicle-ferdinand |title=The Wacky Side of Chicago-born, Berkeley-bred Alice Kahn –  |work=Chicago Tribune |date=March 28, 1986 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jorge |first=Trendy |url=http://yuppie-living.blogspot.com/2006_06_01_archive.html |title=Yuppie Living: June 2006 |publisher=Yuppie-living.blogspot.com |date=June 21, 2006 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proliferation of the word was affected by the publication of ''The Yuppie Handbook'' in January 1983 (a [[tongue-in-cheek]] take on ''[[The Official Preppy Handbook]]''&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952325,00.html|title=Living: Here Come the Yuppies!|date=January 9, 1984|work=TIME.com|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), followed by Senator [[Gary Hart]]'s 1984 candidacy as a "yuppie candidate" for President of the United States.&lt;ref name=Burnett&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0021-8499| volume = 26| issue = 2| pages = 27–35| last = Burnett| first = John|author2=Alan Bush | title = Profiling the Yuppies| journal = Journal of Advertising Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was then used to describe a political demographic group of [[social liberalism|socially liberal]] but [[fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]] voters favoring his candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Campaign for President: The Managers Look at '84| first = Jonathan| last = Moore| publisher = Praeger/Greenwood| year = 1986| isbn = 0-86569-132-0| page = 123}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine declared 1984 "The Year of the Yuppie", characterizing the salary range, occupations, and politics of "yuppies" as "demographically hazy".&lt;ref name=Burnett/&gt; The alternative acronym ''yumpie'', for ''young upwardly mobile professional'', was also current in the 1980s but failed to catch on.&lt;ref name=Time2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921621,00.html|title=Here Comes the Yumpies|date=March 26, 1984|work=TIME.com|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1985 issue of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Theressa Kersten at [[SRI International]] described a "yuppie backlash" by people who fit the demographic profile yet express resentment of the label: "You're talking about a class of people who put off having families so they can make payments on the [[Saab Automobile|SAAB]]s ... To be a Yuppie is to be a loathsome undesirable creature". Leo Shapiro, a [[market research]]er in Chicago, responded, "[[stereotype|Stereotyping]] always winds up being derogatory. It doesn't matter whether you are trying to advertise to farmers, [[Hispanic]]s or Yuppies, no one likes to be neatly lumped into some group."&lt;ref name=Burnett/&gt;

The word lost most of its political connotations and, particularly after the [[Black Monday (1987)|1987 stock market crash]], gained the negative socio-economic connotations that it sports today. On April 8, 1991, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine proclaimed the death of the "yuppie" in a mock [[obituary]].&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;{{Cite news| title = The Birth and – Maybe – Death of Yuppiedom | first = Walter | last = Shapiro | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972695-1,00.html | accessdate = 2007-04-28 | work=Time | date=April 8, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The derogatory sense of the word is largely rooted in the perception of what it means to be young and professional, as being a professional usually takes years of development in addition to education, therefore the term connotes an artificial professional. Used in the vernacular of working young people, the term lends to those that dress professionally and have a college education paid for by their parents. They carry themselves with a pompous attitude that is a symptom of an entitlement mentality, which they developed from never actually earning anything. The entitlement mentality is a psychological disorder similar to narcissism.  They are also the so-called "daddy-welfare" people. 

The term has experienced a resurgence in usage during the 2000s and 2010s. In October 2000, [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] remarked in a ''[[Weekly Standard]]'' article that [[Benjamin Franklin]] – due to his extreme wealth, cosmopolitanism, and adventurous social life – is "Our Founding Yuppie".&lt;ref name=founding&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Protected/Articles/000/000/011/743hxgre.asp |first=David |last=Brooks |title=Our Founding Yuppie |date=October 23, 2000 |access-date=August 21, 2010 |work=The Weekly Standard |authorlink=David Brooks (journalist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent article in ''Details'' proclaimed "The Return of the Yuppie", stating that "the yuppie of 1986 and the yuppie of 2006 are so similar as to be indistinguishable" and that "the yup" is "a shape-shifter... he finds ways to reenter the American psyche."&lt;ref name=details&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.details.com/culture-trends/critical-eye/200611/the-return-of-the-yuppie?currentPage=1|work=Details |title=The Return of the Yuppie |first=Jeff |last=Gordinier|access-date=August 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[Victor Davis Hanson]] wrote in ''[[National Review]]'' very critically of "yuppies".&lt;ref name=VDH/&gt;

==Usage outside the United States==
"Yuppie" was in common use in Britain from the early 1980s onwards (the [[premiership of Margaret Thatcher]]) and by 1987 had spawned subsidiary terms used in newspapers such as "yuppiedom", "yuppification", "yuppify" and "yuppie-bashing".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Algeo |first1=John |last2=Algeo |first2=Adele S. |date=July 30, 1993 |title=Fifty Years Among the New Words: A Dictionary of Neologisms 1941–1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-44971-7|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3x-umCIwEYQC&amp;pg=PA228 228]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A September 2010 article in ''[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]'' described the items on a typical Hong Kong resident's "yuppie wish list" based on a survey of 28- to 35-year-olds. About 58% wanted to own their own home, 40% wanted to [[Investing|professionally invest]], and 28% wanted to become a boss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]] |date=September 8, 2010 |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=102699&amp;sid=29504212&amp;con_type=1|title=Homes, cash top fairy tales on yuppie wish list |first=Natalie|last=Wong}}&lt;/ref&gt; A September 2010 article in ''The New York Times'' defined as a hallmark of Russian "yuppie life" adoption of [[yoga]] and other elements of [[Culture of India|Indian culture]] such as their [[Clothing in India|clothes]], [[Indian cuisine|food]], and furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/world/europe/15iht-moscow.html |title=Russians Embrace Yoga, if They Have the Money |date=September 14, 2010|work=The New York Times |first=Sophia |last=Kishkovsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ziona has built a four-storied mansion, a concrete structure, which appears like a boarding house, to accommodate his large family.&lt;ref name= Gregory/&gt; The house is called the "''Chhuan Thar Run''" or the House of the New Generation and is located in the mountainous village of Baktawng.&lt;ref name=Academy/&gt; There is also a 'Khualbuk' or a guesthouse to accommodate visitors coming to the village.&lt;ref name=Marry/&gt; Ziona has a double bedroom in the ground floor of this mansion and his wives take turns to sleep with him according to a roster. His younger wives stay close to his room on the same floor and there are always seven to eight wives attending to his needs during the day. All older wives live in the dormitories on the first floor of the mansion, while his younger wives live on the ground floor. His wives claim that there is no rivalry among them.&lt;ref name= Gregory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Record/&gt;&lt;ref name=Academy/&gt; All his wives claim to love him. His 40th wife is Madam Siamthangi who is proud to be Ziona's wife even though he is much older than her. She is 30 years old (as of 2012) and has a five-year-old daughter by him. Of his 39 wives, 22 are below the age of 40 and they get a week to spend with him.&lt;ref name=Koh&gt;{{Cite news|last=Koh|first= Maureen |url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20120220-329009.html|title=Wife No.39 is 'luckiest woman in the world'|date=21 February 2012|newspaper=Asiaone}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has 26 sons-in-law and his daughters live separately with their families. He says that he has named all his children and grandchildren and he remembers the names of every member of his family.&lt;ref name=Koh/&gt;

Ziona's family is self-reliant, growing crops for their food requirements. He has also established a school for his children, and his younger brother looks after its functioning. Though teaching in the school is based on a curriculum prescribed by the government, he has added some subjects specific to his Chana sect. He does not seek any assistance from the government.&lt;ref name=Eat&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20120220-329009/2.html|title=They eat 100kg of rice a day|newspaper=Asiaone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ziona's wives do the cooking, and his daughters attend to cleaning of the house and take care of washing laundry. Men of the family attend to livestock rearing, agriculture ([[jhum cultivation]]), small cottage industries of wood furniture (carpentry), aluminum utensil making, and so forth.&lt;ref name=Marry&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/Mizoram-man-with-39-wives-raring-to-marry-again/articleshow/21260695.cms|title=Mizoram man with 39 wives raring to marry again|date=23 July 2013|newspaper=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Record/&gt;&lt;ref name=Koh/&gt;

Daily family life in his house begins at 5.50 AM when all family members assemble for prayers and thereafter daily duties are assigned. Prayers and meals are held in a large hall in the mansion. Dinner is served from 4 to 6 PM in the order of age, and the day comes to a close with everyone retiring for the night by 9PM when the lights are switched off.&lt;ref name=Eat/&gt;

An enormous amount of food is prepared to feed the family: {{convert|220|lb}} of rice, {{convert|132|lb}} of potatoes and 39 chickens.&lt;ref name=Record/&gt;&lt;ref name=Academy/&gt;&lt;ref name="Inc.2013"/&gt;{{clarify |date=August 2016 |reason= per what amount of time?}}

Ziona's 68th birthday was celebrated on 21 July 2013 with 150 guests.&lt;ref name=Marry/&gt;

''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'', while recording Ziona's family as the largest living family in the world, observed: "It's a safe bet that Ziona Chana would not be impressed watching ''19 Kids and Counting'' or ''Sister Wives''. The 66-year-old Indian man has 39 wives, 94 children and 33 grandchildren."&lt;ref name=Story/&gt;

Ziona is interested in having more wives, even from the United States.&lt;ref name=Academy/&gt;
