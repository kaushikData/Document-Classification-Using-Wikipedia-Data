'''Alfred Cyril Ewing''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|uː|ɪ|ŋ}}; 11 May 1899 – 14 May 1973), usually cited as '''A. C. Ewing''', was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[philosopher]] and a sympathetic critic of [[idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds and Eidinow 2001, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ewing studied at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], where he gained the John Locke Lectureship and the Green Prize in Moral Philosophy. He taught for four years in Swansea/Wales, and became lecturer in Moral Science at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] in 1931, based at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge|Trinity Hall]], and reader in Moral Science in 1954. He was an Honorary Fellow of [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], and one of [[Wittgenstein]]'s foremost critics. He was responsible for [[Karl Popper]]'s invitation to Cambridge.

==Philosophical work==
Ewing believed that the study of the [[history of philosophy]] was important to philosophical practice, and paid particular attention to this in his studies of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].

He was a defender of [[traditional metaphysics]] (as opposed to [[Postmodernism|post-modern ethics]]) and developed what has been termed an "[[analytic idealism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Beaney (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of the History of Analytic Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 5. n. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a 20th-century pioneer in the [[philosophy of religion]], one of the foremost analysts of the concept "good", and a distinguished contributor to justificatory theorizing about [[punishment]].

He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1941 to 1942, and he was made a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1941.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17382">{{redirect|Afford|other meanings|Afford (disambiguation)}}'''Affordance''' is what the environment offers the individual. [[James J. Gibson]], coined the term in his 1966 book, ''The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems'',&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Gibson (1966). ''The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems''. Allen and Unwin, London.&lt;/ref&gt; and it occurs in many of his earlier essays (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Gibson (1975). 'Affordances and behavior'. In E. S. Reed &amp; R. Jones (eds.), ''Reasons for Realism: Selected Essays of James J. Gibson'', pp. 410-411. Lawrence Erlbaum, Hillsdale, NJ, 1 edn.&lt;/ref&gt;). However, his best-known definition is taken from his seminal 1979 book, ''The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception'':{{Quote|The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill. The verb to afford is found in the dictionary, the noun affordance is not. I have made it up. I mean by it something that refers to both the environment and the animal in a way that no existing term does. It implies the complementarity of the animal and the environment.|Gibson (1979, p. 127)&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Gibson (1979). ''The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception''. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH), Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The original definition in psychology includes all transactions that are possible between an individual and their environment. When the concept was applied to design, it started also referring to only those physical action possibilities of which one is aware.

The word is used in a variety of fields: [[perceptual psychology]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[Environmental Psychology|environmental psychology]], [[industrial design]], [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI), [[interaction design]], [[user-centered design]], [[communication studies]], [[instructional design]], [[science, technology and society]] (STS), [[sports science]] and [[artificial intelligence]].

== Original development ==
Psychologist [[James J. Gibson]] developed the concept of affordance over many years, culminating in his final book ''The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception''&lt;ref name=Gibson1979&gt;[[James J. Gibson]] (1979), ''The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception'', {{ISBN|0-89859-959-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1979. He defined an affordance as what the environment provides or furnishes the animal. Notably, Gibson compares an affordance with an [[ecological niche]] emphasizing the way niches characterize how an animal lives in its environment. An affordance is independent of an individual's ability to recognize it or even take advantage of it, and so, should not be confused with a privately perceived world or a [[phenomenology of perception]]. The key to understanding affordance is that it is relational and characterizes the suitability of the environment to the observer, and so, depends on their current intentions and their capabilities. For instance, a set of steps which rises four feet high does not afford climbing to the crawling infant, yet might provide rest to a tired adult or the opportunity to move to another floor for an adult who wished to reach an alternative destination. This notion of intention/needs is critical to an understanding of affordance, as it explains how the same aspect of the environment can provide different affordances to different people, and even to the same individual at another point in time. As Gibson puts it, “Needs control the perception of affordances (selective attention) and also initiate acts.”&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Gibson (1982). Reasons for Realism: Selected Essays of James J. Gibson. Resources for Ecological Psychology. L. Erlbaum, New Jersey. p.411&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson's is the prevalent definition in cognitive psychology.

According to Gibson, humans tend to alter and modify their environment so as to change its affordances to better suit them. On his view, humans change the environment to make it easier to live in (even if making it harder for other animals to live in it): to keep warm, to see at night, to rear children, and to move around. This tendency to change the environment is natural to humans, and Gibson argues that it is a mistake to treat the social world apart from the material world or the tools apart from the natural environment. He points out that manufacturing was originally done by hand as a kind of manipulation.

Gibson argues that learning to perceive an affordance is an essential part of socialization. The theory of affordances introduces a "value-rich ecological object".&lt;ref  name=Gibson1979 /&gt; Affordances cannot be described within the value-neutral language of physics, but rather introduces notions of benefits and injuries to someone. An affordance captures this beneficial/injurious aspect of objects and relates them to the animal for whom they are well/ill-suited. During childhood development, a child learns to perceive not only the affordances for the self, but also how those same objects furnish similar affordances to another. A child can be introduced to the conventional meaning of an object by manipulating which objects command attention and demonstrating how to use the object through performing its central function.&lt;ref name=Williams&amp;Costall2000&gt;Emma Williams and Alan Costall (2000), ''Taking Things More Seriously: Psychological Theories of Autism and the Material-Social Divide'', {{ISBN|0-415-16704-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By learning how to use an artifact, a child “enters into the shared practices of society” as when they learn to use a toilet or brush their teeth.&lt;ref name=Williams&amp;Costall2000 /&gt; And so, by learning the affordances, or conventional meaning of an artifact, children learn the artifact's social world and further, become a member of that world.

Affordances were further studied by [[Eleanor J. Gibson]], wife of [[James J. Gibson]], who created her theory of perceptual learning around this concept. Her book, ''An Ecological Approach to Perceptual Learning and Development'', explores affordances further.

[[Jakob von Uexküll]] had already discussed the concept in the early twentieth century,&lt;ref&gt;Uexküll, Jakob von (1980 [1920 etc.]), ''{{lang|de|Kompositionslehre der Natur}}'', edited by Thure von Uexküll, Frankfurt am Main.&lt;/ref&gt; calling it the "functional tinting" (''{{lang|de|funktionale Tönung}}'') of organisms with respect to stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Foray Into the Worlds of Animals and Humans: With a Theory of Meaning |author =Dorion Sagan |editor1=Jakob von Uexküll |editor2=Marina von Uexküll |editor3=Joseph D. O'Neil |chapter=Introduction: ''Umwelt'' after Uexküll  |page=5 |isbn=9781452903798 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ADSDl6_SeW8C&amp;pg=PA5 |edition = Joseph D O'Neil translation of 1940 |year=2010 |quote=Organisms in their life-worlds recognize not only sensory inputs, but also functional tones, the use they need to make of certain stimuli if they are to do what they need to survive.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson, Yamagishi and Karavia (2002) found that merely looking at an object primes the human brain to perform the action the object affords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1098/rspb.2002.1998 |title= Attentional processes link perception and action |year= 2002 |last1= Anderson |first1= S. J. |last2= Yamagishi |first2= N. |last3= Karavia |first3= V. |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume= 269 |issue= 1497 |pages= 1225|pmc= 1691021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As perceived action possibilities ==
In 1988, [[Donald Norman]] appropriated the term ''affordances'' in the context of [[Human-machine interaction|human–machine interaction]] to refer to just those action possibilities that are readily perceivable by an actor. This new definition of "action possibilities" has now become synonymous with Gibson's work, although Gibson himself never made any reference to action possibilities in any of his writing.&lt;ref&gt;R. Osborne (2015). An ecological approach to educational technology: affordance as a design tool for aligning pedagogy and technology. Ph.D. thesis.&lt;/ref&gt; Through Norman's book ''[[The Design of Everyday Things]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Norman]], ''[[The Design of Everyday Things]],'' {{ISBN|0-465-06710-7}}, originally published under the title ''The Psychology of Everyday Things'' (often abbreviated to ''POET'')&lt;/ref&gt; this interpretation was popularized within the fields of [[Human-Computer Interaction|HCI]], [[interaction design]], and [[user-centered design]]. It makes the concept dependent not only on the physical capabilities of an actor, but also on their goals, beliefs, and past experiences. If an actor steps into a room containing an armchair and a [[softball]], Gibson's original definition of affordances allows that the actor may throw the chair and sit on the ball, because this is objectively possible. Norman's definition of (perceived) affordances captures the likelihood that the actor will sit on the armchair and throw the softball. Effectively, Norman's affordances "suggest" how an object may be interacted with. For example, the size, shape and weight of a softball make it perfect for throwing by humans, and it matches their past experience with similar objects. The focus on perceived affordances is much more pertinent to practical [[design]] problems {{why|date=February 2017}}, which may explain its widespread adoption.

Norman later explained that this restriction of the term's meaning had been unintended, and that he would replace it by "perceived affordance" in any future revision of the book.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Norman|Donald A. Norman]] (1999). Affordance, Conventions and Design. ''Interactions'' 6(3):38-43, May 1999, ACM Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/affordance_conv.html Affordance, Conventions and Design (Part 2)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the definition from his book has been widely adopted in HCI and interaction design, and both meanings are now commonly used in these fields.

Following Norman's adaptation of the concept, ''affordance'' has seen a further shift in meaning where it is used as an [[uncountable noun]], referring to the easy discoverability of an object or system's action possibilities, as in "this button has good affordance".&lt;ref name="preece-1994" /&gt; This in turn has given rise to a use of the verb ''afford'' – from which Gibson's original term was derived – that is not consistent with its dictionary definition (to provide or make available): designers and those in the field of HCI often use ''afford'' as meaning "to suggest" or "to invite".&lt;ref name="lidwell-2003" /&gt;

The different interpretations of affordances, although closely related, can be a source of confusion in writing and conversation if the intended meaning is not made explicit and if the word is not used consistently. Even authoritative textbooks can be inconsistent in their use of the term.&lt;ref name="preece-1994"&gt;''Human–Computer Interaction'', Preece et al. (1994, p. 6): The authors explicitly define perceived affordances as being a subset of all affordances, but another meaning is used later in the same paragraph by talking about "good affordance."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lidwell-2003"&gt;''Universal Principles of Design'', Lidwell, Holden &amp; Butler (2003, p. 20): The authors first explain that round wheels are better suited for rolling than square ones and therefore better afford (i.e. allow) rolling, but later state that a door handle "affords" (i.e. suggests) pulling, but not pushing.&lt;/ref&gt;

When affordances are used to describe [[information and communications technology]] (ICT) an analogy is created with everyday objects with their attendant features and functions.&lt;ref name=Faraj&amp;Azad2012&gt;Faraj, S., &amp; Azad, B. (2012). The Materiality of Technology: an Affordance Perspective. In ''Materiality and Organizing: Social Interaction in a Technological World''. {{ISBN|9780199664054}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, ICT's features and functions derive from the product classifications of its developers and designers. This approach emphasizes an artifact’s convention to be wholly located in how it was designed to be used. In contrast, affordance theory draws attention to the fit of the technology to the activity of the user and so lends itself to studying how ICTs may be appropriated by users or even misused.&lt;ref name=Faraj&amp;Azad2012/&gt; One meta-analysis reviewed the evidence from a number of surveys about the extent to which the Internet is transforming or enhancing community. The studies showed that the internet is used for connectivity locally as well as globally, although the nature of its use varies in different countries. It found that internet use is adding on to other forms of communication, rather than replacing them.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Wellman, Anabel Quan-Haase, Jeffrey Boase, Wenhong Chen, Keith Hampton, Isabel Diaz de Isla and Kakuko Miyata. 2003. [ [http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol8/issue3/wellman.html] "The Social Affordances of the Internet for Networked Individualism."] ''Journal of Computer Mediated Communication'' 8, 3 (April)&lt;/ref&gt;

== False affordances ==
William Gaver&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1145/108844.108856 |chapter=Technology affordances |title=Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems Reaching through technology - CHI '91 |year=1991 |last1=Gaver |first1=William W. |isbn=0897913833 |pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; divided affordances into three categories: perceptible, hidden, and false.

* A '''false affordance''' is an apparent affordance that does not have any real function, meaning that the actor perceives nonexistent possibilities for action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/affordances.html "Affordances"]&lt;/ref&gt; A good example of a false affordance is a [[placebo button]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://architectures.danlockton.co.uk/2008/10/01/placebo-buttons-false-affordances-and-habit-forming/ "Placebo buttons, false affordances and habit-forming"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A '''hidden affordance''' indicates that there are possibilities for action, but these are not perceived by the actor. For example, it is not apparent from looking at a shoe that it could be used to open a wine bottle.
* For an affordance to be '''perceptible''', there is information available such that the actor perceives and can then act upon the existing affordance.

This means that, when affordances are perceptible, they offer a direct link between perception and action, and, when affordances are hidden or false, they can lead to mistakes and misunderstandings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13244">The '''argument from beauty''' (also the '''aesthetic argument''') is an argument for the existence of a realm of immaterial ideas or, most commonly, for the [[existence of God]].

Plato argued there is a transcendent plane of abstract ideas, or universals, which are more perfect than real-world examples of those ideas.  Later philosophers connected this plane to the idea of goodness, beauty, and then the Christian God.

Various observers have also argued that the experience of beauty is evidence of the existence of a universal God. Depending on the observer, this might include artificially beautiful things like music or art, natural beauty like landscapes or astronomical bodies, or the elegance of abstract ideas like the laws of mathematics or physics.

The best-known defender of the aesthetic argument is [[Richard Swinburne]].

==History of the argument from Platonic universals==

The argument from beauty has two aspects. The first is connected with the independent existence of what philosophers term a "universal" (see [[Universal (metaphysics)]] and also [[Problem of universals]]). [[Plato]] argued that particular examples of, say a [[circle]], all fall short of the perfect exemplar of a circle that exists outside the realm of the senses as an eternal Idea. Beauty for Plato is a particularly important type of universal. Perfect beauty exists only in the eternal Form of beauty  (see [[Platonic epistemology]]). For Plato the argument for a timeless idea of beauty does not involve so much whether the gods exist (Plato was not a monotheist) but rather whether there is an immaterial realm independent and superior to the imperfect world of sense. Later Greek thinkers such as [[Plotinus]] (c. 204/5–270 CE) expanded Plato's argument to support the existence of a totally transcendent "One", containing no parts. Plotinus identified this "One" with the concept of "Good" and the principle of "Beauty". [[Christianity]] adopted this Neo-Platonic conception and saw it as a strong argument for the existence of a supreme [[God]]. In the early fifth century, for example, [[Augustine of Hippo]] discusses the many beautiful things in nature and asks "Who made these beautiful changeable things, if not one who is beautiful and unchangeable?"&lt;ref&gt;''Sermons of St. Augustine'', 241, Easter: c.411 CE&lt;/ref&gt; This second aspect is what most people today understand as the argument from beauty.

==Richard Swinburne==

A contemporary British philosopher of religion, [[Richard Swinburne]], known for philosophical arguments about the existence of God, advocates a variation of the argument from beauty:

{{quote|God has reason to make a basically beautiful world, although also reason to leave some of the beauty or ugliness of the world within the power of creatures to determine; but he would seem to have overriding reason not to make a basically ugly world beyond the powers of creatures to improve. Hence, if there is a God there is more reason to expect a basically beautiful world than a basically ugly one. A priori, however, there is no particular reason for expecting a basically beautiful rather than a basically ugly world. In consequence, if the world is beautiful, that fact would be evidence for God's existence. For, in this case, if we let k be 'there is an orderly physical universe', e be 'there is a beautiful universe', and h be 'there is a God', P(e/h.k) will be greater than P(e/k)... Few, however, would deny that our universe (apart from its animal and human inhabitants, and aspects subject to their immediate control) has that beauty. Poets and painters and ordinary men down the centuries have long admired the beauty of the orderly procession of the heavenly bodies, the scattering of the galaxies through the heavens (in some ways random, in some ways orderly), and the rocks, sea, and wind interacting on earth, ''[[The Spacious Firmament on High|The spacious firmament on high, and all the blue ethereal sky]]'', the water lapping against 'the old eternal rocks', and the plants of the jungle and of temperate climates, contrasting with the desert and the Arctic wastes. Who in his senses would deny that here is beauty in abundance? If we confine ourselves to the argument from the beauty of the inanimate and plant worlds, the argument surely works." &lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, Richard, ''The Existence of God'', OUP, 2nd Edition, 2004, {{ISBN|0199271682}}. {{page needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Art as a route to God==

The most frequent invocation of the argument from beauty today involves the aesthetic experience one obtains from great literature, music or art.  In the concert hall or museum one can easily feel carried away from the mundane.  For many people this feeling of transcendence approaches the religious in intensity.  It is a commonplace to regard concert halls and museums as the cathedrals of the modern age because they seem to translate beauty into meaning and transcendence.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

[[Dostoevsky]] was a proponent of the transcendent nature of beauty. His enigmatic statement: "Beauty will save the world" is frequently cited.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], ''[[The Idiot]]''. {{page needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] in his [[Nobel Prize]] lecture reflected upon this phrase:

{{quote|And so perhaps that old trinity of Truth and Good and Beauty is not just the formal outworn formula it used to seem to us during our heady, materialistic youth. If the crests of these three trees join together, as the investigators and explorers used to affirm, and if the too obvious, too straight branches of Truth and Good are crushed or amputated and cannot reach the light—yet perhaps the whimsical, unpredictable, unexpected branches of Beauty will make their way through and soar up to that very place and in this way perform the work of all three. And in that case it was not a slip of the tongue for Dostoyevsky to say that "Beauty will save the world" but a prophecy. After all, he was given the gift of seeing much, he was extraordinarily illumined. And consequently perhaps art, literature, can in actual fact help the world of today.&lt;ref&gt;"Beauty Will Save the World: The Nobel Lecture on Literature" by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his book, ''[[The God Delusion]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] describes the argument thus:

{{quote|Another character in the [[Aldous Huxley]] novel just mentioned proved the existence of God by playing [[Beethoven's string quartet no. 15]] in A minor ('Heiliger Dankgesang') on a gramophone. Unconvincing as that sounds, it does represent a popular strand of argument. I have given up counting the number of times I receive the more or less truculent challenge: 'How do you account for [[Shakespeare]], then?' (Substitute [[Schubert]], [[Michelangelo]], etc. to taste.) The argument will be so familiar, I needn’t document it further. But the logic behind it is never spelled out, and the more you think about it the more vacuous you realize it to be. Obviously [[Beethoven]]'s late quartets are sublime. So are [[Shakespeare's sonnets]]. They are sublime if God is there and they are sublime if he isn't. They do not prove the existence of God; they prove the existence of Beethoven and of Shakespeare. A great conductor is credited with saying: 'If you have [[Mozart]] to listen to, why would you need God?'&lt;ref name=Dawkins110&gt;Dawkins, Richard, ''The God Delusion'', (Mariner Books:2008), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Philosophical basis of science and mathematics==

Exactly what role to attribute to [[Mathematical beauty|beauty in mathematics]] and science is hotly contested, see [[Philosophy of mathematics]]. The argument from beauty in science and mathematics is an argument for [[philosophical realism]] against [[nominalism]]. The debate revolves around the question, "Do things like scientific laws, numbers and sets have an independent 'real' existence outside individual human minds?". The argument is quite complex and still far from settled. Scientists and philosophers often marvel at the congruence between [[patterns in nature|nature and mathematics]]. In 1960 the Nobel Prize–winning physicist and mathematician [[Eugene Wigner]] wrote an article entitled "[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]". He pointed out that "the enormous usefulness of mathematics in the natural sciences is something bordering on the mysterious and that there is no rational explanation for it."&lt;ref&gt;"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences," in ''[[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]]'', vol. 13, No. I (February 1960).&lt;/ref&gt; In applying mathematics to understand the natural world, scientists often employ aesthetic criteria that seem far removed from science. [[Einstein]] once said that "the only physical theories that we are willing to accept are the beautiful ones."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Graham Farmelo, ''It Must be Beautiful: Great Equations of Modern Science'' (Granta Books, 2002), p. xii. Farmelo provides an extensive discussion of this topic and gives numerous examples from the history of science.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, beauty can sometimes be misleading; [[Thomas Huxley]] wrote that "Science is organized common sense, where many a beautiful theory was killed by an ugly fact."&lt;ref name=Stewart278&gt;Quoted in [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)]], ''Why Beauty is Truth'' (Basic Books, 2007), p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

When developing hypotheses, scientists use beauty and elegance as valuable selective criteria. The more beautiful a theory, the more likely is it to be true. The mathematical physicist [[Hermann Weyl]] said with evident amusement, "My work has always tried to unite the true with the beautiful and when I had to choose one or the other, I usually chose the beautiful."&lt;ref name=Stewart278/&gt; The quantum physicist [[Werner Heisenberg]] wrote to Einstein, "You may object that by speaking of simplicity and beauty I am introducing aesthetic criteria of truth, and I frankly admit that I am strongly attracted by the simplicity and beauty of the mathematical schemes which nature presents us."&lt;ref name=Stewart278/&gt;

==Criticisms==

The argument implies beauty is something immaterial instead of being a subjective neurological response to stimuli. Philosophers since [[Immanuel Kant]] increasingly argue that beauty is an artifact of individual human minds.  A 'beautiful' sunset is according to this perspective aesthetically neutral in itself.  It is our cognitive response that interprets it as 'beautiful.' Others would argue that this cognitive response has been developed through the evolutionary development of the brain and its exposure to particular stimuli over long ages.  Others point to the existence of evil and various types of ugliness as invalidating the argument. [[Joseph McCabe]], a [[freethought]] writer of the early 20th century, questioned the argument in ''The Existence of God'', when he asked whether God also created parasitic microbes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]] (1933), The Existence of God, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] had no trouble seeing beauty in mathematics but he did not see it as a valid argument for the existence of God. In the Study of Mathematics, he wrote: "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand (1919). "The Study of Mathematics". Mysticism and Logic: And Other Essays. Longman. p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also wrote: "My conclusion is that there is no reason to believe any of the dogmas of traditional theology and, further, that there is no reason to wish that they were true. Man, in so far as he is not subject to natural forces, is free to work out his own destiny. The responsibility is his, and so is the opportunity." &lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand "Is There a God?" (1952: repr. ''The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell, Volume 11: Last Philosophical Testament'', 1943-68, ed. John G Slater and Peter Köllner (London: Routledge, 1997), pp. 543–48&lt;/ref&gt;  [[H. L. Mencken]] stated that humans have created things of greater beauty when he wrote, "I also pass over the relatively crude contrivances of this Creator in the aesthetic field, wherein He has been far surpassed by man, as, for example, for adroitness of design, for complexity or for beauty, the sounds of an orchestra."&lt;ref&gt;''Minority Report'', H. L. Mencken's Notebooks, Knopf, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Dawkins summarises the argument as: "How dare another human being make such beautiful music/poetry/art when I can't? It must be God that did it".&lt;ref name=Dawkins110/&gt;

'''Athol Williams''' (born 20 June 1970) is an award-winning [[South African]] poet and [[Social philosophy|social philosopher]].  From 2009 to 2014, Williams published his poetry under the pseudonym AE Ballakisten.

== Life and career ==

Williams was born in [[Lansdowne, Cape Town|Lansdowne]], Cape Town, South Africa and grew up in [[Mitchells Plain]], the [[coloured]] township established under [[apartheid]]. Before becoming a professional writer and social philosopher, he worked in business for fifteen years, mainly as a strategy advisor.

Williams is the first person to earn five master's degrees from five global top-ranked universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/sa-poet-receives-masters-degrees-from-fifth-top-university-10319886|title=SA poet receives Master's degrees from fifth top university {{!}} Cape Times|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a bachelor's degree from the [[University of the Witwatersrand]],&lt;ref name="WITS Review 2012"&gt;WITS Review, January 2012, University of the Witwatersrand&lt;/ref&gt; Williams holds master's degrees from [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], [[London Business School]],&lt;ref&gt;The Plainsman, 17 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afox.ox.ac.uk/news/interview-with-athol-williams/|title=Interview with Athol Williams » Africa Oxford Initiative|website=www.afox.ox.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvard University]] and the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]].&lt;ref name=LSEDigest2013 /&gt; It was at the University of the Witwatersrand, in 1991, that he published his first poem, "New South Africa", in the student publication ''Wits Student''. The poem captured the newfound optimism associated with the release from prison of [[Nelson Mandela]] and other anti-apartheid leaders in 1990.&lt;ref name="WITS Review 2012"/&gt;

He is the co-founder of Read to Rise,&lt;ref name="read_Read" /&gt; an NGO that promotes youth literacy by making appropriate books available to children in poor communities.

== Work ==

Williams's poetry typically addresses two broad themes, namely social justice or a mix of mysticsm and inspiration. The philosophies expressed in his poetry echoes the concerns and dreams for human greatness found in the writings of [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]], [[H. G. Wells]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]].  His more recent writings paint images of hope, offering poignant insight into the path that humanity can follow to find harmony.  "Light on man's condition, man's spirit, the purpose of my writing," he wrote in "A Consecration".{{sfn|Ballakisten|2009|p=11}}

== Reviews ==

* "An energy pervades this book, a raw, shocking energy.  In an age when intellectual robots are in danger of taking over the world of poetry, here's something hauntingly different, something savage and visceral and human, a cry we cannot ignore.  There's no danger of not knowing what's going on in these poems, poems such as where to start, a straight-talking, hard-hitting, political poem of the first order" - [[Gabriel Rosenstock]]
* "Athol Williams’s writing is viscerally engaging. It brings the reader into the sensory configuration of the world he inhabits with his metaphors like living members of an extended family.

'''Avishai Margalit''' ({{lang-he-n|אבישי מרגלית}}, b. 1939 in [[Afula]], [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]] - today [[Israel]]) is an Israeli [[Professor Emeritus]] in [[philosophy]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. From 2006 to 2011, he served as the [[George F. Kennan]] Professor at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]].

==Early life and education==
Avishai Margalit grew up in [[Jerusalem]]. He was educated in Jerusalem and did his army service in the airborne [[Nahal]]. In 1960 he started his studies at the Hebrew University, majoring in philosophy and economics. He earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1963 and his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in philosophy in 1965, his M.A. thesis focusing on [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of labor. During his years of study he worked as an instructor in a youth village, working with immigrant children who arrived with the mass wave of immigration in the 1950s. Thanks to a British Council scholarship he went to [[The Queen's College, Oxford|Queens College]] in [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], where he stayed from 1968 to 1970. His doctoral [[dissertation]], "The Cognitive Status of Metaphors", written under the supervision of Professor [[Yehoshua Bar-Hillel]], earned him his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] [[Latin honors|''summa cum laude'']] 1970 from the Hebrew University.

==Academic career==
Also in 1970, he started teaching as an assistant professor at the philosophy department of the Hebrew University where he stayed throughout his academic career, climbing the ladder of academic promotions. In 1998-2006 he was appointed the Shulman Professor of Philosophy, and in 2006 he retired as a professor emeritus from the Hebrew University. Since 2006 Margalit has been the George Kennan Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He is also a member of the Center for the Study of Rationality at the Hebrew University.

Avishai Margalit was a visiting Scholar at [[Harvard University]] (1974-5); a Visiting Fellow at [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]] (1979–80); a Visiting Professor at the [[Free University of Berlin]] and a Fellow at the [[Max Planck Institute]], Berlin (1984-5);
a Visiting Fellow at [[St Antony's College, Oxford]] (1990); a Rockefeller Fellow at the Center for Human Values, [[Princeton University]] (1995-6), a Scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation in New York (2001–2002) and Senior Fellow at the Global Law Program at NYU (2004-5). In addition, he held short-term visiting professorships at the Central European University in Prague and at the European University in Florence.

==Academic Research==

===Research Areas and Philosophical Approach===
Avishai Margalit's early research topics included the [[philosophy of language]] and of [[logic]], general [[analytical philosophy]] and the concept of rationality. Gradually he shifted toward social and [[political philosophy]], the [[philosophy of religion]] and culture, and the philosophical implications of social and [[cognitive psychology]].

In the introduction to his book ''The Ethics of Memory'', Margalit offers a distinction between "i.e. philosophy" and "e.g. philosophy". The idea is to distinguish between explicating philosophy, based on conceptual analysis, and exemplifying philosophy, which focuses on real-life examples from history or literature. Without judging between the two, Margalit adopts the second approach. Most of his work since the 1990s reflects this approach to the analysis of philosophical questions.

In contrast to many in the philosophical tradition, who tend to accompany their abstract philosophical discussion with examples that are intentionally artificial or trivial, Margalit often starts from historical examples, whose richness and complexity precede their theoretical conceptualization. Through analyzing these examples he gradually builds up concepts and distinctions that serve him as the philosophical tools needed for the understanding of the phenomena he investigates.

Thus, for example, in his Ethics of Memory he uses the case of an officer who forgets the name of one of his subordinate soldiers who was killed in a heroic battle, as a test-case for discussing the issue of the moral responsibility that attaches to memory, on the one hand, and of the centrality of names in constituting memory, on the other. He also poses the following dilemma: were you a painter, would you prefer your paintings to survive you after your death, even if your name will be forgotten, or would you rather have your name remembered even if none of your paintings survive. Margalit's way of philosophizing reflects historical, literary and cultural insights and concerns that are not ordinarily encountered in philosophical discussions.

===Idolatry===
Written jointly with Margalit's doctoral student [[Moshe Halbertal]],&lt;ref&gt;Idolatry (Harvard University Press), 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
currently a professor of philosophy both at the Hebrew University and at NYU, the book presents the history of the notion of idolatry and discusses its religious and ideological significance and ramifications.  Based largely on the philosophy of language and on the philosophy of Wittgenstein (whom Margalit had studied for many years), the book argues that the critique of ideology finds its first expression in the critique of idolatry. Idolatry, on this view, is not just an error but a sinful error; as such it makes the idolaters miss their life's purposes. Bacon's critique of the tribal gods, and the critique of political ideology in the sense Marx used it, are shown to be the continuation of this move concerning the attitude toward the sinful and sin-causing error.

===The Decent Society===
From [[Plato]] on, political philosophy has dealt with the question of the just society, but not with the question of the decent society. In this book,
&lt;ref&gt;The Decent Society (Harvard University Press, 1996; translated to ten languages)&lt;/ref&gt;
Margalit argues that the pursuit of decency, understood primarily in terms of the absence of humiliation, takes precedence over the pursuit of the ideal of justice.

A decent society, in Margalit's view, is a society whose institutions do not humiliate its members. He presents the logical, moral and cognitive reasons for choosing "philosophica negativa": it is not justice that brings us to politics but injustice – the avoidance of evil rather than the pursuit of the good. In contrast to the elusiveness of the abstract notion of human dignity, the phenomenon of humiliation is tangible and instantly recognizable; so too is the notion of evil associated with it.

In essence, Margalit argues that the ideal of the decent, non-humiliating society is not only more urgent but also a more realistic and achievable ideal than that of the just society. He examines the essential manifestations of the decent society: respect for privacy, full citizenship, full employment, and resisting the trend to replace mechanisms of just distribution with organs of welfare and charity. In the second part of the book Margalit gives an account of institutions that are in particular danger of generating humiliation, like prisons, the security services, the army, and the media.

To a large extent because of its discussion of the idea of humiliation, Margalit's book has become a major source for the study of the notions of human dignity and human respect, which constitute the cornerstones of contemporary ethics, politics and legal theory. The book offers a deep analysis of the entire semantic field of the notions of dignity, respect, self-respect, honor, esteem, and their cognates. Margalit presents a "skeptical" solution to the question of human dignity. Rather than attempting to tie it to a particular characteristic shared by all humans and intrinsically worthy of respect (an attempt he believes has failed in the history of philosophy), Margalit proposes to turn this explanation on its head: the practice of according humans respect, he suggests, precedes the idea of human dignity as a character trait. This move does not evade the problem of human dignity, Margalit argues, but rather it points the way toward salvaging it from the futile and inconclusive metaphysical analysis.

===The Ethics of Memory===
The book
&lt;ref&gt;The Ethics of Memory (Harvard University Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
takes up the question of the duties of memory. While fundamental in the Jewish tradition, the obligation to remember ("zachor") is rarely brought up in philosophical discussions. In general, memory is not regarded as a moral concern: people remember or forget as a matter of fact, and since normally we do not control our memory, theories of ethics do not consider memory a duty. In this book, Margalit explores the evaluative and ethical dimensions of memory both in the private and in the collective spheres.

The question whether we are under a moral obligation to remember (or to forget) certain things is discussed in the book in light of a central distinction Margalit introduces, between ethics and morality. Duties of memory exist, he claims, with regard to our ethical relationships, namely the "thick" relationships we have with the members of our tribe, family, nation and circle of friends – namely, those with whom we have a shared history. Without memory there is no community; memory is a constitutive element in the making of a community.

Our moral relationships, on the other hand, are "thin". Morality regulates the relationships we have with others who are strangers to us and to whom nothing more concrete ties us than our shared humanity. Regarding our moral relationships, Margalit contends, there are no obligations to remember.

One of Margalit's central theses in the book is that a "community of memory", as a political concept, is more significant and weighty than the notion of the nation. Memory forms a large part of our relationships, and a faulty memory damages the quality or strength of our thick relationships. In addition to the large question of the duty to remember, the book takes up a variety of other questions like what is a moral witness, what is a community of memory, how do we remember feelings (as distinct from moods), what is the proper relationship between remembering and forgetting, does remembering aid forgiving or does it rather hinder it, and more. Margalit believes that memory is the key to our ethical relationships, and that communities of memory are built upon a network of divisions of labor for the different representations of memory. These networks are constituted, in part, of particular people who remember the past and whose job it is to deal with it, like historians, archivists and journalists, and also of the idea that the large social network connects us all.

===Occidentalism: the West in the Eyes of its Enemies===
This book, written jointly with the writer and journalist [[Ian Buruma]],
&lt;ref&gt;Occidentalism: the West in the Eyes of its Enemies (New York: the Penguin Press, 2004; translated to sixteen languages)&lt;/ref&gt;
originated in a 2002 article in the New York Review of Books.
Occidentalism is a worldview that influences many, often conflicting, ideologies. As a view about the West and about Western civilization, it is infused with strong elements of de-humanization: the western man, on this view, is a machine-like creature. He is efficient yet soul-less, emotionally obtuse and led by a perverse value system.
The novelty in the book is its claim that the occidental worldview is itself rooted in the West. It emerges, the authors argue, out of the Romantic Movement, especially in its German version, later to be taken up by the Slavophil movement. In the 20th century it can be traced to fascism – prominently in its German and Japanese varieties – on the one hand, and to communist Maoism on the other. Nowadays it is political Islam that is thoroughly imbued with a particularly pernicious version of Occidentalism. In it, the additional idea is found, that the West, via its representatives who are currently ruling many Moslem countries, is the carrier of a new Jahiliyya – namely, ignorance and barbarism of the sort that ruled the world before the evangelical mission of the prophet Mohamed.

===On Compromise and Rotten Compromises===
The book
&lt;ref&gt;
On Compromise and Rotten Compromises, Princeton University Press, 2009.
&lt;/ref&gt;
deals with political compromises: what compromises are morally acceptable and what are to be rejected as unacceptable, or "rotten". The argument of the book assigns great value to the spirit of compromise in politics, while warning against rotten ones. A rotten compromise is taken to be a compromise with a regime that exercises inhuman policies, namely systematic behavior that mixes cruelty with humiliation or and treats humans as inhuman.

The book examines central historical examples, like the Great Compromise that paved the way for the [[United States Constitution|US constitution]], which accepted the [[Slavery in the United States|institution of slavery]] despite its inhuman, cruel and humiliating nature. Other test cases include the [[Munich Agreement|Munich agreement]] and the [[Yalta Conference|Yalta agreement]] – working from the assumption that WWII is a sort of laboratory for testing out our moral-political concepts and intuitions. The forced return by the Allies of the Russian POWs to [[Joseph Stalin]]'s hands served in the book as a paradigm case of a rotten compromise.

On Compromise focuses on the tension between peace and justice, and warns against seeing these two as complementary products, like fish and chips. The author claims that compromise is justified for the sake of peace, sometimes even at the expense of justice. Yet rotten compromises, totally unjustifiable that they are, are to be avoided come what may.

===On Betrayal===

In On Betrayal,
&lt;ref&gt;
On Betrayal (Harvard University Press, 2017)
&lt;/ref&gt;
, Margalit argues for and investigates the persistent
significance of betrayal. He identifies four main types of betrayal,
belonging to four spheres of human experience: political betrayal (treason),
personal betrayal (adultery), religious betrayal (apostasy), and betrayal of
one's class. The book defends the significance of the concept of betrayal
even in modern liberal societies, where treason no longer carries the weight
it once did, where adultery is not a crime, and where apostasy, or changing
one's religious affiliation, is considered a basic right. Building on his
earlier distinction between thick and thin relations, Margalit argues that
betrayal still matters because thick relations still matter and betrayal is
the undermining of thick relations. "The basic claim in the book is that
betrayal is betrayal of a thick human relationship. A thick human
relationship comes very close to what fraternity means. So betrayal is the
flip side of fraternity" (2).

By Margalit analysis, betrayal is a ternary relation, that is a relation
holding between three objects. Thus the standard form of betrayal is: A
betrays B with/to C. For betrayal to occur the relations between A and B
must be thick relations. In cases of double betrayal, the betrayed stands in
thick relations to both the betrayer and the one with whom the betrayal took
place (eg: A betrayed B with her best friend C). Thick political relations
should be based neither on blood, nor on seed, nor on soil, but on shared
historical memory. They consist in "thick trust". Its breach is political
betrayal, or treason. Idolatry is the betrayal of thick relations with god
and apostasy of thick relations with one's religious community.

Thick relations provide individuals with a sense of meaning and belonging,
an orientation in the world, a home. The feature of thick relations which is
eroded by betrayal is belonging, rather than trust. Belonging is not based
on achievement, it is not a possession, but a bond. Betrayal undermines this
bond because it "provides the betrayed party with a good reason to
reevaluate the meaning of the thick relation with the betrayer" (92). But
its ethical significance consists in the kind of reason it provides for this
reevaluation, namely the violation of a commitment. As [[Michael Walzer]]
summarizes in his review of the book, "betrayal isn't leaving a relationship
but breaking it––and breaking it in a way that hurts, that leaves the other
or others vulnerable, frightened, alone, at a loss."

However, not every case of disloyalty toward a thick relation is an instance
of betrayal, only disloyalty to relations deserving of loyalty constitute
betrayal. This gives rise to ambiguities and disagreements. Betrayal,
Margalit says, is an essentially contested concept, "that is to say, in all
its uses the concept of traitor is always subject to dispute along
ideological lines" (24). When an alleged traitor is caught between two
competing deserving loyalties, he will be regarded by one side as a traitor
and by the other as a hero. When one of the loyalties is morally undeserved,
the actor is either an uncontestable hero ([[Willy Brandt]] is an example) or an
uncontestable traitor (eg [[Benedict Arnold]]). Assessments of deservedness can
vary not only across societies, but also within societies. This is often the
case with whistleblowers, like [[Edward Snowden]] and [[Chelsea Manning]], seen by
some as heroes and by others as traitors. The difference between a traitor
worthy of contempt and a whistleblower worthy of applause, Margalit says,
consists in the righteousness of their cause and the purity of their
motives. The fact that both can be mixed and ambiguous explains why public
opinion is often split in such cases.

Besides the four general kinds of betrayal, the book explores specific forms
of potential betrayal, including collaboration with an enemy, class
betrayal, secrecy and hypocrisy. It investigates with nuance complicated
historical cases like [[Josephus Flavius]], [[Willy Brandt]], and [[Marshal Petain]]
("Petain betrayed by trying to form a France that would eradicate the memory
and the legacy of the French Revolution" (215)).

'''Baratham Paadiya Perundevanar''' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: பாரதம் பாடிய பெருந்தேவனார்) was a Medieval [[Tamil language|Tamil]] poet of the 9th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Of the 12,000 verses of the Bharatha Venba, only about 830 remains. Of these 818 were published in 1925 by A. Gopala Iyer. To differentiate Perundevanar from his namesake Sangam poet, he came to be known by the name 'Baratham Paadiya Perundevanar' (Perundevanar who sang Mahabharata). He has reportedly added a God-invoking verse to all the works in [[Ettuthogai]] (the Eight anthologies) of the [[Sangam literature]] and hence has been credited with compiling those works.&lt;ref name="SangaIlakkiyam_3"&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="678">Various [[Theism|theistic]] positions can involve '''belief in a [[God]]''' or "gods". They include:

* [[Henotheism]], belief in the supremacy of one god without denying the existence of others.
* [[Monotheism]], the doctrine or belief that there is only one deity.
* [[Panentheism]], the belief that a deity is a part of the universe as well as transcending it.
* [[Pantheism]],  a doctrine identifying the deity with the universe and its phenomena.
* [[Polytheism]], the worship of or belief in more than one god.

These positions are all contrasted by [[atheism]], the proposition that there are no deities.

'''David Braine''' (1940 – 17 February 2017&lt;ref name="Fimister2017"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2017/03/27/obituary-david-braine-leading-catholic-philosopher-who-battled-disability/|title=Obituary: David Braine, leading Catholic philosopher who battled disability |work=Catholic Herald|date=27 March 2017|access-date=31 March 2017|last=Fimister|first=Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a British [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosopher with interests in analytic [[Philosophy of religion]] and [[Metaphysics]], who sought to marry the techniques and insights of analytical philosophy and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] to the [[Metaphysics]] of classical [[Thomism]]. His ''The Reality of Time and the Existence of God'' set out to prove the existence of God from the fact that the world enjoys continuity in time. He argued that nothing in the world could be the cause of this continuity, whence God came into the picture. 

His book ''The Human Person: Animal and Spirit'' attempts to provide a philosophical analysis of human beings which makes life after death possible.&lt;ref name="Cooper2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=John W. Cooper|title=Body, Soul, and Life Everlasting: Biblical Anthropology and the Monism-dualism Debate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_sayR9h3VhcC&amp;pg=PR19|year=2000|publisher=William B.

Due to a car accident in 1977, he became paralysed from the chest down.&lt;ref name="Fimister2017" /&gt; Braine was opposed to the legalisation of euthanasia, and based some of that opposition on his own personal experience of living with a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.scottish.parliament.uk/s3/committees/endLifeAsstBill/evidence/ELA298.pdf |format=PDF |title=End of Life Assistance (Scotland) Bill |last=Braine |first=David |date=11 May 2010 |accessdate=1 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Braine was an important, if insufficiently well-known, contributor to the renaissance of analytical [[Philosophy of religion]].

[[Andreas Capellanus]] was the twelfth century author of a treatise commonly titled '''''De amore''''' ("About Love"), also known as '''''De arte honeste amandi''''', for which a possible English translation is '''''The Art of Courtly Love'''''. His real identity has never been determined, but has been a matter of extended academic debate. Andreas Capellanus is sometimes known by a French translation of his name, ''André le Chapelain''.

== His work ==
''De Amore'' was written sometime between 1186 and 1190. It was most likely intended for the French court of [[Philip Augustus]]. It has been supposed to have been written in 1185 at the request of [[Marie de Champagne]], daughter of King [[Louis VII of France]] and of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]].&lt;ref name="Wilke"&gt;Brian Wilkie and James Hurt, eds. ''Literature of the Western World.'' Vol. 1 5th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A dismissive allusion in the text to the "wealth of Hungary" has suggested the hypothesis that it was written after 1184, at the time when [[Bela III of Hungary]] had sent to the French court a statement of his income and had proposed marriage to Marie's sister [[Margaret of France, Queen of England and Hungary|Marguerite of France]], but before 1186, when his proposal was accepted. 

John Jay Parry, who edited ''De Amore'', has described it as "one of those capital works which reflect the thought of a great epoch, which explains the secret of a civilization."  It may be viewed as didactic, mocking, or merely descriptive; in any event it preserves the attitudes and practices that were the foundation of a long and significant tradition in Western literature.

The social system of "courtly love", as gradually elaborated by the [[Provençal literature|Provençal]] [[troubadour]]s from the mid twelfth-century, soon spread. It is often associated with Eleanor of Aquitaine (herself the granddaughter of an early troubadour poet, [[William IX of Aquitaine]]), but this link has never been verified. It has been proposed that ''De Amore'' codifies the social and sexual life of Eleanor's court at Poitiers between 1169 and 1174 because the author mentions both Eleanor and her daughter Marie by name; but there is no evidence that Marie ever saw her mother again after Eleanor's divorce from Louis VII in 1152.

== Outline of ''De Amore'' ==
The work deals with several specific themes that were the subject of [[poetical debate (Occitan literature)|poetical debate]] among late twelfth century troubadours and [[trobairitz]].
The basic conception of [[Andreas Capellanus|Capellanus]] is that [[courtly love]] ennobles both the lover and the beloved, provided that certain codes of behaviour are respected.  ''De amore'' describes the affection between [[marriage|spouses]] as an unrelated emotion, stating that "love can have no place between husband and wife," although they may feel even "immoderate affection" for one another.  Rather, the most ennobling love is generally secret and extremely difficult to obtain, serving as a means for inspiring men to great deeds.

'''Preface:''' ''De Amore'' begins with a preface (''præfatio''), in which Andreas addresses an unidentified young man named Walter. Though Capellanus' relationship with the young man is unclear, he describes Walter as “a new soldier of love, wounded with a new arrow,” not knowing “how aptly to govern the reins of the horse that soldier himself rides nor to be able to find any remedy [him]self.”&lt;ref name="Andersen-Wyman"&gt;Kathleen Andersen-Wyman: ''Andreas Capellanus on Love?'' New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Capellanus promises to teach Walter, with this book, “the way in which a state of love between two lovers may be kept unharmed, and likewise how those who do not love may get rid of the darts of Venus that are in their hearts.”&lt;ref name="Broadview"&gt;Andreas Capellanus: ''The Art of Courtly Love'' included in ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature, Vol. 1'' Edited by Joseph Black, ''et al''. Toronto: Broadview Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether literal or ironic, Capellanus implies here that he intends to teach the ways of love to his eager disciple.

'''Book I:''' After an introductory analysis of "What love is" (Parry, pp.&amp;nbsp;28–36), Book One of ''De Amore'' sets out a series of nine imaginary dialogues (pp.&amp;nbsp;36–141) between men and women of different social classes, from bourgeoisie to royalty. In each dialogue the man is pleading inconclusively to be accepted as the woman's lover, and in each he finds some small reason for optimism.  The dialogs are delightful compositions, with many well-crafted arguments (albeit based on [[Middle Ages|medieval]] rather than modern concepts) by both the ardent suitor and the skeptical lady; typically, the older man asks to be rewarded for his accomplishments whereas the young men or men of lower birth ask to be given inspiration so that they might accomplish something.  These dialogues are followed by short discussions of love with priests, with nuns, for money, with peasant women, and with prostitutes (pp.&amp;nbsp;141–150).

'''Book II:''' This book takes love as established, and begins with a discussion of how love is maintained and how and why it comes to an end (pp.&amp;nbsp;151–167). Following this comes a series of twenty-one "judgements of love" (pp.&amp;nbsp;167–177), said to have been pronounced in contentious cases by great ladies. Among these, three judgements are attributed to "Queen Eleanor" and another four simply to "the Queen", seven to Eleanor's daughter [[Marie of France, Countess of Champagne|Marie of Troyes]] ("the [[Countess of Champagne]]"), two to Eleanor's niece  [[Isabelle of Vermandois]] ("the [[Countess of Flanders]]", daughter of [[Petronilla of Aquitaine]]), one to "a court of ladies in Gascony", and five to Viscountess [[Ermengarde of Narbonne]], who is thus singled out as the only patron of a "[[Court of Love]]" not belonging to the immediate family of Eleanor of Aquitaine. However, it has been suggested that "the Queen" is not Eleanor but [[Adèle of Champagne]], Eleanor's successor as wife of [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] and [[Queen of France]]. Book Two concludes (pp.&amp;nbsp;177–186) by setting out "The Rules of Love". A few examples of these guidelines are listed below (numbered according to the order found in the original work, which contains thirty-one total):

:1. Marriage is no real excuse for not loving.
:6. Boys do not love until they arrive at the age of maturity.
:8. No one should be deprived of love without the very best of reasons.
:13. When made public love rarely endures.
:14. The easy attainment of love makes it of little value; difficulty of attainment makes it prized.
:20. A man in love is always apprehensive.
:30. A true lover is constantly and without intermission possessed by the thought of his beloved.&lt;ref name="Broadview"/&gt;

'''Book III''': This book is the briefest (pp.&amp;nbsp;187–212), and is titled "The Rejection of Love".  This book seeks to remedy the natural affection of men for women, by painting all women as disgusting as possible in so few words.  For example, women are described as being completely untrustworthy ("everything a woman says is said with the intention of deceiving"), insanely greedy and willing to do anything for food, weak-minded and easily swayed by false reasoning, "slanderers filled with envy and hate," drunkards, loud-mouthed and gossipy, unfaithful in love, disobedient, vain and tortured by envy of all other women's beauty, "even her daughter's."  The historical example of [[Eve]] is cited at several points as evidence. This book is a disclaimer for the rest of the work—as is evidenced by its heading. It includes reasons why love affairs of the sort found in this book should not be conducted, and that personal abstinence from love was the preferred route. Capellanus states that this abstinence  would allow one to “win an eternal recompense and thereby deserve a greater reward from God.”&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;F.X. Newman, ed.: ''The Meaning of Courtly Love.'' Albany: The Research Foundation of State University of New York, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; This last book constitutes one reason not to take the bulk of Capellanus' work at face value.  Though some social practices acceptable during the Middle Ages may be reflected in Capellanus' work, it cannot be clearly demonstrated to be a reliable source on the common medieval attitude to "courtly love."&lt;ref name="Andersen-Wyman"/&gt;

===Sidelights===

''De Amore'' gives a listing of the stages of love, which resembles in some ways the modern [[baseball euphemism]]:

:"Throughout all the ages, there have been only four degrees &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''gradus''] in love:
:"The first consists in arousing hope;
:"The second in offering kisses;
:"The third in the enjoyment of intimate embraces;
:"The fourth in the abandonment of the entire person."

Courtly love is reserved for the middle and upper classes in ''De Amore''.  Attractive peasant girls are to be shunned or, failing this, "embraced by force":

::If you should, by some chance, fall in love with a peasant woman, be careful to puff her up with lots of praise and then, when you find a convenient opportunity, do not hold back but take your pleasure and embrace her by force.  For you can hardly soften their outward inflexibility so far that they will grant you their embraces quietly or permit you to have the solaces you desire unless you first use a little compulsion as a convenient cure for their shyness.  We do not say these things, however, because we want to persuade you to love such women, but only so that, if through lack of caution you should be driven to love them, you may know, in brief compass, what to do. (Parry, p. 150, adapted).

In a similar vein, Andreas describes nuns as easy to seduce, although he condemns anyone who does so as a "disgusting animal." (This caution does not apply to monks or priests.)

'''Eye contact''' occurs when two people look at each other's eyes at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=27365&amp;dict=CALD "Eye contact".] ''Cambridge Advanced Learner’s Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus.'' Retrieved May 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[human beings]], eye contact is a form of [[nonverbal communication]] and is thought to have a large influence on [[social behavior]]. Coined in the early to mid-1960s, the term came from [[Western world|the West]] to often define the act as a meaningful and important sign of confidence, respect, and social communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/eye+contact|title=the definition of eye contact|author=|date=|website=www.dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The customs and significance of eye contact vary between societies, with [[religious]] and social differences often altering its meaning greatly.

The study of eye contact is sometimes known as ''[[oculesics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger (2008), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=6EjuvTDQN9wC|page=6|text=oculesics}} p. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social meanings==

Eye contact and [[facial expression]]s provide important [[social]] and emotional information. People, perhaps without consciously doing so, search other's eyes and faces for positive or negative [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] signs. In some contexts, the meeting of eyes arouses strong emotions.
Eye contact provides some of the strongest emotions during a social conversation. This primarily is because it provides details on emotions and intentions. While someone does not give eye contact it can make someone feel left out from a certain group. While on the other hand prolonged eye contact can tell someone you are interested in what they have to say. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=Jan-Feb 2016|title=Scientific American Mind|url=|journal=Scientific American Mind|volume=27|pages=8 and 9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eye contact is also an important element in [[flirting]], where it may serve to establish and gauge the other's interest in some situations.

Mutual eye contact that signals attraction initially begins as a brief glance and progresses into a repeated volleying of eye contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kearl | first = Mary | title = Psychology of Attraction | publisher = AOL Health | date = November 2008 | url = http://www.aolhealth.com/healthy-living/relationships/what-causes-attraction | accessdate = August 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090606062218/http://www.aolhealth.com/healthy-living/relationships/what-causes-attraction | archivedate = 2009-06-06 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the process of [[civil inattention]], strangers in close proximity, such as a crowd, avoid eye contact in order to help maintain their [[privacy]].

==Effects==

When two or more individuals talk, the person that talks is used to being looked at. Therefore, making eye contact can make other people expect conversation.  Discussing eye contact is actually quite difficult because any attempt to categorize the degree (of sustained contact or measure of directness) and the nature of the eye contact is nearly guaranteed to contain a lot of descriptors derived from one's own cultural predisposition.
===Parent–child===

A 1985 study suggested that "3-month-old infants are comparatively insensitive to being the object of another's visual regard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Samuels CA |title=Attention to eye contact opportunity and facial motion by three-month-old infants |journal=J Exp Child Psychol |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=105–14 |date=August 1985 |pmid=4031786 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0022-0965(85)90067-0 |doi=10.1016/0022-0965(85)90067-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1996 Canadian study with 3 to 6 month old infants found that smiling in infants decreased when adult eye contact was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hains SM, Muir DW |title=Infant sensitivity to adult eye direction |jstor=1131602 |journal=Child Dev |volume=67 |issue=5 |pages=1940–51 |date=October 1996 |pmid=9022223 |doi=10.2307/1131602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent British study in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience found that face recognition by infants was facilitated by direct gaze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Farroni T, Johnson MH, Csibra G |title=Mechanisms of eye gaze perception during infancy |journal=J Cogn Neurosci |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=1320–6 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15509381 |doi=10.1162/0898929042304787 |url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/0898929042304787?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other recent research has confirmed that the direct gaze of adults influences the direct gaze of infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reid VM, Striano T |title=Adult gaze influences infant attention and object processing: implications for cognitive neuroscience |journal=Eur.

Infants prefer to look at faces that engage them in mutual gaze and that, from an early age, healthy babies show enhanced neural processing of direct gaze.&lt;ref name="Eye Contact Detection in Humans From Birth"&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/99/14/9602.full Eye Contact Detection in Humans From Birth], PNAS VOL 99 N.14 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interesting conflict stories from children of Korean immigrants to the United States surround how they manage eye contact with adults. In school, when being reprimanded the teacher might say something to the effect of "Look at me when I'm talking to you." At home, if Mom is doing the reprimanding, making eye contact would make the situation far worse.  In such situations, Korean children are taught to look at the floor so the demands are precisely opposite of what is expected in school.

=== Communicating attention ===
A person's direction of gaze may indicate to others where their [[attention]] lies.

===Facilitating learning===

In the 2000s, studies suggest that eye contact has a positive impact on the retention and recall of information and may promote more efficient learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fullwood C, Doherty-Sneddon G |title=Effect of gazing at the camera during a video link on recall |journal=Appl Ergon |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=167–75 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16081035 |doi=10.1016/j.apergo.2005.05.003 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003-6870(05)00089-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mayer K |title=Fundamentals of surgical research course: research presentations |journal=J.

===Maternal sensitivity===

In a 2001 study conducted in Germany examining German infants during their first 12 weeks of life, researchers studied the relationship between eye contact, maternal sensitivity and infant crying to attempt to determine if eye contact and maternal sensitivity were stable over time. In this correlational study, they began by categorizing the mother’s sensitivity placing them into one of four behavioral categories: inhibited/intense behavior, distortion of infant signals, over and understimulational, and aggressive behavioral. Next, the observer video-taped the mother and infant’s free-play interactions on a weekly basis for 12 weeks. When watching the videos, they measured the mutual eye contact between the mother and the infant by looking at the overlap in time when the mothers looked at their infant’s face and when the infants looked at their mother’s face. The mothers were also asked to record their infant’s crying in a diary.

The study found that the amount of eye contact between the study's German mothers and infants increased continuously over the first 12 weeks. The mother who held eye contact with her child early on (week 1-4) was described as sensitive to her infant whereas if she did not hold eye contact, her behavior was described as insensitive. They also found a negative relationship between eye contact and the duration of crying of the infants; as eye contact increases, crying decreases. Maternal sensitivity was also shown to be stable over time. According to the study, these findings may potentially be based on the assumption that sensitive mothers are more likely to notice their child’s behavioral problems than non-sensitive mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lohaus | first1 = A. | last2 = Keller | first2 = H. | last3 = Voelker | first3 = S. | year = 2001 | title = Relationships between eye contact, maternal sensitivity, and infant crying | url = | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Development | volume = 25 | issue = 6| pages = 542–548 | doi = 10.1080/01650250042000528 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difficulty==

Some people find eye contact difficult with others. For example, those with [[autism spectrum|autistic disorders]] or [[social anxiety disorder|social anxieties]] may find eye contact to be particularly unsettling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iidc.indiana.edu/index.php?pageId=472|title=Should We Insist on Eye Contact with People who have Autism Spectrum Disorders|author=|date=|website=www.iidc.indiana.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strabismus]], especially [[esophoria]] or [[exophoria]], interferes with normal eye contact: a person whose eyes are not aligned usually makes full eye contact with one eye only, while the orientation of the other eye deviates slightly or more.

===Eye aversion and mental processing===

In one study conducted by British psychologists from the [[University of Stirling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Phelps | first1 = F.

While humans obtain useful information from looking at the face when listening to someone, the process of looking at faces is mentally demanding and takes processing. Therefore, it may be unhelpful to look at faces when trying to concentrate and process something else that's mentally demanding.&lt;ref name="aversion"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pupils 'must look away to think'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/4602178.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 March 2007|date=11 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to this, Doherty-Sneddon suggests that a blank [[staring|stare]] indicates a lack of understanding.&lt;ref name="aversion"/&gt;

==Cultural differences==
[[File:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at Columbia 6 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|250px|Two men staring each other in the eye during a political argument]]

In many cultures, such as in [[East Asia]] and Nigeria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Galanti, Geri-Ann |title=Caring for patients from different cultures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVgeOxUL3cYC&amp;pg=PA34 |year=2004 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-1857-2 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is respectful not to look the dominant person in the eye, but in [[Western culture]] this can be interpreted as being "shifty-eyed", and the person judged badly because "he wouldn't look me in the eye"; references such as "shifty-eyed" can refer to suspicions regarding an individual's unrevealed intentions or thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kathane, Raj |title=BMJ Careers: Adapting to British culture |journal=BMJ Careers |volume=328 |issue=7454 |page=273 |date=June 2004 |url=http://careers.bmj.com/careers/advice/view-article.html?id=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the seeking of constant unbroken eye contact by the other participant in a conversation can often be considered overbearing or distracting by many even in western cultures, possibly on an [[eye contact#Between species|instinctive or subconscious level]].

Pious [[Muslims]] aspire to lower their [[gaze]] and look at each other without sexual objectification. Japanese children are taught in school to direct their gaze at the region of their teacher's [[Adam's apple]] or [[necktie|tie knot]]. As adults, Japanese lower their eyes when speaking to a superior as a gesture of respect.&lt;ref name="MoranHarris2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert T. Moran|author2=Philip R.

Some bodies of [[parliamentary procedure]] ban eye contact between members when speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/05/08/404991505/what-eye-contact-and-dogs-can-teach-us-about-civility-in-politics|title=What Eye Contact — And Dogs — Can Teach Us About Civility In Politics|author=|date=|website=npr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical description==
For clinical evaluation purposes in the practice of psychiatry and clinical psychology, as part of a [[mental status exam]], the clinician may describe the initiation, frequency, and quality of eye contact. For example, the doctor may note whether the patient initiates, responds to, sustains, or evades eye contact. The clinician may also note whether eye contact is unusually intense or blank, or whether the patient glares, looks down, or looks aside frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Sommers-Flanagaan &amp; Sommers Flanagan. (2009). Clinical Interviewing. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Between species==

Eye contact can also be a significant factor in interactions between non-human animals, and between humans and non-human animals.

Animals of many species, including dogs, often perceive eye contact as a threat.  Many programs to prevent dog bites recommend avoiding direct eye contact with an unknown dog.&lt;ref name="birthpsychology.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://birthpsychology.com/primalhealth/primal17.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212121743/http://birthpsychology.com/primalhealth/primal17.html|archivedate=12 December 2010|title=Primal Health|author=Michel Odent, M.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report in ''[[The New Zealand Medical Journal]]'',&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10457124"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10457124 |title='Eye contact' likely cause for dog attacks, |author=Booker, Jarrod |date=11 August 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintaining eye contact is one reason young children may be more likely to fall victim to dog attacks.

On the other hand, extended eye contact between a dog and its owner modulates the secretion of [[oxytocin]], a neuromodulator that is known for its role in maternal-infant bonding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Miho Nagasawa |author2=Shouhei Mitsui |author3=Shiori En |author4=Nobuyo Ohtani |author5=Mitsuaki Ohta |author6=Yasuo Sakuma |author7=Tatsushi Onaka |author8=Kazutaka Mogi |author9=Takefumi Kikusui |title=Oxytocin-gaze positive loop and the coevolution of human-dog bonds|journal=Science|date=17 April 2015|volume=348|issue=6232|pages=333–336|doi=10.1126/science.1261022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hikers are commonly advised to avoid direct eye contact if they have surprised a bear, since the bear may interpret the eye contact as a threat,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bears - Glacier National Park|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.nps.gov/glac/naturescience/bears.htm|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some sources suggest maintaining eye contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bear FAQs|publisher=New Hampshire Fish and Game Department|url=http://www.wildlife.state.nh.us/wildlife/faqs-bears.html|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among primates, eye contact is seen as especially aggressive, and staring at them in a zoo can induce agitated behavior. [[Chimpanzee]]s use eye contact to signal aggression in hostile encounters.&lt;ref name="birthpsychology.com" /&gt; Eye tracking research shows that chimps are more likely to look at the mouth, while [[Bonobo|bonobos]] are more likely to look at the eyes; eye contact is lower among socially deprived primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/article/heres-why-eye-contact-is-so-awkward-for-some-people.html|title=Here’s Why Eye Contact Is So Awkward for Some People|last=Ro|first=Christine|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 incident at [[Rotterdam Zoo]] is believed to be connected to eye contact: [[Bokito (gorilla)|Bokito]] the [[gorilla]] escaped from his exhibit and injured a woman who had visited him several times and apparently often held prolonged eye contact. Visitors were later given special glasses that averted their apparent gaze when looking at the gorilla.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.themarysue.com/gorilla-gaze-glasses/&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevance of fake news has increased in [[post-truth politics]]. For media outlets, the ability to attract viewers to their websites is necessary to generate online advertising revenue. If publishing a story with false content attracts users, this benefits advertisers and improves ratings. Easy access to online [[advertisement]] revenue, increased political polarization, and the popularity of [[social media]], primarily the [[Facebook News Feed]],&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt; have all been implicated in the spread of fake news,&lt;ref name=Guardian12.17.16/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian11.11.16&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/29/facebook-fake-news-problem-experts-pitch-ideas-algorithms|title=How to solve Facebook's fake news problem: experts pitch their ideas|last=Woolf|first=Nicky|date=November 11, 2016 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which competes with legitimate news stories.

Fake news undermines serious media coverage and makes it more difficult for journalists to cover significant news stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.univision.com/noticias/america-latina/el-millonario-negocio-detras-de-los-sitios-de-fake-news-en-mexico |title=Millonario negocio FAKE NEWS |author=Carlos Merlo |journal=Univision Noticias |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis by [[BuzzFeed]] found that the top 20 fake news stories about the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]] received more engagement on Facebook than the top 20 election stories from 19 major media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chang, Juju]]; Lefferman, Jake; Pedersen, Claire; Martz, Geoff (November 29, 2016).

During and after his presidential campaign and election, [[Donald Trump]] popularized the term "fake news" when he used it to describe the negative press coverage of himself.&lt;ref name="Lind_5/9/2018"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libraryguides.vu.edu.au/c.php?g=460840&amp;p=5330649|title=Library Guides: Evaluating Information: Fake news in the 2016 US Elections|last=Murphy|first=Jennifer|website=libraryguides.vu.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part as a result of Trump's use of the term, the term has come under increasing criticism, and in October 2018 the British government decided that it will no longer use the term because it is "a poorly-defined and misleading term that conflates a variety of false information, from genuine error through to foreign interference in democratic processes."&lt;ref name="telegraphoct18" /&gt;

Michael Radutzky, a producer of CBS ''[[60 Minutes]]'', said his show considers fake news to be "stories that are provably false, have enormous traction [popular appeal] in the culture, and are consumed by millions of people". These stories are not only found in politics, but also in areas like vaccination, stock values and nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lazer|first=David M.

Guy Campanile, also a ''60 Minutes'' producer said, "What we are talking about are stories that are fabricated out of thin air.

The intent and purpose of fake news is important. In some cases, what appears to be fake news may be [[news satire]], which uses exaggeration and introduces non-factual elements that are intended to amuse or make a point, rather than to deceive. [[Propaganda]] can also be fake news.&lt;ref name=Guardian12.17.16/&gt; Some researchers have highlighted that "fake news" may be distinguished not just by the falsity of its content, but also the "character of [its] online circulation and reception".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bounegru |first1=Liliana |last2=Gray |first2=Jonathan |last3=Venturini |first3=Tommaso |last4=Mauri |first4=Michele |date=January 8, 2018|title=A Field Guide to "Fake News" and Other Information Disorders |url=http://fakenews.publicdatalab.org/ |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Public Data Lab |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# satire or parody ("no intention to cause harm but has potential to fool")
# false connection ("when headlines, visuals or captions don't support the content")
# misleading content ("misleading use of information to [[Spin (public relations)|frame an issue]] or an individual")
# false context ("when genuine content is shared with false contextual information")
# impostor content ("when genuine sources are impersonated" with false, made-up sources)
# manipulated content ("when genuine information or imagery is manipulated to deceive", as with a "doctored" photo)
# fabricated content ("new content is 100% false, designed to deceive and do harm")

In the context of the United States of America and its election processes in the 2010s, fake news generated considerable controversy and argument, with some commentators defining concern over it as [[moral panic]] or [[mass hysteria]] and others worried about damage done to public trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= Shafer|first1= Jack|title= The Cure for Fake News Is Worse Than the Disease|url= http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/the-cure-for-fake-news-is-worse-than-the-disease-214477|accessdate= February 19, 2017|newspaper= [[Politico]]|date= November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= Gobry|first1= Pascal-Emmanuel|title= The crushing anxiety behind the media's fake news hysteria|url= http://theweek.com/articles/666395/crushing-anxiety-behind-medias-fake-news-hysteria|accessdate= February 19, 2017|publisher=[[The Week]] |date= December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Morrissey|first1= Edward|title= The Snarling Contempt of the Media's Fake News Hysteria|url= http://www.realclearpolitics.com/2016/11/24/the_snarling_contempt_of_the_media039s_fake_news_hysteria_396437.html |publisher=[[RealClearPolitics]] |accessdate= February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the United Kingdom [[House of Commons]] conducted a [[Requests and inquiries#Parliamentary inquiry|parliamentary inquiry]] into the "growing phenomenon of fake news".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Some, most notably United States President [[Donald Trump]], have broadened the meaning of "fake news" to include news that was negative of his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cognitive-ability-and-vulnerability-to-fake-news/|title=Cognitive Ability and Vulnerability to Fake News|first=David Z.

In November 2017, Claire Wardle (mentioned above) announced she has rejected the phrase "fake news" and "censors it in conversation", finding it "woefully inadequate" to describe the issues. She now speaks of "information pollution" and distinguishes between three types of problems: 'mis-information', 'dis-information', and 'mal-information':
# [[Misinformation|Mis-information]]: false information disseminated without harmful intent. 
# [[Disinformation|Dis-information]]: created and shared by people with harmful intent.
# Mal-information: the sharing of "genuine" information with the intent to cause harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Giuliani-Hoffman |first=Francesca |date=November 3, 2017 |title='F*** News' should be replaced by these words, Claire Wardle says |url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/11/03/media/claire-wardle-fake-news-reliable-sources-podcast/index.html |work=Money.CNN |access-date=November 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century BC, [[Rameses the Great]] spread lies and propaganda portraying the [[Battle of Kadesh]] as a stunning victory for the Egyptians; he depicted scenes of himself smiting his foes during the battle on the walls of nearly all his temples.

===Medieval===
In 1475, a fake news story in [[Trento|Trent]] claimed that the Jewish community had murdered a two-and-a-half-year-old Christian infant named [[Simon of Trent|Simonino]].&lt;ref name="politico"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/fake-news-history-long-violent-214535|title=The Long and Brutal History of Fake News|newspaper=[[Politico]] Magazine|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story resulted in all the Jews in the city being arrested and tortured; fifteen of them were burned at the stake.&lt;ref name="politico" /&gt; [[Pope Sixtus IV]] himself attempted to stamp out the story, but, by that point, it had already spread beyond anyone's control.&lt;ref name="politico" /&gt; Stories of this kind were known as "[[blood libel]]"; they claimed that Jews purposely killed Christians, especially Christian children, and used their blood for religious or ritual purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/education/resources/glossary-terms/blood-libel|title=Blood Libel: A False, Incendiary Claim Against Jews|website=Anti-Defamation League}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern period===
After the invention of the printing press in 1439, publications became widespread but there was no standard of journalistic ethics to follow. By the 17th century, historians began the practice of citing their sources in [[Note (typography)|footnotes]]. In 1610 when [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] went on trial, the demand for verifiable news increased.&lt;ref name=politico /&gt;

During the 18th century publishers of fake news were fined and banned in the Netherlands; one man, Gerard Lodewijk van der Macht, was banned four times by Dutch authorities—and four times he moved and restarted his press.&lt;ref name=FiveThirtyEight /&gt; In the American colonies, [[Benjamin Franklin]] wrote fake news about murderous "scalping" Indians working with King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] in an effort to sway public opinion in favor of the American Revolution.&lt;ref name=politico /&gt;

[[wikt:canard|Canards]], the successors of the 16th century [[wikt:pasquinade|pasquinade]], were sold in Paris on the street for two centuries, starting in the 17th century.

During the era of slave-owning in the United States, supporters of slavery propagated fake news stories about African Americans, whom white people considered to have lower status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1996/10/thomas-jefferson-radical-and-racist/376685/|title=Thomas Jefferson: Radical and Racist|last=O'Brien|first=Conor Cruise|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=June 29, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence occurred in reaction to the spread of some fake news events.

Rumors and anxieties about slave rebellions were common in Virginia from the beginning of the colonial period, despite the only major uprising occurring in the 19th century. One particular instance of fake news regarding revolts occurred in 1730. The serving governor of Virginia at the time, Governor William Gooch, reported that a slave rebellion had occurred but was effectively put down – although this never happened. After Gooch discovered the falsehood, he ordered slaves found off plantations to be punished, tortured, and made prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/winter05-06/conspiracy.cfm|title=Slave Conspiracies in Colonial Virginia|website=history.org|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First World War]], an example of [[anti-German sentiment|anti-German]] [[atrocity propaganda]] was that of an alleged "[[German Corpse Factory]]" in which the German battlefield dead were rendered down for fats used to make [[nitroglycerine]], candles, lubricants, [[Soap made from human corpses|human soap]], and boot dubbing. Unfounded rumors regarding such a factory circulated in the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] press starting in 1915, and by 1917 the English-language publication ''[[North China Daily News]]'' presented these allegations as true at a time when Britain was trying to convince China to join the Allied war effort; this was based on new, allegedly true stories from ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' that turned out to be forgeries. These false allegations became known as such after the war, and in the [[Second World War]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] used the story in order to [[Holocaust denial|deny the ongoing massacre of Jews]] as British propaganda. According to [[Joachim Neander]] and [[Randal Marlin]], the story also "encouraged later disbelief" when reports about the Holocaust surfaced after the liberation of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] and [[Dachau concentration camp]]s.&lt;ref name="BBC fake news"&gt;{{cite news|title=The corpse factory and the birth of fake news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38995205|accessdate=March 5, 2017 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]" is a 1938 episode of the American [[radio drama]] anthology series ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]''. Directed and narrated by actor and filmmaker [[Orson Welles]], the episode was an adaptation of [[H. G. Wells]]' novel ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' (1898), presented as a series of simulated news bulletins. Although preceded by a clear introduction that the show was a drama, it became famous for allegedly causing mass panic, although the reality of the panic is disputed as the program had relatively few listeners. An investigation was run by The Federal Communications Commission to examine the mass hysteria produced by this radio programming; no law was found broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/welles-scares-nation|title=Welles scares nation|last=|first=|date=|publisher=history.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event was an example the early stages of society's dependency on information from print to radio and other mediums. Fake news can even be found within this example, the true extent of the "hysteria" from the radio broadcast has also been falsely recorded.

The opening of the Internet to the people in the 90s was a movement meant to allow them access to information.

21st century fake news is often intended to increase the financial profits of the news outlet. In an interview with [[NPR]], Jestin Coler, former CEO of the fake media conglomerate [[Denver Guardian|Disinfomedia]], said who writes fake news articles, who funds these articles, and why fake news creators create and distribute false information. Coler, who has since left his role as a fake news creator, said that his company employed 20 to 25 writers at a time and made $10,000 to $30,000 monthly from advertisements.

When I said that comment it was because I was confused how this evil got elected President and I thought maybe instead of hurting his campaign, maybe I had helped it. My intention was to get his supporters NOT to vote for him and I know for a fact that I accomplished that goal.

Kim LaCapria of the fact checking website [[Snopes.com]] has stated that, in America, fake news is a bipartisan phenomenon, saying that "[t]here has always been a sincerely held yet erroneous belief misinformation is more [[Red states and blue states|red than blue in America]], and that has never been true."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tait|first1=Amelia |date=February 9, 2016 |title=The May Doctrine |postscript=. published online February 11, 2017 as "Fake news is a problem for the left, too". |newspaper=[[New Statesman]] |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2017/02/fake-news-problem-left-too|accessdate=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeff Green (businessman)|Jeff Green]] of [[Trade Desk]] agrees the phenomenon affects both sides.

{{quotebox|
"On Twitter, a network of Trump supporters consumes the largest volume of junk news, and junk news is the largest proportion of news links they share," the researchers concluded. On Facebook, the skew was even greater. There, "extreme hard right pages – distinct from Republican pages – share more junk news than all the other audiences put together."&lt;ref name="Hern_2/6/2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Hern | first=Alex | title=Fake news sharing in US is a rightwing thing, says study | website=The Guardian | date=February 6, 2018 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/06/sharing-fake-news-us-rightwing-study-trump-university-of-oxford | access-date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Their findings showed that Trump supporters and older Americans (over 60) were far more likely to consume fake news than Clinton supporters. Those most likely to visit fake news websites were the 10% of Americans who consumed the most [[Conservatism|conservative]] information. There was a very large difference (800%) in the consumption of fake news stories as related to total news consumption between Trump supporters (6.2%) and Clinton supporters (0.8%).&lt;ref name="Guess_Nyhan_Reifler_1/9/2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarlin_1/14/2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Sarlin | first=Benjy | title='Fake news' went viral in 2016.

The study also showed that fake pro-Trump and fake pro-Clinton news stories were read by their supporters, but with a significant difference: Trump supporters consumed far more (40%) than Clinton supporters (15%). Facebook was by far the key "gateway" website where these fake stories were spread, and which led people to then go to the fake news websites. [[Fact checking|Fact checks]] of fake news were rarely seen by consumers,&lt;ref name="Guess_Nyhan_Reifler_1/9/2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarlin_1/14/2018"/&gt; with none of those who saw a fake news story being reached by a related fact check.&lt;ref name="Poynter_1/3/2018"&gt;{{cite web | title=Fake news and fact-checking websites both reach about a quarter of the population – but not the same quarter | website=Poynter Institute | date=January 3, 2018 | url=https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking-research-database/fake-news-and-fact-checking-websites-both-reach-about-quarter | access-date=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brendan Nyhan]], one of the researchers, emphatically stated in an interview on NBC News: "People got vastly more misinformation from Donald Trump than they did from fake news websites – full stop."&lt;ref name="Sarlin_1/14/2018"/&gt;
{{quotebox|
NBC NEWS: "It feels like there's a connection between having an active portion of a party that's prone to seeking false stories and conspiracies and a president who has famously spread conspiracies and false claims. In many ways, demographically and ideologically, the president fits the profile of the fake news users that you're describing."

NYHAN: "It's worrisome if fake news websites further weaken the norm against false and misleading information in our politics, which unfortunately has eroded. But it's also important to put the content provided by fake news websites in perspective. People got vastly more misinformation from Donald Trump than they did from fake news websites – full stop."&lt;ref name="Sarlin_1/14/2018"/&gt;}}

Another issue in mainstream media is the usage of the [[filter bubble]], a "bubble" that has been created that gives the viewer, on social media platforms, a specific piece of the information knowing they will like it. Thus creating fake news and biased news because only half the story is being shared, the portion the viewer liked. "In 1996, Nicolas Negroponte predicted a world where information technologies become increasingly customizable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spohr|first=Dominic|title=Fake news and ideological polarization|journal=Business Information Review|volume=34|issue=3|pages=150–160|doi=10.1177/0266382117722446|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decades ago people predicted that customized news would become a reality. This becomes a problem in today's society because people are seeing only bits and pieces and not the whole issues making it much harder to solve the issues or talk about it worldwide.

====Bots on social media====
In the mid 1990s, [[Nicholas Negroponte|Nicolas Negroponte]] anticipated a world where news through technology become progressively personalized. In his 1996 book&amp;nbsp;''Being Digital''&amp;nbsp;he predicted a digital life where news consumption becomes an extremely personalized experience and newspapers adapted content to reader preferences. This prediction has since been reflected in news and social media feeds of modern day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spohr|first=Dominic|date=August 23, 2017|title=Fake news and ideological polarization|journal=Business Information Review|volume=34|issue=3|pages=150–160|doi=10.1177/0266382117722446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bots have the potential to increase the spread of fake news, as they use algorithms to decide what articles and information specific users like, without taking into account the authenticity of an article. Bots mass-produce and spread articles, regardless of the credibility of the sources, allowing them to play an essential role in the mass spread of fake news, as bots are capable of creating fake accounts and personalities on the web that are then gaining followers, recognition, and authority. Additionally, almost 30% of the spam and content spread on the Internet originates from these software bots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burkhardt|first=Joanna M.|date=2017|title=Can Technology Save Us?|url=https://login.libproxy.scu.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1967322547?accountid=13679.|journal=Library Technology Reports|volume=53|pages=14|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, the capacity to mislead was enhanced by the widespread use of social media.

Researchers from [[Stanford]] assessed that only 8% of readers of fake news recalled and believed in the content they were reading, though the same share of readers also recalled and believed in "placebos" – stories they did not actually read, but that were produced by the authors of the study. In comparison, over 50% of the participants recalled reading and believed in true news stories.&lt;ref name="Allcott"/&gt;

By August 2017 Facebook stopped using the term "fake news" and used "false news" in its place instead. Will Oremus of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' wrote that because supporters of [[U.S. President]] [[Donald Trump]] had redefined the word "fake news" to refer to mainstream media opposed to them, "it makes sense for Facebook—and others—to cede the term to the right-wing trolls who have claimed it as their own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oremus, Will|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2017/08/08/facebook_has_stopped_saying_fake_news_is_false_news_any_better.html|title=Facebook Has Stopped Saying "Fake News"|publisher=''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''|date=August 8, 2017|accessdate=August 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research from [[Northwestern University]] concluded that 30% of all fake news traffic, as opposed to only 8% of real news traffic, could be linked back to Facebook. Fake news consumers, they concluded, do not exist in a [[filter bubble]]; many of them also consume real news from established news sources. The fake news audience is only 10 percent of the real news audience, and most fake news consumers spent a relatively similar amount of time on fake news compared with real news consumers—with the exception of [[Drudge Report]] readers, who spent more than 11 times longer reading the website than other users.&lt;ref name=ColumbiaJReview&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cjr.org/analysis/fake-news-facebook-audience-drudge-breitbart-study.php|title=Is 'fake news' a fake problem?|newspaper=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of western events, China's Ren Xianling of the [[Cyberspace Administration of China]] suggested a "reward and punish" system be implemented to avoid fake news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-internet-idUSKBN13F01K|title=China says terrorism, fake news impel greater global internet curbs|date=November 20, 2016|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Internet trolls ====
In [[Internet slang]], a [[Internet troll|troll]] is a person who sows discord on the [[Internet]] by starting arguments or upsetting people, by posting inflammatory, [[wikt:Extraneous#Adjective|extraneous]], or [[off-topic]] messages in an online community (such as a [[newsgroup]], forum, [[chat room]], or blog) with the intent of provoking readers into an [[emotion]]al response or off-topic discussion, often for the troll's amusement. The term troll alludes back to a monster that hides in the shadows and threatens people. Internet trolls also feed on attention.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stein|first=Joel|date=August 2016|title=How Trolls Are Ruining the Internet|url=http://libraryproxy.tulsacc.edu:2076/ehost/detail/detail?vid=4&amp;sid=dd6805bc-c41e-45e6-a288-a838d36989d8%40sessionmgr4006&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=117537299&amp;db=aph|journal=Time.com|volume=|pages=106|via=Ebscohost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of internet trolls gained popularity in the 1990s, though its meaning shifted in 2011. Whereas it once denoted provocation, it is a term now widely used to signify the abuse and misuse of the Internet.  Trolling comes in various forms, and can be dissected into abuse trolling, entertainment trolling, classical trolling, flame trolling, anonymous trolling, and kudos trolling.  It is closely linked to fake news, as internet trolls are now largely interpreted as perpetrators of false information, information that can often be passed along unwittingly by reporters and the public alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Binns|first=Amy|date=August 2012|title=Don't Feed the Trolls!|url=|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=6|pages=547–562|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/10/26/499442453/the-twitter-paradox-how-a-platform-designed-for-free-speech-enables-internet-tro|title=The Twitter Paradox: How A Platform Designed For Free Speech Enables Internet Trolls|last=Gross|first=Terry|date=October 2016|website=NPR|access-date=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When interacting with each other, trolls often share misleading information that contributes to the fake news circulated on sites like [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://time.com/4457110/internet-trolls/|title=How Trolls Are Ruining the Internet|last=Steain|first=Joel|date=August 18, 2016|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2016 American election, Russia paid over 1,000 internet trolls to circulate fake news and disinformation about [[Hillary Clinton]], and they also had the power to create social media accounts that resembled voters in important swing states that spread influential political standpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-bots-still-interfering-in-u-s-politics-after-election-expert|title=Russian bots still interfering in U.S. politics after election, says expert witness|last=Watson|first=Kathryn|date=March 30, 2017|publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, [[Google]] launched Google News Initiative (GNI) to fight the spread of fake news. It launched GNI under the belief that quality [[journalism]] and identifying truth online is crucial. GNI has three goals: “to elevate and strengthen quality journalism, evolve business models to drive sustainable growth and empower news organizations through technological innovation.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/20/google-300-million-towards-fighting-fake-news/%20http://g.co/newsconsumerinsights|title=Google puts $300 million towards fighting fake news|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve the first goal, Google created the Disinfo Lab, which combats the spread of fake news during crucial times such as elections or breaking news. The company is also working to adjust its systems to display more trustworthy content during times of breaking news. To make it easier for users to subscribe to media publishers, Google created Subscribe with Google. Additionally, they have created a dashboard,  News Consumer Insights that allows news organizations to better understand their audiences using data and analytics. Google will spend $300 million through 2021 on these efforts, among others, to combat fake news.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Usage of the term by Donald Trump===

President Trump has claimed that the mainstream American media regularly reports fake news. His doing so is seen as having increased distrust of the American media globally, particularly in Russia. His claims have given credibility to the stories in the Russian media that label American news, especially news about atrocities committed by the Syrian regime against its own people, where it was quoted that "munitions at the air base had as much to do with chemical weapons as the test tube in the hands of Colin Powell had to do with weapons of mass destruction in Iraq", as just more fake American news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/16/business/media/vladimir-putin-moscow-press-trump.html|title=A Lesson in Moscow About Trump-Style 'Alternative Truth'|last=Rutenberg|first=Jim|date=April 16, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jeff Hemsley, a [[Syracuse University]] professor who studies social media, Trump uses this term for any news that is not favorable to him or which he simply dislikes.&lt;ref name="Gendreau_2/25/2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Gendreau | first=Henri | date=February 25, 2017 | title=The Internet Made 'Fake News' a Thing—Then Made It Nothing | website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | url=https://www.wired.com/2017/02/internet-made-fake-news-thing-made-nothing/ | accessdate=May 9, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump provided a widely cited&lt;ref name="Cillizza_5/9/2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lind_5/9/2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chait_5/9/2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bump_5/9/2018"/&gt; example of this interpretation in a tweet on May 9, 2018:

[[Chris Cillizza]] described the tweet on CNN as an "accidental" revelation about Trump's "'fake news' attacks", and wrote: "The point can be summed up in these two words from Trump: 'negative (Fake).'

Author and literary critic [[Michiko Kakutani]] has described developments in the right-wing media and websites:
{{quotebox| "FOX News and the planetary system of right-wing news sites that would orbit it and, later, Breitbart, were particularly adept at weaponizing such arguments and exploiting the increasingly partisan fervor animating the Republican base: They accused the media establishment of “liberal bias,” and substituted their own right-wing views as “fair and balanced” – a redefinition of terms that was a harbinger of Trump’s hijacking of “fake news” to refer not to alt-right conspiracy theories and Russian troll posts, but to real news that he perceived as inconvenient or a threat to himself."&lt;ref name="Woods_6/20/2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Woods | first=Sean | title=Michiko Kakutani on Her Essential New Book 'The Death of Truth' | website=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=June 20, 2018 | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/michiko-kakutani-on-her-essential-new-book-the-death-of-truth-666137/ | access-date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In September 2018, [[National Public Radio]] noted that Trump has expanded his use of the terms "fake" and "phony" to "an increasingly wide variety of things he doesn't like": "The range of things Trump is declaring fake is growing too. Last month he tweeted about "fake books," "the fake dossier," "fake CNN," and he added a new claim – that Google search results are "RIGGED" to mostly show only negative stories about him." They graphed his expanding use in columns labeled: "Fake news", "Fake (other), and "Phony".&lt;ref name="Keith_9/4/2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Keith | first=Tamara | title=President Trump's Description of What's 'Fake' Is Expanding | website=[[NPR]] | date=September 2, 2018 | url=https://www.npr.org/2018/09/02/643761979/president-trumps-description-of-whats-fake-is-expanding | access-date=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the term===

Because of the manner in which Trump has co-opted the term, ''[[Washington Post]]'' media columnist [[Margaret Sullivan]] has warned fellow journalists that "It's time to retire the tainted term 'fake news'. Though the term hasn't been around long, its meaning already is lost."&lt;ref name="Gendreau_2/25/2017"/&gt;

In October 2018, the British government decided that the term "fake news" will no longer be used in official documents because it is "a poorly-defined and misleading term that conflates a variety of false information, from genuine error through to foreign interference in democratic processes." This followed a recommendation by the [[House of Commons]]' [[Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee]] to avoid the term.&lt;ref name="telegraphoct18"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/10/22/government-bans-phrase-fake-news/|title=Government bans phrase 'fake news'|first=Margi|last=Murphy|date=October 23, 2018|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fake news by country ==
=== Australia ===
A well-known case of fabricated news in [[Australia]] happened in 2009 when a report ''Deception Detection Across Australian Populations'' of a "Levitt Institute" was widely cited on the news websites all over the country, claiming that [[Sydney]] was the most naive city, despite the fact that the report itself contained a cue: amidst the mathematical gibberish, there was a statement: "These results were completely made up to be fictitious material through a process of modified truth and credibility nodes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s2698835.htm "Deception Detection Deficiency"], ''Media Watch'', episode 34, September 28, 2009, [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC TV]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Australian Parliament initiated investigation into "fake news" regarding issues surrounding fake news that occurred during the 2016 United States election. The inquiry looks at a few major areas in Australia to find audiences most vulnerable to fake news, by considering the impact on traditional journalism, and by evaluating the liability of online advertisers and by regulating the spreading the hoaxes. This act of parliament is meant to combat the threat of social media power on spreading fakes news as concluded negative results to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Remeikis, A. (2017).

=== Austria ===
Politicians in Austria dealt with the impact of fake news and its spread on social media after the 2016 presidential campaign in the country. In December 2016, a court in Austria issued an injunction on Facebook Europe, mandating it block negative postings related to [[Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek]], [[Austrian Green Party]] Chairwoman. According to ''The Washington Post'' the postings to Facebook about her "appeared to have been spread via a fake profile" and directed derogatory epithets towards the Austrian politician.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kirchner, Stephanie (December 14, 2016), [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/12/14/menace-of-fake-news-is-rattling-politicians-in-austria-and-germany "Menace of fake news is rattling politicians in Austria and Germany"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', retrieved December 14, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The derogatory postings were likely created by the identical fake profile that had previously been utilized to attack [[Alexander van der Bellen]], who won the election for [[President of Austria]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Brazil ===
Brazil faced increasing influence from fake news after the [[Brazilian general election, 2014|2014 re-election]] of President [[Dilma Rousseff]] and [[Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff|Rousseff's subsequent impeachment]] in August 2016. BBC Brazil reported in April 2016 that in the week surrounding one of the impeachment votes, three out of the five most-shared articles on Facebook in Brazil were fake. In 2015, reporter Tai Nalon resigned from her position at Brazilian newspaper ''[[Folha de S Paulo]]'' in order to start the first fact-checking website in Brazil, called Aos Fatos (To The Facts). Nalon told ''[[The Guardian]]'' there was a great deal of fake news, and hesitated to compare the problem to that experienced in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Guardian12.2.16&gt;Kate Connolly; Angelique Chrisafis; Poppy McPherson; Stephanie Kirchgaessner; Benjamin Haas; Dominic Phillips; Elle Hunt (December 2, 2016).

=== Canada ===
Fake news online was brought to the attention of Canadian politicians in November 2016, as they debated helping assist local newspapers. Member of [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] for [[Vancouver Centre]] [[Hedy Fry]] specifically discussed fake news as an example of ways in which publishers on the Internet are less accountable than print media. Discussion in parliament contrasted increase of fake news online with downsizing of Canadian newspapers and the impact for democracy in Canada. Representatives from Facebook Canada attended the meeting and told members of Parliament they felt it was their duty to assist individuals gather data online.&lt;ref&gt;Cheadle, Bruce (November 17, 2016), [http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/as-fake-news-spreads-mps-consider-importance-of-canada-s-local-papers-1.3165962 "As fake news spreads, MPs consider importance of Canada's local papers"], ''[[CTV News]]'', [[The Canadian Press]], retrieved December 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the [[Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, 2017|Conservative leadership campaign]] of [[Kellie Leitch]] admitted to spreading fake news, including false claims that [[Justin Trudeau]] was financing [[Hamas]]. The campaign manager claimed he spread the news in order to provoke negative reactions so that he could determine those who "aren't real Conservatives".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/inside-nick-kouvaliss-fake-news-strategy/ "Inside Nick Kouvalis's fake news strategy"].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Czech Republic ===

Czech Republic has become home to numerous fake news outlets, many redistributing news in Czech and English originally produced by Russian sources. Czech president [[Miloš Zeman]] has been supporting media outlets accused of spreading fake news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/beyond-brussels/138638|title=Business booming in Czech fake news industry|accessdate=July 31, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CTHH started operations on January 1, 2017. The CTHH has been criticized by Czech President [[Miloš Zeman]], who said: "We don't need censorship. We don't need thought police. We don't need a new agency for press and information as long as we want to live in a free and democratic society."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.skynews.com.au/news/world/europe/2017/01/02/czech-republic-open-centre-to-fight-fake-news.html Czech Republic open centre to fight fake news]".

Fake news during the 2016 U.S. election spread to China. Articles popularized within the United States were translated into Chinese and spread within China.&lt;ref name=Guardian12.2.16/&gt; The [[government of China]] used the growing problem of fake news as a rationale for increasing [[Internet censorship in China]] in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Orlowski, Andrew (November 21, 2016), [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/11/21/china_cites_trump_to_justify_fake_news_clampdown_surprised/ "China cites Trump to justify 'fake news' media clampdown.

China government leaders meeting in [[Wuzhen]] at the third [[World Internet Conference]] in November 2016 said fake news in the U.S. election justified adding more curbs to free and open use of the Internet. China Deputy Minister Ren Xianliang, official at the [[Cyberspace Administration of China]], said increasing online participation led to "harmful information" and fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Pascaline, Mary (November 20, 2016), [http://www.ibtimes.com/facebook-fake-news-stories-china-calls-more-censorship-internet-following-social-2448774 "Facebook Fake News Stories: China Calls For More Censorship On Internet Following Social Media's Alleged Role In US Election"], ''[[International Business Times]]'', retrieved November 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Kam Chow Wong, a former [[Hong Kong]] law enforcement official and criminal justice professor at [[Xavier University]], praised attempts in the U.S. to patrol social media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/11/17/after-trump-americans-want-facebook-and-google-to-vet-news-china-likes-that-plan/ "After Trump, Americans want Facebook and Google to vet news.

The issue of fake news in the 2016 United States election has given the Chinese Government a reason to further criticize Western democracy and press freedom. The Chinese government has also accused Western media organisations of bias, in a move apparently inspired by President Trump.&lt;ref name="NYT Hernandez 2017-05-07"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/world/asia/china-fake-news-xie.html |title=China's Response to Reports of Torture: 'Fake News' |last=Hernández |first=Javier C. |date=March 3, 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=July 13, 2017|quote=Trump's attacks on the media will offer a good excuse for Chinese officials to step up their criticism of Western democracy and press freedom ...

In March 2017, the ''[[People's Daily]]'', a newspaper run by the ruling [[Communist Party of China]] denounced news coverage of the torture of Chinese lawyer and human rights advocate Xie Yang, claiming it to be fake news.&lt;ref name="NYT Hernandez 2017-05-07" /&gt; The newspaper published a [[Twitter]] post declaring that "Foreign media reports that police tortured a detained lawyer is FAKE NEWS, fabricated to tarnish China's image". The state-owned [[Xinhua News Agency]] claimed that "the stories were essentially fake news". The Chinese government has often accused Western news organizations of being biased and dishonest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/world/asia/china-fake-news-xie.html|title=China's Response to Reports of Torture: 'Fake News'|last=Hernández|first=Javier C.|date=March 3, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=May 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese government also claimed that there are people who pose as journalists that spread negative information on social media in order to extort payment from their victims to stop doing so. David Bandurski of University of Hong Kong's China Media Project has said that this issue has continued to worsen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 28, 2014 |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/03/28/china-targets-fake-news/ |title=China's Big Problem With 'Fake News' |publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' China Real Time Report blog |accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland ===
Officials from 11 countries met in [[Helsinki]] in November 2016 to plan the formation of a center to combat disinformation cyber-warfare, which includes the spread of fake news on social media. The center is planned to be located in Helsinki and combine efforts from 10 countries, including Sweden, Germany, Finland, and the U.S. [[Prime Minister of Finland]] [[Juha Sipilä]] planned to address the topic of the center in Spring 2017 with a motion before  [[Parliament of Finland|Parliament]].

Deputy Secretary of State for EU Affairs Jori Arvonen said cyber-warfare, such as hybrid cyber-warfare intrusions into Finland from Russia and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]], became an increased problem in 2016. Arvonen cited examples including online fake news, disinformation, and the [[Little green men (Ukrainian crisis)|little green men troops]] of the [[Ukrainian crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/helsinki_to_host_hub_aimed_at_curbing_cyber_warfare_threats/9307244 "Helsinki to host hub aimed at curbing cyber warfare threats"], ''[[Yle]]'', November 21, 2016, retrieved December 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
During the 10-year period preceding 2016, France was witness to an increase in popularity of [[far-right]] alternative news sources called the ''fachosphere'' ("facho" referring to [[fascist]]); known as the {{ill|extreme right on the Internet|fr|Extrême droite sur Internet}}.&lt;ref name=Guardian12.2.16/&gt; According to sociologist Antoine Bevort, citing data from [[Alexa Internet]] rankings, the most consulted political websites in France in 2016 included ''[[Égalité et Réconciliation]]'', ''{{ill|François Desouche|fr}}'', and ''Les Moutons Enragés''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bivort|first1= Antoine |date=October 21, 2016|url=https://blogs.mediapart.fr/antoine-bevort/blog/211016/les-trente-sites-politiques-francais-ayant-le-plus-d-audience-sur-le-web-0|title=Les trente sites politiques français ayant le plus d'audience sur le Web|publisher=''Mediapart''|accessdate= December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bevort, |first=Antoine |date=December 1, 2016 |url=https://blogs.mediapart.fr/antoine-bevort/blog/011216/fake-traffic-quelle-fiabilite-pour-le-classement-des-sites-socio-politiques |title="Fake Traffic" ?

In September 2016, the country faced controversy regarding fake websites providing false information about [[abortion]]. The [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] moved forward with intentions to ban such fake sites. [[Laurence Rossignol]], women's minister for France, informed parliament though the fake sites look neutral, in actuality their intentions were specifically targeted to give women fake information.

==== 2017 presidential election ====
France saw an uptick in amounts of disinformation and propaganda, primarily in the midst of election cycles.

=== Germany ===
[[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] lamented the problem of fraudulent news reports in a November 2016 speech, days after announcing her campaign for a fourth term as leader of her country. In a speech to the German parliament, Merkel was critical of such fake sites, saying they harmed political discussion. Merkel called attention to the need of government to deal with [[Internet troll]]s, bots, and fake news websites. She warned that such fraudulent news websites were a force increasing the power of [[Populism|populist]] extremism. Merkel called fraudulent news a growing phenomenon that might need to be regulated in the future. Germany's foreign intelligence agency [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|Federal Intelligence Service]] Chief, [[Bruno Kahl]], warned of the potential for [[cyberattacks]] by Russia in the [[German federal election, 2017|2017 German election]]. He said the cyberattacks would take the form of the intentional spread of disinformation. Kahl said the goal is to increase chaos in political debates. Germany's domestic intelligence agency [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] Chief, [[Hans-Georg Maassen]], said sabotage by Russian intelligence was a present threat to German [[information security]].&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, Jason (November 30, 2016), [http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/russian-hackers-may-disrupt-germanys-2017-election-warns-spy-chief-1594221 "Russian hackers may disrupt Germany's 2017 election warns spy chief"], ''[[International Business Times|International Business Times UK edition]]'', retrieved December 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The German term ''[[Lying press|Lügenpresse]]'', or lying press, has been used since the 19th century as a strategy to attack news spread by political opponents from the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

On November 8, 2016, India established a [[Indian 2000-rupee note|2,000-rupee currency bill]] on the same day as the [[Indian 500 and 1,000 rupee note demonetisation]].

Prabhakar Kumar of the Indian media research agency CMS, told ''[[The Guardian]]'' India was harder hit by fake news because the country lacked media policy for verification. Law enforcement officers in India arrested individuals with charges of creating fictitious articles, predominantly if there was likelihood the articles inflamed societal conflict.

In April 2018, the Information and Broadcasting Ministry said the government would cancel the accreditation of journalists found to be sharing fake news, but this was quickly retracted after criticism that this was an attack on [[freedom of the press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://in.reuters.com/article/india-fakenews/india-drops-plan-to-punish-journalists-for-fake-news-following-outcry-idINKCN1HB0DA|title=India drops plan to punish journalists for 'fake news' following...|first=Manoj|last=Kumar|publisher=|accessdate=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
Recently, Indonesia has seen an increase in the amount of fake news circulating social media. The problem first arose during their [[Indonesian presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential election]], where candidate [[Jokowi]] became a target of a smear campaign which falsely claimed he was the child of Indonesian Communist Party members, of Chinese descent, and a Christian.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kwok|first1=Yenni|title=Where Memes Could Kill: Indonesia's Worsening Problem of Fake News|url=http://time.com/4620419/indonesia-fake-news-ahok-chinese-christian-islam/|website=Time.com|accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the 2016 U.S. presidential election, where the sharing of fake news resulted in increased social-media engagement than real news, inflaming ethnic and political tensions could be potentially deadly in Indonesia, with its recent incidences of domestic terrorism, and its long and bloody history of anticommunist, anti-Christian and anti-Chinese pogroms.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; The government, watchdog groups, and even religious organizations have taken steps to prevent its spreading, such as blocking certain websites and creating fact-check apps. The largest Islamic mass organization in Indonesia, [[Nahdlatul Ulama]], has created an anti-fake news campaign called #TurnBackHoax, while other Islamic groups have defined such propagation as tantamount to a sin.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; While the government currently views criminal punishment as its last resort, officials are working hard to guarantee law enforcement will respect the freedom of expression.

The Palestinian Islamist political organization, [[Hamas]] published a political program in 2017 intended to ease its position on Israel.

Look, for example, how they cover with unlimited enthusiasm, every week, the left-wing demonstration. The same demonstrations whose goal is to apply improper pressure on law enforcement authorities so they will file an indictment at any price.” Observers likened his blanketed use of the term, ‘fake news’, for describing left-wing media to Donald Trump, and his similar statements during the 2016 election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/echoing-trump-a-defiant-netanyahu-attacks-fake-news-as-investigations-heat-up/2017/08/13/021f712e-7ecd-11e7-b2b1-aeba62854dfa_story.html|title=Echoing Trump, a defiant Netanyahu attacks ‘fake news’ as investigations heat up|last=Morris|first=Loveday|date=August 13, 2017|work=The Washington Post|access-date=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

False reporting related to practitioners of Islam in the country was directly correlated with increased attacks on [[Islam in Myanmar|Muslims in Myanmar]]. [[BuzzFeed]] journalist Sheera Frenkel reported fake news fictitiously stated believers in Islam acted out in violence at Buddhist locations.

=== Poland ===
Polish historian {{ill|Jerzy Targalski|pl|Jerzy Targalski (ur. 1952)}} noted fake news websites had infiltrated Poland through [[anti-establishment]] and [[right-wing]] sources that copied content from ''[[Russia Today]]''. Targalski observed there existed about 20 specific fake news websites in Poland that spread Russian disinformation in the form of fake news. One example cited was fake news that [[Ukraine]] announced the Polish city of [[Przemyśl]] as occupied Polish land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/280476,Russian-propaganda-entering-mainstream-news-disinformation-experts "Russian propaganda entering mainstream news: disinformation experts"], ''[[Radio Poland]]'', November 18, 2016, retrieved December 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 8, 2016, [[Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6) [[Alex Younger]] delivered a speech to journalists at the [[SIS Building|MI6 headquarters]] where he called fake news and propaganda damaging to democracy. Younger said the mission of MI6 was to combat propaganda and fake news in order to deliver to his government a strategic advantage in the [[information warfare]] arena, and assist other nations including Europe. He called such methods of fake news propaganda online a "fundamental threat to our sovereignty". Younger said all nations that hold democratic values should feel the same worry over fake news.&lt;ref&gt;Waterson, Jim (December 8, 2016), [https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimwaterson/mi6-chief-says-fake-news-and-online-propaganda-is-a-threat-t "MI6 Chief Says Fake News And Online Propaganda Are A Threat To Democracy"], [[BuzzFeed]], retrieved December 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, definitions of "fake news" have been controversial in the UK, with [[political satire]] being seen as a key element of [[British humour]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Grady, Sean (February 9, 2017).

''[[The Independent]]''. Retrieved March 5, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of Parliament in the UK have been advised against using the term "when describing the complexity of information disorder", as the term "fake news" is "woefully inadequate":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Neither the words 'fake' nor 'news' effectively capture this polluted information ecosystem. Much of the content used as examples in debates on this topic are not fake, they are genuine but used out of context or manipulated. Similarly, to understand the entire ecosystem of polluted information, we need to consider far more than content that mimics 'news'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hern |first1=Alex |title=MPs warned against term 'fake news' for first live committee hearing outside UK |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/07/commons-committee-must-not-use-term-fake-news-in-us-hearing |accessdate=1 August 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=7 February 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Professor [[Philip N. Howard]] of the [[Oxford Internet Institute]] at the [[University of Oxford]] studied web traffic in the United States prior to the election. He found that about one half of all news on Twitter directed at [[Michigan]] was junk or fake, and the other half came from actual professional news sources.&lt;ref name=60Minutes&gt;{{cite video|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-fake-news-find-your-social-media-feeds/|title=60 Minutes: How fake news becomes a popular, trending topic|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=March 26, 2017|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[BuzzFeed]], during the last three months of the presidential campaign, of the top twenty fake election-related articles on Facebook, seventeen were anti-Clinton or pro-Trump. Facebook users interacted with them more often than with stories from genuine news outlets.&lt;ref name=CBSNews20161117 /&gt;

Debate over the impact of fake news in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|election]], and whether or not it significantly impacted the election of the [[Republican party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Donald Trump]], whom the most shared fake stories favored,&lt;ref name="Guess_Nyhan_Reifler_1/9/2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarlin_1/14/2018"/&gt; led researchers from [[Stanford]] to study the impact of fake news shared on social media, where 62% of U.S. adults get their news from. They assessed that 8% of readers of fake news recalled and believed in the content they were reading, though the same share of readers also recalled and believed in "placebos" — stories they did not actually read, but that were produced by the authors of the study. In comparison, over 50% of the participants recalled reading and believed in true news stories. The authors do not assess the final impact of these numbers on the election, but seek to "offer theoretical and empirical background" for the debate.&lt;ref name="Allcott"/&gt;

In the United States in the run-up to the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], fake news was particularly prevalent and spread rapidly over social media "bots", according to researchers at the [[Oxford Internet Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/technology/automated-pro-trump-bots-overwhelmed-pro-clinton-messages-researchers-say.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Automated Pro-Trump Bots Overwhelmed Pro-Clinton Messages, Researchers Say|author=John Markoff|date=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/11/17/how-pro-trump-twitter-bots-spread-fake-news.html|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]] |title=How Pro-Trump Twitter Bots Spread Fake News|author=Gideon Resnick|date=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech shortly after the election, former Democratic candidate [[Hillary Clinton]] warned of the "real-world consequences" of fake news.&lt;ref name="WhoPopularizedFakeNews"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borchers|first1=Callum|title=How Hillary Clinton might have inspired Trump’s ‘fake news’ attacks|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/01/03/how-hillary-clinton-might-have-inspired-trumps-fake-news-attacks/|accessdate=February 20, 2018|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=January 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, in the early weeks of his presidency, U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] frequently used the term "fake news" to refer to traditional news media, singling out [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/02/16/very-fake-news-trump-questioned-cnn-jim-acosta|title='Very Fake News': Pres.

After Republican [[Colorado Senate|Colorado State Senator]] [[Ray Scott (Colorado politician)|Ray Scott]] used the term as a reference to a column in the ''[[Grand Junction Daily Sentinel]]'', the newspaper's publisher threatened a [[defamation]] lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/15/one-newspaper-in-colorado-is-standing-up-to-charges-of-fake-news/ |title=One newspaper in Colorado is standing up to charges of 'fake news' |author=Callum Borchers |date=February 15, 2017 |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' "The Fix" blog |accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/02/17/515760101/when-a-politician-says-fake-news-and-a-newspaper-threatens-to-sue-back|title=When A Politician Says 'Fake News' And A Newspaper Threatens To Sue Back|publisher=[[NPR]] |accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, an armed [[North Carolina]] man, Edgar Maddison Welch, traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]], and opened fire at the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria, driven by a fake online news story known as the [[Pizzagate conspiracy theory]], which accused the pizzeria of hosting a pedophile ring run by Democratic Party leaders.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/04/conservative-daily-post/evidence-ridiculously-thin-sensational-claim-huge-/|title=Evidence ridiculously thin for Clinton sex network claim|publisher=[[PolitiFact.com]]|accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stories tend to go viral quickly.

These systems show users content that reflects their interests and history, leading to fake and misleading news. Following a [[plea agreement]] with prosecutors, Welch pleaded guilty to the federal charge of interstate transport of firearms and a District of Columbia charge of assault with a dangerous weapon. Welch was sentenced to four years in prison on June 22, 2017 and agreed to pay $5,744.33 for damages to the restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/22/533941689/pizzagate-gunman-sentenced-to-4-years-in-prison|title='Pizzagate' Gunman Sentenced To 4 Years in Prison|work=NPR.org|accessdate=June 28, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Twitter user then posted a photograph of two buses outside a building, claiming that those were the Anti-Trump protesters. The tweet immediately went viral on both Twitter and Facebook. Fake news can easily spread due to the speed and accessibility of modern communications technology.

A [[CNN]] investigation examined exactly how fake news can start to trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/02/16/very-fake-news-trump-questioned-cnn-jim-acosta|title='Very Fake News': Pres.

'''Holly Martin Smith''' (also known as '''Holly S. Goldman''') is Distinguished Professor of [[Philosophy]] at [[Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey]]. Her publications focus on questions in normative ethics, moral responsibility and structural questions common to normative theories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=60&amp;q=%22Holly+Smith%22+%22Holly+M.+Smith%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,34 See Google Scholar.]&lt;!--; [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Holly+Smith%2C+philosophy&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C34]; [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Holly+Smith+Goldman%2C+philosophy&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C34];

A recipient of the Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation Fellowship at the National Humanities Center (2013–14),&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/fellowships/1314fell.htm Fellows and Their Projects, 2013-2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630070133/http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/fellowships/1314fell.htm |date=2014-06-30 }}, National Humanities Center.&lt;/ref&gt; she held an American Association of University Women Postgraduate Fellowship (1975–76) and a [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] Fellowship for Independent Study (1982-83.)&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?q=1&amp;a=0&amp;n=1&amp;ln=Goldman&amp;fn=Holly&amp;o=0&amp;k=0&amp;f=0&amp;s=0&amp;p=0&amp;d=0&amp;y=1&amp;yf=1982&amp;yt=1983&amp;prd=0&amp;cov=0&amp;prz=0&amp;wp=0&amp;pg=0&amp;ob=year&amp;or=DESC NEH Grants.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1985 and 2006 she held a series of increasingly responsible academic administrative positions, first at the [[University of Arizona]], including Head, Department of Philosophy (1985–90), Vice Provost for Academic Affairs (1991-June 1993), and Dean of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences (1993-July 2001); and then at [[Rutgers University-New Brunswick]] from 2001 to 2006: Executive Dean Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Dean of the Graduate School-New Brunswick.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;[http://fas-philosophy.rutgers.edu/hsmith/index.html Holly Martin Smith page at Rutgers]&lt;/ref&gt; Active in national academic administrative organizations, she served as President of the [[Council of Colleges of Arts and Sciences]], a national organization of arts and sciences deans, during 2000-01.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;[http://www.ccas.net/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3710 Past CCAS Presidents - Council of Colleges of Arts and Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
Smith received her early education in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. Attending [[Wellesley College]] on a [[National Merit Scholarship]], she received her B.A. as First Trustee Fellow in 1966, followed by an M.A. (1970) and a Ph.D. (1972) in Philosophy from the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; Smith taught at [[Tufts University]] (1970–71), The [[University of Michigan at Flint]] (1971–72), [[The University of Pittsburgh]] (1972–73), The [[University of Michigan at Ann Arbor]] (1973-80), The [[University of Illinois at Chicago Circle]] (1980–83), The [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (Visiting Associate Professor, 1981–82), and The [[University of Arizona]] (1983-2001). From 2001 she has served as Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at [[Rutgers University-New Brunswick]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;

Her husband [[Alvin I. Goldman]] is Board of Governors Professor of Philosophy and Cognitive Science at Rutgers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.rutgers.edu/people/faculty/602-agoldman "Goldman, Alvin"], biography at Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences; [http://fas-philosophy.rutgers.edu/goldman/ Alvin I. Goldman page] at Rutgers.&lt;/ref&gt; Her sister Sherri Smith, a prominent fiber artist, is Catherine B. Heller Collegiate Professor at the University of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stamps.umich.edu/people/detail/sherri_smith "Sherri Smith, Catherine B. Heller Collegiate Professor, School of Art &amp; Design"], Stamps School of Art and Design, University of Michigan; [http://www.sherrismithfiber.net/ Sherri smith webpage.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Smith’s philosophical work falls into four main areas: [[biomedical ethics]] (with an emphasis on reproductive ethics); [[consequentialism]] (the theory that the moral status of our acts depends on their consequences alone); [[moral responsibility]]; and [[normative ethics]] concerns that transcend particular normative theories.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;

=== Reproductive ethics ===
Smith defended a liberal perspective, arguing that the [[Foetus (band)|fetus]] has no [[Natural and legal rights|natural right]] to the use of its mother’s body during [[pregnancy]],&lt;ref&gt;"Whose Body Is It, Anyway?" in James Thomberlin, ed., ''Philosophical Perspectives'', Vol. 6 (Atascadero, California: Ridgeview Publishing Company, 1992), 73-96.&lt;/ref&gt; and that it has no right to “rescue” by the mother.&lt;ref&gt;"Fetal-Maternal Conflicts," in In Harm's Way: Essays in Honor of Joel Feinberg, edited by Allen Buchanan and Jules Coleman (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 324-343; and "Intercourse and Moral Responsibility for the Fetus," in ''Abortion and the Status of the Fetus'', Vol. XIII of the series, "Philosophy of Medicine," eds William B. Bondeson, H. Tristram Englehardt, Stuart Spicker, and Daniel H. Winship (Dordrecht, Holland/Boston, Massachusetts:  D. Reidel, 1983), 229-245.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consequentialism ===
Smith focused on forms of [[rule utilitarianism]], arguing, contra [[David Lyons (philosopher)|David Lyons]],&lt;ref&gt;David Lyons, ''Forms and Limits of Utilitarianism'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1965).&lt;/ref&gt; that [[act utilitarianism]] and full compliance forms of rule utilitarianism do not always prescribe the same actions, and maintaining that the project of finding an appropriate definition for “consequences” within rule utilitarianism had been misconceived and was doomed to failure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4318876 "David Lyons on Utilitarian Generalization"], ''Philosophical Studies'', Vol. 26 (October 1974), 77-94 (as Holly S. Goldman); and [https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0953820810000324 “Measuring the Consequences of Rules”], ''Utilitas'', Vol. 22, No. 4, December 2010, 413–433.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral responsibility ===
Smith explored how to assess an agent’s degree of credit or blameworthiness for an action when the agent acts from a mixture of good and bad motives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2381864 "Varieties of Moral Worth and Moral Credit"], in ''Ethics'', Vol. 101 (January 1991), 279-303.&lt;/ref&gt; She worked on the question of whether an agent is blameworthy for a wrongful act done in culpable ignorance.&lt;ref name="Culpable Ignorance 543-571"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2184880 "Culpable Ignorance"], ''The Philosophical Review'', Vol. XCII (October 1983), pp. 543-571; [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11572-011-9113-1 “Non-Tracing Cases of Culpable Ignorance”], ''Criminal Law and Philosophy'', Vol. 5, Issue 2 (2011), 115-146; and “The Subjective Moral Duty to Inform Oneself before Acting,” forthcoming in ''Ethics''.&lt;/ref&gt; Her most noted paper is “Culpable Ignorance,” which was named by ''The Philosopher’s Annual'' as one of the ten best articles in 1983.&lt;ref name="Culpable Ignorance 543-571" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Philosopher's Annual"&gt;[http://www.philosophersannual.org/ ''The Philosopher's Annual''], Vol. VI, from the literature of 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; It analysed in detail the terms of the debate between those who argue that a person is blameworthy for an action performed in culpable ignorance, versus those who hold that while a person is blameworthy for the initial dereliction of failing to acquire information, that does not taint a subsequent action, done in culpable ignorance, that is itself done from acceptable motives.

Smith concluded that the only defense for the  position—a controversial one in law and philosophy&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Statman, Moral Luck (Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;—is one that holds people blameworthy for the unlucky consequences of their actions.

Later she explored the implications of [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]] and [[social psychology]] for questions about moral responsibility, arguing that agents should not be held responsible for emotional reactions and behavior that issue from [[Cognition|cognitive processes]] involving automatic ([[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]]/[[Aaron Twerski|Tversky]]'s [[Thinking, Fast and Slow|System 1]]) responses to environmental stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11572-011-9113-1 “Non-Tracing Cases of Culpable Ignorance”], Criminal Law and Philosophy, Vol. 5, Issue 2 (2011), 115-146; “Dual-Process Theory and Moral Responsibility,” forthcoming in Michael McKenna, Angela Smith, and Randolph Clarke (eds), ''The Nature of Moral Responsibility'' (Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Actualism ====
Much of Smith’s work focused on questions about right and wrong that are common to many distinct ethical theories, including both consequentialist theories and [[deontological]] ones (the moral status of an act depends on features of an act other than its consequences, such as whether or not it involves telling a lie or breaking a promise). Her paper “Dated Rightness and Moral Imperfection”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/218427 "Dated Rightness and Moral Imperfection"], ''The Philosophical Review'', Vol. LXXXV (October, 1976), 449-487 (as Holly S. Goldman).&lt;/ref&gt; helped launch a debate now known as the debate between [[Actualism]] and [[Possibilism (philosophy)|Possibilism]] by arguing for the first time in favor of Actualism.&lt;ref&gt;Holly S. Goldman, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/218427 "Dated Rightness and Moral Imperfection"], ''The Philosophical Review'', Vol. LXXXV (October 1976), n. 16, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Possibilists believe that whether or not the agent ought to perform an immediate action depends on whether performing it would enable the ideal course of action in the future. Actualists believe that whether or not an agent ought to perform the action depends on what performing that action would actually lead her to do in the future.

The issue is illustrated by an example from Smith/Goldman’s later paper “Doing the Best One Can”.&lt;ref&gt;"Doing the Best One Can," in ''Values and Morals'', eds Alvin Goldman and Jaegwon Kim (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1978), 186-214. Published under the name Holly S. Goldman.&lt;/ref&gt; A graduate student asks faculty member S for comments on a paper he plans to present at a job interview. If S agrees and comments on the paper, the student will improve the paper substantially, have a highly successful interview, and receive an offer for a three-year job. If S accepts the task but fails to comment on the paper in time, the student will make no revisions, have a dismal interview, and receive no job offer. If S declines to provide comments, the student will elicit comments from a less expert faculty member, make less helpful revisions on the paper, have a moderately successful interview, and receive a one-year job offer. Clearly S’s accepting the task would enable her to follow the ideal course of action, namely reading and commenting on the paper in a timely way, resulting in the student’s receiving a three-year job. However, in reality if S accepted the task, she would actually fail to comment on the paper in time, either because she would misunderstand the deadline, or because she of her time-consuming administrative chores. In this case the student would receive no job offer. Possibilism recommends that S agree to comment, that would support her intent to follow the best course of action. Actualism takes a more realistic stance: it recommends that S decline since that would lead to a better outcome. Smith argues this case requires the same reasoning as a prudential decision, such as deciding to drive carefully to avoid a crash.

=== Information ===
Smith also considered the question of how to use moral theories in actual decision-making, especially given agent's lack of enough information about the world to ascertain accurately which action their favored moral theory implies. Thus the intent to avoid [[adultery]] may be thwarted by not knowing that a partner is actually married. And someone trying to follow [[W. D. Ross]]’s [[prima facie]] duty to keep promises may fail should she forget the promise. Smith repeatedly explored these “epistemic” problems&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2215557 "Making Moral Decisions"], ''Nous'', Vol. XXII, No.1 (March 1988), 89-108; [https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0265052500001047 "Two-Tier Moral Codes"], ''Social Philosophy &amp; Policy'', Vol. 7 (Autumn 1989), 112-132; "Deciding How To Decide: Is There a Regress Problem?" in Michael Bacharach and Susan Hurley (eds), ''Essays in the Foundations of Decision Theory'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1991, 194-219; [https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0265052509990161 “Subjective Rightness”], in ''Social Philosophy and Policy'' 27 (Summer 2010), 64-110; [http://www.jesp.org/ “The Prospective View of Obligation”], ''Journal of Ethics and Social Philosophy'', February 2011; [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11572-011-9113-1 “Non-Tracing Cases of Culpable Ignorance”], ''Criminal Law and Philosophy'', Vol. 5, Issue 2 (2011), 115-146; [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1533-6077.2012.00235.x/abstract “Using Moral Principles to Guide Decisions”], ''Philosophical Issues'', Vol. 22, ''Action Theory'' (2012), 369-86; “The Moral Clout of Reasonable Beliefs,” in Mark Timmons (ed.), ''Oxford Studies in Normative Ethics'', Vol. I (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1–25; [https://www.jstor.org/action/showPublication?journalCode=ethics “The Subjective Moral Duty to Inform Oneself before Acting”], forthcoming in ''Ethics''.&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that the solution depends on recognizing that moral theories must be supplemented by a hierarchy of decision rules that prescribe acts as “subjectively right” to agents who are uncertain what the moral theory itself recommends. Smith was awarded a National Humanities Center Fellowship during 2013-14 to complete a book manuscript on this cluster of epistemic challenges to using morality to make decisions.

== Types ==
There are several subsets of homeotic genes. They include many of the [[Hox genes|Hox]] and [[ParaHox]] genes that are important for [[segmentation (biology)|segmentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Young T, Rowland JE, van de Ven C, etal |title=Cdx and Hox genes differentially regulate posterior axial growth in mammalian embryos |journal=Dev. Cell |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=516–26 |date=October 2009 |pmid=19853565 |doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2009.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hox genes are found in bilateral animals, including ''Drosophila'' (in which they were first discovered) and humans. Hox genes are a subset of the [[homeobox]] genes. The Hox genes are often [[conserved sequence|conserved]] across species, so some of the Hox genes of ''Drosophila'' are homologous to those in humans. In general, Hox genes play a role of regulating expression of genes as well as aiding in development and assignment of specific structures during embryonic growth. This can range from segmentation in ''Drosophila'' to [[central nervous system]] (CNS) development in vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Akin ZN, Nazarali AJ |title=Hox Genes and Their Candidate Downstream Targets in the Developing Central Nervous System|journal=Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology |volume=25 |issue=3–4 |pages=697–741 |year=2005|pmid=16075387
|doi=10.1007/s10571-005-3971-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Hox and ParaHox are grouped as HOX-Like (HOXL) genes, a subset of the ANTP class (named after the ''Drosophila'' gene, [[Antennapedia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holland |first1=Peter WH |last2=Booth |first2=H Anne F |last3=Bruford |first3=Elspeth A |title=Classification and nomenclature of all human homeobox genes |journal=BMC Biology |date=2007 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=47 |doi=10.1186/1741-7007-5-47 |pmc=2211742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also include the [[MADS-box]]-containing genes involved in the [[ABC model of flower development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Theissen G |title=Development of floral organ identity: stories from the MADS house |journal=Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=75–85 |year=2001 |pmid=11163172 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1369-5266(00)00139-4 |doi=10.1016/S1369-5266(00)00139-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides flower-producing plants, the MADS-box motif is also present in other organisms such as insects, yeasts, and mammals. They have various functions depending on the organism including flower development, proto-oncogene transcription, and gene regulation in specific cells (such as muscle cells).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shore P, Sharrocks AD |title=The MADS-box family of transcription factors|journal=European Journal of Biochemistry |volume=229 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |year=1995|pmid=7744019 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.0001l.x/abstract |doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.0001l.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the terms being commonly interchanged, not all homeotic genes are Hox genes; the MADS-box genes are homeotic but not Hox genes. Thus, the Hox genes are a subset of homeotic genes.

== ''Drosophila melanogaster'' ==
[[File:Homeotic selector gene complexes.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Homeotic selector gene complexes in the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'']]

One of the most commonly studied [[model organism]]s in regards to homeotic genes is the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''. Its homeotic genes occur in either the Antennapedia complex (ANT-C) or the Bithorax complex (BX-C) discovered by [[Edward B. Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heuer JG, Kaufman TC |title=Homeotic genes have specific functional roles in the establishment of the ''Drosophila'' embryonic peripheral nervous system |journal=Development |volume=115 |pages=35–47 |date=May 1992|pmid=1353440 |url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/115/1/35.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the complexes focuses on a different area of development. The [[antennapedia]] complex consists of five genes, including [[Proboscipedia (pb gene)|proboscipedia]], and is involved in the development of the front of the embryo, forming the segments of the head and thorax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Randazzo FM, Cribbs DL, Kaufman TC |title=Rescue and regulation of proboscipedia: a homeotic gene of the Antennapedia Complex |journal=Development |volume=113 |issue=1 |pages=257–71|date=Sep 1991|pmid=1684932 |url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/113/1/257.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bithorax complex consists of three main genes and is involved in the development of the back of the embryo, namely the abdomen and the posterior segments of the thorax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maeda RK, Karch F |title=The ABC of the BX-C: the bithorax complex explained|journal=Development|volume=133|issue= 8|pages=1413–22|date=Apr 2006|pmid=16556913|doi=10.1242/dev.02323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During development (starting at the [[blastoderm]] stage of the embryo), these genes are constantly expressed to assign structures and roles to the different segments of the fly's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Breen TR, Harte PJ |title=''trithorax'' regulates multiple homeotic genes in the bithorax and Antennapedia complexes and exerts different tissue-specific, parasegment-specific and promoter-specific effects on each |journal=Development|volume=117|pages=119–34|date=January 1993 |pmid=7900984|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/117/1/119.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Drosophila'', these genes can be analyzed using the [http://flybase.org/ Flybase] database.

== Research ==
Much research has been done on homeotic genes in different organisms, ranging from basic understanding of how the molecules work to mutations to how homeotic genes affect the human body. Changing the expression levels of homeotic genes can negatively impact the organism. For example, in one study, a pathogenic phytoplasma caused homeotic genes in a flowering plant to either be significantly upregulated or downregulated. This led to severe phenotypic changes including dwarfing, defects in the pistils, hypopigmentation, and the development of leaf-like structures on most floral organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Himeno M, Neriya Y, et al |title=Unique morphological changes in plant pathogenic phytoplasma-infected petunia flowers are related to transcriptional regulation of floral homeotic genes in an organ-specific manner |journal=The Plant Journal |volume=67 |pages=971–79 |date=July 1, 2011 |pmid=21605209 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04650.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, it was found that the homeotic gene ''[[Cdx2]]'' acts as a [[tumor suppressor]]. In normal expression levels, the gene prevents tumorgenesis and colorectal cancer when exposed to [[carcinogen]]s; however, when ''Cdx2'' was not well expressed, carcinogens caused tumor development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bonhomme C, Duluc I, etal |title=The ''Cdx2'' homeobox gene has a tumour suppressor function in the distal colon in addition to a homeotic role during gut development |journal=Gut|volume=52|pages=1465–71|date=October 2003|pmid=12970140|url=http://gut.bmj.com/content/52/10/1465.long|doi=10.1136/gut.52.10.1465 |pmc=1773830}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies, along with many others, show the importance of homeotic genes even after development.

'''Jan Hendrik van den Berg''' (June 11, 1914 &amp;ndash; September 22, 2012) was a Dutch psychiatrist notable for his work in phenomenological psychotherapy (cf. [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]]) and metabletics, or "psychology of historical change." He is the author of numerous articles and books, including ''A different existence'' and ''The changing nature of man''.

==Biography==
Jan Hendrik (J.H.) van den Berg was born June 11, 1914 in [[Deventer]], the [[Netherlands]]. Between 1933 and 1936, he earned diplomas in primary school and high school education, the latter with a focus on mathematics. He also published papers on [[entomology]]. He then entered medical school at [[Utrecht University]] specializing in [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]]. He completed his doctoral dissertation in 1946. One year later, after studying in both France and Switzerland, Dr. Van den Berg was appointed to Head of Department at the psychiatry clinic at Utrecht. At Utrecht, he lectured in psychopathology in the medical school and was also appointed to Professor of Pastoral Psychology in the [[theology]] department. In 1954, Dr. van den Berg took a position of Professor of Psychology at [[Leiden University]]. Since 1967, he has been a visiting professor at many universities and conducted lecture tours internationally.&lt;ref&gt;. Kruger, D. (Ed.). (1985).

'''Jesse Glenn Gray''' (known as ''J. Glenn Gray''; 1913–1977) was an American philosopher, writer, and professor of philosophy at Colorado College. Gray published numerous books and essays. His first major publication, ''[[The Warriors: Reflections on Men in Battle]]'', is a  philosophical memoir of his years as an counter-intelligence officer near the battle lines in Italy during World War II inspired by Gray’s opposition to war. Its reprint in 1967 and subsequent editions included an introduction by [[Hannah Arendt]].

Gray was born May 27, 1913, near [[Mifflintown, Pennsylvania]]. He graduated from [[Juniata College]] and obtained an M.A. from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1938 and a Ph.D. from [[Columbia University]] in 1941. Immediately after this, Gray spent four years in the United States Army, becoming a second lieutenant. When Gray returned to the United States he began his career as a professor. In 1947 Gray married Ursula Werner, with whom he had two daughters.

As a long-time professor at [[Colorado College]], Gray obtained fellowships from the [[Ford Foundation]], [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]], and the [[National Council on the Arts and Humanities]]. He also was a scholar-in-residence for the [[Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies]] from 1967 to 1968. As a general editor for [[Harper &amp; Row]], Gray supervised work for the publisher on translations of the German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], with whom he formed a personal association, and was among his earliest champions in the United States. Colleagues at Colorado College and elsewhere compiled a collection of essays, entitled ''Something of Great Constancy,'' in honor of Gray. Prior to its publication, Gray died October 30, 1977, in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]].

{{nihongo|'''Kamo no Mabuchi'''|賀茂 真淵||24 April 1697 &amp;ndash; 27 November 1769}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[poet]] and [[philologist]] of the [[Edo period]].

Mabuchi conducted research into the spirit of ancient Japan through his studies of the [[Man'yōshū]] and other works of ancient literature. A disciple of [[Kada no Azumamaro]], Mabuchi is regarded as one of the four greats of [[Kokugaku]].

Mabuchi’s works include commentaries on the [[Man'yōshū]], ''[[norito]]'' (Shinto prayers), ''[[kagura]]'' (Shinto dances), the [[Tale of Genji]], the meaning of poems, and other ancient works and their themes.

His disciples included [[Motoori Norinaga]], Arakida Hisaoyu, Kato Chikage, Murata Harumi, [[Katori Nahiko]], Hanawa Hokiichi, Uchiyama Matatsu, and Kurita Hijimaro.

==Life==
Mabuchi was born in 1697 as the third son of the [[Hamamatsu]] Shinto priest Okabe Masanobu. The Okabe were a lower branch of [[Kamo Shrine]] in Kyoto.

At the age of 37, Mabuchi moved to [[Kyoto]] and became a disciple of Kada no Azumamaro. Following the master’s death in 1736, Mabuchi moved to [[Edo]] in 1738 where he taught Kokugaku.

In 1763, while Mabuchi was on his way to [[Grand Shrine of Ise|Ise Shrine]], Motoori Norinaga sought him out and became a disciple. This single night of discussions, later known as "the night in Matsuzaka", was the only occasion on which Norinaga directly received teaching from Mabuchi, although the two men later corresponded.

An explanatory marker stands at the site of Mabuchi’s residence in Edo ([[Hisamatsu-cho]], [[Nihonbashi]], [[Chūō, Tokyo]]). His grave can be found in the [[Tokaiji]] cemetery in [[Shinagawa, Tokyo|Shinagawa]]. A museum stands beside the house where he was born in Hamamatsu ([[Higashi-Iba]], Hamamatsu, [[Shizuoka Prefecture|Shizuoka]]).

[[File:Assistants and George Frederic Watts - Hope - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Hope (painting)|Hope]]'', [[George Frederic Watts]], 1886. Cover of ''On Kitsch'' by Odd Nerdrum and others.&lt;ref group=note name="on kitsch" /&gt;|alt=Image shows man on a spherical object hunched over.]]
'''Kitsch painting''' is an international movement of [[Classical tradition|classical painters]] founded upon a 24 September 1998 speech and philosophy by the Norwegian artist, [[Odd Nerdrum]],&lt;ref&gt;E.J. Pettinger [http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/the-kitsch-campaign/Content?oid=926148] "The Kitsch Campaign" [Boise Weekly], December 29, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; later clarified in his book ''[[On Kitsch]]''&lt;ref&gt;Dag Solhjell and Odd Nerdrum [https://www.amazon.com/Kitsch-Jan-Erik-Ebbestad-Hansen/dp/8248901238] "On Kitsch" Kagge Publishing, August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; with Jan-Ove Tuv and others.&lt;ref group=note name="on kitsch"&gt;Odd Nerdrum, Sindre Mekjan, Jan-Erik Ebbestad Hansen, Jan-Ove Tuv, and Dag Solhjell&lt;/ref&gt; The movement incorporates the techniques of the [[Old Masters]] with narrative, [[romanticism]], and emotionally charged imagery. The movement defines [[Kitsch]] as synonymous with the [[art]]s of ancient Rome or the [[techne]] of ancient Greece. Kitsch painters embrace kitsch as a positive term not in opposition to "[[art]]", but as its own independent superstructure. Kitsch painters assert that Kitsch is not an art movement, but a philosophical movement separate from [[art]]. The Kitsch movement has been considered an indirect criticism of the contemporary art world, but according to Nerdrum and many Kitsch painters, this is not their expressed intention.&lt;ref&gt;Signy Norendal, "Interview with Robert Dale Williams" [Aktuell Kunst] September 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Scott [http://artbabel.blogspot.com/2010/04/philosophy-of-kitsch-kant-kunst-and.html] The Philosophy of Kitsch.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://janovetuv.com/bruker/articles/Defence%20of%20kich_E%2038-39.pdf Jan-Ove Tuv]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of kitsch painting philosophy==
The philosophy originated by Nerdrum first manifested into a group among Nerdrum's circle of students&lt;ref&gt;Kristiane Larssen "Skolemesteren" [D2/DagensNaeringsliv] November 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Jan-Ove Tuv, Helene Knoop, Hege Elizabeth Haugen, Monika Helgesen, [[Jeremy Caniglia]], Kjetil Jul, Brad Silverstein, Carlos Madrid, Stefan Boulter, Brandon Kralik, Nanne Nyander, and soon expanded. Many kitsch painters were featured in and contributed essays to Nerdrum's book ''Kitsch: More than Art''&lt;ref&gt;Odd Nerdrum [https://www.amazon.com/Odd-Nerdrum-Kitsch-More-than/dp/8251636388] Schibsted Forlag, September 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Maxim Antonovich was born in [[Bilopillia|Belopolye]], [[Kharkov Governorate]], to the family of a clergyman. After studying at the Kharkiv seminary he enrolled in the [[Saint Petersburg Theological Academy]] which he graduated in 1859.

Antonovich's literary career started in ''[[Sovremennik]]'' where several articles promoting the philosophy of [[materialism]] brought him the reputation of an "ideological heir to [[Chernyshevsky]]." As a head of the magazine's literary criticism department (a position he took after [[Nikolai Dobrolyubov]]'s death) Antonovich waged bitter feuds against ''[[Vremya (magazine)|Vremya]]'', ''[[Epoch (Russian magazine)|Epokha]]'', and later ''[[Russkoye Slovo]]'', after his slagging of [[Ivan Turgenev]]'s ''[[Fathers and Sons (novel)|Fathers and Sons]]'' in 1862 outraged [[Dmitry Pisarev]] and a violent confrontation ensued which [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] called "the break-up of the Russian nihilism."&lt;ref name="az"/&gt;

As Nekrasov refused Antonovich an invitation to the renewed ''[[Otechestvennye Zapiski]]'' in 1869, he accused the former in "betrayal of the old friends" and turned to translation work (''Histoire de la Revolution Française'' by [[Louis Blanc]], ''Physics'' by [[Balfour Stewart]], ''The Teaching of Geography'' by [[Archibald Geikie]], ''Textbook of Physiology'' by [[Michael Foster (physiologist)|Michael Foster]], among others). In 1898—1916 he published memoirs on [[Nikolai Dobrolyubov]], [[Nikolai Chernyshevsky]], [[Nikolai Nekrasov]] and [[Pyotr Lavrov]]. Antonovich died on 14 November 1918 in [[Petrograd]], [[Soviet Russia]].&lt;ref name="az"/&gt;

'''Men's romantic fiction''' refers to any fictional portrayal of [[romantic love]] either in film, text, or other media and is usually either told from the male protagonist's [[point of view (literature)|point of view]] or taking particular interest in the romance as viewed from a male perspective.

Although generally concerning heterosexual relationships, men's romantic fiction also includes [[gay pulp fiction|gay romantic fiction]], romance dealing with love between men.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The genre of 'lad lit' also has somewhat similar connotations.

==Examples==
For example, the novels ''[[Belinda (Anne Rice novel)|Belinda]]'' by [[Anne Rice]] and ''Northern Lights'' by [[Nora Roberts]] are both told from the male protagonist's point of view. The novel ''[[Bid Time Return|Somewhere In Time]]'' (Former title: ''Bid Time Return'') by Richard Matheson is a romance told from the male protagonist point of view. It is sometimes classified as science fiction as well as romance. Other novelists such as [[Nicholas Sparks (author)|Nicholas Sparks]] who wrote ''[[A Walk to Remember]]'' and  ''[[The Notebook (novel)|The Notebook]]'' usually write from the male perspective, foregrounded by typical prefaces and diary entries at the beginning of the story.

Romantic stories told from the point of view of a male protagonist are very common among Japanese [[shounen]] and [[seinen]] [[manga]] and [[bishoujo games]]. Many of the latter contain erotic aspects in addition to the portrayal of romantic love.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erogereview.com/ Eroge Review (Not safe for work)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225080147/http://www.erogereview.com/ |date=2009-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mimesis criticism''' is a method of interpreting texts in relation to their literary or cultural models. Mimesis, or '''imitation''' (''imitatio''), was a widely used rhetorical tool in antiquity up until the 18th century's [[Romanticism|romantic]] emphasis on originality. Mimesis criticism looks to identify [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] relationships between two texts that go beyond simple echoes, [[allusion]]s, [[citation]]s, or [[redaction]]s. The effects of imitation are usually manifested in the later text by means of distinct [[characterization]], [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]], and/or [[plot (narrative)|plot]] structure.

As a critical method, '''mimesis criticism''' has been pioneered by [[Dennis MacDonald]], especially in relation to [[New Testament]] and other early Christian narratives imitating the "canonical" works of [[Classics|Classical]] Greek literature.

==History==

===Aristotle===
Greek rhetorician [[Aristotle]] (4th century {{smallcaps|b.c.e.}}) discusses the rhetorical technique of mimesis or imitation; what Aristotle describes, however, is the author's imitation of nature, not earlier literary or cultural models.

===Philodemus===
[[Philodemus|Philodemus of Gadara]] (1st century {{smallcaps|b.c.e.}}), an [[Epicurean]] philosopher and poet and one of [[Virgil]]'s teachers, affirms that writers of prose histories and fictions used literary models. He writes (rhetorically) in book five of ''On Poetry'', "Who would claim that the writing of prose is not reliant on the Homeric poems?" (5.30.36-31.)

===Dionysius of Halicarnassus===
A Greek historian and rhetorician from the late first century {{smallcaps|b.c.e.}}/early first century {{smallcaps|c.e.}}, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] represents a change from the Aristotelian rhetorical notion of [[mimesis]], from imitation of nature to imitation of literature. His most important work in this respect, ''[[Dionysian imitatio|On Mimesis]]'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ μιμήσεως}}, ''Perì mimēseōs''), survives only in fragments. Apparently, most of this work concerned the proper selection of literary models.

===Quintilian===
Roman rhetorician [[Quintilian|M. Fabius Quintilianus]] published his twelve-volume [[Institutio Oratoria|''Institutio oratoria'']] around 95 {{smallcaps|c.e}}. In book 10, Quintilian - who was well-read with respect to both Greek and Latin rhetoricians, including [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] - gives advice to teachers who are instructing students in oration. He tells them that, by the time students begin composition, they should be so well-versed in exemplary models that are able to imitate them without physically consulting them (10.1.5). Quintilian writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;For in everything which we teach examples are more effective even than the rules which are taught in the schools, so long as the student has reached a stage when he can appreciate such examples without the assistance of a teacher, and can rely on his own powers to imitate them. (10.1.15; Butler, LCL)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He also advises that students constantly reread the exemplary models (10.1.19), not only in sections but all the way through (10.1.20), so that they might be empowered to imitate these models with more craft and subtlety.

Of course, the selection of one's literary model is of the utmost importance. In Quintilian's opinion, one could find no better model than Homer, "for he has given us a model and an inspiration for very department of eloquence" (10.1.46; Butler, LCL). When it comes to the act of imitation itself, he writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;There can be no doubt that in art no small portion of our task lies in imitation, since, although invention came first and is all-important, it is expedient to imitate whatever has been invented with success. And it is a universal rule of life that we should wish to copy what we approve in others. It is for this reason that boys copy the shapes of letters that they may learn to write, and that musicians take the voices of their teachers, painters the works of their predecessors, and peasants the principles of agriculture which have been proved in practice, as models for their imitation. In fact, we may note that the elementary study of every branch of learning is directed by reference to some definite standard that is placed before the learner. (10.2.1-2; Butler, LCL)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Furthermore, students are encouraged to ''improve'' upon their chosen models (10.2.12). One way for students to accomplish this task, Quintilian says, is to imitate several models in eclectic fashion: "We shall do well to keep a number of different excellences before our eyes, so that different qualities from different authors may impose themselves on our minds, to be adopted for use in the place that becomes them best" (10.2.26; Butler, LCL). On this point, Quintilian was at odds with Cicero, who felt it best for authors to imitate a single author.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Knowles Ruthven, ''Critical Assumptions'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1979), 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to circumvent the capriciousness of subjectivity, [[Dennis MacDonald|MacDonald]] suggests six criteria for determining whether a claim for a mimetic connection between texts is reasonable: accessibility, analogy, density, order, distinctive traits, and interpretability. The first two criteria concern the status of the text used as a model ("ante-text"); the final four concern the later text that may have used the antetext.

*'''Accessibility''': One must demonstrate that the author of the later text would have been reasonably able to access a copy of the text being imitated. Was the antetext well known or obscure at the time of the later text's composition?
*'''Analogy''': If one text is discovered to imitate a certain antetext, it is probable that other texts have also done so. Are there examples of other authors using this antetext as a literary model?
*'''Density''': The greater number of parallels one can induce between the two texts, the stronger one's case will be for a mimetic relationship between them.
*'''Order''': The more frequently the parallels between the two texts follow the same order, the less likely it becomes that the parallels are just coincidental.
*'''Distinctive Traits''': If there are parallels between two texts, but none of the parallels are anything but one would expect in their respective contexts, then it becomes difficult to argue for a mimetic connection. Especially helpful are [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequiturs]] or other unusual elements present in the later text which parallel the proposed model. It is also typical for authors to use significant names to alert the reader to the textual interplay.
*'''Interpretability''': A common motivation for imitating an earlier text is to rival that text, whether philosophically, theologically, politically, or otherwise. If one can determine such a motivation in a compelling fashion, then there is a stronger case for imitation.

==Mimesis in Early Christianity==

===New Testament===
Two examples of imitation within the New Testament will be outlined. The first pertains to Luke's use of 1 Kings 17 as a literary model. The second outlines Luke's imitation of Homer's ''Odyssey'' 10-12 in Acts 20.&lt;ref&gt;These examples come from MacDonald and can be found in his various publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

! 1 Kings 17:9-24
! Luke 7:11-16
|-
| Elijah went to Sarepta.
| Jesus went to Nain.
|-
| Elijah saw a widow after approaching the city gate. Her son later becomes sick and dies.
| Jesus saw a widow's dead son after approaching the city gate being carried out on a bier.
|-
| Elijah told the widow, "Give me your son."
| Jesus told the widow, "Do not weep."
|-

One can justifiably argue that Luke used 1 Kings 17:9-24 as a model for Luke 7:11-16 because it meets the criteria of '''mimesis criticism'''. '''Criterion 1''' ('''Accessibility'''): Luke cites this very story in Luke 4:25-26. '''Criterion 2''' ('''Analogy'''): Mark provides an analogous imitation of 1 Kings 17 with his story about the raising of Jairus' daughter (Mark 5:35-43). '''Criteria 3''' ('''Density'''), '''4''' ('''Order'''), and '''5''' ('''Distinctive Traits''') can be identified in the above table. The most important aspect for '''criterion 5''' is the identical Greek wording for "And he gave him to his mother." '''Criterion 6''' ('''Interpretability'''): Luke improves upon his model in the following ways. In 1 Kings, the widow initiates the miracle by castigating Elijah for causing her son's death; in Luke, Jesus is the one to initiate the miracle. In 1 Kings, Elijah then reproaches God, asking if God has "brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I am staying, by killing her son" (17:20); in Luke, Jesus does not blame God for the boy's death but instead has compassion for her. In 1 Kings, it is the {{smallcaps|Lord}} who raises the boy, not Elijah; in Luke, it is Jesus himself. In 1 Kings, only the widow responds to the miracle; in Luke, a "large crowd" responds positively.

|}

In the same way, one can justifiably argue that Luke has used the story of Elpenor from ''Odyssey'' 10-12 as a model for his account of Eutychus in Acts 20:5-12 using the criteria. '''Criterion 1''' ('''Accessibility'''): Books 10-12 of ''Odyssey'' were among the most popular in antiquity. '''Criterion 2''' ('''Analogy'''): Among the many imitations of these books in antiquity, Virgil's ''Aeneid'' contains two, the stories about Palinurus and Misenus. '''Criteria 3''' ('''Density'''), '''4''' ('''Order'''), and '''5''' ('''Distinctive Traits''') can be seen to be met by referring to the above table. Of particular significance is Luke's name choice: Homer often called Elpenor "unlucky" (''Odyssey'' 11.61, 76, 80); Luke's Eutychus literally means "good fortune." Furthermore, the raising of Luke's Eutychus occurs in the Troad, the cite of the Trojan War. '''Criterion 6''' ('''Interpretability'''): Luke emulates Homer in the following ways. Elpenor fell to his death because he was in a drunken stupor; Eutychus appeared to die after falling asleep (out a window) while listening to Paul preach deep into the night. Odysseus was unaware of Elpenor's misfortune; Paul knew immediately about Eutychus' fall and also that "his soul [was] still in him." Later in Homer's story, Elpenor's body was buried at dawn; at dawn, the other believers lifted up Eutychus alive.

In addition to imitating the [[Septuagint]] and Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', MacDonald proposes that Mark's Gospel and Luke-Acts used the following literary models: Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', several [[Homeric hymns|''Homeric Hymns'']], [[Euripides]]' [[The Bacchae|''Bacchae'']] and [[Herakles (Euripides)|''Madness of Heracles'']], and dialogues by [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]] about [[Socrates]].

===Christian Apocrypha===
In his seminal work ''Christianizing Homer:'' The Odyssey'', Plato, and'' The Acts of Andrew, MacDonald argues that the second-century {{smallcaps|c.e.}} apocryphal work, the [[Acts of Andrew]], was a Christian version of Homer's [[Iliad]]. Elsewhere, MacDonald has also argued for the presence of Homeric imitations in the [[Acts of Peter]], another second-century {{smallcaps|c.e.}} apocryphal work.

==Controversy==

===Scholarly Opposition===
Karl Olav Sandnes, the most vocal of MacDonald's critics, objects that MacDonald's "reading of both Mark's Gospel and Acts assumes a readership with an in-depth as well as extensive familiarity with the Homeric epics. This implies that the curriculum of encyclical studies had penetrated into the Christian movement to an extent which the present study has not confirmed. Ancient education was designed for the upper strata of the population."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Olav Sandnes, ''The Challenge of Homer: School, Pagan Poets, and Early Christianity'' (Library of New Testament Studies; T&amp;T Clark Int'l, 2009), 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Sandnes argues deductively: Since such familiarity with Homer was limited to the upper stratum of society, and since the authors of Mark and Luke-Acts (nor their audiences) are not believed to belong to this stratum, then the authors of Mark and Luke-Acts simply ''could not'' have imitated Homer in the way MacDonald suggests.

MacDonald's response has been threefold. First, a more sure decision about the education of the authors of Mark and Luke-Acts would result from an [[Inductive reasoning|''inductive'']] approach to the question, rather than Sandnes' [[Deductive reasoning|''deductive'']] approach. Second, access to Homer was ''not'' restricted to the cultural elite. According to a first-century {{smallcaps|ce}} writer, "From the earliest age, children beginning their studies are nursed on Homer's teaching. One might say that while we were still in swathing bands we sucked from his epics as from fresh milk. He assists the beginner and later the adult in his prime. In no stage of life, from boyhood to old age, do we ever cease to drink from him."&lt;ref&gt;Ps.-Heraclitus, ''Quaest. Hom.'' 1.5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, MacDonald notes that Sandnes does not offer any other explanation for the parallels between the New Testament writings and Homer.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis R. MacDonald, ''Homer, Vergil, and the New Testament'' (forthcoming).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret M. Mitchell]] has also published a critical response to MacDonald's work on Homeric imitation within the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret M. Mitchell, "Homer in the New Testament?" ''The Journal of Religion'' 83 (2003): 244-60.&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald addresses Mitchell's critiques, as well as earlier criticism from Sandnes,&lt;ref&gt;Karl Olav Sandnes, "''Imitatio Homeri''? An Appraisal of Dennis R. MacDonald's 'Mimesis Criticism,'" ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' 124 (2005): 715-32.&lt;/ref&gt; in an article titled, "My Turn: A Critique of Critics of 'Mimesis Criticism.'"&lt;ref&gt;Dennis R. MacDonald, "My Turn: A Critique of Critics of 'Mimesis Criticism,'" (Occasional Papers of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity 53; The Institute for Antiquity and Christianity, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications for Historicity of Jesus===
MacDonald's arguments for the mimetic nature of the Gospel narratives have influenced how some view the question of the [[historicity of Jesus]]. Some have taken the extremist position that all of the Gospel narratives are exclusively the byproduct of the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelists']] literary imagination, influenced by [[Homer]] and the [[Septuagint|Septuagintal narratives]], and not historical memory. Perhaps this is due to a misunderstanding of MacDonald's claim that the Gospel of [[Gospel of mark|Mark]] was an "intentional fiction." MacDonald believes that such a stance is taking matters too far, although he himself holds to a minimalist view of the [[Historical Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. MacDonald, "My Turn," 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt; This debate is usually generated in non-academic circles, such as [[YouTube]] [[Vlogs|video blogs]].&lt;ref&gt;One such prolific video blogger on YouTube, with the username [https://www.youtube.com/user/TruthSurge TruthSurge], has posted a number of vlogs on this topic. Particularly relevant are the videos titled, "Excavating the Empty Tomb (beyond a reasonable doubt)," parts 4-9b.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ZenBuddhism}}
{{WesternBuddhism}}
'''Niklaus Brantschen''' (born 25 October 1937 in [[Randa, Switzerland|Randa]], [[Valais]]) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Jesuit]], [[Zen master]] of the [[White Plum Sangha]] line and founder of the Lassalle-Institute within the Lassalle-House in Bad Schönbrunn/[[Zug]], [[Canton of Zug]]. He is co-initiator of the [[Jerusalem-Project]].

== Early life ==
Niklaus Brantschen grew up with six brothers and sisters in a traditionally Catholic family; he is a skilled mountaineer.&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;Autobiography in German of Niklaus Brantschen: ''Auf dem Weg des Zen: Als Christ Buddhist'' (''On the way of Zen: As a Christian Buddhist''), Kösel 2002, {{ISBN|3-466-36599-6}}, p. 29-30, 126-129, 14, 174, 55, 205, 206, 195, 88, 89, 205&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was 22 years old he joined the [[Society of Jesus]]. After the [[novitiate]] in [[Villars-sur-Glâne]] he received the [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] of the [[Munich University of Philosophy]] in 1964. As practical studies he worked in 1964-67 as an educator at [[Stella Matutina (Jesuit school)|Stella Matutina]] in [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]], Austria followed by three years of theology studies at the university of Fourvière, Lyon, France and a fourth year at the [[University of Tübingen]], among others from the professors [[Eberhard Jüngel]], [[Jürgen Moltmann]], [[Walter Kasper]], [[Hans Küng]]; Licentiate work about [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]]. In 1970 he celebrated his first [[Mass (liturgy)]] in Randa. From 1973 he made a [[Certificate of Advanced Study|certificate study]] in adult's education in Munich as assistant of meditation teacher Klemens Tilmann, followed by meditation courses with [[Karlfried Graf Dürckheim]].

== Zen education ==
From 1976 he made regular education stays for [[Zen]] studies in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa]]/Japan with [[Hugo Enomiya-Lassalle|Hugo Makibi Enomiya-Lassalle]] and [[Yamada Koun|Yamada Kôun Roshi]]. There, meetings with [[Heinrich Dumoulin]], [[Jerry Brown]], [[Willigis Jäger]], Johannes Kopp. In 1988 he was given the teaching competence for Zen by Yamada Roshi, in 1999 he received the confirmation of a [[Zen master]] ("inka shōmei") from [[Tetsugen Bernard Glassman]].

1986 Brantschen met [[Jerry Brown]] in Japan and held inspiring conversations, 1987 he practised Zen together also with him.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

== Other activities ==
Between 1973 and 1977, Brantschen was assistant manager of the educational institution Bad Schönbrunn near [[Menzingen]], until 1987 he was its manager. For the next five years he worked as a student minister at different colleges in [[Zürich]]. In 1993 he positioned the educational institution Bad Schönbrunn new as a centre for [[spirituality]] and [[social consciousness]] and renamed it [[:de:Lassalle-Haus|Lassalle-Haus]]. In 1995, together with [[Pia Gyger]], he founded the [[:de:Lassalle-Institut|Lassalle-Institut]], an institution in the fields of [[Zen]], [[ethics]] and [[leadership]], which they both led until 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lassalle-institut.org/en/about/leitung/brantschen/ Biography on website of Lassalle-Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; Within the institute both are involved especially in the project [[Jerusalem-Project|''Jerusalem – Open town for learning of the peace in the world'']] which takes them regularly to [[Jerusalem]] and to the [[UN]] in New York.

== Interfaith dialogue ==
According to Brantschen there is no alternative to the [[interfaith dialogue]]. Interfaith dialogue is not only conversation, but also the positive, constructive relations between persons and communities of other religions for their mutual enrichment.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; "To be religious today calls to be interreligious, not only bilaterally but multilaterally.“&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

== Position on Buddhism ==
Brantschen considers the dialog with Buddhism as an enriching, but not straight or concluded way between the East and West, which springs up in the suspense between real Zen-experience and imitation of Christ. He sees strong parallels between Christian [[spiritual practice|spiritual exercises]] and Zen-practice, which for him have formed a synthesis during the years.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

The practice of Zen is a way to remove the barriers between religions, nations and races – to create a united humanity.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

== Partnership of man and woman ==
For Brantschen collaboration in partnership is an important contribution for a necessary global change of consciousness. Something truly new originates only if man and woman live a culture of partnership with [[Women's rights|equal rights]].&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; For him „humanity is like a bird with both wings like man and woman. If a wing is not equally developed, we do have a banking bird which cannot make his way.“&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

== Judgments ==
In his characteristic style Brantschen summarizes his judgments in concise sentences:&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;
* ''Only one who is unselfish, is really happy.''&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;
* ''Who hangs on his spiritual experiences and wants to preserve them, destroys them and obstructs his way to the new.''&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;
* ''A man is not what he "does"; he is not what he "has"; he is not what he "is"; he is what he loves.''&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;
* ''Ethics, which we mean, founds in the careful percipience of life in all of its forms, in clever judgment, and in suitable lasting action for the well-being of all. This is not possible without comprehensive self- and world-experience, without a more profound view of the reality.''&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

== Published works ==
Brantschen has written 14 books, most in German, some edited in Italian or Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[https://portal.d-nb.de/opac.htm?query=Woe%3D115635548&amp;method=simpleSearch Entries of books of Niklaus Brantschen in Catalogue of German National Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Panbabylonism''' (also known as '''Panbabylonianism''') is the school of thought that considered the cultures and religions of the [[Middle East]] and civilization in general to be ultimately derived from Babylonian myths which in turn they viewed as being based on [[Babylonian astronomy]], often in hidden ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toy|first=Crawford H.|authorlink=Crawford H. Toy|date=1910|jstor=3142227|title=Panbabylonianism|journal=[[Harvard Theological Review]]|volume=3|issue=1|pages=47–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

A related school of thought is the Bible-Babel school, which regarded the [[Hebrew Bible]] and [[Judaism]] to be directly derived from [[Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian (Babylonian) mythology]]; both are forms of [[hyperdiffusionism in archaeology]].&lt;ref name=megaliths&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Peter Lancaster|title=Megaliths, Myths, and Men: An Introduction to Astro-Archaeology|date=2000|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, NY|isbn=9780486411453|edition=Dover|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bHMV2-ZoUd8C&amp;pg=PA267&amp;lpg=PA267|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both theories were popular in Germany, and the height of Panbabylonism was from the late 19th century to [[World War I]]. Prominent advocates included [[Friedrich Delitzsch]], [[Peter Jensen (Orientalist)|Peter Jensen]], [[Alfred Jeremias]] and [[Hugo Winckler]].&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Daniel. (2003). ''Aesthetics and Analysis in Writing on Religion: Modern Fascinations''. [[University of California Press]]. pp. 149-158. {{ISBN|978-0520236141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scherer, Frank F. (2015). ''The Freudian Orient: Early Psychoanalysis, Anti-Semitic Challenge, and the Vicissitudes of Orientalist Discourse''. Kanarc Books. p. 18. {{ISBN|978-1-78220-296-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panbabylonist thought largely disappeared from legitimate scholarship after the death of one of its greatest proponents, Hugo Winckler.&lt;ref name=megaliths/&gt; The claims of the school were largely discredited by astronomical and chronological arguments of [[Franz Xaver Kugler]] (a [[Jesuit]] priest).&lt;ref&gt;Jong, Teije de.

In 1847 he formed the ''Archconfraternity of Reparation for blasphemy and the neglect of Sunday'' to promote [[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Reparation}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also noted for his efforts within the Assembly of 1848 for establishing the ecclesiastical college of St. Dizier and for his discussions concerning the educational reforms. He was a member of the commission which prepared the draft project for the [[Falloux Laws]] increasing the Catholic clergy's influence in French education.

"'''pity this busy monster, manunkind'''" is a poem by American poet [[E. E. Cummings]], first published in his 1944 book ''[[1 × 1]]''. It is among his best-known poems.&lt;ref name="Bloom"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=Harold|authorlink=Harold Bloom|title=E. E. Cummings|chapter=James P. Dougherty on the Third Poetic World|date=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438115665|page=96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dv1CjIIRWd0C|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem laments the triumph of [[scientific progress|progress]]—defined in terms of science and technology—over nature, describing progress as a "comfortable disease", and declaring "A world of made / is not a world of born". To Cummings, the "busy monster" is a society bent on subverting nature and individual humanity—these, not "manunkind", are to be pitied. The speaker of the poem suggests in closing, and with an ironic optimism, an escape to "a hell of a good universe next door".&lt;ref name="enotes"&gt;{{cite web|title=pity this busy monster,manunkind Summary|url=https://www.enotes.com/topics/pity-this-busy-monster-manunkind|website=eNotes|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem relies on coined compound words and other wordplay to carry its meaning.&lt;ref name="enotes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Widdowson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Widdowson|first1=Henry|authorlink1=Henry Widdowson|title=Defining Issues in English Language Teaching|date=2003|publisher=Oxform University Press|isbn=9780194374453|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SbtqkmYNA7MC|accessdate=13 January 2017|chapter=English as an international language}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with many of Cummings' poems, his idiosyncratic [[orthography]] and [[grammar]] provide an immediacy to the printed words.&lt;ref name="Bloom"/&gt; Like other [[modernist poetry|modernist]] poets, Cummings uses unusual [[typography]] to draw focus to the [[typewriter]] as an instrument of the machine age.&lt;ref name="enotes"/&gt;

Cummings considered the fourteen-line poem a [[sonnet]], by his own loose definition of the term.&lt;ref name="Jason"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotes"/&gt;

==Saint or Heretic==
Since his first writings, there has been confusion in the church regarding whether he was a saint or a heretic. Ramon Lull has had a sanctification process open in the Vatican since the times of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]. King Philip was one of the impulsors of this process. The Spanish king was extremely fond of his work and used parts of it in the creation of the [[monasterio del Escorial]]. Prior to that, Lull was considered a heretic by most, and the debate regarding both King Philip II and him continued in Rome long afterwards. Lull's works were prohibited by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] under the same king Philip, for he considered that "non-initiates could not understand them". Copies of the works were safely stored in the Library of El Escorial and were consulted by Spanish Scholars, mostly sympathetic to Lull's views.

Within the [[Franciscan Order]] he is honoured as a [[martyr]]. He was [[beatification|beatified]] in 1847 by [[Pope Pius IX]]. His [[feast day]] was assigned to 30 June and is celebrated by the Third Order of St. Francis.&lt;ref name="habig"&gt;Habig, Marion. (Ed.). (1959). ''The Franciscan Book of Saints''. Franciscan Herald Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life and family===
[[File:LifeOfRaymondLull14thCentury.JPG|thumb|Life of Raymond Lull; 14th-century manuscript]]
Llull was born into a wealthy family in [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]], the capital of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Majorca]].  [[James I of Aragon]] founded Majorca to integrate the recently conquered territories of the  [[Balearic Islands]] (now part of [[Spain]]) into the [[Crown of Aragon]]. Llull's parents had come from [[Catalonia]] as part of the effort to colonize the formerly [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] ruled island. As the island had been conquered militarily, the Muslim population who had not been able to flee the conquering Christians had been enslaved, even though they still constituted a significant portion of the island's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bonner | first = Anthony | title = The art and logic of Ramon Llull : a user's guide | publisher = Brill | location = Leiden Boston | year = 2007 | isbn = 9789004163256 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1257 he married Blanca Picany, with whom he had two children, Domènec and Magdalena. Although he formed a family, he lived what he would later call the licentious and wasteful life of a [[troubadour]].

Llull served as tutor to [[James II of Aragon]], and later became [[Seneschal]] (the administrative head of the royal household) to the future [[King James II of Majorca]], a relative of his wife.

===Religious calling===
In 1263 Llull experienced a religious [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] in the form of a series of [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]]. He narrates the event in his autobiography ''Vita coaetanea'' ("Daily Life"):

{{quote|Ramon, while still a young man and Seneschal to the King of Majorca, was very given to composing worthless songs and poems and to doing other licentious things. One night he was sitting beside his bed, about to compose and write in his vulgar tongue a song to a lady whom he loved with a foolish love; and as he began to write this song, he looked to his right and saw our Lord [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] on the Cross, as if suspended in mid-air.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, "Historical Background and Life" (an annotated ''Vita coaetanea'') at 10-11, in Bonner (ed.), ''Doctor Illuminatus'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The vision came to him five times in all, leading him to leave his family, position, and belongings in order to pursue a life in the service of God. Specifically, he realized three intentions: to [[martyrdom|die in the service of God]] while converting Muslims to Christianity, to see to the founding of religious institutions that would teach foreign languages, and to write a book on how to overcome someone's objections to being converted.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, "Historical Background and Life" (an annotated ''Vita coaetanea'') at 6, in Bonner (ed.), ''Doctor Illuminatus'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his epiphany Llull became a Franciscan tertiary (a member of the [[Third Order of Saint Francis]]), taking inspiration from Saint [[Francis of Assisi]]. After a short pilgrimage he returned to Majorca, where he purchased a Muslim slave from whom he wanted to learn Arabic. For the next nine years, until 1274, he engaged in study and contemplation in relative solitude. He read extensively in both Latin and Arabic, learning both Christian and Muslim theological and philosophical thought.

Between 1271 and 1274 he wrote his first works, a compendium of the Muslim thinker [[Al-Ghazali]]'s logic and the ''Llibre de contemplació en Déu'' (''Book on the Contemplation of God''), a lengthy guide to finding truth through contemplation.

In 1274, while staying at a hermitage on [[Puig de Randa]], the form of the great book he was to write was finally given to him through divine revelation: a complex system that he named his ''Art'', which would become the motivation behind most of his life's efforts.

===Missionary work and education===
Llull urged the study of Arabic and other then-insufficiently studied languages in Europe,&lt;ref name="Johnston1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark David Johnston|title=The Evangelical Rhetoric of Ramon Llull: Lay Learning and Piety in the Christian West Around 1300|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rILmCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-509005-5|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with most of his works, to convert Muslims and schismatic Christians.&lt;ref name="Blum2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mr Paul Richard Blum|title=Philosophy of Religion in the Renaissance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQBpfzln0zkC&amp;pg=PA1|date=28 June 2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-8071-6|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled through Europe to meet with popes, kings, and princes, trying to establish special colleges to prepare future missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Richard Blum: Philosophy of Religion in the Renaissance. Ashgate 2010, 1-14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1285, he embarked on his first mission to North Africa but was expelled from [[Tunis]]{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. Llull travelled to Tunis a second time in about 1304, and wrote numerous letters to the king of Tunis, but little else is known about this part of his life.&lt;ref name="Classen2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Albrecht Classen|title=Toleration and Tolerance in Medieval European Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E1NPDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT280|date=5 March 2018|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-00106-9|pages=280–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 14th century, Llull again visited North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, "Historical Background and Life" (the ''Vita coaetanea'' augmented and annotated) at 10-11, 34-37, in Bonner (ed.), ''Doctor Illuminatus'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; He returned in 1308, reporting that the conversion of Muslims should be achieved through prayer, not through military force. He finally achieved his goal of linguistic education at major universities in 1311 when the [[Council of Vienne]] ordered the creation of chairs of [[Hebrew]], [[Arabic]] and Chaldean ([[Aramaic]]) at the universities of [[Bologna]], [[Oxford]], Paris, and [[Salamanca]] as well as at the Papal Court.&lt;ref name="Classen2018" /&gt;

===Llull and the Immaculate Conception===
Following the favourable attitude of some Franciscan theologians to this truth, Llull's position on this subject was of great importance because it paved the way for the doctrine of [[Duns Scotus]], whom he met in 1297, after which he was given the nickname ''Doctor Illuminatus'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/features/saints/saint.aspx?id=1426 AmericanCatholic.org "Blessed Raymond Lull"]&lt;/ref&gt; even if it seems that he had not direct influence on him. Llull is the first author to use the expression "Immaculate Conception" to designate the Virgin's exemption from original sin.&lt;ref&gt;''Mary in the Middle Ages: the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Thought of Medieval Latin Theologians'', Fr. Luigi Gambero, S.M., Ignatius Press: San Francisco, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He appears to have been the first to teach this doctrine publicly at the University of Paris.

To explain this Marian privilege, he resorts to three arguments:

1. The Son of God could not become incarnate in a mother who was stained by sin in any way:

{{quote|God and sin cannot be united in the one and same object... Thus the Blessed Virgin Mary did not contract original sin; rather she was sanctified in the instant in which the seed from which she was formed was detached from her parents.&lt;ref&gt;''Disputatio Eremitae et Raimundi super aliquibus qustionibus Sententiarum Magistri Lombardi'', q. 96, I; ''Opera Omnia'', vol. 4, Mainz, 1737, pp. 84-84&lt;/ref&gt;}}

2. There had to be a certain likeness between the Son's generation without sin and the generation of his Mother:
{{quote|The Blessed Virgin Mary should have been conceived without sin, so that her conception and that of her Son might have a like nature.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., q. 96, 3; ''Opera Omnia'', 4:84&lt;/ref&gt;}}

3. The second creation, that is the Redemption, which began with Christ and Mary, had to happen under the sign of the most total purity, as was the case with the first creation:

{{quote|Just as Adam and Eve remained in innocence until the original sin, so at the beginning of the new creation, when the Blessed Virgin Mary and her Son came into existence, it was fitting that the man and the Woman should be found in a state of innocence ''simpliciter'', in an absolute way, without interruption, from the beginning until the end. Should the opposite have been the case, the new creation could not have begun. It is clear, however, that it did have a beginning, and therefore the Blessed Virgin was conceived without original sin.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., q.96, 4; ''Opera Omnia'', 4:84&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a sermon entitled ''The Fruit of Mary's Womb'', Llull states that,

{{quote|The blessed fruit of our Lady's womb is Jesus Christ, who is true God and true man. He is God the Son, and he is man, the Son of our Lady. The man, her Son, is the blessed fruit because he is God the Son; for it is true that the goodness of the Son who is God and the goodness of the Son who is man are joined together and united in one person, who is Jesus Christ. And the goodness of the man, Mary's Son, is an instrument of the Son, who is God.&lt;ref&gt;''Liber de Ave Maria, sermo'' 5, I; Corpus Christianorum Mediaevalis 76, 95-96&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Death===
In 1314, at the age of 82,  Llull traveled again to North Africa where he was stoned by an angry crowd of Muslims in the city of Bougie{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. Genoese merchants took him back to [[Mallorca]], where he died at home in Palma the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner states that his journey was to [[Tunis]] not Bougie, and dates it from autumn of 1314 until at least December 1315 [42-43]. Bonner also notes that, according to modern scholarship, it was in the mid-15th century that "the legend of Llull having been martyred in Bougie spread" [44, n138].&lt;/ref&gt; Though the traditional date of his death has been 29 June 1315,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia|date=1913|page=670|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FssAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%2229+June+1315%22+llull&amp;dq=%2229+June+1315%22+llull&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwju-oatgfrNAhWKPxQKHZSRA0cQ6AEINzAC|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; his last documents, which date from December 1315, and recent research point to the first quarter of 1316 as the most probable death date.&lt;ref&gt;Who was Ramon Llull? Centre de Documentació Ramon Llull, Universitat de Barcelona [http://quisestlullus.narpan.net/eng/1_intro_eng.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be documented that Llull was buried at the Church of Saint Francis in Mallorca by March 1316{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. Riber states that the circumstances of his death remain a mystery{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. Zwemer, a Protestant missionary and academic, accepted the story of martyrdom, as did an article in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' published in 1911 (see links in the References section). Bonner gives as a reason for Llull's journey to [[History of Tunisia|Tunis]] the information that its ruler was interested in Christianity—false information given to the Kings of Sicily and Aragon and relayed to Llull.&lt;ref&gt;Riber, ''Raimunco Lulio'' (1935, 1949) [220-221]; Bonner, "Historical Background and Life" in his ''Doctor Illuminatus'' (1985) [42-44].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and other works==
Llull was extremely prolific, writing a total of more than 250 works in Catalan, Latin, and Arabic, and often translating from one language to the others. While almost all of his writings after the revelation on Mt. Randa connect to his ''Art'' in some way, he wrote on diverse subjects in a variety of styles and genres.

The romantic novel ''[[Blanquerna]]'' is widely considered the first major work of literature written in Catalan, and possibly the first European novel.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==={{anchor|Ars Magna}} Llull's ''Art'' (''Ars Magna'')===
His first elucidation of the ''Art'' was in ''Art Abreujada d'Atrobar Veritat'' (''The Abbreviated Art of Finding Truth''), in 1290.&lt;ref name="christianlit"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Ramon Llull | encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Christian Literature, Volume 2 | publisher=Scarecrow Press |editor1=Kurian, George Thomas |editor2=Smith III, James D. | year=2010 | pages=433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After spending some time teaching in France and being disappointed by the poor reception of his ''Art'' among students, he decided to revise it. It is this revised version that he became known for. It is most clearly presented in his ''Ars generalis ultima'' or ''Ars magna'' ("The Ultimate General Art" or "The Great Art", published in 1305).

The ''Art'' operated by combining religious and philosophical attributes selected from a number of lists. It is believed that Llull's inspiration for the ''Ars magna'' came from observing Arab astrologers use a device called a [[zairja]].&lt;ref name="link"&gt;Link, David (2010). "Scrambling T-R-U-T-H: Rotating Letters as a Material Form of Thought", in: ''Variantology 4. On Deep Time Relations of Arts, Sciences and Technologies in the Arabic–Islamic World'', eds. Siegfried Zielinski and Eckhard Fürlus (Cologne: König, 2010): 215–266&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Art'' was intended as a debating tool for winning Muslims to the Christian faith through logic and reason. Through his detailed analytical efforts, Llull built an in-depth theosophic reference by which a reader could enter any argument or question (necessarily reduced to Christian beliefs, which Llull identified as being held in common with other monotheistic religions). The reader then used visual aids and a book of charts to combine various ideas, generating statements which came together to form an answer.

====Mechanical aspect====
One of the most significant changes between the original and the second version of the ''Art'' was in the visuals used. The early version used 16 figures presented as complex, complementary [[Tree of Science (Ramon Llull)|trees]], while the system of the ''Ars Magna'' featured only four, including one which combined the other three. This figure, a "Lullian Circle," took the form of a paper machine operated by rotating concentrically arranged circles to combine his symbolic alphabet, which was repeated on each level. These combinations were said to show all possible truth about the subject of inquiry. Llull based this notion on the idea that there were a limited number of basic, undeniable truths in all fields of knowledge, and that everything about these fields of knowledge could be understood by studying combinations of these elemental truths.

The method was an early attempt to use logical means to produce knowledge. Llull hoped to show that Christian doctrines could be obtained artificially from a fixed set of preliminary ideas. For example, the most essential table listed the attributes of God: goodness, greatness, eternity, power, wisdom, will, virtue, truth and glory. Llull knew that all believers in the monotheistic religions—whether Jews, Muslims or Christians—would agree with these attributes, giving him a firm platform from which to argue.

The idea was developed further for more [[esoteric]] purposes by [[Giordano Bruno]] in the 16th century, and in the 17th century by the "Great Rationalist" [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who wrote his dissertation about Llull's ''Art'' and integrated it into his metaphysics and philosophy of science. Leibniz gave Llull's idea{{clarify|reason= Does 'idea' here refer to the 'art' or the 'system' or the 'paper machine' or to all of them as perhaps different names for the same thing?|date=January 2018}} the name ''"ars combinatoria"'', by which it is now often known.

Some [[computer]] scientists have adopted Llull as a sort of founding father, claiming that his [[system of logic]] was the beginning of [[information science]].&lt;ref name="artandlogic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="knuth"/&gt;

===Misattributions===
A considerable body of work on esoteric subjects was misattributed to Llull in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. The oeuvre of the '''pseudo-Llull'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (and, by extension, that of the actual Llull) was influential among [[Hermeticism|Hermeticists]], [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]], and other [[Esotericism|Esoterics]]. Llull himself explicitly condemned many of the subjects, such as [[alchemy]], that he is purported to have written about.{{citation_needed|date=August 2014}}

==Reputation and posthumous reception==
The Roman Catholic inquisitor [[Nicholas Eymerich]] condemned 100 theories or ideas of Llull as errors in 1376. [[Pope Gregory XI]] also formally condemned 20 of his books in 1376&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Dictionary of World Biography, edited by Frank N. Magill and Alison Aves, page 610 | [https://books.google.com/books?id=CurSh3Sh_KMC&amp;lpg=PA610&amp;ots=y2YEgeJn5j&amp;dq=ramon%20llull%20books%20condemned%20pope&amp;pg=PA610#v=onepage&amp;q=ramon%20llull%20books%20condemned%20pope&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; and the condemnation was renewed by [[Pope Paul IV]],&lt;ref&gt;Turner, William. "Raymond Lully." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 5 Dec. 2013 [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12670c.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Pope Martin V]] reversed the condemnation of [[Pope Gregory XI]] in 1416.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Despite these condemnations, Llull himself remained in good standing with the Church.

Chairs for the propagation of the theories of Llull were established at the [[University of Barcelona]] and the [[University of Valencia]]. He is regarded as one of the most influential authors in Catalan; the language is sometimes referred to as ''la llengua de Llull'', as other languages might be referred to as "Shakespeare's language" (English), ''la langue de Molière'' (French), ''la lengua de Cervantes'' (Spanish) or ''die Sprache Goethes'' (German).

The logo of the Spanish ''[[Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas]]'' ("Higher Council of Scientific Research") is Llull's Tree of Science. [[Ramon Llull University]], a private university established in Barcelona in 1990, is named after the philosopher.

===Mathematics, statistics, and classification===

With the discovery in 2001 of his lost manuscripts, ''Ars notandi'', ''Ars eleccionis'', and ''Alia ars eleccionis'', Llull is given credit for discovering the [[Borda count]] and [[Condorcet criterion]], which [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] and [[Marquis de Condorcet|Nicolas de Condorcet]] independently proposed centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=G. Hägele  |author2=F. Pukelsheim  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Llull's writings on electoral systems | journal=Studia Lulliana | year=2001 | volume=41 | pages=3–38 | url=http://www.math.uni-augsburg.de/stochastik/pukelsheim/2001a.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The terms [[Llull winner]] and Llull loser are ideas in contemporary [[voting systems]] studies that are named in honor of Llull.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Also, Llull is recognized as a pioneer of computation theory, especially due to his great influence on [[Gottfried Leibniz]].&lt;ref&gt;'Knowledge representation: logical, philosophical, and computational foundations, by J.F. Sowa. Brooks/Cole, 2000 (page: 7)'&lt;/ref&gt;  Llull's systems of organizing concepts using devices such as trees, ladders, and wheels, have been analyzed as classification systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=T.D. Walker | title=Medieval Faceted Knowledge Classification: Ramon Llull's Trees of Science | journal=Knowledge Organization | year=1996 | volume=23/4 | pages=199–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and architecture===

The inspiration of Llull's mnemonic graphic cartwheels, reaching into contemporary art and culture, is demonstrated by Daniel Libeskind's architectural construction of the 2003 completed [[Barbara Weil#Studio Weil|Studio Weil]] in [[Andratx|Port d'Andratx]], Majorca. "Studio Weil, a development of the virtuality of these mnemonic wheels which ever center and de-center the universal and the personal, is built to open these circular islands which float like all artwork in the oceans of memory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://daniel-libeskind.com/projects/studio-weil | title = Studio Daniel Libeskind:Studio Weil | accessdate = 2011-03-14 | last = Libeskind | first = Daniel | publisher = Studio Daniel Libeskind}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern fiction===

[[Paul Auster]] refers to Llull (as Raymond Lull) in his memoir ''[[The Invention of Solitude]]'' in the second part, ''The Book of Memory''. Llull, now going under the name 'Cole Hawlings' and revealed to be immortal, is a major character in ''[[The Box of Delights]]'', the celebrated children's novel by poet [[John Masefield]].  He is also a major influence on the fictional character Zermano in Thomas Salazar's ''The Day of the Bees'', and his name, philosophies, and quotes from his writings appear throughout the novel. In [[Roberto Bolaño]]'s novel ''[[2666 (novel)|2666]]'', Amalfitano, a Chilean professor, thinks about "Ramon Llull and his fantastic machine. Fantastic in its uselessness."&lt;ref&gt;Bolano, Roberto. 2666. Trans. [[Natasha Wimmer]], New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2008. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Adán, [[Leopoldo Marechal]]'s protagonist of the novel ''[[Adán Buenosayres]]'' (1948), mentions Ramon Lulio when he walks past a ''curtiembre'' (a leather-tanning shop): He says: "Ramon Lulio, que aconsejaba no rehuir del olor de las letrinas a fin de recordar a menudo lo que da el cuerpo de si mismo en su tan frecuentemente olvidada miseria" (Edición Crítica, Colección Archivos, 1997. Page 312) ("''Ramon Llull advised not to shy away from the smell of outhouses, in order not to forget that which the body gives out in its often forgotten misery.''") In [[William Gaddis]]' first novel, ''[[The Recognitions]]'', the final paragraph of Chapter II alludes to "Raymond Lully", as a "scholar, a poet, a missionary, a mystic, and one of the foremost figures in the history of alchemy." Llull is also mentioned in passing in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s comic-book ''Calliope,'' an issue of the [[DC Comics|DC]]/[[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] series ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]].'' In ''[[The Commodore (novel)|The Commodore]]'', the 17th book in [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s [[Aubrey–Maturin series]], Stephen Maturin remarks that his daughter "...will learn Spanish, too, Castellano. I am sorry it will not be Catalan, a much finer, older, purer, more mellifluous language, with far greater writers — think of En Ramon Llull — but as Captain Aubrey often says, 'You cannot both have a stitch in time and eat it.'"

[[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]], in ''[[Deathworld 2]]'', has his protagonist, Jason dinAlt, use the Book of the Order of Chivalry, along with others, to disable the engines of the spaceship on which he is being held.  As the ship starts to blow up, he remarks "I should not have thrown in the Lull book, it is more than even the ship could stomach."  This comes at the end of an argument with his kidnapper, in which dinAlt attacks the idea that there are universal laws which apply to all human beings for all time.

[[W. B. Yeats]] refers to Llull twice in ''Rosa Alchemica'', first published in 1897 ("I turned to my last purchase, a set of alchemical apparatus which, the dealer in the Rue le Peletier had assured me, once belonged to Raymond Lully";&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Yeats, ''Stories of Red Hanrahan &amp; The Secret Rose &amp; Rosa Alchemica'', Serenity Publishers, 2009, pp. 110-111&lt;/ref&gt; and "There were the works [...] of Lully, who transformed himself into the likeness of a red cock"&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'', pp. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;). His "first eight poems in ''The Green Helmet and Other Poems'' were published under the general title 'Raymond Lully and his wife Pernella'; an erratum-slip corrected this: 'AN ERROR By a slip of the pen when I was writing out the heading for the first group of poems, I put Raymond Lully's name in the room of the later Alchemist, [[Nicolas Flamel]]'".&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Yeats, ''The Poems'', Everyman, 1996, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon R. Dickson]] has the protagonist, Hal Mayne, in the book ''The Final Encyclopedia'', (1984) refer to Lull and his combination-of-wheels device, which Hal states is ″nothing less than a sort of primitive computer.″

===Disposition toward Judaism===
Llull's mission to convert the Jews of Europe was zealous; his goal was to utterly relieve Christendom of any Jews or Jewish religious influence. Some scholars regard Llull's as the first comprehensive articulation, in the Christian West, of an [[Jewish refugees|expulsionist policy]] regarding Jews who refused conversion. To acquire converts, he worked for amicable public debate to foster an intellectual appreciation of a rational Christianity among the Jews of his time. His rabbinic opponents included Rabbi [[Shlomo ben Aderet]] of Barcelona and Moshe ben Shlomo of Salerno.&lt;ref&gt;Libre de Contemplacio 287.9, 2:887 in The friars and the Jews: the evolution of medieval anti-Judaism.

'''Roberto Torretti''' (born February 15, 1930 in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Chile]]) is a Chilean philosopher, author and academic who is internationally renowned for his contributions to the history of [[philosophy]], [[physics]] and [[mathematics]].

==Biography==

Torretti received a doctorate from the [[University of Freiburg]], [[Germany]], as a pupil of [[Wilhelm Szilasi]] in 1954. Shortly after he began lecturing in philosophy and psychology at the Institute of Education of the University of Chile in [[Valparaíso]]. He also worked for the [[United Nations]] before commencing an academic career that lasted for more than forty years, during which he taught philosophy in the [[University of Puerto Rico]] and the [[University of Chile]]. Torretti is currently professor emeritus of the [[University of Puerto Rico]], and a member of the ''Institut International de Philosophie''.&lt;ref name="Memoria Chilena. Presentación - Roberto Torretti"&gt;{{cite web|title= Memoria Chilena. Presentación - Roberto Torretti|publisher=memoriachilena.cl|date=2004-03-09|url= http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/index.asp?id_ut=robertotorretti(1930-)|accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2005 Torretti was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona]] in Spain. Torretti resides in Santiago, Chile and is married to the academic and philosopher [[Carla Cordua]].&lt;ref name="Memoria Chilena.

==Philosophy==
[[File:Roberto Torretti and Jesús Mosterín in 2004 in Santiago (Chile).jpg|thumb|Roberto Torretti and [[Jesús Mosterín]] in Santiago (Chile) in 2004]]

Torretti has been greatly influenced by the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] and has dedicated many of his works to Kant’s  thought. His work ''Manuel Kant: estudio sobre los fundamentos de la filosofia critica'' is considered one of the most important literary works on the thoughts of the 18th century German philosopher. Publications such as ''Philosophy of Geometry from Riemann to Poincaré'' (1978), ''Relativity and geometry'' (1983) and ''El paraíso de Cantor'' (1998) have made Torretti a leading authority on the philosophy of science. Much of Torretti’s work has dealt with physics and mathematics, with a major focus on [[Theory of relativity|relativity]] theory and [[History of Geometry|19th century geometry]].&lt;ref name="The Philosophy of Physics by Roberto Torretti"&gt;{{cite web|title= The Philosophy of Physics by Roberto Torretti|publisher=complete-review.com|date=2001-02-08|url= http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/torretti/thepop.htm|accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has devoted the book ''El Paraíso de Cantor'' to the set-theoretical tradition in [[logic]] and [[philosophy of mathematics]]. Together with [[Jesús Mosterín]], he has written an original and comprehensive dictionary of logic and philosophy of science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5157">The '''Robin Hood effect''' is an [[economic]] occurrence where [[income]] is [[income redistribution|redistributed]] so that [[economic inequality]] is reduced.  The effect is named after [[Robin Hood]], said to have stolen from the rich to give to the poor.

==Causes of a Robin Hood effect==

A Robin Hood effect can be caused by a large number of different policies or economic decisions, not all of which are specifically aimed at reducing inequality.  This article lists only some of these.

===Natural national development===

[[Image:Kuznets curve.png|right|320px|thumb|A Kuznets curve]]

{{main|Kuznets curve}}

[[Simon Kuznets]] argued that one major factor behind levels of economic inequality is the stage of [[economic development]] of a country. Kuznets described a curve-like relationship between level of income and inequality, as shown. That theory prescribes that countries with very low levels of development will have relatively equal distributions of wealth.

As a country develops, it necessarily acquires more capital, and the owners of this capital will then have more wealth and income, which introduces inequality. However, eventually various possible redistribution mechanisms such as [[trickle down effect]]s and [[social welfare]] programs will lead to a Robin Hood effect, with wealth redistributed to the poor.  Therefore, more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality.

===Non-proportional income tax===

Many countries have an [[income tax]] system where the first part of a worker's salary is taxed very little or not at all, while those on higher salaries must pay a higher tax rate on earnings over a certain threshold, known as [[progressive taxation]]. This has the effect of the better-off population paying a higher proportion of their salary in tax, effectively subsidising the less-well off, leading to a Robin Hood effect.

Specifically, a progressive tax is a [[tax]] by which the [[tax rate]] increases as the taxable base amount increases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Progressive Webster] (4b): increasing in rate as the base increases (a progressive tax)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/69/P0586900.html American Heritage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209142138/http://bartleby.com/61/69/P0586900.html |date=2009-02-09 }} (6). Increasing in rate as the taxable amount increases.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1B1-375969.html Britannica Concise Encyclopedia]: Tax levied at a rate that increases as the quantity subject to taxation increases.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Progressive+tax Princeton University WordNet]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}: (n) progressive tax (any tax in which the rate increases as the amount subject to taxation increases)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sommerfeld"&gt;Sommerfeld, Ray M., Silvia A. Madeo, Kenneth E. Anderson, Betty R. Jackson (1992), ''Concepts of Taxation'', Dryden Press: Fort Worth, TX&lt;/ref&gt; "Progressive" describes a distribution effect on [[income]] or [[Consumption (economics)|expenditure]], referring to the way the rate progresses from low to high, where the average tax rate is less than the marginal tax rate.&lt;ref name="Hyman"&gt;Hyman, David M. (1990) ''Public Finance: A Contemporary Application of Theory to Policy'', 3rd, Dryden Press: Chicago, IL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="James"&gt;James, Simon (1998) ''A Dictionary of Taxation'', Edgar Elgar Publishing Limited: Northampton, MA&lt;/ref&gt; It can be applied to individual taxes or to a tax system as a whole; a year, multi-year, or lifetime. Progressive taxes attempt to reduce the [[tax incidence]] of people with a lower [[wikt:ability-to-pay|ability-to-pay]], as they shift the incidence increasingly to those with a higher ability-to-pay.

===Cross-subsidisation of mobile telephony===

In many developing countries, [[cellular network|mobile communications networks]] tend to experience a large [[network effect|network externality]], which regulators and operators seek to correct by subsidising subscriptions through increased prices for [[call termination]]. That then allows the less-well off in that country to gain access to communications services, often for free (on a [[prepaid mobile phone|prepay tariff]]). The additional cost is then levied on subscribers who make calls to these new subscribers; the call originators tend to be better-off. Therefore, despite there being no direct transfer of money, there is a strong Robin Hood effect, with the better-off subsidising the less well-off.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5849">{{distinguish|Round Square (educational organisation)}}
The "'''round square copula'''" is a common example of the dual copula strategy used in reference to the problem of [[nonexistence|nonexistent objects]] as well as their relation to problems in modern [[philosophy of language]].  The issue arose, most notably, between the theories of [[Alexius Meinong]], [[Bertrand Russell]]—[[Gilbert Ryle]] playing a minor part as well in the eventual dismissal of Meinong's object theory (see Meinong's 1904 book, ''Theory of Objects'').

==Round square theory==
The strategy employed is the '''dual copula strategy''', which is used to make a distinction between relations of [[properties]] and individuals. It [[logical consequence|entails]] creating a sentence that isn't supposed to make sense by forcing the term "is" into ambiguous meaning.

By borrowing [[Edward Zalta|Edward Zalta's]] notational method (''Fb'' stands for ''b exemplifies'' the property of being ''F''; ''bF'' stands for ''b encodes'' the property of being ''F''), and using a revised version of Meinongian object theory which makes use of a dual copula distinction (''MOT&lt;sup&gt;dc&lt;/sup&gt;''), we can say that the object called "the round square" encodes the property of being round, the property of being square, all properties implied by these, and no others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=nonexistent-objects/#DuaCopStr |title=Dual Copula Strategy |first=Maria |last=Reicher |date=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  But it is true that there are also infinitely many properties being exemplified by an object called the round square (and, really, any object)—e.g. the property of not being a computer, and the property of not being a pyramid.  Note that this strategy has forced "is" to abandon its [[Predicate (mathematics)|predicative]] use, and now functions abstractly.

When one now analyzes the round square copula using the ''MOT&lt;sup&gt;dc&lt;/sup&gt;'', one will find that it now avoids the three common [[paradoxes]]: (1) The violation of the [[law of contradiction]], (2) The paradox of claiming the property of existence without actually existing, and (3) producing counterintuitive consequences.  Firstly, the ''MOT&lt;sup&gt;dc&lt;/sup&gt;'' shows that the round square does not exemplify the property of being round, but the property of being round and square. Thus, there is no subsequent contradiction.  Secondly, it avoids the conflict of existence/non-existence by claiming non-physical existence: by the ''MOT&lt;sup&gt;dc&lt;/sup&gt;'', it can only be said that the round square simply does not exemplify the property of occupying a region in space.  Finally, the ''MOT&lt;sup&gt;dc&lt;/sup&gt;'' avoids counterintuitive consequences (like a 'thing' having the property of nonexistence) by stressing that the round square copula can be said merely to encode the property of being round and square, not actually exemplifying it.  Thus, logically, it does ''not'' belong to any set or class.

In the end, what the ''MOT&lt;sup&gt;dc&lt;/sup&gt;'' really does is created a '''kind''' of object: a nonexistent object that is very different from the objects we might normally think of.  Occasionally, references to this notion, while obscure, may be called "Meinongian objects."

==Criticism and other strategies==
Making use of the notion of "non-physically existent" objects is ''highly'' controversial in philosophy, and created the buzz for many articles and books on the subject during the first half of the 20th century.  There are other strategies for avoiding the problems of Meinong's theories, but they suffer from serious problems as well.

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

===The "other worlds" strategy===
{{main article|Other worlds strategy}}

First is the "other worlds" strategy.  Similar to the ideas explained with [[Possible worlds]] theory, this strategy employs considering that logical principles and the law of contradiction have limits, but without assuming that everything is true.  Enumerated and championed by [[Graham Priest]], who was heavily influenced by [[Richard Routley]], this strategy forms the notion of "[[noneism]]".  In short, assuming there exist infinite possible and impossible worlds, objects are freed from necessarily existing in all worlds, but instead may exist in impossible worlds (where the law of contradiction does not apply, for example) and not in the actual world.  Unfortunately, accepting this strategy entails accepting the host of problems that come with it, such as the ontological status of impossible worlds.

===The "nuclear-extranuclear" strategy===
{{main article|Nuclear-extranuclear strategy}}

Secondly, there is the strategy of nuclear-extranuclear properties.  According to Meinong, it is possible to distinguish the [[nature (philosophy)|natural]] (nuclear) properties of an object, from its external (extranuclear) properties.  [[Terence Parsons]] identifies four types of extranuclear properties: [[ontological]], [[modal analysis|modal]], [[intentional]], [[Technology|technical]]—however, philosophers dispute Parson's claims in number and kind.  Additionally, Meinong states that nuclear properties are either constitutive or consecutive, meaning properties that are either explicitly contained or implied/included in a description of the object.  Essentially the strategy denies the possibility for objects to have only ''one'' property, and instead they may have only one ''nuclear'' property.  Meinong himself, however, found this solution to be inadequate in several ways and its inclusion only served to muddle the definition of an object.

{{Bible related}}
The '''Samaritan Pentateuch''', also known as the '''Samaritan Torah''' ({{lang-he-n|תורה שומרונית}} ''torah shomronit''), is a text of the first five books of the [[Hebrew Bible]], written in the [[Samaritan alphabet]] and used as [[Religious text|scripture]] by the [[Samaritans]]. It constitutes their entire [[biblical canon]]. 

Some six thousand differences exist between the Samaritan and the [[Masoretic Text]]. Most are minor variations in the spelling of words or [[grammatical constructions]], but others involve significant [[semantic]] changes, such as the uniquely Samaritan commandment to construct an altar on [[Mount Gerizim]]. Nearly two thousand of these textual variations agree with the [[Koine Greek]] [[Septuagint]] and some are shared with the [[Latin Vulgate]]. Throughout their history, Samaritans have made use of translations of the Samaritan Pentateuch into [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], Greek and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as well as [[liturgy|liturgical]] and [[exegesis|exegetical]] works based upon it.

It first became known to the Western world in 1631, proving the first example of the [[Samaritan alphabet]] and sparking an intense theological debate regarding its relative age versus the Masoretic text.&lt;ref name=Florentin/&gt; Some Pentateuchal manuscripts discovered among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] have been identified as bearing a "pre-Samaritan" text type.&lt;ref name = "McDonald"&gt;''The Canon Debate'', McDonald &amp; Sanders editors, 2002, chapter 6: ''Questions of Canon through the Dead Sea Scrolls'' by James C. VanderKam, page 94, citing private communication with Emanuel Tov on ''biblical manuscripts'': Qumran scribe type c.25%, proto-Masoretic Text c. 40%, pre-Samaritan texts c.5%, texts close to the Hebrew model for the Septuagint c.5% and nonaligned c.25%.&lt;/ref&gt; Wide agreement now exists among [[textual criticism|textual critics]] that the Samaritan Pentateuch represents an authentic ancient textual tradition despite the presence of some unique variants introduced by the Samaritans.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Origin and canonical significance==

===Samaritan traditions===
[[File:Shomroni tora2.jpg|thumb|left|Samaritan and the Samaritan Torah]]
Samaritans believe that God authored their Pentateuch and gave [[Moses]] the first copy along with the [[Tablets of Stone|two tablets]] containing the [[Ten Commandments]].&lt;ref name = "Gaster"&gt;Gaster, T.H. "Samaritans," pp. 190–197 in ''Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible, Volume 4''. George Arthur Buttrick, gen. ed. Nashville: Abingdon, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that they preserve this divinely composed text uncorrupted to the present day. Samaritans commonly refer to their Pentateuch as {{Hebrew|קושטה}} ("The Truth").&lt;ref name = "Gaster"/&gt;

Samaritans include only the Pentateuch in their biblical canon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC&amp;pg=PA91 Vanderkam 2002, p. 91].&lt;/ref&gt; They do not recognize [[Authorship of the Bible#Divine authorship|divine authorship]] or [[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]] in any other book in the Jewish [[Tanakh]].&lt;ref&gt;Although a paucity of extant source material makes it impossible to be certain that the earliest Samaritans also rejected the other books of the Tanakh, the third-century church father [[Origen]] confirms that the Samaritans in his day "receive[d] the books of Moses alone." ([http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.vi.ix.i.l.html Commentary on John 13:26])&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Book of Joshua (Samaritan)|Samaritan Book of Joshua]] partly based upon the Tanakh's [[Book of Joshua]] exists, but Samaritans regard it as a non-canonical secular historical chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

According to a view based on the biblical [[Book of Ezra]] ({{bibleref2|Ezra|4:11}}), the Samaritans are the people of [[Samaria]] who parted ways with the people of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] (the Judahites) in the [[Yehud Medinata|Persian period]].&lt;ref name="Tov 2001, pp. 82–83"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U1UfMyO-RiEC&amp;pg=PA82 Tov 2001, pp. 82–83].&lt;/ref&gt; The Samaritans believe that it was not they, but the Jews, who separated from the authentic stream of Judaism, around the time of [[Eli (biblical figure)|Eli]], in the 11th century BCE. Jews have traditionally connected the origin of the Samaritans with the later events described in {{bibleverse|2|Kings|17:24–41|HE}} claiming that the Samaritans are not related to the [[Israelites]], but to those brought to Samaria by the Assyrians.&lt;ref name="Tov 2001, pp. 82–83"/&gt;

===Scholarly perspective===
Modern scholarship connects the formation of the Samaritan community with events which followed the [[Babylonian Captivity]]. One view is that the Samaritans are the people of the Kingdom of Israel who separated from the Judaites (people of Judah).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U1UfMyO-RiEC&amp;pg=PA83 Tov 2001, p. 82]&lt;/ref&gt; Another view is that the event happened somewhere around 432 BCE, when Manasseh, the son-in-law of Sanballat, went off to found a community in Samaria, as related in Nehemiah 13:28 and Josephus.&lt;ref&gt;''Antiquities'' XI.7.2; 8.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus himself, however, dates this event and the building of the temple at Shechem to the time of [[Alexander the Great]]. Others believe that the real schism between the peoples did not take place until [[Hasmonean]] times when the Gerizim temple was destroyed in 128 BCE by [[John Hyrcanus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U1UfMyO-RiEC&amp;pg=PA83 Tov 2001, p. 83].&lt;/ref&gt; The script of the Samaritan Pentateuch, its close connections at many points with the Septuagint, and its even closer agreements with the present Hebrew text, all suggest a date about 122 BCE.&lt;ref name = "Buttrick52-35"&gt;Buttrick 1952, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavation work undertaken since 1982 by Yitzhak Magen has firmly dated the temple structures on Gerizim to the middle of the 5th century, built by Sanballat the Horonite, a contemporary of Ezra and Nehemiah, who lived more than one hundred years before the Sanballat that is mentioned by Josephus. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.antiquities.org.il/Article_eng.aspx?sec_id=36&amp;subj_id=286&amp;id=472] &lt;/ref&gt;

The adoption of the Pentateuch as the sacred text of the Samaritans before their final schism with the Palestinian Jewish community provides evidence that it was already widely accepted as a canonical authority in that region.&lt;ref name = "Buttrick52-35"/&gt;

==Comparison with other versions==

===Comparison with the Masoretic===
[[File:Samaritan Pentateuch (detail).jpg|Detail of Samaritan Pentateuch|thumb|left]]
Manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch are written in a different Hebrew script than is used in other Hebrew Pentateuchs. Samaritans employ the Samaritan alphabet which is derived from the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]] used by the Israelite community prior to the Babylonian captivity. Afterwards, Jews adopted a script based on the [[Aramaic alphabet]] that developed into the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. Originally all manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch consisted of unvocalized text written using only the letters of the Samaritan alphabet. Beginning in the 12th century, some manuscripts show a partial vocalization resembling the Jewish [[Tiberian vocalization]] used in Masoretic manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=93_Dc4SC5ngC&amp;pg=PA65 Brotzman 1994, pp. 64–65].&lt;/ref&gt; More recently a few manuscripts have been produced with full vocalization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U1UfMyO-RiEC&amp;pg=PA81 Tov 2001, p. 81].  "Only in recent generations have the Samaritans written a few manuscripts&amp;nbsp;– only for use outside their community&amp;nbsp;– with full vocalization."&lt;/ref&gt; However, many extant manuscripts show no tendency towards vocalization. The Pentateuchal text is divided into 904 paragraphs. Divisions between sections of text are marked with various combinations of lines, dots or an asterisk; a dot is used to indicate the separation between words.&lt;ref name = "Fallows"/&gt;

The [[critical apparatus]] accompanying the London [[Polyglot (book)|Polyglot]]'s publication of the Samaritan Pentateuch lists six thousand instances where the Samaritan differs from the Masoretic Text.&lt;ref name = "Hjelm77"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1oZu6GjRg_IC&amp;pg=PA77 Hjelm 2000, p. 77].&lt;/ref&gt; However, as different printed editions of the Samaritan Pentateuch are based upon different sets of manuscripts, the precise number varies significantly from one edition to another.&lt;ref name = "Purvis"&gt;Purvis, J.D. "Samaritan Pentateuch," pp. 772–775 in ''Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible, Supplementary Volume''. Keith Crim, gen. ed. Nashville: Abingdon, 1976.  {{ISBN|9780687192694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a minority are significant; most can be categorized as one of the following types:
* More ''[[matres lectionis]]'' in the Samaritan Pentateuch to indicate vowels compared with the Masoretic.&lt;ref name = "Purvis"/&gt;
* Loss of the [[gutturals]] in spoken Samaritan Hebrew influenced how Samaritan scribes transcribed words containing these letters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924029099864#page/n301/mode/1up Thomson 1919, pp. 286–289.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Scribal errors caused by the mistaking of one Hebrew letter for another with a similar appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924029099864#page/n303/mode/1up Thomson 1919, pp. 289–296.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Scribal errors resulting in the transposition of letters in a word, or words in a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924029099864#page/n312/mode/1up Thomson 1919, pp. 296–301.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Replacement of archaic Hebrew grammatical constructions with more modern ones.&lt;ref name = "Vanderkam93"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC&amp;pg=PA93 Vanderkam 2002, p. 93].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Textual adjustments to resolve grammatical difficulties and replace rare grammatical forms with more common ones.&lt;ref name = "Vanderkam93"/&gt;
* A variety of minor grammatical variations such as the Samaritan's preference for the Hebrew [[preposition]] 'al where the Masoretic has 'el.&lt;ref name = "Purvis"/&gt;

Among the most notable semantic differences are those related to the Samaritan place of worship on [[Mount Gerizim]]. The Samaritan version of the Ten Commandments commands that an altar be built on [[Mount Gerizim]] on which all sacrifices should be offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.meson.org/religion/torahcompare.php |title=Overview of the Differences Between the Jewish and Samaritan Versions of the Pentateuch |publisher=Web.meson.org |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Soggin"/&gt; The Samaritan Pentateuch contains this text at Exodus 20:17:
{{quote|And when it so happens that LORD God brings you to the land of Canaan, which you are coming to possess, you shall set up there for you great stones and plaster them with plaster and you write on the stones all words of this law. And it becomes for you that across the Jordan you shall raise these stones, which I command you today, in mountain Gerizim. And you build there the altar to the LORD God of you. Altar of stones. Not you shall wave on them iron. With whole stones you shall build the altar to LORD God of you. And you bring on it ascend offerings to LORD God of you, and you sacrifice peace offerings, and you eat there and you rejoice before the face of the LORD God of you. The mountain this is across the Jordan behind the way of the rising of the sun, in the land of Canaan who is dwelling in the desert before the Galgal, beside Alvin-Mara, before Sechem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/interlinearpentateuch/online-samaritan-pentateuch-in-english/exodus |title=Exodus – Interlinear Pentateuch |publisher=Google |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This commandment is absent from the corresponding text of the Ten Commandments in the Masoretic. The Samaritan Pentateuch's inclusion of the Gerizim variation within the Ten Commandments places additional emphasis on the divine sanction given to that community's place of worship.&lt;ref name = "Purvis"/&gt; This variation has similarities to {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|27:2-8|HE}} and is supported by changes to the verbal tense within the Samaritan text of Deuteronomy indicating that God has already chosen this place.  The future tense ("will choose") is used in the Masoretic.&lt;ref name = "Purvis"/&gt; And whereas {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|27:4|HE}} in the Masoretic commands an altar to be constructed on [[Mount Ebal]], the Samaritan texts has Mount Gerizim.

In ({{bibleverse||Exodus|23:19|HE}}) Samaritan Pentateuch contains the following passage after the prohibition: [כי עשה זאת כזבח שכח ועברה היא לאלהי יעקב] which roughly translates "that one doing this as sacrifice forgets and enrages God of Jacob".

In ({{bibleverse||Numbers|4:14|HE}}) Samaritan Pentateuch contains the following passage: [ולקחו בגד ארגמן וכסו את הכיור ואת כנו ונתנו אתם אל מכסה עור תחש ונתנו על המוט] which roughly translates "And they will take a purple covering and cover the laver and his foot, and they cover it in Tachash skins, and they put it upon a bar."

Several other types of differences are found. The Samaritan Pentateuch uses less [[anthropomorphic]] language in descriptions of God with intermediaries performing actions the Masoretic version attributes directly to God. Where the Masoretic describes [[Yahweh]] as a "man of war" ({{bibleverse||Exodus|15:3|HE}}), the Samaritan has "hero of war", a phrase applied to spiritual beings, and in {{bibleverse||Numbers|23:4|HE}}, the Samaritan reading "The [[Angel of the Lord|Angel of God]] found [[Balaam]]" contrasts with the Masoretic "And God met Balaam."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924029099864#page/n326/mode/1up Thomson 1919, p. 312.]&lt;/ref&gt;  A few differences reflect Samaritan notions of propriety, such as the alteration in {{bibleverse||Genesis|50:23|HE}} of the Masoretic "upon the knees of Joseph" to "in the days of Joseph." Samaritan scribes, who interpreted this verse literally, found it improper that the mother of Joseph's grandchildren would give birth on his knees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC&amp;pg=PA94 Vanderkam 2002, p. 94].&lt;/ref&gt;  Distinctive variants in the Samaritan are also found in certain legal texts where Samaritan practice varies from that prescribed within rabbinical [[halachic]] texts.&lt;ref name = "Purvis"/&gt;

In about thirty-four instances, the Samaritan Pentateuch imports text from parallel or synoptic passages in other parts of the Pentateuch.&lt;ref name = "Purvis"/&gt; These textual expansions record conversations and events that are implied or presupposed by other parts of the narrative, but not explicitly recorded in the Masoretic text. For example, the Samaritan text in the [[Book of Exodus]] on multiple occasions records Moses repeating to [[Pharaoh]] exactly what both the Samaritan and Masoretic record God instructing Moses to tell him. The result is repetitious, but the Samaritan makes it clear that Moses spoke exactly as God commanded him.&lt;ref name = "Purvis"/&gt; In addition to these substantial textual expansions, the Samaritan Pentateuch on numerous occasions adds [[subject (grammar)|subjects]], prepositions, [[grammatical particle|particles]], [[apposition|appositives]], and the repetition of words and phrases within a single passage to clarify the meaning of the text.&lt;ref name = "Purvis"/&gt;

===Comparison with the Septuagint and Latin Vulgate===
The [[Septuagint]] (LXX) agrees with the Samaritan in approximately 1900 of the six thousand variations from the Masoretic.&lt;ref name = "Hjelm77"/&gt;  Many of these agreements reflect inconsequential grammatical details, but some are significant.  For example, {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:40|HE}} in the Samaritan and the Septuagint reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{EBD|prescript=|wstitle=Samaritan Pentateuch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Now the sojourning of the children of Israel and of their fathers which they had dwelt in the land of [[Canaan]] and in [[Egypt]] was four hundred and thirty years."

In the Masoretic text, the passage reads:

:"Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years."

Some passages in the Latin Vulgate show agreements with the Samaritan against the Masoretic.  For example, {{bibleverse||Genesis|22:2|HE}} in the Samaritan has "land of [[Moreh]]" (Hebrew: מוראה) while the Masoretic has "land of [[Moriah]]" (Hebrew: מריה).  "Land of Moreh" is considered to be a Samaritan variant because "Moreh" describes the region around [[Shechem]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wi9OAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA31 Barton 1903, p. 31].&lt;/ref&gt; where Mount Gerizim is situated.  The Vulgate translates this phrase as ''in terram visionis'' ("in the land of vision") which implies that [[Jerome]] was familiar with the reading "Moreh", a Hebrew word whose [[Semitic root|trilateral root]] suggests  "vision."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924029099864#page/n328/mode/1up Thomson 1919, pp. 312–313.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluations of its relevance for textual criticism==
The earliest recorded assessments of the Samaritan Pentateuch are found in [[rabbinical literature]] and Christian [[church fathers|patristic]] writings of the first millennium CE.  The [[Talmud]] records [[Rabbi]] [[Eleazar b. Simeon]] condemning the Samaritan scribes: "You have falsified your Pentateuch...and you have not profited aught by it."&lt;ref name = "Fallows"&gt;{{cite book|last = Fallows| first = Samuel|author2=Andrew Constantinides Zenos |author3=Herbert Lockwood Willett | title = The Popular and Critical Bible Encyclopædia and Scriptural Dictionary, Volume 3| publisher = Howard-Severance| year = 1911| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FLRUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1701 |page=1701}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some early Christian writers found the Samaritan Pentateuch useful for [[textual criticism]]. [[Cyril of Alexandria]], [[Procopius of Gaza]] and others spoke of certain words missing from the Jewish Bible, but present in the Samaritan Pentateuch.&lt;ref name = "Fallows"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Du Pin| first = Louis Ellies| title = A compleat history of the canon and writers of the books of the Old and New Testament, Volume 1| publisher = H.

The publication of a manuscript of the Samaritan Pentateuch in 17th-century Europe reawakened interest in the text and fueled a controversy between [[Protestants]] and [[Roman Catholics]] over which [[Old Testament]] textual traditions are authoritative.  Roman Catholics showed a particular interest in the study of the Samaritan Pentateuch on account of the antiquity of the text and its frequent agreements with the Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate, two Bible translations to which Catholics have traditionally ascribed considerable authority.&lt;ref name = "Vanderkam93"/&gt;  Some Catholics including [[Jean Morin (theologian)|Jean Morin]], a convert from [[Calvinism]] to Catholicism, argued that the Samaritan Pentateuch's correspondences with the Latin Vulgate and Septuagint indicated that it represents a more authentic Hebrew text than the Masoretic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/samaritansearlie00montuoft#page/288/mode/1up Montgomery 1907, p. 288].&lt;/ref&gt;  Several Protestants replied with a defense of the Masoretic text's authority and argued that the Samaritan text is a late and unreliable derivation from the Masoretic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924029099864#page/n290/mode/1up Thomson 1919, pp. 275–276.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th-century Protestant Hebrew scholar [[Benjamin Kennicott]]'s analysis of the Samaritan Pentateuch stands as a notable exception to the general trend of early Protestant research on the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Saebo |first=Magne |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OMlT-FViF40C&amp;pg=PA796 |title=Hebrew Bible / Old Testament: The History of Its Interpretation |publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |year=2008 |ISBN=9783525539828}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He questioned the underlying assumption that the Masoretic text must be more authentic simply because it has been more widely accepted as the authoritative Hebrew version of the Pentateuch:

:"We see then that as the evidence of one text destroys the evidence of the other and as there is in fact the authority of versions to oppose to the authority of versions no certain argument or rather no argument at all can be drawn from hence to fix the corruption on either side".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MSMUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA32 Kennicott 1759, p. 32].&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennicott also states&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AORDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA20 Kennicott 1759, p. 20].&lt;/ref&gt; that the reading Gerizim may actually be the original reading, since that is the mountain for proclaiming blessings, and that it is very green and rich of vegetation (as opposed to Mt. Ebal, which is barren and the mountain for proclaiming curses) amongst other arguments.

German scholar [[Wilhelm Gesenius]] published a study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Gesenius|first = Wilhelm |title = De Pentateuchi Samaritani origine, indole et auctoritate commentatio philologico-critica |publisher = Halae |url = https://archive.org/details/depentateuchisa00gesegoog |year = 1815}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Samaritan Pentateuch in 1815 which biblical scholars widely embraced for the next century.  He argued that the Septuagint and the Samaritan Pentateuch share a common source in a family of Hebrew manuscripts which he named the "Alexandrino-Samaritanus".  In contrast to the proto-Masoretic "Judean" manuscripts carefully preserved and copied in [[Jerusalem]], he regarded the Alexandrino-Samaritanus as having been carelessly handled by scribal copyists who popularized, simplified, and expanded the text.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC&amp;pg=PA92 Vanderkam 2002, pp. 92–93].&lt;/ref&gt;  Gesenius concluded that the Masoretic text is almost invariably superior to the Samaritan.&lt;ref&gt;Gesenius believed that the Samaritan Pentateuch contained only four valid variants as compared to the Masoretic text. ([https://archive.org/stream/samaritansearlie00montuoft#page/288/mode/1up Montgomery 1907, p. 288].)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915 [[Paul E. Kahle|Paul Kahle]] published a paper&lt;ref&gt;Kahle, Paul. ''Theologische Studien und Kritiken'' 88 (1915): 399–429.&lt;/ref&gt; which compared passages from the Samaritan text to Pentateuchal quotations in the [[New Testament]] and [[pseudepigrapha]]l texts including the [[Book of Jubilees]], the [[First Book of Enoch]] and the [[Assumption of Moses]].  He concluded that the Samaritan Pentateuch preserves "many genuine old readings and an ancient form of the Pentateuch."&lt;ref name = "Vanderkam93"/&gt;  Support for Kahle's thesis was bolstered by the discovery of biblical manuscripts among the Dead Sea Scrolls, approximately five percent&lt;ref name = "McDonald"/&gt; of which contain a text similar to the Samaritan Pentateuch.&lt;ref&gt;Some examples include the Dead Sea Scroll manuscripts conventionally designated as 4QpaleoExod&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;, 4QExod-Lev&lt;sup&gt;f&lt;/sup&gt; and 4QNum&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;.  See [https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC&amp;pg=PA95 Vanderkam 2002, p. 95].&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the sectarian variants unique to the Samaritan Pentateuch such as the reference to the worship of God on Mount Gerizim, the Dead Sea Scroll texts have demonstrated that a Pentateuchal text type resembling the Samaritan Pentateuch goes back to the second century BCE and perhaps even earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U1UfMyO-RiEC&amp;pg=PA80 Tov 2001, p. 80].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC&amp;pg=PA95 Vanderkam 2002, p. 95].&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Dead Sea Scroll Pentateuchal manuscripts show a close affinity to the later Masoretic text.  These discoveries have demonstrated that manuscripts bearing a "pre-Samaritan" text of at least some portions of the Pentateuch such as [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC&amp;pg=PA106 Vanderkam 2002, p. 106].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC&amp;pg=PA110 Vanderkam 2002, p. 110].&lt;/ref&gt; circulated alongside other manuscripts with a "pre-Masoretic" text.  One Dead Sea Scroll copy of the Book of Exodus, conventionally named 4QpaleoExod&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;, shows a particularly close relation to the Samaritan Pentateuch:
:The scroll shares all the major typological features with the SP, including all the major expansions of that tradition where it is extant (twelve), with the single exception of the new tenth commandment inserted in Exodus 20 from Deuteronomy 11 and 27 regarding the altar on Mount Gerizim.&lt;ref&gt;Skehan, Patrick, Eugene Ulrich and Judith Sanderson (1992).  ''Discoveries in the Judean Desert, Volume IX.''  Quoted in Hendel, Ronald S.

Oxford: Oxford University Press.  {{ISBN|9780199207237}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Moore Cross]] has described the origin of the Samaritan Pentateuch within the context of his local texts hypothesis.  He views the Samaritan Pentateuch as having emerged from a manuscript tradition local to Palestine.  The Hebrew texts that form the underlying basis for the Septuagint branched from the Palestinian tradition as Jews emigrated to Egypt and took copies of the Pentateuch with them. Cross states that the Samaritan and the Septuagint share a nearer common ancestor than either does with the Masoretic, which he suggested developed from local texts used by the Babylonian Jewish community.  His explanation accounts for the Samaritan and the Septuagint sharing variants not found in the Masoretic and their differences reflecting the period of their independent development as distinct Egyptian and Palestinian local text traditions.&lt;ref name = "Purvis"/&gt;  On the basis of archaizing and pseudo-archaic forms, Cross dates the emergence of the Samaritan Pentateuch as a uniquely Samaritan textual tradition to the post-[[Maccabaean]] age.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Moore Cross]] [[Harvard Theological Review]] July 1966 "The language of the Samaritan Pentateuch also includes archaizing forms and pseudo-archaic forms which surely point to the post-Maccabaean age for its date"&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have tended to presuppose that the Samaritan Pentateuch consists of two "layers", one composed of the sectarian variants introduced by Samaritan scribes and a second layer reflecting the text's earlier transmission history as a "pre-Samaritan" Palestinian local text.  In light of recent research "it is now clear that the Samaritan layer is very thin."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pzo6KAH3FmUC&amp;pg=PA401 Crown 2001, p. 401].&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the majority of scholars continue to favor the Masoretic as a superior text, many other scholars have now adopted Kahle's thesis.&lt;ref name = "Vanderkam93"/&gt;  Scholars now widely agree though that many textual variants previously classified as "Samaritan" actually derive from even earlier phases of the Pentateuch's textual history.

Kennicott's claim that Gerizim is the original reading continues to be a subject of discussion.  Dead Sea Scroll fragment 4Q41(981) contains a text of {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|5:1–25|HE}} which makes no reference to Mount Gerizim, but matches the Masoretic Text.  The [[New Testament]] also agrees with the Masoretic version designating [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] as the "chosen place".&lt;ref&gt;John 4:21, 22, Luke 9:53&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some scholars hold that {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|27:4–7|HE}} constitutes one occasion where the Samaritan's "Gerizim" may be the original reading."&lt;ref name = "Soggin"&gt;{{cite book|last = Soggin| first = J.

===Translations===
The Samaritan [[Targum]], composed in the Samaritan [[dialect]] of Aramaic, is the earliest translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch.  Its creation was motivated by the same need to translate the Pentateuch into the Aramaic language spoken by the community which led to the creation of Jewish Targums such as [[Targum Onkelos]].  Samaritans have traditionally ascribed the Targum to Nathanael, a Samaritan priest who died circa 20 BCE.&lt;ref name = "CathEncyc"&gt;{{Catholic|prescript=|wstitle=Samaritan Language and Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Samaritan Targum has a complex textual tradition represented by manuscripts belonging to one of three fundamental text types exhibiting substantial divergences from one another.  Affinities that the oldest of these textual traditions share with the Dead Sea Scrolls and Onkelos suggest that the Targum may originate from the same school which finalized the Samaritan Pentateuch itself.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e5iW24esf-sC&amp;pg=PA18 Crown 2001, p. 18].&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have placed the origin of the Targum around the beginning of the third century&lt;ref name = "CathEncyc"/&gt; or even later.&lt;ref&gt;Buttrick 1952, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;  Extant manuscripts of the Targum are "extremely difficult to use"&lt;ref name = "Brotzman"/&gt; on account of scribal errors caused by a faulty understanding of Hebrew on the part of the Targum's translators and a faulty understanding of Aramaic on the part of later copyists.

[[Scholia]] of [[Origen]]'s [[Hexapla]] and the writings of some [[church fathers]] contain references to "the [[Samaritikon]]" (Greek: το Σαμαρείτικον).,&lt;ref name = "CathEncyc"/&gt; a work that is no longer extant.  Despite earlier suggestions that it was merely a series of Greek scholia translated from the Samaritan Pentateuch,&lt;ref name = "Fallows"/&gt; scholars now concur that it was a complete Greek translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch either directly translated from it or via the Samaritan Targum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Marcos| first = Natalio| title = The Septuagint in Context: Introduction to the Greek Version of the Bible |publisher = Brill |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8MbvEZ4bgdwC&amp;pg=PA168 | year = 2000 |page = 168 |ISBN = 9789004115743}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It may have been composed for the use of a Greek-speaking Samaritan community residing in Egypt.&lt;ref name = "CathEncyc"/&gt;

With the displacement of Samaritan Aramaic by Arabic as the language of the Samaritan community in the centuries following the [[Muslim conquest of Syria]], they employed several Arabic translations of the Pentateuch.  The oldest was an adaptation of [[Saadia Gaon]]'s Arabic translation of the Jewish Torah.  Although the text was modified to suit the Samaritan community, it still retained many unaltered Jewish readings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e5iW24esf-sC&amp;pg=PA23 Crown 2001, p. 23].&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 11th or 12th centuries, a new Arabic translation directly based upon the Samaritan Pentateuch had appeared in [[Nablus]].  Manuscripts containing this translation are notable for their bilingual or trilingual character; the Arabic text is accompanied by the original Samaritan Hebrew in a parallel column and sometimes the Aramaic text of the Samaritan Targum in a third.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e5iW24esf-sC&amp;pg=PA24 Crown 2001, p. 24].&lt;/ref&gt;  Later Arabic translations also appeared; one featured a further Samaritan revision of Saadia Gaon's translation to bring it into greater conformity with the Samaritan Pentateuch and others were based upon Arabic Pentateuchal translations used by Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e5iW24esf-sC&amp;pg=PA25 Crown 2001, pp. 24–25].&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, a complete English translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch comparing it to the Masoretic version was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Tsedaka| first = Benyamim|author2=Sharon Sullivan | title = The Israelite Samaritan Version of the Torah: First English Translation Compared with the Masoretic Version| location = Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA |publisher = Wm.

===Exegetical and liturgical texts===
Several biblical commentaries and other theological texts based upon the Samaritan Pentateuch have been composed by members of the Samaritan community from the fourth century CE onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/samaritansearlie00montuoft#page/294/mode/1up Montgomery 1907, pp. 293–297].&lt;/ref&gt;  Samaritans also employ [[liturgy|liturgical]] texts containing [[Catena (Biblical commentary)|catenae]] extracted from their Pentateuch.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/samaritansearlie00montuoft#page/297/mode/2up Montgomery 1907, pp. 297–298].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts and printed editions==

===Manuscripts===
====Abisha Scroll====
[[File:AbishaTashqil.jpg|thumb|The first two words of the ''tashqil'' colophon on the Abisha Scroll, which reads, "I, Abishua".]]
Samaritans attach special importance to the ''Abisha Scroll'' used in the Samaritan synagogue of Nablus. It consists of a continuous length of [[parchment]] sewn together from the skins of rams that, according to a Samaritan tradition, were ritually sacrificed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wi9OAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA9 Barton 1903, p. 9].&lt;/ref&gt;  The text is written in gold letters.&lt;ref name = "Fallows"/&gt;  Rollers tipped with ornamental knobs are attached to both ends of the parchment and the whole is kept in a cylindrical silver case when not in use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wi9OAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA9 Barton 1903, pp. 9–10].&lt;/ref&gt;  Samaritans claim it was penned by [[Abishua]], great-grandson of [[Aaron]] ({{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|6:50|HE}}), thirteen years after the entry into the land of Israel under the leadership of [[Joshua]], son of Nun,&lt;ref&gt;The Abisha scroll makes this claim for itself in a note inserted between columns of text at Deuteronomy 5. ([https://archive.org/stream/samaritansearlie00montuoft#page/287/mode/1up Montgomery 1907, p. 287])&lt;/ref&gt; although contemporary scholars describe it as a composite of several fragmentary scrolls each penned between the 12th and 14th centuries CE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MURxhWhTRTQC&amp;pg=PA215 Eshel 2003, p. 215].&lt;/ref&gt;  Other manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch consist of [[vellum]] or cotton paper written upon with black ink.&lt;ref name = "Fallows"/&gt;  Numerous manuscripts of the text exist, but none written in the original Hebrew or in translation predates the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name = "Vanderkam93"/&gt; The scroll contains a cryptogram, dubbed the ''tashqil'' by scholars, which Samaritans consider to be Abishua's ancient colophon:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I, Abishua,—the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, unto them be accorded the grace of YHWH and His glory—wrote the holy book at the entrance of the tabernacle of the congregation, at Mount Gerizim, in the year thirteen of the possession by the children of Israel, of the Land of Canaan according to its boundaries [all] around; I praise YHWH.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Western scholarship===
[[File:Genesis 5 18 as published by Jean Morin in 1631 in the first publication of the Samaritan Pentateuch.png|thumb|Genesis 5:18-22 as published by Jean Morin in 1631 in the first publication of the Samaritan Pentateuch]]
Interest in the Samaritan Pentateuch was awakened in 1616 when the traveler [[Pietro della Valle]] purchased a copy of the text in [[Damascus]].  This manuscript, now known as Codex B, was deposited in a [[Paris]]ian library.  In 1631, an edited copy of Codex B was published in Le Jay's (Paris) Polyglot by Jean Morin.&lt;ref name=Florentin&gt;{{harvnb| Flôrenṭîn|2005|p=1}}: "When the Samaritan version of the Pentateuch was revealed to the Western world early in the 17th century... [footnote: 'In 1632 the Frenchman Jean Morin published the Samaritan Pentateuch in the Parisian Biblia Polyglotta based on a manuscript that the traveler Pietro Della Valle had bought from Damascus sixteen years previously.]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IOAtAAAAYAAJ Exercitationes ecclesiasticae in utrumque Samaritanorum Pentateuchum], 1631&lt;/ref&gt;  It was republished in Walton's Polyglot in 1657.  Subsequently, [[Archbishop Ussher]] and others procured additional copies which were brought to Europe and later, America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Cowper| first = B.

===Modern publications===
Until the latter half of the 20th century, [[Textual criticism|critical edition]]s of the Samaritan Pentateuch were largely based upon Codex B.  The most notable of these is ''Der Hebräische Pentateuch der Samaritaner'' (''The Hebrew Pentateuch of the Samaritans'') compiled by August von Gall and published in 1918.  An extensive critical apparatus is included listing variant readings found in previously published manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch.  His work is still regarded as being generally accurate despite the presence of some errors, but it neglects important manuscripts including the Abisha Scroll which had not yet been published at the time.&lt;ref name = "Vanderkam93"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brotzman notes that Gall's edition "because of the principles used to prepare it, must be used with caution." ([https://books.google.com/books?id=93_Dc4SC5ngC&amp;pg=PA66 Brotzman 1994, p. 66].)&lt;/ref&gt;  Textual variants found in the Abisha scroll were published in 1959 by Federico Pérez Castro&lt;ref name = "Brotzman"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=93_Dc4SC5ngC&amp;pg=PA66 Brotzman 1994, p. 66].&lt;/ref&gt;  and between 1961 and 1965 by A. and R. Sadaqa in ''Jewish and Samaritan Versions of the Pentateuch&amp;nbsp;– With Particular Stress on the Differences Between Both Texts''.&lt;ref name = "Vanderkam93"/&gt; In 1976 L.F. Giron-Blanc published Codex Add. 1846, a Samaritan Pentateuch codex dating to 1100 CE in the critical edition ''Pentateuco Hebreo-Samaritano: Génesis'' supplemented with variants found in fifteen previously unpublished manuscripts.&lt;ref name = "Brotzman"/&gt;  Certain recently published critical editions of Pentateuchal books take Samaritan variants into account, including D.L. Phillips' edition of Exodus.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, D.L. ''Hebrew-English: Paleo Exodus: Scripture at the End of the Iron II Period.'' Edwin Mellen, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several publications containing the text of the Samaritan Targum have appeared.  In 1875, the German scholar Adolf Brüll published his ''Das samaritanische Targum zum Pentateuch'' (''The Samaritan Targum to the Pentateuch'').  More recently a two volume set edited by Abraham Tal appeared featuring the first critical edition based upon all extant manuscripts containing the Targumic text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Tal| first = Abraham F. |title = The Samaritan Targum of the Pentateuch: a critical edition (2 vols.)(Texts and Studies in the Hebrew Language and Related Subjects, 5.) |location = Tel-Aviv |publisher = Tel-Aviv University| year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Ben-Dov was born in [[Vilnius]], then part of [[Poland]] in 1924 and moved to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] in 1935.&lt;ref name=daat /&gt;&lt;ref name=auto&gt;{{cite book |title=מהלח חיי |url=http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/vl/bendov/bendov04.pdf |first=Shabtai |last=Ben-Dov}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Irgun]], which was [[British–Zionist conflict|fighting the British]] for control of the region.&lt;ref name=har&gt;{{cite book |title=הר המריבה |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FdBqjD1BC7QC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%99+%D7%91%D7%9F+%D7%93%D7%91&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ja72T8HNB6mk4ATd-P3XBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%99%20%D7%91%D7%9F%20%D7%93%D7%91&amp;f=false |first=Nadav |last=Shragai |authorlink=Nadav Shragai}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] split from [[Irgun]], Ben-Dov joined the former to continue fighting the British, who he didn't think were doing enough to try and stop the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name=har /&gt; He was caught, imprisoned, and eventually exiled to Africa by the British.&lt;ref name=daat /&gt;&lt;ref name=end&gt;{{cite book |title=The End of Days: Fundamentalism and the Struggle for the Temple Mount |first=Gershom |last=Gorenberg |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LCZDYk0W_VcC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=%22shabtai+ben+dov%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FFdRi8LMX4&amp;sig=BTYTpwlH184-IDLo7J28dqQrGtc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Cc71T8GeLO-N4gSPidnVBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22shabtai%20ben%20dov%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Israel after the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|establishment of the State of Israel]] in 1948, and fought in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]'s 89th battalion.&lt;ref name=daat /&gt;

After the [[Six-Day War]] in which Israel captured the [[Temple Mount]], but allowed the [[Jerusalem Islamic Waqf]] to control it, Ben-Dov sued the government. He demanded that the Temple Mount be controlled by those who would "protect it as a Jewish holy place".&lt;ref name=end /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org.il/index.php?option=com_consti_comp&amp;mytask=view&amp;class=1&amp;id=386 |title=בג"ץ 223/67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Ben-Dov believed in a theory of active redemption: that the [[Mashiach]] would only come through a bloody national conquest, and that [[Jew]]s who believed non-violent means could bring about the end of days were naive.&lt;ref name=holywar&gt;{{cite book |title=Holy War: The Rise of Militant Christian, Jewish, and Islamic Fundamentalism |first=David S. |last=New |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R6pgCWiDZ-4C&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=%22shabtai+ben+dov%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X6NxK0hPZC&amp;sig=UZvzwsV2e5OgTbxkOCDk0daD8_A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Cc71T8GeLO-N4gSPidnVBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22shabtai%20ben%20dov%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that Israel should be a [[theocratic]] state instead of a [[democracy|democratic]] one in order to keep the people focused on the cause of conquest.&lt;ref name=end /&gt; The establishment of the [[Third Temple]] would speedily bring about a world government based on Jewish values governed by a [[Sanhedrin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VBoVr089GwC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=shabtai+ben+dov&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=t9r1T-vCNqGB4ASrzODHBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=shabtai%20ben%20dov&amp;f=false |title=The Land Beyond Promise: Israël, Likud and the Zionist Dream |first=Colin |last=Shindler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Society of Mind''''' is both the title of a 1986 book and the name of a theory of natural [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] as written and developed by [[Marvin Minsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Minsky|first1=Marvin|title=The Society of Mind|date=1986|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0-671-60740-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In his book of the same name, Minsky constructs a model of human intelligence step by step, built up from the interactions of simple parts called ''[[wiktionary:agent|agent]]s'', which are themselves mindless.  He describes the postulated [[interaction]]s as constituting a "society of mind", hence the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minsky|first=Marvin|title=The Society of Mind|date=1986|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0-671-60740-5|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The book==
The work, which first appeared in 1986, was the first comprehensive description of Minsky's "society of mind" theory, which he began developing in the early 1970s. It is composed of 270 self-contained essays which are divided into 30 general chapters. The book was also made into a CD-ROM version.

In the process of explaining the society of mind, Minsky introduces a wide range of ideas and concepts.  He develops theories about how processes such as [[language]], [[memory]], and [[learning]] work, and also covers concepts such as [[consciousness]], the sense of [[self (philosophy)|self]], and [[free will]];  because of this, many view ''The Society of Mind'' as a work of philosophy.

The book was not written to prove anything specific about [[artificial intelligence|AI]] or [[cognitive science]], and does not reference physical brain structures.  Instead, it is a collection of ideas about how the mind and thinking work on the conceptual level.

==The theory==
Minsky first started developing the theory with [[Seymour Papert]] in the early 1970s. Minsky said that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a video camera, and a computer to build with children's blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minsky|first=Marvin|title=The Society of Mind|date=1986|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0-671-60740-5|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of mind==
A core tenet of Minsky's philosophy is that "minds are what [[brain]]s do". The society of mind theory views the human mind and any other naturally evolved [[cognitive]] systems as a vast society of individually simple processes known as ''agents''. These processes are the fundamental thinking entities from which minds are built, and together produce the many abilities we attribute to minds. The great power in viewing a mind as a society of agents, as opposed to the consequence of some basic principle or some simple [[formal system]], is that different agents can be based on different types of processes with different purposes, ways of representing knowledge, and methods for producing results.
 
This idea is perhaps best summarized by the following quote:
{{quote|What magical trick makes us intelligent? The trick is that there is no trick. The power of intelligence stems from our vast diversity, not from any single, perfect principle. —Marvin Minsky, ''The Society of Mind'', p. 308}}

'''Sufism Reoriented''' is an [[United States|American]] school of spiritual training, headquartered in [[Walnut Creek, California|Walnut Creek]], [[California]], established by [[Meher Baba]] in 1952. In November of that year he signed ''The Chartered Guidance from Meher Baba for the Reorientation of Sufism''. He appointed Ivy O. Duce as the first Murshida, or spiritual guide, of Sufism Reoriented.

Meher Baba designed Sufism Reoriented as a universal spiritual school which recognizes a central core of divine love at the heart of all spiritual systems. Meher Baba reorganized patterns of life and inner training associated with ancient Sufism and adapted them to the needs of spiritual students in contemporary America. He identified the central principles of Sufism Reoriented as love and service: active love for God and active service to others in God’s world.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau: "Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba", ''Manifestation, Inc.'' 1986. p. 1196&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Sufism]] was originally brought to the West by [[Inayat Khan|Hazrat Inayat Khan]] (1882–1927) in 1910. He appointed Rabia Martin as his successor and [[Murshid]]a of his Sufi Order. In the 1940s, Rabia Martin recognized Avatar Meher Baba as the reigning spiritual authority of the age and surrendered herself and her spiritual order to him. She appointed Ivy Oneita Duce as her successor as Murshida of the Sufi Order. In 1948 Murshida Duce was called to India by Meher Baba who confirmed her role as Murshida and announced that he intended to reorient Sufism under his guidance and her leadership in the near future. This was realized in 1952 with the creation of Sufism Reoriented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belovedarchives.org/printer_friendly/glow_art007_pf.html |title=Beloved Archives, Inc. |date=5 July 2008 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705092849/http://belovedarchives.org/printer_friendly/glow_art007_pf.html |archivedate= 5 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of Sufism Reoriented celebrate Meher Baba as the [[Avatar]], the human incarnation of God and the spiritual authority of this age.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belovedarchives.org/printer_friendly/glow_art008_pf.html |title=Beloved Archives, Inc. |date=5 July 2008 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705092545/http://belovedarchives.org/printer_friendly/glow_art008_pf.html |archivedate= 5 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents a substantial departure from Sufism in either its traditional Islamic form, or in the form taught by Hazrat Inayat Khan. Meher Baba asserted that Sufism pre-dates the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], having begun with the prophet [[Zoroaster]] of [[Iran|Persia]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Those drawn to Sufism Reoriented also recognize a natural affinity with the school’s spiritual teacher, who occupies the office of [[Murshid]]. The term ''Murshid'' or ''Murshida'' means Guide. It is used in traditional Sufism to refer to the spiritual figure who directs a Sufi school. Meher Baba, who described himself as the ''Murshid of Murshids'', first received Murshida Rabia Martin as His follower, and agreed to guide her and her Sufi group. However, Murshida Martin died before meeting Meher Baba physically.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau: "Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba", ''Manifestation, Inc.'' 1986. p. 3069&lt;/ref&gt; Before passing, Murshida Martin made Ivy Oneita Duce (1895–1981) her successor (the next Murshida) of the Sufi Order. In 1952 Meher Baba appointed her the first Murshida of Sufism Reoriented. Meher Baba confirmed this in India upon meeting Murshida Duce there. Before her death, Murshida Duce named Dr. James S. B. MacKie (1932–2001) as her successor. He, in turn, designated Carol Weyland Conner, the current Murshida, as his successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2017/07/12/sufism-reoriented-cheesecake-factory-california-sanctuary|title=The House Of Worship The Cheesecake Factory Built|work=The FADER|access-date=2017-12-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meher Baba Publications and Media ==
Sufism Reoriented is the copyright holder and publisher of several books by and about Meher Baba including Meher Baba's most important published book, ''[[God Speaks|God Speaks: the Theme of Creation and Its Purpose]]''. It also owns and publishes ''Beams from Meher Baba on the Spiritual Panorama'', ''Life At Its Best'', ''Glimpses of the God-Man Meher Baba. Volume I'', and ''How a Master Works'' by Ivy Oneita Duce.&lt;ref&gt;Avatar Meher Baba Perpetual Public Charitable Trust [http://www.ambppct.org/meherbaba/copyright/Copyrt.pdf AMBPPCT PDF file] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317205518/http://www.ambppct.org/meherbaba/copyright/Copyrt.pdf |date=2007-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition Sufism Reoriented owns and preserves numerous films and photographs of Baba. These include color 16mm films taken of Baba during his trip to the United States in 1956 by Charmian Duce Knowles, daughter of Murshida Ivy Oneita Duce.

==New Sanctuary==
After decades of operating out of temporary facilities, Sufism Reoriented began construction of a new, permanent sanctuary on May 24, 2012. The new sanctuary, designed by the architectural firm of Philip Johnson Alan Ritchie, was formally inaugurated on February 26, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXsL3Xtb7qA|title=Buz Connor Speaking at the Sufi Sanctuary Opening|last=Meher Legacy|first=|date=11 September 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sanctuary is located on three acres of land in the Saranap neighborhood of [[Walnut Creek, California|Walnut Creek]], about twenty-five miles east of [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sf.curbed.com/2017/7/13/15965852/sufism-reoriented-saranap-temple-east-bay|title=See the spectacular Sufi temple built with Cheesecake Factory money|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2016/05/06/contra-costa-sufism-center-to-open-soon-village-still-pending/|title=Contra Costa: Sufism center to open soon; ‘Village’ still pending|date=6 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JNHonRP5bE|title=Sufism Reoriented Sanctuary, Walnut Creek, CA|last=1OveraaConstruction|first=|date=17 March 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carol Weyland Conner, the current Murshida of Sufism Reoriented, has characterized the sanctuary as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;“In all spiritual traditions, the design of a sanctuary strives to be an outward expression, in material form, of the still, sacred space at the center of the human heart where man is joined with and can know God. It therefore aspires, first, to be the most beautiful form its creators can envision....My primary aim was to create a beautiful building that is an expression of our worship. The sanctuary’s curvilinear design is based on the form of the circle. Like God, the circle has no beginning and no end. This expresses eternity, the eternal life in God the Infinite. The circle is also recognized as a symbol of unity since all points on the circle are equidistant from the center, as all beings are in relation to God. This symbol embodies the essential unity of Creation and the Universal Love at the heart of all life.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2017/07/12/sufism-reoriented-cheesecake-factory-california-sanctuary|title=The House Of Worship The Cheesecake Factory Built|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sufismreoriented.org/sanctuary.html|title=Sufism Reoriented|website=www.sufismreoriented.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Theological virtues''' are [[virtue]]s associated in [[Christian theology]] and [[Christian philosophy|philosophy]] with [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] resulting from the [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] of [[God in Christianity|God]].&lt;ref name=Rziha/&gt;  Virtues are traits or qualities which dispose one to conduct oneself in a morally good manner. Traditionally they have been named [[Faith in Christianity|Faith]], [[Hope (virtue)|Hope]], and [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]], and can trace their importance in Christian theology to [[Paul the Apostle]] in [[1 Corinthians 13]], who also pointed out that charity is the most important.

The medieval Catholic philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] explained that these virtues are called theological virtues "because they have [[God]] for their object, both in so far as by them we are properly directed to Him, and because they are infused into our souls by God alone, as also, finally, because we come to know of them only by [[Divine revelation]] in the [[Sacred Scriptures]]".&lt;ref name=Delany/&gt;

==Moral theology ==
[[Image:VirtudesBraga.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The three Virtues in [[Bom Jesus do Monte|Bom Jesus]], [[Braga]] ]]

A person receives the theological virtues by their being "infused"—through [[Divine grace]]—into the person.&lt;ref name=CatholicEncyclopedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia: Virtue|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|date=1912|last=Waldron|first=M.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theological virtues are so named because their object is the divine being (theos).
* ''Faith'' is the infused virtue, by which the intellect, by a movement of the will, assents to the supernatural truths of Revelation, not on the motive of intrinsic evidence, but on the sole ground of the infallible authority of God revealing.&lt;ref name=CatholicEncyclopedia/&gt; According to [[Hugh Pope]] "[W]hat God says is supremely credible, though not necessarily supremely intelligible for us."&lt;ref name=Pope&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm Pope, Hugh. "Faith." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 6 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The [[First Vatican Council]] (III, iii;) stated that "faith is a supernatural virtue by which we with the inspiration and assistance of God's grace, believe those things to be true which He has revealed...although the assent of faith is in no sense blind, yet no one can assent to the Gospel teaching in the way necessary for salvation without the illumination of the Holy Spirit..."&lt;ref name=Pope/&gt; It is a gratuitous gift of God.
* ''Hope'' is defined as a Divinely infused virtue, acts upon the will, by which one trusts, with confidence grounded on the Divine assistance, to attain life everlasting.&lt;ref name=CatholicEncyclopedia/&gt; Its opposite is the sin of despair.&lt;ref name=Delany/&gt;
* ''Charity'' is a divinely infused virtue, inclining the human will to cherish God for his own sake above all things, and man for the sake of God. To love God is to wish Him all honour and glory and every good, and to endeavour, as far as one can, to obtain it for Him. John 14:23 notes a unique feature of reciprocity which makes charity a veritable friendship of man with God. "Whoever loves me will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm Sollier, Joseph. "Love (Theological Virtue)." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 6 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of love may give place to [[hatred]], [[wrath]] or indifference.

==1 Corinthians 13==
{{unreferenced-section|date=June 2018}}
The first mention in Christian literature of the three theological virtues is in [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul's]] first letter to the Thessalonians 1:3, "...calling to mind your work of faith and labor of love and endurance in hope..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P10P.HTM NAB, 1 Thessalonians 1, n.2]&lt;/ref&gt; He later refers to this triad of virtues again, "But since we are of the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love and the helmet that is hope for salvation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P10T.HTM NAB, 1 Thessalonians 5:8]&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
In [[1 Corinthians 13]], Paul places the greater emphasis on Charity (Love). "So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love." First, because it informs the other two: "It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things." Secondly, from a temporal perspective, love lasts, while "Hope isn't hope if its object is seen", and faith gives way to possession.

==Aquinas==
Aquinas found an interconnection of practical wisdom (''prudentia'') and moral virtue (e.g. courage without prudence risks becoming mere foolhardiness). This is frequently termed "the Unity of the Virtues."&lt;ref&gt;Annas, Julia. ''The Morality of Happiness'' (Oxford; Oxford University Press, 1993), pp. 73-84&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas stated that theological virtues are so called "because they have God for their object, both in so far as by them we are properly directed to Him, and because they are infused into our souls by God alone, as also, finally, because we come to know of them only by Divine revelation in the Sacred Scriptures".&lt;ref name=Delany&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07465b.htm Delany, Joseph. "Hope." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 6 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In his treatment of the virtues, [[Aquinas]] viewed the theological virtues as being the product of habitual grace. According to Aquinas, this grace, through the theological virtues, allows humanity to become agents in meritorious action that is beyond their own natural ability. In this way it is supernatural.&lt;ref name="Rziha"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rziha|first1=John Michael|title=Perfecting Human Actions: St. Thomas Aquinas on Human Participation in Eternal Law|date=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=9780813216720|pages=143–149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-CBFQw8hz8sC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas says "Faith has the character of a virtue, not because of the things it believes, for faith is of things that appear not, but because it adheres to the testimony of one in whom truth is infallibly found". (De Veritate, xiv, 8)&lt;ref name=Pope/&gt;

Aquinas further connected the theological virtues with the cardinal virtues. He views the supernatural inclinations of the theological virtues, caused by habitual grace, to find their fulfillment in being acted upon in the cardinal virtues.&lt;ref name=Rziha/&gt;

==Comparison of Cardinal and Theological Virtues==
The moral virtues are acquired by practice and habit. Catholic moral theology holds that the theological virtues differ from the [[cardinal virtues]] in that they cannot be obtained by human effort, but are infused by God into a person. Like the cardinal virtues, an individual who exercises these virtues strengthens and increases them, i.e., they are more disposed to practice them.&lt;ref name=Drefcinski/&gt;

Following [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], Aquinas also recognized a separate but related type of moral virtue which is also infused by God. The distinction lies both in their source and end. The moral virtue of temperance recognizes food as a good that sustains life, but guards against the sin of [[gluttony]]. The ''infused'' virtue of temperance disposes the individual to practice fasting and abstinence. The infused moral virtues are connected to the theological virtue of Charity.&lt;ref name=Drefcinski&gt;[http://people.uwplatt.edu/~drefcins/233AquinasVirtues.html Drefcinski, Shane. "A Very Short Primer on St. Thomas Aquinas’ Account of the Various Virtues", University of Wisconsin–Platteville]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Benedict XVI]] wrote three encyclicals about the theological virtues: ''[[Deus caritas est]]'' (about love), ''[[Spe salvi]]'' (about hope), and ''[[Lumen fidei]]'' (about faith: this encyclical was written both by Pope Benedict XVI and by [[Pope Francis]]).&lt;ref name="LS"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/the-vatican/detail/articolo/enciclica-papa-el-papa-pope-lumen-fidei-26222/ | title = The light of faith: origin, history and horizon of the christianism |newspaper = [[La Stampa]] | location = Turin | first = Alessandro | last = Speciale | date = 4 July 2013 | accessdate = 19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trần Đức Thảo''' ([[Từ Sơn]], [[Bắc Ninh]], 26 September 1917 – [[Paris]], 24 April 1993&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/world/tran-duc-thao-76-vietnamese-thinker.html Tran Duc Thao, 76, Vietnamese Thinker]. ''[[NY Times]]'', May 4, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] [[philosopher]]. His work (written primarily in French) attempted to unite [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] with [[Marxist philosophy]].  His work had some currency in France in the 1950s and 1960s, and was cited favorably by [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and [[Louis Althusser]].
==Life==
===Studies in France===
Trần Đức Thảo was born in [[Hanoi]], [[French Indochina]], he was educated there, completing his [[bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] at 17.  In 1936, he continued his studies in France, becoming a student of [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] where he wrote a dissertation for a [[diplôme d’études supérieures]] on [[Hegel]]. In 1943, he completed his [[agrégation]] with a thesis on the phenomenology of [[Edmund Husserl]], being received [[premier ex aequo]] alongside [[Jules Vuillemin]]. Through the 1940s, he worked on his first book, ''Phenomenology and Dialectical Materialism''.  The book argued that the defects of the phenomenological account of consciousness could only be remedied by the Marxist account of labor and society.  In the 1940s and 50s, Trần Đức Thảo’s ideas achieved some currency among the elite philosophical circles of France.  At the same time, he became an active anti-colonialist, publishing articles in [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and Merleau-Ponty’s journal ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'' about colonialism in Indochina; these articles were read by [[Frantz Fanon]] and other anticolonialists.  From October to December 1945, Trần Đức Thảo was jailed by the French government as a threat to its security.

===Return to Vietnam, 1951===
''Phenomenology and Dialectical Materialism'' was published in 1951, and in the same year he returned to [[North Vietnam|Vietnam]], working in support of the Communist Party.  In 1956, he was named the Dean of History in the country’s first national university.  

But he became critical of the Party over land reforms which had led to many deaths in 1956, and Trần Đức Thảo was caught up in the [[The Nhân Văn Affair|Nhan Van-Giai Pham affair]] in which the dissident intellectuals of the late 1950s were publicly criticized or punished.  Though Tran Duc Thao was never jailed, he fell out of favor with the ruling Party, publishing two self-criticisms in ''[[Nhân Dân]]'' and leaving his position of authority in 1958. None of his work was published in his home country from 1965 until 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Thu-Hương Nguyễn-Võ. ''The Ironies of Freedom: Sex, Culture, and Neoliberal Governance in Vietnam''. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2008.  &lt;br&gt;Page 69: "Prominent intellectuals in the university such as Paris-trained philosopher Trần Đức Thảo were later denounced for demanding the “expulsion of politics from the area of expertise” "&lt;/ref&gt;
===Work on ''Recherches sur l'origine du langage et de la conscience''===
For the next thirty years, his profile was lower, as he worked in the rural provinces translating philosophy into [[Vietnamese (language)|Vietnamese]] and preparing his book ''Investigations into the Origin of Language and Consciousness''.  This book, published in France in 1973, combined materialist biological and cognitive accounts of subjectivity and consciousness with the Marxist account he had elaborated earlier.  In the liberalized political climate of the 1980s, he was able to return to France for medical treatment, and there he met many of his old philosophical colleagues again, although he lived in poverty in an apartment at the Vietnamese embassy. He died in Paris in 1993 and was cremated at the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]].

'''''Verstehen''''' ({{IPA-de|fɛɐˈʃteːən}}, literally: "to understand"), in the context of German philosophy and [[social science]]s in general, has been used since the late 19th century – in English as in German – with the particular sense of the "interpretive or participatory" examination of social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/Theorists/Weber/Whome.htm |title=Verstehen: The Sociology of Max Weber |access-date=2011-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307133502/http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/Theorists/Weber/Whome.htm |archive-date=2011-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is closely associated with the work of the German [[sociologist]], [[Max Weber]], whose [[antipositivism]] established an alternative to prior [[sociological positivism]] and [[economic determinism]], rooted in the analysis of [[social action]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/anti_positivism.htm "Anti-positivism"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403001519/http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/anti_positivism.htm |date=April 3, 2012 }} at Historylearningsite.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; In [[anthropology]], ''Verstehen'' has come to mean a systematic interpretive process in which an outside observer of a culture attempts to relate to it and understand others. 

''Verstehen'' is now seen as a concept and a method central to a rejection of positivistic social science (although Weber appeared to think that the two could be united). ''Verstehen'' refers to understanding the [[Meaning-making|meaning]] of action from the actor's point of view. It is entering into the shoes of the other, and adopting this research stance requires treating the actor as a subject, rather than an object of your observations. It also implies that unlike objects in the natural world human actors are not simply the product of the pulls and pushes of external forces. Individuals are seen to create the world by organizing their own understanding of it and giving it meaning. To do research on actors without taking into account the meanings they attribute to their actions or environment is to treat them like objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitbucket.icaap.org/dict.pl?term=VERSTEHEN "Verstehen"]: entry in the ''Online Dictionary of the Social Sciences''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning&lt;!--'Interpretative sociology', 'Interpretative sociology' and 'Verstehende Soziologie' redirect here--&gt;==
'''Interpretative sociology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (''verstehende Soziologie'') is the study of society that concentrates on the meanings people associate to their social world.&lt;ref name="Sociology"&gt;Macionis, J., and Gerber, L. (2010). Sociology, 7th edition&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretative sociology strives to show that reality is constructed by people themselves in their daily lives.&lt;ref name="Sociology" /&gt;

''Verstehen'' roughly translates to "meaningful understanding" or "putting yourself in the shoes of others to see things from their perspective". Interpretive sociology differs from positivist sociology in three ways:
#Interpretive sociology deals with the meaning attached to behavior, unlike positivist sociology which focuses on action. 
#Interpretive sociology sees reality as being constructed by people, unlike positivist sociology which sees an objective reality "out there". 
#Interpretive sociology relies on qualitative data, unlike positivist sociology which tends to make use of quantitative data.&lt;ref name="Sociology" /&gt;

==Dilthey and hermeneutics==
''Verstehen'' was introduced into philosophy and the [[human science]]s (''[[Geisteswissenschaften]]'') by the German [[Historism|historist]] philosopher [[Johann Gustav Droysen]]. He first made a distinction between nature and history in terms of the categories of space and time. The method of the [[natural sciences]] (''Naturwissenschaften'') is explanation (''[[wikt:erklären|erklären]]&lt;!--German verb--&gt;''), while that of history is understanding (''verstehen&lt;!--German verb--&gt;'').&lt;ref&gt;J. Gustav Droyen, ''Historik: Vorlesungen über Enzyklopädie und Methodologie der Geschichte''. Stuttgart: Fromann-Holzboog, [1858] 1977: 22, 150f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Gustav Droyen, ''Grundriss der Historik'', Berlin 1862, p. 4 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Gustav Droysen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7_lrAAAAIAAJ&amp;hl= ''Grundriss der Historik''], Verlag von Veit &amp; Comp., 1868, p. 11: §14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lars Udehn, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lu4rCkENQvcC&amp;dq= ''Methodological Individualism: Background, History and Meaning''], Routledge, 2001, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''Verstehen'' was later used by the German philosopher [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]&lt;ref&gt;W. Dilthey, ''Ideen über eine beschreibende und zergliedernde Psychologie'', Berlin 1894, p. 1314.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Dilthey, ''Introduction to the Human Sciences''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the first-person participatory perspective that agents have on their individual experience as well as their culture, history, and society. In this sense, it is developed in the context of the theory and practice of ''interpretation'' (as understood in the context of [[hermeneutics]]) and contrasted with the external objectivating third-person perspective of ''explanation'' (''das Erklären'') in which human agency, subjectivity, and its products are analyzed as effects of impersonal natural forces in the natural sciences and social structures in sociology.

Twentieth-century philosophers such as [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Georg Gadamer, ''[[Truth and method]]'', Crossroad, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; have been critical of what they considered to be the romantic and subjective character of ''Verstehen'' in Dilthey, although both Dilthey and the early Heidegger were interested in the "[[facticity]]" and "life-context" of understanding, and sought to universalize it as the way humans exist through language on the basis of [[ontology]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bcOjTiSNFZoC&amp;dq= ''Ontology: The Hermeneutics of Facticity''], Indiana University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles R. Bambach, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xaWALY0raiEC&amp;dq= ''Heidegger, Dilthey, and the crisis of historicism''], Cornell University Press, 1995, p. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Verstehen'' also played a role in [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Alfred Schutz]]'s analysis of the "[[lifeworld]]." [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Karl-Otto Apel]] further transformed the concept of ''Verstehen'', reformulating it on the basis of a transcendental-pragmatic philosophy of language and the theory of communicative action.

==Weber and the social sciences==
[[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]]&lt;ref&gt;Georg Simmel, ''Die probleme der Gechichtsphilosophie. Eine erkentnistheoretische Studie''. Munich: Verlag von Dunker und Humboldt, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced interpretive understanding (''Verstehen'') into [[sociology]], where it has come to mean a systematic interpretive process in which an outside observer of a culture (such as an [[anthropologist]] or [[sociologist]]) relates to an indigenous people or sub-cultural group on their own terms and from their own point of view, rather than interpreting them in terms of his or her own culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macionis, Gerber|first=John, Linda|title=Sociology|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc|location=Toronto, ON|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Verstehen'' can mean either a kind of [[Empathy|empathic]] or participatory understanding of social phenomena. In anthropological terms this is sometimes described as [[cultural relativism]], especially by those that have a tendency to argue toward universal ideals. In sociology it is an aspect of the comparative-historical approach, where the context of a society like twelfth century "France" can be potentially better understood (''Besserverstehen'') by the sociologist than it could have been by people living in a village in Burgundy. It relates to how people in life give meaning to the social world around them and how the [[social scientist]] accesses and evaluates this "first-person perspective". This concept has been both expanded and criticized by later social scientists. Proponents laud this concept as the only means by which researchers from one culture can examine and explain behaviors in another. While the exercise of ''Verstehen'' has been more popular among social scientists in [[Europe]], such as Habermas, ''Verstehen'' was introduced into the practice of [[sociology]] in the [[United States]] by [[Talcott Parsons]], an American follower of [[Max Weber]]. Parsons used his [[structural functionalism]] to incorporate this concept into his 1937 work, ''The Structure of Social Action''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerber|first=John J. Macionis, Linda M.|title=Sociology|publisher=Pearson Canada|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|edition=7th Canadian|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber had more specific beliefs than Marx where he put value to understanding and meaning of key elements—not just with intuition or sympathy with the individual but also the product of "systematic and rigorous research". The goal is to identify human actions and interpreting them as observable events leading us to believe that it not only provides for a good explanation for individual actions but also for group interactions. The meaning attached needs to include constraints and limitations and analyze the motivation for action. Weber believed that this gives the sociologist an advantage over a natural scientist because "We can accomplish something which is never attainable in the natural sciences, namely the subjective understanding of the action of the component individuals" (Weber, Economy and Society, p.&amp;nbsp;15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gingrich|first=Paul|title=Max Weber|url=http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/s30f99.htm|work=Sociology 250|publisher=University of Regina, Department of Sociology and Social Studies|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of the social scientific concept of ''Verstehen'' such as [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] and [[Dean MacCannell]] counter that it is simply impossible for a person born of one culture to ever completely understand another culture, and that it is arrogant and conceited to attempt to interpret the significance of one culture's [[symbol]]s through the terms of another (supposedly superior) culture.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Such criticisms do not necessarily allow for the possibility that ''Verstehen'' does not involve "complete" understanding.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Just as in physical science all knowledge is asymptotic to the full explanation, a high degree of cross-cultural understanding is very valuable. The opposite of ''Verstehen'' would seem to be ignorance of all but that which is immediately observable, meaning that we would not be able to understand any time and place but our own. A certain level of interpretive understanding is necessary for our own cultural setting, however, and it can easily be argued that even the full participant in a culture does not fully understand it in every regard.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Critics also believe that it is the sociologist's job to not just observe people and what people do but also share in their world of meaning and come to appreciate why they act as they do. Subjective thoughts and feelings regarded as bias in the sciences is an important aspect to be controlled for while doing sociological research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macionis, Gerber|first=John, Linda|title=Sociology|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|location=Toronto, ON|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zen Center of Syracuse''' (or, '''Syracuse Zen Center'''), temple name '''Hoen-ji''', is a [[Rinzai]] [[Zen Buddhist]] practice center in [[Syracuse, New York]], one of the oldest continuously running Zen centers in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt; Founded in 1972, the center is currently led by [[Shinge Roko Sherry Chayat Roshi]] .&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;Wilson, 169&lt;/ref&gt; Originally at 111 Concord Place, the meditation hall is now located in the former [[carriage house]] behind the one-time home of [[Joshua Forman]] (the first mayor of Syracuse) and offers Zen practice for [[Laity|laypeople]].&lt;ref name="keenan"&gt;Keenan, 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gadoua&lt;/ref&gt; Several clergy and practitioners live in a house next door and in the Joshua Forman house, where programs are also conducted. The Zen Center of Syracuse began as a group of [[graduate student]]s from [[Syracuse University]], with Chayat eventually becoming the center's leader.&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;Ford, 118&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Zen practice, the center also provides some instruction in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. According to ''The Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America'', "The Syracuse Zen Center also leads meditation at Syracuse University, Syracuse area schools, recovery and justice system institutions, hospitals and corporations."&lt;ref&gt;Skinner Keller, 642-643&lt;/ref&gt; The center also won two awards for their restoration of The Forman House from the Preservation Association of [[Central New York]] . This house was instrumental during the [[War of 1812]] and the [[American Civil War]], for it was a bandage assembly area for wounded troops.&lt;ref&gt;Forman &amp; Zen&lt;/ref&gt;
