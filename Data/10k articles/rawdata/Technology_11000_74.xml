'''ASPIDER''' is the group name for a series of companies that are mostly based in Europe. The company name has evolved over the years as a result of acquisitions, mergers and restructuring. The company is an [[Mobile virtual network enabler|MVNE]] (Mobile Virtual Network Enabler), providing mobile services to companies that want to control their own network. Clients include enterprises, manufacturers, integrators, and the mobile operators themselves.

== History ==
Following the merger of ASPIDER and MEC Solutions in 2004, the company traded as ASPIDER Solutions. Following the acquisition of NGI in 2014 the company traded as ASPIDER-NGI. ASPIDER sold aspects of its M2M business in 2010 to Wyless&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wyless-announces-agreement-to-acquire-aspider-m2m-245926381.html|title=Wyless Announces Agreement to Acquire ASPIDER M2M|last=M2M|first=Wyless and ASPIDER|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which was subsequently purchased by [[KORE Wireless|Kore Wireless]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.korewireless.com/press-release/kore-to-acquire-wyless-group-holdings|title=KORE to Acquire Wyless Group Holdings|last=Miglietta|first=Norman|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

ASPIDER is traditionally known as a Mobile Virtual Network Enabler ([[Mobile virtual network enabler|MVNE]]), delivering services to a variety of operators and MVNOs and MNOs (Postmobile&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thefastmode.com/technology-solutions/5875-aspider-ngi-supports-irelands-an-post-to-relaunch-mvno-service|title=ASPIDER-NGI supports Ireland's An Post to Relaunch MVNO Service|last=Sharma|first=Ray|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Vodafone&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2007-10-13/business-news/Vodafone-To-launch-multiple-MVNOs-in-partnership-with-Aspider-Solutions-198201|title=Vodafone To launch multiple MVNOs in partnership with Aspider Solutions - The Malta Independent|website=www.independent.com.mt|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and T-Mobile). More recently the company has been delivering services to Enterprises, Manufacturers and other MVNEs ([[SURFnet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.surf.nl/en/news/2017/05/research-into-e-sim-security-related-applications-in-a-poc-with-aspider-ngi.html|title=Research into E-SIM security-related applications with ASPIDER-NGI|last=SURFnet|website=www.surf.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Kore Wireless). In the past couple of years, ASPIDER has been promoting [[eSIM]] and [[Remote SIM provisioning|Remote SIM Provisioning]]- the embedded SIM standard by [[GSMA]] and has announced partnerships with various industry players for the use of eSIM in IoT initiatives (IDEMIA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iotjournal.com/articles/view?16692|title=ASPIDER-NGI Launches IoT Solution for Global Connectivity - IOT Journal|last=Journal|first=IOT|website=www.iotjournal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Oracle&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressrelease/oracle-communications-ncc-022218.html|title=Oracle Communications Network Charging and Control Enables Mobile Service Providers to Differentiate and Monetize Their Brand|website=www.oracle.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

ASPIDER's promotion of eSIM&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsma.com/esim/|title=The SIM for the next Generation of Connected Consumer Devices - eSIM|website=eSIM|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; is notable because, when the initial specifications were announced, they were limited mainly to use-cases around operator selection and [[Remote SIM provisioning]]. ASPIDER has been promoting additional use cases more for enterprise applications - like authentication and identity management. The company has been working with industry groups like BTG&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.btg.org/2016/07/14/btg-sluit-partnership-aspider-ngi/|title=BTG sluit partnership met ASPIDER-NGI – BTG|date=2016-07-14|work=BTG|access-date=2018-03-01|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt; to get pilots off the ground with companies like SURFnet.

== Operations ==
ASPIDER operates from a number of datacenters around the world and the largest of these is based in Malta. The Maltese operation includes a full core network that is interconnected to a number of operators, in particular with [[Vodafone Malta]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in order to launch a number of MVNOs in Malta.

'''Adolf Daimler''' (8 September 1871 – 24 March 1913)&lt;ref name=DB&gt;{{cite web | title=Daimler, Adolf | website=Deutsche Biographie | url=https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/pnd135728673.html | language=de | access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the son of German inventor and industrialist [[Gottlieb Daimler]]. A mechanical engineer by training, Adolf became managing director and co-owner of his father's firm [[Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft]] in 1900. Along with his brother [[Paul Daimler]], Adolf is credited with developing the distinctive [[Mercedes (marque)|Mercedes]] 3-pointed star logo.&lt;ref name = daimler&gt;{{cite web | author=Daimler | title=The Mercedes star is born | website=Daimler AG | date=2018 | location=Stuttgart, Germany | language = en | url=https://www.daimler.com/company/tradition/mercedes-benz/birth.html | access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Adolf Daimler was born on September 8, 1871, in [[Karlsruhe]], then the capital of the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]]. He was the second son of Gottlieb Daimler and spent his childhood in [[Cologne]] when his father served as technical director at the [[Deutz AG]] gas engine factory. In 1882, the family moved to [[Bad Cannstatt]], one of the outer city districts of [[Stuttgart]], then the capital of the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]]. Adolf attended the nearby Royal Institute of Stuttgart ({{lang-de|Königliche Realanstalt zu Stuttgart}}), where he graduated in 1891. After an apprenticeship at the [[Maschinenfabrik Esslingen]] company, he studied mechanical engineering at the [[University of Stuttgart]] from 1895 to 1898. During this time he married Marie Schuler.

In 1899 Adolf joined his father's company, [[Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft]] (DMG), which had been founded in 1890. There he helped develop the [[Mercedes (marque)|Mercedes]] brand. He and his brother [[Paul Daimler]] adapted a three-pointed star to represent the company and trademarked it in 1900. Their father had once used such a symbol to mark the family's house on a postcard depicting a view of the town of Deutz.&lt;ref name = daimler/&gt; Adolf became chief engineer in 1900 and deputy board member in 1904. In 1907, he was appointed [[Chief Operating Officer]] and appointed to the [[Board of Directors]]. After a long illness, Adolf died on March 24, 1913 in the university town of [[Tübingen]]. His funeral was held on March 26, 1913 at Uff Cemetery in Bad Cannstatt, where his father had already been laid to rest a few years earlier. His funeral was attended by a number of industrialist dignitaries, including [[Robert Bosch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper | newspaper=[[Stuttgarter Nachrichten]] | title= Zum 50.

The '''American Society for Engineering Education''' ('''ASEE''') is a [[non-profit]] member association, founded in 1893, dedicated to promoting and improving [[engineering]] and [[engineering technology]] education. The purpose of ASEE is the advancement of education in all of its functions which pertain to engineering and allied branches of science and technology, including the processes of teaching and learning, counseling, research, extension services and public relations.

==History==
A full reading of the history of ASEE can be found in a 1993 centennial article in the Journal of Engineering Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jee.org/1993/july/511.pdf "Striving for Balance: A Hundred Years of the American Society for Engineering Education."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded initially as the '''Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education''' (SPEE) in 1893, the society was created at a time of great growth in American higher education. In 1862, Congress passed the [[Morrill Land-Grant Act]], which provided money for states to establish public institutions of higher education. These institutions focused on providing practical skills, especially "for the benefit of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts". As a result of increasingly available higher education, more Americans started entering the workforce with advanced training in applied fields of knowledge. However, they often lacked grounding in the science and engineering principles underlying this practical knowledge.

After a generation of students had passed through these new public universities, professors of engineering began to question whether they should adopt a more rigorous approach to teaching the fundamentals of their field. Ultimately, they concluded that engineering curricula should stress fundamental scientific and mathematical principles, not hands-on apprenticeship experiences. To organize support for this approach to engineering education, SPEE was formed in the midst of the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair. Known as the [[World's Columbian Exposition]], this event heralded the promise of science and engineering by introducing many Americans, for example, to the wonders of electricity. Emerging out of the Fair’s World Engineering Congress, SPEE members dedicated themselves to improving engineering education at the classroom level. Over its history, the society has put out several reports on the subject, such as the Mann Report (1907), the [[William E. Wickenden|Wickenden]] Study (1920s), and the Grinter Report (1955).{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

During [[World War II]], the federal government started to place more emphasis on research, prompting SPEE to form the Engineering College Research Association (ECRA), which was more concerned with research than SPEE had ever been. The ECRA spoke for most engineering researchers, sought federal funds, and collected and published information on academic engineering research. After the war, the desire to integrate the less research-oriented SPEE with the ECRA resulted in the disbanding of SPEE and the formation of ASEE in 1946.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

ASEE was a volunteer-run organization through the 1950s. In 1961, ASEE established a staff headquarters in [[Washington, DC]], and undertook a more activist posture. However, through the 1960s, the [[Vietnam War]] and social unrest in general made the mood on many campuses anti-technology, anti-business, and anti-establishment. In the 1960s and 1970s, ASEE presidents Merritt Williams and George Hawkins reorganized ASEE to better represent its members and return its focus to teaching. As a result of this new focus, ASEE began to administer several teaching-related government contracts, including NASA's summer faculty fellowships and the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]]'s Civil Defense Summer Institutes and Fellowships. Currently, ASEE administers over ten government contracts, including the prestigious [[National Science Foundation]]'s Graduate Research Fellowship Program.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Another result of the renewed emphasis on teaching was ASEE’s initiative for recruiting minorities and women into engineering. ASEE created the Black Engineering College Development program which used industry funding to upgrade engineering faculty in traditionally black colleges and to develop public information on these schools. ASEE also received several grants in the 1970s to research the status of women and American Indians and develop programs to attract more of these students to enter engineering. Since then, ASEE has continued to release studies on the subject in its Journal of Engineering Education, and has created divisions specifically devoted to developing programs and research in this area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asee.org/member-resources/groups/divisions#Minorities ASEE Divisions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various methods of transporting children have been used in different cultures and times. These methods include baby carriages (prams in British English), [[Child safety seat|infant car seats]], portable [[bassinet]]s (carrycots), strollers (pushchairs), slings, backpacks, baskets and bicycle carriers.

The large, heavy prams (short for perambulator), which had become popular during the [[Victorian era]], were replaced by lighter designs during the latter half of the 1900s.

==Baskets, slings and backpacks==

[[Image:Ergobabycarrier.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A backpack carrier]]
Infant carrying likely emerged early in human evolution as the emergence of bipedalism would have necessitated some means of carrying babies who could no longer cling to their mothers and/or simply sit on top of their mother's back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wall-Scheffler|first1=C.M.|last2=Geiger|first2=K.|last3=Steudel-Numbers|first3=K.|title=Infant carrying: The role of increased locomotory costs in early development|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date=2007|volume=133|issue=2|pages=841–846|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20603|pmid=17427923}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On-the-body carriers are designed in various forms such as [[baby sling]], backpack carriers, and soft front or hip carriers, with varying materials and degrees of rigidity, decoration, support and confinement of the child. Slings, soft front carriers, and "baby carriages" are typically used for infants who lack the ability to sit or to hold their head up. Frame backpack carriers (a modification of the frame [[backpack]]), hip carriers, slings, ''mei tai''s and a variety of other soft carriers are used for older children.

Images of children being carried in slings can be seen in Egyptian artwork dating back to the time of the [[Pharaoh]]s,&lt;ref&gt;I.C. van Hout. Beloved Burden - Baby wearing around the world. pp 6-7. Royal Tropical Institute, Amsterdam. 2011. {{ISBN|9789068321746}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been used in many indigenous cultures. One of the earliest European artworks showing baby wearing is a [[fresco]] by [[Giotto]] painted in around 1306 AD, which depicts [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] carrying [[Jesus]] in a sling.&lt;ref&gt;Rosie Knowles. Why Babywearing Matters. p 19. Pinter &amp; Martin, 2016. {{ISBN|9781780665351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baby wearing in a sling was well known in Europe in medieval times, but was mainly seen as a practice of marginalised groups such as [[begging|beggers]] and [[Romani people|gypsies]].&lt;ref&gt;I.C. van Hout. Beloved Burden - Baby wearing around the world. pp 58-63. Royal Tropical Institute, Amsterdam. 2011. {{ISBN|9789068321746}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cradleboard]] is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] baby carrier used to keep babies secure and comfortable and at the same time allowing the mothers freedom to work and travel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/RefMedia.aspx?refid=701508395&amp;artrefid=761570777&amp;sec=-1&amp;pn=1 Cradleboard] Encarta.

For travel, cradleboards could be hung on a saddle or [[travois]]. Ethnographic tradition indicates that it was common practice to cradleboard newborn children until they were able to walk,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&amp;dat=20011026&amp;id=UhAiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zXIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4394,6132341&amp;hl=en], Native American Cradles exhibited at Pequot Museum, The Day - October 6, 2001, Retrieved 4 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; although many mothers continued to [[swaddling|swaddle]] their children well past the first birthday. Bound and wrapped on a cradleboard, a baby can feel safe and secure. Soft materials such as lichens, moss and shredded bark were used for cushioning and diapers. Cradleboards were either cut from flat pieces of wood or woven from flexible twigs like willow and hazel, and cushioned with soft, absorbent materials. The design of most cradleboards is a flat surface with the child wrapped tightly to it. It is usually only able to move its head.

On-the-body baby carrying started being known in western countries in the 1960s, with the advent of the structured soft pack in the mid-1960s. Around the same time, the frame backpack quickly became a popular way to carry older babies and toddlers. In the early 1970s, the wrap was reintroduced in Germany. The two ringed sling was invented by Rayner and Fonda Garner in 1981 and popularized by [[William Sears (physician)|Dr William Sears]] starting in around 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Blois MD. Babywearing - The Benefits and Beauty of This Ancient Tradition. pp 32-35. Hale Publishing, 2005. {{ISBN|0972958339}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, the modern pouch carrier was created in Hawaii. While the Chinese ''mei tai'' has been around in one form or another for centuries, it did not become popular in the west until it was modernized with padding and other adjustments. It first became popular and well known in mid-2003.

Portable cradles, including cradleboards, baskets, and [[bassinet]]s, have been used by many cultures to carry young infants.

==Modern transport methods==
Wheeled devices are generally divided into prams, used for newborn babies in which the infant normally lies down facing the pusher, and the strollers, which are used for the small child up to about three years old in a sitting position facing forward.

===History===
[[William Kent]] developed an early stroller in 1733.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |title=On foot: a history of walking - Google Book Search |publisher=books.google.co.uk |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-gUk_wmrciMC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=William+Kent+baby+carriage |accessdate=2009-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1733, the [[William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]] asked Kent to build a means of transport that would carry his children. Kent obliged by constructing a shell shaped basket on wheels that the children could sit in. This was richly decorated and meant to be pulled by a goat or small pony. Benjamin Potter Crandall sold baby carriages in the US in the 1830s which have been described as the "first baby carriages manufactured in the US"&lt;ref&gt;.[https://web.archive.org/web/20130329063813/http://www.moah.org/exhibits/archives/toysnmore/toys.html Museum of American Heritage], retrieved 6 Sep 2010&lt;/ref&gt;   However, it has been argued that [[F.A. Whitney Carriage Company]] was the first.  His son, [[Jesse Armour Crandall]] was issued a number of patents for improvements and additions to the standard models. These included adding a brake to carriages, a model which folded, designs for parasols and an umbrella hanger. By 1840, the baby carriage became extremely popular. [[Queen Victoria]] bought three carriages from Hitchings Baby Store.

The carriages of those days were built of wood or [[wicker]] and held together by expensive brass joints. These sometimes became heavily ornamented works of art. Models were also named after royalty, Princess and Duchess being popular names, as well as Balmoral and Windsor.

In June 1889, William H. Richardson patented his idea of the first reversible stroller. The [[bassinet]] was designed so it could face out or in towards the parent. He also made structural changes to the carriage. Until then the axis did not allow each wheel to move separately, Richardson’s design allowed this, which increased maneuverability of the carriages. As the 1920s began, prams were now available to all families and were becoming safer, with larger wheels, brakes, deeper prams, and lower, sturdier frames.

In 1965, [[Owen Maclaren]], an aeronautical engineer, worked on complaints his daughter made about travelling from England to America with her heavy pram. Using his knowledge of aeroplanes, Maclaren designed a stroller with an aluminium frame and created the first true umbrella stroller. He then went on to found [[Maclaren]], which manufactured and sold his new design. The design took off and soon “strollers” were easier to transport and used everywhere.

In the 1970s, however, the trend was more towards a more basic version, not fully sprung, and with a detachable body known as a "carrycot".&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The modern equivalent&amp;mdash;for babies that cannot walk&amp;mdash;is a pram with a body that can be detached for carrying or for attaching to a frame to become a car seat (a "travel system").&lt;/ref&gt; Now, prams are very rarely used, being large and expensive when compared with "buggies" (see below). One of the longer lived and better known brands in the UK is [[Silver Cross (pram)|Silver Cross]], first manufactured in [[Hunslet]], [[Leeds]], in 1877, and later [[Guiseley]] from 1936 until 2002 when the factory closed. Silver Cross was then bought by the toy company David Halsall and Sons who relocated the head office to Skipton and expanded into a range of new, modern baby products including pushchairs and "travel systems". They continue to sell the traditional Silver Cross coach prams which are manufactured at a factory in Bingley in Yorkshire.

Since the 1980s, the stroller industry has developed with new features, safer construction and more accessories.

===Prams===
[[Image:Doris Turnbull in a pram, Nowgong, Assam 1902.jpg|thumb|A pram in [[Assam]], [[India]], about 1902]]

Larger and heavier prams, or perambulators had been used since their introduction in the [[Victorian era]]; prams were also used for infants, often sitting up. The term carrycot became more common in the UK after the introduction of lighter units with detachable baby carriers in the 1970s.

As they developed through the years [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] was added, making the ride smoother for both the baby and the person pushing it.

===Strollers===
[[File:Mor og datter i Gamla Stan i Stockholm.JPG|thumb|upright|A child being pushed in a stroller]]
[[File:Modernbuggy-tokyoarea-japan-stationplatform-april15-2016.webm|thumb|(video) Two women pushing buggies on a train platform in [[Tokyo]], 2016]]
'Strollers' (North American English) or 'push chairs/buggies' (English), are used for small children up to about three years old in a sitting position facing forward.

"Pushchair" was the popularly used term in the UK between its invention and the early 1980s, when a more compact design known as a "buggy" became the trend, popularised by the conveniently collapsible aluminium framed [[Maclaren]] buggy designed and patented by the British aeronautical designer [[Owen Maclaren]] in 1965. "Pushchair" is the usual term in the UK, but is becoming increasingly replaced by buggy; in American English, buggy is synonymous with baby carriage. Newer versions can be configured to carry a baby lying down like a low pram and then be reconfigured to carry the child in the forward-facing position.

A variety of twin pushchairs are manufactured, some designed for babies of a similar age (such as [[twin]]s) and some for those with a small age gap. Triple pushchairs are a fairly recent addition, due to the number of [[multiple birth]]s being on the increase. Safety guidelines for standard pushchairs apply. Most triple buggies have a weight limit of 50&amp;nbsp;kg and recommended use for children up to the age of 4 years.

A travel system is typically a set consisting of a chassis with a detachable baby seat and/or carrycot. Thus a travel system can be switched between a pushchair and a pram. Another benefit of a travel system is that the detached chassis (generally an umbrella closing chassis) when folded will usually be smaller than other types, to transport it in a [[trunk (automobile)|car trunk or boot]]. Also, the baby seat will snap into a base meant to stay in an automobile, becoming a car seat. This allows undisturbed movement of the baby into or out of a car and a reduced chance of waking a sleeping baby.

Another modern design showcases a stroller that includes the possibility for the lower body to be elongated, thereby transforming the stroller into a [[kick scooter]]. Steering occurs by leaning towards either side. Depending on the model, it can be equipped with a foot- and/or handbrake. Speeds up to 10&amp;nbsp;mph can be reached. The first stroller of this kind was the so-called “Roller Buggy”, developed by industrial designer Valentin Vodev in 2005. In 2012 the manufacturer Quinny became interested in the concept and teamed up with a Belgian studio to design another model.

The modern [[infant car seat]] is a relative latecomer. It is used to carry a child within a car. Such car seats are required by law in many countries to safely transport young children.

==Others==
Bicycles can be fitted with a [[bicycle trailer]] or a [[children's bicycle seat]] to carry small children.  An older child can ride on a one-wheel [[trailer bike]] with an integrated seat and handle bars.

A "travel system" includes a car seat base, an infant car seat, and a baby stroller. The car seat base is installed in a car. The infant car seat snaps into the car seat base when traveling with a baby. From the car, the infant car seat can be hand carried and snapped onto the stroller.

minor grant.&lt;ref name="frontierschapter3"/&gt;
At the end of the project, conclusions into fourteen topics, including these funded projects, were summarized by program manager Marc G. Millis.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt; Of these, six research avenues were found to be nonviable, four were identified as opportunities for continued research, and four remain unresolved.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="millis20042"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Millis|first1=Mark G.|date=2004|title=Prospects for Breakthrough Propulsion From Physics|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20040070788.pdf|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-viable approaches==
One in-house experiment tested the Schlicher thruster antenna, claimed by Schlicher&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schlicher|first1=R|last2=Biggs|first2=A|last3=Tedeschi|first3=W|title=Mechanical propulsion from unsymmetrical magnetic induction fields|journal=31st Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit|page=2643|doi=10.2514/6.1995-2643|url=https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.1995-2643|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; to generate thrust.  No thrust was observed.&lt;ref name="frontierschapter3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fralick|first1=Gustave|last2=Niedra|first2=Janis|title=Experimental results of Schlicher's thrusting antenna|journal=37th Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit|date=Nov 1, 2001|doi=10.2514/6.2001-3657|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20020009088.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another experiment examined a gravity shielding mechanism claimed by Podkletnov and Nieminen.&lt;ref name="frontierschapter3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Podkletnov|first1=E.|last2=Nieminen|first2=R.|title=A possibility of gravitational force shielding by bulk YBa2Cu3O7−x superconductor|journal=Physica C: Superconductivity|date=December 1992|volume=203|issue=3–4|pages=441–444|doi=10.1016/0921-4534(92)90055-H|bibcode=1992PhyC..203..441P}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experimental investigation on the BPPP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robertson|first1=Tony|last2=Lichford|first2=Ron|last3=Peters|first3=Randall|last4=Thompson|first4=Byran|last5=Rogers|first5=Stephen L.|title=Exploration of Anomalous Gravity Effects by rf-Pumped Magnetized High-T(c) Superconducting Oxides|journal=AIAA Joint Propulsion Conference; 8-11 Jul. 2001; Salt Lake City, UT; United States|date=Jan 1, 2001|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20020016600.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other experiments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hathaway|first1=G|last2=Cleveland|first2=B|last3=Bao|first3=Y|title=Gravity modification experiment using a rotating superconducting disk and radio frequency fields|journal=Physica C: Superconductivity|date=April 2003|volume=385|issue=4|pages=488–500|doi=10.1016/S0921-4534(02)02284-0|bibcode=2003PhyC..385..488H}}&lt;/ref&gt; found no evidence of the effect.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt;

Research on quantum tunneling was sponsored by the BPPP.  It was concluded that this is not a mechanism for faster-than-light travel.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="frontierschapter3" /&gt;

Other approaches categorized as non-viable are oscillation thrusters and gyroscopic antigravity, Hooper antigravity coils, and coronal blowers.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt;

==Unresolved approaches==
A theoretical examination of additional atomic [[energy levels]] (deep Dirac levels) was carried out.  Some states were ruled out, but the problem remains unsolved.&lt;ref name="frontierschapter3" /&gt;

Experiments tested [[James F. Woodward|Woodward]]’s [[Woodward effect|theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woodward|first1=James F.|title=A new experimental approach to Mach's principle and relativistic graviation|journal=Foundations of Physics Letters|date=October 1990|volume=3|issue=5|pages=497–506|doi=10.1007/BF00665932|bibcode=1990FoPhL...3..497W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woodward|first1=James F.|title=Measurements of a Machian transient mass fluctuation|journal=Foundations of Physics Letters|date=October 1991|volume=4|issue=5|pages=407–423|doi=10.1007/BF00691187|bibcode=1991FoPhL...4..407W}}&lt;/ref&gt; of inducing transient inertia by electromagnetic fields.  The small effect could not be confirmed.  Woodward continued refining the experiments and theory.  Independent experiments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cramer|first1=John|last2=Cassisi|first2=Damon|last3=Fey|first3=Curran|title=Tests of Mach's Principle with a mechanical oscillator|journal=37th Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit|date=Oct 1, 2004|doi=10.2514/6.2001-3908|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050080680.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; also remained inconclusive.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="frontierschapter3" /&gt;

A possible torsion-like effect in the coupling between electromagnetism and spacetime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ringermacher|first1=Harry I.|title=An electrodynamic connection|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=1994|volume=11|issue=9|pages=2383|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/11/9/018|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/11/9/018/meta|language=en|issn=0264-9381|bibcode=1994CQGra..11.2383R}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may ultimately be useful for propulsion, was sought in experiments. The experiments were insufficient to resolve the question.&lt;ref name="frontierschapter3" /&gt;

Other theories listed in Millis' final assessment as unresolved are [[Abraham-Minkowski controversy|Abraham–Minkowski]] electromagnetic momentum, interpreting inertia and gravity quantum vacuum effects, and the Podkletnov force beam.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt;

== Space drives ==
One of the eight tasks funded by the BPP program was to define a strategy towards space drives.&lt;ref name="frontierschapter3" /&gt;  

As a motivation, seven examples of hypothetical space drives were described at the onset of the project.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt;  These included the gravity-based pitch drive, bias drive, disjunction drive and diametric drive; the [[Alcubierre drive]]; and the vacuum energy based differential sail.&lt;ref name="millis1997" /&gt;

The project then considered the mechanisms behind these drives.  At the end of the project, three mechanisms were identified as areas for future research.  One considers the possibility of a reaction mass in seemingly empty space, for example in [[dark matter]], [[dark energy]], or [[zero-point energy]].  Another approach is to reconsider [[Mach's principle]] and [[Euclidean space]].  A third research avenue that might ultimately prove useful for spacecraft propulsion is the [[Coupling (physics)|coupling of fundamental forces]] on sub-atomic scales.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt;

== Quantum vacuum energy experiments == 

One topic of investigations was the use of the [[zero-point energy]] field. As the [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] [[uncertainty principle]] implies that there is no such thing as an exact amount of energy in an exact location, [[quantum fluctuation|vacuum fluctuation]]s are known to lead to discernible effects such as the [[Casimir effect]]. The differential sail is a speculative drive, based on the possibility of inducing differences in the pressure of vacuum fluctuations on either side of a sail-like structure — with the pressure being somehow reduced on the forward surface of the sail, but pushing as normal on the raft surface — and thus propel a vehicle forward.&lt;ref name="frontierschapter3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="millis1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Millis|first1=Marc G.|title=Challenge to Create the Space Drive|journal=Journal of Propulsion and Power|date=September 1997|volume=13|issue=5|pages=577–582|doi=10.2514/2.5215|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19990023236.pdf|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Popular Science"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kP6ESrt1xLUC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=disjunction+drive#v=onepage&amp;q=disjunction%20drive&amp;f=false|title=Popular Science May 2001|author1=Corporation|first1=Bonnier|date=2001-05-01|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Casimir effect was investigated experimentally and analytically under the Breakthrough Propulsion Physics project.  This included the construction of MicroElectroMechanical
(MEM) rectangular Casimir cavities.&lt;ref name="millis20042" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maclay|first1=G. Jordan|title=Analysis of zero-point electromagnetic energy and Casimir forces in conducting rectangular cavities|journal=Physical Review A|date=17 April 2000|volume=61|issue=5|pages=052110|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.61.052110|bibcode=2000PhRvA..61e2110M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical work showed that the effect could be used to create net forces, although the forces would be extremely small.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="millis20042" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maclay|first1=G. Jordan|last2=Forward|first2=Robert L.|title=A Gedanken Spacecraft that Operates Using the Quantum Vacuum (Dynamic Casimir Effect)|journal=Foundations of Physics|date=March 2004|volume=34|issue=3|pages=477–500|doi=10.1023/B:FOOP.0000019624.51662.50|bibcode=2004FoPh...34..477M|arxiv=physics/0303108}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the project, the Casimir effect was categorized as an avenue for future research.&lt;ref name="millis2005" /&gt;

==Tau Zero Foundation==

After funding ended, program manager Marc G. Millis was supported by NASA to complete documentation of results. The book ''Frontiers of Propulsion Science'' was published by the [[AIAA]] in February 2009,&lt;ref&gt; M. Millis and E. Davis, ''Frontiers of Propulsion Science'', AIAA, Progress in Astronautics &amp; Aeronautics Vol 227, 2009. {{ISBN|978-1563479564}}
{{ISBN|1563479567}} &lt;/ref&gt; providing a deeper explanation of several propulsion methods.

Following program cancellation in 2002, Millis and others founded the Tau Zero Foundation.

A '''burr mill,''' or '''burr grinder,''' is a [[mill (grinding)|mill]] used to grind hard, small food products between two revolving abrasive surfaces separated by a distance usually set by the user.&lt;ref name="Steiman 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephenson 2015"/&gt; When the two surfaces are set far apart, the resulting ground material is coarser, and when the two surfaces are set closer together, the resulting ground material is finer and smaller.&lt;ref name="Stephenson 2015"/&gt; Often, the device includes a revolving screw that pushes the food through. It may be powered electrically or manually.

Burr mills do not heat the ground product by friction as much as do [[blade grinder]]s ("choppers"), and produce particles of a uniform size determined by the separation between the grinding surfaces.&lt;ref name="Steiman 2015"/&gt;

Food burr mills are usually manufactured for a single purpose: [[coffee]] beans, dried [[Black pepper|pepper]]corns, coarse [[salt]], [[spice]]s, or poppy seeds, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Easto | first=J. | last2=Willhoff | first2=A. | title=Craft Coffee: A Manual: Brewing a Better Cup at Home | publisher=Agate Publishing | year=2017 | isbn=978-1-57284-804-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hi3bDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT69 | access-date=October 14, 2017 | page=pt69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coffee mills are usually powered by [[electric motor]]s; domestic pepper, salt, and spice mills, used to sprinkle a little seasoning on food, are usually operated manually, sometimes by a [[battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered motor.

==Coffee grinders==
The uniform particle size achieved using a burr grinder can be desirable for [[coffee preparation]]. However, some methods of brewing may be more tolerant of the range of particle sizes produced by a blade grinder; this may be the case for percolated coffee. Regardless, burr coffee grinders are more suited for keeping the flavor and aroma of the coffee beans intact.&lt;ref name="Kingston 2015"/&gt; This is because burr mills produce less heat from friction compared to blade grinders;&lt;ref name="Kingston 2015"/&gt; this is especially important for coffee aficionados looking to get the most flavor from the freshly ground beans, as heat from friction lessens or taints the natural flavor.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Burr grinders create less friction and require lower motor speeds, which reduces potential flavor loss due to heat.

Burr grinders obtain these lower speeds through two mechanisms. The lower cost models generally use a small electric motor to drive a series of reduction gears, while better constructed and more costly examples use a larger commercial motor and a belt, with no gear reduction to spin the burrs. The latter example is termed "direct drive". The reduction gear versions are noisier and usually do not have the lifespan of the direct drive units.

Electrical powered burr grinders are available in many variations. Some grinders are "stepped" meaning that they are fixed by the factory into a set series of adjustments while "stepless" varieties use a [[worm drive]] or other mechanisms to offer an infinite number of adjustments within their grind range. Other variations include grinders that are equipped with dosers and others that are "doserless". Dosers function as a catch bin to collect the ground coffee and by using a lever, users are able to dose a set amount of coffee. Doserless versions remove the bin and dosing function, and the grinder outputs the ground coffee directly into an [[espresso machine]] [[Espresso machine#Portafilter|portafilter]] or into another container. The doserless examples normally feature additional functions such as weight based or advance time based grinding in order for a barista to grind for an exact amount of grounds required for a specific espresso shot.

Manual coffee grinders have been largely supplanted by electrically powered ones where the object is simply to get the job done; manual grinders are used more for their appearance, and are often more costly than electric models. An exception is the manual [[Turkey|Turkish]] coffee grinder; these are inexpensive, and can grind coffee to fine powder for [[Turkish coffee]], unlike electric models.

Many grinders are free-standing; some larger coffee grinders are fixed to a wall.

==Manual grinders==
Manual burr grinders are turned by hand, rotating one grinding surface against the other. Coffee mills usually have a handle, providing leverage for the many turns required to grind enough coffee for a cup. The ground coffee is collected in a container which is part of the mill.

Salt, pepper, and spice mills, essentially the same as coffee mills, usually do not have a handle, the entire top rotating instead. While this is less convenient, only a few turns are required to grind enough. The ground product falls directly onto the food being seasoned; the mill has no container. A few designs have abrasive surfaces which do not rotate; each squeeze of the handles moves one flat plate past another, then the plates are restored to their original position by a [[spring (device)|spring]]. Many hard spices are available in containers incorporating a simple cone burr grinder, intended to be discarded when empty.

Most grinders can be adjusted to set the fineness of grind.

Manual mills can be used for grinding other food products than they are intended for, but mills designed for pepper grinding are inappropriate for producing finely-ground [[flour]]. [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]]'s novel ''[[The Long Winter (novel)|The Long Winter]]'' describes a family grinding [[wheat]] in a coffee mill to make flour during months of hardship.

The first coffee grinder was made by Richard Dearmann, an English [[blacksmith]] from [[Birmingham]], in 1799. This grinder was widely distributed in the US, where Increase Wilson patented the first wall coffee grinder in 1818.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

[[Peugeot]] of [[France]] patented a pepper grinder in 1842. The mechanism of [[case-hardening|case-hardened steel]] cracked the peppercorns before the actual grinding process. The grooves on the Peugeot mechanism were individually cut into the metal and then case-hardened, making them very durable.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

== Types of materials ==
There are several types of materials used in pepper mills, each with its own particular advantages. [[Corrosion|Corrosion-resistant]] materials are used to grind salt.

'''[[Stainless steel]]''': One of the most suitable and durable materials for grinding peppercorns and coffee beans. The male and female sections of the grinding mechanism are usually made from [[sintered]] metal.  This material is preferred by professional chefs.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}  The teeth of the grinder are machined to cut spice or beans. Stainless steel is not suggested for grinding salt.

'''[[Zinc#Alloys|Zinc alloy]]''': Perhaps the most common mechanism found in pepper grinders, zinc alloy is composed of a mixture of metals, primarily zinc, often with [[chrome plating]] to resist corrosion. It is a good choice for grinding pepper but is not suitable for grinding salt.

'''[[Carbon steel]]''': An extremely hard metal, carbon steel provides the sharpest edges and most efficient grinding capability, and is preferred by professional chefs.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}  Carbon steel is not suitable for grinding salt.

'''[[Ceramic]]''': Ceramic is extremely hard and provides the best performance for multi-use grinding. It does not corrode and is suitable for grinding coffee beans,&lt;ref name="Stephenson 2015"/&gt; pepper, salt, and spices.

'''[[Acrylic resin|Acrylic]]''': Durable and low cost, acrylic is a non-corrosive material suitable for grinding salt and spices.

==Electric grinders==
Electric burr grinders are powered by [[electricity]] from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or mains supply.&lt;ref name="Davids 2013"/&gt; An [[electric motor]] drives the grinding elements against each other. Electric grinders grind faster than manual grinders with no effort, but friction and waste heat from the motor may heat the ground product slightly.

A '''callus shaver''' (also called a '''credo knife''') is a tool for the medical and cosmetic removal of a [[callus]], mainly on the feet (see also [[pedicure]]), or hands. Technically speaking, its function is the abrasive treatment of [[Hyperkeratosis|hyperkeratotic]] skin lesions.

The callus shaver consists of a handle, which is usually arched, and a blade made of ceramic or metal. Because the shaver is very sharp, injuries can result from careless use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=T-Online.de |url=http://www.t-online.de/lifestyle/besser-leben/testberichte/id_55930842/fusspflege-vorsicht-bei-hornhauthobeln.html |publisher=T-Online|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason the shaver is illegal in some states in the USA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/144768319|title=Rescue your nails : a do-it-yourself guide to perfect fingers &amp; toes|last=Ji.|first=Baek,|date=2008|publisher=Workman Pub|isbn=9780761143772|location=New York|oclc=144768319}}&lt;/ref&gt;A [[cellulitis]] infection is possible if the skin is cut, especially if the shaver is shared with others and not properly sterilized. In very severe cases, [[amputation]] or death can result.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbs17.com/news/health-alert/nc-woman-almost-loses-leg-after-nightmare-pedicure/1318821178&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment with a callus shaver should involve the user in a longer-term care plan. Calluses are usually several skin layers deep, which means that treatment must be repeated several times on the affected area (usually the feet) if it is to remain callus free. However, there should be a period of a few days between the individual treatments, otherwise skin irritations and/or an even thicker callus may occur.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rescue your nails, Page 129 |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=-3X8CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=%22callus+shaver%22&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22callus%20shaver%22&amp;f=false |publisher=Ji Baek|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The callus shaver should not be confused with a [[foot file]] (foot rasp), which is used during the after-treatment of working with a callus shaver.

The callus shaver and other instruments date back to the instruments mentioned by the Frenchman Nicolas-Laurent LaForest in his 1782 book "L’art de soigner les pieds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Revue du podulogue |url=http://www.connaissance-evolution.com/phocadownload/Articles/Publications_Neurostimulations-manuelles_Posturologie/La_Posturologie_Revue_du_podologue_num17_Septembre-Octobre2007.pdf |publisher=Revue du podulogue|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Capacitance Electronic Disc''' ('''CED''') is an [[analog video|analog]] [[video disc]] playback system developed by [[RCA]], in which video and audio could be played back on a [[TV set]] using a special needle and high-density groove system similar to [[phonograph]] records.

First conceived in 1964, the CED system was widely seen as a technological success which was able to increase the density of a [[long-playing record]] by two [[Order of magnitude#Uses|orders of magnitude]].&lt;ref name = "expect"&gt;{{cite web | title = RCA SelectaVision VideoDisc FAQ - Why did the CED system fail to even come close to RCA's expected market penetration? | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://www.cedmagic.com/home/cedfaq.html#onesixteen | accessdate = 2007-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this achievement, the CED system fell victim to poor planning, conflicts within RCA, and technical difficulties that slowed development and stalled production of the system for 17 years—until 1981, by which time it had already been made obsolete by laser videodisc ([[DiscoVision]], later called LaserVision and [[LaserDisc]]) as well as [[Betamax]] and [[VHS]] [[Videotape|video cassette]] formats. Sales for the system were nowhere near projected estimates. In 1984—before it was absorbed by [[General Electric]]—RCA discontinued player production, continuing software production until 1986, losing an estimated $600 million in the process. RCA had initially intended to release the SKT425 CED player with their high end [[RCA Dimensia|Dimensia]] system in 1984, but cancelled CED player production just prior to the Dimensia system's release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedmagic.com/museum/dimensia/skt425.html|title=RCA Dimensia SKT425 CED Video Disc Player|first=Tom|last=Howe|website=www.cedmagic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The format was commonly known as "[[videodisc]]", leading to much confusion with the contemporaneous LaserDisc format. LaserDiscs are read optically with a laser beam, whereas CED discs are read physically with a stylus (similar to a conventional [[gramophone record]]). The two systems are mutually incompatible.

RCA used the brand "[[SelectaVision]]" for the CED system, a name also used for some early RCA brand [[VCR]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = VBT200 - The First RCA SelectaVision VHS Video Cassette Recorder (VCR) | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://cedmagic.com/history/vbt200.html | accessdate = 2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other experimental projects at RCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = HoloTape | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://cedmagic.com/history/holotape.html | accessdate = 2007-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= MagTape | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://cedmagic.com/history/magtape.html | accessdate = 2007-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Beginnings and release ===
RCA began videodisc research in 1964, in an attempt to produce a phonograph-like method of reproducing video.  Research and development was slow in the early years, as the development team originally comprised only four men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = First Successful RCA SelectaVision VideoDisc Produced in 1972 | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://cedmagic.com/history/first-successful-ced.html | accessdate = 2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by 1972, the CED team at RCA had produced a disc capable of holding ten minutes of color video (a portion of the ''[[Get Smart]]'' episode "A Tale of Two Tails", re-titled "Lum Fong").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Lum Fong - First Successful RCA VideoDisc Web Page | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://cedmagic.com/featured/lum-fong/lum-fong.html | accessdate = 2007-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first CED prototype discs were multi-layered, consisting of a vinyl substrate, nickel conductive layer, glow-discharge insulating layer and silicone lubricant top layer.  However, failure to fully solve the stylus and disc wear and complexity of manufacturing forced RCA to search for simpler solutions to the problem for constructing the disc.  The final disc was crafted using [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] blended with carbon to allow the disc to be conductive.  To preserve stylus and groove life, a thin layer of silicone was applied to the disc as a lubricant.

CED videodiscs were originally meant to be sold in jackets and handled by hand similar to audio records, but during testing, it was shown that exposure to dust caused skipped grooves. It was learned that if dust was allowed to settle on the discs, then the dust would absorb moisture from the air and cement the dust particle to the disc surface, causing the stylus to jump back in a [[locked groove]] situation. Thus, an idea was developed in which the disc would be stored and handled in a caddy from which the CED would be extracted by the player so that exposure to dust would be minimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Comparison of 1977 CED Media to Final Production Media | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://cedmagic.com/history/ced-1977-vs-1982.html | accessdate = 2007-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 17 years of research and development, the first CED player (model SFT100W) was released on March 22, 1981. A catalog of approximately 50 titles was released at the same time.&lt;ref name=race&gt;{{cite web | title = Race For Your Life, Charlie Brown - The First RCA VideoDisc Title | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://cedmagic.com/history/race-for-your-life.html | accessdate = 2007-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first title to be manufactured was ''[[Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown]]''.&lt;ref name=race /&gt; Fifteen months later, RCA released the SGT200 and SGT250 players, both with [[stereo sound]] while the SGT-250 was also the first CED player model to include a wireless [[remote control]]. Models with [[random access]] hit the market in 1983.

=== Demise ===
Several problems doomed the new CED system before it was even introduced.  From an early point in the development of the CED system, it was clear that [[VCR]]s and home videotape—with their longer storage capacity and recording capabilities—would pose a threat to the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Richard Sonnenfeldt's "VIDEODISK" Book Chapter | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://www.cedmagic.com/mem/richard-sonnenfeldt-book.html | accessdate = 2007-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, development pushed ahead. Once finally released, sales for the new CED players were slow; RCA had expected to sell 200,000 players by the beginning of 1982, but only about half that number had been sold, and there was little improvement in sales throughout 1982 and 1983.&lt;ref name = "expect" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "whyquit"&gt;{{cite web | title = RCA SelectaVision VideoDisc FAQ - Why did RCA abandon further development of the CED system in April 1984? | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://www.cedmagic.com/home/cedfaq.html#oneseventeen | accessdate = 2007-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

The extremely long period of development—caused in part by political turmoil and a great deal of turnover in the high management of RCA—also contributed to the demise of the CED system.  RCA had originally slated the videodisc system for a 1977 release.  However, the discs were still not able to hold more than thirty minutes of video per side, and the nickel-like material used to make discs was not sturdy enough to put into manufacturing.  Signal degradation was also an issue, as the handling of the discs was causing them to deteriorate more rapidly than expected, baffling engineers.

RCA had hoped that by 1985 CED players would be in close to 50% of [[United States|American]] homes,&lt;ref name = "expect" /&gt; but the sales of players continued to drop. RCA attempted to cut the prices of CED players and offer special incentives to consumers such as rebates and free discs, but sales did not improve. RCA management realized that the system would never be profitable and announced the discontinuation of production of CED players on April 4, 1984.&lt;ref name = "whyquit" /&gt;  In an unexpected twist, demand for the videodiscs themselves became high immediately after the announcement, so RCA alerted customers that videodiscs would continue to be produced and new titles released for at least another three years after the discontinuation of players. Shortly after this announcement, however, the sale of discs declined sharply, prompting RCA to abandon disc production after only two years, in 1986.&lt;ref name = "fail"&gt;{{cite web | title = Memories of VideoDisc - CED Retailing at G&amp;M Video in Indiana | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://www.cedmagic.com/mem/ced-folklore.html | accessdate = 2007-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The last titles released were ''[[The Jewel of the Nile]]'' by [[CBS/Fox Video]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Memories of VideoDisc - Milestones - The Last Production CED Title | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://cedmagic.com/mem/milestones/mem268.html | accessdate = 2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Memories of VideoDisc'', a commemorative CED given to many RCA employees involved with the CED project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Memories of RCA VideoDisc Main Page | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://cedmagic.com/mem/memories-of-videodisc.html | accessdate = 2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; both in 1986.

== How CEDs work ==
[[File:Ced disk.jpg|thumb|Exposed CED disc]]
CEDs are conductive vinyl platters that are {{convert|30.0|cm|inch|abbr=on}} in diameter. To avoid metric names they are usually called "12&amp;nbsp;inch discs". A CED has a spiral groove on both sides. The groove is 657&amp;nbsp;nm wide and has a length of up to 12 miles (19&amp;nbsp;km). The discs rotate  at a constant angular speed during playback (450&amp;nbsp;rpm for [[NTSC]], 375&amp;nbsp;rpm for [[PAL]])  and each rotation contains 8 interlaced fields, or 4 full frames of video. These appear as spokes on the disc surface, with the gap between each field clearly visible under certain light. This meant that freeze frame was impossible on players without an expensive electronic frame store facility.

A keel-shaped needle with a titanium electrode layer rides in the groove with extremely light tracking force (65&amp;nbsp;mg) and an electronic circuit is formed through the disc and stylus. Like an audio turntable, the stylus reads the disc, starting at the outer edge and going towards the center. The video and audio signals are stored on the Videodiscs in a composite analog signal which is encoded into vertical undulations in the bottom of the groove, somewhat like pits. These undulations have a shorter [[wavelength]] than the length of the stylus tip in the groove, and the stylus rides over them; the varying distance between the stylus tip and the conductive surface due to the depth of the undulations in the groove under the stylus directly controls the [[capacitance]] between the stylus and the conductive carbon-loaded [[PVC]] disc. This varying capacitance in turn alters the [[frequency]] of a [[resonant circuit]], producing an [[Frequency modulation|FM]] electrical signal, which is then decoded into video and audio signals by the player's electronics.

The capacitive stylus pickup system which gives the CED its name can be contrasted with the technology of the conventional [[phonograph]].  Whereas the phonograph stylus physically vibrates with the variations in the record groove, and those vibrations are converted by a mechanical transducer (the phono pickup) to an electrical signal, the CED stylus normally does not vibrate and moves only to track the CED groove (and the disc surface—out-of-plane), while the signal from the stylus is natively obtained as an electrical signal.  This more sophisticated system, combined with a high revolution rate, is necessary to enable the encoding of video signals with bandwidth of a few megahertz, compared to a maximum of 20 kilohertz for an audio-only signal—a difference of two orders of magnitude.  Also, while the undulations in the bottom of the groove may be likened to pits, it is important to note that the spacing of vertical wave crests and troughs in a CED groove is continuously variable, as the CED is an [[Analog signal|analog]] [[Data storage device|medium]]. Usually, the term "pits", when used in the context of information media, refers to features with sharply defined edges and discrete lengths and depths, such as the [[Compact disc#Physical details|pits]] on [[Digital data|digital]] [[optical media]] such as [[CD]]s and [[DVD]]s.

In order to maintain an extremely light tracking force, the stylus arm is surrounded by coils, which sense deflection, and a circuit in the player responds to the signals from these coils by moving the stylus head carriage in steps as the groove pulls the stylus across the disc. Other coils are used to deflect the stylus, to finely adjust tracking. This system is very similar to—yet predates—the one used in [[Compact Disc]] players to follow the spiral optical track, where typically a servo motor moves the optical pickup in steps for coarse tracking and a set of coils shifts the laser lens for fine tracking, both guided by an optical sensing device, which is the analogue of CED stylus-deflection sensing coils. For the CED player, this tracking arrangement has the additional benefit that the stylus drag angle remains uniformly tangent to the groove, unlike the case for a phonograph [[tonearm]], in which the stylus drag angle and consequently the stylus side force varies with the tonearm angle, which in turn depends on the radial position on the record of the stylus. Whereas for a phonograph, where the stylus has a pinpoint tip, linear tracking is merely ideal to reduce wear of records and styli and to maximize tracking stability, for a CED player linear tracking is a necessity for the keel-shaped stylus, which must always stay tangent to the groove. Furthermore, the achievement of an extremely light tracking force on the CED stylus enables the use of a fine groove pitch (i.e. fine spacing of adjacent revolutions of the spiral), necessary to provide a long playing time at the required high rotational speed, while also limiting the rate of disc and stylus wear.

The disc is stored inside a caddy, from which the player extracts it when it is loaded. The disc itself is surrounded by a "spine", a plastic ring (actually square on the outside edge) with a thick, straight rim-like edge, which extends outside of, and latches into, the caddy. When a person inserts a caddy containing a disc into the player, the player captures the spine, and both the disc and the spine are left in the player as the person pulls the caddy out. The inner edges of the opening of the caddy have [[felt]] strips designed to catch any dust or other debris that could be on the disc as it is extracted.  Once the caddy has been withdrawn by the person, the player loads the disc onto the turntable, either manually with all SFT and most SGT prefix RCA players or automatically with the RCA SGT-250 and all other models and brands of players. When playback has been started, the player spins the disc up to speed while moving the pickup arm over the disc surface and lowering the stylus onto the beginning of the disc.

When Stop is pressed, the stylus is lifted from the disc and returned to its parking location, and the disc and spine are lifted up again to align with the caddy slot. When ready, the slot is unlocked, and the caddy can be inserted and withdrawn by a person, now with the disc back inside.

== Advantages ==

CED players, from an early point in their life, appealed to a lower-income market more than [[VHS]], [[Betamax]], and [[LaserDisc]].  The video quality (approximately 3&amp;nbsp;MHz of [[Luma (video)|luma]] bandwidth for CED&lt;ref name="CEDMagic.com"/&gt;) was comparable to a VHS-SP or Betamax-II video, but sub-par compared to LaserDisc (about 5&amp;nbsp;MHz of luma bandwidth).

CED players were intended to be "low-cost".
Because they have fewer precision parts than a VCR,
a CED player cost, at most, about half as much to manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;
"The early days"
by J. K. Clemens and E. O. Keizer.
"Electronic Servicing &amp; Technology" magazine 1982 May.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The discs themselves could be inexpensively duplicated, stamped out on slightly-modified audio [[gramophone record]] presses.

Like VCRs, CED videodisc players had features like rapid forward/reverse and visual search forward/reverse. They also had a pause feature, though it blanked the screen rather than displaying a still image; many players featured a "page mode", during which the current block of four successive frames would be repeatedly displayed.

Since CEDs were a disc-based system, they did not require rewinding. Early discs were generally [[monaural]], but later discs included [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] sound. (Monaural CED discs were packaged in white protective caddies, while stereo discs were packaged in blue protective caddies.)  Other discs could be switched between two separate mono audio tracks, providing features such as bilingual audio capability.

Like the LaserDisc and DVD, some CEDs feature random access and that users can quickly move to certain parts of the movie. Each side of a CED disc could be split into up to 63 "chapters", or bands. Two late RCA players (the SJT400 and SKT400) could access these bands in any given order. Unlike its laser-based counterparts, the chapters in a CED are based on minutes of the film, not scenes.

Novelty discs and CED-based games were produced whereby accessing the chapters in a specified order would string together a different story each time. However, only a few were produced before the halt of CED player manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A Walk Through the Universe CED Web Page | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://www.cedmagic.com/featured/universe.html | accessdate = 2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==

In comparison with [[LaserDisc]] technology, CEDs suffered from the fact that they were a phonograph-related contact medium.  RCA estimated that the number of times a CED could be played back, under ideal conditions, was 500.&lt;ref name = "last"&gt;{{cite web | title = RCA SelectaVision VideoDisc FAQ - How long can I expect my CED VideoDiscs to last? | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://cedmagic.com/home/cedfaq.html#threetwelve | accessdate = 2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, a clean, [[laser rot]]-free LaserDisc could, at least in theory, be played an unlimited number of times (although, repeated handling might still result in damage). Since the CED system used a stylus to read the discs, it was necessary to regularly change the stylus in the player to avoid damage to the videodiscs.

Worn and damaged discs also caused problems for consumers.  When a disc began to wear, video and audio quality would severely decline, and the disc would begin to skip more.&lt;ref name = "last" /&gt;  Several discs suffered from a condition called "video virus", where a CED would skip a great deal due to dust particles stuck in the grooves of the disc. However, playing the disc several times would generally solve this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = RCA SelectaVision VideoDisc FAQ - Why do some of my CED's skip, and what can I do to correct this? | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://cedmagic.com/home/cedfaq.html#threenine | accessdate = 2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[VHS]] tapes, CEDs required a disc flip at some point during the course of almost all films, because only sixty minutes of video could be stored per side (75 mins on UK PAL discs due to the slower rotation speed).  If a feature ran over two hours, it would be necessary to spread the feature over two discs.  (In some cases, if a movie's theatrical running time was only slightly longer than two hours—from 120 minutes and a few seconds to 122 minutes—studios would often trim short scenes throughout the movie or employ time compression, speeding the extra run time out of the film, in order to avoid the expense of issuing two discs.)  This problem was not unique to CEDs, as LaserDiscs presented the same difficulty, and some longer features, such as ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956), still required more than one tape or disc in the VHS, Beta, and [[LaserDisc]] formats. There were no two-disc UK PAL releases.

Less significant disadvantages include lack of support for [[Freeze frame shot|freeze-frame]] during pause, since CEDs scanned four frames in one rotation versus one frame per rotation on CAV LaserDisc, nor was computer technology advanced enough at the time to outfit the player with a [[framebuffer]] affordably. However, a "page mode" was available on many players that would allow those four frames to be repeated in an endless loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = CED Player Specifications | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://www.cedmagic.com/museum/ced-player-guide/ced-player-specifications.html | accessdate = 2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CEDs were also larger than VHS tapes, thicker than LaserDiscs and considerably heavier due to the plastic caddies.

=== Players ===
CED players were manufactured by four companies—RCA, [[Hitachi]], [[Sanyo]], and [[Toshiba]]—but seven other companies marketed players manufactured by these companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = RCA SelectaVision VideoDisc FAQ - Who manufactured CED Players, and how many different models are there? | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://www.cedmagic.com/home/cedfaq.html#twoone | accessdate = 2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = CED Player Name Brand Links | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://www.cedmagic.com/home/ced-name-brand-links.html | accessdate = 2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media ===
Upon release, 50 titles were available for the CED; along with RCA (which included the company's partnership with [[Columbia Pictures]] plus Paramount and Disney releases), CBS Video Enterprises (later [[CBS/FOX Video]]) produced the first 50 titles.&lt;ref name = "jj" /&gt; Eventually, [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Disney]], [[MGM]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment|MCA]], [[Vestron Video]], and other labels began to produce CED discs under their own home video labels, and did so until the end of disc manufacturing in 1986.

==Scientific goals==

CERES experiment has four main objectives:

* Continuation of the ERBE record of radiative fluxes at the [[Thermopause|top of the atmosphere]] (TOA) for [[climate change]] analysis.
* Doubling the [[accuracy]] of estimates of radiative fluxes at TOA and the Earth's surface.
* Provide the first long-term global estimates of the radiative fluxes within the Earth's atmosphere.
* Provide cloud property estimates that are consistent with the radiative fluxes from surface to TOA.

Each CERES instrument is a [[radiometer]] which has three channels – a shortwave (SW) channel to measure reflected sunlight in 0.2–5 [[µm]] region, a channel to measure Earth-emitted thermal radiation in the 8–12 [[µm]] "window" or "WN" region, and a Total channel to measure entire spectrum of outgoing Earth's radiation (&gt;0.2 [[µm]]).  The CERES instrument was based on the successful [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite|Earth Radiation Budget Experiment]] which used three satellites to provide global energy budget measurements from 1984 to 1993.&lt;ref&gt;NASA, [http://pmm.nasa.gov/TRMM/CERES Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES)] (accessed Sept. 9, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ground absolute calibration==

For a climate data record (CDR) mission like CERES, accuracy is of high importance and achieved for pure infrared nighttime measurements by use of a ground laboratory SI traceable blackbody to determine total and WN channel radiometric gains. This however was not the case for CERES solar channels such as SW and solar portion of the Total telescope, which have no direct un-broken chain to SI traceability. This is because CERES solar responses were measured on ground using lamps whose output energy were estimated by a cryo-cavity reference detector, which used a silver Cassegrain telescope identical to CERES devices to match the satellite instrument field of view. The reflectivity of this telescope built and used since the mid-1990s was never actually measured, estimated&lt;ref&gt;M. Folkman et al., "Calibration of a shortwave reference standard by transfer from a blackbody standard using a cryogenic active cavity radiometer", IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, pp. 2298–2300, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; only based on witness samples (see slide 9 of Priestley et al. (2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1072&amp;context=calcon|title=CERES CALCON Talk|first=Kory |last=Priestley et al|date=August 5, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Such difficulties in ground calibration, combined with suspected on-ground contamination events&lt;ref name=":0dcc" /&gt; have resulted in the need to make unexplained ground to flight changes in SW detector gains as big as 8%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth-www.larc.nasa.gov/ceresweb/input_parameters/gain_coeffs.html|title=CERES Gain Changes|first=Kory|last=Priestley|date=July 1, 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; simply to make the ERB data seem somewhat reasonable to climate science (note that CERES currently claims&lt;ref name=":0" &gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00149.1|title=Achieving Climate Change Absolute Accuracy|journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|volume=94|issue=10|page=1519|last=Wielicki et al|date=2013|publisher=Bull. Amer. Meteor. Soc.|doi=10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00149.1|bibcode=2013BAMS...94.1519W}}&lt;/ref&gt; a one sigma SW absolute accuracy of 0.9%).

==In-flight calibration==

CERES spatial resolution at nadir view (equivalent diameter of the footprint) is 10&amp;nbsp;km for CERES on TRMM, and 20&amp;nbsp;km for CERES on [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites. Perhaps of greater importance for missions such as CERES is calibration stability, or the ability to track and partition instrumental changes from Earth data so it tracks true climate change with confidence. CERES onboard [[calibration]] sources intended to achieve this for channels measuring reflected sunlight include solar diffusers and tungsten lamps. However the lamps have very little output in the important ultraviolet wavelength region where degradation is greatest and they have been seen to drift in energy by over 1.4% in ground tests, without a capability to monitor them on-orbit (Priestley et al. (2001)&lt;ref name=":0lamp" &gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0450(2001)040%3c2249:PRVOTC%3e2.0.CO;2|title=Postlaunch Radiometric Validation of the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Proto-Flight Model on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Spacecraft through 1999|journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology|volume=39|issue=12|page=2249|last=Priestley et al|publisher=Journal of Applied Meteorology.|doi=10.1175/1520-0450(2001)040&lt;2249:PRVOTC&gt;2.0.CO;2|year=2001|bibcode=2000JApMe..39.2249P}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Missions==

===First launch===
The first CERES instrument Proto-Flight Module (PFM) was launched aboard the [[NASA]] [[Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission]] (TRMM) in November 1997 from [[Japan]]. However, this instrument failed to operate after 8 months due to an on-board circuit failure.

===CERES on the EOS and JPSS mission satellites===
An additional six CERES instruments were launched on the [[Earth Observing System]] and the [[Joint Polar Satellite System]]. The Terra satellite, launched in December 1999, carried two (Flight Module 1 (FM1) and FM2) and the Aqua satellite, launched in May 2002, carried two more (FM3 and FM4). A fifth instrument (FM5) was launched on the [[Suomi NPP]] satellite in October 2011 and a sixth (FM6)  on [[NOAA-20]] in November 2017. With the failure of the PFM on TRMM and the 2005 loss of the SW channel of FM4 on Aqua, there are five of the CERES Flight Modules that are fully operational as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint Polar Satellite System - Launch Schedule|url=http://www.jpss.noaa.gov/launch_schedule.html|website=www.jpss.noaa.gov|accessdate=23 January 2017|language=en|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119125039/http://www.jpss.noaa.gov/launch_schedule.html|archivedate=19 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MissAndInst"&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint Polar Satellite System: Mission and Instruments|url=http://www.jpss.noaa.gov/mission_and_instruments.html|website=NASA|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radiation Budget Instruments===
The measurements of the CERES instruments will be furthered by the [[Radiation Budget Instrument]] (RBI) to be launched on [[Joint Polar Satellite System]]-2 (JPSS-2) in 2021, JPSS-3 in 2026, and JPSS-4 in 2031.&lt;ref name="MissAndInst"/&gt; The Trump administration however seems set to cancel the RBI project, despite most of the money for it already having been spent.{{Update after|2018|01}}

==Operating modes==

CERES operates in three scanning modes: across the satellite [[ground track]] (cross-track), along the direction of the satellite ground track (along-track), and in a Rotating Azimuth Plane (RAP). In RAP mode, the [[radiometers]] scan in elevation as they rotate in [[azimuth]], thus acquiring [[radiance]] measurement from a wide range of viewing angles. Until February 2005, on [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites one of CERES instruments scanned in cross-track mode while the other was in RAP or along-track mode. The instrument operating in RAP scanning mode took two days of along-track data every month. However the multi-angular CERES data allowed to derive new models which account for [[anisotropy]] of the viewed scene, and allow TOA radiative flux retrieval with enhanced precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JTECH1712.1|last= N.

{{Science}}

'''Computer science''' is the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of [[computer]]s. It involves the study of [[algorithm]]s that process, store, and communicate [[digital data|digital]] [[information]]. A [[computer scientist]] specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=computer%20scientist |title=WordNet Search—3.1 |publisher=Wordnetweb.princeton.edu |accessdate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its fields can be divided into a variety of theoretical and [[practical disciplines]]. Some fields, such as [[computational complexity theory]] (which explores the fundamental properties of [[Computational problem|computational]] and intractable problems), are highly abstract, while fields such as [[Computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics]] emphasize real-world visual applications. Other fields focus on challenges in implementing computation. For example, [[programming language theory]] considers various approaches to the description of computation, while the study of [[computer programming]] itself investigates various aspects of the use of [[programming language]]s and [[complex systems]]. [[Human–computer interaction]] considers the challenges in making computers and computations useful, usable, and [[Computer accessibility|universally accessible]] to humans.

[[File:Babbage40.png|upright|thumb|[[Charles Babbage]], sometimes referred to as the "father of computing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbi.umn.edu/about/babbage.html|title=Charles Babbage Institute: Who Was Charles Babbage?|website=cbi.umn.edu|access-date=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
[[File:Ada lovelace.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Ada Lovelace]] is often credited with publishing the first [[algorithm]] intended for processing on a computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/adalovelace/|title=Ada Lovelace {{!}}  Babbage Engine {{!}} Computer History Museum|website=www.computerhistory.org|access-date=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern [[digital computer]]. Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the [[abacus]] have existed since antiquity, aiding in computations such as multiplication and division. Further, [[algorithm]]s for performing computations have existed since antiquity, even before the development of sophisticated computing equipment.

[[Wilhelm Schickard]] designed and constructed the first working [[mechanical calculator]] in 1623.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilhelm Schickard – Ein Computerpionier|url=http://www.fmi.uni-jena.de/fmimedia/Fakultaet/Institute+und+Abteilungen/Abteilung+f%C3%BCr+Didaktik/GDI/Wilhelm+Schickard.pdf|language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1673, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, called the [[Stepped Reckoner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Computing|url=http://blogs.royalsociety.org/history-of-science/2012/06/25/history-of-computing/|first = Fiona|last = Keates|work = The Repository|publisher = The Royal Society|date = 25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may be considered the first computer scientist and information theorist, for, among other reasons, documenting the binary number system. In 1820, [[Charles Xavier Thomas|Thomas de Colmar]] launched the [[mechanical calculator]] industry&lt;ref group=note&gt;In 1851&lt;/ref&gt; when he released his simplified [[arithmometer]], which was the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. [[Charles Babbage]] started the design of the first ''automatic mechanical calculator'', his [[Difference Engine]], in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of the first ''programmable mechanical calculator'', his [[Analytical Engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/babbage/index.asp |title=Science Museum—Introduction to Babbage |accessdate=24 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908054017/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/babbage/index.asp |archivedate=September 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started developing this machine in 1834, and "in less than two years, he had sketched out many of the [[wikt:Special:Search/salient|salient]] features of the modern computer".&lt;ref name="Hyman1982"&gt;{{cite book |author=Anthony Hyman |title=Charles Babbage, pioneer of the computer |year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the [[Jacquard loom]]"&lt;ref name="Hyman1982" /&gt; making it infinitely programmable.&lt;ref group=note&gt;"The introduction of punched cards into the new engine was important not only as a more convenient form of control than the drums, or because programs could now be of unlimited extent, and could be stored and repeated without the danger of introducing errors in setting the machine by hand; it was important also because it served to crystallize Babbage's feeling that he had invented something really new, something much more than a sophisticated calculating machine." [[#COLLIER|Bruce Collier]], 1970&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843, during the translation of a French article on the Analytical Engine, [[Ada Lovelace]] wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the [[Bernoulli number]]s, which is considered to be the first computer program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottlan.edu/Lriddle/women/ada-love.htm |title=A Selection and Adaptation From Ada's Notes found in Ada, The Enchantress of Numbers," by Betty Alexandra Toole Ed.D.

In 1937, one hundred years after Babbage's impossible dream, [[Howard H. Aiken|Howard Aiken]] convinced IBM, which was making all kinds of punched card equipment and was also in the calculator business&lt;ref&gt;"In this sense Aiken needed IBM, whose technology included the use of punched cards, the accumulation of numerical data, and the transfer of numerical data from one register to another", [[#AIKEN|Bernard Cohen]], p.44 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; to develop his giant programmable calculator, the [[Harvard Mark I|ASCC/Harvard Mark I]], based on Babbage's Analytical Engine, which itself used cards and a central computing unit. When the machine was finished, some hailed it as "Babbage's dream come true".&lt;ref&gt;[[#ORIGINS|Brian Randell]], p. 187, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1940s, as new and more powerful [[computing]] machines were developed, the term ''computer'' came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) was founded in 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; As it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations, the field of computer science broadened to study [[computation]] in general. Computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s.&lt;ref name="Denning_cs_discipline"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/conference/EDSAC99/statistics.html |title=Some EDSAC statistics |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's first computer science degree program, the [[Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science]], began at the [[University of Cambridge]] [[Cambridge Computer Lab|Computer Laboratory]] in 1953. The first computer science degree program in the United States was formed at [[Purdue University]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.purdue.edu/about/conte.html |title=Computer science pioneer Samuel D. Conte dies at 85 |date=July 1, 2002 |publisher=Purdue Computer Science |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since practical computers became available, many applications of computing have become distinct areas of study in their own rights.

Although many initially believed it was impossible that computers themselves could actually be a scientific field of study, in the late fifties it gradually became accepted among the greater academic population.&lt;ref name="Levy1984"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Steven Levy |last=Levy |first=Steven |title=Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution |year=1984 |isbn=978-0385191951 |publisher=Doubleday |title-link=Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tedre2014"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tedre |first=Matti |title=The Science of Computing: Shaping a Discipline |year=2014 |publisher=Taylor and Francis / CRC Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the now well-known [[IBM]] brand that formed part of the computer science revolution during this time. IBM (short for International Business Machines) released the IBM 704&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/computer-graphics-music-and-art/15/222/633 |title=IBM 704 Electronic Data Processing System—CHM Revolution |publisher=Computerhistory.org |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later the IBM 709&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IBM 709: a powerful new data processing system |publisher=Computer History Museum |url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/IBM/IBM.709.1957.102646304.pdf |accessdate=December 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304130040/http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/IBM/IBM.709.1957.102646304.pdf |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; computers, which were widely used during the exploration period of such devices. "Still, working with the IBM [computer] was frustrating […] if you had misplaced as much as one letter in one instruction, the program would crash, and you would have to start the whole process over again".&lt;ref name="Levy1984"/&gt; During the late 1950s, the computer science discipline was very much in its developmental stages, and such issues were commonplace.&lt;ref name="Tedre2014"/&gt;

Time has seen significant improvements in the usability and effectiveness of [[computing technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Timeline of Computer History|url = http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/computers/|publisher = Computer History Museum|accessdate = November 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern society has seen a significant shift in the users of computer technology, from usage only by experts and professionals, to a near-[[ubiquitous]] user base. Initially, computers were quite costly, and some degree of humanitarian aid was needed for efficient use—in part from professional computer operators. As computer adoption became more widespread and affordable, less human assistance was needed for common usage.

[[File:Enigma.jpg|thumb|upright|The German military used the [[Enigma machine]] (shown here) during [[World War II]] for communications they wanted kept secret. The large-scale decryption of Enigma traffic at [[Bletchley Park]] was an important factor that contributed to Allied victory in WWII.&lt;ref name="kahnbook"/&gt;]]

Despite its short history as a formal academic discipline, computer science has made a number of fundamental contributions to science and society—in fact, along with [[electronics]], it is a founding science of the current epoch of human history called the [[Information Age]] and a driver of the [[information revolution]], seen as the third major leap in human technological progress after the [[Industrial Revolution]] (1750–1850 CE) and the [[Neolithic Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] (8000–5000 BC).

These contributions include:
* The start of the "[[Digital Revolution]]", which includes the current [[Information Age]] and the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name="bgu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Computer Science : Achievements and Challenges circa 2000 |url=http://www.cis.cornell.edu/Dean/Presentations/Slides/bgu.pdf |accessdate=January 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911104502/http://www.cis.cornell.edu/Dean/Presentations/Slides/bgu.pdf |archivedate=September 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Computer graphics]] and [[computer-generated imagery]] have become ubiquitous in modern entertainment, particularly in television, [[Filmmaking|cinema]], advertising, animation and video games. Even films that feature no explicit [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] are usually "filmed" now on [[digital camera]]s, or [[video editing|edited]] or [[Video post-processing|post-processed]] using a digital video editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maly|first1=Timy|title=How Digital Filmmakers Produced a Gorgeous Sci-Fi Movie on a Kickstarter Budget|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/01/kickstarted-scifi-movie/|journal=Wired|accessdate=November 24, 2015|date=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthau|first1=Charles|title=How Tech Has Shaped Film Making: The Film vs. Digital Debate Is Put to Rest|url=https://www.wired.com/insights/2015/01/how-tech-shaped-film-making/|journal=Wired|accessdate=November 24, 2015|date=2015-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Simulation]] of various processes, including computational [[fluid dynamics]], physical, electrical, and electronic systems and circuits, as well as societies and social situations (notably war games) along with their habitats, among many others. Modern computers enable optimization of such designs as complete aircraft. Notable in electrical and electronic circuit design are SPICE, as well as software for physical realization of new (or modified) designs. The latter includes essential design software for [[integrated circuit]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
* [[Artificial intelligence]] is becoming increasingly important as it gets more efficient and complex. There are many applications of AI, some of which can be seen at home, such as [[robotic vacuum cleaner]]s. It is also present in video games and on the modern battlefield in drones, anti-missile systems, and [[Legged Squad Support System|squad support robots]].
* [[Human–computer interaction]] combines novel algorithms with design strategies that enable rapid human performance, low error rates, ease in learning, and high satisfaction. Researchers use ethnographic observation and automated data collection to understand user needs, then conduct usability tests to refine designs. Key innovations include the [[direct manipulation]], selectable web links, [[touchscreen]] designs, mobile applications, and [[virtual reality]].

==Etymology==
{{see also|Informatics#Etymology}}

Although first proposed in 1956,&lt;ref name="Tedre2014"/&gt; the term "computer science" appears in a 1959 article in ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'',&lt;ref name="Fine_1959"&gt;
{{cite journal

 |year=1959

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
in which Louis Fein argues for the creation of a ''Graduate School in Computer Sciences'' analogous to the creation of [[Harvard Business School]] in 1921,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanford University Oral History|url=http://library.stanford.edu/guides/stanford-university-oral-history|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; justifying the name by arguing that, like [[management science]], the subject is applied and interdisciplinary in nature, while having the characteristics typical of an academic discipline.&lt;ref name="Fine_1959"/&gt;
His efforts, and those of others such as [[numerical analysis|numerical analyst]] [[George Forsythe]], were rewarded: universities went on to create such programs, starting with Purdue in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Knuth]] (1972). ''[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ICME/docs/history/forsythe_knuth.pdf "George Forsythe and the Development of Computer Science"]. ''Comms.

Because of this, several alternative names have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Matti Tedre |year=2006 |url=http://epublications.uef.fi/pub/urn_isbn_952-458-867-6/urn_isbn_952-458-867-6.pdf |title=The Development of Computer Science: A Sociocultural Perspective |page=260 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain departments of major universities prefer the term ''computing science'', to emphasize precisely that difference. Danish scientist [[Peter Naur]] suggested the term ''datalogy'',&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author=Peter Naur
 |year=1966
 |title=The science of datalogy
 |journal=Communications of the ACM
 |volume=9 |issue=7 |page=485
 |doi=10.1145/365719.366510
}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reflect the fact that the scientific discipline revolves around data and data treatment, while not necessarily involving computers. The first scientific institution to use the term was the Department of Datalogy at the University of Copenhagen, founded in 1969, with Peter Naur being the first professor in datalogy. The term is used mainly in the Scandinavian countries. An alternative term, also proposed by Naur, is [[data science]]; this is now used for a distinct field of data analysis, including statistics and databases.

Also, in the early days of computing, a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of computing were suggested in the ''Communications of the ACM''—''turingineer'', ''turologist'', ''flow-charts-man'', ''applied meta-mathematician'', and ''applied [[epistemology|epistemologist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Communications of the ACM |date=&lt;!-- missing! --&gt; |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=1 |issue=4 |page=6| doi = 10.1145/368796.368802|last1=Weiss |first1=E.A. |last2=Corley |first2=Henry P.T. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later in the same journal, ''comptologist'' was suggested, followed next year by ''hypologist''.&lt;ref&gt;Communications of the ACM 2(1):p.4&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''computics'' has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Computer 28(12): p.136&lt;/ref&gt; {{anchor|Name of the field in Europe}}In Europe, terms derived from contracted translations of the expression "automatic information" (e.g. "informazione automatica" in Italian) or "information and mathematics" are often used, e.g. ''informatique'' (French), ''Informatik'' (German), ''informatica'' (Italian, Dutch), ''informática'' (Spanish, Portuguese), ''informatika'' ([[Slavic languages]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]) or ''pliroforiki'' (''πληροφορική'', which means informatics) in [[Greek language|Greek]]. Similar words have also been adopted in the UK (as in ''the School of Informatics of the University of Edinburgh'').&lt;ref&gt;P. Mounier-Kuhn, ''L'Informatique en France, de la seconde guerre mondiale au Plan Calcul. L'émergence d'une science'', Paris, PUPS, 2010, ch. 3 &amp; 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
"In the U.S., however, [[informatics]] is linked with applied computing, or computing in the context of another domain."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69363-why-an-informatics-degree]&lt;/ref&gt;

A folkloric quotation, often attributed to—but almost certainly not first formulated by—[[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Edsger Dijkstra]], states that "computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes."&lt;ref group=note&gt;See the entry
"[[q:Computer science|Computer science]]" on Wikiquote for the history of this quotation.&lt;/ref&gt; The design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science. For example, the study of computer hardware is usually considered part of [[computer engineering]], while the study of commercial [[computer system]]s and their deployment is often called information technology or [[information system]]s. However, there has been much cross-fertilization of ideas between the various computer-related disciplines. Computer science research also often intersects other disciplines, such as philosophy, [[cognitive science]], [[computational linguistics|linguistics]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[computational statistics|statistics]], and [[logic]].

Computer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines, with some observers saying that computing is a mathematical science.&lt;ref name="Denning_cs_discipline" /&gt; Early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Alan Turing]], [[Rózsa Péter]] and [[Alonzo Church]] and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas such as [[mathematical logic]], [[category theory]], [[domain theory]], and [[algebra]].&lt;ref name="Tedre2014"/&gt;

The relationship between computer science and software engineering is a contentious issue, which is further muddied by [[Software engineer#Use of the title "Engineer"|disputes]] over what the term "software engineering" means, and how computer science is defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tedre | first1 = M. | title = Computing as a Science: A Survey of Competing Viewpoints | doi = 10.1007/s11023-011-9240-4 | journal = Minds and Machines | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 361–387 | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Parnas]], taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines, has claimed that the principal focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general, while the principal focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals, making the two separate but complementary disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Parnas | first1 = D.L. | journal = Annals of Software Engineering | volume = 6 | pages = 19–37 | year = 1998 | doi = 10.1023/A:1018949113292|title=Software engineering programmes are not computer science programmes}}, p. 19: "Rather than treat software engineering as a subfield of computer science, I treat it as an element of the set, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, […]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic, political, and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on whether a department formed with a mathematical emphasis or with an engineering emphasis. Computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with [[computational science]]. Both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research.

==Philosophy==
{{main|Philosophy of computer science}}
A number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three separate paradigms in computer science. [[Peter Wegner]] argued that those paradigms are science, technology, and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author=Wegner, P. |title=Research paradigms in computer science—Proceedings of the 2nd international Conference on Software Engineering |location=San Francisco, California, United States |date=October 13–15, 1976 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter J. Denning|Peter Denning]]'s working group argued that they are theory, abstraction (modeling), and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Denning | first1 = P.J. | last2 = Comer | first2 = D.E. | last3 = Gries | first3 = D. | last4 = Mulder | first4 = M.C. | last5 = Tucker | first5 = A. | last6 = Turner | first6 = A.J. | last7 = Young | first7 = P.R. | title = Computing as a discipline | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 32 | pages = 9–23 | date = January 1989 | doi = 10.1145/63238.63239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnon H. Eden described them as the "rationalist paradigm" (which treats computer science as a branch of mathematics, which is prevalent in theoretical computer science, and mainly employs [[deductive reasoning]]), the "technocratic paradigm" (which might be found in engineering approaches, most prominently in software engineering), and the "scientific paradigm" (which approaches computer-related artifacts from the empirical perspective of [[natural science]]s, identifiable in some branches of [[artificial intelligence]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = A.H. | title = Three Paradigms of Computer Science | journal = [[Minds and Machines]] | last1 = Eden | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.eden-study.org/articles/2007/three_paradigms_of_computer_science.pdf | doi = 10.1007/s11023-007-9060-8 | pages = 135–167 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160215100211/http://www.eden-study.org/articles/2007/three_paradigms_of_computer_science.pdf | archivedate = February 15, 2016 | df = mdy-all | citeseerx = 10.1.1.304.7763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software.&lt;ref name="CSAB1997"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Computing Sciences Accreditation Board|title=Computer Science as a Profession|url=http://www.csab.org/comp_sci_profession.html |date=May 28, 1997| accessdate=23 May 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080617030847/http://www.csab.org/comp_sci_profession.html |archivedate = June 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Committee on the Fundamentals of Computer Science: Challenges and Opportunities, National Research Council |title=Computer Science: Reflections on the Field, Reflections from the Field|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11106#toc|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0309093019|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[CSAB (professional organization)|CSAB]], formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation Board—which is made up of representatives of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM), and the [[IEEE Computer Society]] (IEEE CS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csab.org/ |title=CSAB Leading Computer Education |publisher=CSAB |date=August 3, 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;—identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science: ''theory of computation'', ''algorithms and data structures'', ''programming methodology and languages'', and ''computer elements and architecture''. In addition to these four areas, CSAB also identifies fields such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networking and communication, database systems, parallel computation, distributed computation, human–computer interaction, computer graphics, operating systems, and numerical and symbolic computation as being important areas of computer science.&lt;ref name="CSAB1997"/&gt;

===Theoretical computer science===
{{main|Theoretical computer science}}
''Theoretical Computer Science'' is mathematical and abstract in spirit, but it derives its motivation from practical and everyday computation. Its aim is to understand the nature of '''computation''' and, as a consequence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies. All studies related to mathematical, logic and formal concepts and methods could be considered as theoretical computer science, provided that the motivation is clearly drawn from the field of '''computing'''.

====Data structures and algorithms====
Data structures and algorithms are the study of commonly used computational methods and their computational efficiency.

====Theory of computation====
{{main|Theory of computation}}
According to [[Peter J. Denning|Peter Denning]], the fundamental question underlying computer science is, "What can be (efficiently) automated?"&lt;ref name="Denning_cs_discipline"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Denning | first=Peter J. | authorlink=Peter J. Denning | year=2000 | title=Computer Science: The Discipline | url=http://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/dif8916/denning.pdf | journal=Encyclopedia of Computer Science | format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060525195404/http://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/dif8916/denning.pdf |archivedate = May 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of computation is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations. In an effort to answer the first question, [[computability theory]] examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical [[models of computation]]. The second question is addressed by [[computational complexity theory]], which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of computational problems.

The famous [[P versus NP problem|P = NP?]] problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute] P = NP {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014194456/http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ |date=October 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an open problem in the theory of computation.

====Information and coding theory====
{{main|Information theory|Coding theory}}
Information theory is related to the quantification of information. This was developed by [[Claude Shannon]] to find fundamental limits on [[signal processing]] operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=October 14, 2002 |last=P. Collins |first=Graham |title=Claude E. Shannon: Founder of Information Theory |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=claude-e-shannon-founder |work=Scientific American |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Coding theory is the study of the properties of [[code]]s (systems for converting information from one form to another) and their fitness for a specific application. Codes are used for [[data compression]], [[cryptography]], [[error detection and correction]], and more recently also for [[Linear network coding|network coding]]. Codes are studied for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable [[data transmission]] methods.

====Programming language theory====
{{main|Programming language theory}}
Programming language theory is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of [[programming language]]s and their individual [[Programming language#Elements|features]]. It falls within the discipline of computer science, both depending on and affecting [[mathematics]], software engineering, and [[linguistics]]. It is an active research area, with numerous dedicated academic journals.

====Formal methods====
{{main|Formal methods}}
Formal methods are a particular kind of [[Mathematics|mathematically]] based technique for the [[formal specification|specification]], development and [[formal verification|verification]] of software and [[computer hardware|hardware]] systems. The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design. They form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved. Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing. For industrial use, tool support is required. However, the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high-integrity and [[life-critical system]]s, where safety or [[computer security|security]] is of utmost importance. Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of [[theoretical computer science]] fundamentals, in particular [[logic in computer science|logic]] calculi, [[formal language]]s, [[automata theory]], and [[program semantics]], but also [[type systems]] and [[algebraic data types]] to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.

===Computer systems===

====Computer architecture and computer engineering====
{{main|Computer architecture|Computer engineering}}
Computer architecture, or digital computer organization, is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system. It focuses largely on the way by which the central processing unit performs internally and accesses addresses in memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=A. Thisted|first=Ronald|title=Computer Architecture |url=http://galton.uchicago.edu/~thisted/Distribute/comparch.pdf|publisher=The University of Chicago|date=April 7, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field often involves disciplines of computer engineering and electrical engineering, selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create computers that meet functional, performance, and cost goals.

====Computer performance analysis====
{{main|Computer performance}}
Computer performance analysis is the study of work flowing through computers with the general goals of improving [[throughput]], controlling [[Response time (technology)|response time]], using resources efficiently, eliminating [[bottleneck (software)|bottleneck]]s, and predicting performance under anticipated peak loads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wescott | first = Bob | title = The Every Computer Performance Book, Chapter 3: Useful laws  | publisher = [[CreateSpace]] | date = 2013 | isbn = 978-1482657753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Concurrent, parallel and distributed systems====
{{main|Concurrency (computer science)|Distributed computing}}
Concurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously, and potentially interacting with each other. A number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including [[Petri net]]s, [[Process calculus|process calculi]] and the [[Parallel random-access machine|Parallel Random Access Machine]] model. A distributed system extends the idea of concurrency onto multiple computers connected through a network. Computers within the same distributed system have their own private memory, and information is often exchanged among themselves to achieve a common goal.

====Computer networks====
{{main|Computer network}}
This branch of computer science aims to manage networks between computers worldwide.

====Computer security and cryptography====
{{main|Computer security|Cryptography}}
Computer security is a branch of computer technology with an objective of protecting information from unauthorized access, disruption, or modification while maintaining the accessibility and usability of the system for its intended users. [[Cryptography]] is the practice and study of hiding (encryption) and therefore deciphering (decryption) information. Modern cryptography is largely related to computer science, for many encryption and decryption algorithms are based on their computational complexity.

====Databases====
{{main|Database}}
{{Missing information|a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.|date=September 2018}}
A database is intended to organize, store, and retrieve large amounts of data easily. Digital databases are managed using database management systems to store, create, maintain, and search data, through [[database model]]s and [[query language]]s.

====Informatics practices====  &lt;!-- Redirect target of [[Informatics Practices]] --&gt;
''Informatics practices'' (IP) is a field of software-related study. The course mainly covers [[Coding theory|coding]], software and networking concepts. This field is comparable to computer science, but lacks the [[computer hardware|hardware]] concepts, while focusing more on [[computer network|networking]] concepts than computer science. This branch of [[information science]] and computer science mainly focuses on the study of [[information processing]], particularly with respect to [[system integration]] and human interactions with machine and data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbseacademic.nic.in/web_material/Curriculum19/Main-SeniorSecondary/15_Information_Practices_New.pdf|title=Informatics Practices (New)|website=Central Board of Secondary Education|accessdate=8 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer applications===

====Computer graphics and visualization====
{{main|Computer graphics (computer science)}}
Computer graphics is the study of digital visual contents and involves the synthesis and manipulation of image data. The study is connected to many other fields in computer science, including [[computer vision]], [[image processing]], and [[computational geometry]], and is heavily applied in the fields of special effects and [[video games]].

====Human–computer interaction====
{{main|Human–computer interaction}}
Research that develops theories, principles, and guidelines for user interface designers, so they can create satisfactory user experiences with desktop, laptop, and mobile devices.

====Scientific computing====
[[Scientific computing]] (or [[computational science]]) is the field of study concerned with constructing [[scientific modelling|mathematical models]] and [[numerical analysis|quantitative analysis]] techniques and using computers to analyze and solve [[Science|scientific]] problems. In practical use, it is typically the application of [[computer simulation]] and other forms of [[computation]] to problems in various scientific disciplines.

====Artificial intelligence====
{{main|Artificial intelligence}}
Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to or is required to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, learning, and communication found in humans and animals. From its origins in [[cybernetics]] and in the [[History of artificial intelligence|Dartmouth Conference]] (1956), artificial intelligence research has been necessarily cross-disciplinary, drawing on areas of expertise such as [[applied mathematics]], [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], [[semiotics]], [[electrical engineering]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[neurophysiology]], and [[social intelligence]]. AI is associated in the popular mind with [[Robotics|robotic development]], but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of [[software development]], which require computational understanding. The starting point in the late 1940s was [[Alan Turing]]'s question "Can computers think?", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the [[Turing test]] is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence. But the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real-world data.

===Software engineering===
{{main|Software engineering}}
{{see also|Computer programming}}
Software engineering is the study of designing, implementing, and modifying software in order to ensure it is of high quality, affordable, maintainable, and fast to build. It is a systematic approach to software design, involving the application of engineering practices to software. Software engineering deals with the organizing and analyzing of software—it doesn't just deal with the creation or manufacture of new software, but its internal maintenance and arrangement.

==The great insights of computer science==
The philosopher of computing [[William J. Rapaport|Bill Rapaport]] noted three ''Great Insights of Computer Science'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/computation.html|title=What Is Computation?|publisher=State University of New York at Buffalo|last = Rapaport|first = William J.|date = 20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s, [[George Boole]]'s, [[Alan Turing]]'s, [[Claude Shannon]]'s, and [[Samuel Morse]]'s insight: there are only ''two objects'' that a computer has to deal with in order to represent "anything".{{refn |group="note"|The word "anything" is written in quotation marks because there are things that computers cannot do. One example is: to answer the question if an arbitrary given computer program will eventually finish or run forever (the [[Halting problem]]).}}
:: All the information about any computable problem can be represented using only 0 and 1 (or any other bistable pair that can flip-flop between two easily distinguishable states, such as "on/off", "magnetized/de-magnetized", "high-voltage/low-voltage", etc.).
{{see also|Digital physics}}
* [[Alan Turing]]'s insight: there are only ''five actions'' that a computer has to perform in order to do "anything".
:: Every algorithm can be expressed in a language for a computer consisting of only five basic instructions:
::* move left one location;
::* move right one location;
::* read symbol at current location;
::* print 0 at current location;
::* print 1 at current location.
{{see also|Turing machine}}
* [[Corrado Böhm]] and [[Giuseppe Jacopini]]'s insight: there are only ''three ways of combining'' these actions (into more complex ones) that are needed in order for a computer to do "anything".
:: Only three rules are needed to combine any set of basic instructions into more complex ones:
::* ''sequence'': first do this, then do that;
::* '' selection'': IF such-and-such is the case, THEN do this, ELSE do that;
::* ''repetition'': WHILE such-and-such is the case DO this.
:: Note that the three rules of Boehm's and Jacopini's insight can be further simplified with the use of [[goto]] (which means it is more elementary than [[structured programming]]).

==Academia==
{{further|List of computer science conferences|Category:Computer science journals}}
Conferences are important events for computer science research. During these conferences, researchers from the public and private sectors present their recent work and meet. Unlike in most other academic fields, in computer science, the prestige of [[proceedings|conference papers]] is greater than that of journal publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=Bertrand|title=Viewpoint: Research evaluation for computer science|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=April 2009|volume=25|issue=4|pages=31–34|doi=10.1145/1498765.1498780}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patterson|first1=David|title=Evaluating Computer Scientists and Engineers For Promotion and Tenure|url=http://cra.org/resources/bp-view/evaluating_computer_scientists_and_engineers_for_promotion_and_tenure/|publisher=Computing Research Association|date=August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed explanation for this is the quick development of this relatively new field requires rapid review and distribution of results, a task better handled by conferences than by journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fortnow|first1=Lance|title=Viewpoint: Time for Computer Science to Grow Up|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=August 2009|volume=52|issue=8|pages=33–35|doi=10.1145/1536616.1536631|url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/8/34492-viewpoint-time-for-computer-science-to-grow-up/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming paradigms==
{{main|Programming paradigm}}

Programming languages can be leveraged as tools to accomplish a variety of tasks. Therefore, different programming paradigms exist. A few basic programming paradigms used throughout computer science are:

* [[Object-oriented programming|Object-Oriented Programming]]: "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. Thus Object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another."
* [[Imperative programming|Imperative Programming]]: "In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Imperative programming|date=2018-10-07|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Imperative_programming&amp;oldid=862960283|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Functional programming|Functional Programming]]: "In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Functional programming|date=2018-10-06|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Functional_programming&amp;oldid=862736578|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Procedural programming|Procedural Programming]]: "Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions (not to be confused with mathematical functions, but similar to those used in functional programming), simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Procedural programming|date=2018-09-09|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Procedural_programming&amp;oldid=858695015|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most programming languages offer support for multiple programming paradigms, making the distinction more a matter of style than of technical capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Multi-Paradigm Programming Language |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/multiparadigmlanguage.html |website=developer.mozilla.org |publisher=[[Mozilla Foundation]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821052407/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/multiparadigmlanguage.html |archive-date=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Since computer science is a relatively new field, it is not as widely taught in schools and universities as other academic subjects. For example, in 2014, [[Code.org]] estimated that only 10 percent of high schools in the United States offered computer science education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Computer Science: Not Just an Elective Anymore|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/02/26/22computer_ep.h33.html|work=Education Week|date=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 report by Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) revealed that only 14 out of 50 states have adopted significant education standards for high school computer science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Running on Empty: The Failure to Teach K–12 Computer Science in the Digital Age |url = http://runningonempty.acm.org/fullreport2.pdf | date= 2010|first1 =Cameron |last1=Wilson|publisher = ACM|first2=Leigh Ann|last2= Sudol|first3= Chris|last3 =Stephenson|first4 =Mark |last4=Stehlik}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, computer science education is growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2016/09/how-to-teach-computational-thinking/|title=How to Teach Computational Thinking—Stephen Wolfram Blog|website=blog.stephenwolfram.com|access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries, such as Israel, New Zealand and South Korea, have already included computer science in their respective national secondary education curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A is for algorithm|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21601250-global-push-more-computer-science-classrooms-starting-bear-fruit|work=The Economist|date=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Computing at School International comparisons|url=http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/data/uploads/internationalcomparisons-v5.pdf|accessdate=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries are following suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adding Coding to the Curriculum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/24/world/europe/adding-coding-to-the-curriculum.html|work=The New York Times|date=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most countries, there is a significant gender gap in computer science education. For example, in the US about 20% of computer science degrees in 2012 were conferred to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Percentage of Bachelor's degrees conferred to women, by major (1970-2012) |url = http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/14/percentage-of-bachelors-degrees-conferred-to-women-by-major-1970-2012/|accessdate=July 20, 2015|date = 14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gender gap also exists in other Western countries.&lt;ref name="gender"&gt;{{cite web|title=IT gender gap: Where are the female programmers? |url =http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/software-engineer/it-gender-gap-where-are-the-female-programmers/|first = Justin |last = James |work = TechRepublic}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some parts of the world, the gap is small or nonexistent. In 2011, approximately half of all computer science degrees in [[Malaysia]] were conferred to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=what gender is science|url=http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/faculty/mariacharles/documents/WhatGenderisScience.pdf|accessdate=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, women made up 54.5% of computer science graduates in [[Guyana]].&lt;ref name="gender"/&gt;

'''Corpse paint''' or '''corpsepaint''' is a style of black and white [[Cosmetics|makeup]] used by [[black metal]] bands for concerts and band photos. The makeup is used to make the musicians appear inhuman, [[Cadaver|corpse]]-like, or [[demon]]ic, and is perhaps "the most identifiable aspect of the black metal aesthetic."&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, Dayal: ''Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult''; 2013, [[Feral House]], Port Townsend, Washington; p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corpse paint typically involves making the face and neck white and making the area around the [[eyes]] and [[lips]] [[black]]. Musicians will often have a trademark style. Other colors are seldom used, yet there are notable exceptions, such as [[Attila Csihar]]'s use of neon colors and the bands [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]] and [[Dødheimsgard]] experimenting with color as well.

Outside of black metal, [[face painting|face-painting]] has been used by a variety of other public figures such as [[shock rock]] artists (notably [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], and members of the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]]) and [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestlers]] (e.g. [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] and [[Vampiro]]).

==History and usage==
[[File:Urgehal Metal Mean Festival 20 08 2011 10.jpg|thumb|Enzifer of [[Urgehal]] wearing corpse paint with the spiked armbands and inverted crosses commonly worn by black metal musicians]]

The earliest [[Rock music|rock]] groups to wear makeup similar to corpse paint included [[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]] and [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]] in the 1960s; [[Secos &amp; Molhados]], [[Alice Cooper]] and KISS in the 1970s; and later that decade, [[punk rock]] bands like the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] and singer [[David Vanian]] of [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]]. On seeing shock rock pioneer Arthur Brown performing his US number two hit "Fire" in 1968, Alice Cooper states, "Can you imagine the young Alice Cooper watching that with all his make-up and hellish performance? It was like all my Halloweens came at once!."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alice Cooper Recruits Arthur Brown For Fire-themed Halloween Show|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/alice-cooper-arthur-brown-halloween-show/|agency=Ultimate Classic Rock|date=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, [[Hellhammer]] and [[King Diamond]] of [[Mercyful Fate]] (who used corpse paint as early as 1978 in his band Black Rose) were among the early [[metal]] groups to use corpse paint. [[Per "Dead" Ohlin]] was the first to explicitly associate stylized face paint with an attempt to look like a corpse according to Mayhem drummer Jan Axel "Hellhammer" Blomberg.&lt;ref name="Interview with Hellhammer conducted by Dmitry Basik June 1998"&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20080219143612/http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-june1998.htm Interview with Hellhammer conducted by Dmitry Basik June 1998]''&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups soon followed suit, including Hellhammer's later incarnation [[Celtic Frost]]. [[Brazil]]ian band [[Sarcófago]] also pioneered the look, being dubbed by ''Metal Storm'' magazine as the first band with "true" corpse paint.&lt;ref name="On the Role of Clothing Styles In The Development of Metal - Part I"&gt;[http://www.metalstorm.ee/pub/article.php?article_id=66 On the Role of Clothing Styles In The Development of Metal - Part I - Metal Storm&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Necrobutcher]] insists that his band [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] was the first to use corpse paint and credits the band's singer [[Per "Dead" Ohlin]] with coining the term.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, Dayal: ''Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult''; 2013, Feral House, Port Townsend, Washington; p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Early corpse paint was meant simply to highlight an individual's features and make them look "dead."[http://www.dravenstales.ch/en/a-brief-history-of-corpse-paint/]

Bands of the early Norwegian [[early Norwegian black metal scene|black metal scene]] used corpse paint extensively. Early vocalist of Mayhem [[Per "Dead" Ohlin]] started wearing it in the late 1980s. According to [[Necrobutcher]], Mayhem's bass player: "It wasn't anything to do with the way Kiss and Alice Cooper used make-up. Dead actually wanted to look like a corpse. He didn't do it to look cool."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Campion: [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/feb/20/popandrock4 ''In the Face of Death'']. In: ''[[The Observer]]'', 20. February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, other Norwegian black metal bands followed suit and their style and sound was adopted by bands around the world. Eventually, some Norwegian bands—such as [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]] and [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]]—stopped wearing corpse paint, often citing its loss of meaning or trendiness due to use by so many bands.

'''Cyanuric triazide''' (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; or (NCN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is described as an environmentally friendly, low toxicity, and organic [[primary explosive]] with a [[detonation velocity]] of about 7,300 m·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and [[ignition temperature]] at 205&amp;nbsp;°C. Primary research on this compound focuses on its use as a high [[energy density]] compound.

== Structure ==

Cyanuric triazide is planar and has three-fold axis symmetry consisting of alternating carbon and nitrogen atoms, whose centers alternate 1.38&amp;nbsp;Å and 1.31&amp;nbsp;Å apart. The distance between the center of the ring and carbon atoms of each of the nitrogens is 1.30&amp;nbsp;Å and 1.39&amp;nbsp;Å. This fixing of the position of the bonds in the cynauric ring is mainly due to the unsymmetrical positions of the azide chains. Azide groups are linked to the carbon atoms on the cyanuric ring by single bonds with an interatomic distance of 1.38&amp;nbsp;Å, similar to the cyanuric ring itself.

== Occurrence ==

This compound is purely synthetic and therefore does not exist in nature.

== Synthesis ==

Cyanuric triazide can be synthesized via an alkyl elimination reaction using [[cyanuric trichloride]] with an excess of [[sodium azide]] refluxed in [[acetone]] solution.  The white crystals can then be purified via crystallization in -20&amp;nbsp;°C [[toluene]].&lt;ref name="pubs"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cm000570y | title = Synthesis of Nitrogen-Rich Carbon Nitride Networks from an Energetic Molecular Azide Precursor | year = 2000 | last1 = Gillan | first1 = Edward G. | journal = Chemistry of Materials | volume = 12 | issue = 12 | pages = 3906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cyanuric triazide synthesis 02.svg|460px]]

== Decomposition reactions ==

This white polycrystalline solid was found to be stable under standard conditions but is extremely shock sensitive causing it to violently decompose when ground with a mortar.  Cyanuric triazide’s thermodynamic properties were studied using bomb calorimetry with H = 2235 kJ·mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; under oxidizing conditions and H = 740 kJ·mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; otherwise.  This combustion enthalpy of 2234 kJ·mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is comparable to the military explosive RDX (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; but isn’t put into use due to its less than favorable stability.  Melting point examination showed a sharp melting range to clear liquid at 94-95&amp;nbsp;°C, gas evolution at 155&amp;nbsp;°C, orange to brown solution discoloration at 170&amp;nbsp;°C, orange-brown solidification at 200&amp;nbsp;°C and rapid decomposition at 240&amp;nbsp;°C. The rapid decomposition at 240&amp;nbsp;°C results from the formation of elemental carbon as graphite and the formation of nitrogen gas.&lt;ref name="pubs" /&gt;

A '''digital delay generator''' (also known as '''digital-to-time converter''') is a piece of [[electronic test equipment]] that provides precise delays for triggering, syncing, delaying and gating events. These generators are used in many types of experiments, controls and processes where electronic timing of a single event or multiple events to a common timing reference is needed. The digital delay generator may initiate a sequence of events or be triggered by an event. What differentiates it from ordinary electronic timing is the synchronicity of its outputs to each other and to the initiating event.

A [[time-to-digital converter]] does the inverse function.

==Equipment==
The digital delay generator is similar to a [[pulse generator]] in function but the timing resolution is much finer and the delay and width [[jitter]] much less.

Some manufacturers, calling their units "digital delay and pulse generators", have added independent amplitude polarity and level control to each of their outputs in addition to both delay and width control. Now each channel provides its own delay, width and amplitude control, with the triggering synchronized to an external source or internal rep rate generator - like a general-purpose [[pulse generator]].

Some delay generators provide precise delays (edges) to trigger devices. Others provides precise delays and widths to also allow a gating function. Some delay generators provide a single channel of timing while others provide multiple channels of timing.

Digital delay generator outputs are typically logic level, but some offer higher voltages to cope with [[electromagnetic interference]] environments. For very harsh environments, optical outputs and/or inputs, with [[fiber optic]] connectors, are also offered as options by some manufacturers. In general, a delay generator operates in a 50&amp;nbsp;Ω transmission line environment with the line terminated in its characteristic impedance to minimize reflections and timing ambiguities.

Historically, digital delay generators were single [[Channel (communications)|channel]] devices with delay-only (see DOT reference below). Now, multi-channel units with delay and gate from each channel are the norm. Some allow referencing to other channels and combining the timing of several channels onto one for more complex, multi-triggering applications. Multiple-lasers and detectors can be triggered and gated. (see second reference on "Experimental study of laser ignition of a methane/air mixture by planar laser-induced fluorescence of OH.)" Another example has a channel pumping a laser with a user-selected number of [[flash lamp]] pulses. Another channel may be used in [[Q-switching]] that laser. A third channel can then be used to trigger and gate a data acquisition or imaging system a distinct time after the laser fires. (see sensorsportal.com reference below)

Pulse selection or pulse picking of a single laser pulse from a stream of laser pulses generated via [[mode-locking]] is another useful feature of some delay generators. By using the mode-locked rate as an external clock to the digital delay generator one may adjust a delay and width to select a single pulse and synchronize other events to that single pulse.

==Uses==
A delay generator can also be used to delay and gate high speed [[photodetector]]s in high speed imaging applications. (see reference on high speed photography below)

Digital delay generators are usually the heart of the timing for larger systems and experiments. Users generally create a GUI, [[graphical user interface]] to provide a single control to the entire system or experiment. Digital delay generator manufacturers have added remote programming schemes that facilitate the creation of such GUIs. [[Technical standard|Industry standard]]s such as [[GPIB]], [[RS232]], [[USB]] and [[ethernet]] are available from a variety of manufacturers.

Experimental [[fluid dynamics]] uses digital delay generators in its investigations of fluid flow. The field of PIV, [[particle image velocimetry]], encompasses several subsets which would use digital delay generators as the main component of its timing where multiple lasers may be triggered. Multiple channels may trigger multiple lasers. One is also able to multiplex the timing of several channels onto one channel in order to trigger or even gate the same device multiple times. A single channel may trigger a laser or gate a camera with its multiple, multiplexed pulses. Another useful setup is to have one channel drive flash lamps a preset number of times, followed by a single Q-switch, followed by a delay and gate for the data acquisition or imaging system.

Negative delay is available with digital delay generators that can select some other channel as a reference. This would be useful for applications where an event must occur in advance of the reference. An example would be to allow for the opening of a shutter prior to the reference.

A digital delay generator has been used in mass spectrometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://stoltz.caltech.edu/publications/87-2009.pdf |title=Side Chain Chemistry Mediates Backbone Fragmentation in Hydrogen Deficient Peptide Radicals |first1=Qingyu |last1=Sun |first2=Hosea |last2=Nelson |first3=Tony |last3=Ly |first4=Brian M. |last4=Stoltz |first5=Ryan R. |last5=Julian |journal=Journal of Proteome Research |date=n.d. |volume= 8|issue= |pages= 958–66|doi=10.1021/pr800592t |quote=Laser pulses were synchronized by feeding a TTL trigger signal from the mass spectrometer to the laser via a digital delay generator |pmid=19113886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multi-trigger digital delay generators==

A new development are digital delay generators that have gating and external triggering, dual or multi-trigger capabilities. The gate allows the user to enable outputs and/or triggers with an electronic signal. Some units have gate or trigger capabilities using a single or separate connectors. Dual or multi-trigger digital delay generators have several input triggers. These triggers can be selectively used to trigger any or all channels.

The multi-trigger versions have programmable logic controller type functionality for incorporating interlocks, latches, dynamic delay adjustment and trigger noise suppression. Triggers are formed by logically combining the various inputs and outputs in And, Or, Xor and Negated forms.

[[LIDAR]] applications use digital delay generators. A channel is used to trigger a laser. A second channel is used to provide a delayed gate for the [[data acquisition]] system. Gating allows regions of interest to be processed and stored while ignoring the bulk of unwanted data.

Dual-trigger digital delay generators provide two independently triggered digital delay generators in one package. Since benchtop digital delay generators are now multi-channel, it is possible to have two or more input triggers and select the channels which respond to each of the triggers. An interesting concept to provide dual-trigger capability converts an instrument that has separate trigger and gate inputs to allow the gate to operate as a second trigger.

==Design==

A key issue in the design of DDGs is to generate triggered delays having [[Crystal oscillator|crystal-oscillator]] precision but that are not quantized to the edges of the reference oscillator. There are a number of techniques used in digital delay generation.

* The simplest scheme simply uses a digital counter and a free-running crystal oscillator to time intervals with 1-clock ambiguity, resulting in output edge jitter of one clock period peak-to-peak relative to an asynchronous trigger. This technique is used in the Quantum Composers and Berkeley Nucleonics instruments.
* Triggered crystal, LC, or delay-line oscillators may be started at trigger time, and subsequently counted to make coarse delays, followed by an analog fine or "vernier" delay to interpolate between clock periods. An enhancement is to use a phase-locked loop to lock the startable oscillator to a more accurate continuous-running crystal oscillator using a technique that preserves the original trigger alignment. The classic Hewlett Packard 5359A Time Synthesizer used a triggered ECL delay-line oscillator which was synchronized to a crystal oscillator using a heterodyne phaselock technique; the technique was subsequently used in several Berkeley Nucleonics and LeCroy delay generators. Highland Technology uses a triggered LC oscillator and a DSP phaselock scheme. Jitter below 10 ps RMS relative to an external trigger can be achieved.
* It is possible to design an analog-ramp delay generator, using a current source to charge a capacitor, that spans some tens of nanoseconds of delay range. One can then suspend the ramp current for some integral number of clocks, as timed by a crystal oscillator. The freezing of the ramp extends the range of delays without the requirement to synchronize the oscillator to the trigger. This technique is described in US patent 4,968,907 and was used in the Signal Recovery instrument. Low delay jitter is possible, but leakage current becomes a serious error contributor for delays in the millisecond range.
* A flipflop-based dual-rank synchronizer can be used to synchronize an external trigger to a counter-based delay generator, as in case (1) above. It is then possible to measure the skew between the input trigger and the local clock and adjust the vernier delay, on a shot-by-shot basis, to compensate for most of the trigger-to-clock jitter. Jitter in the tens of picoseconds RMS can be achieved with careful calibration. This technique is used by Stanford Research Systems.

==History==
Diversified Project Management established its [[Boston]] office in 1989, with the mission of providing objective tenant representation, project programming, construction administration, facilities management and move coordination services. Diversified Project Management later founded its Hartford office in 1996 to better serve the Hartford, [[New Haven]] and [[Western Massachusetts]] markets.  In 2007, Diversified Project Management added its Stamford location, serving [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties in Connecticut and New York.  Diversified Project Management has since opened an office in Providence, Rhode Island.

==Industries==

===Academic===
Diversified provided move management services for the convert|170000|sqft|m2|sing=on Life Sciences Facility at [[Brown University]].  This research center houses the departments of molecular biology, cellular biology and biochemistry and neuroscience. With 60 new laboratories, the project modernized the departments and expanded laboratory and research capacity at Brown by 50 percent. It was designed to encourage scientific collaboration among faculty; staff and students by uniting complementary research under one roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://www.brown.edu/Administration/George_Street_Journal/vol28/28GSJ03a.html | title= George Street Journal: Construction and Renovation Projects Generate New Academic Space | accessdate= 2008-03-25 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060919115229/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/George_Street_Journal/vol28/28GSJ03a.html | archivedate= 2006-09-19 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate===
Diversified managed the corporate relocation project for [[CVS Caremark Corporation|CVS]] into their {{convert|217000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} Support Center Expansion space in [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island]]. The multi-phased relocation management was broken into three projects focusing on moving employees into the new space, relocation into the vacated and renovated existing space and bringing staff in from various CVS facilities in the surrounding areas. Over 1,000 staff members were moved in the process.  Along with master timeline generation and overall move management services, DPM oversaw the furniture knockdown/reconfiguration and installation of new systems.

===Healthcare===
Diversified was hired to centralize [[Partners HealthCare| Partners HealthCare's]] finance department, by consolidating seven offices into {{convert|200000|sqft|m2}} of space on two-and-a-half floors at [[Schrafft's|the Schrafft Center]], in [[Charlestown, Massachusetts]]. The project scope included programming and move management for approximately 800 people.

===High tech and industrial===
[[MRO Software]] retained Diversified for the renovation of {{convert|100000|sqft|m2}} of office space and relocation of over 300 employees in [[Bedford, Massachusetts]]. Diversified's  responsibilities included overall project management, design development coordination, general contractor selection and administration, value engineering, voice and data coordination, furniture selection and management and move planning.  Diversified acted as MRO's representative.

Diversified was retained to manage [[Acme Packet| Acme Packet's]] office and lab build out and relocation. Acme Packet relocated from their single, floor office space in Woburn to a new two-story state-of-the-art building in Burlington, where they nearly doubled in size to {{convert|43061|sqft|m2}} of space as the sole tenant. The move involved 84 staff members, 60 workstations, manufacturing areas and a test lab.

===Non-profit===
Jewish Family &amp; Children's Services
Diversified was retained to provide project management for Jewish Family &amp; Children's Services relocation to a {{convert|40000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} building in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]. The move involved 120 employees from two separate locations in Newton and Boston.

===Pharmaceutical and biotech===
[[Eisai]] Research Institute
Diversified managed the relocation for 120 employees into a{{convert|180000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} laboratory and office in [[Andover, Massachusetts]]. The project included renovating and expanding building four on the Andover campus to include more office space and the addition of an elevator and stairway.  Simultaneously, building five on the campus was demolished to make way for the construction of a new {{convert|180000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} office and laboratory building.  A connector was built between building four and the new building to facilitate easy access between the buildings for company personnel.

===Public, municipal, and state governments===
Diversified managed the relocation of the [[United States Coast Guard]] from its facility located at the [[University of Connecticut]] campus at Avery Point in [[Groton, Connecticut]]. Diversified oversaw the entire {{convert|60000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} project from the evaluation and selection of a new property to the coordination of the move into the new space.  The office facility is designed for 170 employees and 10-percent of the real estate was designed as research lab space.

The '''Ducks demo''' was a [[tech demo]] that demonstrated the capabilities of the [[PlayStation 2]] at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2000 and the [[PlayStation 3]] at E3  2005. In the PlayStation 2 demo, only one duck is shown interacting with the water in the bathtub. In the PlayStation 3 demo, there are many ducks interacting with each other and their environment, as a visual representation of the leap in processing abilities from the PlayStation 2 Sony executives promise the PlayStation 3 will deliver. The Ducks demo was the basis for ''[[Super Rub 'a' Dub]]'' which is a downloadable title for the PS3 produced by SCEE.

== The 2005 Demo ==

In the demo, [[Phil Harrison]] shows the crowd a small bathtub with some [[rubber duck]]s in it. He uses these to demonstrate the real-time water ripples and dynamics. He then uses two toy pirate ships to demonstrate cloth dynamics. To show the [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell's]] processing power, he adds a huge amount of ducks to the tub (all reacting as they would in real-life, due to the advanced physics engine). Phil comments dryly that "this is only possible with the use of [[Level of detail|LOD]] technology, for those of you that don't know, LOD stands for "Lots of Ducks"

== The EyeToy ==

Phil Harrison then invites the creator of [[EyeToy]] to show the new technology the PlayStation 3 can use. Plugging a standard PlayStation 2 EyeToy into the PlayStation 3, he picks up two ordinary cups and proceeds to move the cups in a scooping motion, which scoops up the water pictured on screen. (animated and reacting as real water would).

== Trivia ==

The ducks demo was the basis for ''[[Super Rub 'a' Dub]]'' which is a downloadable title for the PS3 produced by SCEE.

==Principle==
[[File:Electrochemical Hydrogen Compressor Theory.svg|thumb|Diagram 1. Low pressure hydrogen separates into protons and electrons at the anode and the protons are electrochemically driven across the PEM to re-combine at the cathode - producing hydrogen under pressure. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review12/pd048_lipp_2012_o.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]


A multi-stage electrochemical hydrogen compressor incorporates [[Membrane electrode assembly|membrane-electrode-assemblies]] (MEAs) separated by [[proton exchange membrane]]s (PEMs) in series to reach higher pressures, when a current is passed through the MEA protons and electrons are generated at the anode. The protons are electrochemically driven across the membrane to the cathode, after which they combine with the rerouted electrons to form hydrogen, which is fed to the hydrogen compressor to be oxidized at the anode of each cell to form [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s.

This type of compressor has no moving parts and is compact. With electrochemical compression of hydrogen a pressure of 14500 psi (1000 bar) is achieved, this world record was set by HyET from the Netherlands in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=qZ-mCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Bouwman%2C%20P.%20in%20PEM%20Electrolysis%20for%20Hydrogen%20Production%2C%20Principles%20and%20Applications%20(eds.%20Bessarabov%2C%20D.%2C%20Wang%2C%20H.%2C%20Hui%2C%20L.%20%26%20Zhao%2C%20N.)%20Chapter%2013%2C%20(2015).&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Bouwman, P. in ''PEM Electrolysis for Hydrogen Production, Principles and'']

==Applications==
[[Image:Electrochemical hydrogen compressor.jpg|left]]
Electrochemical hydrogen compressors have been proposed for use in hydrogen refueling stations to pressurize hydrogen gas for storage. They have also been applied into novel refrigeration systems to pressurize hydrogen for absorption into [[metal hydrides]] or to pressurize other working fluids (such as [[refrigerants]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xergyinc.com Xergy Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; as demonstrated by winners of the global GE's [[Ecomagination]] awards for 2011. These electrochemical compressors are noiseless, scalable, modular and highly efficient without the use of CFC's.

'''Fictional technology''' is technology that does not exist. It may be an idea or design that has not yet been developed, or it may be a fictional device used in a novel.

==Non-literary==
===Emerging technologies===
{{main|List of emerging technologies}}
Technical innovations which represent progressive developments within a field for competitive advantage.

===Exploratory engineering===
{{main|Exploratory engineering}}
Seeks to identify if a prospective [[technology]] can be designed in detail, and simulated, even if it cannot be built yet - this is often a prerequisite to [[venture capital]] funding, or investigation in weapons research.
===Propaganda===
{{main|Propaganda}}
Often emphasizes a speculative potential of a specific technology in order to stimulate investment in it, or a counter-technology. This is a common motivation in any [[society]] dominated by a [[military-industrial complex]]. ''See also [[militarism]], [[technological escalation]], [[arms race]].''
===Advertising===
{{main|Advertising}}
Emphasizes some amazing potential of some technology that is "under development" (usually without any specific timelines) by a company that is seeking simply to present itself as being competent with technology.  ''See also [[vaporware]], [[Persuasive technology|persuasion technology]].''

==In science fiction==
{{main|Technology in science fiction}}
Many works of [[science fiction]] are centered around the use of fictional future innovations and technologies and their potential uses. This can sometimes result in inventors using these fictional technologies as inspiration for real-life devices and other [[emerging technologies]].

==In fantasy==
Fantasy genres like [[steampunk]] and [[dieselpunk]] explore the consequences of more advanced technology being developed earlier in history, while not necessarily entering into the realm of science fiction. Magic powered technology, colloquially known as "magitech", is also common in fantasy media, where it can be used as a substitute for modern technology while still giving the setting a fantasy atmosphere. Well-known examples are human-created [[golem]]s and artificially levitating [[airship]]s.

[[Image:Field mill in the Chinese Qiqi tushuo, 1627.jpg|thumb|200px|The field mill in the Chinese book ''[[Qiqi Tushuo]]'' (1627), by [[Johann Schreck]] and Wang Zheng]] 
A '''field mill''', also known as a '''camp mill''', was a premodern vehicle which acted as a mobile [[gristmill|mill]] used for grinding grains, which had the very practical use of feeding a moving army.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 255"/&gt; 
==History==
===Later Zhao===
In the ''Yezhongji'' (鄴中記) ('Record of Affairs at the [[Ye, China|Capital of the Later Zhao Dynasty]]') by Lu Hui, covering the history of the [[Later Zhao]] (319&amp;ndash;351 AD) court in China, the text describes various mechanical devices used, including the wheeled [[odometer]] for measuring distance and the [[south-pointing chariot]] for indicating [[cardinal direction]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 256"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 256.&lt;/ref&gt; Two engineers in particular, the Palace Officer Xie Fei and Director of Imperial Workshops Wei Mengbian,&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 257"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 257.&lt;/ref&gt; were known for their designs and worked at the court of [[Shi Hu]] (r. 334&amp;ndash;349).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 159"/&gt; The two had crafted a four-wheeled carriage about 6 m (20 ft) long with water-spouting dragons hanging over a large golden [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhist]] statue that had a mechanical wooden statue of a [[Taoism|Daoist]] continually rubbing his front.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 159"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Other mechanical figures included ten Daoists dressed in monastic robes who continually rotated around the Buddha while periodically bowing, saluting, and throwing [[incense]] into a [[censer]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 159"/&gt; All of these mechanical figures were driven only by the movement of the carriage; once the carriage halted, the figures stopped moving and the water stopped spouting from the artificial dragons.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Xie and Wei created a similar device operated by wheel motion called the field mill, although it served a more practical purpose than the theatrical display of moving statues and water-spouting dragons.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 256&amp;ndash;257.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Yezhongji'' states that the two devised a "pounding cart" or "pounding wagon" which had figurine statues armed with real [[Trip hammer|tilt hammers]] who pounded and [[Husk|hulled]] rice only when the cart moved.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 256"/&gt; In addition to this they had a "mill cart" (field mill or camp mill) which had rotating [[millstone]]s mounted on their frames, which would rotate and grind wheat as the cart moved forward.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 256"/&gt; Just like the carriage with mechanical figures mentioned above, when the carriage stopped, the devices associated with them halted.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 257"/&gt;

===Europe===

Use of the field mill in China seems to have died out in use after the Later Zhao, since it was no longer mentioned in Chinese texts until [[Ming Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 255 &amp; 257.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Italy|Italian]] military engineer [[Pompeo Targone]], who was most notably involved in the [[Siege of La Rochelle|Siege of La Rochelle (1627-1628)]] in western [[France]], invented the field mill in Europe by 1580.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 255"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 255.&lt;/ref&gt; As shown in the Italian [[Vittorio Zonca]]'s engineering treatise of 1607, two mills mounted to a wagon are rotated by a horse whim and gearing while in a stationary position at military camp or near billets.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 255"/&gt; 

In the ''[[Yuanxi Qiqi Tushuo Luzui]]'' ('Collected Diagrams and Explanations of the Wonderful Machines of the Far West') compiled and translated in 1627 by [[Germany|German]] [[Jesuit]] [[Johann Schreck]] (1576&amp;ndash;1630) and Ming Dynasty Chinese author Wang Zheng (王徵 1571&amp;ndash;1644), a field mill is shown amongst other devices.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 255"/&gt; In this picture, two mills are operated by the gearing of a rotating bar and a whippletree harnessed to a single horse, unlike the two horses seen in Zonca's illustration.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 255 256"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 255&amp;ndash;256.&lt;/ref&gt;

The average person should have a general understanding of the part's purpose --&gt;&lt;!-- Article is unbiased, it does not give any opinion about the part, just accurate info about the part --&gt;{{Userspace draft|source=ArticleWizard|date=October 2016}}
[[File:Acer E360 Socket 939 motherboard by Foxconn.svg|thumb|A classic motherboard with on-board integrated graphics processors, a discrete graphics card can be installed at a PCI slot|alt=Acer E360 Socket 939 motherboard by Foxconn]]
&lt;!-- Article is structured nicely, however I think that you should change gaming and CAD experience to Computer's visual performance.  --&gt;'''GPU switching''' is a mechanism used on computers with multiple graphic controllers. This mechanism allows the user to either maximize the graphic performance or prolong battery life by switching between the graphic cards. It's mostly used on gaming laptops which usually have an [[Graphics processing unit#Integrated graphics|integrated graphic device]] and a [[Graphics processing unit#Dedicated graphics cards|discrete video card]]. &lt;!-- All main ideas are there, Layout and organization flows throughout the article --&gt;

==  Basic components&lt;!-- Not too wordy, sentences are all precise and get to the point without adding any filler --&gt; ==
Most computers using this feature contain integrated graphics processors and dedicated graphics cards that applies to the following categories.

=== Integrated graphics&lt;!-- Things are explained very well, the average person should be able to follow along. Computer terms are all hyperlinked which is good --&gt; ===
Also known as: ''Integrated graphics'', ''shared graphics solutions'', ''integrated graphics processors'' (IGP) or ''unified memory architecture'' (UMA). This kind of graphics processors usually have much fewer processing units and share the same memory with the [[Central processing unit|CPU]].[[File:Intel core i5-2500 top IMGP9336 wp.jpg|thumb|Intel Core i5 processor with integrated HD Graphics 2000|175x175px]]
Sometimes the graphics processors are integrated onto a motherboard. It is commonly known as: ''on-board graphics.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-dedicated-graphics-and-shared-graphics|title=What is the difference between dedicated graphics and shared graphics? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A motherboard with on-board graphics processors doesn't require a discrete graphics card or a [[Central processing unit|CPU]] with graphics processors to operate.

=== Dedicated graphics cards ===
Also known as: ''discrete graphics cards''. Unlike integrated graphics, dedicated graphics cards have much more processing units and have its own [[Random-access memory|RAM]] with much higher memory bandwidth.

In some cases, a dedicated graphics chip can be integrated onto the [[motherboard]]s, B150-GP104 for example. Regardless of the fact that the graphics chip is integrated, it is still counted as a dedicated graphics cards system because the graphics chip is integrated with its own memory.

== Theory ==
[[File:Motherboard diagram.svg|thumb|Motherboard diagram|392x392px]]

=== Northbridge control ===
Most computers have a motherboard that uses a [[Southbridge (computing)|Southbridge]] and [[Northbridge (computing)|Northbridge]] structure. The [[Northbridge (computing)|Northbridge]] is one of the core logic [[chipset]] that handles communications among the [[Central processing unit|CPU]], [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]], [[Random-access memory|RAM]] and the Southbridge. The discrete graphics card is usually installed onto the graphics card slot and the integrated graphics is integrated onto the CPU or occasionally onto the Northbridge. The Northbridge is the most responsible for switching between GPUs. The way how it works usually has the following process:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/n/northbri.htm|title=What is northbridge?|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/n/northbri.htm|title=What is northbridge?|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/motherboard.htm|title=How Motherboards Work|date=2005-07-20|newspaper=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# The Northbridge receives input from Southbridge through the [[Bus (computing)#Internal buses|internal bus]]. 
# The Northbridge passes down the input to CPU through the Front-side bus. 
# The CPU runs the task assignment application (usually the graphics card driver) to determine which GPU core to use. 
# The CPU passes down the command to the Northbridge. 
# The Northbridge passes down the command to the according GPU core. 
# The GPU core processes the command and returns the rendered data back to the Northbridge. 
# The Northbridge sends the rendered data back to Southbridge.

=== Southbridge control ===
The Southbridge is also named as [[I/O Controller Hub]] (ICH). It handles all of a computer's I/O functions, such as receiving the keyboard input and outputting the data onto the screen. The way how it usually works usually has two steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/soutbrid.htm|title=What is southbridge?|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Take in the user input and pass it down to the Northbridge.
# (Optional) Receive the rendered data from the Northbridge and output it.
The reason why the second step can be optional is that sometimes the rendered the data is outputted directly from the discrete graphics card which is located on the graphics card slot so there is no need to output the data through the Southbridge.

== Main purpose&lt;!-- Shows knowledge about the topic by giving a comparison and stats of the different products.  --&gt; ==
GPU switching is mostly used for saving energy by switching between graphic cards. The dedicated graphics cards consume much more power than integrated graphics but also provides higher 3D performances, which is needed for a better gaming and CAD experience. Following is a list of the [[Thermal design power|TDPs]] of the most popular CPU with integrated graphics and dedicated graphics cards.

The dedicated graphics cards exhibit much higher power consumption than the integrated graphics on both platforms. Disabling them when no heavy graphics processing is needed can significantly lower the power consumption.

[[File:Rendering Process.png|thumb|A classic graphic rendering process with multiple GPU cores]]

=== Nvidia Optimus ===
Nvidia Optimus™ is a computer GPU switching technology created by [[Nvidia]] that can dynamically and seamlessly switch between two graphic cards based on running programs.

=== AMD Enduro ===
AMD Enduro™ is a collective brand developed by AMD that features many new technologies that can significantly save power. It was previously named as: ''PowerXpress'' and ''Dynamic Switchable Graphics (DSG).'' This technology implements a sophisticated system to predict the potential usage need for graphics cards and switch between graphics cards based on predicted need. This technology also introduces a new power control plan that allows the discrete graphics cards consume no energy when idling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amd.com/en-us/innovations/software-technologies/processors-for-business/enduro|title=Enduro™ Power Management Technologies {{!}} AMD|website=www.amd.com|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gunpowder Incident''' (or '''Gunpowder Affair''') was a conflict early in the [[American Revolutionary War]] between [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], the Royal Governor of the [[Colony of Virginia]], and [[militia]] led by [[Patrick Henry]]. On April 20, 1775, one day after the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] (and well before news of that event reached Virginia), Lord Dunmore ordered the removal of the [[gunpowder]] from the [[gunpowder magazine|magazine]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] to a [[Royal Navy]] ship.

This action sparked local unrest, and militia companies began mustering throughout the colony.  [[Patrick Henry]] led a small militia force toward Williamsburg to force return of the gunpowder to the colony's control.  The matter was resolved without conflict when a payment of [[Pound sterling|£]]330 was made to Henry.  Dunmore, fearing for his personal safety, later retreated to a naval vessel, ending royal control of the colony.

==Background==
Military tensions began to rise in the [[Thirteen Colonies|British colonies of North America]] in 1774 when a series of legislative acts by the British Parliament known as the [[Intolerable Acts]] began to be implemented in the colonies.  The colonies, in solidarity with the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], which had been singled out for punishment by those acts in the wake of the [[Boston Tea Party]], had organized a Congress to meet in September 1774.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;  During the meeting of the [[First Continental Congress]] word arrived of a militia uprising in Massachusetts that became known as the [[Powder Alarm]].  In early September, General [[Thomas Gage]], the royal governor of Massachusetts, had removed gunpowder from a powder magazine in [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] (in a location now in [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]]), and militia from all over [[New England]] had flocked to the area in response to false rumors that violence had been involved.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=R48&gt;Russell, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  One consequence of this action was that the Congress called for the colonies to organize militia companies for their defense.&lt;ref name=R48/&gt;  Another was that [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth|Lord Dartmouth]], the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], advised the colonial governors to secure their military supplies, and prohibited importation of further supplies of powder.&lt;ref name=SH1/&gt;

In early 1775, Virginians began to organize militia companies and seek out military supplies (weapons, ammunition, and gunpowder) to arm and equip them.  [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]]'s royal governor, saw this rising unrest in his colony and sought to deprive Virginia militia of these supplies.&lt;ref name=SH1&gt;Selby and Higginbotham, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not until after [[Patrick Henry]]'s "[[Give me liberty or give me death]]" speech at the [[Second Virginia Convention]] on March 23 that Dunmore "[thought] it prudent to remove some Gunpowder which was in a Magazine in this place."&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;  Although British Army troops had been withdrawn from Virginia in the wake of the Powder Alarm, there were several Royal Navy ships in the Virginia waters of [[Chesapeake Bay]].  On April 19, Lord Dunmore quietly brought a company of British sailors into [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] and quartered them in the governor's mansion.  Dunmore then ordered Captain [[Henry Collins (Royal Navy officer)|Henry Collins]], commander of [[HMS Magdalen|HMS ''Magdalen'']], to remove the gunpowder from the magazine in Williamsburg.&lt;ref name=R52/&gt;

==Removing the gunpowder==
[[File:Williamsburg magazine drawing exterior.gif|thumb|right|Drawing of the octagonal Williamsburg Magazine]]&lt;!--this illustration seems redundant, as it does not date from the 18th century, and there is a photo of the same building in this article--&gt;
On the night of April 20, Royal Navy sailors went to the Williamsburg powder magazine, loaded fifteen half barrels of powder into the governor's wagon, and transported it to the eastern end of the [[Quarterpath Road]] to be loaded aboard the ''Magdalen'' in the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]].  The act was discovered by townsfolk while underway, and they sounded an alarm. Local militia rallied to the scene, and riders spread word of the incident across the colony.  Dunmore had as a precaution armed his servants with muskets, and it was only the calming words of Patriot leaders, including the Speaker of the [[Virginia House of Burgesses|House of Burgesses]], [[Peyton Randolph]], that prevented the assembling crowd from storming Dunmore's mansion.&lt;ref name=R52&gt;Russell, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  The city council demanded the return of the powder, claiming it was the property of the colony and not [[the Crown]].  Dunmore demurred, stating that he was moving the powder as protection against its seizure during a rumored slave uprising, and would eventually return it.  This seemed to satisfy the assembled crowd, and it dispersed peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;Selby and Higginbotham, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Unrest however persisted in Williamsburg and spread throughout the countryside.  After a second crowd was convinced to disperse by Patriot leaders, Dunmore reacted angrily, warning on April 22 that if attacked, he would "declare Freedom to the Slaves, and reduce the City of Williamsburg to Ashes."&lt;ref name=R52/&gt; He also told a Williamsburg [[alderman]] that he had "once fought for the Virginians" but "By God, I would let them see that I could fight against them."&lt;ref&gt;Selby and Higginbotham, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Patrick henry.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.5|[[Patrick Henry]], portrait by George Bagby Matthews c. 1891 after an original by [[Thomas Sully]]]]
By April 29, militia mobilizing in the countryside had learned of the battles at Lexington and Concord.  Nearly 700 men mustered at [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]], and decided to send a messenger to Williamsburg to assess the situation before marching on the capital.  Peyton Randolph advised against violence, and [[George Washington]], a longtime leader of the Virginia militia, concurred.  In response to their advice, the Fredericksburg militia voted by a narrow margin not to march.&lt;ref name=R53&gt;Russell, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  However, militia from other parts of the colony did march to Williamsburg.  The [[Hanover County, Virginia|Hanover County]] militia, led by Patrick Henry, voted on May 2 to march on Williamsburg.  Henry dispatched a small company to the home of Richard Corbin, who was the Deputy Collector of the Royal Revenue in Virginia, in a bid to force him to pay for the powder from Crown revenue in his possession;  the remainder of the Hanover County militia, numbering about 150, marched toward Williamsburg, arriving about {{convert|15|mi|km}} away on May 3.&lt;ref name=SB4/&gt;  That day Dunmore's family escaped Williamsburg to [[Porto Bello (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Porto Bello]], Lord Dunmore's hunting lodge on the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]], and from there to {{HMS|Fowey|1749|6}}, lying at anchor in the York River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Numerous Errors in Wilstach's 'Tidewater Virginia' Challenge Criticism |last= Kibler |first=J.

Corbin was not at home&amp;mdash;he was in Williamsburg, meeting with Dunmore.&lt;ref name=SB4&gt;Selby and Higginbotham, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Henry was advised by [[Carter Braxton]], Corbin's son-in-law and a Patriot member of the House of Burgesses, not to enter the city, while Braxton rode into the city and negotiated a payment.&lt;ref name=SB5/&gt;  The next day, May 4, Henry received a [[bill of exchange]] for £330 signed by a wealthy plantation owner, as payment for the powder (he refused the offer of payment from Crown accounts).&lt;ref name=R53/&gt;  Henry then departed to take his place as a member of Virginia's delegation to the [[Second Continental Congress]], promising to deliver the money to "the Virginia Delegates at the General congress".&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 6 Dunmore issued a proclamation charging Henry with extortion of the £330, and forbidding the citizenry to assist Henry in any way.&lt;ref name=R53/&gt;  Henry was offered protection by several counties, and was escorted by several companies of militia to the Maryland border as he made his way to [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=SB5&gt;Selby and Higginbotham, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Sir Joshua Reynolds - John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|Portrait of Dunmore by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]], 1765]]
The incident burnished Henry's reputation while worsening Dunmore's popularity.&lt;ref name=SB5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;  Although his family briefly returned to Williamsburg on May 12 as a sign of good faith, relations between Dunmore and the House of Burgesses continued to deteriorate.  On June 8, Dunmore and his family fled the [[Governor's Palace (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Governor's Palace]] in the middle of the night and took up residence aboard ''Fowey''.&lt;ref&gt;Selby and Higginbotham, pp. 41–43&lt;/ref&gt;  The Burgesses had been deliberating the [[Conciliatory Resolution]], a proposal that was an attempt by the [[North Ministry]] to divide the colonies.  In the wake of Dunmore's flight, the Burgesses rejected the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Selby and Higginbotham, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunmore continued to make vigorous attempts to regain control of the colony, but after a decisive defeat of British forces [[Battle of Great Bridge|at Great Bridge]] in December, he was reduced to raiding operations and eventually abandoned the colony for good in August 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 68–76&lt;/ref&gt;  Virginia's government was first taken over by a [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]], chosen by the [[Third Virginia Convention]] in July 1775; Patrick Henry became the independent state's first [[Governor of Virginia|governor]] in July 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Selby and Higginbotham, pp. 52,121&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hazchem''' (hazardous chemicals)({{IPAc-en|'|h|æ|z|k|ɛ|m}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|Hazchem}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a warning plate system used in [[Australia]], [[Malaysia]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]] and the [[United Kingdom]] for vehicles transporting [[dangerous goods|hazardous substances]], and on storage facilities. The top-left section of the plate gives the Emergency Action Code (EAC) telling the [[fire brigade]] what actions to take if there's an accident or fire. The middle-left section containing a 4 digit number gives the [[UN number|UN Substance Identification Number]] describing the material. The lower-left section gives the telephone number that should be called if special advice is needed. The warning symbol in the top right indicates the general hazard class of the material. The bottom-right of the plate carries a company [[logo]] or name.

There is also a standard null Hazchem plate to indicate the transport of non-hazardous substances. The null plate does not include an EAC or substance identification.

The [[National Chemical Emergency Centre]] (NCEC) in the United Kingdom provides a Free Online Hazchem Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.the-ncec.com/free-online-hazmat-hazchem-guide |title=Free Online Hazchem Guide |access-date=2013-08-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512065348/http://the-ncec.com/free-online-hazmat-hazchem-guide |archive-date=2014-05-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergency Action Code ==
The Emergency Action Code (EAC) is a three character code displayed on all dangerous goods classed carriers, and provides a quick assessment to first responders and emergency responders (i.e. [[fire fighter]]s and [[police]]) of what actions to take should the carrier carrying such goods become involved in an incident (traffic collision, for example). EAC's are characterised by a single number (1 to 4) and either one or two letters (depending on the hazard).

NCEC was commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) to edit the EAC List 2013 publication, outlining the application of Hazchem Emergency Actions Codes (EACs) in Britain for 2013.  The Dangerous Goods Emergency Action Code (EAC) List is reviewed every two years and is an essential compliance document for all emergency services, local government and for those who may control the planning for, and prevention of, emergencies involving dangerous goods. The current EAC List is 20013. NCEC has been at the heart of the UK EAC system since its inception in the early 1970s, publishing the list on behalf of the UK Government until 1996 and resuming its management in 2008.

The printed version of the book can be purchased from TSO directly ({{ISBN|9780117541184}}) or downloaded as a [https://d18hkfaesybon0.cloudfront.net/ncec/media/assets/downloads/ncec-emergency-action-code-list-2017.pdf PDF file] from NCEC’s website.

=== HazChem fire suppression ===
{| class="wikitable" "border="1" float="right"
|Number
|Action
|-
| '''1'''
| coarse spray 
|-
| '''2'''
| fog&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| '''3'''
| foam
|-
| '''4'''
| dry agent&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|}
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;small&gt;In the absence of fog equipment, a fine spray may be used.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="nswrfsfpr"&gt;NSW Rural Fire Service Firefighters' Pocket Book pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;small&gt;Water must not be allowed to come into contact with the substance at risk.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="nswrfsfpr"/&gt;

This number is indicative of what type of [[fire suppressant]] should be used to suppress a fire from igniting or extinguish a fire caused by the chemical. The system is designed to rank fire suppression methods in order of usability.&lt;ref name="suppressionrank" /&gt; For example, a chemical marked with the number '''2''' or '''Fog''' can be attacked with methods '''3''' (Foam) or '''4''' (Dry Agent) but not with '''1''' (Jets).&lt;ref name="suppressionrank"&gt;SafeWork SA (2000) ''Safeguards''. Retrieved 2010-10-03 from http://www.safework.sa.gov.au/uploaded_files/ds9i.pdf. (page 1: ''The system permits a medium of a higher numeric classification to be used than that indicated, however, a medium with a lower numeric classification than that indicated should not be used.'')&lt;/ref&gt; The "Dry Agent" method must be used for chemicals that have an undesirable reaction with water and must not be allowed to come in contact with water, therefore '''4''' is the highest ranking suppression method as all of the other methods use water.

=== HazChem safety parameters ===
Each EAC contains at least one letter, which determines which category the chemical falls under, and which also highlights the violence of the chemical (i.e. likelihood to spontaneously combust, explode etc.), what [[personal protective equipment]] to use while working around the chemical and what action to take when disposing of the chemical.

[[File:Hazchem3yediff.jpg|thumb|right|Comparison denoting the difference between [[Personal Protective Equipment|PPE]] deployment with 3YE chemicals]]
Each category is assigned a letter to determine what actions are required when handling, containing and disposing of the chemical in question. Eight 'major categories' exist which are commonly denoted by a black letter on a white background. Four subcategories exist which specifically deal with what type of personal protective equipment responders must wear when handling the emergency, denoted by a white letter on a black background. In Australia with the update of the [[Australian Dangerous Goods Code]] volume 7 as of 2010, the white letter on a black background has been removed, making BA a requirement at all large incidents regardless of whether the substance is involved in a fire.

If a category is classed as violent, this means that the chemical can be violently or explosively reactive,&lt;ref name="nswrfsfpr"/&gt; either with the atmosphere or water, or both (which could be marked by the [[HAZMAT Class 4 Flammable Solids|Dangerous when Wet]] symbol).

Protection is divided up into three categories of personal protective equipment, ''Full'', ''BA'' and ''BA for fire only''. Full denotes that full personal protective equipment provisions must be used around and in contact with the chemical, which will usually include a portable [[Self-contained breathing apparatus|breathing apparatus]] and water tight and chemical proof suit. ''BA'' (acronym for breathing apparatus) specifies that a portable breathing apparatus must be used at all times in and around the chemical, and ''BA for fire only'' specifies that a breathing apparatus is not necessary for short exposure periods to the chemical but is required if the chemical is on alight. ''BA for fire only'' is denoted within the emergency action code as a white letter on a black background, while a black letter on a white background denotes breathing apparatus at all times. &lt;ins&gt;When changing the background colour is not possible (such as with handwriting), the use of brackets means the same as a black background. "3[Y]E" means the same as a white letter on a black background.&lt;/ins&gt;

Substance control specifies what to do with the chemical in the event of a spill, either ''dilute'' or ''contain''. Dilute means that the chemical may be washed down the drain with large quantities of water. ''Contain'' requires that the spillage must not come in contact with drains or water courses.

In the event of a chemical incident, the EAC may specify that an evacuation may be necessary as the chemical poses a public hazard which may extend beyond the immediate vicinity. If evacuation is not possible, advice to stay in doors and secure all points of ventilation may be necessary. This condition is denoted by an '''E''' at the end of any emergency action code. It is an optional letter, depending on the nature of the chemical.

=== Examples ===
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|'''3'''||align="center"|'''Y'''||'''E'''||Use foam or dry agent, substance reacts violently/is explosive, BA use is essential, evacuate vicinity, contain spill.
|-
|'''3''' ||align="center" style="background: #000000; color: #FFFFFF;"|'''Y'''||'''E'''||Use foam or dry agent, substance reacts violently/is explosive, Use BA if fire present, evacuate vicinity, contain spill.
|-
|'''2'''||colspan="2"|'''R'''||Use fog, foam or dry agent, substance is not violent, use full [[Personal Protective Equipment|PPE]], dilute spill.
|-
|'''4'''||colspan="2"|'''X'''||Use dry agent only, substance is not violent, full [[Personal Protective Equipment|PPE]] essential, contain spill.
|-
|'''1'''||align="center" style="background: #000000; color: #FFFFFF;"|'''S'''||'''E'''||Use jets, fog, foam or dry agent; BA for fire only; evacuate vicinity; dilute spill.
|}

A very commonly displayed example is '''3YE''' on [[petrol]] [[tank truck|tankers]]. This means that a fire must be fought using foam or dry agent (if a small fire), that it can react violently and is explosive, that fire fighters must wear a portable breathing apparatus at all times, or if a white on black Y, only if there is a fire, and that the run-off needs to be contained. It also indicates to the [[Incident Command System|incident controller]] that evacuation of the surrounding area may be necessary.

=== Calculation of Hazchem action code for multi-loads or sites with multiple Hazchem codes ===

Example:&lt;ref&gt;Australian Dangerous Goods Code, 7th Edition, Section C2.7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://jr.chemwatch.net/help/goldffx/Repository/GoldFFX%20Help.html?HazchemCodeCalculationforMoreSub.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-20 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150120091347/http://jr.chemwatch.net/help/goldffx/Repository/GoldFFX%20Help.html?HazchemCodeCalculationforMoreSub.html |archive-date=2015-01-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three substances to be carried as a multi-load, having emergency action codes of 3Y, •2S and 4WE.

'''1st Character (Number):'''
The first character of the EAC for each of the three substances is 3, 2 and 4. The highest number must be taken as the first character of the code for the multi-load and therefore the first character will be 4. The bullet in •2S is not assigned to the mixed load because other EACs do not include a bullet.

'''2nd Character (Letter):'''
The second character for the EAC for each of the three substances is Y, S and W. Taking the Y along the top row of the chart and the S along the left hand column, the intersection is at Y and therefore the character for the first two substances would be Y. This resultant character (Y) is then taken along the top row and the character for the third substance (W) is taken along the left hand column. The intersection point is now W. The second character of the code for the three substances is therefore W.

'''Letter ‘E’:'''
The third substance has an ‘E’ as a third character and therefore the multi-load must also have an ‘E’.

The resultant Hazchem Code for the three substances carried as a multi-load will therefore be 4WE.

'''Holly Brockwell''', born {{birth date and age|1985|12|13}}&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/holly/status/979126623399301120&lt;/ref&gt; is an English [[Technology journalism|technology journalist]], [[Copywriting|copywriter]] and the founder of the tech site ''Gadgette''. She has also written columns for ''[[Gizmodo]]'', the [[BBC]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' and other media outlets.

== Early life ==
Brockwell is from [[Nottingham]]&lt;ref name=Notts&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/scottish-referendum-tweet-nottingham-resident/story-22952712-detail/story.html |title=Scottish referendum: How a tweet from a Nottingham resident took the Twittersphere by storm |date=2014-09-19 |newspaper=[[Nottingham Post]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210112425/http://www.nottinghampost.com/scottish-referendum-tweet-nottingham-resident/story-22952712-detail/story.html |archivedate=2014-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and currently lives in London. She originally hoped to study computer science at university, but instead took a degree in English and became an advertising copywriter and an assistant reviewer and then an editor at ''ShinyShiny'', a women's technology website.&lt;ref name=Look&gt;{{cite news |author=zroll |url=http://www.look.co.uk/list-for-life/people/what-its-like-to-be-a-woman-in-tech-media-11367 |title='What it’s like to be a tech journalist' |type=interview |newspaper=[[Look (UK magazine)|Look]] |date=2015-12-09 |accessdate=2017-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== NHS sterilization denial ==
In 2012 Brockwell requested the ability to be [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilized]] from the United Kingdom's [[National Health Service]]. She was denied due to her age,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34521525 |title=100 Women 2015: Desperate not to have children |date=2015-11-22|work=Magazine |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=2017-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which according to the NHS is common practice because surgeons prefer to wait until prospective patients are at least 30 years of age and have had children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception-guide/pages/female-sterilisation.aspx#Who|title=Female sterilisation - Contraception guide |website=NHS Choices |publisher=National Health Service |access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of March 2016, after turning 30, she was granted permission for the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Holly |last=Blott |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3513800/Holly-Brockwell-reveals-happiness-wins-four-year-battle-sterilised-Morning.html |title=Woman, 30, defends being sterilised after winning four year battle with NHS |newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]] |date=2016-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blogging and ''Gadgette'' ==
In 2012 Brockwell blogged about an advertising agency and its campaign about benefit schemes for their staff &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Holly |last=Brockwell |url=https://hollybrockwell.com/2012/09/05/ad-agency-laughs-at-people-on-benefits/|title=Ad agency laughs at people on benefits |website=HollyBrockwell.com |date=2012-09-05 |publisher=|accessdate=2017-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which sparked controversy and negative publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decisionmarketing.co.uk/news/iris-faces-uproar-over-chav-parody|title=Iris faces uproar over 'chav' parody |publisher=Decision Marketing |date=2012-09-07 |accessdate=2017-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency accused Brockwell of libel but later apologised.

The next year Brockwell sparked controversy again after writing about a 2013 [[Hyundai]] advert that was later withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Emily |last=Dugan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/advertising/hyundai-pulls-viral-zero-emission-car-ad-featuring-man-attempting-suicide-8588650.html |title=Hyundai pulls viral zero emission car ad featuring man attempting suicide |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=2013-04-25 |accessdate=2017-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Brockwell started her own women’s tech site called ''Gadgette'' in order to tackle the apparent condescending and discriminating attitudes towards women in the technology industry. The launch of the website faced backlash, according to an op-ed by Brockwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Holly |last=Brockwell |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/jul/22/sexism-tech-industry-womens-site |title=I've been viciously attacked for daring to start a women's tech site |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |type=opinion |date=2015-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2017 she was the first journalist hired by [[Jimmy Wales]] for his new commercial news venture, [[Wikitribune]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kitty |last=Knowles |url=https://www.thememo.com/2017/07/07/wikitribune-inside-the-media-mashup-waging-war-on-fake-news/ |title=WikiTribune: Inside the media mashup waging war on fake news |website=The Memo |date=2017-07-07 |accessdate=2017-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her last day with that publication was November 17, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Brockwell, Holly.

The '''Institute of Quarrying''' is the international professional body for [[quarrying]], construction materials and the related extractive and processing industries. The Institute's long-term objective is to promote progressive improvements in all aspects of operational performance of the extractives industry through education and training. The Institute has been supporting the extractives industry and associated sectors since 1917.

==History==
The Institute was founded on 19 October 1917 from a meeting of “The Association of Quarry Managers” in [[Caernarfon]] in [[North Wales]]. Gradually expanding over the years, IQ now has affiliate organisations in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Malaysia]], Southern Africa and [[Hong Kong]].

In September 2012 the Institute moved to its new premises at McPherson House, named after its founder Simon McPherson, in [[Chilwell]], [[Nottingham]].

==Structure==
The largest membership group remains in the UK, where the Institute was founded in 1917. Australia constitutes the largest group in the Pacific region and close ties are maintained with their neighbours in New Zealand and Malaysia. To the north, members are based in Hong Kong, operating both in the territory and China. The Institute's activities in [[Southern Africa]] are centred on South Africa which provides support for members in other countries of the region.

===UK===
It has thirteen regional branches in the UK.

===International===
* The Institute of Quarrying Australia
* The Institute of Quarrying New Zealand
* The Institute of Quarrying Hong Kong
* The Institute of Quarrying Southern Africa
* The Institute of Quarrying Malaysia

==Function==
It regulates the quarrying industry, providing training and consultation for standards in the industry, similar to other engineering professional bodies.

The '''Jayrun Water Clock''', a [[water clock]] built by the [[List of inventions in the medieval Islamic world|Muslim engineer]] Muhammad al-Sa'ati, was positioned at the gate of [[Damascus]], [[Syria]], at the exit of the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in the 12th century during the reign of [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]].&lt;ref name="hill"&gt;Hill, Donald Routledge. "A History of Engineering in Classical and Medieval Times", p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
There is a full description of the clock in the treatise ''Ktab 'Amal al-sa'at wa-l-amal biha'' (''On the Construction of Clocks and their Use'') written by Ridwan b. al Saati in 1203. This treatise describes the reconstruction by Ridwan of the water clock which was built by his father, Muhammad al-Saati, in the reign of Nur al-Din Mahmud b. Zanki in Damascus (reigned 1154–74). "The clock-face consisted of wall of timber about 4.23 metres wide and 2.78 metres high. In this screen was a row of doors, at either end of which was the figure of a falcon. During the day a small crescent moved at constant speed in front of the doors and at every hour a door rotated to reveal a different colour, the falcons leant forward, discharged pellets on to cymbals and resumed their upright positions. Above the doors a zodiac circle rotated at constant speed. Above this was a semicircle of twelve circular holes. During the night one of these holes became fully illuminated every hour. The clock was operated by the "Archimedes" water machinery and the motion transmitted to the activating mechanisms by pulley and rope systems."&lt;ref&gt;The summary of the description by Ridwan b. al-Saati is from A.F.L. Beeston a.o. ''The Cambridge History of Arabic Literature'', p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Arabic Mechanical Engineering: Survey of the Historical Sources|author=[[Donald Routledge Hill]]|journal=[[Arabic Sciences and Philosophy: A Historical Journal]]|year=1991|volume=1|pages=167–186 [174]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|doi=10.1017/S0957423900001478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repairs==
In 1203, al-Sa'ati's son Ridwan wrote a treatise on how he had been tasked to repair the clock his father had built, after others had failed.

==Reconstruction==
A full-size reconstruction of the clock can be seen in the Nationaal Beiaard- en Natuurmuseum Asten in the Netherlands.

'''Nitin Pradhan''' ({{lang-hi|नितिन प्रधान}};) was the Departmental [[Chief Information Officer]] (CIO) for the [[US Department of Transportation]] (DOT) as part of the [[Obama Administration]] from July 6, 2009 to August 31, 2012. After leaving US DOT, Pradhan established and led the nation's first Federal Technology Accelerator and Partner Consortium called Public Private Innovations&lt;ref name="Meritalk Article"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meritalk.com/blog.php?user=SteveOKeeffe&amp;blogentry_id=3317/|title=Steve O'Keeffe's blog - MeriTalk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later cofounded GOVonomy, an emerging products technology marketplace for the public sector as well as ScaleUP USA, a Digital Business Growth Accelerator.&lt;ref name="Information Week Article 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/government/leadership/5-habits-of-highly-effective-government/240158432/|title=5 Habits Of Highly Effective Government IT Leaders|work=InformationWeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/launchdream/the-reason-why-everyone-love-scaleup-usas-digital-growth-accelerator-9a5a0e02719d|title=The Reason Why Everyone Love ScaleUP USA Digital Business Growth Accelerator.|last=Pradhan|first=Nitin|date=2017-09-05|website=Medium|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to joining DOT, Pradhan was an IT Executive at [[Fairfax County Public Schools]] (FCPS), the 12th largest school district in the USA. Earlier, Pradhan was the Managing Director of Virginia’s Center for Innovative Technology (CIT).&lt;ref name="CIT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cit.org/|title=Center for Innovative Technology Main Home Page - Center for Innovative Technology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the co-founder and former CEO of a wireless startup.

== Early life and education ==

Born and brought up in [[Pune]], India, Pradhan attended [[Loyola High School (Pune)]]. After high school, Pradhan attended the Faculty of Technology and Engineering, [[Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda]] (MSU), India where he completed his bachelor's degree in engineering. He followed this degree with master's in marketing management from [[Institute of Management Development and Research, Pune]], India. Pradhan came to [[Washington, DC]] on a graduate fellowship from the [[Kogod School of Business]] at The [[American University]] (AU), to study for his second master's degree in accounting.

== IT philosophy ==

Pradhan’s IT philosophy focuses on people first, innovation, agility and driving business value. He believes that technology is first about people. Technology based Innovation is his second theme. He believes that [[Chief Information Officer]]s (CIOs) have a dual role to play as [[Chief Innovation Officer]]s. This aspect focuses on creating an innovation life cycle within organizations consisting of [[Ideation (idea generation)|ideation]] and crowd sourcing tools like DOT’s IdeaHub,&lt;ref name="DOT IdeaHub"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cio.gov/making-the-web-work-for-dot-ideahub/|title=Making the Web Work for DOT: IdeaHub - CIO Council|work=CIO Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; a process for selection of best ideas, a cloud based agility platform for quick deployment of “apps” that drive business value, an Amazon.com-like IT business catalogue, with a one-stop shop for basic, premium, and fee-for-service IT offerings,&lt;ref name="IT Reform"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cio.gov/it-reform-task-force-will-drive-data-center-closures/|title=IT Reform: Task Force Will Drive Data Center Closures - CIO Council|work=CIO Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an IT Vital Signs dashboard that measures progress.&lt;ref name="IT Vital"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cio.gov/it-vital-signs/|title=IT Vital Signs - CIO Council|work=CIO Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, he has promoted the concept of new IT—IT 2.0,&lt;ref name="CIO role"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cio.gov/the-changing-role-of-the-cio/|title=The Changing Role of the CIO - CIO Council|work=CIO Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he calls it, is based on immediately providing significant [[public value]] and [[business value]], and Everything as a Service (EAAS).&lt;ref name="GSA EaaS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fcw.com/articles/2012/07/26/gsa-kevin-page-everything-as-a-service.aspx/|title=GSA looks to cloud for pretty much everything -- FCW|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a strong proponent of using technology to deliver business results, for example; using emerging innovations like [[Intelligent Transportation Systems]] and DOT’s Connected Vehicles Program&lt;ref name="IT solutions"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cio.gov/it-solutions-connected-vehicle-technology/|title=IT Solutions – Connected Vehicle Technology - CIO Council|work=CIO Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed to leverage [[vehicle-to-vehicle]] (V2V), [[driverless car]]s, and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) [[wireless communication]] in order to make driving safer by making cars, trucks, buses and other vehicles aware of the vehicles around them, even if the drivers aren't.&lt;ref name="DataQuest"&gt;[http://archive.dqindia.com/content/cio_handbook12/2012/112032706.asp "Dataquest CIO Handbook 2012, Dataquest Magazine Interview"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oyster Fly Rods''' is a [[bamboo]] [[fly rod]] making business in [[Blue Ridge, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl W. Ritzler [http://www.ajc.com/hotjobs/content/hotjobs/careercenter/articles/2007_0401_loveflyfish.html Why I love my job: Bill Oyster, maker of bamboo fly rods] Atlanta Journal Constitution&lt;/ref&gt; It belongs to famous fly fisherman Bill Oyster,&lt;ref name="famous"/&gt; who makes "every one" of the forty custom rods produced each year by hand, as well as a few standardized rods. He described the process as: "I split each twelve-foot length of cane into six strips... Then, depending on the length, number of pieces, and action wanted, I plane each strip of cane to thousandths of an inch. I also engrave all the nickel and silver hardware, which takes as long as the actual creation of the rod." The rods have fast action, include distinctive engravings, "elegant" [[rattan]] grips, and are "remarkably fishable". Oyster Fly Rods was a winner in the "Sporting" category of ''[[Garden &amp; Gun]]'' magazine's "Made in the South" 2010 competition.&lt;ref&gt;Haskell Harris and Donovan Webster [http://gardenandgun.com/galleries/photos/made-south-award-winners-2010 Made in the South] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124191736/http://gardenandgun.com/galleries/photos/made-south-award-winners-2010 |date=2011-11-24 }} page 9 Dec 10/Jan 11 Garden &amp; Gun&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Oyster moved the business from [[Gainesville, Georgia]] to Blue Ridge in 2009. He has fished around the U.S. and in Argentina. The custom rods sell for as much as $10,000 each and "at least a couple have gone into the hands of former President [[Jimmy Carter]]." Oyster also offers rod making classes.&lt;ref name="famous"&gt;Joe Tennis [http://www2.tricities.com/entertainment/2011/oct/06/t-ar-1362155/ Tennis Anyone?; Bill Oyster is nationally known for his custom fishing rods] October 06, 2011 TriCities&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's main product line is its proprietary Content Recommendation and In-Content and [[Native advertising]] Server, which is designed for digital publishers.

The PowerLinks Ad Server is intended to automate and enhance the administration of content recommendation and In-feed and In-Content advertising inventory management for publishers.

A '''process variable''', '''process value''' or '''process parameter''' is the current measured value of a particular part of a process which is being monitored or controlled. An example of this would be the temperature of a furnace. The current temperature is called the process variable, while the desired temperature is known as the [[setpoint (control system)|set-point]]. The set point is usually abbreviated to SP, and the process value is usually abbreviated to PV.

==Control system use==
[[File:Set-point control.png|thumb|Block diagram of a [[Negative feedback|negative feedback control system]] used to maintain PV = SP]]
Measurement of process variables are essential in [[control system]]s to controlling a process. The value of the process variable is continuously monitored so that control may be exerted. 

Four commonly measured variables which affect chemical and physical processes are: [[pressure]], [[Thermodynamic temperature|temperature]], level and flow.{{cn|date=December 2011}} but there are in fact a large number of measurement quantities which for international purposes use the [[International System of Units]] (SI)

The SP-PV error is used to exert control on a process so that the value of PV equals the value of the SP. A classic use of this is in the 
[[PID controller]].

'''RTI Surgical''' is a [[medical technology]] company that was founded in 1992 as '''Pioneer Surgical Technology''' in [[Marquette, Michigan]], United States. The firm was [[Michigan]]'s largest private [[medical technology]] company. The company was founded by [[Matthew Songer]], and its first major product was the Songer Cable, used in spine surgeries. The Songer Cable was featured in the book, "Contemporary Management of Spinal Cord Injuries: From Impact to Rehabilitation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1 = Edward C. |last1 =  Benzel |first2 =  Charles H. |last2 =  Tator |last-author-amp = yes |year = 2000 |title = Contemporary Management of Spinal Cord Injuries: From Impact to Rehabilitation |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UUfs4lYLFZEC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166 |location = Park Ridge, IL |publisher = [[American Association of Neurological Surgeons]] |page = 166 |isbn = 978-1-879284-72-2 |oclc = 247971013 |via = [[Google Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pioneer Surgical has since developed products in the spine, biologics, orthopedics, and cardio-thoracic markets. Pioneer has facilities throughout the U.S. and Europe and employs nearly 300 people. In 2007, Pioneer acquired Angstrom Medica, a [[Massachusetts]]-based medical company focused on [[nanotechnology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.smalltimes.com/articles/article_display.cfm?Section=ONART&amp;C=Bio&amp;ARTICLE_ID=310518&amp;p=109 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626081849/http://www.smalltimes.com/articles/article_display.cfm?Section=ONART&amp;C=Bio&amp;ARTICLE_ID=310518&amp;p=109 |archive-date=2009-06-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Encelle, A [[North Carolina]]-based company researching and developing tissue regeneration products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date = October 25, 2007 |title = Pioneer Surgical Technology Acquires Nanotechnology Pioneer Angstrom Medica |url = http://www.nanowerk.com/news/newsid=3057.php |work = Nanowerk |access-date = June 18, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneer was acquired in July 2013 by RTI Biologics, and the firm was then renamed RTI Surgical.

{{Refimprove|date=May 2009}}
'''Radiation hardening''' is the act of making [[electronic components]] and systems resistant to damage or malfunctions caused by [[ionizing radiation]] ([[particle radiation]] and high-energy [[electromagnetic radiation]]),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=566850&amp;referURL=http://www.accessscience.com/content.aspx?searchStr=Radiation+hardening&amp;id=566850, "Radiation Hardening"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} McGraws AccessScience&lt;/ref&gt; such as those encountered in [[outer space]] and high-altitude flight, around [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[particle accelerators]], or during [[nuclear accident]]s or [[nuclear warfare]].

Most [[Semiconductor device|semiconductor electronic components]] are susceptible to radiation damage; radiation-hardened components are based on their non-hardened equivalents, with some design and manufacturing variations that reduce the susceptibility to radiation damage. Due to the extensive development and testing required to produce a radiation-tolerant design of a [[microelectronics|microelectronic]] chip, radiation-hardened chips tend to lag behind the most recent developments.

Radiation-hardened products are typically tested to one or more resultant effects tests, including total ionizing dose (TID), enhanced low dose rate effects (ELDRS), neutron and proton displacement damage, and single event effects (SEE, SET, SEL and SEB).

==Problems caused by radiation==
{{See also|Radiation damage}}

Environments with high levels of ionizing radiation create special design challenges. A single [[charged particle]] can knock thousands of [[electron]]s loose, causing [[electronic noise]] and [[signal spike]]s. In the case of [[digital circuit]]s, this can cause results which are inaccurate or unintelligible. This is a particularly serious problem in the design of [[satellite]]s, [[spacecraft]], [[military aircraft]], nuclear power stations, and [[nuclear weapon]]s. In order to ensure the proper operation of such systems, manufacturers of [[integrated circuit]]s and [[sensor]]s intended for the [[military]] or [[aerospace]] markets employ various methods of radiation hardening. The resulting systems are said to be '''rad(iation)-hardened''', '''rad-hard''', or (within context) '''hardened'''.

==Major radiation damage sources==
Typical sources of exposure of electronics to ionizing radiation are the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s for satellites, nuclear reactors in power plants for sensors and control circuits, particle accelerators for control electronics particularly [[particle detector]] devices, residual radiation from [[isotope]]s in [[Soft error#Alpha particles from package decay|chip packaging materials]], [[cosmic radiation]] for spacecraft and high-altitude aircraft, and [[nuclear explosion]]s for potentially all military and civilian electronics.

* [[Cosmic ray]]s come from all directions and consist of approximately 85% [[proton]]s, 14% [[alpha particle]]s, and 1% [[HZE ions|heavy ions]], together with x-ray and gamma-ray radiation. Most effects are caused by particles with energies between 0.1 and 20 [[electronvolt|GeV]]. The atmosphere filters most of these, so they are primarily a concern for spacecraft and high-altitude aircraft.
* [[Coronal mass ejection|Solar particle events]] come from the direction of the [[sun]] and consist of a large flux of high-energy (several GeV) protons and heavy ions, again accompanied by x-ray radiation.
* [[Van Allen radiation belts]] contain electrons (up to about 10 MeV) and protons (up to 100s MeV) trapped in the [[geomagnetic field]]. The particle flux in the regions farther from the Earth can vary wildly depending on the actual conditions of the Sun and the [[magnetosphere]]. Due to their position they pose a concern for satellites.
* [[Secondary particle]]s result from interaction of other kinds of radiation with structures around the electronic devices.
* Nuclear reactors produce [[gamma radiation]] and [[neutron radiation]] which can affect sensor and control circuits in [[nuclear power plant]]s.
* [[Particle accelerator]]s produce high energy protons and electrons, and the secondary particles produced by their interactions produce significant radiation damage on sensitive control and particle detector components, of the order of magnitude of 10 MRad[Si]/year for systems such as the [[Large Hadron Collider]].
* Nuclear explosions produce a short and extremely intense surge through a wide spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, an [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP), neutron radiation, and a flux of both primary and secondary charged particles. In case of a nuclear war they pose a potential concern for all civilian and military electronics.
* [[Soft error#Alpha particles from package decay|Chip packaging materials]] were an insidious source of radiation that was found to be causing [[soft error]]s in new [[DRAM]] chips in the 1970s. Traces of [[radioisotope|radioactive elements]] in the packaging of the chips were producing alpha particles, which were then occasionally discharging some of the capacitors used to store the DRAM data bits. These effects have been reduced today by using purer packaging materials, and employing [[error-correcting code]]s to detect and often correct DRAM errors.

==Radiation effects on electronics==
&lt;!-- rephrased largely from
     http://www.mse.vt.edu/faculty/hendricks/mse4206/projects97/group02/effects.htm
with additions from several other sources --&gt;

===Fundamental mechanisms===
Two fundamental damage mechanisms take place:

====Lattice displacement====
Lattice displacement is caused by [[neutron]]s, protons, alpha particles, heavy ions, and very high energy [[gamma photon]]s. They change the arrangement of the atoms in the [[crystal lattice]], creating lasting damage, and increasing the number of [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination center]]s, depleting the [[minority carrier]]s and worsening the analog properties of the affected semiconductor [[p-n junction|junctions]]. Counterintuitively, higher doses over short time cause partial [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] ("healing") of the damaged lattice, leading to a lower degree of damage than with the same doses delivered in low intensity over a long time (LDR or Low Dose Rate). This type of problem is particularly significant in [[bipolar transistor]]s, which are dependent on minority carriers in their base regions; increased losses caused by [[recombination (physics)|recombination]] cause loss of the transistor [[gain (electronics)#Electronics|gain]] (see ''[[#Resultant effects|neutron effects]]''). Components certified as ELDRS (Enhanced Low Dose Rate Sensitive) free, do not show damages with fluxes below 0.01 rad(Si)/s = 36 rad(Si)/h.

====Ionization effects====
Ionization effects are caused by charged particles, including the ones with energy too low to cause lattice effects. The ionization effects are usually transient, creating [[glitch]]es and soft errors, but can lead to destruction of the device if they trigger other damage mechanisms (e.g. a [[latchup]]). [[Photocurrent]] caused by [[ultraviolet]] and [[x-ray]] radiation may belong to this category as well. Gradual accumulation of [[electron hole|holes]] in the oxide layer in [[MOSFET]] transistors leads to worsening of their performance, up to device failure when the dose is high enough (see ''[[#Resultant effects|total ionizing dose effects]]'').

The effects can vary wildly depending on all the parameters – type of radiation, total dose and radiation flux, combination of types of radiation, and even the kind of device load (operating frequency, operating voltage, actual state of the transistor during the instant it is struck by the particle) – which makes thorough testing difficult, time consuming, and requiring many test samples.

===Resultant effects===
The "end-user" effects can be characterized in several groups,

&lt;!--Ionization effectsNeutron effectsIonization effects--&gt;
A neutron interacting with the semiconductor lattice will displace its atoms. This leads to an increase in the count of recombination centers and [[deep-level defect]]s, reducing the lifetime of minority carriers, thus affecting [[bipolar junction transistor|bipolar devices]] more than [[CMOS]] ones. Bipolar devices on [[silicon]] tend to show changes in electrical parameters at levels of 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons/cm², CMOS devices aren't affected until 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons/cm². The sensitivity of the devices may increase together with increasing level of integration and decreasing size of individual structures. There is also a risk of induced radioactivity caused by [[neutron activation]], which is a major source of noise in [[high-energy astronomy|high energy astrophysics]] instruments. Induced radiation, together with residual radiation from impurities in used materials, can cause all sorts of single-event problems during the device's lifetime. [[gallium arsenide|GaAs]] [[light-emitting diode|LEDs]], common in [[optocoupler]]s, are very sensitive to neutrons. The lattice damage influences the frequency of [[crystal oscillator]]s. Kinetic energy effects (namely lattice displacement) of charged particles belong here too.

====Total ionizing dose effects====
The cumulative damage of the semiconductor lattice (''lattice displacement'' damage) caused by ionizing radiation over the exposition time. It is measured in [[rad (unit)|rads]] and causes slow gradual degradation of the device's performance. A total dose greater than 5000 rads delivered to silicon-based devices in seconds to minutes will cause long-term degradation. In CMOS devices, the radiation creates [[electron–hole pair]]s in the gate insulation layers, which cause photocurrents during their recombination, and the holes trapped in the lattice defects in the insulator create a persistent gate [[biasing]] and influence the transistors' [[threshold voltage]], making the N-type MOSFET transistors easier and the P-type ones more difficult to switch on. The accumulated charge can be high enough to keep the transistors permanently open (or closed), leading to device failure. Some self-healing takes place over time, but this effect is not too significant. This effect is the same as [[hot carrier degradation]] in high-integration high-speed electronics. Crystal oscillators are somewhat sensitive to radiation doses, which alter their frequency. The sensitivity can be greatly reduced by using [[swept quartz]]. Natural [[quartz]] crystals are especially sensitive. Radiation performance curves for TID testing may be generated for all resultant effects testing procedures. These curves show performance trends throughout the TID test process and are included in the radiation test report.

====Transient dose effects====
The short-time high-intensity pulse of radiation, typically occurring during a nuclear explosion. The high radiation flux creates photocurrents in the entire body of the semiconductor, causing transistors to randomly open, changing logical states of [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]] and [[Memory cell (computers)|memory cells]]. Permanent damage may occur if the duration of the pulse is too long, or if the pulse causes junction damage or a latchup. Latchups are commonly caused by the x-rays and gamma radiation flash of a nuclear explosion. Crystal oscillators may stop oscillating for the duration of the flash due to prompt [[photoconductivity]] induced in quartz.

====Systems-generated EMP effects====
SGEMP are caused by the radiation flash traveling through the equipment and causing local [[ionization]] and [[electric current]]s in the material of the chips, [[circuit board]]s, [[electrical cable]]s and cases.

===Digital damage: SEE===
Single-event effects (SEE), mostly affecting only [[Digital data|digital]] devices, were not studied extensively until relatively recently. When a high-energy particle travels through a semiconductor, it leaves an [[ion]]ized track behind. This ionization may cause a highly localized effect similar to the transient dose one - a benign glitch in output, a less benign bit flip in memory or a [[hardware register|register]] or, especially in [[Power semiconductor device|high-power transistors]], a destructive latchup and burnout. Single event effects have importance for electronics in satellites, [[aircraft]], and other [[civilian]] and military aerospace applications. Sometimes, in circuits not involving latches, it is helpful to introduce [[RC circuit|RC]] [[time constant]] circuits that slow down the circuit's reaction time beyond the duration of an SEE.

====Single-event transient====
SET happens when the charge collected from an ionization event discharges in the form of a spurious signal traveling through the circuit. This is de facto the effect of an [[electrostatic discharge]]. Soft error, reversible.

====Single-event upset====
[[Single-event upset]]s (SEU) or '''transient radiation effects in electronics''' are state changes of memory or register bits caused by a single ion interacting with the chip. They do not cause lasting damage to the device, but may cause lasting problems to a system which cannot recover from such an error. Soft error, reversible. In very sensitive devices, a single ion can cause a [[multiple-bit upset]] (MBU) in several adjacent memory cells. SEUs can become '''Single-event functional interrupts''' ('''SEFI''') when they upset control circuits, such as [[state machine]]s, placing the device into an undefined state, a [[test mode]], or a halt, which would then need a [[Reset (computing)|reset]] or a [[Power cycling|power cycle]] to recover.

====Single-event latchup====
SEL can occur in any chip with a [[thyristor|parasitic PNPN]] structure. A heavy ion or a high-energy proton passing through one of the two inner-transistor junctions can turn on the [[thyristor]]-like structure, which then stays "[[short circuit|short]]ed" (an effect known as latchup) until the device is power-cycled. As the effect can happen between the power source and substrate, destructively high current can be involved and the part may fail. Hard error, irreversible. Bulk CMOS devices are most susceptible.

====Single-event snapback====
Single-event snapback is similar to SEL but not requiring the PNPN structure, can be induced in N-channel MOS transistors switching large currents, when an ion hits near the drain junction and causes [[avalanche breakdown|avalanche multiplication]] of the [[charge carrier]]s. The transistor then opens and stays opened. Hard error, irreversible.

====Single-event induced burnout====
SEB may occur in power MOSFETs when the substrate right under the source region gets forward-biased and the drain-source voltage is higher than the breakdown voltage of the parasitic structures. The resulting high current and local overheating then may destroy the device. Hard error, irreversible.

====Single-event gate rupture====
SEGR was observed in power MOSFETs when a heavy ion hits the gate region while a high voltage is applied to the gate. A local breakdown then happens in the insulating layer of [[silicon dioxide]], causing local overheat and destruction (looking like a microscopic [[explosion]]) of the gate region. It can occur even in [[EEPROM]] cells during write or erase, when the cells are subjected to a comparatively high voltage. Hard error, irreversible.

===SEE testing===
While proton beams are widely used for SEE testing due to availability, at lower energies proton irradiation can often underestimate SEE susceptibility. Furthermore, proton beams expose devices to risk of total ionizing dose (TID) failure which can cloud proton testing results or result in pre-mature device failure. White neutron beams — ostensibly the most representative SEE test method — are usually derived from solid target-based sources, resulting in flux non-uniformity and small beam areas. White neutron beams also have some measure of uncertainty in their energy spectrum, often with high thermal neutron content.

The disadvantages of both proton and spallation neutron sources can be avoided by using mono-energetic 14 MeV neutrons for SEE testing. A potential concern is that mono-energetic neutron-induced single event effects will not accurately represent the real-world effects of broad-spectrum atmospheric neutrons. However, recent studies have indicated that, to the contrary, mono-energetic neutrons—particularly 14 MeV neutrons—can be used to quite accurately understand SEE cross-sections in modern microelectronics.

A particular study of interest, performed in 2010 by Normand and Dominik,&lt;ref&gt;E. Normand and L. Dominik. "Cross Comparison Guide for Results of Neutron SEE Testing of Microelectronics Applicable to Avionics," 2010&lt;/ref&gt; powerfully demonstrates the effectiveness of 14 MeV neutrons.

==Radiation-hardening techniques==
[[File:1886VE10-HD.jpg|thumb|Radiation hardened [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] of the 1886VE10 [[microcontroller]] prior to [[Metallizing|metalization]] [[Etching (microfabrication)|etching]]]]

===Physical===
Hardened chips are often manufactured on [[Electrical insulation|insulating]] [[wafer (electronics)|substrate]]s instead of the usual [[semiconductor]] wafers. Silicon on insulator ([[silicon on insulator|SOI]]) and [[sapphire]] ([[silicon on sapphire|SOS]]) are commonly used. While normal commercial-grade chips can withstand between 50 and 100 [[Gray (unit)|gray]] (5 and 10 krad), space-grade SOI and SOS chips can survive doses many orders of magnitude greater. At one time many [[4000 series]] chips were available in radiation-hardened versions (RadHard).&lt;ref name="verkasalo" /&gt;

Bipolar integrated circuits generally have higher radiation tolerance than CMOS circuits. The low-power Schottky (LS) [[5400 series]] can withstand 1000 krad, and many [[emitter-coupled logic|ECL devices]] can withstand 10 000 krad.&lt;ref name="verkasalo"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Protection of Instrument Control Computers against Soft and Hard Errors and Cosmic Ray Effects | citeseerx = 10.1.1.48.1291 | first1 = Kari | last1 = Leppälä | first2 = Raimo | last2 = Verkasalo | date = 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetoresistive [[Random-access memory|RAM]], or [[MRAM]], is considered a likely candidate to provide radiation hardened, rewritable, non-volatile conductor memory. Physical principles and early tests suggest that MRAM is not susceptible to ionization-induced data loss.

[[radiation shield|Shield]]ing the package against [[radioactivity]], to reduce exposure of the bare device.

[[Capacitor]]-based [[Dynamic random access memory|DRAM]] is often replaced by more rugged (but larger, and more expensive) [[Static Random Access Memory|SRAM]].

Choice of substrate with wide [[band gap]], which gives it higher tolerance to deep-level defects; e.g. [[silicon carbide]] or [[gallium nitride]].

Shielding the chips themselves by use of [[Boron#Depleted boron .28boron-11.29|depleted boron]] (consisting only of isotope boron-11) in the [[borophosphosilicate glass]] [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation layer]] protecting the chips, as boron-10 readily [[neutron capture|captures neutrons]] and undergoes [[alpha decay]] (see [[soft error#Cosmic rays creating energetic neutrons and protons|soft error]]).

===Logical===
Error correcting memory uses additional [[parity bit]]s to check for and possibly correct corrupted data. Since radiation effects damage the memory content even when the system is not accessing the RAM, a "[[Memory scrubbing|scrubber]]" circuit must continuously sweep the RAM; reading out the data, checking the parity for data errors, then writing back any corrections to the RAM.

[[Redundancy (engineering)|Redundant]] elements can be used at the system level. Three separate [[microprocessor]] boards may independently compute an answer to a calculation and compare their answers. Any system that produces a minority result will recalculate. Logic may be added such that if repeated errors occur from the same system, that board is shut down.

Redundant elements may be used at the circuit level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title = Protection of LSI Microprocessors using Triple Modular Redundancy | last = Platteter | first= D.G. | conference = International IEEE Symposium on Fault Tolerant Computing | date = October 1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A single bit may be replaced with three bits and separate "[[voting logic]]" for each bit to continuously determine its result. This increases area of a chip design by a factor of 5, so must be reserved for smaller designs. But it has the secondary advantage of also being "fail-safe" in real time. In the event of a single-bit failure (which may be unrelated to radiation), the voting logic will continue to produce the correct result without resorting to a [[watchdog timer]]. System level voting between three separate processor systems will generally need to use some circuit-level voting logic to perform the votes between the three processor systems. 

Hardened latches may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title = Analysis and design of soft-error hardened latches | conference = GLSVLSI '05 | booktitle = Proceedings of the 15th ACM Great Lakes symposium on VLSI | first1 = Srivathsan | last1 = Krishnamohan | first2 = Nihar R. | last2 = Mahapatra | date = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A watchdog timer will perform a hard reset of a system unless some sequence is performed that generally indicates the system is alive, such as a write operation from an onboard processor. During normal operation, software schedules a write to the watchdog timer at regular intervals to prevent the timer from running out. If radiation causes the processor to operate incorrectly, it is unlikely the software will work correctly enough to clear the watchdog timer. The watchdog eventually times out and forces a hard reset to the system. This is considered a last resort to other methods of radiation hardening.

==Military and space industry applications==
Radiation-hardened and radiation tolerant components are often used in military and space applications. These applications may include point-of-Load (POL) applications, satellite system power supply, step down [[switching regulator]], [[microprocessor]], [[FPGA]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryaerospace.com/articles/2016/06/radiation-hardened-space-fpga.html|title=FPGA development devices for radiation-hardened space applications introduced by Microsemi|website=www.militaryaerospace.com|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[FPGA]] power source, high efficiency low voltage subsystem power supply

==Nuclear hardness for telecommunication==
In [[telecommunication]], the term ''nuclear hardness'' has the following meanings:
1) an expression of the extent to which the performance of a [[system]], facility, or device is expected to degrade in a given nuclear environment, 2) the physical attributes of a system or [[electronic component]] that will allow survival in an environment that includes [[nuclear radiation]] and electromagnetic pulses (EMP).

===Notes===
# Nuclear hardness may be expressed in terms of either [[Electromagnetic compatibility#Introduction|susceptibility]] or [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]].
# The extent of expected performance [[Degradation (telecommunications)|degradation]] (''e.g.,'' outage time, [[data]] lost, and equipment damage) must be defined or specified. The environment (''e.g.,'' radiation levels, overpressure, peak velocities, energy absorbed, and electrical stress) must be defined or specified.
# The physical attributes of a system or component that will allow a defined degree of [[survivability]] in a given environment created by a nuclear weapon.
# Nuclear hardness is determined for specified or actual quantified environmental conditions and physical parameters, such as peak radiation levels, overpressure, velocities, energy absorbed, and electrical stress. It is achieved through [[design specification]]s and it is verified by test and analysis techniques.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or biomass, and biodiesel) and [[Hydrogen fuel]] (when produced with renewable processes).  This is in contrast to [[non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] fuels such as [[natural gas]], [[Liquified petroleum gas|LPG]] ([[propane]]), [[petroleum]] and other [[fossil fuels]] and [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]].  Renewable fuels can include fuels that are synthesized from [[renewable energy]] sources, such as wind and solar.  Renewable fuels have gained in popularity due to their [[sustainability]], [[Carbon neutral|low contributions]] to the [[carbon cycle]], and in some cases lower amounts of [[greenhouse gas]]es.  The geo-political ramifications of these fuels are also of interest, particularly to industrialized economies which desire [[Oil dependency|independence]] from [[Middle Eastern]] oil.

==Rationale for renewable fuels==
The [[International Energy Agency]]'s ''World Energy Outlook 2006'' concludes that rising oil demand, if left unchecked,
would accentuate the consuming countries' vulnerability to a severe supply disruption and resulting price shock. Renewable biofuels for transport represent a key source of diversification from [[petroleum products]]. Biofuels from grain and beet in [[temperate region]]s have a part to play, but they are relatively expensive and their energy efficiency and CO2 savings benefits, are variable. Biofuels from sugar cane and other highly productive tropical crops are much more competitive and beneficial. But all first generation biofuels ultimately compete with food production for land, water, and other resources. Greater efforts are required to develop and commercialize second generation biofuel technologies, such as biorefineries and [[cellulosic ethanol|ligno-cellulosics]], enabling the flexible production of biofuels and other products from non-edible plant materials.&lt;ref name=IEA&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2007/so_contribution.pdf Contribution of Renewables to Energy Security]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbert's [[Hubbert peak theory|peak oil theory]] suggests that petroleum is a [[finite resource]] that is rapidly depleting. Of the worldwide total remaining petroleum reserves of approximately {{convert|1277702000000|oilbbl|km3}} (about one half of the original virgin reserves) and a worldwide usage rate of {{convert|25000000000|oilbbl|km3}} per year, only about 50 years worth of [[petroleum]] is predicted to remain at the current depletion rate. Petroleum is imperative for the following industries: [[fuel]] (home heating, jet fuel, gasoline, diesel, etc.) [[transportation]], [[agriculture]], [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]], [[plastics]]/resins, man-made fibers, [[synthetic rubber]], and [[explosives]]. If the modern world remains reliant on petroleum as a source of energy, the price of crude oil could increase markedly, destabilizing economies worldwide. Consequently, renewable fuel drivers include: high oil prices, imbalance of trade, instability in oil exporting regions of the world, the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], the potential for windfall profits for American farmers and industries, avoidance of economic depression, avoidance of scarcity of products due to a volatile ‘[[peak oil]]’ scenario expected to begin as early as 2021,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July05/ethanol.toocostly.ssl.html Biomass for biofuel isn't worth it&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (though peak oil is not a new idea) and a slowing of [[global warming]] that may usher in unprecedented [[climate change]].

Furthermore, the global debate on [[climate change]], along with regional geopolitical instabilities have challenged nations to act to develop both alternative and [[carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral]] sources of energy. Renewable fuels are therefore becoming attractive to many governments, who are beginning to see sustainable energy independence as a valuable asset.

On December 19, 2007, President Bush signed into law the [[Energy Independence and Security Act]], establishing a requirement that at least {{convert|36|e9USgal|m3}} of renewable fuel be used in the marketplace by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/Government/MotorFuels/Pages/RenewableFuels.aspx Issue Update: Renewable Fuels Retailer Liability]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), [[cellulosic ethanol commercialization]] could allow [[ethanol fuel]]s to play a much larger role in the future than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency (2006). [http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/summaries2006/English.pdf ''World Energy Outlook 2006''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041451/http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/summaries2006/English.pdf |date=2007-09-28 }} p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Dedicated [[energy crop]]s, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be produced in many regions of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Biotechnology Industry Organization (2007).

==Biofuel==
{{main|Biofuel}}

Biofuel is a type of fuel whose energy is derived from biological [[carbon fixation]]. Biofuels include fuels derived from [[biomass]] conversion, as well as  [[Biofuel#Solid biofuels|solid biomass]], [[liquid fuels]] and various [[biogas]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.apenergy.2009.04.036| title = Political, economic and environmental impacts of biofuels: A review| year = 2009| last1 = Demirbas | first1 = A. .| journal = Applied Energy| volume = 86| pages = S108–S117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although [[fossil fuel]]s have their origin in ancient [[carbon fixation]], they are not considered biofuels by the generally accepted definition because they contain carbon that has been "out" of the carbon cycle for a very long time. Biofuels are gaining increased public and scientific attention, driven by factors such as [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price spikes]], the need for increased [[energy security]], concern over [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from [[fossil fuel]]s, and support from [[Ethanol fuel in the United_States#Tax_credits|government subsidies]].

[[Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]] or [[sugar cane]].  [[cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[biofuel in the united states|USA]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]]. Current plant design does not provide for converting the [[lignin]] portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation.

[[Biodiesel]] is made from [[vegetable oil]]s and [[animal fat]]s. Biodiesel can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe.

In 2010 worldwide biofuel production reached 105 billion liters (28 billion gallons US), up 17% from 2009, and biofuels provided 2.7% of the world's fuels for road transport, a contribution largely made up of ethanol and biodiesel.&lt;ref name=Biofuels2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/biofuels-make-comeback-despite-tough-economy|title=Biofuels Make a Comeback Despite Tough Economy|publisher=[[Worldwatch Institute]]|date=2011-08-31|accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global [[ethanol fuel]] production reached 86 billion liters (23 billion gallons US) in 2010, with the United States and Brazil as the world's top producers, accounting together for 90% of global production. The world's largest biodiesel producer is the [[European Union]], accounting for 53% of all biodiesel production in 2010.&lt;ref name=Biofuels2010/&gt; As of 2011, mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national level and in 29 states/provinces.&lt;ref name=ren212011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |pages=13–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[International Energy Agency]], biofuels have the potential to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/Oil/6017103 |title=IEA says biofuels can displace 27% of transportation fuels by 2050 Washington |author= |date=20 April 2011 |work=Platts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pyrolysis oil]] is another type of fuel derived from the [[Lignocellulosic biomass|lignocellulosic]] fraction of biomass. By rapidly heating biomass in the absence of oxygen ([[pyrolysis]]), a liquid crude can be formed that can be further processed into a usable bio-oil. As opposed to other biofuels, pyrolysis oils use the non-edible fraction of biomass and can occur on the order of milliseconds and without the need for large fermentation reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huber|first=George|title=Breaking the Chemical and Engineering Barriers to Lignocellulosic Biofuels: Next Generation Hydrocarbon Biorefineries|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrogen fuel==
[[Image:Photo praxair plant.hydrogen.infrastructure.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Hydrogen fuel requires the development of a specific infrastructure for processing, transport and storage.]]
{{main|Hydrogen economy}}
[[Hydrogen fuel]] refers to the use of [[hydrogen]] gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as an energy carrier. Broadly speaking, the production of renewable [[hydrogen fuel]] can be divided into two general categories: biologically derived production, and chemical production.&lt;ref name="nrelH2production"&gt;National Renewable Energy Laboratory 2003 ''Research Review'': "[http://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/pdfs/49923.pdf New Horizons for Hydrogen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192032/http://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/pdfs/49923.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}."&lt;/ref&gt; This is an area of current research, and new developments and technologies are causing this field to evolve rapidly.

The biological production of hydrogen fuel has been a topic of research since at least the 1970s. Hydrogen gas can be produced from biomass sources like agricultural and forest residues, consumer waste and other specific agricultural crops.&lt;ref name="nrelH2production" /&gt; Specifically, hydrogen fuel is produced by a process called [[gasification]], where biomass is processed into a combustible gas and then burned, or by [[pyrolysis]], a related process which can lead to hydrogen gas suitable for fuel-cell applications. One continuing subject of research regards the production of unwanted co-products in both of these processes. The presence of other contaminant gases often depend on specific composition of the biomass source, which can be difficult to control.&lt;ref name="nrelH2production" /&gt; Another source for biological production of hydrogen fuel is [[algae]]. In the late 1990s it was discovered that if algae are deprived of sulfur they will switch from the production of oxygen, as in normal photosynthesis, to the production of hydrogen.&lt;ref name="wiredSwamp"&gt;Wired, ''[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.04/mustread.html?pg=5 It Came from the Swamp: Reengineering Algae To Fuel The Hydrogen Economy],'' accessed September 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental [[Biological hydrogen production (Algae)|algae farms]] are attempting to make algae an economically feasible energy source.&lt;ref name="registerAlgae"&gt;The Register, ''[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/02/24/pond_scum_breakthrough/ Pond life: the future of energy],'' accessed September 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also several physico-chemical methods for producing hydrogen; most of these methods require electrolysis of water. When this process draws its power from renewable energy sources like [[wind turbines]] or [[photovoltaic cells]], the production requires little consumption of non-renewable resources. Hydrogen fuel, when produced by renewable sources of energy like wind or solar power, is a renewable fuel.&lt;ref name="nrelH2production" /&gt;

==Processed engineered fuel==
PEF is a partial replacement for fossil fuels in cement kilns. It has significant calorific value and can be used as a fuel substitute for coal and gas in high-combustion facilities. PEF facilities typically divert waste from landfill, reducing demand for non-renewable coal and reducing waste to landfill.

'''SlideIT''' is a text [[input method]] for [[touchscreen]] devices developed by Dasur Ltd based on pattern recognition.

On Android, it works up to and including [[Lollipop]], version 5 of Android.

== Product ==
SlideIT  allows a user to enter a word by sliding a finger or stylus from letter to letter on a virtual [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]], lifting only between words. SlideIT uses advanced pattern recognition and error-correction algorithms together with a complicated [[language model]] and word database to ensure maximum accuracy of the text in output, while allowing the user a lot of freedom and inaccuracy in entering text. This allows for text input at much higher rates than normal mobile phone and other small [[touch-screen]] keyboards.

== Developer ==
[[Dasur]] is a technology company that specializes in complex mathematical applications. Over the last 20 years, Dasur has developed a powerful pattern recognition engine which can be the basis for many applications. Based on this engine, Dasur has developed this generation of text input solutions for mobile phones and PDAs.

== History ==
The first version was released on 2007 as two separate keyboards, ThumbKey and SlideIT. ThumbKey's technology brought the touchscreen method with the option of using only one hand. Dasur's ThumbKey used an algorithm that allowed users to just press in the general vicinity of the required key for the intended word to appear on the screen. The algorithm processed the typed letters and its disambiguation feature suggested the intended word and also displayed additional possibilities next to the keyboard.

In 2009 the two keyboards were merged into one product branded SlideIT which offers an 'ABC' mode with the ThumbKey unique algorithm and the 'Slide' mode with the sliding algorithm. At the end of 2010 Dasur released a new version for Symbian and in early 2011 a version 3.0 for the Android was released.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

== Languages ==
The keyboard can be customized with a primary and several secondary languages, and the user can rotate between them at any time by pressing a button. In addition, Slide it supports a third tier of languages accessible by long-pressing the language button. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In effect, this multi language support is a key differentiator to other keyboards for users regularly switching between three, four or more languages. Rotate between the two or three most used languages, have the other ones quickly available.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

== Speed ==

The term "smart structures" is commonly used for structures which have the ability to adapt to environmental conditions according to the design requirements. As a rule, the adjustments are designed and performed in order to increase the efficiency or safety of the structure.  Combining "smart structures" with the "sophistication" achieved in [[materials science]], [[information technology]], measurement science, [[sensors]], [[actuators]], [[signal processing]], [[nanotechnology]], [[cybernetics]], [[artificial intelligence]], and [[biomimetics]],&lt;ref&gt;Wadhawan, V.K. (2005) Smart Structures and Materials. Resonance [online]. Available from: http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/Nov2005/pdf/Nov2005p27-41.pdf [Accessed 30 July 2012].&lt;/ref&gt; one can talk about Smart Intelligent Structures. In other words, structures which are able to sense their environment, self-diagnose their condition and adapt in such a way so as to make the design more useful and efficient.

The concept of Smart Intelligent Aircraft Structures offers significant improvements in aircraft total weight, [[manufacturing cost]] and, above all, operational cost by an integration of system tasks into the load carrying structure.&lt;ref&gt;Speckmann, H., Roesner, H. (2006). Structural Health Monitoring: A Contribution to the Intelligent Aircraft Structure, [online] ECNDT 2006 – Tu. 1.1.1, Airbus, Bremen, Germany. Available from: http://www.ndt.net/article/ecndt2006/doc/Tu.1.1.1.pdf [Accessed 30 July 2012].&lt;/ref&gt; It also helps to improve the aircraft’s life cycle and reduce its maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;Dufault, C.F. and Akhras, G., (2008). Smart Structure Applications in Aircraft. The Canadian Air Force Journal, [online], p. 31-39. Available from: {{cite web |url=http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/CFAWC/eLibrary/Journal/Vol1-2008/Iss2-Summer/Sections/06-Smart_Structure_Applications_in_Aircraft_e.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522211717/http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/CFAWC/eLibrary/Journal/Vol1-2008/Iss2-Summer/Sections/06-Smart_Structure_Applications_in_Aircraft_e.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-22 |df= }}  [Accessed 30 July 2012].&lt;/ref&gt; Individual morphing concepts also have the ability to decrease airframe generated noise and hence reduce the effect of air traffic noise near airports. Furthermore, cruise drag reductions have a positive effect on [[fuel consumption]] and required take-off fuel load.

== Morphing structures ==
Fixed geometry [[wing]]s are optimized for a single design point, identified through [[altitude]], [[Mach number]], [[weight]], etc. Their development is always a compromise between design and off-design points, referred to a typical mission. This is emphasised for civil aircraft where flight profiles are almost standard. Nevertheless, it may occur to fly at high speeds and low altitude with light weight over a short stretch or to fly at low speeds and high altitude with maximum load for a longer range. The [[lift coefficient]] would then range between 0.08 and 0.4,&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Monner, D. Sachau, E. Breitbach, "Design Aspects of the Elastic Trailing Edge for an Adaptive Wing", RTO AVT Specialists’ Meeting on "Structural Aspects of Flexible Aircraft Control", Ottawa (CAN), 18–20 October 1999, published in RTO MP 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Spillman, "The use of variable camber to reduce drag, weight and costs of transport aircraft", Aeronautical Journal, Vol. 96, No. 951, pp. 1-9, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; with the aircraft experiencing up to 30% weight reduction as the fuel is consumed.&lt;ref&gt;H. Ahrend, D. Heyland, W. Martin, "Das Leitkonzept ‘Adaptiver Fltiuegel’ (ADIF) DGLR-Jahrestagung, DGLR-JT97-147, Muenchen 1997&lt;/ref&gt; These changes could be compensated by [[Variable camber wing|wing camber variations]], to pursue optimal geometry for any flight condition, thus improving [[aerodynamic]] and structural performance

Existing aircraft cannot change shape without aerodynamic gaps, something that can be solved with Smart Intelligent Structures. By ensuring the detailed consideration of structural needs throughout the entire lifetime of an aircraft and focusing on the structural integration of needed past capabilities, Smart Intelligent Aircraft Structures will allow aircraft designers to seriously consider conformal morphing technologies. The reduced drag during take-off, cruise and landing for future and ecologically improved civil aircraft wings can be achieved through naturally laminar wing technology, by incorporating a gapless and deformable [[leading edge device]] with lift providing capability. Such a morphing structure typically consists of a flexible outer skin and an internal driving mechanism (Figure 1).
Current aircraft designs already employ [[winglets]] aimed at increasing the cruise flight efficiency by induced drag reduction. Smart intelligent Structures propose a state of the art technology that incorporates a [[wingtip]] active [[trailing edge]], which could be a means of reducing winglet and wing loads at key flight conditions.

==Structural health monitoring==

Another component of an "intelligent" aircraft structure is the ability to sense and diagnose potential threats to its structural integrity. This differs from conventional [[Nondestructive testing|non-destructive testing (NDT)]] by the fact that [[Structural health monitoring|Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)]] &lt;ref&gt;Guzman E. (2014) "A Novel Structural Health Monitoring Method for Full-Scale CFRP Structures". EPFL PhD thesis {{doi|10.5075/epfl-thesis-6422}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses sensors that are permanently bonded or embedded in the structure. [[Composite materials]], which are highly susceptible to hidden internal flaws which may occur during manufacturing and processing of the material or while the structure is subjected to service loads,  require a substantial amount of inspection and defect monitoring at regular intervals. Thus, the increasing use of composite materials for aircraft primary structure aircraft components increases substantially their [[Whole-life cost|life cycle cost]]. According to some estimates, over 25% of the life cycle cost of an aircraft or aerospace structure, which includes pre-production, production, and post-production costs, can be attributed to operation and support, involving inspection and maintenance. With sensing technology reducing in cost, size and weight, and sensor signal processing power continuously increasing, a variety of approaches have been developed allowing integration of such sensing options onto or into [[structural component]]s.

Although available in principle, none of these SHM technologies have currently achieved a sufficient level of maturity such that SHM could be reliably applied to real engineering structures. A real reduction of life cycle costs related to maintenance and inspections can only be achieved by SHM systems designed as "[[fail-safe]]" components and included within a [[damage tolerance]] assessment scenario, able to reduce the inspection times (or their intervals) by investigating the structure quickly and reliably and avoiding the time consuming disassembly of structural parts.&lt;ref&gt;Guzman E., Cugnoni J. and Gmür T. (2015) "Monitoring of composite structures using a network of integrated PVDF film transducers" Smart Materials and Structures vol. 24, num. 5, p. 055017 {{doi|10.1088/0964-1726/24/5/055017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multifunctional materials==

The advantages of [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRPs)]] over metallic materials in terms of specific [[stiffness]] and [[strength of materials|strength]] are well known. In the last few years, there has been a sharp increase in the demand for composite materials with integrated multifunctional capabilities for use in aeronautical structures.

However, a major drawback with CFRPs for primary structural applications is their low toughness and damage tolerance. [[Epoxy resins]] are brittle and have poor impact strength and resistance to [[crack propagation]], resulting in unsatisfactory levels of robustness and reliability. This results in designs with large margins of safety and complex inspection operations. In addition, by increasing the relative fraction of composite components within new aircraft, challenges regarding [[electrical conductivity]] have arisen such as [[lightning strike]] protection, [[static discharge]], [[electrical bonding]] and [[Electrical grounding|grounding]], interference shielding and current return through the structure. These drawbacks can be solved by the use of emerging technologies such as [[nanocomposites]], which combine mechanical, electrical and thermal properties.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, R.F., "A review of recent research on mechanics of multifunctional composite materials and structures", Composite Structures 92 (2010) 2793"&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanoparticle reinforced resins have been found to offer two distinct advantages over current resin systems,.&lt;ref&gt;Gojny F H., Wichmann M. H. G., Fiedler B., Bauhofer W., Schulte K., "Influence of nano-modification on the mechanical and electrical properties of conventional fibre-reinforced composites", Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing, 36 (2005) 1525-1535&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Z. Spitalsky, D. Tasis, K. Papagenlis, C. Galiotis, "Carbon nnotube-polymer composites: Chemistry, processing, mechanical and electrical properties", Progress in Polymer Science 35 (2010) 357-401&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Romhány, G. Szebényi, "Interlaminar crack propagation in MWCNT/fiber reinforced hybrid composites", eXPRESS Polymer Letters Vol. 3, Nº 3 (2009) 145-151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Kostopoulos, A. Baltopoulos, P. Karapappas, A. Vavoluliotis, A. Paipetis, "Impact and after-impact properties of carbon fibre reinforced composites enhanced with multi-wall carbon nanotubes", Composites Science and Technology 70 (2010) 553-563&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Gorbatikh, Y. Ding, N. De Greef, D. Yvanov, M. Karahan, A. Godara, L. Mezzo, S. Lomov, I. Verpoest, "Effect of carbon nanotubes on the damage development in fiber-reinforced composites", 14th European Conference on Composites Materials, 7–10 June 2010, Budapest, Hungary&lt;/ref&gt; First of all, they are able to provide an increase in fracture toughness of up to 50% for older liquid resin infusion (LRI) resins and 30% in more advanced systems. Secondly, percolated nanoparticles drastically improve resin conductivity, turning it from a perfect isolator into a [[semiconductor]]. While improved damage tolerance properties could directly lead to structural weight savings, the exploitation of electrical properties could also enable a simpler, and hence cheaper, Electrical Structure Network (ESN).

==Running research activities to implement the above technologies to aircraft==

Developing these technologies for future A/C, there is currently (2011 – 2015) a running project, partially funded by the [[European Commission]], called "SARISTU" (Smart Intelligent Aircraft Structures) with a total budget of €51,000,000. This initiative is coordinated by Airbus and brings together 64 partners from 16 European countries.&lt;ref&gt;SARISTU PROJECT www.saristu.eu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CORDIS {{cite web |url=http://cordis.europa.eu/projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=app.details&amp;TXT=saristu&amp;FRM=1&amp;STP=10&amp;SIC=&amp;PGA=&amp;CCY=&amp;PCY=&amp;SRC=&amp;LNG=en&amp;REF=100047 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223024814/http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/100047_en.html |archivedate=2015-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; SARISTU focuses on the cost reduction of air travel through a variety of individual applications as well as their combination. Specifically, the integration of different conformal morphing concepts in a laminar wing is intended to improve aircraft performance through a 6% drag reduction, with a positive effect on fuel consumption and required take-off fuel load. A side effect will be a decrease of up to 6&amp;nbsp;dB(A) of the airframe generated noise, thus reducing the impact of air traffic noise in the vicinity of airports. Recent calculations and [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] Analysis indicate that the target is likely to be exceeded but will still need to be offset against a possible weight penalty.

Another expected outcome is to limit the integration cost of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems by moving the system integration as far forward in the manufacturing chain as possible. In this manner, SHM integration becomes a feasible concept to enable in-service inspection cost reductions of up to 1%. Structural Health Monitoring related trials indicate that specific aircraft inspections may gain higher benefits than originally anticipated.

Finally, the incorporation of [[Carbon Nanotubes]] into aeronautical resins is expected to enable weight savings of up to 3% when compared to the unmodified skin/stringer/frame system, while a combination of technologies is expected to decrease Electrical Structure Network installation costs by up to 15%.

== Overview ==

The world's dependence on the declining reserves of fossil fuels poses not only [[environmental problems]] but also [[geopolitical]] ones.&lt;ref name=Hammarstrom&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hammarström|first=Leif|author2=Hammes-Schiffer, Sharon |title=Artificial Photosynthesis and Solar Fuels|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|date=21 December 2009|volume=42|issue=12|pages=1859–1860|doi=10.1021/ar900267k|url=http://pubs.acs.org/toc/achre4/42/12|accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solar fuels, in particular hydrogen, are viewed as an alternative source of energy for replacing fossil fuels especially where storage is essential. [[Electricity]] can be produced directly from sunlight through [[photovoltaics]], but this form of energy is rather inefficient to store compared to hydrogen.&lt;ref name=Styring/&gt; A solar fuel can be produced when and where sunlight is available, and stored and transported for later usage.

The most widely researched solar fuels are hydrogen and products of [[Photochemical carbon dioxide reduction|carbon dioxide reduction]].

Solar fuels can be produced via direct or indirect processes. Direct processes harness the energy in sunlight to produce a fuel without intermediary energy conversions. In contrast, indirect processes have solar energy converted to another form of energy first (such as [[biomass]] or electricity) that can then be used to produce a fuel. Indirect processes have been easier to implement but have the disadvantage of being less efficient than, e.g., water splitting for the production of hydrogen, since energy is wasted in the intermediary conversion.&lt;ref name=Styring/&gt;

== Photochemical hydrogen production ==

[[File:Photo Electric Cell Evolving Hydrogen and Oxygen.jpg|thumb|A sample of a photoelectric cell in a lab environment. Catalysts are added to the cell, which is submerged in water and illuminated by simulated sunlight. The bubbles seen are oxygen (forming on the front of the cell) and hydrogen (forming on the back of the cell).]]

Hydrogen can be produced by [[electrolysis]]. To use sunlight in this process, a [[photoelectrochemical cell]] can be used, where one [[Photosensitizer|photosensitized]] [[electrode]] converts light into an electric current that is then used for [[water splitting]]. One such type of cell is the [[dye-sensitized solar cell]].&lt;ref name=Kalyanasundaram&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalyanasundaram|first=K.|author2=Grätzel, M.|title=Artificial photosynthesis: biomimetic approaches to solar energy conversion and storage|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|date=June 2010|volume=21|issue=3|pages=298–310|doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2010.03.021|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166910000649|accessdate=24 January 2012|pmid=20439158}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an indirect process, since it produces electricity that then is used to form hydrogen. The other major indirect process using sunlight is conversion of biomass to [[biofuel]] using [[Phototroph|photosynthetic organisms]]; however, most of the energy harvested by [[photosynthesis]] is used in life-sustaining processes and therefore lost for energy use.&lt;ref name=Styring/&gt;

A direct process can use a [[catalyst]] that reduces protons to molecular hydrogen upon electrons from an [[excited state|excited]] photosensitizer. Several such catalysts have been developed as [[proof of concept]], but not yet scaled up for commercial use; nevertheless, their relative simplicity gives the advantage of potential lower cost and increased energy conversion efficiency.&lt;ref name=Styring/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andreiadis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andreiadis|first=Eugen S.|author2=Chavarot-Kerlidou, Murielle |author3=Fontecave, Marc |author4= Artero, Vincent |title=Artificial Photosynthesis: From Molecular Catalysts for Light-driven Water Splitting to Photoelectrochemical Cells|journal=Photochemistry and Photobiology|date=September–October 2011|volume=87|issue=5|pages=946–964|doi=10.1111/j.1751-1097.2011.00966.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-1097.2011.00966.x/abstract|accessdate=19 January 2012 |pmid=21740444}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such proof of concept is the "artificial leaf" developed by Nocera and coworkers: a combination of [[metal oxide]]-based catalysts and a [[semiconductor]] [[solar cell]] produces hydrogen upon illumination, with [[oxygen]] as the only byproduct.&lt;ref name=Reece&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reece|first=Steven Y.|author2=Hamel, Jonathan A. |author3=Sung, Kimberly |author4=Jarvi, Thomas D. |author5=Esswein, Arthur J. |author6=Pijpers, Joep J.

Hydrogen can also be produced from some photosynthetic microorganisms ([[microalgae]] and [[cyanobacteria]]) using [[photobioreactors]]. Some of these organisms produce hydrogen upon switching [[growth medium|culture]] conditions; for example, ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'' produces hydrogen [[Facultative anaerobic organism|anaerobically]] under [[sulfur]] deprivation, that is, when cells are moved from one growth medium to another that does not contain sulfur, and are grown without access to atmospheric oxygen.&lt;ref name=Kosourov&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosourov|first=Sergey|author2=Tsygankov, Anatoly |author3=Seibert, Michael |author4= Ghirardi, Maria L. |title=Sustained hydrogen photoproduction by ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'': Effects of culture parameters|journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering|date=30 June 2002|volume=78|issue=7|pages=731–740|doi=10.1002/bit.10254|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.10254/abstract;jsessionid=330C9E532DDF9B592A78C784515A44DC.d03t04|accessdate=26 January 2012 |pmid=12001165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach was to abolish activity of the hydrogen-oxidizing (uptake) [[hydrogenase]] [[enzyme]] in the [[diazotroph]]ic cyanobacterium ''[[Nostoc punctiforme]]'', so that it would not consume hydrogen that is naturally produced by the [[nitrogenase]] enzyme in [[nitrogen-fixing]] conditions.&lt;ref name=Lindberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindberg|first=Pia|author2=Schûtz, Kathrin |author3=Happe, Thomas |author4= Lindblad, Peter |title=A hydrogen-producing, hydrogenase-free mutant strain of ''Nostoc punctiforme'' ATCC 29133|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|date=November–December 2002|volume=27|issue=11-12|pages=1291–1296|doi=10.1016/S0360-3199(02)00121-0|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319902001210|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This ''N. punctiforme'' [[mutant]] could then produce hydrogen when illuminated with [[visible light]].

[[Carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can be reduced to [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and other more reduced compounds, such as [[methane]], using the appropriate photocatalysts. One early example was the use of [[Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride]] (Ru(bipy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[cobalt chloride]] (CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to CO.&lt;ref name=Lehn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lehn|first=Jean-Marie|author2=Ziessel, Raymond |title=Photochemical generation of carbon monoxide and hydrogen by reduction of carbon dioxide and water under visible light irradiation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=January 1982|volume=79|issue=2|pages=701–704|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/79/2/701.abstract|accessdate=26 January 2012|doi=10.1073/pnas.79.2.701|pmc=345815}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many compounds that do similar reactions have since been developed, but they generally perform poorly with atmospheric concentrations of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, requiring further concentration.&lt;ref name=Dubois&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dubois|first=M.

Also in this case, the use of microorganisms has been explored. Using [[genetic engineering]] and [[synthetic biology]] techniques, parts of or whole biofuel-producing [[metabolic pathways]] can be introduced in photosynthetic organisms. One example is the production of [[1-butanol]] in ''[[Synechococcus elongatus]]'' using enzymes from ''[[Clostridium acetobutylicum]]'', ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Treponema denticola]]''.&lt;ref name=Lan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lan|first=Ethan I.|author2=Liao, James C. |title=Metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria for 1-butanol production from carbon dioxide|journal=Metabolic Engineering|date=July 2011|volume=13|issue=4|pages=353–363|doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2011.04.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096717611000474|accessdate=25 January 2012|pmid=21569861}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a large-scale research facility exploring this type of biofuel production is the [[AlgaePARC]] in the [[Wageningen University and Research Centre]], [[Netherlands]].

'''The Sustainable City''' is a 46 [[hectare]] property development in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]]. Situated on the Al Qudra road, it is the first net zero energy development in the Emirate of Dubai. The development includes 500 villas, 89 apartments and a mixed use area consisting of offices, retail, healthcare facilities, a nursery and food and beverage outlets. Phase 2 of the development will include a hotel, school and innovation centre. 

The City was developed by Dubai-based Diamond Developers, whose Chief Executive Officer, Faris Saeed, has stated that much of his inspiration for the development came from [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] West Village.

Key elements of the City include:

* a residential area of 500 townhouses and courtyard villas inspired by Dubai’s old [[Al Bastakiya|Bastakiya]] district
* 11 natural ‘biodome’ greenhouses, organic farm and individual garden farms for local food production that use a passive cooling method with fans and pads.
* 10 MW peak solar production
* waste water recycling, with segregated drainage for [[greywater]] and [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] using papyrus as a biofilter
* biking and shaded jogging trails
* charging stations for electric cars
* an equestrian centre

Apart from periphery roads and car parking areas, the development is a car-free site.

The parking areas are topped by solar shading featuring solar panels that are connected to an electrical grid to supply energy into different sections of the city.

Panels are also placed on the roofs of all of the houses.

The construction waste is reused to furniture the public spaces.

The townhouses have UV reflective paint to reduce the thermal heat gain inside the houses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3840">[[File:Partial transmittance.gif|thumb|Signal (or energy) transmitted and reflected from a discontinuity]]
'''Time-domain reflectometry''' or '''TDR''' is a [[Measurement|measurement technique]] used to determine the characteristics of [[Transmission line|electrical lines]] by observing [[Reflection (electrical)|reflected]] [[waveform]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Furse, Cynthia, Lo, Chet. "[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3056713_Noise-Domain_Reflectometry_for_Locating_Wiring_Faults Reflectometry for Locating Wiring Faults]". IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility. February, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; '''Time-domain transmissometry''' ('''TDT''') is an analogous technique that measures the transmitted (rather than reflected) impulse. Together, they provide a powerful means of analysing electrical or optical transmission media such as [[coaxial cable]] and [[optical fiber]].  

Variations of TDR exist. For example, [[spread-spectrum time-domain reflectometry]] (SSTDR) is used to detect intermittent faults in complex and high-noise systems such as aircraft wiring.&lt;ref&gt;Smth,Paul, Furse, Cynthia and Gunther, Jacob. "Analysis of Spread Spectrum Time Domain Reflectometry for [http://livewiretest.com/analysis-of-spread-spectrum-time-domain-reflectometry-for-wire-fault-location/ Wire Fault Location] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wQrUbdfD?url=http://livewiretest.com/analysis-of-spread-spectrum-time-domain-reflectometry-for-wire-fault-location/ |date=2011-02-12 }}." IEEE Sensors Journal. December, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Coherent optical time domain reflectometry (COTDR) is another variant, used in optical systems, in which the returned signal is mixed with a local oscillator and then filtered to reduce noise.&lt;ref&gt;José Chesnoy (ed.), ''Undersea Fiber Communication Systems'', Elsevier Science, 2002, {{ISBN|0-12-171408-X}}, p.171 (COTDR)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the [[Discontinuity (transmission lines)|discontinuity]] can be determined from the [[amplitude]] of the reflected signal. The [[distance]] to the reflecting impedance can also be determined from the [[time]] that a [[Pulse (signal processing)|pulse]] takes to return. The limitation of this method is the minimum system [[rise time]]. The total rise time consists of the combined rise time of the driving pulse and that of the [[oscilloscope]] or sampler that monitors the reflections.

==Method==
The TDR analysis begins with the propagation of a [[Step function|step]] or impulse of [[energy]] into a [[system]] and the subsequent observation of the energy reflected by the system. By analyzing the magnitude, duration and shape of the reflected waveform, the nature of the impedance variation in the transmission system can be determined.

===Resistive load===
If a pure [[Resistor|resistive load]] is placed on the output of the [[Time-domain reflectometer|reflectometer]] and a [[Step function|step signal]] is applied, a step signal is observed on the display, and its height is a function of the resistance. The magnitude of the step produced by the resistive load may be expressed as a fraction of the input signal as given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{R_L - Z_0}{R_L + Z_0}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[characteristic impedance]] of the [[transmission line]].

===Reactive load===
For [[electrical reactance|reactive load]]s, the observed waveform depends upon the time constant formed by the load and the characteristic impedance of the line.

In mobile-telephone technology, the '''UniPro protocol stack'''&lt;ref name="UniPro1.1"&gt;[https://members.mipi.org/mipi-adopters/file-fix/Specifications/Board%20Approved/mipi_UniPro_Specification_v01-10-01a.pdf MIPI Alliance Specification for Unified Protocol (UniPro&lt;sup&gt;SM&lt;/sup&gt;) v1.10.01 ], requires an account at the MIPI website&lt;/ref&gt; follows the architecture of the classical [[OSI model|OSI Reference Model]]. In [[UniPro]], the OSI Physical Layer is split into two sublayers: Layer 1 (the actual physical layer) and Layer 1.5 (the PHY Adapter layer) which abstracts from differences between alternative Layer 1 technologies. The actual physical layer is a separate specification as the various PHY options are reused&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mipi.org/specifications Overview of MIPI specifications], D-PHY is used in the DSI, CSI, and UniPro specifications, M-PHY is used in the UniPro, DigRFv4 and LLI specifications&lt;/ref&gt; in other [[Mobile Industry Processor Interface|MIPI Alliance]] specifications.

The UniPro specification itself covers Layers 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and the DME (Device Management Entity). The Application Layer (LA) is out of scope because different uses of UniPro will require different LA protocols. The Physical Layer (L1) is covered in separate MIPI specifications in order to allow the PHY to be reused by other (less generic) protocols if needed.

OSI Layers 5 (Session) and 6 (Presentation) are, where applicable, counted as part of the Application Layer.

==Physical Layer (L1)==

===D-PHY===
Versions 1.0 and 1.1 of UniPro use MIPI's D-PHY technology for the off-chip Physical Layer. This PHY allows inter-chip communication. Data rates of the D-PHY are variable, but are in the range of 500-1000 Mbit/s (lower speeds are supported, but at decreased power efficiency). The D-PHY was named after the Roman number for 500 ("D").

The [[D-PHY]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://members.mipi.org/mipi-adopters/file-fix/Specifications/Board%20Approved/mipi_D-PHY_specification_v01-00-00.pdf MIPI Alliance Specification for D-PHY v1.00.00], requires an account at the MIPI website&lt;/ref&gt; uses differential signaling to convey PHY symbols over micro-stripline wiring. A second differential signal pair is used to transmit the associated clock signal from the source to the destination. The D-PHY technology thus uses a total of 2 clock wires per direction plus 2 signal wires per lane and per direction. For example, a D-PHY might use 2 wires for the clock and 4 wires (2 lanes) for the data in the forward direction, but 2 wires for the clock and 6 wires (3 lanes) for the data in the reverse direction. Data traffic in the forward and reverse directions are totally independent at this level of the protocol stack.

In UniPro, the D-PHY is used in a mode (called "8b9b" encoding) which conveys 8-bit bytes as 9-bit symbols. The UniPro protocol uses this to represent special control symbols (outside the usual 0 to 255 values). The PHY itself uses this to represent certain special symbols that have meaning to the PHY itself (e.g. IDLE symbols). Note that the ratio 8:9 can cause some confusion when specifying the data rate of the D-PHY: a PHY implementation running with a 450&amp;nbsp;MHz clock frequency is often rated as a 900 Mbit/s PHY, while only 800 Mbit/s is then available for the UniPro stack.

The D-PHY also supports a Low-Power Data Transmission (LPDT) mode and various other low-power modes for use when no data needs to be sent.

==={{Anchor|M-PHY}}M-PHY===
Versions 1.4 and beyond of UniPro support both the D-PHY as well as M-PHY&lt;ref&gt;[https://members.mipi.org/mipi-adopters/file-fix/Specifications/Board%20Approved/mipi_M-PHY_specification_v1-00-00.pdf MIPI Specification for M-PHY version 1.00.00], requires an account at the MIPI website&lt;/ref&gt; technology. The M-PHY technology is still in draft status, but supports high-speed data rates starting at about 1000 Mbit/s (the M-PHY was named after the Roman number for 1000). In addition to higher speeds, the M-PHY will use fewer signal wires because the clock signal is embedded with the data through the use of industry-standard [[8B/10B encoding|8b10b encoding]]. Again, a PHY capable of transmitting user data at 1000 Mbit/s is typically specified as being in 1250 Mbit/s mode due to the 8b10b encoding.

|}

The D- and M-PHY are expected to co-exist for several years. D-PHY is a less complex technology, M-PHY provides higher bandwidths with fewer signal wires, and C-PHY provides low-power.

===Low speed modes and power savings===

It is worth noting that UniPro supports the power efficient low speed communication modes provided by both the D-PHY (10 Mbit/s) and M-PHY (3 Mbit/sec up to 500 Mbit/s). In these modes, power consumption roughly scales with the amount of data that is sent.
Furthermore, both PHY technologies provide additional power saving modes because they were optimized for use in battery-powered devices.

==PHY Adapter Layer (L1.5)==

Architecturally, the PHY Adapter layer serves to hide the differences between the different PHY options (D- and M-PHY). This abstraction thus mainly gives architectural flexibility. Abstracted PHY details include the various power states and employed symbol encoding schemes.

===L1.5 symbols===

|}

L1.5 thus has its own (conceptual) symbol encoding consisting of 17-bit symbols. These 17-bit symbols never show up on the wires, because they are first converted by L1.5 to a pair of PHY symbols. The extra 17th control bit indicates special control symbols which are used by the protocol (L1.5 and L2) itself. In the figures, the control bits are shown in "L1.5 red" as a reminder that they are defined in- and used by protocol Layer 1.5.

===L1.5 multi-lane support===
The main feature that L1.5 offers users is to allow the bandwidth of a UniPro link to be increased by using 2, 3 or 4 lanes when a single lane does not provide enough bandwidth. To the user, such a multi-lane link simply looks like a faster physical layer because the symbols are sent across 2, 3 or 4 lanes. Applications that require higher bandwidth in one direction but require less bandwidth in the opposite direction, can have different numbers of lanes per direction.

====L1.5 lane discovery====
Starting in UniPro v1.4, L1.5 automatically discovers the number of usable M-PHY lanes for each direction of the link. This involves a simple discovery protocol within L1.5 that is executed on initialization. The protocol transmits test data on each available outbound lane, and receives information back from the peer entity about which data on which lane actually made it to the other end of the link. The mechanism also supports transparent remapping of the lanes to give circuit board designers flexibility in how the lanes are physically wired.

===L1.5 link power management===
Starting in UniPro v1.4, L1.5 has a built in protocol called PACP (PA Control Protocol) that allows L1.5 to communicate with its peer L1.5 entity at the other end of an M-PHY-based link. Its main usage is to provide a simple and reliable way for a controller at one end of the link to change the power modes of both the forward and reverse directions of the link. This means that a controller situated at one end of the link can change the power mode of both link directions in a single atomic operation. The intricate steps required for doing this in a fully reliable way are handled transparently within L1.5.

===L1.5 peer parameters control===
In addition to the L1.5 link power management the PACP is also used to access control and status parameters of the peer UniPro device.

===L1.5 guarantees===
The mechanisms in L1.5 guarantee the following to upper layer protocols:
* after reset, each L1.5 transmitter will wait until the connected L1.5 receiver is known to be active (handled via a handshake)
* if more than one lane is used, the ordering of the original symbol stream is preserved (despite usage of multiple lanes and freedom on how to interconnect these lanes)
* power mode changes are executed reliably (even in the presence of bit errors)

==Data Link Layer (L2)==
The main task of UniPro's Data Link layer (L2) is to allow reliable communication between two adjacent nodes in the network - despite occasional bit errors at the Physical layer or potential link congestion if the receiver cannot absorb the data fast enough.

===L2 data frames===
L2 clusters 17-bit UniPro L1.5 symbols into packet-like data frames (the term packet is reserved for L3). These data frames start with a 17-bit start-of-frame control symbol, followed by up to 288 bytes of data (144 data symbols) and followed by an end-of-frame control symbol and a checksum.

Note that two or more of the 288 bytes are used by higher layers of the UniPro protocol. The maximum frame size of 288 payload bytes per frame was chosen to ensure that the entire protocol stack could easily transmit 256 bytes of application data in a single chunk. Payloads consisting of odd numbers of bytes are supported by padding the frame to an even number of bytes and inserting a corresponding flag in the trailer.

===L2 control frames===

In addition to data frames which contain user data, L2 also transmits and receives control frames. The control frames can be distinguished from data frames by three bits in the first symbol. There are two types of control frames:
* One type ("AFC- Acknowledgement and L2 Flow Control", 3 symbols) serves to acknowledge successfully received data frames.
* The other type ("NAC", 2 symbols) notifies the corresponding transmitter that an incorrect frame has been received.
Note that these L2 types of control frames are sent autonomously by L2.

===L2 retransmission===
High speed communication at low power levels can lead to occasional errors in the received data. The Data Link layer contains a protocol to automatically acknowledge correctly received data frames (using AFC control frames) and to actively signal errors that can be detected at L2 (using NAC control frames). The most likely cause of an error at L2 is that a data frame was corrupted at the electrical level (noise, EMI). This results in an incorrect data or control frame checksum at the receiver side and will lead to its automatic retransmission. Note that data frames are acknowledged (AFC) or negatively acknowledged (NAC). Corrupt control frames are detected by timers that monitor expected or required responses.

A bandwidth of 1 Gbit/s and a bit-error rate of 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; at a speed of 1 gigabit/s would imply an error every 1000 seconds or once every 1000th transmitted Gbit. Layer 2 thus automatically corrects these errors at the cost of marginal loss of bandwidth and at the cost of buffer space needed in L2 to store copies of transmitted data frames for possible retransmission or "replay".

===L2 flow control===
Another feature of L2 is the ability for an L2 transmitter to know whether there is buffer space for the data frame at the receiving end. This again relies on L2 control frames (AFC) which allow a receiver to tell the peer's transmitter how much buffer space is available. This allows the receiver to pause the transmitter if needed, thus avoiding receive buffer overflow. Control frames are unaffected by L2 flow control: they can be sent at any time and the L2 receiver is expected to process these at the speed at which they arrive.

===L2 Traffic Classes and arbitration===
UniPro currently supports two priority levels for data frames called Traffic Class 0 (TC0) and Traffic Class 1 (TC1). TC1 has higher priority than TC0. This means that if an L2 transmitter has a mix of TC0 and TC1 data frames to send, the TC1 data frames will be sent first. Assuming that most data traffic uses TC0 and that the network has congestion, this helps ensure that TC1 data frames arrive at their destination faster than TC0 data frames (analogous to emergency vehicles and normal road traffic). Furthermore, L2 can even interrupt or "preempt" an outgoing TC0 data frame to transmit a TC1 data frame. Additional arbitration rules apply to control frames: in essence these receive higher priority than data frames because they are small and essential for keeping traffic flowing.

In a multi-hop network, the arbitration is done within every L2 transmitter at every hop. The Traffic Class assigned to data does not normally change as data progresses through the network. It is up to the applications to decide how to use the priority system.

===L2 single Traffic Class option===
In UniPro version 1.1, an option was introduced to allow simple endpoint devices to implement only one of the two Traffic Classes if they choose to. This can be useful when device designers are more concerned with implementation cost than with control over frame arbitration. The connected L2 peer device detects such devices during the link initialization phase and can avoid using the missing Traffic Class.

===L2 guarantees===
The various L2 mechanisms provide a number of guarantees to higher layer protocols:
* a received data frame will contain the correct payload (checked using a checksum)
* a transmitted data frame will reach the peer's receiver (after potential retransmissions)
* there will be room to accommodate received data frames (L2 flow control)
* the content of a data frame will only be passed once to the upper protocol layer (duplicate data frames are discarded)
* data frames within the same Traffic Class will be received and passed to the upper protocol layers in order
Thus individual links autonomously provide reliable data transfer. This is different from, for example, the widely used [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP protocol]] that detects errors at the endpoints and relies on end-to-end retransmission in case of corrupted or missing data.

==Network Layer (L3)==
[[Image:UniPro network.png|500px|thumb|Example system architecture showing multiple UniPro devices connected via UniPro switches]]

The network layer is intended to route packets through the network toward their destination. Switches within a multi-hop network use this address to decide in which direction to route individual packets. To enable this, a header containing a 7-bit destination address is added by L3 to all L2 data frames. In the example shown in the figure, this allows Device #3 to not only communicate with Device #1, #2 and #5, but also enables it to communicate with Devices #4 and #6.

Version 1.4 of the UniPro spec does not specify the details of a switch, but does specify enough to allow a device to work in a future networked environment.

===L3 addressing===
Although the role of the L3 address is the same as the IP address in packets on the Internet, a UniPro DeviceID address is only 7 bits long. A network can thus have up to 128 different UniPro devices. Note that, as far as UniPro is concerned, all UniPro devices are created equal: unlike PCI Express or USB, any device can take the initiative to communicate with any other device. This makes UniPro a true network rather than a bus with one master.

===L3 packets===
The diagram shows an example of an L3 packet which starts at the first L2 payload byte of an L2 frame and ends at the last L2 payload byte of an L2 frame. For simplicity and efficiency, only a single L3 packet can be carried by one L2 frame. This implies that, in UniPro, the concepts of an L2 Frame, an L3 Packet and an L4 Segment (see below) are so closely aligned that they are almost synonyms. The distinction (and "coloring") is however still made to ensure that the specification can be described in a strictly layered fashion.

===L3 short-header packet structure===

UniPro short-header packets use a single header byte for L3 information. It includes the 7-bit L3 destination address. The remaining bit indicates the short-header packet format. For short-header packets, the L3 source address is not included in the header because it is assumed that the two communicating devices have exchanged such information beforehand ([[connection-oriented]] communication).

===L3 long-header packets===
Long-header packets are intended to be introduced in a future version of the UniPro specification, so their format is undefined (except for one bit) in the current UniPro v1.4 specification. However, UniPro v1.4 defines a hook that allows long-header packets to be received or transmitted by a UniPro v1.4 conformant-device assuming the latter can be upgraded via software. The "long-header trap" mechanism of UniPro v1.4 simply passes the payload of a received L2 data frame (being the L3 packet with its header and payload) to the L3 extension (e.g. software) for processing. The mechanism can also accept L2 frame payload from the L3 extension for transmission. This mechanism aims to allow UniPro v1.4 devices to be able to be upgraded in order to support protocols that require the as-yet undefined long-header packets.

===L3 guarantees===
Although details of switches are still out of scope in the UniPro v1.4 spec, L3 allows UniPro v1.0/v1.1/v1.4 devices to serve as endpoints on a network. It therefore guarantees a number of properties to higher layer protocols:
* that packets will be delivered to the addressed destination device (and packets addressed to non-existent devices are discarded)
* that payload sent by an L3 source to a single L3 destination as a series of one or more short-header packets within a single Traffic Class will arrive in order and with the correct payload (reliability)

==Transport Layer (L4)==
The features of UniPro's Transport layer are not especially complex, because basic communication services have already been taken care of by lower protocol layers. L4 is essentially about enabling multiple devices on the network or even multiple clients within these devices to share the network in a controlled manner. L4's features tend to be roughly comparable to features found in computer networking (e.g. [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]) but that are less commonly encountered in local busses like PCI Express, USB or on-chip busses.

UniPro's L4 also has special significance because it is the top protocol layer in the UniPro specification. Applications are required to use L4's top interface to interact with UniPro and are not expected to bypass L4 to directly access lower layers. Note that the interface at the top of L4 provided for transmitting or receiving data is defined at the behavioral or functional level. This high level of abstraction avoids restricting implementation options. Thus, although the specification contains an annex with a signal-level interface as a non-normative example, a UniPro implementation is not required to have any specific set of hardware signals or software function calls at its topmost interface.

===L4 features===
UniPro's Transport layer can be seen as providing an extra level of addressing within a UniPro device. This
* allows a UniPro device to communicate with another UniPro device using multiple logical data streams (example: sending audio and video and control information separately).
* allows a UniPro device to simultaneously connect to multiple other devices (this requires switches as supported in a [[UniPro#Versions and roadmap|future version of UniPro]]) using multiple logical data streams.
* provides mechanisms to reduce the risk of congestion on the network.
* provides a mechanism to structure a stream of bytes as a stream of messages.
These points are explained in more detail below.

===L4 segments===

An L4 segment, is essentially the payload of an L3 packet. The L4 header, in its short form, consists of just a single byte.
The main field in the short L4 header is a 5-bit "CPort" identifier which can be seen as a sub-address within a UniPro device and is somewhat analogous to the [[TCP and UDP port|port]] numbers used in [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] or [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]. Thus every segment (with a short header) is addressed to a specific CPort of specific UniPro device.

|}

A single bit in the segment header also allows segments to be defined with long segment headers. UniPro v1.4 does not define the structure of such segment formats (except for this single bit). Long header segments may be generated via the long header trap described in the L3 section.

===L4 connections===
UniPro calls a pair of CPorts that communicate with each other a Connection (hence the C in CPort). Setting up a connection means that one CPort has been initialized to create segments which are addressed to a specific L4 CPort of a specific L3 DeviceID using a particular L2 Traffic Class. Because UniPro connections are bidirectional, the destination CPort is also configured to allow data to be sent back to the source CPort.

In UniPro 1.0/1.1 connection setup is implementation specific.

In UniPro v1.4 connection setup is assumed to be relatively static: the parameters of the paired CPorts are configured by setting the corresponding connection Attributes in the local and peer devices using the DME. This will be supplemented by a dynamic connection management protocol in a future version of UniPro.

===L4 flow control===
CPorts also contain state variables that can be used to track how much buffer space the peer or connected CPort has. This is used to prevent the situation whereby a CPort sends segments to a CPort which has insufficient buffer space to hold the data, thus leading to stalled data traffic. Unless resolved fast, this traffic jam at the destination quickly grows into a network-wide gridlock. This is highly undesirable as it can greatly affect network performance for all users or, worse, can lead to deadlock situations. The described L4 mechanism is known as end-to-end flow control (E2E FC) because it involves the endpoints of a connection.

===L4 flow control versus L2 flow control===
L4 flow control is complementary to L2 flow control. Both work by having the transmitter pause until it knows there is sufficient buffer space at the receiver. But L4 flow control works between a pair of CPorts (potentially multiple hops apart) and aims to isolate connections from one another ("virtual wire" analogy). In contrast, L2 flow control is per-hop and avoids basic loss of data due to lack of receiver buffer space.

===L4 flow control applicability===
E2E FC is only possible for connection-oriented communication, but at present UniPro's L4 does not support alternative options. E2E FC is enabled by default but can, however, be disabled. This is not generally recommended.

===L4 safety net===
UniPro provides "safety net" mechanisms that mandate that a CPort absorbs all data sent to it without stalling. If a stall is detected anyway, the endpoint discards the incoming data arriving at that CPort in order to maintain data flow on the network. This can be seen as a form of graceful degradation at the system level: if one connection on the network cannot keep up with the speed of the received data, other devices and other connections are unaffected.

===L4 and Messages===
UniPro L4 allows a connection between a pair of CPorts to convey a stream of so-called messages (each consisting of a series of bytes) rather than a single stream of bytes. Message boundaries are triggered by the application-level protocol using UniPro and are signaled via a bit in the segment header. This End-of-Message bit indicates that the last byte in the L4 segment is the last byte of the application-level message.

UniPro needs to be told by the application where or when to insert message boundaries into the byte stream: the boundaries have no special meaning for UniPro itself and are provided as a service to build higher-layer protocols on top of UniPro. Messages can be used to indicate (e.g. via an interrupt) to the application that a unit of data is complete and can thus be processed. Messages can also be useful as a robust and efficient mechanism to implement resynchronization points in some applications.

UniPro v1.4 introduces the notion of message fragment, a fragment being a portion of a message passed between the application and the CPort. This option can be useful when specifying Applications on top of UniPro that need to interrupt the Message creation based on information from the UniPro stack, e.g., incoming Messages, or backpressure.

===L4 guarantees===
The mechanisms in L4 provide a number of guarantees to upper layer protocols:
* A CPort cannot stall, in the sense that it will always continue to accept data as fast as the link or network can deliver the data.
* If an application bound to CPort of a connection stalls and thus fails (for brief or longer periods) to absorb data, other connections to the same or different devices are unaffected.
* A stream of data sent from one CPort to another will always arrive intact, in order, and with the correct message boundary information if the CPort is able to keep up with the incoming data stream.
* In case the CPort cannot keep up with the incoming data stream, one or more messages may be corrupted (due to missing data) and the receiver is notified about this error condition.
* It is safe for an application-level protocol to wait for a peer's response (e.g. an answer or acknowledgement) to a sent L4 message (e.g. a question or command). But it is unsafe for an application-level protocol to await a peer's response to a sent  partial message.
* The content of received short header packets/segments will always be correct. Although delivery at the long-header trap interface is not guaranteed, a future protocol extension plans to make the delivery of such packets reliable. This protocol extension could be implemented in software on top of the long-header trap.

==Device Management Entity (DME)==
The DME (Device Management Entity) controls the layers in the UniPro stack. It provides access to control and status parameters in all layers, manages the power mode transitions of the Link and handles the boot-up, hibernate and reset of the stack. Furthermore, it provides means to control the peer UniPro stack on the Link.

'''Vaseline''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|æ|s|ə|ˌ|l|iː|n}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Vaseline |title=Definition of Vaseline |publisher=The Free Dictionary |accessdate=7 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Vaseline |title=Define Vaseline |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=7 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Also pronounced with the main stress on the last syllable {{IPAc-en|ˌ|v|æ|s|ə|ˈ|l|iː|n}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is an American brand of [[petroleum jelly]]-based products owned by British-Dutch company [[Unilever]]. Products include plain petroleum jelly and a selection of skin creams, soaps, lotions, cleansers, and [[deodorants]].

In many languages, the word "Vaseline" is used as generic for petroleum jelly; in Portuguese and some Spanish-speaking countries, the Unilever products are called Vasenol.

== History ==
[[Image:VaselineWagon.jpg|thumb|An image from Vaseline company archives]]
The first known reference to the name Vaseline was by the inventor of petroleum jelly, [[Robert Chesebrough]] in his U.S. patent for the process of making petroleum jelly (U.S. Patent 127,568) in 1872.  "I, Robert Chesebrough, have invented a new and useful product from petroleum which I have named Vaseline..."

The name "vaseline" is said by the manufacturer to be derived from [[German language|German]] ''Wasser'' "water" + [[Greek language|Greek]] έλαιον (''elaion'') "olive oil".&lt;ref&gt;[[Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]] (1913)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, Chesebrough went to the oil fields in [[Titusville, Pennsylvania]], and learned of a residue called "rod wax" that had to be periodically removed from oil rig pumps. The oil workers had been using the substance to heal cuts and burns. Chesebrough took samples of the rod wax back to Brooklyn, extracted the usable petroleum jelly, and began manufacturing the medicinal product he called Vaseline.&lt;ref&gt;The History of Vaseline Petroleum Jelly began in the Pennsylvania Oil Fields!, Drake Well Museum pamphlet, copyright 1996 by Holigan Group Ltd, Dallas, Texas&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Vaseline was made by the [[Chesebrough Manufacturing Company]] until the company was purchased by [[Unilever]] in 1987.

== Uses ==
[[File:White Petrolatum1.jpg|thumb|Vaseline in its container]]
{{further|Petroleum jelly#Uses}}
While Vaseline can be used as a lubricant, it can also be used as a moisture insulator for local skin conditions characterized by tissue dehydration.

Vaseline has been reported to be highly-refined, triple-purified and regarded as non-carcinogenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/21/vaseline-petroleum-jelly_n_4136226.html|title=Petroleum Jelly May Not Be As Harmless As You Think|first=Rebecca|last=Adams|date=21 October 2013|accessdate=26 March 2018|work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''WISTA Science and Technology Park''' in [[Berlin-Adlershof]] was founded in 1991 after the dissolution of the [[Academy of Sciences of the German Democratic Republic]] at the same place. Today it covers an area of {{convert|4.2|km2|sqmi}} making it the largest [[science park]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;''Der Spiegel.'' Hamburg 2008,02 (7.1.), S. 38, {{ISSN|0038-7452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The existence of technology centers at Adlershof dates back well into the late 19th and early 20th centuries - the [[Berlin–Görlitz railway]] had reached the Berlin suburb of Adlershof in 1867 and the population increased from 743 in 1875 to 5591 in 1895 following the industrialization in the area. The decision to build the [[Teltow Canal]] (1900 - 1906) furthered the development of businesses in the area between the old town (in the north) and the canal (in the south). In 1909 the [[Johannisthal Air Field]] opened in the west of the area and a number of institutions settled in Adlershof, including the German Research Institute for Aviation (today [[German Aerospace Center]]). During the wars the area was used as a technology development center for aviation and radio telecommunications - for some time the large 36 meter [[radio telescope]] was an icon of the area.

After the total destruction of Berlin 1945 the new Eastern Government decided to move the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin|German Academy of Sciences]] to Adlershof. In 1950 to 1952 the media centers of the [[Deutscher Fernsehfunk]] television broadcaster were built in Adlershof. The aviation field was closed down (as air transport had been moved to [[Berlin-Schönefeld Airport]] a few miles away) and the guards regiment Feliks Dzierzynski (12,000 soldiers) occupied the military buildings.

After the [[German reunification]] almost all institutions at Adlershof were closed down during 1990/1991. The infrastructure was old and not up to date with the technology level of West Germany however the available area had the best premises to build a modern one. Berlin did found the Redevelopment Company Adlershof Ltd (Entwicklungsgesellschaft Adlershof mbH - EGA) in 1991 and it was renamed to WISTA Management Ltd (WISTA-Management GmbH) in 1994 as the plans for a new science and technology park took shape. Since then, it helps developing the cluster partly like a [[business incubator]], with network management, communication and marketing, acceleration of special fields of technology and acquisition of projects, investments and companies.

The name WISTA is not officially explained as an abbreviation although at the time the full name was "WISTA - Wissenschafts- und Wirtschaftsstandort Adlershof" (WISTA - Science and Business Location Adlershof) so that WI-ST-A points to a previous project name "WIssenschaftsSTandort Adlershof" (Science Location Adlershof) while much of the press refers to the area as "Wissenschaftsstadt Adlershof" (Science City Adlershof) leading to the same abbreviation. In fact WISTA was included in the [[Expo 2000]] fairs under the name of "Berlin Adlershof – Stadt für Wissenschaft, Wirtschaft und Medien" (Berlin Adlershof - City of Science, Business and Media) corroborating the correspondence.

At the end of 2007 the redevelopment legislation for Adlershof were lifted. In 2008 the area advanced to the north-west building the Hermann Dörner Avenue (Hermann-Dörner-Allee). In 2011 the tram line was extended to run right through the science and technology park. Today the [[BESSY]] synchrotron is something of an icon for the area. There is still room for extension of the science park using the industrial area along the earlier airfield in the west and the earlier shunting station in the north. Developments plans for a housing project west of the earlier airfield (today a grassland recreational area) have been scrapped with new homes being single and duplex houses.

== Numbers ==
The complete area of the WISTA development area encompasses {{convert|420|ha|acre}}. The Science City as the core area covered {{convert|88.7|ha|acre}}. The Media City stretches for {{convert|19|ha|acre}} as of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adlershof.de/newsview/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=289&amp;cHash=ee2e6f0793|title=Adlershof in Zahlen|date=2001-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Western Union''' or '''Lineman splice''' was developed during the introduction of the [[telegraph]] to mechanically and electrically connect wires that were subject to loading stress. The wrapping pattern is designed to cause the termination to tighten as the conductors pull against each other. This type of [[Electrical wiring|splice]] is more suited to solid, rather than [[stranded wire|stranded conductors]].&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://workmanship.nasa.gov/guidadv_recmeth_wusplice.jsp|title=Western Union/Lineman Splice|publisher=NASA Workmanship Technical Committee|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801165108/http://workmanship.nasa.gov/guidadv_recmeth_wusplice.jsp|archivedate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western Union Splice is made by twisting two ends of a wire together, traditionally [[counterclockwise]], 3/4 of a turn each, finger tight. Then, usually using [[needle-nose pliers]], the ends are twisted at least five more turns, tightly. The cut off ends are pushed close to the center wire.

"Short tie" and "long tie" variations exist, mainly for purposes of coating the connection with [[solder]]. The longer version may aid in solder flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharp|first=John MacLaren|title=Practical Electric Wiring|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i41RAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA13|year=1916|publisher=D. Appleton and Company|location=New York and London|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA tests on 22 and 16 [[American wire gauge|AWG]] wire showed that the Western Union Splice when soldered is very strong and is stronger than the wire alone if done properly.&lt;ref name="NASA" /&gt;

'''''Wolffia arrhiza''''' is a species of flowering plant known by the common names '''spotless watermeal''' and '''rootless duckweed''', belonging to the [[Araceae]], a family rich in water-loving species, such as ''[[Arum]]'' and ''[[Pistia]]''.

The green part of the plant, the frond, is a sphere measuring about 1&amp;nbsp;mm wide, but with a flat top that floats at the water's surface. It has a few parallel rows of [[stoma]]ta.&lt;ref name=pan/&gt; There is no root. The plant produces a minute flower fully equipped with one [[stamen]] and one [[gynoecium|pistil]].
