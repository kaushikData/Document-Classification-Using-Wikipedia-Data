'''Alexander Henderson''' ({{circa|1583}}{{snd}}19 August 1646) was a Scottish theologian, and an important ecclesiastical statesman of his period. He is considered the second founder of the [[Reformed Church]] in Scotland, and its Presbyterian churches are largely indebted to him for the forms of their dogmas and organisation.

==Life==

He was born at ''Criech'' in [[Fife]] (possibly [[Crail]]). He graduated at the [[University of St Andrews]] in 1603, and in 1610 was appointed professor of [[rhetoric]] and philosophy and questor of the faculty of [[arts]]. In 1615 he was presented to the ''living church'' of [[Leuchars]] as their minister. As Henderson was located upon his parish by Archbishop [[George Gledstanes]], and was known to sympathise with [[episcopacy]], his settlement was at first extremely unpopular; but he subsequently changed his views and became a [[Presbyterian]] in doctrine and church government, and one of the most esteemed [[minister of religion|ministers]] in Scotland. He early made his mark as a [[Church of Scotland]] leader, and took an active part in petitioning against the five acts and later against the introduction of a service-book and canons drawn up on the model of the English [[Book of Common Prayer|prayer-book]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Henderson, Alexander|volume=13|pages=266-267|first=Thomas|last=Gilray|first2=Dugald|last2=Macfadyen|author2link=Dugald Macfadyen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 March 1638 the public signing of the [[National Covenant]] began in [[Greyfriars Kirk, Edinburgh|Greyfriars Kirk]], Edinburgh. Henderson was mainly responsible for the final form of this document, which consisted of

# the king's confession drawn up in 1581 by [[John Craig (minister)|John Craig]]
# a recital of the acts of parliament against superstitious and papistical rites
# an elaborate oath to maintain the true reformed religion.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[File:The Signing Of The National Covenant.tiff|thumb|The Signing of the [[National Covenant]]. The Victorian painter [[William Hole (artist)|William Hole]] places Henderson at the centre of events in 1638]]
Owing to the skill shown on this occasion he seems to have been applied to when any manifesto of unusual ability was required. In July of the same year he proceeded to the north to debate on the Covenant with the famous [[Aberdeen]] doctors but he was not well received. [[Robert Baillie]] wrote: "The Voyd church was made fast, and the keys kept by the magistrate".&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Henderson's next public opportunity was in the famous [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Assembly]] which met in [[Glasgow]] on 21 November 1638. He was chosen moderator by acclamation, being, as Baillie says, incomparable the ablest man of us all for all things. [[James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton]], was the king's [[commissioner]]; and when the Assembly insisted on proceeding with the trial of the bishops, he formally dissolved the meeting under pain of treason. Acting on the constitutional principle that the king's right to convene did not interfere with the church's independent right to hold assemblies, they sat till 20 December, deposed all the Scottish bishops, [[excommunicated]] a number of them, repealed all acts favouring episcopacy, and reconstituted the Scottish [[Kirk]] on thorough [[Presbyterian]] principles. During the sitting of this Assembly it was carried by a majority of seventy-five votes that Henderson should be transferred to Edinburgh. He had been at Leuchars for about twenty-three years and was extremely reluctant to leave it.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[File:Alexander Henderson.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Moderator of the General Assembly, 1638]]
While Scotland and England were preparing for the First [[Bishops' Wars|Bishops' War]], Henderson drew up two papers, entitled respectively ''The Remonstrance of the Nobility''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Henderson |first1=Alexander |title=The protestation of the noblemen, barrons, gentlemen, borrowes, ministers, and commons, subscribers of the confession of Faith and Covenant, lately renewed within the kingdome of Scotland, made at the Mercate Crosse of Edinburgh, the 4. of Iulij immediatly after the reading of the proclamation, dated 28.

The First Bishops' War did not last long. At the [[Treaty of Berwick (1639)|Pacification of Birks]] the king virtually granted all the demands of the [[Scottish people|Scots]]. In the negotiations for peace Henderson was one of the Scottish commissioners, and made a very favourable impression on the king.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In 1640 Henderson was elected by the town council rector of [[Edinburgh University]], an office to which he was annually re-elected till his death. The Pacification of Birks had been wrung from the king and the [[Scottish people|Scots]], seeing that he was preparing for the Second Bishops' War, took the initiative and pressed into England so vigorously that [[Charles I of England|Charles]] had again to yield. The maturing of the treaty of peace took a considerable time and Henderson was again active in the negotiations, first at [[Ripon]] (1 October) and afterwards in London. While he was in London he had a personal interview with the king with the view of obtaining assistance for the Scottish universities from money formerly applied to the support of the bishops.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

On Henderson's return to Edinburgh in July 1641 the Assembly was sitting at [[St Andrews]]. To suit the convenience of the [[Parliament of Scotland|parliament]], however, it removed to Edinburgh. Henderson was elected moderator of the Edinburgh meeting. In this Assembly he proposed that a confession of faith, a catechism, a directory for all the parts of the public worship, and a platform of government wherein possibly England and we might agree, should be drawn up. This was unanimously approved and the laborious undertaking was left in Henderson's hands but the notable motion did not lead to any immediate results.

During Charles's second state visit to Scotland in the autumn of 1641, Henderson acted as his chaplain and managed to get the funds, formerly belonging to the bishopric of Edinburgh, applied to the metropolitan university. The following year Henderson, whose policy was to keep Scotland neutral in the war which had now broken out between the king and the parliament, was engaged in corresponding with England on [[ecclesiastical]] topics; and shortly afterwards he was sent to Oxford to mediate between the king and his parliament but his mission proved a failure.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

A memorable meeting of the [[Church of Scotland|General Assembly]] was held in August 1643. Henderson was elected moderator for the third time. He presented a draft of the famous [[Solemn League and Covenant]], which was received with great enthusiasm. Unlike the [[National Covenant]] of 1638, which applied to Scotland only, this document was common to the two kingdoms. Henderson, Baillie, Rutherford and others were sent up to London to represent Scotland in the Assembly at [[Westminster]]. The Solemn League and Covenant, which pledged both countries to the extirpation of prelacy, leaving further decision as to church government to be decided by the example of the best reformed churches, after undergoing some slight alterations passed both parliaments, the [[Parliament of Scotland]] and the [[Parliament of England]], and thus became law for the two kingdoms. By means of it Henderson has had considerable influence on the history of Great Britain. As Scottish commissioner to the [[Westminster Assembly]] he was in England from August 1643 till August 1646 and his principal work was the drafting of the [[Directory of Public Worship|Directory for Public Worship]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Early in 1645 Henderson was sent to the [[Treaty of Uxbridge]] to aid the commissioners of the two parliaments in negotiating with the king but nothing came of the conference. In 1646 the king joined the [[Scottish Army]]; and, after retiring with them to [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]], he sent for Henderson, and discussed with him the two systems of church government in a number of papers. Meanwhile, Henderson was failing in health. He sailed to Scotland, and eight days after his arrival died, on 19 August 1646. He was buried in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]], Edinburgh;&lt;ref&gt;Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Grampian Society, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; the grave lies in the south-west section near the Adam mausoleum. His death was an occasion of national mourning in Scotland.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

On 7 August Baillie had written that he had heard that Henderson was dying of heartbreak. A document was published in London purporting to be a declaration of Mr Alexander Henderson made upon his death-bed and, although this paper was disowned, denounced and shown to be false in the General Assembly of August 1648, the document was used by Clarendon as giving the impression that Henderson had recanted. Its foundation was probably certain expressions lamenting Scottish interference in English affairs.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The '''alvars''', also spelt as '''alwars''' or '''azhwars''' (''āḻvārkaḷ'' {{IPA-ta|aːɻʋaːr|}}, [[Tamil language|Tamil]] : ஆழ்வார்கள் ‘those immersed in god’) were [[Tamil people|Tamil]] poet-saints of [[South India]] who espoused [[bhakti]] (devotion) to the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Vishnu]] or his [[avatar]] [[Krishna]] in their songs of longing, ecstasy and service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mahavidya.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Nippard-Andrea-The-Alvars-Yes.pdf |title=The Alvars |author=Andrea Nippard |accessdate=2013-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001609/http://www.mahavidya.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Nippard-Andrea-The-Alvars-Yes.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are venerated especially in [[Vaishnavism]], which regards Vishnu or Krishna as the Supreme Being.

Many modern academics place the Alvars date between 5th century to 10th century CE, however traditionally the Alvars are considered to have lived between 4200 BCE - 2700 BCE. Orthodoxy posits the number of alvars as ten, though there are other references that include [[Andal]] and [[Madhurakavi Alvar]], making the number twelve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flood|1996|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andal is the only female saint-poet in the 12 Alvars. Together with the contemporary sixty three [[Shaiva]] [[Nayanars]], they are among the most important saints from Tamil Nadu.

The devotional outpourings of Alvars, composed during the early medieval period of [[History of Tamil Nadu|Tamil history]], helped revive the [[bhakti movement]], through their hymns of worship to Vishnu and his avatars. They praised the [[Divya Desam]]s, 108 "abodes" (temples) of these Vaishnava deities. The poetry of the Alvars echoes bhakti to God through love, and in the ecstasy of such devotions they sang hundreds of songs which embodied both depth of feeling and felicity of expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Literature Through the Ages |url=http://ccrtindia.gov.in/literaryarts.htm |publisher=Indian literature , Govt of India |accessdate=2013-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515213735/http://ccrtindia.gov.in/literaryarts.htm |archivedate=15 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection of their hymns is known as ''[[Divya Prabandha]]''. The Bhakti literature that sprang from Alvars has contributed to the establishment and sustenance of a culture that broke away from the ritual-oriented Vedic religion and rooted itself in devotion as the only path for salvation. In addition they helped to make the Tamil religious life independent of a knowledge of [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref name="About Alvars"&gt;{{cite web

==Etymology==
{{Hinduism}}
The word ''azhwar'' has traditionally been etymologized as from Tamil. 'Azh' (ஆழ்), 'to immerse oneself' as 'one who dives deep into the ocean of the countless attributes of god'&lt;ref name="Etymology"&gt;{{cite web| 
title=''Meaning of Alvar''
| publisher=ramanuja.org|
url=http://www.ramanuja.org/sv/alvars/|
accessdate= 2007-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However recently Indologist S.Palaniappan has shown that what was originally Āļvār (ஆள்வார்) meaning 'One who rules', or '(Spiritual) Master' got changed through hypercorrection and folk etymology to Āzhvār (ஆழ்வார்) meaning 'One who is immersed'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alvar or Nayanar : The Role of Sound Variation, Hypercorrection and Folk Etymology in Interpreting the Nature of Vaisnava Saint-Poets|publisher= South-Indian Horizons, Institut Francais de Pondichéry (French Institute of Pondicherry)|year= 2005|url=http://www.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~chevilla/FestSchrift/supa_9d.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palaniappan cites inscriptional evidence and even literary evidence from [[Vaishnavaite]] tradition itself for a gradual sound change from āļvār to āzhvār over a period of two centuries from the 9th to the 11th century involving references to religious leaders in Vaishnavism, Shaivism and even Jainism and to political personalities. He states: "āzhvār is but a corrupt form of āļvār which has been used interchangeably
with  nāyanār in secular and religious contexts in the Tamil land" and "... Notwithstanding the Vaishnava claim of unbroken teacher-student tradition, the fact that Nathamuni has used the form āļvār but Piļļān [A disciple and younger cousin of Rāmānuja] ended up using the form  āzhvār suggests that there has been an error in transmission somewhere along the teacher-student chain between the two teachers. This error was obviously due to the influence of the sound variation that has occurred in the Srirangam area and elsewhere".

The original word ஆள்வார் compares with the epithet 'Āṇḍãḷ' ((ஆண்டாள்) for the female canonized Vaishnava saint Gōdai (கோதை) and they share the same verb Tamil. āḷ (ஆள்), the former being the honorific non-past (or present-future) form and the latter the feminine past form of that same verb.

Alvars are considered the twelve supreme devotees of [[Vishnu]], who were instrumental in popularising [[Vaishnavism]] in the Tamil-speaking regions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#B.S.|B.S.]] 2011, p. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt; The alvars were influential in promoting the [[Bhagavata]] cult and the two Hindu epics, namely, [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabaratha]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#B.S.|B.S.]] 2011, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The religious works of these saints in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], songs of love and devotion, are compiled as ''[[Nalayira Divya Prabandham]]'' containing 4000 verses and the 108 temples revered in their songs are classified as ''[[Divya desam]]''.&lt;ref name="Rao"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalal21"&gt;[[#Dalal|Dalal]] 2011, pp. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; The verses of the various ''azhwars'' were compiled by [[Nathamuni]] (824 - 924 CE), a 10th-century Vaishnavite theologian, who called it the "Dravida Veda or Tamil Veda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of Indian Literatures: Beginnings-1850 Volume 1 of A Dictionary of Indian Literature, A Dictionary of Indian Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCJrUfVtZxoC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=poygai&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=50R0UaefIZGy9gSDt4DoCA&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=poygai&amp;f=false|page=15|last=Mukherjee|publisher=Orient Blackswan|year=1999|isbn=9788125014539}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garg"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World: Ak-Aq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WjDcd0cTFxQC&amp;pg=PA352&amp;dq=poygai&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mdR1Uf-hOePR0wH1u4DYAw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwADge#v=onepage&amp;q=poygai&amp;f=false|pages=352–354|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|last=Garg|first=Gaṅgā Rām|year=1992|isbn=9788170223757}}&lt;/ref&gt; The songs of ''Prabandam'' are regularly sung in all the Vishnu temples of South India daily and also during festivals.&lt;ref name="Dalal21"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the Tamils|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H4q0DHGMcjEC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=poygai&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mdR1Uf-hOePR0wH1u4DYAw&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBjge#v=onepage&amp;q=poygai&amp;f=false|page=211|last=Ramaswamy|first=Vijaya|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2007|isbn=9780810864450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The saints had different origins and belonged to different castes. As per tradition, the first three alvars, Poigai, Bhutha and Pey were born miraculously. Tirumizhisai was the son of a sage; Thondaradi, Mathurakavi, Peria and Andal were from [[brahmin]] [[caste]]; Kulasekhara was a [[Kshatria]], Namm was from a cultivator family, Tirupana from ''[[Tamil Panar]]'' community and Tirumangai from ''kazhwar'' community. ''Divya Suri Saritra'' by Garuda-Vahana Pandita (11th century), ''Guruparamparaprabavam'' by Pinbaragiya Perumal Jiyar, ''Periya tiru mudi adaivu'' by Anbillai Kandadiappan, ''Yatindra Pranava Prabavam'' by Pillai Lokacharya, commentaries on ''Divya Prabandam'', Guru Parampara (lineage of Gurus) texts, temple records and inscriptions give a detailed account of the alavars and their works. According to these texts, the saints were considered incarnations of some form of Vishnu.

According to traditional account by [[Manavala Mamunigal]], the first three ''azhwars'' namely Poigai, Bhoothath and Pey belong to ''[[Dwapara Yuga]]'' (before 4200 BCE). It is widely accepted by tradition and historians that the trio are the earliest among the twelve azhwars.&lt;ref name="Rao"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rao|first=P.V.L.

==Summary==

Some modern scholars suggest that they lived during 5th - 9th century CE, "on the basis of a few historical evidences", although no "clear" evidence exists to fit them between 5th to 9th century CE.&lt;ref name="Chari"&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=8TwHhuZrZ-wC Philosophy and Theistic Mysticism of the Āl̲vārs]", by S.

Traditionally the Alvars are considered to have lived between 4200 BCE - 2700 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=8TwHhuZrZ-wC Philosophy and Theistic Mysticism of the Āl̲vārs]", by S.

The following table shows the place, century and star of birth of each Alvar. Scholarly dating, except that of Kulasekhara Alvar, is based on summary of views of modern scholars by Dr. N Subba Reddiar, although even these dates lack historical evidence.&lt;ref name="Chari"/&gt; Much effort has went into dating Kulasekhara Alvar recently. The Alvar is now identified as Sthanu Ravi Kulasekhara (reigned 844—883 CE), the second known ruler of the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]] of Makotai ([[Cranganore]]) (''c.'' 800—1124 CE).&lt;ref&gt;[[M. G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9294">'''Andrew Oscar Jászi''' ({{lang-hu|Jászi András Oszkár}}; March 1, 1917 – June 22, 1998) was a Hungarian-born philosopher and literary scholar. He taught as professor of German at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], from 1948 to 1984.

== Biography ==

Jászi was born in Budapest into a distinguished family of assimilated Jews. His father, [[Oszkár Jászi]], was a sociologist, historian, and politician who served as Minister of Nationalities in [[Mihály Károlyi]]'s cabinet during the [[Hungarian Democratic Republic]] of 1918–19 before moving to the United States in 1925 to join the faculty of [[Oberlin College]] as Professor of Political Science. Andrew Jászi’s mother, [[Anna Lesznai]], was a well-known artist and writer.

After his parents’ divorce in 1919, Jászi moved with his mother and brother George (1915–1992) to [[Vienna]], where he received his primary school education. This was followed by a return to Budapest in 1931 and enrollment in the Deutsche Oberschule (“German High School”).&lt;ref&gt;Hinrich Seeba, "Andrew O. Jászi," ''Internationales Germanisten-Lexikon 1800–1950'', 3 vol., Christoph König, ed. (Berlin, New York: de Gruyter 2003), pp. 841-842.&lt;/ref&gt;  As was typical of those of his background, he was raised bilingual in Hungarian and German, though German remained the primary language of his intellectual work throughout his life.

He finished high school in 1935, then came to the United States to join his father at Oberlin where he earned his B.A. in German in 1938. From there, he went to Harvard to begin his doctoral studies. Drafted into the U.S. army in 1942, he was dispatched to serve as an intelligence officer with the occupation forces in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Seeba, pp. 841-842.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jászi completed his Ph.D. in German at Harvard in 1947.  He was hired the following year by the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught classes in German literature until his retirement in 1984.  He died at his home in Oakland, California, in 1998.

== Academic career ==

Jászi enjoyed a campus-wide reputation as an outstanding teacher. Recognized as “one of the most respected critics of German literature in the United States” as well as “one of the most beloved professors of the University,”&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Larson, "Faculty Profile: Andrew Jaszi of the German Department burns with an idealism that purifies," ''California Monthly'', November 1966, pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; he developed an original style of teaching that was rigorous yet also accessible to the non-specialist. 
Methodologically, he favored what has been termed “an ontological approach”;&lt;ref&gt;Larson, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; pedagogically, he incorporated Socratic dialogue and what, for lack of a better word, may be called “lecture.”&lt;ref&gt;"Some say a Jászi lecture is like a poem, others a prayer.  His manner while lecturing often resembles a person protected from external reality by a trance-like shell.  The intensity of his concentration is felt by everyone in the room." Larson, 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  In all this, he brought to his classes, and was capable of eliciting from his students, an exceptional degree of personal engagement.

Among his former students who have credited his influence are [[W. Michael Blumenthal]],&lt;ref&gt;W. Michael Blumenthal, ''In achtzig Jahren um die Welt. Mein Leben.'' (Berlin: Ullstein Buchverlage, 2012), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Secretary of Treasury under President Jimmy Carter (and later, Director of the [[Jewish Museum, Berlin]]); and philosopher and Jungian theorist [[Wolfgang Giegerich]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Giegerich, "Uma Conversa com Wolfgang Gieguerich," ''Cadernos Junguianos'' (Associação Junguiana do Brasil), Issue 1 (2015). p. 59ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jászi was a well-known authority on [[Goethe]]. Other authors he specialized in were [[Kleist]], [[ETA Hoffmann]], [[Rilke]], [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]], and [[Kafka]].  His scholarly research also extended more broadly, leading to courses on nineteenth- and twentieth-century poetry and drama, fairy tales, and psychological approaches to literature (especially [[Jung]]).

In addition to teaching at Berkeley, Jászi held positions as visiting professor at the University of Washington (1959–60), Harvard (1960), University of Colorado (1963) and University of Michigan (1965).

In recognition of his achievements, he was awarded the Berkeley Citation, one of the campus’s highest honors, in 1984.

== Philosophical work ==

Alongside his career as Professor of German Literature, Jászi spent much of his adult life working on a massive philosophical project dealing with fundamental questions of being and knowing, especially—but not only—in the area of aesthetics.  These investigations, [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] in nature and method, treat such concepts as being, consciousness, time and space, change and motion, identity and difference, subject and object, part and whole.

Portions of these investigations were published in essay form throughout the 1950s and 60s, followed by a book-length monograph in 1974.  Titled ''Erkenntnis und Wirklichkeit.  Grundlagenkritische Voruntersuchungen''  (“Knowledge and Reality: Foundationally Critical Preliminary Investigations”), it is a radical condensation of the first half of a manuscript of over five-thousand pages, his magnum opus.  Left unfinished and unpublished at his death, it is presently in private hands.&lt;ref&gt;Seeba, 842.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Beneficium inventarii''''' (literally '''benefit of the inventory''') is a [[legal doctrine]] introduced into [[Roman law]] by [[Justinian I]] to limit the [[legal liability|liability]] of [[Beneficiary|heirs]] resulting from an [[Insolvency|insolvent]] [[Estate (law)|estate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/b/beneficium-inventarii/ Definition at USLegal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine, which is in force today in many [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law systems]], applies to both [[Will (law)|wills]] and [[Intestacy|intestate]] successions. An heir may accept a succession under ''beneficium inventarii'' without being liable for the debts attaching to the estate or to the claims of [[Will (law)|legatees]] beyond the estate's value as previously determined by inventory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3603">'''Benjamin Apthorp Gould Fuller''' (March 9, 1879 in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] – March 15, 1956 in [[Taxco|Taxco, Mexico]]) was a philosopher, author of ''A History of Philosophy'', and president of the [[American Philosophical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prometheusbooks.com/catalog/book_1783.html Presidential Addresses of the American Philosophical Association, Volume 5 (1941-1950)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415172019/http://www.prometheusbooks.com/catalog/book_1783.html |date=April 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;Obituaries - Los Angeles Times |date=1956-03-21&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also known and published as B.A.G. Fuller.

He was the son of [[Horace Williams Fuller]] and Emily Gorham Carter.  He studied at [[Roxbury Latin School]] in Roxbury, Massachusetts, and received his B.A., A.M., and Ph.D. from [[Harvard University]] in 1900, 1902, and 1906, respectively.  In 1902 he matriculated at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], and received his B.Sc. in 1905.  His Ph.D. thesis on "The Problem of Evil in [[Plotinus]]" was published in 1912.  He was described as "a representative of [[Epicureanism]] at its best."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nQczAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA452 |title=A Companion to Meister Eckhart |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2012-12-07|accessdate=2014-02-15|isbn=9789004236929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller taught philosophy at Harvard from 1906 to 1910.  In 1910 he traveled around the world, visiting Kashmir, northern and central India, Assam, Burma, Java, and Japan, developing "the habit of never taking a ticket further than the next stop, and came to the realization that life is much too short to hurry."&lt;ref&gt;''Harvard College Class of 1900, Twenty-fifth anniversary report'' (Cambridge, MA: University Press, 1925), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was commissioned as an infantry captain in the United States Army during World War I and served from 1917 to 1919.  During this time, he was assigned to the staff of [[Tasker H. Bliss|General Tasker H. Bliss]] in the American Section of the [[Supreme War Council]] at Versailles from January 1918 to June 1919.  He was awarded the [[Ordine della Corona d'Italia]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Adjutant General Military Records, 1631-1976, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923 Henry Holt &amp; Co. published his ''History of Greek Philosophy, Thales to Democritus.''

He was a professor and fellow at the Graduate School of the [[University of Cincinnati]], where he began teaching in 1924.  He was subsequently a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Southern California]] from 1933 to 1941.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

'''Bernard Dubourg''' (20 August 1945 - 20 December 1992) was a French poet, professor of philosophy, translator and Hebrew scholar.

Bernard Dubourg published in ''[[Tel Quel]]'' and ''PO&amp;SIE''. He wrote several books of poetry, and translated the poetry of [[J. H. Prynne]]. He also translated studies of the [[Samaritans]] by [[James Alan Montgomery]] and [[Moses Gaster]], ''On the superiority of women'' by [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]], and published an annotated translation of the ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]''.

His two-volume work on the [[New Testament]] argued that the Greek text was originally composed in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], according to the traditional procedures of [[midrash]]. Following Paul Vulliaud, Dubourg emphasised the importance of [[gematria]] in showing the coherence of his back-translated text.

'''Brie Gertler''' is an American philosopher who works primarily on problems in the [[philosophy of mind]].  A [[Mind-body dualism|mind-body dualist]], she is Commonwealth Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Virginia]].  Her special interests include [[introspection]], [[consciousness]] and mental content.

She has edited ''Privileged Access'' (2003), an anthology of papers on self-knowledge, and co-edited (with [[Lawrence Shapiro]])  "Arguing about the Mind" (2007), a reader in the philosophy of mind.

==Education and employment==
Gertler has written numerous papers on her research and is a seasoned book reviewer.  She received a BA with High Honors in Philosophy from [[Swarthmore College]] in June 1989 and an MA at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] three years later.  In June 1997, she was granted a PhD by [[Brown University]].

Gertler first found employment as an assistant professor at [[The College of William &amp; Mary]], where she worked from 1997 to 2001, before moving on to the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], where she earned tenure. She moved to her University of Virginia position in 2004.

=="In Defense of Mind-Body Dualism"==
To the thirteenth edition of the [[Joel Feinberg]]- and [[Russ Shafer-Landau]]-edited ''Reason &amp; Responsibility'', Gertler contributed a paper in support of dualism.  It explored the fundamentals of the mind-body problem and defended her philosophy against charges of "spookiness".  Her argument is founded on the claim that, in feeling pain, we know the essence of the mental state of pain.

===Anselm of Canterbury===
{{Main|Anselm of Canterbury}}
[[File:Anselm of Canterbury.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A colourised 16th-century portrait of Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury]]
Saint Anselm of Canterbury (c. 1033 – 1109) was an important philosopher and theologian of the Catholic Church, who held the office of [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] from 1093 to 1109. Anselm is famed as the originator of the ontological argument for the existence of God and of the satisfaction theory of atonement. Anselm's works are considered philosophical as well as theological since they endeavour to render Christian tenets of faith, traditionally taken as a revealed truth, as a rational system.{{sfnp|Davies &amp; al.|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8zGpbpwRhIC&amp;pg=PA2 2]}}

===William of Sherwood===
{{Main|William of Sherwood}}
William of Sherwood ({{circa|lk=no|1200|1272}}) was a [[medieval]] [[English people|English]] [[scholastic philosopher]], [[logician]], and teacher. Little is known of his life, but he is thought to have studied in [[Paris]] and he was a master at [[Oxford]] in 1252.  He was the author of two books which were an important influence on the development of [[scholastic logic]]: ''Introductiones in Logicam'' (Introduction to Logic), and ''[[Syncategorematic term|Syncategoremata]]''. These are the first known works to deal in a systematic way with what is now called [[supposition theory]], and were influential on the development of logic in both England and on the continent.  According to [[Roger Bacon]], Sherwood was among "the more famous wise men of Christendom", of whom he names another as [[Albertus Magnus]].  Bacon judged Sherwood to be "much wiser than Albert".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Bacon |author-first=Roger |chapter=Preface |title=Fr.

===Roger Bacon===
{{Main|Roger Bacon}}
Roger Bacon (c. 1214–1294), also known as Doctor Mirabilis ([[Latin]]: "Wondrous Doctor"), was an [[England|English]] [[philosopher]] and [[Franciscan]] friar who placed considerable emphasis on empirical methods. He is sometimes credited as one of the earliest [[Europe]]an advocates of the modern [[scientific method]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Introduction to Forensic Engineering | author =  Randall Noon | publisher =   CRC Press | year = 1992 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=ru_E__W7euUC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=roger-bacon+scientific-method | isbn = 0-8493-8102-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the works of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] via early [[Islamic science|Islamic scientists]] such as [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]].&lt;ref&gt;Glick, Thomas F.; Livesey, Steven John; Wallis, Faith: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SaJlbWK_-FcC&amp;pg=PA424&amp;dq=roger-bacon+muslim+arabic+islamic+translation&amp;ei=zaw-SYGICYeKNJzK-MEG Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia]'', first edition, Routledge, September 29, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-415-96930-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moorstein, Mark: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=36g9_8MX53cC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=firnas+bacon&amp;sig=tC8mV6aqxryvkGPQAtuWH7uVp1w Frameworks: Conflict in Balance]'', page 237, iUniverse, Inc., June 9, 2004, 308 pp, {{ISBN|978-0-595-31824-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Democracy in Islam | author = Sayed Khatab and Gary D.

===Duns Scotus===
{{Main|Duns Scotus}}
John Duns Scotus (c. 1265 – 8 November 1308) was an important philosopher and theologian of the [[High Middle Ages]]. Scotus was born around 1265,&lt;ref&gt;Brampton 'Duns Scotus at Oxford, 1288-1301', Franciscan Studies, 24 (1964) 17.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Duns]], in [[Berwickshire]], [[Scotland]]. In 1291 he was ordained as a priest in [[Northampton, England|Northampton]], [[England]]. A note in Codex 66 of [[Merton College, Oxford]], records that Scotus "flourished at [[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]], [[Oxford, England|Oxford]] and [[Paris]]". He died in [[Cologne]] in 1308. He is buried in the "Minoritenkirche", the Church of the [[Franciscans]] (or Minor Friars) in Cologne. He was [[beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 20 March 1993.

Nicknamed ''Doctor Subtilis'' (''the subtle doctor''), he is well known for the "univocity of being," the formal distinction, and the idea of [[haecceity]].  The univocity of being holds that existence is the most abstract concept we have and is applicable to everything that exists. The formal distinction is a way of distinguishing between different aspects of the same thing such that the distinction is intermediate between what is merely conceptual, and what is fully real or mind-independent. Haecceity (from the [[Latin]] ''haecceitas'') is the idea of "thisness," a concept which denotes the discrete qualities, properties or characteristics of a thing which make it a particular thing.

===William of Ockham===
{{Main|William of Ockham}}
William of Ockham (c. 1288 – c. 1348) was an [[England|English]] [[Franciscan]] [[friar]] and [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] [[philosopher]]. He is perhaps most well known for his principle of parsimony, famously known as [[Occam's razor]].  This actual term is claimed not to appear in his writings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2013/02/11/what-ockham-really-said.html |title=What Ockham really said |publisher=Boing Boing |date=2013-02-11 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rather summarizes the principle he expressed in passages such as ''[[q:William of Occam|Numquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necessitate]] [Plurality must never be posited without necessity]''&lt;ref&gt;'Sentences of Peter Lombard', ''Quaestiones et decisiones in quattuor libros Sententiarum Petri Lombardi'' (ed. Lugd., 1495), i, dist. 27, qu. 2, K)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/424706/Ockhams-razor |title=Ockham's razor |year=2010 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora (It is futile to do with more things that which can be done with fewer)''.&lt;ref&gt;''Summa Totius Logicae'', i. 12, Thorburn, 1918, pp.352–53; [[William Kneale (logician)|Kneale]] and Kneale, 1962, p.243.)&lt;/ref&gt; Generally it refers to distinguishing between two hypotheses either by "shaving away" unnecessary assumptions or cutting apart two similar conclusions.

The words often attributed to Occam: ''entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem ("entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity")'' are absent in his extant works;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Flew, Antony|author-link= Antony Flew|year=1979|title=A Dictionary of Philosophy|location=London|publisher=Pan Books}} p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;  This particular phrasing comes from [[John Punch (theologian)|John Punch]] who used it in describing a "common axiom" (''axioma vulgare'') of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alistair Cameron Crombie]] (1959), ''Medieval and Early Modern Philosophy'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard, Vol. 2, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis Bacon (1561–1626) was an Englishman who was a [[politician|statesman]], [[scientist]], [[lawyer]], [[jurist]] and [[author]] in addition to being a philosopher. He famously died of pneumonia contracted while studying the effects of freezing on the preservation of meat.  He served both as [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] and [[Lord Chancellor]] of England. Although his political career ended in disgrace, he remained extremely influential through his works, especially as philosophical advocate and practitioner of the [[scientific method]] and pioneer in the [[scientific revolution]].

Bacon has been called the father of empiricism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychology.sbc.edu/Empiricism.htm Home | Sweet Briar College] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708000000/http://www.psychology.sbc.edu/Empiricism.htm |date=July 8, 2013 }}. Psychology.sbc.edu. Retrieved on 2013-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt; His works established and popularized deductive methodologies for [[science|scientific]] inquiry, often called the ''[[Baconian method]]'' or simply, the [[scientific method]]. His demand for a planned procedure of investigating all things natural marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, much of which still surrounds conceptions of proper [[methodology]] today. His dedication probably led to his death, so bringing him into a rare historical group of scientists who were killed by their own experiments.

===Thomas Hobbes===
{{Main|Thomas Hobbes}}
Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) was an English philosopher, remembered today for his work on [[political philosophy]]. His 1651 book ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' established the foundation for most of Western political philosophy from the perspective of [[social contract]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Hobbes's Moral and Political Philosophy |encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hobbes-moral/}} . Retrieved March 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes was a  champion of absolutism for the sovereign but he also developed some of the fundamentals  of European liberal thought: the right of the individual; the natural equality of all men; the artificial character of the political order (which led to the later distinction between [[civil society]] and the state); the view that all legitimate political power must be "representative" and based on the consent of the people; and a liberal interpretation of  law which  leaves people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Manent, ''An Intellectual History of Liberalism'' (1994) pp 20–38&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes also contributed to a diverse array of fields, including [[history]], [[geometry]], physics of [[gas]]es, [[theology]], [[ethics]], general philosophy, and [[political science]]. His account of human nature as self-interested cooperation has proved to be an enduring theory in the field of [[philosophical anthropology]]. He was one of the key founders of philosophical [[materialism]].

===The classic trio of British empiricists===
The three 'classic' British [[empiricism|empiricists]] in the early modern era were John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume. The term "British empiricism" refers to the philosophical tradition in Britain that was epitomised by these thinkers (though this tradition did have precursors in Britain stretching back to [[Roger Bacon]]). Berkeley, despite being Irish, was referred to as British as [[County Kilkenny]], where he lived in [[Ireland]], was a part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] at the time.

====John Locke====
{{Main|John Locke}}
[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|John Locke]]
John Locke (1632–1704) was an empiricist at the beginning of the [[Modern philosophy|Modern period]] of philosophy.  As such (and in contrast to [[René Descartes]]), he held that all of the objects of the understanding are ideas, where ideas exist in the mind.  One of his goals in his work ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' is to trace the origin of ideas.  There are no innate ideas “stamped upon the mind” from birth, and all knowledge is rooted in experience.  Further, there are also ''simple ideas'' and ''complex ideas''.  Simple ideas enter by the senses, and they are simple and unmixed.  Complex ideas are simple ideas that have been combined and related together using the abstracting activity of the mind.

Locke is also responsible for an early theory of [[personal identity]]. He thought that our being the same person from one time to another consists, not in our having the same soul or the same body, but rather the same series of psychological connections. For Locke, to be a person is to be an intelligent thinking being that can know itself as itself, the same thinking thing in different times and places.

====George Berkeley====
{{Main|George Berkeley}}
George Berkeley (1685–1753) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] philosopher who served as [[Bishop of Cloyne]] from 1734 until his death.  He was a British [[Empiricism|empiricist]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/berkeley/ Berkeley, George] – [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Immaterialism|immaterialist]], and an [[idealism|idealist]]. Many of his most important ideas were first put forth in ''[[A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'', a work which was critical of John Locke's philosophy.  Berkeley agreed with Locke that there was an outside world which caused the ideas within the mind, but Berkeley sought to prove that the outside world was also composed solely of ideas. Berkeley thought that the ideas that we possessed could only resemble other ideas (not physical objects) and thus the external world consisted not of physical form, but rather of ideas. This world was given logic and regularity by some other force, which Berkeley concluded was God.

Berkeley is famous for his motto ''"esse est percipi aut percipere"'', or otherwise, ''"to exist is to be perceived, or to perceive"''.  This means that there are no things other than ideas and the minds that house them.  There is no such thing as a mind-independent entity.

====David Hume====
{{Main|David Hume}}
{{See also|Scottish Enlightenment}}
David Hume (1711–1776) was a Scottish [[philosopher]], [[economist]], and [[historian]].  His major works, ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' (1739–1740), the ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1748), ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'' (1751), and ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779) remain widely influential.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/ "David Hume" at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Retrieved May 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas regarding free will and determinism, causation, personal identity, induction, and morality still inspire discussion.

Hume famously described the [[problem of induction]]. He argues that [[inductive reasoning]] cannot be rationally employed, since, in order to justify induction, one would either have to provide a sound deductive argument or an inductively strong argument.  But there is no sound deductive argument for induction, and to ask for an inductive argument to justify induction would be to [[Begging the question|beg the question]].

Hume's problem of causation is related to his problem of induction. He held that there is no empirical access to the supposed necessary connection between cause and effect. In seeking to justify the belief that A causes B, one would point out that, in the past, B has always closely followed A in both space and time. But the special necessary connection that is supposed to be causation is never given to us in experience.  We only observe a constant conjunction of events, with no necessity whatsoever.

In personal identity, Hume was a [[bundle theory|bundle theorist]].  He said that there is no robust self to which properties adhere.  Experience only shows us that there is only a bundle of perceptions.

===Adam Smith===
{{Main|Adam Smith}}
Adam Smith (1723–1790) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Ethics|moral philosopher]] and a pioneer of [[political economy|political economics]]. Smith wrote ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' and ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]''. The latter, usually abbreviated as ''The Wealth of Nations'', is considered his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' and the first modern work of [[economics]]. Smith is widely cited as the father of modern economics.

Smith studied [[moral philosophy]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] and the [[University of Oxford]]. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at [[Edinburgh]], leading him to collaborate with [[David Hume]] during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at [[Glasgow]] teaching moral philosophy, and during this time he wrote and published ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments''.

==19th century==

===Jeremy Bentham===
{{Main|Jeremy Bentham}}
Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) is well known for beginning the tradition of classical utilitarianism in Britain.  [[Utilitarianism]] is a [[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] theory of [[normative ethics]] which holds that an act is morally right if and only if that act maximizes happiness or pleasure.  Classical utilitarianism is said to be hedonistic because it regards pleasure as the only intrinsic good and pain as the only intrinsic evil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/ "Consequentialism" at Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Retrieved April 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilitarianism was described by Bentham as "the ''greatest happiness'' or ''greatest felicity'' principle".&lt;ref name="BenthamIntroductiontothePrinciples"&gt;AN INTRODUCTION TO THE PRINCIPLES OF MORALS AND LEGISLATION, Jeremy Bentham, 1789 (“printed” in 1780, “first published” in 1789, "corrected by the Author" in 1823.)  See Chapter I: Of the Principle of Utility.  For Bentham on animals, see Ch. XVII Note 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham's utilitarianism is known for arguing that the [[felicific calculus]] should be used to determine the rightness and wrongness of acts.  It does this by measuring the amount of pain and pleasure for various acts.  Bentham thought that pleasure and pain be broke down in distinct units called hedons and dolors.

===John Stuart Mill===
{{Main|John Stuart Mill}}
[[File:John Stuart Mill by London Stereoscopic Company, c1870.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|John Stuart Mill]]
John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) was an influential contributor to [[social theory]], [[political theory]], and [[political economy]]. His conception of  [[liberty]] justified the freedom of the individual in opposition to unlimited state control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title       = John Stuart Mill's ''On Liberty''

| quote       = On Liberty is a rational justification of the freedom of the individual in opposition to the claims of the state to impose unlimited control and is thus a defence of the rights of the individual against the state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mill also continued Bentham's tradition of advancing and defending utilitarianism.  Mill's book ''Utilitarianism'' is a philosophical defense of utilitarianism. The essay first appeared as a series of three articles published in ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'' in 1861; the articles were collected and reprinted as a single book in 1863.

===Henry Sidgwick===
{{Main|Henry Sidgwick}}
Henry Sidgwick (1838–1900) also focused on utilitarian ethics and was one of the founders and first president of the [[Society for Psychical Research]], was a member of the [[Metaphysical Society]], and promoted the [[Female education|higher education of women]].  ''The Methods of Ethics'' is a book on [[utilitarianism]] written by Sidgwick that was first published in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.newschool.edu/het//profiles/sidgwick.htm "Henry Sidgwick, 1838-1900" at The History of Economic Thought  Website] Retrieved April 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' indicates that ''The Methods of Ethics'' "in many ways marked the culmination of the classical utilitarian tradition."  Well-known contemporary utilitarian philosopher [[Peter Singer]] has said that the ''Methods'' "is simply the best book on ethics ever written."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.normativeethics.com/interviews/singer.html Peter Singer - Interview at NormativeEthics.com] Retrieved April 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===British idealism===
{{Main|British idealism}}
As an area of [[absolute idealism]], British idealism was a philosophical movement that was influential in Britain from the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth century. Important representatives included [[T. H. Green]], [[F. H. Bradley]], [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]], [[J. M. E. McTaggart]], [[H. H. Joachim]], [[J. H. Muirhead]], and [[G. R. G. Mure]]. Two British philosophers, [[G. E. Moore]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], were brought up in this tradition and then reacted against it by pioneering [[analytic philosophy]].

==20th century and beyond==

===Analytic philosophy===
Analytic philosophy was based on traditional British empiricism, updated to accommodate the new developments in logic pioneered by German mathematician [[Gottlob Frege]]. It has dominated philosophy in the English-speaking world since the early 20th century.

====G. E. Moore====
{{Main|G. E. Moore}}
[[File:George Edward Moore.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|G. E. Moore]]
George Edward Moore (1873–1958) was an English philosopher. One of the founders of the [[analytic tradition]], he led the British 'revolt against idealism' at the turn of the twentieth century, along with Bertrand Russell - while Russell is better known, he stated that it was in fact Moore who "led the way".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521872720&amp;ss=exc Analytic Philosophy And Return Hegelian Thought :: Philosophy: general interest :: Cambridge University Press]. Cambridge.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore is best known today for his defence of [[ethical non-naturalism]], his emphasis on [[common sense]] in philosophical method, and the [[Moore's paradox|paradox that bears his name]]. He was admired by and influential among other philosophers, and also by the [[Bloomsbury Group]], but is (unlike his  colleague Russell) mostly unknown today outside of academic philosophy. Moore's essays are known for his clear, circumspect writing style, and for his methodical and patient approach to philosophical problems. He was critical of philosophy for its lack of [[Philosophical progress|progress]], which he believed was in stark contrast to the dramatic advances in the [[natural sciences]] since the [[Renaissance]].  He often praised the analytic reasoning of [[Thales of Miletus]], an early Greek philosopher, for his analysis of the meaning of the term "[[landscaping]]".  Moore thought Thales' [[reasoning]] was one of the few historical examples of philosophical inquiry resulting in practical advances.  Among his most famous works are his book ''[http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica Principia Ethica]'', and his essays, "The Refutation of Idealism", "[[A Defence of Common Sense]]", and "A Proof of the External World".

He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1918 to 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/about/the-council/ The Aristotelian Society – The Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bertrand Russell====
{{Main|Bertrand Russell}}
Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) led the British "revolt against [[idealism]]" in the early 1900s, along with G. E. Moore. He was influenced by [[Gottlob Frege]], and was the mentor of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. He is widely held to be one of the 20th century's premier logicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/ "Bertrand Russell" at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philososophy] Retrieved May 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He co-authored, with [[Alfred North Whitehead]], ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', an attempt to derive all mathematical truths from a set of [[axiom]]s using [[rule of inference|rules of inference]] in [[symbolic logic]]. His philosophical essay "[[On Denoting]]" has been considered a "paradigm of philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Ludlow, Peter, "Descriptions", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/descriptions/].&lt;/ref&gt; Both works have had a considerable influence on [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[set theory]], [[linguistics]], and philosophy.

Russell's [[theory of descriptions]] has been profoundly influential in the [[philosophy of language]] and the analysis of [[definite description]]s.  His theory was first developed in his 1905 paper "On Denoting".

Russell was a prominent [[anti-war]] [[activism|activist]]; he championed [[free trade]] and [[anti-imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Richard Rempel|year=1979|title=From Imperialism to Free Trade: Couturat, Halevy and Russell's First Crusade|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=40|issue=3|pages=423–443|doi=10.2307/2709246|jstor=2709246|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bertrand Russell|title=Political Ideals|publisher=Routledge|origyear=1917|year=1988|isbn=0-415-10907-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell went to prison for his pacifist activism during World War I. Later, he campaigned against [[Adolf Hitler]], then criticised [[Stalinist]] [[totalitarianism]], attacked the United States of America's involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], and finally became an outspoken proponent of [[nuclear disarmament]].&lt;ref name="Gallery"&gt;[http://russell.mcmaster.ca/~bertrand/ The Bertrand Russell Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928232717/http://russell.mcmaster.ca/~bertrand/ |date=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, Russell was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], "in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions [[humanitarian]] ideals and [[freethought|freedom of thought]]."&lt;ref name="nobel prize"&gt;The Nobel Foundation (1950).

====A. J. Ayer====
{{Main|A. J. Ayer}}
Sir Alfred Jules Ayer (29 October 1910, London – 27 June 1989, London), better known as A. J. Ayer or "Freddie" to friends, was a British analytic philosopher known for his promotion of [[logical positivism]], particularly in his books ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'' (1936) and ''The Problem of Knowledge'' (1956).

====Ordinary language philosophy====
{{Main|Ordinary language philosophy}}
Ordinary language philosophy is a philosophical school that approaches traditional philosophical problems as rooted in [[:wikt:Misunderstanding|misunderstandings]] that philosophers develop by forgetting what words mean in their everyday use.

This approach typically involves eschewing philosophical theories in favour of close attention to the detail of everyday language. Sometimes also called "Oxford philosophy", it is generally associated with the work of a number of mid-century [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] professors: mainly [[J. L. Austin]], but also [[Gilbert Ryle]], [[H. L. A. Hart]], and [[P.F. Strawson]].

It was a major philosophic school between 1930 and 1970.

===Contemporary times===
Recent British philosophers particularly active in the [[philosophy of religion]] have included [[Antony Flew]], [[C. S. Lewis]], and [[John Hick]].

Important moral and political philosophers have included [[R. M. Hare]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]].

Other recent figures in the British analytic tradition include [[David Wiggins]], [[Derek Parfit]], and [[P. F. Strawson]], who have focused on fields such as [[metaphysics]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[logic]], and the [[philosophy of language]].

The '''''yángsuì''''' 陽燧 or '''sun-mirror''' was an [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient Chinese]] [[burning-mirror]] that concentrates sunlight to ignite tinder and the '''''fāngzhū''''' 方諸 or '''moon-mirror''' was a device that collects nighttime dew by condensation. These two bronze implements are literary metaphors for [[yin and yang]], associating the "''yang''-mirror" ''yangsui'' with the sun (a.k.a. ''tàiyáng'' [[wikt:太陽|太陽]] "great ''yang''"), fire, dry, and round, and the "''yin''-mirror" ''fangshu'' with the moon (''tàiyīn'' [[wikt:太陰|太陰]] "great ''yin''"), water, wet, and square.

==Terminology==
There are numerous Chinese names for the fire-producing ''yángsuì'' 陽燧 "sun-mirror" and water-producing ''fāngzhū'' 方諸 "moon-mirror".

===''Yangsui''===
[[File:Huabiao denglong.jpg|thumb|right|''Hou'' 犼 dragon sitting on a ''chenglupan'' 承露盤 "dew collecting plate" capping a ''[[huabiao]]'' column]]
'''''Yángsuì''''' &lt; [[Old Chinese]] '''*''laŋsə-lu[t]-s''''' can be written 陽遂 or 陽燧, [[compound (linguistics)|compounding]]  ''yáng'' [[wikt:陽|陽]] (of ''yīnyáng'') "sunshine; shining; sunny side" with ''suì'' [[wikt:遂|遂]] "advance; accomplish; achieve" or ''suì'' [[wikt:燧|燧]] (clarified with the [[Radical 86|fire radical]] [[wikt:火|火]]) "light a fire". Compare the mirrorless ''sui'' terms [[Suiren]] 燧人 (with "person") "a mythical sage who invented [[Firelighting#Friction|friction firelighting]]", ''suìshí'' 燧石 (with "stone") "flint", ''mùsuì'' 木燧 (with "wood"), meaning either "hearth-board" or "fire-drill", and ''fēngsuì'' 烽燧 (with "beacon") "beacon-fire". ''Yángsuìzú'' 陽燧足 "sun-mirror feet" is an old Chinese name for "[[brittle star]]". ''Suì'' 燧 also had early graphic variants 鐆 and 䥙, written with the [[Radical 167|metal radical]] 金 specifying the bronze mirror.

The ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'' unabridged Chinese dictionary (1993, 11: 1974) gives three meanings for ''yángsuì'' 陽遂 (written without the "fire radical"): 亦作"阳燧" 古代利用日光取火的凹面铜镜 ["Also written 阳燧, a concave bronze mirror anciently used to start a fire from sunlight."]; 清畅通达貌 ["appearance of clear, unobstructed flowing"], which was first recorded in a poem (洞箫赋) by [[Wang Bao]] (c. 84 – c. 53 BCE); and 古代车上的一种采光装置 ["an ancient type of chariot window that admits light"], which was first recorded in the ''[[Book of Jin]]'' history covering 265 to 420 CE.

Three uncommon variant names for the concave fire-starting mirror are '''''fúsuì''''' &lt; '''*''[b]asә-lu[t]-s''''' 夫遂 (with [[wikt: 夫|夫]] "that") used in the ''Zhouli'' (below), '''''jīnsuì''''' &lt; '''*''k(r)[ә]msә-lu[t]-s''''' 金燧 (with [[wikt:金|金]] "metal") used in the ''Liji'' (below), and '''''yángfú''''' &lt; '''*''laŋ[b](r)o''''' 陽符 used in ''Taiping Yulan'' (below) (1993, 2: 1457).

English translations of the Chinese sun-mirror in classic texts (cited below) include:
*"metal speculum for getting fire from the sun" (Legge 1885)
*"burning-glass" (Forke 1907)
*"sun-mirror" (de Groot 1910)
*"burning mirror" (Needham and Wang 1962)
*"solar kindlers" or "igniters using ''yang''" (Schafer 1963)
*"burning-mirror" (Ware 1966)
*"burning mirror" (Major et al. 2010)

===''Fangzhu''===
The name '''''fāngzhū''''' &lt; '''*''C-paŋta''''' 方諸 combines ''fāng'' [[wikt:方|方]] "square; side; region" and ''zhū'' [[wikt:諸|諸]] "all; various". The ''Hanyu Da Cidian'' (1993, 6: 1570) gives two ''fāngzhū'' meanings: 古代在月下承露取水的器具 ["an ancient device used to collect dew in the moonlight in order to obtain water", with the oldest usage example from the ''Huainanzi'' (below); 传说中仙人住所 "a mythical place where ''[[xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' 'transcendents; immortals' reside"], which was first recorded in (c. 499) [[Shangqing School]] Daoist collection ''[[Zhen'gao]]'' 真誥 "Declarations of the Perfected", which says Fangzhu was named from being square, 1,300 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' on each side, and 9,000 ''[[Zhàng|zhang]]'' high. Gustave Schlegel (1875: 612) says the ''yangsui'' mirror is perfectly round and the ''fangzhu'' is ("le Carré total") "perfectly square", which is consistent with ''yanyang'' theory since roundness pertained to ''yang'' and heavenly fiery things, while squareness pertained to ''yin'' and earthly watery things. Umehara (1956: 142) described square mirrors believed to be from the [[Qin dynasty]]. ''Qīngtóng'' 青童 "Azure Lad", which is a [[homophone]] of ''qīngtóng'' 青銅 (lit. "azure copper") "bronze", is one of the main deities in [[Shangqing School|Shangqing Daoism]], and lord of the mythic paradise Fangzhu "Square Speculum Isle" in the eastern sea near [[Mount Penglai]] (Smith 2008: 803).

The (983) ''[[Taiping Yulan]]'' encyclopedia lists some ''yinyang'' synonyms of ''yangsui'' and ''fangzhu'', "The ''yangsui'' or '''''yángfú''''' &lt; '''*''laŋ[b](r)o''''' 陽符 (with ''fú'' [[wikt:符|符]] "tally; talisman; magic figure") obtains fire from the sun. The '''''yīnfú''''' &lt; '''*''q(r)um[b](r)o''''' 陰符 (cf. ''[[Huangdi Yinfujing|Yinfujing]]'' "Hidden Tally Scripture") or '''''yīnsuì''''' &lt; '''*''q(r)umsə-lu[t]-s''''' 陰燧 obtains water from the moon. They are copper amalgam mirrors, also named 'water and fire mirrors'."

''Chénglùpán'' 承露盤 "plate for receiving dew" is a near-synonym for ''fangzhu'' (Needham and Wang 1962: 89). The ''[[huabiao]]'', which is a type of [[Chinese architecture|Chinese architectural]] column traditionally erected in front of palaces and tombs, is topped by a mythical ''hou'' 犼 "a wolf-headed [[Chinese dragon]]" sitting on a round ''chenglupan'' "dew-collecting plate" cap.

There are comparatively fewer English translations of the Chinese moon-mirror, which lacks a direct translation equivalent and is more frequently  [[Romanization of Chinese|romanized]], include:
*"moon-mirror" (Forke 1907)
*"Yin mirror" (Needham and Wang 1962)
*"metal speculum for gathering water from the moon" (Ware 1966)
*"square speculum" (Smith 2008)
*"square receptacle" (Major et al. 2010)

==Mirror metaphors==
Metaphorically using ''fangzhu'' and ''yangsui'' mirrors to represent ''yin'' and ''yang'' reflects a more commonly used Chinese philosophical metaphor of a mirror to denote the ''[[Xin (concept)|xin]]'' 心 "heart-mind". For instance, the ''Zhuangzi'' famously says having a mirror-like ''xin'' represents the ideal state of unity with the Dao.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Do not be a corpse for fame, Do not be a storehouse of schemes; Do not be responsible for affairs, Do not be a proprietor of knowledge. Thoroughly embody unendingness and wander in nonbeginning. Thoroughly experience what you receive from heaven but do not reveal what you attain. Just be empty, that's all. The mind of the ultimate man functions like a mirror. It neither sends off nor welcomes; it responds but does not retain. Therefore, he can triumph over things without injury. (7, tr. Mair 1994: 70-71) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The stillness of the sage is not because stillness is said to be good and therefore he is still. It is because the myriad things are unable to disturb his mind that he is still. When water is still, it clearly reflects whiskers and brows. It is so accurate that the great craftsman takes his standard from it. If still water has such clarity, how much more so pure spirit! The stillness of the mind of the sage is the mirror of heaven and earth, the looking glass of the myriad things. (13, tr. Mair 1994: 119-120) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many scholars of Chinese philosophy have analyzed the mirror metaphor for the ''xin'' "heart-mind". Harold Oshima (1983: 75) explains that for a modern Westerner who regards a mirror as a commonplace looking-glass, this metaphor "appears quite pedestrian and unexciting" until one realizes that the ancient Chinese imagined mirrors "to possess broad and mysterious powers." For instance, a mirror can reveal and control demons. The ''Baopuzi'' (above) says a Daoist practitioner entering the mountains would suspend a mirror on his back, which was believed to prevent the approach of demons—compare the European belief that a mirror is [[Vampire#Apotropaics|apotropaic toward vampires]] who are supposedly unable to produce a reflection. Oshima says the ''yangsui'' burning-mirror that miraculously produces fire best illustrates the "great sense of mystery surrounding mirrors". "Certainly this mirror symbolized a powerful connection with the greater powers of the heavens and, as such, would have served admirably as a model for the [''xin'']."
&lt;blockquote&gt;For the early Chinese, mirrors were not simply passive "reflectors" of information, they offered accurate and appropriate ''responses'' to whatever came before them. When placed before the sun—the ultimate ''yang'' 陽 phenomenon in the world—they respond with fire: the pure essence of ''yang''. When placed before the moon—the ultimate ''yin'' 陰 phenomenon in the world—they respond with water: the pure essence of ''yin''. Thus mirrors offer the paradigm for ''proper responsiveness'': they reflect the true essence of the ultimate ''yin'' and ''yang''—the alpha and omega of phenomena in early Chinese cosmology." (Carr and Ivanhoe 2000: 56) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Erin Cline says the early Chinese attributed mirrors to have a mysterious power and great religious significance. The ceremonial bronze ''fusui'' 夫遂 and ''yangsui'' 陽燧 mirrors were seen as active, responsive objects because they could be used to produce fire and water (two of the Five Phases). 
&lt;blockquote&gt;When placed outside, concave mirrors focused sunlight to produce fire, while bronze mirrors gathered condensation in the light of the moon. But it was not simply the fact that mirrors had the power to ''gather'' or ''produce'' that made them objects of religious significance in ancient China; it was what they produced. Water and fire were thought to be the pure essences of ''yin'' and ''yang'', respectively, and the fact that mirrors appeared to ''draw'' these substances from the sun and moon reinforced the cosmological power that was already associated with them. (2008: 338)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Textual examples==
The [[Chinese classics]] contain early information about ''yangsui'' fire-mirrors and ''fangshu'' water-mirrors. The first two sources below are "ritual texts" of uncertain dates, and the others are presented chronologically.

===Zhouli===
The (c. 2nd century BCE) ''[[Zhouli]]'' "Zhou Rites" is a compilation of [[Zhou dynasty#Eastern Zhou|Eastern Zhou]] (771-256 BCE) texts about government bureaucracy and administration. It describes two kinds of ritual officials making the purifying "new fire". The ''Siguan'' 司爟 "Directors of Fire Ceremonies" used a ''zuānsuì'' 鑽燧 "[[Bow drill#Hand drill|fire-drill]]", for which a variety of different woods were chosen at five periods during the year (Biot 1881 2: 194). The ''Sixuanshi'' 司烜氏 "Directors of Sun Fire" ceremonially used a ''yangsui'' "burning-mirror" to start the "new fire".
&lt;blockquote&gt;They have the duty of receiving, with the [''fusui'' 夫遂] mirror, brilliant fire from the sun; and of receiving with the (ordinary) mirror [''jian'' 鑒] brilliant water from the moon. They carry out these operations in order to prepare brilliant rice, brilliant torches for sacrifices, and brilliant water. (tr. Needham and Wang 1962: 87, cf. Biot 1881 2: 381) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Zhouli'' commentary of [[Zheng Xuan]] (127–200) glosses  ''fusui'' as ''yangsui''. The sub-commentary of Jia Gongyan 賈公彦 says the ''fusui'' is called ''yangsui'' because it starts a fire by means of the ''jīng'' 精 "spirit; essence" of the ''taiyang'' "great ''yang''; sun".

===Liji===
Another ritual text similar to the ''Zhouli'', the (c. 2nd-1st century BCE) ''[[Liji]]'' "Record of Rites" is a compilation of Eastern Zhou textual materials. "The Pattern of the Family" section lists idealized duties of family members. Sons and daughters-in-law are supposed to wear a utility belt that includes metal and wood (two of the [[Wu Xing|Five Phases]]) ''suì'' fire-starters: ''jīnsuì'' 金燧 "burning-mirror" and a ''mùsuì'' 木燧 "fire-drill", which implies that fire-mirrors were quite commonly used among the ancient Chinese (Forke 1911: 497).
&lt;blockquote&gt;From the left and right of the girdle [a son] should hang their articles for use—on the left side, the duster and handkerchief, the knife and whetstone, the small spike, and the metal speculum for getting fire from the sun [金燧]; on the right, the archer's thimble for the thumb and the armlet, the tube for writing instruments, the knife-case [or "needle-case" for a daughter-in-law], the larger spike, and the borer for getting fire from wood [木燧]. (tr. Legge 1885 27: 449, 450) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Zheng Xuan's ''Liji'' commentary glosses ''musui'' as ''zuānhuǒ'' 鑽火 "produce fire by friction". [[Kong Yingda]] (574 – 648) quotes Huang Kan 皇侃, "When it is daylight, use the ''jinsui'' to start a fire from the sun, when it is dark, use the ''musui'' to start a fire with a drill". The commentary of Sun Xidan 孙希旦 (1736-1784) says ''jinsui'' or ''yangsui'' 陽遂 "''yang'' burning-mirrors" should ideally be cast on the Summer Solstice and ''yinjian'' 陰鑒 "''yin'' mirrors" on the Winter Solstice.

The ''[[Chunqiu Fanlu]]'' (14), attributed to [[Dong Zhongshu]] (179–104 BC), says ''císhí'' 磁石 "[[lodestone]]" attracts iron and ''jǐngjīn'' 頸金 "neck metal; burning-mirror" attracts fire; [[Joseph Needham]] and [[Wang Ling (historian)|Wang Ling]] (1962: 88) suggest the name "neck metal" derives from either the mirror being hung round the neck, or because necks are concave things.

===Huainanzi===
[[Liu An]]'s (c. 139 BCE) ''[[Huainanzi]]'' "Masters of Huainan", which is a compendium of writings from various schools of Chinese philosophy, was the first text to record ''fangzhu'' dew-collectors.

Two ''Huainanzi'' chapters metaphorically use "sun and moon mirrors" to exemplify ''yang'' and ''yin'' categories and elucidate the Chinese notion of ''[[ganying]]'' "cosmic resonance" through which categorically identical things mutually resonate and influence each other. The ''yángsuì'' 陽燧 "burning-mirror" is ''yang'', round, and sun-like; the ''fāngzhū'' 方諸 "square receptacle" is ''yin'', square, and moon-like. The first context describes ''yangsui'' and ''fangzhu'' mirrors ''jiàn'' 見 "seeing" the sun and moon. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Way of Heaven is called the Round; the Way of Earth is called the Square. The square governs the obscure; the circular governs the bright. The bright emits ''qi'', and for this reason fire is the external brilliance of the sun. The obscure sucks in ''qi'', and for this reason water is the internal luminosity of the moon. Emitted ''qi'' endows; retained ''qi'' transforms. Thus yang endows and yin transforms. The unbalanced ''qi'' of Heaven and Earth, becoming perturbed, causes wind; the harmonious ''qi'' of Heaven and Earth, becoming calm, causes rain. When yin and yang rub against each other, their interaction [感] produces thunder. Aroused, they produce thunderclaps; disordered they produce mist. When the yang ''qi'' prevails, it scatters to make rain and dew; when the yin ''qi'' prevails, it freezes to make frost and snow. Hairy and feather creatures make up the class of flying and walking things and are subject to yang. Creatures with scales and shells make up the class of creeping and hiding things and are subject to yin. The sun is the ruler of yang. Therefore, in spring and summer animals shed their fur; at the summer solstice, stags' antlers drop off. The moon is the fundament of yin. Therefore when the moon wanes, the brains of fish shrink; when the moon dies, wasps and crabs shrivel up. Fire flies upward; water flows downward. Thus, the flight of birds is aloft; the movement of fishes is downward. Things within the same class mutually move one another; root and twig mutually respond to each other [相應]. Therefore, when the burning mirror sees the sun, it ignites tinder and produces fire [故陽燧見日則燃而為火]. When the square receptacle sees the moon, it moistens and produces water [方諸見月則津而為水]. When the tiger roars, the valley winds rush; when the dragon arises, the bright clouds accumulate. When ''qilins'' wrangle, the sun or moon is eclipsed; when the leviathan dies, comets appear. When silkworms secrete fragmented silk, the ''shang'' string [of a stringed instrument] snaps. When meteors fall, the Bohai surges upward. (3.2, tr. Major et al. 2010: 115-116) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The second mentions some of the same ''yinyang'' and ''ganying'' folk-beliefs. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;That things in their [various] categories are mutually responsive [相應] is [something] dark, mysterious, deep, and subtle. Knowledge is not capable of assessing it; argument is not capable of explaining it. Thus, when the east wind arrives, wine turns clear and overflows [its vessels]; when silkworms secrete fragmented silk, the ''shang'' string [of a stringed instrument] snaps. Something has stimulated [感] them. When a picture is traced out with the ashes of reeds, the moon's halo has a [corresponding] gap. When the leviathan dies, comets appear. Something has moved them. Thus, when a sage occupies the throne, he embraces the Way and does not speak, and his nurturance reaches to the myriad people. But when ruler and ministers [harbor] distrust in their hearts, back-to-back arcs appear in the sky. The mutual responses [相應] of spirit ''qi'' are subtle indeed! Thus, mountain clouds are like grassy hummocks; river clouds are like fish scales; dryland clouds are like smoky fire; cataract clouds are like billowing water. All resemble their forms and evoke responses [感] according to their class. The burning mirror takes fire from the sun; the square receptacle takes dew from the moon [夫陽燧取火於日方諸取露於月]. Of [all the things] between Heaven and Earth, even a skilled astrologer cannot master all their techniques. [Even] a hand [that can hold] minutely tiny and indistinct things cannot grasp a beam of light. However, from what is within the palm of one's hand, one can trace [correlative] categories to beyond the extreme end point [of the cosmos]. [Thus] that one can set up [these implements] and produce water and fire is [a function of] the mutually [responsive] movement of yin and yang of the same ''qi''. (6.2, tr. Major et al. 2010:216-217) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Huainanzi'' commentary of [[Gao You]] (fl. 210 CE) says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The burning mirror is of metal. One takes a metal cup untarnished with verdigris and polishes it strongly, then it is heated by being made to face the sun at noon time; in this position cause it to play upon mugwort tinder and this will take fire. The [''fangzhu''] is the Yin mirror [''yinsui'' 陰燧]; it is like a large clam(-shell) [''dage'' 大蛤]. It is also polished and held under the moonlight at full moon; water collects upon it, which can be received in drops upon the bronze plate. So the statements of our ancient teacher are really true. (tr. Needham and Wang 1962: 88) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Needham and Wang (1962: 90), this comparison between a ''fangzhu'' mirror that drew water from the moon and a bivalve shell reflects an ancient Chinese confusion between beliefs about moon-mirrors and beliefs that certain marine animals waxed and waned in correspondence with the moon. For example, the (c. 3rd century BCE) ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The virtue of a ruler is what all the people obey, just as the moon is the root and fount of all Yin things. So at full moon, shellfish [''bangge'' 蚌蛤] are fleshy, and all that is Yin abounds. When the moon has waned, the shellfish are empty and Yin things weak. When the moon appears in the heavens all Yin things are influenced right down to the depths of the sea. So the sage lets virtue flow forth from himself, and the four outer wildernesses rejoice in his benevolent love. (tr. Needham and Wang 1962: 31) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The authors compare [[Aristotle]]'s (c. 350 BCE) ''[[Parts of Animals]]'' recording that some kinds of [[sea urchins]] were fat and good to eat at the full moon, which was one of the oldest biological observations about the lunar periodicity of the reproductive system of [[echinoderms]], especially sea urchins.

A third ''Huainanzi'' chapter accurately describes the importance of finding a ''sui'' burning-mirror's focal point. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Way of employing people is like drawing fire from a mirror [以燧取火]; if you're too far away [from the tinder], you won't get anything; if you're too close, it won't work. The right [distance] lies between far away and close. Observing the dawn, he [calculates] the shift [of the sun] at dusk; measuring the crooked, he tells [how far] something departs from the straight and level. When a sage matches things up, it is as if he holds up a mirror to their form; from the crooked [reflection], he can get to the nature [of things]. (17.227-228, tr. Major et al. 2010: 707-708) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Huainanzi'' frequently uses the term ''suìhuǒ'' 燧火 "kindle a fire", for instance, in the second month of summer, the Emperor "drinks water gathered from the eight winds and cooks with fire [kindled from] cudrania branches (5.5, tr. Major et al. 2010; 188).

===Lunheng===
[[File:Wu liang shrine relief depicting xihe, yi, and fusang tree.jpg|thumb|Houyi takes aim at the suns (right upper corner), rubbing from the Wu Liang shrines reliefs]]
[[Wang Chong]]'s (c. 80 CE) ''[[Lunheng]]'' mentions the ''fangzhu'' 方諸 in two chapters (46, 47), and the ''yangsui'' in five, written 陽遂 (8, 32) and 陽燧 (47, 74, 80).

The German sinologist Alfred Forke's (1907, 1911) English translation of the ''Lunheng'' consistently renders ''fangzhu'' as "moon-mirror" and ''yangsui'' as "[[burning-glass]]", because two chapters describe "liquefying five stones" (''wǔshí'' 五石) on a [[bingwu]] day (43rd in the 60-day [[sexagenary cycle]]) in the fifth [[Chinese calendar#Month|lunar month]]. Forke (1911: 496) circularly reasons that, "If this be true, the material must have been a sort of glass, for otherwise it could not possess the qualities of a burning glass. Just flint glass of which optical instruments are now made consists of five stony and earthy substances—silica, lead oxide, potash, lime, and clay. The Taoists in their alchemistical researches may have discovered such a mixture." The French sinologist [[Berthold Laufer]] (1915: 182-183, 187) refutes Forke's "downright literary concoction" of ''yangsui'' as "burning-glass" because Wang Chong's ''wushi'' 五石 "five stones" reference was a literary allusion to the [[Nüwa]] legend's ''wuseshi'' 五色石 "five-colored stone; multicolored stone", and because the Zhou Chinese did not have a word for "glass", which was unknown to them. Forke overlooked the (c. 320) Daoist text ''Baopuzi'' (below, Ware 1966: 294) that also describes smelting the "five minerals" (identified as realgar, cinnabar, orpiment, alum, and laminar malachite) on the ''bingwu'' day of a fifth month to make magic daggers that will protect travelers from water demons.

Both ''Lunheng'' contexts about casting a ''yangsui'' "burning-mirror" on a ''bingwu'' day use the phrase ''xiāoliàn wǔshí'' 消鍊五石 "smelting five minerals". The first contrasts burning-mirrors and crooked sword-blades.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The laws of Heaven can be applied in a right and in a wrong way. The right way is in harmony with Heaven, the wrong one owes its results to human astuteness, but cannot in its effects be distinguished from the right one. This will be shown by the following. Among the "Tribute of Yu" are mentioned jade and white corals. These were the produce of earth and genuine precious stones and pearls. But the Taoists melt five kinds of stones, and make five-coloured gems out of them. Their lustre, if compared with real gems, does not differ. Pearls in fishes and shells are as genuine as the jade-stones in the Tribute of Yu. Yet the Marquis of Sui made pearls from chemicals, which were as brilliant as genuine ones. This is the climax of Taoist learning and a triumph of their skill. By means of a burning-glass [陽燧] one catches fire from heaven. Of five stones liquefied on the [Bingwu] day of the 5th moon an instrument is cast, which, when polished bright, held up against the sun, brings down fire too, in precisely the same manner as, when fire is caught in the proper way. Now, one goes even so far as to furbish the crooked blades of swords, till they shine, when, held up against the sun, they attract fire also. Crooked blades are not burning-glasses; that they can catch fire is the effect of rubbing. Now, provided the bad-natured men are of the same kind as good-natured ones, then they can be influenced, and induced to do good. Should they be of a different kind, they can also be coerced in the same manner as the Taoists cast gems, Sui Hou made pearls, and people furbish the crooked blades of swords. Enlightened with learning and familiarized with virtue, they too begin by and by to practise benevolence and equity. (8, tr. Forke 1907: 377-378) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Needham and Wang interpret this ''Lunheng'' passage as an account of making glass burning-lenses. Despite Forke's translation of ''suíhòu'' 隨侯, with ''suí'' 隨 "follow; comply with; the ancient state [[Sui (state)|Sui]]" and [[Chinese nobility#Princehood and peerage|''hóu'']] 侯 "marquis", as the legendary "Sui Hou; Marquis of Sui" who received a fabulous pearl from a snake; they translate "following proper timing", citing the [[Chinese alchemy|Chinese alchemical]] term ''huǒhòu'' 火候 "fire-times; times when heating should begin and end", and reading ''hóu'' 侯 "marquis" as a miscopy of ''hòu'' 候 "time; wait; situation".
&lt;blockquote&gt;But by following proper timing (i.e. when to begin heating and how long to go on) pearls can be made from chemicals [''yao'' 藥], just as brilliant as genuine ones. This is the climax of Taoist learning and a triumph of their skill. Now by means of the burning-mirror [''yangsui''] one catches fire from heaven. Yet of five mineral substances liquefied and transmuted on a [''bingwu''] day in the fifth month, an instrument [''qi'' 器] is cast, which, when brightly polished and held up against the sun, brings down fire too, in precisely the same manner as when fire is caught in the proper way. (tr. Needham and Wang 1962: 112) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Wang Chong gives three contrasts between "genuine" and "imitation" things: the opaque glass "jade" made by Daoist alchemists with the real thing; the artificially made "pearls" with true pearls; and the "instrument" made by liquefying five different minerals, which can concentrate the sun's rays like the traditional bronze burning-mirror. Furthermore, Needham and Wang question why the ''Lunheng'' specifies five different minerals, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Bronze would require only two ores, perhaps even only one, with possible addition of a flux. Glass needs silica, limestone, an alkaline carbonate, and perhaps litharge or the barium mineral, together with colouring matter. Of course, the text does not clearly tell us that lenses were being made; the instruments might have been simply glass mirrors imitating the bronze ones. (1962: 113) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Based on archeological finds of glass objects substituting for jade and bronze ones in tombs dating back to the Warring States period, Needham and Wang (1962: 113) conclude that the Chinese were making glass [[lens (optics)|lenses]] in the 1st century CE, and probably as far back as the 3rd century BCE.

The second context explains ''[[ganying]]'' "cosmic resonance" with examples of ''bingwu'' burning-mirrors, moon-mirrors, and ''tulong'' 土龍 "[[Yinglong#Shanhaijing|clay dragons]]" believed analogously to cause rainfall like Chinese [[Chinese dragon|''long'' dragons]]. It describes a dispute between Han astronomer [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]], who used a clay dragon in a rain sacrifice, but could not explain the reason why it worked, when the scholar [[Huan Tan]] argued that only a genuine lodestone can attract needles.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The objection that the dragon was not genuine, is all right, but it is wrong not to insist on relationship. When an east wind blows, wine flows over, and [when a whale dies, a comet appears.] The principle of Heaven is spontaneity, and does not resemble human activity, being essentially like that affinity between clouds and dragons. The sun is fire, and the moon is water. Fire and water are always affected by genuine fluids. Now, physicists cast burning-glasses [陽燧] wherewith to catch the flying fire from the sun, and they produce moon-mirrors [方諸] to draw the water from the moon. That is not spontaneity, yet Heaven agrees to it. A clay dragon is not genuine either, but why should it not be apt to affect Heaven? With a burning-glass one draws fire from Heaven. In the fifth month, on a [bingwu] day at noon, they melt five stones, and cast an instrument with which they obtain fire. Now, without further ceremony, they also take the crooked hooks on swords and blades, rub them, hold them up towards the sun, and likewise affect Heaven. If a clay dragon cannot be compared with a burning-glass, it can at least be placed on a level with those crooked hooks on swords and blades. (47, tr. Forke 1911: 350-351) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
A third ''Lunheng'' chapter, which mentions casting burning-mirrors on the fifth month but not the ''bingwu'' day, criticizes the Han philosopher [[Dong Zhongshu]]'s belief that clay dragons could cause rain.
&lt;blockquote&gt;[E]ven Heaven may be induced to respond, by tricks. In order to stir up the heavenly fluid, the spirit should be used, but people will employ burning glasses [陽燧], to attract the fire from the sky. By melting five stones and moulding an instrument in the fifth month, in the height of summer, one may obtain fire. But now people merely take knives and swords or crooked blades of common copper, and, by rubbing them and holding them up against the sun, they likewise get fire. As by burning glasses, knives, swords, and blades one may obtain fire from the sun, so even ordinary men, being neither Worthies nor Sages, can influence the fluid of Heaven, as Tung Chung Shu was convinced that by a clay dragon he could attract the clouds and rain, and he had still some reason for this belief. If even those who in this manner conform to the working of Heaven, cannot be termed Worthies, how much less have those a claim to this name who barely win people’s hearts? (80, tr. Forke 1911: 132) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The other ''Lunheng'' reference to moon-mirrors mentions moon mythology about the [[moon rabbit]] and [[Jin Chan|three-legged toad]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;When we hold up a moon-mirror [方諸] towards the moon, water comes down. The moon approaching the Hyades or leaving the constellation of the ‘House’ from the north, it nearly always inevitably rains. The animals in the moon are the hare and the toad. Their counterparts on earth are snails and corn-weevils. When the moon is eclipsed in the sky, snails and corn-weevils decrease on earth, which proves that they are of the same kind. When it rains without ceasing, one attacks all that belongs to the Yin. To obtain a result one ought to hunt and kill hares and toads, and smash snails and corn-weevils. (46, tr. Forke 1911: 341) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two chapters mention ''yangsui'' mirrors to express skepticism about the [[Chinese mythology|Chinese myth]] that the archer [[Houyi]] shot down nine of the [[Houyi#The Time of the Ten Suns|Ten Suns]] (children of [[Di Jun]] and [[Xihe (deity)|Xihe]]) that were burning up earth.
&lt;blockquote&gt;We see that with a sun-glass fire [陽遂] is drawn from heaven, the sun being a big fire. Since on earth fire is one fluid, and the earth has not ten fires, how can heaven possess ten suns? Perhaps the so called ten suns are some other things, whose light and shape resembles that of the sun. They are staying in the ‘Hot Water Abyss’, and always climb up Fu-sang. Yü and Yi saw them, and described them as ten suns. (32, tr. Forke 1911: 272-273) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
These legendary references are to [[Fusang]], [[Yu the Great|Yu]], and [[Yi (husbandman)|Yi]]. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The sun is fire: in the sky it is the sun, and on earth it is fire. How shall we prove it? A burning glass [陽遂] being held up towards the sun, fire comes down from heaven. Consequently fire is the solar fluid. The sun is connected with the cycle of ten, but fire is not. How is it that there are ten suns and twelve constellations? The suns are combined with these constellations, therefore [''jia''] is joined to [''zi'']. But what are the so called ten suns? Are there ten real suns, or is there only one with ten different names? (74, tr. Forke 1911: 412) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Jia'' 甲 and ''zi'' 子 are the first signs of the [[heavenly stems]] and [[earthly branches]] in the [[Chinese calendar]].

===Baopuzi===
Three "Inner Chapters" of the (c. 320 CE) ''[[Baopuzi]]'', written by the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] scholar [[Ge Hong]], provide information about ''yangsui'' 陽燧 "burning-mirrors" and ''fangzhu'' 方諸 "dew-mirrors".

In Chapter 3 "Rejoinder to Popular Conceptions", Ge Hong mentions the commonly used sun and moon mirrors to answer an interlocutor who criticizes Daoist alchemical recipes for immortality as "specious … unreliable fabrications of wondermongers".
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to your argument, they would appear inefficacious, but even the most minor of them is not without effect. I have frequently seen people obtain water from the moon at night by means of a speculum, and fire from the sun in the morning by used of a burning-mirror [餘數見人以方諸求水於夕月陽燧引火於朝日]. I have seen people conceal themselves to the point of complete disappearance, or change their appearance so that they no longer seem human. I have seen them knot a kerchief, throw it to the ground, and produce a hopping hare. I have seen them sew together a red belt and thereby produce a wriggling snake. I have seen people make melons and fruit ripen in an instant, or dragons and fish come and go in a basin. All of these things occurred just as it was said they would. (tr. Ware 1966: 62-3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chapter 4 "Gold and Cinnabar" refers to the ''yinyang'' mirrors in two contexts. The first describes an alchemical elixir method that uses a burning-mirror to create a mercury alloy dew-mirror.
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is also a [''Minshan danfa'' 岷山丹法], found in a cave by [Zhang Kaita 張蓋蹋] as he was giving careful thought to such matters on Mount Min. This method forges yellow copper alloy to make a speculum for gathering water from the moon [其法鼓冶黃銅以作方諸]. It is then covered with mercury and its interior heated with solar essence (gathered by a burning-mirror) [以承取月中水以水銀覆之]. The taking of this substance over a long period will produce immortality. This same text also teaches us to place this elixir in a copper mirror coated with realgar, cover it with mercury, and expose it to the sun for twenty days, after which it is uncovered and treated. When taken in the form of pills the size of grams, washed down with the first water drawn from the well at dawn, for a hundred days, it makes the blind see, and by itself cures those who are ill. It will also turn white hair black and regrow teeth. (tr. Ware 1966: 83-84) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The second ''fangzhu'' context describes using plates and bowls made from an elixir of immortality in order to collect the ''yè'' 液 "liquid; fluid; juice" (tr. "exudate") of the sun and moon, which also provides immortality.
&lt;blockquote&gt; A recipe for making "black amber sesame" [威喜巨勝] from Potable Gold is to combine Potable Gold with mercury and cook for thirty days. Remove, and fill a clay bowl with it. Seal with Six-One lute [a mixture of alum, arsenolite, salts, limestone, etc.], place in a raging fire, and cook for sixty double-hours, by which time it all turns to elixir. Take a quantity of this the size of a gram and you will immediately become a genie. A spatula of this elixir mixed with one pound of mercury will immediately turn it to silver; a pound placed over a fire, which is then fanned, will turn into a reddish gold termed "vermillion gold" [丹金]. If daggers and sword are smeared with it, they will ward off all other weapons within ten thousand miles. If plates and bowls are made of vermillion gold and used for drinking and eating, they will produce Fullness of Life. If these dishes are used to gather exudate of the sun and moon, as specula are used to gather lunar water [以承日月得液如方諸之得水也], the exudate will produce immortality when drunk. (tr. Ware 1966: 90) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chapter 16 "The Yellow and the White" uses the abbreviations ''zhu'' 諸 and ''sui'' 燧 along with ''fangzhu'' and ''yangsui'' to compare natural and artificial transformations. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;What is it that the arts of transformation cannot do? May I remind my readers that the human body, which is normally visible, can be made to disappear? Ghosts and gods are normally invisible, but there are ways and means to make them visible. Those capable of operating these methods and prescriptions will be found to abound wherever you go. Water and fire are present in the sky, but they may be brought down with specula and burning-mirrors [水火在天而取之以諸燧]; lead is naturally white, but it can be reddened and mistaken for cinnabar. Cinnabar is naturally red, but it can be whitened to look like lead. Clouds, rain, frost, and snow are all breaths belonging to heaven and earth, but those produced by art differ in no way from the natural phenomena. Flying things and those that creep and crawl have been created in specific shapes, but it would be impossible ever to finish listing the thousands upon thousands of sudden metamorphoses which they can undergo. Man himself is the most highly honored member of creation and the most highly endowed, yet there are just as many instances of men and women changing into cranes, stones, tigers, monkeys, sand, or lizards. The cases of high mountains becoming deep abysses and of profound valleys changing into peaks are metamorphoses on an immense scale. It is clear, therefore, that transformation is something spontaneous in nature. Why should we doubt the possibility of making gold and silver from something different? Compare, if you will, the fire obtained with a burning-mirror and the water which condenses at night on the surface of a metal speculum [譬諸陽燧所得之火方諸所得之水]. Do they differ from ordinary water and fire? (tr. Ware 1966: 262-263) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Baopuzi'' also mentions ''míngjìng'' 明鏡 "bright mirror" magic, such as meditating on paired "sun" and "moon" mirrors to see spiritual beings, using mirror reflections to protect against shapeshifting demons (de Groot 1910: 1000-1005 discusses Chinese demon-conquering mirrors), and practicing Daoist [[multilocation]]. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;At other times a bright mirror nine inches or more in diameter [明鏡徑九寸已上] is used for looking at oneself with something on the mind. After seven days and nights a god or genie will appear, either male, female, old, or young, and a single declaration on its part discloses automatically what is occurring at that moment a thousand miles away. Sometimes two mirrors are used and designated sun and moon respectively. Or four are used and designated as the four circumferences, by which is meant the front, rear, left, and right, to which each points when one looks into them. When four mirrors are used, a large number of gods are seen to appear; sometimes pell-mell, other times riding dragons or tigers and wearing hats and clothes of many colors, different from those seen in ordinary life. There are books and illustrations to document all this. (15, tr. Ware 1966: 255-256) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The spirits in old objects are capable of assuming human shape for the purpose of confusing human vision and constantly putting human beings to a test. It is only when reflected in a mirror that they are unable to alter their true forms. Therefore, in the old days, all processors entering the mountains suspended on their backs a mirror measuring nine inches or more in diameter [明鏡徑九寸已上], so that aged demons would not dare approach them. If any did come to test them, they were to turn and look at them in the mirror. If they were genii or good mountain gods, they would look like human beings when viewed in the mirror. If they were birds, animals, or evil demons, their true forms would appear in the mirror. If such a demon comes toward you, you must walk backward, turning your mirror toward it, in order to drive it away. Then observe it. If it is an aged demon it is sure to have no heels. If it has heels, it is a mountain god. (17, tr. Ware 1966: 281) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The preservation of Mystery-Unity [玄一] consists in imagining yourself as being divided into three persons. Once these three have become visible, you can continue to increase the number to several dozen, all like yourself, who may be concealed or revealed, and all of whom are automatically in possession of secret oral directions. This may be termed a process for multiplying the body. Through this method [Zuo Cu], [Ji Liao], and my uncle [Ge Xuan] could be in several dozen places at one time. When guests were present they could be one host speaking the guests in the house, another host greeting guests beside the stream, and still another host making cases with his fishing line, but the guests were unable to distinguish which was he true one. My teacher used to say that to preserve Unity was to practice jointly Bright Mirror [守一兼修明鏡], and that on becoming successful in the mirror procedure a man would be able to multiply his body to several dozen all with the same dress and facial expression. (18, tr. Ware 1966: 306) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bencao gangmu===
[[Li Shizhen]]'s (1578) ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'' classic pharmacopeia mentions both burning-mirrors and dew-mirrors.

''Yangsui'' "burning-mirror" occurs with ''huǒzhū'' 火珠 (lit. "fire pearl/bead") "burning-lens" in the entry for ''àihuǒ'' 艾火 "igniting [[mugwort]] for [[moxibustion]]".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fire used in cauterizing with mugwort ought to be fire really obtained from the sun by means of a sun-mirror [艾火] or fire-pearl (lens?) [火珠] exposed to the sun. Next in efficacy is fire obtained by boring into [''huái'' 槐 "locust tree"] wood, and only in cases of emergency, or when it is difficult to procure such fire, it may be taken from a lamp of pure hempseed oil, or from a wax taper. (火1, tr. Groot 1910 6:947) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Li Shizhen explains (tr. Forke 1911: 497), "[The ''yangsui''] is a fire mirror made of cast copper. Its face is concave. Rubbing it warm and holding it towards the sun, one obtains fire by bringing some artemisia near it. This is what the [''ZhouIi''] says about the comptroller of light receiving the brilliant light from the sun by his fire speculum."

The ''huozhu'' "fire pearl" burning-lens was introduced into China during the [[Tang dynasty]] (Schafer 1963: 237). The (945) ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' records that in 630, envoys from [[Chams]] presented [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] (r. 626-649) with a crystalline ''huǒzhū'' 火珠 (lit. "fire pearl/bead") "fire orb; [[burning glass]]", the size of a hen's egg, that would concentrate the sun's rays and ignite a piece of punk. The envoys said they obtained this [[Imperial Chinese tributary system|tribute gift]] in the country of the ''Luóchà'' 羅剎 "[[rakshasa]] creatures in [[Hindu mythology]]", probably imported into [[India]] from the [[Hellenistic]] Near East (Schafer 1963: 237). Needham and Wang (1962: 115) say ''Luocha'' "the country of the Rakshas", is not [[Sri Lanka]], but rather [[Pahang]], [[Malaysia]]. The (1060) ''[[New Book of Tang]]'' account says the year was 631 and the fire-orb came from [[Bali]]. The American sinologist [[Edward H. Schafer]] (1963: 237, 239) notes that the Chinese ''huozhu'' name reflects the [[Sanskrit]] ''agnimaṇi'' "fire jewel" name for burning-glasses, and later Tang dynasty sources use hybrid names like ''yangsuizhu'' "Solar-Kindling Pearl", showing that the crystal fire-orb was regarded as the legitimate successor of the ancient bronze burning-bowl.

''Fangzhu'' occurs in the ''Bencao Gangmu'' entry  for ''míngshuǐ'' 明水 "bright water" used in rituals (水1 天水類, tr. Forke 1911: 497-498), which is explained as ''fangzhu shui'' 方諸水 "dew-mirror water". [Chen Cangqi 陳藏器] says that it is a ''dabang'' 大蚌 "big oyster[-shell]" that, "when rubbed and held up towards the moon, draws some drops of water from it, resembling dew in the morning". [Other authors say] ''fang'' 方 means ''shi'' 石 "stone", or "a mixture of five stones", and ''zhu'' 諸 means ''zhū'' 珠 "pearl; bead". [Li Shizhen] "rejects all these explanations contending that the [''fangzhu''] was a mirror like the burning speculum, and similarly manufactured. This view is supported by the above quoted passage of the [''Zhouli''], which expressly speaks of a mirror employed to obtain water from the moon. This very pure water was perhaps used at sacrifices."

==Speculum metallurgy==
[[File:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - bronze mirror.jpg|thumb|A ''Jiàn'' 鑒 bronze mirror from the [[Warring States period]] (475 - 221 BCE)]]
[[Bronze mirrors]] have special significance within the [[history of metallurgy in China]]. In the [[archaeology of China]], copper and bronze mirrors first appeared in the (pre-16th century BCE) "early metalwork" period before the [[Shang dynasty]]. Developments of metal plaques and mirrors appear to have been faster in the Northwestern Region where there was more frequent use of metals in the social life. In particular, the (c. 2050-1915 BCE) [[Qijia culture]], mainly in [[Gansu]] and eastern [[Qinghai]], has provided rich finds of copper mirrors (Bai 2013: 157, 164). Archeological evidence shows that ''yangsui'' burning-mirrors were "clearly one of the earliest uses to which mirrors were put, and the art of producing them was doubtless well known in the [Zhou dynasty]" (Todd and Rupert 1935: 14). Chemical analyses of [[Bronze Age#China|Chinese Bronze Age]] mirrors reveal that early technicians produced sophisticated [[speculum metal]], a white, silvery smooth, high-tin bronze alloy that provides extremely reflective surfaces, used for mirrors and reflecting telescopes (Needham and Lu 1974: 198). Among [[Chinese ritual bronzes]], the most common mirror was ''jiàn'' [[wikt:鑒|鑒]] "mirror", which anciently referred to either a circular mirror, often with intricate ornamentation on the back, or a tall, broad dish for water.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The ''[[Kaogongji]]'' "Record Examining Crafts" section of the ''Zhouli'' (above) lists six official standards for ''tóngxī'' 銅錫 copper-tin (Cu-Sn) bronze alloys to produce different implements; from the least tin (1 part per 5 parts copper) for "bells and sacrificial urns" to the most (1 part tin per 1 part copper) for "metallic mirrors", namely, the ''jiànsuì'' 鑒燧 "mirror-igniter" alloy (Hirth 1907: 217-218). However, these ratios are based on [[Numerology#Chinese numerology|Chinese numerology]] instead of practical metallurgy. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Beyond about 32% the alloy becomes excessively brittle, and increasing tin content brings no further advantages of any kind; this the Han metallurgists evidently knew. Indeed they knew much more, for they almost always added up to 9% of lead, a constituent which greatly improved the casting properties. Han specular metal is truly white, reflects without tinning or silvering, resists scratching and corrosion well, and was admirably adapted for the purposes of its makers. (Needham and Wang 1962: 89) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Besides the ''Kaogongji'' half-copper and half-tin formula, other Chinese texts describe the ''yangsui'' and ''fangzhu'' speculum alloy as ''jīnxī'' 金錫 "gold and tin" or  ''qīngtóngxī'' 青銅錫 "bronze and tin" (Forke 1911: 497).

Unless a mirror surface is truly smooth, image quality falls off rapidly with distance. Chinese bronze mirrors included both smooth [[plane mirror]]s and precisely [[curved mirrors]] of bright finish and high reflectivity. Needham and Wang (1962: 91) say, "That high-tin bronze (specular metal) was used from [Zhou] times onward is certain, and that it was sometimes coated with a layer of tin by heating above 2300°C. is highly probable; this would give at least 80% reflectivity." Later the tin was deposited by means of a mercury [[Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]], as recorded in the ''Baopuzi'' (4,  above).

Fu Ju Xiansheng 負局先生 "Master Box-on-his-Back" was the Daoist patron saint of mirror-polishers. The (c. 4th century CE) ''[[Liexian Zhuan]]'' (tr. Giles 1948: 50-51) says Fu Chu "always carried on his back a box of implements for polishing mirrors, and used to frequent the market-towns of Wu in order to exhibit his skill in this work. He charged one cash for polishing a mirror. Having inquired of his host if there were any sick persons in the place, he would produce a drug made up into purple pills and administer these. Those who took them invariably recovered."

The casting of Chinese sun-mirrors and moon-mirrors ideally followed the principles of [[Chinese astrology]], ''yinyang'', and ''[[Wu xing|wuxing]]''. The ''Lunheng'' (above) says ''yangsui'' and ''fangzhu'' mirrors should be smelted from five minerals when a ''bingwu'' (43rd of 60-day cycle) day occurs in the 5th lunar month. The (4th century) ''[[Soushenji]]'' explains, "The fire mirror must be cast in the 5th month on a [''bingwu''] day at noon, the moon mirror in the eleventh month on a [''renzi''] day at midnight." These times, the middle of summer and of winter are in harmony with the theory of the Five Elements (Forke 1911: 497). Many early bronze mirrors have inscriptions mentioning the ''bingwu'' day, which was considered auspicious for casting operations since the cyclical ''bing'' was associated with the west and metal, while ''wu'' was associated with the south and fire; correspondingly, the moon-mirrors were cast on ''renzi'' days in the twelfth month, and these cyclical signs are associated with the complementary elements of water and wood (Needham and Wang 1962: 113).

==Cross-cultural parallels==
[[File:Burning mirrors, from Kircher. Wellcome L0016024.jpg|thumb|Burning mirrors, [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s (1646) ''Ars magna lucis et umbrae'']]
The Chinese use of burning-mirrors has parallels in other civilizations, especially to produce ritual "pure fire", used as the source for lighting other fires.

Burning-mirrors were known to the Greeks and Romans. [[Archimedes]] supposedly set fire to the [[Roman Navy|Roman fleet]] with burning-mirrors in 212 BCE, when [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] was besieged by [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] (Simms 1977). [[Plutarch]]'s (c. 1st century CE) ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' account of [[Numa Pompilius]] (r. 715-673 BCE) records the [[Vestal Virgins]] using burning-mirrors to light the [[sacred fire of Vesta]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;If it (the fire) happens by any accident to be put out, … it is not to be lighted again from another fire, but new fire is to be gained by drawing a pure and unpolluted flame from the sunbeams. They kindle it generally with concave vessels of brass, formed by hollowing out an isosceles rectangular triangle, whose lines from the circumference meet in one single point. This being placed against the sun, causes its rays to converge in the centre, which, by reflection, acquiring the force and activity of fire, rarefy the air, and immediately kindle such light and dry matter as they think fit to apply. (tr. Langhorne 1821 1: 195) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The striking contemporaneity of the first burning-mirror references in Chinese and European literature, probably indicates the spread in both directions of a technique originally Mesopotamian or Egyptian (Needham and Wang 1962: 88).

In ancient India, the physician [[Vagbhata]]'s ''Ashtānga hridayasamhitā'' mentions using burning-mirrors twice, to grind certain drugs on it, and to cauterize a rat bite wound (Laufer 1915: 220).

[[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]]'s history of the Mughal emperor [[Akbar]] (r. 1556-1605) records a pair of sacred sun and moon stones: Hindi ''sūryakānta'' "a crystal [[burning lens]] used to light the sacred fire" and ''chandrakānta'' (Sanskrit ''candrakānta'' "beloved by the moon") "a [[Moonstone (gemstone)|moonstone]] that drips water when exposed to moonlight".
&lt;blockquote&gt;At noon of the day, when the sun enters the nineteenth degree of Aries, the whole world being then surrounded by its light, they expose to the rays of the sun a round piece of a white and shining stone, called in Hindi ''sūryakānta''. A piece of cotton is then held near it, which catches fire from the heat of the stone. This celestial fire is committed to the care of proper persons. …There is also a shining white stone, called ''chandrakānt'', which, upon being exposed to the beams of the moon, drips water. (Laufer 1915: 221-222). &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Owing to the similarities of Chinese ''yangsui'' and ''fangzhu'' mirrors with Indian ''sūryakānta'' and ''candrakānta'' stones, Tang (1935) proposes a [[trans-cultural diffusion]] from China to the [[Mughal Empire]].

'''Dato Barbakadze''' ({{lang-ka|დათო ბარბაქაძე}}); born 7 February 1966) is a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] writer, essayist and translator.

== Biography ==
Dato Barbakadze was born in [[Tbilisi]]. He studied [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] in ''[[Tbilisi State University]]'' between 1984 and 1992 and holds a [[Master's degree|Masters]] degree in Philosophy. In 1992-1994 he pursued his post-graduate studies in the Department of Sociology at Tbilisi State University, but left a standard academic career to pursue independent projects in Georgian and German literature: he has followed a non-traditional academic path for the past twenty years (2010). In 1991 Dato Barbakadze founded a literary video-magazine ''Dato Barbakadze’s Magazine'', which for two years was regularly performed at Tbilisi State University. He also founded the literary magazines ''Polilogue'' (1994, four issues) and ''± Literature'' (1996, four issues). These publications featured many of the innovations of Georgian literature in the 1990s. From 1991 to 2001 Dato Barbakadze taught courses in [[logic]], the history of philosophy, [[esthetics]] and introductory philosophy courses in several universities in Tbilisi. In 2002-2005 he lived in [[Germany]] where he pursued his literary interests and studied philosophy, ancient history and [[sociology]] at [[Westphalian Wilhelms-University of Münster]]. After returning to Tbilisi in 2005 Dato Barbakadze started the project ''XXth century Austrian Poetry'', serving both as an editor and contributor. Dato Barbakadze has been a member of [[Die Kogge]], an association of European writers, since 2007. His works have been translated into English, German, French and Russian. He lives in Tbilisi, Georgia.

'''David W. Miller''' (born 19 August 1942, [[Watford]]) is an English [[philosopher]] and prominent exponent of [[critical rationalism]].&lt;ref name="critical"&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, David W. |title=Critical rationalism: a restatement and defence |publisher=Open Court |location=La Salle, Ill |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-8126-9198-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught in the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Warwick]] in [[Coventry]], [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/philosophy/people/miller |title=University of Warwick &amp;#124; Philosophy &amp;#124; Associates &amp;#124; David Miller |format= |work= |accessdate=2017-11-06 |deadurl=yes |df= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107013511/https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/philosophy/people/miller |archivedate=2017-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he is Reader in Philosophy. He has been Honorary Treasurer of the [[British Society for the Philosophy of Science]]

He was educated at [[Woodbridge School]] and [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]]. In 1964 he began to study Logic and Scientific Method at the [[London School of Economics]]. Soon afterwards he became one of [[Karl Popper]]'s research assistants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = D. | authorlink = David Miller (philosopher)| doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1997.0021 | title = Sir [[Karl Popper|Karl Raimund Popper]], C.

A substantial literature developed in the two decades following, including papers by Miller, to assess the remediability of Popper's approach.

Miller's ''[[Critical Rationalism: A Restatement and Defence]]'' &lt;ref name="critical"/&gt; is an attempt to expound, defend, and extend an approach to scientific knowledge identified with Popper.  A central, "not quite original", thesis is that rationality does not depend on good reasons.  Rather, it is better off without them, especially as they are unobtainable and unusable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = D. | title = Being an Absolute Skeptic | doi = 10.1126/science.284.5420.1625 | journal = Science | volume = 284 | issue = 5420 | pages = 1625 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1907">'''Ekpyrosis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|k|p|ɪ|ˈ|r|oʊ|s|ɪ|s}}; {{lang-grc|ἐκπύρωσις}} ''ekpyrōsis'', "conflagration") is a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] belief in the periodic destruction of the cosmos by a great conflagration every [[Great Year]]. The cosmos is then recreated ([[palingenesis]]) only to be destroyed again at the end of the new cycle. This form of catastrophe is the opposite of kataklysmos (κατακλυσμός, "inundation"), the destruction of the earth by water.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas G. Rosenmeyer]], [http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft7489p15r&amp;chunk.id=d0e7855&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress ''Senecan Drama and Stoic Cosmology''], University of California Press, 1989, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ekpyrosis is attributed to [[Chrysippus]] by [[Plutarch]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''De Stoicorum repugnantiis'' [http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/historiens/Plutarque/stoiciensgr.htm 1053b]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rist (1978), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Certainty}}
{{C. S. Peirce articles}}
Broadly speaking, '''fallibilism''' (from [[Medieval Latin]]: ''fallibilis'', "liable to err") is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] claim that no belief can have justification which guarantees the [[truth]] of the belief.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hetherington, "Fallibilism," ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallibil/&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all fallibilists believe that fallibilism extends to all domains of [[knowledge]].

==Usage==
The term "fallibilism" is used in a variety of senses in contemporary [[epistemology]]. The term was coined in the late nineteenth century by the American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. By "fallibilism", Peirce meant the view that "people cannot attain absolute certainty concerning questions of fact."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Sanders Peirce, "The Scientific Attitude and Fallibilism," in Justus Buchler, ed., ''Philosophical Writings of Peirce''. New York: Dover, 1955, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Other theorists of knowledge have used the term differently. Thus, "fallibilism" has been used to describe the claim that:

# No beliefs can be conclusively justified.&lt;ref&gt;Hetherington, "Fallibilism"; Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosure''. Cambridge: MIT Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Knowledge does not require certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Feldman. ''Epistemology''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 2003, p. 122; Alvin I. Goldman and Matthew McGrath, ''Epistemology: A Contemporary Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Almost no basic (that is, non-inferred) beliefs are certain or conclusively justified.&lt;ref&gt;Louis P. Pojman, ''What Can We Know? An Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge'', 2nd ed. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 2001, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, some theorists embrace global versions of fallibilism (claiming that no human beliefs have truth-guaranteeing justification), while others restrict fallibilism to particular areas of human inquiry, such as [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] [[science]] or [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;Hetherington, "Fallibilism", Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The claim that all scientific claims are provisional and open to revision in the light of new evidence is widely taken for granted in the [[natural science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn, Thomas S.]] ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''. 3rd ed. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many forms of [[skepticism]], fallibilism does not imply that we have no knowledge; fallibilists typically deny that knowledge requires absolute certainty. Rather, fallibilism is an admission that, because empirical knowledge can be revised by further observation, any of the things we take as empirical knowledge [[falsifiability|might turn out to be false]].

Some fallibilists make an exception for things that are necessarily true (such as [[mathematics|mathematical]] and [[logic]]al truths). Others remain fallibilists about these types of truths as well. [[Susan Haack]], following [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], has argued that to refrain from extending fallibilism to logical truths—due to the necessity or [[A priori and a posteriori|a prioricity]] of such truths—mistakes "fallibilism" as a predicate on propositions, when it is a predicate on people or agents:&lt;ref&gt;Haack, ''Philosophy of Logics'', pp. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|One needs, first, to get clear just what is meant by the claim that logic is revisable - and, equally importantly, what is not meant by it. What I mean, at any rate, is not that the truths of logic might have been otherwise than they are, but that the truths of logic might be other than we take them to be, i.e. we could be mistaken about what the truths of logic are, e.g. in supposing that the law of excluded middle is one such.

So a better way to put the question, because it makes its epistemological character clearer, is this: does fallibilism extend to logic? Even this formulation, however, needs further refinement, for the nature of fallibilism is often misunderstood.||}}

The [[critical rationalism|critical rationalist]] [[Hans Albert]] argues that it is impossible to prove any truth with certainty, even in logic and mathematics. This argument is called the [[Münchhausen trilemma]].

==Proponents==
Historically, fallibilism is most strongly associated with Charles Sanders Peirce, [[John Dewey]], and other [[Pragmatism|pragmatists]], who use it in their attacks on [[foundationalism]] (the view that any system of rationally justified beliefs must rest on a set of properly basic beliefs—that is, beliefs that are accepted, and rightly accepted, directly, without any evidence or rational support whatsoever). However, fallibilist themes are already present in the views of both [[Philosophical_skepticism#Ancient_Greek_skepticism|ancient Greek skeptics]], such as [[Carneades]], and modern skeptics, such as [[David Hume]]. Most versions of ancient and modern skepticism, excepting [[Pyrrhonism]], depend on claims (e.g., that knowledge requires certainty, or that people cannot know that skeptical hypotheses are false) that fallibilists deny.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, ''Epistemology'', pp. 122-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another proponent of fallibilism is [[Karl Popper]], who builds his [[theory of knowledge]], [[critical rationalism]], on [[falsifiability]]. Fallibilism has been employed by Quine to attack, among other things, the distinction between [[analytic proposition|analytic]] and [[synthetic proposition|synthetic]] statements.&lt;ref&gt;W. V. O. Quine, "Two Dogmas of Empiricism," http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral fallibilism==
Moral fallibilism is a specific subset of the broader [[epistemology|epistemological]] fallibilism outlined above. In the debate between moral [[Moral subjectivism|subjectivism]] and moral [[Moral universalism|objectivism]], moral fallibilism holds out a third plausible stance: that objectively true [[morality|moral]] standards may exist, but they cannot be reliably or conclusively determined by humans. This avoids the problems associated with the relativism of subjectivism by retaining the idea that morality is not a matter of mere opinion, while offering an account for the conflict between differing objective moralities. Notable proponents of such views are [[Isaiah Berlin]] ([[value pluralism]]) and [[Bernard Williams]] ([[perspectivism]]).

==Criticism==
Nearly all philosophers today are fallibilists in some sense of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Hetherington, "Fallibilism," Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Few would claim that knowledge requires absolute certainty, or deny that scientific claims are revisable (though some philosophers recently argue for some version of infallibilist knowledge&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{cite journal |last1=Moon |first1=Andrew |title=Warrant does entail truth |journal=Synthese |volume=184 |page=287-297 |doi=10.1007/s11229-010-9815-2}}; {{cite journal |last1=Dutant |first1=Julien |title=How to be an infallibilist |journal=Philosophical Issues |date=2016 |volume=26 |pages=148-171 |doi=10.1111/phis.12085}}; and {{cite journal |last1=Benton |first1=Matthew |title=Knowledge, hope, and fallibilism |journal=Synthese |date=2018 |pages=1-17 |doi=10.1007/s11229-018-1794-8 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11229-018-1794-8 |accessdate=25 July 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). But many philosophers would challenge "global" forms of fallibilism, such as the claim that no beliefs are conclusively justified. Historically, many Western philosophers from [[Plato]] to Augustine to [[René Descartes]] have argued that some human beliefs are infallibly known. Plausible candidates for infallible beliefs include beliefs about logical truths ("Either Jones is a Democrat or Jones is not a Democrat"), beliefs about immediate appearances ("It seems that I see a patch of blue"), and incorrigible beliefs (i.e., beliefs that are true in virtue of being believed, such as Descartes' "I think, therefore I am"). Many others, however, have taken even these types of beliefs to be fallible.&lt;ref&gt;Haack, "Philosophy of Logics", Chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- [This next bit needs some kind of citation, it comes out of nowhere]
Though some contemporary philosophers would deny that any of these sorts of beliefs are conclusively justified, most adhere to the traditional view.

'''Fisher's geometric model''' ('''FGM''') is an [[evolution]]ary model of the [[effect size]]s and effect on [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of spontaneous [[mutations]]&lt;ref name=fisher&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=Ronald|title=[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]|year=1930|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed by [[Ronald Fisher]] to explain the distribution of effects of mutations that could contribute to [[adaptation (biology)|adaptative]] evolution.&lt;ref name=brief-history&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orr|first=Allen|title=The genetic theory of adaptation: a brief history|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|year=2005|volume=6|pages=119–127|doi=10.1038/nrg1523|url=http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v6/n2/full/nrg1523.html|pmid=15716908|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptualization==
Sometimes referred to as the Fisher-Orr model, Fisher's model addresses the problem of adaptation (and, to some extent, [[complexity]]), and continues to be a point of reference in contemporary research on the genetic and evolutionary consequences of [[pleiotropy]].&lt;ref name=Gunter&gt;{{citation |first1=Günter P. |last1=Wagner |first2=Jianzhi |last2=Zhang |title=The pleiotropic structure of the genotype–phenotype map: the evolvability of complex organisms |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |issue=12 |pages=204–213 |date=March 2011 |doi=10.1038/nrg2949 |url=http://www.umich.edu/~zhanglab/publications/2011/Wagner_2011_NRG_12_204.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model has two forms, a geometric formalism, and a [[microscope]] analogy.  A microscope which has many knobs to adjust the lenses to obtain a sharp image has little chance of obtaining an optimally functioning image by randomly turning the knobs. The chances of a clear image are not so bad if the number of knobs is low, but the chances will decrease dramatically if the number of adjustable [[parameter]]s (knobs) is larger than two or three. Fisher introduced a geometric metaphor, which eventually became known as Fisher's geometric model.&lt;ref name=Gunter/&gt;&lt;ref name=fisher/&gt;

In his model, Fisher argues that the functioning of the microscope is analogous to the fitness of an organism. The performance of the microscope depends on the state of various knobs that can be manipulated, corresponding to distances and orientations of various lenses, whereas the fitness of an organism depends on the state of various [[phenotype|phenotypic]] character such as body size and [[beak]] length and depth. The increase in the fitness of an organism by random changes is then analogous to the attempt to improve the performance of a microscope through randomly changing the positions of the knobs on the microscope.

The analogy between the microscope and an evolving organism can be formalized by representing the phenotype of an organism as a point in a [[Clustering high-dimensional data|high-dimensional data space]], where the dimensions of that space correspond to the [[trait (biological)|trait]]s of the organism. The more independent dimensions of variation the phenotype has, the more difficult is improvement resulting from random changes. If there are many different ways to change a phenotype it becomes very unlikely that a random change affects the right combination of traits in the right way to improve fitness. Fisher noted that the smaller the effect, the higher the chance that a change is beneficial. At one extreme, changes with infinitesimally small effect have a 50% chance of improving fitness. This argument led to the widely held position that evolution proceeds by small mutations.

Furthermore, Orr discovered that both the fixation probability of a beneficial mutation and the fitness gain that is conferred by the fixation of the beneficial mutation decrease with organismal complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Orr |first=H. A. |title=Adaptation and the cost of complexity |journal=Evolution |volume=54 |pages=13–20 |year=2000 |url=http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/pdffiles/adaptation_orr.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb00002.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the predicted rate of adaptation decreases quickly with the rise in organismal complexity, a theoretical finding known as the ‘cost of complexity’.

'''Frederic Will''' is a Midwestern American writer.  Will has been active in many genres: poetry, fiction, [[cultural history]], philosophy, translation, travel memoir.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
The American poet/novelist/critic/translator Frederic Will was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] in 1928. His parents, Samuel and Constance, moved the family to the [[Midwest]] in 1930; Will's father was for the next 25 years a professor of French at the [[University of Illinois]] and at [[Indiana University]]. His mother was a bilingual (English/French) housewife. The house in which he was brought up was lined with bookshelves of French literary classics—Montaigne and Rabelais featured, in leather bindings cut for them on the Left Bank. Will was raised on the campus of the University of Illinois, where—except during two years of [[asthma]] recovery in [[Arizona]]—he remained until going to [[Phillips Andover]] for his senior year of high school. His subsequent education was at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] (1946), Laval University in Quebec, and at Indiana University (B.A. in Classics, 1949), and [[Yale University]] (PhD Comparative Literature, 1954). Laval, with its pre-modern Thomist atmosphere, was the deepest of these forays into learning from others.

===Personal life===
Will is married, has six children, and lives both in [[Mount Vernon, Iowa]] and in [[Delta State]], Nigeria. He has traveled widely, both in Asia and Africa, and has only two more locations on his must-visit list: Russia and Zaire. Writing and traveling seem to him activities that call on one another, as though the appetite of the world to be named accompanied the writing instrument of the seeing traveler.

===Career===
Will has taught Comparative Literature, Classics, and Translation Workshops at various Universities in the United States and abroad: [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] (1951–54), [[Penn State]] (1955–60), [[University of Texas]] (1960–65), [[University of Iowa]] (1965–70, 1983–85), [[University of Wisconsin]] (1967), [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] (1970–83), [[University of Colorado]] (1978), [[Deep Springs College]] (2004–06), Instituto de Estudios Criticos (2007). He was Co-Director of the University of Iowa International Writing Program (1983-1985). He was Overseer and President of [[Mellen University]] (1990–1999). Abroad he has taught at the Universities of Tuebingen, Tunis, Ivory Coast, Chad, Mizoram (India), Chang'sha China (Hunan Normal). He currently teaches for the Humanities University (humanitiesuniversity.org or humanitiesinstitute.org) where he is Vice President for Research.

* Fulbright Senior Specialist: Chad (2003), Ivory Coast (2005).

===Editorial work===
Founding editor (with [[William Arrowsmith]]) of ''Arion, A Journal of Classical Culture'' (1962--) University of Texas. Founder and editor of ''Micromegas, A Journal of Poetry in Translation'' (1965–75). Arion marked a turning point in Anglo-American classical studies, replacing positivist 'contribution studies' by more imaginative and daring efforts to open the classical tradition into its blazing richness. Micromegas, like Robert Bly's ''The Sixties'', was a single-handed effort to enrich American poetry with the bloodstreams of at first contemporary Latin-American poetry, and then, in subsequent issues, of a wide variety of national issues—French, German, Hungarian, Greek, Icelandic.

===Archival material===
Will's literary and editorial papers (1962–) are in the Humanities Research Center, University of Texas.The collection includes hundreds of pages of manuscripts of both published and unpublished materials, in addition to an extensive correspondence dating back to the University of Texas Renaissance, under HRC Director, Harry Ransom.

'''Gustavo Gutiérrez Merino''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Dominican Order|OP]]}} (born 8 June 1928) is a [[Peru]]vian philosopher, theologian, and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest regarded as one of the founders of [[liberation theology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cornell|first=George W.|title=Founder of liberation theology deals with acclaim and criticism|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=l6tAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vOYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6799,1242614&amp;dq=gustavo+gutierrez&amp;hl=en|accessdate=1 September 2010|newspaper=Lawrence Journal-World|date=August 6, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently holds the [[John Francis O'Hara|John Cardinal O'Hara]] Professorship of Theology at the [[University of Notre Dame]], and has previously been a professor at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Peru]] and a visiting professor at many major universities in North America and Europe.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theology.nd.edu/people/all/gutierrez-gustavo/index.shtml|title=Gustavo Gutierrez, O.P.|publisher=University of Notre Dame|work=Department of Theology: People|accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutiérrez is a member of the [[Peruvian Academy of Language]], and a founder of Instituto Bartolomé de las Casas. In 1993, he was awarded the [[Legion of Honor]] by the French government for his tireless work. In 2002 Gutiérrez was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and in 2003 he received the [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Príncipe de Asturias]] award. In 2016, he received the [[Pacem in Terris Award]] from [[St. Ambrose University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pacem in Terris Past Recipients|url=http://davenportdiocese.org/past-recipients|website=Catholic Diocese of Davenport|accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Gutiérrez was afflicted with [[osteomyelitis]] as an adolescent, and was frequently bed-ridden. He had to use a wheelchair from age 12 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=2755|title=Remembering the Poor: An Interview with Gustavo Gutiérrez|last=Hartnett|first=Daniel|date=February 3, 2003|newspaper=America Magazine|accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began studying in the faculty of medicine of the [[National University of San Marcos]] in [[Peru]] in order to become a [[psychiatrist]], then he realized he wanted to become a priest.&lt;ref name="bio (spanish)2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensayistas.org/critica/liberacion/casadont/gutierrez2.htm|title=Gustavo Gutierrez biography (spanish)|publisher=Steven Casadont|work=Gustavo Gutiérrez (1928)|accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his theological studies in the Theology Faculty of Leuven in Belgium and in Lyon in France, where he studied under [[Henri de Lubac]], [[Yves Congar]], [[Marie-Dominique Chenu|Marie Dominique Chenu]], Christian Ducoq, and several others.&lt;ref&gt;Botella Cubells, Vicente (8 de noviembre de 2011)). «Gustavo Gutiérrez, padre de la Teología de la Liberación». Facultad de Teología. Valencia.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also here where Gutiérrez was introduced to the Dominican and Jesuit ideologies, and was influenced by the work of [[Edward Schillebeeckx]], [[Karl Rahner]], [[Hans Küng]], and [[Johann Baptist Metz]].&lt;ref&gt;Gutiérrez, Gustavo (2001) "Quehacer teológico y experiencia eclesial"; J.J.Tamayo y J.Bosch, eds., ''Panorama de la Teología Latinoamericana'', Estella.&lt;/ref&gt; His time in Europe influenced Gutiérrez to discuss the openness of the Church to the contemporary world. He was also influenced by Protestant theologians such as [[Karl Barth]] and social scientists such as [[François Perroux]] and his idea of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Gorringe|first=Timothy|title=Theology and Human Liberation|date=1999-08-12|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198752462.003.0007|work=Karl Barth|pages=268–290|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en-US|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198752462.003.0007|isbn=9780198752462|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQDjVWSEvb0C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=Fran%C3%A7ois+Perroux,++gustavo+gutierrez&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3yZJ2LMkj_&amp;sig=RVCs0Lv-wNRahmN5oGbLZeq4dlg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlu8Xiz63cAhUMi6wKHZ-rARsQ6AEIdjAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Fran%C3%A7ois%20Perroux,%20%20gustavo%20gutierrez&amp;f=false|title=Development Cooperation in a Fractured Global Order: An Arduous Transition|last=Sagasti|first=Francisco R.|last2=Alcalde|first2=Gonzalo|date=1999|publisher=IDRC|isbn=9780889368897|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Gutiérrez was ordained a priest.

== Foundations of liberation theology ==
When he returned to Peru, Gutiérrez began to formulate his understanding of Latin American "reality" – the foundation and driving force of [[liberation theology]].&lt;ref&gt;"Gustavo Gutierrez: Essential Writings"; Nickoloff, James. Fortress Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; He states: "I come from a continent in which more than 60% of the population lives in a state of poverty, and 82% of those find themselves in extreme poverty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercaba.org/ARTICULOS/G/gustavo_gutierrez.htm#JUAN%20DE%20LA%20CRUZ%20DESDE%20AM%C3%89RICA%20LATINA|title=Juan de la Cruz desde America Latina|last2=|first2=|date=1991|access-date=March 9, 2015|last1=Gutierrez|first1=Gustavo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutiérrez focused his efforts on the rediscovery of love thy neighbor as the central axiom of Christian life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=15H6rHBJVt0C&amp;pg=PT257&amp;lpg=PT257&amp;dq=love+thy+neighbor,+gutierrez&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AemPTFuzkP&amp;sig=Xq2GNdM7KMeihY4kpjxbx7Z8Dsk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIgoOrw67cAhXKVbwKHd1ADZoQ6AEISTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Gutierrez&amp;f=false|title=Awakening Vocation: A Theology of Christian Call|last=Hahnenberg|first=Edward P.|date=2010-07-01|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=9780814657331|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ndsmcobserver.com/2014/09/gutierrez-highlights-popes-preferential-option-for-the-poor/|title=Gutiérrez highlights Pope's 'preferential option for the poor' // The Observer|date=2014-09-26|work=The Observer|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An outline of Gutiérrez's theological proposal was drafted in his conference "Towards a Theology of Liberation" during the Second Meeting of Priests and Laity in Chimbote, Peru, between July 21 and 25, 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Gutiérrez, Gustavo (1968) "Hacia una teología de la liberación. Consultado el 23 de julio de 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In this proposal, he cites on multiple occasions [[Vatican II]]'s [[Gaudium et spes|''Gaudium et Spes'']] and [[Paul VI]]'s [[Populorum progressio|''Populorum Progressio'']]. To Gutiérrez, the source of the problems of Latin America was the sin manifested in an unjust social structure. His solution to this problem was to emphasize the dignity of the poor by prioritizing the glory of God present in them.&lt;ref&gt;Botella Cubells, Vicente (8 de noviembre de 2011)). «Gustavo Gutiérrez, padre de la Teología de la Liberación». Facultad de Teología. Valencia.&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective would be refined over the next five years, until Gutiérrez published ''A Theology of Liberation'' in 1973.

[[Liberation theology]] thus emerged as a biblical analysis of poverty. Gutiérrez distinguished two forms of poverty: a "scandalous state" and a "spiritual childhood." He noted that, while the former is abhorred by God, the second is valued. Gutiérrez identified that each form of poverty was present in Latin America, wherein one hungers for bread and for God. It is only through the manifestation of a committed faith that the purposes of God can be manifested to man, regardless of the color or social class under which he was born. Liberation theology insists on prioritizing the gift of life as the supreme manifestation of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/road-peace/gustavo-gutierrez-and-preferential-option-poor|title=Gustavo Gutierrez and the preferential option for the poor|date=2011-11-08|work=National Catholic Reporter|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Option for the poor ==
Gutiérrez calls for understanding the reality of the poor. Being poor is not simply lacking the economic resources for development. On the contrary, Gutiérrez understands poverty as "a way of living, of thinking, of loving, of praying, of believing and waiting, of spending free time, of fighting for life." On the other hand, the Dominican emphasizes that poverty is the result of society. While many theologians oversimplify poverty's social roots, for Gutiérrez the origin of poverty is much more complex. In Latin America, it originates from the times of the conquest and to that is added several political, geographical, and personal factors.&lt;ref&gt;Klaiber, Jeffery. "Prophets and Populists: Liberation Theology 1968-1988";Academy of American Franciscan History, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

The proclamation of the gospel in the midst of the unjust situation in Latin America leads to a praxis based on principles derived from the word of God. In the article ''Theology and Poverty'', Gutiérrez recalls that this option should lead to three well-defined actions. The preferential option for the poor unfolds as a fundamental axis of the Christian life on three levels:
# The announcement and testimony of the reign of God denounces poverty.
# The intelligence of faith reveals essential aspects of God and provides a perspective for theological work.
# Walking in the footsteps of Jesus, otherwise known as spirituality, is, on the deepest level, the basis on which everything else rests.

The main biblical foundation for this [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] lies in the [[Kenosis|kenotic]] incarnation of Christ. To Gutiérrez, the ministry of Christ among the rejected and despised of his time is a clear example for the contemporary Church. Furthermore, "the incarnation is an act of love. Christ becomes man, dies and rises to liberate us, and makes us enjoy freedom. To die and be resurrected with Christ is to overcome death and enter into a new life. The cross and the resurrection seal our freedom." The freedom of Christ is seen by Gutiérrez as the source of spiritual and economic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_mBYzhd0GsC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;dq=The+cross+and+the+resurrection+seal+our+freedom+gustavo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DydR6SMt_5&amp;sig=_Jti8rg6nseaG4II7cDyGcg2sj0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3-YCYzq3cAhUMeawKHXD8AXwQ6AEIUjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20cross%20and%20the%20resurrection%20seal%20our%20freedom%20gustavo&amp;f=false|title=Essential Writings|last=Gutiérrez|first=Gustavo|publisher=Fortress Press|year=|isbn=9781451410242|location=|pages=300|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theological reflection on liberation is not just a simple discourse without practical and concrete implications. Reflection on the situation of the poor leads to what liberation theologians call "liberating praxis", where they attempt to rectify the process by which the faith of the Church builds the economic, spiritual and intellectual liberation of socially oppressed peoples as fulfillment of the kingdom of God. The liberating praxis, then, has its basis in the love that God manifests for us and in the sense of solidarity and fellowship that should exist in interpersonal relationships among the children of God.  These are concepts that Gutierrez developed in concert with fellow theologian [[Paulo Freire]], whose 1971 seminal work ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'' explored the concept of praxis and a preferential option for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Christian."The Emergence of Liberation Theology". University of Chicago Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Pedagogy-Oppressed-Anniversary-Paulo-Freire/dp/0826412769|title=Pedagogy of the Oppressed, 30th Anniversary Edition|last=Freire|first=Paulo|last2=Macedo|first2=Donaldo|date=2000-09-01|publisher=Continuum|year=|isbn=9780826412768|edition=30th Anniversary|location=|pages=|language=English|translator-last=Ramos|translator-first=Myra Bergman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Liberation theology originated as a call to all believers in Latin America to resume the biblical commitment to the poor. Gutiérrez's continuous message on the reality of this world serves as a rebuke to those who have forgotten this sphere of Christian love. Gutiérrez's thought has marked, consciously or unconsciously, all of Latin American theology. This influence can be observed from the evangelical proposal of the "[[integral mission]]" developed years after the origin of liberation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.micahnetwork.org/events/latin-america-consultation-integral-mission|title=Latin America Consultation on Integral Mission {{!}} Micah Network|website=www.micahnetwork.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the development of social ministries within the evangelical churches in the last decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/latin-america|title=Latin America — World Council of Churches|website=www.oikoumene.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his most prominent followers are [[:es:Hugo Echegaray|Hugo Echegaray]] and [[:es:Luis Felipe Zegarra Russo|Luis Felipe Zegarra Russo]]. His friends include the German theologian Gerhard Ludwig Müller, the former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. On the subject of Gustavo Gutiérrez's thought, of which he was a student, Müller stated: "The theology of Gustavo Gutiérrez, how it is considered, is orthodox because it is orthopractic and teaches us the correct Christian way of acting, since it derives from authentic faith."&lt;ref&gt;Vatican Insider: "Un teologo della liberazione al Santo Ufficio?" 15-10-2011&lt;/ref&gt; On Gutierrez's 90th birthday, in 2018, Pope Francis thanked him for his contributions "to the church and humanity through your theological service and your preferential love for the poor and discarded of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Arocho Esteves | first = Junno | date = June 7, 2018 | title = Pope Francis wishes "father of liberation theology" happy birthday | periodical = [[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]] | url = https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2018/06/07/pope-francis-wishes-father-liberation-theology-happy-birthday | accessdate = June 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While Gutierrez's positions were never censored by the Church, he had been asked to modify some of his propositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/11/vatican-new-chapter-liberation-theology-founder-gustavo-gutierrez|title=Catholic church warms to liberation theology as founder heads to Vatican|last=Kirchgaessner|first=Stephanie|last2=Watts|first2=Jonathan|date=2015-05-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hagakure.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''The Book of the Samurai'']]
'''''Hagakure''''' ([[Kyūjitai]]: {{nihongo2|葉隱}}; [[Shinjitai]]: {{nihongo2|葉隠}}; meaning ''Hidden by the Leaves'' or ''hidden leaves''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Yamamoto|last=Tsunetomo|others=Wilson, William Scott (trans.)|title=Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai|publisher=Stackpole Books|year=2002|isbn=4-7700-2916-0|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{Nihongo|'''''Hagakure Kikigaki'''''|葉隠聞書}}, is a practical and spiritual guide for a warrior, drawn from a collection of commentaries by the clerk [[Yamamoto Tsunetomo]], former retainer to [[Nabeshima Mitsushige]], the third ruler of what is now [[Saga Prefecture]] in [[Japan]]. {{illm|Tashiro Tsuramoto|ja|田代陣基}} compiled these commentaries from his conversations with Tsunetomo from 1709 to 1716; however, it was not published until many years afterwards. Written during a time when there was no officially sanctioned samurai fighting, the book grapples with the dilemma of maintaining a warrior class in the absence of war and reflects the author's nostalgia for a world that had disappeared before he was born. ''Hagakure'' was largely forgotten for two centuries after its composition, but it came to be viewed as the definitive guide of the samurai during the [[Pacific War]]. ''Hagakure'' is also known as ''The Book of the Samurai'', ''Analects of Nabeshima'' or ''Hagakure Analects''.

==Content==
The book records Tsunetomo's views on [[bushido]], the [[warrior code]] of the [[samurai]]. ''Hagakure'' is sometimes said to assert that bushido is really the "Way of [[Death|Dying]]" or living as though one was already dead, and that a samurai must be willing to die at any moment in order to be true to his lord. His saying "the way of the warrior is death" was a summation of the willingness to sacrifice that ''bushido'' codified.&lt;ref&gt;Meirion and Susie Harries, ''Soldiers of the Sun: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial Japanese Army'' p 7 {{ISBN|0-394-56935-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==

After the Tokugawa shogunate suppressed the [[Shimabara Rebellion]] in 1638, Japan experienced no warfare for about two centuries. Private feuding and dueling between samurai was also suppressed. Yamamoto Tsunetomo was born in 1659, after the end of officially sanctioned samurai fighting. He had no personal combat experience and when he was employed, he worked as a scribe. By the late 1600s and early 1700s, samurai faced the dilemma of maintaining a warrior class in the absence of war, and ''Hagakure'' reflects this uncertainty. Written late in the author's life, the book also reflects his nostalgia for a world that had disappeared before his birth.&lt;ref name=ravina-audio&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark J. Ravina|title=Understanding Japan: A Cultural History|publisher=The Great Courses. Smithsonian Institution|year=2015|pages=6:34:30-6:44:10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ravina-notes&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark J. Ravina|title=Understanding Japan: A Cultural History.

''Hagakure'' was largely forgotten for two centuries. The first modern edition appeared in 1900 and it did not receive much attention during the first decades of the century. ''Hagakure'' came to be viewed as a definitive book of the samurai only during the Pacific War. According to [[Mark Ravina]], "Rather than an account of samurai tradition, this work serves as an example of what the Japanese army thought Japanese soldiers should believe about samurai practice."&lt;ref name=ravina-audio/&gt;&lt;ref name=ravina-notes/&gt;

The '''Jan Hus Educational Foundation''' was founded in May 1980 by a group of British [[philosopher]]s at the [[University of Oxford]]. The group operated an underground education network in the former [[Czechoslovakia]], at the time under [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist Party rule]], running seminars in [[philosophy]], smuggling in books, and arranging for Western academics to give lectures.

The Foundation was deemed a "Centre of Ideological Subversion" by the Czech police, and several of the visiting philosophers, including [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Roger Scruton]] and [[Anthony Kenny]], were arrested or placed on the "Index of Undesirable Persons".&lt;ref name=Day1999p5&gt;Barbara Day, ''The Velvet Philosophers'', The Claridge Press, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jJNYvDr8YBgC&amp;pg=PA5 5].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Scruton, ''England: An Elegy'', A&amp;C Black, 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Yk4YAB8VPHwC&amp;pg=PA126 126ff].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The foundation was created after Czech dissident philosopher [[Julius Tomin]] wrote in 1978 to four Western universities asking them to support philosophy seminars he was holding in his apartment in Prague. The seminars were known as ''bytové semináře'' ("home seminars").&lt;ref name=Day1999p5/&gt; Tomin called his discussion group "[[Jan Patočka]] University", after the Czech philosopher who died in 1977 after being interrogated by police.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ujNWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=geYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3789,3084659&amp;dq=julius+tomin&amp;hl=en "Prisoners that Moscow tries to hide"], Associated Press, October 11, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nick Cohen, "The Pub Philosopher", ''The Independent'' magazine, 18 November 1989 ([http://www.juliustomin.org/images/Pub_Philosopher.pdf courtesy link]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Rule, [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0717F63A550C748CDDA80994D0484D81 "Swindon Journal; The Thinker's Pub, With a Resident Philosopher"], ''The New York Times'', 7 November 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter was sent during a period when correspondence from the [[Eastern Bloc]] was slow and uncertain; one commentator compared it to sending a message in a bottle. Only one letter is known to have arrived at its intended destination, the philosophy faculty at the University of Oxford, one year after it was sent. The letter was read out to the faculty by [[William Newton-Smith]] of [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] during a meeting in January 1979; the final item on the agenda was "Letter from Czechoslovakian philosophers". Those present voted to offer financial support and to send two philosophers to address the seminars. The minutes noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was agreed that the Chairman ([[J. L. Mackie]]) should send a letter of support to the Czechoslovakian philosophers. It was agreed to ask the Lit. Hum [Literae Humaniores] Board to make a grant to cover the cost of sending two members of the Philosophy Sub-Faculty to meet with the Czechoslovakian philosophers."&lt;ref&gt;Day 1999, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Seminars==
[[Kathy Wilkes]] of [[St. Hilda's College, Oxford|St. Hilda's]] and [[Steven Lukes]] of Balliol were the first philosophers to visit Tomin, in March and April 1979.&lt;ref name=Day1999p33/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more on Wilkes, see Bill Newton-Smith, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/19/guardianobituaries.obituaries "Kathy Wilkes"], ''The Guardian'', 19 September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkes took books and gave several seminars, the first a talk on [[Aristotle]] at Tomin's apartment in Keramická Street from 6 pm to midnight, and another a few days later, to 25 people, on "Identity of Human Personality".&lt;ref name=Day1999p33/&gt;

When she returned to Oxford, Wilkes asked its [[Literae Humaniores]] board for financial support (at that time philosophy was a sub-faculty of Literae Humaniores), and urged other philosophers to pay a visit, to be coordinated by William Newton-Smith. An article appeared about the seminars in the ''New Statesman'' in May. Wilkes wrote one for ''The Guardian'' a few days later and another appeared at the end of May in ''Isis''. The philosophy faculty agreed to send [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] of [[All Souls, Oxford|All Souls]], and books were purchased with a grant from the Literae Humaniores board.&lt;ref name=Day1999p33&gt;Day 1999, pp. 34–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others who became involved included [[Alan Montefiore]] and [[Anthony Kenny]] from Oxford; [[Ernest Gellner]] from [[King's College, Cambridge]]; [[Roger Scruton]] from [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College, London]]; Anthony Savile from [[King's College, London]]; and [[Thomas Nagel]] from [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;Day 1999, 33ff; for Gellner, 16; for Scruton and Savile, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Branches of the Foundation sprang up in France and Germany. [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Ernst Tugendhat]], who was born in [[Brno]], all travelled to Czechoslovakia to conduct a seminar.&lt;ref name=Derrida/&gt;

==Arrests, expulsions==
Several philosophers who travelled to give seminars were detained by the Czech police or expelled from the country. Newton-Smith was detained in March 1980, as was Anthony Kenny, then Master of Balliol, the following month. Kathy Wilkes was escorted to the airport in June.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Hills, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HokxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=caQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1189,1200994&amp;dq=julius+tomin&amp;hl=en "Oxford dons battle Czech secret police"], ''The Montreal Gazette'', 4 June 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Scruton was detained in 1985 and placed on the Index of Undesirable Persons.&lt;ref&gt;Day 1999, 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent arrest was that of Jacques Derrida, in [[Prague]] in December 1981. He spent 24 hours in custody, supposedly for drug smuggling, after the police planted drugs in his suitcase.&lt;ref name=Derrida&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/01/world/around-the-world-french-philosopher-is-seized-in-prague.html "French Philosopher Is Seized in Prague"], Associated Press, 1 January 1982; Day 1999, 92ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Vaughan, [http://www.radio.cz/en/section/books/barbara-day-and-the-velvet-philosophers Barbara Day and the Velvet Philosophers"], Radio Prague, 12 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Geoffrey Bennington]], his biographer:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Derrida] goes to Prague to run a clandestine seminar. Followed for several days, stopped at the end of the week, finally arrested at the airport, and, after a police operation on his suitcase in which they pretend to discover a brown powder, he is imprisoned on the charge of "production and trafficking of drugs". Signature campaign for his release. Released ("expelled") from Czechoslovakia after an energetic intervention of [President] [[François Mitterrand]] and the French government.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Bennington, Jacques Derrida, ''Jacques Derrida'', Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1991, 334.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Derrida had been working on [[Franz Kafka]]'s "[[Before the Law]]" at the time—Kafka was born in Prague—and indeed believed the drugs had been planted while he was visiting Kafka's grave. His Czech lawyer said the arrest was like a Kafka story, complete with nudity, photographs and a prison uniform.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Powell, ''Jacques Derrida: A Biography'', London and New York: Continuum, 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AIyvAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151 151].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Velvet Revolution==
The underground network was active until the [[Velvet Revolution]] saw the overthrow of the Communist Party in 1989. The foundation continued to support education in the new [[Czech Republic]]. In October 1998 at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], President [[Václav Havel]] awarded Commemorative Medals of the President of the Republic to the foundation, as well as to Kathy Wilkes and Barbara Day. Roger Scruton was awarded the [[Medal of Merit (Czech Republic)|Medal of Merit]] (First Class) of the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Day 1999, 281–282.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jesuitism''' is a [[casuistic]] approach to moral questions and problems, so called because it was promoted by some [[Jesuits]] of the 17th century. The earliest known citation is 1622.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Some Jesuit theologians,{{who|date=November 2018}} in view of promoting personal responsibility and the respect of [[freedom of conscience]], stressed the importance of the 'case by case' approach to personal moral decisions and ultimately developed and accepted a [[casuistry]] (the study of ''cases of consciences'') where at the time of decision, individual inclinations were more important than the moral law itself.  A British encyclopedia of 1900 claimed that it was "popularly regarded as an attempt to achieve holy ends by unholy means."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Wood-NuttallEncyclopaedia/j/jesuitism.html Nuttall Encyclopædia of General Knowledge]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blaise Pascal]], the French [[mathematician]], religious philosopher and [[Jansenist]] sympathiser, vigorously attacked the moral [[laxism]] of such Jesuits in his famous ''[[Lettres provinciales]]'' of 1656-57.{{cn|date=November 2018}} It is considered suspect by many moral theologians.{{who|date=November 2018}}

'''John David Gosch''' (November 12, 1969; disappeared September 5, 1982) was a 12-year-old [[paperboy (newspaper delivery)|paperboy]] in [[West Des Moines]], [[Iowa]], when he disappeared without a trace on September 5, 1982. He is presumed to have been kidnapped.
{{as of|2018}}, there have been no arrest made and the case is now considered cold but open.

His mother, Noreen Gosch, claimed that Johnny escaped from his captors and visited her with an unidentified man in March 1997. She claimed that her son told her that he had been the victim of a [[pedophile]] organization and had been cast aside when he was too old&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Finney|first1=Daniel P.|title=Cleveland case lifts hopes of Iowa mother, other parents|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/08/missing-children-parents-hope/2144223/|accessdate=August 30, 2015|work=[[USA Today]]|date=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but subsequently feared for his life and lived under an assumed identity, feeling it was not safe to return home. Gosch's father, John, divorced from Noreen since 1993, has publicly stated that he is not sure whether or not such a visit actually occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gosch case resurfaces|url=http://globegazette.com/news/gosch-case-resurfaces/article_ada2b53e-713e-50f9-9372-eb386e614631.html|accessdate=August 30, 2015|work=[[Globe Gazette]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=September 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities have not located Gosch or confirmed Noreen Gosch's account, and his fate continues to be the subject of speculation, [[conspiracy theories]], and dispute.

The case received huge publicity in 2006 when his mother claimed to have found photographs on her doorstep depicting Gosch in captivity. Some of the photos received were claimed to be children from a case in Florida, but one boy in the photos was never identified. Noreen Gosch insists that boy is Johnny.&lt;ref name="GoschWebsite"&gt;[http://www.johnnygosch.com The Johnny Gosch Foundation&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.johnnygosch.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnny Gosch's picture was the first to be featured on [[Photo on a milk carton|milk cartons]] as an attempt to help finding missing children.

==Disappearance==
On Sunday, September 5, 1982, in the suburb of West Des Moines, Johnny Gosch left home before dawn to begin his paper route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Putman|first1=Eileen|title=Missing Children: We've Finally Begun to Recognize the Hell Their Parents Go Through|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&amp;dat=19821123&amp;id=mLZWAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3186,2444927|accessdate=August 30, 2015|work=[[The Gainesville Sun]]|agency=Associated Press|date=November 23, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|last=Boudet|first=Mike|title=Episode 5|website=[[Sword and Scale]]|date=January 29, 2014|url=http://swordandscale.com/sword-and-scale-episode-5/|access-date=October 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was customary for Johnny to awaken his father to help with the route, the boy took only the family's [[miniature dachshund]], Gretchen, with him that morning.&lt;ref name=People1988&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gosch|first1=Noreen|last2=Tamarkin|first2=Civia|title=An Anguished Mother Refuses to Give Up Hope for the Son Who Vanished Six Years Ago|journal=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=October 10, 1988|volume=30|issue=15|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20100155,00.html|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other paper carriers for ''[[The Des Moines Register]]'' would later report having seen Gosch at the paper drop, picking up his newspapers. It was the last sighting of Gosch that can be corroborated by multiple witnesses.

A neighbor named Mike reported that he observed Gosch talking to a stocky man in a blue two-toned [[Ford Fairmont]] with Nebraska plates;&lt;ref name=whotookjohnny&gt;"Who Took Johnny," RumuR, Inc. (2014). Documentary film.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="QuadCity"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cook|first1=Linda|title=Filmmaker: Questions remain in paper carrier's disappearance|url=http://qctimes.com/news/local/filmmaker-questions-remain-in-paper-carrier-s-disappearance/article_0da62a7c-1de4-55bb-bff6-deff486a952d.html|accessdate=October 10, 2017|work=[[Quad-City Times]]|date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike did not know what was discussed because he was observing from his bedroom window. As Gosch headed home, Mike noticed another man following Gosch.&lt;ref name="QuadCity"/&gt; Another witness, John Rossi, saw a man in a blue car talking to Gosch and "thought something was strange". He looked at the license plate, but could not recall the plate number. He said, "I keep hoping I'll wake up in the middle of the night and see that number on the license plate as distinctly as night and day, but that hasn't happened." Rossi underwent [[hypnosis]] and told police some of the numbers and that the plate was from [[Warren County, Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ricchiardi |first1=Sherry |last2=Santiago |first2=Frank |title=Year of agony for Gosches, lone witness |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21751939/the_des_moines_register/ |accessdate=July 11, 2018 |work=The Des Moines Register |date=September 4, 1983 |page=1A, 7A |via=Newspapers.com}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John and Noreen Gosch, Johnny's parents, began receiving phone calls from customers along their son's route, complaining of undelivered papers.&lt;ref name=People1988/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN2009&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosenbaum|first1=Philip|last2=Grace|first2=Nancy|title=Iowa paper boy vanished on route in 1982|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/11/09/grace.coldcase.gosch/index.html|accessdate=August 30, 2015|work=[[CNN]]|date=November 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; John performed a cursory search of the neighborhood around 6 a.m. He immediately found Johnny's wagon full of newspapers two blocks from their home.&lt;ref name=CNN2009/&gt;

The Gosches immediately contacted the West Des Moines police department, and reported Johnny's disappearance. Noreen, in her public statements and her book ''Why Johnny Can't Come Home'', has been critical of what she perceives as a slow reaction time from authorities, and of the policy at the time that Gosch could not be classified as a missing person until 72 hours had passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stafford|first1=Margaret|title=Pain, struggle: search for missing son|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1928&amp;dat=19840905&amp;id=M3sgAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6831,710111|accessdate=August 30, 2015|work=[[Lewiston Daily Sun]]|agency=Associated Press|date=September 5, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ta|first1=Linh|title=Johnny Gosch: An Iowa kidnapping that helped change the nation|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2017/09/04/johnny-gosch-kidnapping-west-des-moines-child-abduction-responses/595639001/|accessdate=October 10, 2017|work=The Des Moines Register|date=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By her estimation, the police did not arrive to take her report for a full 45 minutes.&lt;ref name="QuadCity"/&gt;

Initially, the police came to believe that Gosch was a runaway, but later they changed their statement suggested that Gosch was kidnapped but they were unable to establish a viable motive.&lt;ref name="dmregister.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Santiago|first1=Frank|title=Noreen Gosch: I saw Johnny|url=http://www.dmregister.com/news/stories/c4788993/6798176.html|accessdate=August 30, 2015|work=[[The Des Moines Register]]|date=February 7, 1999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305100428/http://www.dmregister.com/news/stories/c4788993/6798176.html|archivedate=March 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; They turned up little evidence and arrested no suspects in connection with the case.&lt;ref name=Rood2006/&gt;

A few months after his September 1982 disappearance, Noreen Gosch has said her son was spotted in Oklahoma, when a boy yelled to a woman for help before being dragged off by two men.&lt;ref name="LATimes1990"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-05/news/mn-1010_1_west-des-moines-police|title=Body Is Found; Lost Paperboy Case Reopened|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=April 5, 1990|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, several [[private investigator]]s have assisted the Gosches with the search for their son. Among them are [[Jim Rothstein]], a retired [[New York City]] police detective&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johnny Gosch Still Missing|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1103/02/ng.01.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=October 11, 2017|date=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ted Gunderson]], a retired chief of the [[Los Angeles]] [[FBI]] branch.

In 1984, Gosch's photograph appeared alongside that of Juanita Rafaela Estavez on milk cartons across America; they were the second and third abducted children to have their plights publicized in this way. The first was [[Etan Patz]].&lt;ref name=Latimes2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Susman|first1=Tina|title=Etan Patz case: 6 other missing-child cases that made national news|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-etan-patz-missing-children-20150509-story.html|accessdate=August 30, 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Another missing paperboy ===
On August 12, 1984, Eugene Martin, another Des Moines-area paperboy, disappeared under similar circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wednesday will be long day for Gosch's|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14328790/johnny_gosch_and_eugene_martin/|accessdate=October 11, 2017|work=[[Sioux City Journal]]|agency=Associated Press|date=September 3, 1984|pages=3|via=Newspapers.com}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He disappeared while delivering newspapers on the south side of Des Moines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Have you seen this child? Eugene Martin|url=http://www.missingkids.com/poster/NCMC/601815|publisher=[[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]]|accessdate=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authorities were unable to prove a connection between the two cases, yet Noreen Gosch claims that she was personally informed of the abduction a few months in advance by a private investigator who was searching for her son. She was told the kidnapping "would take place the second weekend in August 1984 and it would be a paperboy from the southside of Des Moines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case FAQs|url=http://www.johnnygosch.com/CaseFAQ.htm|publisher=The Johnny Gosch Foundation|accessdate=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noreen Gosch's claims==
According to Noreen Gosch's account, she was awakened around 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. one morning in March 1997 by a knock at her apartment door. Waiting outside was Johnny Gosch, now 27, accompanied by an unidentified man. Gosch said she immediately recognized her son, who opened his shirt to reveal a birthmark on his chest. "We talked about an hour or an hour and a half. He was with another man, but I have no idea who the person was. Johnny would look over to the other person for approval to speak," says Gosch. "He didn't say where he is living or where he was going."&lt;ref name="dmregister.com"/&gt;

In a 2005 interview, Gosch said, "The night that he came here, he was wearing jeans and a shirt and had a coat on because it was March. It was cold and his hair was long; it was shoulder-length and it was straight and dyed black." After the visit, she had the FBI create a picture she says looked like Johnny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Has Johnny Gosch Been Found?|url=http://www.kwwl.com/Global/story.asp?S=3226392|accessdate=October 10, 2017|publisher=[[KWWL (TV)|KWWL]]|date=April 18, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050827011531/http://www.kwwl.com/Global/story.asp?S=3226392|archivedate=August 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosch self-published a book in 2000 titled ''Why Johnny Can't Come Home''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Johnny Can't Come Home|url=http://www.johnnygosch.com/book.htm|publisher=The Johnny Gosch Foundation|accessdate=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book presents her understanding of what her son went through, based on the [[original research]] of various private investigators and her son's visit.

On September 1, 2006, Gosch reported that she found photographs left at her front door, some of which she posted on her website. One color photo shows three boys bound and gagged. She claims that a black-and-white photo appears to show 12-year-old Johnny Gosch with his mouth gagged, his hands and feet tied, and an apparent [[human branding|human brand]] on his shoulder. A third photo shows a man, possibly dead, who may have something tied around his neck.&lt;ref name="GoschWebsite"/&gt; Mrs. Gosch alleged the man was one of the "perpetrators who molested [my] son".&lt;ref name="noproof22sept2006"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rood|first1=Lee|title=Ex-investigator: No proof photos aren't of Gosch|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21748876/|accessdate=July 10, 2018|work=The Des Moines Register|date=September 22, 2006|pages=1B, 5B|via=Newspapers.com}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosch later said the first two photos had originated on a website featuring child pornography.&lt;ref name=whotookjohnny /&gt;&lt;ref name="noproof22sept2006"/&gt;

On September 13, an anonymous letter was mailed to Des Moines police.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Gentlemen,''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Someone has played a reprehensible joke on a grieving mother. The photo in question is not one of her son but of three boys in Tampa, Florida about 1979–80, challenging each other to an escape contest. There was an investigation concerning that picture, made by the Hillsborough County (FL) Sheriff's Office. No charges were filed, and no wrongdoing was established. The lead detective on the case was named Zalva. This allegation should be easy enough to check out.''&lt;ref name="noproof22sept2006" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nelson Zalva, who worked for the [[Hillsborough County, Florida]] Sheriff's Office in the 1970s, said the details of the letter were true and adds that he also investigated the black-and-white in "1978 or 1979", before Gosch's disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcci.com/news/9849752/detail.html|title=Probe Over Boys' Photos Continues|date=April 10, 2012|work=KCCI|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312095923/http://www.kcci.com/news/9849752/detail.html|archivedate=March 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I interviewed the kids, and they said there was no coercion or touching. ...

Noreen Gosch still believes the pictures to be of her son.&lt;ref name="GoschWebsite"/&gt;

==National interest==
The case generated national interest as Noreen Gosch became increasingly vocal about the inadequacy of law enforcement's investigation of missing children cases. She established the Johnny Gosch Foundation in 1982, through which she visited schools and spoke at seminars about the ''[[modus operandi]]'' of sexual predators. She lobbied for "The Johnny Gosch Bill", state legislation which would mandate an immediate police response to reports of missing children.&lt;ref name="Grief1984"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Poole|first1=Marcia|title=Mother's grief doesn't subside|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14334852/the_sioux_city_journal/|accessdate=October 11, 2017|work=Sioux City Journal|date=August 26, 1984|page=B1|via=Newspapers.com}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill became law in Iowa in 1984, and similar or identical laws were later passed in [[Missouri]] and seven other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Vanessa|title=Mother of abducted Johnny Gosch: 'I know all too well what it's like'|url=http://thegazette.com/2012/07/18/mother-of-abducted-johnny-gosch-i-know-all-too-well-what-its-like/|accessdate=October 11, 2017|work=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Gazette]]|date=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1984, Noreen Gosch testified in Senate hearings on [[organized crime]], speaking about "organized [[pedophilia]]" and its alleged role in her son's abduction. She began receiving death threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iowacoldcases.org/case-summaries/johnny-gosch/|title=Johnny Gosch Iowa Cold Cases}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gosch also testified before the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]], which provided $10 million to establish the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]. Gosch was invited to the White House by President [[Ronald Reagan]] for the dedication ceremony.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== Bonacci allegations ===
{{Main|Franklin child prostitution ring allegations}}
In 1989, 21-year-old Paul A. Bonacci told his attorney [[John DeCamp]] that he had been abducted into a sex ring with Gosch as a teenager and was forced to participate in Gosch's kidnapping.

John Gosch met with Bonacci and believed he was telling the truth. Noreen later met him and said he told her things "he could know only from talking with her son."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burnham|first1=Jeff|title=2 Iowa boys gone but not forgotten|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/anonymous-crime-clipping-mar-20-1992-419150/|accessdate=October 11, 2017|work=The Gazette|via=[[NewspaperArchive.com]]|date=March 20, 1992|page=1A, 8A}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that Johnny had a [[birthmark]] on his chest, a scar on his tongue and a burn scar on his lower leg; although a description of the birthmark had been widely circulated, information about the scars had not been made public. Bonacci also described a stammer that Johnny had when he was upset.&lt;ref name=whotookjohnny/&gt; The FBI and local police do not believe that Bonacci is a credible witness in the case and have not interviewed him.&lt;ref name="dmregister.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=whotookjohnny/&gt;

Bonacci accused [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] activist and businessman [[Lawrence E. King]] Jr (b. 1944) who also served as director of the Franklin Credit Union in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], of running an underage prostitution ring and victimizing him since an early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Paul M.|last2=Archibald|first2=George|title=Homosexual prostitution inquiry ensnares VIPs with Reagan, Bush|work=The Washington Times|date=June 29, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robbins|first1=William|title=A Lurid, Mysterious Scandal Begins Taking Shape in Omaha|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/18/us/a-lurid-mysterious-scandal-begins-taking-shape-in-omaha.html|accessdate=August 30, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 18, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, a county grand jury declined to charge King, finding the allegations to be "a carefully crafted [[hoax]]". Paul Bonacci and Alisha Owen were indicted on state [[perjury]] charges. A federal grand jury also declined to indict anyone for child prostitution but did return indictments against Owen for perjury and King for fraud related to the credit union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robbins|first1=William|title=Omaha Grand Jury Sees Hoax in Lurid Tales|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/29/us/omaha-grand-jury-sees-hoax-in-lurid-tales.html|accessdate=August 30, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=July 29, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter was accused of looting $40 million from the bank and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The bank was shut down in November 1988 when it was raided by the FBI, the [[IRS]] and the [[NCUA]]. King was released from prison in April 2001.

On February 27, 1999, the U.S. District Court of the District of Nebraska awarded Bonacci $1 million in compensatory damages and punitive damages. Bonacci had sued King, who failed to respond to the civil lawsuit. Thus a default judgment was entered against King, who ceased his appeal attempt in early 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, Michael (2009).

'''Keith Campbell''' (born 1938) is an [[Australia]]n [[philosophy|philosopher]] working in [[metaphysics]]. 

==Biography==
With [[David Malet Armstrong|D. M. Armstrong]], Campbell is one of the founders of so-called ''Australian metaphysics'' (see [[Australian materialism]]) and, within it, of a variety of [[Trope_%28philosophy%29#Trope_theory_in_philosophy_.28metaphysics.29|trope theory]]. He also has a distinctive view of concrete and abstract objects: the former can exist by themselves, and the latter are incapable of independent existence. 

He refuses, following [[Frank Plumpton Ramsey|F. Ramsey]], the necessity of choice between [[Philosophical realism|Realism]] and [[Nominalism]] in the [[problem of universals]], because they both share "a false presupposition being that any quality or relation must be a universal" (Campbell 1991, preface).

The separation between the [[University of Sydney]]'s Departments of Traditional and Modern Philosophy and of General Philosophy is attributed to his organising the proposal in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/sydq.html The Sydney Philosophy Disturbances]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a senior lecturer in the "Traditional and Modern" one&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.undpress.nd.edu/exec/dispatch.php?s=title,P00031 University of Notre Dame Press -- ''Body and Mind'']&lt;/ref&gt; but is now an emeritus professor in the recombined Department of Philosophy (part of the School of Philosophical and Historical Inquiry).

Campbell is known as a co-editor of ''[[Ontology, Causality, and Mind]]: Essays in Honour of [[David Malet Armstrong|D.M. Armstrong]]'', and as author of ''Body and Mind''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7029">'''Krausism''' is a [[doctrine]] named after the German philosopher [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]] (1781–1832) that advocates doctrinal [[toleration|tolerance]] and [[academic freedom]] from [[dogma]].  

This philosophy was widespread in [[Restoration (Spain)|Restoration Spain]], where it reached its maximum practical development thanks to the work of his promotor, [[Julián Sanz del Rio]], and the [[Institución Libre de Enseñanza|Free Institution of Education]] led by [[Francisco Giner de los Ríos]], and the contribution of a great jurist [[Federico Castro]]. 

One of the [[philosophers of identity]], Krause endeavoured to reconcile the ideas of a [[monotheistic]] singular [[God]] understood by [[faith]] with a [[pantheistic]] or [[empirical]] understanding of the world.

[[Divinity]], which is [[Intuition (Mind)|intuitively]] known by [[conscience]] is not a personality (which implies limitations), but an all-inclusive essence (''Wesen''), which contains the [[universe]] within itself. 

This system he called [[panentheism]], a combination of [[monotheism]] and [[pantheism]]. His theory of the world and of humanity is universal and idealistic.

==Spanish Krausism==
Spanish Krausism was a cultural movement that was rooted in the publication in the 19th century of Krause's personal version the dominant idealism, which was largely overshadowed in his native [[Germany]] by the prestige of its leading figures: [[Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and especially [[Hegel]]. 

Around 1840, a group of Spanish [[jurist]]s, notably Julián Sanz del Río were seeking a political doctrine within the [[liberalism|liberal]] tradition to initiate a regenerative process that they felt was necessary to modify and extend the philosophical concepts then in vogue. 

Coincidentally, [[Ruperto Navarro Zamorano]], a member of the Friends of Sanz del Rio, had in 1841 translated the '' Course Natural Law, or Philosophy of Law '', by [[Heinrich Ahrens]], which had previously been published in Paris in 1837.

Ahrens affirmed that the foundation of law is the "compliance": the set of external conditions upon which the fate of the rational [[Homo sapiens| man]] and [[human nature|humanity]] could be developed systematically as a universal order of piety, [[Roman Catholic devotions|devotion]] and [[altruism]]. 

Ahrens philosophy was developed and summarized by Kraus in the formula of "harmonious rationalism" or "[[panentheism]]" published in 1811 as  ''The Ideal of Humanity and Universal Federation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ideal of Humanity and Universal Federation
|author=Karl Christian Friedrich Krause|publisher=Bibliolife LLC/Forgotten Books (USA)|date=2012-08-01|ASIN= B008TCCEKU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ideal of Humanity and Universal Federation |url=https://www.archive.org/stream/idealhumanityan01kraugoog/idealhumanityan01kraugoog_djvu.txt|author=Karl Christian Friedrich Krause |publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark (Edinburgh)|date=1900|editor=W. Hastie D.D.|accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin American Krausism==
The common language made some Latin Americans who visited or were exiled to Spain come into contact with Krause's doctrines. The most outstanding case was that of a Puerto Rican [[Eugenio María de Hostos]], who studied philosophy with Sanz del Rio. 

De Hostos' novel ''The Inner Pilgrimage of Eugenio Mara de Hostos as Seen Through Bayón''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Inner Pilgrimage of Eugenio Mara de Hostos as Seen Through Bayón|author=Eugenio Maria de Hostas|publisher=Centro Pro Hostos de Nueva York|date=2006-11-01|editor=de Hildreth N Waltzer}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a romantic novel in the form of a diary outlining his dream of a unified social philosophy. Hostos supports the liberation of women not as a human right, rather as a practical mechanism for greater good for the community and for the social organization. 

The Cuban writer and national hero [[José Martí]],  suffered a brutal political imprisonment with forced labor, but, despite his youth, he escaped prison for exile in Spain.  There he write letters against transatlantic military brutality of the colonial regime. He also studied law and thus encountered the philosophy and doctrines of Krause.

These two proponents,  Martí and de Hostos, although with a very different personal discourses, greatly influenced the evolution of Krausism in which the individual takes personal responsibility to act for the betterment of society. These discourses led to the so-called "Anti-Imperialist-Nationalism". This t term was first developed by Dr. [[Rafael Cuevas]], and referred to the analysis of the rebellion of Augusto C. Sandino, then fighting against the [[United States occupation of Nicaragua]]. 

Hostos and Martí became heroes and allies in their anti-colonial struggle for independence for both [[Spanish–American War|Cuba]] and [[Spanish–American War|Puerto Rico]] from Spain. Both men were initiated into [[Freemasonry]], thus confirming the influence of Freemasonry in the promotion of Krausism and vice versa. These links promoted a kind of social network to support the migration of Krausists liberal educators who reached out to Latin Americas'  liberal leaders who were seeking autonomy from colonial Spain.

Later Krausism figures included [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]], [[José Batlle y Ordóñez]], [[Alfonso Reyes]], [[Jose Enrique Rodo]], [[Alejandro Deustua]], [[Arturo Umberto Illia]] and [[Alejandro Korn]]. Reyes, for example, gave lectures at the [[Residencia de Estudiantes]] in Madrid, whilst Rodo promoted esthetic concern through Krausism in his extensive correspondence with [[Leopoldo Alas]].

The '''law school of Beirut''' (also known as the '''law school of Berytus''' and the '''school of Roman law at Berytus''') was a center for the study of [[Roman law]] in [[classical antiquity]] located in [[Beirut]] ({{Lang-la|Berytus}}). It flourished under the patronage of the [[Roman emperor]]s and functioned as the [[Roman Empire]]'s preeminent center of [[jurisprudence]] until its destruction in AD 551.

The law schools of the Roman Empire established organized repositories of imperial [[Constitution (Roman law)|constitutions]] and institutionalized the study and practice of jurisprudence to relieve the busy imperial courts. The archiving of imperial constitutions facilitated the task of [[jurist]]s in referring to legal [[precedent]]s. The origins of the law school of Beirut are obscure, but probably it was under [[Augustus]] in the first century. The earliest written mention of the school dates to 239 AD, when its reputation had already been established. The school attracted young, affluent Roman citizens, and its professors made major contributions to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Codex of Justinian]]. The school achieved such wide recognition throughout the Empire that Beirut was known as the "Mother of Laws". Beirut was one of the few schools allowed to continue teaching jurisprudence when [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]] shut down other provincial law schools.

The course of study at Beirut lasted for five years and consisted in the revision and analysis of classical legal texts and imperial constitutions, in addition to case discussions. Justinian took a personal interest in the teaching process, charging the bishop of Beirut, the governor of [[Phoenicia|Phoenicia Maritima]] and the teachers with discipline maintenance in the school.

The school's facilities were destroyed in the aftermath of a [[551 Beirut earthquake|massive earthquake]] that hit the Phoenician coastline. It was moved to [[Sidon]] but did not survive the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] of 635 AD. Ancient texts attest that the school was next to the ancient Anastasis church, vestiges of which lie beneath the [[Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral]] in [[Beirut Central District|Beirut's historic center]].

==Background==
As the guarantor of justice, the [[Roman emperor]] was expected to devote substantial amounts of time to judicial matters. He was the [[Executive magistrates of the Roman Empire|chief magistrate]] whose major prerogative (''[[Ius|jus]]'') was the ordering of all public affairs, for which he could demand assistance from anyone at any time.&lt;ref name="Walker 2000 91"&gt;Walker 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

With legal appeals, petitions from subjects and judicial queries of magistrates and [[Roman governor|governors]], the emperors were careful to consult with the [[jurist]]s (''iuris consulti''), who were usually secretaries drafted from the [[Roman equestrian order|equestrian order]]. From the reign of [[Augustus]] (27&amp;nbsp;BC–AD&amp;nbsp;14), jurists began compiling organized repositories of imperial [[edict]]s (''constitutiones''), and legal scholarship became an imperially sponsored function of administration. Every new judicial decision was founded on archived legal precedents and earlier deliberations. The edict repositories and the imperially sponsored legal scholarship gave rise to the earliest law school system of the [[Western world]], aimed specifically at training professional jurists.&lt;ref name="Walker 2000 91"/&gt;

==History==
During the reign of Augustus, [[Beirut]] was established under the name ''Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Named after Augustus' daughter [[Julia the Elder]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charnock 1859, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; (and granted the status of ''[[Ius Italicum]]'') as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] for [[Battle of Actium]] veterans from the [[Legio V Macedonica|fifth Macedonian]] and the [[Legio III Gallica|third Gallic]] legions. It was chosen as a regional center instead of the more prominent Phoenician cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]], which had a history of belligerence against Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Jones Hall 2004, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arc"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://archive.archaeology.org/1107/features/beirut_lebanon_urban_archaeology.html | title=Rebuilding Beirut |author=Lawler, Andrew | journal=Archaeology |date=July–August 2011 | volume=64 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St. George's Cathedral, Beirut.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large church at the edge of an archaeological field.|St. George's Cathedral sits on the axis of Beirut's ancient [[Cardo|Cardo Maximus]]. The law school used to be located next to the Byzantine Anastasis church, a precursor of the cathedral.]]
Beirut was first mentioned in writing as a major center for the study of law in the 239 works of [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]], the bishop of [[Niksar|Neo-Caesarea]].&lt;ref&gt;Sartre 2005, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thaumaturgus 239, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; Other early written sources do not mention when the law school was established, and the date is much debated among modern historians and scholars. [[Edward Gibbon]] suggested its founding may have been directed by locally born Emperor [[Alexander Severus]], who reigned during AD 222–235;&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon 1854, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; this hypothesis had been supported by [[Gilles Ménage]], a late 17th-century French scholar. Italian jurist [[Scipione Gentili]], however, attributed the school's foundation to Augustus, while 19th-century German theologian [[Karl Hase]] advocated its establishment shortly after the victory at Actium (31&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 16–20&lt;/ref&gt; Adolf Friedrich Rudorff dated it to the reign of [[Hadrian]],&lt;ref&gt;Rudorff  1857, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; while Franz Peter Bremer suggested that it opened around 200, based on Thaumaturgus.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer 1868, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor Mommsen]] linked the establishment of the law school in Beirut with the need for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a repository for Roman imperial edicts concerning the eastern provinces. After arriving in Beirut, these were translated into [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[publishing|published]] and archived. This function was first recorded in 196 AD, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the [[Codex Gregorianus|Gregorian Codex]], but the city is thought to have served as a repository since earlier times.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen 1901, pp. 139–144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The proximity of the repository to the law school allowed the Beiruti jurists to consult archived documents and for students to learn of the most recent imperial decrees—an advantage that the law schools of [[Caesarea Maritima]] and [[Alexandria]] lacked.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd-century emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]] issued constitutions exempting the students of the law school of Beirut from compulsory service in their hometowns.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jidejian 1973, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century, the Greek [[rhetoric]]ian [[Libanius]] reported that the school attracted young students from affluent families and deplored the school's instructional use of [[Latin]], which was gradually abandoned in favor of Greek in the course of the century.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark 2011, p. 36"&gt;Clark 2011, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rochette 1997 pp. 168, 174"&gt;Rochette 1997 pp. 168, 174&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 5th century, Beirut had established its leading position and repute among the Empire's law schools; its teachers were highly regarded and played a chief role in the development of legal learning in the East to the point that they were dubbed “ecumenical masters”.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, p. 453&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy 2012, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; From 425, the law school of [[Constantinople]] became a rival center of law study and was the only school, along with Beirut's, to be maintained after [[Justinian I]] closed those of Alexandria, Caesarea Maritima and [[Athens]] in 529&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"/&gt; because their teachings contradicted with Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;Riddle 2008, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 551, the Phoenician coastal cities were devastated by a high-magnitude earthquake. In Beirut the earthquake was followed by a [[tsunami]] and a fire that obliterated the city. In the aftermath, 30,000 people lost their lives, including many students from abroad. Justinian allocated funds to rebuild Beirut, and the law school was temporarily moved to the southern Phoenician city of [[Sidon]], pending reconstruction; the best teachers, however, moved to Constantinople. Misfortune hit Beirut again in 560 AD when a massive fire ravaged the recovering city. The law school was not reopened, and all prospect for its return was abandoned with the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] in 635 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 54–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sartre 2005, p. 291"&gt;Sartre 2005, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academia==
The study course at the law school of Beirut was restricted to [[Roman law]]; it did not cover the local laws of the province of Phoenicia.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient texts provide an idea of the curriculum, the teaching method, the course languages and its duration.

===Preparatory studies===
Potential students were expected to have undergone grammar, rhetoric and encyclopedic sciences studies. Another prerequisite was the mastery of Greek and Latin, given that the classical legal references and imperial constitutions used in the teaching program were written in Latin. The aspirants could pursue their preparatory studies in public schools or have private tutors.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 81–83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curriculum===

Little is known about the Beirut law school's curriculum before the 5th century. The ''[[Scholia Sinaitica]]'' and the ''[[Scholia]]'' to the ''[[Basilika|Basilica]]'' provide glimpses of the school's [[teaching method]], comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time. The lecturer would discuss and analyze legal texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as [[Ulpian]]. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, p. 454&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisprudence was taught in Latin, even in the law schools of the East, but toward the end of the fourth and the beginning of the 5th century, Latin was supplanted by Greek at Beirut,&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt; which was the long-established [[lingua franca]] of the eastern territories of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks 2009, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; A similar shift probably occurred at the school of Constantinople at about the same time.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt;

The ''Omnem'' constitution at the beginning of the [[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]] is the only source of information about the existing study system in the 5th century until the Justinian reforms of 533. The old program was a four-year course to be completed before the age of 25. The courses were based on the works of [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]], Ulpian, [[Aemilius Papinianus|Papinian]] and [[Julius Paulus Prudentissimus|Paulus]]. Students attended lectures for three years and spent the fourth year in private study of Paulus' ''[[Responsa]]''; they had the option to stay for a fifth year to study imperial constitutions. The students of each year were distinguished by special nicknames: first year, ''Dupondii''; second, ''Edictales''; third, ''Papinianistae''; fourth, ''Lytae''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 224–240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard 1999, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Justinian's ''Omnem'' constitution fixed the duration of the legal course in the schools of Beirut and Constantinople at five years.&lt;ref name="Corcoran"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/history2/volterra/julianintro.htm | title=Law-school texts after 533 | publisher=University College London | work=The Epitome of Julian | date=July 20, 2009 | accessdate=March 23, 2013 | author=Corcoran, Simon | authorlink=Simon Corcoran | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106095259/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/history2/volterra/julianintro.htm | archivedate=November 6, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="digest"&gt;Monro 1872, pp. xviii–xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; The courses consisted of lectures and self-study using materials advanced in his ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'', namely the ''[[Institutes of Justinian|Institutiones]]'' (Institutes), ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digesta]]'' (Digest) and ''[[Codex Justinianus|Codex]]'' (Code).&lt;ref name="Corcoran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt; First-year students were lectured on the Institutes and on the first part of the Digest;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 1–4 of the Digest are called the ''Prota''.&lt;/ref&gt; second-year students were taught the greater part of the Digest,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The ''de iudiciis'' (books 5–11), the ''de rebus'' (books 12–19) and  the ''libri singularis'' (books 23, 26, 28 and 30).&lt;/ref&gt; and third-year students had to learn various texts from Papinian and the ''leges singulares''.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; There were no lectures during the course's fourth year but the pupils studied the remainder of the Digest.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 24, 25, 27, 29 and 31–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknames were still given according to the year of study, but Justinian changed the name of first-year students from the frivolous ''Dupondii'' (which means "two pennies") to ''Iustiniani novi'' and dubbed fifth-year students ''Prolytae''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buckland 1921, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
At the end of the course, graduands were given certificates allowing them to work as court advocates or in the imperial civil service.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"/&gt;

===Professorial body===
Ancient texts reveal the names and deeds of some of the most notable law professors at the Beirut school. The scarce sources include historical accounts, works of legal scholarship, anthologies, ancient correspondences and funerary inscriptions.

[[Antioch]]-based rhetoric teacher Libanius wrote many letters of correspondence to Domninus the Elder, a 4th-century law school professor. In 360, Libanius invited Domninus to leave Beirut and teach with him at the rhetoric school of Antioch. Domninus apparently declined the offer, since later correspondence to him from Libanius, between 361 and 364, served as recommendations for law school candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

The most brilliant era of Beirut's law school, spanning the century between 400 and 500, was known as the era of the "Ecumenical Masters" (Greek: τῆς οἰκουμένης διδάσκαλοι). During this period, a succession of seven highly esteemed law masters was largely responsible for the revival of legal education in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925 131"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; The seven revered masters, cited with praise by 6th-century scholars, were [[Cyrillus]], [[Patricius (jurist)|Patricius]], [[Domninus (jurist)|Domninus]], [[Demosthenes (jurist)|Demosthenes]], [[Eudoxius (jurist)|Eudoxius]], [[Leontius (jurist)|Leontius]] and [[Amblichus]].&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925 131"/&gt;

Cyrillus was the founder of the ecumenical school of jurists.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"/&gt; He is believed to have taught as of {{circa|lk=no|400}} or {{circa|lk=no|410}}. Styled "the great" due to his reputation as a teacher, he was known for his direct use of ancient sources of law and for interpreting jurists such as Ulpian and Papinian. Cyrillus wrote a precise treatise on definitions that supplied the materials for many important ''scholia'' appended to the first and second titles of the eleventh book of the ''Basilica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Cyrillus |volume=7 |page=706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;
Patricius was praised in the third preface of the Justinian Digest (''Tanta-Dedoken'') as a distinguished professor of the Beirut law school. Archaeological excavations done in Beirut at the turn of the 20th century revealed a funerary monument believed to have belonged to Patricius.&lt;ref&gt;Jalabert 1906, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 132–138&lt;/ref&gt; The son of Eudoxius, Leontius was described by ecclesiastical historian [[Zacharias Rhetor]], who was his first-year student in 487 or 488, to have a great reputation in the legal field. He was raised to the office of [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Praetorian prefect of the East]] under Emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius I]] between 503 and 504, and became [[Magister militum]] in 528. Leontius was also involved as a commissioner in the preparation of the first codex of Justinian.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 141–154&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary, Amblichus, wrote a commentary on Ulpian's ''Libri ad Edictum''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical sources also tell of Euxenius, a teacher at the Beirut law school who taught during the times of the "Ecumenical Masters". Euxenius was the brother of the city's bishop Eustathius and was involved in the 460 religious controversy caused by [[Pope Timothy II of Alexandria|Timothy Aelurus]], which opposed the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysites]] to the followers of the [[Council of Chalcedon]].&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Dorotheus (jurist)|Dorotheus]], Anatolius (son of Leontius) and Julianus were school professors contemporary to Justinian I. The first two were summoned to the imperial court and commissioned to draft the ''Digesta''. Under the supervision of [[Tribonian]], Dorotheus also collaborated with Theophilus, a Constantinopolitan law teacher, in drafting the ''Institutiones''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 186–189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="digest2"&gt;Monro 1872, p. xxix&lt;/ref&gt; Julianus, the last known professor of Beirut's law school, was extolled by Theaetetus as "the light of the law".&lt;ref&gt;Pringsheim 1921, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; After the earthquake, Julianus left Beirut and settled in Constantinople, where he authored the ''[[Novellae Constitutiones|Epitome Iuliani]]'' in 555.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Justinian, there were eight teachers in the law schools of the [[Byzantine Empire]], presumably four in each of Beirut and Constantinople's schools.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Justinian mandated the supervision and enforcement of discipline in the school of Beirut to the teachers, the city's bishop and the [[Praeses|governor]] of Phoenicia Maritima.&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable students===
While most of the law school's students are not remembered by history, ancient historians and sources recount the stories of some of those who were deemed notable and achieved fame.

According to [[Eusebius|Eusebius of Caesarea]], [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]] was born into a rich family in Beirut in the latter half of the 3rd century and attended its law school. Pamphilus later became the [[presbyter]] of Caesarea Maritima and the founder of its extensive Christian library. He is celebrated as a martyr by both the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Eusebius also tells of martyred brothers [[Aphian]] and [[Aedesius of Alexandria|Aedesius]], born to a noble [[Lycia]]n family. They converted to Christianity while studying law in Beirut and were persecuted and executed for their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 27–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth-century historian [[Eunapius]] wrote of [[Anatolius]], a high-ranking Roman official known to his enemies as ''Azutrio''. Anatolius occupied the offices of consul of Syria, [[vicarius]] of the [[Diocese of Asia]], [[proconsul]] of Constantinople, [[List of urban prefects of Constantinople|urban prefect of Constantinople]] in 354, and [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Praetorian prefect of Illyricum]] until his death in 360. In his account of Anatolius, Eunapius summarized: "He reached the summit of the science of law. Nothing about this is surprising because Beirut, his homeland, is the mother and nurse of these studies".&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32"&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eunapius 1596, pp. 148–151&lt;/ref&gt;
Libanius' correspondence with Gaianus of Tyre discusses the latter's achievements after his graduation from the law school of Beirut; Gaianus became the [[List of Roman governors of Syria#Consularis Governors of Syria Phoenicia (c. 295 to c. 395)|consular governor of Phoenicia]] in 362.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gaza City|Gazan]] lawyer and church historian [[Sozomen]], also a law student at Beirut, wrote in his ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' about [[Triphyllius]], a convert to Christendom who became the bishop of Nicosia. Triphyllius received legal training in Beirut and was criticized by his teacher [[Saint Spyridon]] for his [[atticism]] and for using legal vocabulary instead of that of the Bible.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32"/&gt;

Zacharias Rhetor studied law at Beirut between 487 and 492, then worked as a lawyer in Constantinople until his imperial contacts won him the appointment as bishop of [[Mytilene]]. Among Rhetor's works is the biography of [[Severus of Antioch|Severus]], the last miaphysite patriarch of Antioch and one of the founders of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], who had also been a law student in Beirut as of 486.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 46–51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greatrex 2011, pp. 6–7"&gt;Greatrex 2011, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; Another late 5th-century student was [[John Rufus]], an anti-[[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]] priest who moved to [[Maiuma]] after the expulsion of his master, [[Peter the Fuller]]. In Maiuma, John Rufus authored the ''Plerophoriae'' and the ''Life of [[Peter the Iberian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sterk 2009, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 51"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Historically, Roman ''stationes'' or ''auditoria'', where teaching was done, stood next to public libraries housed in temples. This arrangement was copied in the Roman colony at Beirut. The first mention of the school's premises dates to 350,&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; but the description does not specify its location. In the 5th century, Zacharias Rhetor reported that the school stood next to the "Temple of God", the description of which permitted its identification with the Byzantine Anastasis cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 63–73&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century, archaeological excavations in the [[souq]] between the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral and [[Saint George Maronite Cathedral, Beirut|Saint George Cathedral of the Maronites]] unearthed a funerary [[stele]] etched with an epitaph to a man named Patricius, "whose career was consecrated for the study of law".&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The epitaph was identified as being dedicated to the famous 5th-century law school professor.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 61–73&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, archaeological diggings underneath the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral in [[Beirut Central District]]'s Nejmeh Square identified structural elements of the Anastasis cathedral, but they were restricted to an area of {{convert|316|m2|sqft}} and failed to unearth the interred school.&lt;ref name="Sartre 2005, p. 291"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skaf 2005, pp. 224–229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones Hall 2004, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation and legacy==

The law school of Beirut supplied the Roman Empire, especially its eastern provinces, with lawyers and magistrates for three centuries until the school's destruction. The influx of students was abundant and persistent because of the affluence, honor and secured employment offered by the profession.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson 2004, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; A degree in law became highly sought following an edict issued in 460 by Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo I]]. The edict ordered that candidates for the bar of the Eastern [[praetorian prefect]]ure had to produce certificates of proficiency from the law teachers who instructed them at one of the recognized law schools of the Empire.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jolowicz 1972, pp. 454–455&lt;/ref&gt;

The in-depth studies of the classical legal works in Beirut, and later in Constantinople, conferred an unprecedented scientific dimension to jurisprudence; this academic movement gave rise to the minds behind Justinian's legal reforms. As a result of the new understanding of the classical legal texts, the imperial laws of the late 5th and early 6th centuries were clearer and more coherent than those of the early [[Postclassical Era]], according to legal historian George Mousourakis and other scholars.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, pp. 451–460"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, pp. 451–460&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kunkel"&gt;Kunkel 1973, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuz"&gt;Schulz 1967, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

The school garnered accolades throughout its existence and was bestowed with the title ''Berytus Nutrix Legum'' (Beirut, Mother of Laws) by Eunapius, Libanius, Zacharias Rhetor and finally by Emperor Justinian.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 51"/&gt; His 533 ''Omnem'' constitution read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;These three works which we have composed we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities as well as in the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we have heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the 3rd century, the school tolerated Christian teachings, producing a number of students who would become influential church leaders and bishops, such as [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]], [[Severus of Antioch]] and [[Aphian]]. Under [[Cyrillus]], the first of the Ecumenical Masters, the Christian faith was consolidated as an integral element of the legal training.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Attridge  1992, p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;

Two professors from the law school of Beirut, Dorotheus and Anatolius, had such a repute for their wisdom and knowledge that they were especially praised by Justinian in the opening of his ''Tanta'' constitution. The emperor summoned both professors to assist his minister Tribonian in compiling the Codex of Justinian,&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt; the Empire's body of civil laws issued between 529 and 534. The ''Tanta'' passage reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dorotheus, an illustrious man, of great eloquence and quæstorian rank, whom, when he was engaged in delivering the law to students in the most brilliant city of Berytus,we, moved by his great reputation and renown, summoned to our presence and made to share in the work in question; again, Anatolius, an illustrious person, a magistrate, who, like the last, was invited to this work when acting as an exponent of law at Berytus, a man who came of an ancient stock, as both his father Leontius and his grandfather Eudoxius left behind them an excellent report in respect of legal learning...&lt;ref name="digest2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For centuries following its compilation, the work of Justinian's commission was studied and incorporated into the legal systems of different nations and has profoundly impacted the [[Byzantine law]] and the [[Western law|Western legal tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman 1995, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Stein asserts that the texts of ancient Roman law have constituted "a kind of legal supermarket, in which lawyers of different periods have found what they needed at the time."&lt;ref&gt;Stein 1999, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Digesto 02.jpg|thumb|alt=Title page of an old book with ornate decorative motifs depicting a mermaid, a merman and various other creatures surrounding the Title text |Title page of a late 16th-century edition of the ''Digesta'', part of Emperor [[Justinian I]]'s ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'']]
The ''Corpus Juris Civilis'' remained the basis of Byzantine law until the publication of the ''[[Byzantine law#Ecloga|Ecloga legum]]'' in 741 by Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] and his son and co-regent [[Constantine V]]. The ''Ecloga'' was a shortened and more philanthropic version of the Codex of Justinian, whose dispositions were more in tune with [[Christian values]]. It was written in Greek, since Latin had fallen into disuse, and its provisions continued to be applied in later centuries in the neighboring Balkan and Asia Minor regions, with surviving translations in [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, pp. 403–404"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, pp. 403–404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 35"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reinink 2002, pp. 191–192"&gt;Reinink 2002, pp. 191–192&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Basil I]], who ruled in the 9th century, issued the ''Prochiron'' and the ''Epanagoge'', which were legal compilations invalidating parts of the ''Ecloga'' and restoring the Justinian laws.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 405"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lokin 1994, pp. 71–91"&gt;Lokin 1994, pp. 71–91&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Prochiron'' served as the basis for the legal writings of the 12th-century first archbishop of Serbia, [[Saint Sava]]. His legal compilation was intended for the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian church]] but the influential work was adopted as the basic constitution for the Bulgarian and Russian orthodox churches.&lt;ref name="Sedlar 2011, pp. 306–307"&gt;Sedlar 2011, pp. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; Around 900, Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] commissioned the ''Basilica'', a Greek rewriting of the Justinian laws that is considered the ancestor of modern Greece's law until the enactment of the Code of 1940.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, pp. 35–36"&gt;Stein 1999, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

The Codex of Justinian also had a great influence on Western law, particularly on the legal history and tradition of western Europe and its American colonies. In Italy, a single complete copy of the Justinian Digest survived and lay forgotten until its rediscovery in 1070.&lt;ref name="Kuttner 1991, pp. 299–300"&gt;Kuttner 1991, pp. 299–300&lt;/ref&gt; In 1088, [[Irnerius]], a jurist and teacher of the liberal arts in [[Bologna]], was the first to teach the newly recovered Digest and the rest of Justinian's books. He and his successors explained the Roman laws to their students by means of glosses or explanatory notes written on the edges or between the text lines. The Roman legal concepts resulting from the studies of these "[[glossator]]s" spread to the universities and law courts of Europe.&lt;ref name="Evans 2005, p. 25"&gt;Evans 2005, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  The Roman law revival that started in Italy, during the Middle Ages, was taken up by France, the Netherlands and Germany in later centuries.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 2"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The enactment of the German Civil Code in 1900 put an end to the application of extant forms of law derived from the Justinian codes in most European states.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 128"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

The reputation of Beirut as "mother of laws" reemerged in modern times.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt; In 1913, [[Paul Huvelin]], the first dean of the newly established [[Saint Joseph University|Université Saint-Joseph]]'s Faculty of Law, dedicated the inaugural speech to the classical law school of Beirut in an effort to confer legitimacy to the new academy.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 199"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet ''Berytus Nutrix Legum'' is used as a motto and as part of the emblem of the Beirut Bar Association, founded in 1919.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt; It is also featured in the seal and flag of the Municipality of Beirut.&lt;ref name="log"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://beirut.gov.lb/ | title = Beirut Official Website | publisher = Municipality of Beirut | accessdate = June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] considered intuition a means for perceiving ideas, significant enough that for Aristotle, intuition comprised the only means of knowing principles that are [[a priori and a posteriori|not subject to argument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Piętka| first=Dariusz| title=The Concept of Intuition and Its Role in Plato and Aristotle| publisher=Organon| year=2015| url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299275042_The_Concept_of_Intuition_and_Its_Role_in_Plato_and_Aristotle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henri Poincaré]] distinguished logical intuition from [[intuition|other forms of intuition]].  In his book [[The Value of Science]] he points out:

{{quote|...[T]here are many kinds of intuition. I have said how much the intuition of pure number, whence comes rigorous mathematical induction, differs from sensible intuition to which the imagination, properly so called, is the principal contributor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Poincaré| first=Henri| title=Intuition and Logic in Mathematics, from the book ''The Value of Science''| year=1905| url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Poincare_Intuition.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The passage goes on to assign two roles to logical intuition: to permit one to choose which [[axiom|route]] to follow in search of scientific [[truth]], and to allow one to comprehend [[logic]]al developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Poincaré| first=Henri| title=The Value of Science| year=1905| url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Poincare_Intuition.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]], though critical of intuitive [[mysticism#Intuitive insight and enlightenment|mysticism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Popova| first=Maria| title=A Largeness of Contemplation: Bertrand Russell on Intuition, the Intellect, and the Nature of Time| year=2016| publisher=BrainPickings.org| url=https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/13/bertrand-russell-mysticism-logic-time/}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the degree to which a truth is [[self-evidence|self-evident]] according to logical intuition can vary, from one situation to another, and stated that some self-evident truths are practically [[infallibility#In philosophy|infallible]]:

{{quote|When a certain number of logical principles have been admitted, the rest can be deduced from them; but the propositions deduced are often just as self-evident as those that were assumed without proof.  All arithmetic, moreover, can be deduced from the general principles of logic, yet the simple propositions of arithmetic, such as 'two and two are four', are just as self-evident as the principles of logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Russell| first=Bertrand| title=Problems of Philosophy| year=1912| url=http://www.ditext.com/russell/rus11.html}} Chapter XI "On Intuitive Knowledge"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Kurt Gödel]] demonstrated based on his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]] that intuition-based [[propositional calculus]] cannot be [[many-valued logic|finitely valued]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Kennedy| first=Juliette| title=Kurt Gödel| year=2015| publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/#GodRat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel likened logical intuition to sense perception and considered the mathematical constructs that humans perceive to have an independent [[philosophical realism|existence]] of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Ravitch| first=Harold| title=On Gödel's Philosophy of Mathematics| year=1998| url=http://www.friesian.com/goedel/chap-2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human mind's ability to sense such abstract constructs may not be [[finite set|finitely]] describable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Solomon| first=Martin| title=On Kurt Gödel's Philosophy of Mathematics| year=1998| url=http://calculemus.org/lect/07logika/godel-solomon.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discussion ==

Dissent regarding the value of intuition in a logical or mathematical context may often hinge on the breadth of the definition of intuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=XiXiDu| title=Intuition and Mathematics| year=2011| url=https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5twHzuzCxgFWHZRsg/intuition-and-mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissent regarding the implications of logical intuition in the fields of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive computing]] may similarly hinge on definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Szangolies| first=Jochen| title=Does Strong AI conflict with Gödel's incompleteness theorem?| year=2015| url=https://www.quora.com/Does-Strong-AI-conflict-with-G%C3%B6dels-incompleteness-theorem}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, similarity between the potentially infinite nature of logical intuition posited by Gödel and the [[hard problem of consciousness]] posited by [[David Chalmers]] suggest that the realms of intuitive knowledge and experiential consciousness may both have aspects that are not reducible to classical physics concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Aas| first=Benjamin| title=Body-Gödel-Mind: The unsolvability of the hard problem of consciousness| year=2011| url=http://necsi.edu/events/iccs2011/papers/199.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="605">'''Logical pluralism''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] view that there is more than one correct [[logic]].  It stands in contrast to logical monism which argues that there is a single unique logic. There are different standard both for what counts as a logic and what exactly it means for a logic to be "correct".  As a result, the debate about logical monism  and pluralism is fractured into many different positions.

'''Mirtola''', also known as ‘Uttar Vrindavan’ is a village 10&amp;nbsp;km. away from [[Almora]], in [[Uttarakhand]] state in India, most known for an [[ashram]] by the same name, set up by Sri Yashoda Ma,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/lr/2003/05/04/stories/2003050400200200.htm The Hindu, 4 May 2003] ''[[The Hindu]]'', 4 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; a housewife turned ascetic in the 1930,&lt;ref&gt;Guru by Your Bedside, ''S.

The ashram was later run by his disciple, Sri [[Madhava Ashish]] (1920–1997),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurdjieff-internet.com/book_details.php?authID=2&amp;BID=5&amp;lang=English Madhav Ashish Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; another Englishman, who also later settled in India.

'Uttar Vrindavan' or Mirtola, is en route to [[Pithoragarh]] from Almora, 3&amp;nbsp;km to the left of the main road after Panuanaula, 25&amp;nbsp;km. after [[Almora]]. The place is also known for a Radha-Krishna temple built in 1931 &lt;ref&gt;Letters from Mirtola, Sri Krishna Prem and Sri Madhav Ashish, pp.89&lt;/ref&gt; by 'Sri Yashoda Ma', the founder and the spiritual head of the Ashram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sumanroyalresort.com/excursion.html Excursions from Almora] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119081012/http://www.sumanroyalresort.com/excursion.html |date=2007-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origin===
Yashoda Ma (née Monika Devi) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaudiya.com/pdf/Women_Saints_in_Gaudiya_Vaishnavism.pdf Women Saints in Gaudiya Vaishnavism]&lt;/ref&gt; was the wife of Dr. Gyanendra Nath Chakravarti, the first vice-chancellor of [[Lucknow University]], who was a well-known theosophist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theosophical.ca/InfluenceTheosophy%20.htm Theosophical Publishing House, Adyar, Chennai India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218134804/http://www.theosophical.ca/InfluenceTheosophy%20.htm |date=2007-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Krishna Prem|Ronald Henry Nixon]], a young English fighter pilot in the World War I, who later took a degree from [[Cambridge University]], came to India in 1921, after he took up a job as a lecturer at the Department of English at the newly opened Lucknow University, it was here that became close to the Chakravartis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/20000713/ied13030.html Coming to the path - S.D.

Later, in 1928, Monika Devi took the vows of [[sannyasa]] (renunciation), under the name 'Sri Yashoda Ma',&lt;ref&gt;Letters from Mirtola, Sri Krishna Prem and Sri Madhav Ashish, pp.88&lt;/ref&gt; and a shortly afterwards, Ronald Nixon under the name, 'Sri Krishna Prem'; he was later known as Gopal Da, at the Ashram, which they together established in 1930. Amongst its early inhabitants were Moti Rani (Yashoda Ma's youngest daughter) and Major Robert Dudley Alexander, who retired from his post of Principal, Lucknow Medical College prematurely, to be with Shri Krishna Prem. In October 1943, noted Indian saint [[Sri Anandamayi Ma]], visited the Mirtola Ashram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anandamayi.org/ashram/cc.htm Anandamayi ma life history] ''[[Sri Anandamoyi Ma]]'' Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sri Krishna Prem went on to take over the running of the Ashram, after Yashoda Ma’s death in 1944, Gopal Da himself passed over on 14 November 1965; before that he wrote books like, ''The Yoga of the Bhagavad Gita'' and ''The Yoga of the Katho-panishad'', amongst others and handed over the working of the Ashram to Sri Madhav Ashish in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetseers.org/spiritual_and_devotional_poets/ind/srikris Poet seers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030040801/http://www.poetseers.org/spiritual_and_devotional_poets/ind/srikris |date=2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has the distinction of being the first westerner, to be included in the [[Vaishnav]] form of [[Hinduism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiadivine.org/audarya/vedic-culture/183745-world-vedic-first-western-vaishnava.html The First Western Vaishnava]&lt;/ref&gt; he also was fluent in Hindi and Bengali.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1995/?pg=jul_aug May 1938 visit by a Ramana Maharshi's disciple; THE MAHARSHI magazine, August 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;
===1960s onwards===
Sri Krishna Prem (Gopal Da), was followed as a guru, by his disciple, 'Sri Madhav Ashish' (Ashish Da), previously 'Alexander Phipps', was an English aircraft engineer assembling Merlin engines, who came to India during the Second World War in 1942, and met Sri Krishna Prem at Mirtola in 1946, and soon became his disciple. In the following years, they together wrote many books including their two-part work on the Stanzas of Dzyan, contained in the [[Book of Dzyan]], 'Man, the measure of all things: In the stanzas of Dzyan', and 'Man, Son of Man'. Mirtola Ashram became a pilgrimage for Indian theosophists and started working extensively with the local communities pioneering hill farming techniques which he encouraged them to adopt,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthscape.org/p1/ES2_6881/6881.pdf International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development Report]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; a work for which Sri [[Madhava Ashish]] was awarded the [[Padma Shri]] in 1992 by the Indian government,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iicdelhi.nic.in/program/program_detail.asp?ProgId=1870&amp;CatgId=1 India International Centre, New Delhi]&lt;/ref&gt; he later died on 13 April 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19970506/ai_n14109106 Obituary: Sri Madhav Ashish] ''[[The Independent]]'', 6 May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rainwater harvesting at Mirtola Ashram DSCN7979 1.jpg|thumb|Rainwater harvesting at Mirtola Ashram, 2017]]
Over the years, the Ashram evolved a unique philosophy based on Eastern mystical thought from the [[Bhakti]] traditions, ideas of [[Nisargadatta Maharaj|Shri Nisargadatta]] and western philosophies like that of [[G. I. Gurdjieff]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] of [[Madame Blavatsky]], and Jungian dream work, among others. Thus a large number of Gurdjieffians visited the ashram, including [[Olga de Hartmann]], Phillipe Lavastine, Lizelle Reymond, Laurence Rosenthal, James George, and Bernard Courtenay-Mayers; even [[Jeanne de Salzmann]] met Ashish Da in Delhi 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurdjieff-internet.com/article_details.php?ID=24&amp;W=9 Interview of Seymour B.

[[File:もったいない (5305643094).jpg|thumb|''Mottainai'' written on a truck, followed by the sentence "I strive towards [[zero emission]]"]]

'''''Mottainai''''' is a term of Japanese origin that has been used by environmentalists.  The term in Japanese conveys a sense of regret over waste; the exclamation "''Mottainai!'' can translate as "What a waste!"  Japanese environmentalists have used the term to encourage people to "[[Waste hierarchy|reduce, reuse and recycle]]", and [[Kenya]]n environmentalist [[Wangari Maathai]] used the term at the [[United Nations]] as a slogan to promote environmental protection.

== Usage and translation ==

''Mottainai'' is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term conveying a sense of [[regret]] concerning [[waste]].&lt;ref name="daijirin"&gt;[https://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%8B%BF%E4%BD%93%E7%84%A1%E3%81%84-645881#E5.A4.A7.E8.BE.9E.E6.9E.97.20.E7.AC.AC.E4.B8.89.E7.89.88 Daijirin Japanese dictionary 2nd ed.] (Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; The expression "Mottainai!" can be uttered alone as an exclamation when something useful, such as food or time, is wasted, meaning roughly "what a waste!" In addition to its primary sense of "wastefulness", the word is also used to mean "impious; irreverent" or "more than one deserves".&lt;ref&gt;Masuda, K: Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary, page 1139. Kenkyusha Ltd., 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mottainai'' in Japanese refers both to physical waste and to wasteful action.  MacQuillan and Preston propose a more elaborate translation that conveys a sense of value and worthiness as "do not destroy (or lay waste to) that which is worthy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alan G. MacQuillan |author2=Ashley L. Preston |title=Globally and Locally: Seeking a Middle Path to Sustainable Development |year=1998 |publisher=University Press of America |location= |isbn=0761811265 |page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Modern Japanese environmentalism ===
In November 2002, the English-language, Japan-based magazine ''[[Look Japan]]'' ran a cover story entitled "Restyling Japan: Revival of the 'Mottainai' Spirit", documenting the motivation amongst volunteers in a "toy hospital" in Japan to "develop in children the habit of looking after their possessions," the re-emergence of repair shops specializing in repairing household appliances or children's clothes, the recycling of [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] bottles and other materials, the collection of waste [[edible oil]], and more generally the efforts to stop the trend of throwing away everything that can no longer be used, i.e. the efforts of reviving "the spirit of ''mottainai''".&lt;ref name="look-japan-2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chiba |first=Hitoshi |date=November 2002 |title=Restyling Japan: Revival of the "Mottainai" Spirit |journal=[[Look Japan]] |url=http://www.lookjapan.com/LBcoverstory/02NovCS.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040405084940/http://www.lookjapan.com/LBcoverstory/02NovCS.htm |archivedate=April 5, 2004 |accessdate=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that context, Hitoshi Chiba, the author, described ''mottainai'' as follows:

{{cquote|We often hear in Japan the expression 'mottainai', which loosely means 'wasteful' but in its full sense conveys a feeling of awe and appreciation for the gifts of nature or the sincere conduct of other people. There is a trait among Japanese people to try to use something for its entire effective life or continue to use it by repairing it. In this caring culture, people will endeavor to find new homes for possessions they no longer need. The 'mottainai' principle extends to the dinner table, where many consider it rude to leave even a single grain of rice in the bowl. The concern is that this traditional trait may be lost.&lt;ref name="look-japan-2002"/&gt;}}

A modern observance that practices mottainai{{clarify|reason=no meaning to "practising" wasteful|date=March 2018}} is the yearly festival of [[Hari-Kuyō]], or the Festival of Broken Needles.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

At the Opening Ceremony of the Science and Technology in Society Forum in 2005, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi stated: "In Japan, there has long been a spirit characterized by the word ''mottainai'', which could be translated as 'don't waste what is valuable'."&lt;ref name=Koizumi2005&gt;{{cite web|url=https://japan.kantei.go.jp/koizumispeech/2005/09/11press_e.html|title=Speeches and Statements by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi|website=japan.kantei.go.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use by Wangari Maathai===
[[Image:Wangari Maathai portrait by Martin Rowe.jpg|thumb|upright|Nobel Prize winner [[Wangari Maathai]] has used the word ''mottainai'' in an environmental protection campaign]]

At a session of the [[United Nations]], [[Kenyan]] environmentalist [[Wangari Maathai]] introduced the word ''mottainai'' as a slogan for environmental protection.&lt;ref name=JAS2014&gt;{{cite journal|

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3756">{{Distinguish|Relativism|Relationism (disambiguation)}}
'''Relationalism''' is any theoretical position that gives importance to the relational nature of things. For relationalism, things exist and function only as relational entities. Relationalism may be contrasted with relationism, which tends to emphasize relations per se.

==Relationalism (philosophical theory) ==
Relationalism in a broader sense applies to any system of thought that gives importance to the relational nature of [[reality]]. But in its narrower and philosophically restricted sense as propounded by the Indian philosopher [[Joseph Kaipayil]]&lt;ref&gt;Kaipayil, Joseph. '' An Essay on Ontology. '' Bangalore: JIP Publications, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Kaipayil, Joseph. '' Relationalism: A Theory of Being. '' Bangalore: JIP Publications, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://independent.academia.edu/JosephKaipayil]&lt;/ref&gt; and others, relationalism refers to the [[theory]] of [[reality]] that interprets the [[existence]], nature, and meaning of things in terms of their relationality or relatedness. On the relationalist view, things are neither self-standing entities nor vague events but relational [[particulars]]. Particulars   are inherently relational, as they are ontologically open to other particulars in their constitution and action. Particulars, as relational particulars, are the ultimate constituents of reality. Particulars interact and make the very fabric of reality.

==Relationalism (theory of space and time) ==
{{main|Relational theory}}
In discussions about [[space and time]], the name relationalism (or relationism) refers to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s relationist notion of space and time as against [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s substantivalist views.&lt;ref&gt;Futch, Michael.  ''Leibniz’s Metaphysics of Time and Space.'' New York: Springer, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Christopher. ''Time, Space and Philosophy.'' London: Routledge, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rickles, Dean. ''Symmetry, Structure and Spacetime.'' Oxford: Elsevier, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]’s substantivalism, space and time are entities in their own right, existing independently of things. Leibniz’s relationism, on the other hand, describes [[space and time]] as systems of relations that exist between objects.

==Relationalism (colour theory) ==
Relationalism in [[colour]] theory, as defended by Jonathan Cohen and others,&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Jonathan. ''The Red and the Real: An Essay on Color Ontology.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Jonathan and Shaun Nichols. “Colours, colour relationalism and the deliverances of introspection."  ''Analysis'' 70 (2010): 218-228.&lt;/ref&gt; means the view that colours of an object are constituted partly in terms of relations with the perceiver. An anti-relationalist view about colour, on the other hand, would insist colours are object-dependent.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Dimitria, Electra. ''Color Fictionalism: Color Discourse without Colors.'' Ann Arbor, MI: ProQuest Information and Learning Company, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
== Relationalism (sociological theory)== 
In [[relational sociology]], relationalism is often contrasted with substantivalism. While substantivalism (also called substantialism) tends to view individuals as self-subsistent entities capable of social interaction, relationalism underscores the social human practices and the individual’s transactional contexts and reciprocal relations. &lt;ref&gt;Emirbayer, Mustafa. “Manifesto for a Relational Sociology.” ''The American Journal of Sociology'' 103 (1997): 281-317. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-refuting ideas''' or '''self-defeating ideas''' are ideas or statements whose falsehood is a [[logical consequence]] of the act or situation of holding them to be true.  Many ideas are called self-refuting by their detractors, and such accusations are therefore almost always controversial, with defenders stating that the idea is being misunderstood or that the [[argument]] is invalid.  For these reasons, none of the ideas below are unambiguously or incontrovertibly self-refuting. These ideas are often used as [[axioms]], which are definitions taken to be true ([[tautology (logic)|tautological]] assumptions), and cannot be used to test themselves, for doing so would lead to only two consequences: [[consistency]] ([[circular reasoning]]) or exception (self-[[contradiction]]). It is important to know that the conclusion of an argument that is self-refuting is not necessarily false, since it could be supported by another, more valid, argument.

==Variations==

===Directly self-denying statements===
The [[Epimenides paradox]] is a statement of the form "this statement is false".  Such statements troubled philosophers, especially when there was a serious attempt to formalize the foundations of logic.  [[Bertrand Russell]] developed his "[[Theory of Types]]" to formalize a set of rules that would prevent such statements (more formally [[Russell's paradox]]) being made in symbolic logic.&lt;ref&gt;Russell B, Whitehead A.N., ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; This work has led to the modern formulation of [[axiomatic set theory]]. While Russell's formalization did not contain such paradoxes, [[Kurt Gödel]] showed that it must contain [[independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] statements. Any [[logical system]] that is rich enough to contain elementary arithmetic contains at least one proposition whose interpretation is ''this proposition is unprovable''  (from within the logical system concerned), and hence no such system can be both [[Complete theory|complete]] and [[Consistency proof|consistent]].

===Indirectly self-denying statements or "fallacy of the stolen concept"{{anchor|stolen concept}}===

[[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivists]] define the fallacy of the stolen concept: the act of using a concept while ignoring, contradicting or denying the validity of the concepts on which it logically and genetically depends.  An example of the stolen concept fallacy is anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s statement, [[Property is theft!|"All property is theft"]].
{{quote|While discussing the hierarchical nature of knowledge, Nathaniel Branden states, "Theft" is a concept that logically and genetically depends on the antecedent concept of "rightfully owned property"—and refers to the act of taking that property without the owner's consent. If no property is rightfully owned, that is, if nothing is property, there can be no such concept as "theft." Thus, the statement "All property is theft" has an internal contradiction: to use the concept "theft" while denying the validity of the concept of "property," is to use "theft" as a concept to which one has no logical right—that is, as a stolen concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nathanielbranden.com/catalog/articles_essays/the_stolen_concept.html ''The Stolen Concept''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501033916/http://www.nathanielbranden.com/catalog/articles_essays/the_stolen_concept.html |date=2007-05-01 }} by Nathaniel Branden - originally published in ''The Objectivist Newsletter'' in January 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Others have said the statement is fallacious only on a superficial reading of Proudhon, devoid of context. Proudhon used the term "property" with reference to claimed ownership in land, factories, etc. He believed such claims were illegitimate, and thus a form of theft from the commons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/ryan/ryan30.html Rockwell, L. ''Performative Contradictions and Subtle Misunderstandings'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Proudhon explicitly states that the phrase "property is theft" is analogous to the phrase "slavery is murder".  According to Proudhon, the slave, though biologically alive, is clearly in a sense "murdered".  The "theft" in his terminology does not refer to ownership any more than the "murder" refers directly to physiological death, but rather both are meant as terms to represent a denial of specific rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/ch01.htm|title=What is Property? Proudhon 1840|first=|last=Proudhon|website=www.marxists.org|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others point out that the difference between the two examples is that "slavery is murder", unlike "property is theft", does not make a statement that denies the validity of one of the concepts it utilizes. We should note as well that Proudhon does not actually say ''all'' property is theft—he is referring to a very specific kind of property rights. Proudhon favored another kind, which he called possession, based on occupancy and use, a sort of [[usufruct]] rights idea. In ''[[What is Property?]]'' he therefore says with the apparent contradiction "property is theft" to denote one sort he feels is this, "property is liberty", referring to the kind he favored, and "property is impossible" to make it clear any sort of property rights cannot be absolute. Separate concepts are therefore laid out in a way that can be confusing, especially if one is not familiar with them.

===In logic===
Self-refutation plays an important role in some inconsistency tolerant logics (e.g. [[paraconsistent logics]] and direct logic&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, C. “Large-scale Organizational Computing requires Unstratified Reflection and Strong Paraconsistency” Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, and Norms in Agent Systems III Jaime Sichman, Pablo Noriega, Julian Padget and Sascha Ossowski (ed.). Springer-Verlag. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;) that lack [[proof by contradiction]]. For example, the negation of a proposition can be proved by showing that the proposition implies its own negation. Likewise, it can be inferred that a proposition cannot be proved by (1) showing that a proof would imply the negation of the proposition or by (2) showing a proof would imply that the negation of the proposition can be proved.

==Examples==
{{Original research|section|date=August 2009}}

===Brain in a vat===
[[Brain in a vat]] is a [[thought experiment]] in philosophy which is premised upon the [[skeptical hypothesis]] that one could actually be a brain in a vat receiving electrical input identical to that which would be coming from the nervous system. Similar premises are found in [[Descartes]]'s [[evil demon]] and [[dream argument]].
Philosopher [[Hilary Putnam]] argues that some versions of the thought experiment would be inconsistent due to [[semantic externalism]]. For a brain in a vat that had only ever experienced the simulated world, the statement "I'm not a brain in a vat" is true. The only possible brains and vats it could be referring to are simulated, and it is true that it is not a simulated brain in a simulated vat. By the same argument, saying "I'm a brain in a vat" would be false.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/bnccde/ph29a/putnam.html Brains in a vat], ''Reason, Truth, and History'' ch. 1, [[Hilary Putnam]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Determinism===
It has been argued, particularly by [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologists]], that to call [[determinism]] a rational statement is doubly self-defeating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |quote=Determinism is self-defeating. A determinist insists that both determinists and non-determinists are determined to believe what they believe. However, determinists believe self-determinists are wrong and ought to change their view. But "ought to change" implies they are free to change, which, within the incompatibilist view,  is contrary to determinism. |url=http://www.ovrlnd.com/Apologetics/Determinism.html |title=Determinism |work= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#To count as rational, a belief must be ''freely'' chosen, which according to the determinist is impossible
#Any kind of debate seems to be posited on the idea that the parties involved are trying to change each other's minds.

The argument does not succeed against the [[compatibilism|compatibilistic]] view, since in the latter there is no conflict between determinism and free will. Moreover, the argument fails if one denies either of the above or its implicit implications. That is, one could avoid the argument by maintaining that free will is not required for rationality or for trying to change one's mind. The latter is a sensible position insofar as one could be determined to try to persuade someone of something, and the listener could be determined to accept it. There is no internal contradiction in that view.

One can also consider a deterministic computer algorithm which is able to make a correct conclusion, such as a mathematical calculation or fingerprint identification. However, on some notions of "rationality", such programs are themselves not rational because they simply follow a certain deterministic pre-programmed path and nothing more. This does not apply if one takes on a position with regards to rationality analogous to compatibilism, namely, one could simply view rationality as the property of correctly executing the laws of logic, in which case there simply is no contradiction with determinism. The contradiction would arise if one defines "rationality" in a manner that is incompatibilist. Some argue that machines cannot "think", and if rationality is defined so that it requires human-like thought, this might pose a problem. But the view that machines cannot "think" in principle is rejected by most{{cn|date=February 2017}} philosophers who accept a [[computational theory of mind]].

===Ethical egoism===

It has been argued that extreme [[ethical egoism]] is self-defeating. Faced with a situation of limited resources, egoists would consume as much of the resource as they could, making the overall situation worse for everybody. Egoists may rejoin that if the situation becomes worse for everybody, that would include the egoist, so it is not, in fact, in his or her rational self-interest to take things to such extremes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-252577/ethics "Ethics"] ''Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the (unregulated) [[tragedy of the commons]] and the (one off) [[prisoner's dilemma]] are cases in which, on the one hand, it is rational for an individual to seek to take as much as possible ''even though'' that makes things worse for everybody, and on the other hand, those cases are not self-refuting since that behaviour remains rational ''even though'' it is ultimately self-defeating, i.e. self-defeating does not imply self-refuting. A tragedy of the commons, however, assumes some degree of public land. That is, a commons forbidding homesteading requires regulation. Thus, an argument against the tragedy of the commons is fundamentally an argument for private property rights and the system that recognizes both property rights and rational self-interest—capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |jstor= 25074025 |title= Environmentalism and Economic Freedom: The Case for Private Property Rights (Journal of Business Ethics , Vol. 17, No. 16 (Dec., 1998), pp. 1887-1899) | author=Walter Block }}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, an increasing respect for individual rights uniquely allows for increasing wealth creation and increasing usable resources despite a fixed amount of raw materials (e.g. the West pre-1776 versus post-1776, East versus West Germany, Hong Kong versus mainland China, North versus South Korea, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.juliansimon.org/writings/Ultimate_Resource/ |title= The Ultimate Resource II: People, Materials, and Environment (1996) | author=Julian Simon |accessdate=2014-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eliminative materialism===
The philosopher [[Mary Midgley]] states that the idea that ''nothing exists except matter'' is also self-refuting because if it were true neither it, nor any other idea, would exist, and similarly that an argument to that effect would be self-refuting because it would deny its own existence.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Mary Midgley]] ''The Myths we Live by''&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2014}} Several other philosophers also argue that [[eliminative materialism]] is self-refuting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Baker |first=L. |year=1987 |title=Saving Belief |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-07320-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Reppert |first=V. |year=1992 |title=Eliminative Materialism, Cognitive Suicide, and Begging the Question |journal=Metaphilosophy |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=378–392 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.1992.tb00550.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Boghossian |first=P. |year=1990 |title=The Status of Content |journal=Philosophical Review |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=157–184 |doi=10.2307/2185488 }} And {{Cite journal |last=Boghossian |first=P. |authormask=1 |year=1991 |title=The Status of Content Revisited |journal=Pacific Philosophical Quarterly |volume=71 |issue= |pages=264–278 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other forms of [[materialism]] may escape this kind of argument because, rather than eliminating the [[mind|mental]], they seek to [[identity theory of mind|identify]] it with, or [[reductive materialism|reduce]] it to, the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Philosophy/faculty/hill/HILLIDENTITYTHEORY.pdf |format=PDF |last=Hill |first=C. |title=Identity Theory |work= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[token identity theory|identity theorists]] such as [[J. J. C. Smart]], [[Ullin Place]] and [[E. G. Boring]] state that ideas exist materially as patterns of [[neural]] structure and activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |quote=To the author a perfect correlation is identity. Two events that always occur together at the same time in the same place, without any temporal or spatial differentiation at all, are not two events but the same event. The mind-body correlations as formulated at present, do not admit of spatial correlation, so they reduce to matters of simple correlation in time. The need for identification is no less urgent in this case. |last=Place |first=U. T. |chapter=Identity Theories |title=A Field Guide to the Philosophy of Mind |publisher={{lang|it|Società italiana per la filosofia analitica}} |editor-first=Marco |editor-last=Nanni |chapterurl=http://host.uniroma3.it/progetti/kant/field/mbit.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://philosophy.uwaterloo.ca/MindDict/identitytheory.html |title=Dictionary of the Philosophy of Mind }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian apologist [[J.P. Moreland]] states that such arguments are based on semantics.&lt;ref&gt;Moreland, J.P., ''The Recalcitrant Imago Dei: Human Persons and the Failure of Naturalism''&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2014}}

===Epimenides paradox===
The first notable self-refuting idea is the [[Epimenides paradox]], a statement attributed to Epimenides, a Cretan philosopher, that "All Cretans are liars". This cannot be true if uttered by a Cretan.

A more common example is the self-refuting statement "I am lying" (because the first statement allows the possibility "some Cretans do not speak the truth", the speaker being one of them).  The second statement has no third alternative—the speaker's statement is either true or false.

===Evolutionary naturalism===
[[Alvin Plantinga]] argues in his [[evolutionary argument against naturalism]] that the combination of naturalism and evolution is "in a certain interesting way self-defeating" because if it were true there would be insufficient grounds to believe that human cognitive faculties are reliable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alvin Plantinga]] in ''Naturalism Defeated?'', Ed. James Beilby [[Cornell University Press]], 2002&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2014}} Consequently, if human cognitive abilities are unreliable, then any human construct, which by implication utilizes cognitive faculties, such as evolutionary theory, would be undermined. In this particular case, it is the confluence of evolutionary theory and naturalism that, according to the argument, undermine the reason for believing themselves to be true. Since Plantinga originally formulated the argument, a few theistic philosophers and Christian apologists have agreed.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Polkinghorne]] is an example of a scientist-theologian who is supportive of Plantinga's position&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Richard Swimburne is a philosopher that supports and utilizes Plantinga's argument effectively in his book "The Existence of God"&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2014}} There has also been a considerable backlash of papers arguing that the argument is flawed in a number of ways, one of the more recent ones published in 2011 by Feng Ye&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/fengye63/naturalizedtruthandplantinga|title=naturalizedTruthAndPlantinga - Feng Ye's Homepage|website=sites.google.com|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also the references in the ''[[Evolutionary argument against naturalism]]'' article).

===Foundationalism===
The philosopher [[Anthony Kenny]] argues that the idea, "common to theists like [[Aquinas]] and [[Descartes]] and to an atheist like [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]" that "Rational belief [is] either self-evident or based directly or indirectly on what is evident" (which he termed "foundationalism" following [[Alvin Plantinga|Plantinga]]) is self-refuting on the basis that this idea is itself neither self-evident nor based directly or indirectly on what is evident and that the same applies to other formulations of such foundationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink=Anthony Kenny |first=Anthony |last=Kenny |title=What is Faith? |location=Oxford |publisher=OUP |year=1992 |isbn=0-19-283067-8 |pages=9–10 }} This particular chapter is based on a 1982 lecture which may explain the shift in the meaning of the term "foundationalism" since then&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the [[self-evident]] impossibility of [[regress argument|infinite regress]] can be offered as a justification for foundationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/justep-foundational/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Ali|last1=Hasan|first2=Richard|last2=Fumerton|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=11 March 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=11 March 2018|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the identification of problems with "naive foundationalism", the term is now often used to focus on [[incorrigible]] beliefs (modern foundationalism), or [[basic belief]]s (reformed foundationalism).

===Philosophical skepticism===
[[Philosophical skeptic]]s state that "nothing can be known".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galilean-library.org/int20.html|title=The Gallilean Library|publisher=|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has caused some to ask if nothing can be known then can that statement itself be known, or is it self-refuting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/skept.htm Suber, P. ''Classical Skepticism'']&lt;/ref&gt; One very old response to this problem is [[academic skepticism]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/c/cicero-a.htm|title=Cicero: Academic Skepticism - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an exception is made for the skeptic's own statement. This leads to further debate about consistency and [[special pleading]]. Another response is to accept that ''nothing can be known'' cannot itself be known, so that it is not known whether anything is knowable or not. This is [[Pyrrhonic]] skepticism. However, the issue can be pressed further. To state that ''nothing can be known'' is itself unknowable, is to state that it is a fact that ''nothing can be known'' is unknowable. This admits at least one form of knowledge, and the metaphysical proposition ''I can discern truth''. It is therefore self-refuting; only justified through an infinite regress of not knowing knowledge claims and not knowing that one can know them ''ad infinitum''.

===Relativism===
It is often stated that [[relativism]] about [[truth]] must be applied to itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/c/cog-rel.htm#H5|title=Cognitive Relativism - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The problem of self-refutation is quite general. It arises whether truth is relativized to a framework of concepts, of beliefs, of standards, of practices. [http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/relativism/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; The cruder form of the argument concludes that since the relativist is calling relativism an absolute truth, it leads to a [[contradiction]]. Relativists often rejoin that in fact relativism is only relatively true, leading to a subtler problem: the absolutist, the relativist's opponent,  is perfectly entitled, by the relativist's ''own'' standards, to reject relativism. That is, the relativist's arguments can have no [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] force over someone who has different [[basic beliefs]].&lt;ref&gt;"If truth is relative, then non-relativist points of view can legitimately claim to be true relative to some standpoints." [http://people.alfred.edu/~westacott/On%20the%20Motivations%20for%20Relativism.pdf Westacott, E. ''On the Motivations for Relativism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solipsism===
On the face of it, a ''statement'' of [[solipsism]] is &amp;mdash; at least performatively &amp;mdash; self-defeating, because a statement assumes another person to whom the statement is made. (That is to say, an unexpressed private belief in solipsism is not self-refuting). This, of course, assumes the solipsist would not communicate with a hallucination, even if just for [[entertainment|self-amusement]].

One response is that the solipsist's interlocutor is in fact a figment of their imagination, but since their interlocutor knows they are not, they are not going to be convinced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |quote=As against solipsism it is to be said, in the first place, that it is psychologically impossible to believe, and is rejected in fact even by those who mean to accept it. I once received a letter from an eminent logician, Mrs. [[Christine Ladd Franklin]], saying that she was a solipsist, and was surprised that there were no others. Coming from a logician and a solipsist, her surprise surprised me. |last=Russell |first=B. |title=Human Knowledge: Its Scope and Limits |location=New York |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1948 |page=180 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verification and falsification principles===
The statements "statements are meaningless unless they can be empirically verified" and "statements are meaningless unless they can be empirically falsified" have both been called self-refuting on the basis that they can neither be empirically verified nor falsified.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. the discussion by {{Cite book |first=William P. |last=Alston |chapter=Religious language and verificationism |editor-first=Paul K. |editor-last=Moser |editor2-first=Paul |editor2-last=Copan |title=The Rationality of Theism |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |isbn=0-415-26332-8 |pages=26–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar arguments have been made for statements such as "no statements are true unless they can be shown empirically to be true", which was a problem for [[logical positivism]].&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. [[Keith Ward]], ''[[Is Religion Dangerous?]]'' p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wittgenstein's ''Tractatus''===
The ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' is an unusual example of a self-refuting argument, in that [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] explicitly admits to the issue at the end of the work:

{{quote|My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.)
(6.54){{page needed|date=December 2014}}}}

However, this idea can be solved in the sense that, even if the argument itself is self-refuting, the effects of the argument elicit understandings that go beyond the argument itself. [[Søren Kierkegaard]] describes it as such:
{{quote|[The reader] can understand that the understanding is a revocation--the understanding with him as the sole reader is indeed the revocation of the book. He can understand that to write a book and to revoke it is not the same as refraining from writing it, that to write a book that does not demand to be important for anyone is still not the same as letting it be unwritten.|''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]''{{page needed|date=December 2014}}}}

== Life and influence ==

He was born in the village of Konaka in present-day [[Sano, Tochigi|Sano]], [[Tochigi Prefecture]], and was the son of the village [[Village head|headman]]. In 1857, he became headman after his father and served for twelve years.&lt;ref name="Perspectives"/&gt;{{rp|113}} In 1879, he founded the ''Tochigi Shimbun'', a periodical in which he discussed human rights and contemporary issues.&lt;ref name="n"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Nihon Daihyakka Zensho (Nipponika) |title=田中正造 |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |accessdate=2013-11-08 |year=2013 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=Japanese |trans-title=Shōzō Tanaka |oclc=153301537 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archivedate=August 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanaka became a member of the Tochigi Prefectural Assembly in 1880, and its Chairman in 1886.&lt;ref name="NDL"/&gt; In the [[Japanese general election, 1890|general election of 1890]], the first ever held in Japan, he was elected to the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] as a member of the [[Rikken Kaishintō]], a liberal political party.&lt;ref name="NDL"/&gt;

[[File:Stanisłaŭ Jundził. Станіслаў Юндзіл (J. Rustem, 1822).jpg|thumb|200px|Stanisław Bonifacy Jundziłł (1822). Portrait by [[Jan Rustem]]]]

'''Stanisław Bonifacy Jundziłł''' or, in Lithuanian, '''Stanislovas Bonifacas Jundzilas''' (6 May 1761 in Jasiańce, [[Voranava District]] &amp;ndash; 15 April 1847 in [[Vilnius]]) was a [[Polish-Lithuanian (adjective)|Polish-Lithuanian]] priest, [[botanist]], educator and diarist who lectured at the [[University of Vilnius]].

== Biography ==
[[File:Opisanie roslin.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Title page from ''Description of Plants'']]
He was born into an impoverished noble family and did his best to get an education on his own, but was not able to go to school until 1774, when his father married for a third time and received a very generous dowry. From 1774 to 1779, he attended schools operated by the [[Piarists]]. It was during this period that he became nearly blind in his right eye.

With no money or career connections, he joined the Piarist order. After completing his religious vows, he taught a variety of subjects at their schools in [[Raseiniai]] and Vilnius through 1786. He then continued his own studies in chemistry and botany with [[Georg Forster]] and [[Jean-Emmanuel Gilibert]], and helped create a [[botanical garden]] at the University. 

In 1792, he received a scholar's grant that enabled him to study abroad. He travelled throughout Eastern and Central Europe until 1794, when his grant was discontinued after the [[Second Partition of Poland]]. However, he was able to obtain financial assistance from Count [[Ignacy Potocki]] and Princess [[Izabela Czartoryska]], so he remained in Vienna for a while, organizing a garden of medicinal plants at the [[University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna|University of Veterinary Medicine]] while continuing to study a wide range of subjects.

He returned to Vilnius in 1797 and, in 1800, took his doctorate in [[Theology]]. This enabled him to become a Professor of botany and zoology at the University in 1802. He retired in 1824 and spent much of his time travelling.

In his later years, he came into conflict with the new teachers at the University, criticizing their [[cosmopolitanism]] and lack of patriotism and predicting that their activities would have serious consequences; a prediction that came true when the University was closed by the Russian government in 1832. After that, saddened by the slow destruction of his beloved botanical garden, his health worsened and he eventually went totally blind.

== Scientific and pedagogical activity ==
He was one of the first to teach [[veterinary medicine]] in Lithuania and was the author of several basic textbooks on botany and zoology. His studies of [[migratory birds]] were among the earliest in that area.

He was also the author of the first scientifically precise description of the flora and fauna of Lithuania, based on the classificatory system of [[Carl Linnaeus]], and won a gold medal for his work ''Botanika stosowana'' (Applied Botany).

'''Stony Point Center''' is one of three conference centers of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]]. The other two conference and retreat centers are [[Ghost Ranch]] and [[Montreat, North Carolina|Montreat]]. Stony Point Center welcomes people of all faiths and nations to discern, discover, learn and lead.

Stony Point Center is located on {{convert|32|acre|ha}} in the Hudson River Valley in the town of [[Stony Point, New York]], {{convert|30|mi|km}} north of [[Manhattan]]. The facility began about 150 years ago as a ministry of hospitality shaped by four daughters of a Presbyterian minister.

In a given year, the center with its 180-bed campus welcomes a wide variety of groups who come to hold their own programs/retreats. Stony Point Center sponsors programming focused on nonviolence, peace and justice, environment, spiritual practices and church issues. Since 2009, it has been the spiritual home of the Community of Living Traditions.

Stony Point Center is a Ministry of the Presbyterian Church, (USA).

In 2000, Stony Point Center established the "[[John Garcia Gensel]] Award for Integrating Faith and the Arts"; the first award was given that year to [[Dave Brubeck]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reformiert-online.net/aktuell/details.php?id=154&amp;lg=de]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8552">The '''temporal paradox''', or '''time problem''' is a controversial issue in the evolutionary relationships of birds. It was described by [[paleornithology|paleornithologist]] [[Alan Feduccia]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="Feduccia94"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Feduccia, Alan|year= 1994|title=The Great Dinosaur Debate|journal= Living Bird|volume= 13|pages=29–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feduccia96"&gt;Feduccia, Alan (1996) "The Origin and Evolution of Birds."  [[Yale University Press]]. [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven, Conn.]] USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  It reflects a conflict between where chronologically fossils are expected to be found based on a proposed phylogeny, and where they are actually found.  The temporal paradox can give rise to alternative phylogenies (i.e. the archosaurian hypothesis of bird evolution).
Statistical measures have been devised to assess the likelihood of proposed phylogenies based on the size and positioning of gaps in the fossil record. 

==Objection to consensus==
[[File:Paleontological temporal paradox diagram 02.jpg|thumb|Diagram illustrating the determined age of four different prehistoric bird genera, compared to the age of some birdlike [[dinosaurs]] and [[feathered dinosaurs]].]]The concept of a "temporal paradox" is based on the following facts. The consensus view is that birds evolved from dinosaurs, but the most bird-like [[dinosaurs]], including almost all of the [[feathered dinosaurs]] and those believed to be most closely related to birds are known mostly from the [[Cretaceous]], by which time birds had already evolved and diversified. If bird-like dinosaurs are the ancestors of birds they should, then, be older than birds, but ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' is 155 million years old, while the very bird-like ''[[Deinonychus]]'' is 35 million years younger. This idea is sometimes summarized as "you can't be your own grandmother". As paleontologist [[Peter Dodson]] pointed out:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I hasten to add that none of the known small [[theropod]]s, including ''[[Deinonychus]]'', ''[[Dromaeosaurus]]'', ''[[Velociraptor]]'', ''[[Unenlagia]]'', nor ''[[Sinosauropteryx]]'', ''[[Protarchaeopteryx]]'', nor ''[[Caudipteryx]]'' is itself relevant to the origin of [[birds]]; these are all [[Cretaceous]] [[fossils]] ... and as such can at best represent only structural stages through which an avian ancestor may be hypothezised to have passed.&lt;ref name=Dodson2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodson|first=P.|title=Origin of Birds: The Final Solution?|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|date=2000|volume=40|issue=4|pages=504–512|doi=10.1093/icb/40.4.504|url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/4/504.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Fitting phylogenies to the fossil record==
How well a proposed phylogeny fits the fossil record is indicative of the likelihood that the phylogeny is a true representation of evolutionary relationships.  Interrecord gaps in the fossil record ([[ghost lineage]]s) are a key indicator: the longer a ghost lineage chronologically, the less likely that the first appearance of the terminal organism (FAD) is evolved from the predecessor.  Various composite measures of ghost lineages in a proposed phylogeny have been formulated: MSM*, SCI,
GER, SMIG. 

==Problems==
{{jargon|section|date=April 2014}}
Numerous researchers have discredited the idea of the temporal paradox. Paleontologist Lawrence Witmer (2002) summarized this critical literature by pointing out that there are at least three lines of evidence that contradict it.&lt;ref name="Witmer02"/&gt;

First, no one has proposed that [[maniraptora]]n dinosaurs of the Cretaceous are the ancestors of birds. They have merely found that dinosaurs like [[dromaeosaur]]s, [[troodontid]]s and [[oviraptorosaur]]s are close relatives of birds. The true ancestors are thought to be older than ''Archaeopteryx'', perhaps Early [[Jurassic]] or even older. The scarcity of maniraptoran fossils from then is unsurprising as fossilization is a rare event requiring special circumstances, and fossils of animals in sediments from ages that they actually inhabited may never be found.

Second, fragmentary remains of maniraptoran dinosaurs actually had been known from Jurassic deposits in China, North America, and Europe for many years. For example, the femur of a tiny maniraptoran from the [[Late Jurassic]] of Colorado was reported by Padian and Jensen in 1989 &lt;ref name="Jensen&amp;Padian1989"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Jensen, James A. &amp; Padian, Kevin|year= 1989|title= "Small pterosaurs and dinosaurs from the Uncompahgre fauna (Brushy Basin member, Morrison Formation: ?Tithonian), Late Jurassic, western Colorado|journal= Journal of Paleontology|volume= 63|number=3|pages=364–373}}&lt;/ref&gt; while teeth of dromaeosaurids and troodontids are known from Jurassic England.&lt;ref name="Witmer02"&gt;Witmer, L.M. (2002). “The Debate on Avian Ancestry; Phylogeny, Function and Fossils”, “Mesozoic Birds: Above the Heads of Dinosaurs” pp.&amp;nbsp;3–30. {{ISBN|0-520-20094-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complete skeletons of Middle-Late Jurassic maniraptorans were subsequently described from China. The known diversity of pre-[[Tithonian]] (and thus pre-''Archaeopteryx'') non-avian maniraptorans includes ''[[Ornitholestes]]'', the possible [[therizinosaur]] ''[[Eshanosaurus]]'', the [[Troodontidae|troodontids]] ''[[Anchiornis]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hu | first1 = D. | last2 = Hou | first2 = L. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = L. | last4 = Xu | first4 = X. | title = A pre-Archaeopteryx troodontid theropod from China with long feathers on the metatarsus | doi = 10.1038/nature08322 | journal = Nature | volume = 461 | issue = 7264 | pages = 640–3 | year = 2009 | pmid =  
19794491| pmc = |bibcode = 2009Natur.461..640H }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the as yet unnamed [[Morrison Formation|Morrison]] [[WDC DML 001]], the [[Scansoriopterygidae|scansoriopterygids]] ''[[Epidexipteryx]]'' and ''[[Epidendrosaurus]]'' &lt;ref name="zhangetal2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zhang | first1 = F. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = Z. | last3 = Xu | first3 = X. | last4 = Wang | first4 = X. | last5 = Sullivan | first5 = C. | title = A bizarre Jurassic maniraptoran from China with elongate ribbon-like feathers | doi = 10.1038/nature07447 | journal = Nature | volume = 455 | issue = 7216 | pages = 1105–8 | year = 2008 | pmid =

Third, if the temporal paradox would indicate that birds should not have evolved from maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs, then this raises the question of what animals would be more likely ancestors considering their age. Brochu and Norell (2001) analyzed this question using six of the other archosaurs that have been proposed as bird ancestors, and found that all of them create temporal paradoxes&amp;nbsp;– long stretches between the ancestor and ''Archaeopteryx'' where there are no intermediate fossils&amp;nbsp;– that are actually worse. The MSM value{{clarify|date=April 2014}} for the theropod option was 0.438–0.466.&lt;ref name=Brochu&amp;Norell2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brochu|first=Christopher A.|author2=Norell, Mark A. |title=Temporal congruence and the origin of birds|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|date=2000|volume=20|issue=1|pages=197–200|doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2000)020[0197:TCATOO]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Pol and Norell (2006) calculated MSM* values for the same proposed bird ancestors and obtained the same relative results. The MSM* value for the theropod option was 0.31–0.40.&lt;ref name=Pol&amp;Norell2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pol|first=Diego|author2=Norell, Mark |title=Uncertainty in the Age of Fossils and the Stratigraphic Fit to Phylogenies|journal=Systematic Biology|date=2006|volume=55|issue=3|pages=512–521|doi=10.1080/10635150600755446|url=http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/3/512.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, even if one used the logic of the temporal paradox, one should still prefer dinosaurs as the ancestors to birds.&lt;ref name="Brochu&amp;Norell2001"&gt;Brochu, Christopher A. Norell, Mark A. (2001) "Time and trees: A quantitative assessment of temporal congruence in the bird origins debate" pp.&amp;nbsp;511–35 in "New Perspectives on the Origin and Early Evolution of Birds" Gauthier&amp;Gall, ed.

'''''The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation''''' (1992; second edition 2006) is a book by literary critic [[Harold Bloom]], in which the author covers the topic of [[religion in the United States]] from a perspective which he calls ''religious criticism''.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Harold, ''The American Religion'', second edition (Chu Hartley Publishers, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Religious denominations Bloom discusses include [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], [[Christian Science]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and the [[Southern Baptist Convention]].

==Summary==

Bloom lays out his conception of a practice of ''religious criticism'', by which he does not mean [[criticism of religion]].  He distinguishes the practice from other aspects of [[religious studies]] (e.g., [[history of religion]] or [[philosophy of religion]]) by analogy with his practice of [[literary criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bloom says, literary criticism involves aspects of history ''et cetera'',  but is distinguished by having a focus on [[Aesthetics#aesthetic judgment|aesthetic judgments]] concerning literature.  Bloom's religious criticism thus will involve history ''et cetera'', but also pay attention particularly to the [[spirituality|spiritual]] values of religions.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this book, Bloom begins this practice by looking at religious groups in the [[United States of America]]. Bloom identifies [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[William James]] as previous scholars who practiced religious criticism of American religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;  He concludes that in America there is a single, dominant religion of which many nominally distinct denominations are a part.  Among these he identifies [[Mormonism]], the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], [[Pentecostalism]], and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventism]].  To a lesser extent however, he also includes nearly all "Christian" denominations in America, including [[mainline Protestantism]] and [[Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bloom's view is that all of these groups in America are united by requiring that each person may only truly meet with the divine when experiencing a "total inward solitude" and that salvation cannot be achieved by engaging with a community, but only through a one-to-one confrontation with the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; While Bloom suggests that this American form of religion is to some extent a continuation of [[Enthusiasm]] in Europe, American religious groups are rightly distinguished from traditional [[Christianity]]: Although all of these groups identify as Christian, Bloom believes they represent a radical departure from the core aspects of that religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bloom says that the American religion is rather more like a form of [[Gnosticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom says that the events of the [[Second Great Awakening]] at [[Cane Ridge]] were formative for the American religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloom regards the American Religion as successful by his standards for religious imagination; however, he distinguishes this success from the social and political consequences of the religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  At times he criticizes elements in the American religion for their political activities, saying even that he is "politically appalled by what may be some of its consequences. Since the Reagan-Bush national Republicans have become one with the American Religion, my fear is that we will never again see a Democrat in the Presidency during my lifetime."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

In ''[[Reviews in American History]]'', [[Henry F. May]] writes that the work is "brilliant  and  original" and that "Historians interested in American religion ... will do well to read it and think about what it says." He also however criticizes Bloom for being "unabashedly subjective and sometimes wrong-headed" and using "sweeping  generalizations".&lt;ref&gt;May, Henry F., "Democratic Gnosticism: The American Religion?", ''Reviews in American History'', Vol. 21, No. 2 (Jun., 1993), p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', [[Richard John Neuhaus]] dismissed the book as "a 288-page imaginative flirtation with nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;Neuhaus, Richard John, "Reviews: On Faith: ''The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation'' By Harold Bloom", ''Commentary'' (September 1992), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Neuhaus says that Bloom's interpretations of various denominations unduly ignore the explicit statements from these religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;Neuhaus (1992), p. 57 &amp; 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]'', James P. Hanigan says that Bloom offers "suggestive and important insights", particularly the claim that traditional Christianity is not well-suited to Americans, and that the belief in direct experience of God is connected to [[anti-intellectualism]].  Hanigan suggests though that Bloom's argument is motivated by his own "Gnostic" spirituality, and concludes that it is, in the end, unpersuasive.&lt;ref&gt;Hanigan, James P., "Book Review: ''The American Religion'' by Harold Bloom", ''America'' (October 3, 1992), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==

The first edition was published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 1992 with the full title, ''The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation''.  The second edition was published by Chu Hartley Publishers in 2006 without the subtitle and included a new [[afterword]].

'''''The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations that Transform the World''''' is a [[popular science]] book by the physicist [[David Deutsch]] first published in 2011.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;&lt;ref name=johnstone/&gt;&lt;ref name=Horgan&gt;{{cite news|last=Horgan|first=John|title=To Err Is Progress. How to foster the growth of scientific knowledge: accept that it is limited no matter how definitive it may seem.|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304911104576446002846669480|accessdate=17 September 2011|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=20 July 2011|authorlink=John Horgan (American journalist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Deutsch views the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] of the 18th century as near the beginning of an infinite sequence of purposeful [[knowledge]] creation. Knowledge here consists of [[information]] with good explanatory function that has proven resistant to [[falsifiability|falsification]]. Any real process is physically possible to perform provided the knowledge to do so has been acquired. The enlightenment set up the conditions for knowledge creation which disrupted the static societies that previously existed. These conditions are the valuing of creativity and the free and open debate that exposed ideas to criticism to reveal those good explanatory ideas that naturally resist being falsified due to their having basis in reality. Deutsch points to previous moments in history, such as [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Florence]] and Plato's [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] in Golden age [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], where this process almost got underway before succumbing to their static societies' resistance to change.

The source of intelligence is more complicated than brute computational power, Deutsch conjectures, and he points to the lack of progress in Turing test [[AI]] programs in the six decades since the [[Turing test]] was first proposed. What matters for knowledge creation, Deutsch says, is [[creativity]]. New ideas that provide good explanations for phenomena require outside-the-box thinking as the unknown is not easily predicted from past experience. To test this Deutsch suggests an AI behavioural evolution program for robot locomotion should be fed random numbers to see if knowledge spontaneously arises without inadvertent contamination from a human programmer's creative input. If it did Deutsch would concede that intelligence is not as difficult a problem as he currently thinks it is.

Deutsch sees [[quantum superposition]]s and the [[Schrödinger equation]] as evidence for his many worlds quantum [[multiverse]], where everything physically possible occurs in an infinite branching of [[alternate histories]]. Deutsch argues that a great deal of fiction is close to a fact somewhere in the multiverse.&lt;ref&gt;Beginning of Infinity, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;
Deutsch extols the usefulness of the concept of [[fungible|fungibility]] in quantum transactions, his universes and the particles they contain are fungible in their interactions across the multiverse structure. Deutsch explains that [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] offers evidence for this multiverse phenomenon where alternate histories affect one another without allowing the passage of information, as they fungibly intertwine again shortly after experiencing alternate events. According to Deutsch, our perspective on any object we detect with our senses is just a single universe slice of a much larger quantum multiverse object.

Deutsch speculates on the process of human-culture development from a [[Genetics|genetic]] basis through to a memetic [[emergence]]. This emergence led to the creation of static societies where innovation occurs, but most of the time at a rate too slow for individuals to notice during their lifetimes. It was only at the point where knowledge of how to purposefully create new knowledge through good explanations was acquired that the beginning of infinity took off during the enlightenment. His explanation for human creativity is that it evolved as a way to faithfully reproduce existing [[memes]], as this would require creative intelligence to produce a refined rule set that would more faithfully reproduce the existing memes that happened to confer benefit (and all the other memes too). From this increased creative ability, the ability to create new memes emerged and humans thus became [[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]]s and technological development accelerated.

Deutsch criticizes [[Jared Diamond]]'s resource luck theories as to why the West came to dominate the other continents outlined in his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]''. For Deutsch, the sustained creation of knowledge could have arisen anywhere and led to a beginning of infinity; it just happened to arise in Europe first. Deutsch extols the philosophical concept of [[optimism]], where although problems are inevitable, solutions will always exist provided the right knowledge is sought out and acquired.

==Reception==
[[David Albert]], a philosophy professor at [[Columbia University]], has described the book in a ''[[New York Times]]'' review as "brilliant and exhilarating" but presenting, instead of a "tight, grand, cumulative system of ideas," a "great, wide, learned, meandering conversation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Albert|first=David|title=Explaining it All: How We Became the Center of the Universe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/books/review/the-beginning-of-infinity-by-david-deutsch-book-review.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=15 September 2011|newspaper=The New York Times Sunday Book Review|date=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also states that Deutsch does not present "a live scientific hypothesis," but "[a] mood informed by profound and imaginative reflection on the best and most advanced science we have." Doug Johnstone writes in ''[[The Independent]]'' that Deutsch's "examination of the multiverse theory of quantum physics is great. But when he tries to apply his ideas to aesthetics, cultural creativity and moral philosophy, he seems on shakier ground and is less commanding as a result."&lt;ref name=johnstone&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnstone|first=Doug|title=The Beginning of Infinity, By David Deutsch:  Brain the size of Birmingham, ego bigger still|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-beginning-of-infinity-by-david-deutsch-2254066.html|accessdate=15 September 2011|newspaper=The Independent|date=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Forbes also writing in ''The Independent'' has a more positive take on Deutsch's ideas and mode of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Forbes|first=Peter|title=The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations that Transform the World, By David Deutsch|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-beginning-of-infinity-explanations-that-transform-the-world-by-david-deutsch-2258470.html|accessdate=15 September 2011|newspaper=The Independent|date=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Economist]]'s'' review says ''The Beginning of Infinity'' is "equally bold" as Deutsch's previous book ''[[The Fabric of Reality]]'', and "its conclusions are just as profound. Mr Deutsch argues that decent explanations inform moral philosophy, political philosophy and even aesthetics. He is provocative and persuasive."&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite news|title=In the beginning: A quantum physicist's long-awaited second book|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18438055|accessdate=15 September 2011|newspaper=The Economist|date=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''' take is the book is "A philosophical exploration of progress, surprisingly lucid and thought-provoking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=THE BEGINNING OF INFINITY|journal=Kirkus Reviews|date=1 June 2011|url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/non-fiction/david-deutsch/beginning-infinity/|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''timeline of the evolutionary history of life''' represents the current [[scientific theory]] outlining the major events during the development of [[life]] on planet [[Earth]]. In [[biology]], [[evolution]] is any change across successive generations in the heritable characteristics of biological populations. Evolutionary processes give rise to diversity at every level of [[biological organization]], from [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] to [[species]], and individual [[organism]]s and [[molecule]]s, such as [[DNA]] and [[protein]]s. The similarities between all present day organisms indicate the presence of a [[common descent|common ancestor]] from which all known species, living and [[Extinction|extinct]], have diverged through the process of evolution. More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species,&lt;ref name="Book-Biology"&gt;{{harvnb|McKinney|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4LHnCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 110]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct.&lt;ref name="StearnsStearns2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stearns |first=Beverly Peterson |last2=Stearns |first2=S.

While the dates given in this article are estimates based on [[scientific evidence]], there has been controversy between more traditional views of increased [[biodiversity]] through a cone of diversity with the passing of time and the view that the basic pattern on Earth has been one of annihilation and diversification and that in certain past times, such as the [[Cambrian explosion]], there was great diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.as.wvu.edu/~kgarbutt/EvolutionPage/Studentsites/Burgesspages/models_of_evolution.html |title=The Burgess Shale &amp; Models of Evolution |last1=Hickman |first1=Crystal |last2=Starn |first2=Autumn |website=Reconstructions of the Burgess Shale and What They Mean... |publisher=[[West Virginia University]] |location=Morgantown, WV |accessdate=2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|Briggs|Eisen|Goldstein|2007|loc=[http://www.evolution-textbook.org/content/free/figures/10_EVOW_Art/20_EVOW_CH10.pdf Figure 10.20]}} Four diagrams of evolutionary models&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extinction ==
{{Main|Extinction event}}
[[File:Geological time spiral.png|thumb|right|240px|Visual representation of the history of life on Earth as a spiral]]
Species go extinct constantly as environments change, as organisms compete for environmental niches, and as genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones. Occasionally biodiversity on Earth takes a hit in the form of a [[mass extinction]] in which the extinction rate is much higher than usual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/palaeontology/measuring-sixth-mass-extinction|title=Measuring the sixth mass extinction - Cosmos|website=cosmosmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large extinction-event often represents an accumulation of smaller extinction- events that take place in a relatively brief period of time.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/history_of_the_earth# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816103516/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/history_of_the_earth# |archive-date=2016-08-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known mass extinction in earth's history was the [[Great Oxygenation Event]] 2.4 billion years ago. That event led to the loss of most of the planet's [[obligate anaerobe]]s. Researchers have identified five major extinction events in earth's history since:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/palaeontology/big-five-extinctions|title=The big five mass extinctions - Cosmos|website=cosmosmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* End of the [[Ordovician]]: 440 million years ago, 86% of all species lost, including [[graptolite]]s
* Late [[Devonian]]: 375 million years ago, 75% of species lost, including most [[trilobite]]s
* End of the [[Permian]], "The Great Dying": 251 million years ago, 96% of species lost, including [[tabulate coral]]s, and most extant trees and [[synapsid]]s
* End of the [[Triassic]]: 200 million years ago, 80% of species lost, including all of the [[conodont]]s
* End of the [[Cretaceous]]: 66 million years ago, 76% of species lost, including all of the [[ammonite]]s, [[mosasaur]]s, [[ichthyosaur]]s, [[plesiosaur]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, and nonavian [[dinosaur]]s

(Dates and percentages represent estimates.)

Smaller extinction-events have occurred in the periods between these larger catastrophes, with some standing at the delineation points of the periods and epochs recognized by scientists in [[Geologic time scale|geologic time]]. The [[Holocene extinction]] event is currently under way.&lt;ref name="pnas98_1"&gt;

'''Trikonic''', is a technique of triadic analysis-synthesis which has been developed by Gary Richmond based on the original idea of a possible applied science making three categorial distinctions, which [[philosopher]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], its creator, called “Trichotomic.” Peirce introduces trichotomic as the "art of making three-fold divisions.”

[[File:Trikonic - Figure 1.0 The Trikonic Symbol.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 1.0 The Trikonic Symbol]]

The symbol shown in Figure 1.0 is referred to as the ‘trikon’ symbol by Richmond (2005).  It displays the divisions of three categorial elements and their relationship for the subject in consideration

== Trikonic Analysis/Peircean Category Theory ==
A major part of trikonic analysis is the three Peircean categories; these consist of firstness, secondness and thirdness:
* ''"Firstness is the mode of being that of which is such as it is, positively and without reference to anything else.
* ''Secondness is the mode of being that which is such as it is, with respect to a second but regardless of any third.
* ''Thirdness is the mode of being that which is such as it is, in bringing a second and third into relation to each other."''

[[File:Trikonic - Figure 2.0 The Three Peircean Categories.jpg|right|thumb|Figure 2.0 The Three Peircean Categories]]

Another way of describing the basic understanding of these notions is from Sowa:
:''“First is the conception of being or existing independent of anything else. Second is the conception of being relative to, the conception of reaction, with something else. Third is the conception of mediation, whereby a first and a second are brought into relation. (1891)”''

Trikonically represented, the categories are (Figure 2.0):

There are many ways in which these notions can be interpreted.{{According to whom|date=February 2016}}  These are can be represented as:

Peirce's Three Universes of Experience (Figure 3.0):

[[File:Trikonic - Figure 3.0 Peirce's Three Universes of Experience.jpg|none|thumb|Figure 3.0 Peirce's Three Universes of Experience:]]

These in turn represent Peirce's three Universal Categories (Figure 4.0 The Universal Categories):

[[Image:Universal Categories.jpg|none|thumb|Figure 4.0 The Universal Categories:]]

In addition to the universal categories, there are equivalent ''Existential Categories'' (Figure 5.0 The Existential Categories):

[[File:Trikonic - Figure 5.0 The Existential Categories.jpg|none|thumb|Figure 5.0 The Existential Categories:]]

We can also trikonically analyse thought, by identifying three ''Logical Modalities''{{According to whom|date=February 2016}} (Figure 6.0 The Logical Modalities):

[[File:Trikonic - Figure 6.0 The Logical Modalities.jpg|none|thumb|Figure 6.0 The Logical Modalities:]]

With these representations in mind, firstness, secondness and thirdness can be defined as the following{{According to whom|date=February 2016}}:

*'''Firstness''' is concerned with ideas, character, qualities, feeling, image and possibility.
*'''Secondness''' signifies events, brute actions, reactions, existence and character.
*'''Thirdness''' brings together firstness in relation to secondness.

== Vector Analysis==
[[Image:Vectors.jpg|right|thumb|Figure 7.0 The Vectors]]
There are six vectors{{According to whom|date=February 2016}} that can be used in trikonic vector analysis; these are shown in Figure 7.0.

These six vectors have also been referred to as “directions of movement through the trikon” (Richmond, 2005).  They are authentic permutations of the triad, i.e. they are different arrangements of the order of firstness, secondness and thirdness{{According to whom|date=February 2016}}. They represent the relationships between firstness (1ns), secondness (2ns) and thirdness (3ns) for the object that is being analysed.

*'''''Vector of Process''''' – (1ns) chance sporting, then follows patterns of habit formation (3ns) which leads to some actual structural change in an organism (2ns).
*'''''Vector of Order''''' – thesis (1ns), subsequently antithesis (2ns) leading to synthesis (3ns).
*'''''Vector of Representation''''' – An engineer (3ns) create a CAD drawing (1ns) of a signalling design (2ns).
*'''''Vector of Analysis''''' – 3ns which involves 2ns which in turn involves 1ns.
*'''''Vector of Determination''''' – The object determines (2ns) a sign (1ns) for an interpretant (3ns).
*'''''Vector of Aspiration''''' - (2ns), (3ns), (1ns), represents the unique character specifically in human community development.

[[Image:Triknoic-Figure 8.0 The Determination Vector.jpg|right|thumb|Figure 8.0 The Determination Vector]]

Within trikonic are six directions, which are all permutations of logical paths of relations keeping the notion of 1ns, 2ns and 3ns throughout the object under consideration.

You can interpret these in many ways, for example, the Determination Vector and Representation Vector (Please refer to Figure 8.0 and Figure 9.0).{{According to whom|date=February 2016}}

[[File:Trikonic - Figure 9.0 The Representation Vector.jpg|none|thumb|Figure 9.0 The Representation Vector]]

The reasoning behind the exploration of the six vectors within the triad aims at bringing a new view on analysis and a more systematic treatment to some of the difficult issues which arise especially in semiotic analysis, i.e. the vector process is a graphically logical analysis with aspects of dependence and constraint, and correlation, which tie in with the "living" reflection of the categories by the semiotic triad.{{According to whom|date=February 2016}}

The reasoning behind the vector analysis is to use the permutations within the triad for the theory and any actual semiosis, mostly the analysis of complex virtual communicative projects.{{According to whom|date=February 2016}}  [[Semiosis]] is defined as:

"Semiosis is the making or production of meaning. The term was introduced by Charles Peirce (1839-1914) to describe the process of signification within the science of signs now termed semiology".

Trikonic analysis could lead to a kind of trikonic synthesis (the combination of separate elements or substances to form a coherent whole producing fundamental change in the further evolution of virtual community development.{{Weasel inline|date=February 2016}}

== Trikonic Analysis in HCI ==
Richmond suggests that ''“not all things can be trikonically analysed”'' (2005).  However, there has been investigation into whether trikonic can be applied to HCI related issues.{{According to whom|date=February 2016}}  Especially, those issues concerned with websites and culture, trikonic analysis using the Peircean Category Theory has been used to analyse how trust is invoked in a user when using websites.{{According to whom|date=February 2016}}  It may be possible to use 1ns, 2ns and 3ns to categorise features of a website, for example the visual elements, colours or text used, layout, the content of the website, credibility, how the elements relate to the users actual purpose of using the website etc.{{Weasel inline|date=February 2016}}

One of the purposes of trikonic is to explore whether it can help to identify what elements of a website actually influence the user to perceive it to be credible or not.{{According to whom|date=February 2016}}

== Trikonic Analysis on the Interoperability of Conceptual Graph (CG) Tools ==
When approaching software problems like the interoperability of CG tools, it is often useful to look at a situation from a software engineering perspective to find a solution. However, with the use of trikonic it is possible to approach the software engineering problem in this way. Trikonic analysis is a very sophisticated method,{{Weasel inline|date=February 2016}} and as shown in the examples above it can be used in many different ways and scenarios. Again, using the notions of 1ns, 2ns and 3ns it may be possible to see how certain elements of the CG tools relate to each other in this way and produce a good solution from this.{{Weasel inline|date=February 2016}}

Examples of the three categories could be the programming language, the CG language and the architecture of the software. From this you could say, that:

“this CG language is a possibility” (1ns), “the programming language needs to be…” (2ns), “the architecture of the software is…” (3ns).

The right knee is bent and the right foot placed on the left inner thigh, or in half lotus position. In either foot placement, the hips should be open, with the right knee pointing towards the right, not forward. With the toes of the right foot pointing directly down, the left foot, center of the pelvis, shoulders and head are all [[vertical direction|vertically aligned]]. Hands are typically held above the head either pointed directly upwards and unclasped, or clasped together in [[anjali mudra]].

The asana is typically held for 20 to 60 seconds to stretch the spine, returning to tadasana while exhaling, then repeating standing on the opposite leg.{{sfn|Silva|Methta|1990|p=21}}

* strengthens  the ankles{{sfn|Hewitt|1983|p=35}}
* tones the muscles of the legs, back and chest{{sfn|Hewitt|1983|p=35}}

== Beginner's tip ==

Focus the gaze on a small specific point, known in yoga as a drishti. This is ideally something directly ahead which does not move. Engage the standing foot by lifting the arch and pressing down through the lateral edge. Check that weight is distributed through the ball of the large toe, the ball of the small toe, and the heel. Draw in the navel to improve core stability and posture. Faults include leaning to one side, twisting, pushing one hip out; bending or rotating the supporting knee outwards; looking downwards and lacking concentration.&lt;ref&gt;Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centre (1996) Yoga, Mind and Body (DK, London)&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

'''The White Panthers''' were a far-left, [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]], [[white American]] political collective founded in 1968 by [[Pun Plamondon]], [[Leni Sinclair]], and [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article5558140.ece|title=Obama's inauguration hailed by White Panther founder John Sinclair|accessdate=2009-01-21|date=January 21, 2009|newspaper=[[The Times]]|author=Kaya Burgess | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was started in response to an interview where [[Huey P. Newton]], co-founder of the [[Black Panther Party]], was asked what white people could do to support the Black Panthers. Newton replied that they could form a White Panther Party. The [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture era]] group took the name and dedicated its energies to "cultural revolution." John Sinclair made every effort to ensure that the White Panthers were not mistaken for a [[white supremacist]] group, responding to such claims with "quite the contrary." The party worked with many ethnic minority rights groups in the [[Rainbow Coalition (Fred Hampton)|Rainbow Coalition]].

== Michigan years ==
The group was most active in Detroit and [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] and included the [[proto-punk]] band [[MC5]] which John Sinclair managed for several years before he was incarcerated. From a general ideological perspective, Plamondon and Sinclair{{which|date=February 2016}} defined the White Panthers as "fighting for a clean planet and the freeing of political prisoners." The White Panthers added other elements such as advocating "rock 'n roll, dope, sex in the streets and the abolishing of capitalism." [[Yippie]] co-founder [[Abbie Hoffman]] praised the WPP in ''[[Steal This Book]]'' and [[Woodstock Nation (book)|''Woodstock Nation'']], and John Sinclair often referred to himself as a Yippie as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/mar/03/john-sinclair-rock-revolutionary-mc5-interview|title=John Sinclair: 'We wanted to kick ass – and raise consciousness'|website=The Guardian|author=O'Hagan, Sean|access-date=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/arts/article/13019737/yippie-yi-yay|title=Yippie Yi Yay|website=Washington City Paper|author=Tracey, Patrick|date=31 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group emerged from the Detroit Artists Workshop, a radical arts collective founded in 1964 near [[Wayne State University]]. Among its concerns was the legalization of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]; Sinclair{{which|date=February 2016}} had several arrests for possession. It aligned itself with radical politics, claiming the [[12th Street Riot]] was justifiable under political and economic conditions in Detroit.

Plamondon was indicted with John Sinclair in connection to the bombing of a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] office in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] on September 29, 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zbrozek|first=C|title=The bombing of the A2 CIA office|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/bombing-a2-cia-office|accessdate=2013-04-22|newspaper=Michigan Daily|date=2006-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salpukas|first=Agis|title=DETROIT RADICALS FACE BOMB TRIAL; Defense Challenges Jury System and Wiretapping|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/17/archives/detroit-radicals-face-bomb-trial-defense-challenges-jury-system-and.html|accessdate=2013-04-22|newspaper=New York Times|date=1971-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; a year after the founding of the group. Upon hearing on the left-wing alternative radio station [[WYCD#99½ WABX|WABX]] that he had been indicted, he fled the U.S. for Europe and Africa, spending time in [[Algeria]] with exiled Black Panther [[Eldridge Cleaver]]. After secretly re-entering the country, and on his way to a safe house in northern Michigan, he was arrested in a routine traffic stop, joining John Sinclair, who had been sentenced to nine and a half years in jail for violating Michigan's marijuana possession laws, in prison. Plamondon was convicted and was in prison when Sinclair was released on bond in 1971 while appeals were being heard on his case. Sinclair's unexpected release came two days after a large "Free John" benefit concert, with performances from [[John Lennon]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Bob Seger]], and [[Stevie Wonder]], was held at the [[University of Michigan]]'s [[Crisler Arena]].

== Legal reforms ==
The group had a direct role in two important legal decisions. A landmark [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in 1972 quashed Plamondon's conviction and destroyed the case against John Sinclair. The court ruled warrantless wiretapping was unlawful under the [[U.S. Constitution]], even in the case where national security, as defined by the executive branch, was in danger. The White Panthers had been charged with conspiring to destroy government property and evidence used to convict Plamondon was acquired through wiretaps not submitted to judicial approval. The case [[United States v. U.S. District Court|''U.S. vs. U.S. District Court (Plamondon et al.)'']], [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=407&amp;invol=297 407 U.S. 297], commonly known as the Keith Case, held that the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] shielded private speech from surveillance unless a warrant had been granted, and that the "warrant procedure would not frustrate the legitimate purposes of domestic security searches." The judgment freed Plamondon, yet John Sinclair was free only on bond fighting his possession conviction. In 1972, the [[Michigan Supreme Court]] ruled in the ''People v. Sinclair'', 387 Mich. 91, 194 N.W.2d 878 (1972) that Michigan's classification of marijuana was unconstitutional, in effect decriminalizing possession until a new law conforming to the ruling was passed by the [[Michigan Legislature]] a week later. Sinclair was freed but the cumulative effects of the imprisonment had marked the end of the White Panther Party in Michigan, which renamed itself the Rainbow People's Party while John Sinclair and Plamondon were in prison. The Rainbow People's Party, headquartered in Ann Arbor, disbanded in 1973.

== Related groups ==
The headquarters of the White Panthers in [[Portland, Oregon]] were raided by the [[FBI]] on December 5, 1970. Two members of the group were arrested and accused of throwing a [[molotov cocktail]] through the window of a local [[Selective Service]] office.&lt;!-- http://makemyday.free.fr/whitepanthers.htm --&gt;

Author and anarchist [[Mick Farren]], a leader of the [[United Kingdom Underground]], later founded the White Panthers, UK.

== The White Panther Statement ==
In November 1968, ''[[Fifth Estate (periodical)|Fifth Estate]]'' published the "White Panther State/meant". This [[manifesto]], emulating the Black Panthers, ended with a ten-point program:
#We want freedom. We want the power for all people to determine our own destinies.
#We want justice. We want an immediate and total end to all cultural and political repression of the people by the vicious pig power structure and their mad dog lackies the police, courts and military. We want the end of all police and military violence against the people all over the world right now!
#We want a free world economy based on the free exchange of energy and materials and the end of money.
#We want free access to all information media and to all technology for all the people.
#We want a free educational system, utilizing the best procedures and machinery our modern technology can produce, that will teach each man, woman and child on earth exactly what each needs to know to survive and grow into his or her full human potential.
#We want to free all structures from corporate rule and turn the buildings over to the people at once!
#We want free time and space for all humans—dissolve all unnatural boundaries!
#We want the freedom of all prisoners held in federal, state, county or city jails and prisons since the so-called legal system in Amerika makes it impossible for any man to obtain a fair and impartial trial by a jury of his peers.
#We want the freedom of all people who are held against their will in the conscripted armies of the oppressors throughout the world.
#We want free land, free food, free shelter, free clothing, free music, free medical care, free education, free media, EVERYTHING FREE FOR EVERYBODY!&lt;ref name=RevisedTen&gt;{{cite news|title=White Panthers Ten-Point Program|url=http://media.aadl.org/documents/pdf/aa_sun/aa_sun_19690728.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=Ann Arbor Sun|date=28 July 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ten-point program and "White Panther State/meant" were also published in the Ann Arbor Sun, which was a newspaper founded by John Sinclair in November 1968. The newspaper was originally called the Detroit Warren-Forrest Sun before it was changed to the Ann Arbor Sun when [[Trans-Love Energies (organization)|Trans-Love Energies]] moved to Ann Arbor in 1968.&lt;ref name="AASunH" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/papers/aa_sun|title=Ann Arbor Sun - Freeing John Sinclair|website=Freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization, founded by John Sinclair, his wife Leni Arndt Sinclair and artist Gary Grimshaw in 1967, set up shop at 1510 and 1520 Hill St, where the Ann Arbor Sun was produced and edited by the members of the group.&lt;ref name="JS museum exhibit"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/exhibits/sinclair/|work=The John and Leni Sinclair Papers, 1957–1999 at the Bentley Historical Library|accessdate=8 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519225834/http://bentley.umich.edu/exhibits/sinclair/|archivedate=May 19, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 28, 1969, the Ann Arbor Sun printed a revised copy of the White Panther's ten-point program.&lt;ref name=RevisedTen/&gt;

The newspaper was considered to be the mouthpiece for the White Panther Party for quite some time before the newspaper transitioned to an independent publication spreading views on local issues, left-wing politics, music, and arts.&lt;ref name="AASunH" /&gt; Finally in 1976, the publication of the Ann Arbor Sun was suspended indefinitely.

==Life==
Hanegraaff was raised as the son of a theologian.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1998|p=vii}} He originally studied [[classical guitar]] at the Municipal Conservatory at [[Zwolle]] from 1982 to 1987, and [[cultural history]] at the [[University of Utrecht]] from 1986 to 1990. From 1992 to 1996 he was a Research Fellow at the department for the Study of Religions at the University of Utrecht. From 1996 to 1999 Hanegraaff held a postdoctoral fellowship from the [http://www.nwo.nl/ Dutch Association for Scientific Research] (NWO), during which time he spent a period working in Paris. In 1999 he became professor of History of Hermetic Philosophy and Related Currents at the [[University of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="Universiteit van Amsterdam" /&gt; From 2002 to 2006 he has been president of the [http://www.godsdienstwetenschap.nl/ Dutch Society for the Study of Religion], and, from 2005 to 2013, president of the [http://www.esswe.org/ European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism]. In 2006 he was elected member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/members/7164 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131210527/https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/members/7164 |title=Wouter Hanegraaff |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |archive-date=31 January 2016 |accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he is now an hononrary member of the ESSWE.

==Works==
His dissertation ''New Age Religion and Western Culture: Esotericism in the Mirror of Secular Thought'' was published by [[Brill Publishers|Brill]] in 1996. Two years later a USA paperback version was published by State University of New York Press.  This work constitutes one of the first non-polemical academic reviews of the [[New Age]] movement, presenting an analysis on the basis of its important texts. It covers important authors, themes, aspects of New Age belief, and finally looks at the New Age in the context of traditional Western [[esotericism]].  It has helped pave the way for a number of further studies that have appeared in various journals, concerning the New Age phenomenon.

Hanegraaff's second book-length publication was ''Lodovico Lazzarelli (1447-1500): The Hermetic Writings and Related Documents'' (Tempe 2005; with Ruud M. Bouthoorn). Lazzarelli was treated by [[Frances A. Yates]] as a secondary figure, but the Hanegraaff-Bouthoorn book argues that Yates's "grand narrative" of the Hermetic Tradition needs to be revised. It seeks to restore Lazzarelli's place in the history of Renaissance hermetism and contains critical annotated editions and translations of Lazzarelli's hermetic writings, plus several related documents such as the previously unpublished biography of Lazzarelli by his brother, and texts by his spiritual master [[Giovanni da Correggio]].

Hanegraaff's small volume ''Swedenborg, Oetinger, Kant: Three Perspectives on the Secrets of Heaven'' (West Chester 2007), is an expanded version of the introduction he wrote for the New Century Edition of Swedenborg's "Arcana Coelestia". It analyzes Swedenborg's worldview as expounded in his main work, and discusses the early German reception history by Friedrich Christoph Oetinger and Immanuel Kant. Oetinger originally saw Swedenborg as an ally but eventually criticized his idealist philosophy as the antithesis of his own incarnational theosophy. Kant took Swedenborg much more seriously than is commonly assumed, and their basic ontological and epistemological perspectives are remarkably compatible.

Hanegraaff's second full-scale monograph ''Esotericism and the Academy: Rejected Knowledge in Western Culture'' was published by Cambridge University Press in 2012. It tells "the neglected story of how intellectuals since the Renaissance have tried to come to terms with a cluster of 'pagan' ideas from late antiquity that challenged the foundations of biblical religion and Greek rationality". "Expelled from the academy on the basis of Protestant and Enlightenment politics", Hanegraaff argues that "these traditions have come to be perceived as the Other by which academics define their identity to the present day". He argues that our common perspectives on Western intellectual and cultural history are based upon a highly selective "eclecticist" historiography grounded in Enlightenment ideologies.

One year later, Hanegraaff published an introductory textbook, ''Western Esotericism: A Guide for the Perplexed'' (Bloomsbury 2013). It gives a systematic overview of Western esotericism as a field of academic research, focusing on questions of definition and demarcation, main historical currents, polemical and apologetic discourse, worldviews, ideas about knowledge, and practices, as well as the impact of modernization and the interdisciplinarity of the field. The book ends with an annotated bibliography.

Apart from these books, Hanegraaff has published numerous articles in academic journals and collective volumes. He is the (co-)editor of seven volumes in the study of religion and Western esotericism, including the two-volume ''Dictionary of Gnosis and Western Esotericism'' (Brill: Leiden 2005), and "Hidden Intercourse: Eros and Sexuality in the History of Western Esotericism (with Jeffrey J. Kripal). He is a former (and founding) editor of ''Aries: Journal for the Study of Western Esotericism'' (now edited by Peter J. Forshaw) and the “Aries Book Series: Texts and  Studies in Western Esotericism” (now edited by Marco Pasi; both Brill). He is member of the editorial board of the journals ''[[Religion (journal)|Religion]]'', ''[[Numen (journal)|Numen]]'', ''[[Religion Compass (journal)|Religion Compass]]'' and ''[[Esoterica (journal)|Esoterica]]'', and is on the advisory board of ''[[Journal of Contemporary Religion]]'' and ''[[Nova Religio]]''.
