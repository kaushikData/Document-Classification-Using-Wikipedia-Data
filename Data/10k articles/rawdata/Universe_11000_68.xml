'''Alfred Robens, Baron Robens of Woldingham''', [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]] (18 December 1910 &amp;ndash; 27 June 1999), sometimes known as '''Alf Robens''', was an [[England|English]] [[trade union]]ist, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[politician]] and [[industrialist]]. His political ambitions, including an aspiration to become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], were frustrated by bad timing; but his energies were diverted into [[industry]]: he spent a decade as chair of the [[National Coal Board]], and later headed a major inquiry which resulted in the [[#Robens Report|Robens Report]] on [[occupational health and safety|health, safety and welfare]] at work. His outlook was [[paternalism|paternalistic]], but in later life, he moved away from his early [[socialism]] towards the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. His reputation remains tarnished by his failure to have foreseen and prevented the [[Aberfan disaster]], followed by actions widely regarded as insensitive during this disaster's aftermath.

==Early life==
Robens was born in [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]], [[Manchester]], the son of George Robens, a [[cotton]] [[salesman]] and Edith Robens (''née'' Anderton). He left school aged 15 to work as an errand boy, but his career truly began when he joined the Manchester and Salford Co-operative Society as a [[Clerk (position)|clerk]]; he became a director when he was 22, one of the first worker/directors in the country. He was an official in the [[USDAW|Union of Distributive and Allied Workers]] from 1935 to 1945; being certified medically unfit for military service in the [[Second World War]], he served as a [[Manchester City Council]]lor from 1941 to 1945. He married Eva Powell on 9 September 1936; the couple [[adoption|adopted]] a son, Alfred (born 1935).&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Tweedale (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Following the war, in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|dramatic Labour landslide victory of 1945]], Robens was elected [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the [[mining]] constituency of [[Wansbeck (UK Parliament constituency)|Wansbeck]] in [[Northumberland]]. He started on a sustained rise through the parliamentary ranks, serving in junior posts at the [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]] (1945–1947) and at the [[Ministry of Fuel and Power]] under [[Hugh Gaitskell]]. In 1950, following boundary changes, Robens moved to the new constituency of [[Blyth (UK Parliament constituency)|Blyth]], later [[Blyth Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Blyth Valley]]. He was briefly [[Minister of Labour and National Service]] in 1951, but the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|general election]] later that year.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

In [[Official Opposition (United Kingdom)|opposition]], Robens continued to rise in the party, being appointed [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] by [[Clement Attlee]] while [[Aneurin Bevan]] was indisposed, and he began to be considered as a future candidate for party leader. Robens himself "yearned to become Prime Minister".&lt;ref&gt;Robens (1972) ''p.''4&lt;/ref&gt; However, he failed to impress during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 because he had been briefed in confidence by the Conservative Prime Minister, [[Anthony Eden]], on the night before the invasion; sworn to secrecy, he was unable to oppose the invasion effectively in the debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. Furthermore, party leader Gaitskell felt him too [[left-wing]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} He was replaced as Shadow Foreign Secretary by Bevan, and felt that his political ambitions had been frustrated. Thus, when [[Harold Macmillan]] (Eden's successor as Prime Minister) offered Robens the chairmanship of the [[National Coal Board]] (NCB) in 1960, he accepted enthusiastically. Gaitskell died in January 1963. Geoffrey Tweedale, writing in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', has expressed the view that, had Robens persisted in politics, he, rather than [[Harold Wilson]], would likely have become Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; Indeed, [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]] (the runner-up to Wilson in the election to succeed Gaitskell) stated in his autobiography that had Robens been in Parliament he himself would not have opposed him, and even if he had, Robens would have defeated him.&lt;ref&gt;In My Way: The Political Memoirs of Lord George-Brown by George Brown'' p.''91-92&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Coal Board==
Robens took up his appointment at the NCB in 1961 at a salary believed to be £10,000 a year (which was never increased throughout his ten years in office) and was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Robens of Woldingham''', of [[Woldingham]] in the [[County of Surrey]], on 28 June.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=42401 |date=30 June 1961 |page=4841}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst those critical of this sudden elevation were his successor as MP for Blyth, [[Eddie Milne]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Robens' leadership of the NCB was high-handed. He expected unflinching loyalty from colleagues and subordinates alike, and was confrontational with politicians. He enjoyed the trappings of power including a [[Daimler-Benz|Daimler]] with the vehicle registration number "NCB 1" (although this had been a gift from an admirer which he had been reluctant to accept, and was only persuaded to do so to avoid hurting the feelings of the donor), an executive aeroplane (a six-seater [[De Havilland Dove]] which he and other Board members used to visit the far-flung coalfields) and a flat in Eaton Square (which was only a few hundred yards from the NCB Headquarters in Grosvenor Place and which had increased in value by the time it was sold after his retirement from the NCB). His behaviour earned him the nickname "Old King Coal", a [[pun]] on [[Old King Cole]]. However, he threw himself into the job with vigour and enthusiasm, visiting pits, arguing with miners at the coalface and developing a deep knowledge of the industry.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; In 1963 he was invited to deliver the [http://www.iesis.org/macmillan.html MacMillan Memorial Lecture] to the [[Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland]]. He chose the subject 'Coal - Its Place in the National Economy'.

As Chairman of the NCB, Robens oversaw substantial cuts in the mining industry, many of them reflecting [[market forces]] and government policies originated before he assumed the post. Although he lobbied to protect the industry, his reputation as a [[socialist]] necessarily suffered—when he took over as NCB chair there were 698 pits employing 583,000 miners, but by the time he left the post ten years later there were only 292 pits employing 283,000 miners. For a while Robens had a constructive working relationship with miners' leader [[Will Paynter]], but he had a combative relationship with the Wilson Labour government. [[Industrial relations]] deteriorated during his tenure,&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; and there was an [[UK miners' strike (1969)|unofficial strike in 1969]] that lost £15 million and 2.5 million tonnes of coal as a result of a walkout by 140 of the 307 NCB collieries.&lt;ref name=R59&gt;{{cite book |last=Routledge |first=Paul |date=1994 |title=Scargill: the unauthorized biography |location=London |publisher=Harper Collins |page=59 |isbn=0-00-638077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robens expressed concern at the poor [[occupational health and safety|health and safety]] record of the coal industry, and championed campaigns to reduce accidents and to counter chronic [[occupational disease]]s such as [[pneumoconiosis]]. Although the number of fatal and serious accidents fell by over 60% during his tenure, there was also a fall in the workforce of over 50%, from 583,000 to 283,000.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

===Aberfan disaster===
The largest single blow to his reputation came from his reaction to the catastrophic 1966 industrial accident at [[Aberfan]]. On the morning of 21 October, a massive [[Tailings|spoil heap]] from the nearby Merthyr Vale Colliery collapsed onto the village of Aberfan, burying 20 houses and the Pantglas Junior School in a landslide, thirty feet deep, of water-saturated slurry that killed 116 schoolchildren and 28 adults.

Despite the enormity of the disaster, Robens felt that he had no alternative but to go ahead with his installation as the first Chancellor of the new [[University of Surrey]] (which involved hundreds of people) before going to Aberfan, and he did not arrive until the evening of the Saturday following the day of the disaster, a blunder that was compounded by the actions of NCB staff, who falsely informed the [[Ministry of Power (United Kingdom)|Minister of Power]], [[Richard Marsh, Baron Marsh|Richard Marsh]], that Robens was at Aberfan. It was always his policy to send the most senior mining engineer to the scene of a disaster to coordinate rescue operations. Speaking to the media on the Sunday after the disaster, Robens was concerned that the initial shock and sorrow might give way to anger, possibly directed towards the men who worked at the top of the spoil heaps. To avoid this, he said that those men could not have foreseen what happened. A TV interview during which he made that comment proved to be unacceptable for broadcasting, owing to the atmospheric conditions; instead, the interviewer broadcast a paraphrase of the interview that wrongly made it seem that Robens had claimed that no one in the NCB could have foreseen the disaster. This was later taken by the Aberfan disaster enquiry to imply that the Board was contesting liability, notwithstanding the 19th-century case of ''[[Rylands v Fletcher]]'' which meant that the Board had absolute liability for damage caused by a 'dangerous escape' of material. Conversely, in a later interview Robens claimed that the disaster had been caused by "natural unknown springs" beneath the tip; but evidence emerged that the existence of these springs was common knowledge.

The report of the Davies Tribunal which inquired into the disaster was highly critical of the NCB and Robens. He had proposed to appear at the outset of the enquiry to admit the NCB's full responsibility for the disaster, but the Chairman of the Tribunal advised him that this would not be necessary. In the event, when it was clear that his earlier comments to reporters had been misinterpreted at the Tribunal as a denial of responsibility, he offered to appear at the enquiry to set the matter straight. He conceded that the NCB was at fault, an admission which would have rendered much of the inquiry unnecessary had it been made at the outset, notwithstanding the advice of Lord Edmund Davies that his appearance was not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukresilience.gov.uk/response/recovery_guidance/case_studies/g1_aberfan.aspx UK Resilience website - National Recovery Guidance - Case Studies: The Aberfan Disaster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119071740/http://www.ukresilience.gov.uk/response/recovery_guidance/case_studies/g1_aberfan.aspx |date=19 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the report was published in August 1967, Robens wrote to Marsh, the Minister of Power, offering his resignation; this was rejected by him and by Prime Minister Wilson, although several cabinet members argued strongly that Robens ought to be removed.

There have been allegations that the resignation offer was "bogus" and Robens had been assured that it would not be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;McLean (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ronald Dearing, Baron Dearing|Ronald Dearing]], then a part-time member of the NCB, Richard Marsh was advised that Robens was "taking the coal industry through a period of painful contraction without big strikes" and the strong support for him within the coal industry and the union movement were crucial to the decision to retain him. When Robens advised a meeting of the full Board that he had offered his resignation, there was surprise and consternation; [[Cecil Harmsworth King|Cecil King]], a part-time member of the Board, rose to his feet and told Robens that in doing so he had acted correctly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=102176&amp;sectioncode=26 "Aberfan aftermath, Sir Ron replies: 'I believe advice was disinterested and just' ", ''Times Higher Education Supplement'', 7 February 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the disaster, Robens was asked that the NCB should fund the removal of the remaining tips from Aberfan.  He was advised, however, that the cost of doing so would have obliged the NCB to exceed its borrowing limits, which had been set by the government. To incur that cost would, in effect, have broken the law. It was not that Robens refused to pay. He had acceded to a request from the bereaved mothers of Aberfan to meet them to hear their views, and he was received by them with courtesy. In the end, the cost was met partly by the Board and partly by the Government, with a contribution from the Aberfan Disaster Fund.

The Trustees of the Disaster Fund, which had been raised by public appeal, had been put under "intolerable pressure" to make a contribution of £150,000 (£2 million at 2016 prices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Consumer Price Inflation since 1750 |author=O‘Donoghue, J. |journal=Economic Trends |volume=604 |year=2004 |pages=38–46, March |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/article.asp?ID=726 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to cover the cost of removing the tips – an action that was "unquestionably unlawful" under charity law – and the [[Charity Commission]] took no action to protect the Fund from this dubious, indeed dishonest, misappropriation of funds.&lt;ref&gt;Jacint Jordana &amp; David Levi-Faur: ''The Politics of Regulation: Examining Regulatory Institutions and Instruments in the Age of Governance'' (Edward Elgar Publishing, 2004) {{ISBN|1-84376-464-4}}, {{ISBN|978-1-84376-464-9}}, pp.54-58&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no evidence that prosecution for [[corporate manslaughter (England and Wales)|corporate manslaughter]] was considered at the time.&lt;ref&gt;McLean &amp; Johnes (2000) ''p.''41&lt;/ref&gt; Robens was exonerated by the official history of the NCB&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; but he remains condemned in other quarters.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==Robens Report==
In 1969, Robens was selected by [[Barbara Castle]] to chair a committee on workplace health and safety. This led to the 1972 Robens Report which controversially championed the idea of self-regulation by employers. The Report itself led to the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]] and the creation of the [[Health and Safety Commission]] and the [[Health and Safety Executive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=The Times | date=13 February 1971 | page=19, col A | title=Factory safety Bill should await committee's report }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cullen (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Following the Conservative victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]], Robens found the new administration's distaste for [[nationalisation]] at odds with his own rather [[paternalism|paternalistic]] views. He fell into conflict with Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] and [[Department of Industry|Minister of State for Industry]] [[John Eden, Baron Eden of Winton|Sir John Eden]]. Robens left the NCB in 1971 but always insisted that his tenure was a success.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

Robens had become a director of the [[Bank of England]] in 1966&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; and a member of the [[board of directors]] of [[Times Newspapers]] in 1967.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} He was [[Chairman (official)#Corporate governance|Chairman]] of [[Vickers]] from 1971 to 1979, opposing the Labour plans for nationalisation that led to the [[Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977]]. He was Chairman of [[Johnson Matthey]] from 1971 to 1983, and a director of [[Trust House Forte]] and several other companies. His lifestyle was increasingly at odds with his socialist beginnings and by 1979, he had become aligned with the Conservative Party.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

He left public life in 1982, retiring with his wife to [[Laleham]] Abbey, once the home of [[John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan|The 7th Earl of Lucan]]. Robens suffered the first of two debilitating [[stroke]]s in 1992 and ultimately died in 1999 aged 88.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==In folk music==
Robens's period at the National Coal Board was mentioned in the folk songs of the period. Ed Pickford, who was a miner in the Durham Coalfield, was highly critical of Robens: his song ''The Pound a Week Rise'' criticises the low wages paid to coal miners during Robens's reign, and his song ''One Miner's Life'' refers to the widespread pit closures. [[Jock Purdon]], a miner who was made redundant on the closure of [[Harraton]] Colliery in Durham, wrote the song ''Farewell to Cotia'' about the migration of redundant miners across the country and particularly to [[Nottinghamshire]], which he referred to as "Robens's promised land".

'''Amrus Natalsya'''  (born 21 October 1933, [[Medan]], [[North Sumatra]]) - an Indonesian painter and wood sculpture artist.

== Life and creativity ==
After graduating from high school, he entered the Academy of Fine Arts of Indonesia in [[Yogyakarta]] in 1954. At the student exhibition at the Museum of Javanese Culture "Sono Budoyo" his wooden sculpture "A Forgotten Blind" was purchased by the president [[Soekarno]]. In the same year in [[Bandung]], he participated in an exhibition timed to the [[Bandung Conference|Bandung Conference of Asia and Africa]], where he exhibited his new wooden work “Unheard Cries”, which was praised by critics; the American art critic [[Claire Holt (art historian)|Claire Holt]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp; How amazing the artist presented the suffering and the struggle of the spirit at this exhibition. Amrus is the most original young sculptor with such quality works that you rarely see in other Indonesian artists. - &lt;ref&gt; Misbach Tamrin. Amrus Natalsya Wood Painting. Etty Mustafa Collection. Editor Misbach Tamrin, K.P. Hardi Danowijoyo. Jakarta: Rumah Budaya Hardi, 2014, p. 25 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In 1957, he held his first solo exhibition in [[Jakarta]], the first exhibition under the open sky in Indonesia. He presented his wooden sculptures up to four meters high. In 1959, [[Batara Lubis]] , the cartoonist A. Sibarani and him represented Indonesia at the International Youth Week in [[Vienna]], and on the way back they visited [[the Soviet Union]] and [[China]]. The following year he went to [[Jidda]] at the invitation of the mayor of the city to make a wooden panel with calligraphy. At the same time he performed [[Hajj]]. 

In 1960, at a student exhibition in Jakarta, he exhibited paintings on canvas, and again they attracted Soekarno’s attention: he bought the canvas "My friends" (1959). In 1961, together with other students ([[Misbach Tamrin]], [[Kuslan Budiman]], Adrianus Gumelar, and others) he created the ''Bumi Tarung'' art workshop in Jakarta &lt;ref&gt;[[Misbach Tamrin]]. Amrus Natalsya dan Bumi Tatung. Bogor: Amnat Studio. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bumi Tarung Perupa Lekra // "Tempo", 1 Oktober 2013&lt;/ref&gt;. At the same time he took part in the activities of [[Lembaga Kebudajaan Rakjat| the  People's Cultural Association]] (Lekra), which was under the auspices of the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]]&lt;ref&gt;The Journey of Indonesian Painting: The Bentara Budaya Collection. Jakarta: Bentara Budaya, 2008, h. 12&lt;/ref&gt;. 

After [[30 September Movement| the events of September 30, 1965]] he was arrested and held in jail without trial and investigation until 1973.

After his release from prison he worked in his workshop at the Anchol Arts Bazaar &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.tokohindonesia.com/biografi/article/285-ensiklopedi/691-pematung-kayu-yang-fenomenal TokohIndonesia.com - Ensiklopedi Tokoh Indonesia &lt;! - The header was added by the bot -&gt;] &lt;/ref&gt;. Here he mastered a new genre - pictures on the boards, which became very popular among collectors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} 

But he did not abandon his old passion for wooden sculpture - a series of sculptures "[[Noah's Ark]]" in 1998 at the exhibition in the Cultural Center of Jakarta was recognized as the best work of the exhibition and was acquired by the museum of the university "Pelita Harapan". As for the pictures on the boards, the most impressive series is "[[China Town]]", which he made under the influence of anti-Chinese pogroms in 1998 and exhibited in the prestigious Mon Monk Gallery (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Amir Sidharta. Chinatown. [Jakarta]: Galeri Mon Decor, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;. Later, another solo exhibition was held in this gallery (2004) and the Canna gallery (2005). The most significant collection of his paintings and sculptures belongs to the Indonesian collector Etti Mustafa, who has been collecting his works since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Misbach Tamrin.

Standard '''battery nomenclature''' describes portable [[dry cell]] batteries that have physical dimensions and electrical characteristics interchangeable between manufacturers.  The long history of disposable dry cells means that many different manufacturer-specific and national standards were used to designate sizes, long before international standards were reached. Technical standards for battery sizes and types are set by [[standards organization]]s such as [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) and [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI).  Popular sizes are still referred to by old standard or manufacturer designations, and some non-systematic designations have been included in current international standards due to wide use.

The complete nomenclature for the battery will fully specify the size, chemistry, terminal arrangements and special characteristics of a battery.  The same physically interchangeable cell size may have widely different characteristics; physical interchangeability is not the sole factor in substitution of batteries.

National standards for dry cell batteries have been developed by [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]], [[Japanese Industrial Standards|JIS]], [[British Standards|British national standards]],  and others. Civilian, commercial, government and military standards all exist. Two of the most prevalent standards currently in use are the IEC 60086 series and the ANSI C18.1 series. Both standards give dimensions, standard performance characteristics, and safety information.

Modern standards contain both systematic names for cell types that give information on the composition and approximate size of the cells, as well as arbitrary numeric codes for cell size.

==History of the IEC standard==
The [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) was established in [[France]] in 1906 and co-ordinates development of standards for a wide range of electrical products. The IEC maintains two committees, TC21 established in 1933 for rechargeable batteries, and TC35 established in 1948 for primary batteries, to develop  standards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iec.ch/about/history/techline/ retrieved 12 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The current designation system was adopted in 1992. Battery types are designated with a letter/number sequence indicating number of cells, cell chemistry, cell shape, dimensions, and special characteristics. Certain cell designations from earlier revisions of the standard have been retained.&lt;ref name=Linden2002&gt;David Linden, Thomas B. Reddy (ed). ''Handbook Of Batteries 3rd Edition'', McGraw-Hill, New York, 2002 {{ISBN|0-07-135978-8}} chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The first IEC standards for battery sizes were issued in 1957.&lt;ref name=barak80&gt;M. Barak '' Electrochemical power sources: primary and secondary batteries'', IET, 1980 {{ISBN|0-906048-26-5}}, page 51&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 1992, [[International standard]] IEC 60086 defines an alphanumeric coding system for batteries.&lt;ref name=Linden2002/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Roy Crompton, ''Battery reference book'',Newnes, 2000 {{ISBN|0-7506-4625-X}}, Appendix 2&lt;/ref&gt;
British standard 397 for primary batteries was withdrawn and replaced by the IEC standard in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shop.bsigroup.com/en/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000000196342 British Standards ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the ANSI standard==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2013}}
Standardization of batteries in the [[United States]] started in 1919, when the US [[National Bureau of Standards]] published recommended test procedures and standard dimensions of cells.&lt;ref name=ANSIC182002&gt;Ron Runkles (ed) ''A Brief History of the Standardization of Portable Cells and Batteries in the United States'', American National Standards Institute Accredited Standards Committee C18 on Portable Cells and Batteries, 2002 , [http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120802183313/http://www.swe.com/admin/FILES/ANSI%20Battery%20Standardization%20History.pdf ANSI Battery Standardization History] . Retrieved 2010 Jan 9.&lt;/ref&gt; American standards were revised several times during the following decades, as new sizes of cells were introduced and new chemistry developed, including chloride, alkaline, mercury and rechargeable types.

The first American Standards Association (predecessor to [[ANSI]]) standard C18 appeared in 1928. It listed cell sizes using a letter code, roughly in order of size from smallest (A) to larger types. The only numerical designation was the 6-inch tall "No. 6" cell. The 1934 edition of the C18 standard expanded the nomenclature system to include series and parallel arrays of cells. In 1954, mercury batteries were included in the standard. The 1959 edition identified types suitable for use with [[transistor radio]]s. In 1967, [[NEMA]] took over responsibility for development from the [[National Bureau of Standards]]. The 12th edition of C18 began to be [[harmonisation of law|harmonized]] with the IEC standard.  Rechargeable batteries were introduced in the C18 standard in 1984, and lithium types were standardized in 1991.

In 1999 the ANSI standards were extensively revised and separate safety standards provided. The current edition of the ANSI standards designates sizes with an arbitrary number, with a prefix letter to designate shape,  and with a suffix letter or letters to identify different chemistry, terminals, or other features.

==IEC battery nomenclature==
Three different [[List of IEC technical committees|technical committees of IEC]] make standards on batteries: TC21([[Lead–acid battery|lead-acid]]), SC21(other [[Secondary battery|secondary]]) and TC35([[Primary battery|primary]]). Each group has published standards relating to the nomenclature of batteries - IEC 60095 for lead-acid [[Starter battery|starter batteries]], IEC 61951-1 and 61951-2 for [[Ni-Cd]] and [[Ni-MH]] batteries, IEC 61960 for [[Li-Ion|Li-ion]], and IEC 60086-1 for primary batteries.

===Primary batteries===

====&lt;span id="IEC 60086"&gt;Battery numbering====
[[File:IEC-60086--battery-code.svg|350px|thumb|IEC 60086 battery type designation system.]]

Examples of the IEC nomenclature are batteries coded R20, 4R25X, 4LR25-2, 6F22, 6P222/162, CR17345 and LR2616J. The letters and numbers in the code indicate the number of cells, cell chemistry, shape, dimensions, the number of parallel paths in the assembled battery and any modifying letters deemed necessary. A multi-section battery (two or more voltages from the same package) will have a multi-section designation.

Prior to October 1990, round cells were designated with a sequential numeric size code ranging from R06 through to R70, for example R20 is the size of a "D" cell or ANSI"13" size. After October 1990, round cells are systematically identified with a number derived from their diameter and height. Primary cells larger than 100&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter or height are designated with an oblique "/" between diameter and height.

====Electrochemical system====
The first letter identifies the chemical composition of the battery, which also implies a nominal voltage.

It is common to refer to the negative electrode first in IEC battery definitions.

''Italics'' indicate a chemical system unlikely to be found in consumer or general-purpose batteries, or withdrawn from the current standard.

====Shape====
[[File:LR44 Button Cell Battery IEC Standard Version.jpg|240px|thumb|[[LR44 battery|LR44]] alkaline cell.]]

Shape codes are:
:R Round, (coin, button or cylindrical)
:P Not round
:''F Flat (layer built)''
:''S Square (or rectangular or prismatic)''

The ''F'' and ''S'' shape codes are still in use but are not to be used for new battery definitions.

====Size code====
Certain sizes, given by one or two digit numbers, represent standard size codes from previous editions of the standard. Sizes given as 4 or more digits indicate the diameter of the battery and the overall height.

The numbers in the code correlate with the battery dimensions. For batteries with dimensions of &lt; 100&amp;nbsp;mm the (truncated) diameter in millimetres, followed by the height in tenths of a millimetre; for batteries with a single dimension ≥ 100&amp;nbsp;mm the diameter in millimetres, then a slash (/) followed by the height in millimetres.

As well as the recommended size code definitions there are also ten modifying suffix letters that can be added to the end of the specific size code. These run from A to L (omitting F and I) and depending on the largest dimension of the battery can either signify 0.0 – 0.9&amp;nbsp;mm maximum dimensions or 0.00 – 0.09&amp;nbsp;mm maximum dimensions with A being 0.0 or 0.00 and L being 0.9 or 0.09.

For flat cells the diameter code is given as the diameter of a circle circumscribed around the whole cell's area.

Standardized size codes for round batteries which do not follow the current nomenclature but have been retained for ease of use are given by a one or two digit number following the R. These include but are not limited to:
&lt;ref&gt;A more complete table is found in the current IEC standard (Table C.1 Annex C) or in Barak 1980 page 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Round button batteries also carry two-digit size codes such as R44, see the [[List of battery sizes#Silver oxide and alkaline cells|button battery table]] for typical dimensions. Other round, flat, and square sizes have been standardized but are used mostly for components of multi-cell batteries.

[[File:Button cells and 9v cells (3).png|thumb|right|300px|Assorted sizes of button and coin cells, including [[alkaline]] and [[silver oxide]] chemistries. Four rectangular 9v batteries are also shown, for size comparison. Enlarge to see the button and coin cell size code markings.]]

====Modifiers====
After the package size code(s), additional letters may optionally appear. Terminal styles and variants of the same battery can be designated with the letters X or Y. Performance levels may also be designated with a C, P, S, CF, HH, or HB or other letter suffixes.
An appended letter "W" states that this battery complies with all the requirements of the IEC 60086-3 standard for watch batteries, such as dimensional tolerance, chemical leakage, and test methods.

====Battery categories====
IEC nomenclature classifies batteries according to their general shape and overall physical appearance. These categories, however, are not identified in the IEC battery nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;As indicated in IEC 60086-2 §7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;All information is correct to the current version (2011) of IEC 60086 (Parts 1 to 3). As of Thursday 9 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Category 1''': Cylindrical cells with protruding positive and recessed or flat negative terminals. The positive terminal shall be concentric with the cell overall. The total height of the cell is not necessarily the same as the total distance between terminals (This accounts for nubs, recesses and battery casings). The cell casing is insulated. ''E.g. R1 &amp; LR8D425''
*'''Category 2''': Cylindrical cells with protruding positive and protruding or flat negative terminals. The total height of the cell is the same as the total distance between terminals. The cell casing is insulated. ''E.g. CR14250, LR61''
*'''Category 3''': Cylindrical cells with flat positive and negative terminals. The total height of the cell is not necessarily the same as the total distance between terminals (This accounts for any protuberances from the negative terminal). The cell casing is in connection with the positive terminal. No part of the cell is allowed to protrude from the positive terminal surface. ''E.g. CR11108, LR9''
*'''Category 4''': Cylindrical cells with a protruding flat negative terminal. The total height of the cell is the same as the total distance between terminals. The cell casing is the positive terminal and it is recommended that the outer surface is used for positive connection even though it is possible from the base. No part of the cell is allowed to protrude from the positive terminal surface. ''E.g. LR44, CR2032''
*'''Category 5''': Cylindrical batteries which fit none of the other categories. ''E.g. R40, 8LR23''
*'''Category 6''': Non-cylindrical batteries. ''E.g. 3R12, 4R25, 6F22''

===Secondary batteries===

====&lt;span id="IEC 61951"&gt; Nickel-cadmium and nickel-metal hydride batteries ====
Nickel-cadmium and Nickel-metal hydride batteries follow a similar rule as the system above;&lt;ref&gt;IEC61951-1 ed2.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IEC 61951-2 ed2.0&lt;/ref&gt; especially cylindrical cells designed to be dimensionally interchangeable with primary batteries use the same designation as the primary batteries, the codes for electrochemical systems as below.

All other cells use the following system.
  
*'''Small prismatic cells''': KF or HF followed by maximum width in mm / maximum thickness in mm / maximum height in mm. E.g. KF 18/07/49
*'''Cylindrical cells''': KR or HR followed by a letter indicating discharge rate (L, H, M or X for low, medium, high and very high, respectively); then another letter may be added to indicate use at elevated temperatures (T or U) or rapid charge (R); then maximum diameter in mm / maximum height in mm. E.g. KRL 33/62, HRHR 23/43
*'''Button cells''': KB or HB followed by maximum diameter in tenths of mm / maximum height in tenths of mm. E.g. KBL 116/055

====&lt;span id="IEC 61960"&gt; Lithium-ion batteries ====
[[File:IEC-61960 lithium battery codes.svg|350px|thumb|IEC 61960 battery type designation system.]]

Lithium-ion batteries have a different rule for naming, which applies both to batteries of multiple cells and single cell. They will be designated as:&lt;ref&gt;IEC 61960 ed1.0&lt;/ref&gt;

N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;

where N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; denotes number of series connected cells and N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; denotes number of parallel connected cells (only when the number is greater than 1); these numbers only apply to batteries.

A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; indicates the basis of negative electrode phase, where I is for lithium ion and L is for lithium metal or alloy.

A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; indicates the basis of positive electrode phase, and could be C, N, M, V or T for cobalt, nickel, manganese, vanadium and titanium respectively.

A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is for the shape of the cell; either R for cylinder and P for prism.

N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum diameter (in case of cylindrical cells) or thickness (prismatic cells) in mm.

N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is only used for prismatic cells to denote the maximum width in mm.

N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum overall height in mm.

(For any of the lengths above, if the dimension is smaller than 1&amp;nbsp;mm it can be written as tN, where N is tenths of mm)

E.g. ICR19/66, ICPt9/35/48, 2ICP20/34/70, 1ICP20/68/70-2

==ANSI battery nomenclature==
Early editions of the ANSI standard used a letter code to identify the dimensions of the cell. Since at the time there were only carbon-zinc cells, no suffix letters or other notation were required. The letter system was introduced in the 1924 edition of the standard, with letters A through J assigned approximately in order of increasing cell volume, for cells typically manufactured at that time.&lt;ref name=ANSIC182002 /&gt; By 1934, the system had been revised and extended to 17 sizes ranging from NS at {{frac|7|16}}&amp;nbsp;inch diameter by {{frac|3|4}}&amp;nbsp;inch height, through size J at {{frac|1|3|4}}&amp;nbsp;inches diameter by {{frac|5|7|8}}&amp;nbsp;inches high, to the largest standard cell which retained its old designation of No. 6 and which was {{frac|2|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter and 6&amp;nbsp;inches high. &lt;!--Think carefully about SI equivalents, because they would have been and are irrelevant to the purposes of the standard. --&gt;

===Size and shape codes===
[[File:Batteries comparison 4,5 D C AA AAA AAAA A23 9V CR2032 LR44 matchstick-1.jpeg|thumb|right|4.5-Volt, D, C, AA, AAA, AAAA, A23, 9-Volt, CR2032 and LR44 cells.]]

The current edition of the standard uses a numerical code to show the cell size. Common round cell sizes are:
{| class=wikitable
|+ANSI primary cell sizes and equivalent size designations
!Number&lt;br&gt;code!!Other name!!IEC size
!Example
|-
|13||[[D battery|D]]||R20
|
|-
|14||[[C battery|C]]||R14
|
|-
|15||[[AA battery|AA]]||R6

|-
|25||[[AAAA battery|AAAA]]||R8D425
|
|}
Since these IEC and ANSI battery standards have been harmonized, for example, an R20 cell will have the same dimensions as an ANSI 13 cell.

Flat cells, used as components of multi-cell batteries, have an F prefix and a series of numbers to identify sizes.
Coin cells were assigned size codes in the 5000 range.

Secondary cells using systems H and K (nickel-metal hydride and nickel-iron sulfide) have a separate series of size codes, but the cells are dimensionally interchangeable with primary cells.

The '''Brazil nut''' ('''''Bertholletia excelsa''''') is a South American tree in the family [[Lecythidaceae]], and also the name of the tree's commercially harvested edible seeds.

== Order ==
The Brazil nut family is in the order [[Ericales]], as are other well-known plants such as blueberries, cranberries, [[sapote]], [[gutta-percha]], tea, [[phlox]] and [[persimmon]]s.

== Brazil nut tree ==
[[File:Bertholletia excelsa.jpg|thumbnail|Tree branch]]
The Brazil nut tree is the only species in the [[monotypic]] genus ''Bertholletia''. It is native to the [[Guianas]], [[Venezuela]], [[Brazil]], eastern [[Colombia]], eastern [[Peru]], and eastern [[Bolivia]]. It occurs as scattered trees in large forests on the banks of the [[Amazon River]], [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]], [[Tapajós]], and the [[Orinoco]]. The genus is named after the French chemist [[Claude Louis Berthollet]].

The Brazil nut is a large tree, reaching {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall and with a trunk {{convert|1|to|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, making it among the largest of trees in the [[Amazon rainforest]]s. It may live for 500 years or more, and according to some authorities often reaches an age of 1,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvesting nuts, improving lives in Brazil|url=http://www.assets.wwf.no/news_facts/newsroom/features/index.cfm?uNewsID=92320|publisher=World Wildlife Fund|author=Bruno Taitson |date=January 18, 2007 |accessdate=July 17, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523200535/http://www.assets.wwf.no/news_facts/newsroom/features/index.cfm?uNewsID=92320|archivedate=May 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stem is straight and commonly without branches for well over half the tree's height, with a large emergent crown of long branches above the surrounding canopy of other trees.

The bark is grayish and smooth. The leaves are dry-season [[deciduous]], alternate, simple, entire or crenate, oblong, {{convert|20|–|35|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|10|–|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} broad. The flowers are small, greenish-white, in [[panicles]] {{convert|5|–|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; each flower has a two-parted, deciduous [[Calyx (botany)|calyx]], six unequal cream-colored petals, and numerous [[stamen]]s united into a broad, hood-shaped mass.

=== Hazards ===
In Brazil, it is illegal to cut down a Brazil nut tree.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} As a result, they can be found outside production areas, in the backyards of homes and near roads and streets. The fruits are very heavy and rigid; when the fruits fall, they pose a serious threat to vehicles and people passing under the tree. Brazil nut fruits sink in fresh water, which can cause clogging of waterways in [[Riparian zone|riparian areas]].

==Reproduction==
[[Image:Brazil nut DSC05477.JPG|thumb|left|A freshly cut Brazil nut fruit]]
Brazil nut trees produce fruit almost exclusively in pristine forests, as disturbed forests lack the large-bodied bees of the genera ''[[Bombus]]'', ''[[Centris]]'', ''[[Epicharis (bee)|Epicharis]]'', ''[[Eulaema]]'', and ''[[Xylocopa]]'' which are the only ones capable of [[pollinate|pollinating]] the tree's flowers, with different bee genera being the primary pollinators in different areas, and different times of year.&lt;ref name=Nelson1985&gt;{{cite journal

The fruit takes 14 months to mature after pollination of the flowers. The fruit itself is a large capsule {{convert|10|–|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, resembling a coconut [[endocarp]] in size and weighing up to {{convert|2|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. It has a hard, woody shell {{convert|8|–|12|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, which contains eight to 24 triangular seeds {{convert|4|–|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long (the "Brazil nuts") packed like the segments of an orange.

The capsule contains a small hole at one end, which enables large rodents like the [[agouti]] to gnaw it open. They then eat some of the seeds inside while burying others for later use; some of these are able to germinate into new Brazil nut trees. Most of the seeds are "planted" by the agoutis in shady places, and the young saplings may have to wait years, in a state of dormancy, for a tree to fall and sunlight to reach it, when it starts growing again. [[Capuchin monkey]]s have been reported to open Brazil nuts using a stone as an [[anvil]].

Despite their name, the most significant exporter of Brazil nuts is not Brazil but Bolivia, where they are called {{lang|es|castañas de Brasil|italic=yes}} or {{lang|es|nuez de Brasil|italic=yes}}. In Brazil, these nuts are called {{lang|pt|castanhas-do-pará|italic=yes}} (literally "chestnuts from [[Pará]]"), but [[Acre (state)|Acreans]] call them {{lang|pt|castanhas-do-acre|italic=yes}} instead. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]] names include ''juvia'' in the Orinoco area.  In [[Cuba]], the nut is alternatively called {{lang|es|coquito de Santiago|italic=yes}}, literally ''St. James coconut''.

In the past in North America, Brazil nuts were sometimes known by the epithet "[[nigger]] toes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=W.

==Nut production==
In 2014, global production of Brazil nuts (in shell) was 95,000 [[tonne]]s, remaining a consistent annual total since 2009.&lt;ref name="index"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexbox.co.uk/news/Globalization-on-the-Brazil-Nut-Market/|title=Brazil Nut Market - Globalization on the Brazil Nut Market|author=Kosikova, Daria|date=July 21, 2016|publisher=IndexBox|accessdate=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest producers were [[Bolivia]] (47% of world total) and [[Brazil]] (40%), and the United States was the largest importer, with 9% of the world production volume.&lt;ref name=index/&gt;

===Effects of harvesting===
Brazil nuts for international trade can come from wild collection rather than from plantations. This has been advanced as a model for generating income from a [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical forest]] without destroying it. The nuts are gathered by migrant workers known as ''castanheiros''.

Analysis of tree ages in areas that are harvested show that moderate and intense gathering takes so many seeds that not enough are left to replace older trees as they die. Sites with light gathering activities had many young trees, while sites with intense gathering practices had hardly any young trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Silvertown | first1 = J. | title = Sustainability in a nutshell | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2004.03.022 | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages =  276–278| year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistical tests were done to determine what environmental factors could be contributing to the lack of younger trees. The most consistent effect was found to be the level of gathering activity at a particular site. A [[Computer simulation|computer model]] predicting the size of trees where people picked all the nuts matched the tree size data gathered from physical sites that had heavy harvesting.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Nutritionally, Brazil nuts are an excellent source (&gt; 19% of the [[Daily Value]], DV) of [[dietary fiber]] (30% DV) and various [[vitamins]] and [[dietary minerals]]. A 100 gram amount (75% of one [[cup (unit)|cup]]) of Brazil nuts contains rich content of [[thiamin]] (54% DV), [[vitamin E]] (38% DV), [[magnesium]] (106% DV), [[phosphorus]] (104% DV), [[manganese]] (57% DV) and [[zinc]] (43% DV) (right table).

The [[European Union]] has imposed strict regulations on the import from Brazil of Brazil nuts in their shells, as the shells have been found to contain high levels of [[aflatoxin]]s, which can lead to liver cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission Decision of July 4, 2003 imposing special conditions on the import of Brazil nuts in shell originating in or consigned from Brazil|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:168:0033:0038:EN:PDF|work=Official Journal of the European Union |date=July 5, 2012 |accessdate=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil nuts contain small amounts of [[radium]], a [[radioactivity|radioactive]] element, in about 1–7 nCi/kg or 40–260 [[Becquerel|Bq]]/kg, about 1000 times higher than in several other common foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/natural.htm|title=Radioactivity in Nature|publisher=Idaho State University|accessdate=December 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Oak Ridge Associated Universities]], this is not because of elevated levels of radium in the soil, but due to "the very extensive root system of the tree."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazil Nuts|url=http://www.orau.org/PTP/collection/consumer%20products/brazilnuts.htm|publisher=Oak Ridge Associated Universities |date=January 20, 2009 |accessdate=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil nuts are a common ingredient in [[mixed nuts]]. Because of their large size, they tend to rise to the top upon forced vibrations likely encountered during transport, an example of [[granular convection]], which for this reason is often called the "Brazil nut effect."

As well as its food use, Brazil nut oil is also used as a lubricant in clocks, for making artists' paints, and in the cosmetics industry. Engravings in Brazil nut shells were supposedly used as decorative jewelry by the indigenous tribes in Bolivia, although no examples still exist. Because of its hardness, the Brazil nut's shell is often pulverized and used as an abrasive to polish materials such as metals and even ceramics (in the same way [[jeweler's rouge]] is used).

===Wood===

The lumber from Brazil nut trees (not to be confused with [[Brazilwood]]) is of excellent quality, but logging the trees is prohibited by law in all three producing countries (Brazil, Bolivia and Peru). Illegal extraction of timber and land clearances present a continuing threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greenpeace Activists Trapped by Loggers in Amazon|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/activists-trapped-by-loggers071018/|publisher=Greenpeace|date=October 18, 2007|accessdate=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brian G. Wowk''', Ph.D. is a [[medical physicist]] and [[cryobiology|cryobiologist]] known for the discovery and development of synthetic
[[molecules]] that mimic the activity of natural [[antifreeze protein]]s in [[cryopreservation]] applications, sometimes called "ice blockers".  As a senior scientist at [[Twenty-First Century Medicine|21st Century Medicine, Inc.]], he was a co-developer with [[Greg Fahy]] of key technologies enabling [[cryopreservation]] of large and complex [[biological tissue|tissue]]s, including the first successful [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] and [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] of a [[mammal]]ian [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] ([[kidney]]).

Wowk is also known for early theoretical work on future applications of [[molecular nanotechnology]], especially [[cryonics]], [[nanomedicine]], and [[optics]].  In the early 1990s he wrote that [[nanotechnology]] would revolutionize optics, making possible [[virtual reality]] display systems optically indistinguishable from real scenery as in the fictitious [[Holodeck]] of ''[[Star Trek]]''.  These systems were described by Wowk in the chapter "Phased Array Optics" in the 1996 anthology ''Nanotechnology: Molecular Speculations on Global Abundance'' {{ref|Note1}}, and highlighted in the September 1998 ''Technology Watch'' section of [[Popular Mechanics]] magazine.

He obtained his undergraduate and graduate degrees from the [[University of Manitoba]] in [[Winnipeg]], Canada.  His graduate studies included work in online portal [[Medical imaging|imaging]] for [[radiotherapy]] at the Manitoba Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation (now Cancer Care Manitoba), and work on artifact reduction for [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] at the [[National Research Council of Canada]].  His work in the latter field is cited by several text books, including
''Functional&amp;nbsp;MRI''{{ref|Note2}} which includes an image he obtained of [[magnetic field]] changes inside the human body caused by [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]].

'''Cadmium telluride''' (CdTe) is a stable [[crystal]]line [[Chemical compound|compound]] formed from [[cadmium]] and [[tellurium]]. It is mainly used as  the [[semiconducting material]] in [[cadmium telluride photovoltaics]] and an [[infrared]] [[optical window]]. It is usually sandwiched with [[cadmium sulfide]] to form a [[p-n junction]] solar PV cell. Typically, CdTe PV cells use a [[P-i-n and n-i-p#n-i-p|n-i-p]] structure.

== Applications ==

{{See also|Cadmium telluride photovoltaics}}

CdTe is used to make [[thin film solar cell]]s, accounting for about 8% of all solar cells installed in 2011.&lt;ref name="Fraunhofer Institute"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/de/downloads/pdf-files/aktuelles/photovoltaics-report.pdf|title=Photovoltaics report|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105154721/http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/de/downloads/pdf-files/aktuelles/photovoltaics-report.pdf|archivedate=2012-11-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are among the lowest-cost types of solar cell,&lt;ref&gt;''Chalcogenide Photovoltaics: Physics, Technologies, and Thin Film Devices'' by Scheer and Schock, page 6. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9783527633708.ch1/pdf Link (subscription required)]. "Nowadays, CdTe modules are produced on the GWp/year level and currently are the cost leader in the photovoltaic industry."&lt;/ref&gt; although a comparison of total installed cost depends on installation size and many other factors, and has changed rapidly from year to year. The CdTe solar cell market is dominated by [[First Solar]]. In 2011, around 2 [[Watt-peak|GW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;]] of CdTe solar cells were produced;&lt;ref name="Fraunhofer Institute"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/de/downloads/pdf-files/aktuelles/photovoltaics-report.pdf|title=Photovoltaics report|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105154721/http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/de/downloads/pdf-files/aktuelles/photovoltaics-report.pdf|archivedate=2012-11-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more details and discussion see [[cadmium telluride photovoltaics]].

CdTe can be [[alloy]]ed with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] to make a versatile [[infrared detector]] material ([[Mercury(II) cadmium(II) telluride|HgCdTe]]). CdTe alloyed with a small amount of [[zinc]] makes an excellent solid-state [[X-ray]] and [[gamma ray]] detector ([[cadmium zinc telluride|CdZnTe]]).

CdTe is used as an [[infrared]] optical material for [[optical window]]s and [[lens (optics)|lenses]] and is proven to provide a good performance across a wide range of temperatures.&lt;ref name="University of Reading"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/infrared/library/infraredmaterials|title=Cadmium Telluride}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early form of CdTe for IR use was marketed under the trademarked name of ''Irtran-6'' but this is obsolete.

CdTe is also applied for [[electro-optic modulator]]s. It has the greatest electro-optic coefficient of the linear [[electro-optic effect]] among II-VI compound crystals (r&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt;=r&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;=r&lt;sub&gt;63&lt;/sub&gt;=6.8×10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; m/V).

CdTe doped with [[chlorine]] is used as a radiation detector for x-rays, gamma rays, [[beta particle]]s and [[alpha particle]]s. CdTe can operate at room temperature allowing the construction of compact detectors for a wide variety of applications in nuclear spectroscopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Properties of Narrow-Gap Cadmium-Based Compounds| author = P. Capper | publisher = INSPEC, IEE| location= London, UK| year = 1994| isbn=0-85296-880-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The properties that make CdTe superior for the realization of high performance gamma- and x-ray detectors are high atomic number, large bandgap and high electron mobility ~1100&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/V·s, which result in high intrinsic μτ (mobility-lifetime) product and therefore high degree of charge collection and excellent spectral resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Characterization of M-π-n CdTe pixel detectors coupled to HEXITEC readout chip|publisher=IOP Journal of Instrumentation | doi=10.1088/1748-0221/7/01/C01035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the poor charge transport properties of holes, ~100&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/V·s, single-carrier-sensing detector geometries are used to produce high resolution spectroscopy; these include coplanar grids, frish-collar detectors and [[HEXITEC|small pixel]] detectors.

=== Optical and electronic properties ===

[[Image:CdTe PlasmaChem spectra.PNG|thumb|350px|left|Fluorescence spectra of colloidal CdTe quantum dots of various sizes, increasing approximately from 2 to 20 nm from left to right. The blue shift of fluorescence is due to [[Potential well|quantum confinement]].]]

Bulk CdTe is [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] in the [[infrared]], from close to its band gap energy (1.5 eV at 300 K,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=J. Phys. Chem. Sol. |authors=G. Fonthal |title=Temperature dependence of the band gap energy of crystalline CdTe|doi=10.1016/s0022-3697(99)00254-1|volume=61 |pages=579–583 |year=2000|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponds to infrared wavelength of about 830&amp;nbsp;nm) out to [[wavelength]]s greater than 20&amp;nbsp;µm; correspondingly, CdTe is [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] at 790&amp;nbsp;nm. As the size of CdTe crystals are reduced to a few nanometers or less, thus making them CdTe [[quantum dot]]s, the fluorescence peak shifts through the visible range into the ultraviolet.

== Chemical properties ==

CdTe is [[insoluble]] in water.&lt;ref name=foot11&gt;Solubility is below 0.1mg/l which equals a classification as insoluble- reference, "ECHA Substance Registration"[http://apps.echa.europa.eu/registered/data/dossiers/DISS-dffb4072-e283-47ae-e044-00144f67d031/DISS-dffb4072-e283-47ae-e044-00144f67d031_DISS-dffb4072-e283-47ae-e044-00144f67d031.html]&lt;/ref&gt; CdTe has a high melting point of 1041&amp;nbsp;°C with evaporation starting at 1050&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="ECHA Substance Registration"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadmium Telluride|url=http://apps.echa.europa.eu/registered/data/dossiers/DISS-dffb4072-e283-47ae-e044-00144f67d031/DISS-dffb4072-e283-47ae-e044-00144f67d031_DISS-dffb4072-e283-47ae-e044-00144f67d031.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; CdTe has a vapor pressure of zero at ambient temperatures. CdTe is more stable than its parent compounds cadmium and tellurium and most other Cd compounds, due to its high melting point and insolubility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.co.imperial.ca.us/icpds/eir/campo-verde-solar/final/evaluating-toxicity.pdf |format=pdf |title=Evaluating the read-across approach on CdTe toxicity for CdTe photovoltaics |author= S. Kaczmar |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cadmium telluride is commercially available as a powder, or as crystals. It can be made into nanocrystals.

== Toxicology assessment==

The compound CdTe has different qualities than the two elements, cadmium and tellurium, taken separately. Toxicity studies show that CdTe is less toxic than elemental cadmium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= ftp://ftp.co.imperial.ca.us/icpds/eir/campo-verde-solar/final/evaluating-toxicity.pdf |title= Evaluating the read-across approach on CdTe toxicity for CdTe photovoltaics |author= S. Kaczmar |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; CdTe has low acute inhalation, oral, and aquatic toxicity, and is negative in the Ames mutagenicity test. Based on notification of these results to the [[European Chemicals Agency]] (ECHA), CdTe is no longer classified as harmful if ingested nor harmful in contact with skin, and the toxicity classification to aquatic life has been reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.csp.fraunhofer.de/presse-und-veranstaltungen/details/id/47/ |title= Scientific Comment of Fraunhofer to Life Cycle Assessement of CdTe Photovoltaics |publisher= Fraunhofer Center for Silicon Photovoltaics CSP |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131213174834/http://www.csp.fraunhofer.de/presse-und-veranstaltungen/details/id/47/ |archivedate= 2013-12-13 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once properly and securely captured and encapsulated, CdTe used in manufacturing processes may be rendered harmless.  Current CdTe modules pass the U.S. EPA’s Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) test, designed to assess the potential for long-term leaching of products disposed in landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy03osti/33561.pdf |format=PDF |title=CdTe PV: Real and Perceived EHS Risks |authors=V. Fthenakis and K. Zweibel |publisher= National Renewable Energy Laboratory |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A document hosted by the U.S. National Institutes of Health&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ntp-server.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/htdocs/Chem_Background/ExSumPdf/CdTe_508.pdf |format=PDF |title=Nomination of Cadmium Telluride to the National Toxicology Program |publisher=United States Department of Health and Human Services |date=2003-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; dated 2003 discloses that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE) are
nominating Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) for inclusion in the National Toxicology Program (NTP). This nomination is strongly supported by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and [[First Solar]] Inc. The material has the potential for widespread applications in photovoltaic energy generation that will involve extensive human interfaces. Hence, we consider that a definitive toxicological study of the effects of long-term exposure to CdTe is a necessity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy's [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] have found that large-scale use of CdTe PV modules does not present any risks to health and the environment, and recycling{{clarify|date=December 2013}} the modules at the end of their useful life completely resolves any environmental concerns.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} During their operation, these modules do not produce any pollutants, and, furthermore, by displacing fossil fuels, they offer great environmental benefits. CdTe PV modules that use cadmium as a raw material appear to be more environmentally friendly than all other current uses of Cd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fthenakis|first=V. M.|title=Life Cycle Impact Analysis of Cadmium in CdTe PV Production|journal=Renewable &amp; Sustainable Energy Reviews|year=2004|volume=8|issue=4|pages=303–334}}&lt;/ref&gt; CdTe PV provides a sustainable solution to a potential oversupply of cadmium in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/matsuno/files/FS%20Review%20Report%20English.pdf |title=Scientific Review on the Environmental and Health Safety (EHS) aspects of CdTe photovoltaic (PV) systems over their entire life cycle |authors=Dr. Y.

== Availability ==

At the present time, the price of the raw materials [[cadmium]] and [[tellurium]] are a negligible proportion of the cost of CdTe solar cells and other CdTe devices. However, tellurium is a relatively rare element (1–5 parts per billion in the Earth's crust; see [[Abundances of the elements (data page)]]). Through improved material efficiency and increased PV recycling systems, the CdTe PV industry has the potential to fully rely on tellurium from recycled end-of-life modules by 2038.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344912001644|authors=M.

Another study shows that CdTe PV recycling will add a significant secondary resource of Te which, in conjunction with improved material utilization, will enable a cumulative capacity of about 2 TW by 2050 and 10 TW by the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fthenakis | first1 = V.M. | year = 2012 | title = Sustainability metrics for extending thin-film photovoltaics to terawatt levels | url = | journal = MRS Bulletin | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 425–430 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technology''' (CREST) is a research centre into [[renewable energy]] based in the Department of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University in England.

==Profile==
Established in 1993, it is recognised internationally as a centre of excellence in its field particularly in photovoltaic systems, materials and devices, wind power and integration of renewable energy into electricity grids. About fifty researchers, academics and associated staff are involved with CREST's work.

The MSc course in Renewable Energy Systems Technology, developed at CREST, is one of the longest established renewable energy masters courses globally.  It is producing a stream of graduates who are working internationally in all aspects of the renewables industry. This course can be studied full-time or part-time distance learning. As an advanced technology course, the modules in the CREST [[Master of Science|MSc]] include biomass, wind, solar, water/marine and electrical integration. There is a strong emphasis on electrical generation throughout.

==History==
The centre was initially set up through the funding of Professor Tony Marmont of Beacon Energy Beacon Energy, who remains a mentor and advisory committee member. Other advisory members include Sir [[Jonathon Porritt]] and Dr Andrew Garrad of Garrad Hassan &amp; Partners Ltd. Professor Phil Eames is the Director of CREST and Leon Freris is a Visiting Professor. Professor Freris, and Dr David Sharpe, a leading British wind turbine aerodynamicist who also worked at the centre, were founding members of the British Wind Energy Association (now [[RenewableUK]]). David Sharpe has since become known for his work as the inventor of the [[Aerogenerator]].

==Associations==
The Masters course is one of only sixteen programmes in the UK admitted to the [[Panasonic Corporation|Panasonic]] Fellowship programme &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raeng.org.uk/education/professional/panasonic/fellowships.htm ''Panasonic Trust Fellowship'' ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220055/http://www.raeng.org.uk/education/professional/panasonic/fellowships.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (run by the Royal Academy of Engineering). The Panasonic Fellowship programme is aimed at recent graduates who wish to embark on a full-time master's degree course in environmental studies or sustainable development.

CREST is a participating university in the EUREC European Masters Program in Renewable Energy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.master.eurec.be ''European Masters Course'']&lt;/ref&gt; an initiative supported by the European Commission to expand the European renewable energy industry.

The '''Cost competitiveness of fuel sources''' is a measure of whether or not particular fuel sources are  '''[[cost]] competitive''' in the [[energy market]], and is a primary factor in determining if a fuel source will be utilized. If a fuel source can be produced and sold lower than the price [[crude oil]] is being traded at, including taxes, then it is considered to be a ''cost competitive'' fuel source.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

{{Update|date=March 2017}}
[[File:DEAP3600.jpg|thumb|DEAP-3600 detector during construction in 2014]]
'''DEAP'''  ('''Dark Matter Experiment using Argon Pulse-shape''') is a direct [[dark matter]] search experiment using liquid [[argon]] as target material. DEAP utilizes background discrimination based on the characteristic [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] pulse-shape in argon. A first-generation detector (DEAP-1) with a 7&amp;nbsp;kg target mass operated at [[Queen's University]] to test the available pulse-shape discrimination at low recoil energies in liquid argon, and was moved to [[SNOLAB]] in October 2007 and ran into 2011. Discrimination of beta and gamma events from nuclear recoils in the energy region of interest (near 20 keV of electron energy) is required to be better than 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; to sufficiently suppress backgrounds in the DEAP-1 detector.

DEAP-3600 with 3600&amp;nbsp;kg of active mass is planned for operation beginning in mid 2015, with sensitivity to [[Weakly interacting massive particle|WIMP]]-nucleon scattering cross-sections as low as 10&lt;sup&gt;−46&lt;/sup&gt; cm² at 100&amp;nbsp;GeV.

A later 50 ton-scale detector (DEAP-50T) is planned.

== Scintillation properties and background suppression ==
Elastic scattering of a WIMP in argon is expected to cause a nuclear recoil.
In order to uncover the faint signature of an interacting dark matter particle, the detector is sensitive to low energy interactions, and as such, the signal from the WIMP interaction is hidden within a large collection of events. These events are known as background events. The WIMP signal must be uniquely filtered from these events.
In DEAP, as the light output is characteristic to the type of event, be it either a nuclear recoil event or a beta or gamma event, the interaction of each event can be uniquely determined. This is done by finding the ratio of prompt light (&lt;100ns) to late light (&lt;15us) in any given pulse. This ratio is known as Fprompt. Nuclear recoil events have a high Fprompt (~3.0) while beta/gamma events have a low Fprompt (~0.3). Since the interaction (elastic scattering) of WIMPs is expected to cause a nuclear recoil event, low Fprompt events such as gamma interactions can be considered as noise and cut from the data.&lt;ref name=Boulay2004&gt;{{cite arxiv |arxiv=astro-ph/0411358 |title=Direct WIMP Detection Using Scintillation Time Discrimination in Liquid Argon. |author=Boulay et al. |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The largest potential background in DEAP-1 is from the beta decay of Argon-39 which has an activity of approximately 1 Bq/kg in natural argon."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snolab.ca/deap1/ DEAP-1 website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== DEAP-1 ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:deap open.jpg|thumb|DEAP-1 detector inner chamber]] --&gt;
The first stage of the DEAP project, DEAP-1, was designed in order to characterize several properties of liquid argon, demonstrate the pulse-shape discrimination of liquid argon and refine engineering.  It was too small to perform a meaningful dark matter search.
DEAP-1 utilizes 7&amp;nbsp;kg of liquid argon as a target for WIMP interactions. Two [[photomultiplier]] tubes are used to detect the scintillation light produced by a particle interacting with the argon. As the scintillation light produced is of short wavelength (128&amp;nbsp;nm) a wavelength shifting film is used to broaden the wavelength so that it falls within the visible spectrum (440&amp;nbsp;nm) enabling it to pass through ordinary windows without any losses and be detected by the PMTs.

DEAP-1 demonstrated good pulse-shape discrimination of backgrounds on the surface and began operation in SNOLAB. The deep underground location reduces unwanted [[Cosmogenic#Natural|cosmogenic]] signals ("background"). It ran from 2007 to 2011 (including two changes in the setup).  DEAP-1 characterized the background, determining design improvements needed in DEAP-3600.&lt;ref name=DEAP-2014/&gt;

==DEAP-3600==

The second generation DEAP-3600 detector uses 3600&amp;nbsp;kg of liquid argon, of which 1000&amp;nbsp;kg is the fiducial volume, and the rest is for self-shielding and background veto.  This is contained in a spherical acrylic tank surrounded by 255 photomultiplier tubes and many layers of radiation shielding. Projected sensitivity to WIMP cross-section is 10&lt;sup&gt;−46&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 100 GeV after three years of data taking.&lt;ref name=DEAP-2014/&gt;

A large, international collaboration from Canadian and UK universities and laboratories are jointly working toward a large tonne-scale detector. The collaboration benefits largely from the experience many of the members and institutions gained on the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory|SNO]] project, which detects [[neutrinos]], another [[Weak Interaction|weakly interacting particle]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Deap at snolab.JPG|thumb|DEAP-1 shielding frame being assembled at SNOLAB.]] --&gt;Collaborators are from [[Queen's University]], [[Carleton University]], [[SNOLAB]], [[Laurentian University]], [[TRIUMF]], [[University of Alberta]], [[Royal Holloway University of London]], [[University of Sussex]], [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]], [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] and  most recently [http://www.cnl.ca/en/home/default.aspx Canadian Nuclear Laboratories Ltd.].

=== Status ===
"PMT system has been operational since the end of 2014 and is being calibrated with light sources. ...  Inner wavelength shifter was deposited on the acrylic vessel in June 2015".&lt;ref&gt;[http://deap3600.ca/ See : Current Status of DEAP-3600. Nov 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

The DEAP-3600 detector started taking commissioning data in February 2015 with nitrogen gas purge in the detector.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}  The detector fill was completed and data-taking was started on August 5, 2016.&lt;ref name="FIRST_DATA"&gt;{{cite arxiv|arxiv=1707.08042|title=First results from the DEAP-3600 dark matter search with argon at SNOLAB|author=P.-A. Amaudruz et al.|date=1 Aug 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the initial fill of the detector with liquid argon, a butyl O-ring seal failed on 17 Aug 2016 and contaminated the argon with 100 ppm of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|arxiv=1712.01982|title=Design and Construction of the DEAP-3600 Dark Matter Detector|author=P.-A. Amaudruz et al.|date=7 Dec 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The detector was then vented and re-filled, but this time to a level of 3300&amp;nbsp;kg to avoid a re-occurrence of the seal failure, with the second fill completed in Nov 2016.  The first results with an exposure of 4.44 live days from the initial fill were published on 1 Aug 2017, giving a cross-section limit of 1.2×10&lt;sup&gt;−44&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for a 100 GeV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; WIMP mass.&lt;ref name="FIRST_DATA"/&gt;

==DEAP-50T==
DEAP-50T is the planned expansion with 50 tons of depleted argon, with a sensitivity of 10&lt;sup&gt;−48&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=DEAP-2014&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv = 1410.7673|title = DEAP-3600 Dark Matter Search|last = |first = |date = 27 Oct 2014|journal = International Conference on High Energy Physics (ICHEP 2014)|doi = |pmid = |bibcode = 2014arXiv1410.7673D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6473">'''Docosapentaenoic acid''' ('''DPA''') designates any straight chain 22:5 [[fatty acid]], that is a straight chain [[open chain]] type of [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]] (PUFA) which contains 22 carbons and 5 [[double bond]]s. DPA is primarily used to designate two [[isomer]]s, ''all''-''cis''-4,7,10,13,16-docosapentaenoic acid (i.e. 4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z''-docosapentaenoic acid) and ''all''-''cis''-7,10,13,16,19-docosapentaenoic acid (i.e. 7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-docosapentaenoic acid). They are also commonly termed n-6 DPA and n-3 DPA, respectively; these designations describes the position of the double bond being 6 or 3 carbons closest to the (omega) carbon at the methyl end of the molecule and is based on the biologically important difference that n-6 and n-3 PUFA are separate PUFA classes, i.e. the [[omega-6 fatty acid]]s and [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s, respectively. Mammals, including humans, can not interconvert these two classes and therefore must obtain dietary essential PUFA fatty acids from both classes in order to maintain normal health (see [[essential fatty acid]]s).&lt;ref name="pmid18769551"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edwards IJ, O'Flaherty JT | title = Omega-3 Fatty Acids and PPARgamma in Cancer | journal = PPAR Research | volume = 2008 | issue = | pages = 358052 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18769551 | pmc = 2526161 | doi = 10.1155/2008/358052 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25339684"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spector AA, Kim HY | title = Discovery of essential fatty acids | journal = Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–21 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25339684 | pmc = 4274059 | doi = 10.1194/jlr.R055095 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

n-6 DPA is an [[omega-6 fatty acid|&amp;omega;-6 fatty acid]] with the trivial name '''osbond acid'''. It is formed by the stepwise elongation and desaturation of [[arachidonic acid]] i.e. 5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid (5,8,11,14-20:4n-6) to the 24 carbon PUFA intermediate (i.e. 6,9,12,15,18:24-5n-6) and the retro-conversion of this intermediate to DPAn-6 as follows:&lt;ref name="pmid10903473"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sprecher H | title = Metabolism of highly unsaturated n-3 and n-6 fatty acids | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1486 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 219–31 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10903473 | doi = 10.1016/s1388-1981(00)00077-9| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

n-3 DPA is an n-3 fatty acid with the trivial name '''clupanodonic acid'''. It is an intermediary between [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA, 5,8,11,14,17-20:5n-3) and [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA, 22:6 ω-3) in the following stepwise pathway in which DPAn-3 is a precursor to DHA (6,9,12,15,18,21:24:6n-3) and the final product, 4,7,10,13,16,19-22:6n-3, can be retro-converted to DPAn-3:&lt;ref name="pmid18769551"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10419080"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spector AA | title = ssentiality of fatty acids | journal = Lipids | volume = 34 Suppl | issue = | pages = S1–3 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10419080 | doi = 10.1007/bf02562220| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mammalian cells, including human cells, metabolize DPAn-3 to an array of products that are members of the [[specialized proresolving mediators]] class of PUFA metabolites. These metabolites include seven resolvins Ds (RvT1, RvT2, RvT3, RvT4, RvD1&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt;, RvD2&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt;, and RvD5&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt;; see [[specialized proresolving mediators#n-3 DPA-derived resolvins]] and [[Resolvin]]); two protectins (PD1&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt; and PD2&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt;; see [[specialized proresolving mediators#n-3 DPA-derived protectins/neuroprotectins]] and [[neuroprotectin]]); and three maresins (MaR1&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt;,  MaR2&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt;,and MaR3&lt;sub&gt;n-3&lt;/sub&gt;l see [[specialized proresolving mediators#n-3 DPA-derived maresins]] and [[maresin]].

'''''Ecological Genetics''''' is a 1964 book by the British biologist [[E. B. Ford]] on [[ecological genetics]]. Ford founded the field and it is considered his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''. The fourth and final [[edition (book)|edition]] was published in 1975.

Ford's work was celebrated in 1971 by ''Ecological Genetics and Evolution'', a series of essays edited by Robert Creed, publ. Blackwell, Oxford. This included contributions from [[Cyril Darlington]], [[Miriam Rothschild]], [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], [[Bryan Clarke]], [[A.J. Cain]], Sir [[Cyril Clarke]] and others.

Ford and [[Ronald Fisher]] represented one side of a dispute with the American [[Sewall Wright]] over the relative roles of [[natural selection|selection]] and [[Genetic drift|drift]] in [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evolutionary Genetics|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evolutionary-genetics/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=January 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Epixenosomes''', also known as '''[[Candidatus]] ''Epixenosoma''''' are a genus of [[bacteria]] in the phylum [[Verrucomicrobia]] that form a [[symbiosis]] with marine [[ciliate]]s of the genus ''[[Euplotidium]]'', where they help to defend their ciliate hosts against predators.  It is a [[Monotypic taxon|monospecific]] genus, containing only the species '''Ca. ''Epixenosoma ejectans'''''.

==Description==
Epixenosomes possess two distinct developmental phases linked to the host cell cycle. Stage I epixenosomes are spherical, 0.5 μm in diameter and are surrounded by two [[Cell membrane|membranes]]. They divide by direct binary [[Fission (biology)|fission]]. Stage II epixenosomes are egg-shaped (2.2 μm in length and 1 μm in width) and show complex organization with different [[cytoplasm]]ic compartments, more complicated than the majority of [[prokaryotic]] organisms. They contain an extrusive apparatus within a [[protein]]aceous matrix, although apparently not membrane-bound, which differs from the remaining [[cytoplasm]]. A functional cell compartmentalization has also been evidenced.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosati|first=G.|date=1999|title=Epixenosomes: symbionts of the hypotrich ciliate ''Euplotidium itoi''|url=|journal=Symbiosis|volume=26|pages=1–23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their [[phylogenetic]] position was originally unclear, because they appeared to have both prokaryote-like traits, such as binary fission, and [[eukaryote]]-like traits, such as intracellular membranes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, [[molecular phylogenetics]] showed that they are actually bacteria from the phylum [[Verrucomicrobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petroni|first=Giulio|last2=Spring|first2=Stefan|last3=Schleifer|first3=Karl-Heinz|last4=Verni|first4=Franco|last5=Rosati|first5=Giovanna|date=2000-02-15|title=Defensive extrusive ectosymbionts of ''Euplotidium'' (Ciliophora) that contain microtubule-like structures are bacteria related to Verrucomicrobia|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/97/4/1813|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=97|issue=4|pages=1813–1817|doi=10.1073/pnas.030438197|issn=0027-8424|pmid=10660683|pmc=26518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defensive symbiosis with ''Euplotidium''==
Epixenosomes live on the [[Dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] surface of their hosts, marine ciliates in the genus ''Euplotidium''. The name "epixenosomes" comes from the ancient Greek {{lang|el|επι ξενον σομα}}, meaning "external alien body", referring to their extracellular position on the host. The extrusive apparatus ejects its contents when triggered; this process helps to defend the ciliate host against [[Predation|predators]]. Although ''Euplotidium'' can grow and reproduce without epixenosomes, those with epixenosomes have much higher survival when exposed to predators such as the ciliate ''[[Litonotus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosati|first=Giovanna|last2=Petroni|first2=Giulio|last3=Quochi|first3=Silvia|last4=Modeo|first4=Letizia|last5=Verni|first5=Franco|date=1999-05-01|title=Epixenosomes: Peculiar Epibionts of the Hypotrich Ciliate Euplotidium Itoi Defend Their Host Against Predators|journal=Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology|language=en|volume=46|issue=3|pages=278–282|doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.1999.tb05125.x|issn=1550-7408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

External signals of unknown origin are detected by the membrane receptors located at the top of the organism. The consequent activation of the [[adenylate cyclase]]-[[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] system triggers the ejection of the extrusive apparatus, with the formation of a hollow tube, about 40 μm long, terminating in a head mainly consisting of the apical portion of the epixenosome (the region containing [[DNA]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The extrusive apparatus is surrounded by a basket of tubules. Experiments with [[antitubulin]] drugs and [[Immunocytochemistry|immunocytochemical]] analyses at the optical and electron microscopical level suggested that these tubules consist of [[tubulin]], which is a [[eukaryotic]] [[protein]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although some free-living Verrucomicrobia are reported to have tubulin genes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jenkins|first=Cheryl|last2=Samudrala|first2=Ram|last3=Anderson|first3=Iain|last4=Hedlund|first4=Brian P.|last5=Petroni|first5=Giulio|last6=Michailova|first6=Natasha|last7=Pinel|first7=Nicolas|last8=Overbeek|first8=Ross|last9=Rosati|first9=Giovanna|date=2002-12-24|title=Genes for the cytoskeletal protein tubulin in the bacterial genus Prosthecobacter|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=99|issue=26|pages=17049–17054|doi=10.1073/pnas.012516899|issn=0027-8424|pmid=12486237|pmc=139267}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have not been found to have tubular structures like those of epixenosomes.

[[Flying Tiger Line|Flying Tiger]] Flight 282 refers to the crash of a [[Lockheed Constellation]] aircraft, N6915C, shortly after take-off from [[San Francisco International Airport]] in the early morning hours of Thursday, December 24, 1964.

On Wednesday, December 23, 1964, '''Flying Tiger Line Flight 282''' arrived at San Francisco International Airport from [[Japan]]. Filled with a cargo of electronic equipment, bolts of fabric, women's scarves, bandannas, purses, and costume jewelry for the Christmas holiday, the craft was refueled and departed just after midnight with a crew of three, {{convert|41000|lb}} of cargo, {{convert|136|lb}} of mail, and 5,000 gallons of high-octane aviation fuel.

The weather was that of heavy fog and rain. A large [[cold front|cold frontal system]] was moving onshore, and on the north coast of California heavy flooding was destroying homes. A [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] helicopter had already been lost in these conditions.

Leaving just after midnight on December 24 from Runway 28, going northwest from the bay, flight 282 planned to head out over the ocean to circle and gain altitude, then travel east toward its destination of [[JFK International Airport]] in [[New York City]]. Shortly after takeoff, however, the plane veered to the left of its planned course. The pilot, Jabez A. Richards, 49, of Bayhead, New Jersey, asked the tower for permission to change his radio setting from takeoff to departure frequency. With him were Daniel W. Hennessy, 33, of Hillsborough, California, as co-pilot, and Paul M. Entz, 37, of North Hollywood, California, as flight engineer. Seconds later, the plane vanished from the tower's radar scope.

The "Super Connie" crashed near the top of Sweeney Ridge in [[San Bruno, California|San Bruno]], very close to the site of a Coast Guard radio station. All three crew members aboard were killed. No one on the ground was killed or injured.

The [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] determined that the probable cause of the accident was that the pilot, for undetermined reasons, deviated from departure course into an area of rising terrain, where downdraft activity and turbulence affected the ability of the craft to climb.

The '''Ford Expedition''' is a [[Full-size car|Full-size]] [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]] manufactured by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. Introduced for the 1997 model year as the successor of the [[Ford Bronco]], the Expedition was the first full-size Ford SUV sold with a four-door body. For its entire production life, the Ford Expedition has been derived from the corresponding generation of the Ford F-150 in production, sharing some body and mechanical components.  The fourth-generation Ford Expedition began production for the 2018 model year.  Similar to the configuration of the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] and [[Chevrolet Suburban|Suburban]], the Ford Expedition is sold in regular and extended lengths (the Ford Expedition EL/Max); sold since 2007, the latter functionally serves as the replacement for the [[Ford Excursion]].

Since 1997, the Lincoln division has marketed the Ford Expedition as the [[Lincoln Navigator]], the first full-size SUV sold by a luxury auto brand in North America (the Expedition was never sold as a [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]]).  The third Ford vehicle to use the Expedition nameplate, the full-size SUV follows a 1992 F-150 Eddie Bauer concept vehicle and a 1995 trim level package on the two-door [[Ford Explorer Sport]].

Prior to 2009, the Ford Expedition was assembled at the [[Michigan Assembly Plant]] in [[Wayne, Michigan]] (previously home to the Ford Bronco)., After 2009, the Ford Expedition was moved to the [[Kentucky Truck Assembly|Kentucky Truck Plant]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].

==Vehicle background==
The Expedition offered up to nine-passenger seating in model years before 2009 (with a front bench seat option in the first row); 2009–present has bucket seats in the first row and seats eight passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Expedition Review|url= http://www.edmunds.com/ford/expedition/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is equipped with a [[V8 engine]]. It is similar to the [[Lincoln Navigator]], especially in ''Limited'' (2005–present) or ''King Ranch'' (2005–2017) high-end trims; both of which were introduced for the 2005 model year. With the 2011 model year, the base model was designated XL, an upgraded XLT, and new for 2011 XLT Premium that replaced the [[Eddie Bauer]] trim  (1997–2010) which was phased out from the entire Ford vehicle lineup. As of 2010, over 1,545,241 Expeditions (both standard and EL/Max) have been sold. A modified ''Special Service Vehicle'' version is available for [[law enforcement agencies]], [[Firefighting worldwide|fire departments]], and [[emergency medical services]].

The Ford Expedition is also known for being one of the longest-lasting vehicles on the road. With 5% of vehicles over 200K miles, it landed the #4 spot in a 2016 study by [[iSeeCars.com]] listing the top 10 longest-lasting vehicles. The Expedition is also the last current Ford vehicle to retain its classic older look from the late 1990s and early-mid 2000s Ford vehicles with its triangular-styled taillamps and rounded-rectangular shaped headlamps along with the overall boxy shape of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.iseecars.com/2016/03/03/longest-lasting-vehicles-2016/ |title=Longest Lasting Vehicles Over 200,000 Miles – 2016 Study Shows Top 10 Consists of Mostly Trucks and SUVs |website=Blog.iseecars.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known internally at Ford as the UN93, the first generation Expedition was developed under the UN93 program from 1993 to 1996, headed by chief engineer Dale Claudepierre at a cost of $1.3 billion USD. Initial planning began in 1991 parallel to PN96 F-Series development, prior to the UN93 program fully being approved in 1993. Styling approval was completed in early 1993 (3 1/2 years ahead of 1996 production) under design chief Bob Aikins, with the UN93 design being frozen by September 1993, at 34 months prior to July 1996 production commencement.&lt;ref name="planedge.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planedge.com/forecasting/engineexcerpt.pdf |title=4100 engmy report1 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2003/2003_expedition.html |title=Ford Truck Enthusiasts - Expedition Overview |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Connelly|first1=Mary|title=FORD'S EXPEDITION TAKES ON TAHOE, SEEKS CONQUEST SALES|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/19960513/ANA/605130761/fords-expedition-takes-on-tahoe-seeks-conquest-sales|website=Automotive News|publisher=Crain Communications|accessdate=8 February 2017|date=13 May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Has A Bigger Idea: The Expedition|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-05-16/topic/9605140728_1_expedition-ford-motor-ford-explorer|website=Orlando Sentinel|publisher=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=8 February 2017|date=16 May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Connelly|first1=Mary|title=DANA COMES TO FORD'S AID FOR HOT-SELLING BIG TRUCKS|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/19960805/ANA/608050750?template=print|website=Automotive News|publisher=Crain Communications|accessdate=8 February 2017|date=5 August 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Dale-Claudepierre/23106674 |title=Dale Claudepierre &amp;#124; Formerly Ford Compact Utilities |website=ZoomInfo.com |date=1947-12-09 |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The all-new full-size SUV was unveiled on May 9, 1996 and launched on October 2, 1996 as a 1997 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Truett|first1=Richard|title=Ford's Big New Baby|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-10-03/topic/9610011147_1_expedition-land-rover-range-rover|website=Orlando Sentinel|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=8 February 2017|date=3 October 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rewey|first1=Bob|title=Ford Reports October U.S. Car and Truck Sales|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/press/date/19971104/press007737.html|website=The Auto Channel|publisher=Ford Motor Company|accessdate=8 February 2017|date=4 November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; It replaced the aging two-door [[Ford Bronco]]. The ''XLT'' was the base model. The Expedition featured optional three row seating, first row captains chair seating, available second row captains chair seating, leather seating surfaces, illuminated running boards, heated side view mirrors, power [[moon roof]], dual zone climate control and Ford's Mach audio sound system with rear [[subwoofer]]. Many of these features were standard on the ''[[Eddie Bauer]]'' version.

Expedition was available with automatic full-time [[Control Trac|ControlTrac]] four-wheel drive with two-speed dual range BorgWarner 4406 [[transfer case]] and a center [[Electromagnetic clutch|multi-disc differential]]. ControlTrac was introduced in 1995 and included four selectable modes: Two High, Auto, Four High (lock) and Four Low (lock). Two High mode and Auto mode with ''auto-lock'' was not available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/automotive/motor-vehicle-models-sport-utilitys/7273668-1.html]{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A short- &amp; long-arm (SLA) independent front suspension with speed-sensitive power-assisted steering was combined with a multi-link rear [[live axle]]. Optional equipment included off-road under-body skid-plate protection, ''Traction-Lok'' rear [[limited-slip differential]], and a heavy-duty trailer towing package.

Optional was an electronically controlled [[pneumatic]] [[air suspension]] system that would raise and lower the vehicle depending on road and load conditions. The system also included a kneel-down mode for easier ingress and egress, as well as loading cargo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2001_expedition.html |title=Ford Truck Enthusiasts - 2001 Expedition Overview |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard was the 4.6 liter Triton V8 with the 5.4 liter version optional.

The redesigned second-generation Expedition was developed under the U222 program code name from 1996 to 2002, under Ford chief vehicle engineer Steve von Foerster and chief program engineer [[John Krafcik]] from 1998 to 2002.&lt;ref name="planedge.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/frankquenneville |title=Frank Quenneville |publisher=LinkedIn |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design work began in 1997, with a proposal by Tyler Blake being chosen by management and frozen for production in 1999. UN93-body mules were spotted testing in 2000, with full prototypes running from late 2000. The new Expedition was unveiled at the 2002 [[North American International Auto Show]], in January. It was launched in May 2002 for the 2003 model year&lt;ref name="http"/&gt; and featured a new four-wheel independent [[Long travel suspension|long-travel]] suspension system, becoming the first [[full-size]]  sport utility vehicle to use a fully independent suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Tyler-Blake/211249436 |title=Tyler Blake &amp;#124; Ford Motor Company |publisher=ZoomInfo.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall |first=Bob |url=http://www.thecarconnection.com/review/1003712_2003-ford-expedition |title=2003 Ford Expedition Page 1 Review |publisher=The Car Connection |date=2002-04-29 |accessdate=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new [[independent rear suspension]] (IRS) was perceived as being controversial by some at the time of its introduction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autofieldguide.com/driven/0402dri04.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511231955/http://www.autofieldguide.com/driven/0402dri04.html |date=May 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A misconception was that the Expedition's towing and off-road capabilities would be reduced, in comparison to the previous generation's rear [[live axle]]. Nevertheless, underbody obstacle clearance improved by half an inch, and up to two inches under the axle differentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2003/2003_expedition_2.html |title=Special Features |publisher=www.ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new suspension reduces rear unsprung mass by 110 pounds, and allows for a full 9.4 inches of [[suspension travel]] (how much the wheels can travel up or down) improving its ability to traverse uneven terrain for improved control and ride quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cars.com/ford/expedition/2003/expert-reviews/ |title=2003 Ford Expedition |publisher=Cars.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourwheeler.com/roadtests/2003/129_0407_2003_ford_expedition/index.html |title=2003 Ford Expedition |publisher=FourWheeler.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four-wheel independent long-travel suspension itself is a purpose-built version of race suspensions found on off-road desert race vehicles.&lt;ref name="ReferenceQW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=548&amp;item_id=2408&amp;press_section_id=2871 |title=Expedition Chassis |publisher=media.ford.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319185555/http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=548&amp;item_id=2408&amp;press_section_id=2871 |archivedate=2013-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towing capacity increased by 800&amp;nbsp;lbs (363&amp;nbsp;kg) for a high [[towing capacity]] of 8,900&amp;nbsp;lbs (4,037&amp;nbsp;kg) when properly equipped with the appropriate axle ratio and heavy-duty trailer towing package.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Payload capacity was increased up to 1,614&amp;nbsp;lbs (732&amp;nbsp;kg). Expedition also gained a [[hydroformed]] fully boxed frame providing a 70 percent improvement in torsional stiffness.

Along with the high towing capability came all-new steering, braking and electronic systems to help the Expedition better control and maneuver long heavy trailers. Adaptive variable assist power rack-and-pinion steering was introduced along with the largest brake rotors in the segment at that time (13.5&amp;nbsp;inches up front, 13&amp;nbsp;inches in back) with brake calipers 100 percent stiffer than the previous generation Expedition. The four-speed 4R70W automatic transmission received all-new control software to allow the transmission to automatically adjust to the demands of towing, using new computer [[logic]] that recognizes changes in load and road conditions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The automatic full-time [[Control Trac|ControlTrac]] four-wheel drive system remained available, with an uprated two-speed dual range BorgWarner 4416 transfer case. The new transfer case featured an updated intelligent locking center multi-disc differential with front-to-rear "[[Torque vectoring|torque biasing]]" capability in Auto mode. A new dedicated [[microprocessor]] with new control software was added allowing the system to detect different [[terrain]] and surface conditions to predict traction loss before it happens. Two High mode was also reintroduced. [[Ford Expedition#Traction Control|Four-wheel electronic traction control]] was now available as an option, and simulated ''front'' and ''rear'' [[Locking differential#Alternatives|differential locks]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceQW" /&gt;

The V8 engines offered on the previous generation were carried over, but not without major changes and improvements. Both the 4.6 and 5.4-liter Triton V8 engines received further refinements in design and overall [[efficiency]]. Expedition qualified as an [[Ultra Low Emission Vehicle]] (ULEV) and was certified under the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] Tier 2 regulations one year earlier than required.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2003/2003_expedition_3.html |title=2002 Ford Expedition Powertrain |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 4.6-liter engine received an all-new redesigned cast [[aluminium]] engine block optimized for weight reduction and [[Noise, vibration, and harshness|NVH]] improvements. The 5.4-liter engine received an all-new redesigned cast-iron engine block with computer designed ribbing and bracing, along with thicker side skirts and reinforcement at the oil pan flange. The new engine block helped reduce engine vibration and unwanted noise while providing refined performance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Both engines featured piston skirts coated with a [[teflon]]-based friction-reducing material, and fitted with low-tension, low oil consumption rings. In addition, a new fail-safe cooling mode provided protection even in the case of a catastrophic coolant loss (such as a punctured radiator). In the event of coolant loss, the engine control unit shuts off fuel to alternate [[Engine cylinder|cylinders]] to reduce the risk of engine damage from overheating. The valves continue to operate, in order to pump cooling air through the cylinders. The cooling system was designed to maintain an ideal engine temperature even when subjected to a prolonged 15 percent [[gradient]] in 46&amp;nbsp;°C (115&amp;nbsp;°F) weather. A returnless fuel supply system helped to reduce evaporative emissions by providing consistent pressure to the [[fuel injector]]s through a high-pressure pump.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

New active [[hydraulic]] engine mounts were introduced to prevent the powertrain from inducing vibrations into the chassis. By optimizing these engine mounts, the engine block can act as a mass damper, absorbing chassis resonance, improving ride comfort.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Expedition's passenger cabin was better sealed than before, in an effort to eliminate intrusive outside noise from reaching the occupants. Wind, powertrain, road and vehicle body noise was reduced by improving interior [[acoustics]] through new [[damping]] materials, a total of 10 shear-style isolating body mounts, heavier sealing of body and panels, redesigned rubber door seals, and extensive use of interior structural acoustic foam in the upper B-pillars, upper and lower D-pillars and floor pan. Road noise was reduced by 2 [[decibels]], body air leakage reduced by 56 percent, chances for sealant noise disturbances reduced from 15 percent to less than 0.5 percent and wind noise measured at {{convert|80|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} was reduced from 35 [[sones]] to a world class level of 29 sones.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The Expedition also received a thorough exterior and interior cosmetic redesign. Expedition featured an all-new front fascia, grille work, headlamps, body trim, rear fascia, tail lamps and liftgate. Interior fit and finish were improved with an all-new interior featuring new dash, door panels, genuine aluminium trim, and plush carpeting. Premium perforated [[leather]] seating surfaces were standard on Expedition ''Eddie Bauer'' (optional on Expedition ''XLT''). Expedition ''FX4'' models featured all of Expedition's optional off-road equipment as standard equipment. Expedition's [[drag coefficient]] was 0.41 Cd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2003/2003_expedition_1.html |title=2003 Ford Expedition Specifications |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three-row seating was standard with all-new manual fold-flat stow away third row seats. No longer did owners have to remove the third rows seats for more storage. The third row could simply "disappear" into the floor. Power assisted PowerFold fold-flat third row seating was available as an optional extra.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Available features included in-dash [[CD-ROM]] based [[navigation system]], [[DVD]] based rear entertainment system, [[ultrasonic sensor|ultrasonic]] rear park assist/back up sensors, power [[moon roof]], power adjustable accelerator and brake pedals (introduced on the first generation Expedition), Gentex auto dimming electrochromatic rear view mirror, [[Turn signals#Side marker lights and reflectors|lane departure indicators]] on side-view mirrors, second-row captain's chair luxury seating, premium audiophile sound system with in-dash six-disc [[CD changer]] and rear [[subwoofer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2003/2003_expedition_2.html |title=2002 Ford Expedition Special Features |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and four-wheel independent [[pneumatic]] air-ride suspension system.

===Safety and security===

Like the generation before, a 2 air bag [[Supplementary Restraint System|supplementary restraint system]] (SRS) with 2-way occupant protection was standard on Expedition. The dual front SRS air bags now included the Personal Safety System (PSS). PSS would tailor air bag deployment for driver and first passenger and included occupant classification, seat position, crash severity, safety belt pretensioner, load-limiting retractor and safety belt buckle usage [[sensors]].

A new optional 4 air bag supplementary restraint system (SRS) with 6-way occupant protection was also available. This new air bag system included ''SafetyCanopy'' [[Side curtain airbag|dual side curtain air bags]] for head, upper torso and rollover protection. SafetyCanopy would deploy along the A, B and C-pillars down to the vehicle's [[beltline (automotive)|beltline]]. SafetyCanopy could remain inflated after deployment for extended protection and replaced the dual front side airbags featured on the first-generation Expedition.

Other features included side-intrusion door beams, security approach lamps, [[SecuriLock]] with smart key and engine immobilizer, BeltMinder, three-point safety belts for all rows of seating, post-crash fuel pump shut-off, [[tire pressure monitoring system]] (TPMS) and four-wheel, four-[[sensor]], four-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS) with [[electronic brakeforce distribution]] (EBD) and [[emergency brake assist]] (EBA). ''AdvanceTrac'' [[electronic stability control]] with [[traction control system]] was introduced as an optional extra. The electronic traction and stability mitigation system would expand to include ''roll stability control'' (RSC) for the 2005 model year.

===Model year changes===

====2003====
Before the 2003 model year ended, Ford updated the running boards on Expeditions equipped with the Eddie Bauer trim. Earlier in the model year, Eddie Bauer models had received standard black running boards. Toward the end of the model year, Arizona beige running boards were re-introduced to complement the Arizona beige body work which came standard on Eddie Bauer. Body colored running boards had previously been offered on the first-generation Expedition from 2000 to 2002.

====2004====
No major cosmetic or mechanical changes. The Expedition ''Eddie Bauer Premier'' model is reintroduced after being absent from the 2003 model trim line-up. Monochromatic paint work with blacked-out headlamps and special alloy wheels were standard on Eddie Bauer Premier versions. A new Expedition ''XLT Sport'' model is added with Dark Shadow grey exterior body trim. The ''FX4'' trim level was renamed ''NBX''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2004/2004_expedition.html |title=2004 FORD EXPEDITION OVERVIEW |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2005====
Expedition received new roof rails which replaced the traditional sliding cross-bar roof racks. A new high end ''Limited'' trim level replaced the Eddie Bauer Premier model (though the regular Eddie Bauer was still available) and featured chrome accented roof rails, chrome-clad aluminium wheels, PowerFold power assisted stowable side view mirrors and chrome tipped exhaust. An upper high end ''King Ranch'' trim level with Castano leather seating was also introduced. The base 4.6 liter Triton V8 engine was dropped for the 2005 model year as the 5.4-liter Triton V8 was made standard on all Expeditions and updated with [[multi-valve|24-valve]] technology and [[variable valve timing]]. Along with the 2005 model V8 engine update, the Expedition also received a significantly updated version of the four-speed 4R70W automatic transmission.

The new four-speed automatic transmission, now called 4R75E, featured fully electronic Smart Shift technology. A turbine speed [[sensor]] improved transmission control and provided the basis for the fully electronic shift scheduling. The transmission's [[microprocessor]] speeds were improved for better responsiveness and precision of the control system. The transmission was continuously learning, and would calculate the torque in the next gear and schedule shift points based on the Expedition's projected performance in the next gear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meadowlandford.com/ford-transmission-specs.htm |title=New Ford Transmission Specs |publisher=Meadowlandford.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623071741/http://meadowlandford.com/ford-transmission-specs.htm |archivedate=2009-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2005 model Expeditions the 4R75E transmission is designated by the letter "'''B'''" on the manufacturers safety compliance certification label, located in the driver's-side doorjamb. For 2006 model Expeditions, the 4R75E transmission is designated by the letter "'''Q'''".

====2006====
No major cosmetic or mechanical changes. Last year model for the U222. The Gentex auto dimming rear view mirrors were updated. Two new exterior colors were added later on within the model year. They were Pewter metallic and Dark Copper metallic. Medium Flint grey interior was also added to Limited models later on within the model year. Chrome tipped exhaust was made standard on King Ranch models. 2006 would be the last year model for the NBX trim. The ultrasonic rear park assist and SafetyCanopy side curtain airbags were offered as standalone options. Adjustable headrests were also added to the front seats to replace the one piece units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2006/2006_ford_expedition.html |title=2006 Ford Expedition |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Москва-Чукотка (Moscow-Chukotka) overland expedition===
On April 12, 2006, three second-generation full-size Ford Expedition ''Eddie Bauer'' vehicles completed a 32-day overland expedition. This was a {{convert|28000|mi|km|adj=on}} trip across [[North Asia]] and the [[Arctic]] [[Tundra]]. Six team members consisted of leaders, Alexey Mikhailov and Alexander Borodin, technical director, Andrey Rodionov, and professional off-road drivers,: Sergey Goryachev, Victor Parshikov, and Alexey Simakin. The route took them on [[permafrost]] and crossed the [[Arctic Circle]] twice. Visited landmarks included where American aviator [[Carl Ben Eielson]] was lost, and the birthplace of Russian explorer [[Semyon Dezhnev]]. The northernmost point on the route was latitude 69°42′ North ([[Pevek]]). The easternmost point visited was longitude 169°40′ West ([[Cape Dezhnev]]). Temperatures reached -36&amp;nbsp;°C (-32&amp;nbsp;°F) and the team encountered [[Whiteout (weather)|whiteouts]] and a [[polar cyclone]]. An estimated 200&amp;nbsp;kg (440&amp;nbsp;lbs) of snow was removed from each of the vehicles on the following day.&lt;ref name="Москва-Чукотка Overland Expedition"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moscow-chukotka.com/eng/ |title=Москва-Чукотка Overland Expedition |publisher=moscow-chukotka.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002075104/http://www.moscow-chukotka.com/eng/ |archivedate=2013-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vehicles were modified with front end guards along with front and rear utility bumpers, [[winches]], safari roof racks, high-powered off-road lights and extra underbody plating for the engines. Two of the vehicles towed a dual axle [[Trailer (vehicle)|utility trailer]]. Two were equipped also with [[caterpillar track]] systems supplied by [[Mattracks]]. The rubber track systems were only used when off-road conditions became too demanding for [[Tire|conventional tires]]. The rear stabilizer bar failed on both vehicles fitted with the Mattracks system. The vehicles were also equipped with gas stoves (to prepare food) and high-capacity auxiliary fuel tanks (mounted in the rear cargo bay) and sometimes run on poor-quality [[gasoline]].&lt;ref name="Москва-Чукотка Overland Expedition"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carsellers.ru/news/article/2639/ |title=Ford проложил трассу "Москва-Чукотка" |publisher=Carsellers.ru |date=2006-04-26 |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 introduced the third generation of the Expedition developed under the U324 program code name which was an updated version of the second generation Expedition. Most of the improvements were mechanical in nature, and included a sheet metal refresh and redesigned interior with upgraded materials A new long wheelbase ''Expedition EL'' in (U.S. only) and called the ''Expedition Max'' (in [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] only) as a replacement for the discontinued [[Ford Excursion]].
[[File:Motoršou 2009 - Flickr - Infodad (8).jpg|thumb|left|2008 Ford Expedition [[Funkmaster Flex]] edition]]
High-strength [[hydroformed]] fully boxed [[Ford T platform]] ([[chassis]]) was a modified version of the half-ton [[Ford P platform|Ford P2 platform]] from the [[Ford F-150]]. The new T1 platform replaced the old U platform, and provides 10 percent more torsional rigidity than the U platform. T1 incorporates a four-wheel independent long-travel suspension system (first introduced on the second generation) with redesigned suspension geometry and an all-new five-link rear suspension with new rear lower control-arms. As with previous model years, the suspension system could be had with adaptive [[pneumatic]] air-ride springs.

Ford's new 6-speed 6R75 intelligent automatic transmission with dual overdrive gears was introduced. The transmission featured push-button overdrive lock-out, electronic shift scheduling, adaptive shift [[algorithms]] and a [[mechatronic]] transmission control module (TCM) that would save adaptive shift [[Data (computing)|data]] in keep alive memory (KAM). This safeguarded against complete data loss in case of a power failure (such as disconnecting the battery). In the event of a power failure, the mechatronic unit would simply read the last saved data entry from the system's memory, thus, the transmission did not have to completely [[Learning|relearn]] the owner's driving style.

Additionally, the Expedition is powered by the same 5.4 liter Triton V-8 [[internal combustion engine]], rated at {{Convert|300|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} and 365&amp;nbsp;lbf·ft (495 N·m) of torque from the previous generation. When properly equipped with the heavy-duty trailer towing package the SUV can tow up to 9,200&amp;nbsp;lbs (4,130&amp;nbsp;kg). Expedition is classed under the Tier 2, Bin 5 / ULEV 2 [[Ultra Low Emission Vehicle]] environmental classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2007/2007_ford_expedition_1.html |title=2007 Ford Expedition Chassis |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Off-road [[geometry]] figures for approach, departure and ramp breakover angles are 22°, 21° and 18° respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/expedition/specifications/ |title=2010 Ford Expedition &amp;#124; View Full Specification Library |publisher=FordVehicles.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714050608/http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/expedition/specifications/ |archivedate=2010-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minimum running (lowest point) ground clearance is {{convert|8.7|in|mm}}. Underbody (overall) ground clearance is 9.1 inches (230&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carsplusplus.com/specs2011/ford_expedition.php |title=Ford Expedition 2011 |publisher=carsplusplus.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selectable automatic full-time [[Control Trac]] four-wheel drive continues to be offered, and uses a two-speed dual range BorgWarner 4417 transfer case with intelligent locking center multi-disc differential and "torque biasing" capability. Four-wheel electronic traction control is standard and off-road underbody [[skid plate]] armor is optional. A new default off-road program with throttle response recalibration was added, and is automatically activated when Four Low (lock) mode is selected. Expedition can achieve an off-road [[crawl ratio]] of 41.06:1 with a low range ratio of 2.64:1 and rear axle ratio of 3.73:1.

The SUV also underwent a nip/tuck with a few cosmetic enhancements, both inside and out. Expedition's front end now featured Ford's signature three "hollow-bar" grille to complement the SUV's truck close relation to the F-150 and Super Duty pickups. New complex stepped style multifaceted headlamps, side view mirrors with updated [[LED]] lane departure indicators, sleeker body work and redesigned tail lamps were also added. The interior received a new dash with F-150-like center stack, center console, redesigned first row captains chair luxury seating, door panels and interior trim.

To further reduce outside noise intrusion for quieter, more isolated ride comfort, new SoundScreen [[laminated]] [[Acoustics|acoustic]] and solar tinted windshield&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/ford-64090-lincoln-soundscreen.html |title=Ford Products to Launch with Carlite's SoundScreen Noise-Reducing Glass Technology |publisher=Orange County Register |agency=PR Newswire |date=2008-08-25 |accessdate=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was added with thicker laminated side window glass.

The new SUV was unveiled at the [[Houston Auto Show]] rather than at the [[North American International Auto Show]], the [[Greater Los Angeles Auto Show]], or the [[New York International Auto Show]] where most new models are, as 20 percent of all Expedition sales are in [[Texas]]. The third generation Expedition went on sale in August 2006. The first 2007 Expedition to roll off a Ford assembly line was donated by Ford to the Peter family of [[Jamaica, Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]] as part of an episode of the [[American Broadcasting Company]] series ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'' that aired May 7, 2006.

In late 2014, the third generation standard wheelbase U324 Expedition and long-wheelbase U354 Expedition EL/Max underwent a [[Ford Expedition#2015|cosmetic and mechanical refresh for the 2015 model year]].

===Features===
Standard features include 6 speed Automatic transmission, 3.5L EcoBoost V6 gasoline engine with Ti-VCT, and 2 wheel drive using the rear wheels.
Available features include: Extended-Length version, 4 wheel drive, Premium Audiophile sound system with in dash six-disc [[CD changer]], rear [[subwoofer]], [[MP3]] device and [[iPod]] connectivity, [[SIRIUS XM]] [[satellite radio]], [[HomeLink Wireless Control System|HomeLink wireless control system]], tri zone automatic climate control for driver, first passenger and rear passengers, PowerFold power stow away side-view mirrors, PowerFold power fold flat third-row seating, [[Gentex]] auto-dimming [[rear view mirror]], adaptive [[pneumatic]] suspension system, power adjustable pedals, [[ultrasonic sensor|ultrasonic]] park assist, perforated leather seating, climate-controlled heated and cooled front captain's chairs with 10-way power adjust and memory, second-row captain's chair luxury seating, [[DVD]]-based [[voice activated]] [[navigation system]] with liquid crystal [[Touchscreen|touch display]], power [[moon roof]], slimline rear DVD-based entertainment system with flip down [[LCD screen]], power-assisted [[liftgate]] and 20-inch chrome-clad [[aluminium]] six-spoke wheels with [[Pirelli]] Scorpion all-season tires. Some of these features are available on Expedition ''XLT''; many of them are included on Expedition ''Eddie Bauer'' and Expedition ''Limited''.

Upgraded perforated leather seating, [[wood]] and [[leather]]-wrapped steering wheel with audio, climate and cruise controls, interior ebony wood trim, stylized blacked-out stepped-style multifaceted headlamps and [[monochromatic]] paint finish with body-colored grille and chrome accenting are standard on the ''Limited''.

===Model year changes===
====2008====
For the 2008 model year, power deployable/retractable running boards became available, along with a rear view backup camera system. The camera, which is mounted under the Expedition's center liftgate appliqué, utilizes the [[Gentex]] auto dimming rear view mirror's picture-in-mirror technology to display what it sees. Expedition ''King Ranch'' was also reintroduced after being absent from the 2007 model year trim line-up. Expedition ''XLT'' models now get body colored lower body work, replacing the previous black plastic trim and was the Last Ford Model Year for the nine-passenger Front Bench seating option in the Ford Full-Size SUV's from Ford Motor Company (Ford discontinued the 9-passenger Front Bench Seating Option for 2009 and Forward on the old Ford Full-Size SUVs 2009–present)

====2009====
In July 2008, Ford's [[Michigan Assembly Plant|Wayne, Michigan plant]] started production of the 2009 models until finishing the plants run in December of that same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trucktrend.com/features/news/2008/163_news081201_ford_ends_operations_at_michigan_truck_plant_to_retool_for_2011_small_cars/index.html "Ford Ends Operations at Michigan Truck Plant to Retool for 2011 Small Cars"] From Truck Trend (December 1, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009 production of the Expedition was relocated to the [[Kentucky Truck Assembly]] in Louisville along with its sister SUV, the [[Lincoln Navigator]], and the [[Ford F-Series]] Super Duty. That plant used to build the Ford Excursion until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trucktrend.com/features/news/2009/163_news090428_ford_kentucky_truck_plant_reopens/index.html |title=Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant Reopens with Flexible Body Shop From |work=Truck Trend |date=April 28, 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expedition's 6-speed 6R75 automatic was replaced by an improved version, the 6-speed 6R80 automatic. 6R80 features more robust internals, new software logic and a tow/haul mode (replaces the overdrive lock-out) that utilizes new uphill/downhill [[Grade (slope)|gradient]] shift logic for improved performance while towing or hauling heavy loads. The 6-speed automatic can compensate for [[altitude]], grade/slope and present load conditions. The system also reduces the transmission's tendency to "hunt" for the right gear(s) and provides engine braking when descending hills. The nine-passenger front bench seating option has been discontinued for the 2009 model year, leaving only the eight-passenger seating option left with two front bucket seats and two rear bench seats. and the chrome "Expedition" name plate badges have been removed from the left and right front doors. The chrome "Expedition" name plate badge on the rear liftgate remains.

Additional features included the now standard [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|FlexFuel capability]], which can take gasoline, [[E85]] (85% ethanol/15% gasoline), or any combination of the two, and the newly installed EasyFuel capless fuel-filler system. The 5.4 liter V8/FlexFuel feature also upgraded its power to {{convert|310|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the torque rating stayed the same at {{convert|365|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. The 2009 model year also boosted its maximum towing capacity to {{convert|9200|lb|abbr=on}} for the 4x2 version, and up to {{convert|9000|lb|abbr=on}} for the 4x4 version.

The new entertainment features added to the 2009 model year included the optional [[Ford Sync|Ford SYNC]], and an all-new DVD-based voice-activated, [[In car entertainment|multi-entertainment/navigational system]] with liquid crystal touch display. The rearview camera system is now integrated to show the video feed through the navigation screen instead for the rearview mirror, however, the rearview mirror is still used to show images on Expeditions not equipped with the navigation system. The new navigation system features up to 10 [[gigabytes]] of storage space for more than 2400 songs, a jukebox function, a screened photo display, [[iPod]]/[[Zune]] capability for downloading and recharging, ripping CDs, and integrated compatibility for cellphones and Bluetooth; the newly compatible [[Sirius XM|Sirius Travel Link]], which allow drivers to access traffic, weather, sports, and local movie listings; and a "Route Guidance" mode for road and street information. The steering wheel also has a tilt feature and radio controls, including Ford SYNC buttons, allowing the driver to press the button and use voice commands to activate the system, which became standard on Eddie Bauer, Limited, and King Ranch. The tilt w/radio control feature was optional on the XLT during its Wayne plant built orders, but after production moved to Louisville it became standard. For accessory purposes, a HD radio can be installed upon request at a Ford dealership in the United States. New for 2009 were standard heated second row outboard seats on the Limited and King Ranch models only with either the second row bench seat or the optional bucket seats.

====2010====
No major cosmetic or mechanical changes. For the 2010 model year optional packages have now been renamed (to Rapid Specificated Order Codes) and upgraded (100s for XLT, 200s for Eddie Bauer, 300s for Limited, 400s for King Ranch) for the newer models. It has also announced that the 2010 models will now feature Ford's MyKey and trailer sway control as a standard on all trims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/buy/2010-Ford-Expedition+EL/overview/ |title=2010 Ford Expedition EL |publisher=Autoblog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 models were ranked 6th among the top 11 affordable large size SUVs in "[[US News &amp; World Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/Ford_Expedition/ |title=from US News &amp; World Report (August 2009) |publisher=Usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A diesel version for the 2010 model year did not get past the planning stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.leftlanenews.com/44l-diesel-powered-ford-expedition-spied.html |title=4.4L Diesel-powered Ford Expedition spied |work=Left Lane News |date=April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rain-sensing]] windshield wipers were added as an optional extra for Eddie Bauer, but standard on the Limited and King Ranch versions.

====2011====
No major cosmetic or mechanical changes. [[HD Radio]] became a standard on all trims, and a dual DVD system that placed at the headrest area became an optional feature. Another change that was made was in the entry-level trim department, with the Expedition offering the newly designated standard XL entry level with lower black cladding, while the XLT level trim was upgraded along with a new XLT Premium trim with gold cladding, replacing the Eddie Bauer level trim. Also, silver cladding was added as an exterior trim as part of a newly optional XLT Premium Sport Appearance Package. Both Limited and King Ranch trims receive new paint and interior trim. The limited trim also has a chrome grille for a change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=2129&amp;item_id=5796&amp;press_section_id=2870 "2011 Expedition Overview"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005091602/http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=2129&amp;item_id=5796&amp;press_section_id=2870 |date=2012-10-05 }} from media.ford.com (July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012====
[[File:Black &amp; White Ford Expedition 2012.JPG|thumb|2012 Ford Expedition]]
No major cosmetic or mechanical changes. The second heated row seating option was added to XLT Premium and the front park assists became a standard feature on the Limited and King Ranch trims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ford.com/images/10031/2012_Expedition.pdf 2012 Ford Expedition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813171305/http://media.ford.com/images/10031/2012_Expedition.pdf |date=2012-08-13 }} from media.ford.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013====
No major cosmetic changes; however the XL trim and XLT Sport options were dropped, leaving only the XLT, XLT Premium, Limited, and King Ranch trims. Updates made to the 2013 models (which went on sale in August 2012) included the [[Ford Expedition#Heavy-duty trailer towing package|TowCommand]] trailer brake controller system that is bundled with the heavy-duty trailer towing package, a new internal shift control module which allows the six-speed automatic transmission to tailor shifts to engine demand, 10 equipment levels, three new colors (Blue Jeans Metallic, Kodiak Brown Metallic and Ruby Red Metallic Tinted Clearcoat), and a new 20-inch chrome-clad aluminum wheels that was available on both the ''Limited'' and ''King Ranch'' trims. The latter trim also featured chrome roof racks and side mirrors. Another notable change can be found on the driver's instrumental panel, with the temperature and fuel gauge trading sides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ford.com/images/10031/2013_Expedition.pdf 2013 Ford Expedition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904234744/http://media.ford.com/images/10031/2013_Expedition.pdf |date=2012-09-04 }} from media.ford.com&lt;/ref&gt;

No major cosmetic changes. Only three trims, XLT, Limited and King Ranch are offered. The Sirius XM with Navlink and HD radio is added to the XLT as an optional feature. A new, quieter, mechanical [[Nivomat]] adaptive [[hydraulic]] load-leveling suspension system is available, in place of the adaptive pneumatic air-ride load-leveling suspension. When properly equipped the Expedition continues to offer top-end towing capability with a braked trailer towing capacity of 9,200&amp;nbsp;lbs (4,173&amp;nbsp;kg or 4.6 tons).

====2015====
[[File:'15 Ford Expedition.jpg|thumb|Facelifted 2015 Ford Expedition]]
On February 18, 2014, Ford introduced a [[Facelift (automobile)|mid-cycle refresh]] of the Expedition (U324) and Expedition EL (U354), dubbed the U3242 and U3542 respectively, for the 2015 model year.&lt;ref name="2015 Ford Expedition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wot.motortrend.com/2015-ford-expedition-interior-spied-421189.html |title=2015 Ford Expedition |publisher=motortrend.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "2" signifying the second phase of the U324 and U354. The debut was at the Dallas-Fort Worth Auto Show on February 19, 2014; because Texas (especially Dallas and Houston) is an important market. Despite a 27% drop in sales since 2008, Ford is committed to continuing producing the Expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/terry-box/20140218-new-ford-expedition-to-be-introduced-at-2014-dfw-auto-show.ece "New Ford Expedition to be introduced today as 2014 DFW Auto Show opens"] From [[Dallas Morning News]] (February 19, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Ford started production on the updated Expedition (and Expedition EL, which will continue to compete with the Suburban and Yukon XL) around the first quarter of 2014 and placed the 2015 models in dealerships in July 2014. Ford announced that the three level trims, XLT, Limited, and King Ranch, will continue to be offered along with a new top of the line Platinum trim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/02/18/2015-ford-expedition-revealed-official/ "2015 Ford Expedition stays the course, adds EcoBoost power"] from Autoblog (February 18, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; On September 12, 2013, (which was the same day that GM unveiled their next generation SUVs), Automobile Magazine posted a spy shot of the 2015 Expedition, which showed a repositioned tailpipe, and a more upright front fascia which bore a taller, wider grille that appeared inspired by the F-150 and Ford F-Series Super Duty trucks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rumors.automobilemag.com/2015-ford-expedition-spied-245407.html#axzz2euaeD4tP 2015 Ford Expedition Spied] from [[Automobile Magazine]] (September 12, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Official photos released on February 18, 2014 revealed an all-new aggressive [[armadillo]]-like three-bar grille, which features step-stacked bars that evoke the appearance of stepped armor-plating on an armadillo's back. All-new thinner headlamps were added, in addition to an all-new front bumper with oversized lower air intake. The new bumper also features a lower chrome bar and twin LED fog lamps that flank the chrome bar. Brightwork was added on the rear liftgate; and the tailpipe was repositioned straight, instead of making a 90 degree turn behind the right rear wheel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2015-ford-expedition/ 2015 Ford Expedition photos] from Autoblog (February 18, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Expedition remained a [[body-on-frame]] (BOF), allowing the SUV to retain its heavy-duty truck underpinnings for towing and hauling needs.&lt;ref name="http://www.motoring2.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://motoring2.com/2013/07/ford-readies-hybrid-power-for-next-f-150-expedition-navigator/#.UfBZg0pRF8E |title=Ford readies hybrid power for next F-150, Expedition, Navigator |publisher=motoring2.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023055705/http://motoring2.com/2013/07/ford-readies-hybrid-power-for-next-f-150-expedition-navigator/#.UfBZg0pRF8E |archivedate=2013-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leftlanenews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/next-lincoln-navigator-to-ditch-v8-for-ecoboost-v6.html |title=Ford's Expedition and Lincoln Navigator |publisher=www.leftlanenews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full-size SUV received the 3.5 liter 24-valve [[DOHC]] [[Variable Cam Timing|Ti-VCT]] [[EcoBoost]] V-6 engine which features an aluminium engine block, [[twin-turbo]]chargers, [[Direct fuel injection|direct injection]], and twin independent [[variable camshaft timing]]. Power output for the [[EcoBoost]] V-6 will be rated around 365 horsepower and 420&amp;nbsp;lb-ft of torque, and will be the only engine featured, dropping the 5.4 liter V-8 that was available in the 2007–2014 models due to Ford wanting to make the Expedition more fuel efficient. Despite the changeover from V-8 to V-6, the Expedition did boost its MPG to 16 (city)/23 (highway) for the 2WD and 15 (city)/21 (highway) for the 4WD, but it is now on par with the GM large-size SUVs, which also boasts the same MPGs as the Expedition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/07/21/2015-ford-expedition-review-first-drive/ "2015 Ford Expedition"] from Autoblog (July 21, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the new engine, Expedition received an updated 6-speed 6R80 SelectShift intelligent [[manumatic]] gearbox with manual shift mode. Expedition also features a new [[Electric power steering#Electric systems|electric power servo-assisted steering]] and Pull-Drift Compensation (PDC) which [[Crosswind stabilization|detects crosswinds and compensates for it]].

The interior remained similar to the outgoing models, but with upgraded materials and a revised prominent center stack, which introduces the latest version of the 8-inch [[MyFord Touch]] touchscreen [[infotainment]] and [[telematics]] system. [[Push-button start|Push-to-start engine ignition]] with intelligent access was added and the four-wheel drive mode selector (for models with 4x4) was revised and repositioned. The [[Ford Expedition#Heavy-duty trailer towing package|TowCommand]] paddle controls was repositioned over the four-wheel drive mode selector, to make way for revised audio and climate controls on the center stack.&lt;ref name="2015 Ford Expedition"/&gt;

The new features for 2015 included an optional, revised four-wheel independent suspension system with intelligent continuously-controlled damping (CCD) system that alters suspension settings constantly based on 46 parameters and offers comfort, normal, and sport modes. Expedition is the first Ford vehicle in North America to have continuously-controlled damping. Other new optional features includes [[Blind spot monitor#Blind Spot Information System|blind-spot information system]] (BLIS) with cross-traffic alert, and a rearview camera and apps for the infotainment system to help with towing and off-road driving, all of which is standard in the Platinum trim, whose seating and interior features include Brunello leather, a red wine color with tuxedo-stripe accents and French seamed stitching, or black leather with Agate Gray accents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truckinweb.com/webonly/1402_2015_ford_expedition_ecoboost_platinum/ 2015 Ford Expedition:EcoBoost and Platinum] from ''Truckin' Magazine'' (February 19, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The selectable automatic full-time ''ControlTrac'' four-wheel drive system continues to be offered, but gains a trio of new off-road electronic systems in the form of Hill Ascent Assist (HAA), [[Hill Descent Control system|Hill Descent Control]] (HDC), and Ford Truck Apps (FTA). FTA gives off-road orientation/geometry, 4x4 system status, and traction control system status in real-time. The four-wheel electronic traction control system (brake differential locking control) was [[Calibration|recalibrated]] to take into account the new [[EcoBoost]] V-6's higher torque output and earlier torque delivery.

'''EcoBoost Performance'''

The heavyweight 6,155&amp;nbsp;lb (3+ ton) as tested, 2015 Expedition ''Platinum'' with 3.5 EcoBoost V-6 and selectable automatic full-time ControlTrac four-wheel drive was clocked from [[0 to 60]] mph in 6.4 seconds. The full-size SUV can clip 100&amp;nbsp;mph in 18.2 seconds, 110&amp;nbsp;mph in 24.3 seconds, and is electronically safety-limited to 113&amp;nbsp;mph. Expedition has a near perfect 50:50 front:rear balanced weight distribution and [[center of gravity]] positioned at 28.5 inches.&lt;ref name="2015 Ford Expedition Platinum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/2015-chevrolet-tahoe-ltz-vs-2015-ford-expedition-platinum-comparison-test |title=2015 Ford Expedition Platinum |publisher=caranddriver.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expedition ''Platinum'' averaged 39.2&amp;nbsp;mph in a 610&amp;nbsp;ft [[Autocross|slalom]] run and pulled 0.78g in roadholding [[skidpad]] testing. High speed emergency braking from 70&amp;nbsp;mph to 0 (full stop) was completed in 170&amp;nbsp;ft. In comparison, the Expedition's main rival took a full 10 feet longer, completing the same emergency brake test in 180&amp;nbsp;ft.&lt;ref name="2015 Ford Expedition Platinum"/&gt;

====2016====
For the 2016 model year, most of the features that were introduced from 2015 were carried over. However, the Expedition began adding Ford's upgraded enhanced SYNC3 to its trims, as an optional feature on the XLT and standard on Limited, King Ranch and Platinum. The Limited added Sony's Premium Audio System as a standard.

====2017====
In June 2016, Ford began selling the 2017 model year Expedition, with no major changes being made and continued to be offered in XLT, Limited, King Ranch, and Platinum level trims. This is the final year of the third generation Expedition and Expedition EL  (U324) and (U354)

The fourth-generation Expedition, known internally at Ford Motor Company as the "U553", was unveiled on February 7, 2017 at the [[Dallas Cowboys]] training facility, Ford Center in [[Frisco, Texas]], ahead of its [[Chicago Auto Show]] debut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leftlanenews.com/redesigned-ford-expedition-loses-weight-gains-power-94451.html "Chicago Live:2018 Ford Expedition"] from Left Lane News (February 9, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the new Expedition started on September 25, 2017. The vehicles arrived at dealerships in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donlen.com/buildstart-trucks-ford.html |title=Ford-Lincoln Trucks (Build Out Final Order Start Up Dates) - Donlen Corporation |website=Donlen.com |date=2013-01-24 |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.just-auto.com/analysis/ford-and-lincoln-future-models-into-the-2020s_id170361.aspx |title=Ford and Lincoln future models into the 2020s|publisher=just-auto.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The all-new Expedition was developed in secret under the U553 program codename and features [[body-on-frame]] (BOF) architecture with high-strength lightweight material construction consisting of [[boron]] [[Boron steel|steel]] and [[aluminium]].&lt;ref name="The F-150's Aluminum Diet"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/automobiles/autoshow/the-f-150s-aluminum-diet.html?_r=0 |title=The F-150's Aluminum Diet |publisher=autonews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four-door body is constructed from alumimium-alloy, while the frame is constructed from boron steel. The U553 will move to the all-new half-ton [[hydroformed]] T3 platform ([[chassis]]), which is a modified version of the half-ton platform underpinning the P552 2015 Ford F-150. The T3 platform will use a new four-wheel independent suspension system design. Updated powertrain systems (engines and transmissions) including a [[Hybrid electric vehicle|Hybrid]] variant with proprietary parallel [[Parallel hybrid#Parallel hybrid|hybrid electric-drive system]] to help increase fuel efficiency are expected.&lt;ref name="http://www.motoring2.com"/&gt; Expedition will gain Ford's new 10-speed 10R80 ''[[Manumatic|SelectShift]]'' automatic transmission which will feature [[artificially intelligent]] shifting, electronic range select, manual shift mode, and be controlled via a rotary dial on the center console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2014/12/exclusive-inside-look-fords-new-10-speed-transmission/ |title=Exclusive: An Inside Look At Ford's New 10 Speed Transmission |publisher=thetruthaboutcars.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next-generation Expedition's [[Engineer|chief engineer]] is Jackie Marshall DiMarco, who is also the chief engineer for the next-generation F-150 pickup.&lt;ref name="Interview: Jackie Marshall DiMarco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trucktrend.com/features/consumer/163_1304_jackie_marshall_dimarco_ford_interview/ |title=Interview: Jackie Marshall DiMarco, Ford chief engineer, F-150 and Expedition |publisher=trucktrend.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spy photographers captured early, engineering test mules of the U553 in late 2015, which sported a crude highly modified non-production intent F-150 SuperCrew body atop the production intent T3 platform chassis. In late 2016, spy photographers managed to capture photos of the actual first pre-production prototypes of the U553, wearing the production intent body on the production intent platform. The styling and appearance of the U553 Expedition is inspired by the U502 Explorer along with elements of the P552 F-150, the vehicle on which the new Expedition is based, and will have a more aerodynamic and streamlined silhouette, with raked windshield and sloped roofline which will lead to a rear liftgate spoiler. The U553 Expedition's C-pillar will be more forward slanted, echoing the forward slanted C-pillar of the U502 Explorer introduced for 2011. In addition the Expedition's body will feature sculpted sides with character lines, similar to the U502 Explorer, as opposed to the straight slab sides of the current Expedition. Expedition's front grill and headlamp design is inspired by the facelifted P552 F-150, with the front bumper retaining a similar design and appearance to its predecessor, the U324 Expedition, after its facelift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kbb.com/car-news/all-the-latest/2018-ford-expedition-remake-spotted/2100001092/ |title=2018 Ford Expedition Remake Spotted|publisher=kbb.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also expanded the standard size version's wheelbase by 3 inches and its length by 4 inches while decreasing the height by one inch (losing 300 pounds in the process) in order to allow more leg room and space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2018-ford-expedition-photos-and-info-news "2018 Ford Expedition: Bigger, Aluminumier, EcoBoostier"] from Car and Driver (February 8, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

Expedition (U553) will be one of the very first vehicles in North America to use a new next-generation high speed [[Controller Area Network]] 3 (CAN-3) vehicle [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] system. The CAN-3 electrical architecture is akin to a human [[nervous system]] and allows the Expedition's various on-board [[microprocessors]] and electronic vehicle control systems to communicate or "talk" to one another through [[Data (computing)|electronic data]] that is sent and received. With high speed CAN-3, Expedition can learn and react faster than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sae.org/15244/ |title=All-new 2018 Ford Expedition gets aluminum body, 10-speed - SAE International |website=Articles.sae.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.co.za/how-to-fix/your-cars-nervous-system/ |format=PDF |title=Your Car's Nervous System |website=Popularmechanics.co.za |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Expedition will be available with selectable automatic full-time four-wheel drive that routes torque through a two-speed dual range [[transfer case]] with electronic locking center multi-disc differential. A new [[Locking differential|electronic locking rear differential]] will be available to augment the 4x4 system. Both the center and rear locking systems will be teamed with four-wheel electronic traction control (ETC), which simulates a locking front differential by ABS "brake locking" the front differential. Expedition's off-road electronic aids Hill Descent Control (HDC) and Hill Ascent Assist (HAA) will be joined by the Terrain Management System adapted from the [[Ford Raptor]]. Terrain Management is capable of working with 4L mode, like the Ford Raptor, and has 7 (seven) drive modes to choose from which include Normal, Eco, Sport, Tow/Haul, Gravel/Snow, Mud/Ruts, and Sand. The four-wheel drive system has 3 (three) direct drive modes which include 2H, 4A, and 4L. The 4H mode has now been dropped from the selection, as the Terrain Management computer now controls the electronic center lock of the four-wheel drive system. Terrain Management will engage the electronic center lock for a 50:50 front:rear torque split while in 4A direct drive mode, when the Mud/Ruts or Sand modes are selected. The 4L direct drive mode engages the electronic center lock regardless of the off-road drive mode selected. A "tap to lock/unlock" button is located near the drive mode dial for operation of the electronic rear lock.&lt;ref name="motorauthority.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Brandon Turkus |url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1108753_2018-ford-expedition-goes-aluminum |title=2018 Ford Expedition goes aluminum |website=Motorauthority.com |date=2017-02-09 |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Off-road geometry figures for approach, departure, and ramp breakover, improve slightly with 23.3°, 21.9°, and 21.4° of obstacle clearance. Minimum running (lowest point) ground clearance increases by a full inch, from 8.7 to 9.8 inches.&lt;ref name="ford.com"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.ford.com/suvs/expedition/2018/models/expedition-platinum/ |title=2018 Ford Expedition |website=ford.com |date=2017-10-09 |accessdate=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expedition (U553) is [[certified]] by the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]]' independent SAE J2807 towing standard to tow a maximum 9,300 [[Pound (mass)|lbs]] (4,218 [[kg]] or 4.65 [[Short ton|ton]]s) of braked trailer.

Among the new features that have been incorporated into the fourth generation Expedition includes a 360-degree camera and park assist system that can make parking much easier, along with optional safety features that will use both camera and radar technology, and include automatic braking, lane-keep assist, active cruise control, and blind-spot monitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerreports.org/suvs/preview-2018-ford-expedition/ "Preview: 2018 Ford Expedition"] from Consumer Reports (February 8, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are two USB ports per row, four 12-volt outlets and a 120-volt household outlet. Ford has also partnered up with Sling that enables the twin-screen rear entertainment system, as well as personal tablets on the vehicle's Wi-Fi, to watch cable TV content. The Wi-Fi content can be used up to 10 devices and features Apple Car Play and Android Auto capabilities that is compatible to Ford SYNC3 and Ford Pass. There is also at least 40 different spaces and cup holders to allow items to be stored. A dual vista panoramic sunroof is available as an optional feature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cars.com/articles/2018-ford-expedition-review-first-impressions-and-photo-gallery-1420693398935/ "2018 Ford Expedition Review: First Impressions and Photo Gallery"] from Cars.com (February 10. 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth generation Expedition will only be available in four level trims as the King Ranch trim (from 2005–2017) was discontinued after the 2017 model year. The three primary trims, XLT, Limited, and the top-of-the-line Platinum, will be available to regular customers, while the fourth trim, XL, will only be exclusive to rental companies, corporate fleets, and government agencies, as they will not have a lot of the features as the aforementioned three trims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2017/02/07/2018-ford-expedition-max-aluminum-details/ "The 2018 Ford Expedition goes aluminum and gets bigger"] from Autoblog (February 7, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; The Expedition will still retain its unique (standard) eight passenger seating on all trims like before, with optional seven passenger seating.&lt;ref name="motorauthority.com"/&gt; The MSRP has been listed by Ford for the fourth generation Expedition will be higher than the previous generation, starting at around $52,000 (US) for XLT and $63,000 (US) for Limited level trims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carsdirect.com/automotive-news/2018-ford-expedition-priced-from-52-890-will-range-to-nearly-80k "2018 Ford Expedition Priced From $52,890, Will Range To Nearly $80k"] from Cars Direct (June 20, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety &amp; Security ===

All 2018 Expedition models carry a power four-wheel disk antilock brake system (ABS) with brake assist and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), six standard airbags including a Safety Canopy System that provides side-curtain airbags with roll-fold technology and a rollover sensor, rear-door child-safety locks, a LATCH system (Lower Anchors and Tether Anchors for Children), an Individual Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), and a SOS Post-Crash Alert System https://www.ford.com/suvs/expedition/models/expedition-xlt/.

The Expedition has an available Driver Assistance Package that equips the vehicle with smart driver-assist technology, including pre-collision assist with pedestrian detection and forward collision warning, lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, auto high-beam headlamps, and rain-sensing wipers.

An array of standard security features includes a SecuriLock Passive Anti-Theft System, a perimeter alarm, a personal safety system, SecuriCode Keyless Entry Keypad, MyKey, and available inclination and intrusion sensors.

=== Expedition SSV ===

The 2018 Expedition SSV is a fleet-only version of the Expedition XLT, and offers similar standard equipment.

=== Expedition XLT ===

Starting off the 2018 Expedition lineup is the XLT trim, which is available in either 4X2 or 4X4 configurations, as well as in the MAX style. Standard features include cloth upholstery, keyless access with push-button start, eighteen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, a 60/40 second-row bench seat with CenterSlide seat, Hill Start Assist and Hill Descent Control (4X4 models only), MyFord w/ SYNC radio with 4.3-inch LCD display screen, [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]], and a nine-speaker audio system, 3.5L [[EcoBoost]] Twin-Turbocharged V6 gasoline engine with 375-400 horsepower and 470-480 lb. ft. of torque, remote start, a power-folding third-row bench seat, and more.

A key difference from 2017 is that a surround-sound premium audio system and rear seat entertainment system are no longer available as an option for XLT models, and that push-button start, and a  power-folding third-row seat are now standard equipment (this feature was optional on the 2017 XLT).

A trailer towing package, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, heated front and rear seats, SYNC 3 infotainment system with optional GPS navigation, a power panoramic moonroof, heated and ventilated front bucket seats, the FX4 Off-Road Package (4X4 models only), twenty-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, and other comfort and convenience features are optional.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ford.com/suvs/expedition/models/expedition-xlt/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expedition Limited ===

The 2018 Expedition Limited is built with either a 4X2 or 4X4 build, each with a bigger MAX build.

[[File:'15 Ford Expedition EL -- Front.jpg|left|thumb|2015 Ford Expedition EL (U354)]]

As part of the shift to the T1 platform for the 2007 model year, Ford developed an extended-length version of the Expedition, to more closely match the Chevrolet Suburban/GMC Yukon in size. Introduced as the ''Ford Expedition EL'' (EL=extended length alongside the Lincoln Navigator L, the variant effectively replaced the Super Duty-based [[Ford Excursion]].  In Canada, to avoid confusion with the [[Acura EL]] sedan, Ford renamed the extended-length version as the ''Expedition Max''.

Originally intended to carry the [[Ford Everest]] name, Ford product planners changed their minds, as the nameplate was already in use for a midsize Ford SUV in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/GeneralFuture/articleId=105986|title=Spy Shots: 2007 Ford Everest from|last=Jacquot|first=Josh|date=|publisher=Edmunds.com|accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Outside [[North America]], including the [[U.S. territories]] of [[Puerto Rico]], [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], and [[Guam]], the Expedition EL is also imported to and sold in the [[Middle East]] and [[Taiwan]].  In the [[Philippines]], the Expedition EL is the only version imported and sold; coincidentally, it is also a market where the Ford Everest SUV is sold.

===Expedition EL/Max (2007–2017)===
For the 2007 [[model year]], Ford introduced the extended-length Expedition EL/Max.  With a wheelbase stretched 12 inches (to 131 inches) and a length increased 14.8 inches (to 221.3 inches) over the standard Expedition, the EL/Max is sized comparably to the Suburban/Yukon XL, providing additional cargo space over the standard-wheelbase version.  The extended-length body of the EL/Max is distinguished by its longer cargo-area windows and its rear door design (the rear wheels no longer intrude into the lower half of the doors).

Alongside the standard-length Ford Expedition, the EL/Max was offered with a single powertrain; the 5.4L Triton V8 was standard from 2007 to 2014, replaced by the twin-turbocharged 3.5L EcoBoost V6 for 2015 to 2017.  The EL/Max is also sold with both rear-wheel and four-wheel drive configurations.  The larger overall size restricted towing capacity by approximately 300 pounds, to {{convert|8900|lb|abbr=on}} (for 2WD) and {{convert|8700|lb|abbr=on}} (for 4WD) over a standard-wheelbase example.

Over its first-generation, the EL/Max shared its features with the standard-length Expedition; for 2012 model, a cargo organizer became an exclusive feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/ford-expedition-el.html#overview |title=2010 Ford Expedition EL overview from www.leftlanenews.com (May 26, 2009) |publisher=leftlanenews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Expedition EL was introduced in 4 trim lines: XLT, Eddie Bauer, Limited, and the King Ranch series during the 2007–2010 model year.  For 2011, the Eddie Bauer trim was replaced by XLT and XLT Premium, with XL becoming the new base trim level.  After 2012, all versions of the XL trim were dropped.

For 2015, the EL/Max received the same facelift and upgrades as the standard-length Expedition.

Alongside the standard-length Expedition, the EL/Max also received a 5-star rating from the NHTSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safercar.gov/portal/site/safercar/menuitem.94b0130be143aeb342252f0835a67789/?vgnextoid=68adf2905bf54110VgnVCM1000002fd17898RCRD&amp;vgnextrefresh=1&amp;vehicleClass=Sport%20Utility%20Vehicle&amp;year=2008&amp;make=Ford&amp;model=Expedition&amp;page=1 |title=Home &amp;#124; National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) |publisher=Safercar.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Expedition EL was also ranked 9th among the top 15 "Best Family Haulers", according to a June 2009 consumers favorite survey conducted by Edmunds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmunds.com/reviews/consumersfavorites/articles/149066/article.html "Consumers' Favorites: Best Family Hauler" from www.edmunds.com (June 1, 2009)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607115536/http://www.edmunds.com/reviews/consumersfavorites/articles/149066/article.html |date=June 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 7, 2017, Ford announced that the Expedition EL will now take the name Expedition MAX (Max is now stylized with all capitals as '''MAX''') nameplate as the rest of the world when the fourth generation models debut in November 2017 for the 2018 model year (in actuality, the MAX is a second generation SUV). Like the standard size Expedition, this was also unveiled ahead of the Chicago Auto Show and will carry the same features and the three featured trims, XLT, Limited, and Platinum. It also expanded its length size by one inch to allow more space and legroom in the third seat row. Although the rear passenger doors were widened, the aft wheel well trim still doesn't cut into them.

[[File:Ford Expedition MAX Back P4220634.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view]]

This version is expected to become more competitive with the Suburban/Yukon XL in the long wheelbase SUV segment, an area where GM dominates; when photos for the fourth generation Expedition were released, a majority of the pictures and videos indicated where Ford wants to target the MAX. Like the (standard length) Expedition, the (extended length) Expedition MAX will also still retain its (standard) eight passenger seating on all trims like before. The MAX will also see a starting MSRP range of $55,000 (US) for the XLT and $66,800 (US) for the Limited level trims, making this more expensive than the Suburban but on par with the Yukon XL in terms of pricing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2018-ford-expedition-and-expedition-max/ "2018 Ford Expedition and Expedition Max (Photos)"] from Autoblog (February 7, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2017/06/the-2018-ford-expedition-is-getting-a-major-price-hike.html "The 2018 Ford Expedition is Getting a Major Price Hike"] from Autoguide.com (June 21, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
===Full Size Expedition===
The standard size Expedition are sold in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], the [[U.S. territories]] of [[Puerto Rico]], [[American Samoa]], [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands|the CNMI]], [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], and [[Guam]], Republic of China [[Taiwan]], the [[Philippines]], the [[Middle East]], [[Central America]], [[the Caribbean]], [[South America]] (except [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Venezuela]]), [[Asia]] ([[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Mongolia]] and [[South Korea]]), [[Africa]] ([[Algeria]], [[Angola]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Egypt]], [[Gabon]], [[Ghana]], [[Libya]], [[Madagascar]], [[Morocco]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Senegal]]), and [[Central Asia]] ([[Armenia]], [[Kazakhstan]], and [[Kyrgyzstan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fleet.ford.com/global/pdfs/AllRegions.pdf |format=PDF |title=Global Fleet :Product Guide 2012 |website=Fleet.ford.ca |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2015 refresh, the standard size Expedition became exclusive to the United States, Canada, Mexico, Republic of China (Taiwan), and the Middle East. The US and Canadian Expeditions are available in XLT, Limited, King Ranch and Platinum, while The Mexican Expedition offers the XLT, Limited, and King Ranch trims. The Middle East Expeditions are offered in XL, XLT, Limited, King Ranch, and in Platinum (RWD only) trims.

With the introduction of the fourth generation Expedition, Ford will make the SUV available to North America in the Fall of 2017 first, followed by a global launch in early 2018, where it will go on sale in selected countries.

===Expedition EL/Max===
For the Expedition EL/Max, all six versions (XL, XLT/Eddie Bauer, XLT Platinum/Sport, Limited, King Ranch and Platinum) are available in the United States. From the 2007 to 2010 model years, The EL/Max level trims were limited to only 3 versions for Canada, Republic of China (Taiwan), and The Middle East, two for Mexico, and one for the Philippines. Canada's Expedition Max offered the Eddie Bauer, Limited and King Ranch trims, Mexico's Expedition Max in Limited and King Ranch trims, and the Middle East's EL level trims in XLT, Eddie Bauer and Limited. The Philippines' lone Expedition EL level trim was the Eddie Bauer model from 2007 to 2010.

After the 2011 model year Ford made changes in the international exportation of the EL/Max trims. As a result of the changes, the Limited trim became the only version available in Canada and Mexico as Eddie Bauer (in Canada) and King Ranch trims (in both Canada and Mexico) were discontinued, while the Philippines and the Middle East replaced the Eddie Bauer with the XLT trim. The Middle East also started to get all of the 5 US level base trims, including the new XL trims that took the XLT's place and the King Ranch trim.

With the 2015 refresh, the Expedition EL US level trims are the same as the standard versions: XLT, Limited, King Ranch, and Platinum, all four available in rear wheel and four wheel drive. The Canadian Expedition Max are only featured in Limited and Platinum level trims, also available in RWD and 4WD. Mexico's Expedition Max are available in rear wheel drive XLT only, but available in RWD and 4WD Limited versions. The Philippines, Republic of China (Taiwan), and Middle East ELs are only available in 4WD Limited trims.

With the introduction of the Expedition Max for the 2018 model year as the successor to the first generation Expedition EL, Ford plans to make the vehicle available globally, with North America in late 2017 and selected countries in early 2018.

==Four-wheel drive system==

Selectable automatic full-time [[Control Trac]] four-wheel drive designed by [[BorgWarner]] is standard on all 4x4 Expeditions. There are four modes: Two High mode, Auto mode, Four High mode and Four Low mode. Each mode can be selected via a rotary control dial on the dash.

The Expedition's system uses a two-speed dual range BorgWarner [[transfer case]] with a [[software]] controlled variable intelligent locking [[Electromagnetic clutch#Multiple disk clutches|center multi-disc differential]]. The four-wheel drive system does not use a [[Planetary gear|planetary]] or [[Bevel gear|bevel]] geared center differential, which are typically found in permanent four-wheel drive systems where torque is supplied to all four wheels.

4WD Expeditions come with standard dual front frame-mounted closed-loop recovery hooks and available off-road under body protection. Steel plates are placed over vital areas with a composite shield for the fuel tank. Expedition 4x4s are tested alongside the [[F-150]] and [[Super Duty]] trucks at Ford's [[California]] and [[Arizona]] [[Ford Proving Grounds|proving grounds]].

===Traction control===
Rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive have conventional open-type [[Differential (mechanical device)|differentials]] with a choice of axle ratios. Traction control systems, both mechanical and electronic, are optional.

'''Mechanical traction control''' (1997–2006)

Both first and second generation Ford Expeditions (UN93 and U222) had optional ''Traction-Lok'' rear [[limited-slip differential]] (LSD). The clutch packs inside the LSD tend to be weak, will wear over time, gradually losing their ability to transfer torque, and LSD will function like an open-type differential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escondidotransmission.net/Driveline_Axles/traction_lock.htm |title=Traction-Lok |publisher=escondidotransmission.net |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front differential on four-wheel drive models are open-type differential. The ''AdvanceTrac'' electronic stability control for the 2003 model year. The 2006 was the last model year for the Traction-Lok limited-slip differential.

'''Electronic traction control''' (2003–present)

''AdvanceTrac'' [[electronic stability control]] was introduced for the 2003 model year as an optional extra on the second generation Ford Expedition (U222). Bundled with the electronic stability control system is [[Traction control|four-wheel electronic traction control]] (functions at all wheels) for Expeditions with four-wheel drive.&lt;ref name="ReferenceQW" /&gt; Two-wheel drive Expeditions only receive two-wheel electronic traction control for rear wheels. ''AdvanceTrac'' was made standard equipment on all third generation Expeditions (U324).

The traction control system uses four-wheel, four-[[sensor]], four-channel [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS) to apply and release the [[disc brakes]] on the drive wheel that has lost traction. The ABS clamps down on the slipping drive wheel or wheels, "brake locking" the differential, which can transfer up to 100 percent of supplied [[torque]] to the opposing drive wheel with better traction. By ABS "brake locking" both the front ''and'' rear differentials, the traction control system can simulate front and rear [[Locking differential#Alternatives|differential locks]]. The system works even if two of its drive wheels (one front, one rear) are completely off the ground.&lt;ref name="ReferenceQW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford-trucks.com/specs/2003/2003_expedition.html |title=2003 Ford Expedition Overview |publisher=Ford-trucks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the ABS brakes rather than mechanical limited-slip or locking devices inside the axle differentials gives quicker response, more seamless performance, and enhanced durability.&lt;ref name="ReferenceQW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Terrain Management System (2018–present)===
Starting with the 2018 model year, the Expedition and Expedition MAX will utilize Ford's Terrain Management System. Buttons to control the 4x4 system are arranged around the central Terrain Management dial. The system is similar to the one found in the 2011–present Explorer, however the Explorer's system is more simplified. The Expedition's Terrain Management System is adapted from the SVT Raptor to allow use of a 4L (low-lock) mode as well as an electronic locking rear differential. Moreover, the Explorer's Terrain Management System has 4 (four) drive modes, while the Expedition has 7 (seven) drive modes, not including the 3 (three) 4x4 system direct drive modes.

Depending on the mode selected, Terrain Management will control, adjust, and fine tune the [[Engine#Internal combustion engine|engine]], [[Automatic transmission|transmission]], center multi-disc differential lock, throttle response, [[Traction control system#Use of traction control|four-wheel electronic traction control]] and [[electronic stability control]] (ESC) to adapt the SUV for optimal performance on the corresponding [[terrain]].

==Towing capability==
When first introduced in 1996, the Expedition competed with both the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] and [[Chevrolet Tahoe|GMC Yukon]] in the full-size half-ton SUV towing segment. New competitors included the [[Dodge Durango]] (which was discontinued in 2009, but reintroduced in 2011), [[Nissan Armada]], and [[Toyota Sequoia]]. Product research conducted by Ford indicated that 92 percent of Expedition owners use the SUV for vacations. Some 60 percent use it to transport outdoor sports equipment, while 40 percent of Expedition owners use the vehicle for towing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automotive.com/2007/12/ford/expedition/reviews/index.html |title=2007 Ford Expedition In-Depth Review |publisher=Automotive.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The half-ton Expedition EL/Max competes with the half-ton [[Chevrolet Suburban]] 1500 and [[GMC Yukon XL]] 1500 in the towing segment.

Since its introduction, the Expedition's [[Trailer (vehicle)#Brakes|braked trailer]] towing capacity has grown from 8,100 [[Pound (mass)|lbs]] (3,674 [[kg]] or 4.05 [[Short ton|tons]]) to a current rating of 9,200&amp;nbsp;lbs (4,173&amp;nbsp;kg or 4.6 tons) when properly equipped. The list of towing features is also ever growing. Towing features common to all generations of the Expedition include: smallest possible [[turning radius]] for increased trailer maneuverability, large [[Side-view mirror|side view mirrors]] to improve rearward visibility, rearward-facing [[Turn signals#Side marker lights and reflectors|lane departure indicators]] which are helpful to other motorist when the Expedition is towing a long trailer providing added visual safety, heavy-duty flashers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordvehicles.com/assets/pdf/towing/10FLMrvEXPEDITIONsep09.pdf |title=Ford 2010 Expedition Towing Guide |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821125728/http://www.fordvehicles.com/assets/pdf/towing/10FLMrvEXPEDITIONsep09.pdf |archivedate=2010-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; heavy-duty large disc brakes to withstand prolonged braking while towing, and an available heavy-duty trailer towing package which includes necessary additions for heavy-duty towing.

As of the 2010 model year, the Expedition received trailer sway control (TSC) as standard equipment. TSC detects trailer oscillations and corrects it via [[asymmetrical]] ABS braking and reducing engine power until the Expedition and its trailer are both back under control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordvehicles.com/suvs/expedition/features/#page=Feature22 |title=Ford - Cars, SUVs, Trucks &amp; Crossovers &amp;#124; Ford Vehicles &amp;#124; The Official Site of Ford Vehicles |publisher=FordVehicles.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heavy-duty trailer towing package===

Expeditions equipped with the heavy-duty trailer towing package are prepped and readied, at [[Kentucky Truck Assembly|the factory]], for towing. The package includes a VESC (Vehicle Equipment Safety Commission) V-5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vesc.org/vescregs.html |title=Vehicle Equipment Safety Commission Regulations VESC V-5 |publisher=vesc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or [[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] J684) Class IV (Class 4) [[Evaluation|rated]] [[trailer hitch]] with [[Tow hitch#Weight-distributing hitch|weight distribution]] capability, heavy-duty radiator, heavy-duty auxiliary [[transmission fluid]] cooler, and hitch mounted 4 and 7-pin trailer electrical connectors.

For model years prior to 2013, these Expeditions are prewired for later installation of an after-market electronic [[trailer brake controller]]. The brake controller [[wiring harness]] is located under the dash on the driver's side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford.com/resources/ford/general/pdf/towingguides/13flrv&amp;tt_expedition.pdf |title=2013 Ford Expedition Towing |publisher=media.ford.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the 2013 model year onward, these Expeditions are factory equipped with the [[TowCommand]] electronic trailer brake controller system. This features +/– gain brake adjustment with support for heavy-duty trailers with up to four axles (quad axle trailers) and is compatible with electrically actuated trailer drum brakes and electric-over-hydraulic (EOH) actuated trailer drum or disc brake systems. The trailer brake controller is fully integrated into the Expedition's four-wheel, four-sensor, four-channel [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS), and trailer sway control (TSC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.ford.com/images/10031/2013_Expedition.pdf |title=2013 Ford Expedition |publisher=media.ford.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904234744/http://media.ford.com/images/10031/2013_Expedition.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford.com/suvs/expedition/features/#page=Feature6 |title=2013 Ford Expedition TBC |publisher=media.ford.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expeditions were offered with an adaptive [[pneumatic]] air-ride suspension system with self leveling, payload leveling and trailer load leveling capability from 1997 to 2013. For the 2014 model year, a [[Nivomat]] adaptive [[hydraulic]] suspension system with self leveling, payload leveling and trailer load leveling replaced the pneumatic system. Both systems can automatically detect when a heavy trailer is coupled, such as a [[travel trailer]], and level the load. Additional ride-height sensors placed on the left and right sides of the SUV also monitor and compensate for any [[List (watercraft)|listing]] caused by improper cargo loading. This keeps the Expedition running straight and level while towing, and at night helps to keep the Expedition's headlamps from blinding oncoming traffic.

==Special Service Vehicle==

To compete with large police SUVs that are sold by other automobile companies, primarily the [[Chevrolet Suburban]], Ford has made a special version of the Expedition available to [[law enforcement agencies]], [[Firefighting worldwide|fire departments]], and [[Emergency medical services|EMS agencies]]. Ford calls it the '''''Expedition Special Service Vehicle''''' (SSV). The only differences between the standard Expedition and the Special Service Vehicle Expedition are provisions for emergency services related equipment such as [[Walkie talkie|radio]]s, [[lightbar]]s, and [[Siren (noisemaker)|siren]]s.

With the fourth generation Expedition (2018–present) debuting in 2017, Ford announced that the standard size version will be sold to government agencies and law enforcement, available in the lower based XL trim only.

==Funkmaster Flex edition==
[[File:'08 Ford Expedition Funkmaster Flex Edition (Montreal).jpg|thumb|Ford Expedition Funkmaster Flex special edition]]
2008 was the only year for the [[Funkmaster Flex]] special edition Expedition. In 2005, [[Ford Motor Company]] teamed up with rapper and [[New York City]] [[radio personality]] Funkmaster Flex in a multi-year partnership to create a series of special edition Ford vehicles and advertise the Ford brand. One of those creations was a 2008 Ford Expedition bearing the rapper's name. This limited production Expedition featured a special Colorado Red and black two-tone paint job with orange pinstriping, 20 inch chrome wheels, 3D Carbon body kit, Funkmaster Flex badging and a custom black and Colorado Red leather interior on top of Expedition ''Limited'' standard equipment. The FMF Expedition went on sale in the fall of 2007 and production was limited to 650 units total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuningnews.net/news/061031b/ford-expedition-funkmaster-flex.jpg |title=Ford Expedition Funkmaster Flex Edition |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideline.com/ford/expedition/2008/follow-up-test-2008-ford-expedition-funkmaster-flex-edition.html |title=2008 Ford Expedition Funkmaster Flex Edition Follow-Up Test |publisher=Insideline.com |date=2008-02-15 |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[Motor Trend]]'' gave the 2018 Expedition a good review in its February 14, 2018 article, in which they cite the vehicle’s “blend of performance (both on- and off-road), comfort, utility, and tech [that] easily make it the new benchmark for the full-size SUV class.” However the review notes that there were a few drawbacks in terms of hp acceleration (coming in second to the 2018 [[Nissan Armada]] but ahead of the 2018 [[Chevrolet Tahoe]]), off-road performance, and its MPG estimate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/expedition/2018/2018-ford-expedition-first-test-review/ “2018 FORD EXPEDITION FIRST TEST: TA-WHO?”] from [[Motor Trend]] (February 14, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 Expedition also ranked first among large SUVs with a score of 9.3 from [[U.S. News and World Report]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/ford/expedition “2018 Ford Expedition”] from [[U.S. News and World Report]] (February 5, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The fourth generation Ford Expedition was nominated at the 2018 [[North American International Auto Show]] in the Truck of the Year category, only to lose out to its co-branded cousin Lincoln Navigator. The Expedition was runner-up.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.autoblog.com/2018/01/15/honda-accord-volvo-xc60-lincoln-navigator-2018-nactoy-winners/?hcid=ab-around-ab-tile-8 “Honda, Volvo, Lincoln are North American Car, Utility and Truck of the Year”] from Autoblog (January 15, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''G2ZT''' is a [[tetrazole|bistetrazole]].  It is an explosive approximately as powerful as [[RDX]], but it releases less toxic reaction products when detonated: [[ammonia]] and [[hydrogen cyanide]].  When combined with [[ammonium dinitramide|ADN]] or [[ammonium nitrate|AN]] oxidizers, the amount of [[hydrogen cyanide|HCN]] produced by a deflagration may be reduced.  The compound is thus considered by its advocates to be an [[environmentally friendlier]] explosive than traditional [[nitroamine|nitroamine-based]] explosives.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Charles. "[http://www.livescience.com/technology/080527-friendly-bombs.html Environmentally Friendly Bombs Planned]", Live Science, May 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''G2ZT''' is otherwise known as bis(3,4,5-triamino-1,2,4-triazolium) 5,5'-azotetrazolate.

'''Gas South''', based in Atlanta, Georgia, is a [[natural gas]] provider that serves more than 300,000 residential, commercial and governmental customers in Georgia, Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gas South Rates: Available in Georgia and Florida|url=https://www.saveonenergy.com/gas-south/|website=Save On Energy|publisher=Save On Energy, LLC|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company==
Gas South began operations in 2006 as a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Cobb Electric Membership Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of Gas South, LLC|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=26470942|website=Bloomberg Business|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia’s natural gas industry was partially deregulated in 1997&lt;ref name="Georgia Public Service Commission"&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Gas: Competition in Georgia|url=http://www.psc.state.ga.us/gas/ngdereg.asp|website=Georgia Public Service Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the passing of the Natural Gas Competition and Deregulation Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atlanta Gas Companies|url=http://www.greatamericancountry.com/places/local-life/atlanta-gas-companies|website=Great American Country|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, giving commercial and residential customers in many parts of the state a range of options. Under deregulation, the local distribution company, [[Atlanta Gas Light Company]] (AGLC), elected to no longer serve as a retail gas supplier and instead solely maintain and operate the distribution system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brodrick|first1=Brian|title=Atlanta Gas Light Company|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/business-economy/atlanta-gas-light-company|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia|accessdate=20 November 2015|date=10 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tate|first1=James H|title=Keeper of the Flame: The Story of Atlanta Gas Light Company|date=1985|publisher=Atlanta Gas Light Company|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; AGL is responsible for ensuring gas delivery, managing storage assets and transportation services on behalf of natural gas marketers. In turn, natural gas marketers sell gas directly to retail customers on a competitive basis.

On September 1, 2016, Gas South increased the minimum wage for all employees to $15.00 per hour, well above the $5.15 per hour required by the state of Georgia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/local/cobb-based-gas-south-starts-minimum-wage-for-all-employees-tomorrow/vwmp0bo8QVfi9XTaLCan3M/|title=Cobb-based Gas South starts $15 minimum wage for all employees...|last=Brasch|first=Ben|website=ajc|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.11alive.com/news/local/georgia-company-raises-minimum-wage-to-15/310502983|title=Georgia company raises minimum wage to $15|last=TEGNA|newspaper=WXIA|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mdjonline.com/news/gas-south-commits-to-minimum-wage-for-all-employees/article_a9baad7c-746f-11e6-9221-9b58222b737d.html|title=Gas South commits to $15 minimum wage for all employees|last=Staff|first=MDJ|newspaper=MDJOnline.com|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was recognized as a Best Places to Work company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://midtown.businessradiox.com/2016/04/15/gas-south-hr-value-partners-young-presidents-organization/|title=Gas South, HR Value Partners, and Young Presidents Organization|date=2016-04-15|website=Midtown Business Radio|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manon Brochu, Gas South's Vice President, serves on the advisory board for the Salvation Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://patch.com/georgia/cascade/gas-south-vice-president-appointed-to-salvation-army-advisory-board_4e174c54|title=Gas South Vice President Appointed to Salvation Army Advisory Board|newspaper=Cascade, GA Patch|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009, Gas South has donated more than $200,000 to the United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta and the Salvation Army’s Project SHARE though its partnership with the Atlanta Braves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mdjonline.com/news/gas-south-to-be-suntrust-park-s-natural-gas-provider/article_2e2a3141-fc8a-559a-bd0d-48d547b2d456.html|title=Gas South to be SunTrust Park’s natural gas provider|last=Staff|first=MDJ|newspaper=MDJOnline.com|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gas South also partners with the Buckhead Coalition to generate sustainable funding for the Shepherd Center.&lt;ref name="Shepherd Center"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shepherd Center to benefit from Partnership between Buckhead Coalition and Gas South|url=https://news.shepherd.org/shepherd-center-to-benefit-from-partnership-between-buckhead-coalition-and-gas-south/|website=Shepherd Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the monument in Bolivia|the archaeological site in Peru|Inti Punku}}
{{Refimprove|date=July 2009}}
The '''Gate of the Sun''' is a megalithic solid stone arch or gateway constructed by the ancient [[Tiwanaku]] culture of Bolivia.&lt;ref name="Stone-Miller"&gt;{{cite book |title=Art Of The Andes|last=Stone-Miller| first=Rebecca.|authorlink=Rebecca Stone-Miller|date= March 1996| isbn=978-0-500-20286-9| publisher=[[Thames &amp; Hudson]]| url=https://www.amazon.com/Art-Andes-World-Rebecca-Stone-Miller/dp/0500202869| accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is located near Lake [[Titicaca]] at about {{convert|12549.2|ft|m|abbr=on}} above sea level near [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]]. The object is approximately {{convert|9.8|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|13|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, and is constructed from a single piece of stone. The weight is estimated to be 10 tons.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Cajías de la Vega, ''La enseñanza de la historia : Bolivia'', Convenio Andrés Bello, 1999,[https://books.google.com/books?id=4PROZA7uOdAC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=%22puerta%20del%20sol%22%20%22andesita%22%20%2210%20toneladas%22 p.44].&lt;/ref&gt; When rediscovered by European explorers in the mid-19th century, the megalith was lying horizontally and had a large crack through it.  It presently stands in the location where it was found, although it is believed that this is not its original site, which remains uncertain.&lt;ref name="Kolata"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Tiwanaku: Portrait of an Andean Civilization |last=Kolata| first=Alan L.|authorlink=Alan Kolata |date=December 15, 1993| isbn=978-1-55786-183-2| publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]| url=https://www.amazon.com/Tiwanaku-Portrait-Civilization-Peoples-America/dp/1557861838| accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some elements of Tiwanaku iconography spread throughout [[Peru]] and parts of Bolivia.  Although there have been various modern interpretations of the mysterious inscriptions found on the object, the carvings that decorate the gate are believed to possess astronomical and/or astrological significance and may have served a calendrical purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Magli, Giulio.  Mysteries and discoveries of archaeoastronomy: From Giza to Easter Island.  English trans.  NY: Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Figures ==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:viracochaP.jpg|thumb|left|"Central figure on the Gate"]] --&gt;
The lintel is carved with 48 squares surrounding a central figure. Each square represents a character in the form of winged [[effigy]]. There are 32 effigies with human faces and 16 with condors' heads. All look to the central motif: the figure of a man with his head surrounded by 24 linear rays, which may represent rays of the sun. The styled staffs held by the figure apparently symbolize thunder and lightning. Some historians and archaeologists believe that the central figure represents the “[[Sun God]]” and others have linked it with the Inca god [[Viracocha]].

[[File:Gee-haw whammy diddle.gif|thumb|Spinning gee-haw whammy diddle]]
[[Image:GeeHawWhimmyDiddle.JPG|thumb|right|210px|The gee-haw whammy diddle.]]&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image: Gee-Haw Whammy Diddle.jpg|thumb|right|210px|The gee-haw whammy diddle.]]  --&gt;
A '''gee-haw whammy diddle''' is a [[Mechanical system|mechanical]] toy consisting of two wooden sticks. One has a series of notches cut transversely along its side and a smaller wooden stick or a [[propeller]] attached to the end with a nail or pin. This stick is held stationary in one hand with the notches up, and the other stick is rubbed rapidly back and forth across the notches. This causes the propeller to rotate. Sometimes also known as a '''[[ouija]] windmill''', a '''hoodoo stick''' or a '''VooDoo stick'''. The word ''whammy'' is sometimes ''whimmy'' and the word ''diddle'' sometimes ''doodle'', giving it three possible other names, and the ''gee-haw'' may also be dropped.

''[[Gee and haw|Gee-haw]]'' refers to the fact that, by rubbing your finger against the notched stick while rubbing, the direction of the spinning propeller may be reversed. The operator may do this surreptitiously and yell "gee" or "haw" to make it appear that the propeller is reacting to the commands. If you call it a ''hooey stick'', you would yell "hooey" each time you want the direction to change.

==Physical explanation==
The nail holding the propeller must pass through a hole of approximately twice its diameter, essentially a twirling hoop on a stick.  The side force of the finger or thumb on the notched stick forces it to the side as each notch is hit thus giving it a repeating side jump to pivot the propeller in one direction or the other. A nicely balanced propeller will spin just fine and it actually is not critical to have it heavy to one side, because the hole diameter always allows one side (slightly longer) to drop during the jerking motion which occurs. 
To observe the effect, the propeller attached to the end of the ribbed stick must not be pinned at its exact [[centre of mass]], i.e. off-center or loose. For a functioning whammy diddle, there should be a "preferred" [[angle]] (i.e. when stationary, if the propeller is rotated around its axis and then released, it should return to its lowest-energy [[rest angle]] relative to the ribbed stick.) Rubbing the ribbed stick with another stick along the grooves creates a vertical alternating driving [[force]] &lt;math&gt;F_y&lt;/math&gt; acting on the centre of mass of the propeller:

:&lt;math&gt; F_y(t) = Y cos(\omega t) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \omega = 2\pi/T &lt;/math&gt; and T is the time taken for the stick to move from one groove to the next; &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is some unknown scaling factor that characterizes the force with which the two sticks are pressed against one another. By rubbing a finger against these grooves on the side, one can also introduce a ''horizonal'' alternating driving force &lt;math&gt;F_x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; F_x(t) = X cos(\omega t + \phi) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a [[phase shift]] (describing the lag time between when the grooves contacts the moving rod, and finger respectively) and, again, X is some unknown scaling factor. Importantly, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the ''same'' frequency, and the two driving forces are said to be [[phase locked loop|phase locked]]. The confluence of two phase matched driving forces in [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] directions gives rise to a [[rotational force]] on the centre of mass at the propeller end, and thus, rotation.

When the operator of the whammy-diddle surreptitiously changes the side at which his/her finger contacts the stick (e.g. by contacting with his thumb instead of his fore-finger, or by changing the side at which a finger contacts the grooves of the base) he or she changes the sign of the phase &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, and thus reverses the rotation.

The green chain's purpose is to collect the final product of the mill and move it at a controlled rate to be graded and sorted.&lt;ref&gt;''Australian forest industries journal''. vol. 44 Sydney: Australian Forest Industries Journal Pty. Ltd., 1978. 41. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th and early to late 20th century, the green chain was used by people. Men would stand alongside and pull lumber that matches the required dimensions and place it in piles. In short, the workers sorted the lumber. Modern [[sawmill]]s use automatic systems, such as the lumber dropping through the chain into large slings, where it can be picked up and moved to a staging area to dry. Most likely called the green chain because the lumber is green and has not been seasoned.

'''Isothermal transformation diagrams''' (also known as time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagrams) are plots of temperature versus time (usually on a [[logarithmic scale]]). They are generated from percentage transformation-vs  time measurements, and are useful for understanding the transformations of an [[alloy steel]] at elevated temperatures.  

An isothermal transformation diagram is only valid for one specific composition of material, and only if the temperature is held constant during the transformation, and strictly with rapid cooling to that temperature.  Though usually used to represent transformation kinetics for steels, they also can be used to describe the kinetics of [[crystallization]] in ceramic or other materials. Time-temperature-precipitation diagrams and time-temperature-embrittlement diagrams have also been used to represent kinetic changes in steels.

'''Isothermal transformation''' (IT) diagram or the C-curve is associated with mechanical properties,microconstituents/microstructures, and heat treatments in carbon steels. Diffusional transformations like [[austenite]] transforming to a [[cementite]] and [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] mixture can be explained using the sigmoidal curve; for example the beginning of pearlitic transformation is represented by the pearlite start (P&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) curve. This transformation is complete at P&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; curve. Nucleation requires an incubation time. The rate of nucleation increases and the rate of microconstituent growth decreases as the temperature decreases from the liquidus temperature reaching a maximum at the bay or nose of the curve. Thereafter, the decrease in diffusion rate  due to low temperature offsets the effect of increased driving force due to greater difference in [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]. As a result of the transformation, the microconstituents, [[Pearlite]] and [[Bainite]], form; Pearlite forms at higher temperatures and bainite at lower.

Austenite is slightly undercooled when quenched below [[Eutectic system|Eutectoid]] temperature. When given more time, stable microconstituents can form: ferrite and cementite. Coarse pearlite is produced when atoms diffuse rapidly after phases that form pearlite nucleate. This transformation is complete at the pearlite finish time (P&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;).

However, greater undercooling by rapid quenching results in formation of martensite or bainite instead of pearlite. This is possible provided the cooling rate is such that the cooling curve intersects the martensite start temperature or the bainite start curve before intersecting the P&lt;sub&gt;s &lt;/sub&gt;curve. The martensite transformation being a diffusionless shear transformation is represented by a straight line to signify the martensite start temperature.

'''Marklund convection''', named after Göran Marklund, is a convection process that takes place in filamentary currents of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. It occurs within a plasma with an associated electric field, that causes convection of ions and electrons inward towards a central twisting filamentary axis. A temperature gradient within the plasma will also cause chemical separation based on different ionization potentials.&lt;ref name="Marklund's paper"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Plasma convection in force-free magnetic fields as a mechanism for chemical separation in cosmical plasma | author=Marklund, Göran | journal=Nature |date=February 1979 | volume=277 | issue=5695 | pages=370–371|bibcode = 1979Natur.277..370M |doi = 10.1038/277370b0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
In Marklund's paper, the plasma convects radially inwards towards the center of a cylindrical flux tube. During this convection, the different chemical constituents of the plasma, each having its specific ionization potential, enters into a progressively cooler region. The plasma constituents will recombine and become neutral, and thus no longer under the influence of the electromagnetic forcing. The ionization potentials will thus determine where the different chemicals  will be deposited.&lt;ref name="Marklund's paper"/&gt;
 
This provides an efficient means to accumulate matter within a plasma.&lt;ref name="Physics of the Plasma Universe"&gt;{{cite book | title=Physics of the Plasma Universe | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | author=Peratt, Anthony | date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a partially ionized plasma, electromagnetic forces act on the non-ionized material indirectly through the viscosity between the ionized and non-ionized material.
 
[[Hannes Alfvén]] showed that elements with the lowest ionization potential are brought closest to the axis, and form concentric hollow cylinders whose radii increase with ionization potential. The drift of ionized matter from the surroundings into the rope means that the rope acts as an [[ion pump]], which evacuates surrounding regions, producing areas of extremely low density.&lt;ref name="Cosmic Plasma"&gt;{{cite book | title=Cosmic Plasma | author=Alfvén, Hannes | date=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Minnedosa Ethanol Plant''' is an [[ethanol]] plant located in [[Minnedosa, Manitoba|Minnedosa]], [[Manitoba]]. The plant is owned by [[Husky Energy]] and produces 130 million litres of [[ethanol]] per year. In Canada, ethanol is blended into gasoline. The plant feedstock for the facility is non-food feed-grade wheat purchased from local growers. However, the plant is also capable of using corn as a feed-stock. The feed-stock is milled, cooked, fermented, distilled and dehydrated resulting in ethanol fuel and the remaining waste material is processed into a high protein feed 
supplement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huskyenergy.com/downloads/abouthusky/publications/factsheets/FS_2009_Ethanol.pdf Plant Overview ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The new plant came on line in 2008 replacing an older plant on the site that from 1981 had produced 10 million litres of ethanol 
annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huskyenergy.com/downloads/newsreleases/2008/HSE_042508_Minnedosa_Opening.pdf Plant comes online]&lt;/ref&gt;  The plant was constructed by [[PCL Construction|PCL Industrial Constructors]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://industrial.pcl.com/projects/Active/1500535/index.aspx PCL Overview of Project ]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1957 Dallas multi-vortex 1 edited.JPG|thumb|A multiple-vortex [[tornado]] outside [[Dallas, Texas]] on April 2, 1957.]]
A '''multiple-vortex tornado''' is a [[tornado]] that contains several vortices (called subvortices or suction vortices) rotating around, ''inside'' of, and as part of the main [[vortex]]. The only times multiple vortices may be visible are when the tornado is first forming or when condensation and debris is balanced enough so that subvortices are apparent without being obscured. They can add over 100&amp;nbsp;mph to the ground-relative wind in a tornado circulation, and are responsible for most (if not all) cases where narrow arcs of extreme destruction lie right next to weak damage within tornado paths.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crh.noaa.gov/images/pah/pdf/elite/EliteSpotterWorkshopSlidesSection3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==
Suction vortices (or suction spots) are really substructures of many, perhaps all, tornadoes but are not always easily visible.  These occur, usually, at the base of the tornado vortex where the tornado makes contact with the surface.  Subvortices tend to form after vortex breakdown reaches the surface and are resultant from the ratio of cyclonically incoming and rising air motions. Multivortex structure is not unique to tornadoes, occurring in other circulations such as [[dust devil]]s, but is a natural result of the physics of [[vortex]] dynamics.

Multivortex tornadoes should not be confused with cyclically tornadic [[supercell]]s. These systems can have the tendency to produce many, and very separate tornadoes, called [[tornado family|tornado families]], existing either at the same time or in succession. A phenomenon similar in nature to multiple vortices is the [[satellite tornado]]. It is different from a multiple-vortex tornado in that it exists ''outside'' of the main tornado and forms via a different mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crh.noaa.gov/images/pah/pdf/elite/EliteSpotterWorkshopSlidesSection3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable multiple-vortex tornadoes==
The destructive May 2011 [[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF5]] [[2011 Joplin tornado|Joplin tornado]] was an example of a multiple-vortex tornado.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2011/05/joplin_missouri_tornado_was_ra.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest tornado ever documented was a multiple-vortex tornado; it struck [[El Reno, Oklahoma]] on [[2013 El Reno tornado|May 31, 2013]] taking the lives of tornado researcher [[Tim Samaras]], his son Paul, and their [[TWISTEX]] colleague, Carl Young. This storm also took the life of local amateur chaser, Richard Henderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Clay, Nolan |publisher=''[[The Oklahoman]]''|date=June 3, 2013|accessdate=June 4, 2013|title=Oklahoma storms: Amateur storm chaser took photo of tornado that killed him|url=http://newsok.com/article/3841315}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a maximum width of {{convert|2.6|mi|km|}} and a maximum recorded windspeed of at least {{convert|296|mph|kph|}}, however, due to a lack of property damage, the tornado achieved a rating of EF3 on the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]]. Nevertheless, the El Reno tornado is one of the two strongest tornadoes ever recorded in terms of maximum wind speeds, the other being the [[1999 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado]].&lt;ref&gt;https://extremeplanet.me/2012/09/23/analysis-of-the-1999-bridge-creek-f5-tornado/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Neckartal Dam''' is a dam under construction in the [[ǁKaras Region]] of southern [[Namibia]]. It is a [[curved gravity dam]] on the [[Fish River (Namibia)|Fish River]] near [[Berseba, Namibia|Berseba]], {{circa}} {{Convert|40|km}} northwest of the regional capital [[Keetmanshoop]]. Construction started in 2013 and was initially expected to finish in 2017. Once completed, it will be the largest dam in Namibia, almost three times the capacity of the [[Hardap Dam]] upstream. The dam's purpose is to support a {{Convert|5000|ha}} [[irrigation scheme]] nearby.&lt;ref name=bloom&gt;{{Cite web | title=Neckartal Dam: Making a Desert Bloom | publisher=[[Salini Impregilo]] | date=7 April 2016 | url=https://www.webuildvalue.com/en/works-and-projects/neckartal-dam-making-a-desert-bloom.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The idea to construct a dam near Keetmanshoop already came up during the [[German South West Africa|German colonialisation]]. Upon [[Independence of Namibia|Namibian independence]] in 1990, the planning slowly started.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt; Although hailed as a promising job creation project, particularly after commission due to the purpose as an irrigation dam, there were doubts over the necessity to build it. [[Naute Dam]] in the same area, likewise an irrigation dam, is under-utilised. However, for an irrigation scheme of {{Convert|5000|ha}} as envisaged for the Neckartal Dam, Naute Dam was deemed too small.&lt;ref name=questioned&gt;{{Cite news | title=Neckartal Dam questioned | last=Cloete | first=Luqman | newspaper=[[The Namibian]] | date=8 January 2010 | page=1 | url=http://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=61448&amp;page=archive-read}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian company [[Salini Impregilo]] was awarded the 2.8 billion [[N$]] tender to build the dam in March 2012. After a legal challenge by one competitor, the tender was withdrawn but reawarded to the same company in August 2013. Construction started it within a month. Originally planned to take 3 years, the project has been delayed by a court case and labour unrest. It is now expected to be completed in 2017, after which the filling-up phase will last another two years.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;&lt;ref name=44%&gt;{{Cite news | title=Neckartal Dam 44% complete | newspaper=[[The Namibian]] | date=4 February 2016 | page=5 | url=http://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?page=archive-read&amp;id=147006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Old generator.jpg|thumb|Typical diesel generator widely used in Nigeria due to lack of supply from the grid.]]
The [[Nigeria]]n energy supply crisis refers to the ongoing failure of the Nigerian power sector to provide adequate electricity supply to domestic households and industrial producers despite a rapidly growing economy, some of the world's [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|largest deposits of coal, oil and gas]] and the country's status as Africa's largest oil producer. Currently only 40% of Nigeria's population is connected to the energy grid whilst power supply difficulties are experienced around 60% of the time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Aliyu, A., Ramli, A., Saleh, M. (2013). Nigeria electricity crisis: Power generation capacity expansion and environmental ramifications. Energy, 61(8), 354-367. {{doi|10.1016/j.energy.2013.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At best, average daily power supply is estimated at four hours,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author= |author-link= |authors= |date=2016 |title=PwC’s Annual Power and Utilities Roundtable: The challenges with transforming the Nigerian power landscape |url=https://www.pwc.com/ng/en/assets/pdf/power-roundtable-2016.pdf|publisher=PWC |page=4 |docket= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although several days can go by without any power at all.

Power supply difficulties cripple the agricultural, industrial and mining sectors&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaseke, N., Hosking, S. (2013).

Retrieved February 21, 2014, from Project MUSE database.&lt;/ref&gt; and impede the Nigeria's ongoing economic development. The energy supply crisis is complex, stems from a variety of issues and has been ongoing for decades. Most Nigerian businesses and households that can afford to do so run one or more diesel-fueled generators to supplement the intermittent supply.

Since 2005, Nigerian power reforms have focused on privatizing the generator and distribution assets and encouraging private investment in the power sector. The government continues to control transmission assets whilst making "modest progress" in creating a regulatory environment attractive to foreign investors.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Political Economy of Clean Energy Transitions|last=Ogunleye|first=Eric Kehinde|publisher=Oxford Scholarship Online|year=2017|isbn=9780198802242|location=|pages=|chapter=Political Economy of Nigerian Power Sector Reform}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minor increases in average daily power supply have been reported.

==Background==
Until the power sector reforms of 2005, power supply and transmission was the sole responsibility of the Nigerian federal government.

As of 2012, Nigeria generated approximately 4,000 - 5,000 megawatts of power for a population of 150 million people as compared with Africa's second largest economy, South Africa, which generated 40,000 megawatts of power for a population of 62 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/africa/2012/06/16431.html|title=Explaining Nigeria's energy crisis|last=Ndgege|first=Yvonne|date=14 June 2012|work=Al Jazeera|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 14 - 20 gigawatts of power is provided by private generators to make up for the shortfall.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.africa-eu-renewables.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/captive_power_in_Nigeria.pdf|title=Captive Power in Nigeria: A Comprehensive Guide to Project Development|last=|first=|date=2015|work=Africa-EU Renewable Energy Cooperation Program|access-date=7 May 2008|publisher=European Union Energy Initiative Partnership Dialogue Facility}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nigeria has a theoretical capacity of more than 10,000 megawatt generation capacity using existing infrastructure, but has never reached close to that potential.

96% of industry energy consumption is produced off-grid using private generators.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Issues affect all areas of the sector, from generation to transmission to distribution.

Currently the only plan the government has in place to help solve the energy crisis is to expand the fossil fuel burning sector. Alternative forms of energy are not used probably because of availability of oil in Nigeria, as it has the world’s seventh largest oil reserves.

== History of the Power Sector ==

* 1886 - First two power generators installed in the Colony of Lagos
* 1951 - Act of Parliament establishes the Electricity Corporation of Nigeria (ECN)
* 1962 - The Niger DamsAuthority (NDA) was also established for the development of hydroelectric power
* 1972 - Merger of ECN and NDA to create the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) 
* 2005 - Following reforms, the NEPA was renamed Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN). The Electric Power Sector Reform (EPSR) Act was enacted allowing private investment in electricity generation, transmission, and distribution.
* November 2005, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) was inaugurated and charged with the responsibility of tariffs regulation and monitoring of the quality of services of the PHCN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Okoro|first=O.I.|last2=Govender|first2=Poobalan|last3=Chikuni|first3=Edward|date=August 2007|title=Power sector reforms in Nigeria: Opportunities and challenges|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237825169_Power_sector_reforms_in_Nigeria_Opportunities_and_challenges|journal=Journal of Energy in Southern Africa|volume=18|issue=3|pages=52–57|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* February 1, 2015 - The Transitional Electricity Market (TEM) announced

== Current Challenges ==

=== Power Generators ===
The most efficient location for new power plants is the Niger Delta region due to the easy access to the sources of energy needed to run the plants. Currently however, a [[Conflict in the Niger Delta|security crisis in the region]] involving armed militias makes it an unattractive location for foreign investment in power.

=== Transmission Network ===
Post-reforms the transmission network continues to be government owned and operated and remains the weakest link in the power sector supply chain. Transmission lines are old and at the point of system collapse on any given day.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Even should more power be generated, the transmission network is unable to carry any additional power loading. Designed for a peak capacity of only 3,000 to 3,500MW per day breakdown of the lines is a daily occurrence. Lack of maintenance and security challenges in parts of the country only add to the difficulties.

==Current State of Energy Production==
Currently Nigeria uses four different types of energy: natural gas, oil, hydro and coal&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The energy sector is heavily dependent on petroleum as a method for electricity production which has slowed down the development of alternative forms of energy. Three out of the four above resources used for energy production in Nigeria are linked with increasing greenhouse gas emissions: coal, oil and natural gas, with coal emitting the worst of the three.

See table below for summary of the environmental impacts of the sources of electricity.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Percent of resource used for electricity production !! Coal (0.4%) !! Oil (24.8%) !! Natural Gas (39.8%)!! Hydro (35.6%)
|-
| Benefits || Nigeria has a large natural supply of this fossil fuel making it relativity easy to access and it would be the cheapest resource to develop into energy plants (Gujba, Mulugetta &amp; Azapagic, 2011). || Nigeria has a large supply of oil, seventh largest in the world and this makes it readily available for use as a source for electricity (Ejiogu, 2012). || Natural gas is now being mined by unconventional means (‘fracking’) which seems to have greenhouse gas emissions then former means of production. It has less greenhouse gas emissions then coal as well&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Hultman, N., Rebois, D., Scholten, M., &amp; Ramig, C. (2011). The greenhouse impact of unconventional gas for electricity generation. Environmental Research Letters, 6(4), 044008. {{doi|10.1088/1748-9326/6/4/044008}}&lt;/ref&gt; || Hydro is more environmentally friendly because it uses a renewable resource that is associated with less greenhouse emissions after initial development (Middleton, 2013).
|-
| Environmental Impacts || Black carbon emissions are shown to have detrimental effects on the environment because of their light absorbing qualities. The theory is that when black carbon lands on snow and ice, the reflective properties of ice are decreased and more melting occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Novakov, T., Rosen, H. (2013). The Black Carbon Story: Early History and New Perspectives. Ambrio. 42(7) {{doi|10.1007/s13280-013-0392-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; || Environmental impacts of oil production can be measured by the energy needed to produce and refine the oil, pipeline sabotage and spills from local residents resulting in water, air and land pollution (US Energy Administration, 2013). This does not even account for the emissions created from burning the oil afterward (Ejiogu, 2013). || Conventional and unconventional mining of natural gas potentially leaks large amounts of methane into the atmosphere which is a strong greenhouse gas emitter&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; || Carbon dioxide an methane are emitted from the area holding the water because of the vegetation decay in the area, especially in the first ten years. So for the amount of electricity generated, sometimes the amount of carbon emitted is the same (Middleton, 2013).
|-
| Barriers || Current policy discourages carbon emissions in Nigeria and there is a movement towards cleaner energy (Aliyu, Ramli &amp; Saleh, 2013).   || The barriers are all in relation to the lack of control that Nigeria has over the area where the oil is produced, causing a lack of access (US Energy Administration, 2013).	 || No barriers to natural gas as it is easy cheap to produce and Nigeria has a large supply of it.	 || Hydro power disrupts the water levels of the river and would cause tension with the neighbours of Nigeria. Post building some of the dams flood the surrounding communities (Aliyu, Ramli &amp; Saleh, 2013).

According to the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) the importance of sustainability in energy is: the ability to preserve its use, the importance of energy in living standards and for economic development and the significant impacts that energy systems and processes have had and continue to have on the environment (WCED, 1987). Nigeria needs to invest in sustainable resources because of the obvious signs that it will be strongly impacted by environmental change such as: desertification, droughts, flooding, and water shortages. The biggest blow to Nigeria would be the low-lying areas that contain many of their natural resources being flooded if ocean levels rise as predicted (Gujba, Mulugetta &amp; Azapagic, 2011).
Since further development of hydro-electricity does not seem practical because of the dependence on the seasons for amount of water supply (Ajayi, 2009). Wind energy has potential, but is unreliable for consistent energy supply. Nuclear energy could be a viable solution to the energy problem because of its lack of emissions and reliability. Nigeria also has easy access to the uranium needed for the plants (Ejiogu, 2013).

==Environmental Solutions==
In light of all this, there is a lot of literature surrounding different proposals of what might be done to help Nigeria develop their potential for renewable electricity. Development of the renewable sources energy is important for the future of world. Nigeria has been in an energy crisis for a decade despite numerous attempts to reform the energy sector (Ejiogu, 2012). The only thing that remains is to figure out which energy source is most practical for Nigeria.
Development of hydro-electricity does not seem practical because of the dependence on the seasons for amount of water supply&lt;ref&gt;Ajayi, O. (2009). Assessment of utilization of wind energy resources in Nigeria. Energy Policy 38 (2). Retrieved from: {{doi|10.1016/j.enpol.2008.10.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the amount of greenhouse gases it emits in the first 10 years of being built (Middleton, 2013). Wind energy has potential, but is unreliable for consistent energy supply.

Two fields of arguments:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Nuclear Energy!! Wind Energy
|-
| Benefits || Increased amount of electricity would be generated, which would grow the local economy (Ejiogu, 2013). Less greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels and hydro power (Middleton, 2013).	 || Wind is shown to be the cleanest form of energy production.&lt;ref&gt;World Nuclear Association (2011). World Nuclear Association Report, Comparison of Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of various electricity generation sources. London, England: Author&lt;/ref&gt; 
|-
| Barriers || Government corruption has led to the cancelling of multiple nuclear energy development contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-09-01|title=Climate change mitigation and renewable energy for sustainable development in Nigeria: A discourse approach|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032117303544|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|language=en|volume=76|pages=72–80|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2017.03.040|issn=1364-0321}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
•	The power plant currently proposed would output around 10% of the country’s power which is twice as much as recommended. 
•	Nuclear energy also requires a stable energy grid to be maintained and that independent off site power is needed, which Nigeria does not have.
•	Proposed sites for plants are in unstable areas where the Nigerian government does not have control of the workings of the militant groups. 
(Ejiogu, 2013). || Commercial energy production based on wind is limited because of variation in seasons and the speed of the winds (Ajayi, 2009)
•	Relativity cheap because of cost reduction every year (Gujba, Mulugetta &amp; Azapagic, 2011)
•	Areas that had high potential for wind turbines are in the north part of Nigeria, which is the area with the least development of the power grid.&lt;ref&gt;Global Energy Network Institute (2014). Nigerian National Energy Grid. Retrieved from: http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/library/national_energy_grid/nigeria/nigeriannationalelectricitygrid.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; 
(Ajayi, 2009)
|}

The most practical solution was mentioned by Gujba, Mulugetta and Azapagic, (2011). The authors of this article suggested that a harmonization of different forms of energy take place. In their sustainable development scenario they suggested some reliance on renewable energy sources and a slow change from fossil fuels to the renewable energy sources. Since the rural areas are further from the electricity grid and most currently do not have power, each area would become a little hub where they would produce their own power by whatever resource was closest. For example, in the northern areas the mini-grids would work off of wind and solar power energy. Hydropower development would have to increase in order for this to be successful.  
Winkler, Howells and Baumert (2002) talk about envisioning where a country wants to end up before the development of energy resources. This is a great perspective about how to fix the energy crisis because taking the big picture into account before the development of the sector could include things outside of simply fixing the energy crisis such as: poverty eradication, job creation, reducing carbon emissions etc.  Fixing the energy supply will solve many problems such as the over pricing of electricity due to the loss of the electricity within the grid (Winkler, Howells &amp; Baumert, 2002)

'''Oganesson''' is a synthetic [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Og''' and [[atomic number]] 118. It was first synthesized in 2002 at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) in [[Dubna]], Russia by a joint team of Russian and American scientists. In December 2015, it was recognized as one of four new elements by the [[IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party|Joint Working Party]] of the international scientific bodies [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] and [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics|IUPAP]]. It was formally named on 28 November 2016.&lt;ref name="IUPAC-20161130"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff

Oganesson has the highest atomic number and highest [[atomic mass]] of all known elements. The [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] oganesson atom is very unstable, and since 2005, only five (possibly six) atoms of the [[isotopes of oganesson|nuclide &lt;sup&gt;294&lt;/sup&gt;Og]] have been detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2007/jan/physics/article_view?b_start:int=1&amp;-C=|title=The Top 6 Physics Stories of 2006|accessdate=18 January 2008|date=7 January 2007|publisher=Discover Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this allowed very little experimental characterization of its properties and possible [[Chemical compound|compounds]], theoretical calculations have resulted in many predictions, including some surprising ones. For example, although oganesson is a member of [[Group 18 element|group&amp;nbsp;18]] – the first synthetic element to be so – it may be significantly reactive, unlike all the other elements of that group (the [[noble gas]]es).&lt;ref name=Nash2005/&gt; It was formerly thought to be a gas under [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure|normal conditions]] but is now predicted to be a [[solid]] due to [[Relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]].&lt;ref name=Nash2005/&gt; On the [[periodic table (standard)|periodic table]] of the elements it is a [[p-block]] element and the last one of the [[period 7|7th period]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of chemical element discoveries}}

=== Early speculation ===
The Danish physicist [[Niels Bohr]] was the first to seriously consider the possibility of an element with an atomic number as high as 118, noting in 1922 that such an element would take its place in the periodic table below [[radon]] as the seventh noble gas.&lt;ref name=leach&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meta-synthesis.com/webbook/35_pt/pt_database.php?PT_id=285 |title=The INTERNET Database of Periodic Tables |author=Leach, Mark R. |accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, [[Aristid von Grosse]] wrote an article in 1965 predicting the likely properties of element 118. These were remarkably early predictions, given that it was not yet known how to produce elements artificially in 1922, and that the existence of the [[island of stability]] had not yet been theorized in 1965. It was 80 years from Bohr's prediction before oganesson was successfully synthesised, although its chemical properties have not been investigated to determine if it behaves as the heavier congener of radon.&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt;

===Unconfirmed discovery claims===
In late 1998, Polish physicist [[Robert Smolańczuk]] published calculations on the fusion of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of [[superheavy element|superheavy atoms]], including oganesson.&lt;ref name=Smolanczuk&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smolanczuk, R.|journal=Physical Review C|volume=59|issue=5|date=1999|title=Production mechanism of superheavy nuclei in cold fusion reactions|pages=2634–2639|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.59.2634|bibcode = 1999PhRvC..59.2634S}}&lt;/ref&gt; His calculations suggested that it might be possible to make oganesson by fusing [[lead]] with [[krypton]] under carefully controlled conditions, and that the fusion probability ([[cross-section (physics)|cross-section]]) of that reaction would be close to the lead–[[chromium]] reaction that had produced element 106, [[seaborgium]]. This contradicted predictions that the cross-sections for reactions with lead or [[bismuth]] targets would go down exponentially as the atomic number of the resulting elements increased.&lt;ref name=Smolanczuk/&gt;

In 1999, researchers at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] made use of these predictions and announced the discovery of [[livermorium]] and oganesson, in a paper published in ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ninov|first=Viktor|title=Observation of Superheavy Nuclei Produced in the Reaction of &lt;sup&gt;86&lt;/sup&gt;Kr with &lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Pb|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=83|pages=1104–1107|date=1999|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.1104|bibcode=1999PhRvL..83.1104N|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and very soon after the results were reported in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Service, R.

The following year, they published a retraction after researchers at other laboratories were unable to duplicate the results and the Berkeley lab could not duplicate them either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://enews.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/118-retraction.html|publisher=Berkeley Lab|author=Public Affairs Department|title=Results of element 118 experiment retracted|date=21 July 2001|accessdate=18 January 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129191344/http://enews.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/118-retraction.html|archivedate=29 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2002, the director of the lab announced that the original claim of the discovery of these two elements had been based on data fabricated by principal author [[Victor Ninov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=728–729|title=Misconduct: The stars who fell to Earth|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=420|doi=10.1038/420728a|date=2002|pmid=12490902|last1=Dalton|first1=R.|issue=6917|bibcode = 2002Natur.420..728D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2629 Element 118 disappears two years after it was discovered].

===Discovery reports===

The first genuine decay of atoms of oganesson was observed in 2002 at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) in [[Dubna]], Russia, by a joint team of Russian and American scientists.

In 2011, [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] evaluated the 2006 results of the Dubna–Livermore collaboration and concluded: "The three events reported for the ''Z'' = 118 isotope have very good internal
redundancy but with no anchor to known nuclei do not satisfy the criteria for discovery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1351/PAC-REP-10-05-01|title=Discovery of the elements with atomic numbers greater than or equal to 113 (IUPAC Technical Report)|date=2011|last1=Barber|first1=Robert C.|last2=Karol|first2=Paul J.|last3=Nakahara|first3=Hiromichi|last4=Vardaci|first4=Emanuele|last5=Vogt|first5=Erich W.|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|page=1|volume=83|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the very small [[fusion reaction]] probability (the fusion [[nuclear cross section|cross section]] is {{gaps|~|0.3–0.6|u=[[Barn (unit)|pb]]}} or {{val|p=(|3|end=–6)|e=-41|u=m2}}) the experiment took four months and involved a beam dose of {{val|2.5|e=19}} [[calcium]] ions that had to be shot at the [[californium]] target to produce the first recorded event believed to be the synthesis of oganesson.&lt;ref name="webelements"&gt;{{cite web

Nevertheless, researchers were highly confident that the results were not a [[false positive]], since the chance that the detections were random events was estimated to be less than one part in {{val|100000}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|quote="I would say we're very confident."|url=https://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/84/i43/8443element118.html|title=Element 118 Detected, With Confidence|journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|date=17 October 2006|accessdate=18 January 2008|author=Jacoby, Mitch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the experiments, the alpha-decay of three atoms of oganesson was observed. A fourth decay by direct [[spontaneous fission]] was also proposed. A [[half-life]] of 0.89&amp;nbsp;ms was calculated: {{chem|294|Og}} decays into {{chem|link=Isotopes of livermorium#Livermorium-290|290|Lv}} by [[alpha decay]]. Since there were only three nuclei, the half-life derived from observed lifetimes has a large uncertainty: {{val|0.89|+1.07|-0.31|u=ms}}.&lt;ref name="synthesis-118-116"/&gt;

:{{nuclide|Oganesson|294}} → {{nuclide|livermorium|290}} + {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|4}}

The identification of the {{chem|294|Og}} nuclei was verified by separately creating the putative [[decay product|daughter nucleus]] {{chem|290|Lv}} directly by means of a bombardment of {{chem|link=curium-245|245|Cm}} with {{chem|link=calcium-48|48|Ca}} ions,

:{{nuclide|Curium|245}} + {{nuclide|Calcium|48}} → {{nuclide|livermorium|290}} + 3 {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Neutron}},

and checking that the {{chem|290|Lv}} decay matched the [[decay chain]] of the {{chem|294|Og}} nuclei.&lt;ref name="synthesis-118-116"/&gt; The daughter nucleus {{chem|290|Lv}} is very unstable, decaying with a lifetime of 14 milliseconds into {{chem|link=flerovium-286|286|Fl}}, which may experience either [[spontaneous fission]] or alpha decay into {{chem|link=copernicium-282|282|Cn}}, which will undergo spontaneous fission.&lt;ref name="synthesis-118-116"/&gt;

===Confirmation===
One atom of the heavier isotope &lt;sup&gt;295&lt;/sup&gt;Og may have been seen in a 2011 experiment at the [[GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research]] in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]] aimed at the synthesis of [[unbinilium|element 120]] in the reaction &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm+&lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;Cr, but uncertainties in the data meant that the observed chain cannot be definitely assigned to &lt;sup&gt;299&lt;/sup&gt;120 and &lt;sup&gt;295&lt;/sup&gt;Og: the data indicates a longer half-life of &lt;sup&gt;295&lt;/sup&gt;Og of 181&amp;nbsp;milliseconds than that of &lt;sup&gt;294&lt;/sup&gt;Og, which is 0.7&amp;nbsp;milliseconds.&lt;ref name="EXON"/&gt;

In December 2015, the [[IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party|Joint Working Party]] of international scientific bodies [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) and [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] (IUPAP) recognized the element's discovery and assigned the priority of the discovery to the Dubna–Livermore collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iupac.org/news/news-detail/article/discovery-and-assignment-of-elements-with-atomic-numbers-113-115-117-and-118.html Discovery and Assignment of Elements with Atomic Numbers 113, 115, 117 and 118].

From 1 October 2015 to 6 April 2016, the Dubna team performed a similar experiment with &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca projectiles aimed at a mixed-isotope californium target containing &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Cf, &lt;sup&gt;250&lt;/sup&gt;Cf, and &lt;sup&gt;251&lt;/sup&gt;Cf, with the aim of producing the heavier oganesson isotopes &lt;sup&gt;295&lt;/sup&gt;Og and &lt;sup&gt;296&lt;/sup&gt;Og. Two beam energies at 252&amp;nbsp;MeV and 258&amp;nbsp;MeV were used. Only one atom was seen at the lower beam energy, whose decay chain fitted the previously known one of &lt;sup&gt;294&lt;/sup&gt;Og (terminating with spontaneous fission of &lt;sup&gt;286&lt;/sup&gt;Fl), and none were seen at the higher beam energy. The experiment was then halted, as the glue from the sector frames covered the target and blocked evaporation residues from escaping to the detectors. The Dubna team planned to repeat this experiment in 2017.&lt;ref name="Dubna2016"&gt;{{cite conference |title=Results from the Recent Study of the &lt;sup&gt;249–251&lt;/sup&gt;Cf + &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca Reactions |first1=A.

===Naming===
[[File:Yuri Oganessian 2017 stamp of Armenia.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Element 118 was named after [[Yuri Oganessian]], a pioneer in the discovery of [[synthetic element]]s, with the name ''oganesson'' (Og). Oganessian and the decay chain of oganesson-294 were pictured on a stamp of Armenia issued on 28 December 2017.]]
Using [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements]], oganesson is sometimes known as ''eka-radon'' (until the 1960s as ''eka-emanation'', emanation being the old name for [[radon]]).&lt;ref name=60s/&gt; In 1979, IUPAC assigned the [[systematic element name|systematic]] [[placeholder name]] ''ununoctium'' to the undiscovered element, with the corresponding symbol of ''Uuo'',&lt;ref name=iupac&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chatt, J.|journal=Pure Appl.

Before the retraction in 2002, the researchers from Berkeley had intended to name the element ''ghiorsium'' (''Gh''), after [[Albert Ghiorso]] (a leading member of the research team).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery of New Elements Makes Front Page News|url=http://lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Research-Review/Magazine/1999/departments/breaking_news.shtml|publisher=Berkeley Lab Research Review Summer 1999|date=1999|accessdate=18 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian discoverers reported their synthesis in 2006. According to IUPAC recommendations, the discoverers of a new element have the right to suggest a name.&lt;ref&gt;

Traditionally, the names of all [[noble gas]]es end in "-on", with the exception of [[helium]], which was not known to be a noble gas when discovered. The IUPAC guidelines valid at the moment of the discovery approval however required ''all'' new elements be named with the ending "-ium", even if they turned out to be [[halogen]]s (traditionally ending in "-ine") or noble gases (traditionally ending in "-on").&lt;ref name=Koppenol&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1351/pac200274050787 |url=http://media.iupac.org/publications/pac/2002/pdf/7405x0787.pdf |title=Naming of new elements (IUPAC Recommendations 2002) |date=2002 |last=Koppenol |first=W. H. |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |volume=74 |pages=787–791 |issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the provisional name ununoctium followed this convention, a new IUPAC recommendation published in 2016 recommended using the "-on" ending for new [[group 18 element]]s, regardless of whether they turn out to have the chemical properties of a noble gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = How to name new chemical elements (IUPAC Recommendations 2016) | journal = Pure and Applied Chemistry | volume = 88 | issue = 4 | doi = 10.1515/pac-2015-0802| year = 2016 | last1 = Koppenol | first1 = Willem H. | last2 = Corish | first2 = John | last3 = García-Martínez | first3 = Javier | last4 = Meija | first4 = Juris | last5 = Reedijk | first5 = Jan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Nuclear stability and isotopes===
[[File:Island of Stability derived from Zagrebaev.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Oganesson (row 118) is slightly above the "island of stability" (white circle) and thus its nuclei are slightly more stable than otherwise predicted.]]
{{main|Isotopes of oganesson}}
{{see also|Island of stability}}
The stability of nuclei quickly decreases with the increase in atomic number after [[curium]], element 96, whose half-life is four orders of magnitude longer than that of any subsequent element. All isotopes with an atomic number above [[mendelevium|101]] undergo radioactive decay with half-lives of less than 30 hours. No elements with atomic numbers above 82 (after [[lead]]) have stable isotopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Marcillac |first1=P. |last2=Coron |first2=N. |last3=Dambier |first3=G. |last4=Leblanc |first4=J. |last5=Moalic |first5=J.-P. |displayauthors=3 |date=2003 |title=Experimental detection of α-particles from the radioactive decay of natural bismuth |journal=Nature |volume=422 |pages=876–878 |pmid=12712201 |doi=10.1038/nature01541 |issue=6934 |bibcode=2003Natur.422..876D }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because of the ever-increasing Coulomb repulsion of protons, so that the [[strong nuclear force]] cannot hold the nucleus together against [[spontaneous fission]] for long. Calculations suggest that in the absence of other stabilizing factors, elements with more than [[lawrencium|103 protons]] should not exist. However, researchers in the 1960s suggested that the closed [[nuclear shell model|nuclear shells]] around 114 protons and 184 neutrons should counteract this instability, creating an "[[island of stability]]" where nuclides could have half-lives reaching thousands or millions of years. While scientists have still not reached the island, the mere existence of the [[superheavy element]]s (including oganesson) confirms that this stabilizing effect is real, and in general the known superheavy nuclides become exponentially longer-lived as they approach the predicted location of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Van Nostrand's scientific encyclopedia |first1=G.

===Calculated atomic and physical properties===
Oganesson is a member of [[noble gas|group 18]], the zero-[[valency (chemistry)|valence]] elements. The members of this group are usually inert to most common chemical reactions (for example, combustion) because the outer [[valence shell]] is completely filled with [[octet rule|eight electrons]]. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bader|first=Richard F.W|url=http://miranda.chemistry.mcmaster.ca/esam/|title=An Introduction to the Electronic Structure of Atoms and Molecules|publisher=McMaster University|accessdate=18 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that similarly, oganesson has a [[closed shell|closed]] outer valence shell in which its [[valence electron]]s are arranged in a 7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;7p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; [[electron configuration|configuration]].&lt;ref name=Nash2005/&gt;

Consequently, some expect oganesson to have similar physical and chemical properties to other members of its group, most closely resembling the noble gas above it in the periodic table, [[radon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenntech.com/Periodic-chart-elements/Uuo-en.htm|title=Ununoctium (Uuo) – Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects|publisher=Lenntech|accessdate=18 January 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080116172028/http://lenntech.com/Periodic-chart-elements/Uuo-en.htm |archivedate = 16 January 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the [[periodic trend]], oganesson would be expected to be slightly more reactive than radon. However, theoretical calculations have shown that it could be significantly more reactive.&lt;ref name=Kaldor/&gt; In addition to being far more reactive than radon, oganesson may be even more reactive than the elements [[flerovium]] and [[copernicium]], which are heavier homologs of the more chemically active elements [[lead]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] respectively.&lt;ref name=Nash2005/&gt; The reason for the possible enhancement of the chemical activity of oganesson relative to radon is an energetic destabilization and a radial expansion of the last occupied 7p-[[Electron shell#Subshells|subshell]].&lt;ref name=Nash2005/&gt; More precisely, considerable [[spin–orbit interaction]]s between the 7p electrons and the inert 7s electrons effectively lead to a second valence shell closing at [[flerovium]], and a significant decrease in stabilization of the closed shell of oganesson.&lt;ref name=Nash2005/&gt; It has also been calculated that oganesson, unlike the other noble gases, binds an electron with release of energy, or in other words, it exhibits positive [[electron affinity]],&lt;ref name=Pyykko&gt;{{cite journal|title=QED corrections to the binding energy of the eka-radon (Z=118) negative ion|first1=Igor|last1=Goidenko|first2=Leonti|last2=Labzowsky|first3=Ephraim|last3=Eliav|first4=Uzi|last4=Kaldor|first5= Pekka |last5=Pyykkö|journal=Physical Review A|volume=67|date=2003|pages=020102(R)|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.67.020102|bibcode = 2003PhRvA..67b0102G|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=77|issue=27|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=1996|title=Element 118: The First Rare Gas with an Electron Affinity|first1=Ephraim |last1=Eliav |first2=Uzi |last2=Kaldor|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.5350|pages=5350–5352|pmid=10062781|last3=Ishikawa|first3=Y.|last4=Pyykkö|first4=P. |bibcode=1996PhRvL..77.5350E}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the relativistically stabilized 8s energy level and the destabilized 7p&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt; level,&lt;ref name=Landau&gt;{{cite journal |last=Landau |first=Arie |last2=Eliav |first2=Ephraim |first3=Yasuyuki |last3=Ishikawa |first4=Uzi |last4=Kador |date=25 May 2001 |title=Benchmark calculations of electron affinities of the alkali atoms sodium to eka-francium (element 119) |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234859102 |journal=Journal of Chemical Physics |volume=115 |issue=6 |pages=2389–92 |doi=10.1063/1.1386413 |access-date=15 September 2015|bibcode = 2001JChPh.115.2389L }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas copernicium and flerovium are predicted to have no electron affinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kernchemie.uni-mainz.de/downloads/che_7/presentations/borschevsky.pdf |title=Fully relativistic ''ab initio'' studies of superheavy elements |last1=Borschevsky |first1=Anastasia |first2=Valeria |last2=Pershina |first3=Uzi |last3=Kaldor |first4=Ephraim |last4=Eliav |website=www.kernchemie.uni-mainz.de |publisher=[[Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz]] |access-date=15 January 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115184921/http://www.kernchemie.uni-mainz.de/downloads/che_7/presentations/borschevsky.pdf |archivedate=15 January 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borschevsky |first1=Anastasia |last2=Pershina |first2=Valeria |first3=Ephraim |last3=Eliav |first4=Uzi |last4=Kaldor |date=27 August 2009 |title=Electron affinity of element 114, with comparison to Sn and Pb |journal=Chemical Physics Letters |volume=480 |issue=1 |pages=49–51 |doi=10.1016/j.cplett.2009.08.059|bibcode=2009CPL...480...49B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, [[quantum electrodynamic]] corrections have been shown to be quite significant in reducing this affinity by decreasing the binding in the [[anion]] Og&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; by 9%, thus confirming the importance of these corrections in [[superheavy element]]s.&lt;ref name=Pyykko/&gt;

The only confirmed isotope of oganesson, &lt;sup&gt;294&lt;/sup&gt;Og, has much too short a half-life to be chemically investigated experimentally. Therefore, no compounds of oganesson have been synthesized yet.&lt;ref name=Moody&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Synthesis of Superheavy Elements |last1=Moody |first1=Ken |editor1-first=Matthias |editor1-last=Schädel |editor2-first=Dawn |editor2-last=Shaughnessy |title=The Chemistry of Superheavy Elements |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |edition=2nd |pages=24–8 |isbn=9783642374661|date=2013-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, calculations on [[theoretical chemistry|theoretical compounds]] have been performed since 1964.&lt;ref name=60s/&gt; It is expected that if the [[ionization energy]] of the element is high enough, it will be difficult to [[oxidize]] and therefore, the most common [[oxidation state]] would be 0 (as for the noble gases);&lt;ref name="compounds"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=WebElements Periodic Table|url=http://webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/Uuo/comp.html|title=Ununoctium: Binary Compounds|accessdate=18 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless, this appears not to be the case.&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt;

Calculations on the [[diatomic molecule]] {{chem|Og|2}} showed a [[chemical bond|bonding]] interaction roughly equivalent to that calculated for {{chem|Hg|2}}, and a [[dissociation energy]] of 6&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, roughly 4 times of that of {{chem|Rn|2}}.&lt;ref name=Nash2005/&gt; Most strikingly, it was calculated to have a [[bond length]] shorter than in {{chem|Rn|2}} by 0.16 Å, which would be indicative of a significant bonding interaction.&lt;ref name=Nash2005/&gt; On the other hand, the compound OgH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; exhibits a dissociation energy (in other words [[proton affinity]] of oganesson) that is smaller than that of RnH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Nash2005/&gt;

The bonding between oganesson and [[hydrogen]] in OgH is predicted to be very weak and can be regarded as a pure [[van der Waals interaction]] rather than a true [[chemical bond]].&lt;ref name=hydride/&gt; On the other hand, with highly electronegative elements, oganesson seems to form more stable compounds than for example [[copernicium]] or [[flerovium]].&lt;ref name=hydride/&gt; The stable oxidation states +2 and +4 have been predicted to exist in the [[fluoride]]s {{chem|OgF|2}} and {{chem|OgF|4}}.&lt;ref name=fluoride&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry A|volume=103|issue=8|pages=1104–1108|date=1999|title=Structures of RgFn (Rg = Xe, Rn, and Element 118. n = 2, 4.)

Around 250 country analysts provide input, which is subsequently used to calculate an index value for each of the world’s 20 largest oil-exporting countries. Each of these country values is subsequently weighted by the exports of the countries in order to compute a single, weighted, global PRIX index number that sums up the political risk for international oil markets during the coming three months.

Variations in oil exports are an important component of global [[Price of oil|oil price]] formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/WPM40-AnAnatomyoftheCrudeOilPricingSystem-BassamFattouh-2011.pdf|title = An Anatomy of the Crude Oil Pricing System|date= 2015-07-01 |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the PRIX index forecast may help identify potential trajectories of international [[price of oil]]. However, other factors than political risks affect the global balance between supply and demand of oil and thus contribute to setting the oil price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.aamcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/AAM-Thought-Leadership-A-Detailed-Analysis-into-the-Fundamental-Factors-Affecting-Crude-Oil-Prices-12-02-141.pdf|title =A Detailed Analysis Into the Fundamental Factors Affecting Crude Oil Prices|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20151117025543/http://www.aamcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/AAM-Thought-Leadership-A-Detailed-Analysis-into-the-Fundamental-Factors-Affecting-Crude-Oil-Prices-12-02-141.pdf|archivedate =2015-11-17|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The index therefore does not predict the oil price itself as it does not cover economic and technological developments, but it can function as a component in oil price forecasting.

==History==
The index was first published in January 2015. It is updated quarterly and made freely available to the public via the index website and Twitter feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://prixindex.net |title=PRIX}}&lt;/ref&gt; The index is independent and is not owned by any institutions, companies or governments.

==Methodology==
Country analysts are asked whether political developments during the coming three months are likely to lead to reduced, unchanged, or increased oil exports from a given country. The following diffusion index formula is used to process their answers: INDEX = (P1*1) + (P2*0.5) + (P3*0)
where:
:P1 = percentage number of country analysts who foresaw political developments leading to increased exports; 
:P2 = percentage number of country analysts who foresaw political developments leading leaving oil exports unchanged; 
:P3 = percentage number of country analysts who foresaw political developments leading to reduced exports.

An index number of 50 means that oil exports are not likely to change. A number above 50 indicates that political developments may lead to higher oil exports, while a value below 50 indicates lower exports. The further away from 50 the index number is, the greater the expected change in exports, and the greater the likelihood of an impact on the oil price. The full theoretical range of index values is 0–100. However, in practice the global index value will normally oscillate around 50 and stay within the range of 40–60.

Each country analyst reports on one of the 20 countries, and is required to have in-depth expertise on that country. Country analysts come from a variety of professional backgrounds, but are normally based in the country that they report on. In some cases country analysts outside the country in question are used, and should then speak the local language, visit the country frequently and follow the political situation closely.

[[File:Pack Horse 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3&lt;!--size for lead image--&gt;|[[Packhorse|Horse packing]] with traditional Australian [[pack saddle]]]]

A '''pack animal''' or '''beast of burden''' is an individual or type of [[working animal]] used by [[human]]s as means of [[transport]]ing materials by attaching them so their weight bears on the [[animal]]'s back, in contrast to draft animals which pull loads but do not carry them.

Traditional pack animals are diverse including [[camel]]s, [[pack goat|goat]]s, [[domestic yak|yak]]s, [[reindeer]], [[water buffalo]]es, and [[llama]]s as well as the more familiar pack animals like [[packhorse|horse]]s, [[donkey]]s and [[mule]]s.

==Pack versus draft==

The term ''pack animal'' is traditionally used in contrast to ''draft animal'', which is a [[working animal]] that typically pulls a load behind itself (such as a [[plow]], a cart, a [[sled]] or a heavy log) rather than carrying cargo directly on its back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Right to be Outside: Three Mules |url=http://www.notechmagazine.com/category/pack-animals |publisher=No Tech Magazine |date=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[sled dog]]s pull loads but do not normally carry them, while working elephants have been used for centuries to haul logs out of forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Elephants in Logging Operations in Sri Lanka |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/v9570e/v9570e02.htm |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |accessdate=31 January 2016 |archiveurl=http://www.fao.org/docrep/v9570e/v9570e02.htm |archivedate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diversity==

Hauling of goods in wagons with horses and oxen gradually displaced the use of packhorses, which had been important until the [[Middle Ages]], by the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name="Aston2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Aston |first=T. H. |title=Landlords, Peasants and Politics in Medieval England |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BW2iS9JAZm4C&amp;pg=PA55 |date=2 November 2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-03127-1 |pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pack animals may be fitted with [[pack saddle]]s and may also carry [[saddlebag]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How Much Weight Can My Horse Carry? |url=https://www.outfitterssupply.com/russon/how-much-weight.asp |publisher=Outfitters Supply |accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While traditional usage of pack animals by nomadic tribespeople is declining, a new market is growing in the tourist expeditions industry in regions such as the [[High Atlas]] mountains of Morocco, allowing visitors the comfort of [[backpacking with animals]].&lt;ref name=DonkeySanctuary/&gt;  The use of pack animals "is considered a valid means of viewing and experiencing" some [[National Park]]s in America, subject to guidelines and closed areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Horse &amp; Pack Animal Use |url=http://www.nps.gov/care/planyourvisit/horsepack.htm |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, [[special forces]] have received guidance on the use of horses, mules, llamas, camels, dogs, and elephants as pack animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FM 3-05.213 (FM 31-27) Special Forces  Use of Pack Animals |url=https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-05-213.pdf |publisher=Headquarters, Department of the Army |accessdate=26 January 2016 |date=June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Load carrying capacity==

The load for oxen is their body weight (1500-2500 pounds) at walking pace and 2X for short hauls. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lancasterfarming.com/news/northern_edition/oxen-no-has-beens-when-it-comes-to-hard-pulling/article_b79a5f8f-5d4b-578d-997a-f385095dc7c9.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The maximum load for a camel is roughly 300&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=CSIRO |title=Model Code of Practice for the  Welfare of Animals The Camel (Camelus dromedarius) |date=2006 |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |page=8 |edition=2nd |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/Books/download.cfm?ID=5204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yaks are loaded differently according to region. In Sichuan, 75&amp;nbsp;kg is carried for 30&amp;nbsp;km in 6 hours. In Qinghai, at 4100 m altitude, packs of up to 300&amp;nbsp;kg are routinely carried, while up to 390&amp;nbsp;kg is carried by the heaviest steers for short periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Draught performance|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/ad347e/ad347e0g.htm|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Llamas can carry roughly 1/4 of their body weight, so an adult male of 200&amp;nbsp;kg can carry some 50&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions about Llamas and Alpacas |url=http://www.touchtheearthranch.com/llamaFAQ.htm |publisher=Touch the Heart Ranch |accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loads for equids are disputed. The US Army specifies a maximum of 20 percent of body weight for mules walking up to 20 miles a day in mountains, giving a load of up to about 150&amp;nbsp;kg. However an 1867 text mentioned a load of up to 800 pounds (about 360&amp;nbsp;kg). In India, the prevention of cruelty rules (1965) limit mules to 200&amp;nbsp;kg and ponies to 70&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bonner |first1=Laurie |title=How Much Weight Can Your Horse Safely Carry? |url=http://equusmagazine.com/article/weight_carry_062608 |publisher=Equus Magazine |accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reindeer can carry up to 40&amp;nbsp;kg for a prolonged period in mountains.&lt;ref name="Nickul1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nickul|first=Karl |title=The Lappish Nation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fjwc3OoDdV4C&amp;pg=PA29 |year=1997 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-7007-0922-9 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S. |title=Theory of dwarf galaxies|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=December 1980|volume=242|pages=517–527|doi=10.1086/158485|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1980ApJ...242..517G|bibcode = 1980ApJ...242..517G }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1980. This model proposes that star formation propagates via the action of shock waves produced by [[stellar wind]]s and [[supernovae]] traversing the gas that composes the [[interstellar medium]].

In contrast to star formation in [[Density wave theory|density-wave theories]], which are limited to [[Disc galaxy|disk-shaped galaxies]] and produce global [[Spiral galaxy|spiral patterns]], SSPSF applies equally well to spirals, to [[irregular galaxies]] and to any local concentrations of gas in [[elliptical galaxies]].

The effect may be envisioned as an [[Compartmental models in epidemiology#The SIR model|"SIR infection model"]] in a differentially rotating disk, the host galaxy.  The '''SIR''' model (perhaps most popularly familiar in the form of [[Conway's Game of Life]]) is applied to star formation propagating through the galaxy: Each generation of stars in a neighborhood includes some massive ones whose stellar winds and, soon, supernovae, produce shock waves in the gas ('''S'''usceptible material).  These lead to collapsing nearby gas clouds, which produce the next generation of stars ('''I'''nfection propagation); but in the immediate neighborhood, all initially available gas is used, so no further stars are born there for some period of time despite the shocks ('''R'''ecovery from infection).
[[File:SSPSF simulation.gif|thumb|341x341px|SSPSF simulation]]
In a non-flattened galaxy, the infection would produce an outward propagating sphere.  In a non-rotating flattened (disk) environment, the infection would produce an outward propagating ring.  But in a [[differential rotation#Differential rotation of the Milky Way|differentially rotating]] flattened environment, i.e., with mass closer to the galactic center orbiting the center somewhat more quickly, the ring is sheared into an ellipse, the innermost parts moving ahead of the ring's center and the outermost parts lagging.  For disk galaxies, virtually all star formation occurs in the disk.  In that case, the elongated rings are likewise confined to the disk, and collectively they evolve to appear as (possibly disconnected) segments of spiral arms: See the example, as well as figures in.&lt;ref name=Gerola78 /&gt;

In 1999, the prevailing [[Density wave theory|density wave model]] for the generation of spiral arms in galaxies was combined with SSPSF in a doctoral thesis by Auer&lt;ref name=Auer99&gt;{{cite journal|last=Auer|first=R.|title=A spiral galaxy model combining the density wave and self-propagating star formation|bibcode=1999sgmc.book.....A}}&lt;/ref&gt; (an idea first suggested by Gerola and Seiden in 1980). Auer concluded that density waves are in fact less effective in producing star formation, and more effective in simply organizing ongoing SSPSF into large-scale (spiral) patterns, ultimately into the [[Grand design spiral galaxy|Grand Design spiral]] form if conditions allow.

In the figure you can see a simulation of a simple model for SSPSF on a circular grid. It is generated by randomly starting star formation in certain boxes of the grid, which propagates to nearby boxes in the grid while time progresses. Star formation dies out with time and a box has a certain regeneration time which prevents it from starting new star formation just after it was active. Adding (differential) rotation to the disk during propagation creates spiral patterns that are of the same nature of those in actual spiral galaxies. Dark spots are areas of active star formation, lighter spots are areas of recent star formation/areas in regeneration. 

SSPSF processes were demonstrated in an early prototype ("Gaslight")&lt;ref&gt;[http://eu.spore.com/extra/?id=10755 "Play with our Prototypes - Gaslight"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712022200/http://eu.spore.com/extra/?id=10755 |date=2012-07-12 }}.

'''Soil steam sterilization''' ('''soil steaming''') is a [[farming]] technique that [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizes]] [[soil]] with [[steam]] in open fields or greenhouses. Pests of plant cultures such as weeds, bacteria, fungi and viruses are killed through induced hot steam which causes vital cellular proteins to  [[Protein folding|unfold]]. Biologically, the method is considered a partial disinfection. Important heat-resistant, spore-forming bacteria can survive and revitalize the soil after cooling down. Soil fatigue can be cured through the release of nutritive substances blocked within the soil. Steaming leads to a better starting position, quicker growth and strengthened resistance against plant disease and pests. Today, the application of hot steam is considered the best and most effective way to disinfect sick soil, potting soil and compost. 
It is being used as an alternative to [[bromomethane]], whose production and use was curtailed by the [[Montreal Protocol]]. "Steam effectively kills pathogens by heating the soil to levels that cause [[protein]] coagulation or [[enzyme]] inactivation."&lt;ref name=gov&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/ozone/mbr/casestudies/volume3/steam3.html EPA] Steam as an Alternative to Methyl Bromide in Nursery Crops&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of soil steaming==
Soil sterilization provides secure and quick relief of soils from substances and organisms harmful to plants such as:
* Bacteria
* Viruses
* Fungi
* [[Nematodes]] and
* Other Pests

Further positive effects are:

==Steaming with superheated steam==
Through modern steaming methods with superheated steam at 180&amp;ndash;200&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]], an optimal soil disinfection can be achieved. Soil only absorbs a small amount of humidity. Micro organisms become active once the soil has cooled down. This creates an optimal environment for instant tillage with seedlings and seeds. 
Additionally the method of integrated steaming can promote a target-oriented resettlement of steamed soil with beneficial organisms. In the process, the soil is first freed from all organisms and then revitalized and microbiologically buffered through the injection of a soil activator based on compost which contains a natural mixture of favorable microorganisms (e.g. Bacillus subtilis, etc.).  

Different types of such steam application are also available in practice, including substrate steaming and surface steaming.

==Surface steaming==
Several methods for surface steaming are in use amongst which are: area sheet steaming, the steaming hood, the steaming harrow, the steaming plough and vacuum steaming with drainage pipes or mobile pipe systems. 

In order to pick the most suitable steaming method, certain factors have to be considered such as soil structure, plant culture and area performance. At present, more advanced methods are being developed, such as sandwich steaming or partially integrated sandwich steaming in order to minimize energy and cost as much as possible.

===Sheet steaming===

Surface steaming with special sheets (sheet steaming) is a method which has been established for decades in order to steam large areas reaching from 15 to 400 m² in one step. If properly applied, sheet steaming is simple and highly economic. The usage of heat resistant, non-decomposing insulation fleece saves up to 50% energy, reduces the steaming time significantly and improves penetration. Single working step areas up to 400 m² can be steamed in 4–5 hours down to 25–30&amp;nbsp;cm depth / 90 °C. 
The usage of heat resistant and non-decomposing synthetic insulation fleece, 5&amp;nbsp;mm thick, 500 gr / m², can reduce steaming time by about 30%. Through a steam injector or a perforated pipe, steam is injected underneath the sheet after it has been laid out and weighted with sand sacks. 

The area performance in one working step depends on the capacity of the steam generator (e.g. steam boiler):

| &lt;center&gt;130-180&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;180-220&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;220-270&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;300-400&lt;/center&gt;
|-
|}

The steaming time depends on soil structure as well as outside temperature and amounts to 1-1.5 hours per 10&amp;nbsp;cm steaming depth. Hereby the soil reaches a temperature of about 85 °C. Milling for soil loosening is not recommended since soil structure may become too fine which reduces its penetrability for steam. The usage of spading machines is ideal for soil loosening. The best results can be achieved if the soil is cloddy at greater depth and granulated at lesser depth. 

In practice, working with at least two sheets simultaneously has proven to be highly effective. While one sheet is used for steaming the other one is prepared for steam injection, therefore unnecessary steaming recesses are avoided.

===Depth steaming with vacuum===
Steaming with vacuum which is induced through a mobile or fixed installed pipe system in the depth of the area to be steamed, is the method that reaches the best penetration. Despite high capital cost, the fixed installation of drainage systems is reasonable for intensively used areas  since steaming depths of up to 80&amp;nbsp;cm can be achieved. 

In contrast to fixed installed drainage systems, pipes in mobile suction systems are on the surface. A central suction pipeline consisting of zinc-coated, fast-coupling pipes are connected in a regular spacing of 1.50 m and the ends of the hoses are pushed into the soil to the desired depth with a special tool.

The steaming area is covered with a special steaming sheet and weighted all around as with sheet steaming. The steam is injected underneath the sheet through an injector and protection tunnel. While with short areas up to 30 m length steam is frontally injected, with longer areas steam is induced in the middle of the beet using a T-connection branching out to both sides. 
As soon as the sheet is inflated to approximately 1 m by the steam pressure, the suction turbine is switched on.  First, the air in the soil is removed via the suction hoses. A partial vacuum is formed and the steam is pulled downward.
 
During the final phase, when the required steaming depth has been reached, the ventilator runs non-stop and surplus steam is blown out. To ensure that this surplus steam is not lost, it is fed back under the sheet.
     
As with all other steaming systems, a post-steaming period of approximately 20–30 minutes is required. Steaming time is approximately 1 hour per 10&amp;nbsp;cm steaming depth.  The steam requirement is approximately 7–8&amp;nbsp;kg/m².
    
The most important requirement, as with all steaming systems, is that the soil is well loosened before steaming, to ensure optimal penetration.

====Negative Pressure technique====
"Negative Pressure technique generates appropriate soil temperature at a 60&amp;nbsp;cm depth and complete control of [[nematode]]s, [[fungi]] and [[weed]]s is achieved. In this technique, the steam is introduced under the steaming sheath and forced to enter the soil profile by a negative pressure. The negative pressure is created by a fan that sucks the air out of the soil through buried perforated [[polypropylene]] pipes. This system requires a permanent installation of perforated pipes into the soil, at a depth of at least 60&amp;nbsp;cm to be protected from [[plough]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/004/Y1809E/y1809e07.htm FAO] Global report on validated alternatives to the use of methyl bromide for soil&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steaming with hoods===
&lt;!-- [[Image:Vollautomat9.jpg|thumb|right|Fully automatic steaming robot with steaming hoods]] --&gt;
[[Image:haube.jpeg|thumb|right|Half automatic steaming hood with three wings in greenhouse]]

A steaming hood is a mobile device consisting of corrosion-resistant materials such as aluminum, which is put down onto the area to be steamed. In contrast to sheet steaming, cost-intensive working steps such as laying out and weighting the sheets don’t occur, however the area steamed per working step is smaller in accordance to the size of the hood. 

Outdoors, a hood is positioned either manually or via tractor with a special pre-stressed  4 point suspension arm. Steaming time amounts to 30 min for a penetration down to 25&amp;nbsp;cm depth. Hereby a temperature of 90 °C can be reached. In large stable glasshouses, the hoods are attached to tracks. They are lifted and moved by pneumatic cylinders. Small and medium-sized hoods up to 12 m² are lifted manually using a tipping lever or moved electrically with special winches.

===Combined surface and depth injection of steam (Sandwich Steaming)===

[[Image:sandwichdaempfung.jpg|thumb|right|Sandwich steaming machine model Sterilter constructed by Ferrari Costruzioni Meccaniche equipped with MSD/moeschle steam boiler]]

Sandwich steaming, which was developed in a project among DEIAFA, University of Turin (Italy, www.deiafa.unito.it) and Ferrari Costruzioni Meccaniche (see image), represents a combination of depth and surface steaming, offers an efficient method to induce hot steam into the soil. The steam is simultaneously pushed into the soil from the surface and from the depth. For this purpose, the area, which must be equipped with a deep steaming injection system, is covered with a steaming hood. The steam enters the soil from the top and the bottom at the same time. Sheets are not suitable, since a high pressure up to 30&amp;nbsp;mm water column arises underneath the cover.

Sandwich steaming offers several advantages. On the one hand, application of energy can be increased to up to 120&amp;nbsp;kg steam per m²/h. In comparison to other steaming methods up to 30% energy savings can be achieved and the usage of fuel (e.g. heating oil) accordingly decreases. The increased application of energy leads to a quick heating of the soil which reduces the loss of heat. On the other hand, only half of the regular steaming time is needed.

(*) in soil max 30% moisture 

Clearly, Sandwich steaming reaches the highest steam output at the lowest energy demand.

===Partially integrated Sandwich steaming===
The partial integrated Sandwich steaming is an advanced combined method for steaming merely the areas which shall be planted and purposely leaving out those areas which shall not be used. In order to avoid risk of re-infection of steamed areas with pest from unsteamed areas, beneficial organisms can directly be injected into the hygenized soil via a soil activator (e.g. special compost). The partial sandwich steaming unlocks further potential savings in the steaming process.

==Container / Stack steaming==
Stack steaming is used when thermically treating compost and substrates such as turf. Depending on the amount, the material to be steamed is piled up to 70&amp;nbsp;cm height in steaming boxes or in small dump trailers. Steam is evenly injected via manifolds. For huge amounts, steaming containers and soil boxes are used which are equipped with suction systems to improve steaming results. Midget amounts can be steamed in special small steaming devices.

The amount of soil steamed should be tuned in a way that steaming time amounts to at most 1.5 h in order to avoid large quantities of condensed water in the bottom layers of the soil.

In light substrates, such as turf, the performance per hour is significantly higher.

==History==
Ancient civilizations in India and Egypt used steam, generated through the targeted usage of incident solar radiation on watered top soil, to sanitize and revive their arable land.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Modern soil steam sterilization was first discovered in 1888 (by Frank in Germany) and was first commercially used in the United States (by Rudd) in 1893 (Baker 1962). Since then, a wide variety of steam machines have been built to disinfest both commercial greenhouse and nursery field soils (Grossman and Liebman 1995). In the 1950s, for example, steam sterilization technologies expanded from disinfestation of potting soil and greenhouse mixes to commercial production of steam rakes and tractor-drawn steam blades for fumigating small acres of cut flowers and other high-value field crops (Langedijk 1959). Today, even more effective steam technologies are being developed.&lt;ref name=gov/&gt;

==Application of hot steam ==
* In horticulture as well as nurseries for sterilization of substrates and top soil
* In agriculture for sterilization and treatment of food waste for pig fattening and heating of molasses
* In mushroom cultivation for pasteurization of  growing rooms, sterilization of top soil and combined application as heating
* In wineries as combination boiler for sterilization and cleaning of storage tanks, tempering of mash and for warm water generation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9520">{{Update|opening of REC markets in China|date=January 2018}}
'''Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs)''' or '''Solar Renewable Energy Credits''' are a form of [[Renewable Energy Certificates (United States)|Renewable Energy Certificate]] or "Green tag" existing in the United States of America.  SRECs exist in states that have [[Renewable portfolio standard|Renewable Portfolio Standard]] (RPS) legislation with specific requirements for solar energy, usually referred to as a "solar carve-out".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/eea/energy-utilities-clean-tech/renewable-energy/solar/rps-solar-carve-out/ RPS Solar Carve-Out for Massachusetts]&lt;/ref&gt; The additional income received from selling SRECs increases the economic value of a solar investment and assists with the financing of solar technology.  In conjunction with state and federal incentives,  solar system owners can recover their investment in solar by selling their SRECs through spot market sales or long-term sales, both described below.

==Specifications==
SRECs represent the environmental attributes from a solar facility, and are produced each time a solar system produces one thousand Kilowatt-hours (KWh) of electricity. For every 1000 kilowatt-hours of electricity produced by an eligible solar facility, one SREC is awarded. In order for a solar facility to be credited with that SREC, the system must be certified and registered.

===Certification===
In order to produce SRECs, a solar system must first be certified by state regulatory agencies, usually public service commissions or public utility commissions, and then registered with the registry authorized by the state to create and track SRECs. Once a solar system is certified with the state agency and registered with a registry such as PJM-GATS or NEPOOL-GIS (for Massachusetts),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepoolgis.com/ NEPOOL-GIS]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solsystems.com/our-resources/srec-prices-and-knowledge/srec-faq SREC FAQ, solSystems]&lt;/ref&gt; SRECs can be issued using either estimates or actual meter readings depending upon state regulations.&lt;ref name=NREL /&gt; In some cases, smaller installations may be able to use estimates, while actual meter readings are required for large installations. Solar installations may be registered in states other than the state in which they are physically located and many SREC aggregators will navigate the certification process on behalf of their customers to ensure that systems are certified in the states with the highest SREC values so as to ensure long-term price stability.

===Solar Alternative Compliance Payment===
Many states have a law called a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) which mandates that the state’s utility must produce a minimum amount of solar power every year. If they cannot do so with their own power generation facilities they must purchase SRECs. The Solar Alternative Compliance Payment (SACP) is the fee that energy suppliers must pay if they fail to secure SRECs as required by their state's RPS. Because energy suppliers and utilities may simply pay the fee if SREC prices approach the fee level, a state's ACP generally sets a cap on the value of SRECs. In rare cases SREC prices have approached and even surpassed ACP levels because SRECs can sometimes be recovered by charging more to electricity customers (rate basing), while ACP payments are usually precluded.&lt;ref name=NREL /&gt; In many states, the SACP is scheduled to decline over time with the intention of eventually phasing out the solar industry's reliance on SREC sales as an incentive for installing solar.

==Market==
Solar RPS requirements are meant to create a marketplace for SRECs and a dynamic incentive for the solar industry. Solar RPS requirements demand that energy suppliers or utilities procure a certain percentage of electricity from qualified solar renewable energy resources in a state. These Energy suppliers and/or utilities can meet solar RPS requirements by purchasing SRECs from homeowners and businesses who own solar systems and produce SRECs. Homeowners and businesses can then utilize the sale of the SRECs they generate to help finance their solar systems. SRECs can be sold a variety of ways, such as on the spot market, at auction, or by negotiating long-term contracts.

===Supply and demand===
SREC supply in a particular state is determined by the number of solar installations qualified to produce SRECs and actually selling SRECs in that state. As more solar systems are built, SREC supply will increase. SREC demand is determined by a state's RPS solar requirement, typically a requirement that a certain percentage of the energy supplied into a state originate from qualified solar energy resources.&lt;ref name=NREL /&gt; Load-Serving Entities or organizations that supply electricity into the state are required to meet these requirements. RPS solar requirements in many states are set to increase in the coming decade.

===Prices===
Typically, there is no assigned monetary value to an SREC. SREC prices are ultimately determined by market forces within the parameters set forth by the state. If there is a shortage in SREC supply, pricing will rise, resulting in an increase in the value of the incentive for solar systems and an intended acceleration in solar installations.  As SREC supply catches up to SREC demand, pricing will likely decrease, resulting in an intended deceleration in solar installations. Over time, SREC markets are designed to find the equilibrium price that encourages enough installation to meet the growing demand set forth by the RPS. Generally speaking, SREC prices are a function of (1) a state's solar alternative compliance payment (SACP), (2) the [[supply and demand]] for SRECs within the relevant state, and (3) the term or length over which SRECs are sold.

===Spot sales===
[[Spot price]] for SRECs are generally higher than prices found in long-term contracts since the system owner is taking on market risk. If increases in supply outpace the growing demand, spot prices could fall. SRECs have traded as high as $680 in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.gov/emp/docs/pdf/emp_commentspartV.pdf |title=Electric Vehicles and the 21st Century Electric Grid |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile other state SREC market prices range from $45 in Delaware to $271.05 in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=NREL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/52868.pdf|title=Solar Renewable Energy Certificate (SREC) Markets: Status and Trends|publisher=[[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]]|date=November 2011|first1=Lori|last1=Bird|first2=Jenny|last2=Heeter|first3=Claire|last3=Kreycik|accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the strength of spot market demand in states experiencing supply shortages, the general lack of availability of viable long-term contracts and the heavy discounts applied to these contracts have left some system owners and project developers seeking ways to finance solar through spot transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Needleman |first=Sarah E. |url=https://online.wsj.com/article/NA_WSJ_PUB:SB10001424052748704133804575198590448642372.html |title=Small Businesses Wait For Green Energy Payback |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, Diamond Castle, a New York based private equity firm, announced that it would be financing projects strictly with equity in order to avoid the premiums paid in long-term contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chernova |first=Yuliya |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2010/06/07/diamond-castle-takes-an-unusual-approach-in-solar-debut/ |title=Diamond Castle Takes An Unusual Approach In Solar Debut |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=2010-06-07 |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term contracts===
In addition to providing cash flow security and stability, long-term SREC contracts are often required by banks or other lending institutions unwilling to accept market and legislative risk associated with SREC markets. However, SREC contracts longer than 3 years can be difficult to secure in some SREC markets because in deregulated electricity markets, energy suppliers rarely have electricity supply contracts longer than three years. Some SREC aggregators have managed to negotiate 3-10 year agreements and are able to offer similar length contracts to their residential and commercial customers.  In most cases, long-term contracts demand some sort of premium over market prices to compensate the off-taker for putting up the credit to guarantee the contract in the event that prices drop. This premium is also affected by the general lack of availability of credible off-takers in the market. In some markets, however, where short term supply has overtaken demand, long-term prices are competitive and can actually be better than spot prices.&lt;ref name=NREL /&gt;

In experimental [[fluid mechanics]], a '''sting''' is a [[test fixture]] on which models are mounted for testing, e.g. in a [[wind tunnel]]. A sting is usually a long shaft attaching to the downstream end of the model so that it does not much disturb the flow over the model. The rear end of a sting usually
has a conical fairing blending into the (wind tunnel) model support structure.

For minimum aerodynamic interference a sting should be as long as possible and have as small a diameter as possible, within the structural safety limits. Critical length of a sting (beyond which its influence on the flow around the model is small) is mostly dependent on [[Reynolds number]]. If the flow at the rear end of a model (model base) is laminar, the critical sting length can be as much as 12-15 base diameters.&lt;ref name="AG54"&gt;[http://ftp.rta.nato.int/public/PubFullText/AGARD/AG/AGARD-AG-54/AGARD-AG-54.pdf A.Pope, "Wind Tunnel Calibration Techniques"], AGARDograph 54, AGARD, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; If the flow at model base is turbulent, critical sting length reduces to 3-5 model base diameters. Source &lt;ref name="AG54" /&gt; also suggests a sting diameter of no more than about 30% of model base diameter. However, this may not be possible in wind tunnels with high dynamic pressures because large aerodynamic loads would cause unacceptably large deflections and/or stresses in the sting. Shorter stings of larger relative diameters must be used in such cases.
A good rule-of-thumb is that, for acceptably low and test-conditions-independent aerodynamic interference in a high-Reynolds-number, high-dynamic-pressure wind tunnel, a sting should have a diameter "d" not larger than 30% to 50% of model base diameter "D" and should have a length "L" of at least three model base diameters, e.g. as specified for the [[AGARD-B wind tunnel model#AGARD-C|AGARD-C]] calibration model&lt;ref name="Agardspec2"&gt;Wind Tunnel Calibration Models, 
AGARD Specification 2, AGARD, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;), [[:Image:AGARD-C model on a sting fixture.png|see figure]].

If the test object (model) is to be placed at high angles of attack relative to the airstream (i.e. at an attitude beyond the operating range of the model support mechanism), a '''bent sting''' can be used, [[:Image:AGARD-C model on a bent sting.png|see figure]]. Bent stings usually produce higher aerodynamic interference than straight stings. If the test object (model) has a "boattail" rear end without a well-defined base through which a sting shaft can enter the model, a so-called '''Z-sting''' can be used, having a form reminiscent of the Latin letter "Z". The part of the sting entering the model is a thin aerodynamically shaped blade so as to minimize disturbance of the flow; [[:Image:Wind tunnel model on a Z-sting (schematic).png|see figure]].

Stings often attach, at the front end, to internal [[wind tunnel balance]]s to measure the forces on the model. Therefore, most stings have a central bore through which the cables from a balance or other in-model instrumentation can be conducted without exposure to the airflow.

When a model is mounted on a wind tunnel balance attached to a sting, care must be taken that no parts of the model touch the sting during a wind tunnel test; the only support of the model must be through the balance.

A '''stone-boat''' is a type of [[sled]] (sledge) for moving heavy objects&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed, Stone-boat&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Rock (geology)|stone]]s or [[hay]] [[baler|bales]]. Originally they were for [[animal-powered transport]] used with [[horse]]s or [[oxen]] to clear fields of stones and other uses and may still be used with animals or [[tractor]]s today
.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lilligren.com/homestead/stoneboat.htm A Cheap Alternative Method for Moving Large Round Bales]&lt;/ref&gt;

The device may look like a low-profile sled with timber runners or have a flat bottom of planks secured together to slide over soft ground or snow.  Originally  made of [[wood]],  [[metal]] versions exist with hinges.

[[File:Esfera Precolombina en Univ de Costa Rica.JPG|thumb|Pre-Columbian stone sphere, located at the University of Costa Rica as a symbol of tradition and ancient wisdom.]]
The '''stone spheres''' (or '''stone balls''') '''of Costa Rica''' are an assortment of over three hundred [[petrosphere]]s in [[Costa Rica]], located on the Diquís Delta and on [[Isla del Caño]]. Locally, they are known as '''Las Bolas''' (literally '''The Balls'''). The spheres are commonly attributed to the extinct [[Diquis]] culture and are sometimes referred to as the '''Diquís Spheres'''.  They are the best-known stone sculptures of the [[Isthmo-Colombian]] area.  They are thought to have been placed in lines along the approach to the houses of chiefs, but their exact significance remains uncertain.

The '''Palmar Sur Archeological Excavations''' are a series of excavations of a site located in the southern portion of [[Costa Rica]], known as the Diquís Delta. The excavations have centered on a site known as "Farm 6",  dating back to the Aguas Buenas Period (300–800 [[Common era|CE]]) and Chiriquí Period (800–1550 CE).

In June 2014, the Precolumbian Chiefdom Settlements with Stone Spheres of the Diquis was added to the UNESCO list of [[World Heritage Site]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1160|title=Six new sites inscribed on World Heritage List|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=23 June 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The spheres range in size from a few centimetres to over {{convert|2|m|ft}} in diameter, and weigh up to 15 tons.&lt;ref name="bbc2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=The stone spheres of Costa Rica |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8593717.stm |date=29 March 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most are sculpted from [[gabbro]],&lt;ref name="bbc2010"/&gt; the coarse-grained equivalent of [[basalt]]. There are a dozen or so made from shell-rich [[limestone]], and another dozen made from a [[sandstone]].  They appear to have been made by hammering natural boulders with other rocks, then polishing with sand.  The degree of finishing and precision of working varies considerably. The gabbro came from sites in the hills, several kilometres away from where the finished spheres are found, though some unfinished spheres remain in the hills. They are used for decoration.

==Geographic setting and location==
The archaeological site of Palmar Sur is located in the southern portion of Costa Rica, known as the Diquís Delta, and in the southernmost part of the Puntarenas Province. The Diquís Delta is defined as the alluvial plain with the geographical boundaries of the Fila Grisera to the north and east, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the Osa Mountains comprising the southern boundary.

The Site is located in [[Palmar Sur]], southern [[Costa Rica]]. The site is located on approximately 10 hectares of property that was previously owned by the [[United Fruit Company]] in the alluvial plain of the Térraba River.

==Site description==
[[File:Farm 6 archaeological site, Costa Rica.jpg|thumb|right|250px|View of the Farm 6 Archaeological site]]
The archaeological site of Farm 6 has been dated to the Aguas Buenas Period (300–800 CE) and Chiriquí Period (800–1550 CE). It was a multifunctional site accommodating a settlement and a cemetery, and remains of monumental architecture and sculpture are also present on the site. The monumental architecture consists of two mounds which were constructed with retaining walls made of rounded river cobbles and filled with earth.  The site contains multiple locations where large stone spheres are found ''in situ''. Additionally, since many of the stone spheres in the region were removed from their original locations and serve as landscape decoration, the site has become a storage location for spheres that have been returned to the National Museum. Also, there is a neighboring town to Farm 6 that also had spheres or "esferas." They were called "zanahoriagas," for their more oval-like shape.

==Pre-Columbian history==
[[File:Pre-Columbian Stone Balls at Palmar Sur, Costa Rica.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Palmar Sur airport park]]
The stones are believed to have been first created around the year 600, with most dating to after 1000 but before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquest]]. The only method available for dating the carved stones is [[Stratification (archeology)|stratigraphy]], but most stones are no longer in their original locations. The culture of the people who made them disappeared after the Spanish conquest.&lt;ref name="lynch"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-03/uok-uok032210.php|title=University of Kansas researcher investigates mysterious stone spheres in Costa Rica|author=Brendan M. Lynch|date=22 Mar 2010|accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-contact history==
The spheres were discovered in the 1930s as the United Fruit Company was clearing the jungle for [[banana plantation]]s.&lt;ref name="lynch"/&gt; Workmen pushed them aside with bulldozers and heavy equipment, damaging some spheres. Additionally, inspired by [[El Dorado|stories of hidden gold]], workmen began to drill holes into the spheres and blow them open with sticks of [[dynamite]]. Several of the spheres were destroyed before authorities intervened. Some of the dynamited spheres have been reassembled and are currently on display at the [[Museo Nacional de Costa Rica|National Museum of Costa Rica]] in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]].

The first scientific investigation of the spheres was undertaken shortly after their discovery by Doris Stone, a daughter of a United Fruit executive. These were published in 1943 in ''[[American Antiquity]]'', attracting the attention of [[Samuel Kirkland Lothrop]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Biographical memoirs, Volume 48| chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=43U3AD_F9UMC&amp;pg=PA253| page=253|chapter=Samuel Kirkland Lothrup| author=National Academy of Sciences| publisher=[[National Academies Press]] | year=1877| accessdate=2010-03-31| authorlink= United States National Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Tim McGuinness| url=http://www.mysteryspheres.com/history.htm| title=Costa Rican Diquis Spheres: Sphere history| publisher=mysteryspheres.com| accessdate=2010-03-31| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329102018/http://www.mysteryspheres.com/history.htm| archivedate=2010-03-29| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, he and his wife attempted to excavate an unrelated archaeological site in the northern region of Costa Rica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Prehistoric Stone Balls—a Mystery| url= http://naturalhistorymag.com/print/1353| author=Eleanor Lothrop| publisher=[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]] | work=Picks from the Past | date=September 1955| accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government had just disbanded its professional army, and the resulting civil unrest threatened the security of Lothrop's team.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In San José he met Doris Stone, who directed the group toward the Diquís Delta region in the southwest ("Valle de Diquís" refers to the valley of the lower [[Térraba River|Río Grande de Térraba]], including the [[Osa Canton]] towns of [[Ciudad Cortés|Puerto Cortés]], [[Palmar Norte]], and [[Sierpe]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/costaricagaz.shtml#Diquis Gazetteer of Costa Rican Plant-Collecting Locales: Diquís (or Dikís)] from the website of the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]]&lt;/ref&gt;) and provided them with valuable dig sites and personal contacts. Lothrop's findings were published in ''Archaeology of the Diquís Delta, Costa Rica 1963''.

In 2010, University of Kansas researcher John Hoopes visited the site of the Stone Spheres to evaluate their eligibility for protection as a [[Unesco]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8593717.stm |title=The stone spheres of Costa Rica |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-29 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
[[File:UFCO remnants.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Remnants of UFCO occupation in Palmar Sur]]

Before the arrival of the Companía Bananera de Costa Rica, a branch of the United Fruit Company, and banana plantations in the 1930s, vegetation in this area offered a great deal of biodiversity in both plant and animal resources. Resources available to Precolumbian inhabitants in this alluvial plain consisted of riverine and ocean resources, including mangrove forests located in the Terraba and Sierpe Rivers.

[[File:Palmar Sur, Costa Rica (2007).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Modern Landscape of Palmar Sur, Costa Rica]]

The rich alluvial soils of this region facilitated historical agriculture since the 1930s. The United Fruit Company dominated this southern region with banana plantations as early as the 1920s in Parrita and Quepos. The UFCO entered Palmar Sur in the 1930s under the name of Companía Bananera de Costa Rica in an effort to avoid antimonopoly legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Villalobos 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Today the landscape is still carved into agricultural fields which are owned by co-ops and consist of plantain, banana, and palm plantations.

==Early researchers in the region==
Scientific research in the alluvial plain, particularly on United Fruit Company properties, began in the 1940s with the work of [[Doris Zemurray Stone]] and Samuel Lothrop. Lothrop's work focused on excavation at a handful of sites, one being Farm 4. His work aimed to document all archaeological sites containing "in situ" stone spheres, to record the number of spheres and their dimensions, and to make detailed maps illustrating both their arrangement and alignments.

After the work of Lothrop and Stone, research in the area took a hiatus for nearly fifty years.  In the 1990s, [[Claude Baudez]] and a team of researchers set out to establish a ceramic chronology of the region by observing the change in ceramic styles over time.&lt;ref&gt;Baudez, ''et al.'' 1993&lt;/ref&gt; This was accomplished by examining the drainage ditches that were cut into the landscape by the UFCO. Research carried out by [[Ifigenia Quintanilla]], under the direction of the MNCR from 1991–1996 was performed in the region under the project titled "Man and Environment in Sierpe-Terraba" focusing on settlement patterns, occupational sequences, and resources utilized in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Quintanilla 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Francisco Corrales and Adrian Badilla, archaeologists with the Museo Nacional de Costa Rica, have performed continuous research in the region since 2002.  Their research began in 2002 and focused on four archaeological sites in the region containing stone spheres and of which comprise a "circuit". These sites include Grijalba, Batambal, El Silencio, and "Farm 6". The purpose of the project was to assess the cultural significance of the sites, to protect the cultural heritage, in addition to beginning research and studies at the sites.&lt;ref&gt;Corrales and Badilla 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Corrales and Badilla produced a booklet entitled ''El Paisaje Cultural del Delta del Diquís'' which provides a quick overview on the history of the Diquís Delta, the history of banana plantations and the UFCO, the natural environment, archaeological sites in the region, and the importance of the Diquís region as an [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Site.&lt;ref&gt;Corrales and Badilla 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has continued in the region by Corrales and Badilla focusing on the archaeology and the Precolumbian political structure in the Diquís Delta. Research emphasis was on chiefdoms and their associated archaeological indicators. Their objectives were to study the archaeological sites containing stone spheres in the Diquís Subregion to gain an understanding of community configuration, activity areas, sequences of occupation, and the recording of monumental architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Corrales and Badilla 2005, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==
Research is currently ongoing at the "Farm 6" site under the direction of archaeologists at the Museo Nacional de Costa Rica. The first field season in which archaeological excavations were undertaken was in 2005. Objectives during this field season included defining the area in which two mounds were located, sphere alignments, and various excavations associated with mound 2. In 2007, as second field season was undertaken focusing on archaeological excavations of Mound 1. During this field season, a stone sphere was discovered "in situ"  in association with the mound.

==Tourism==
Archaeo-tourism is a concept that is still relatively new in Costa Rica.  To date, the national monument of [[Guayabo]] de Turrialba is primarily the only archaeological site open for tourism.  Tourism on a smaller scale is occurring at the site of Farm 6 but is open to visitors upon paying a nominal fee to tour the museum display and then tour the grounds, viewing some of the discovery sites.  It is no longer necessary to have an appointment.  Future plans of the MNCR are to open the site to tourism on a larger scale and to include other sites nearby in the region.

==Myths==
Numerous myths surround the stones, such as they came from [[Atlantis]], or that they were made as such by nature. Some local legends state that the native inhabitants had access to a potion able to soften the rock. [[Limestone]], for example, can be dissolved by acidic solutions obtained from plants. Research led by [[Joseph Davidovits]] of the [[Geopolymer Institute]] in France has been offered in support of this hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geopolymer.org/dl/?x=pdf&amp;get=CemPlant.pdf|title=Making Cements with Plant Extracts|author=Joseph Davidovits|accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the spheres were created from [[gabbro]], an acid-resistant igneous rock.&lt;ref name="SkeptoidEpisode"&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4452|number=452|date=3 February 2015|title=The Stone Spheres of Costa Rica|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cosmogony of the Bribri, which is shared by the Cabecares and other American ancestral groups, the stone spheres are “Tara’s cannon balls”. Tara or Tlatchque, the god of thunder, used a giant blowpipe to shoot the balls at the Serkes, gods of winds and hurricanes, in order to drive them out of these lands.

It has been claimed that the spheres are perfect, or very near perfect in roundness, although some spheres are known to vary over {{convert|5|cm}} in diameter.  Also, the stones have been damaged and eroded over the years, and so it is impossible to know exactly their original shape.  A review of the way that the stones were measured by Lothrop reveals that claims of precision are due to misinterpretations of the methods used in their measurement.  Although Lothrop published tables of ball diameters with figures to three decimal places, these figures were actually averages of measurements taken with tapes that were nowhere near that precise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ku.edu/~hoopes/balls/errors.htm |title=Errors and Misinformation |author=John W.

'''São Paulo Tramway, Light and Power Company''', also known as '''Light São Paulo''' or simply '''Light''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈlajtʃ}}), was a privately owned utility company operating in [[São Paulo]], Brazil from 1899 until 1981.&lt;ref name=Brookfield&gt;{{cite web|title=A história da Brookfield no Brasil|url=http://br.brookfield.com/Brookfield/nossahistoria/sp|website=br.brookfield.com|publisher=Brookfield Asset Management|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Canadians [[William Mackenzie (railway entrepreneur)|William Mackenzie]] and [[Frederick Stark Pearson]] founded the São Paulo Tramway, Light and Power Company in 1899. In 1900 Light São Paulo began operating the first [[tram]] line in the city of São Paulo which ran to [[Barra Funda (district of São Paulo)|Barra Funda]].&lt;ref name="Brookfield"/&gt;

[[File:Barragem Guarapiranga-Sao Paulo.jpg|thumbnail|right|Reservoir at Guarapiranga today]]

Work began in 1901 on the [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric plant]] in [[Santana de Parnaíba]]. It opened in 1905.&lt;ref name="Brookfield"/&gt; In 1905 the company installed the first [[electric street lights]] on Rua Barão de Itapetininga. In 1906 the company constructed a [[reservoir]] at [[Guarapiranga]]. In 1907 they installed 50 more lights on Rua Direita, Rua 15 de Novembro, and Rua São Bento.&lt;ref name=Ilume&gt;{{cite web|title=História da Iluminação|url=http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/cidade/secretarias/servicos/ilume/historia/index.php?p=312|website=prefeitura.sp.gov.br|publisher=Ilume - Departamento de Iluminação Pública|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company signed a contract with the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] for the first time in 1911. By 1916 they had installed 8,605 [[gas lighting|gas lights]] and 864 electric street lamps in the city.&lt;ref name=Ilume/&gt;

==Successors==

SPTL&amp;P's tramways were acquired by [[Companhia Municipal de Transportes Coletivos]] in 1946, SPTL&amp;P line disappeared in the early 1960s and  eventually the city's remaining tram routes by 1968 with buses or trolleybuses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tramz.com/br/tto/6SP1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916 the telephone companies merged to create the Companhia Telefônica Brasileira (CTB)&lt;ref name="Brookfield"/&gt; and now succeeded  by what is now [[Telebrás]].

During the 1930s, while [[Fábio da Silva Prado]] was mayor, electric light was brought to the rest of the city. This expansion continued under [[Francisco Prestes Maia|Prestes Maia]] in the following decades.&lt;ref name=Ilume/&gt;

In 1947 the utility companies were nationalized.&lt;ref name="Brookfield"/&gt;

In 1981 the city government under Mayor [[Paulo Maluf]] created [[Eletropaulo]].&lt;ref name=Maluf&gt;{{cite web|title=Histórico Político|url=http://www.malufsp.com.br/pPage.asp?pPAGnID=62|website=malufsp.com.br|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Three-phase electric power''' is a common method of [[alternating current]] [[electric power]] [[Electricity generation|generation]], [[Electric power transmission|transmission]], and [[Electric power distribution|distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;William D. Stevenson, Jr. ''Elements of Power System Analysis Third Edition'', McGraw-Hill, New York (1975). {{ISBN|0-07-061285-4}}, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of [[polyphase system]] and is the most common method used by [[electrical grid]]s worldwide to transfer power. It is also used to power large [[Electric motor|motors]] and other heavy loads.

A three-wire three-phase circuit is usually more economical than an equivalent two-wire [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] circuit at the same line to ground [[voltage]] because it uses less conductor material to transmit a given amount of electrical power.&lt;ref&gt; Terrell Croft, Wilford Summers (ed), ''American Electricians' Handbook, 11th ed.'', McGraw Hill, 1987 {{ISBN|0-07-013932-6}} page 3-10 figure 3-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
Polyphase power systems were independently invented by [[Galileo Ferraris]], [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]], [[Jonas Wenström]], [[John Hopkinson]] and [[Nikola Tesla]] in the late 1880s.

== Principle ==
[[File:3 phase AC waveform.svg|thumb|Normalized [[waveform]]s of the instantaneous voltages in a three-phase system in one cycle with time increasing to the right. The phase order is 1‑2‑3. This cycle repeats with the [[utility frequency|frequency]] of the power system. Ideally, each phase’s [[voltage]], current, and power is offset from the others’ by 120°.]]

[[File:Three Phase Electric Power Transmission.jpg|thumb|Three-phase electric power transmission lines]]

[[File:Transzformator-allomas.jpg|thumb|Three-phase transformer (Békéscsaba, Hungary): on the left are the primary wires and on the right are the secondary wires]]

In a symmetric three-phase power supply system, three conductors each carry an [[alternating current]] of the same frequency and voltage amplitude relative to a common reference but with a phase difference of one third of a cycle between each. The common reference is usually connected to ground and often to a current-carrying conductor called the neutral. Due to the phase difference, the voltage on any conductor reaches its peak at one third of a cycle after one of the other conductors and one third of a cycle before the remaining conductor. This phase delay gives constant power transfer to a balanced linear load. It also makes it possible to produce a rotating magnetic field in an [[electric motor]] and generate other phase arrangements using transformers (for instance, a two phase system using a [[Scott-T transformer]]).  The amplitude of the voltage difference between two phases is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; times the amplitude of the voltage of the individual phases.

The symmetric three-phase systems described here are simply referred to as ''three-phase systems'' because, although it is possible to design and implement asymmetric three-phase power systems (i.e., with unequal voltages or phase shifts), they are not used in practice because they lack the most important advantages of symmetric systems.

In a three-phase system feeding a balanced and linear load, the sum of the instantaneous currents of the three conductors is zero. In other words, the current in each conductor is equal in magnitude to the sum of the currents in the other two, but with the opposite sign. The return path for the current in any phase conductor is the other two phase conductors.

=== Advantages ===
As compared to a single-phase AC power supply that uses two conductors (phase and [[ground and neutral|neutral]]), a three-phase supply with no neutral and the same phase-to-ground voltage and current capacity per phase can transmit three times as much power using just 1.5 times as many wires (i.e., three instead of two). Thus, the ratio of capacity to conductor material is doubled.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, H, ''Electrical Technology'', 6th Ed., Pitman, London, 1950, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of capacity to conductor material increases to 3:1 with an ungrounded three-phase and center-grounded single-phase system (or 2.25:1 if both employ grounds of the same gauge as the conductors).

Constant power transfer and cancelling phase currents would in theory be possible with any number (greater than one) of phases, maintaining the capacity-to-conductor material ratio that is twice that of single-phase power. However, two-phase power results in a less smooth (pulsating) torque in a generator or motor (making smooth power transfer a challenge), and more than three phases complicates infrastructure unnecessarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Electric Power Systems|last=von Meier|first=Alexandra|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=978-0-471-17859-0|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|pages=160|quote=We also stated one rationale for this three-phase system; namely, that a three-phase generator experiences a constant torque on its rotor as opposed to the pulsating torque that appears in a single- or two-phase machine, which is obviously preferable from a mechanical engineering standpoint.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three-phase systems may also have a fourth wire, particularly in low-voltage distribution.  This is the [[ground and neutral|neutral]] wire.  The neutral allows three separate single-phase supplies to be provided at a constant voltage and is commonly used for supplying groups of domestic properties which are each [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] loads.  The connections are arranged so that, as far as possible in each group, equal power is drawn from each phase.  Further up the [[electric power distribution|distribution system]], the currents are usually well balanced. Transformers may be wired in a way that they have a four-wire secondary but a three-wire primary while allowing unbalanced loads and the associated secondary-side neutral currents.

Three-phase supplies have properties that make them very desirable in electric power distribution systems:

* The phase currents tend to cancel out one another, summing to zero in the case of a linear balanced load.  This makes it possible to reduce the size of the neutral conductor because it carries little or no current. With a balanced load, all the phase conductors carry the same current and so can be the same size.
* Power transfer into a linear balanced load is constant, which helps to reduce generator and motor vibrations.
* Three-phase systems can produce a [[rotating magnetic field]] with a specified direction and constant magnitude, which simplifies the design of electric motors, as no starting circuit is required.

Most household loads are single-phase. In North American residences, three-phase power might feed a multiple-unit apartment block, but the household loads are connected only as single phase. &lt;!--you might have 120-208 4 wire with lights and plugs on 120 and the stove and AC on 208 V single phase...so two phase wires come into each unit, but the loads are all single phase...do we need to explain that here in such detail?--&gt; In lower-density areas, only a single phase might be used for distribution. Some high-power domestic appliances such as electric stoves and clothes dryers are powered by [[Split-phase electric power| a split phase system at 240 volts]] or from two phases of a three phase system at 208 volts.

=== Phase sequence ===
Wiring for the three phases is typically identified by color codes which vary by country. Connection of the phases in the right order is required to ensure the intended direction of rotation of three-phase motors. For example, pumps and fans may not work in reverse. Maintaining the identity of phases is required if there is any possibility two sources can be connected at the same time; a direct interconnection between two different phases is a short-circuit.

At the [[power station]], an [[electrical generator]] converts mechanical power into a set of three [[Alternating current|AC]] [[electric current]]s, one from each coil (or winding) of the generator. The windings are arranged such that the currents vary [[Sine wave|sinusoidally]] at the same frequency but with the peaks and troughs of their [[wave]] forms offset to provide three complementary currents with a phase separation of one-third cycle ([[Sine wave|120° or {{frac|2π|3}} radians]]).  The [[utility frequency|generator frequency]] is typically 50 or 60 [[Hertz|Hz]], depending on the country.

At the power station, [[transformer]]s change the voltage from generators to a level suitable for [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] in order to minimize losses.

After further voltage conversions in the transmission network, the voltage is finally transformed to the standard utilization before power is supplied to customers.

Most automotive alternators generate three-phase AC and rectify it to DC with a [[diode bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170830033252/http://www.rle.mit.edu/per/ConferencePapers/cpConvergence00p583.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transformer connections ==
A "delta" connected transformer winding is connected between phases of a three-phase system. A "wye" transformer connects each winding from a phase wire to a common neutral point.

A single three-phase transformer can be used, or three single-phase transformers.

In an "open delta" or "V" system, only two transformers are used. A closed delta made of three single-phase transformers can operate as an open delta if one of the transformers has failed or needs to be removed.&lt;ref name="Fowler" /&gt; In open delta, each transformer must carry current for its respective phases as well as current for the third phase, therefore capacity is reduced to 87%. With one of three transformers missing and the remaining two at 87% efficiency, the capacity is 58% ({{frac|2|3}} of 87%).&lt;ref name=power&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGraw-Hill|title=Three-Phase Power from Single-Phase Transformer Connections|journal=Power|year=1920|volume=51|issue=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u91QAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA673&amp;lpg=PA673|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Beaty, D.G. Fink (ed) ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers Fifteenth Edition'', McGraw-Hill, 2007 {{ISBN|0-07-144146-8}}, p. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a delta-fed system must be grounded for detection of stray current to ground or protection from surge voltages, a grounding transformer (usually a [[zigzag transformer]]) may be connected to allow ground fault currents to return from any phase to ground. Another variation is a "corner grounded" delta system, which is a closed delta that is grounded at one of the junctions of transformers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.schneider-electric.us/docs/Circuit%20Protection/Molded%20Case%20Circuit%20Breakers/2700DB0202.pdf Schneider]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three-wire and four-wire circuits ==
[[File:The basic 3-phase configurations.svg|thumb|Wye&amp;nbsp;(Y) and delta&amp;nbsp;(Δ) circuits]]

There are two basic three-phase configurations: wye&amp;nbsp;(Y) and delta&amp;nbsp;(Δ). As shown in the diagram, a delta configuration requires only three wires for transmission but a wye (star) configuration may have a fourth wire. The fourth wire, if present, is provided as a neutral and is normally grounded. The "3-wire" and "4-wire" designations do not count the [[ground wire]] present above many transmission lines, which is solely for fault protection and does not carry current under normal use.

A four-wire system with symmetrical voltages between phase and neutral is obtained when the neutral is connected to the "common star point" of all supply windings. In such a system, all three phases will have the same magnitude of voltage relative to the neutral. Other non-symmetrical systems have been used.

The four-wire wye system is used when a mixture of single-phase and three-phase loads are to be served, such as mixed lighting and motor loads. An example of application is local distribution in Europe (and elsewhere), where each customer may be only fed from one phase and the neutral (which is common to the three phases). When a group of customers sharing the neutral draw unequal phase currents, the common neutral wire carries the currents resulting from these imbalances. Electrical engineers try to design the three-phase power system for any one location so that the power drawn from each of three phases is the same, as far as possible at that site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rapid-tech.com.au/Fluke-2_Saving%20energy%20through%20load%20balancing.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911172708/http://www.rapid-tech.com.au/Fluke-2_Saving%20energy%20through%20load%20balancing.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical engineers also try to arrange the distribution network so the loads are balanced as much as possible, since the same principles that apply to individual premises also apply to the wide-scale distribution system power. Hence, every effort is made by supply authorities to distribute the power drawn on each of the three phases over a large number of premises so that, on average, as nearly as possible a balanced load is seen at the point of supply.
[[File:Delta-Wye Transformer.png|thumb|A delta-wye configuration across a transformer core (note that a practical transformer would have a different number of coils on each side).]]
For domestic use, some countries such as the [[United Kingdom|UK]] may supply one phase and neutral at a high current (up to 100&amp;nbsp;[[Ampere (unit)|A]]) to one property, while others such as [[Germany]] may supply 3&amp;nbsp;phases and neutral to each customer, but at a lower fuse rating, typically 40&amp;ndash;63&amp;nbsp;[[Ampere (unit)|A]] per phase, and "rotated" to avoid the effect that more load tends to be put on the first phase.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

[[File:High leg delta transformer.svg|thumb|right|A transformer for a "[[high-leg delta]]" system used for mixed single-phase and three-phase loads on the same distribution system. Three-phase loads such as motors connect to L1, L2, and L3. Single-phase loads would be connected between L1 or L2 and neutral, or between L1 and L2. The L3 phase is 1.73&amp;nbsp;times the L1 or L2 voltage to neutral so this leg is not used for single-phase loads.]] 

In North America, a [[high-leg delta]] supply is sometimes used where one winding of a delta-connected transformer feeding the load is center-tapped and that center tap is grounded and connected as a neutral as shown in the second diagram. This setup produces three different voltages: If the voltage between the center tap (neutral) and each of the top and bottom taps (phase and anti-phase) is 120&amp;nbsp;[[Volt (unit)|V]] (100%), the voltage across the phase and anti-phase lines is 240&amp;nbsp;V (200%), and the neutral to "high leg" voltage is ≈&amp;nbsp;208&amp;nbsp;V (173%).&lt;ref name="Fowler" /&gt;

The reason for providing the delta connected supply is usually to power large motors requiring a rotating field. However, the premises concerned will also require the "normal" North American 120&amp;nbsp;V supplies, two of which are derived (180&amp;nbsp;degrees "out of phase") between the "neutral" and either of the center tapped phase points.

== Balanced circuits ==
In the perfectly balanced case all three lines share equivalent loads. Examining the circuits we can derive relationships between line voltage and current, and load voltage and current for wye and delta connected loads.

In a balanced system each line will produce equal voltage magnitudes at phase angles equally spaced from each other. With V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; as our reference and V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; lagging V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lagging V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, using [[angle notation]], and V&lt;sub&gt;LN&lt;/sub&gt; the voltage between the line and the neutral we have:&lt;ref name="GloverSarma2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Duncan Glover|author2=Mulukutla S. Sarma|author3=Thomas J. Overbye|title=Power System Analysis &amp; Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrtXToLEbVoC|date=April 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-111-42579-1|pages=60–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V_1 = V_\text{LN}\angle 0^\circ,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V_2 = V_\text{LN}\angle{-120}^\circ,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V_3 = V_\text{LN}\angle{+120}^\circ.&lt;/math&gt;

These voltages feed into either a wye or delta connected load.

=== Wye (Y)  also called Star ===
[[File:3 Phase Power Connected to Wye Load.svg|thumb|Three-phase AC generator connected as a wye or star source to a wye or star connected load]]

The voltage seen by the load will depend on the load connection; for the wye case, connecting each load to a phase (line-to-neutral) voltages gives:&lt;ref name="GloverSarma2011" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; I_1 = \frac{V_1}{|Z_\text{total}|}\angle (-\theta),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; I_2 = \frac{V_2}{|Z_\text{total}|}\angle (-120^\circ - \theta),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; I_3 = \frac{V_3}{|Z_\text{total}|}\angle (120^\circ - \theta),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; is the sum of line and load impedances (''Z''&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; = ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;LN&lt;/sub&gt; + ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;), and ''θ'' is the phase of the total impedance (''Z''&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;).

The phase angle difference between voltage and current of each phase is not necessarily 0 and is dependent on the type of load impedance, ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;. Inductive and capacitive loads will cause current to either lag or lead the voltage. However, the relative phase angle between each pair of lines (1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1) will still be −120°.

By applying [[Kirchhoff's current law|Kirchhoff's current law (KCL)]] to the neutral node, the three phase currents sum to the total current in the neutral line. In the balanced case:

:[[File:Wye connection line voltages.png|thumb|A phasor diagram for a wye configuration, in which V&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt; represents a line voltage and V&lt;sub&gt;an&lt;/sub&gt; represents a phase voltage. Voltages are balanced as:&lt;p&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt; = (1∠α - 1∠α + 120°) {{sqrt|3}}&lt;nowiki&gt;*|V|∠α + 30°&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;bc&lt;/sub&gt; = {{sqrt|3}}&lt;nowiki&gt;*|V|∠α - 90°&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;p&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;ca&lt;/sub&gt; = {{sqrt|3}}&lt;nowiki&gt;*|V|∠α + 150°&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(α = 0 in this case)&lt;/p&gt; ]]&lt;math&gt; I_1 + I_2 + I_3 = I_\text{N} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Delta (Δ) ===
[[File:3 Phase Power Connected to Delta Load.svg|thumb|right|Three-phase AC generator connected as a wye source to a delta-connected load]]

In the delta circuit, loads are connected across the lines, and so loads see line-to-line voltages:

&lt;ref name="GloverSarma2011" /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V_{12} &amp;= V_1 - V_2 = (V_\text{LN}\angle 0^\circ) - (V_\text{LN}\angle {-120}^\circ) \\
       &amp;= \sqrt{3}V_\text{LN}\angle 30^\circ = \sqrt{3}V_{1}\angle (\phi_{V_1} + 30^\circ), \\

V_{23} &amp;= V_2 - V_3 = (V_\text{LN}\angle {-120}^\circ) - (V_\text{LN}\angle 120^\circ) \\
       &amp;= \sqrt{3}V_\text{LN}\angle {-90}^\circ = \sqrt{3}V_{2}\angle (\phi_{V_2} + 30^\circ), \\

V_{31} &amp;= V_3 - V_1 = (V_\text{LN}\angle 120^\circ) - (V_\text{LN}\angle 0^\circ) \\
       &amp;= \sqrt{3}V_\text{LN}\angle 150^\circ = \sqrt{3}V_{3}\angle (\phi_{V_3} + 30^\circ). \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

(Φ&lt;sub&gt;v1&lt;/sub&gt; is the phase shift for the first voltage, commonly taken to be 0° -- in this case Φ&lt;sub&gt;v2&lt;/sub&gt; = -120° and Φ&lt;sub&gt;v3&lt;/sub&gt; = -240° or 120°)

Further:

:&lt;math&gt; I_{12} = \frac{V_{12}}{|Z_\Delta|} \angle (30^\circ - \theta), &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; I_{23} = \frac{V_{23}}{|Z_\Delta|} \angle (-90^\circ - \theta), &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; I_{31} = \frac{V_{31}}{|Z_\Delta|} \angle (150^\circ - \theta), &lt;/math&gt;

where ''θ'' is the phase of delta impedance (''Z''&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt;).

Relative angles are preserved, so ''I''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt; lags ''I''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt; lags ''I''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; by 120°. Calculating line currents by using KCL at each delta node gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
I_1 &amp;= I_{12} - I_{31} = I_{12} - I_{12}\angle 120^\circ \\
    &amp;= \sqrt{3}I_{12} \angle (\phi_{I_{12}} - 30^\circ) = \sqrt{3}I_{12} \angle (-\theta)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for each other line:

:&lt;math&gt; I_2 = \sqrt{3}I_{23} \angle (\phi_{I_{23}}-30^\circ) = \sqrt{3}I_{23} \angle (-120^\circ - \theta), &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; I_3 = \sqrt{3}I_{31} \angle (\phi_{I_{31}}-30^\circ) = \sqrt{3}I_{31} \angle (120^\circ - \theta), &lt;/math&gt;

where, again, ''θ'' is the phase of delta impedance (''Z''&lt;sub&gt;Δ&lt;/sub&gt;).
[[File:Delta connection currents.png|thumb|A delta configuration and a corresponding phasor diagram of its currents. Phase voltages are equal to line voltages, and currents are calculated as:&lt;p&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt; - I&lt;sub&gt;ca&lt;/sub&gt; = {{sqrt|3}}I&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;∠-30°&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;bc&lt;/sub&gt; - I&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;ca&lt;/sub&gt; - I&lt;sub&gt;bc&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall power transferred is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3Φ&lt;/sub&gt; = 3V&lt;sub&gt;phase&lt;/sub&gt;I*&lt;sub&gt;phase&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
]]
Inspection of a phasor diagram, or conversion from phasor notation to complex notation, illuminates how the difference between two line-to-neutral voltages yields a line-to-line voltage that is greater by a factor of {{sqrt|3}}. As a delta configuration connects a load across phases of a transformer, it delivers the line-to-line voltage difference, which is {{sqrt|3}} times greater than the line-to-neutral voltage delivered to a load in the wye configuration. As the power transferred is V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/Z, the impedance in the delta configuration must be 3 times what it would be in a wye configuration for the same power to be transferred.

== Single-phase loads ==
Except in a [[high-leg delta]] system, single-phase loads may be connected across any two phases, or a load can be connected from phase to neutral.&lt;ref name="IAEI" /&gt; Distributing single-phase loads among the phases of a three-phase system balances the load and makes most economical use of conductors and transformers.

In a symmetrical three-phase four-wire, wye system, the three phase conductors have the same voltage to the system neutral. The voltage between line conductors is [[square root of 3|{{sqrt|3}}]] times the phase conductor to neutral voltage:&lt;ref&gt;The boy electrician by J W Sims M.I.E.E. (Page 98)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{LL} = \sqrt{3} V_\text{LN}.&lt;/math&gt;

The currents returning from the customers' premises to the supply transformer all share the neutral wire. If the loads are evenly distributed on all three phases, the sum of the returning currents in the neutral wire is approximately zero.  Any unbalanced phase loading on the secondary side of the transformer will use the transformer capacity inefficiently.

If the supply neutral is broken, phase-to-neutral voltage is no longer maintained. Phases with higher relative loading will experience reduced voltage, and phases with lower relative loading will experience elevated voltage, up to the phase-to-phase voltage.

A [[high-leg delta]] provides phase-to-neutral relationship of {{math|1=''V''&lt;sub&gt;LL&lt;/sub&gt; = 2 ''V''&lt;sub&gt;LN&lt;/sub&gt; }}, however, LN load is imposed on one phase.&lt;ref name=Fowler&gt;{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Nick|title=Electrician's Calculations Manual 2nd Edition|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-177017-0|pages=3–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9QBWHJdPGM0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; A transformer manufacturer's page suggests that LN loading not exceed 5% of transformer capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalpacific.com/university/transbasics/chapter3.html Federal pacific] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530122049/http://www.federalpacific.com/university/transbasics/chapter3.html |date=May 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since {{sqrt|3}} ≈ 1.73, defining {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;LN&lt;/sub&gt;}} as 100% gives {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;LL&lt;/sub&gt;}} {{math|1=≈ 100% × 1.73 = 173%}}. If {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;LL&lt;/sub&gt;}} was set as 100%, then {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;LN&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 57.7%}}.

=== Unbalanced loads ===
When the currents on the three live wires of a three-phase system are not equal or are not at an exact 120° phase angle, the power loss is greater than for a perfectly balanced system.  The method of [[symmetrical components]] is used to analyze unbalanced systems.

=== Non-linear loads ===
With linear loads, the neutral only carries the current due to imbalance between the phases. [[Gas-discharge lamp]]s and devices that utilize rectifier-capacitor front-end such as [[switch-mode power supplies]], computers, office equipment and such produce [[Harmonics (electrical power)#Third-order harmonics|third-order harmonics]] that are in-phase on all the supply phases. Consequently, such harmonic currents add in the neutral in a wye system (or in the grounded (zigzag) transformer in a delta system), which can cause the neutral current to exceed the phase current.&lt;ref name="IAEI"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowenstein|first=Michael|title=The 3rd Harmonic Blocking Filter: A Well Established Approach to Harmonic Current Mitigation|url=http://www.iaei.org/blogpost/890108/159506/The-3rd-Harmonic-Blocking-Filter-A-Well-Established-Approach-to-Harmonic-Current-Mitigation|publisher=IAEI Magazine|accessdate=24 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130908001044/http://www.iaei.org/blogpost/890108/159506/The-3rd-Harmonic-Blocking-Filter-A-Well-Established-Approach-to-Harmonic-Current-Mitigation|archivedate=8 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Enjeti|first=Prasad|title=Harmonics in Low Voltage Three-Phase Four-Wire Electric Distribution Systems and Filtering Solutions|url=http://www.pserc.wisc.edu/documents/general_information/presentations/pserc_seminars/pserc_seminars0/enjeti_slides.pdf|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Power Electronics and Power Quality Laboratory|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three-phase loads ==
{{See also|Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets}}
An important class of three-phase load is the [[electric motor]]. A three-phase induction motor has a simple design, inherently high starting torque and high efficiency. Such motors are applied in industry for many applications. A three-phase motor is more compact and less costly than a single-phase motor of the same voltage class and rating, and single-phase AC motors above 10 HP (7.5&amp;nbsp;kW) are uncommon. Three-phase motors also vibrate less and hence last longer than single-phase motors of the same power used under the same conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alexander |first1=Charles K.|last2=Sadiku |first2=Matthew N. O.|date=2007 |title=Fundamentals of Electric Circuits |page=504|location=New York, NY |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-297718-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance heating loads such as electric [[boiler]]s or space heating may be connected to three-phase systems. Electric lighting may also be similarly connected.

Line frequency flicker in light is detrimental to [[high speed camera]]s used in sports event broadcasting for [[slow motion]] replays.  It can be reduced by evenly spreading line frequency operated light sources across the three phases so that the illuminated area is lit from all three phases.  This technique was applied successfully at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.&lt;ref name=3phlight&gt;{{cite web|last=Hui|first=Sun|title=Sports Lighting&amp;nbsp;– Design Considerations For The Beijing 2008 Olympic Games|url=http://www.geappliances.com/email/olympic_specifier/downloads/SportsLightinginBeijing2008OlympicGames.pdf|publisher=GE Lighting|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rectifier]]s may use a three-phase source to produce a six-pulse DC output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=ACSL/Graphic Modeller Component Models for Electric Power Education |first=Steven |last=Pekarek |first2=Timothy |last2=Skvarenina |date=November 1998 |volume=41 |issue=4 |journal=IEEE Transactions on Education |url=http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/es/Nov1998/08/CONVERTR.HTM |doi=10.1109/TE.1998.787374 |page=348|bibcode=1998ITEdu..41..348P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The output of such rectifiers is much smoother than rectified single phase and, unlike single-phase, does not drop to zero between pulses. Such rectifiers may be used for battery charging, [[electrolysis]] processes such as [[aluminium production]] or for operation of DC motors. [[Zigzag transformer|"Zig-zag" transformer]]s may make the equivalent of six-phase full-wave rectification, twelve pulses per cycle, and this method is occasionally employed to reduce the cost of the filtering components, while improving the quality of the resulting DC.

[[File:Perilex Stecker.jpg|thumb|right|Three phase plug commonly used on electric stoves in Europe]]
One example of a three-phase load is the [[electric arc furnace]] used in [[steelmaking]] and in refining of ores.

In many European countries electric stoves are usually designed for a three-phase feed. Individual heating units are often connected between phase and neutral to allow for connection to a single-phase circuit if three-phase is not available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O3gnAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22full+size+cookers+for+Europe+have+to+be+connected+to+a+three-phase+star+connected+supply%22&amp;dq=%22full+size+cookers+for+Europe+have+to+be+connected+to+a+three-phase+star+connected+supply%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fSipUKXYCfCk0AX4zYDoBA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA "British and European practices for domestic appliances compared"], ''Electrical Times'', volume 148, page 691, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Other usual three-phase loads in the domestic field are [[Tankless water heating|tankless water heating systems]] and [[storage heater]]s.  Homes in Europe and the UK have standardized on a nominal 230&amp;nbsp;V between any phase and ground.  (Existing supplies remain near 240&amp;nbsp;V in the UK, and 220&amp;nbsp;V on much of the continent.)  Most groups of houses are fed from a three-phase street transformer so that individual premises with above-average demand can be fed with a second or third phase connection.

== Phase converters ==
[[Phase converter]]s are used when three-phase equipment needs to be operated on a single-phase power source. &lt;!-- what about the example for operating a large single phase load on a 3ph generator and need to balance it across 3 phases?  --&gt;They are used when three-phase power is not available or cost is not justifiable. Such converters may also allow the frequency to be varied, allowing speed control. Some railway locomotives use a single-phase source to drive three-phase motors fed through an electronic drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Speeding-up Conventional Lines and Shinkansen|journal=Japan Railway &amp; Transport Review|date=Oct 2011|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr58/pdf/51-60web.pdf|volume=No. 58|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[rotary phase converter]] is a three-phase motor with special starting arrangements and [[power factor]] correction that produces balanced three-phase voltages. When properly designed, these rotary converters can allow satisfactory operation of a three-phase motor on a single-phase source. In such a device, the energy storage is performed by the [[inertia]] (flywheel effect) of the rotating components. An external flywheel is sometimes found on one or both ends of the shaft.

A three-phase generator can be driven by a single-phase motor. This motor-generator combination can provide a frequency changer function as well as phase conversion, but requires two machines with all their expenses and losses.  The motor-generator method can also form an [[uninterruptible power supply]] when used in conjunction with a large flywheel and a battery-powered DC motor; such a combination will deliver nearly constant power compared to the temporary frequency drop experienced with a standby generator set gives until the standby generator kicks in.

Capacitors and [[autotransformer]]s can be used to approximate a three-phase system in a static phase converter, but the voltage and phase angle of the additional phase may only be useful for certain loads. 

[[Variable-frequency drive]]s  and [[Phase converter#Digital phase converter|digital phase converters]] use power electronic devices to synthesize a balanced three-phase supply from single-phase input power.

== Alternatives to three-phase ==
* [[Split-phase electric power]] is used when three-phase power is not available and allows double the normal utilization voltage to be supplied for high-power loads.
* [[Two-phase electric power]] uses two AC voltages, with a 90-electrical-degree phase shift between them. Two-phase circuits may be wired with two pairs of conductors, or two wires may be combined, requiring only three wires for the circuit. Currents in the common conductor add to 1.4 times the current in the individual phases, so the common conductor must be larger. Two-phase and three-phase systems can be interconnected by a  [[Scott-T transformer]], invented by [[Charles F. Scott (engineer)|Charles F. Scott]].&lt;ref name="Brittain (2007)"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brittain |first=J. E. |title=Electrical Engineering Hall of Fame: Charles F. Scott |journal=[[Proceedings of the IEEE]] |year=2007 |volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=836–839 |doi=10.1109/JPROC.2006.892488}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very early AC machines, notably the first generators at [[Niagara Falls]], used a two-phase system, and some remnant two-phase distribution systems still exist, but three-phase systems have displaced the two-phase system for modern installations. 
* ''Monocyclic power'' was a name for an asymmetrical modified two-phase power system used by [[General Electric]] around 1897, championed by [[Charles Proteus Steinmetz]] and [[Elihu Thomson]].  This system was devised to avoid patent infringement. In this system, a generator was wound with a full-voltage single-phase winding intended for lighting loads and with a small fraction (usually 1/4 of the line voltage) winding that produced a voltage in quadrature with the main windings.  The intention was to use this "power wire" additional winding to provide starting torque for induction motors, with the main winding providing power for lighting loads.  After the expiration of the Westinghouse patents on symmetrical two-phase and three-phase power distribution systems, the monocyclic system fell out of use; it was difficult to analyze and did not last long enough for satisfactory energy metering to be developed.
* High-phase-order systems for power transmission have been built and tested. Such transmission lines typically would use six or twelve phases. High-phase-order transmission lines allow transfer of slightly less than proportionately higher power through a given volume without the expense of a [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) converter at each end of the line. However, they require correspondingly more pieces of equipment.

== Color codes ==
{{See also|Electrical wiring#Colour code}}
Conductors of a three-phase system are usually identified by a color code, to allow for balanced loading and to assure the correct phase rotation for [[electric motor|motors]].  Colors used may adhere to International Standard [[IEC 60446]] (now merged into [[IEC 60445]]), older standards or to no standard at all and may vary even within a single installation. For example, in the U.S. and Canada, different color codes are used for grounded (earthed) and ungrounded systems.

[[Image:Toyblocks.JPG|thumb|A set of blocks]]
'''Toy blocks''' (also '''building bricks''', '''building blocks''', or simply '''blocks''') are [[wooden]], [[plastic]], or [[foam]] pieces of various shapes ([[square (geometry)|square]], [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], [[arch]], [[triangle]], etc.) and [[color]]s that are used as [[Construction set|construction toy]]s.  Sometimes toy blocks depict [[Alphabet|letters of the alphabet]].

==History==
[[File:Thomas Eakins - Baby at Play.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''Baby at Play'', by [[Thomas Eakins]], 1876.]]

There are mentions of blocks or "dice" with alphabets inscribed on them used as entertaining educational tools in the works of English writer and inventor [[Hugh Plat]] (his 1594 book The ''Jewel House of Art and Nature'') and English philosopher [[John Locke]] (his 1693 essay ''Thoughts Concerning Education'').&lt;ref&gt;Alice Morse Earle (editor), Child life in colonial days,  New York : The Macmillan Company; London, Macmillan &amp; Co - 1899, pages 182-183 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karyn Wellhousen, Judith E. Kieff, A Constructivist Approach to Block Play in Early Childhood, Cengage Learning, 2001, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; Plat described them as "the child using to play much with them, and being always told what letter chanceth, will soon gain his Alphabet" and Locke noted "Thus Children may be cozen’d into a Knowledge of the Letters; be taught to read, without perceiving it to be anything but a Sport".

[[University of Pennsylvania]] professor of Urbanism [[Witold Rybczynski]] has found that the earliest mention of building bricks for children appears in [[Maria Edgeworth|Maria]] and [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth|R.L. Edgeworth's]] ''Practical Education'' (1798). Called "rational toys", blocks were intended to teach children about [[gravity]] and [[physics]], as well as spatial relationships that allow them to see how many different parts become a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[[Witold Rybczynski]], ''[[Looking Around: A Journey Through Architecture]]'', 2006{{page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1837 [[Friedrich Fröbel]] invented a preschool educational institution [[Kindergarten]]. For that, he designed ten [[Froebel Gifts]] based on building blocks principles. During the mid-nineteenth century, [[Henry Cole]] (under the [[pseudonym]] of Felix Summerly) wrote a series of [[children’s books]]. Cole's ''A book of stories from The Home Treasury'' included a box of [[terracotta]] toy blocks and, in the accompanying [[pamphlet]] "Architectural Pastime", actual blueprints.

In 2003 the [[National Toy Hall of Fame]] at [[The Strong]] museum in [[Rochester, New York]] inducted ABC blocks into their collection, granting it the title of one of America's toys of national significance.

==Educational benefits==
[[File:Dof blocks f22.jpg|thumb|Blocks with numbers, letters and pictures]]
*''Physical benefits'': toy blocks build strength in a child's fingers and hands, and improve eye-hand coordination.  They also help educate children in different shapes.   
*''Social benefits'': block play encourages children to make [[Friendship|friends]] and cooperate, and is often one of the first experiences a child has playing with others. Blocks are a benefit for the children because they encourage interaction and imagination. Creativity can be a combined action that is important for social play.
*''Intellectual benefits'': children can potentially develop their [[Vocabulary|vocabularies]] as they learn to describe sizes, shapes, and positions.  [[Mathematics|Math skills]] are developed through the process of grouping, adding, and subtracting, particularly with standardized blocks, such as [[unit block]]s.  Experiences with [[gravity]], [[Balance (ability)|balance]], and [[geometry]] learned from toy blocks also provide intellectual stimulation.
*''Creative benefits'': children receive creative stimulation by making their own designs with blocks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2002">A '''two-dimensional liquid''' ('''2D liquid''') is a collection of objects constrained to move in a planar or other two-[[dimension]]al space in a [[liquid]] state.

== Relations with 3D liquids ==
The movement of the particles in a 2D liquid is similar to 3D, but with limited degrees of freedom. E.g. rotational motion can be limited to [[rotation]] about only one axis, in contrast to a 3D liquid, where rotation of [[molecule]]s about two or three axis would be possible.
The same is true for the translational motion. The particles in 2D liquids can move in a 2D plane, whereas the particles is a 3D liquid can move in three directions inside the 3D volume.
Vibrational motion is in most cases not constrained in comparison to 3D.
The relations with other states of aggregation (see below) are also analogously in 2D and 3D.

== Relation to other states of aggregation ==
2D liquids are related to [[Two-dimensional gas|2D gases]]. If the density of a 2D liquid is decreased, a 2D gas is formed. This was observed by [[scanning tunnelling microscopy]] under [[ultra-high vacuum]] (UHV) conditions for molecular adsorbates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/cphc.200901028 |title=Substrate registry in disordered layers of large molecules |year=2010|last1=Waldmann|first1=T.|journal=ChemPhysChem|volume=11|pages=1513}}&lt;/ref&gt;
2D liquids are related to [[Two-dimensional solid|2D solids]]. If the density of a 2D liquid is increased, the rotational degree of freedom is frozen and a 2D solid is created.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Thomas Waldmann|Surname2=Jens Klein|Surname3=Harry E. Hoster|Surname4=R.

It has an online database&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wiki-Solar Database|url=http://wiki-solar.org/data/index.html|publisher=Wiki-Solar.org|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of over 4,000 operating and planned utility-scale solar generating stations. Many of the larger stations are shown on a global mapping system.&lt;ref name=Maps&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar parks map|url=http://www.wiki-solar.org/map/index.html|publisher=Wiki-Solar.org|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Footprints&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar park footprints|url=http://www.wiki-solar.org/map/sites/index.html|publisher=Wiki-Solar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Database of solar generation assets==

The core database holds information about known [[photovoltaic power station|photovoltaic generating projects]]. It records the project name, location, generating capacity and site area. It also stores key design data such as the projected annual output and carbon emission savings.

The database also records, where known, the key project participants; namely the owner, the developer, the [[Engineering, procurement and construction|EPC contractor]], the [[solar module]] and [[inverter]] suppliers and the utility to which the electrical output is delivered.

This database enables the extraction of global data on deployment of [[Photovoltaic system#Power plants|utility-scale solar generation]], used by many industry authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Record year for utility-scale solar|url=http://www.solaradvisorygroup.com/news-record-year-for-utility-scale-solar/|accessdate=Dec 2012|newspaper=Solar Advisory Group|date=20 Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wiki-Solar：2012年公共事业级光伏装机量达8.5GW|url=http://www.solarf.net/news/headline/2012-12-21/48814.html|accessdate=Dec 2012|newspaper=solarf.net|date=20 Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Global utility-scale solar tops 8.5GW|url=http://renews.biz/global-utility-scale-solar-tops-8-5gw/|accessdate=Dec 2012|newspaper=ReNews|date=12 Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the projects in the [[List of photovoltaic power stations]] are shown in the database and on the mapping.

===Definition of utility-scale solar power===

Projects are included in the database where they meet the definition for 'utility-scale solar'. The debate on this definition was initiated by the [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] Energy and Resources Cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Donnelly-Shores|first=Patrick|title=HOW BIG IS UTILITY-SCALE SOLAR?|url=http://berc.berkeley.edu/how-big-is-utility-scale-solar/|accessdate=27 February 2014|date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wiki-Solar concluded that it would set the threshold to include all systems above 4[[Megawatt|MW]] AC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfe|first=Philip|title=What do we mean by utility-scale?|url=http://wiki-solar.org/data/glossary/utility-scale.html|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Philip|title=Defining ‘utility-scale’ solar|journal=Wiki-Solar Glossary|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Philip|title=Defining ‘utility-scale’ solar: How we arrived at the threshold of 4MWAC|journal=Wiki-Solar Glossary|date=December 2013|url=http://wiki-solar.org/library/papers/WSG02-02_Utility-scale.pdf|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basis of capacity data===

This information resource has now standardized on quoting capacity figures in [[Megawatt|MW]]&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=rating&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Philip|title=Capacity rating for solar generating stations|journal=Wiki-Solar Glossary|date=July 2013|url=http://wiki-solar.org/library/papers/WSG01-01_Capacity.pdf|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This avoids the issue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheyney|first=Tom|title=AC-DC conundrum: Latest PV power-plant ratings follies put focus on reporting inconsistency (update)|url=http://www.pv-tech.org/chip_shots_blog/ac_dc_conundrum_latest_pv_power_plant_ratings_follies_put_focus_on_reportin/|accessdate=27 February 2014|newspaper=PV-Tech|date=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; where some plant capacities are quoted in [[Nominal power (photovoltaic)|megawatts peak]], the DC output of the solar array; while others are in MW&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;, the output delivered to the grid. The [[Alternating current|AC]] measure was selected to make it comparable to ratings of other electricity generation technologies.&lt;ref name=rating /&gt;

==Mapping==

Wiki-Solar's mapping&lt;ref name=Maps /&gt; shows markers for all projects over 10 [[watt-peak|megawatts peak]] (MW&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;), where the location is known. Many projects between 5 and 10 MW&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; are also shown, and differentiated with smaller markers.

The maps differentiate between operating projects, and those under construction and planned. The few decommissioned projects are also shown.

===Site plans===

A separate mapping system&lt;ref name=Footprints /&gt;  shows the actual site footprints of all projects where the site area is known.

Some of these are now visible on published satellite views, while others have been taken from site plans, but should appear on satellite photography in the future.

==Statistical analysis==

Based on the many projects recorded on the database, Wiki-Solar produces statistics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analysis of utility-scale solar parks|url=http://www.wiki-solar.org/analysis/index.html|publisher=Wiki-Solar.org|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a global and regional&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional data|url=http://www.wiki-solar.org/region/index.html|publisher=Wiki-Solar.org|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; basis showing key parameters such as the site area per [[megawatt]] of capacity and the annual energy delivered.

Based on at the applicable local energy costs and carbon intensities, it derives a value index for each geographic region.

==National analysis==

Wiki-Solar lists the leading countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar parks by country|url=http://www.wiki-solar.org/region/country.html|publisher=Wiki-Solar.org|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  based on their deployment of utility scale of photovoltaic power stations and summarises data by continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deployment of utility-scale solar parks by continent|url=http://www.wiki-solar.org/region/continent.html|publisher=Wiki-Solar|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also shows trends to indicate the relative progress in different countries, and is referenced by other experts in the sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Colthorpe|first=Andy|title=Wiki-Solar: US overtook China for installed utility-scale PV capacity in Q3 2013|url=http://www.pv-tech.org/news/wiki_solar_us_overtook_china_for_installed_utility_scale_pv_capacity_in_q3|accessdate=27 February 2014|newspaper=PV-Tech|date=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US set to overtake Germany for utility-scale solar power next year|url=http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/view/29266/us-set-to-overtake-germany-for-utility-scale-solar-power-next-year/|accessdate=Dec 2012|newspaper=Renewable Energy Focus|date=12 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leung|first=O|title=US set to become the world’s biggest market for PV power plants|url=http://sunwize.com/blog/?p=2337|accessdate=Dec 2012|newspaper=SunWize|date=19 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purpose of this analysis, the data is based on installations of 4 MW&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt; and above in accordance with Wiki-Solar's definition of 'utility-scale'.&lt;ref name=rating /&gt; Individual national maps are available for countries with a significant number of installations.

===Annual data===

After the end of each year statistics are provided showing the year's figures for each country alongside the cumulative capacity to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Global solar tops 9GW in 2012|url=http://renews.biz/global-solar-tops-9gw-in-2012/|accessdate=Jan 2013|newspaper=ReNews|date=16 Jan 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Utility-scale solar capacity tops 9GW, after another record year|url=http://www.solarplaza.com/article/utility-scale-solar-capacity-tops-9gw-after-anothe|accessdate=Jan 2013|newspaper=SolarPlaza|date=17 Jan 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=最新：2012全球光伏装机容量排名 中国第四|url=http://solar.ofweek.com/2013-01/ART-260009-8420-28663866.html|accessdate=Jan 2013|newspaper=ofweek|date=18 Jan 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global capacity of utility-scale [[Photovoltaics|PV]] power generation at the end of 2013 was reported to be 21 GW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Global utility-scale solar capacity climbs through 21GW in 2013|url=http://reneweconomy.com.au/2014/global-utility-scale-solar-capacity-climbs-through-21gw-in-2013-2013|accessdate=27 February 2014|newspaper=Renew Economy|date=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global capacity of utility-scale [[Photovoltaics|PV]] power generation at the end of 2014 was reported to be 36 GW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Utility-scale solar breaks all records in 2014 to reach 36 GW|url=http://wiki-solar.org/library/public/150305_Utility-solar_2014_figures_set%20multiple_records.pdf|website=Wiki-Solar.org|publisher=Wiki-Solar|accessdate=5 March 2015|ref=WS2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company analysis==

Using a similar calculation basis to the National analysis above, Wiki-Solar produces lists of the leading participants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Utility-scale PV plants by company|url=http://wiki-solar.org/company/index.html|publisher=Wiki-Solar.org|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for each of the major roles described above, again used by industry analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Willis|first=Ben|title=German and US integrators at forefront of large-scale solar|url=http://www.pv-tech.org/news/german_and_us_integrators_at_forefront_of_large_scale_solar|accessdate=Dec 2012|newspaper=PV Tech|date=28 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Self-integrators’ still dominate solar power plant module supplies|url=http://www.solarplaza.com/article/self-integrators-still-dominate-solar-power-plant|accessdate=Dec 2012|newspaper=SolarPlaza|date=14 Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual maps are available for companies with a significant number of installations.

==Solar Photovoltaic Projects book==

[[Image:NaCl polyhedra.png|thumb|Crystal structure of Wüstite]]

'''Wüstite''' ([[iron|Fe]][[oxygen|O]]) is a mineral form of [[iron(II) oxide]] found with [[meteorite]]s and [[native iron]]. It has a gray color with a greenish tint in reflected [[light]]. Wüstite crystallizes in the [[Cubic (crystal system)|isometric - hexoctahedral]] crystal system in opaque to translucent metallic grains. It has a [[Mohs hardness]] of 5 to 5.5 and a [[specific gravity]] of 5.88. Wüstite is a typical example of a [[non-stoichiometric compound]].

Wüstite was named for [[Fritz Wüst]] (1860–1938), a German [[metallurgist]] and founding director of the ''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Eisenforschung'' (presently [[Max Planck Institute for Iron Research GmbH]]).&lt;ref&gt;Schenck, Rudolf &amp; Dingmann, Th.; 1927: Gleichgewichtsuntersuchungen über die Reduktions-, Oxydations- und Kohlungsvorgänge beim Eisen III, in: Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie 166, p. 113-154, here p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the type locality in Germany, it has been reported from [[Disko Island]], Greenland; the [[Jharia]] coalfield, [[Jharkhand]], India and as inclusions in [[diamond]]s in a number of [[kimberlite]] pipes. It also is reported from deep sea [[manganese nodule]]s.

Its presence indicates a highly [[Redox|reducing]] environment.

== Wüstite redox buffer ==
{{main article|Mineral redox buffer}}

Wüstite, in geochemistry, defines a ''redox buffer'' of oxidation within rocks at which point the rock is so reduced that Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;,and thus [[hematite]], is absent.

As the redox state of a rock is further reduced, [[magnetite]] is converted to wüstite. This occurs by conversion of the Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in magnetite to Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. An example reaction is presented below:
:&lt;chem&gt;\underset{magnetite}{FeO.Fe2O3} + \underset{graphite/diamond}{C} -&gt; {3FeO} + \underset{carbon\ monoxide}{CO}&lt;/chem&gt;

The formula for magnetite is more accurately written as &lt;chem&gt;FeO.Fe2O3&lt;/chem&gt; than as Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Magnetite is one part FeO and one part Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, rather than a [[solid solution]] of wüstite and hematite. The magnetite is termed a ''redox buffer'' because until all Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; magnetite is converted to Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; the oxide mineral assemblage of [[iron]] remains wüstite-magnetite, and furthermore the redox state of the rock remains at the same level of [[oxygen]] [[fugacity]]. This is similar to buffering in the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; acid-base system of water.

Once the Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is consumed, then oxygen must be stripped from the system to further reduce it and wüstite is converted to native iron. The oxide mineral equilibrium assemblage of the rock becomes wüstite-magnetite-iron.

In nature, the only natural systems which are chemically reduced enough to even attain a wüstite-magnetite composition are rare, including carbonate-rich [[skarn]]s, meteorites, [[fulgurite]]s and lightning-affected rock, and perhaps the mantle where reduced carbon is present, exemplified by the presence of [[diamond]] and/or [[graphite]].

=== Effects upon silicate minerals ===
{{main|Normative mineralogy}}

The ratio of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; within a rock determines, in part, the silicate mineral assemblage of the rock. Within a rock of a given chemical composition, iron enters minerals based on the bulk chemical composition and the mineral phases which are stable at that temperature and pressure. Iron may only enter minerals such as [[pyroxene]] and [[olivine]] if it is present as Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;; Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; cannot enter the lattice of fayalite olivine and thus for every two Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, one Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is used and one molecule of magnetite is created.

In chemically reduced rocks, magnetite may be absent due to the propensity of iron to enter olivine, and wüstite may only be present if there is an excess of iron above what can be used by silica. Thus, wüstite may only be found in silica-undersaturated compositions which are also heavily chemically reduced, satisfying both the need to remove all Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and to maintain iron outside of silicate minerals.

In nature, carbonate rocks, potentially [[carbonatite]], [[kimberlite]]s, carbonate-bearing melilitic rocks and other rare alkaline rocks may satisfy these criteria. However, wüstite is not reported in most of these rocks in nature, potentially because the redox state necessary to drive magnetite to wüstite is so rare.

==Historical use==
According to Vagn Fabritius Buchwald, wustite was an important component during the [[Iron age]] to facilitate the process of [[forge welding]]. In ancient times, when [[blacksmithing]] was performed using a charcoal [[forge]], the deep [[charcoal]] pit in which the steel or iron was placed provided a highly-reducing, virtually oxygen-free environment, producing a thin wustite layer on the metal. At the welding temperature, the iron becomes highly reactive with oxygen, and will spark and form thick layers of [[slag]] when exposed to the air, which makes welding the iron or steel nearly impossible. To solve this problem, ancient blacksmiths would toss small amounts of sand onto the white-hot metal. The silicon in the sand then reacts with the wustite to form [[fayalite]], which melts just below the welding temperature. This produced an effective [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] that shielded the metal from oxygen and helped extract oxides and impurities, leaving a pure surface that can weld readily. Although the ancients had no knowledge of how this worked, the ability to [[welding|weld]] iron contributed to the movement out of the [[Bronze age]] and into the modern.&lt;ref&gt;''Iron and Steel in Ancient Times'' By Vagn Fabritius Buchwald -- Det Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab 2005 Page 65&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related minerals ==
Wüstite forms a solid solution with [[periclase]] ([[magnesium|Mg]]O), and Fe substitutes for Mg. Periclase, when hydrated, forms [[brucite]] (Mg(O[[hydrogen|H]])&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a common product of [[serpentinite]] [[metamorphic reaction]]s.

Oxidation of wüstite forms goethite-limonite.

Zinc, aluminium and other transition metals may substitute for Fe in wüstite.

Wüstite in [[dolomite]] [[skarn]]s may be related to [[siderite]] (Fe-carbonate), [[wollastonite]], [[enstatite]], [[diopside]] and [[magnesite]].

[[File:Zinc-air-battery-types.gif|thumb|right|Zinc–air hearing aid batteries]]

'''Zinc–air batteries''' (non-rechargeable; [[Battery nomenclature|IEC codes: A, P]]), and '''zinc–air [[fuel cell]]s''' (mechanically rechargeable) are [[metal-air electrochemical cell|metal-air]] [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] powered by [[oxidation|oxidizing]] [[zinc]] with [[oxygen]] from the air. These batteries have high [[energy density|energy densities]] and are relatively inexpensive to produce. Sizes range from very small [[button cell]]s for [[hearing aid]]s, larger batteries used in film [[camera]]s that previously used [[Mercury battery|mercury batteries]], to very large batteries used for [[electric vehicle]] propulsion.

During discharge, a mass of zinc particles forms a porous [[anode]], which is saturated with an [[electrolyte]]. Oxygen from the air reacts at the [[cathode]] and forms [[hydroxyl]] ions which migrate into the zinc paste and form [[zincate]] ({{chem|Zn(OH)|4|2-}}), releasing [[electron]]s to travel to the cathode. The zincate decays into [[zinc oxide]] and water returns to the electrolyte. The water and hydroxyl from the [[anode]] are recycled at the cathode, so the water is not consumed. The reactions produce a theoretical 1.65 [[volts]], but this is reduced to 1.35–1.4 V in available cells.

Zinc–air batteries have some properties of [[fuel cell]]s as well as batteries: the zinc is the fuel, the reaction rate can be controlled by varying the air flow, and oxidized zinc/electrolyte paste can be replaced with fresh paste.

Zinc-air batteries can be used to replace now discontinued 1.35 V [[mercury battery|mercury batteries]] (although with a significantly shorter operating life),  which in the 1970s through 1980s were commonly used in photo cameras.

Possible future applications of this battery include its deployment as an [[electric vehicle battery]] and as a utility-scale energy storage system.

== History ==

The effect of oxygen was known early in the 19th century when wet-cell [[Leclanche battery|Leclanche batteries]] absorbed atmospheric oxygen into the [[carbon]] cathode current collector. In 1878, a porous [[platinum|platinized]] carbon air electrode was found to work as well as the [[manganese dioxide]] ({{chem|MnO|2}}) of the Leclanche cell. Commercial products began to be made on this principle in 1932 when George W. Heise and Erwin A. Schumacher of the [[National Carbon Company]] built cells,&lt;ref&gt;
{{patent|US|1899615|Air-depolarized primary battery Heise – February, 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; treating the carbon electrodes with wax to prevent flooding. This type is still used for large zinc–air cells for navigation aids and [[rail transportation]]. However, the current capacity is low and the cells are bulky.

Large primary zinc–air cells such as the [[Thomas A. Edison]] Industries ''Carbonaire'' type were used for railway signaling, remote communication sites, and navigation buoys. These were long-duration, low-rate applications. Development in the 1970s of thin electrodes based on fuel-cell research allowed application to small button and prismatic primary cells for [[hearing aid]]s, [[pager]]s, and [[medical device]]s, especially cardiac [[telemetry]].&lt;ref name=linden2002&gt;David Linden, Thomas B. Reddy (ed). ''Handbook Of Batteries 3rd Edition'', McGraw-Hill, New York, 2002 {{ISBN|0-07-135978-8}}, chapter 13 and chapter 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The first rechargeable zinc air batteries were manufactured in 1996 by a Slovenian innovator Miro Zorič. They were developed to power vehicles using the first AC-based drive trains, also developed by Mr. Zorič. The first vehicles on roads to use zinc air batteries were small and mid-sized buses in Singapore, where Mr. Zorič led the national electrification program at Singapore Polytechnic, during his technology transfer post. The mass production assembly line for his zinc air batteries was put in place in 1997. The cells offered much higher energy density and specific energy (and weight) ratio, compared to then standard lead acid batteries

== Reaction formulas ==
[[File:Animation of zinc air cell 1100.gif|thumb|Animation of the operation of a zinc-air cell]]
The [[chemical equation]]s for the zinc–air cell are:&lt;ref name="duracell.com"/&gt;

:Anode: Zn + 4OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Zn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = －1.25 V)

:Fluid: Zn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → ZnO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

:Cathode: 1/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.34 V pH＝11)

:Overall: 2Zn + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2ZnO (E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.59 V)

Zinc–air batteries cannot be used in a sealed [[battery holder]] since some air must come in; the oxygen in 1 liter of air is required for every ampere-hour of capacity used.

== Storage density ==

Zinc-air batteries have higher energy density and specific energy (and weight) ratio than other types of battery because atmospheric air is one of the battery reactants. The air is not packaged with the battery, so that a cell can use more zinc in the anode than a cell that must also contain, for example, [[manganese dioxide]]. This increases capacity for a given weight or volume. As a specific example, a zinc–air battery of 11.6&amp;nbsp;mm diameter and height 5.4&amp;nbsp;mm from one manufacturer has a capacity of 620&amp;nbsp;mAh and weight 1.9&amp;nbsp;g; various silver oxide (SR44) and alkaline cells of the same size supply 150–200&amp;nbsp;mAh and weigh 2.3–2.4&amp;nbsp;g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.energizer.com/ |title=Energizer Technical Information |publisher=Data.energizer.com |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2013-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storage and operating life ==

Zinc-air cells have long shelf life if sealed to keep air out; even miniature button cells can be stored for up to 3 years at room temperature with little capacity loss if their seal is not removed. Industrial cells stored in a dry state have an indefinite storage life.

The operating life of a zinc–air cell is a critical function of its interaction with its environment. The electrolyte loses water more rapidly in conditions of high temperature and low humidity. Because the [[potassium hydroxide]] electrolyte is [[deliquescent]], in very humid conditions excess water accumulates in the cell, flooding the cathode and destroying its active properties. Potassium hydroxide also reacts with atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]]; carbonate formation eventually reduces electrolyte conductivity. Miniature cells have high [[self-discharge]] once opened to air; the cell's capacity is intended to be used within a few weeks.&lt;ref name=linden2002 /&gt;

== Discharge properties ==

Because the cathode does not change properties during discharge, terminal [[voltage]] is quite stable until the cell approaches exhaustion.

Power capacity is a function of several variables: cathode area, air availability, porosity, and the catalytic value of the cathode surface. Oxygen entry into the cell must be balanced against electrolyte water loss; cathode membranes are coated with ([[hydrophobic]]) [[Teflon]] material to limit water loss. Low humidity increases water loss; if enough water is lost the cell fails. Button cells have a limited current drain; for example an IEC PR44 cell has a capacity of 600 milliamp-hours ([[mAh]]) but a maximum current of only 22 milliamps (mA). Pulse load currents can be much higher since some oxygen remains in the cell between pulses.&lt;ref name=linden2002 /&gt;

Low temperature reduces primary cell capacity but the effect is small for low drains. A cell may deliver 80% of its capacity if discharged over 300 hours at {{convert|0|C}}, but only 20% of capacity if discharged at a 50-hour rate at that temperature. Lower temperature also reduces cell voltage.

== Cell types==

===Primary (non-rechargeable) ===
[[File:Zinc air cell 2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Cross section diagram with parts lettered|Cross section through a zinc–air button cell. A:Separator, B: zinc powder anode and electrolyte, C: anode can, D: insulator gasket, E: cathode can, F: air hole, G: cathode catalyst and current collector, H:air distribution layer, I: Semi permeable membrane]]

Large zinc–air batteries, with capacities up to 2,000 ampere–hours per cell, are used to power navigation instruments and marker lights, oceanographic experiments and railway signals.

Primary cells are made in button format to about 1 Ah. Prismatic shapes for portable devices are manufactured with capacities between 5 and 30 Ah. Hybrid cell cathodes include [[manganese dioxide]] to allow high peak currents.

Button cells are highly effective, but it is difficult to extend the same construction to larger sizes due to air diffusion performance, heat dissipation, and leakage problems. Prismatic and cylindrical cell designs address these problems. Stacking prismatic cells requires air channels in the battery and may require a fan to force air through the stack.&lt;ref name=linden2002 /&gt;

=== Secondary (rechargeable) ===

Rechargeable zinc–air cells require zinc precipitation from the water-based electrolyte to be closely controlled. Challenges include [[Dendrite (metal)|dendrite]] formation, non-uniform zinc dissolution and limited solubility in electrolytes. Electrically reversing the reaction at a bi-functional air cathode, to liberate oxygen from discharge reaction products, is difficult; membranes tested to date have low overall efficiency. Charging voltage is much higher than discharge voltage, producing cycle energy efficiency as low as 50%. Providing charge and discharge functions by separate uni-functional cathodes, increases cell size, weight and complexity.&lt;ref name=linden2002 /&gt; A satisfactory electrically recharged system potentially offers low material cost and high specific energy.  As of 2014, only one company has commercial units for sale, as described in a [[United States Department of Energy|Dept. of Energy]] produced video at the [http://www.arpae-summit.com/ ARPA-e Energy Innovation Summit] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/60446135&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fluidic Energy]] has apparently covered hundreds of thousands of outages in Asia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fluidicenergy.com|title=Fluidic Energy|author=|date=|website=www.fluidicenergy.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at distributed critical load sites.  And at least one firm claims to be in field tests for grid-scale backup applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/eos-puts-its-zinc-air-grid-batteries-to-test-with-coned |title=Eos Puts Its Zinc-Air Grid Batteries to the Test With ConEd |publisher=Greentech Media |date=2013-05-02 |accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanical recharge ===

Rechargeable systems may mechanically replace the anode and electrolyte, essentially operating as a refurbishable primary cell, or may use zinc powder or other methods to replenish the reactants. Mechanically recharged systems were investigated for military electronics uses in the 1960s because of the high energy density and easy recharging. However, primary [[lithium]] batteries offered higher discharge rates and easier handling.

Mechanical recharging systems have been researched for decades for use in electric vehicles. Some approaches use a large zinc–air battery to maintain charge on a high discharge–rate battery used for peak loads during acceleration. Zinc granules serve as the reactant. Vehicles recharge via exchanging used electrolyte and depleted zinc for fresh reactants at a service station.

The term zinc–air fuel cell usually refers to a zinc–air battery in which zinc metal is added and zinc oxide is removed continuously. Zinc electrolyte paste or pellets are pushed into a chamber, and waste zinc oxide is pumped into a waste tank or bladder inside the fuel tank. Fresh zinc paste or pellets are taken from the fuel tank. The zinc oxide waste is pumped out at a refueling station for recycling. Alternatively, this term may refer to an electrochemical system in which zinc is a co-reactant assisting the reformation of hydrocarbons at the anode of a fuel cell.

===Catalysts===
[[Cobalt oxide]]/[[carbon nanotube]] hybrid oxygen reduction catalyst and Nickel-iron layered double hydroxide oxygen evolution cathode catalysts exhibited higher catalytic activity and durability in concentrated alkaline electrolytes than precious metal [[Platinum]] and [[Iridium]] catalysts. The resulting primary zinc-air battery showed peak power density of ~265&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, current density of ~200 mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 V and energy density &gt;700 Wh/kg.&lt;ref name=nat&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = Y. | last2 = Gong | first2 = M. | last3 = Liang | first3 = Y. | last4 = Feng | first4 = J. | last5 = Kim | first5 = J.

Rechargeable Zn-air batteries in a tri-electrode configuration exhibited an unprecedented small charge–discharge voltage polarization of ~0.70 V at 20 mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, high reversibility and stability over long charge and discharge cycles.&lt;ref name=nat/&gt;&lt;ref name=swr/&gt;

In 2015, researchers announced a carbon-based, metal-free electrocatalyst that works efficiently in both reduction and oxygenation reactions. Organic compound [[aniline]], polymerized into long chains in a [[phytic acid]] solution, was freeze-dried into a stable, mesoporous carbon [[aerogel]] with 2-50&amp;nbsp;nm pores, providing high surface area and room for the battery electrolyte to diffuse. The researchers [[pyrolysis|pyrolized]] the aerogel to 1,000 degrees Celsius, turning the foam into a graphitic network, with many catalytic graphene edges. The aniline doped the foam with nitrogen, which enhances reduction. Phytic acid infuses the foam with phosphorus, helping oxygen evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Researchers create first metal-free catalyst for rechargeable zinc-air batteries |date= 2015-04-06 |first=Kevin |last=Mayhood |publisher=R&amp;D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foam has a surface area of ∼1,663 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/gr. Primary batteries demonstrated an open-circuit potential of 1.48 V, a specific capacity of 735 mAh/gr (Zn) (energy density of 835 Wh/kg (Zn)), a peak [[power density]] of 55&amp;nbsp;mW/cm³ and stable operation for 240 h after mechanical recharging.

== Applications==

=== Vehicle propulsion ===

Metallic zinc could be used as an alternative fuel for vehicles, either in a zinc–air battery&lt;ref&gt;J. Noring et al, ''Mechanically refuelable zinc–air electric vehicle cells'' in ''Proceedings of the Symposium on Batteries and Fuel Cells for Stationary and Electric Vehicle Applications Volumes 93–98 of Proceedings (Electrochemical Society)'', The Electrochemical Society, 1993 {{ISBN|1-56677-055-6}} pp. 235–236&lt;/ref&gt; or to generate hydrogen near the point of use. Zinc's characteristics have motivated considerable interest as an energy source for electric vehicles. Gulf General Atomic demonstrated a 20&amp;nbsp;kW vehicle battery. [[General Motors]] conducted tests in the 1970s. Neither project led to a commercial product.&lt;ref&gt;
C. A. C. Sequeira ''Environmental oriented electrochemistry'' Elsevier, 1994 {{ISBN|0-444-89456-X}}, pp. 216–217&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to liquid, [[Pelletizing|pellets]] could be formed that are small enough to pump. [[Fuel cells]] using pellets would be able to quickly replace zinc-oxide with fresh zinc metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llnl.gov/str/10.95.html |title=Science &amp; Technology Review |publisher=Llnl.gov |date=1995-10-16 |accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spent material can be recycled. The zinc–air cell is a [[primary cell]] (non-rechargeable); recycling is required to reclaim the zinc; much more energy is required to reclaim the zinc than is usable in a vehicle.&lt;!-- Need a reference for the "service charges" on this "energy currency" --&gt;

One advantage of utilizing zinc–air batteries for vehicle propulsion is that earth's supply of zinc metal is 100 times greater than that of [[lithium]], per unit of battery energy. Current yearly global zinc production is sufficient to produce enough zinc-air batteries to power over one billion electric vehicles, whereas current lithium production is only sufficient to produce ten million [[lithium-ion]] powered vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;William Tahil (December 2006). [http://www.evworld.com/library/lithium_shortage.pdf The Trouble with Lithium Implications of Future PHEV Production for Lithium Demand] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222074648/http://www.evworld.com/library/lithium_shortage.pdf |date=February 22, 2009 }}. Meridian International Research&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 35% of the world's supply, or 1.8 gigatons of zinc reserves are in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://machinedesign.com/article/zinc-air-fuel-cell-provides-more-benefits-than-lithium-ion-batteries-1007 Zinc air fuel cell provides more benefits than lithium ion batteries]. Machine Design (2010-10-07). Retrieved on 2012-09-30.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the U.S. holds only 0.38% of known [[Lithium#Terrestrial|lithium reserves]].

Initial rechargeable zinc air batteries, developed for use in vehicles, were used for buses in Singapore. Their developer, Miro Zorič, chose zinc air chemistry specifically due to zinc air battery production requiring only abundant raw materials without requiring rare earth materials. When used to power vehicular AC (induction) drive trains, this would allow global road transport electrification, without destabilizing global supply chains or cause adverse raw material bottlenecks.

===Grid storage===

The Eos Energy System battery is about half the size of a shipping container and provides 1 MWh of storage. [[Con Edison]], [[National Grid (Great Britain)|National Grid]], [[Enel]] and [[GDF SUEZ]] began testing the battery for grid storage. Con Edison and [[City University of New York]] are testing a zinc-based battery from Urban Electric Power as part of a New York State Energy Research and Development Authority program. Eos projects that the cost of storing electricity with such EOS batteries is US$160/kWh and that it will provide electricity cheaper than a new natural-gas peaking power station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eosenergystorage.com/technology-and-products/]&lt;/ref&gt; Other battery technologies range from $400 to about $1,000 a kilowatt-hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/business/energy-environment/battery-seen-as-way-to-cut-heat-related-power-losses.html|title=Battery Seen as Way to Cut Heat-Related Power Losses|first=Diane|last=Cardwell|date=16 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=18 April 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Pumping zinc slurry through the battery in one direction for charging and reversing for discharge. Capacity is limited only by the slurry reservoir size.
* Alternate electrode shapes (via gelling and binding agents)
* Humidity management
* Careful catalyst dispersal to improve oxygen reduction and production
* Modularizing components for repair without complete replacement

== Safety and environment ==

Zinc [[corrosion]] can produce potentially explosive hydrogen. Vent holes prevent pressure build-up within the cell. Manufacturers caution against hydrogen build-up in enclosed areas. A short-circuited cell gives relatively low current. Deep discharge below 0.5 V/cell may result in electrolyte leakage; little useful capacity exists below 0.9 V/cell.

Older designs used [[Amalgam (chemistry)|mercury amalgam]] amounting to about 1% of the weight of a button cell, to prevent zinc corrosion. Newer types have no added mercury. Zinc itself is relatively low in toxicity. Mercury-free designs require no special handling when discarded or recycled.&lt;ref name=linden2002 /&gt;

In United States waters, environmental regulations now require proper disposal of primary batteries removed from navigation aids. Formerly, discarded zinc–air primary batteries were dropped into the water around buoys, which allowed mercury to escape into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscg.mil/directives/ci/16000-16999/CI_16478_10.pdf U.S.C.G. Directive], retrieved 2010 Jan 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
