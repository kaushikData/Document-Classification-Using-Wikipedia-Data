''' AEA International Lawyers Network''', previously known as European Lawyers Association, is an international network of offices situated all over the world. The AEA covers all the 193 countries that are in the [[United Nations]] plus [[Taiwan]], [[Kosovo]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]

== Congress ==
All the Association members meet annually in a Congress. Until now, 10 International Congresses have been celebrated. The first International Congress was held in [[Madrid]] in September 2005. The second took place in [[Paris]] in 2006. The third was in Madrid in May 2008. The fourth was in May 2009 in [[Berlin]]. The fifth was in [[Rome]] in May 2010. The sixth was celebrated in [[Istanbul]] in June 2011. The seventh was in [[Saint Petersburg]] in May 2012. The eighth was in [[Mexico D.F.]] in May 2013. The ninth was in [[Amsterdam]] in October 2013. In the tenth Anniversary the AEA Congress was held in [[Athens]] on the 21 and 22 May 2014. The next Congress will be celebrated in [[Lisbon]] on 28 and 29 May 2015.

The celebration place is decided democratically during the previous Congress.  The countries who wish to hold a Congress, make a public exposition presenting their office using videos, photographs, and a specifics proposals about their Congress. Thereby, it becomes an exposition like if it was a candidacy to the Olympics Games. During the last vote celebrated in Athens in May 2014, Lisbon, Jerusalem, Prague, Rabat and Victoria Falls were presented as candidates. The finalists were Lisbon and Jerusalem, with Lisbon the eventual winner, so they will hold the 2015 Congress. The next voting for the 2016 Congress will take place in Lisbon in May 2015.

== Offices number ==
Nowadays, the AEA is formed by 2.435 offices. The country with most offices is the United States. The US is followed in numbers by Germany and France. In Spain, there is also a strong office presence and practically all the provinces are covered and working mandatorily with the AEA brand.

== Democratic organization ==
The AEA has a fully democratic structure. The president and the other members of the Directors Board will be chosen via member votes. The voting takes place annually at the Congress.
The president is the lawyer Pedro Beltrán. The Board of Directors is formed by six Vice-presidents and eight other members representing different geographic areas.

'''Anarcho-conservatism''' or '''conservative anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[ideology]] that combines [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[politics]] and [[Conservatism|conservative values]]. Anarcho-conservatism opposes the state and all government control, while supporting social conservative policies. Conservative anarchism opposes state coercion but does not necessarily object to a naturally occurring hierarchy in certain social situations, e.g. religious institutions. Finally, it advocates the abolition of the state and the wholesale replacement of state law by moral laws. Differently from [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]] and [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]], anarcho-conservatives don't oppose all authority, but in consonance with them, they do oppose the authority of the modern nation state, which they deem artificial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2001/07/daniel-mccarthy/anarcho-conservatism/|title=Anarcho-Conservatism - LewRockwell LewRockwell.com|work=LewRockwell.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, conservative anarchists might oppose abortion, drug use and pornography, on moral grounds, while at the same time opposing their prohibition through government. This absolute rejection of the state legislation is what differentiates anarcho-conservatism from [[Libertarian conservatism|libertarianism conservatism]]. As conservatives typically do, conservative anarchists support traditional family structures and, much like all [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] orientations, support gun and property rights. These however take a backseat to traditional and religious morality, if a conflict between them arises. In particular, this differentiates anarcho-conservatism from anarcho-capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=conservative%20anarchist|title=Urban Dictionary: conservative anarchist|website=Urban Dictionary|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-conservatism has much in common with [[paleolibertarianism]], except the the support of right wing populists in political elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://libertarianuniverse.com/2015/08/20/anarcho-conservatism-explained-by-vincent-john/|title=Anarcho-Conservatism Explained|date=2015-08-20|work=LibertarianUniverse: A Right-Libertarian Blog|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian anarchism]] is an instance of anarcho-conservatism.

== History ==

=== Old Testament ===
[[Jacques Ellul]], a French philosopher and Christian anarchist, notes that the final verse of the [[Book of Judges]] (Judges 21:25) states that there was no king in Israel and that "everyone did as they saw fit".&lt;ref&gt;

[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges%2021:25&amp;version=NIV BibleGateway.com - Passage Lookup: Judges 21:25]: "In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes."
&lt;/ref&gt;
Subsequently, as recorded in the first [[Books of Samuel|Book of Samuel]] (1 Samuel 8) the [[Israelites|people of Israel]] wanted a king "so as to be like other nations".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
God declared that the people had rejected him as their king. He warned that a human king would lead to [[militarism]], [[conscription]] and [[Tax#History|taxation]], and that their pleas for mercy from the king's demands would go unanswered. [[Samuel]] passed on God's warning to the Israelites but they still demanded a king, and [[Saul]] became their ruler.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Modern age ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Young England movement of the 1830s and ‘40s argued that the more feudal models of traditional aristocracy and land ownership within the framework of communities which are self-policing (i.e. each community is autonomous rather than imposed by the state) was the best path to liberty, rather than mainstream liberal models. In short, Tory anarchists might have defended traditional and hereditary institutions like monarchy and aristocracy, but they had anarchist sympathies in the sense that they did not believe in a centralised, unitary government, and sometimes saw a reactionary counterrevolution as the only path to political success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theburkean.co.uk/anarcho-conservatism-even-thing/|title=Anarcho-conservatism – Is that even a thing?|date=2017-10-01|work=The Burkean|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a Tory anarchist was first coined by Orwell to describe both Jonathan Swift and himself, and at its broadest it describes someone who is both a radical and a traditionalist. To be a Tory anarchist, then, is to embrace all manner of contradictions. It is a defence of good manners, good grammar, local customs and practices, respect for the individual and for privacy and an overwhelming hostility to the expanding power of the modern state. … Orwell saw Tory anarchism as a part of Britain's, mainly England's, rich social history, manifesting itself in particular figures at different times and places. These figures include not only Swift but Parson Bull, William Cobbett, Bishop Phillpotts and Richard Oastler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The strange case of Tory anarchism|last=1963-|first=Wilkin, Peter|date=2010|publisher=Libri Pub|isbn=9781907471100|location=Faringdon, Oxfordshire|oclc=662410383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There’s not a Tory anarchist tradition exactly, but the label has been applied, with good reason, to writers like Albert Jay Nock, Evelyn and Auberon Waugh, Mencken, Florence King, Dwight Macdonald, even Orwell and Max Beerbohm.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ordinary-times.com/2011/01/03/tory-anarchism-in-america-an-interview-with-daniel-mccarthy/|title=Tory Anarchism in America: An Interview with Daniel McCarthy - Ordinary Times|last=Kain|first=Erik|date=2011-01-03|work=Ordinary Times|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoppe generally describes himself as libertarian or anarcho-capitalist, but I cannot see that he would reject the ultra-conservative label, or I certainly do not see how can do so consistently, since he prefers monarchy to democracy. That is he prefers rule by one hereditary individual to rule by a representative assembly, or by direct democracy, and clearly regards the global move from monarchy to democracy as regrettable. His explanation is that a hereditary ruler has a great interest in maintaining the state since it belongs to that ruler and the descendants of that ruler in perpetuity. The hereditary ruler’s interest in maintaining the state is certainly greater than that of elected politicians, as these politicians are temporary and have a greater interest in extracting resources from the state than in maintaining it’s long term existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stephankinsella.com/2009/09/hoppe-habermas%E2%80%99s-anarcho-conservative-student/|title=Hoppe: Habermas’s Anarcho-Conservative Student|work=StephanKinsella.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
== Anarcho-conservative Quotes from Notable Authors ==

=== Albert Jay Nock (1870 – 1945) ===
[[Albert Jay Nock]] was the editor of ''[[The Freeman]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]''.&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone knows that the State claims and exercises the monopoly of crime that I spoke of a moment ago, and that it makes this monopoly as strict as it can. It forbids private murder, but itself organizes murder on a colossal scale. It punishes private theft, but itself lays unscrupulous hands on anything it wants, whether the property of citizen or alien. There is, for example, no human right, natural or Constitutional, that we have not seen nullified by the United States Government. Of all the crimes that are committed for gain or revenge, there is not one that we have not seen it commit — murder, mayhem, arson, robbery, fraud, criminal collusion and connivance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Sosy1SDXYNUC|title=On Doing the Right Thing|last=Nock|first=Albert Jay|date=1956|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|isbn=9781610163781|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== J.R.R. Tolkien (1892 – 1973) ===
[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] was [[Merton Professors|Professor of English Language and Literature]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], and the author of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.&lt;blockquote&gt;My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy (philosophically understood, meaning the abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs) — or to ‘unconstitutional’ Monarchy. I would arrest anybody who uses the word State (in any sense other than the inanimate real of England and its inhabitants, a thing that has neither power, rights nor mind); and after a chance of recantation, execute them if they remained obstinate! … Government is an abstract noun meaning the art and process of governing and it should be an offence to write it with a capital G or so to refer to people … The most improper job of any many, even saints (who at any rate were at least unwilling to take it on), is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity … There is only one bright spot and that is the growing habit of disgruntled men of dynamating factories and power-stations; I hope that, encouraged now as ‘patriotism’, may remain a habit! But it won’t do any good, if it is not universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9eLCAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Letters+of+J.R.R.+Tolkien|title=The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien|last=Tolkien|first=J. R. R.|date=2014-02-21|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=9780544363793|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Paul Weyrich (1942 – 2008) ===
[[Paul Weyrich]] was the co-founder of [[The Heritage Foundation]], [[The Free Congress Foundation]], and the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]].&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe that we probably have lost the culture war. That doesn’t mean the war is not going to continue, and that it isn’t going to be fought on other fronts. But in terms of society in general, we have lost. This is why, even when we win in politics, our victories fail to translate into the kind of policies we believe are important. Therefore, what seems to me a legitimate strategy for us to follow is to look at ways to separate ourselves from the institutions that have been captured by the ideology of Political Correctness, or by other enemies of our traditional culture. I would point out to you that the word "holy" means "set apart", and that it is not against our tradition to be, in fact, "set apart". You can look in the Old Testament, you can look at Christian history. You will see that there were times when those who had our beliefs were definitely in the minority and it was a band of hardy monks who preserved the culture while the surrounding society disintegrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000815232714/http://www.freecongress.org:80/fcf/specials/weyrichopenltr.htm|title=Free Congress Foundation Online ---|date=2000-08-15|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Hans-Hermann Hoppe (b. 1949) ===
[[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] is Professor Emeritus of Economics at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]], Senior Fellow of the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], and founder and president of the [[Property and Freedom Society]].&lt;blockquote&gt;Many libertarians hold the view that all that is needed to maintain a libertarian social order is the strict enforcement of the non-aggression principle (NAP). Otherwise, as long as one abstains from aggression, according to their view, the principle of “live and let live” should hold. Yet surely, while this “live and let live” sounds appealing to adolescents in rebellion against parental authority and all social convention and control (and many youngsters have been initially attracted to libertarianism believing that this “live and let live” is the essence of libertarianism), and while the principle does indeed hold and apply for people living far apart and dealing with each other only indirectly and from afar, it does ''not'' hold and apply, or rather it is ''insufficient'', when it comes to people living in close proximity to each other, as neighbors and cohabitants of the same community.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A simple example suffices to make the point. Assume a new next-door neighbor. This neighbor does not aggress against you or your property in any way, but he is a “bad” neighbor. He is littering on his own neighboring property, turning it into a garbage heap; in the open, for you to see, he engages in ritual animal slaughter, he turns his house into a “Freudenhaus,” a bordello, with clients coming and going all day and all night long; he never offers a helping hand and never keeps any promise that he has made; or he cannot or else he refuses to speak to you in your own language. Etc., etc.. Your life is turned into a nightmare. Yet you may not use violence against him, because he has not aggressed against you. What can you do? You can shun and ostracize him. But your neighbor does not care, and in any case you alone thus ‘punishing’ him makes little if any difference to him. You have to have the communal respect and authority, or you must turn to someone who does, to persuade and convince everyone or at least most of the members of your community to do likewise and make the bad neighbor a social outcast, so as to exert enough pressure on him to sell his property and leave. …&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The lesson? The peaceful cohabitation of neighbors and of people in regular direct contact with each other on some territory – a tranquil, convivial social order – requires also a commonality of culture: of language, religion, custom and convention. There can be peaceful co-existence of different cultures on distant, physically separated territories, but multi-culturalism, cultural heterogeneity, cannot exist in one and the same place and territory without leading to diminishing social trust, increased tension, and ultimately the call for a “strong man” and the destruction of anything resembling a libertarian social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://misesuk.org/2017/10/20/libertarianism-and-the-alt-right-hoppe-speech-2017/|title=Libertarianism and the Alt-Right (Hoppe Speech, 2017)|date=2017-10-19|work=The Ludwig von Mises Centre|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Daniel McCarthy ===
Daniel McCarthy is the editor of ''[[Modern Age (periodical)|Modern Age]],'' director of the Robert Novak Journalism Fellowship Program at [[The Fund for American Studies]], and former editor of ''[[The American Conservative]]'' (2010 – 2016).&lt;blockquote&gt;Conservatism and anarchism share some historical background, as reactions against liberalism, and they share some critiques of liberalism.&amp;nbsp; It’s not that liberalism — broadly construed to include the “classical” variety in practice as well as the modern version — is the worst socio-political system imaginable.&amp;nbsp; The various totalitarianisms of the 20th century were far worse, and anarchists and conservatives alike have to be careful that in making a deep critique of liberalism they’re not opening the door to something far deadlier. But liberalism is not the end of history, and it’s not the final picture of justice.&amp;nbsp;Under the guise of democracy and markets, and human rights, various kinds of powers and interests are able to run quite unchecked.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Alexander Salter ===
Alexander Salter is Assistant Professor of Economics in the [[Rawls College of Business]], and the Comparative Economics Research Fellow at [[Texas Tech University]]'s Free Market Institute.&lt;blockquote&gt;Embracing anarchy does not require conservatives to embrace violent revolution, or even civil disobedience. But for their own sake, as well as the sake of the civilization which they love, conservatives can and should deny the state’s legitimacy, on the grounds that it is destructive of the true, the good, and the beautiful. Affirming sovereignty in the hopes it may someday fall within conservative hands is a siren song that must be resisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2017/10/conservatism-seek-destroy-state-alexander-salter.html|title=Should Conservatism Seek to Destroy the State? ~ The Imaginative Conservative|date=2017-10-17|work=The Imaginative Conservative|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6170">An '''Anstalt''' or '''Anstalt partnership''' is a type of [[incorporation (business)|incorporated organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[FATF]] guidance: Transparency and Beneficial Ownership,(October 2014) [http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/Guidance-transparency-beneficial-ownership.pdf  page 14].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
An Anstalt is a hybrid between a [[Proprietary company|company limited by shares]] and a [[stiftung|foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://global-money.com/item.php?id=119 Going Offshore : Liechtenstein "ANSTALT" (Establishment) ].&lt;/ref&gt; An Anstalt is an entity, which has no members,&lt;ref&gt;In this  Anstalt are seen as in contrast to the more common corporate entity, [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung]], found in many [[German language|German-speaking]] countries.&lt;/ref&gt; participants or [[shareholder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pointonpartners.com.au/tax-residence-of-individuals-companies/  Tax Residence of Individuals &amp; Companies] April 07, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from a company in that it has no duty to return [[profit (accounting)|profit]] and differs from a [[Trust law|trust]] in that it has no obligation to a [[beneficiary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://global-money.com/item.php?id=119 Going Offshore : Liechtenstein "ANSTALT" (Establishment) ].&lt;/ref&gt; Anstalt do have, however, a holder of the founder’s rights. The founder can be either a [[Legal personality|legal person]] or a [[natural person]], need not be resident in the host country and Anstalt must have a minimum capital of CHF 30 000 (approximately USD 33 800).&lt;ref&gt;[https://star.worldbank.org/star/sites/star/files/liechtenstein_-_afar_bo_country_guide_final.pdf     An Investigator’S Guide To Company Ownership Information In Liechtenstein] ([[UNODC]]) p3.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also no need for the founder identity to be notified to the registration office.

These features, and the founders rights, and because an Anstalt can conduct many kinds of business, including non-trading activities (such as holding passive investments), has made them popular with foreign companies who use them as a [[holding company]] for overseas subsidiaries when trying to minimise tax in their home jurisdictions. That is Anstalt are a safe/easy place to park assets at tax time.

===Types===
There are two types of Anstalt; commercial and non-commercial, and they feature prominently in the finance system of [[Liechtenstein]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://star.worldbank.org/star/sites/star/files/liechtenstein_-_afar_bo_country_guide_final.pdf     An Investigator’S Guide To Company Ownership Information In Liechtenstein] (UNODC) p7.&lt;/ref&gt; where they are considered to be a [[Public Law]] Institution, though they are not able to be listed on the [[Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;Claus-Dieter Ehlermann, Michelle Everson, European Competition Law Annual 1999: Selected Issues in the Field of State Aids (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2001) [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=p9zbBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA368&amp;lpg=PA368&amp;dq=Anstalt+partnership+definition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b06Dk2wamL&amp;sig=X3LzQu4x9rL9jZgRz_cPsaWojAg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAiv3QpMrSAhUTtJQKHcIZB4U4ChDoAQgbMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Anstalt%20partnership%20definition&amp;f=false  p368].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences and uniqueness===
Anstalt differ from the related entities called [[stiftung]] in that Anstalt can conduct all kinds of business activities. Anstalt are seen as different to [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung]], a corporate type found in many [[German language|German-speaking]] countries, which do feature members and participants.

Anstalt are a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] creation and no direct [[common law]] analogue exists.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gordon TEP, [http://pointonpartners.com.au/international-inheritance-wealth-planning-issues/   International Inheritance &amp; Wealth Planning Issues] (May 07, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;[[Common law]] courts have tended to treat Anstalt that are “limited by shares”, as a company, and those without shares (the majority) are sometimes (though not always&lt;ref&gt;see ''[[ashburn anstalt v Arnold]]'' 1989 ch 1 ca.&lt;/ref&gt;) treated as a [[constructive trust]].&lt;ref&gt;see ''[[McGhee v National Coal Board]]'', [1972] 3 All E.R. 1008, 1 W.L.R. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name Anstalt means ''Institution" or "Establishment''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reverso.net/german-english/Anstalt  Anstalt translation | German-English dictionary].&lt;/ref&gt; which comes from the [[Middle High German]] Anstalt and means to set up'' [Public] purpose for a particular purpose and the building which houses it.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Anstalt&amp;prev=search   Institution, the  Word type: ℹ noun, feminine ] at Duden.de.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Basque Declaration''' (2016) is a formal document outlining 15 pathways for the development of more sustainable cities in Europe. The Declaration was acclaimed at the 8th European Conference on Sustainable Cities &amp; Towns from 27-29 April 2016 in [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. The document can be seen as a continuation of the [[Aalborg Charter|Aalborg Charter (1994)]] and the Aalborg Commitments (2004) echoing sustainability vision from Local [[Agenda 21|Agenda 21]], and is itself a call for active engagement from civil society..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablecities.eu/about-the-basque-declaration/|title=About the Basque Declaration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vision of the Declaration is 'to create productive, sustainable and resilient cities for a liveable and inclusive Europe'&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustainablecities.eu/fileadmin/repository/Basque_Declaration/BD_May_Update/Basque-Declaration-ENGLISH-www.pdf|title=The Basque Declaration (English)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Basque Declaration is targeted at city leaders in Europe, including mayors and city governments, and can also be signed by individuals. It outlines pathways to help city leaders shape the development of their own municipalities, and ultimately aims to accelerate socio-cultural, socio-economic and technological transformation. The Declaration is based on the understanding that a diversity of local initiatives are required to address social, environmental and economic challenges. It recognises the importance of things such as protecting biodiversity, decarbonising energy systems, creating more sustainable mobility systems, protecting water systems, adapting to climate change, promoting social inclusion and strengthening local economies, among other things.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although focusing on action at the local scale, the Declaration is underpinned by the idea of cooperation, sharing and replication of solutions adapted to the local context. A strong theme of the Declaration is to have a highly engaged civil society, where participation is a key ingredient in both developing and ''implementing'' local transformative actions.

The 15 pathways listed in the Basque Declaration are summarised under three headings:

&lt;u&gt;The Socio-Cultural Transformation&lt;/u&gt;
* To develop a 'culture of sustainability'
* To actively involve citizens, going beyond just participatory planning to co-creative approaches
* To re-think boundaries between public and private activities
* To promote social innovation, enterprises and civic engagement, focusing especially on marginalised groups and immigrants
* To nurture the [[sharing economy|sharing economy]] and ideas that combine entrepreneurship, civic engagement and societal transformation

&lt;u&gt;The Socio-Economic Transformation&lt;/u&gt;
* To turn challenges into opportunities for local economies in key areas such as energy and food production
* To create and close local value chains, increasing public income and local investment
* To apply innovative financing, including crowd-funding and blends of public funding or complementary currencies
* To purchase products and services conscientiously, taking into account the environmental, social and economic impacts of purchasing decisions
* To pursue development towards a circular economy, reducing the demand of natural resources and waste output

&lt;u&gt;The Technological Transformation&lt;/u&gt;
* To wisely take advantage of smart technologies
* To use public procurement as a way to accelerate innovation in the market
* To address the [[Digital divide|digital divide]] within local societies, focusing on equal access
* To support open data standards, keeping data available to the public
* The prepare political and governance structures to deal with these changes

==Transformative actions==

The Declaration supports local 'transformative actions' and encourages cities to develop and share their sustainability solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transformative Action Award|url=http://www.sustainablecities.eu/transformative-action-award/|website=Sustainable Cities EU|access-date=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.sustainablecities.eu/| Sustainable Cities EU] website has a central database where cities can submit their own 'transformative actions'. The idea is that local innovations can inspire other city leaders and where it is possible, help to facilitate replication of successful strategies. To encourage cities to report on their activities a 'Transformative Action Award' was created.

The '''battle of Cúl Dreimhne''' (also known as the ''Battle of the Book'') took place in the 6th century in the [[túath]] of [[Cairbre Drom Cliabh]] (now [[Co. Sligo]]) in northwest [[Ireland]]. The exact date for the battle varies from 555 AD to 561 AD. The battle is notable for being one of the earliest conflicts over [[History of copyright law|copyright]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Story: St Columba and modern copyright; battle in 6th Century Ireland | publisher = Open source | url = http://opensource.com/law/11/6/story-st-columba-modern-copyright-battle-sixth-century-ireland}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title =  First copyright case | publisher = Funeral | date = Mar 2005 | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | url = http://funferal.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/firstcopyrightcase.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to tradition, sometime around 560, the Irish abbot and missionary [[Columba|Saint Columba]] became involved in a quarrel with [[Finnian of Movilla|Saint Finnian]] of [[Movilla Abbey]] over a [[psalter]]. Columba copied the manuscript at the scriptorium under Saint Finnian, intending to keep the copy. Saint Finnian disputed his right to keep the copy. Thus, this dispute was about the ownership of the copy (whether it belonged to Saint Columba because he copied it or whether it belonged to Saint Finnian because he owned the original). King [[Diarmait mac Cerbaill]] gave the judgement, "To every cow belongs her calf, therefore to every book belongs its copy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Royal Irish Academy |title=The Cathach/The Psalter of St. Columba |url=http://www.ria.ie/Library/Special-Collections/Manuscripts/Cathach.aspx |work=Library Cathach |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702153948/http://www.ria.ie/Library/Special-Collections/Manuscripts/Cathach.aspx |archivedate=2014-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columba disagreed with King Diarmait's ruling against him and reportedly instigated a successful rebellion of the [[Uí Néill]] clan against the King. The battle was claimed to have caused around 3,000 casualties. It said the whole ordeal resulted in a guilt ridden Columba leave his homeland for Scotland, where he founded the [[Iona Abbey]] in 563 AD. In order to repent his misdeed he wanted to devote the rest of his life spreading the word of Christ.

The '''Brenton Butler case''' (officially '''''State of Florida v. Brenton Leonard Butler''''') was a murder case in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], Florida. During the investigation of a shooting death outside a motel in 2000, police arrested 15-year-old '''Brenton Butler''' and charged him with the murder.&lt;ref name="Pinkham"&gt;{{cite news|first= Paul|last= Pinkham|authorlink= |author2= |title= Butler case spotlights interrogations|url= http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/022301/met_5474236.html|work= [[The Florida Times-Union]]|publisher= |date= February 23, 2001|accessdate= July 7, 2009|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080207224458/http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/022301/met_5474236.html#|archive-date= February 7, 2008|dead-url= yes|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler subsequently confessed to the crime, and the case went to trial. However, during the trial he testified that he had been brutalized into his confession, and he was acquitted. The case gained significant notice in the media, and became the subject of an award-winning documentary, ''[[Murder on a Sunday Morning]]''.

==Case==
In May 2000, two tourists from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] were accosted outside the [[Ramada Inn]] on University Boulevard.&lt;ref name="Pinkham"/&gt; Mary Ann Stephens was shot in the head in front of her husband and the killer fled.&lt;ref name="Pinkham"/&gt; During the subsequent investigation, police picked up Butler, a 15-year-old student at [[Englewood High School (Jacksonville, Florida)|Englewood High School]] who was on his way to submit a job application to a local [[Blockbuster Video]].&lt;ref name="Pinkham"/&gt; Butler was brought to the victim's husband, who identified him as the killer.&lt;ref name="Pinkham"/&gt;

Police brought Butler in for questioning, and he confessed to the murder, both orally and in writing, in front of at least two detectives.&lt;ref name="Pinkham"/&gt; State Attorney [[Harry Shorstein]] decided to prosecute the case. During the trial, however, Butler testified that two detectives involved in the investigation, including Michael Glover, son of the then current Sheriff [[Nat Glover]], had intimidated and physically abused him into confessing.&lt;ref name="Pinkham"/&gt;

Butler was represented by Patrick McGuinness and Ann Finnell, two attorneys from the [[public defender]]s office. They supplied a photograph of Butler with bruises on his face, which they claimed was the result of the interrogation.&lt;ref name="Pinkham"/&gt; The jury deliberated for less than an hour before finding Butler not guilty; one juror later cited the testimony about the interrogation as one of the key factors in their decision.&lt;ref name="Pinkham"/&gt; State Attorney Shorstein and Jacksonville Sheriff Glover took the unusual steps of apologizing to Butler and re-opening the case of two unrelated suspects.&lt;ref name="Pinkham"/&gt; However, Michael Glover denied the allegations against him, and Shorstein said there was no evidence that Butler had been physically abused during the interrogation.&lt;ref name="Pinkham"/&gt;&lt;ref name=stpete /&gt;

==Legacy==
After the case, the State Attorney's Office launched a grand jury investigation into the conduct of the officers and prosecutors, while the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office began an internal affairs investigation.&lt;ref name="news4jax"&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|authorlink=|author2=|title=Brenton Butler Arrested For Misdemeanor|url=http://www.news4jax.com/news/2198045/detail.html|work=|publisher=news4jax.com|date=May 12, 2003|accessdate=July 7, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604072848/http://www.news4jax.com/news/2198045/detail.html|archivedate=June 4, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grand jury investigation criticized the prosecutor and police for their handling of the case but found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="stpete"&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author2= |title= Court strikes conviction in murder case|url= http://www.sptimes.com/2004/05/21/State/Court_strikes_convict.shtml|agency= Associated Press|work= St. Petersburg Times|publisher= |date= May 21, 2004|accessdate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police disciplinary board sought the suspension of three officers and other penalties for two more, but these measures were later largely overturned.&lt;ref name="news4jax"/&gt; Michael Glover retired from JSO and became a private investigator, while Dwayne Darnell was transferred from the homicide division.&lt;ref name=Pinkham /&gt;&lt;ref name=BOOK /&gt;

The Butler case opened up discussion about the video taping of police interrogations.&lt;ref name="Pinkham"/&gt; At the time of the investigation, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office was in discussions over implementing video recording during interrogations.&lt;ref name="Pinkham"/&gt; The office had purchased the equipment and was prepared to start taping interrogations, but held off at the request of the State Attorney's Office.&lt;ref name="Pinkham"/&gt; After the grand jury investigation, the Sheriff's office began taping interrogations of juvenile suspects, and implemented other procedural changes recommended by the jury.

The Butler case was the subject of the French documentary film ''[[Murder on a Sunday Morning]]'', which won the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary (Feature)|Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]] at the [[74th Academy Awards]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/262276/Murder-on-a-Sunday-Morning/details |title=Murder on a Sunday Morning |accessdate=2008-11-23|work=The New York Times: Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary follows Butler's defense team as they build their case for his innocence. In 2004, Butler wrote a book about his experience, entitled ''They Said It Was Murder''.&lt;ref name="BOOK"&gt;Schoettler, Jim (February 18, 2004). [http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/021804/met_14846526.shtml "Teen's book details ordeal of his arrest"]. ''[[The Florida Times-Union]]''. Retrieved July 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments==
After Butler's acquittal, his attorneys tipped the Sheriff's Office to two other suspects, Juan Curtis and Jermel Williams.&lt;ref name="stpete"/&gt; Williams pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and testified against his co-defendant at the trial; he was sentenced to ten years in prison.&lt;ref name="stpete"/&gt;&lt;ref name=news4jax2&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|authorlink=|author2=|title=Man Gets Two Life Sentences in Ga. Tourist Murder|url=http://www.news4jax.com/news/3872814/detail.html|work=|publisher=news4jax.com|date=October 29, 2004|accessdate=July 20, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050301085957/http://www.news4jax.com/news/3872814/detail.html|archivedate=March 1, 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis' fingerprints were found on the victim's purse, which had been recovered after the crime but had never been tested.&lt;ref name="stpete"/&gt; The Butler case figured into the new trial; the judge allowed Curtis' lawyers to discuss the eye-witness identification, but ruled that Florida's evidence laws forbade them from using Butler's confession.&lt;ref name="stpete"/&gt; Curtis was subsequently found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. However, in 2004 appeals court found that the exclusion of the confession denied Curtis' constitutional right to a fair trial, and granted a retrial.&lt;ref name="stpete"/&gt; At this second trial Curtis was found guilty and sentenced to two consecutive life terms.&lt;ref name=news4jax2/&gt;

==Lawsuit==
In late February 2001, lawyers for the Butler family announced that they were moving forward with a civil lawsuit seeking $2.5&amp;nbsp;million in damages against the City, the Sheriff's Department and individual officers involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news4jax.com/news/489523/detail.html "Butler Family Plans $2.5 Million Civil Lawsuit"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603184916/http://www.news4jax.com/news/489523/detail.html |date=June 3, 2009 }} (February 22, 2001). From news4jax.com. Retrieved July 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight months later, the lawsuit was refiled, seeking $8.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news4jax.com/news/489523/detail.html "Falsely Accused Teen Sues For $8.5 Million"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603184916/http://www.news4jax.com/news/489523/detail.html |date=June 3, 2009 }} (October 18, 2001).

According to their attorney, the family decided to settle for various reasons, including concerns about how long the case would drag on and the difficulty in proving the case under federal civil rights law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news4jax.com/news/1423424/detail.html "Butler Family Settles Lawsuit With City"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604073205/http://www.news4jax.com/news/1423424/detail.html |date=June 4, 2009 }} (April 29, 2002).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4544">From 2004-2014, the '''Cingranelli-Richards (CIRI) Human Rights Data Project''' annually rated the level of government respect for a variety of internationally recognized human rights. The final CIRI data set contains quantitative indicators of 15 human rights for 195 countries, annually from 1981-2011. The CIRI data were used in over 170 countries by scholars, students, policymakers, and analysts representing over 400 organizations. CIRI's founders and co-directors were political scientists Dr. [[David Cingranelli]] at [[Binghamton University]], SUNY &lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.binghamton.edu/political-science/faculty/david-cingranelli.html David L.

CIRI's data, documentation, and blog posts were archived at [http://www.humanrightsdata.com www.humanrightsdata.com].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrightsdata.com CIRI Human Rights Data Project], website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accessing the data==

The CIRI data were free for not-for-profit users. Once registered, CIRI users could create customized datsets, choosing only the indicators, countries, and years they needed; or, they could download the entire data set. As of December 2007, CIRI began using its own numeric country identifier code, but continued to offer others for the purpose of data merging. The MyCIRI feature allowed users to store their datasets on the CIRI server and easily update them when the master CIRI data was updated.

==Financial support==

Financial support for the CIRI Data Project came from the United States' [[National Science Foundation]];&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation Grant Nos. SBR-9730130 (1997-1998), SES-0318273 (2004-2006), SES-0647969 (2007-2010), and SES-0647916 (2007-2010).&lt;/ref&gt; [[The World Bank]]; [[GTZ]]; [[Binghamton University]], SUNY; the Center on Democratic Performance at Binghamton University, SUNY; The Human Rights Institute and College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences at [[The University of Connecticut]].

==CIRI human rights indicators==

The CIRI database coded only human rights PRACTICES of governments. The human rights for which government levels of respect were annually rated by CIRI included:

* Assembly &amp; Association
* Disappearance
* Domestic Movement
* Electoral Self-Determination (formerly Political Participation &amp; Free and Fair Elections)
* Empowerment Rights Index (An additive index summarizing government respect for electoral self-determination, domestic movement, foreign movement, religion, speech, assembly &amp; association, and workers' rights)
* Extrajudicial Killing
* Foreign Movement
* Independence of the Judiciary
* Physical Integrity Rights Index (An additive index summarizing government respect for disappearance, extrajudicial killing, political imprisonment, and torture)
* Political Imprisonment
* Religion
* Speech
* Torture
* Women's Economic Rights
* Women's Political Rights
* Women's Social Rights
* Workers' Rights

Most of the CIRI indicators were ratings (as opposed to rankings) on a scale of 0-2 for their respect of human rights, as follows:

*0= Frequent violations of this right
*1= Some violations of this right
*2= No reported violations of this right

The CIRI database used the annual country reports from the US State Department and Amnesty International as its primary sources.

Cain Brothers was founded in 1982 by Jim and Dan Cain based on the belief that [[Health care in the United States|health care organizations in the United States]] have unique needs that can be best addressed by professionals with knowledge of the health care delivery system as a whole.  As a result, the firm’s clients are composed of nonprofit, publicly traded, and privately held health care service providers, such as hospitals, [[ambulatory care]] centers, and physician groups; third-party payors like the [[BlueCross BlueShield|Blue Cross Blue Shield companies]]; [[Medical technology| medical technology companies]]; and companies that provide services to the health care industry such as [[information technology]] and [[real estate]] companies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4656">The '''Commission for Taxi Regulation''' (also '''An Coimisiún Um Rialáil Tacsaithe''' and '''Taxi Regulator''') was a public body in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] that existed between 2004 and 2011 regulating small public service vehicles (SPSVs) - the generic term for [[taxicabs|taxis]], wheelchair accessible taxis, hackneys and limousines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxiregulator.ie/ Taxi Regulator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309133844/http://www.taxiregulator.ie/ |date=2009-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxis and wheelchair-accessible taxis are allowed to pick up passengers in the street or at a stand and have their fares calculated by a meter; hackneys and limousines do not use meters and are not permitted to pick up passengers in the street or at a stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxiregulator.ie/consumer/what-is-a-SPSV/SPSV-categories.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005075859/http://www.taxiregulator.ie/consumer/what-is-a-SPSV/SPSV-categories.html |archivedate=2009-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkish constitution was ratified in [[Turkish Constitution of 1921|1921]], revised in [[Turkish Constitution of 1924|1924]], [[Turkish Constitution of 1961|1961]], [[Turkish Constitution of 1982|1982]], and most recently in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://global.tbmm.gov.tr/docs/constitution_en.pdf|title=Constitution Of The Republic Of Turkey|last=The Grand National Assembly of Turkey|first=|date=2016-07-15|website=Constitution Of The Republic Of Turkey|publisher=The Grand National Assembly of Turkey|at=Chapter Three, Section I, Article 41, Para 3-4|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposal for yet another constitution is being discussed, to allow Turkey to comply with [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|EU accession]] political criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnnturk.com/Turkiye/anayasa.asp |title=Draft proposal |accessdate=2008-01-01 |year=2007|language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Yavuz |first=Ercan |publisher=Zaman |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=130544 |title=New constitution to dominate 2008 |date=2008-01-01 |accessdate=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Insolvency}}
A '''cram down''' or '''cramdown''' is the involuntary imposition by a court of a reorganization plan over the objection of some classes of creditors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/invest/glossary/bfglosc.htm#cramdown Definition at Bloomberg Financial Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home mortgage loans==

While typically used in a corporate context, the phrase has gained popularity in the context of personal bankruptcies as a result of the [[financial crisis of 2007-2009]].{{cn|date=June 2018}} 

Under current [[Federal government of the United States|United States]] law, bankruptcy courts are not allowed to perform cramdowns (i.e., reduce the principal amount or change the [[interest rate]] or other terms) on creditors who hold loans secured by [[mortgage loan|mortgage]]s on debtors' primary residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|11|1123|b|5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|11|1322|b|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

U.S. bankruptcy law provides for an automatic stay of any legal process against debtors or their assets (except perhaps legal process involving criminal law or family law) while bankruptcy is pending, but because U.S. bankruptcy courts cannot cram down loans secured by primary residences, creditors are able to file motions for relief from the stay.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4728933057984532667 Grella v. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank]'', 42 F.3d 26 (1st Cir. 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  Once relief is granted, creditors may proceed with [[foreclosure]] ''immediately'' while debtors' other financial obligations await restructuring by the bankruptcy court.  Debtors may eventually obtain discharges of their other debts, but by then, they may already have lost their homes.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

===Historical context===

The prohibition on cramdowns on loans secured by primary residences was the result of a political compromise during the process of enacting the [[Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978]].  At the time, Congress was confronted with brutal [[stagflation]] in which economic stagnation was combined with sky-high inflation and interest rates, which were severely frustrating the United States' long-term federal public policy of promoting homeownership (which goes back to the [[National Housing Act of 1934]]).  Congress therefore decided to shield lenders on loans secured by primary residences from cramdowns because there was evidence that they perform "a valuable social service" through their loans.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2581289418078603137 In re Seidel]'', 752 F.2d 1382, 1386 (9th Cir. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;  

Generally, under [[risk-based pricing]], a rational lender will underwrite a loan with an interest rate that correlates directly to the borrower's [[credit risk]].  That is the risk that the lender cannot recover its entire expected [[return on investment]], which in turn includes not only the [[probability of default]], but also any external forces (like a bankruptcy court) that could delay repayment or force the lender to write off any part of the loan.  The higher the risk, the higher the interest rate.  Thus, Congress reasoned, if lenders knew their loans were protected from cramdowns, then they would offer loans at lower interest rates, which in turn would mean lower monthly payments, and thereby enable more Americans to afford homes.  In plain English, Congress sacrificed the interests of the minority of borrower-homeowners who default on their loans for the sake of lowering the cost of homeownership for the majority of borrower-homeowners who successfully repay their loans.  

This rule was fiercely litigated in the 1980s, but the prohibitions on cramdowns on primary residences in both Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings were eventually upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;''Nobelman v. Am. Sav. Bank'', 508 U.S. 324, 326 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dewsnup v. Timm'', 502 U.S. 410, 418-419 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;  Finding no relief in Chapters 7 or 13, some individual borrowers tried the creative move of filing under Chapter 11 (which is normally used by corporations).  As a result, the home lending industry went back to Congress, which responded by extending the cramdown restriction for loans secured by primary residences to Chapter 11 with the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13473762298834860380 In re Weinstein]'', 227 B.R. 284, 290 n.4 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary issues===

As a potential solution to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], legislators and consumer advocates have advanced a proposal to allow cram downs on these loans, and legislation to that effect was introduced for potential inclusion in the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Siegel Bernard|first = Tara|title = A Bill Encouraging to Distressed Homeowners, but Its Reach Is Unclear|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|date = September 28, 2008|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/business/yourmoney/29consumer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the financial industry strongly voiced opposition to such a measure, claiming that it would create additional uncertainty as to the value of mortgage loans (and by extension, the [[collateralized debt obligation]]s into which they are bundled).  In addition, like in the late 1970s, the financial industry had powerful political leverage on its side: the risk that revoking the cramdown restriction would result in higher interest rates on home loans.  It was impossible to simultaneously enact a law preventing the industry from jacking up interest rates on all home loans; that would have raised the possibility of [[bank run]]s, because few investors would keep their money at an institution that is legally prohibited from setting interest rates on its loans to accurately reflect the underlying credit risk.  To prevent bank runs, Congress could have simultaneously imposed capital transfer restrictions, but that would have paralyzed the global economy.  As few politicians wanted to be blamed by Wall Street for making homes unaffordable or causing even more bank failures or a second Great Depression, the proposals for revoking the prevention of cramdowns on loans secured by primary residences never found much traction in Congress.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Early use of term==

The term "cram down" in the reorganization context appears in case law as early as 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/1944322143F2d179_1260/NEW%20ENGLAND%20COAL%20&amp;%20COKE%20CO.%20v.%20RUTLAND%20R.%20CO. New Eng. Coal &amp; Coke Co. v. Rutland R. Co.], 143 F.2d 179 (1944).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informal use==

The term (sometimes used in the phrase '''cram-down deal''') has also gained currency to denote informally any transaction where existing investors ([[debt]] or [[Stock|equity]]) are forced by circumstance to accept an unappealing transaction, such as an expensive financing, a debt transaction that subordinates them, a dilutive equity raising, or an acquisition at an unappealingly low price.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/invest/glossary/bfglosc.htm#cram-down%20deal Definition at Bloomberg Financial Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Stracher|first = Cameron|title = The Year in Ideas: A to Z; The Cram-Down|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|date = December 9, 2001|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E4DF143CF93AA35751C1A9679C8B63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edinburgh mercat cross.jpg|thumb|250px| The Act of Pardon and Grace was proclaimed at the [[Mercat Cross, Edinburgh|Mercat Cross]] on [[Edinburgh]]'s [[Royal Mile]].]]
'''Cromwell's Act of Grace''' or  more formally the '''Act of Pardon and Grace to the People of Scotland''',&lt;ref&gt;Also known as '''Cromwell's Act of Grace and Pardon''' and the '''Ordinance of Pardon and Grace to the People of Scotland'''&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[List of Ordinances and Acts of the Parliament of England, 1642–1660|Act of the Parliament of England]] that declared that the people of Scotland (with certain exceptions) were pardoned for any crimes they might have committed during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. It was proclaimed at the [[Mercat Cross, Edinburgh|Mercat Cross]] in [[Edinburgh]] on 5{{nbsp}}May 1654. General [[George Monck]], the English Military Governor of Scotland, was present in Edinburgh, having arrived the day before for two proclamations also delivered at the Mercat Cross, the first declaring [[Oliver Cromwell]] to be the [[Lord Protector|Protector of England, Ireland and Scotland]], and that [[Tender of Union#Approval by the Lord Protector and Parliament|Scotland was united with the Commonwealth of England]].

==Origins==
After the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms#Third Civil War|English invasion of 1650]], and the defeat of the Scottish armies at the battles of [[Battle of Dunbar (1650)|Dunbar]], [[Battle of Inverkeithing|Inverkeithing]] and [[Battle of Worcester|Worcester]], Scotland was placed under English military occupation with General Monck as military governor of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=18939|title=Monck , George, first duke of Albemarle (1608–1670)|first=Ronald|last=Hutton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to the date of the Act of Grace the English army had been able to suppress the Scottish resistance to the occupation with relative ease and the occupation, with sporadic but ineffective resistance, would continue throughout the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] up until the [[Restoration (Scotland)|Restoration]] in 1660.

The Act had its origins in the English written constitution of December 1653, called the [[Instrument of Government]]. Between December 1653 and the calling of the [[First Protectorate Parliament]] that sat for the first time in September 1654, the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell and his [[Council of State (England)|Council of State]] were granted under the Instrument of Government the power "to make laws and ordinances for the peace and welfare of these nations where it shall be necessary" and on 12 April 1654 the regime passed a number of ordinances pertaining to the government of Scotland:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olivercromwell.org/scotland_union.pdf|title=The 1654 Union with Scotland |publisher=[http://www.olivercromwell.org www.olivercromwell.org] maintained by the Cromwell Association and the Cromwell Museum Huntingdon |accessdate=24 January 2011| pages=[http://www.olivercromwell.org/scotland_union.pdf 2,3]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ordinance for uniting Scotland into one Commonwealth with England,
* Ordinance of Pardon and Grace to the People of Scotland,
* Ordinance for erecting Courts Baron in Scotland,
* Ordinance for settling the Estates of several excepted Persons in Scotland, in Trustees, to the Uses herein expressed.

==Contents==
The content of the Act of Grace contained:{{sfn|Firth|Rait|1911}}
*A general pardon and act of oblivion,
*Except for members of the royal family (their estates were confiscated),
*Other excepted who had their estates confiscated,
*Other excepted and fined,
*Other exceptions and provisions.

===General pardon===
The first and second paragraphs drew a line under [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. Oliver Cromwell the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, and the Dominions of those nations, ordained that on 1 May 1654, with the exceptions laid out in paragraphs that followed "in this Ordinance", that the People of Scotland were pardoned for any crimes they might have committed during the preceding wars and that there would be no further financial or other punishments.{{sfn|Firth|Rait|1911}}

The rest of the ordinance proceeded to list the various exceptions to the general pardon and clarification of some of the details.{{sfn|Firth|Rait|1911}}

===Except members of the royal family===
The third paragraph excepted royal estates and other possessions in Scotland  and so allowed for the sequestration by the Commonwealth . The wording  also covered royal possessions that might have been passed to others since 1 May 1642.{{sfn|Firth|Rait|1911}}

===Except those who had their estates confiscated===
The fourth paragraph listed twenty four men whose estates were excepted and forfeited to the Commonwealth (See [[#Appendix A|Appendix A]]), and like the Royal estates this was backdated to cover the estates as they were on 18 April 1648. Also, almost as a post script to the paragraph, a twenty fifth man, [[James Douglas, 1st Lord Mordington|James, 1st Lord Mordington]], had his estates of "Maudlain Field, Sunck, Cony-garth, Constables-Batt, Two Watermills, and a Wind-mill lying within Barwick bounds." confiscated.{{sfn|Firth|Rait|1911}}

The next paragraph arranged for the confiscation of the estates of certain categories of Scots who had opposed the English Parliament since 1648 and were still under arms against the  English Commonwealth after 3 September 1650 or were not now considered by Oliver Cromwell to be reconciled to the new regime. Those who could be excluded by this paragraph were Scottish MPs who had not signed the Protestation against the invasion of England in 1648,  those men who sat in the Scottish Parliament or were a member of the Committee of Estates of Scotland after the coronation Charles II (in 1651), or were in the Scottish army after the [[Battle of Dunbar (1650)|Battle of Dunbar]] on 3 September 1650 (which included all those who had taken part in the [[Worcester Campaign]]).{{sfn|Firth|Rait|1911}}

The following paragraph limited the time creditors had to put in claims against the forfeited estates. Claims had to be lodged with named representatives,&lt;ref&gt;John Swinton of Swinton, Esq; William Lawrence, Esq; George Smith, Esq; Sir James MacDowel of Garthland, Samuel Disbrow, John Thompson, Esquires {{harv|Firth|Rait|1911}}.&lt;/ref&gt; within 60 days of the proclamation of the ordinance.{{sfn|Firth|Rait|1911}}

The next three paragraphs granted certain lands to the named wives and children of those who's estates had been confiscated, under the condition that they pay rent to the Protector for those lands and that they renounced any claims they had to other properties which previously belonged to those excluded from the general pardon.{{sfn|Firth|Rait|1911}}

===Except those who were fined===

Seventy three men were fined (see [[#Appendix B|Appendix B]]).&lt;ref&gt;There are 72 entries in the list because one fine for the sum of £5,000 was levied jointly on two men: the Earl of Perth, and Lord Drumond his eldest son.&lt;/ref&gt; The ordinance included details of how the fines were to be paid and what was to happen if the fine was not paid.  The money was to be paid to Gilbert [George] Bilton, deputy treasurer at Leith. Half was to be paid on, or by, 2 August 1654 and the other half on, or by, 2 December 1654. If a person defaulted on payment then their estate were to be confiscated by the commissioners for sequestration.{{sfn|Laing|1836|p=126}}

===Other exceptions and provisions===

The last few paragraphs of the Ordinance laid on certain points so that it was clear that this Ordinance could not be used to frustrate some other points of law that the drafters of the ordinance saw as potential legal problems.{{sfn|Firth|Rait|1911}}

The Ordinance could not be read as restoring or reviving of any lordship, dominion, jurisdiction, tenure, superiority, or any thing whatsoever, abolished by [[An Ordinance for Uniting Scotland into one Commonwealth with England]].{{sfn|Firth|Rait|1911}}

The general pardon did not extend to those persons in arms since 1 May 1652 who would remain  subject to the [[Articles of War]].  The general pardon could not be construed to extend, to the freeing or discharging of any prisoners or prisoners of war, from their respective imprisonments or their promises and surety for release from that imprisonment.{{sfn|Firth|Rait|1911}}

The final paragraph negated any reading of the ordinance that might be construed to reduce the revenues that formally went to the Crown and should not go to the Lord Protector.{{sfn|Firth|Rait|1911}}

==Passed by Parliament and consented to by the Lord Protector==

Although the ordinance had been issued on 12 April 1654, and then proclaimed in Scotland on 5 May 1654, like the other ordinances pertaining to Scotland issued on 12 April 1654, it did not become enacted until an enabling act, called "Act touching several Acts and Ordinances made since the twentieth of April, 1653, and before the third of September, 1654, and other Acts" was consented to by the Lord Protector on the  26 June 1657,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=House of Commons Journal, 26 June 1657|title=Journal of the House of Commons: 1651–1660 |volume=7 |year=1802|pages=575–578|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=24670|accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same day that the enabling bill was approved by the [[Second Protectorate Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sevaldsen |first=Jørgen |year=2007 |title=Angles on the English-Speaking World, V.7: The State of the Union: Scotland, 1707–2007|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press|isbn=978-87-635-0702-8 |page=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WletMznpNO4C&amp;pg=PA39 39]|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |editor-first=C.H. |editor-last=Firth |editor2-first=R.S. |editor2-last=Rait|year=1911 |chapter=June 1657: An Act touching several Acts and Ordinances made since the twentieth of April, 1653, and before the third of September, 1654, and other Acts |title=Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642–1660 (1911) |pages=1131–1142 |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56611}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9644">The '''Declaration recognising the Right to a Flag of States having no Sea-coast''' ({{lang-fr|Déclaration portant reconnaissance du droit au pavillon des Etats dépourvus de littoral}}) is a 1921 [[multilateral treaty]] which legally recognised that a [[land-locked country|land-locked state]] could be a maritime [[flag state]]; that is, that a land-locked state could [[Ship registration|register ships]] and sail them on the sea under its [[maritime flag|own flag]].

As of 2013, the Declaration has been ratified by over 50 states, and [[international law]] recognises the right of any state to sail ships on the sea under its own flag. Today, land-locked states which have merchant vessel fleets include [[Austria]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Bolivia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Hungary]], [[Laos]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Mongolia]], [[Moldova]], [[Paraguay]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Switzerland]].

==Background==
In the first two decades of the 20th century, there had been uncertainty as to whether a land-locked state could register maritime ships and authorise them to sail under its flag: the [[Republic of France]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] had argued that such a right could not exist because it would place a land-locked state in the position of being unable to control the behavior of ships of bearing its flag because of the state's inability to unreservedly access ports and the sea. Prior to [[World War I]], [[Switzerland]] had denied several requests from merchant ships to fly the Swiss flag.

==Creation, ratification, and effect==
After [[World War I]], the creation of several new landlocked states, such as [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Austria]], and [[Hungary]], caused the Great Powers to reconsider the issue. The [[Treaty of Versailles]] had included provisions by which [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] agreed to allow these landlocked states to transit goods and personnel across German territory freely to seaports, which suggested that such states may also have their own merchant vessels in such ports.

The Declaration was created to reflect the new consensus and was concluded and signed on 20 April 1921 by 25 states in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], at the [[League of Nations]] Conference on Communications and Transit, as an addendum to the longer [[Barcelona Convention and Statute on the Regime of Navigable Waterways of International Concern]], which was concluded on the same day. The Declaration entered into force on 8 October 1921.

==Text==
The text of the Declaration states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The undersigned, duly authorised for the purpose, declare that the States which they represent recognise the flag flown by the vessels of any State having no sea-coast which are registered at some one specified place situated in its territory; such place shall serve as the port of registry of such vessels.&lt;br&gt;
Barcelona, April the 20th, 1921, done in a single copy of which the English and French texts shall be authentic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''''Dongan Charter''''' is the 1686 document [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporating]] [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[New York (state)|New York]] as a [[City (New York)|city]]. Albany's charter was issued by [[Governor of New York|Governor]] [[Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick|Thomas Dongan]] of the [[Province of New York]], a few months after Governor Dongan issued a similarly worded, but less detailed [[charter]] for the [[New York City|city of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | issue = 3 | title = Municipal Corporations in the Colonies | author = John Archibald Fairlie |date=September 1898 | publisher = Reform Club, Committee on Municipal Administration  | journal = Municipal Affairs | volume = II | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fHlaAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA346&amp;dq=albany+dongan+charter&amp;lr=&amp;cd=20#v=onepage&amp;q=albany%20dongan%20charter&amp;f=false | pages = 846–847 | accessdate = 2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Albany was created three years after [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Annals of Albany | author = Joel Munsell | page = 191 | accessdate = 2009-05-24 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nc0pAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA321&amp;dq=annals+of+albany | year = 1869}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charter is the oldest existing city charter still in force in the United States and "arguably in all the [[Western Hemisphere]]", according to Stefan Bielinski, former senior historian of the [[New York State Museum]].&lt;ref name=fitzpatrick/&gt; In 1936 the United States Congress commemorated the charter's 250th anniversary by minting a half dollar coin.&lt;ref name=Coin/&gt;

==History==
After the city of New York received a municipal charter from Governor Dongan the governor came to Albany, at which time the village sent a delegation of prominent men to request a charter of their own. The [[Patroon]], after being encouraged by the governor, finally released all claims to Albany and forfeited a strip of land {{convert|1|mi|km}} wide and {{convert|16|mi|km}} long to Albany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Cuyler Reynolds | title = Albany Chronicles | accessdate = 2009-05-24 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XNU0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=castle+island+french+fort+1540&amp;lr=#PPR4,M1 | pages = 84–85 | year = 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albany at the time consisted of about 500 residents living in around 140 houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The First Hundred Years (1686-1786): In the Beginning | page = T1 | accessdate = 2010-05-30 | publisher = Albany Times Union | date = July 6, 1986 | author = Judy Shepard | url = http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=5445683 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1686 a delegation led by [[Pieter Schuyler]] and [[Robert Livingston the Elder|Robert Livingston]] traveled to New York to receive the charter for Albany;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iNIUAAAAYAAJ |title=Genealogical and Family History of Southern New York and the Hudson River Valley : A Record of the Achievements of Her People in the Making of a Commonwealth and the Building of a Nation |first=Cuyler |last=Reynolds |volume=3 |publisher=Lewis Historical Publishing Company |location=New York, NY |page=1306 |year=1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; the charter was signed on July 25, 1686 and was read aloud to the citizens of Albany three days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dongan Charter Born Out of Trading Rights Tiff | author = Bruce A.

During [[Leisler's Rebellion]] [[Jacob Leisler]] demanded the charters of Albany and the city of New York be forfeited, and New York yielded but Albany's mayor, Pieter Schuyler, refused.

==Provisions==
[[File:Albany Dongan Charter partially unfolded.png|thumb|The original Dongan Charter&lt;br/&gt;partially unfolded]]
The charter turned the [[Village (New York)|village]] of Albany into a city under the name of "The Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty of the city of Albany";&lt;ref name=Thacher/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bi&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=80gWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA431&amp;dq=dongan+charter+albany&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | pages = 431–454 | title = Albany Bi-centennial | author = A. Bleeker Banks | year = 1888 | publisher = Banks and Brothers | accessdate = 2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This legally separated it from [[Rensselaerswyck]], a nearby colonial estate. The charter also established Albany's boundaries and a municipal government, as well as specifically naming the first officers. Certain special rights were put into the charter as well, such as the exclusive right to negotiate with the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. It also established Albany as the sole market town in the [[Capital District, New York|upper Hudson region]], with the right to purchase land at [[Fort Hunter, New York|Tionnderoge]] and [[Schaghticoke, New York|Schaghticoke]].&lt;ref name=Charter&gt;{{cite web | title = Dongan Charter | publisher = New York State Museum | accessdate = 2009-12-09 | url = http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/albany/charter.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mayor of Albany was the executive officer and selected by the Lieutenant Governor. He was also designated as the clerk of the marketplace and the coroner for both the city and Albany County. Two alderman and two assistant aldermen were chosen from each ward and sat on the Common Council along with the mayor and recorder. The mayor, recorder, and aldermen were also justices, the assistants however did not have any judicial powers.&lt;ref name=Thacher/&gt;

The sole right to issue trading privileges anywhere in Albany County rested with the mayor and Common Council. Albany County encompassed all of Upstate New York north and west of [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]] at that time, as well as the state of [[Vermont]].&lt;ref name=Thacher/&gt; All residents of New York, except those of Albany, were specifically banned from trading with any [[Iroquois]] nation, or with any other native tribe to the west, east, or north of the city of Albany, or with native tribes anywhere within Albany County.&lt;ref name=Bi/&gt;

==Amendments==
The Dongan Charter was first amended on March 21, 1787 to remove the mayor's powers to act as the city and county's sole coroner, and to regulate trade with Indians. It continued to be used with only minor changes until March 16, 1870,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Albany bi-centennial: Historical memoirs |first1=Anthony Bleecker |last1=Banks |first2=Franklin Martin |last2=Danaher |first3=Andrew |last3=Hamilton |page=363 |year=1888 |publisher=Charles Van Benthuysen &amp;amp; Sons |location=Albany, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Two Centuries Growth of American Law 1701-1901: Volume 1 | author = Faculty of Yale Law School | publisher = Yale Law School | year = 1901 | pages = 217–218 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=skt5x_Lg1uwC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=albany+dongan+charter&amp;lr=&amp;cd=13#v=onepage&amp;q=albany%20dongan%20charter&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it saw major changes by the state legislature in 1870 and 1883.&lt;ref name=Thacher/&gt; In the 1870 revision, the city's official name was changed from "The Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty of the city of Albany" to the "City of Albany".&lt;ref name=Thacher/&gt; In 1998, the charter was almost completely rewritten after a municipal referendum.

'''Dropping the writ''' is the informal term for a procedure in some [[parliament]]ary [[form of government|government systems]], where the [[head of government]] (that is the [[prime minister]], [[premier]] or [[chief minister]], as the case may be) goes to the [[head of state]] and formally advises him or her to [[dissolution of parliament|dissolve parliament]].  By [[constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]], the head of state grants the request and issues [[writs of election]] for new members of parliament. The usage of the word "drop" in this context is likely derived from the phrase "draw up".&lt;ref name ="Statutes of the Province of Manitoba" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Practice of the Common Law Courts" /&gt;

The head of state usually has the right to refuse the request, in which case the prime minister is required by convention or statute to resign.  For example, in the case of a minority government, the head of state can deny the request for dissolution and ask the leader of another parliamentary party to form a government.  In some cases, such as with the [[President of Ireland]], there are specific limitations on when a head of state can refuse this request.  Even under these circumstances, this right is rarely exercised, as it is likely to precipitate a [[constitutional crisis]] (see, for example, the [[King-Byng Affair]] of 1926) – it is possible that this right, of a head of state to refuse a dissolution, has become a [[lapsed power]].  However, there is a more recent example in the [[Ontario general election, 1985|1985 election in Ontario]].  The incumbent Progressive Conservative party was reduced to minority status, and lost a confidence motion. [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario|Lieutenant Governor]] [[John Black Aird]] asked the opposition Liberal leader to form a government, with third-party NDP support, rather than issuing new writs of election.

== Timing ==
Usually, according to parliamentary law, the head of government must regularly call an election but, it is otherwise within their discretion when to drop the writ, up to the time when the [[parliament]] has served its full term. At that point, an election must be called by issuing the writs.  An exception to this principle is if a [[fixed-term election]] law has been enacted.

In some [[states and territories of Australia]], such as [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]], and the [[Australian Capital Territory]], it is normally required by law that the parliament must run its full term before issuing the writs.  Early dissolutions are allowed by the Governor (NSW, Vic, SA) or federal Minister for Territories (ACT) only if certain objective criteria are met - in particular, if the parliament is unable to agree on the annual [[budget]]. Similarly, in [[New Zealand]], it is the norm for parliament to run full term unless the prime minister cannot govern or feels they must bring an important issue before the nation.

Opposition parties can bring down the government by passing a [[motion of no confidence]], in which the prime minister is required by convention or specific law to either drop the writ or resign; parliaments do not have the right to force the prime minister to drop the writ.

== Etymology ==
The phrase "drop the writ" is a debased form of the phrase "draw up the writ".&lt;ref name ="Statutes of the Province of Manitoba"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it is still considered stylistically inappropriate by some, who assert that the correct phrase is, [https://ipolitics.ca/2015/07/31/writs-end-everybody-please-stop-saying-drop-the-writ/ "the writs are issued"] or "the writs are drawn up," the phrase is nevertheless widely used in [https://www.google.ca/search?q=drop%20the%20writ&amp;tbm=nws edited copy].

'''Empire Ranch''' is a working [[cattle ranch]] in southeastern [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]], [[Arizona]], that was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1976. In its heyday, Empire Ranch was one of the largest in Arizona, with a range spanning over 180 square miles, and its owner, Walter L. Vail, was an important figure in the establishment of southern Arizona's cattle industry.&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Empire Ranch Foundation: History of the Empire Ranch| work=Gregory Paul Dowell| url=http://www.empireranchfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Dowell-Thesis-Converted.pdf| date=| year=| accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/az/Pima/state.html |title=National Register of Historical Places - ARIZONA (AZ), Pima County |publisher=Nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Establishment===
Empire Ranch is located on the eastern slope of the [[Santa Rita Mountains]] in Cienega Valley, fifty-two miles southeast of [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] and about ten miles north of [[Sonoita, Arizona|Sonoita]]. The property overlooks a shallow depression called Empire Gulch, through which a spring-fed rivlet bordered by cottonwoods courses eastward to Cienega Creek. The surrounding meadows are "thickly covered" with [[sacaton]] and [[salt grass]]. Tucson businessman Edward Nye Fish first occupied the site of the ranch in 1871, but it is uncertain whether or not he built the original four-room [[adobe]] house and corral, which may have already been there when he arrived.&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org2"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Empire Ranch Timeline| work=| url=http://www.empireranchfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/empire_ranch_timeline.pdf| date=| year=| accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 22, 1876, an [[Eastern United States|Easterner]] named Walter L. Vail and his [[England|English]] business partner, Herbert R. Hislop, purchased Empire Ranch and its 612 head of cattle from Fish and his partner, Simon Silverberg, who had acquired the 160 acre tract only two months earlier from Fish's brother-in-law, William Wakefield, at a price of [[US|$]]500. Fish and Silverberg wanted $3,800 for the ranch and cattle; but to expedite the sale, they settled on a considerably lower price of $1,174. Vail and Hislop immediately began expanding their holdings in the area by acquiring new lands and improving the ranch's infrastructure. In its heyday, Empire controlled 180 square miles of rangeland between the Santa Rita, [[Rincon Mountains|Rincon]], [[Whetstone Mountains|Whetstone]], and [[Huachuca Mountains]].&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"/&gt;

When Walter's wife, Margaret, arrived from [[New Jersey]] in the summer of 1881, Vail undertook a variety of improvements on the ranch house. Up to that time, Walter had added only a kitchen, pantry, cook's room, and business office to the original four-room structure - just enough to accommodate the [[cowboy]]s who worked the ranch. Shortly after Margaret's arrival, Walter built her an eight-room addition to the earlier dwelling, including two bedrooms, a living room, a dining area and a covered porch. The imposing structure boasted twelve-foot high ceilings, three stone fireplaces for heating, and a fashionable half-hexagon bay window opening off the living room. The Empire Ranch house became a showplace ranch house in southern Arizona. The red-shingled adobe building proved so attractive that, contrary to the common practice among territorial ranch families, Margaret chose to live on the ranch instead of at a separate residence in Tucson. More rooms were added as the years went on, resulting in the current twenty-two room house that is preserved today.&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"/&gt;

The origin of the name Empire Ranch remains unclear. Walter's brother, Edward, said that Walter renamed the Fish holdings after acquiring the property in 1876, claiming "he would make an Empire of it someday." However, in writing to his sister on November 25, 1876, Herbert Hislop stated: " ...it was called the Empire Ranch before we bought it and we have not altered the name." Other accounts suggest that either Fish called the quarter-section spread "the Empire" in a promotional flurry to make it more attractive, or that William Wakefield named the ranch after the nearby Empire Mountains. The evidence weighs against Edward Vail's romanticized version.&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"/&gt;

Vail and Hislop hoped to increase their herd of cattle to about five thousand head. To underwrite expansion and help meet their debts, they took in a third partner in October 1876. Another Englishman, John H. Harvey, had heard about the ranch through Walter's uncle, Nathan. Nathan Vail had been a friend and one-time business partner of Harvey's uncle in England. Learning that John Harvey had money to invest, Nathan had encouraged him to visit Tucson and the Empire Ranch, which he did in the early weeks of October. The wealthy Englishman, although inexperienced at ranching, saw strong potential for the small ranching venture and joined the partnership. The firm changed its name to Vail, Hislop, and Harvey. The neighboring cattlemen called them the "English Boys' Outfit." To keep pace with its new identity, the Empire changed horse brands from "V" to "VH," but kept the familiar heart-shaped brand for the cattle.&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"/&gt;

===Apaches===
{{Main|Apache Wars}}

[[File:John_H_Harvey_Edward_L_Vail_Walter_L_Vail_Empire_Ranch_Arizona_1879.jpg|200px|thumb|John H. Harvey (left), Edward L. Vail (center), and Walter L. Vail (right) in 1879.]]

Indian raids were an ever-present threat, and nearby ranches stopped operation. The Empire, however, remained to fight for their land and their horses (which were considered the prize to the Indians). In the earliest years, hostile [[Apache]]s were an ever-present threat to the ranching operations. The [[Chiricahua Apache]]s, who had been moved to the [[San Carlos Indian Reservation]] in June 1876, became restless and fled south to their old haunts in the Whetstone and [[Chiricahua Mountains]]. Roving bands raided ranches throughout the Cienega Valley, escaping to the nearby hills with a prized booty of horses. Ranchers who sought to retrieve their stack often came back empty-handed, or failed to return at all. In the face of increasing raids, several ranchers near the Empire abandoned their holdings and moved to Tucson. Vail and Hislop, however, were willing to "shoot the renegades on sight."&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"/&gt;

The ranch's isolation and its herd of workhorses made it a likely target for attack. The ranch lay a full day's ride by horseback from Tucson. The only major ranch in the vicinity was Don Sanford's Stock Valley Ranch, located five miles northeast. Vail and Hislop knew that help would not be forthcoming in the event of a raid. The horses had to be constantly guarded. During the day, the riding stock, which numbered nine saddle horses, twenty brood mares, and twelve colts, grazed in a large fenced-in pasture 600 feet from the ranch house. At night they corralled their stock in an adobe enclosure attached to the house. The possibility of a devastating loss of riding stock remained foremost in their thoughts, as Hislop reflected: "How long we shall keep them out of Apaches' hands I do not know, as I suspect we being the only owners of any number of horses around here, that they will pay us a visit."&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"/&gt;

The Indian activity prompted the [[United States Army]] to take action. Writing to his brother, Edward Vail, on January 20, 1876, Walter reported that "this last outbreak has made so much talk that the Government is going to establish a fort 25 miles south of our place, which I hope will put a stop to Indian trouble in this part of the country." As anticipated, the army established [[Fort Huachuca|Camp Huachuca]] on March 3, 1877. However, the camp was too distant to provide protection for the Cienega Valley. Vail and his partners refused to be terrorized by the Apaches. They instructed their [[cowboy]]s to ride the range well-armed and never alone. Even when renegades were reported in the vicinity the cattlemen would not curtail ranch activities. As Edward Vail related: "... the Indians were supposed to be out, but we never stayed home on that account, as it was necessary to keep working."&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"/&gt;

The youthful cattlemen did not suffer greatly from the Apaches. They struck repeatedly in the vicinity but made off with only two horses of the "VH" brand. In a series of raids between August 1876 and February 1877, they stole several herds of livestock and killed three cowboys immediately south of the ranch, but each time skirted around the property. Yet not until [[Geronimo]]'s renegades surrendered to [[General officer|General]] [[Nelson A. Miles]] on September 4, 1886, did the owners of Empire Ranch completely relax.&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"/&gt;

An opportunity to build the Empire herd came in January 1877. The three cattlemen, hoping to avoid the expense and trouble of driving herds from distant ranges, had made inquiries about other cattle in southern Arizona. In the latter part of January, they learned that S. S. "Yankee" Miller, foreman for [[John Chisum]]'s ranch on the [[San Pedro River (Arizona)|San Pedro River]] near [[St. David, Arizona|St. David]], had driven a large herd of Durhams, Herefords, and longhorns from [[New Mexico]] to the vicinity of [[Benson, Arizona|Benson]]. Vail visited Miller at his Benson encampment and purchased 793 cattle at fourteen dollars per head. In the same exchange, Vail disposed of 620 sheep that he had previously bought from his neighbor, Henry M. Kemp. The flock had been a constant nuisance; and Vail gladly parted with them, even at a loss of forty cents per head.&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"/&gt;

The transaction was not without incident, though. Before Vail could remove the herd, a band of Chiricahua Apaches silently approached Miller's compound and crept away with all their horses under cover of darkness. Vail awoke before dawn to discover the loss. Several of the trail crew set out on foot to pursue the thieves south to the Whetstone Mountains but en route dropped the plan for fear the Apaches might outnumber them in their mountain stronghold. They went back by Empire Ranch and picked up enough horses to enable them to safely drive the cattle from the Chisum range to the ranch. In this incident, the Empire's closest scrape with Apaches, Vail had been fortunate; he had lost only one horse, none of the cattle, and no one had been hurt.&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"/&gt;

===Sheep===
{{Main|Sheep Wars}}

In the late spring of 1877, Vail, Hislop, and Harvey decided to introduce better bred beeves into their herd. In April, Walter Vail rode east with Miller and a Chisum trail outfit to John Chisum's Long Rail Ranch on the [[Pecos River]] in New Mexico. Here, Vail purchased forty Durham bulls from Chisum, but injured his knee before he could start back to Arizona. Leaving the cattle, he went to a cousin's home in [[Netawaka, Kansas]], and spent five painful months recuperating. In the fall, Vail and several Chisum trailhands drove the blooded bulls through Apache-controlled territory to the Empire Ranch.&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"/&gt;

During Vail's absence, Hislop and Harvey had trouble with a [[sheepherder]] settling adjacent to Empire Ranch. The neighbor refused to contain his flock on his own range and arrogantly drove them onto the ranchland to water. When the sheep crowded along Cienega Creek, cattle were forced to scatter and move away from the water. The situation infuriated Hislop, who warned the trespasser to stay clear of their land or they would stampede his sheep. The sheepman ignored Hislop's warnings, and the prospect of [[range war]]fare loomed.&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"/&gt;

On February 4, 1878, Hislop wrote the following in a letter to his sister:

{{quote|... it seems to me nothing but trouble the whole time, how things are going to turn out time alone will prove. I only hope that no shooting will occur... but I do not intend to talk to him again on the subject of his sheep. My partner Vail has just returned ... and is very hostile on the subject. I think it needs an American to talk to another American and he means war to the knife.&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"/&gt;}}

Although the dispute never erupted into conflict, it was a decisive factor in Hislop's decision to give up ranching and return to England. By March 1878, he became annoyed at Vail and Harvey's reluctance to market livestock and recoup their initial investment costs. The partners wanted to delay sales until their herds had produced several calf crops. The troublesome neighbor only reinforced Hislop's distaste for the entire ranching venture. Vail urged him to reconsider, but Hislop would not be swayed. Walter borrowed $6,850 from his Aunt Anna, Nathan's wife, and bought Hislop's interest in the ranch. Upon his departure, Hislop announced that he would never return to "this bloody country again."&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"/&gt;

Within a year of Hislops departure, Vail and Harvey welcomed a new partner, Walter's older brother Edward. Edward "Ned" Vail had corresponded with Walter since 1876 and shared his brother's belief that the cattle trade would soon be a large and prosperous industry in Arizona. Ned had been brought up on the family farm in New Jersey and then worked seven years in a [[ship chandler]]'s store in [[New York City]]. Like Walter, Ned had no experience with cattle when he arrived at Empire Ranch on May 14, 1879. Walter immediately put his brother to work on the range, thereby forcing Edward to acquire a cattleman's skill and "carry his weight" at the ranch.&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"/&gt;

===Total Wreck===
{{Main|Total Wreck, Arizona}}

While Walter and his partners were readying their first cattle for market, a silver discovery was made near Empire Ranch which vitally affected its destiny. In January 1879, an itinerant prospector named John T. Dillon, located three mining claims on the boulder-strewn eastern slope of the Empire Mountains. "The whole damned hill is a total wreck," Dillon remarked to co-claimants Walter L. Vail and John A. Harvey. Vail and Harvey liked the description and christened one of the three sites the "Total Wreck." Legal entanglements prevented immediate exploitation of the claim; but when the court re-affirmed their title, the owners incorporated the operation as the Total Wreck Mining and Milling Company.&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"/&gt;

In 1881, Walter and Nathan Vail secured full control of the corporation, sold shares of the company in New York City, and launched a large-scale development at the Total Wreck. Two years later, its production rivaled that of the most prosperous mines in [[Arizona Territory]]. However, the depression in silver prices in 1884 crippled the operation, and the Vails closed it three years later when ore yields fell too low for profit. Although the Total Wreck prospered for only a brief period, it produced over $500,000 in revenue, which contributed significantly to the expansion and development of Empire Ranch.&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"/&gt;

===Later years===
[[File:Empire Ranch circa 1900.jpg|200px|thumb|The Empire Ranch house, {{circa}}1900.]]

In 1886, the ranch was incorporated as the Empire Land and Cattle Company, with California entrepreneur Carroll W. Gates buying half-interest in 1889. The Empire management searched out new markets in [[Kansas City]] and [[Los Angeles]] when the home market collapsed in the mid-1880s. Vail and Gates bought or leased additional grasslands in [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], and [[California]] during drought years of the early nineties. While furthering his own business, Vail argued prominently for cattlemen's interests as a legislator, county supervisor, and president of the Livestock Ranchman's Association.&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"/&gt;

By 1898, the Vails had nearly forty thousand cattle, most of which were [[Hereford (cattle)|Herefords]], on their combined ranges. Vail and Gates converted the home ranch fully to "breeder-feeder" operations, with Arizona-bred cattle shipped outside the territory to fatten. Beginning in 1902, they siphoned corporate assets into lucrative real estate, horse raising, and resort investments on the West Coast. For a time, California endeavors profited Vail and Gates more so than the Arizona ranch. Although Walter Vail died in 1906, his heirs operated Empire Ranch by the same, successful principles Walter had used, until its final sale to the Boice, Gates and Johnston company in 1928.&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org3"&gt;{{Cite web | title=History: Empire Ranch Foundation| work=| url=http://www.empireranchfoundation.org/empire-ranch/history/#boice| date=| year=| accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1951, Frank Boice and his family assumed full control of the property. Around the same time, the ranch was featured in several [[Western film]]s starring many of [[Hollywood]]'s most famous actors, such as [[John Wayne]], [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Steve McQueen]]. In 1969, Empire Ranch was sold to the Gulf American Corporation for a proposed real estate development and later resold to the Anamax Mining Company for mining and water potential. None of these developments materialized, and the ranch continues to work with cattle. In the 1980s, the owners began to restore the buildings to their original state and in 1988 the ranch became public land administered by the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM). The Empire Ranch Foundation was established as a private [[non-profit organization]] in 1997 to work with the BLM to develop private support to preserve the buildings and enhance the educational and recreational opportunities it offers to the public. In 2000, [[United States Congress|Congress]] combined Empire Ranch and the surrounding ranchland with the [[Las Cienegas National Conservation Area]].&lt;ref name="empireranchfoundation.org3"/&gt;

The '''Enforcement Act of 1869''', also known as the '''Civil Rights Act of 1870''' or '''First Ku Klux Klan Act''', or '''Force Act''' was a [[United States federal law]] written to empower the [[President of the United States|President]] with the legal authority to enforce the first section of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] throughout the [[United States]]. The act was the first of three [[Force Acts|Enforcement Acts]] passed by the [[United States Congress]] from 1870 to 1871 during the [[Reconstruction Era]] to combat attacks on the [[Voting rights in the United States#African Americans and poor whites|suffrage rights]] of [[African Americans]] from state officials or violent groups like the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877|year=1997|publisher=Harper &amp; Row, Publishers|location=New York|isbn=9780060937164|pages=454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act would develop from separate legislative actions in the House and Senate. [[41st United States Congress|H.R. 1293]] was introduced by [[House of Representatives of the United States|House]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[John Bingham]] from [[Ohio]] on February 21, 1870, and discussed on May 16, 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wang|first=Xi|title=The Trial of Democracy: Black Suffrage &amp; Northern Republicans, 1860-1910|year=1997|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, Georgia|isbn=9780820318370|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[41st United States Congress|S. 810]] grew from several bills from several Senators. Senator [[George F. Edmunds]] from [[Vermont]] submitted the first bill, followed by Sen. [[Oliver P. Morton]] from [[Indiana]], Sen. [[Charles Sumner]] from [[Massachusetts]], and Sen. [[William Morris Stewart|William Stewart]] from [[Nevada]]. After three months of debate in the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Committee on the Judiciary]], the final Senate version of the bill was introduced to the [[Senate of the United States|Senate]] on April 19, 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wang|first=Xi|title=The Trial of Democracy: Black Suffrage &amp; Northern Republicans, 1860-1910|year=1997|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, Georgia|isbn=9780820318370|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act was passed by Congress in May 1870 and signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] on May 31, 1870.

The Enforcement Act of 1870 prohibited discrimination by state officials in voter registration on the basis of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. It established penalties for interfering with a person's right to vote and gave federal courts the power to enforce the act. The act also authorized the President to employ the use of the army to uphold the act and the use of federal marshals to bring charges against offenders for election fraud, the bribery or intimidation of voters, and conspiracies to prevent citizens from exercising their constitutional rights.

The '''Fiji–France Maritime Delimitation Agreement''' is a 1983 [[treaty]] between [[France]] and [[Fiji]] which [[Boundary delimitation|establishes]] the [[maritime boundary]] between Fiji and the French [[sui generis collectivity|special collectivity]] of [[New Caledonia]] and the boundary between Fiji and the French [[overseas collectivity]] of [[Wallis and Futuna]].

The treaty was signed in [[Suva]] on 19 January 1983. The text of the treaty is brief and states that the [[border|boundaries]] will be set by the principle of setting an equidistant line between the territories.

The boundary with New Caledonia is to the southwest of Fiji and consists of one [[ocean|maritime]] straight-line segment defined by two specific points. For purposes of drawing the border, the treaty assumes that France has sovereignty over [[Matthew and Hunter Islands]], but since [[Vanuatu]] also claims sovereignty over the islands, the treaty states that the treaty is "without prejudice to the sovereign rights of any neighbouring State".

The boundary with Wallis and Futuna is to the northeast of Fiji and consists of four straight-line segments, defined by five individual coordinate points.

The agreement came into force on 21 August 1984, after both states had ratified it. The Fiji – Wallis and Futuna boundary was adjusted slightly by a 1990 [[wikt:codicil|codicil]] to the treaty.

The full name of the treaty is ''Agreement between the Government of the Republic of France and the Government of Fiji relating to the Delimitation of their Economic Zone''.

The recorded '''history of marriage in California''' is long and encompasses a period as far back as the first [[Spanish missions in California|Spanish missions]] and even further back in un[[recorded history]] of Native American Indians and their marriage rituals.

[[California]] was [[History of California to 1899#United States era (beginning 1846)|incorporated]] into the [[United States|United States of America]] in 1850.

== California Native American marriage ==
While the Native Americans of California did not document their culture in the same way western civilization did, we still have a great deal of knowledge from archaeological evidence as well as the earliest records of the Spanish missions.

Native communities in southern California of the Chumash Indians, practiced Matrilocal residence. The husband would move to the community of the wife.

== Jesuit Missionary period 1697–1767 ==
The founding of the California missionary system by the Spanish began in 1697 located in Baja with the founding of Nuestra Senora de Loreto. Several times during the Jesuit period, Indians revolted against church doctrine against polygamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Moon Baja | last=Cummings, Itoi| first=Joe, Nikki| publisher = Avalon Travel Publishing|year = 2007| pages = 470| isbn= 978-1-56691-800-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clemente Guillen, S. J., of Delores mission in Baja California reported in 1744 that he had destroyed the tables and paraphernalia of the Indian shaman and that same year Joseph de Torres Pereas noted the survival of marriage ceremonies indicated that shaman had been convincing adults not to accept baptism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = From savages to subjects | last=Jackson| first= Robert H.| publisher = M.E.

==Marriage, California natives and the Spanish missions, 1785–1810==
While the Franciscan Missions strived to incorporate the native California Indians into their fold, they worked hard to eliminate all marriage and family customs the Spanish Catholic Church disapproved of or found repugnant.

The church was anxious to legitimize the marriages of natives through Catholic ceremonies. Northern California Missions recorded the marriage of 2300 marriages of Native Americans previously joined by native custom with five thousand new unions and ten thousand neophyte widows and widower remarried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Indian Survival on the California Frontier | last=Hurtado| first=Albert L.| publisher = Yale University Press 
|year = 1990| pages = 23| isbn=978-0-300-04798-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage between native Indian woman and Spanish men was encouraged by the California missions to increase the population and Spanish political power. Rape and other forms of violence was however a concern. Spanish Soldiers and settlers of a patriarchal colonial society put native woman in a vulnerable state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Colonial rosary | last=Lake| first=Alison| publisher = Ohio University Press

Author, Charles Francis Saunders has documented the details of a California Mission wedding ceremony from the 1890s in his book, "Capistrano Nights – Tales of a California Mission Town".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Capistrano Nights – Tales of a California Mission Town | last=Saunders| first= Charles Francis| publisher = Saunders Press |year =2007| pages = 15–19| isbn=978-1-4067-5693-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1829 Carrillo-Fitch elopement ==
[[File:Josefa Carrillo Fitch.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Josefa Carrillo Fitch]][[File:Henry Delano Fitch.jpg|thumb|175px|Henry Delano Fitch]]
In 1829 a controversy erupted when the Spanish Governor was asked to intervene in the marriage between a local San Diego Spanish woman and a foreigner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Telling identities | last=Sánchez| first=Rosaura | publisher =  University of Minnesota Press|year =1995| pages = 212| isbn=978-0-8166-2559-8 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria Antonia Natalia Elija Carrillo was born November 27, 1810. Called Josefa, after her grandmother, she was the eldest of thirteen children born to [[Maria Ygnacia Lopez]] and Joaquin Victor Carrillo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Latinas in the United States | last=Ruíz, Korrol| first=Vickie, Virginia Sánchez | publisher = Indiana University Press 
|year = 2006| pages = 122| isbn=978-0-253-34681-0 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influential and socially well connected, the family was related to several other prominent Californians of the day. At the time the youth of California were pressured to marry early.

Instead of marrying another Californian, Carrillo fell in love with American merchant seaman, [[Henry D. Fitch|Henry Delano Fitch]]. Fitch formally requested the hand of Maria Antonia in 1827.

On April 15, 1829, the ceremony was in progress, but was stopped by order of Governor Jose Maria Echeandia. It is believed that the Governor was enraged by Carrillo's choice of a man who refused to naturalize as a citizen, as well as rumored smuggling activity.

The couple eloped in Valparaiso Chile and upon returning to California 1830, Echeandia announced the marriage as "Illegal" and had Fitch imprisoned and placed Carrillo in ''Deposito'', the practice of separating couples to ascertain if they married of their own accord.

Carrillo was held in San Gabriel and Fitch in Monterrey. In December 1830, ecclesiastic authorities found the marriage valid but not legitimate under canon law. To end the scandal, the couple was ordered to pay penance in the order of attending special mass and reciting prayer.

==1850 statehood to 1872==
On September 8, 1850, California entered the US as the 31st state of the union. At the time marriage statutes described marriage as "a civil contract to which the consent of the parties is required" &lt;ref&gt;"The Statutes of California passed at the First Session of the Legislature, J Winchester, Publisher 1850"&lt;/ref&gt;  with gender specific pronouns applied to "husband" and "wife". Later court decisions and some statutes dating from both statehood and the 1872 codification of the civil law state; "Any unmarried male of the age of 18 years or upward and any unmarried female of the age of 15 years old or upward are capable of consenting to and consummating marriage."&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Same-Sex Marriage in California – Overview and Issues |publisher=UC Berkeley, Institute of Governmental Studies |url=http://igs.berkeley.edu/library/htGayMarriage.html |author=IGS Library staff |accessdate=2008-10-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612153127/http://igs.berkeley.edu/library/htGayMarriage.html |archivedate=2008-06-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="in-re-marriage"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=In re Marriage Cases |vol=143 |reporter=Cal.

===Ban on interracial marriage===

In 1850, "all marriages of white persons with Negroes or mulattoes [were] declared to be illegal and void". This stricture held until 1948, at which point the [[California Supreme Court]] became the first state court in the country to strike down a law prohibiting interracial marriage, recognizing marriage as a fundamental right:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marriage is thus something more than a civil contract subject to regulation by the state; it is a fundamental right of free men. There can be no prohibition of marriage except for an important social objective and by reasonable means.  No law within the broad areas of state interest may be unreasonably discriminatory or arbitrary. ...  The right to marry is as fundamental as the right to send one's child to a particular school or the right to have offspring. Indeed, "We are dealing here with legislation which involves one of the basic civil rights of man. Marriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race." (Skinner v. Oklahoma, supra, at p. 541.) Legislation infringing such rights must be based upon more than prejudice and must be free from oppressive discrimination to comply with the constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection of the laws.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Poorly kept records===
While the state required records be kept on marriage certificates and contracts as early as 1851, it wasn't until 1858 that any further information was kept, such as births, divorce and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Care and Use of the County Archives of California | last=Coy, Francis | first=Owen, John| publisher = Kessinger Publishing, LLC |year = 2009| pages = 66| isbn=978-110-448-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the office of the state Registrar was created.

== Contemporary history ==

In 1971, Gov. Ronald Reagan signed legislation making civil nuptials gender-neutral under the law as part of the Women's Liberation Movement in California.

In 1977, Asb. Bruce Nestande (R- Orange County) wrote AB 607 at the behest of the Orange County Clerks Association to exclude same sex couples from civil marriage.

In 2000, The Knight Initiative (Prop 22; CA DOMA) passes with 61.2% of the vote.

In 2001, same-sex couples (including [[Davina Kotulski]] and [[Molly McKay]]) from [[Marriage Equality USA]] began asking for marriage licenses in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The issue of same-sex marriage reemerged in 2004, when [[Mayor of San Francisco]] [[Gavin Newsom]] [[San Francisco 2004 same-sex weddings|directed the city-county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples]], citing the [[Constitution of California|California Constitution]]'s guarantee of equal protection under the law to all groups. The marriages were quickly [[annulment|annulled]] by the California Supreme Court, and the [[San Francisco|city of San Francisco]] issued a legal challenge that was consolidated with other challenges to California's marriage laws. Meanwhile, the California legislature twice passed, and twice received [[veto]]s from governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] on, bills that would have legalized same-sex marriages in the state.

On May 15, 2008, at a time when only the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Massachusetts Supreme Court]] [[Goodridge v. Department of Public Health|had ruled favorably]] on [[Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts|same-sex marriage]], the California Supreme Court ruled on the 2004 San Franciscan challenge with other cases in the watershed [[In re Marriage Cases]]. Applying [[strict scrutiny]] to the state's discrimination between [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and other citizens, marriage was found to be a fundamental right that may not be denied based on [[sexual orientation]], and the relevant laws were struck down.

[[Social conservatism|Social conservatives]] and other dissenters capitalized on the case to renew its thrice-unsuccessful push to [[California ballot proposition|amend the Constitution of California]] to restrict marriage to being between opposite-sex couples, and with unprecedented support from the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[LDS Church|LDS churches]], [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|succeeded]] by a slim margin of votes. One year later, the proposition was verified as legal by the California Supreme Court, but not held to be [[Ex post facto law|retroactive]], so the state of California only recognizes opposite-sex marriages, except for the same-sex marriages granted before the constitutional change in 2008 (including 18,000 marriages granted by California and possibly same-sex marriages granted by other jurisdictions before that date, although a test case has not yet arisen). Prop 8 was eventually overturned by the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] but a stay was placed on same sex marriages until an appeal could be heard by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]. Both, Governor [[Jerry Brown]] and Attorney General, [[Kamala Harris]] had declined to defend the proposition during the appeals process, so the Ninth Circuit allowed the proponents of the amendment to stand for the state government and appeal the decision. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the ruling of the district court in 2012, and the amendment's proponents appealed to the United States Supreme Court. On June 26, 2013, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]'' that the appellants had no standing to appeal. They remanded the case to the Ninth Circuit and vacated their ruling, leaving only the district court's ruling stand. Same-sex marriages resumed two days later when the Ninth Circuit lifted the stay on the district court's ruling.

'''Ian R. Kerr''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[academic]] who is recognized as an international expert in emerging law and technology issues.  He holds a [[Canada Research Chair]] in Ethics, Law, and Technology at the [[University of Ottawa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/chairholders-titulaires/profile-eng.aspx?profileID=583 Chairholder profile], Canada Research Chairs, retrieved 2009-10-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerr teaches [[contract]]s as well as an upper-year seminar offered in Puerto Rico each January. Entitled TechnoRico, the seminar deals with technology law issues of global importance. His devotion to teaching has earned six awards and citations, including the Bank of Nova Scotia Award of Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching, the University of Western Ontario’s Faculty of Graduate Studies’ Award of Teaching Excellence, and the University of Ottawa’s AEECLSS Teaching Excellence Award. He is currently{{when|date=March 2016}} teaching a seminar course on the philosophical, ethical &amp; legal implications of robots and society entitled, "The Robotic Laws".

Kerr studied at the [[University of Alberta]] and the [[University of Western Ontario]].

In addition to co-authoring the widely used business law text, Managing the Law (co-authored by Mitchell McInnes, Anthony VanDuzer, and Chi Carmody), he has published in the areas of ethical and legal aspects of digital copyright, automated electronic commerce, artificial intelligence, cybercrime, nanotechnology, internet regulation, ISP and intermediary liability, online defamation, pre-natal injuries and unwanted pregnancies.  His current program of research includes two large projects: (i) On the Identity Trail, focusing on the impact of information and authentication technologies on our identity and our right to be anonymous; and (ii) An Examination of Digital Copyright, focusing on various aspects of the current effort to reform Canadian copyright legislation, including the implications of such reform on fundamental Canadian values including privacy and freedom of expression.

Professor Kerr is also the originator of [[Kerr’s Postulate]], which states that in any discussion of law and technology, the longer a discussion continues the probability of including a reference to ''[[The Matrix]]'' approaches one.  Kerr’s Postulate is a play on [[Godwin's Law]] stemming from academic research on the man/machine merger and [[artificial intelligence]].

Prior to joining the faculty at the University of Ottawa, he held a joint appointment in the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Information &amp; Media Studies and the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Western Ontario]].

[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15| Thirteen [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] colonies on the east coast of [[North America]] issued a [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776]]
[[File:JuraIndependencia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15| [[Chile]], one of several [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] colonies in [[South America]], issued a [[Chilean Declaration of Independence|Declaration of independence]] in 1818]]

'''Independence''' is a condition of a [[nation]], [[country]], or [[Sovereign state|state]] in which its residents and population, or some portion thereof, exercise [[self-government]], and usually [[sovereignty]], over the territory. The opposite of independence is the status of a [[dependent territory]].

==Definition of independence==
Whether the attainment of independence is different from [[revolution]] has long been contested, and has often been debated over the question of [[violence]] as  [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimate]] means to achieving sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Benjamin |first=Walter |authorlink=Walter Benjamin |title=Walter Benjamin: Selected Writings, Volume 1: 1913–1926 |origyear=1921 |year=1996 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=236–252 |nopp=true |isbn=0-674-94585-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While some revolutions seek and achieve national independence, others aim only to redistribute power  with or without an element of emancipation, such as in [[democratization]] ''within'' a state, which as such may remain unaltered. The [[Haitian Revolution]], for example, began as a colony-wide slave uprising that was originally content with the pro-abolitionist [[French First Republic|French Republic]], only to turn into a war into of independence when [[Napoleon]] tried to re-install slavery. In contrast, the [[American Revolutionary War]] was intended to achieve independence from the beginning. Causes for a country or province wishing to seek independence are many, but most can be summed up as a feeling of inequality compared to the dominant power. The means can extend from peaceful demonstrations, like in the case of [[Indian independence movement|India]](1947), to a [[Wars of national liberation|violent war]] like in the case of [[Algerian War|Algeria]](1954).

===Distinction between independence and autonomy===
''[[Autonomous entity|Autonomy]]'' refers to a kind of independence which has been granted by an overseeing [[authority]] that itself still retains ultimate authority over that territory (see [[Devolution]]). A [[protectorate]] refers to an autonomous region that depends upon a larger government for its protection as an autonomous region.

==Declarations of independence==
Sometimes, a state wishing to achieve independence from a dominating power will issue a [[declaration of independence]]; the earliest surviving example is [[Scotland]]'s [[Declaration of Arbroath]] in 1320, with the most recent example being [[Azawad]]'s declaration of independence in 2012. Declaring independence and attaining it however, are quite different. A well-known successful example is the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|U.S. Declaration of Independence]] issued in 1776. The dates of established independence (or, less commonly, the commencement of revolution), are typically celebrated as a national [[Public holiday|holiday]] known as an [[independence Day|independence day]].

==Historical overview==
Historically, there have been three major periods of declaring independence:
* from the 1770s, beginning with the [[American Revolutionary War]] through the 1830s, when the last royalist bastions fell at the close of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]];
* the immediate aftermath of the [[First World War]] following the breakup of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]], [[German Empire|German]] empires; 
* and 1945 to circa 1979, when seventy newly independent states emerged from the European [[colonial empire]]s and collapsed [[III Reich|nazi German Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]], ''[http://maghis.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/3/61.full The Declaration of Independence in World Context]'', [[Organization of American Historians]],  ''Magazine of History'', Volume 18, Issue 3, Pp. 61–66 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:55 Savushkina Street.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|One of the offices at 55 Savushkina Street in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]]]

The '''Internet Research Agency''' ('''IRA'''; {{lang-ru| Агентство интернет-исследований}}, also known as '''Glavset'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-may-have-more-russian-troll-farms-to-worry-about |title= Facebook May Have More Russian Troll Farms to Worry About|website=wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and known in Russian [[Internet slang]] as the '''Trolls from Olgino''') is a Russian company, based in [[Saint Petersburg]], engaged in online [[influence operations]] on behalf of Russian business and political interests.

The January 2017 report issued by the [[United States Intelligence Community]] – ''[[Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections]]'' – described the Agency as a [[troll farm]] writing, "The likely financier of the so-called Internet Research Agency of professional trolls located in Saint Petersburg is a close [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] ally with ties to Russian intelligence," noted that "they previously were devoted to supporting Russian actions in Ukraine—[and] started to advocate for President-elect [[Donald Trump|Trump]] as early as December 2015."

The agency has employed [[sock puppetry|fake accounts]] registered on major [[social network]]s,&lt;ref name=F273/&gt; discussion boards, [[online newspaper]] sites, and [[video hosting service]]s to promote the Kremlin's interests in [[Domestic policy of Vladimir Putin|domestic]] and [[Foreign policy of Vladimir Putin|foreign policy]] including [[Ukraine]] and the [[Middle East]] as well as [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|attempting to influence the 2016 United States presidential election]]. More than 1,000 employees reportedly worked in a single building of the agency in 2015.

The extent to which a Russian agency has tried to influence public opinion using social media became better known after a June 2014 ''[[BuzzFeed]]'' article greatly expanded on government documents published by hackers earlier that year.&lt;ref name="BuzzFeed_02.06.2014"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Documents Show How Russia’s Troll Army Hit America |author=Max Seddon |date=2 June 2014 |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/maxseddon/documents-show-how-russias-troll-army-hit-america |website=[[BuzzFeed]] |language=en |access-date=12 June 2016}} Russian reprint: [http://inopressa.ru/article/03Jun2014/buzzfeed/web_rus.html Документы показали, как армия российских 'троллей' атакует Америку] (InoPressa).&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet Research Agency gained more attention by June 2015, when one of its offices was reported as having data from fake accounts used for biased [[Internet troll]]ing.

Journalists have written that [[Alexey Soskovets]], who had participated in the Russian youth political community, was directly connected to the office in Olgino, and that his company, North-Western Service Agency, won 17 or 18 (according to different sources) contracts for organizing celebrations, forums and sport competitions for authorities of Saint Petersburg and that Soskovets' company was the only participant in half of those bids.

Russian media point out that according to documents, published by hackers from [[Anonymous International]], Concord Management is directly involved with trolling administration through the agency. Researchers cite e-mail correspondence, in which Concord  Management gives instructions to trolls and receives reports on accomplished work.&lt;ref name="Fontanka_29.05.2014"/&gt; According to journalists, Concord Management organized banquets in the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] and also cooperated with Voentorg and the [[Ministry of Defence (Russia) |Russian Ministry of Defence]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

According to Russian online newspaper [[:ru:Деловой Петербург|DP.ru]], several months before October 2014 the office moved from Olgino to a four-story building at 55 Savushkina Street, [[Primorsky District, Saint Petersburg|Primorskiy district]], [[Saint Petersburg|St.&amp;nbsp;Peterburg]].&lt;ref name="LI_28.10.2014"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://lenizdat.ru/articles/1124598/ |title=СМИ: "Ольгинские тролли" стали "савушкинскими" |trans-title='Trolls from Olgino' have become 'savushkinskimi' |author=Sofia Korzova |date=28 October 2014 |language=ru |newspaper=Lentizdat |accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DP.Ru_28.10.2014"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dp.ru/a/2014/10/27/Borotsja_s_omerzeniem_mo/ |title=Тролли из Ольгино переехали в новый четырехэтажный офис на Савушкина |trans-title=Trolls from Olgino moved to a new four-story office on Savushkina |author= |date=28 October 2014 |language=ru |newspaper=[[:ru:Деловой Петербург|DP.Ru]] |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As reported by journalists, the building is officially an uncompleted construction and stayed as such as of March 2015.&lt;ref name="NG_11.03.2015"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/inquests/67574.html?p=10 |title=Как стать тролльхантером |trans-title=How to become a troll-breaker |author=Diana Khachatryan |date=11 March 2015 |language=ru |newspaper=[[Novaya Gazeta]] |volume=24 |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dp.ru/a/2014/10/27/Borotsja_s_omerzeniem_mo/ Тролли из Ольгино переехали в новый четырехэтажный офис на Савушкина] {{ru icon}}. dp.ru. 28 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lenizdat.ru/articles/1124598/ СМИ: «Ольгинские тролли» стали «савушкинскими»] {{ru icon}}.

A ''[[New York Times]]'' investigative reporter was told that the Internet Research Agency had shortened its name to "Internet Research," and as of June 2015 had been asked to leave the 55 Savushkina Street location "a couple of months ago" because "it was giving the entire building a bad reputation." A possibly related organization, ''FAN'' or Federal News Agency, was located in the building. ''The New York Times'' article describes various experiences reported by former employees of the Internet Research Agency at the Savushkina Street location. It also describes several disruptive hoaxes in the US and Europe, such as the [[Columbian Chemicals Plant explosion hoax]], that may be attributable to the Internet Research Agency or similar Russian-based organizations.&lt;ref name = "chen20150602"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chen|first=Adrian|authorlink=Adrian Chen|title=The Agency: From a nondescript office building in St. Petersburg, Russia, an army of well-paid 'trolls' has tried to wreak havoc all around the Internet – and in real-life American communities|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=2 June 2015|access-date=3 June 2015|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other cities ===
''Novaya Gazeta'' reported that, according to Alexey Soskovets, head of the office in Olgino, North-Western Service Agency was hiring employees for similar projects in Moscow and other cities in 2013.&lt;ref name="NG_09.09.2013"/&gt;

== Work organization ==
More than 1,000 paid bloggers and commenters reportedly worked only in a single building at Savushkina Street in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/17/politics/russian-oligarch-putin-chef-troll-factory/index.html|title=Putin's 'chef,' the man behind the troll factory|first=Tim Lister, Jim Sciutto and Mary Ilyushina,|last=CNN|website=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other employees work remotely.  According to ''[[BuzzFeed]]'', more than 600 people were generally employed in the trolls' office earlier, in June 2014.&lt;ref name="BuzzFeed_02.06.2014"/&gt; Each commentator has a daily quota of  100 comments.&lt;ref name="NG_09.09.2013"/&gt;

Trolls take shifts writing mainly in blogs on [[LiveJournal]] and [[Vkontakte]], about subjects along the propaganda lines assigned. Included among the employees are artists who draw political cartoons.&lt;ref name="NG_11.03.2015"/&gt; They work for 12 hours every other two days. A blogger's quota is ten posts per shift, each post at least 750 characters. A commenter's norm is 126 comments and two posts per account. Each blogger is in charge of three accounts.&lt;ref name="LI_28.10.2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DP.Ru_28.10.2014"/&gt;

Employees at the Olgino office earned 25,000 Russian rubles per month; those at the Savushkina Street office earned approximately 40,000 Russian rubles.&lt;ref name="LI_28.10.2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DP.Ru_28.10.2014"/&gt; In May 2014, Fontanka.ru described schemes for plundering the federal budget, intended to go toward the trolling organization.&lt;ref name="Fontanka_29.05.2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UK_05.06.2014"/&gt; In 2017 another whistleblower said that with bonuses and long working hours the salary can reach 80,000 rubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://euvsdisinfo.eu/confessions-of-a-pro-kremlin-troll/|title=Confessions of a pro-Kremlin troll {{!}} EU vs Disinformation|website=euvsdisinfo.eu|language=en-US|access-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An employee interviewed by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described the work: {{quote|I immediately felt like a character in the book ''1984'' by George Orwell — a place where you have to write that white is black and black is white. Your first feeling, when you ended up there, was that you were in some kind of factory that turned lying, telling untruths, into an industrial assembly line.&lt;ref name="Orwell"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Troianovski|first1=Anton|title=A former Russian troll speaks: 'It was like being in Orwell's world'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/17/a-former-russian-troll-speaks-it-was-like-being-in-orwells-world/|accessdate=19 February 2018|publisher=Washington Post|date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Trolling themes ==
According to the testimonies of the investigative journalists and former employees of the offices, the main topics for posts included:&lt;ref name="NG_09.09.2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mr7.ru_30.05.2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LI_28.10.2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DP.Ru_28.10.2014"/&gt;

* Criticism of [[Ukraine]]'s and the [[United States]]' foreign policies, and of the top politicians of these states;
* Praise for [[Vladimir Putin]] and the policy of the [[Russian Federation]].
* Praise for and defense of [[Bashar al-Assad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11656043/My-life-as-a-pro-Putin-propagandist-in-Russias-secret-troll-factory.html |title=Video: My life as a pro-Putin propagandist in Russia’s secret 'troll factory' |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists have written that themes of trolling were consistent with those of other [[Russian propaganda]] outlets in topics and timing. Technical points used by trolls were taken mainly from [[Russia Today]] content.&lt;ref name="NG_11.03.2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DP.Ru_28.10.2014"/&gt;

A 2015 BBC investigation identified the Olgino factory as the most likely producer of a September 2015 "[[Saiga-12#Variants|Saiga 410K]] review" video where an actor posing as U.S. soldier shoots at a book that turns out to be a [[Quran]], which sparked outrage. The BBC found among other irregularities that the soldier's uniform is not used by the U.S. military and is easily purchased in Russia, and that the actor filmed was most likely a barman from Saint Petersburg related to a troll factory employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.com/russian/society/2016/03/160315_smj_trolls_make_haram_video |author=Andrew Soshnikov |title=Фейковый расстрел: кто стоит за роликом об уничтожении Корана |trans-title= Fake shot: Who is behind the filming of the destruction of the Quran |date=23 March 2016 |work=[[BBC Russian Service]] |language=ru |accessdate=24 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/video-us-soldier-shooting-quran-7654058 |title=Video of 'US soldier shooting Qur'an' is a fake made in Russia |author=Ross Logan |date=30 March 2016 |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] |language=en |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[citizen-journalism]] site [[Eliot Higgins#Bellingcat|''Bellingcat'']] identified the team from Olgino as the real authors of a video attributed to the [[Azov Battalion]] in which masked soldiers threaten [[the Netherlands]] for organizing the [[Dutch Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement referendum, 2016|referendum]] on the [[Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2016/04/03/azov-video/ |title=Behind the Dutch Terror Threat Video: The St. Petersburg 'Troll Factory' Connection |author=&lt;!--Anonymity of reporter(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=3 April 2016 |website=Bellingcat |language=en-US |access-date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organized anti-Ukrainian campaign ==
{{see also| Media portrayal of the Ukrainian crisis}}
In the beginning of April 2014 there began an organized online campaign to shift [[public opinion]] in the [[Western countries|Western world]] in a way that would be useful for Russian authorities regarding the [[2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|Russian military intervention in Ukraine in 2014]]. Hacked and leaked documents from that time contain instructions for commenters posting at the websites of [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]], ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', ''[[TheBlaze]]'', ''[[Politico]]'', and [[WorldNetDaily]]. The requirement for the working hours for the trolls is also mentioned: 50 comments under news articles per day. Each blogger has to manage six accounts on [[Facebook]], post at least three posts every day, and participate twice in the group discussions. Other employees have to manage 10 accounts on [[Twitter]], publishing 50 tweets every day. Journalists concluded that Igor Osadchiy was a probable leader of the project, and the campaign itself was run by Internet Research Agency Ltd.

Three months later, the same accounts posted false messages on Twitter about an [[Ebola]] outbreak in [[Atlanta]] under the keyword #EbolaInAtlanta, quickly relayed and picked up by users living in the city. A video was then posted on YouTube, showing a medical team treating an alleged Ebola victim at Atlanta Airport. On the same day, a different group launched a rumor on Twitter under the keyword #shockingmurderinatlanta, reporting the death of a disarmed black woman shot by police.

=== Rallies and protests organized by IRA in the United States ===
On 4 April 2016, a rally in [[Buffalo, New York]] protested the death of India Cummings, a black woman who had recently died in police custody. IRA's "Blacktivist" [[Facebook]] account actively promoted the event and reached out directly to local activists on Facebook Messenger asking them to circulate petitions and print posters. "Blacktivist" supplied the petitions and poster artwork.&lt;ref name=LeakedIRADocumentsDailyBeast20180301&gt;{{cite news |title=Leaked: Secret Documents From Russia’s Election Trolls |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/exclusive-secret-documents-from-russias-election-trolls-leak/ |accessdate=29 March 2018 |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |date=1 March 2018|last1=Ackerman|first1=Spencer|last2=Resnick|first2=Gideon|last3=Collins|first3=Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rally on 16 April 2016, protesting the [[death of Freddie Gray]] attracted large crowds in [[Baltimore]]. IRA's "Blacktivist" Facebook group promoted and organized the event, including reaching out to local activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did Russia fake black activism on Facebook to sow division in the US? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/30/blacktivist-facebook-account-russia-us-election|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 September 2017|access-date=2 April 2018|last=Levin|first=Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 April 2016, a small group of white-power demonstrators held a rally they called "Rock Stone Mountain" at [[Stone Mountain]] Park near [[Stone Mountain, Georgia]]. They were confronted by a large group of protesters, and some violent clashes ensued. The protest was heavily promoted by IRA accounts on [[Tumblr]], [[Twitter]], and Facebook, and the IRA website blackmatters.com. The IRA used its Blacktivist Facebook account to reach out, to no avail, to activist and academic Barbara Williams Emerson, the daughter of [[Hosea Williams]], to help promote the protests. Afterward, [[RT (TV network)|RT]] blamed anti-racist protesters for violence and promoted two videos shot at the event.&lt;ref name=LeakedIRADocumentsDailyBeast20180301 /&gt;

On 2 May 2016, a second rally was held in [[Buffalo, New York]], protesting the death of India Cummings. Like the 4 April rally, the event was heavily promoted by IRA's "Blacktivist" Facebook account, including attempted outreach to local activists.&lt;ref name=LeakedIRADocumentsDailyBeast20180301 /&gt;

On 21 May 2016, two competing rallies were held in [[Houston]] to alternately protest against and defend the recently opened Library of Islamic Knowledge at the [[Islam in Houston|Islamic Da'wah Center]]. The "Stop Islamization of Texas" rally was organized by the Facebook group "Heart of Texas". The posting for the event encouraged participants to bring guns. A spokesman for the group conversed with the [[Houston Press]] via email but declined to give a name. The other rally, "Save Islamic Knowledge", was organized by another Facebook group called "United Muslims of America" for the same time and location. Both Facebook groups were later revealed to be IRA accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hate Group Planning Islamic Library Protest Totally Doesn't Think They're a Hate Group|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/news/hate-group-planning-islamic-library-protest-totally-doesnt-think-theyre-a-hate-group-8393815|website=[[Houston Press]]|date=11 May 2016|access-date=30 March 2018|last=Malisow|first=Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FacebookPhonyEventsWapo20180125&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/01/25/russians-got-tens-of-thousands-of-americans-to-rsvp-for-their-phony-political-events-on-facebook/?hpid=hp_no-name_no-name%3Apage%2Fbreaking-news-bar |title=Russians got tens of thousands of Americans to RSVP for their phony political events on Facebook |date=25 January 2018 |publisher=The Washington Post|last1=Timberg|first1=Craig|last2=Dwoskin|first2=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 May 2016, the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] held its annual protest of [[Lawrence High School (Kansas)|Lawrence High School]] graduation ceremonies in [[Lawrence, Kansas]]. The "LGBT United" Facebook group organized a counter protest to confront the Westboro Baptist Church protest, including by placing an ad on Facebook and contacting local people. About a dozen counter protesters showed up. Lawrence High School students did not participate in the counter protest because they were skeptical of the counter protest organizers. "LGBT United" was an IRA account that appears to have been created specifically for this event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook ad promoting 2016 Lawrence protest among those paid for by Russian trolls|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2017/nov/01/facebook-ad-promoting-2016-lawrence-protest-among-/|website=[[Lawrence Journal-World]]|date=1 November 2017|access-date=1 April 2018|last=Hlavacek|first=Joanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IRA's "Don't Shoot" Facebook group and affiliated "Don't Shoot Us" website tried to organize a protest outside [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] police headquarters on 10 July 2016, in response to the 6 July fatal police [[shooting of Philando Castile]]. Some local activists became suspicious of the motives behind the event because St. Paul police were not involved in the shooting. Castille had been shot by a [[St. Anthony, Minnesota|St. Anthony]] police officer in nearby [[Falcon Heights, Minnesota|Falcon Heights]]. Local activists contacted "Don't Shoot." After being pressed on who they were and who supported them, "Don't Shoot" agreed to move the protest to St. Anthony police headquarters. The concerned local activists investigated further and urged protesters not to participate after deciding "Don't Shoot" was a "total troll job."  "Don't Shoot" organizers eventually relinquished control of the event to local organizers, who subsequently declined to accept any money offered by "Don't Shoot" to cover expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did Russian hackers organize Castile protest?

The '''Leonard Law''' is a [[California law]] passed in 1992 and amended in 2006 that applies the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]] to [[private school|private]] and [[public university|public]] [[college]]s, high schools, and [[university|universities]]. The law also applies Article I, Section 2 of the [[California Constitution]] to colleges and universities. California is the only state to grant First Amendment protections to students at private postsecondary institutions. Attempts at a [[federal government of the United States|federal]] Leonard Law and for Leonard Laws in other states have not succeeded.

==About==
[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[California State Senate|State Senator]] [[Bill Leonard (politician)|Bill Leonard]] wrote the law to require private high schools, colleges and universities to protect their students' rights to [[freedom of speech]] "and other [[communication]]" that the [[government]] is required to protect for all of its [[citizen]]s. Under the terms of the law, students may file [[civil law (common law)|civil]] [[lawsuit]]s to seek [[injunction|injunctive]] and [[declaratory relief]] against their institutions; students may also recover any [[attorney's fee]]s related to the case.

In 2006, California amended the law to include public institutions of higher education, which in California consist of the [[California Community Colleges System]], the [[California State University]] system, and the [[University of California]] system. State Assembly members [[Leland Yee]] and [[Joe Nation]] authored the amendment in preemptive response to the ''[[Hosty v. Carter]]'' decision of the federal [[Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]]. The amendment came into force in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/calif-expands-freedoms-for-college-press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.splc.org/knowyourrights/legalresearch.asp?subcat=4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
On May 2, 1994, [[Stanford Law School]] student Robert J. Corry and eight other [[Stanford University]] students filed the first lawsuit under the Leonard Law, claiming that Stanford's [[speech code]] violated the law. On February 27, 1995, [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] [[Superior Court]] Judge Peter G. Stone issued the ruling in ''[[Corry v. Stanford]]'' that struck down the speech code as a violation of the Leonard Law.

[[File:Vivienda prefabricada.jpg|thumb|[[Prefabricated]] house in [[Valencia]], [[Spain]].]]
'''Modular buildings''' and '''modular homes''' are [[prefabricated building]]s or [[house]]s that consist of repeated sections called modules. "Modular" is a construction method that involves constructing sections away from the building site, then delivering them to the intended site. Installation of the prefabricated sections is completed on site. Prefabricated sections are sometimes placed using a [[crane (machine)|crane]]. The modules can be placed side-by-side, end-to-end, or stacked, allowing a variety of configurations and styles.

Modular buildings, also called prefabricated homes or precision built homes, are built to equal or higher standards as on-site [[stick-built home]]s. The building method is referred to as permanent modular construction. 

Material for stick built and modular homes are the same. Modular homes are not doublewides or mobile homes. First, modular homes do not have axles or a metal frame, meaning that they are typically transported on flat-bed [[truck]]s. Modular buildings must conform to all relevant local building codes, while doublewides and mobile homes have metal under framing. Doublewides and mobile homes made in the United States are required to conform to federal codes governed by [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/ramh/mhs/faq|title=HUD- Manufactured Housing and Standards|website=Portal.hud.gov|access-date=2016-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504145914/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fprogram_offices%2Fhousing%2Framh%2Fmhs%2Ffaq|archive-date=2016-05-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
[[File:Modular home (Palmer, Alaska - 2006).jpg|thumb|right|Modular home in [[Sutton, Alaska]]]]
Modular buildings may be used for long-term, temporary or permanent facilities, such as construction camps, schools and classrooms, civilian and military housing, and industrial facilities. Modular buildings are used in remote and rural areas where conventional construction may not be reasonable or possible, for example, the Halley VI accommodation pods used for a BAS Antarctic expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bas.ac.uk/polar-operations/sites-and-facilities/facility/halley/|title=Halley VI Research Station - British Antarctic Survey|website=Bas.ac.uk|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses have included churches, health care facilities, sales and retail offices, fast food restaurants and cruise ship construction. They can also be used in areas that have weather concerns, such as hurricanes.
{{toclimit|3}}
==Construction process==
Construction is offsite, using [[lean manufacturing]] techniques to prefabricate single or multi-story buildings in deliverable module sections. Permanent Modular Construction (PMC) buildings are manufactured in a controlled setting and can be constructed of wood, steel, or concrete. Modular components are typically constructed indoors on [[assembly lines]]. Modules' construction may take as little as ten days but more often one to three months. PMC modules can be integrated into site built projects or stand alone and can be delivered with [[Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|MEP]], fixtures and interior finishes.

The buildings are 60% to 90% completed offsite in a factory-controlled environment, and transported and assembled at the final building site. This can comprise the entire building or be components or subassemblies of larger structures. In many cases, modular contractors work with traditional general contractors to exploit the resources and advantages of each type of construction. Completed modules are transported to the building site and assembled by a crane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modular.org/htmlPage.aspx?name=why_modular|title=Why Build Modular?|website=Modular.org|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placement of the modules may take from several hours to several days.

Permanent modular buildings are built to meet or exceed the same building codes and standards as site-built structures and the same architect-specified materials used in conventionally constructed buildings are used in modular construction projects. PMC can have as many stories as building codes allow. Unlike relocatable buildings, PMC structures are intended to remain in one location for the duration of their useful life.

==Manufacturing considerations==
The entire process of [[modular construction]] places significance on the design stage. This is where practices such as [[DFMA|Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA)]] are used to ensure that assembly tolerances are controlled throughout manufacture and assembly on site. It is vital that there is enough allowance in the design to allow the assembly to take up any "slack" or misalignment of components. The use of advanced [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] systems, [[3D printing]] and manufacturing control systems are important for modular construction to be successful. This is quite unlike on-site construction where the tradesman can often make the part to suit any particular installation.

==Advantages==
[[File:Modular Construction Timeline.jpg|thumb|Simultaneous site development and building construction at the plant reduces schedule by 30% to 50%]]

Modular buildings are argued to have advantages over conventional buildings, for a variety of reasons. 
*'''Speed of construction/faster return on investment'''. Modular construction allows for the building and the site work to be completed simultaneously. According to some materials, this can reduce the overall completion schedule by as much as 50%. This also reduces labor, financing and supervision costs. To save even more time and money, nearly all design and engineering disciplines are part of the manufacturing process. Also unique to modular construction is the ability to simultaneously construct a building’s floors, walls, ceilings, rafters, and roofs. During site-built construction, walls cannot be set until floors are in position, and ceilings and rafters cannot be added until walls are erected. On the other hand, with modular construction, walls, floors, ceilings, and rafters are all built at the same time, and then brought together in the same factory to form a building. This process can allow modular construction times of half that of conventional, stick-built construction.
*'''Indoor construction'''. Assembly is independent of weather, which can increase work efficiency and avoids damaged building material.
*'''Ability to service remote locations'''. Particularly in countries in which potential markets may be located far from industrial centers, such as Australia, there can be much higher costs to build a site-built house in a remote area or an area experiencing a construction boom such as mining towns. Modular buildings are also beneficial in providing medical and sanitary facilities where time, space, and money are an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://comstruc.com/modular-construction-advantages/|title=Modular Construction Advantages &amp; Modern Day Applications - Commercial Structures Corp.|date=2017-07-26|work=Commercial Structures Corp.|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Low waste'''. With the same plans being constantly built, the manufacturer has records of exactly what quantity of materials are needed for a given job. With the consistency, builders can design systems that use common lengths of lumber, wallboard, etc., cut items with maximum efficiency, or be able to order special lengths in bulk. While waste from a site-built dwelling may typically fill several large dumpsters, construction of a modular dwelling generates much less waste. According to the UK group WRAP, up to a 90% reduction in materials can be achieved through the use of modular construction. Materials minimized include: wood pallets, shrink wrap, cardboard, plasterboard, timber, concrete, bricks, and cement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrap.org.uk/sites/files/wrap/Modern%20Methods%20of%20Construction%20-%20Summmary.pdf|title=Current Practices and Future Potential in Modern Methods of Construction|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Environmentally friendly construction process'''. Modular construction reduces waste and site disturbance compared to site-built structures. The controlled environment of the factory allows for more accurate construction while allowing the extra materials to be recycled in-house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.constructionworld.org/7-benefits-prefabricated-construction/|title=7 Benefits of Prefabricated Construction - Construction World|website=Constructionworld.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Flexibility'''. One can continually add to a modular building, including creating high rises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = High-rise housing going modular|url = http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/02/01/high-rise-housing-going-modular/|website=News.blogs.cnn.com|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the needs change, modular buildings can be disassembled and the modules relocated or refurbished for their next use reducing the demand for raw materials and minimizing the amount of energy expended to create a building to meet the new need. In essence, the entire building can be recycled in some cases.
*'''Quality'''. Combining traditional building techniques, quality manufacturing and third-party agencies who offer random inspections, testing, and certification services for quality control, commercial modular buildings are built in strict accordance with appropriate local, state, and national regulations and codes. Due to the need to transport modules to the final site, each module must be built to independently withstand travel and installation requirements. Thus the final module-to-module assembly of independently durable components can yield a final product that is more durable than site-built structures. Modular buildings often use [[Structural insulated panel|Structural Insulated Panels]] (SIPs) in construction, which offer a range of advantages over traditional building materials. SIPs panels are a light yet durable combination of panel board and either closed-cell [[polyurethane]] (PU) or expanded [[polystyrene]] (EPS) insulating foam. They are air-tight, and as such provide excellent thermal performance. They also offer superior damp and cold resistance when compared to timber and other materials, and are immune to both compression shrinking and cold bridging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.green-modular.com/blog/structural-insulated-panels/|title=Structural Insulated Panels {{!}}Green Modular|website=Green Modular|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modular units may also be designed to fit in with external aesthetics of any existing building and modular units once assembled can be virtually indistinguishable from a site-built structure.
* '''Improved Air Quality''' - Many of the indoor air quality issues identified in new construction result from high moisture levels in the framing materials. Because the modular structure is substantially completed in a factory-controlled setting using dry materials, the potential for high levels of moisture being trapped in the new construction is eliminated.

Modular buildings can also contribute to LEED requirements in any category site-built construction can, and can even provide an advantage in the areas of Sustainable Sites, Energy and Atmosphere, Materials and Resources, and Indoor Environmental Quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modular.org/marketing/documents/Modular_09V3LEED.pdf |title=Modular Building and the USGBC’s LEED ™ Version 3.0 2009 Building Rating System}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Modular construction can also provide an advantage in similar categories in the International Green Construction Code.

==Disadvantages==
*Volumetric: Transporting the completed modular building sections take up a lot of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pros and Cons of a Commercial Modular Building|url = http://www.modulartoday.com/pros-cons.html|website = www.modulartoday.com|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Flexibility: Due to transport and sometimes manufacturing restrictions, module size can be limited, affecting room sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Prefab Housing Disadvantages|url = http://budgeting.thenest.com/prefab-housing-disadvantages-24540.html|website = Budgeting Money - The Nest|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some financial institutions may be hesitant to offer a loan for a modular home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://learningcenter.statefarm.com/residence/buying-selling/what-to-know-when-buying-a-manufactured-home/|title=Buying a Manufactured Home|last=|first=|date=|website=State Farm|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market acceptance===
[[Image:Stoke newington raines court 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Raines Court is a multi-story modular housing block in [[Stoke Newington]], [[London]], one of the first two residential buildings in Britain of this type. (December 2005)]]
Some home buyers and some lending institutions resist consideration of modular homes as equivalent in value to site-built homes.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} While the homes themselves may be of equivalent quality, entrenched zoning regulations and psychological marketplace factors may create hurdles for buyers or builders of modular homes and should be considered as part of the decision-making process when exploring this type of home as a living and/or investment option. In the UK and Australia, modular homes have become accepted in some regional areas; however, they are not commonly built in major cities. Modular homes are becoming increasingly common in Japanese urban areas, due to improvements in design and quality, speed and compactness of onsite assembly, as well as due to lowering costs and ease of repair after earthquakes. Recent innovations allow modular buildings to be indistinguishable from site-built structures.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Surveys have shown that individuals can rarely tell the difference between a modular home and a site-built home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Factory-Built Construction and the American Homebuyer: Perceptions and Opportunities|url=https://www.huduser.gov/portal/Publications/pdf/Perceptions_of_factory_construction.pdf|format=PDF|website=Huduser.gov|page=9|accessdate = 2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modular homes vs. mobile homes===
Differences include the building codes that govern the construction, types of material used and how they are appraised by banks for lending purposes. Modular homes are built to either local or state building codes as opposed to manufactured homes, which are also built in a factory but are governed by a federal building code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drysideproperty.com/mobile%20vs%20manuf%20vs%20modular.html|title=Mobile homes vs Manufactured homes vs Modular homes|last=Solutions|first=Dryside Property - Jennifer Mitchell and Magic Web|website=Drysideproperty.com|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The codes that govern the construction of modular homes are exactly the same codes that govern the construction of site-constructed homes.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} In the United States, all modular homes are constructed according to the [[International Building Code]] (IBC), IRC, BOCA or the code that has been adopted by the local jurisdiction.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} In some states, such as California, mobile homes must still be registered yearly, like vehicles or standard trailers, with the Department of Motor Vehicles or other state agency. This is true even if the owners remove the axles and place it on a permanent foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcd.ca.gov/manufactured-mobile-home/index.shtml|title=HCD Manufactured and Mobile Homes|website=Hcd.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognizing a mobile or manufactured home===
A mobile home should have a small metal tag on the outside of each section. If you cannot locate a tag, you should be able to find details about the home in the electrical panel box. This tag should also reveal a manufacturing date.&lt;ref name="freshome.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freshome.com/2013/03/27/10-basic-facts-about-modular-homes/|title=10 Basic Facts You Should Know About Modular Homes - Freshome.com|author=|date=13 November 2015|website=freshome.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modular homes do not have metal tags on the outside but will have a dataplate installed inside the home, usually under the kitchen sink or in a closet. The dataplate will provide information such as the manufacturer, third party inspection agency, appliance information, and manufacture date.

===Materials===
The materials used in modular homes are typically the same as site constructed homes. Wood-frame floors, walls and roof are often utilized. Some modular homes include brick or stone exteriors, granite counters and steeply pitched roofs. Modulars can be designed to sit on a perimeter foundation or basement. In contrast, mobile homes are constructed with a steel chassis that is integral to the integrity of the floor system. Modular buildings can be custom built to a client's specifications. Current designs include multi-story units, multi-family units and entire apartment complexes. The negative stereotype commonly associated with mobile homes has prompted some manufacturers to start using the term "off-site construction."

=== Financing ===
'''Mobile homes''' often require special lenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/sfh/title/repair|title=HUD Financing Manufactured (Mobile) Homes|website=Portal.hud.gov|access-date=2016-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503104807/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fprogram_offices%2Fhousing%2Fsfh%2Ftitle%2Frepair|archive-date=2016-05-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Modular homes''' on the other hand are financed as site built homes with a construction loan&lt;ref name="freshome.com"/&gt;

==Standards and zoning considerations==
Typically, modular dwellings are built to local, state or council code, resulting in dwellings from a given manufacturing facility having differing construction standards depending on the final destination of the modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/lgheamhr1995693/ |title=Australian Government modular home regulations|website=Austlii.edu.au |accessdate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important zones that manufacturers have to take into consideration are local wind, heat, and snow load zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://homenation.com/zone-maps/ |title=Home Building Zone Maps }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, homes built for final assembly in a hurricane-prone, earthquake or flooding area may include additional bracing to meet local building codes. Steel and/or wood framing are common options for building a modular home.

Some US courts have ruled that [[zoning]] restrictions applicable to mobile homes do not apply to modular homes since modular homes are designed to have a permanent foundation.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Additionally, in the US, valuation differences between modular homes and site-built homes are often negligible in [[real estate appraisal]] practice; modular homes can, in some market areas, (depending on local appraisal practices per [[Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice]]) be evaluated the same way as site-built dwellings of similar quality. In Australia, manufactured home parks are governed by additional legislation that does not apply to permanent modular homes. Possible developments in equivalence between modular and site-built housing types for the purposes of [[real estate appraisal]]s, financing and zoning may increase the sales of modular homes over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modularhomesnetwork.com/building-codes/index.asp |title=Building Codes for Modular Homes |website=Modularhomesnetwork.com|accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building strength===
Modular homes are designed to be stronger than traditional homes by, for example, replacing nails with screws, adding glue to joints, and using 8-10% more lumber than conventional housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disruptive Development: Modular Manufacturing In Multifamily Housing|url=http://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/uploads/A.Stein_PR_Disruptive_Development_-_Modular_Manufacturing_in_Multifamily_Housing.pdf|accessdate=10 September 2017|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is to help the modules maintain their structural integrity as they are transported on trucks to the construction site; however, it is difficult to predict the final building strength since the modules need to endure transportation stresses that traditional homes never experience.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

The insulated concrete forms are modular units that are dry-stacked (without mortar) and filled with concrete. Insulating concrete forms has an acceptable ductility if used in high seismic risk zones.&lt;ref name=Asadi&gt;{{cite journal |last=Asadi |first=Pouria |date=March 2016 |title=Response modification factor due to ductility of screen-grid ICF wall system in high seismic risk zones |journal=KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering|issn=1226-7988 |doi=10.1007/s12205-016-0083-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When FEMA studied the destruction wrought by [[Hurricane Andrew]] in Dade County Florida, they concluded that modular and [[masonry]] homes fared best compared to other construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=2765|title=FIA 22, Mitigation Assessment Team Report: Hurricane Andrew in Florida (1993) |website=Fema.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CE marking===
The [[CE mark]] is a construction norm that guarantees the user of mechanical resistance and strength of the structure. It is a label given by [[European community]] empowered authorities for end-to-end process mastering and traceability.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

All manufacturing operations are being monitored and recorded:
* Suppliers have to be known and certified,
* Raw materials and goods being sourced are to be recorded by batch used,
* Elementary products are recorded and their quality is monitored,
* Assembly quality is managed and assessed on a step by step basis,

===Surfaces and finishes===
Modular buildings can be assembled on top of multiple foundation surfaces, such as a crawl space, stilts (for areas that are prone to flooding), full [[basement]]s or standard slab at grade. They can also be built to multi-story heights. [[Motels]] and other multi-family structures have been built using modular construction techniques. The height to which a modular structure can be built depends on jurisdiction, but a number of countries, especially in Asia, allow them to be built to 24 floors or more.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

Exterior wall surfaces can be finalized in the plant production process or in the case of brick/stone veneers, field applications may be the builders' choice. Roof systems also can be applied in the field after the basic installation is completed.

===U.S. regional differences with modular construction===
Weather, population density, geographical distances, and local housing architecture play a role in the use of modular construction for home building. Because modular construction is so adaptable, it has begun to permeate every region of the U.S.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

====Northeast====
The northeast is populated with factories that can combine modular housing design with other construction methods such as panelization and [[structural insulated panel|SIP]]s. Modules are typically limited to 16' width and up to 70' lengths because of the narrow road structure and densely populated areas of the region.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Other limitations are placed on transportation to locations such as Connecticut, Cape Cod, and Long Island.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

====Mid-Atlantic====
The Mid-Atlantic region is similar to the northeast, in terms of building design and transport restriction to modules to a width of not more than 16'.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

====Southeast====

Manufacturers in the Southeast often limit their ability to customize homes and focus on very traditional single story floor plans.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Much of the south is in coastal and high wind areas; modular construction may prove appealing in this area as it is already inherently stronger as it must be built for transport and craned installation, therefore offering wind resistance as good or higher than site-built construction.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

====Central Plains====
The central plains states typically are made up of farming and rural communities. Ranch homes are the mainstay of the region. Prone to strong storms and tornado conditions, modular construction offers the ability to better withstand these storm patterns than its site built counterpart.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} The inter-module attachments that must be made when assembling a modular home on a foundation offer an inherently stronger home than site built construction can offer.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Interior finishes on both the walls and ceilings are typically textured. Corners on interior walls are typically rounded and finish trim around windows is optional. Because of the wider road and lower population density, modules can be as wide as 20' and as long as 90'. The ability to provide larger modules reduces the amount of modules needed to complete a home.

====Rockies====
Home design in this area ranges from Chalet style homes to log cabin style homes. Manufacturers in the region therefore provide a number of styles of homes. Capability varies from factory to factory as well as the ability to do complete customization of floor plans. Transportation is limited mostly to 16' wide modules to travel the roads of the area.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

====West Coast====
The high cost of living in coastal areas, and especially California, may provide modular construction an edge due to its lower cost.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Extreme building regulation and environmental requirements can delay the start of residential construction.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Several factories specialize in environmentally responsible construction by following green construction standards and offering zero energy homes.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

Living in coastal areas also mean that the modular home structure should be strong enough to withstand winds with high velocity. Modular homes, built correctly, have such kind of resistance to stand high wind velocity without any damage issues.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

{{Party politics}}

A '''multi-party system''' is a system in which multiple political parties across the political spectrum run for national election, and all have the capacity to gain control of government offices, separately or in [[coalition government|coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://student.education2020.com/activities/vocab.aspx?keystr=12674&amp;order=02010205&amp;stbl=2196465 Education 2020] definition of '''multiparty''': ''"A system in which several major and many lesser parties exist, seriously compete for, and actually win public offices."''&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from [[Dominant-party system|one-party-dominant]] and [[Two-party system|two-party systems]], multi-party systems tend to be more common in [[parliamentary system]]s than [[presidential system]]s and far more common in countries that use [[proportional representation]] compared to countries that use [[first-past-the-post]] elections. 

First-past-the-post requires concentrated areas of support for large representation in the [[legislature]] whereas proportional representation better reflects the range of a population's views. Proportional systems may have [[Electoral district|multi-member districts]] with more than one representative elected from a given district to the same legislative body, and thus a greater number of viable parties. [[Duverger's law]] states that the number of viable political parties is one plus the number of seats in a district. 

[[Argentina]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Croatia]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Iceland]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Lebanon]], [[Maldives]], [[Mexico]], [[Moldova]], [[Nepal]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Spain]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Taiwan]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Ukraine]] are examples of nations that have used a multi-party system effectively in their democracies. In these countries, usually no single party has a parliamentary majority by itself. Instead, multiple political parties are compelled to form compromised [[coalition]]s for the purpose of developing power blocks and attaining legitimate [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]].

==Comparisons with other party systems==
[[File:Indian state governments led by various political parties.png|thumb|Indian state governments led by various political parties and coalitions]]
===One-party system and two-party system===
{{see also|one-party system|Two-party system}}
A system where only two parties have the possibility of winning an election is called two-party system. A system where only three parties have a ''realistic possibility'' of winning an election or forming a coalition is sometimes called a "Third-party system". But, in some cases the system is called a "Stalled Third-Party System," when there are three parties and all three parties win a large number of votes, but only two have a chance of winning an election. Usually this is because the electoral system penalises the third party, e.g. as in Canadian or UK politics. In the 2010 elections, the Liberal Democrats gained 23% of the total vote but won less than 10% of the seats due to the first-past-the-post electoral system. Despite this, they still had enough seats (and enough public support) to form coalitions with one of the two major parties, or to make deals in order to gain their support. An example is the [[Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition]] formed after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]]. Another is the [[Lib-Lab pact]] during Prime Minister [[James Callaghan]]'s Minority [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government; when Labour lost its three-seat majority in 1977, the pact fell short of a full coalition. In Canada, there are three major federal political parties; the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], and the [[New Democratic Party of Canada]]. However, the Liberals and Conservatives have been the only two parties to form government in Canada with the New Democrats as the third party, except in the [[2011 Canadian election]] when the New Democrats were the Official Opposition.

Unlike a [[One-party state|one-party system]] (or a two-party system), a multi-party system encourages the general [[constituency]] to form multiple distinct, officially recognized groups, generally called [[political party|political parties]]. Each party competes for votes from the [[suffrage|enfranchised]] constituents (those allowed to vote). A multi-party system prevents the leadership of a single party from controlling a single [[legislative]] chamber without challenge.

If the government includes an elected [[Congress]] or [[Parliament]], the parties may share power according to [[proportional representation]] or the [[first-past-the-post]] system. In proportional representation, each party wins a number of seats proportional to the number of votes it receives. In first-past-the-post, the electorate is divided into a number of districts, each of which selects one person to fill one seat by a [[plurality voting|plurality of the vote]]. First-past-the-post is not conducive to a proliferation of parties, and naturally gravitates toward a [[two-party system]], in which only two parties have a real chance of electing their candidates to office. This gravitation is known as [[Duverger's law]]. Proportional representation, on the other hand, does not have this tendency, and allows multiple major parties to arise. But, recent [[coalition]] governments, such as that in the U.K., represent two-party systems rather than multi-party systems. This is regardless of the number of parties in government.

A two-party system requires voters to align themselves in large blocs, sometimes so large that they cannot agree on any overarching principles. Some theories argue that this allows [[centrism|centrist]]s to gain control. On the other hand, if there are multiple major parties, each with less than a majority of the vote, the parties are strongly motivated to work together to form working governments. This also promotes centrism, as well as promoting coalition-building skills while discouraging polarization.&lt;ref&gt;The social science literature has contributed enormously in recent years on the effects on forms of government and quality of life of the citizens. Lowell’s axiom is one of the most tested theory empirically tested (Lowell, A.L., 1896). [https://www.academia.edu/29273929/Is_multi-party_coalition_government_better_for_the_protection_of_socially_backward_classes_in_India Governments and Parties in Continental Europe. Bostin, MA: Houghton Mifflin).&lt;/span&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basu, K., Dey Biswas, S., Harish, P., Dhar, S., &amp; Lahiri, M. (2016). Is multi-party coalition government better for the protection of socially backward classes in india? UN-WIDER Working Paper , 2016 (109).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6478">'''New Haven Legal Assistance Association, Inc.''' (LAA) is a [[nonprofit]] organization incorporated with funding from the [[Ford Foundation]] on April 7, 1964 to "secure justice for and to protect the rights of those residents of [[New Haven County]] unable to engage legal counsel."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  |publisher=New Haven Legal Assistance Association

  |title=About Us
}}&lt;/ref&gt; LAA provides free legal services in the fields of [[family law|child and family law]], [[employee benefits|benefits]], [[employment]], [[health law|health]], [[elder law|elder]], [[disabilities]], [[consumer protection|consumer]], [[housing]], and [[civil rights]] to eligible individuals and families in the greater [[New Haven]] area. It maintains partnerships with [[Yale Law School|Yale]] and [[Quinnipiac University School of Law|Quinnipiac Law Schools]].

==History==
In 1964, the year of the LAA’s founding, the [[American Bar Foundation]] estimated that some 1,400,000 indigents were tried each year without lawyers in the United States. Seeking a remedy, the government and private charitable organizations began to finance “neighborhood law offices” to accommodate the vast number of individuals requiring legal assistance.&lt;ref name=time&gt;

  |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]
  |date=November 12, 1965
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LAA, financed by the [[Ford Foundation]] in 1964, was one of the first legal services programs to be established.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nhlegal.org/about|title = History and Mission|website = New Haven Legal Assistance Association, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, 1964, it opened its first office. At the ceremony, Supreme Court Justice [[Arthur Goldberg]] lauded the opening as “the start of a new process – a process which will expand the rule of law to all segments of the population.”&lt;ref name=time/&gt; In 1965, when the federal government began funding legal services through the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]], LAA was used as a model for more than 300 programs that were opened around the country.

Throughout the 1960s, the LAA continued to expand in an effort to meet the overwhelming demand for its services. LAA added [[lawyer|attorney]]s (reaching a high of 30 lawyers) and opened additional neighborhood offices (for a total of seven). However, in the early 1970s, large government funding cuts forced the LAA to reduce its staff and number of neighborhood offices. Cuts continued in the early 1980s under the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration.

The mission of New Haven Legal Assistance Association, Inc. is to provide high-quality legal services to individuals and groups unable to obtain legal services because of limited income, age, disability, discrimination and other barriers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1983, the LAA moved into its current offices at Court and State Streets in [[New Haven]].

'''Oliver Hansen Langeland''' (30 January 1887 – 9 February 1958) was a Norwegian military officer and civil servant. He had careers in both civil service and the military, and is best known as leader of [[Milorg]] District 13 from 1942 to 1944.

==Pre-war life and career==
He was born in [[Eid, Norway|Eid in Nordfjord]] as a son of farmers Hans Langeland (1844–1928) and Kari Hildenes (1847–1939). In 1915 he married Susanne Andrea Augusta Harwig, daughter of a [[Methodist]] priest. He graduated as a petty officer in 1908, and advanced to the rank of first lieutenant in 1912, reaching the rank of captain in 1915. In 1929 he left the army. He also took the [[examen artium]] in 1910, and graduated from the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] with the [[cand.oecon.]] degree in economics in 1913.&lt;ref name=hvem48&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1948|title=Langeland, Oliver Hansen|encyclopedia=[[Hvem er hvem?]]|editor=Steenstrup, Bjørn|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|url=http://runeberg.org/hvemerhvem/1948/0310.html|page=310|language=Norwegian|accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=barth351&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Barth |editor-first=Bjarne Keyser |editor-link=Bjarne Keyser Barth |encyclopedia=Norges militære embedsmenn 1929 |title=Langeland, O.

Hanche |volume= |location=Oslo |id= |isbn= |doi= |page=351 |quote= |language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1915 to 1918 he lived in [[Saltdal]] where he ran a [[private school|private]] middle school. He then moved back to Kristiania and worked as an inspector and statistician in the city's tax authority. From 1929 he was a secretary in the municipal [[Resident registration|resident register]] and statistical officer.

In October 2005, the report focused on the detention of suspects in the [[War on Terror]], including those held in [[Guantánamo Bay]].  This particular Periodic Report is significant as the first official response of the U.S. government to allegations that prisoners are mistreated in Guantánamo Bay and in [[Afghanistan]]. The report denies those allegations. The report does not address detainees held by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].

A '''prisoner''', (also known as an '''inmate''' or '''detainee''') is a person who is deprived of liberty against his or her will. This can be by confinement, captivity, or by forcible restraint. The term applies particularly to serving a [[prison sentence]] in a [[prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prisoner |title=Prisoner - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term does not apply to [[Defendant#Criminal defendants|defendants]] who are [[pre-trial]].

==English law==
"Prisoner" is a legal term for a person who is [[Imprisonment|imprisoned]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Rastell]]. [[Termes de la Ley]]. 1636. Page 202. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nm5MAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA4-PA202-IA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Digital copy] from [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In section 1 of the [[Prison Security Act 1992]], the word "prisoner" means any person for the time being in a [[Prison#United Kingdom|prison]] as a result of any requirement imposed by a court or otherwise that he be detained in [[legal custody]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Prison Security Act 1992]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/25/section/1 section 1(6)]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Prisoner" was a legal term for a person prosecuted for [[felony]]. It was not applicable to a person prosecuted for [[misdemeanour]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Hood Phillips|O. Hood Phillips]]. A First Book of English Law. [[Sweet and Maxwell]]. Fourth Edition. 1960. Page 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The abolition of the distinction between felony and misdemeanour by section 1 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] has rendered this distinction obsolete.

Glanville Williams described as "invidious" the practice of using the term "prisoner" in reference to a person who had not been convicted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Glanville Williams]]. [[Learning the Law]]. Eleventh Edition. Stevens. 1982. Page 3, note 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Cornelis De Wael - To Visit the Imprisoned - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|230px|''To Visit the Imprisoned'' by Flemish artist [[Cornelis de Wael]] c. 1640]]
The earliest evidence of the existence of the prisoner dates back to 8,000 BC from prehistoric graves in [[Lower Egypt]]. This evidence suggests that people from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] enslaved a [[Bushmen|San]]-like tribe.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 Historical survey &gt; Slave-owning societies]". ''Encyclopædia Britannica.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh: ''The Slave Trade'' Simon and Schuster; Rockefeller Centre; New York, New York; 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological effects==
===In solitary confinement===
Among the most extreme adverse effects suffered by prisoners, appear to be caused by [[solitary confinement]] for long durations. When held in "Special Housing Units" (SHU), prisoners are subject to [[sensory deprivation]] and lack of social contact that can have a severe negative impact on their mental health.

Long durations may lead to depression and changes to brain physiology. In the absence of a social context that is needed to validate perceptions of their environment, prisoners become highly malleable, abnormally sensitive, and exhibit increased vulnerability to the influence of those controlling their environment. Social connection and the support provided from social interaction are prerequisite to long-term social adjustment as a prisoner.

Prisoners exhibit the paradoxical effect of social withdrawal after long periods of solitary confinement. A shift takes place from a craving for greater social contact, to a fear of it. They may grow lethargic and apathetic, and no longer be able to control their own conduct when released from solitary confinement. They can come to depend upon the prison structure to control and limit their conduct.

Long-term stays in solitary confinement can cause prisoners to develop clinical depression, and long-term impulse control disorder. Those with pre-existing mental illnesses are at a higher risk for developing psychiatric symptoms. Some common behaviours are self-mutilation, suicidal tendencies, and psychosis.

A psychopathological condition identified as "SHU syndrome" has been observed among such prisoners. Symptoms are characterized as problems with concentration and memory, distortions of perception, and hallucinations. Most convicts suffering from SHU syndrome exhibit extreme generalized anxiety and panic disorder, with some suffering amnesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ijo.sagepub.com/content/52/6/622 |author=Bruce A. Arrigo, Jennifer Leslie Bullock |date= November 2007 |title=The Psychological Effects of Solitary Confinement on Prisoners in Supermax Units| journal= International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology|doi=10.1177/0306624X07309720|volume=52|issue=6|page=622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stockholm syndrome===
The psychological syndrome known as [[Stockholm syndrome]], describes a paradoxical phenomenon where, over time, hostages develop positive feelings towards their captors.

==Inmate culture==
The founding of ethnographic prison sociology as a discipline, from which most of the meaningful knowledge of prison life and culture stems, is commonly credited to the publication of two key texts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simon|first=Jonathan|title=The `Society of Captives' in the Era of Hyper-Incarceration|journal=Theoretical Criminology|date=1 August 2000|volume=4|issue=3|doi=10.1177/1362480600004003003|page=287}} {{cite journal |last=Crewe|first=Ben|title=Male prisoners’ orientations towards female officers in an English prison|journal=[[Punishment &amp; Society]]|year=2006|volume=8|issue=4|pages=395–421|doi=10.1177/1462474506067565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Clemmer's ''The Prison Community'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clemmer|first=Donald|title=The Prison Community|year=1940|publisher=Holt, Rhineheart and Winston|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was first published in 1940 and republished in 1958; and Gresham Sykes classic study ''The Society of Captives'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sykes|first=Gresham M.|title=The Society of Captives: A Study of a Maximum Security Prison|year=1958|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_YjooNYRMQQC|isbn=0691130647}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was also published in 1958. Clemmer's text, based on his study of 2,400 convicts over three years at the Menard Branch of the Illinois State Penitentiary where he worked as a clinical sociologist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clemmer|first=Donald|title=Leadership Phenomena in a Prison Community|journal=[[Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology]]|date=Mar–Apr 1938|volume=28|issue=6|page=861 n. 1|doi=10.2307/1136755|jstor=1136755}}&lt;/ref&gt; propagated the notion of the existence of a distinct inmate culture and society with values and norms antithetical to both the prison authority and the wider society.
[[File:The Bashful Model.jpg|thumb|right|230px|A scene in [[Newgate Prison]], London]]

In this world, for Clemmer, these values, formalized as the "inmate code", provided behavioural precepts that unified prisoners and fostered antagonism to prison officers and the prison institution as a whole. The process whereby inmates acquired this set of values and behavioural guidelines as they adapted to prison life he termed "prisonization", which he defined as the "taking on, in greater or lesser degree, the folkways, mores, customs and general culture of the penitentiary'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=DeRosia|first=Victoria R.|title=Living Inside Prison Walls: Adjustment Behavior|year=1998|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-275-95895-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5-m-b-IgbM4C&amp;pg=PA23|edition=1. publ.|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Clemmer argued that all prisoners experienced some degree of prisonization this was not a uniform process and factors such as the extent to which a prisoner involved himself in primary group relations in the prison and the degree to which he identified with the external society all had a considerable impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faine|first=John R.|title=A self-consistency approach to prisonization|journal=Sociological Quarterly|date=Autumn 1973|volume=14|issue=4|page=576|doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1973.tb01392.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prisonization as the inculcation of a convict culture was defined by identification with primary groups in prison, the use of prison slang and argot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pollack|first=Joycelyn M.|title=Prisons: Today and Tomorrow|year=2006|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers Inc.|location=Ontario|isbn=0-7637-2904-3|pages=95–96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LsQtASGLeZUC&amp;pg=PA95}}&lt;/ref&gt; the adoption of specified rituals and a hostility to prison authority in contrast to inmate solidarity and was asserted by Clemmer to create individuals who were acculturated into a criminal and deviant way of life that stymied all attempts to reform their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bright|first=Charles|title=The Powers that Punish : Prison and Politics in the Era of the "Big House," 1920-2009|year=1996|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Ann Arbor|isbn=0-472-10732-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9c2qHtsxUYC&amp;pg=PA6|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposed to these theories, several European sociologists&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Mathiesen]], T. (1965) The Defences of the Weak: a Study of Norwegian Correctional Institution, London: Tavistock&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that inmates were often fragmented and the links they have with society are often stronger than those forged in prison, particularly through the action of work on time perception&lt;ref&gt;Guilbaud, Fabrice (2010) "Working in Prison: Time as Experienced by Inmate-Workers", ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/i40033161]'' '''51'''-Annual English Selection-Supplement, p. 41-68&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convict code===
[[File:Inmates Orleans Parish Prison.jpg|thumb|Inmates in a prison yard]]
The convict code was theorized as a set of tacit behavioural norms which exercised a pervasive impact on the conduct of prisoners. Competency in following the routines demanded by the code partly determined the inmate’s identity as a convict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Watson|first1=Rod|last2=Sharrock|first2=Wes|title=Conversational actions and organizational actions|volume=8|issue=2|year=1990|page=26|url=http://www.persee.fr/articleAsPDF/reso_0984-5372_1990_hos_8_2_3547/article_reso_0984-5372_1990_hos_8_2_3547.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a set of values and behavioural guidelines, the convict code referred to the behaviour of inmates in antagonising staff members and to the mutual solidarity between inmates as well as the tendency to the non-disclosure to prison authorities of prisoner activities and to resistance to rehabilitation programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brannigan|first=Augustine|title=Review: D. Lawrence Wieder, ''Language and Social Reality: The Case of Telling the Convict Code''|journal=Contemporary Sociology|volume=5|issue=3|date=May 1976|page=349|doi=10.2307/2064132|jstor=2064132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it was seen as providing an expression and form of communal resistance and allowed for the psychological survival of the individual under extremely repressive and regimented systems of carceral control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Colvin|first=Mark|title=Review: David Ward. ''Alcatraz: The Gangster Years''|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=115|issue=1|date=February 2010|page=247|doi=10.1086/ahr.115.1.246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Punishment of the Paddle, 1912.jpg|thumb|230px|1912 illustration of an inmate being punished in an American prison]]
Both federal and state laws govern the rights of prisoners. Prisoners in the United States do not have full rights under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], however, they are protected by [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Amendment VIII]] which prohibits [[cruel and unusual punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/prisoners_rights |title=Prisoners' rights &amp;#124; LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=Topics.law.cornell.edu |date=2012-03-02 |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing research associates education with a number of positive outcomes for prisoners, the institution, and society. Although at the time of the ban’s enactment there was limited knowledge about the relationship between education and recidivism, there is growing merit to idea that education in prison is a preventative to re-incarceration. Several studies help illustrate the point. For example, one study in 1997 that focused on 3,200 prisoners in Maryland, Minnesota, and Ohio, showed that simply attending school behind bars reduced the likelihood of re-incarceration by 29 percent. In 2000, the Texas Department of Education conducted a longitudinal study of 883 men and women who earned college degrees while incarcerated, finding recidivism rates between 27.2 percent (completion of an AA degree) and 7.8 percent (completion of a BA degree), compared to a system-wide recidivism rate between 40 and 43 percent.10 One report, sponsored by the Correctional Education Association, focused on recidivism in three states, concluding that education prevented crime. More recently, a 2013 Department of Justice funded study from the RAND Corporation found that incarcerated individuals who participated in correctional education were 43% less likely to return to prison within 3 years than prisoners who did not participate in such programs. The research implies that education has the potential to impact recidivism rates positively by lowering them.&lt;ref&gt;SpearIt, Restoring Pell Grants for Prisoners- Growing Momentum for Reform http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2814358&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
*[[Civilian internee]]s are [[civilians]] who are detained by a party to a [[war]] for security reasons. They can either be friendly, neutral, or enemy nationals.
*[[Convicts]] are prisoners that are incarcerated under the legal system. In the [[United States]], a [[federal inmate]] is a person convicted of violating [[Law of the United States#Federal law|federal law]], who is then incarcerated at a federal prison that exclusively houses similar criminals. The term most often applies to those convicted of a [[felony]].
*[[Detainees]] is a frequent term used by certain governments to refer to individuals who are held in custody and are not liable to be classified and treated under the law as either [[prisoners of war]] or [[suspect]]s in [[criminal]] cases. It is generally defined with the broad definition: "someone held in custody".
*[[Hostage]]s are historically defined as prisoners held as security for the fulfillment of an agreement, or as a deterrent against an act of war. In modern times, it refers to someone who is seized by a criminal abductor.
*[[Prisoners of war]], also known as a POWs, are individuals incarcerated in relation to [[wars]]. They can be either [[civilian]]s affiliated with [[combatants]], or combatants acting within the bounds of the [[laws and customs of war]].
*[[Political prisoner]]s describe those imprisoned for participation or connection to political activity. Such inmates challenge the legitimacy of the detention.
*[[Slaves]] are prisoners that are held captive for their use as labourers. Various methods have been used throughout history to deprive slaves of their liberty, including forcible restraint.
*[[Prisoner of conscience]] are anyone imprisoned because of their [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sexual orientation]], religion, or political views.

Other types of prisoners can include those under police [[arrest]], [[house arrest]], those in [[psychiatric institution]]s, [[internment camp]]s, and peoples restricted to a specific area such as Jews in the [[Warsaw ghetto]].

'''Restore the Fourth''' is an American 501(c)(4) nonprofit that seeks to strengthen the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and end programs that violate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Restore The Fourth FAQ|url=http://restorethe4th.com/faq/|accessdate=2014-06-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140604145757/http://restorethe4th.com/faq/|archivedate=2014-06-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffPost1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/28/restore-the-fourth_n_3519600.html/|title= Restore The Fourth: Group Organizes Nationwide Anti-NSA Spying Protests On July 4|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It organized protests in 2013 and 2014, and in 2015 helped to introduce the Surveillance State Repeal Act, besides other lobbying activities.

==History==
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:NYC Restore The Fourth July 4th.jpg|Restore the Fourth NYC
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Restore the Fourth originated on the [[social media]] website [[reddit]] shortly after the information leak by [[Edward Snowden]], which detailed the US [[National Security Agency]]'s (NSA) [[mass surveillance]] programs, most notably the [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]]. A subforum (known on reddit as a ''subreddit'') dedicated to the movement was created on June 8, 2013, garnering over 15,000 subscribers in 2 weeks.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} From there, Restore the Fourth moved to Snoonet, an [[IRC]] network for reddit communities. Most organization prior to July 4, 2013 occurred there, where local organizers, national organizers, and users from the subreddit collaborated.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The first Restore the Fourth protest occurred on June 30, 2013, in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. Subsequent [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] protests occurred on July 4 with more than 70 local rallies across all 50 [[U.S. state]]s and [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.restorethefourth.net/protests/ Restore the Fourth Protests]&lt;/ref&gt;

Further rallies were held to mark Orwell Day (August 4), to push for the passage of the [[USA Freedom Act]] (October 26), and to call for the shutting down of the growing network of [[fusion centers]] across the United States (April 10).{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} During November 2013 - April 2014, the organization saw a period of significant turnover, before relaunching with national elections in May 2014 as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit with 25 chapters around the country, under the leadership of Alex Marthews.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Stated goals==
According to Restore The Fourth's legislative platform, the organization seeks to:

*Restore reliance on warrants based on individualized probable cause.
*Impose penalties on agencies and agents who conduct surveillance not meeting this standard.
*Pass legislation limiting the [[Third-Party Doctrine]], improving government transparency, and preventing end-runs around the Fourth Amendment by using foreign partner agencies or contractors.

==Responses==
Restore the Fourth has received support from the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/07/restore-fourth-campaign-organizes-protests-against-unconstitutional-surveillance|title=Restore the Fourth Campaign Organizes Protests Against Unconstitutional Surveillance|work=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|date=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sen.

The NSA addressed the July 4 protest in a statement, saying: 
"The Fourth of July reminds us as Americans of the freedoms and rights all citizens of our country are guaranteed by our Constitution. Among those is freedom of speech, often exercised in protests of various kinds.  NSA does not object to any lawful, peaceful protest."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Filed in 1970, the lawsuit was settled in 1976 and resulted in the free agency rules now used in the NBA.&lt;ref name=robertson&gt;{{Bluebook website|first=Oscar |last=Robertson |title=N.B.A. Should Honor Its History and Learn From It |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://nyti.ms/2x8Qd3S |date=December 24, 2011 |access-date=June 20, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
Robertson sought through his lawsuit to block any merger of the NBA with the [[American Basketball Association]], to end the option clause that bound a player to a single NBA team [[reserve clause|in perpetuity]], to end the [[NBA Draft|NBA's college draft]] binding a player to one team, and to end restrictions on free agent signings. The suit also sought damages for NBA players for past harm caused by the option clause.

Robertson's lawsuit prevented the planned 1970 merger of the [[National Basketball Association]] with the [[American Basketball Association]].

==Judgment==
The court issued an injunction against any merger. The [[ABA-NBA merger]] was thus delayed until 1976.

{{expand section|date=April 2013}}

==Significance==
In 1972, [[United States Congress|Congress]] came close to enacting legislation to enable a merger but the measure was not passed. As a result, the two leagues did not merge until 1976.

Although he wasn't playing anymore, Robertson was not out of sight. As president of the NBA players union, [[Oscar Robertson]]'s 1970 suit against the NBA contended the draft, option clause and other rules restricting player movement were violations of [[antitrust laws]]. The suit was settled in 1976, when the league agreed to let players become [[free agent]]s in exchange for their old team's "right of first refusal" to match any offer they might receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website|first=Ron |last=Flatter |title=Oscar defined the triple-double |publisher=ESPN |url=http://www.espn.com/sportscentury/features/00016428.html |date= |access-date=June 20, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4831">{{Criminal defenses}} 
In the [[United States]], '''self-defense''' is an [[affirmative defense]] that is used to [[Justification (jurisprudence)|justify]] the use of force by one person against another person under specific circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;For the rationale of Self-defense, see: Boaz Sangero, Self-Defence in Criminal Law 11 - 106 (Hart Publishing, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==General rule==
In the U.S., the general rule is that "&lt;nowiki&gt;[a]&lt;/nowiki&gt; person is privileged to use such force as '''''reasonably''''' appears necessary to defend him or herself against an apparent threat of '''''unlawful''''' and '''''immediate''''' violence from another."&lt;ref&gt;{{Smallcaps|George E. Dix}}, {{Smallcaps|Gilbert Law Summaries: Criminal Law}} xxxiii (18th ed. 2010) (original emphasis); ''see generally'' {{Smallcaps|David C. Brody &amp; James R. Acker}}, {{Smallcaps|Criminal Law}} 130 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; In cases involving non-deadly force, this means that the person must reasonably believe that their use of force was necessary to prevent imminent, unlawful physical harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smallcaps|Brody}}, at 130; {{Smallcaps|Dix}}, at xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; When the use of [[deadly force]] is involved in a self-defense claim, the person must also reasonably believe that their use of deadly force is immediately necessary to prevent the other's infliction of great bodily harm or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smallcaps|Brody}}, at 137; {{Smallcaps|Dix}}, at xxiii; {{Smallcaps|Raneta Lawson Mack}}, {{Smallcaps|A Layperson's Guide to Criminal Law}} 141 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Most states no longer require a person to [[duty to retreat|retreat]] before using deadly force. In the minority of jurisdictions which do require retreat, there is no obligation to retreat when it is unsafe to do so or when one is inside one's own home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smallcaps|Dix}}, at xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exceptions, limitations, and imperfect defense===
A person who was the initial aggressor cannot claim self-defense as a justification unless they abandon the combat or the other party has responded with excessive force.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12233090126446728563&amp;q=%22483+F.2d+1222%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 United States v. Peterson]'', 483 F.2d 1222, 1231 (D.C. Cir. 1973); {{Smallcaps|Dix}}, at xxiv; {{Smallcaps|Mack}}, at 143-44.&lt;/ref&gt; If the aggressor has abandoned the combat, they normally must attempt to communicate that abandonment to the other party.&lt;ref&gt;''Peterson'', at 1231; {{Smallcaps|Dix}}, at xxiv; {{Smallcaps|Mack}}, at 143-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, one could resist an unlawful arrest and claim self-defense, however the modern trend is to move away from that rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smallcaps|Brody}}, at 148; {{Smallcaps|Dix}}, at xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; In most jurisdictions allowing a person to resist an unlawful arrest, the state requires that the unlawful arrest be accompanied by excessive force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smallcaps|Dix}}, at xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; The older view is represented by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Bad Elk v. United States]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13577773471272070940&amp;q=%22177+U.S.+529%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 Bad Elk v. United States]'', 177 U.S. 529 (1900).&lt;/ref&gt; where an off-duty [[Sioux]] police officer was granted a new trial after being convicted of killing an on-duty police officer who was attempting to illegally arrest the man, because, at the initial trial, the jury was not instructed that it could convict on a lesser offense, such as manslaughter.

In some jurisdictions, there is an [[imperfect self-defense]] rule, where an individual who mistakenly believes that he was justified in using deadly force in self-defense, but is not legally justified, may have a [[murder]] conviction reduced to a [[manslaughter]] conviction instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smallcaps|Dix}}, at xxiv; {{Smallcaps|Mack}}, at 142-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retreat===
{{Main|Duty to retreat}} {{See also|Stand your ground|Castle doctrine}}
A majority of U.S. jurisdictions do not follow the [[common law]] rule that a person must retreat prior to using deadly force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smallcaps|Brody}}, at 139; {{Smallcaps|Dix}}, at 135 &lt;/ref&gt; Whether the person retreated may, however, be relevant as to the reasonableness of the use of deadly force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smallcaps|Dix}}, at 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the common law rule and the rule in a minority of states, the actor must have shown that he or she retreated prior to using deadly force unless: 1) it was not safe to retreat; or 2) the incident occurred at the actor's home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smallcaps|Dix}}, at 134.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Model Penal Code]] requires retreat or compliance, if it can be done with complete safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smallcaps|Dix}}, at 134-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8514">The '''silent witness rule''' is the use of "substitutions" when referring to sensitive information in the United States open courtroom jury trial system. The phrase was first used in US v. Zettl, in 1987.&lt;ref name=fourpart/&gt; An example of a substitution method is the use of code-words on a "key card", to which witnesses and the jury would refer during the trial, but which the public would not have access to. The rule is an [[rules of evidence|evidentiary doctrine]] that tries to balance the [[state secrets privilege]] with the [[bill of rights]] (especially the right of the accused to a [[public trial]], and the right to [[due process]]). In practice the rule has been rarely used and often challenged by judges and civil rights advocates. Its use remains controversial.&lt;ref name=lamb1/&gt;

== Background ==

The conflict between the open court and [[state secrets privilege]] goes back to at least 1802 and [[Marbury v. Madison]]. Under the privilege, the government can dismiss any charges against it by claiming that important state secrets would be revealed at trial. In 1980 the [[Classified Information Procedures Act]] (CIPA) was passed as an attempt to deal with the conflict, especially the problem of [[graymail]]. The Silent Witness Rule (SWR) is a further attempt.&lt;ref name=lamb1/&gt;

By 2011 the government had only attempted to use the rule a handful of times, often unsuccessfully:&lt;ref name=lamb1/&gt;

The Fourth Circuit later ruled this unconstitutional, a violation of the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|6th Amendment]]'s [[Confrontation Clause]].&lt;ref name=liugar/&gt;

=== United States v. Rosen ===

In [[United States v. Rosen]], in 2007 (the AIPAC Espionage Act case), the rule was used for the first real time. The government tried to use the rule extensively at first; the court rejected the idea.&lt;ref name=lamb1/&gt;

Rosen argued that the rule was invalid because he felt it did not match CIPA requirements, and that the government had said CIPA was the only way to deal with classified information at a trial. The judge for the trial, [[T. S. Ellis III]], disagreed that CIPA was the only acceptable way to deal with classified information. He also felt the SWR was not really part of CIPA either.&lt;ref name=lamb1/&gt;

Ellis created a four-part "fairness test" to decide whether the SWR was fair. His test was a combination of the CIPA fairness test and the [[Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court]] fairness test. Ellis' theory was based on the idea that the SWR effectively "closes a trial" from the public by disclosing different sets of evidence to the court and to the public. The four parts of his test were as follows:&lt;ref name=lamb1/&gt;

*There must be an overriding reason to close the trial
*The closure must be "no broader than necessary"
*There must be no alternatives
*The SWR must "provid[e] defendants with substantially the same ability to make their defense as full public disclosure of the evidence" would.

[[T. S. Ellis III|Judge Ellis]] decided that the Rosen case met the fairness test, and approved use of the SWR at trial. It was used for 4 minutes 6 seconds of playback of a conversation. However, Ellis sealed (kept secret) the exact way that the SWR figured into the proceedings.&lt;ref name=lamb1/&gt;

== Arguments ==

Lamb argues that the SWR would enable trials to go ahead that would otherwise be dismissed because of [[state secrets privilege]]. He especially points out [[El-Masri v. Tenet]], in which a German citizen was allegedly kidnapped and raped by CIA agents but was never allowed to present his case in court, and [[United States v. Reynolds]], in which widows of Air Force contractors sued the government; both cases were dismissed because the government claimed the trial would reveal national secrets.&lt;ref name=lamb1/&gt;

The rule has received media coverage for its suggested use by the government in [[United States v. Drake]] (2010). Bishop, in the Baltimore Sun, writes that lawyers say the "secret codes quickly become confusing and risk violating the defendant's constitutional rights to a public trial."&lt;ref name=bish1/&gt; [[Jesselyn Radack]] of the Government Accountability Project called it an "oxymoron," and pointed out that it "would still allow jurors to see classified information, defeating the whole purpose of classification".&lt;ref name=rad1/&gt; Josh Gerstein at Politico wrote that it might create conflict between the prosecution and the news media.&lt;ref name=ger1/&gt;

The '''Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act of 2017''' (H.R. 1616) is a bill introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] by U.S. Representative [[John Ratcliffe (American politician)|John Ratcliffe]] (R-Texas). The bill would amend the [[Homeland Security Act of 2002]] to authorize the National Computer Forensics Institute, with the intent of providing local and state officials with resources to better handle cybercrime threats.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gaetz.house.gov/hr-1616-strengthening-state-and-local-cyber-crime-fighting-act-2017|title=H.R. 1616 - Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act of 2017|date=2017-05-16|work=Congressman Matt Gaetz|access-date=2017-07-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratcliffe serves as the current chairman of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fifthdomain.com/2017/05/17/house-passes-bill-to-boost-local-cybercrime-fighting/|title=House passes bill to boost local cyber crime-fighting|last=Ware|first=Tony|date=2017-05-17|website=Fifth Domain {{!}} Cyber|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was passed by the House with a roll call vote of 408-3 after forty minutes of debate. Between its introduction and approval, the bill was referred to the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Committee on the Judiciary]], the [[United States House Committee on Homeland Security|Committee on Homeland Security]], the Subcommittee on Transportation and Protective Security, and the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1616?r=9|title=Summary - H.R.1616 - Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act of 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=Congress.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill has a total of 18 cosponsors, including 17 Republicans and one Democrat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.popvox.com/us/federal/bills/115/hr1616|title=H.R. 1616 Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act of 2017|website=www.popvox.com|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratcliffe introduced the bill because he believes that local and state level law enforcement entities should be better equipped to handle emerging cyber threats in order to protect communities. He expressed concern that in today's world, traditional evidence of crimes, like DNA samples, might not be enough to solve cases, because criminals are more frequently breaking the law and leaving behind traces on the internet. In March 2017, Ratcliffe said, "Cyber elements add layers of complexity to the crimes our local law enforcement officers face every day ‒ and we've got to make sure they have access to the training they need to address this trend."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ratcliffe.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/ratcliffe-introduces-bill-empower-police-combat-cybercrime-1|title=Ratcliffe introduces bill to empower police to combat cybercrime|date=2017-03-17|work=Congressman John Ratcliffe|access-date=2017-07-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2017, the Senate has not yet considered the bill,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/stories/22573-house-advances-legislation-address-terror-threats-improve-national-security/|title=House advances legislation to address terror threats, improve national security|last=|first=|date=2017-05-25|work=Homeland Preparedness News|access-date=2017-07-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Senators [[Chuck Grassley]] (R-Iowa), [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D-California), [[Richard Shelby]] (R-Alabama), [[Sheldon Whitehouse]] (D-Rhode Island), and [[Luther Strange]] (R-Alabama) introduced a companion bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.executivegov.com/2017/05/house-passes-bill-to-provide-cyber-tools-training-for-state-local-law-enforcement/|title=House Passes Bill to Provide Cyber Tools, Training for State &amp; Local Law Enforcement - Executive Gov|work=Executive Gov|access-date=2017-07-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator Grassley, current [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] Chairman, supported the role of the National Computer Forensics Institute and the purpose of Ratcliffe's bill, saying the center gives officials the capacity to "dust for 'digital fingerprints' and utilize forensics to gather evidence and solve cases."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Seal of the United States Department of Homeland Security.svg|alt=seal of the united states department of homeland security|thumb|Seal of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]]]
As the internet has grown increasingly dominant in communications, business, and daily life, [[cybercrime]] has become a more dangerous threat to privacy and safety of both public and private entities. Americans recognize this issue, as they identified cyberattacks as the second most concerning global threat to the nation in a May 2016 survey conducted by Pew Research.

The federal government has fallen victim to cyber attacks numerous times, especially in recent years. A 2016 report from the [[Government Accountability Office]] that included a survey of two dozen federal agencies found that cyberattacks exploded in frequency by 1,300 percent over the course of a decade, with 5,500 in 2006 to as many as 77,000 in 2015. The report listed eighteen of the agencies as operators of "high-impact systems", meaning that leaks could cause "catastrophic harm" to particular individuals, the government, or the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/06/22/Cyberattacks-Against-US-Government-1300-2006|title=Cyberattacks Against the US Government Up 1,300% Since 2006|website=The Fiscal Times|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, hackers accessed tax returns of over 300,000 people during an attack on the [[Internal Revenue Service]], which led to the distribution of over $50 million in fraudulent refunds. Since 2007, federal agencies have dealt with at least a dozen attacks on their systems. Social Security information, home addresses, health records, and other personal data has been stolen from millions of people, including elected officials.&lt;ref name="Hernandez"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2015/08/18/usg-cyberattacks/|title=All the cyberattacks on the U.S. government (that we know of)|last=Hernandez|first=Sergio|website=Mashable|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hackers from foreign countries have played a significant role in cyber attacks against the United States. All seventeen agencies that make up the [[United States Intelligence Community|United States intelligence community]] agreed that Russian hackers were behind an infiltration of the [[Democratic National Committee]]'s data during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/10/21/17-intelligence-agencies-russia-behind-hacking/92514592/|title=Yes, 17 intelligence agencies really did say Russia was behind hacking|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-07-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''NBC News'' obtained a document from the [[National Security Agency]] that detailed a five-year period of Chinese hacking of government information, which ended in 2014.&lt;ref name="Hernandez"/&gt;

Private groups and businesses have also been damaged by cybercrime. Cyberattacks cost American companies more than $15 million per year. The United States loses 500,000 jobs on an annual basis due to cyberattacks. More than 50 percent of all cyberattacks are launched against American companies, leading to a loss of $100 billion in the economy each year. A [[Citibank]] ATM server attack in 2008 lead to the loss of $2 million, and a [[2014 Sony Pictures computer hacking incident|Sony hack in 2014]] lead to the loss of $15 million. In 2014 alone, 44% of all small businesses in the United States were attacked, which resulted in affected companies losing an average of $8,700 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/content-tracks/security-risk/infographic-the-cost-of-cyber-attacks-in-the-us/96087.fullarticle|title=Infographic: The cost of cyber attacks in the US|work=DatacenterDynamics|access-date=2017-07-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratcliffe and supporters of the bill aim to better equip all levels of the government to handle the increasing cyber threats that challenge both the government and American businesses and private citizens. U.S. Representative [[Dan Donovan (politician)|Dan Donovan]] (R-NY), who voted in favor of the bill, said, "It's critical that our law enforcement agencies have the information and training they need to respond to threats. This legislation will help increase coordination between the brave men and women who defend us on the local, state, and federal level and ensure that they have the tools needed to protect the homeland."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The National Computer Forensics Institute has proven vital in this effort, having already worked with over 6,250 officials coming from all 50 states and even three United States territories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Representative [[Bob Goodlatte]] (R-VA), House Judiciary Committee chairman, said the NCFI would benefit from a clear congressional mandate. "Authorizing the existing National Computer Forensics Institute in federal law will cement its position as our nation's premier hi-tech cyber crime training facility."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/255504-house-committee-oks-bill-to-help-states-fight-cyber-crime|title=House committee OKs bill to help states fight cyber crime|last=Bennett|first=Cory|date=2015-09-30|work=TheHill|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major provisions ==
The objective of the bill is to authorize the National Computer Forensics Institute so that the center can "disseminate homeland security information related to the investigation and prevention of cyber and electronic crime and related threats, and educate, train, and equip State, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges." The bill aims to achieve this through amending the Homeland Security Act of 2002.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

While the National Computer Forensics Institute, based in [[Hoover, Alabama]], has been open since 2008, the bill would ensure proper oversight and accountability, solidifying the center's position as the optimal site for training law enforcement to mitigate cyber threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr1616/summary|title=Summary of H.R. 1616: Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act of 2017 - GovTrack.us|website=GovTrack.us|language=en|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill establishes that the operations of the National Computer Forensics Institute are to:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Educate law enforcement officers at all levels of government, including local, state, territorial, and tribal forces on threats related to cybercrime.
* Instruct law enforcement personnel, about proper investigation methods, device examination techniques, and potential prosecutorial and judicial challenges. 
* Train law enforcement officers to carry out investigations and respond in a necessary manner to reported incidents of cybercrime.
* Facilitate the sharing of information between State, local, tribal and territorial officers and prosecutors.
* Provide materials like hardware, software, manuals, tools, and other items to law enforcement to conduct investigations.
* Expand the Electronic Crime Task Forces of the [[United States Secret Service]] through continuous training of officers. 
The NCFI would continue to be operated by the U.S. Secret Service, within the Department of Homeland Security. The network of Electronic Crime Task Forces would include stakeholders from academic institutions and the private sector under the expansion sanctioned by the authorization of the NCFI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.countable.us/bills/hr1616-115-strengthening-state-and-local-cyber-crime-fighting-act-of-2017|title=H.R. 1616 - "Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act of 2017"|last=|first=|date=|website=Countable|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislative history ==
During the 114th Congress, an earlier version of the bill was passed in the U.S. House on November 30, 2015. On December 1, 2015, the bill was received in the Senate and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. No further action was taken.

On March 17, 2017, Ratcliffe introduced the bill in the House.

The '''''Milan Charter'''''&lt;ref&gt;http://carta.milano.it/en/&lt;/ref&gt; is a document that sets out the principles and objectives on the subject of [[nutrition]], [[environmental sustainability]] and [[human rights]].

It was proposed at [[Expo 2015]] during the [[Milan]] [[Universal Exposition]] (1 May - 31 October 2015), and on 16 October 2015 it was presented to the Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN) [[Ban Ki-moon]].

The "charter"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.expo2015.org/en/news/the-milan-charter--expo-milano-2015-s-legacy--a-duty-shared&lt;/ref&gt; indicates who signed firm commitments regarding the right to food that is one of the fundamental human rights enshrined in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Lack of access to healthy food, sufficient and nutritious food, clean water and energy, is considered a violation of human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;http://webtv.un.org/watch/food-security-in-the-post-2015-agenda-the-milan-charter-in-the-context-of-the-new-global-partnership-for-sustainable-development/4512075051001&lt;/ref&gt;

The collective action of citizens, together with civil society, businesses and local, national and international is considered one of the prerequisites to win the major challenges related to food.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/webcast/pdfs/150926pm-milancharter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Fight malnutrition and malnutrition, promote equitable access to natural resources, the sustainable management of production processes, represent the commitment that the underwriters of the Charter of Milan&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu/expo2015/it/node/145&lt;/ref&gt;  undertake to support.

'''''Tomson v. Ward''''' [[Case citation|1 N.H. 9 (1816)]] was the first [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]] decision recorded in the official New Hampshire [[Law reporter|reports]].

==Ruling==
In the case the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled that "[a]n unrecorded [[deed]] of lands voluntarily given up, and cancelled by the parties to it, with intent to [[revest]] the estate in the grantor, as between them and as to all subsequent claimants under them, operates as a [[reconveyance]], and revests the estate in the [[Conveyancing#United States|grantor]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Thomson v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4131">The '''Transfers of Undertakings Directive''' [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0023:EN:HTML 2001/23/EC] is a [[European Union law]] that protects the contracts of employment of people working in businesses that are transferred between owners.&lt;ref&gt;Its long title is the Directive of 12 March 2001 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses.&lt;/ref&gt; It replaced and updated the law previously known as the Acquired Rights Directive 77/187/EC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31977L0187:EN:NOT Council Directive 77/187/EEC of 14 February 1977 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Directive stipulates that any employee's contract of employment will be transferred automatically on the same terms as before in the event of a transfer of the undertaking. This means that if an employer changes control of the business, the new employer cannot reduce the employees' terms and conditions, unless the Directive's exception criteria are met. This is that there must be a good economic, technical or organisational reason for the change.

;Chapter I - Scope and definitions&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/employment_and_social_policy/employment_rights_and_work_organisation/c11330_en.htm Summaries of EU legislation &gt; Employment and social policy &gt; Employment rights and work organisation &gt; Summary of Directive 2001/23/EC]&lt;/ref&gt;
Article 1
This says the directive applies to legal transfers and mergers of an undertaking. The point to note is that it excludes transfers of company control through a simple purchase of [[share (finance)|share]]s, which is the most common way to effect a change in the [[market for corporate control]].

Article 2
This gives definitions of transferor, transferee and the like.

;Chapter II - Safeguarding of employees' rights
Article 3
This states the principle that the transferee is bound to the contractual and [[employment law]] obligations of the transferor. The transferor has to state what these are beforehand.

Article 4
This provides the idea that dismissals should not take place just because there is a transfer. But dismissals can be made for 'any economic, technical and organisational reason'.

Article 5
Member states can derogate from Art. 3 and 4 where the company is [[insolvent]].

Article 6
This states that employee representatives positions should not change where the undertaking retains autonomy through the transfer. It is talking mainly about [[Trade union|union]]s.

;Chapter III - Information and consultation
Article 7
This provides that employers thinking of transfers must consult with the workforce beforehand, through employee representatives.

;Chapter IV - Final provisions
Article 8-14
These articles are addressed to the Member States, and talk about implementation maps, and notifications to the Commission of opinions or changes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4235">'''Uniform Investment Adviser Law Examination''', also called the '''Series 65''' exam, is a test taken by individuals in the United States who seek to become licensed [[investment adviser]] representatives. The exam covers topics necessary to provide [[investment advisory|investment advice]] to clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = FINRA Registration and Examination Requirement
 | publisher = Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
 | url = http://www.finra.org/industry/compliance/registration/qualificationsexams/qualifications/p011051
 | accessdate = February 11, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Uniform Investment Adviser Law Examination was developed by the [[North American Securities Administrators Association]] (NASAA) and is administered by the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA). Each Series 65, Uniform Investment Adviser Law Examination, contains a total of 140 questions. One hundred thirty (130) of the questions count toward whether the candidate passes or fails the Series 65 exam. The other 10 questions are pretest and could appear in any position within the exam but do not count towards the final grade. To pass the Series 65 Exam, candidates must correctly answer at least 94 of the 130 scored questions. Applicants have 180 minutes to complete the exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Series 65 &amp; 66 Resources
 | publisher = North American Securities Administrators Association
 | url = http://www.nasaa.org/industry-resources/exams/series-65-66-resources/
 | accessdate = February 11, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Uniform Investment Adviser Law Examinations are assembled by FINRA using a process called "on the fly." Each question in the pool has two parameters that are used as part of the assembly, a difficulty parameter and a content parameter. Each exam is assembled to meet the exam specifications for content and to have the same difficulty level as all other exams in the same Series.

==Examination==
The Uniform Investment Adviser Law Examination consists of 130 questions plus 10 pretest questions that cover topics applicants must know to provide investment advice to clients. Applicants have 180 minutes to complete the examination, and must answer at least 94 (72%) of the questions correctly to pass the Series 65 exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | url = http://www.nasaa.org/industry-resources/exams/series-65-66-resources/series-65-study-guide/
 | accessdate = February 11, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The examination is a closed book test. On completion of the examination, the score for each section and the overall test score are immediately available to the candidate.
Prior to January 1, 2010, a score of 68.5% was required to pass.

==Registration==
Individuals providing investment advice are called "Investment Adviser Representatives" (IAR). These IARs must generally complete The Uniform Investment Adviser Law Examination (see [[List of securities examinations]]) known as the Series 65 Exam, or by meeting the exam waiver requirement by holding one or more of the following pre-qualifying designations: [[Certified Financial Planner]] (CFP), [[The American College (Bryn Mawr, PA)|Chartered Financial Consultant]] (ChFC); [[Personal Financial Specialist]] (PFS), [[Chartered Financial Analyst]] (CFA), or Chartered Investment Counselor (CIC).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.investmentadviser.org/eweb/dynamicpage.aspx?webcode=cic Investmentadviser.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204746/https://www.investmentadviser.org/eweb/Dynamicpage.aspx?webcode=cic |date=2015-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasaa.org/Industry___Regulatory_Resources/Exams/1088.cfm North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930081857/http://www.nasaa.org/industry___regulatory_resources/exams/1088.cfm |date=2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The judgment was written by Judge [[Learned Hand]] wherein he described what is now called the [[calculus of negligence]] or the Hand Test, a classic example of a [[balancing test]].

==Background==
The case was the result of the sinking of the [[barge]] ''Anna C'' that took place on January 4, 1944 in [[New York Harbor]].&lt;ref name=feldman&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Feldman |first=Alan |last2=Kim |first2=Jeonghyun |title=The Hand Rule and United States v. Carroll Towing Co. Reconsidered |url= |year=2005 |volume=7 |journal=Am. L. &amp; Econ. Rev. |page=523 |pin=525}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pennsylvania Railroad|Pennsylvania Railroad Company]] chartered the ''Anna C'' from Conners Marine Company, which was loaded with flour owned by the United States.&lt;ref name=feldman/&gt; Before the accident, the ''Anna C'' was [[Mooring (watercraft)|moored]] at [[North River (Hudson River)#North River piers|Pier 52]] on the [[North River (Hudson River)|North River]] along with several other barges.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, ''supra'', at 525-526.&lt;/ref&gt; The barges at Pier 52 were tied together by mooring lines and one barge at Pier 52 was tied to another set of barges at the adjacent Public Pier.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Kelly |first=Patrick |title=The Carroll Towing Company Case and the Teaching of Tort Law |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223405/http://lawteaching.org/resources/lawreviewarticles/saintlouis/2001torts/kelley-patrick-ocr.pdf |year=2001 |volume=45 |journal=St. Louis U. L.J. |page=731 |pin=735}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of the accident the tug ''Carroll'' was sent to remove a barge from the Public Pier. In the process of removing the barge, the line between the barges at Pier 52 and the barges at the Public Pier was removed. [[#kelly|]], p.&amp;nbsp;735&lt;/ref&gt; After the removal of the line, the barges at Pier 52 broke free. This resulted in the sinking of ''Anna C''.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''supra'', at 736.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States, lessee of the ''Anna C'', sued Carroll Towing Co., owner of the ''Carroll'' in an indemnity action.

==Ruling==
The author of the opinion, [[Judge Learned Hand]], stated that there was no general rule with which to deal with liability when a barge with no one on board breaks free and causes damage. Consequently, Judge Hand proposed an algebraic formula to determine if the standard of care has been met. 
:''Since there are occasions when every vessel will break from her moorings, and since, if she does, she becomes a menace to those about her; the owner's duty, as in other similar situations, to provide against resulting injuries is a function of three variables: (1) The probability that she will break away; (2) the gravity of the resulting injury, if she does; (3) the burden of adequate precautions. Possibly it serves to bring this notion into relief to state it in algebraic terms: if the probability be called P; the injury, L; and the burden, B; liability depends upon whether B is less than L multiplied by P: i.e., whether B &lt; PL.''

Simply put, the test says:
 
If (Burden &lt; Cost of Injury × Probability of occurrence), then the accused will not have met the standard of care required.

If (Burden ≥ Cost of injury × Probability of occurrence), then the accused may have met the standard of care.

On the facts, the Court ruled that leaving a barge unattended during the daylight hours poses significant risk such that it would be fair to require a crew member to be aboard the ship. Thus, the accused was found liable for negligence for being absent from the ship without excuse.

This case is most famous for its first expression of Judge Hand's formula, C &gt; GL ('''c'''ost is greater than '''g'''ravity of '''l'''oss) or in the more common shorthand, BPL. This formula was first suggested, however, in The T.J. Hooper,&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/60/737/1542549/ 60 F.2d 737] (2d Cir.), [[Certiorari|cert.]] denied, {{ussc|287|662|1932|el=no}}.&lt;/ref&gt; another tugboat case.

The '''Virtual Cybernetic Building Testbed (VCBT)''' is a whole building [[emulator]] located at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]]. It is designed with enough flexibility to be capable of reproducibly simulating normal operation and a variety of faulty and hazardous conditions that might occur in a [[cybernetic]] building. It serves as a [[testbed]] for investigating the interactions between integrated building systems and a wide range of issues important to the development of cybernetic building technology.

The VCBT consists of a variety of simulation models that together emulate the
characteristics and performance of a cybernetic building system. The simulation models are
interfaced to real state-of-the-art [[BACnet]] speaking [[control system]]s to provide a hybrid
software/hardware testbed that can be used to develop and evaluate control strategies and control
products that use the [[BACnet]] [[communication protocol]].  The simulation models used are based on
versions of HVACSIM+ and CFAST.

A '''voivodeship marshal''' ({{lang-pl|marszałek województwa}}) is the head of the provincial-level government for each of the sixteen [[voivodeships of Poland]]. Elected by councillors from the [[voivodeship sejmik|provincial assembly]], the marshal is the head of the collective [[voivodeship executive board]], which acts as the ''de facto'' [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] for the region.&lt;ref name="CDLR17"&gt;[[#Council of Europe|Council of Europe]], p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The current competences and traditions of the contemporary voivodeship marshal stem from the Public Administrative Reform Act of 1998, which went into effect in January 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dz.U. 1998 nr 133 poz. 872|url=http://isip.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WDU19981330872|website=Internetowy System Aktów Prawnych|publisher=[[Sejm]]|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election==
A voivodeship marshal is elected by an absolute majority from the [[voivodeship sejmik]] in the presence of at least half of all assembly members.&lt;ref name="Prokrop144"&gt;[[#Prokop|Prokop]], p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; The marshal must be elected from among the councillors of the assembly.&lt;ref name=ARL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arl-net.de/commin/poland/22-regional-level-voivodeship|author=|publisher=Akademie für Raumforschung und Landesplanung|title=The regional level (voivodeship)|accessdate=13 November 2015|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At most, two other vice-marshals are additionally elected to sit with the marshal on the executive board by the assembly.&lt;ref name=Prokrop144/&gt; To dismiss the marshal, three-fifths of the sejmik must agree to his or her [[vote of no confidence]], which will also result in the collapse of the executive board.&lt;ref name=CDLR17/&gt; A marshal can also be dismissed by the [[Prime Minister of Poland|prime minister]] upon request of the province's centrally-appointed [[voivode]] if he or she has infringed a governing statute or the [[Constitution of Poland|constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Prokop|Prokop]], p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Duties==
As the head of the executive board, the marshal is tasked to organize the affairs of the body as well as the general governance of the voivodeship, acting as the provincial government's supreme public representative.&lt;ref name=CDLR17/&gt; The marshal, their respective executive boards, and the provincial assembly are further assisted by a marshal's office ({{lang-pl|urząd marszałkowski}}). The marshal's office provides technical, legal, organizational, and bureaucratic support for each of these bodies in the daily running of the voivodeship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Samorząd województwa - informacje ogólne|url=http://www.wrotapodlasia.pl/pl/adm/samorzad_woj|website=Portal Informacyjny Województwa Podlaskiego|publisher=Urząd Marszałkowski Województwa Podlaskiego|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In times of emergency or threats to life, public health, security, or material loss in the province, the marshal is reserved extraordinary executive powers normally reserved for the collective executive board as a whole to make decisions.&lt;ref name=CDLR17/&gt;&lt;ref name=ARL/&gt; However, such decisions are subject to retrospective approval immediately upon the next convening of the board.&lt;ref name=ARL/&gt;

The '''Way of Human Rights''' ({{lang-de|'''Straße der Menschenrechte'''}}) is a monumental outdoor sculpture in [[Nuremberg]], [[Germany]].  It was opened on 24 October 1993.  It is sited on the street between the new and old buildings of the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]], connecting Kornmarkt street and the medieval [[city wall]].

In 1988, a twelve-person jury from the Germanisches Nationalmuseum held a design competition to decide on the artistic design of the Kartäusergasse street in Nuremberg.  The winner was a proposal by Israeli artist [[Dani Karavan]] consisting of a gate, 27 round [[Column|pillar]]s made of white concrete, two pillars buried in the ground showing only a round plate, and one columnar [[oak]], for a total of 30 pillars.  Engraved in each pillar is one article of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in German and another language.&lt;ref&gt;The inscriptions as summarized by Karavan on the columns http://www.humanrightsanimationproject.org/english/html/human_rights.html accessed 1 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pillars are 8 metres in height, 80&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter, and spaced regularly at 5 metres along an axis.&lt;ref&gt;Information about the project from http://www.danikaravan.com/ accessed 1 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The north gate mirrors the medieval city gate located at the south end of the street.

The site of project has a layered history, including the remnants of a monastery, the medieval city wall, buildings designed by [[Sep Ruf]] in the 1950s and 1960s, and a glass-enclosed entrance designed by the firm ME DI UM in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gnm.de/architektur.html accessed 4 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

This sculpture is part of Nuremberg's efforts to shake off its [[Nazi Germany|Nazi-era]] reputation as the "City of the Party Rallies" and reinvent itself as a "City of Peace and Human Rights".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuernberg.de/internet/portal_e/buerger/human_rights.html
accessed 4 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Nuremberg was honored for this attempt at transformation with the [[UNESCO Prize for Human Rights Education]],&lt;ref&gt;Award ceremony address by Koïchiro Matsuura http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001224/122419E.pdf 21 April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Way of Human Rights'' being specifically cited.  The monument is intended as both a repudiation of past crimes and a permanent reminder that human rights are still regularly violated.  Nuremberg's prize for human rights, the [[Nuremberg International Human Rights Award]], is awarded on the site every two years.

On January 26, 1999, the European Communities (EC) and its Member States requested consultation with the United States concerning a dispute over discrepancies between the WTO [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPs Agreement) and Section 110(5) of the United States Copyright Act amended by the Fairness in Music Licensing Act. The dispute was over the legality of “the playing of radio and television music in public places (such as bars, shops, restaurants etc.) without the payment of a royalty fee” (World). The disputed parties worked through the existing process of [[WTO Dispute Settlement]]. First the EC lodged a complaint against the US with the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) and requested consultation over the dispute. Then the parties requested a panel leading to the body’s eventual formation, followed by the circulation of the panel report. The parties accepted the Panel Report without appeal and the dispute ended in arbitration over implementation of the panel’s recommendations. Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, and Switzerland acted as third parties in this dispute (World).

==The Complaint==
The [[European Community]] and its Member States considered the United States in violation of international copyright law at the cost of European artists. The European Community questioned the US Copyright Act in which Section 110(5) creates two exemptions. The first, a so-called “business exemption,”  allowed food, drink, and retail establishments under certain size and equipment restrictions, to display audio or visual transmissions without paying a royalty fee provided the establishments did not charge directly for the transmission and did not display the service beyond the establishment’s boundaries. The second, a “homestyle exemption,” gave the same exemption to small establishments that used only broadcasting equipment commonly found in private homes (World). The two TRIPs articles cited by the European Community disagreed with the US exemptions; stating 1) in article 13, that exceptions to copyright law would be exclusive to cases that do not “unreasonably” run contrary to the interests of the right holder and 2) in article 9(1), that members party to the TRIPs agreement would almost entirely comply with the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] (TRIPS).

The Berne Convention is an international agreement that defines creative property rights across borders, which gives the copyright holder the exclusive right to control not only the broadcast of the work but also the public exhibition of it through the use of “ loudspeaker or analogous instrument”. The complainant specifically noted article 11(1) of the Berne Convention which places the right to control “any communication to the public of the performance of [the] works” “by any means” solely in the copyright holder (Berne).

==The Panel Report==
The Panel defined three principles that the US exemptions had to uniformly meet to prove valid. The panel stated that if the exceptions “(i) [were] confined to certain special cases; (ii) [did] not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work; and (iii) [did] not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder ” they would not violate the Berne Convention (Report). The Panel, noting that 45 to 73 per cent of pertinent establishments were covered by the exemption, found the “business exemption” to violate Article 13 of the TRIPs Agreement, thus inconsistent with Article 11 of the Berne Convention, and recommended that the Dispute Settlement Body require the United States to rework the law into accordance with the TRIPs Agreement. Comparatively, the “homestyle exemption,” which only affected 13-18 per cent of establishments, met the Article 13 requirements thus agreed with the Berne Convention. The DSB adopted the report on July 27, 2000 (US - Section 110(5)).

==Implementation==
The parties calculated that the “business exemption” had nullified €1,219,900 per year. The United States proposed 15 months as a reasonable amount of time needed to implement the recommendations of the DSB and, after some arbitration, the DSB and EC accepted the time period. The US, however, failed to bring the law into the bounds of the TRIPs Agreement within the deadline, and the European Communities pressured the DSB to “suspend concessions.” As both the EC and the third party Australia bemoaned the United States’ slow progress, the US continually reported that its delegation was working with Congress to enact the settlement. In the end, the US failed to mobilize Congress to pass the issue before the next Congressional recess. The EC and the US reached a mutual temporary agreement on June 23, 2003 (World).
