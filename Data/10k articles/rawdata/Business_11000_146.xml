'''333 Bush Street''' is a 43-[[Storey|floor]], {{convert|151|m|abbr=on}} mixed-use [[skyscraper]] located on Bush Street in the [[Financial District (San Francisco)|Financial District]] of [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. The building was completed in 1986 and was designed by [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] and contains commercial offices as well as seven stories of individually owned residential [[condominium]]s.

==Recent ownership history==
In 2009, the tower's owners, Hines and Sterling American Property, forfeited ownership to their lenders after the primary tenant, multinational law firm [[Heller Ehrman]] filed for bankruptcy and defaulted on rent payments leaving property 65 percent vacant.&lt;ref name="SFChron1"&gt;{{cite news |first=J.K. |last=Dineen  |title=Brookfield Properties forecloses on 333 Bush in S.F. |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2009/12/14/story2.html |work=San Francisco Business Times | date=13 December 2009 | accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the building was purchased by a joint venture of Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management Board and DivcoWest Properties for US$275 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.theregistrysf.com/mass-prim-buys-purchase-333-bush-street/ |title=Mass PRIM Buys Into Purchase of 333 Bush Street |first=Jon |last=Peterson |date=October 22, 2013 |work=The Registry}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the property was acquired by [[Tishman Speyer]] for US$380 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.theregistrysf.com/tishman-speyer-to-buy-333-bush-in-san-francisco-near-700-per-square-foot-or-approx-380mm/ |title=Tishman Speyer to Buy 333 Bush in San Francisco Near $700 Per Square Foot or Approx. $380MM |first=Jon |last=Peterson |date=October 12, 2015 |work=The Registry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Administrative Behavior: a Study of Decision-Making Processes in Administrative Organization''''' is a book written by [[Herbert A. Simon]] (1916–2001). It asserts that "[[Decision making|decision-making]] is the heart of [[Administration of business|administration]], and that the vocabulary of administrative theory must be derived from the logic and psychology of human choice", and it attempts to describe administrative [[organization]]s "in a way that will provide the basis for scientific analysis".&lt;ref name=AB1947&gt;{{cite book | last = Simon | first = Herbert A. | title = Administrative Behavior: a Study of Decision-Making Processes in Administrative Organization | publisher = Macmillan | location = New York | year = 1947 | edition=1st | oclc = 356505}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xiii-xiv}}&lt;ref name=AB1957&gt;{{cite book | last = Simon | first = Herbert A. | title = Administrative Behavior: a Study of Decision-Making Processes in Administrative Organization | publisher = Macmillan | location = New York | year = 1957 | edition=2nd | oclc = 964597}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xlv-xlvi}}&lt;ref name=AB1976&gt;{{cite book | last = Simon | first = Herbert A. | title = Administrative Behavior: a Study of Decision-Making Processes in Administrative Organization | publisher = Free Press | location = New York | year = 1976 | edition=3rd | isbn = 0029289718}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xlvii-xlviii}}&lt;ref name=AB1997&gt;{{cite book | last = Simon | first = Herbert A. | title = Administrative Behavior: a Study of Decision-Making Processes in Administrative Organizations | publisher = Free Press | location = New York | year = 1997 | edition=4th | isbn = 0684835827 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xi}} The first edition was published in 1947; the second, in 1957; the third, in 1976; and the fourth, in 1997. As summarized in a 2001 obituary of Simon, the book "reject[ed] the notion of an omniscient 'economic man' capable of making decisions that bring the greatest benefit possible and substitut[ed] instead the idea of 'administrative man' who '[[Satisficing|satisfices]]—looks for a course of action that is satisfactory'".&lt;ref name=Lewis2001&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Paul|title=Herbert A.

==Background==

The book is based on Simon's doctoral thesis in [[political science]] at the [[University of Chicago]], which he began planning in 1937.&lt;ref name=Simon1991&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Simon | first1 = Herbert A. | title = Models of My Life | year = 1991 | publisher = Basic Books | location = [New York] | isbn = 0465046401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}} At the time, the chair of the political science department was [[Charles Edward Merriam]].&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|55–63}}

Beginning in 1936, Simon worked as a half-time research assistant and then as a full-time staff member at the [[International City/County Management Association|International City Managers Association]] (ICMA).&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|69–92}}&lt;ref name= Crowther-Heyck2005&gt;{{cite book | last = Crowther-Heyck | first = Hunter | title = Herbert A. Simon: the Bounds of Reason in Modern America | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | year = 2005 | isbn = 0801880254 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|76–77,84–87,96–97}} Among other activities at ICMA, he learned about administration and about scientific collaboration from director Clarence Ridley, and published his first book with Ridley in 1938.&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|64,72}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ridley | first1 = Clarence E. | last2 = Simon |first2 = Herbert A. | title = Measuring Municipal Activities: a Survey of Suggested Criteria and Reporting Forms for Appraising Administration | publisher = International City Managers Association | location = Chicago | year = 1938 | oclc = 2049544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Simon cites Ridley as a major influence on his thinking, Simon did not actually work on his thesis while at ICMA.&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|64–65,69–72,74}}

Simon took a position at the [[Institute of Governmental Studies|Bureau of Public Administration]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] between 1939 and 1942.&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|78–85}} It was at Berkeley that he completed his [[University of Chicago]] Ph.D. thesis, which was approved by a committee consisting of [[Leonard D. White]], C.&amp;nbsp;Herman Pritchett, Clarence Ridley, and Charner Marquis Perry.&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|84}} Simon received his doctorate in 1942.&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|84–85}}

==Influences==

In writing his thesis and book, Simon was influenced by ''[[The Functions of the Executive]]'' (1938) by [[Chester I. Barnard]]. In his 1991 [[autobiography]], Simon wrote that he found Barnard's book "wholly superior to the other administrative literature of the day and fully compatible with my preference for looking at management in decision-making terms".&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|73}} The book, which Simon read "with painstaking care", motivated Simon to reflect upon his experiences and to focus on administrative decision making.&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|73–74,86–87}} In a 1988 interview, Simon was quoted as follows:&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988Interview/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Of course I built squarely on Barnard, and have always felt deeply indebted to him; science is a cumulative endeavor...In the book itself there are fourteen references to Barnard...the notions of the contribution-inducement equilibrium, authority, and zone of acceptance were all derived from Barnard...What I would now regard as the principal novelties in ''Administative'' [sic] ''Behavior'' are the development of the concept of organizational identification...the description of the decision process in terms of the processing of decision premises, and the [[bounded rationality]] notions...Most of the rest is highly "Barnardian", and certainly even those "novel" ideas are in no way inconsistent with Barnard's view of organizations.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mitchell and Scott have noted similarities in Barnard's and Simon's concepts of authority, organizational equilibrium, and decision making.&lt;ref name=MitchellScott1988&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Mitchell |first1= Terence R. |last2= Scott |first2= William G. |date= Fall 1988|title= The Barnard-Simon Contribution: a Vanished Legacy|journal= Public Administration Quarterly|volume=12 |issue=3 |pages= 348–368|jstor=40861427}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|349–352}}&lt;ref name=Mahoney2005&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Mahoney | first1 = Joseph T. | title = Economic Foundations of Strategy | year = 2005 | publisher = SAGE | location = Thousand Oaks, CA | isbn = 1-4129-0543-5 | chapter = Chapter 1: Behavioral Theory of the Firm | pages = 1–53 | url = http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/5029_Mahoney_Chapter_1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}  For example, Barnard's "zone of indifference" (a subordinate's unquestioned acceptance of authority) became Simon's "zone of acceptance".&lt;ref name=MitchellScott1988/&gt;{{rp|350}}&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988PartI&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Golembiewski |first1= Robert T. |year= 1988|title= Perspectives on Simon's Administrative Behavior: Stock-Taking on the Fortieth Anniversary – Part I |journal= Public Administration Quarterly |volume=12 |issue= 3|pages=259–382|jstor=40861422}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|266}}  In addition, Mitchell and Scott concluded that both Simon and Barnard believed that large organizations control individuals' behavior and manipulate their opinions.&lt;ref name=MitchellScott1988/&gt;{{rp|357–364}}

Philosophers who influenced Simon include [[William James]], [[John Dewey]], [[A.&amp;nbsp;J. Ayer]], and [[Rudolf Carnap]].&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|45–46,80,82,88,90,93,96,101,186,195,199}}&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988Interview/&gt;&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|53–54,58–59}}&lt;ref name= Crowther-Heyck2005/&gt;{{rp|99–101}}&lt;ref name=Kerr2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerr|first1=Gerry|title=The Development History and Philosophical Sources of Herbert Simon's ''Administrative Behavior''|journal=Journal of Management History|volume=13|issue=3|year=2007|pages=255–268|doi=10.1108/17511340710754707}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas of behavioral psychologist [[Edward C. Tolman]] and sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] also contributed to Simon's work.&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|86,114,190–191}}&lt;ref name= Crowther-Heyck2005/&gt;{{rp|101–105}}  Simon characterized his own philosophical approach as [[logical positivism]].&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|45}}&lt;ref name=Sherwood1990/&gt;{{rp|253}}

==Editions==

===Preliminary (1945)===
In 1945, when Simon was at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], he sent [[mimeograph]]ed copies of a preliminary version of the book (which was similar to his thesis) to about 200 people he thought might be interested in his work.&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988Interview/&gt;&lt;ref name= Crowther-Heyck2005/&gt;{{rp|130–131}} One of the recipients of the preliminary version was Barnard. Although Simon did not know Barnard personally, Barnard sent a total of 25 pages of detailed comments to Simon, which resulted in a thorough revision of the book.&lt;ref name= Crowther-Heyck2005/&gt;{{rp|131–133}} Simon then asked Barnard to write the book's foreword.&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|88}}

===1st (1947)===
The first edition had 16 pages of [[Book design#Front matter|front matter]] (e.g., a Foreword by Chester Barnard, a Preface, and Acknowledgements), as well as 259 pages of [[Book design#Body matter|body matter]] (i.e., Chapters I-XI) and [[Book design#Back matter|back matter]] (Appendix and Index).&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;

The published first edition was different from the preliminary version in many ways, including:&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988Interview/&gt;&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|86}}&lt;ref name= Crowther-Heyck2005/&gt;{{rp|133–134}}
* Mathematical appendices and a comparison of rats and humans in organizations was removed
* The chapters were rearranged, with "Some Problems of Administrative Theory" moved up to Chapter&amp;nbsp;II
* Some discussion of [[logical positivism]] was deleted
* There was more discussion of communication within organizations
* Material that could be considered "political" (e.g., passages that appeared to support [[New Deal]] economics) had been taken out

In the Foreword, Barnard states that Simon's conclusions are "consonant with [his] experience" as an executive, and expresses hope that "ultimately it may be possible to state principles of general organization".&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|ix-xii}}&lt;ref name=AB1957/&gt;{{rp|xli-xliv}}&lt;ref name=AB1976/&gt;{{rp|xliiii-xlvi}}  In the Acknowledgements, Simon thanked Barnard for ''The Functions of the Executive'', for "the extremely careful critical review he gave the preliminary version of this book", and for his Foreword.&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|xv-xvi}}&lt;ref name=AB1957/&gt;{{rp|xlvii-xlviii }}&lt;ref name=AB1976/&gt;{{rp|xlix-l}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|xiii}}

===2nd (1957)===
The second edition featured a new Introduction, causing the book to contain 48 pages of front matter and 259 pages of body and back matter.&lt;ref name=AB1957/&gt; The Introduction summarized the book's structure, suggested how practitioners might apply the book's lessons, discussed the concepts of rational behavior and [[satisficing]], commented on specific chapters in the book, and provided recent references.&lt;ref name=AB1957/&gt;{{rp|ix-xxxix}}&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988Interview/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sent1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sent|first1=Esther-Mirjam|title= Administrative Man Versus/As Economic Man (book review)|journal=Journal of Economic Methodology|volume=6|issue=1|year=1999|pages=133–139|doi=10.1080/13501789900000008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===3rd (1976)===

===4th (1997)===
[[File:Administrative Behavior 4th Edition 1997 Cover.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of 4th edition (1997); note change of subtitle to "...Organizations"]]
For the fourth edition, with 15 pages of front matter and 368 pages of body and back matter, the last word in the subtitle was changed from "Organization" to "Organizations".&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt; The fourth edition lacked Barnard's foreword which had been present in the first through third editions.&lt;ref name=Sent1999/&gt; Instead of the third edition's lengthy Introduction and Part&amp;nbsp;II, in the fourth edition the Introduction was briefer and Simon's commentaries followed each chapter of the original text.&lt;ref name=Kerr2007/&gt;{{rp|256}}&lt;ref name=Sent1999/&gt;

==Summaries of Chapters I-XI and Appendix ==
The text and pagination of the 253 pages of Chapters I-XI and of the Appendix ("What Is an Administrative Science?") were the same in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd editions. Although the text of Chapters I-XI and the Appendix was the same in the 4th edition, the pagination was different.

=== Chapter I. Decision-Making and Administrative Organization===
This chapter was based on a 1944 article with the same name in ''Public Administration Review''.&lt;ref name=Simon1944&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simon|first1=Herbert A.|title=Decision-Making and Administrative Organization|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=4|issue=1|year=1944|pages=16–30|doi=10.2307/972435|url= http://shelf1.library.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/tiff2pdf/simon/box00063/fld04779/bdl0001/doc0001/simon.pdf |jstor=972435}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simon distinguishes between "value judgments" (which "lead toward the selection of final goals") and "factual judgments" (which "involve the implementation of such goals"),&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|4–5}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|4}} a topic which he explores more fully in Chapter&amp;nbsp;III. The relationship of the individual and the group in decision-making is explored; for example, influences upon individuals include authority, organizational loyalty, efficiency, advice and information, and training.&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|11–16}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|9–13}}

=== Chapter II. Some Problems of Administrative Theory ===
Based on a 1946 article in ''Public Administration Review'' entitled "The Proverbs of Administration",&lt;ref name="Simon1946"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simon|first1=Herbert A.|title=The Proverbs of Administration|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=6|issue=1|year=1946|pages=53–67|doi=10.2307/973030|url= http://shelf1.library.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/tiff2pdf/simon/box00063/fld04787/bdl0001/doc0001/simon.pdf|jstor=973030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter&amp;nbsp;II is notable for the following passage near its beginning:&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|20–21}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|29}}&lt;ref name=Banfield1957&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Banfield|first1=Edward C.|title=The Decision-Making Schema|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=17|issue=4|year=1957|pages=278–285|doi=10.2307/973419|jstor=973419}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|279}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a fatal defect of the current principles of administration that, like proverbs, they occur in pairs. For almost every principle one can find an equally plausible and acceptable contradictory principle. Although the two principles of the pair will lead to exactly opposite organizational recommendations, there is nothing in the theory to indicate which is the proper one to apply. To substantiate this criticism, it is necessary to examine briefly some of the leading principles.
# Administrative efficiency is increased by a specialization of the task among the group
# Administrative efficiency is increased by arranging the members of the group in a determinate hierarchy of authority
# Administrative efficiency is increased by limiting the span of control at any point in the hierarchy to a small number
# Administrative efficiency is increased by grouping the workers
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These principles were found in the 1937 book ''Papers on the Science of Administration'' edited by [[Luther Gulick (social scientist)|Luther Gulick]] and [[Lyndall Urwick]].&lt;ref name= Crowther-Heyck2005/&gt;{{rp|97}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Papers on the Science of Administration |editor1-first= Luther |editor1-last= Gulick |editor2-first= L.|editor2-last= Urwick |year=1937 |publisher= Institute of Public Administration, Columbia University|location= New York |oclc=995995|url= https://archive.org/details/papersonscienceo00guli }}&lt;/ref&gt; After pointing out the shortcomings in the four principles, such as ambiguities and lack of empirical evidence, Simon states that "over-all efficiency must be the guiding criterion" in administrative organizations and that scientific methods must be applied to determine how to improve that efficiency.&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|36,42–44}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|43,48–49}}

=== Chapter III. Fact and Value in Decision-Making===
Chapter III "clarifies foundational aspects of the logic of choice."&lt;ref name=Cohen2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Michael D.|title=''Administrative Behavior'': Laying the Foundations for Cyert and March|journal=Organization Science|volume=18|issue=3|year=2007|pages=503–506|doi=10.1287/orsc.1070.0275}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|504}} The first section of the chapter provides details for the explanation in Chapter&amp;nbsp;I of "facts" versus "values". The chapter's second section on "Policy and Administration" discusses how the legislative and executive branches of government apply facts and values.&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|52–59}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|61–67}}

=== Chapter IV. Rationality in Administrative Behavior===
After considering how the ideas of [[Instrumental value|means]] and [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|ends]] relate to decision-making,&lt;ref name=Cohen2007/&gt;{{rp|504}} Simon distinguishes among "objectively", "subjectively", "consciously", "deliberately", "organizationally", and "personally" rational decisions.&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|76–77}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|85}}

=== Chapter V. The Psychology of Administrative Decisions===
In the first part of this chapter, "The Limits of Rationality", Simon wrote:&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|81}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|93–94}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;Actual behavior falls short, in at least three ways, of objective rationality…:
:(1) Rationality requires a complete knowledge and anticipation of the consequences that will follow on each choice. In fact, knowledge of consequences is always fragmentary.
:(2) Since these consequences lie in the future, imagination must supply the lack of experienced feeling in attaching value to them. But values can be only imperfectly anticipated.
:(3) Rationality requires a choice among all possible alternative behaviors. In actual behavior, only a very few of all these possible alternatives ever come to mind.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The remainder of the chapter concerns "Purposive Behavior in the Individual" and "The Integration of Behavior".

=== Chapter VI. The Equilibrium of the Organization===
As summarized by Simon in the 4th edition's "Commentary on Chapter VI", the central idea of this chapter is that "the survival and success of organizations depend on their providing sufficient incentives to their members to secure the contributions that are needed to carry out the organizations' tasks".&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|164}}

=== Chapter VII. The Role of Authority===
Chapters VII-X deal with four ways in which an organization can influence an individual's decisions. In Chapter&amp;nbsp;VII, Simon discusses the nature of authority and how it is used in organizations: for enforcing responsibility, for obtaining decision-making expertise, and for coordinating activity. Four methods are described for avoiding conflicts in authority when a subordinate has multiple superiors.

=== Chapter VIII. Communication===
Simon defines communication as "any process whereby decisional premises are transmitted from one member of an organization to another".&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|154}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|208}} Communication can be formal or informal, may need to be archived to provide "memory" for an organization, and is sometimes accomplished through training. The 4th edition's "Commentary on Chapter&amp;nbsp;VIII" discusses computerized communications which were unavailable in 1947.&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|223–249}}

=== Chapter IX. The Criterion of Efficiency===
This chapter expands upon a concept that had been mentioned briefly in preceding chapters.&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|14,122}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|12,149–150}}  In a for-profit organization, the "criterion of efficiency" states than an individual will select an alternative that will maximize income and minimize cost so as to "yield the greatest net (money) return to the organization".&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|172–173}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|250–251}}  More generally (i.e., to include nonprofit organizations) the criterion causes "''that choice of alternatives which produces the largest result for the given application of resources''."&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|179}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|256}}  In the remainder of the chapter, Simon counters criticisms of the efficiency criterion and outlines methods by which efficiency can be attained (e.g., by "functionalization" and by the public budgeting process).

=== Chapter X. Loyalties and Organizational Identification===
Following a concept of [[Harold Lasswell]], Simon asserts that "''a person identifies himself with a group when, in making a decision, he evaluates the several alternatives of choice in terms of their consequences for the specified group.''"&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|205}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|284}}  Such organizational identification can be associated with decisions that are not optimal in terms of an organization's efficiency or adequacy ("the degree to which its goals have been reached").&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|212}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|290}}

=== Chapter XI. The Anatomy of Organization===
Simon describes the organizational decision-making process and writes:&lt;ref name=AB1947/&gt;{{rp|240–241}}&lt;ref name=AB1997/&gt;{{rp|322}}&lt;ref name=Kerr2007/&gt;{{rp|263}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;The need for an administrative theory resides in the fact that there ''are'' practical limits to human rationality, and that these limits are not static, but depend upon the organizational environment in which the individual's decision takes place. The task of administration is so to design this environment that the individual will approach as close as practicable to rationality (judged in terms of the organization's goals) in his decisions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Appendix: What Is an Administrative Science?===
In the final part of the book common to all editions, Simon discusses the "theoretical" (descriptive) aspects and "practical" aspects (i.e., leading toward the improved attainment of objectives) of the science of administration.

==Criticism==
* [[Robert A. Dahl]] wrote in 1947 that a science of organizations was impossible due to cultural differences among organizations.&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988PartI/&gt;{{rp|263}} Similarly, a 1957 review of the second edition questioned whether scientific studies of important aspects of organizational decision-making "under controlled conditions" could ever be undertaken.&lt;ref name=Banfield1957/&gt; Simon responded to the 1957 review that "as knowledge advances...administrative practice will come to rest largely on scientifically tested knowledge of fundamental underlying mechanisms".&lt;ref name=Simon1958&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simon|first1=Herbert A.|title='The Decision-Making Schema': a Reply|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=18|issue=1|year=1958|pages=60–63|doi=10.2307/973736|url=http://octopus.library.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/tiff2pdf/simon/box00064/fld04871/bdl0001/doc0001/simon.pdf|jstor=973736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1962 [[Herbert Storing]] edited a book entitled ''Essays on the Scientific Study of Politics''; one of the essays therein, by Storing himself, critiqued ''Administrative Behavior''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Essays on the Scientific Study of Politics | editor1-last = Storing | editor1-first = Herbert J. | editor1-link = Herbert Storing |year=1962 |publisher= Holt, Rinehart and Winston |location= New York | chapter = The Science of Administration: Herbert A. Simon |oclc= 497089}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, Simon wrote that the essays in Storing's book "were such egregious examples of the practice of reading texts unsympathetically and without a genuine attempt to understand them that [he] never felt an urge to respond to them".&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|63,270}}&lt;ref name=Sent1999/&gt; One analysis notes differences in Storing's and Simon's styles of thinking ("dichotomous" versus "synthetic"), levels of abstraction, and "assumed 'goodness' of organizations".&lt;ref name= Chisholm1989&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Chisholm |first1= Rupert F. |title = The Storing Critique Revisited: Simon as Seen in the Science of Politics|journal= Public Administration Quarterly|volume=12|issue=4|year=1989|pages=411–436|jstor=40861433}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Simon does not offer any convincing replacement for the principles of organization that he critiques.&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988PartI/&gt;{{rp|267}}
* Simon's introductions and commentaries in the second through fourth editions interpret material in the first edition in a way that stretches its meaning or contradicts it.&lt;ref name=Kerr2007/&gt;{{rp|256–257}}  For example, Simon saw "satisficing man" in the 1947 text but other authors saw "maximizing man".&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988PartI/&gt;{{rp|267}} 
* The fact/value and policy/administration distinctions have been criticized as unnecessary.&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988Interview/&gt;{{rp|290–293}}&lt;ref name=Kerr2007/&gt;{{rp|256}}
* The book minimizes the role of emotions and habit in organizations.&lt;ref name=Cohen2007/&gt;{{rp|506}}
* Simon did not analyze how immoral behavior, such as [[police corruption]], can occur within organizations.&lt;ref name=Gow2003/&gt;
* A 1990 essay asserts that Chapter&amp;nbsp;II ("Some Problems of Administrative Theory") did not criticize Gulick's work fairly in that Gulick already recognized most of the problems that Simon discussed.&lt;ref name=Hammond1990&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammond|first1=Thomas H.|title=In Defence of Luther Gulick's 'Notes on the Theory of Organization'|journal=Public Administration|volume=68|issue=2|year=1990|pages=143–173|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9299.1990.tb00752.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Simon felt that the reviews of the first edition "were generally kind, but the reviewers were not exhilerated [sic]",&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988Interview/&gt; and that the book "created no sensation" at first.&lt;ref name=Simon1991/&gt;{{rp|88}}&lt;ref name=Sent1999/&gt;  Nevertheless, it became notable for the following innovations:
* A scientific approach to administration.&lt;ref name=MitchellScott1988/&gt;{{rp|356–357}}

In 1978, [[Sune Carlson]] said in a speech at the ceremony awarding Simon a Nobel Prize in Economics:&lt;ref name=Carlson1978/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;…the study of the structure and the decision-making of the firm became an important task in economic science. … In his epoch-making book ''Administrative Behavior'', which first appeared in 1947 and which has been translated into nearly a dozen languages, as well as in a number of subsequent works, Simon describes the company as an adaptive system of physical, personal and social components, which are held together by a network of intercommunications and by the willingness of its members to co-operate and to work towards common goals. …
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Nevertheless, it was reported that economists [[Albert Ando]] and [[William Baumol]] had "made little reference to ''Administrative Behavior''" in arguing to the Nobel Prize Committee that Simon should win.&lt;ref name=Sent1999/&gt;{{rp|138}}

Between 1955 and 1988, the book was translated into 12 languages: Chinese, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish.&lt;ref name=Sherwood1990/&gt;  A set of 12 papers about the book appeared in ''Public Administration Quarterly'' in 1988-1989 for the book's 40th anniversary.&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988PartI/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title= ''Public Administration Quarterly'' Vol. 12, No. 3, Fall 1988 (Table of Contents) |publisher=Southern Public Administration Education Foundation | jstor = i40038729 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Golembiewski1988PartII&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Golembiewski |first1= Robert T. |year= 1988|title= Perspectives on Simon's Administrative Behavior: Stock-Taking on the Fortieth Anniversary – A Symposium, Part II |journal= Public Administration Quarterly |volume=12 |issue= 4|pages=389–391|jstor=40861431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=i40038730|title= ''Public Administration Quarterly'' Vol. 12, No. 4, Winter, 1989 (Table of Contents) |publisher=Southern Public Administration Education Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Sherwood reported in ''Public Administration Review'' that 19 of 20 members of an informal advisory panel voted ''Administrative Behavior'' one of the "five or six most influential" books in academic [[public administration]] published between 1940 and 1990, making it the "public administration book of the half century."&lt;ref name=Sherwood1990/&gt;{{rp|249}} It was the "overwhelming leader" among the books nominated, receiving "twice as many nominations as any other book."&lt;ref name=Sherwood1990/&gt;{{rp|251,254}} Despite over 150,000 copies of the book having been sold in English, in a small survey of recent graduates from a [[Master of Public Administration]] program, Sherwood found widespread belief in the administrative proverbs that Simon attempted to discredit in Chapter II.&lt;ref name=Sherwood1990/&gt;{{rp|252,254}}

The '''Adult Film Association of America''' ('''AFAA''') was the first [[United States|American]] association of [[pornographic film]] producers. It fought against [[censorship]] laws, attempted to defend the industry against prosecution for [[obscenity]], and held an annual [[#Erotic_Film_Awards|adult film awards ceremony]]. Founded in 1969, it continued separate operation until 1992 when it merged with [[Free Speech Coalition#Legal advocacy|Free Speech Legal Defense Fund]].&lt;ref name="afwg0593" /&gt; The organization was also host to the '''Erotic Film Awards''' which were held from 1977 until 1986.

== History ==

=== Origin, 1970s and 1980s ===
It was founded in 1969 in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], with Sam Chernoff of Astro-Jemco Film Co. as the first [[president]]. Other notable presidents included [[film producer]] [[David F. Friedman]], elected the third president in 1971, and re-elected four times before becoming [[Chairman]] of the Board, and erotic actress and [[magazine]] publisher [[Gloria Leonard]], who became president in 1986.&lt;ref name="afw0187"&gt;"10th Annual Erotic Awards," ''Adam Film World'', January 1987, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

It held adult [[film awards]] ceremonies for 10 years during the [[Golden Age of Porn]]. The first awards ceremony was held July 14, 1977, at the [[Ebell of Los Angeles|Wilshire Ebell Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]] while religious protesters picketed outside,&lt;ref name="afw1277"&gt;Thomas H. Hilton, "The First Annual Erotica Awards", ''Adam Film World'', December 1977, pp. 18-21.&lt;/ref&gt; as they would several years thereafter.&lt;ref name="rimmer"&gt;[[Robert Rimmer]], ''The X-Rated Videotape Guide'', Prometheus Books, 1993. {{ISBN|0-87975-799-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afw0179"&gt;Frank Thistle, "The Second Annual Erotica Awards," ''Adam Film World'', January 1979, pp. 24-27, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hs1179"&gt;"Silver Spoonfuls: A Star Is Porn," ''High Society'' magazine, November 1979, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afw0180"&gt;Jules Griffon, "The Third Annual Erotica Awards", ''Adam Film World'', Vol. 7, No. 8, January 1980, pp. 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="genesis0180"&gt;Ken Gaul, "California Split—Oscar Night in XXX-Film Land," ''Genesis'' magazine, January 1980, pp. 58-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pornstars8011"&gt;Richard Milner, "Erotica '80 Awards", ''Porn Stars, the Stag Erotic Series'', November–December 1980, pp. 86-89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cheri0784"&gt;"Go for Bold: Stars and stares compete at the 8th Annual Erotica Awards," ''Cheri Magazine'', July 1984, pp. 14-17.&lt;/ref&gt; "These feverish protesters are such a familiar part of the ritual, they really should be listed in the program," sex news magazine ''Cheri'' stated after the 1983 awards.&lt;ref name="cheri1183"&gt;"Winners, Sinners &amp; Skin", ''Cheri'' magazine, November 1983, pp. 32-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of pornography on video, in early 1986 the AFAA renamed itself '''Adult Film and Video Association of America (AFVAA)'''&lt;ref name="cheri0187" /&gt; and added a new award category, [[#Best Adult Video|best adult video]]. The 10th annual awards, held at the Sheraton Premiere Hotel in Los Angeles on June 29, 1986, were the last.

The association changed its name again in 1987 to the '''Adult Video Association (AVA)'''.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Williams, [http://www.xbiz.com/articles/18467 "Gloria Leonard" feature], XBIZ.com, Dec. 6, 2006; retrieved June 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; No awards were given for 1987.&lt;ref name="afwg1988dir"&gt;"Award Winners: Adult Film Association of America Erotica Award", ''Adam Film World Guide'', Vol. 3, No. 12, March 1988, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, in mid-1988 they were replaced by an annual Night of the Stars dinner-dance and legal fundraiser,&lt;ref&gt;Bob Johnson, [http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php?id=135778&amp;mi=all&amp;q=night+of+the+stars "Free Speech Coalition Reaches 20-Year Milestone Fighting the Good Fight,"] Xbiz.com, retrieved June 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the fifth of which it held in June 1992 with more than 500 people in attendance, the association's biggest show ever.&lt;ref name="afwg0593" /&gt; [[#Lifetime_Achievement_Awards|Lifetime Achievement Awards]] were presented at the Night of the Stars, however, film awards were discontinued.

=== 1990s ===
By February 1992, the tables were turned – association members "picketed the Public Forum on Pornography sponsored by religious groups who hope to institute [[Motion Picture Production Code|morality codes]] back into all movies made."&lt;ref name="afwg0593"&gt;Jeremy Stone, "1992: The Year in Porn", ''Adam Film World Guide'', May 1993, pp. 6-7 &amp; 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1992, Video Vixens [[Trading Cards]] for [[Collecting|collectors]] were released with part of the profits going to the AVA. That same month, the AVA and Free Speech Legal Defense Fund, which had been organized in 1991, unified to create a new [[umbrella organization]], the '''[[Free Speech Coalition]] (FSC)'''.&lt;ref name="afwg0593" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discountadultshopping.com/glorialeonard/glorialeonardbiography.html |title=The Life Of Legendary Porn Actress Gloria Leonard|website=discountadultshopping.com|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its role as the [[trade association]] of the [[sex industry|adult entertainment industry]]&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; was taken over by the FSC, which acknowledges the AFAA as its first [[ancestor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freespeechcoalition.com/aboutus.htm History of the Free Speech Coalition], Archived at: {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513064546/http://www.freespeechcoalition.com/aboutus.htm |date=May 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AFAA award history===
[[Pornographic film actor|Pornographic actress]] [[Marilyn Chambers]] presented the very first award for [[#Best Picture|best erotic motion picture]] to the L. Sultana production of ''[[The Opening of Misty Beethoven]]'', while runner-up was ''Count the Ways'', produced by Virginia Ann Perry.&lt;ref name="afw1277" /&gt; [[Jennifer Welles]] and [[Jamie Gillis]] were the first winners in the [[#Best Actress|best actress]] and [[#Best Actor|best actor]] categories. Pornographic actor [[John Holmes (actor)|John Holmes]] told the crowd at the first year's awards, "In the not-too-far distant future we will proudly say that we were pioneers."&lt;ref name="afw1277" /&gt;

Retroactive awards of merit were also given to five movies considered best from 1955 to 1975: ''[[Tonight for Sure]]'', ''Not Tonight, Henry!'' ''[[Trader Hornee]]'' and ''Sometime Sweet Susan''. ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' was also honored as one of the top-grossing of all movies, including mainstream films, of [[1972 in film|1972]]. Board chairman Friedman said the AFAA was "much too busy fighting legal battles" in the early days to hold awards ceremonies, so these [[#Special Awards|special awards]] were intended to make up for not having presented them in the past.&lt;ref name="afw1277" /&gt;

For a time the most notable erotic film awards were those of the AFAA, considered to be "the closest thing the porn world's got to filmdom's [[Academy Award|Oscar]] derby."&lt;ref name="cheri0784" /&gt; Many stars would arrive in chauffeur-driven limousines while some would vie for attention by arriving in a four-horse [[carriage]], a Roman [[chariot]], a [[horse]] or even an [[elephant]].&lt;ref name="afwg0582"&gt;"The 5th Annual Erotica Awards", ''Adam Film World Guide'', May 1982, pp. 24-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The third annual awards "drew a festive crowd of some 600 porn-people plus several hundred hard-core fans to the [[Hollywood Palladium]]."&lt;ref name="afw0180" /&gt; Subsequent awards shows even attracted celebrities such as ''[[Godfather Trilogy|The Godfather]]'' director [[Francis Ford Coppola]],&lt;ref name="cheri0784" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afwg0884"&gt;Kent Smith, "The 8th Annual Erotica Awards", ''Adam Film World Guide'', Vol. 2, No. 2, August 1984, pp. 22–25.&lt;/ref&gt; singer [[Stephen Bishop (musician)|Stephen Bishop]]&lt;ref name="afwg0884" /&gt; and [[gonzo journalism|gonzo journalist]] [[Hunter S. Thompson]]&lt;ref name="cheri0187"&gt;[[Candida Royalle]], "Porn On Parade: The 1986 AFAA Awards", ''Cheri Magazine'', Vol. 11, No. 6, January 1987, pp.40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; to be part of the audience and comedian [[Jackie Gayle]]&lt;ref name="afwg0884" /&gt; and singer [[Jaye P. Morgan]] of ''[[The Gong Show]]'' to be part of evening's entertainment.&lt;ref name="afwg0582" /&gt; The fifth and eighth awards ceremonies were videotaped and offered to cable and subscription television&lt;ref name="rimmer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afwg0582" /&gt; and for sale on [[VHS]] cassettes while the seventh was taped for an August 1983 broadcast on [[Playboy TV]]. Other awards during the [[Golden Age of Porn|porno chic]] era included ''[[Adam Film World]]'s'' X-Caliber awards, first given out in 1975 and based on votes of fans,&lt;ref name="afw1277" /&gt; ''[[Hustler]]'' magazine's Erotic Movie Awards, first presented in 1977 and the [[Critics' Adult Film Association#CAFA Awards|Critics Adult Film Awards]], bestowed by a [[New York City|New York]]-based group of [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] adult sex film critics from 1981 to 1987.

By the third awards ceremony in 1980, although the concept was seen as positive, adult entertainment magazine ''[[Genesis (magazine)|Genesis]]'' reported they were "beginning to generate as much controversy as the regular [[Academy Award]]s, or more."&lt;ref name="genesis0180" /&gt; While it seemed "politicking" gave the Best Film award to ''Legend of Lady Blue'' over heavy favorites ''Sex World'' and ''Take Off'', the "most glaring lack of any validity" was shown by giving the best actor award to [[Aldo Ray]]. "The Erotica Awards are supposed to be presented to sex-film performers who both 'act' well and 'perform' well. In ''Sweet Savage'', not only did Aldo Ray not 'act' particularly well—his part was simply gratuitous...he never even performed at all. The fact is he never even took his clothes off, nor did he show up to receive his award."&lt;ref name="genesis0180" /&gt; Aside from that, ''Sweet Savage'' was released "well into 1979" and the films nominated were supposed to have been released in 1978, leaving the impression the AFAA gave him the award to "capitalize on his name and to obtain more media coverage."&lt;ref name="genesis0180" /&gt; ''Adam Film World Guide'', however, reported the following year's awards, which were presented in July 1981, "covered films released from mid-1980 to the middle of '81",&lt;ref name="afwg0582" /&gt; which could have meant ''Sweet Savage'' was eligible for awards in 1979 if the same time frame was considered. Meanwhile, ''Adam Film World'' noted Ray's award "was not surprising considering that one of the announced functions of the aFAA and its annual awards is to upgrade the image of the adult film industry in the public eye."&lt;ref name="afw0180" /&gt;

Originally the Erotica Awards were determined by vote of the "association's membership of more than 700 producers, distributors and theater operators."&lt;ref name="afwg0582" /&gt; However, in later years the AFAA ceremony was increasingly accused of bias, with a "belief among some that the West Coast producers were controlling what films received the awards" after ''Amanda By Night'' was passed over for best film at the 1981 awards.&lt;ref name="rimmer" /&gt; Starting with the awards presented in 1982, the AFAA decided to appoint an independent jury of three persons not associated with the adult film industry to make the final choices from the five finalists in each category.&lt;ref name="rimmer" /&gt; Jurors subsequently included an assortment of men and women such as a sexologist,&lt;ref name="cheri0186"&gt;"Film Strips: 'X' Marks the Spot," ''Cheri Magazine'', January 1986, pp. 12-19.&lt;/ref&gt; author [[Robert Rimmer]]&lt;ref name="rimmer" /&gt; and journalists such as [[Brendan Gill]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]''&lt;ref name="cheri0784" /&gt; and other publications including ''[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'' and the ''[[Los Angeles Herald Examiner]]''.&lt;ref name="afw0187" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afaa7"&gt;AFAA, "Seventh Annual Erotica Awards," official program, June 23, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, criticism continued, especially for the best erotic scene victory of ''Virginia'' in 1984, which led to the founding of the [[X-Rated Critics Organization]] and its [[XRCO Award|Heart-On Awards]].&lt;ref name="rimmer" /&gt; The role of adult film awards has been mostly supplanted by the [[AVN Awards]], which also launched in 1984.

=== Credo ===
The AFAA had a credo that "recognized the responsibilities of adult filmmakers to the general public":&lt;ref name="holliday"&gt;[[Jim Holliday]], ''Only the Best'', Cal Vista, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;
1. That films of adult subject matter will be produced for and exhibited to adult audiences and that persons not of legal age will not be admitted.
2. That the definition of an "adult" is that designation set by the constituted authorities of the community but in no event any persons under the age of 18 years.
3. That we will produce and exhibit only films that are in conformity with the Free Speech Provisions of the Constitution of the United States of America.
4. That we will respect the privacy of the general public in our advertising and public displays.
5. That we in ''no manner'' will condone, produce or exhibit child pornography in any form.

The AFAA awards were called the Erotic Film Awards and the trophy, known as the Erotica Award,&lt;ref name="afaa7" /&gt; was a golden statuette "in the form of a shapely nude holding high a rampant spear in an obvious attitude of erotic excitement."&lt;ref name="afw1277" /&gt; Winners are shown below in the year the awards were presented:

== Lifetime Achievement Awards ==
After the [[#Erotic_Film_Awards|Erotic Film Awards]] were discontinued, the association resumed presenting Lifetime Achievement Awards at its annual "Night of the Stars" fundraising event, starting in mid-1988. When the association merged into the [[Free Speech Coalition]] in late 1992, the new coalition took over the tradition.

==Notes==
{{Refbegin}}
{{note|suppactor|1}} ''Adam Film World'' recorded the winner of this category in 1979 as having been a tie between Roger Caine and John Seeman.&lt;ref name="afw0180" /&gt; ''Cinema-X'' magazine recorded Roger Caine as the sole winner.&lt;ref name="cinemax0180" /&gt;

{{note|language|2}} This award was called "Best Foreign Language Film" at the 1977 and 1981 awards shows. It was not awarded after 1981.

{{note|foreign|3}} IMDb states this movie, while advertised as the first X-rated movie made in Russia, was actually made in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0249711|Librianna, Bitch of the Black Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{note|year|4}} ''Adam Film World'' reported both ''Seven Into Snowy'' as winner of "Best Musical Score" and also ''Get Your Nose Out Of My Pantyhose'' won "Best Original Musical Score", a different award,&lt;ref name="afw0179" /&gt; in 1978. However, the AFAA's seventh and eighth annual programs, which list previous years' winners, make no mention of ''Get Your Nose Out of My Pantyhose'' or any separate "Original" score award. As well, IMDb states "Get Your Nose Out of My Pantyhose" is not a movie, but a song from a movie called ''Breaker Beauties'', so ''Adam Film World's'' report of an "Original" score award may be erroneous.

{{note|song|5}} The official 8th Annual AFAA Erotic Film Awards program lists both songs as having won the award,&lt;ref name="afaa8p" /&gt; however Jim Holliday's ''Only the Best'' book only mentions "With You" from ''Roommates'' as winning.&lt;ref name="holliday" /&gt; ''Cheri'' magazine's coverage of the awards doesn't mention the category at all.&lt;ref name="cheri0784" /&gt;

{{note|year|6}} This award was called "Best Production Values" at the 1979 and 1980 awards shows.&lt;ref name="pornstars8011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afaa7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afaa8p" /&gt;

{{note|year|7}} ''Adam Film World''&lt;ref name="afw1277" /&gt;' and ''Cinema Blue''&lt;ref name="cinemablue" /&gt; coverage of the first Erotica Awards both listed ''Not Tonight, Henry!'' as having won "Best Adult Film 1961-65" and ''Tonight For Sure'' as having won "Best Adult Film 1955-60". However, ''Not Tonight, Henry!'' premiered Dec. 30, 1960&lt;ref name="afi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/|title=AFI CATALOG|work=afi.com|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Los Angeles, while ''Tonight For Sure'' premiered in L.A., Oct. 25, 1962,&lt;ref name="afi" /&gt; so it's likely an error by the AFAA resulted in each film being given the award for the other's time period. Nominee ''Sinderella and the Golden Bra'' was listed in the correct time period. [[Jim Holliday]]'s book, ''Only the Best'', lists the movies as having won in the correct time periods, however.&lt;ref name="holliday" /&gt;

'''Ailsa Mellon Bruce''' (June 28, 1901 – August 25, 1969)&lt;ref name="AMBObit1969"/&gt; was a prominent American socialite and philanthropist who established the [[Avalon Foundation]].&lt;ref name="AMBObit1969"/&gt;

==Early life==
Ailsa was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, on June 28, 1901. She was the daughter of the banker and diplomat [[Andrew W. Mellon]] and Nora Mary ([[née]] McMullen) Mellon (1879–1937). Her parents divorced in 1912 and from 1921 to 1932, Ailsa served as her father's official hostess during his tenure as [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], and again when he was [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] in 1932–1933. Her only sibling was brother [[Paul Mellon]] (1907–1999), who was also a philanthropist and was known as a prominent owner/breeder of [[thoroughbred racehorses]].&lt;ref name="PMObit1999"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Russell|first1=John|title=Paul Mellon, Patrician Champion Of Art and National Gallery, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/03/books/paul-mellon-patrician-champion-of-art-and-national-gallery-dies.html|accessdate=16 April 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ailsa attended [[Miss Porter's School]] in [[Farmington, Connecticut]] and spent her summers as a teenager in Europe.&lt;ref name="AMBObit1969"/&gt;

==Philanthropy and legacy==
Bruce established the [[Avalon Foundation]] in 1940, which made [[Grant (money)|grants]] to colleges and [[universities]], [[medical school]]s and [[hospital]]s, [[youth program]]s and [[community services]], [[Church body|churches]], [[environmentalist|environmental projects]], and an array of cultural and [[fine arts|arts organization]]s. In 1947, the Avalon Foundation was instrumental in the establishment of the [[Hampton National Historic Site]] in [[Maryland]].&lt;ref name="Brown1969"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Nona B.|title=18th-Century Indulgence Becomes a 20th-Century Showplace|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/10/19/archives/18thcentury-indulgence-becomes-a-20thcentury-showplace.html|accessdate=16 April 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=19 October 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, when ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' prepared its first list of the [[Wealthiest Americans (1957)|wealthiest Americans]], it estimated that Ailsa Mellon Bruce, her brother, [[Paul Mellon|Paul]], and her cousins, [[Sarah Mellon]] and [[Richard King Mellon]], were all among the richest eight people in the United States, with fortunes of between 400 and 700 million dollars each.  In 1968, Ailsa and Paul donated $20 million to build an annex to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="AMBObit1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robertson1969"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Nan|title=National Gallery Honors a Patron|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/09/01/archives/national-gallery-honors-a-patron.html|accessdate=16 April 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1 September 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At her death in 1969, Ailsa Bruce bequeathed 153 [[paintings]], primarily by 19th-century [[French Artists|French artists]], to the [[National Gallery of Art]], as well as establishing a fund for future acquisitions. Among the many works acquired by the Gallery through the Ailsa Mellon Bruce Fund was the portrait of ''[https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.50724.html Ginevra de' Benci]'', the only painting by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/features/slideshows/founding-benefactors-of-the-national-gallery-of-art.html|title=Founding Benefactors of the National Gallery of Art|website=www.nga.gov|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, the assets of [[Paul Mellon]]’s Old Dominion Foundation were merged into his sister's Avalon Foundation, which was renamed the [[Andrew W.

[[File:Alain Zimmermann with Gwyneth Paltrow.jpg|thumb|left|Alain Zimmermann with Baume &amp; Mercier ambassador [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] at the 2011 Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]]]
Zimmermann first began his career at [[L’Oréal]] Germany in 1989. Having initially signed with the company for a 16-month V.S.N.C (Voluntary National Service Company), he went on the stay with L’Oréal until 1995. At L’Oréal he encountered the world of luxury products, marketing their leading perfumes including [[Paloma Picasso]], [[Armani]] and [[Ralph Lauren]].&lt;ref name="worldtempus"/&gt;

In 1995, Alain Zimmermann joined the jewelry and watch brand [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]] in Germany. Four years later he transferred from [[Munich]] to [[Paris]], where he was appointed to International Development Director of the Cartier perfume range.&lt;ref name="worldtempus"/&gt;

Zimmermann joined [[International Watch Company|IWC]], the luxury watchmakers from [[Schaffhausen]], in 2002.

'''''Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd''''',&lt;ref name="Baxter"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|38|2007|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |date=29 August 2007 ||parralelcite=(2007)&amp;nbsp;232&amp;nbsp;[[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Baxter'') was a decision of the [[High Court of Australia]], which ruled on 29 August 2007 that Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited, a [[tendering|tenderer]] for various government contracts, was bound by the ''[[Trade Practices Act 1974]]'' (TPA, Australian legislation governing anti-competitive behaviour) in its trade and commerce in tendering for government contracts. More generally, the case concerned the principles of derivative [[Crown immunity|governmental immunity]]:&lt;ref&gt;There are differing opinions whether the immunity in Australia should be referred to as "Crown immunity" or "governmental immunity". For example, {{Harvnb|Wright|2008}} refers to governmental immunity; while {{Harvnb|Seddon|2009}} refers to Crown immunity. Without judging the merits of which term is more appropriate, this article uses "governmental immunity"&lt;/ref&gt; whether the immunity of a government from a statute extends to third parties that conduct business with the government.

The High Court's judgment marked a successful appeal for the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]], the Australian regulator of anti-competitive conduct, having lost at first instance and on appeal in the [[Federal Court of Australia]]. The ACCC was again successful when the case was remitted to the Federal Court for reconsideration, ending eight years of litigation between the parties. The High Court's judgment was received as a significant precedent in the law of derivative governmental immunity in Australia.

==Background==

===Facts===
Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited (Baxter), was the Australian subsidiary of the multinational health care company [[Baxter International]]. Baxter manufactured [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] (IV) and [[peritoneal dialysis]] (PD) fluids at various plants in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|FCA|581|2005|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[6]-[7] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the cost of importing sterile IV fluids and the absence of a rival domestic producer, Baxter was a monopoly supplier of sterile IV fluids in the Australian market. Its monopoly covered large volume parenteral fluids, irrigating solutions and [[Parenteral nutrition|parenteral nutrition fluids]]. However, Baxter faced competition in the market for [[peritoneal dialysis]] fluids (PD fluids).{{sfn|Duns|2008|p=51}}

A number of [[States and territories of Australia|state governments]] issued [[tendering|requests for tender]] for the supply of sterile fluids and PD fluids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|38|2007|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[10]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Baxter responded to the requests with tenders that put forward two alternative pricing options: either a state could purchase sterile fluids and PD fluids as a bundled package at a discounted rate, or the state could buy each product separately but at a higher rate.{{sfn|Corones|2007|p=374}}

===Legislation===
Section&amp;nbsp;46 of the TPA prohibited corporations from misusing market power.&lt;ref name="TPA s46"&gt;''Trade Practices Act'' 1974 (Cth) {{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2010C00623/Html/Volume_1#param355 |title=s.46 Misuse of market power}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Section&amp;nbsp;47 prohibited [[exclusive dealing]].&lt;ref name="TPA s47"&gt;''Trade Practices Act'' 1974 (Cth) {{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2010C00623/Html/Volume_1#param358 |title=s.47 Exclusive dealing}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The critical provision to the case was Section&amp;nbsp;2B of the TPA. Section&amp;nbsp;2B provided that Sections&amp;nbsp;46 and 47 of the TPA:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... bind the Crown in right of each of the States, of the Northern Territory and of the Australian Capital Territory, so far as the Crown carries on a business, either directly or by an authority of the State or Territory ...&lt;ref name="TPA s2B"&gt;''Trade Practices Act'' 1974 (Cth) {{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2010C00623/Html/Volume_1#param4 |title=s.2B  Application of Act to States and Territories}} which provides that the Crown is bound by Part IV of the TPA, which includes Sections&amp;nbsp;46 and 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section&amp;nbsp;2B thus provided an immunity from state and territory governments from Sections&amp;nbsp;46 and 47 of the TPA insofar as the governments were not carrying on a business.

===The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission===
The [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC), the Australian government authority responsible for regulating the TPA, commenced an action in the [[Federal Court of Australia]] seeking declarations that Baxter's bundling pricing structure in its tenders had contravened [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare#Legislation|Sections&amp;nbsp;46 and 47]] of the TPA. The ACCC sought the imposition of injunctions and pecuniary penalties by the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|FCA|581|2005|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[1] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Derivative governmental immunity before ''Baxter''===
Derivative governmental immunity refers to the extension of a government's immunity from a statute to a non-government party on the basis the government would be affected if the statute was to apply to the other party.{{sfn|Wright|2008|p=116}}

Prior to ''Baxter'', the leading case on derivative governmental immunity in Australia was the 1979 High Court judgment in ''Bradken Consolidated Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|15|1979|litigants=Bradken Consolidated Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd |parallelcite=(1979) 145 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 107 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wright|2008|pp=116–120}}{{sfn|Heydon|1989|p=[2.115]}} In ''Bradken'', the High Court upheld a claim for derivative governmental immunity by equipment suppliers to the Queensland Commissioner for Railways. The majority's conclusion was that if the Queensland government was immune from the TPA, it would prejudice the Queensland government if the contracts and arrangements it entered were subject to the TPA through the other parties to the contracts and arrangements.{{sfn|Wright|2008|pp=116–117}}

''Bradken'''s application of the principle of derivative governmental immunity had been subject to criticism. Robertson Wright SC, a [[Senior Counsel]] specialising in competition and trade practices law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://12thfloor.com.au/robertson-wright.htm|title=Robertson Wright SC|publisher=Wentworth Selborne Chambers (12th floor)|accessdate=13 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112013720/http://www.12thfloor.com.au/robertson-wright.htm|archivedate=12 November 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued there are "a number of difficulties" with the judgment, including the "unsatisfactory nature" of the authorities it relied on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2008|p=117}}. Wright details his criticisms in {{citation|last=Wright|first=Robertson|year=2007|title=The future of Derivative Crown Immunity—with a competition law perspective|journal=Competition and Consumer Law Journal |publisher=Lexis Nexis Australia |location=Sydney |volume=14 |page=240 |issn=1039-5598 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court's judgment in ''Baxter'' would mark a retreat from ''Bradken''.{{sfn|Corones|2007|p=375}}

===Federal Court litigation===
The ACCC conceded that the state governments were not carrying on businesses in procuring the medical products. This meant that the governments were immune from Sections&amp;nbsp;46 and 47 of the TPA. Baxter argued that this immunity extended to itself, by claiming derivative governmental immunity.{{sfn|Seddon|2009|p=168}} On 16 May 2005, The [[Federal Court of Australia]] ([[James Allsop|Allsop J]] presiding) found in Baxter's favour at first instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|FCA|581|2005|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the court held that Baxter would have breached the TPA, governmental immunity under Section&amp;nbsp;2B extended to Baxter Healthcare.{{sfn|Corones|2007|p=374}} Allsop J's judgment was upheld unanimously on appeal to the full bench of the Federal Court (Justices [[John Mansfield (judge)|Mansfield]], [[John Dowsett|Dowsett]] and [[Roger Gyles|Gyles]] presiding).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|FCAFC|128|2006|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[1] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The full bench expressed unease about its own judgment, stating that the question of derivative governmental immunity should be left to the High Court for reconsideration of ''Bradken''.{{sfn|Wright|2008|p=122}}

==High Court appeal==
The ACCC was granted special leave to appeal to the High Court against the judgment of the full bench of the Federal Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCATrans|60|2007|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |courtname=auto |date=9 February 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal was heard on 16 May 2007. The [[Australian Government Solicitor]] acted for the ACCC, with [[Lindsay Foster]] as [[Senior Counsel]]; [[Blake Dawson]] and [[David Yates (judge)|David Yates SC]] represented Baxter. In addition to Baxter, the states of Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales were respondents to the appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCATrans|202|2007|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |courtname=auto |date=15 May 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court decided on 29 August 2007, by a 6–1 majority, to allow the ACCC's appeal and remit the matter back to the full bench of Federal Court for reconsideration. The majority held that Baxter was not covered by derivative governmental immunity in its dealings with the state governments.&lt;ref name="Baxter"/&gt;

===Judgments===

====Joint judgment====
Five judges ([[Chief Justice of Australia|Chief Justice]] [[Murray Gleeson|Gleeson]] and Justices [[William Gummow|Gummow]], [[Kenneth Hayne|Hayne]], [[Dyson Heydon|Heydon]] and [[Susan Crennan|Crennan]]) joined in the leading majority judgment allowing the ACCC's appeal. The joint judgment reasoned that Parliament could not have intended for corporations that do business with the government to be exempt from the restrictive trade practices provisions in Part&amp;nbsp;IV of the TPA in respect of that business. Emphasising the overall purpose of the TPA, the judges reasoned that the purpose would not be fulfilled if Baxter could claim derivative immunity.{{sfn|Seddon|2009|p=169}} In response to the concern that one party to a transaction (the government) would be immune from the TPA while the other party would be bound by it, the joint judgment reasoned there was "nothing unusual" about such an outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|38|2007|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[44]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The joint judgment did not rule out derivative governmental immunity in all cases. In determining the scope of whether governmental immunity from a statutory provision extends to a party dealing with the government, the judgment adopted the following position of Justice [[Frank Kitto|Kitto]], then dissenting, in the 1955 High Court case of ''Wynyard Investments v Commissioner for Railways (NSW)'':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|72|1955|litigants=Wynyard Investments v Commissioner for Railways |date=15 December 1955 ||parallelcite=(1955)&amp;nbsp;93&amp;nbsp;[[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 376 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Corones|2007|p=376}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;The object in view is to ascertain whether the Crown has such an interest in that which would be interfered with if the provision in question were held to bind the corporation that the interference would be, for a legal reason, an interference with some right, interest, power, authority, privilege, immunity or purpose belonging or appertaining to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|72|1955|litigants=Wynyard Investments v Commissioner for Railways |pinpoint=[9] per Kitto J }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Wynyard Investments'' was a case about governmental immunity generally (not derivative governmental immunity specifically), but Justice Kitto's dissenting judgment extended to derivative governmental immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|72|1955|litigants=Wynyard Investments v Commissioner for Railways |pinpoint=[5] per Kitto J }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having examined the characteristics of the TPA as a law to promote competitive behaviour, the joint judgment held that the extension of derivative governmental immunity from the TPA to a trading corporation would be a "remarkable" conclusion and "far beyond what is necessary to protect the legal rights of governments, or to prevent a divesting of proprietary, contractual or other legal rights and interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|38|2007|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[64]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kirby J====
[[Michael Kirby (judge)|Justice Kirby]]'s judgment agreed with the outcome of the joint judgment, for different reasons. Kirby criticised the concept of governmental immunity itself, stating that "persisting with [governmental immunity] into the twenty-first century is unacceptable."{{sfn|Duns|2008|pp=53–4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|38|2007|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |pinpoint=[97]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Callinan J====
[[Ian Callinan|Justice Callinan]] dissented from the majority, holding that derivative governmental immunity extended to Baxter. Callinan followed ''Bradken'', concluding that it remained authoritative.{{sfn|Duns|2008|pp=53–4}}

==Reaction to judgment==

===Significance===
Robertson Wright, writing after the judgment was handed down, claimed that ''Baxter'' represented a change to the law, drawing the following conclusions from the judgment:
* The application of derivative governmental immunity depends on a construction of the particular statute (particularly the object and purpose of the statute).
* As a general rule, derivative governmental immunity applies if the statute's coverage of a person would divest the government of proprietary, contractual, or other legal rights or interests (as opposed to commercial or policy rights or interests).{{sfn|Wright|2008|p=126}}

The judgment was reported in the press as a significant legal victory for the ACCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/business/back-to-the-trade-law-books-as-samuel-scores/2007/08/29/1188067191295.html|title=Back to the trade law books as Samuel scores|work = [[Brisbane Times]]|last=Maiden|first=Malcolm|date=29 August 2007|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judgment was also received as an "historic decision" setting a precedent for government procurement, on the basis that businesses might no longer be able to rely on immunity from the TPA when contracting with governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/businesses-could-lose-immunity-after-ruling/2007/08/29/1188067189790.html|title=Businesses could lose immunity after ruling|work =[[The Age]]|last=Murphy|first=Mathew|date=30 August 2007|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Nicholas Seddon, a lawyer and academic specialising in commercial and government law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blakedawson.com/Templates/Profiles/x_profile_content_page.aspx?id=8833|title=Nicholas Seddon: Special Counsel, Canberra|publisher=[[Blake Dawson]]|accessdate=13 January 2010}} At the time of writing his criticisms, Seddon was an employee of [[Blake Dawson]], the firm that represented Baxter throughout the Federal Court and High Court litigation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.anu.edu.au/scripts/StaffDetails.asp?StaffID=358|title=ANU College of Law: Our Staff|publisher=[[Australian National University]]|accessdate=13 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710032458/http://law.anu.edu.au/scripts/StaffDetails.asp?StaffID=358|archivedate=10 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed the High Court's judgment leaves "many uncertainties", particularly regarding whether derivative governmental immunity will extend to private sector providers carrying out governmental functions that have been contracted to them (as opposed to merely providing goods or services to the government).{{sfn|Seddon|2009|p=171}} Robertson Wright echoed these concerns, arguing the joint judgment did not "set out in as helpful detail" as it might the factors to be taken into account in deciding whether governmental immunity will derive to a party dealing with the government.{{sfn|Wright|2008|pp=126–127}} Seddon also criticised the outcome of the case itself, arguing it is "difficult to see how derivative immunity does not inevitably flow" from the governmental immunity from the TPA. He suggested that the application of the TPA to a party that deals with a government compromises the intention of Parliament that State and Territory governments should be immune from the TPA.{{sfn|Seddon|2009|p=170}}

==Later action==
The ACCC was successful, by a 2–1 majority, upon the remittal of the case to the full bench of the Federal Court. The full bench found that Baxter contravened Sections&amp;nbsp;46 and 47 of the TPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|FCAFC|141|2008|litigants=ACCC v Baxter Healthcare |date=11 August 2008 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That judgment ended the eight-year-long litigation between Baxter and the ACCC. It was the first time in over 10 years that a corporation had unsuccessfully defended a prosecution brought by the ACCC for an alleged contravention of Section&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The '''Australian dividend imputation system''' is a [[corporate tax]] system in which some or all of the tax paid by a company may be attributed, or [[imputation (economics)|imputed]], to the shareholders by way of a [[tax credit]] to reduce the income tax payable on a distribution. In comparison to the classical system, [[dividend imputation]] reduces or eliminates the tax disadvantages of distributing dividends to shareholders by only requiring them to pay the difference between the corporate rate and their marginal rate.

The objective of the dividend imputation system is to eliminate [[double taxation]] of company profits, once at the corporate level and again on distribution as dividend to shareholders. More specifically, it is intended to create a "[[level playing field]]" by taxing the same activity in the same way, irrespective of the business structure being used, namely a company or trust, [[sole trader]] or [[partnership]]. Under the previous system, the company and shareholders had an incentive for the taxed income of the company to be retained by the company. 

==History ==
{{main|Australian corporate tax rate}}
Before 1987, an Australian company would pay [[corporate tax|company tax]] on its profits at a flat rate of 49%; and if it then paid a dividend, that dividend was taxed again as income for the shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;Act No. 59 of 1987&lt;/ref&gt; The company and shareholders had an incentive for the taxed income of the company to be retained by the company. Paying a dividend gave raise to [[double taxation]], once by the company at the corporate rate and then on dividend income in the hands of the company’s shareholders. 

Dividend imputation was introduced in Australia in 1987 to stop this effect and create a "level playing field". The company tax rate was reduced to 39% in 1988 and 33% in 1993, and increased again in 1995 to 36%, to be reduced to 34% in 2000 and 30% in 2001.&lt;ref name="Reinhardt and Steel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.treasury.gov.au/documents/1156/HTML/docshell.asp?URL=01_Brief_History.asp|title=Economic Roundup Winter 2006: A brief history of Australia’s tax system|publisher=Australian Government &amp;#124; The Treasury|last1=Reinhardt|first1=Sam|last2=Steel|first2=Lee|date=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/factcheck/2016-06-29/fact-check-labor-on-corporate-tax-cuts/7549754|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|title=Fact check: Did Labor previously make the same arguments as the Government on company tax?|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dividend imputation was introduced in 1987, one of a number of tax reforms by the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]]–[[Paul Keating|Keating]] Labor Government. Prior to that a company would pay company tax on its profits and if it then paid a dividend, that dividend was taxed again as income for the shareholder, i.e. a part owner of the company, a form of [[double taxation]].&lt;ref&gt;Act No. 59 of 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the eligibility rules (below) were introduced by the [[John Howard|Howard]]–[[Peter Costello|Costello]] Liberal Government, with a $2,000 small shareholder exemption. In 1999 that exemption was raised to the present $5,000. In 2000, franking credits became fully refundable, not just reducing tax liability to zero. In 2002, preferential dividend streaming was banned. In 2003, [[New Zealand]] companies could elect to join the system for Australian tax they paid.

From 2015/16, designated "small business entities" with an aggregated annual turnover threshold of less than $2 million were eligible for a lower tax rate of 28.5%. Since 1 July 2016, small business entities with aggregated annual turnover of less than $10 million have had a reduced company tax rate of 27.5%. Additionally, the Australian Government announced that from 2017/18, corporate entities eligible for the lower tax rate will be known as "base rate entities". The small business definition will remain at $10 million from 2017–18 onwards, however the base rate entity threshold (the aggregated annual turnover threshold under which entities will be eligible to pay a lower tax rate) will continue to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Direct-taxes/Income-tax-for-businesses/Reducing-the-corporate-tax-rate/|title=Reducing the corporate tax rate|date=4 July 2017|publisher=Australian Taxation Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
The present operation of the system is as follows. The actual law is complex, the core is in the [[Income Tax Assessment Act 1936]] and other elements are in the [[Income Tax Assessment Act 1997]].

Australian companies that have paid Australian company tax can declare how much of the tax it paid is to be imputed or associated with any dividend it pays. Dividends with the maximum imputed tax amount are called franked dividends, while any other dividends are unfranked. [[Income tax in Australia#Residency for tax purposes|Australian-resident shareholders]] who receive franked dividends from Australian companies would declare both the dividends and the associated imputation credits (as well as the unfranked dividends) on their tax returns, but are entitled to claim back a tax credit (called a franking credit) on those imputation credits.

Initially, in 1987, excess franking credits over the tax liability were lost, but since 2000, such excess credits have been refundable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Investing/In-detail/Investing-in-shares/Refunding-franking-credits---individuals/|title=Refunding excess franking credits – individuals|date=28 June 2017|publisher=Australian Taxation Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-resident shareholders are not entitled to claim a tax credit or refund of imputation credits. Unfranked dividends received by non-residents are subject to a [[withholding tax]], which does not apply to franked dividends.

Say, a company makes a profit of $100 and pays company tax of $30 (at 2006 rates) and records the $30 in the franking account. The $30 is paid to the tax office. The company now has $70 left to pay a dividend, either in the same year or later years. When it does so, it may attach a franking credit from its franking account, in proportion to the tax rate. So if it pays a $70 dividend it could attach $30 of franking credits. When the dividend is paid, the franking account is debited by $30.

An eligible shareholder receiving a franked dividend declares the cash amount plus the franking credit as income, and is credited with the franking credit against their final tax bill. The effect is as if the tax office reversed the company tax by giving back the $30 to the shareholder and had them treat the original $100 of profit as income, in the shareholder's hands, like the company was merely a conduit.

Thus company profits going to eligible shareholders are taxed just once. Profits are either retained by the company and taxed there at the corporate rate, or paid out later as dividends and instead they're taxed at the shareholder's rate.

Dividends may still be paid by a company when it has no franking credits (perhaps because it has been making tax losses), this is called an ''unfranked dividend''. Or it may pay a franked portion and an unfranked portion, known as ''partly franked''. An unfranked dividend (or the unfranked portion) is [[ordinary income]] in the hands of the shareholder.

== Franking credits ==
Companies can determine the proportion of the [[dividend]]s they pay will have franking credits attach. This can range from the dividend being fully franked to it being entirely unfranked. A franking credit is a nominal unit of tax paid by companies using dividend imputation. 

[[Shareholder]]s who are [[Income tax in Australia#Residence|residents of Australia for tax purposes]] include in their assessable [[income]] the '''grossed-up''' dividend amount (being the total of the dividend payable plus the associated franking credits). The [[income tax]] payable by the shareholders is calculated, and the franking credits are applied to offset the tax payable. In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] the end result is the elimination of [[double taxation]] of company profits.

===Franking credit formula===
For a company that pays tax on all its income in Australia, the franking proportion is usually 100% (or 1). However, some companies (particularly those paying tax outside of Australia) have a lower franking proportion. 

====Fully-franked dividend====
'''Franking Credits = (Dividend Amount / (1 − Company Tax Rate)) − Dividend Amount'''

Example - a company pays a 30% company tax rate and distributes a $7.00 dividend to shareholders:

Franking Credits = ($7.00 / (1 − 0.3)) − $7.00

&lt;nowiki&gt;= ($7.00 / (0.7)) − $7.00&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;= $10.00 − $7.00&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;= $3.00&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Franking Credits = $3.00

The shareholder is credited $3.00.

====Partially-franked dividend====
'''Franking Credits from Partial Franking = ((Dividend Amount / (1 − Company Tax Rate)) − Dividend Amount) × Franking Proportion'''

Example - a company pays a 30% company tax rate but is only eligible for 50% franking and distributed a $7.00 dividend to shareholders:

Franking Credits from Partial Franking = (($7.00 / (1 − 0.3)) − $7.00) × 0.5

&lt;nowiki&gt;= (($7.00 / (0.7)) − $7.00) × 0.5&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;= ($10.00 − $7.00) × 0.5&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;= $3.00 × 0.5&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;= $1.50&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Franking Credits from Partial Franking = $1.50

The shareholder is credited $1.50.

== Refund ==
Franking credits on dividends received after 1 July 2000 are refundable [[tax credit]]s. It is a form of tax prepayment, which can reduce a taxpayer's total tax liability, with any excess being refunded. For example, an individual with income below the [[tax-free threshold]] ($18,200 since 2011/12) will pay no tax at all and can get a refund of the franking credits in full, after a tax return is lodged.

Prior to 1 July 2000 such excess franking credits were lost. For example, an individual at that time paying no tax would get nothing back, and would merely keep the cash part of the dividend received.

== Investors ==
A franking credit is income received by the shareholder, though it is not paid in cash. It is a credit towards tax that may be payable by the shareholder. Thus a franked dividend of $0.70 plus a $0.30 franking credit is equivalent to an unfranked dividend of $1.00, or to bank [[interest]] of $1.00, or any other ordinary income of that amount. (It is exactly equivalent because franking credits are fully refundable, as described above.)

Franked dividends are often described as a "tax effective" form of income. The basis for this is that the cash $0.70 looks like it is taxed at a lower rate than other income. For example, for an individual on the top rate of 48.5% (for 2006) the calculation is $0.70 plus $0.30 credit is $1.00 on which $0.485 tax is payable, but less the $0.30 credit makes $0.185 net tax, which is just 26.4% of the original $0.70. Conversely, an individual on the 20% marginal tax rate actually gets a $0.10 rebate. In this latter case, the rebate looks very much like negative tax.

There's nothing inherently wrong with the latter way of thinking about franked dividends, and it is frequently made to demonstrate how franking benefits the investor, but it can be argued a grossing-up like the former is better when comparing yields across different investment opportunities.

==Restrictions on eligibility ==
There are restrictions on who can claim franking credits. Those who cannot claim the credit simply declare as income the cash part of the dividend amount received, and ignore the franking credit on the tax return. The "holding period rule" has applied since 1 July 2000. Its objective is to prevent traders buying shares on the last cum-dividend date and selling them the following day ex-dividend. The typical result would be that the trader would receive the dividend, together with the franking credits, while incurring an equivalent capital loss and qualifying for the franking credit with only overnight risk in holding the shares. 

An eligible shareholder is one who either:

* holds the shares for a continuous period of 45 days or more (not counting purchase and sale days); or 90 days in the case of certain [[preferred stock|preference share]]s. This is the "holding period rule". Shares must be "at risk" for the necessary period, i.e. not with an offsetting [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]s position for instance, or 

* has total franking credits for the tax year of less than $5000 (the "small shareholder exemption") and has not arranged to pass-on the benefits to someone else (the "related payments rule").

Thus franking credits are not available to short-term traders, only to longer term holders, but with small holders exempted provided it's for their own benefit.

The small shareholder exemption is not a "first $5000", but rather once the $5000 threshold is passed the rule is inoperative and all the shares are under the holding period rule.

For the holding period rule, parcels of shares bought and sold at different times are reckoned on a "first in, last out" basis. Each sale is taken to be of the most recently purchased shares. This prevents a taxpayer buying just before a dividend, selling just after, and asserting it was older shares sold (to try to fulfill the holding period).

This "first in, last out" reckoning may be contrasted with [[capital gains tax]]. For capital gains the shareholder can nominate what parcel was sold from among those bought at different times.

== Company shareholders ==
A dividend received by a company shareholder is income of the receiving company, but the dividend income is not grossed-up for the franking credit nor is the receiving company entitled to claim the franking credit as a tax credit. Instead, the franking credit is added directly to the receiving company's franking account, and can be paid out in the same way as franking credits generated by the receiving company.

This transfer of credits has made the previous "intercorporate rebates" allowances redundant.  Those rebates had avoided double taxation on dividends paid from one company to another company. Those rebates were part of the original 1936 Taxation Act (section 46), meaning that the principle of eliminating double taxation has been present to some degree in Australian income tax law for a very long time.

The company tax rate has changed a few times since the introduction of dividend imputation. In each case transitional rules have been made to maintain the principle of reversing the original tax paid, even if the tax rate has changed. This has been either by separate franking accounts for separate rates (e.g. class A 39%, class B 33%), or making an adjusting recalculation of the credits (e.g. into class C 30%).

== Trans-Tasman Imputation ==
[[New Zealand]] companies can apply to join the Australian dividend imputation system (from 2003).  Doing so allows them to attach Australian franking credits to their dividends, for Australian tax they have paid.  Those credits can then be used by shareholders who are Australian taxpayers, the same as dividends from an Australian company.

There are certain anti-tax-avoidance rules to prevent New Zealand companies deliberately streaming Australian franking credits towards their Australian shareholders; credits must be distributed on a pro-rata basis.

Note that it is only Australian franking credits which can be used by an Australian taxpayer.  New Zealand imputation credits on dividends paid to an Australian shareholder cannot be used against that shareholder's Australian taxes.

==Dividend streaming==
A company can determine the level of franking credits it will attach to its dividends, and they are not obliged to attach any franking credits. However, it costs the company nothing to attach the maximum amounts of credits it has available, which is the usual practice to benefit eligible shareholders. It is actually possible for a company to attach more franking credits than it has, but doing so attracts certain tax penalties.

Until 2002 it was permissible for companies to direct the flow of franking credits preferentially to one type of shareholder over another so that each could benefit the most as fits their tax circumstances. For example, franking credits are of no use to foreign shareholders, who cannot offset them against [[withholding tax]], but Australian shareholders can claim them as a tax credit. This practice, known as ''dividend streaming'', became illegal in 2002, after which all dividends within a given time frame must be franked to a similar (but need not be identical) degree irrespective of shareholder location or which class of shares they hold.

Division 7A of the Tax Act applies where there is a loan, payment or the forgiveness of a loan to a shareholder or an associate of a shareholder of a private company.&lt;ref&gt;ATO, [https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Private-company-benefits---Division-7A-dividends/In-detail/Division-7A---Loans/ Loans by private companies]&lt;/ref&gt; When such amounts are not repaid by the end of a financial year they may be treated as unfranked dividends. The total of all dividends a private company can be taken to pay under Division 7A is limited to its "distributable surplus" for that income year, which includes the retained earnings plus provisions made for accounting purposes.&lt;ref&gt;ATO, [https://www.ato.gov.au/business/private-company-benefits---division-7a-dividends/in-detail/division-7a---distributable-surplus/ Distributable surplus]&lt;/ref&gt;

An ‘associate’ is very broad and generally includes a trust under which a shareholder can benefit.&lt;ref&gt;ATO, [https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Private-company-benefits---Division-7A-dividends/Entities-and-taxpayers-affected/ Entities and taxpayers affected]&lt;/ref&gt; This will mean that Division 7A can apply to loans to discretionary trusts and unit trusts in the family group, and sometimes to such trusts not in a family group.

== Effective elimination of company tax and thus incentives ==
To a large extent, dividend imputation makes company tax irrelevant.  This is because every dollar that a company pays in company tax can be claimed by the shareholder as franking credit, with no net revenue flowing to the government.  (There are exceptions which include profits retained by the company that are never paid as dividends, and payments to international investors.)

When gross company tax is reported by Treasury, it is unclear whether the number generally includes the effect of the corresponding franking credits.

One effect is that this has reduced the effectiveness of tax [[incentives]] for corporations. If a corporation was given a tax break then its incomes thus released from taxation would not generate franking credits precisely because no tax was paid. In turn, this meant that the shareholders received fewer credits along with their dividends, meaning in turn that they had to pay more tax.

The net result is that each tax break a corporation itself got was countered by a matching increase in the tax burden of shareholders, leaving shareholders in exactly the same position had no tax break been received by the corporation. Thus, to the extent that corporate directors acted so as to [[increase shareholder wealth]], tax incentives would not influence [[corporate behaviour]].

== Politics and economics ==
&lt;!-- this section previously asserted that the [[Australian Democrats]] are opposed to imputation, but enquiries to them show that this is not the case --&gt;

Dividend imputation has been uncontroversial over most of its lifetime.  Investors and their advisors recognise the benefits and are supportive.

In October 2006, the [[Committee for Economic Development of Australia]] released a report, [http://www.lateraleconomics.com.au/outputs/CEDA%20Tax%20cuts%20to%20compete.pdf ''Tax Cuts to Compete''], concluding that dividend imputation had proved an inefficient means of reducing Australia's cost of capital. The report, authored by prominent economist Dr Nicholas Gruen, argued that the elimination of imputation would allow the funding of a substantial corporate tax cut. This would attract foreign investment and thus increase economic growth, it said.

The '''British Numismatic Trade Association''' is an association formed by a majority of the leading [[United Kingdom]] [[coin dealer]]s. Originally formed to represent the trade in discussions with [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise|UK Customs &amp; Excise]] regarding [[value-added tax]] on coins, it has developed, becoming a part of the fight against forgery, theft and other criminal activities.  This helped to establish a benchmark for the highest [[ethics|ethic]]al standards in the domestic coin trade.  Members adhere to a strict code of ethics which is a benchmark for the trade.  Members receive early warning notices of [[counterfeit]] coins and stolen property.  The BNTA organise the biggest International coin and medal bourse in the UK called COINEX which is held in late September or early October in Mayfair, London annually and it hosts up to 100 British and foreign dealers for a two-day show, this event promotes a range of auction in London during the preceding week and sales can top £10 million during that week..

The BNTA is a member of FENAP, the [[Federation of European Numismatic Associations]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2460">'''Business France''' is a French Government agency created on 1 January 2015 through a merger between UBIFRANCE and the French Agency for International Investment (InvestInFrance). It has the status of a public institution of an industrial and commercial character under the supervision of the [[French Ministry for the Economy and Finance|Ministry of Economy and Finance]], the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development]] and the Ministry of Rural Spatial Planning and Development Territory.

Business France's Chairman is [[Pascal Cagni]] and Director General is [[Christophe Lecourtier]].

Business France work is divided into four main pillars: 1) promote French exports; 2) promote inward investments to France; 3) enable international internships in French companies abroad, also open to candidates from the European Economic Area. The international internship is called VIE, which stands for” Volontariat International en Entreprises”); and 4) promote the image of France as business country.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.businessfrance.fr/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
'''Ubifrance''' was the French agency for export promotion. It succeeded the "Centre Français du commerce extérieur"(CFCE).
Its headquarters is on Boulevard Saint-Jacques, [[14th arrondissement of Paris]], but it is also based in the [[World Trade Center of Grenoble]].  UBIFrance has 66 economic missions in 46 countries and more than 1,400 employees in France and abroad responsible for helping French companies in their international development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ubifrance.fr/qui-sommes-nous-un-reseau-dedie-a-l-exportation.html&lt;/ref&gt;  France's budget bill for 2011 authorized €105,398,000 for the agency.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/budget/plf2011/a2860-tv.asp#P782_63069&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 2015, UBIFRANCE merged with InvestInFrance and became Business France.&lt;ref&gt;http://namesorts.com/2014/12/21/business-france-the-new-organization-to-turn-france-into-a-fdi-magnet/ Business France, the new organization to turn France into a FDI Magnet&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a term used in the [[Retailing|retail]] industry.   [[Retailing|Retailers]] contract with their [[Supply chain|suppliers]] to supply a quantity of product in a specified time period to a specific location at an agreed price.  The quantity and value of the [[balance of contract]] represents a risk to the retailer from the point of view that the retailer will have to discount a product that experiences a [[Demand curve|slump in demand]].   The setting of targets and maxima at various levels in the retailer's product hierarchies and time dimensions; and the subordination of purchasing to these limits, is known as "Commitment control".

The '''Danish Vacation Law''' ({{lang-da|'Ferieloven'}}) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[law]] regulating [[vacation]] time for [[employee]]s. A similar law exists in [[Norway]].

== Danish law ==
The Danish law on vacation time is administered by the Agency for Retention and Recruitment (''Styrelsen for Fastholdelse og Rekruttering''), which is part of the [[Ministry of Labor (Denmark)|Ministry of Labour]] (''Beskæftigelsesministeriet'') and by a range of other authorities, including the vacation pay scheme, ''FerieKonto''. The Act applies to most Danish employees, but not, for example, to civil servants. A number of the provisions of the Act may be waived under [[collective bargaining]]. The law states, among other things, that "an employee shall be entitled to 2.08 days of paid vacation for each month of employment."

A characteristic feature of the Danish vacation law is that it distinguishes between the accrual and the taking of vacation time. All workers covered by the law have the right to 25 vacation days (five weeks), but only those who have accrued vacation time are entitled to paid vacation time.

So-called "floating holidays" are not regulated by the Act but are agreed on between employer and employee, either individually or through collective bargaining.

=== Relation to EU ===
The law in Denmark implements part of [[European Union directive]] 93/104/EC of 1993, for example Article 7, which states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that every worker is entitled to paid annual leave of at least four weeks in accordance with the conditions for entitlement to, and granting of, such leave laid down by national legislation and/or practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:31993L0104&amp;from=DA Council Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organization of working time] at Eur-Lex.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Discovery Family''' is an American [[pay television]] channel owned by [[Discovery, Inc.]] with a minority ownership held by [[Hasbro]].

The network was first launched on October 7, 1996 as '''Discovery Kids Channel''', a spin-off of [[Discovery Channel]] that featured science, nature and adventure-themed programs aimed towards children ages 6-11. In April 2009, Hasbro announced a [[joint venture]] with Discovery, Inc. to relaunch Discovery Kids as '''The Hub''' (later '''Hub Network''') on October 10, 2010; Hasbro handled programming while Discovery handled distribution and advertising sales. The Hub was intended to be a general, youth-oriented network with a "diverse" lineup, primarily featuring programming adapted from Hasbro franchises (such as ''[[Transformers]]'', its [[Parker Brothers|board game]]s, ''[[My Little Pony]]'', ''[[Pound Puppies]]'' and ''[[Littlest Pet Shop]]'') along with other family-oriented programs such as sitcom reruns and films.

On September 25, 2014, following reports earlier in the year that Hub Network president [[Margaret Loesch]] would step down by the end of the year, Discovery acquired 10% of Hasbro's stake in the network, and replaced Loesch with Henry Schleiff, who leads sister networks such as [[Destination America]] and [[Investigation Discovery]]. On October 13, 2014, Hub Network was re-branded as Discovery Family to which Hasbro remains a minority partner and programs the network's daytime lineup with children's programs carried over from Hub Network, while its prime-time lineup was replaced with reruns of [[non-fiction]] programs from Discovery Channel's library, including [[popular science|science]] and nature programs.

As of February 2015, approximately 69,513,000 American households (59.7% of households with television) receive Discovery Family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/22/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-february-2015/366230/|title=List of how many homes each cable network is in as of February 2015|last=Seidman|first=Robert|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Zap2it|date=February 22, 2015|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===As Discovery Kids Channel/Discovery Kids (1996–2010)===
[[Discovery Inc.|Discovery Communications]] launched Discovery Kids Channel on October 7, 1996, as part of a suite of four new [[digital cable]] channels that included [[Destination America|Discovery Travel &amp; Living]], [[Discovery Civilization]], and [[Science Channel]].&lt;ref name=blueskies&gt;{{cite book|last=Parsons|first=Patrick|title=Blue Skies: A History of Cable Television|date=2008|work=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=1592137067}}&lt;!--|accessdate=September 23, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Play in the U.S. of A|url=http://realscreen.com/1999/04/01/25107-19990401/3/|last=Kirchdoerffer|first=Ed|accessdate=September 23, 2014|work=Realscreen|date=April 1, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its launch, the network primarily offered adventure, nature, and science-themed programs aimed towards a children's audience between ages 6 and 11.&lt;ref name="NBC Discovery"&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery Gets NBC Kids' Block|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/orphan-articles/discovery-gets-nbc-kids-block/154693|last=Umstead|first=Thomas|work=Multichannel News|accessdate=September 23, 2014|date=December 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marjorie Kaplan, the network's senior vice president, explained that the creation of Discovery Kids was influenced primarily by kids who were watching its [[Discovery Channel|parent network]]'s programming together with their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2003/tv/news/adults-discovery-kiddie-programs-1117880923/|title=Adults 'Discovery' kiddie programs|last=Oei|first=Lily|work=Variety|date=February 23, 2003|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1996 until 2000, Discovery Kids was carried by only a select few cable television providers. By late 2001, the channel was carried in at least 15 million homes.&lt;ref name="NBC Discovery"/&gt; In September 2001, a [[Discovery Kids (Canada)|Canadian version]] of Discovery Kids was launched in partnership with [[Corus Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery Kids Launches With a Unique Blend of "Edu-tainment"|url=http://www.corusent.com/home/Corporate/PressReleases/tabid/1697/Default.aspx?Id=34|work=Corus Entertainment|accessdate=September 23, 2014|date=August 8, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2001, Discovery Kids announced a partnership with [[NBC]], in which it would produce a new Saturday morning block for the network known as ''[[Discovery Kids on NBC]]'', beginning in September 2002. The block, which replaced [[TNBC|a teen-oriented block consisting only of sitcoms]], featured programming that met the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]]'s (FCC) [[E/I|educational programming guidelines]], including new original series (such as the [[reality television]] series ''[[Endurance (TV series)|Endurance]]''), existing Discovery Kids programming, along with children's spin-offs of programs from sister networks, such as [[Animal Planet]] and Discovery Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery Kids sets NBC sked|url=https://variety.com/2002/tv/news/discovery-kids-sets-nbc-sked-1117864789/|last=Oei|first=Lily|work=Variety|accessdate=September 23, 2014|date=April 2, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the launch of the NBC block, Discovery Kids had grown its cable carriage to over 43 million homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery Kids parts with NBC|url=https://variety.com/2006/tv/news/discovery-kids-parts-with-nbc-1117940034/|last=Riddell|first=Robert|work=Variety|accessdate=September 23, 2014|date=March 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC would replace the Discovery Kids block with [[Qubo]] in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hampp|first=Andrew|title=NBC Debuts Kids Programming Brand Qubo|url=http://adage.com/article/media/nbc-debuts-kids-programming-brand-qubo/111473/|accessdate=February 14, 2014|work=Ad Age|date=August 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As The Hub/Hub Network (2010–2014)===
[[File:Hub Network logo 2014.png|thumb|125px|left|Hub Network's last logo used until October 12, 2014]]
On April 30, 2009, toy manufacturer and multimedia company [[Hasbro]] announced that it would be forming a [[joint venture]] with Discovery Communications to relaunch Discovery Kids as a new family-oriented television channel. Under the arrangement, Discovery would be in charge of handling advertising sales and distribution for the new channel while Hasbro would be involved in acquiring and producing programming. While the network planned to maintain educational series (including those carried over from Discovery Kids), plans called for new original programs based off Hasbro-owned franchises such as ''[[G.I. Joe]]'', ''My Little Pony'', ''[[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers]]'' and [[game show]]s adapted from its board game brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/01/discovery-and-hasbro-name-new-kids-channel-the-hub.html|title=Discovery and Hasbro Name New Kids Channel "The Hub"|last=Flint|first=Joe|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 14, 2010|accessdate=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118003029.html?categoryId=14&amp;cs=1|title=Hasbro Nabs Discovery Kids Stake|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120630141400/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118003029?refCatId=14|archivedate=June 30, 2012|last=Schneider|first=Michael|date=April 30, 2009|work=Variety|accessdate=July 12, 2017|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, Discovery and Hasbro announced that the new network would be known as '''The Hub'''; two months later, the companies announced that The Hub would be launched on October 10, 2010. The network planned to continue targeting Discovery Kids' main demographic of children aged 2-14 (a market which staff felt was being abandoned by its competitors such as [[Nickelodeon]] and [[Disney Channel]] in favor of [[tween (demographic)|tweens]]) but also planned to feature a prime-time block with family-oriented programming. Veteran television executive and the network's president and [[chief executive officer]] [[Margaret Loesch]] stated that The Hub's goal was to be "vibrant" and "diverse" in its programming and that the channel would not purely be a marketing vehicle for Hasbro products.&lt;ref name="owens1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10283/1091189-67.stm|last=Owens|first=Rob|title=Tuned In: The Hub Network Offers Programs for Younger Children|date=October 10, 2010|accessdate=October 10, 2010|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|quote=The Hub (Formerly Discovery Kids) Launches at 10:00AM Today.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network's original imaging was developed by Troika Design Group and built around an emblem nicknamed the "hubble" – which was designed to embody a "catalyst of action and imagination". The final logo design was the result of a number of drafts by Troika designers, some of which had incorporated typography similar to Hasbro's logo.&lt;ref name="nyt-hubreboot"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Children’s Channel Retools|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/11/business/media/11adco.html?_r=0|accessdate=October 13, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hub Logo – Case Study|url=http://www.troika.tv/hub-logo-case-study/|publisher=Troika Design Group|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To promote the launch of The Hub, sneak previews of shows slated to air on the channel such as ''[[Cosmic Quantum Ray]]'', ''[[The Twisted Whiskers Show]]'' and ''[[Family Game Night (TV series)|Family Game Night]]'' aired on [[Science Channel]], [[Animal Planet]] and [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;https://animesuperhero.com/forums/threads/the-hubs-schedule-for-10-10-10-11-men-in-black-the-series-is-coming.5037321/page-2&lt;/ref&gt; The Hub was finally launched on its launching date October 10, 2010, with ''The Twisted Whiskers Show'' being the first program to air followed by an episode of ''[[Dennis the Menace and Gnasher (2009 TV series)|Dennis and Gnasher]]'' and ''Cosmic Quantum Ray''.&lt;ref name="owens1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boston-launch"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2010/10/07/hasbro_joins_crowded_market_with_new_childrens_channel|title=From Toys to TV: Hasbro Joins Crowded Market with New Children's Channel|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=October 7, 2010|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hub's launch programming would include the game show ''[[Family Game Night (TV series)|Family Game Night]]'', animated television series ''[[Pound Puppies (2010 TV series)|Pound Puppies]]'', ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'' – a new animated entry in the ''My Little Pony'' franchise developed by [[Lauren Faust]] and ''[[Deltora Quest (anime)| Deltora Quest]]'' alongside reruns of the [[Jim Henson]] series ''[[Fraggle Rock]]'' and the preschool-oriented programs ''[[Animal Mechanicals]]'' and ''[[The WotWots]]''.&lt;ref name=launch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/450819-Discovery_Hasbro_Aim_for_Perfect_10s.php|title=Discovery, Hasbro Aim for Perfect 10s|last=Atkinson|first=Claire|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=March 29, 2010|accessdate=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="owens1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boston-launch"/&gt;

In a June 2011 debt filing with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]], Discovery Communications indicated that the channel may be worth less than previously believed, based on low viewership figures. The management of The Hub subsequently underwent a fair value analysis of the channel. A Discovery Communications spokesperson considered the action to be "a [[pro-forma]] accounting exercise", and noted that Discovery felt "very positive, and encouraged by The Hub's early days' performance, and ability to grow its audience in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/06/is-the-hub-due-for-a-writedown-discovery-debt-filing-raises-that-possibility|title=Is THE HUB Due For A Writedown?

In March 2013, The Hub picked up its first work from [[POW! Entertainment]], ''[[Stan Lee's Mighty 7]]'', an animated pilot film to be aired in early 2014. The network also began to phase in an amended branding as the '''Hub Network'''.&lt;ref name=tfc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2013/03/20/the-hub-network-unveils-2013-14-program-slate-with-six-new-additions-to-join-nine-returning-original-series-307012/20130320hub01|title=The Hub Network Unveils 2013-'14 Program Slate with Six New Additions to Join Nine Returning Original Series|work=The Futon Critic|date=March 20, 2013|accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2013, Hub Network introduced an updated logo, and a new imaging campaign, "Making Family Fun", which was developed by the Los Angeles-based agency Oishii Creative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All in the Brand: Making Family Fun|url=http://www.oishiicreative.com/project/hub-network-rebrand/|publisher=Oishii Creative|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As Discovery Family (2014–present)===
On June 12, 2014, it was reported that Margaret Loesch would step down from her role as Hub Network president and CEO by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/06/hub-president-ceo-margaret-loesch-to-exit/|title=HUB President &amp; CEO Margaret Loesch To Exit|last=Adreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=June 12, 2014|accessdate=June 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 17, 2014, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that Discovery Communications was preparing to acquire a controlling stake in Hub Network from Hasbro and then retool it as '''Discovery Family'''. Along with Discovery's CFO Andrew Warren, Hasbro staff acknowledged that increasing competition in the children's media landscape – especially by subscription video-on-demand services such as [[Netflix]] – had an effect on the overall performance of the network and Hasbro's original content.&lt;ref name="Discovery Family"/&gt;&lt;ref name="modify"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adweek-df"/&gt; As it was majority-owned by a competitor, other major toy companies such as [[Mattel]] refused to purchase advertising time on Hub Network, affecting its ability to air advertising that targeted its main audience; by 2014, the network had made only $9 million per year. Discovery staff was also unable to display a full commitment to Hub Network's operation, due to factors such as the troubled launch of the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|Oprah Winfrey Network]]. Believing that they had overvalued its stake in the venture, Hasbro decided to cede the operation of the network to Discovery so it could focus more on content and its core toy business.&lt;ref name="adweek-df"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/after-rocky-few-years-hasbro-s-tv-strategy-changing-again-163083|title=The Rise and Fall and Rise of Hasbro's TV Strategy|last=Thielman|first=Sam|work=Adweek|date=February 23, 2015|accessdate=February 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discovery and Hasbro publicly announced the planned re-branding on September 25, 2014, Hasbro's CEO [[Brian Goldner]] explained that Discovery Family would be the "next chapter" in its joint venture with Discovery, "[combining] highly rated award-winning storytelling around Hasbro's brands and Discovery's most popular non-fiction shows that appeal to both children and families alike." Hub Network was re-launched as Discovery Family on October 13, 2014 – just over four years since the original launch of The Hub. With these changes, Discovery Communications now holds a 60% stake in the joint venture; Hasbro continues to hold a 40% stake in Discovery Family, and continues to program the network's daytime lineup with children's programming. Following the re-launch, the network's primetime lineup was replaced by reruns of family-oriented factual programming from Discovery Channel's library.&lt;ref name="Hub to Discovery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hub-rebrand-as-discovery-family-735656|title=The Hub to Rebrand as Discovery Family Channel as Discovery Takes Control|last=Szalai|first=Georg|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 25, 2014|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Schleiff, who leads sister networks such as Destination America and Investigation Discovery, leads the re-launched network, with Tom Cosgrove (who previously served as CEO of Discovery Channel and [[Science (TV network)|Science]]) as general manager.&lt;ref name="Hub to Discovery"/&gt;

In re-launching Hub Network, Discovery executives noted that there would be a larger emphasis on programming of interest to both children and their parents; Warren argued that since [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]] had become, in his opinion, aimed towards teenage girls, there was a gap in the broadcasting industry for a new, family-oriented network.&lt;ref name="Discovery Family"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/discovery-to-take-control-of-the-hub-network-1410979842|title=Discovery to Take Control of Hub Children's Network|last=Flint|first=Joe|last2=Hagey|first2=Keach|last3=Ziobro|first3=Paul|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=September 17, 2014|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="modify"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/news-articles/discovery-hasbro-modify-hub-partnership/383946|title=Discovery, Hasbro Modify Hub Partnership|last=Farrell|first=Mike|work=MultiChannel News|date=September 17, 2014|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these shifts in the network's operation, it was announced on October 7, 2014 that ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]'' – a sequel to ''Transformers: Prime'' that had been scheduled to premiere on Hub Network, would instead air on [[Cartoon Network]].&lt;ref name="variety-tfmoveback"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/hasbro-transformers-robots-in-disguise-cartoon-network-1201322969/|title=Hasbro's 'Transformers' Return to Original TV Home, Cartoon Network|last=Graser|first=Marc|work=Variety|date=October 7, 2014|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hasbro Studios president Stephen Davis felt that Cartoon Network was a more appropriate home for a ''Transformers'' series due to its male-oriented demographics,&lt;ref name="adweek-df"/&gt; describing Hub Network's lineup as being "traditionally skewed towards girls".&lt;ref name="variety-tfmoveback"/&gt;  Other recent ''Transformers'' [[List of Transformers TV series|animated series]] preceding the original launch of The Hub also aired on Cartoon Network.&lt;ref name="deadline-tfmoved"/&gt;&lt;ref name="variety-tfmoveback"/&gt; Davis remarked that Hasbro was still "100% committed" to its joint venture with Discovery.&lt;ref name="deadline-tfmoved"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/transformers-robots-in-disguise-series-move-cartoon-network-hasbro-847192/|title=Hasbro Moves New 'Transformers' Series To Cartoon Network|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=October 7, 2014|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the move for ''Robots in Disguise'', fellow Hub Network ''Transformers'' series ''[[Transformers: Rescue Bots]]'' would remain on Discovery Family for its third season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/10/22/discovery-family-channel-to-premiere-the-third-season-of-transformers-rescue-bots-november-1/318247/|title=Discovery Family Channel to Premiere the Third Season of ''Transformers Rescue Bots'' November 1|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 22, 2014|accessdate=October 24, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025193437/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/10/22/discovery-family-channel-to-premiere-the-third-season-of-transformers-rescue-bots-november-1/318247/|archivedate=October 25, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
{{further|List of programs broadcast by Discovery Family}}
[[File:2950hollywoodway.JPG|thumb|right|Hasbro Studios ([[Burbank, California]] headquarters pictured) supplies much of the network's programming.]]
The majority of Discovery Family's daytime programs are animated and live-action series tied to [[media franchise]]s owned by Hasbro itself, with newer series produced through the [[Hasbro Studios]] division, such as ''Pound Puppies'' and ''Transformers: Rescue Bots''. As the Hub Network, it also previously aired [[game show]]s tied to Hasbro's [[board game]]s, such as ''Family Game Night''. Following the relaunch as Discovery Family, the remainder of its lineup was replaced with family-oriented science and nature-related programs from its sister network [[Discovery Channel]] such as ''[[Africa (TV series)|Africa]]'', ''[[Extreme Engineering|Extreme Engineering: Big Reveals]]'', ''[[Flying Wild Alaska]]'' and ''[[Time Warp (TV series)|Time Warp]]''.&lt;ref name="Hub to Discovery"/&gt;

One of the network's most noteworthy series has been ''My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic'', an animated series developed and first produced by Lauren Faust which is associated with the recent reboot of Hasbro's ''My Little Pony'' franchise. The series not only became The Hub's highest-rated program within its target demographic of young girls, but attracted an unexpectedly significant [[cult following]] [[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic fandom|among male teens and adults]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/bronies-my-little-pony-friendship-magic-1068692.aspx|title=Give Bronies a Break! In Defense of Adult My Little Pony Fans|last=Gennis|first=Sadie|work=TV Guide|date=July 31, 2013|accessdate=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The network has also acquired new series unrelated to Hasbro properties, including ''[[The Aquabats! Super Show!]]'', ''[[Dan Vs.]]'', ''[[Majors &amp; Minors]]'', ''[[The Haunting Hour: The Series|R. L. Stine's The Haunting Hour]]'' and ''[[SheZow]]'', while four of its programs, ''[[Strawberry Shortcake's Berry Bitty Adventures]]'', ''The Twisted Whiskers Show'', ''[[Maryoku Yummy]]'' and ''[[Care Bears: Welcome to Care-a-Lot]]'', came from properties of [[American Greetings]].&lt;!-- Note that both AG and Hasbro are licensing partners to each other. How should we notify readers of that? --&gt;

During its years as the Hub Network, the channel also aired reruns of other outside series, such as ''Fraggle Rock'' and ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', a collection of various [[Warner Bros. Animation]] series, such as ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', and ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', a few former [[Fox Kids]] shows such as ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'' and ''[[Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation]]'', and various off-network sitcoms (at the end of the Hub Network's run, these included ''[[Blossom (TV series)|Blossom]]'', ''[[Step by Step (TV series)|Step by Step]]'' and ''[[Sister, Sister (TV series)|Sister, Sister]]''); ''Blossom'', the only sitcom on Discovery Family's schedule, returned for a time in 2016. A limited amount of original Discovery Kids programming, such as ''[[Adventure Camp]]'' and ''[[Flight 29 Down]]'', remained on the lineup upon its launch as The Hub.&lt;ref name="modify"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3757">A '''fixed-term contract''' is a contractual relationship between an employee and an employer that lasts for a specified period. These contracts are usually regulated by different countries' [[labour laws]], to ensure that employers still fulfill basic labour rights regardless of a contract's form, particularly [[unjust dismissal]]. Generally, fixed-term contracts will automatically be deemed to have created a permanent contract, subject to the employer's right to terminate employment on reasonable notice for a good reason. In the European Union the incidence of fixed-term contracts ranges from 6% in the UK to 23% in Spain, with Germany, Italy and France between 13% and 16%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00073&amp;plugin=1|title=Eurostat - Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface (TGM) table|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==
Due to the potential [[job insecurity]] that multiple fixed-term contracts may cause, employment laws in many countries limit the circumstances and the way these contracts may be used. In countries where labour law is more restrictive (compensation/indemnity for dismissal), the differentiation between fixed-term and permanent contracts tends to be clearly set out in law. Where employment legislation is less protective for the employee there tends to be a lesser degree of differentiation between fixed and permanent contracts.

===Belgium===
There are two possibilities to contract successive fixed-term contracts:

# Successive employment contracts with a maximum term of two years: A maximum of four successive fixed-term employment contracts, where the minimum duration of each contract is three months and the total duration of all the successive contracts is not longer than two years. 
# Successive employment contracts with a maximum term of three years: With the prior authorisation of the [[Federal Public Service Employment|Belgian Federal Public Service Employment, Labour and Social Dialogue]], successive fixed-term contracts can be concluded with a minimum duration of six months if the total duration of all the successive contracts do not exceed three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emploi.belgique.be/defaultTab.aspx?id=41992#|title=Contrat de travail conclu pour une durée déterminée (CDD)|work=emploi.belgique.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
The maximum term is twenty four months and may be extended once only&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/particuliers/F38.xhtml#N100B9|title=Conditions de renouvellement d'un contrat de travail à durée déterminée (CDD)|work=service-public.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Fixed-term contracts may not be extended more than three times with a maximum total period of two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arbeitsratgeber.com/befristete-arbeitsvertraege/|title=Befristeter Arbeitsvertrag oder Zeitvertrag|work=ArbeitsRatgeber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
India allows fixed term employment since 2018. Fixed term employees are entitled to wage and benefits on par with permanent employees.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/the-good-and-bad-side-of-fixed-term-employment-amendment-2532947.html &lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Any employee on fixed-term contracts for four or more years will automatically become a permanent employee, unless the employer can show there is a good business reason not to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/fixed-term-contracts/renewing-or-ending-a-fixedterm-contract|title=Fixed-term employment contracts|work=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''global business track''' is a specialized [[course of study]] in [[business]]. Originally, a business track was a practical study of business and a wide range of [[social science]] instruction. A global business track aims to nurture [[international student]]s who have [[English language]] skills and [[international business]] sense.

A global business track also helps students compete in a [[Global_variable|global environment]]. It provides global vision for fresh man who has wide international stage. So they can make their dreams come true who  has global vision and interests global economy. It provides an environment where international students can participate with [[South Korea|Korean]] students.

In Korea, a global business track is used at [[Sungkyunkwan University]], [[Gachon University]], and [[Sangmyung University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gachon.ac.kr&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naver.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15976">[[File:Hannes Androsch.jpg|thumb]]
'''Johannes "Hannes" Androsch''' is an Austrian entrepreneur and consultant; a former Social Democrat top politician who served as an Austrian minister of finance from 1970 to 1981 and additionally as vice chancellor from 1976 to 1981; and a former banker who from 1981 to 1988 was the general director of the Creditanstalt-Bankverein (Austria’s leading bank at that time) and subsequently an advisor to the World Bank. From 1989 onward he built an industrial investment group, Androsch International Consulting (AIC), which is a major factor in Austria's internationally active corporate landscape. In addition, Androsch's foundation is an important sponsor of research and development activities in Austria, where he is regularly consulted on matters of political, economic and financial importance.

== Youth and early political activities ==

Androsch was born on 18 April 1938 in Vienna, where his parents, Hans and Lia, were [[tax advisors]] in the district [[Floridsdorf]]. The family lived through the end of World War II in Southern Bohemia, where they witnessed the [[expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia]] in June 1945.  His mother placed seven-year-old Hannes on the window sill and instructed him to watch the events closely so that he would never forget.&lt;ref&gt;Palme, Liselotte. Androsch. Ein Leben zwischen Geld und Macht. {{ISBN|978-3-453-17851-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Androsch concluded his high school education in Vienna in 1956. He proceeded to study business administration at the University of World Trade (today's [[Vienna University of Economics and Business]]), where he obtained his diploma in 1959, followed by a doctorate in 1969.

His political activities manifested early, and took him to the top position in the Vienna branch of the student organization of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Socialist party]] (1960–1961), and then to leadership of the national organization (1962–1963). Thereafter, at the age of only 25 years, he became secretary for economic issues in the club of the Socialist members of parliament, a position which he held until 1966.

==Rise and fall as a politician==
1967 was a fateful year for Androsch: he was certified as a [[Certified Public Accountant|public accountant]] and tax advisor, allowing him to participate in the financial consulting enterprise which his parents had significantly expanded; and he became a member of parliament for the Socialist party where he earned himself a reputation as a shooting star. When [[Bruno Kreisky]] turned the tables on Austria's political scenery with the [[Austrian legislative election, 1970|1970 national election]] he made the 32-year-old Androsch [[Finance minister]] in his first minority cabinet on 21 April 1970. Androsch continued in this function when the Socialist single-party government consolidated its dominance through the absolute majorities won in the elections of 1971 and 1975. Although he had not been Kreisky's first choice for this position (Schachner-Blazizek and Felix Slavik had declined) the two men developed a working relationship that was, initially, very good. Androsch became a strong advocate of [[Keynesian economics]], in a modification that became known as “Austro-Keynesianism.”

On 1 October 1976 Androsch was made [[Vice-Chancellor of Austria]] while remaining minister of finance. In this capacity he became chairman of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] at ministerial level in 1979, and also served as chairman of the Interim Committee of the [[International Monetary Fund]].

While Androsch had built an excellent political network within the centrist wing of the Socialist party and especially the [[Austrian Trade Union Federation]] (ÖGB), not everybody was happy with his rapid rise. The fact that the Austrian print media, who for the most part venerated Kreisky and had adorned him with the nickname "Sun King," started to refer to Androsch as the "Crown Prince" did not help. When in 1975 Androsch differed with Kreisky on how to handle the reconfiguration of Austria's state-owned industry, and expressed his wish to become president of the national bank
instead of continuing in the government, Kreisky himself became suspicious  of the young man he had mentored for years. He started to take exception to a highly problematic incompatibility that had been public knowledge since Androsch became a member of the government: he still owned the tax advisor company (renamed Consultatio in 1970) which he had taken over from his parents, although he had placed it in [[escrow]] when he became a finance minister.

Towards the end of 1980, after long and intense campaigns by Austria's media and a continued deterioration of his relationship with Kreisky, Androsch resigned from his political positions on 20 January 1981.

==Second career as a banker==
The government appointed Androsch as the governor of the state-owned [[Creditanstalt]], Austria’s leading bank at that time, a little later in 1981. However, he continued to face heavy opposition and revelations made by investigative journalists (especially [[Alfred Worm]]), that culminated in a series of investigations of his personal financial conduct, which in part predated his public role or were not demonstrably connected with it. Androsch has repeatedly stated (and has repeated these allegations in a series of interviews published by the Austrian newspaper "Die Presse" in February and March 2010; see sources) that his Socialist successors in the finance ministry, Herbert Salcher and [[Franz Vranitzky]] (who had been Androsch's secretary, and would later rise to chancellorship) had conspired with Kreisky, "who was simply jealous", (and with political opponent [[Alois Mock]]) to "construe the financial and legal proceedings against him", that would not be finally settled for the following 16 years. "I had no chance to even be heard. And many who have participated in this vendetta would now rather pretend that nothing had ever happened."

A central point of Androsch's defence concerning his personal finances — he claimed that a rich "uncle-by-choice" ("Wahlonkel" in German) had provided him with significant funds, and habitually replied "alas, no" when asked if he was a millionaire — did not hold. On 8 October 1991 Androsch was convicted by the Vienna Regional Criminal Court of having evaded taxes between 1974 and 1983 in the amount of about five million Austrian schillings (roughly corresponding to EUR 500,000 expressed in 2010 currency), a minuscule fraction of the original allegations. He was sentenced to a fine of 1.8 million Austrian schillings.

A legally separate but politically related affair (a conviction for false testimony to the parliamentary examination board investigating the scandal surrounding the [[Vienna General Hospital]]) forced Androsch to resign from the Creditanstalt post in January 1988. With the help of a Swiss member of the [[Bilderberg Group]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.androsch.com/media/news/1218_news_20080410_androschslebensbilanz.pdf Androschs Lebensbilanz] Interview published in NEWS No. 15/2008 (see p. 63)&lt;/ref&gt; he became a consultant to the [[World Bank]], especially for China and parts of Africa, until 1989. Androsch is a former member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bilderbergmeetings.org/former-steering-committee-members.html|title=Former Steering Committee Members|work=bilderbergmeetings.org|publisher=[[Bilderberg Group]]|accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third career as an industrial investor==
In 1989 Androsch founded AIC Androsch International Management Consulting GmbH, which in 1994 commenced its corporate investment and acquisition activity. Its offices are situated at the Ringstraße, opposite the Vienna opera house.

By way of AIC, Androsch is co-owner and president of the supervisory board of the following Austrian companies:

*Austria Technologie und Systemtechnik (AT&amp;S) AG, Europe's largest manufacturer of [[printed circuit boards]] with offices in Vienna and [[Leoben]]
*Salinen Austria AG, Austria's [[salt mining]] and processing company and a significant player in Europe
*bwin.com Interactive Entertainment AG, a developer and marketer of [[online gambling]] and gaming products in Vienna

Former investments of Androsch's holdings included major stakes in Future Advanced Composite Components (FACC) AG in [[Ried im Innkreis]] (acquired by [[Xi'an Aircraft Industrial Corporation]] in 2009) and in [[KTM]] Sportmotorcycle AG. In 2000, he was a major founding investor of Austrian prepaid payment method [[paysafecard]], until it was finally sold to British [[Skrill]] group for 140 million euros in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/1260747/Oesterreichische-Paysafecard-um-140-Mio-Euro-verkauft |title=Österreichische "Paysafecard" um 140 Mio.

Androsch is also president of the supervisory board of the [[Austrian Institute of Technology]] (AIT; formerly Austrian Research Centers, ARC) in [[Seibersdorf]], and deputy chairman of the supervisory board of FIMBAG Finanzmarktbeteiligung AG,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oeiag.at/english/asp/indexchart.asp?id=fimbag FIMBAG company information] [https://www.webcitation.org/5pT7Ijazr Archived]&lt;/ref&gt; the vehicle through which the state-owned [[Österreichische Industrieholding]] controls its stakes in Austrian banking system. He has been chairman of the Council of the [[University of Leoben]].

Following the collapse of [[Refco]], a class-action lawsuitsuit in the US caused considerable difficulties for [[BAWAG P.S.K.]], the Austrian trade union's bank. Androsch and other Austrian investors formed a consortium with [[Cerberus Capital Management]], which acquired the bank in
2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bawagpsk.com/bawagpsk/__UeberUns/Unternehmen/Firmengeschichte/nav__en,setId=bawagpsk,path=_2A125984_2A_2F126866_2F125984_2F122828_2FCR122828_2FCD123146.html BAWAG P.S.K. Company History (2005-2008)] [https://www.webcitation.org/5pT73z6zG Archived]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the Austrian economics magazine ''trend'' estimated Androsch's wealth at EUR 420 million, ranking him 25th among the wealthiest Austrians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oe24.at/oesterreich/Die-reichsten-Oesterreicher/31110 Die reichsten Österreicher] Ranking of the wealthiest Austrians in 2006 by ''trend'' magazine [https://www.webcitation.org/5xN3OIQpi Archived]&lt;/ref&gt; Using a modified rating that also considered networking, the magazine ranked him the 22nd most powerful person in Austria's economy in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Die 100 Mächtigsten in der Wirtschaft. trend 7/2009, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research sponsorships==
On 21 June 2004, the founding session of the Hannes Androsch Foundation within the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] was held. It is dedicated to "the consolidation of social balance and peace." Androsch endowed it with EUR 1 million and committed himself to increase the annual budget to EUR 10 million until 2012. It awards the Hannes Androsch Prize (EUR 100,000 for 2011) for scientific contributions to its goals. According to the academy, this is the most important private non-profit foundation established in Austria since 1945.

Androsch is a member of the fundraising committee of the [[Institute of Molecular Biotechnology]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imba.oeaw.ac.at/support-imba/fundraising-committee/ IMBA fundraising committee website] [https://www.webcitation.org/5pT7aQIHe Archived]&lt;/ref&gt; a joint initiative of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the pharmaceutical company [[Boehringer Ingelheim]].

==Honors==
Androsch has been awarded a significant number of international honors, among them an honorary doctorate in economics from the [[University of New Orleans]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austrianinformation.org/summer-fall-2009/former-austrian-vice-chancellor-androsch-awarded-honorary-do.html Androsch awarded honorary doctorate] Austrian News Service press release Sept. 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Leadership &amp; Management''' is a professional membership body for [[leaders]] and [[managers]] around the world. Its mission is to inspire great leadership - everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.institutelm.com |title=Institute for Leadership &amp; Management |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Membership of The Institute of Leadership &amp; Management is open to leaders and managers of all levels, including those with no practical experience. There is trial membership — for individuals taking ILM qualifications. Some organisations that are involved with personal development, such as [[The Scout Association]] also highlight the availability of membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/2770/institute-of-leadership-and-management |title=Member resources: Institute of Leadership and Management |publisher=[[The Scout Association]] |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five grades of membership entitle the member to use [[post-nominal letters]] - Affiliate (AInstLM), Associate Member (AMInstLM), Member (MInstLM), Fellow (FInstLM) and Companion (CInstLM). The highest grade is Companionship — for senior executives selected by the Institute. Membership is validated by an official membership certificate.

Members are offered access a range of services to help with their [[Continuous professional development]] (CPD), although this isn't mandatory, including access to e-books, electronic learning materials, and paid-for events.

==Research==
The Institute of Leadership &amp; Management carries out research into leadership and management in practice, providing insights for managers and leaders and publishing findings in white papers, research reports and journals. The institute takes a collaborative approach, preferring to work with like-minded individuals and organisations in defining research topics and undertaking research activity.

==Training and Qualifications==
The Institute of Leadership &amp; Management offers a wide range of learning resources to support the continuous professional development of leaders and managers in a variety of organisations and settings.

Developed over many years of research and insight into best practice, a range of regulated qualifications are now delivered under the distinct 'ILM' brand by the City &amp; Guilds Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exeter.ac.uk/exeterleadersaward/ilm-qualification/ |title=Studying: The Exeter Award: Institute of Leadership and Management qualification |publisher=[[University of Exeter]]|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.somerset.ac.uk/blog/institute-leadership-management-ilm-qualifications-available-at-somerset-college.html |title=Institute of Leadership &amp; Management (ILM) qualifications available at Somerset College |publisher=[[Somerset College of Arts and Technology|Somerset College]]|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/829/page/47292 |title=NLIAH is an approved Institute for Leadership and Management (ILM) Centre |publisher=The National Leadership and Innovation Agency for Healthcare (NLIAH) |date=23 April 2010 |accessdate=11 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518081458/http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/829/page/47292 |archivedate=18 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/explore-by-career/management/training-in-management/|title=NHS Careers: Explore by career: Management: Training in management  |publisher=www.nhscareers.nhs.uk |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ILM qualifications are practically based, designed to complement the individual’s role at work. Aligned to the UK’s [[Qualifications and Credit Framework]] (QCF), ILM qualifications begin at level 2, such as the ILM Award in Team Leading, and continue up to level 7, such as the ILM Diploma in Strategic Leadership and Executive Management. ILM also offers [[National Vocational Qualification|NVQ]]s; these include the Level 5 NVQ in Management. Other specialist qualifications cover skills in volunteer management, business start-up, [[business coaching|coaching]], and personnel management. All ILM qualifications have been accredited by the [[Ofqual|Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation]] (Ofqual).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://register.ofqual.gov.uk/Organisation/Details/RN5143 |title=The Register of Regulated Qualifications: ILM (Institute of Leadership &amp; Management) |publisher=[[Ofqual|Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation]] |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing==
''Edge'' is the Institute's quarterly in-house magazine, looking at the latest leadership and management issues. It is published by [[LID Publishing]]. The magazine is distributed to members as part of a range of benefits and learning resources.

==History==

The '''Institute of Supervision and Management''' ('''ISM''') was founded in 1947 by J.K. Evans M.B.E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrzone.com/community-voice/industry-insight/institute-of-supervision-management-gives-backing-to-local |title=Institute of Supervision &amp; Management gives backing to local management development programme |
publisher=HR Zone Community Voice|date=12 July 2000 |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute of Leadership &amp; Management was formed in November 2001 through the merger of the Institute of Supervision and Management (ISM) and the '''National Examining Board for Supervision and Management (NEBS)'''.

The Institute is a charity registered in England, Wales and Scotland, with its head office in Tamworth, Staffordshire and members in countries across the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4526">'''Jim Riswold''' (born 1957 in [[Seattle, Washington]]) was the former [[creative director]] for [[Portland, Oregon]] based [[advertising agency]] [[Wieden+Kennedy]] and an instructor for the agency's experimental advertising school, [[WK12]]: subject for [[WKE (WKEntertainment)]]'s upcoming web episodic [[documentary]], ''12''.

==Career In Advertising==

Riswold attended the [[University of Washington]] from 1976 to 1983, and received three bachelor's degrees in [[communication]]s, [[philosophy]] and [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=So What Good Is Studying Philosophy: You Want To Be A What? |publisher=University of Washington Philosophy Department |author=Jim Riswold |quote=Jim Riswold.

He also created the [[Bo Knows]] campaign for Nike featuring [[Bo Jackson]], and the [[Tiger Woods]] commercial, entitled "I Am Tiger Woods."

In 2013, Riswold was inducted into [[The One Club]]'s Creative Hall of Fame.

==Career In Art==

After being diagnosed with [[leukemia]] in 2000 and surviving for five years, Riswold quit advertising to become a full-time contemporary artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jim Riswold: Nike ad designer finds success, gets leukemia, turns to Hitler dolls. Huh? | url=http://www.wweek.com/editorial/3146/6741/ Willamette Week | quote=When Riswold, a onetime philosophy major whose iconic Nike ads made him an industry legend, was diagnosed with leukemia, he found solace in art. | date=September 21, 2005 | author=Zach Dundas | publisher=Willamette Week | accessdate=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went from "a career of selling people things they don't need to making things that people don't want".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/creative/features/e3i2db03fb29d573ec5da757eab1f567a2b | title=Profile: Jim Riswold - Ex-Wieden CD celebrates the absurd | publisher=AdWeek | author=Gregory Solman | date=October 6, 2008 | accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riswold's photographs have been shown in galleries throughout the Northwest and hang in the permanent collections of several museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.augengallery.com/Artists_bio/bio_riswold.html | title=Augen Gallery - Bio: Jim Riswold | quote=(see various entries under the headings "Solo Exhibitions", "Group Exhibitions" and "Selected Collections) | accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his works poke fun at historically taboo figures [[Mao Zedong]], [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] by constructing monumental setting in which the figurines were photographer. Jim explained in his 2005 ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' article, [http://www.esquire.com/features/essay/ESQ0905HITLER_164 Hitler Saved My Life] that "Instead of providing […] grand expositions mythologizing the dictator, toys, by definition, make their subjects seem small, childish, and trifling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esquire.com/features/essay/ESQ0905HITLER_164 | title=Hitler Saved My Life | author=Jim Riswold | publisher=Esquire | date=September 1, 2005 | accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Miss Marion Carstairs, 1928 or 1929.jpg|thumb|left|Arnold Genthe (1869-1942)/LOC agc.7a11495. Miss Marion Carstairs, 1928 or 1929]]

Carstairs was born in 1900 in [[Mayfair]], London, England, the daughter of Frances (Fannie) Evelyn Bostwick, an American heiress who was the second child of [[Jabez Bostwick]] and his wife Helen.  Joe Carstairs' legal father was Scottish army officer Captain Albert Carstairs, first of the [[Royal Irish Rifles]]&lt;ref name="fast"&gt;[[Irish Times]] (9 August 1997) ''Weekend Books: A fast lady called Joe.'' (review of ''The Queen of Whale Cay'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue= 26286|page=2705|date=10 May 1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later the [[Princess of Wales's Own (Yorkshire Regiment)|Princess of Wales's Own]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27171|page=1532|date=6 March 1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Carstairs re-enlisted with the Army the week before Joe was born; he and Evelyn divorced soon afterwards.{{sfn|Summerscale|1997|p=16}}  At least one biographer has suggested that the Captain may not have been Joe's biological father.{{sfn|Summerscale|1997|p=15}}

Carstairs' mother, an alcoholic and drug addict, later married Captain Francis Francis, with whom she had two more children, Evelyn (Sally) Francis and Francis Francis Jr. (Frank).  She divorced Captain Francis to marry French count Roger de Périgny in 1915, but eventually left him because of his infidelity.{{sfn|Summerscale|1997|p=24}}  Her fourth and last husband, whom she married in 1920, was [[Serge Voronoff]],&lt;ref name="fast"/&gt; a Russian–French surgeon who become famous in the 1920s and 1930s for his practice of transplanting monkey [[testicle]] tissue into male humans for the claimed purpose of [[Rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]]. For some years Evelyn had believed in Voronoff's theories, and she funded his research and acted as his laboratory assistant at the [[Collège de France]] in [[Paris]].{{sfn|Summerscale|1997|p=29}}  Evelyn died in March 1921.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For the remainder of her life, Joe Carstairs would claim her mother had been murdered by her husband for her money. There was no evidence for this, but Voronoff's inheritance from Evelyn made him a wealthy man. ''See Summerscale (1997), p.34''&lt;/ref&gt;

Joe Carstairs married a childhood friend, the French aristocrat Count Jacques de Pret, on 7 January 1918 in Paris. The purpose of the marriage was simply to allow Carstairs access to her trust fund independently of her mother. The marriage was [[annulled]] immediately after her mother's death, on the grounds of [[Canonical impediment#Impediments to marriage|non-consummation]].{{sfn|Summerscale|1997|p=34}} By means of a [[Deed poll]], she renounced her married name and resumed using the name Carstairs in February 1922.&lt;ref name="LondonGazette24Feb1922"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue= 32620|page=1652|date=24 February 1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carstairs lived a colourful life. She usually dressed as a man, had tattooed arms, and loved machines, adventure and speed. Openly lesbian, she had numerous affairs with women, including [[Dolly Wilde]]—[[Oscar Wilde]]'s niece and a fellow ambulance driver from Dublin with whom she had lived in Paris—and a string of actresses, most notably [[Greta Garbo]], [[Tallulah Bankhead]], and [[Marlene Dietrich]].

During [[World War I]], Carstairs served in France with the American [[Red Cross]], driving ambulances. After the war, she served with the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] in France, re-burying the war-dead, and in [[Dublin]] with the Women's Legion Mechanical Transport Section, which acted as transport for British officers during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. In 1920, with three former colleagues from the Women's Legion Mechanical Transport Section, she started the 'X Garage,' a car-hire and chauffeuring service that featured a women-only staff of drivers and mechanics. Carstairs (and her friends and lovers) lived in a flat above the garage,&lt;ref&gt;Clarsen (2011), p.42&lt;/ref&gt; which was situated near [[Cromwell Gardens]] in [[London]]'s fashionable [[South Kensington]] district.

Several of the X-Garage staff had served as drivers during the war and spoke French, German, or Italian. The cars and drivers could be hired for long-distance trips and the business specialised in taking grieving relatives for visits to war-graves and former battlefields in France and Belgium. They were also hired for journeys within London and the garage had an arrangement with the [[Savoy Hotel]] to transport guests to the theatre or to shows. During the early 1920s, X-Garage cars were a familiar sight in London's fashionable circles.&lt;ref&gt;Clarsen (2011), p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, X-Garage closed and Carstairs inherited a fortune via her mother and grandmother from [[Standard Oil]]. She also purchased her first motorboat and was also given a [[Margarete Steiff GmbH|Steiff]] doll by a girlfriend, [[Ruth Baldwin (died 1937)|Ruth Baldwin]] (1905 – August, 1937), naming it ''Lord Tod Wadley''. She became exceptionally attached to this doll, keeping it with her until her death, although—unlike [[Donald Campbell]]'s mascot '[[Mr Whoppit]]'—she didn't take it into her speedboats for fear of losing it.&lt;ref name="petitesophisticate" &gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://thepetitesophisticate.blogspot.com/2008/05/lord-tod-wadley.html 
  |title=Photograph with Lord Tod Wadley
}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had clothes made for it in [[Savile Row tailoring|Saville Row]] and had its name placed with her own on the name plaque on the door of her London apartment.&lt;ref name="Castle2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry Castle|title=Boss Ladies, Watch Out!: Essays on Women, Sex and Writing|date=13 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-22528-5|pages=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1925 and 1930, Carstairs spent considerable time in powerboats and became a very successful racer, although the [[Harmsworth Trophy]] she longed for always eluded her. She did take the Duke of York's trophy and establish herself as the fastest woman on water. Intrigued by the hydrofoil designs of [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and [[Casey Baldwin]] in Nova Scotia, Carstairs ordered a 30-foot hydrofoil boat from the [[Bell Boatyard]] in [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia]] which was intended to achieve 115&amp;nbsp;mph and capture the Harmsworth Cup. However circumstances caused her to withdraw and the boat was completed with a more economical engine delivering 57&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tolkaboat.com/pdf/classicboat_spring_2012.pdf Rick McGraw, "Alexander Graham Bell (1847–1922) the Boat Builder", ''Classic Boat'' Spring 2012, Issue 113, p. 24]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the North American press erroneously began referring to her as "Betty," a nickname she loathed; she claimed that journalists used it out of spite.{{sfn|Summerscale|1997|p=105-106}}

Carstairs was also known for her generosity to her friends. She was close to several male racing drivers and land speed record competitors, using her considerable wealth to assist them. She paid $10,000 of her money to fund the building of one of the [[Campbell-Napier-Railton Blue Bird|''Blue Bird'']] [[land speed record]] cars for [[Malcolm Campbell|Sir Malcolm Campbell]], who once described her as, "the greatest sportsman I know."&lt;ref name="Jennings, Fast Set" &gt;{{cite book
  |title=The Fast Set
  |author=Charles Jennings
  |isbn=0-349-11596-6
  |publisher=Abacus
  |year=2005
}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was equally generous to [[John Cobb (motorist)|John Cobb]], whose [[Railton Special]] was powered by the pair of engines from her powerboat ''Estelle V.''&lt;ref name="Jennings, Fast Set" /&gt;

Meanwhile, Carstairs invested $40,000 purchasing the island of [[List of Islands in the Bahamas#Whale Cay|Whale Cay]] in the [[Bahamas]] where she lavishly hosted such guests as [[Marlene Dietrich]] and the [[Duke of Windsor|Duke]] and [[Wallis, The Duchess of Windsor|Duchess of Windsor]]. She not only constructed a Great House for herself and her guests, but also a lighthouse, school, church, and cannery. She later expanded these properties by also buying the additional islands of [[List of Islands in the Bahamas#Bird Cay|Bird Cay]], [[Cat Cay(s)|Cat Cay]], [[List of Islands in the Bahamas#Devil's Cay|Devil's Cay]], half of [[List of Islands in the Bahamas#Hoffman Cay|Hoffman's Cay]] and a tract of land on [[Andros, Bahamas|Andros]].

After selling Whale Cay in 1975, Carstairs relocated to [[Miami, Florida]].{{sfn|Summerscale|1997|p=217-218}}

Carstairs died in Naples, Florida, in 1993 at the age of 93. Lord Tod Wadley was cremated with her.{{sfn|Summerscale|1997|p=233}} Their ashes and those of Ruth Baldwin were buried by the sea near the [[Old Whaler's Church (Sag Harbor)]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;The Queen of Whale Cay, Kate Summerscale, Fourth Estate, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2065">'''Johann Rosenzopf''' (born 22 April 1939 in [[Klagenfurt]]) is an [[Austria]]n former industrial manager, who meanwhile has retired. He developed the idea of the official [[Youth Olympic Games]] which were introduced in 2007 by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC).

Rosenzopf developed the idea firstly in the year 1998, when he came in contact with the [[Austrian Olympic Committee]] (ÖOC) and the IOC, presenting them his idea of Youth Olympic Games. Though he promoted his idea during the following years, the IOC at first was not in favour of building up additional international multisports events. They told Rosenzopf they were afraid of overloading the sports calendar for young people&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-67768147.html Olympische Jugendspiele - Johann gegen Jacques]. ''[[Der Spiegel]]''. 16 November 2009. Retrieved 15 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and feared the costs being too high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/sport/aktuell/verspaetetes_praesent_des_iok_1.8935070.html Verspätetes Präsent des IOK]. ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]''. 30 December 2010. Retrieved 15 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in July 2007 the IOC declared the introduction of the Olympic Games for young people.

Finally, in November 2010 the IOC conceded Rosenzopf being the initiator of the idea of the Youth Olympic Games: [[Jacques Rogge]], President of the IOC, declared in an official statement that Rosenzopf "made a major contribution and provided significant impetus to the global vision of creating Youth Olympic Games".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/-01mcn3 Olympischer Frieden].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1231">'''Kristian Hindhede''' (surname pronounced as hin-d-her)(19 August 1891 – 8 January 1969) was a Danish [[civil engineer]] and [[industrialist]]. He was a son of the [[physician]] and [[nutritionist]] [[Mikkel Hindhede]].

In the 1920s, Kristian Hindhede pioneered the use of [[ready-mix concrete]] trucks with a horizontal rotating drum mixer. He is described as the [[inventor]] of this [[vehicle]] in the Danish [[Who's Who]] Kraks Blå Bog. As early as 1916, [[Stephen Stepanian]] of Columbus, Ohio, developed a self-discharging motorized transit mixer that was the predecessor of the modern ready-mix concrete truck, but the [[patent]] that Stepanian filed in 1916 was rejected in 1919. The poor quality of motor trucks at the time was a problem for inventors.

Hindhede's [[company]] A/S De danske Betonfabrikker (later renamed KH Beton) evolved into Unicon A/S, Scandinavia's largest supplier of ready-mix concrete. It was acquired by [[Aalborg Portland]] in 1927.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9915">'''Market surveillance''' for products ensures that [[product (business)|product]]s on the [[Market (economics)|market]] are in conformity with the applicable [[law]]. This helps foster trust from consumers buying products or [[financial services]]. It also ensures [[consumer]]s or [[professional]]s do not get injured or worse from non-compliant products. It helps companies which comply to stay in business and not lose market share to [[rogue trader]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Commissioner Kuneva|title=market surveillance|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_d1SMlCxng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Europe ==
In the [[European Union]], [[Member States]] are responsible for market surveillance. Their action is done under the hat of [[The European Commission]] [[regulation]]s about [[product safety]] for consumer products and other regulations for professional products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=European Commission|title=Market Surveillance|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/single-market-goods/regulatory-policies-common-rules-for-products/new-legislative-framework/market-surveillance/index_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation 765-2008 applies for consumer products and Regulation 882-2004 applies for food products. For medicines studies are carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=EDQM|title=Market Surveillance Studies|url=http://www.edqm.eu/en/market-surveillance-studies-48.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toys   
At European Union level three Directorates General are in charge: Health and consumers, Enterprise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=European  Commission|title=Single market for goods Market surveillance|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/single-market-goods/internal-market-for-products/market-surveillance/index_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Customs. EFTA is also putting efforts in market surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=EFTA|title=Product Safety and Market Surveillance|url=http://www.efta.int/eea/policy-areas/goods/product-sectors/product-safety-market-surveillance.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Prosafe for consumer products ( Regulation 765-2008)'''
Prosafe is an organisation that helps European Market Surveillance authorities cooperate better. The European Commission financially supports its activities. Prosafe is active in training, better communication between Member States and also does [[Joint Action]]s (JA) that bring together some Member States to control the same products at the same period, like [[lighter]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prosafe|title=2009 Lighters 2|url=http://www.prosafe.org/default.asp?itemID=68&amp;itemTitle=undefined}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[lawnmower]]s or [[sunbed]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=European Commission|title=Joint action on sunbeds 2008 2009|url=http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/citizen/my_safety/sunbeds/sunbeds_report_2008-2009_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''RAPEX'''
For consumer goods an information system about [[dangerous goods]] has been set up, which is called RAPEX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=European Commission|title=RAPEX - Latest notifications|url=http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/dyna/rapex/rapex_archives_en.cfm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515074207/http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/dyna/rapex/rapex_archives_en.cfm|archivedate=2013-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every week, one can see which products were voluntarily recalled or which were retrieved from the market by the authorities. 
RAPEX is one element of the General Product Safety Directive (GPSD) which ensures high level of protection of consumers by stating key elements for the safety of the products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eurlex EU|title=Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety (Text with EEA relevance)|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0095:EN:NOT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''ADCO''' 
ADCO stand for Administrative Cooperation Group. Representatives of Member States meet to exchange information and discuss about issues regarding the implementation of the directive(s) followed by the working group. The European Commission is also present. ADCO groups discuss about specific laws like PED&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=European Commission|title=Pressure equipment and gas appliances surveillance|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/pressure-and-gas/pressure-equipment/surveillance_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; or EMC Electro [[Magnetic]] Compatibility &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=European Commission|title=Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) -Guidance|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/electrical/documents/emc/guidance/index_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also LVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=European Commission|first=Enterprise DG|title=Low Voltage Directive - ADCO|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/electrical/documents/lvd/guidance/adco/index_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Industry'''
The European industry is now asking for more market surveillance, be it from companies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stråberg Electrolux|first=Hans|title=Market surveillance benefits consumers and thereby the industry|url=http://www.se2009.eu/polopoly_fs/1.16019!menu/standard/file/3Safe%20Products%20-%20Hans%20Str%C3%A5berg%20Speech.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the industry associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Orgalime|title=Efficient and effective Market Surveillance: a priority to preserve the benefits of the Internal Market and the competitiveness of legitimate manufacturers|url=http://www.orgalime.org/position/efficient-and-effective-market-surveillance-priority-preserve-benefits-internal-market-and}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Market surveillance and border controls are essential to fulfil policy goals such as health and safety of end-users, protection of the environment and establishment of a fair level playing field among economic operators.

If market surveillance fails to fulfil its function, non compliant products circulate freely in the internal market, posing risk to end-users. Moreover, lawful manufacturers face unfair competition from rogue traders who simply do not invest in product compliance and traceability, who add between 2% to 25% on product costs (depending on the product category). It is also estimated that a high percentage of cases of non-compliance in certain product categories discredit the image of all the products of this kind, even the compliant ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Orgalime|title=legitimate manufacturers benefit from improved product safety and market surveillance package|url=http://www.orgalime.org/news/legitimate-manufacturers-benefit-improved-product-safety-and-market-surveillance-package}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Industry Support platform was launched in 2011 - The web-platform is designed to serve as a resource database of technical documents from European machinery industries. Information is available by sector and will be made available in several languages. In addition, the website is enriched with testimonials from industrialists and any other relevant information market surveillance.

European machinery industries which link up in this initiative show firm commitment to help improve market surveillance for capital goods in the EU. This voluntary initiative should be seen as complementary to governmental efforts under the EU’s New Legislative Framework for marketing of products. It testifies to the commitment of industry to help maintain high levels of health, safety and environmental standards and ensure a level playing field in the single market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Orgalime|title=Market Surveillance – Industry’s Support Platform|url=http://machinery-surveillance.eu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Customs'''
The European customs are now more involved in market surveillance and with the Regulation 768/2008 are drafting guidelines to check in a more efficient manner products entering the European market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mynar|first=Libor|title=Customs 2013 project|url=http://www.egmf.org/scripts/tinyMCE/plugins/filemanager/files/4_PROSAFE_GA_Budapest-Guidelines_product_safety.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lack of market surveillance ==
Market surveillance is key to a level playing field competition for companies and is vital for consumer safety.
The lack of market surveillance has been pointed out by many players in Europe, especially in [[France]] by a member of the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=Yvon|title=En finir avec la mondialisation déloyale|year=2012|publisher=La Documentation Française|pages=303|url=http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/var/storage/rapports-publics/124000168/0000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the European Parliament voices are also heard about the risk posed to the single market by the lack of market surveillance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Banks|first=Martin|title=Senior MEP Malcolm Harbour has called for a "clear political commitment" to complete the single market.|url=http://www.theparliament.com/latest-news/article/newsarticle/leading-mep-says-eus-single-market-should-not-be-taken-for-granted/|newspaper=The Parliament magazine|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411104052/http://www.theparliament.com/latest-news/article/newsarticle/leading-mep-says-eus-single-market-should-not-be-taken-for-granted/|archivedate=2013-04-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some articles conformity is easy to check like clothes but some industrial products are difficult to check due to lack of time or lack of knowledge from market surveillance authorities.
The amount of products arriving each day for example in Europe is extremely high.

A '''Multi-evaporator system''' is a [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] system generally consisting of four major components:
* 1.[[Evaporator]]
* 2.[[Gas compressor|Compressor]]
* 3.[[Condenser (heat transfer)|Condenser]]
* 4.[[Thermal expansion valve]]

Sometimes in a refrigerator several loads are varied. Refrigerators used to function at different loads operated under different condition of temperatures and pressures. There may be arrangements possible for multi evaporators on the basis of single or multi compressors. If refrigerant from each evaporator compressed in the same single compressor then it is called as Multi-evaporator single-compressor system.

== Single Compressor-Individual Expansion Valve==
A two evaporator single compressor with ''individual expansion valves'' for each evaporator after passing through the back pressure valve enters into the compressors and hence there is a significant rise in temperature is observed. 
This system helps in dropping the pressure from high pressure evaporators with the help of back pressure valves. The high pressure ratio is obtained which necessarily compresses the vapor to high extent from the higher temperature evaporators to condenser temperature. This kind of refrigerator has greater application in load varying purpose. Moreover, high value of COP and better operating economy is observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Refrigertion and air conditi|last=A|first=D|publisher=df|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=sfs|last=fs|first=sf|publisher=sds|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass flow rate through evaporators :-

m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=Heat through evaporator 1(Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)÷(specific enthalpy difference in evaporator 1)

m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=Heat through evaporator 1(Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)÷(specific enthalpy difference in evaporator 2))

The net Work done is :-
*  W = (Sum of masses through evaporator 1 and evaporator 2)*(specific enthalpy difference in compressor)
*  W = (m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)*(h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)

'''Nasser Ibrahim Al-Rashid''' (born 1939) ({{lang-ar|ناصر إبراهيم الرشيد الليلا}}) is a [[Saudi]] businessman. He is reputedly an influential advisor to the [[Saudi royal family]] and a US dollar billionaire. However he is not included in the ''[[Forbes]]'' list of the world's richest people as his personal wealth, like that of many Saudi insiders, cannot be assessed with much accuracy from publicly available information.

Al-Rashid completed his B.S. at the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] in 1965, and his PhD at the university in 1970. He has since remained a prominent donor to the University of Texas, and has been honoured by the university at its Distinguished Alumnus Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name="Communications1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emmis Communications|title=The Alcalde|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yNYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA19|date=March 1992|publisher=Emmis Communications|pages=19–|issn=1535-993X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dr Nasser Ibrahim Al-Rashid Strength and Training Center at the university is named in his honour. He is also a large donor to the [[University of Miami]] (FL) and its medical school. He owns one of the largest yachts in the world, the ''[[Lady Moura]]'', which reportedly cost over [[US$]]200 mm to build in the late 1980s. In March 1987 Al-Rashid was one of the guests at a state banquet hosted by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] for [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]] at Buckingham Palace.&lt;ref name=TimesMar87&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Court Circular|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=wes_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=IF500264869&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|accessdate=13 November 2015|work=The Times|issue=62725|date=25 March 1987|page=16|subscription=yes|via=The Times Digital Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His previous wife, [[Mouna Ayoub]], a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] woman, is considered to be a French socialite. Ayoub subsequently wrote a memoir of their marriage, ''La vérité (The Truth)'', in which Nasser Ibrahim Al-Rashid is referred to as "Amir al-Tharik".&lt;ref name=TelegOct15&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/27/style/tmagazine/t_w_1505_remix_eastern_.html|title=Petro Dollies|author=Sameer Reddy|date=24 October 2015|work=The New York Times|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the memoir Ayoub likened her marriage to a "...a gilded cage where I felt myself to be unjustly treated and powerless...I was given the most sumptuous dresses and amassed a huge collection of jewels, yet I could only wear my black Arab robe and a veil. I was forbidden to speak to men, forbidden to see female friends not approved by my husband, forbidden to play sport, forbidden to laugh, or speak loudly in public." Al-Rashid and his eldest son with Ayoub subsequently sued the publishers of the memoir in the French courts to try and stop publication of the memoir, alleging a breach of their privacy.&lt;ref name=GuardJun00&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jun/20/jonhenley|title=Style victim blames it all on Saudis|author=Jon Henley|date=20 June 2000|work=The Guardian|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is currently married to Safia El Malqui, they have been together since early 1998. Not much is known publicly of al-Rashid, who prior to taking delivery of his yacht, maintained a relatively low profile among the wealthy Saudi elite.

Nasser Ibrahim Al-Rashid was one of three Saudi Arabian businessmen to donate over $US1 million to the [[Clinton Presidential Center]].&lt;ref name=TimesNov98&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Distant donors|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=wes_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=IF503798530&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|accessdate=13 November 2015|work=The Times|issue=69486|date=20 November 2008|page=48|subscription=yes|via=The Times Digital Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
*On Saturday 19 May 2007, one of his yachts, ''[[Lady Moura]]'', nearly ran aground by the [[Cannes]] coastline during the film festival, where it suffered  hull damage and took on water. It was moored in Monaco. On 2 February 2010 ''Lady Moura'' was moored in [[Palma, Majorca]], however it has since returned to Monaco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tf1.lci.fr/infos/france/faits-divers/0,,3450496,00-enorme-yacht-echoue-baie-cannes-.html Mer : Un énorme yacht s'échoue en baie de Cannes - France&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the SBDC==

The '''Small Business Administration''' ('''SBA''') is a United States government agency that provides support to small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sba.gov/aboutsba/index.html Small Business Administration]&lt;/ref&gt; The SBA was created by way of the '''Small Business Act''' of July 30, 1953.  The Small Business Development Center program grew out of the '''University Business Development Center''' (UBDC) program.  A 1976 press release announcing the UBDC proclaimed that this new concept "could increase substantially the leverage SBA can provide in counseling and advising small business concerns."  The pilot program for the UBDC was established at California State Polytechnic University at Pomona in 1976.  Throughout 1977 seven more universities received funding, including Georgia, Missouri, Nebraska, and Maine.

By 1979, the UBDC program was renamed the SBDC program, and pilot centers existed at sixteen states across the U.S.  By 1980, performance surveys of SBDC clients, as well as existing small business owners, saw fit to expand the SBDC project throughout the country.  On July 2, 1980, President Carter signed into law the Small Business Development Act of 1980.  This act provided $8.5 million in annual funding.  In 1984, a program was established in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asbdc-us.org Association of Small Business Development Centers]&lt;/ref&gt;
The SBA in a 1985 report noted that, "Several SBDC's have established separate International Trade Centers (ITC) as part of their state-wide operations.  These international trade centers are currently located in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana and Pennsylvania.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sba.gov/ Small Business Administration]&lt;/ref&gt;

An SBDC was established in Guam in 1995 and in May 2000, the 58th SBDC program was established when the SBA funded an SBDC program for American Samoa.  In 2004, federal lawmakers reauthorized the SBDC program for two additional years, at a funding level of $135,000,000.

==History of the NYS SBDC==

The NYSSBDC Central Office created a Central Library in 1991 to provide reference service to SBDC personnel and manage reference materials.  In 1993 the program hired several information researchers to perform business research and respond to an average of 7,000 information requests annually for SBDCs across the U.S.  In 2001, the newest Regional Center at LaGuardia Community College SBDC was established as part of the program's response to the World Trade Center attacks.

==Partners and Sponsors==

The NYSSBDC is partnered with various government agencies, business and professional associations, economic development entities, and corporations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyssbdc.org/ Official Site]&lt;/ref&gt; The list of NYS SBDC sponsors and partners includes:

{{redirects here|Newsworthy|the New Zealand television programme|Newsworthy (TV programme)}}
Among the many lists of '''news values''' that have been drawn up by scholars and journalists, some, like Galtung and Ruge's, attempt to describe news practices across cultures, while others have become remarkably specific to the press of certain (often Western) nations. These lists show the considerable overlap in the conceptualization of news values, while at the same time point to the vastly different aspects of news production that news values may refer to (see further discussion of this point in the section ‘Conditions of news’ below).&lt;ref&gt;Caple, H. &amp; Bednarek, M. (2013), Delving into the Discourse: Approaches to News Values in Journalism Studies and Beyond. Working Paper. Oxford: The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, University of Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

Galtung and Ruge, in their seminal study in the area put forward a system of twelve factors describing events that together are used as a definition of 'newsworthiness'. Focusing on newspapers and broadcast news, Galtung and Ruge devised a list describing what they believed were significant contributing factors as to how the news is constructed. Their theory argues that the more an event accessed these criteria the more likely it was to be reported on in a newspaper. Furthermore, three basic hypotheses are presented by Galtung and Ruge: the additivity hypothesis that the more factors an event satisfies, the higher the probability that it becomes news; the complementarity hypothesis that the factors will tend to exclude each other; and the exclusion hypothesis that events that satisfy none or very few factors will not become news.

According to A. Boyd: "News journalism has a broadly agreed set of values, often referred to as 'newsworthiness'..."&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, A. (1994) Broadcast Journalism, Techniques of Radio and TV News. Oxford: Focal.&lt;/ref&gt;The language of news is linear, elaborating on event report along a single dimension with added information, illustration, quotation and discussion. More often than not it is the news values of a particular event that slots it into the number one position but perceptions as regards news values can differ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ukessays.com/essays/media/news-and-news-values-media-essay.php |title=News and News Values|last=Mohn|first=Julian|date=2016|website= |archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; News values, sometimes called news criteria, determine how much attention a news story is given by a media outlet, and the attention it is given by the audience.  They explain how editors and other journalists decide that one piece of information is news while another is not.&lt;ref name="Spencer-Thomas 2011"&gt;{{Cite web | title = News Values | last = Spencer-Thomas | first = Owen | work = [[Owen Spencer-Thomas]] | date = 2011 | accessdate = 2018-09-18 | url = http://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; News values are not universal and can vary widely between different cultures.  In Western practice, decisions on the selection and prioritization of news are made by editors on the basis of their experience and intuition, although analysis by J. Galtung and M. Ruge showed that several factors are consistently applied across a range of news organizations.This theory tested on the news presented in four different Norwegian newspapers from the Congo and Cuba crises of July 1960 and the Cyprus crisis of March-April 1964, and the data are in the majority of cases found to be consistent with their theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Galtung| first1= J.| last2 = Holmboe Ruge| first2= M. | year = 1965| title = The Structure of Foreign News.

&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these factors are listed below, together with others put forward by Schlesinger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author =Schlesinger P. | date= 1987| title = ''Putting 'Reality' Together''| edition= 2nd| location = London| publisher = Methuen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author =Bell A.| year =1991| title = ''The Language of News Media| location = Oxford| publisher = Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Ryan, "there is no end to lists of news criteria".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Ryan, C| year =1991 | title =Prime Time Activism: Media Strategies for Grassroots Organizing| location = Boston| publisher = South End Press| page = 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001, this 1965 study was updated by Tony Harcup and Deirdre O'Neill, in a study of the British press. The findings of a content analysis of three major national newspapers in the UK were used to evaluate critically Galtung and Ruge's original criteria and to propose a contemporary set of news values. Forty years on, they found some notable differences, including the rise of celebrity news values and that good news (as well as bad news) was a significant news value, as well as the newspaper's own agenda. They examined three tabloid news papers.

A variety of external and internal pressures influence journalists' decisions on which stories are covered, how issues are interpreted and the emphasis given to them. These pressures can sometimes lead to bias or unethical reporting. Achieving relevance, giving audiences the news they want and find interesting, is an increasingly important goal for media outlets seeking to  maintain market share in a rapidly evolving market.  This has made news organizations more open to audience input and feedback, and forced them to adopt and apply news values that attract and keep audiences. 
Given these changes and the rapid rise of digital technology in recent years, Harcup and O’Neill updated their own study in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2016.1150193 | title=What is news? | journal=Journalism Studies | volume=18 | issue=12 | pages=1–19| url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/95423/11/WRRO_95423.pdf | year=2017 | last1=Harcup | first1=Tony | last2=o'Neill | first2=Deirdre }}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of interactive media and [[citizen journalism]] is fast altering the traditional distinction between news producer and passive audience and may in future lead to a deep-ploughing redefinition of what 'news' means and the role of the news industry. Social media enable members of the public both to access and to give an account of evidence crucial to the reporting of a story that is missed by the official media.&lt;ref name="Spencer-Thomas 2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Citizen Journalism | last = Spencer-Thomas | first = Owen | work = [[Owen Spencer-Thomas]] | date = 2013 | accessdate = 2018-09-12 | url = https://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/citizen-journalism/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Hal Pashler and Gail Heriot published a study showing that perceptions of newsworthiness tend to be contaminated by a political usefulness bias.  In other words, individuals tend to view stories that give them "ammunition" for their political views as more newsworthy. They give credence to their own views.&lt;ref&gt;Hal Pashler and Gail Heriot, [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3225878 Perceptions of Newsworthiness are Contaminated by a Political Usefulness Bias], Royal Society Open Science (2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions for news==
*'''Frequency''': Events that occur suddenly and fit well with the news organization's schedule are more likely to be reported than those that occur gradually or at inconvenient times of day or night. Long-term trends are not likely to receive much coverage.
*'''Familiarity''': To do with people or places close to home.
*'''Negativity''': Bad news is more newsworthy than good news.
*'''Unexpectedness''': If an event is out of the ordinary it will have a greater effect than something that is an everyday occurrence.
*'''Unambiguity''': Events whose implications are clear make for better copy than those that are open to more than one interpretation, or where any understanding of the implications depends on first understanding the complex background in which the events take place.
*'''Personalization''': Events that can be portrayed as the actions of individuals will be more attractive than one in which there is no such "human interest."
*'''Meaningfulness''': This relates to the sense of identification the audience has with the topic. "Cultural proximity" is a factor here—stories concerned with people who speak the same language, look the same, and share the same preoccupations as the audience receive more coverage than those concerned with people who speak different languages, look different and have different preoccupations.
*'''Reference to elite nations''': Stories concerned with global powers receive more attention than those concerned with less influential nations.
*'''Reference to elite persons''': Stories concerned with the rich, powerful, famous and infamous get more coverage.
*'''Conflict''': Opposition of people or forces resulting in a dramatic effect. Stories with conflict are often quite newsworthy.
*'''Consonance''': Stories that fit with the media's expectations receive more coverage than those that defy them (and for which they are thus unprepared). Note this appears to conflict with unexpectedness above. However, consonance really refers to the ''media's readiness'' to report an item.
*'''Continuity''': A story that is already in the news gathers a kind of inertia. This is partly because the media organizations are already in place to report the story, and partly because previous reportage may have made the story more accessible to the public (making it less ambiguous).
*'''Composition''': Stories must compete with one another for space in the media. For instance, editors may seek to provide a balance of different types of coverage, so that if there is an excess of foreign news for instance, the least important foreign story may have to make way for an item concerned with the domestic news. In this way the prominence given to a story depends not only on its own news values but also on those of competing stories. (Galtung and Ruge, 1965)
*'''Competition''': Commercial or professional competition between media may lead journalists to endorse the news value given to a story by a rival.
*'''Co-optation''':  A story that is only marginally newsworthy in its own right may be covered if it is related to a major running story.
*'''Prefabrication''':  A story that is marginal in news terms but written and available may be selected ahead of a much more newsworthy story that must be researched and written from the ground up.
*'''Predictability''':  An event is more likely to be covered if it has been pre-scheduled. (Bell, 1991)
*'''Time constraints''':  Traditional news media such as radio, television and daily newspapers have strict deadlines and a short production cycle, which selects for items that can be researched and covered quickly.
*'''Logistics''': Although eased by the availability of global communications even from remote regions, the ability to deploy and control production and reporting staff, and functionality of technical resources can determine whether a story is covered. (Schlesinger, 1987)
*'''Data''': Media need to back up all of their stories with data in order to remain relevant and reliable. Reporters prefer to look at raw data in order to be able to take an unbiased perspective.
What should be clear from this list of conditions for news is that many different factors have the potential to influence whether an event is first noticed by a news organisation, second whether a story will be written about that event, and third whether this story will end up being published as news. To give a few examples:

Some researchers (e.g.  Galtung &amp; Ruge 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;67; Bell 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;159; Gans 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;78–9; and Brighton &amp; Foy 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;26) suggest that Composition and Co-option are news values that concern how news stories fit with the other stories around them. The aim here is to ensure a balanced spread of stories with minimal duplication across a news program or edition (Brighton &amp; Foy 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;26).

Editors have a particular target audience in mind. Each news output has its own system of setting its news agenda.&lt;ref name="Spencer-Thomas 2011"&gt;{{Cite web | title = News Values | last = Spencer-Thomas | first = Owen | work = [[Owen Spencer-Thomas]] | date = 2011 | accessdate = 2018-09-18 | url = http://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other conditions/criteria relate to the news agenda. Here some researchers propose the news values of Frequency, Continuity, The News Barrier, Predictability, Follow-up and News Agenda among others (Galtung &amp; Ruge 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;66-7; Østgaard 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;51; Schulz 1982, p.&amp;nbsp;151; Bell 1991, pp.&amp;nbsp;15, 151; Harcup &amp; O’Neill 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;279). Bell (1991, p.&amp;nbsp;15) sums up the rationale for considering these as news values by stating quite simply that ‘once something is in the news, it tends to stay there’. This means that when an issue is on the news agenda, other events concerning the same issue are more likely to be reported as news because they fit the news agenda.

Other criteria listed above relate quite specifically to the news actors or events that have the potential to be reported as news. Personalization, for example, concerns the actions of individuals and whether an event can be contextualised in more personal terms (affecting specific people, not the generalised masses).

Some researchers try to tease apart the different aspects of the news production process that these conditions apply to as well as the many different perspectives from which news values can be viewed and analysed. For example, recent research by Bednarek &amp; Caple (2017) adopts a discursive perspective on news values analysis, and examines only those news values that relate specifically to news actors and the events they are involved in. Their approach to the systematic analysis of news values in both verbal and visual news reporting is called discursive news values analysis, or DNVA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsvaluesanalysis.com/|title=Discursive News Values Analysis|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Audience perceptions of news==

Conventional models concentrate on what the journalist perceives as news.  But the news process is a two-way transaction, involving both news producer (the journalist) and the news receiver (the audience), although  boundary between the two is rapidly blurring with the growth of citizen journalism and interactive media.

Little has been done to define equivalent factors that determine audience perception of news.  This is largely because it would appear impossible to define a common factor, or factors, that generate interest in a mass audience.

Basing his judgement on many years as a newspaper journalist Hetherington (1985) states that: “…anything  which threatens people’s peace, prosperity and well being is news and likely to make headlines”.
 
Whyte-Venables (2012) suggests audiences may interpret news as a risk signal.  Psychologists and primatologists have shown that apes and humans constantly monitor the environment for information that may signal the possibility of physical danger or threat to the individual’s social position. This receptiveness to risk signals is a powerful and virtually universal survival mechanism.

A 'risk signal' is characterized by two factors, an element of change (or uncertainty) and the relevance of that change to the security of the individual.

The same two conditions are observed to be characteristic of news. The news value of a story, if defined in terms of the interest it carries for an audience, is determined by the degree of change it contains and the relevance that change has for the individual or group. Analysis shows that journalists and publicists manipulate both the element of change and relevance (‘security concern’) to maximize, or some cases play down, the strength of a story.

Security concern is proportional to the relevance of the story for the individual, his or her family, social group and societal group, in declining order.  At some point there is a Boundary of Relevance, beyond which the change is no longer perceived to be relevant, or newsworthy.  This boundary may be manipulated by journalists, power elites and communicators seeking to encourage audiences to exclude, or embrace, certain groups: for instance, to distance a home audience from the enemy in time of war, or conversely, to highlight the plight of a distant culture so as to encourage support for aid programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Source-Journalism-News-Values-Landau-ebook/dp/B01LXSGES2/|title=Source Journalism and News Values|last=Landau|first=Joel|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=9781365446894|location=|pages=1|language=English|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary perspectives ==
An [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for why negative news have a higher news value than positive news starts with the empirical observation that the human perceptive system and lower level brain functions have difficulty distinguishing between media stimuli and real stimuli. These lower level brain mechanisms which function on a subconscious level make basic evaluations of perceptive stimuli, focus attention on important stimuli, and start basic emotional reactions. Research has also found that the brain differentiates between negative and positive stimuli and reacts quicker and more automatically to negative stimuli which are also better remembered. This likely has evolutionary explanations with it often being important to quickly focus attention on, evaluate, and quickly respond to threats. While the reaction to a strong negative stimulus is to avoid, a moderately negative stimulus instead causes curiosity and further examination. Negative media news is argued to fall into the latter category which explains their popularity. Lifelike audiovisual media are argued to have particularly strong effects compared to reading.&lt;ref name=AEP&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grabe|first1=Maria Elizabeth|title=News as reality-inducing, survival-relevant, and gender-specific stimuli. In S. Craig Roberts (Ed.), Applied Evolutionary Psychology (Chapter 22)|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780199586073|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women have on average stronger avoidance reactions to moderately negative stimuli. They point to negative news as the main reason for avoiding international news. The stronger avoidance reaction to moderately negative stimuli can be explained evolutionary as it being the role of men to investigate and potentially respond aggressively to the threat while women and children withdraw. Men and women also differ on average on how they enjoy, evaluate, remember, comprehend, and identify with the people in negative news depending on if the news are negatively or positively framed. One explanation may be that the negative news are framed according to male preferences by the often male journalists who cover such news and that a more positive framing may attract a larger female audience.&lt;ref name=AEP/&gt;

A '''parallel import''' is a non-[[counterfeit]] [[good (accounting)|product]] imported from another country without the permission of the [[intellectual property]] owner. Parallel imports are often referred to as [[grey market|grey product]] and are implicated in issues of [[international trade]], and [[intellectual property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/glossary_e/parallel_imports_e.htm|title=WTO - Glossary - parallel imports|website=www.wto.org|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel importing is based on concept of [[exhaustion of intellectual property rights]]: according to this concept, when the product is first launched on the market in a particular jurisdiction, parallel importation is authorized to all residents in the state in question. Some countries allow it but others do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inta.org/Advocacy/Pages/ParallelImportsGrayMarket.aspx|title=Parallel Imports/Gray Market|website=www.inta.org|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel importing of pharmaceuticals reduces price of pharmaceuticals by introducing competition; [[TRIPS agreement]] in Article 6 states that this practice cannot be challenged under the WTO dispute settlement system and so is effectively a matter of national discretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/factsheet_pharm02_e.htm|title=WTO - Intellectual property (TRIPS) - fact sheet - pharmaceuticals - 2|website=www.wto.org|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of parallel importing is often advocated in the case of software, music, printed texts and electronic products, and occurs for several reasons:

# Different versions of a product are produced for sale in different markets: the UK edition of [[Top Gear Magazine]] is officially sold in the UK, and [[Top Gear Australia (magazine)|Top Gear Australia]] is officially sold in Australia. However some unofficial distributors in [[Australia]] also sell the UK edition of Top Gear Magazine.
# Companies, either the manufacturer or the distributor, set different [[price points]] for their products in different markets. Parallel importers ordinarily purchase products in one country at a price (P1) which is cheaper than the price at which they are sold in a second country (P2), import the products into the second country, and benefitting from [[arbitrage]], sell the products in that country at a price which is usually between P1 and P2.
# Consumers who are able to obtain more competitively priced items and may be able to avoid local sales taxes, are placed on an even footing with consumers who have less access to overseas sales online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Question ANswered |url=https://www.alia.org.au/advocacy/copyright/your.ques.answered.html |accessdate=16 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515131714/http://www.alia.org.au/advocacy/copyright/your.ques.answered.html |archivedate=15 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Some advocacy groups support parallel importing on the grounds of enhancing the free flow of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alia.org.au/advocacy/copyright/your.ques.answered.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825182748/http://www.alia.org.au/advocacy/copyright/your.ques.answered.html |archivedate=25 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International approach==
Parallel importing is regulated differently in different jurisdictions; there is no consistency in laws dealing with parallel imports between countries. Neither the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] nor the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention]] explicitly prohibit parallel importation.

===Australia===
The Australian market is an example of a relatively small consumer market which does not benefit from the economies of scale and competition available in the larger global economies. Australia tends to have lower levels of competition in many industries and oligopolies are common in industries like banking, supermarkets, and mobile telecommunications.

Private Enterprise will use product segmentation strategies to legally maximise profit. This often includes varying the service levels, pricing and product features to improve so called "fit" to the local marketplace. However this segmentation may mean an identical products at often higher prices. This can be termed "Price Discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winning entry for the Kirby Cup 2012 {{!}} Saving the right to parallel import in a digital world|url=http://www.alrc.gov.au/winning-entry-kirby-cup-2012-saving-right-parallel-import-digital-world |date=22 Nov 2012 |accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of the Internet, Australian consumers can readily compare prices globally and have been able to identify products exhibiting Price Discrimination, also known as the "[[Australia Tax]]".

In 1991, the Australian Government resolved to remove parallel import restrictions from a range of products except cars. It followed this up with legislation making it legal to source music and software CDs from overseas and import them into Australia. An Australian Productivity Commission report recommended in July 2009 that legislation be extended to legalise the parallel importing of books, with three years' notice for publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hudson|first1=Andrew|title=Australia: Productivity Commission Recommends Removal Of Parallel Import Protection For Books|url=http://www.mondaq.com/australia/article.asp?articleid=83242|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission also recommended abolishing restrictions on parallel importing of cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Charlwood|first1=Sam|title=Cheaper second-hand imported cars a step closer|url=http://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/cheaper-secondhand-imported-cars-a-step-closer-20140214-32prt.html|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal Court of Australia [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCAFC/2012/130.html decision] shows that parallel imported items with valid trademark are subject to [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/tma1995121/s123.html Section 123 of the Trade Mark Act].

Various Parliament of Australia committees have investigated allegations of Price Discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House of Representatives Committees|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/house_of_representatives_committees?url=ic/itpricing/subs.htm|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union/European Economic Area===
The [[European Union]] (and [[European Economic Area]]) requires the doctrine of international exhaustion to exist between member states (contracting states) but EU legislation for trade marks, design rights and copyright prohibits its application to goods put on the market outside the EU/EEA.

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], the [[Bundesgerichtshof]] has held that the [[exhaustion of rights|doctrine of international exhaustion]] governs parallel importation, subject to the EU rules above.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, parallel importation is permitted under both, the [[Trade Mark]] and (amended) [[Copyright]] Ordinance before The Copyright (Amendment) Ordinance 2007 came into force 6 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/lawandorder/071212/html/071212en08002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214013629/http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/lawandorder/071212/html/071212en08002.htm |archivedate=14 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }} Seven arrested for copyright infringement&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[Japan]]'s intellectual property rights law prohibits audiovisual articles marketed for export from being sold domestically, and such sale of "re-imported" CDs are illegal.

===United States===
In the [[United States]], legal precedent has established that parallel importation is legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/523/135.html|title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|website=Findlaw|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]], the US Supreme Court held that the [[first-sale doctrine]] applies to copies of a copyrighted work lawfully made abroad, thus permitting importation and resale of many product categories.

Moreover, Science, State, Justice, and Commerce, and Related Agencies, Appropriations Act of 2006 prohibits future FTAs from categorically disallowing the parallel import of patented products.&lt;ref&gt;Shayerah Ilias, Ian Fergusson, “Intellectual Property Rights and International Trade,” Congressional research Service, February 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automobiles==
{{mainarticle|Grey import vehicle}}

===United States===
The United States has unique automobile design legislation administered by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]. Certain car makers find the required modifications too expensive. This creates demand for [[grey import vehicles]], where certain models are modified for individual customers to meet these requirements, at a higher expense than if this were done by the original manufacturer on an [[assembly line]]. This procedure interferes with the marketing scheme of the manufacturer, who might plan to import a less powerful car and force consumers to accept it. The Imported Vehicle Safety Compliance Act of 1988 basically ended the gray market by requiring manufacturer certification of  U.S.-bound cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robinson|first1=Aaron|title=How To: Win the Car-Importing Game|url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/how-to-win-the-car-importing-game/|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallel-imported foodstuffs, etc.==
Markets for parallel imports and locally made products sometimes exist alongside each other even though the parallel imports are markedly more expensive. This may be for various reasons, but is mostly observed in foodstuffs and toiletry.

Due to the nature of hotels, travellers often have little information on where to shop except in the immediate vicinity. Grocery shops opened to serve brand-name hotels often feature parallel-imported foodstuffs and toiletry to cater to travellers so that they can easily recognise the product they have been using at home.

Foodstuffs and toiletry made from different plants may vary in quality because different plants may use materials or reagents (such as water used for washing, food additives) from different sources, although they are usually subject to the same standards by internal QC or public health authorities. A person may be allergic to the foodstuff or toiletry made by some plants but not others.

To sum up, the major reasons for such a market are:

* Lack of information
* Recognisability
* Avoidance of risk due to products by different plants
&lt;!--Appreciated if someone could improve clarity--&gt;

==Issues==
A manifestation of the philosophical divide between those who support various intellectual property and [[Criticism of intellectual property|those who are critical of it]], is the divide over the legitimacy of parallel importation. Some believe that it benefits consumers by lowering prices and widening the selection and consumption of products available in the [[Market (economics)|market]], while others believe that it discourages intellectual property owners from investing in new and [[innovation|innovative]] products. Some also believe that parallel imports tend to facilitate [[copyright infringement]].

This tension essentially concerns the [[rights]] and [[duty|duties]] of a protected [[monopoly]]. Intellectual property rights allow the holder to sell at a price that is higher than the price one would pay in a [[competition|competitive market]], but by doing so the holder relinquishes sales to those who would be prepared to buy at a price between the monopoly price and the competitive price. The presence of parallel imports in the marketplace prevents the holder from exploiting the monopoly further by [[market segmentation]], i.e. by applying different prices to different consumers.

[[Consumer organisation]]s tend to support parallel importation as it offers consumers more choice and lower prices, provided that consumers retain equivalent legal protection to locally sourced products (e.g. in the form of [[warranty|warranties]] with international effect), and competition is not diminished.

However, such organisations also warn consumers of certain risks in using parallel-imported products. Although the products may have been made to comply with the laws and customs of their place of origin, these products or their use may not comply with those in places where they are used, or some of their functions may be rendered unusable or meaningless (which may needlessly drive up prices). Electronic devices, however, suffer less from this type of risk because newer models support more than one user language.

==Examples==

===Australia===
Importation of [[computer games]] and computer game hardware from [[Asia]] is a common practice for some wholesale and/or retail stockists. Many consumers now take advantage of on-line stores in [[Hong Kong]] and the [[United States]] to purchase computer games at or near half the cost of a retail purchase from the Australian RRP. Often the versions sold by the Asian retailers are manufactured in Australia to begin with. An example is [[Crysis]], which was available from Hong Kong on-line stores for approximately $50 AUD but whose retail cost in Australia was close to $100. Crysis was sold in Asia using identical versions of the game box and disc, right down to including Australian censor ratings on the box.

===Hong Kong===
{{See also|Parallel trading in Hong Kong}}
Importation of [[Colgate (toothpaste)|Colgate]] [[toothpaste]] from [[Thailand]] into [[Hong Kong]]. The goods are bought in markets where the price is lower, and sold in markets where the price of the same goods is, for a variety of reasons, higher. Electronic goods like Apple's [[iPad]] are frequently imported in Hong Kong before they're official and resold to South-East Asian early adopters for a premium.

===New Zealand===
The practice exists of luxury [[automobile|car]] dealers in [[New Zealand]] buying [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[vehicle]]s in [[Malaysia]] at a low price, and importing the cars into New Zealand to sell at a price lower than the price offered by Mercedes Benz to New Zealand consumers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} There are also many parallel import dealers of electronics hardware. Parallel importing is allowed in New Zealand and has resulted in a significant lowering of margins on many products. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Poland===
There is an opinion, not scientifically proven, but very popular among people in Poland that "Western" washing powders are more effective in cleaning than Polish, because chemistry companies allegedly produce items of higher quality for Western Europe, not as good as for Poland. Because of that, there are companies and online stores importing Western chemistry supplies to Poland (for example from Germany), even if similar brands are available there.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.luna24.pl/produkty/proszki-do-prania,2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pralinka.pl/Chemia-z-niemiec/niemiecki-proszek-do-prania/|title=Proszki do prania z Niemiec - niemiecka chemia pralinka.pl|first=Trol|last=InterMedia|website=www.pralinka.pl|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Federation===
&lt;!-- according to the rg.ru article, external trade volume is 12 times that of internal trade --&gt;
According to [http://bablaw.livejournal.com/ Anatoliy Semyonov], trademark rights exhaustion turned national in 2002, and, as of April 2013, an act is being prepared that could make original goods imported without a permission of the producer officially "counterfeit" (by replacing things on which "a trademark is located illegally" with things "on which an illegally used trademark is located"). He notes that, according to the [[Criminal Code of Russia|Criminal Code]], illegal use of a trademark can be punished up to 6 years of imprisonment; and a similar article in the [[Offences Code of Russia|Offences Code]] makes goods with an illegal copy of a trademark subject to confiscation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===European Union===
Some [[PlayStation Portable|Sony PSP]] video game consoles were imported into the [[European Economic Area]] from Japan up to twelve months prior to the European launch. The unusual component of this example is that some importers were selling the console for a higher price than the intended EU price, taking advantage of the relative monopoly they enjoyed. After the release the console was commonly imported from the USA where it was retailed for much lower price.

Other example are smart phones, which are being imported from China, where an average device can be bought for about $100 while a similar device would be retailed for about 200€ in the EU.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2336">'''RTMark''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|t|m|ɑr|k}} is an [[anti-consumerism|anti-consumerist]] activist collective, which subverts the "Corporate Shield" that protects American corporations. The name is derived from "Registered [[Trademark]]". 

RTMark is itself a registered corporation which brings together activists who plan projects with donors who fund them. It thus operates outside the laws governing human individuals, and benefits from the much looser laws governing corporations.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

RTMark claimed as its first prank the "[[Barbie Liberation Organization]]", in which the voiceboxes of talking [[Barbie]] and [[G.I. Joe]] toys were swapped, and the toys then returned to the store (1993).  The first prank documentable as being truly RTMark-sponsored was the [[SimCopter#Controversy|SimCopter]] "hack" (1996), carried out by founding member [[Jacques Servin]].

Other RTMark stunts were ''gwbush.com'' (a faked campaign Website for [[George W. Bush]]). They were also involved in the [[toywar]] and they brokered a deal so James Baumgartner, the original inventor of ''[[voteauction]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtmark.com/more/nytimesbush0608.html|title=Bush Shows How Not to Handle the Internet, Experts Say|date=8 June 1999|publisher=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; could sell the raw project to [[Ubermorgen|UBERMORGEN]] in Austria.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5151">'''Richard Karl Wilhelm Bruhn''' (25 June 1886 Cismar, now administratively part of [[Grömitz]] &amp;ndash; 8 July 1964 [[Düsseldorf]]) was a German automobile manufacturer and entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cismar.de/audi.htm www.cismar.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parentage==
Bruhn was the son of a shoe maker called Heinrich Christian Emil Bruhn and his wife Karoline Ernestine Bruhn (born Glüsing).

==Early career==
On leaving his elementary school Bruhn undertook an apprenticeship as an electrician before switching to a career in Business.   In 1907 he took a clerical position in the engineering section of [[AEG]] in [[Bremen]].

In 1910 Bruhn took charge of AEG’s  [[London]] commercial office.   He undertook [[First World War|war service]] between 1914 and 1918, and after the war he became a student at the [[University of Kiel]], emerging in 1921 with a doctorate in Economics. 
  
Directly after this Bruhn took a commercial directorship with [[:de: Hagenuk|Neufeldt &amp; Kuhnke]] in [[Kiel]], and in 1927 he joined the board of directors at [[Junkers]] in [[Dessau]].   He moved again in 1929, this time to [[Chemnitz]] where he became a director at [[:de: Hermann Pöge|Pöge Elektricitäts-AG]].

==Bruhn's move into the auto-sector==
A move into the automotive sector came in 1930 when a regional bank, the Sächsische Staatsbank, mandated him to join the board of the “Zschopauer Motorenwerke J. S. Rasmussen (DKW)”, a dynamic but structurally convoluted and financially troubled automaker in which the bank was heavily invested.   Two years later, as part of a vigorous rationalisation designed to protect the future of the business, the [[Auto Union]] company was created, comprising four automobile brands that the automotive entrepreneur [[Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen]] had acquired and built up over the years.   Bruhn himself was installed as Chairman of the new company in 1932, which aligned with the wishes of the company’s bankers but would create tensions with Rasmussen whose vision and energy had built up the businesses in the first place.   Two years later, in 1934, it was Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen who resigned from the company.   Bruhn stayed till 1945.

On 7 May 1945 Bruhn left [[Chemnitz]], along with many of his fellow citizens.   Although the area had been liberated by the [[American army]], it had already been agreed between the victor powers under the [[Potsdam Agreement]] that [[Thuringia|the entire region]] would fall within the [[Soviet Occupation Zone]] and many Germans fled to the western part of Germany at this time.  Bruhn, who had been a member of the [[Nazi Party]] during the Hitler years, was interned by [[:de: Control Commission for Germany/British Element|the British]].   He underwent the [[denazification]] process.   As an Auto Union director he accepted his share of the responsibility for the employment of [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] at the company’s plants during the [[Second World War|war]], but he was nevertheless released, and by the end of 1945 had been able to relocate to [[Ingolstadt]] in Bavaria (which was in the [[:de: Amerikanische Besatzungszone|American occupation zone]]).   Auto Union’s small DKW-badged cars had sold well during the 1930s, and were generally too small and slow to have been commandeered by the German military during the war or by the armies of the occupying powers after it.   Many pre-war DKWs survived the war and in December 1945 it was possible to create in Ingolsadt the "Central depot for Auto Union replacement parts" (“Zentraldepot für Auto Union Ersatzteile GmbH “).   The longer term outlook for any form of German manufacturing industry remained at this stage unclear, and Auto Union’s plant, located in the Soviet zone, was out of reach.  But with financing from the [[:de: Bayerische Staatsregierung|Bavarian Regional government]] and [[Marshall Plan]] funding, it was possible to create in September 1949 a new company in [[West Germany]] called [[Auto Union|Auto Union GmbH]], and based at the Ingolstadt parts depot.   Richard Buhn was the company’s first boss.   At this stage automobile production was established in a rented factory several hundred kilometers to the west, in [[Düsseldorf]], but in due course it would be possible to finance and built a car plant at the new company’s spacious site in Ingolstadt.    The first Ingolstadt-produced [[Audi]] car would emerge from the factory, by now owned by the [[Volkswagen]] group, in 1964, the year of Bruhn’s death.

On May 26, 2014, a new investigative report was issued by AUDI that condemned Bruhn for close association with Nazi leaders and extensive use of concentration camp inmates as forced labor. http://www.thelocal.de/20140526/audi-used-forced-labour-under-nazis-in-germany

'''Rodd Partridge''' (born 30 December 1976) is an Australian born retailer and private investor.

Partridge is regarded as intensely private and somewhat reclusive, his only recent media interview was with Spanish newspaper Cinco Dias&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cincodias.com/articulo/empresas/grupo-britanico-Partridge-compra-almacenes-Sepu/20011112cdscdiemp_12/ El grupo británico Partridge compra los almacenes Sepu en Cincodias.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; after his group's acquisition of the retailing group [[SEPU]]. Partridge currently heads [[Invicta Partners]], a [[private equity]] firm based in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], and he is understood to hold a number of investments throughout the Pacific and South America. Partridge closed the Spanish retail operations in 2002, facing intensive protests from employees and extensive media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/madrid/paraiso/gangas/Gran/Via/echa/cierre/elpepiautmad/20021001elpmad_14/Tes El paraíso de las gangas de la Gran Vía echa el cierre · ELPAÍS.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/madrid/Sepu/cerrado/elpepiautmad/20021013elpmad_3/Tes Sepu, cerrado · ELPAÍS.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettyimages.com.au/detail/91919294/Hulton-Archive Getty Images - Unsupported browser detected&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal ==
Partridge is known to fence, surf and be a strong supporter of the [[Rugby Union]] code. One of Partridge's quirks is that although his enterprises often retail alcohol, Partridge himself is, by personal choice, a strict [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]]. 
Originally a military and pastoral family, it is understood Partridge's ancestors arrived in Australia from the United Kingdom in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://colsec.records.nsw.gov.au/indexes/colsec/p/f43c_pa-12.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312095449/http://colsec.records.nsw.gov.au/indexes/colsec/p/F43c_pa-12.htm |archivedate=12 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hastings.nsw.gov.au/www/html/946-local-studies.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

Partridge holds a Master of Business from the [[University of Newcastle, Australia]].

'''São Carlos''' (Saint Charles, in English, {{IPA-pt|sɐ̃w̃ ˈkaʁlus}}; named after [[Charles Borromeo|Saint Charles Borromeo]]) is a city of 246,088&lt;ref name="IBGE" /&gt; inhabitants ([[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]/2017) in the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. It is located at {{coord|22|01|04|S|47|53|27|W|}}, at about 230&amp;nbsp;km from the city of [[São Paulo]].

==History==
The region started to be settled in the end of the 18th century, with the opening of a road that led to the gold mines in [[Cuiabá]] and [[Goiás]]. Leaving from [[Piracicaba]], passing through [[Rio Claro, São Paulo|Rio Claro]], the hills, fields and by typical vegetations of the Brazilian countryside, settlers established in the region. São Carlos' history started in 1831, when the "Pinhal" (Pines) allotment was demarcated.

On the city's foundation date, November 4, 1857, the population resided in some houses around the chapel and the inhabitants were mostly Arruda Botelho's family heirs, who were the first owners of the "Pinhal" alloments. Between 1831 and 1857 the pioneer coffee farms were formed, starting the first economic activity in the city. The coffee crops came to the "Pinhal" farm in 1840 and spread throughout the fertile lands around, becoming the main export item. The city foundation is credited to [[Antônio Carlos de Arruda Botelho, Count of Pinhal]], an influent farmer and entrepreneur.

São Carlos was elevated to [[village]] in 1865, when a "Câmara", or ruling chamber, was created. In 1874, the village had 6,897 inhabitants, as a humble highlight of its fast growth and regional importance. It became a [[city]] in 1880 and in 1886, with a population of 16,104, its urban structure was settled.

The city arises on the coffee crops expansion context, which is relevant to the last two decades of the 19th century and to the first two of the 20th century. The arrival of the railway in 1884 provided an efficient system to transport the [[Coffee production in Brazil|coffee production]] to the [[Port of Santos|Santos harbor]] and boosted the economy of the region. The railway also contributed to the political and economic consolidation of the central area of the city.

When slavery ended, government created incentives to bring in immigrants. São Carlos had already received German nationals brought by the Count of Pinhal in 1876. Between 1880 and 1904, the city was one of the most important immigration centers in São Paulo state, the majority of them being [[Italian Brazilians|Italians]] - specifically, [[Northern Italy|Northern Italians]]. They worked in coffee plantations and in manufacturing factories, as well as trading activities.

In the beginning of the 20th century, countless cultural societies developed social activities aiming to promote literacy. Vittorio Emanuele Society in 1900 and [[Dante Alighieri]] in 1902 were but a few of them. The Italian presence was so significant that during the first half of the 20th century, the Italian government had a consulate branch in São Carlos.

With the [[Wall Street crash of 1929]], coffee production went through a crisis, which made many immigrants leave rural areas for factories, wood artifact production, pottery, and construction.

Farmers had already applied the profits obtained with coffee in the constitution of several types of companies in São Carlos: banks, electricity, cable cars, telephones, water pumps, sewers, theaters, hospitals and schools.  This established a foundation for industrialization in the city. With the arrival of immigrants from other urban centers from the 1930s - 1940s, their expertise was used to consolidate industrialization as the main economic activity in the city. Its peak years were the 1950s, when São Carlos became a manufacturing center, with relevant industrial expression in São Paulo state.

The industrial sector also developed through workshops that incorporated the coffee industry. The manufacture of processing machinery, shoes, fertilizers, hardware, furniture, pasta, cigars, as well as activities such as tailory, breweries, foundries, sawmills, weaving, pottery and pencil production expanded the economy of São Carlos in the 1930s. In the 1950s and 1960s, with the expansion of refrigeration, new factories of machinery and tractors arrived. Numerous small- and medium-sized companies which provided products and services were also established.

In the second half of the 20th century, the city received a boost of technological and higher educational development when in 1953 the Escola de Engenharia de São Carlos, or the Engineering School of the [[University of São Paulo]], was created. In the 1970s, the [[Federal University of São Carlos]] was launched.

==Geography==

São Carlos is located on the geographic center of the São Paulo state, approximately {{convert|231|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[São Paulo|city of São Paulo]]. The city is the center of a [[Microregion of São Carlos|microregion]] with 308,777 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Census of the IBGE - Synopsis - Table 761|url=http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/cd/cd2010sp.asp?o=3&amp;i=P|publisher=IBGE.gov.br|accessdate=22 July 2011|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its altitude is over 856 m, offering a mild altitude climate. Most of the year the city is windy, sunny and with mild temperatures at night. For this reason the city is nicknamed "''Cidade do Clima''" (Weather City) and celebrates once a year an event called "''Festa do Clima''", or "Weather Festival".

The city has a total area of 1.141&amp;nbsp;km², which includes two districts to the north (''Santa Eudóxia'' and ''Água Vermelha''), one district to the west (''Bela Vista São-carlense''), and one district to the east (''Vila Nery'').

On the campaign, Gelman managed communications and ensured quick response from her team. Gelman also worked on the 2013 campaign of the New York City comptroller [[Scott Stringer]]. Most recently she worked in political and social affairs serving as [[Senior Vice-president|Senior Vice President]] at the strategic communications firm [[SKDKnickerbocker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/audrey-gelman-2782315|title=Audrey Gelman LinkedIn|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gelman has been named one of [[Fast Company (magazine)|''Fast Company'']]'s "Most Creative People in Business", [[Forbes|''Forbes'' Magazine]]'s "30 under 30", one of the "50 Most Powerful Women in New York" by ''[[New York Daily News|The New York Daily News]]'', and one of ''[[BuzzFeed|Buzzfeed]]''{{'}}s "21 Amazing Role Models for Twentysomethings."

=== Lauren Kassan ===
Lauren Kassan received her Bachelor of Arts/Science from [[George Washington University|The George Washington University]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/lauren-kassan/#2a1a628345a8|title=Lauren Kassan|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating, Kassan worked with fitness startups. She worked with now big name fitness startups such as SLT—a New York boutique fitness studio—where she eventually became the director of business development. Kassan also worked for [[ClassPass]] where she focused on the development of the startup's studio network. Kassan is well experienced in operations and community management and is the co-founder and [[Chief operating officer|COO]] of the women's co-working space, The Wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/person/lauren-kassan|title=Lauren Kassan, Most Creative People 2017 {{!}} Fast Company|work=Fast Company|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The initial idea for The Wing stemmed from Gelman's personal desire for a space to change and relax between business meetings as she lived in Brooklyn, but worked in SoHo and Washington DC. The first title for this not-yet-created space was "Refresh".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/11/style/the-wing-womens-social-club-magazine.html|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kassan and Gelman began working together, they decided "The Wing" was a more fitting name, since it would represent a "wing" of the users' home away from their actual home. When developing this idea, the two decided to focus on creating a space where women can feel safe and supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/11/style/the-wing-womens-social-club-magazine.html|title=The Wing, a Chic Women's Club, Is Going Wide|last=Rosman|first=Katherine|date=2017-11-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October of 2016, Gelman and Kassan began The Wing's foundation in New York City's [[Flatiron District]], on the [[Ladies' Mile Historic District]]. They subsequently opened another branch in a loft in [[SoHo]]. The Wing opened a new space in April 2018 in [[Brooklyn]] in [[DUMBO]] neighborhood, and spaces in Washington D.C. and San Francisco in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2017/12/04/female-co-working-club-the-wing-new-york-soho-loft/|title=Female co-working club The Wing opens in New York loft|date=4 December 2017|website=dezeen.com|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Ford/&gt;

The Washington, D.C., facility includes a booth dedicated to [[Anita Hill]]. The San Francisco space includes a conference room dedicated to [[Christine Blasey Ford]].&lt;ref name = Ford&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/410616-womens-workspace-dedicates-new-conference-room-to-christine |title=Women's co-working network gives nod to Christine Blasey Ford at new space |publisher=TheHill |date=2018-10-09 |accessdate=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human rights investigation ===
On March 1, 2018, the [[New York City Commission on Human Rights]] started a "commission-initiated" investigation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2018/03/the-wing-discrimination-investigation-human-rights-commission.html|title=Women-Only Social Club Is Under Investigation by the NYC Human Rights Commission|last=Arnold|first=Amanda|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; into how The Wing membership system operates. According to the application rules of the Wing, men cannot become members of The Wing or visit as guests. Nevertheless, the club says it will accept members who are "living as a woman" and will review applicants' social media to determine their identity. This requirement, however, may exclude people who are gender nonconforming or who do not identify on the gender binary, which became one of the reasons for the investigation to emerge, since New York prohibits discrimination on the basis of "[[gender identity]]" and "[[gender expression]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/04/women-only-social-club-the-wing-is-violating-human-rights-law.html|title=Why the Wing, a Women-Only Social Club, Is Getting Away With Violating Human Rights Laws|last=Stern|first=Mark Joseph|work=Slate Magazine|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representatives from The Wing planned a meeting to discuss the issues with NYCC, disputing the accuracy of the term "investigation."  Instead, the company described the inquiry as a collaborative process. "All that's happened is that The Wing and the Commission have agreed, mutually, to sit down and have a conversation," said Karen Dunn of [[Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner|Boies Schiller Flexner]] LLP, who is representing the company in the matter. "We are looking forward to working with The Wing to ensure that they are in compliance with the law," said Seth Hoy, a spokesperson for the NYCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jezebel.com/the-new-york-human-rights-commission-is-investigating-t-1823334726|title=The New York Human Rights Commission Is Investigating The Wing [Updated]|last=Trotter|first=J.K.|work=Jezebel|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation evoked various disputes in the academic and social environments. Melissa Murray, a professor of law at [[University of California, Berkeley|U.C. Berkeley]] who is currently teaching at [[New York University]], criticized the commission's interest in The Wing: "I think it's patently absurd for New York's human rights commission to be focusing on The Wing when we've had, over the last six months, numerous complaints about workplaces being absolutely hostile to women in terms of pervasive and endemic sexual harassment." Craig Gurian, the executive director of the Anti-Discrimination Center in New York, however, offered a defense of New York City's public accommodations law: "To the extent that there are workplaces or public accommodations that have inappropriate behavior, the solution is to fix those workplaces or public accommodations. Separate is not equal. We were supposed to learn that a very long time ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://clubandresortbusiness.com/2018/04/wing-human-rights-law-investigation/|title="The Wing" Under Human Rights Law Investigation - Club &amp; Resort Business|date=2018-04-04|work=Club &amp; Resort Business|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York City Commission on Human Rights [[Twitter|tweeted]] on March 27, 2018, responding to The Wing members' personal tweets defending their safe space: "In NYC, no one should be discriminated against or harassed because of their gender. @NYCCHR uses every resource at our disposal to hold violators accountable and get justice for victims. Last yr, we increased fines &amp; damages collected by more than $1 mil, collecting $2.7 million."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/nycchr/status/978695116830408704|title=NYC Human Rights on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Workflowy''' is a simple [[Web application|web-based]] [[outliner]] created by Mike Turitzin and Jesse Patel at a [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]] startup camp. The idea for Workflowy arose from Patel’s prior work experience in [[project management]] and his frustration with the lack of useful tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/08/workflowy_the_note_taking_app_that_changed_the_way_i_organize_my_life_.html | title=Everything Is a List | work=Slate | date=August 2, 2012 | accessdate=April 25, 2016 | author=Manjoo, Farhad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography ==

=== Education and professional work ===
Electro-technical school graduate, studied, but did not finish, law at the University of Warsaw.&lt;ref name="dziennik1"/&gt;

==  Lawsuits ==
In the 2000s Stonoga was accused in 89 lawsuits in 89 localities. 
In 2004 he was sentenced to 3.5 years imprisonment for financial irregularities. In 2005 his sentence was quashed but he spent additional 4 months in prison due to procedural errors. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Już się powygłupiałem, pokląłem. Tak wojuje Zbigniew Stonoga. SYLWETKA |url = http://wiadomosci.dziennik.pl/wydarzenia/artykuly/475076,zbigniew-stonoga-kontra-sokolowski-i-sld-wojny-zbigniewa-stonogi.html |language=pl| accessdate = 18 June 2015| date = 9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, he was named in 61 criminal cases related mostly to financial fraud and insulting public servants; he was sentenced to a year in prison for fraud on a private car sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.polityka.pl/tygodnikpolityka/kraj/1623573,1,stonoga-raczej-do-wiezienia-niz-do-sejmu.read | title = Stonoga raczej do więzienia niż do Sejmu | language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==
In 2015 he ran in Polish parliamentary elections in which his party, "Stonoga Party Poland", scored 0.4% (40 000 voters). After the results were announced, furious Stonoga uploaded a video to the internet in which he expressed his frustration with those who did not vote for him or for the [[Coalition for the Renewal of the Republic - Liberty and Hope]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qARYM_ACOk |title=Zbigniew Stonoga obraża Polaków: "WAS POLACZKI TYLKO DO AUSCHWITZ WYPROWADZIĆ" |publisher=YouTube |date=2015-08-31 |accessdate=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His language is vulgar and direct, attracting the attention of the young audience. In 2015 he caught a pedophile in Cracow, with help from the police. His recordings of private conversations between Polish politicians have led to a few resignations.
