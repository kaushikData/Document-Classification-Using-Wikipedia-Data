The '''1948 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race''', was the fourth annual running of the "blue water classic" [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]].

Hosted by the [[Cruising Yacht Club of Australia]] based in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], the 1948 edition began on [[Sydney Harbour]], at noon on [[Boxing Day]] (26 December 1948), before heading south for 630 nautical miles (1,170&amp;nbsp;km) through the [[Tasman Sea]], past [[Bass Strait]], into [[Storm Bay]] and up the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]], to cross the finish line in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]].

The 1948 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race comprised a reduced fleet of 18 competitors. Wind conditions favoured the fleet, who found excellent going on their trip south.

''Morna'', skippered by Claude Plowman won line honours in a time of 4 days, 5 hours and 1 minute - breaking the record they set the previous year, and going under 5 days for the first time. The victory also gave the vessel and skipper three wins in-a-row, a record that would not be beaten until ''[[Wild Oats XI]]'' won four-in-a-row from 2005 to 2008. ''Westward'', skippered by GD Gibson was awarded handicap honours for the second year running.

===Logo===
[[Image:buboy.png|thumb|right|Buboy Butanding, a [[whale shark]], is the official mascot of the Games.]]
The logo of the 2005 ASEAN Para Games is an image of an athlete reaching for the stars. The logo was inspired by previous [[Paralympic Games]] logos and the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] logo. The four colours represent the four primary colours of the [[Philippine flag]]. The three stars symbolise the three main geographical regions of the Philippines as well as the three objectives of the games. The upward position of the arm symbolises the aspiration for equality and regional unity.

===Mascot===
The mascot of the 2005 ASEAN Para Games is a [[whale shark]] named ''Buboy Butanding''. The whale shark is said to be the largest fish in the world, which can be seen in the waters off the eastern coast of the province of [[Sorsogon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aseanparasports.org/ APSF Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Atlético Huila''' is a professional Colombian [[association football|football]] team based in [[Neiva]], that currently plays in the [[Categoría Primera A]]. The club was founded on November 29, 1990, making it one of the youngest professional football clubs in Colombia. The club's best seasons came in the late 2000s; they finished runners-up in [[2007 Categoría Primera A season|2007]] and again in [[2009 Categoría Primera A season|2009]]. They play their home games at the [[Estadio Guillermo Plazas Alcid|Guillermo Plazas Alcid]] stadium, which has a capacity of 27,000. Huila has a long-standing rivalry with [[Deportes Tolima]], known as  the ''Tolima Grande'' derby. The club has a futsal team named [[Ultrahuilca Coomotor]].


==History==
The club was founded in November 1990 and was admitted into the Primera B tournament the following year. In 1992, [[Alberto Rujana]] was appointed as manager. That same season, the club purchased midfielder Guillermo Berrío from America de Cali; Rujana named him captain and made him the centerpiece of the squad. Immediate promotion followed. The club managed to last in the top flight until the end of the 1996–97 season, when they finished last in the relegation table and were sent back to Primera B.

Rafael Corrales took over the club in 1996–97, and led them to an immediate promotion back to the top flight. They stayed there for a decade, although relegation was a constant danger.  The club escaped only on goal differential in 2002 and had to win a relegation playoff in 2006. This was why the club's performance in 2007 was almost entirely unexpected.

Under the management of Nelson Otero, the club finished third in the Apertura and qualified for the semifinal phase. They further surprised by winning their playoff group (beating Millonarios on the final day of the round robin) to reach the Apertura finals. [[Atlético Nacional]] beat them 2–1 over two hard-fought legs, but it was nonetheless something to be proud of. A similarly unexpected result came in the second half of the 2009 season, when the club finished third in the Finalización and topped their semifinal group. Once again they bowed over two legs, this time to [[Independiente Medellín]] by a 3–2 aggregate score. That strong performance in the 2009 season allowed Atlético Huila to qualify for the following year's [[2010 Copa Sudamericana|Copa Sudamericana]] for the first time in history, in which they beat Venezuelan team [[Trujillanos FC|Trujillanos]] in the first stage, but were knocked out by [[Club San José|San José]] from Bolivia in the second stage.

'''Barrack Field''' is located on the grounds of the [[Royal Artillery Barracks]] in [[Woolwich]], southeast [[London]] (formerly part of [[Kent]]). It was once part of [[Woolwich Common]], then used as a venue for first-class cricket matches in the 18th century and as the home of [[Woolwich Cricket Club]] at that time; later it became the home of the Royal Artillery Cricket Club. It is now used as a generic sports field, mainly for [[football]].

== History ==
Woolwich CC came briefly to prominence in August 1754 when the team played home and [[Dartford Brent|away]] games against [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]], which at this time was probably the strongest team in England.  In both matches, the away team won but no further details are known.  Both games were mentioned in the same report by ''Read's Weekly Journal'' dated Sat 31 August: "Dartford won away &amp; lost at home against Woolwich on Sat. &amp; Mon., Aug. 24 &amp; 26 respectively".&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Woolwich club's ability to successfully challenge Dartford at this time clearly infers that it was a leading club in the 1750s but its new found prominence was short-lived, probably because of the outbreak of the [[Seven Years' War]] which severely limited first-class cricket through its span.

The club revived in the last ten years of the 18th century when, following the establishment of [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] in 1787, club cricket was very fashionable in London and matches between the town clubs were very popular.  Barrack Field was frequently used for matches in this period.

== Cricket venue ==
The ''CricketArchive'' database records 96 matches, mostly services fixtures, as having taken place at Barrack Field&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/2453_misc.html ''CricketArchive'' – matches played at Barrack Field].  Retrieved on 18 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; but this record is incomplete because it excludes 8 matches played between 1797 and 1802, all of which are listed below:&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, pp.214–303.&lt;/ref&gt;

* 23–24 August 1797 – Woolwich v [[Croydon Cricket Club|Croydon]].  Woolwich won by 23 runs.
* 27 September 1797 – Woolwich v Croydon.  Woolwich won by 179 runs. 
* 16–17 August 1798 – Woolwich v Croydon.  Woolwich won by 88 runs.
* 8–9 October 1798 – Woolwich v [[Montpelier Cricket Club|Montpelier]].  Match drawn. 
* 26 May 1800 – Woolwich v Four Parishes.  Match drawn. 
* 30 June 1800 – [[Lord Frederick Beauclerk]]'s XI v [[Henry Marten (MCC cricketer)|Sir H W Marten]]'s XI.  Beauclerk's XI won by 60 runs.
* 16 May 1802 – Woolwich v MCC.  Result unknown.   
* 19 July 1802 – Woolwich v Montpelier.  Result unknown. 

The list is by no means exhaustive as ongoing research may find references to other matches at the ground.

It is possible that Woolwich CC was merged into the Royal Artillery Cricket Club (RACC) or alternatively that it disbanded after the RACC took full possession of Barrack Field.  According to its own website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gunnercricket.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=30&amp;Itemid=43 Royal Artillery Cricket Club site].  Retrieved on 18 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; RACC first played cricket in 1765, having been started as a private club by Royal Artillery officers.  It was formally constituted as a regimental club as late as 1906.  On 15 June 1818, RACC played MCC at Barrack Field in a match that was tied.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/263/263761.html ''CricketArchive'' – match scorecard].

|The white [[rook (chess)|rooks]] form a battery to capture the pawn protecting the black [[King (chess)|king]]. It is particularly effective to form a battery using rooks: the rooks may be combined to occupy the same rank or file, whereas bishops cannot occupy the same diagonal. 
}}
A '''battery''' in [[chess]] is a formation that consists of two or more pieces on the same rank, file, or diagonal. It is a [[Chess tactic|tactic]] involved in planning a series of captures to remove the protection of the opponent's king, or to simply gain in the [[Exchange (chess)|exchanges]].

Other chess authors limit battery to "an arrangement of two pieces ''in line with the enemy king'' on a rank, file, or diagonal so that if the middle piece moves a discovered check will be delivered."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 |isbn=0-19-866164-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[Chessgames.com]] [[blogs]] and game annotations of other chess websites, the term is also used in cases where moving the middle piece will uncover a threat other than a check along the opened line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chessgames.com/ | title=ChessGames.com | accessdate=2007-12-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071109084928/http://www.chessgames.com/| archivedate= 9 November 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion and examples==
It is particularly effective to form a battery using [[rook (chess)|rooks]] because they may be combined to occupy the same rank or file. In theory, [[bishop (chess)|bishops]] may also form a battery in a case of [[underpromotion]] of a pawn to a bishop occupying the same diagonal as the other bishop. In actual games, however, the [[queen (chess)|queen]] and rooks are often employed.

Batteries are often used as part of a [[Combination (chess)|combination]] which may involve other types of [[chess tactics]] as well. In some chess openings, the queen is often involved in the set up, and becomes part of a battery but is reserved for the final capture in the series of exchange of pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

|It is often more effective to involve the queen in forming a battery with the rooks as shown. The battery is attacking the pawn protecting the black king. In this situation, Black has to defend the pawn to be captured, possibly with his bishop, or either of his knights, or by playing e6.

[[File:Cricketer bowled.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A batsman is bowled]]
'''Bowled''' is a method of [[Dismissal (cricket)|dismissing]] a [[batsman]] in the [[sport]] of [[cricket]]. This method of dismissal is covered by Law 32 of the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-32-bowled/ |title=Law 32 – Bowled |publisher=MCC |accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A batter is out bowled if his or her [[wicket]] is [[Wicket#Dismissing a batsman|put down]] by a ball delivered by the bowler. It is irrelevant whether the [[ball]] has touched the bat, glove, or any part of the batsman before going on to put down the wicket, though it may not touch another player or an umpire before doing so. Such rules mean that bowled is the most obvious of dismissals: almost never requiring an [[appeal (cricket)|appeal]] to the umpire; a bowled batsman will usually acknowledge the dismissal voluntarily.

If the delivered ball deflects off the bat, and bowls the batter, then the informal term is known as ''played on'', ''knocked on'' or ''dragged on''. If the wicket is put down without the batter making any sort of contact with the ball, then it is known as ''clean bowled'' with variations being 'bowled through the gate', where the ball travels between the bat and pad, or 'bowled around the legs', where the ball goes behind (to the legside of) the batsman and hits the stumps.

A batter cannot be out bowled from a [[no-ball]], [[wide (cricket)|wide]] or [[dead ball (cricket)|dead ball]], though he/she can be stumped if it is a wide.

A batter is out bowled even if he/she could be given out by another method of dismissal instead. For instance, if a batsman edges the ball onto the stumps (such that the bails are removed) and the ball is caught by a fielder, then batter would be given out bowled instead of caught.

Bowled is the second most common method of dismissal after [[caught]]. The bowler is credited with the wicket if batter is out bowled.

Born and raised in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], she rose to fame in late 2002 upon winning a place in [[Girls Aloud]], a [[girl group]] created through [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Popstars: The Rivals]]''. While still in the group, she began a solo career in April 2009, and between then and 2014, she released four studio albums – ''[[3 Words]]'' (2009), ''[[Messy Little Raindrops]]'' (2010), ''[[A Million Lights]]'' (2012) and ''[[Only Human (Cheryl album)|Only Human]]'' (2014). Collectively, the albums included ten [[Cheryl discography#As lead artist|singles]], five of which – "[[Fight for This Love]], "[[Promise This]]", "[[Call My Name (Cheryl Cole song)|Call My Name]]", "[[Crazy Stupid Love (song)|Crazy Stupid Love]]" and "[[I Don't Care (Cheryl Cole song)|I Don't Care]]" – reached the [[Lists of UK Singles Chart number ones|top position]] on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Cheryl was the first British female solo artist to have five number-one singles in the UK, and she held the record for the British female solo artist with the most UK number-one singles until [[Jess Glynne]] overtook her in 2018.

Cheryl became a judge on the [[The X Factor (UK TV series)|UK version]] of ''[[The X Factor]]'' in 2008. She mentored two of the eventual winners of the competition ([[Alexandra Burke]] in [[The X Factor (UK series 5)|series five]] and [[Joe McElderry]] in [[The X Factor (UK series 6)|series six]]), before resigning in 2011 and joining the panel of the [[The X Factor (U.S.)|American version]], which she left during the auditions stage. She returned to judge series [[The X Factor (UK series 11)|11]] and [[The X Factor (UK series 12)|12]] of the UK version.

Cheryl has become a recognised and photographed style [[icon]], being referred to as a "fashionista" by the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/07/cheryl-cole-interview-vogue|title=Fashion Statement: Cheryl causes controversy|last=Holmes|first=Rachel|date=8 January 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=10 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171126191359/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/07/cheryl-cole-interview-vogue|archivedate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been photographed for the covers of ''[[Vogue (British magazine)|British Vogue]]'', ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' and ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', and fronted cosmetic company [[L'Oréal]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/fashionnews/6096652/Cheryl-Cole-lands-LOreal-deal---because-shes-worth-it.html|title=Cheryl Cole lands L'Oréal deal – because she's worth it|last=Irvine|first=Chris|date=27 August 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=10 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831072912/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/fashionnews/6096652/Cheryl-Cole-lands-LOreal-deal---because-shes-worth-it.html|archive-date=31 August 2009|dead-url=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her net worth was estimated at [[Pound sterling|£]]20&amp;nbsp;million in October 2014.&lt;ref name="Wealth12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/business-opinion/cheryl-fernandez-versini-assets-reportedly-10750418|title=What will divorce do to the £20m assets of Cheryl Fernandez-Versini?|last=Leyshon|first=Charlotte|date=18 January 2016|website=walesonline|accessdate=12 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701063858/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/business-opinion/cheryl-fernandez-versini-assets-reportedly-10750418|archivedate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wealth22"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spearswms.com/cheryl-cole-net-worth/|title=Cheryl Cole net worth|date=13 March 2016|website=Spear's Magazine|accessdate=12 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202211005/http://www.spearswms.com/cheryl-cole-net-worth/|archivedate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheryl was married to [[England national football team|England]] [[Association football|footballer]] [[Ashley Cole]] from July 2006 to September 2010.

Cheryl auditioned for the reality television show ''[[Popstars: The Rivals]]'' in 2002, which aimed to create a [[boy band]] and a [[girl group]] to compete for the [[Lists of UK number one singles|Christmas number one]] spot on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

Two of their albums reached the top of the [[UK Albums Chart]]: their [[greatest hits album]] ''[[The Sound of Girls Aloud]]'' and 2008's ''[[Out of Control (Girls Aloud album)|Out of Control]]'', both of which entered the chart at number one, with over one million copies of the former being sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=1036788&amp;c=1|title=Take That shine among IFPI Platinum elite|work=Music Week|publisher=United Business Media|date=29 January 2009|accessdate=30 January 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66SXRfIAH?url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=1036788&amp;c=1|archivedate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst performing "Fight for this Love" in 2009 on ''The X Factor'', media speculated that the performance was mimed, something that she denied though she admitted to having some pre-recorded vocals to help the live performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/cheryl-cole/news/160107-cheryl-gives-incredible-x-factor-performance|title=Cheryl gives 'incredible' X Factor performance|work=MTV UK|date=19 October 2009|accessdate=25 October 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022153936/http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/cheryl-cole/news/160107-cheryl-gives-incredible-x-factor-performance|archivedate=22 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, during her second performance on ''The X Factor'', in which she performed "Promise This", she "showcased her vocal and dancing skills with an energetic, raunchy routine that earned a standing ovation from her fellow judges."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/tv/204658-cheryl-cole-lives-up-to-promise-as-she-shines-on-x-factor|title=Cheryl Cole lives up to Promise as she shines on X Factor|publisher=stv.tv|date=24 October 2010|accessdate=25 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027192513/http://entertainment.stv.tv/tv/204658-cheryl-cole-lives-up-to-promise-as-she-shines-on-x-factor/|archivedate=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to her 2009 performance of "Fight for This Love" on ''The X Factor'', the media speculated whether she lip-synced or not. An ITV spokesperson insisted that she did not mime, although the performance was pre-recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/x-factor/x-factor-bosses-insist-cheryl-cole-didnt-mime-promise-this/|title=X Factor bosses insist Cheryl Cole DIDN'T mime 'Promise This'|publisher=Unreality TV|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907222605/http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/x-factor/x-factor-bosses-insist-cheryl-cole-didnt-mime-promise-this/|archivedate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, Cheryl performed "Call My Name" with live vocals on ''[[The Voice UK]]''. It was reported that ''The Voice'' executives always edit the vocals for every artist on the show, and they would "provide some finishing touches to her singing prior to it being broadcast." As the performance began, she swan-dived onto her backing dancers before they performed a highly elaborated routine. Following the broadcast, she received mixed comments from viewers, with a few accusing the singer of lip-synching, while others, including pop artists [[Emma Bunton]] and will.i.am, praised the performance. In an interview with [[BBC News]], she addressed the negative comments, and said that "if you think my live vocal sounds so good it must be mimed, I'm happy, I take it as a compliment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18265975|title=Cheryl: 'I'm happy if people think I'm miming'|date=7 June 2012|accessdate=11 June 2012|publisher=BBC News|author=Savage, Mark|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610200740/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18265975|archivedate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''EDHEC Sailing Cup''' (« '''ESC''' ») ('''Course Croisière EDHEC''' or « '''CCE''' » in French) is the leading student sporting event in [[Europe]] and the world’s biggest intercollegiate offshore [[regatta]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/2014/08/13/biggest-intercollegiate-offshore-regatta-world/&lt;/ref&gt;. It takes place every year in a French harbor of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. First held in 1969, it gathers nowadays 3,200 participants coming from 23 countries and from more than 165 universities. In 2017, the association received the award of best student organization of France by the ANEO challenge. 

Today the ESC is composed of three different trophies that include diverse sports: The Sea Trophy (a [[regatta]]), the Land Trophy (a [[Multi-sport event|multi-sport]] raid) and the Sand Trophy (a [[beach soccer]], [[beach rugby]] and [[Beach volleyball|beach volley]] competition)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.federvela.it/files/EDHEC%20Sailing%20Cup%20presentation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== History ==
Three French students from the prestigious [[EDHEC Business School (Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales du Nord)|EDHEC Business School]] willing to broaden the sport of sailing, Jean-Luc Picot, Francis Prat and Pierre Jouannet, decided in 1968 to organize a student regatta. It took place from May 1 to May 4, 1969 in [[Dunkirk]]. For its first edition, the thencalled EDHEC Business School Cup, gathered 18 crews and was won by a Dutch team. Older than the [[Vendée Globe]], the [[Volvo Ocean Race]] and other sailing event, the EDHEC Sailing Cup constitutes a precursor in the high-level competitions. 

Seven years after its creation the regatta reached 100 crews from 10 nationalities and took its actual name, the "EDHEC Sailing Cup". 329 boats attended the 18th edition, a record. For the 19th edition the Organizing Team decided to build a Village to welcome participants, partners and activities in one place. The same year the "Chaîne Avitaillement", an open-air free supermarket, was also created. For its 23rd edition, 20 international boats participated in the regatta including the first African boat, from [[Tunisia]], and boats from the [[United States]] and from [[Brazil]]. In 1994 was created the Land Trophy. It was first created as a replacement of the Sea Trophy. Since it was a great success, it became a full trophy. In 1998 an Israeli-Palestinian team participated in the regatta – it was the ancestor of the "'''Peace Boat'''."&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001129/112944e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 6,000 participants attend to the EDHEC Sailing Cup in [[Brest, France|Brest]]. In 1999, the EDHEC Sailing Cup became the leading student sporting event in Europe. 

To give a more sporting dimension to the event, the Sand Trophy was created in 2007. For the first time in 2010 was organized the Orange Port of Call, a coastal race that gathers the participants, at night, in an area away from the Village under a marquee build up for the occasion. In 2013, the EDHEC Sailing Cup and the Intercollegiate Offshore Regatta, organized by Storm Trysail Foundation and [[Larchmont Yacht Club]], created a partnership. It enables the winners of each regatta to have their costs of participation for the other one covered. 

Among the renowned sailors who have participated at least one time in the event we can find [[Éric Tabarly|Eric Tabarly]], [[Alain Colas]], [[Franck Cammas]], [[Olivier de Kersauson]], [[Vincent Riou]], [[Jean Le Cam]], Marc Thiercelin, [[Yves Parlier]], [[Marc Pajot]], Yann Eliès, Yvan Bourgnon, [[Jean-Luc Van Den Heede]], or also Jimmy Pahun.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sailingworld.com/racing/exchange-program&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Sea Trophy ==
[[Image:37edhec GS 1.jpg|thumb|Grand Surprise boats at race during the 37th Edition in [[Les Sables d'Olonne]].]]
The Sea Trophy, created in 1969, is the historic heart of the EDHEC Sailing Cup and remains the biggest trophy of the EDHEC Sailing Cup. Each year, the competition gathers more than 230 boats. The [[French Sailing Federation|French Federation of Sailing]] (FFVoile) and its National Race Committee supervise the race.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/2014/04/29/first-starting- signals-edhec-sailing-cup-rough-conditions/&lt;/ref&gt; It is open to all monohull boats with a Length Over All between 8 and 16 meters (approximately 25 to 50 feet) with a rating of 14 to 33.5 net handicap as well as Longtze boats. The three common boats used are Grand Surprise (around 40 boats), [[J/80]] (around 40 boats) and [[Longtze]] (around 10 boats). The competition is divided in several rankings: An '''Overall Ranking''', a '''100% Student''' and the '''100% International''', and each competition is rewarded by different prizes. The results of the EDHEC Sailing Cup are used in order to choose which French team will be selected for the Student Yachting World Cup.

== The other Trophies ==

=== The Land Trophy ===
The Land Trophy was created in 1994. More than 150 teams of four or five are competing in several sports such as [[mountain bike]], [[running]], [[orienteering]], [[canoeing]], [[zip-line]] or [[abseiling]]. In 2017, an obstacle course was organized between participants of the Land Trophy and of The Sand Trophy: The Mud Contest.

=== The Sand Trophy ===
Created in 2007, this trophy is divided in more than 80 teams of 5 to 9 individuals. There are competitions of [[beach soccer]], [[beach rugby]] and [[beach volleyball]] during the day and concerts in the evening. The competitors spend all of their time on the Village with their teammates and other teams. They can rent a stand of 16m2 to represent their school and their sponsors and organize activities in it such as fast-food contest or a [[Pétanque|petanque]] tournament. 

In 2017, the Sand Trophy evolved for its 10th edition. The day is divided into two parts. One part is for classical sporting challenges and the other for more various challenges with, for example, an [[The Escape Game|escape game]], an archer arena and a nautic trophy.

=== The Air Trophy ===
The latest Trophy, which last took place in 2016, was a competition of [[KiteSurfing|kitesurfing]] and [[windsurfing]]. Initiated in [[Lorient]] in 2011 and officially launched in 2012 during the 44th edition, the trophy was the first kitesurfing competition in teams ever organized in France. The windsurfing competition was divided into two different elements: A race and a freestyle contest. The kitesurfing was divided into a race, a freestyle and a boarder cross contest.

== The Organizing Team ==
The EDHEC Sailing Cup is an event organized by students for students. Indeed, the entire event is organized by students, from the logistic to the communication of the event and its 3 trophies. Divided into four divisions, - Logistic, Sports, External Relations and Communication - with a head office, the [[Student Association|association]] works likes a real [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|SME]], with presidents that devote their whole gap year to this mission.

The '''Ebor Handicap''' is a [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Handicap (horse racing)|handicap]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run at [[York Racecourse|York]] over a distance of 1 mile 5 furlongs and 188 yards (2,787 metres). It is scheduled to take place each year in August.

==History==
The event is named after the shortened form of [[Eboracum]], the Roman name for York. It was first run in 1843, and it was originally known as the Great Ebor Handicap. The race was introduced by John Orton, a newly appointed Clerk of the Course at York. It was initially contested over 2 miles, but its distance was later cut by 2 furlongs.

The planned running of the Ebor Handicap in 2008 was abandoned because of a waterlogged track. It was replaced by an event at [[Newbury Racecourse|Newbury]] called the Newburgh Handicap, a reference to the town's original Norman name.

The race is now held on the final day of York's four-day [[Ebor Festival]] meeting. It is currently the most valuable flat handicap in Europe.

'''Estadio Municipal de Riazor''' ({{IPA-es|esˈtaðjo muniθiˈpal de rjaˈθoɾ}}), also known as '''Abanca-Riazor''' for sponsorship reasons, is an [[all-seater stadium]] in [[A Coruña]], [[Spain]]. The stadium is the home ground of [[Deportivo de La Coruña]], and accommodates a total of 32,660 spectators.

==History==
Although the stadium has hosted home games for Deportivo since its establishment in 1906, it wasn't until 1944 that essential facilities such as stands and changing rooms were installed {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}. That year, the stadium was officially adopted as Deportivo's ground. The opening game was against [[Valencia CF]] on 28 October 1944, which saw Depor lose 3-2 {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}.

The stadium was renovated in time to host three games during the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] finals. Also, this asset made Riazor favorable for a [[Copa del Rey]] final between [[Real Madrid]] and [[RCD Espanyol]] in 1947, which saw the capital's side claim their ninth cup title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canaldeportivo.com/deportienda/deporsport/pagina/2009/09/23/32 Aquellos tiempos maravillosos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210190555/http://www.canaldeportivo.com/deportienda/deporsport/pagina/2009/09/23/32 |date=10 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June 2017, the stadium was renamed as Abanca-Riazor after the sign of a sponsorship agreement between [[Abanca]] and Deportivo de La Coruña until 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcdeportivo.es/noticia/abanca-y-el-depor-llegan-a-un-acuerdo-de-refinanciacion-de-la-deuda-y-patrocinio-del-estadio|publisher=Deportivo de La Coruña|language=es|date=29 June 2017|accessdate=29 June 2017|title=ABANCA y el Dépor llegan a un acuerdo de refinanciación de la deuda y patrocinio del estadio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11798">In [[baseball]], a '''ground ball pitcher''' (also '''ground-ball pitcher''' or '''groundball pitcher''') is a type of [[pitcher]] that has a tendency to induce [[ground ball]]s from opposing [[batter (baseball)|batters]].&lt;ref name=SC&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia
| publisher = Sporting Charts
| title = Ground Ball Pitcher
| accessdate = 2014-01-17

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average ground ball pitcher has a ground ball rate of at least 50% with extreme ground ball pitchers maintaining a ground ball rate of around 55%. Pitchers with a ground ball rate lower than 50% may be classified as [[flyball pitcher]]s or as pitchers who exhibit the tendencies of both ground ball and fly ball pitchers.&lt;ref name=Neyer&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ground ball pitchers rely on pitches that are low in the [[strike zone]] with substantial downward movement,&lt;ref name=SC /&gt; such as [[split-finger fastball|splitters]] and [[sinker (baseball)|sinker balls]].&lt;ref name=Lepen&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baseball analysts and [[Sabermetrics|sabermetricians]] [[Tom Tango]], [[Mitchel Lichtman]], and [[Andrew Dolphin]] agree that ground ball pitchers are generally better pitchers than those with fly ball tendencies.&lt;ref name="Tango 2006"&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = TMA Press
| last = Tango
| first = Tom
|author2=Mitchel Lichtman |author3=Andrew Dolphin
 | title = The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, baseball writer and analyst [[Bill James]] argues the opposite because of injury patterns among ground ball pitchers.&lt;ref name=NeyJa&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Batted ball tendencies==
Against a ground ball pitcher, batters tend to [[ground out (baseball)|ground out]] rather than [[fly out]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| last = Brach
| first = Eric
| title = Best Ground-Ball Pitchers in Baseball Today
| work = Bleacher Report

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ground ball pitcher’s ability to keep balls in the infield in turn keeps balls from resulting in home runs which, according to Hardball Times writer David Gassko, is the strongest benefit of a ground ball pitcher. When a ground ball pitcher does allow a pitch to be bat into the air, it is likely to result in a [[line drive]].&lt;ref name=Gassko&gt;{{Cite web
| last = Gassko
| first = David
| title = The Truth About the Grounder
| work = The Hardball Times
| date = 2006-05-12
| url = http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/the-truth-about-the-grounder/
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to fly ball pitchers, ground ball pitchers generally allow fewer [[extra base hits]] yet more total hits. Likewise, ground ball pitchers tend to give up fewer [[home runs]] than fly ball pitchers.&lt;ref name=FG&gt;{{Cite web
| title = GB%, LD%, FB%
| accessdate = 2014-01-21
| url = http://www.fangraphs.com/library/pitching/batted-ball/
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ground ball pitchers tend to perform better against ground ball hitters than they perform against fly ball hitters.&lt;ref name="Tango 2006"/&gt;

===Relationship with defense===
Compared to fly ball pitchers, ground ball pitchers are more likely to allow [[unearned run]]s. David Gassko notes that 2.23% of ground balls result in an [[error (baseball)|error]], and these errors account for 85% of all errors. Accordingly, as Gassko argues, the susceptibility of ground balls to errors results in more unearned runs.&lt;ref name=Gassko /&gt;

With runners on base, ground ball pitchers often force [[double plays]] because the weak contact batters make with a ground ball pitcher’s pitches prevents the ball from passing the infield defense.&lt;ref name=SC /&gt;

===Ground ball rate===
Ground ball rate, or ground ball percentage, is the percentage of [[batted ball]]s that are hit as ground balls against a pitcher.&lt;ref name=FG /&gt; A typical ground ball pitcher has a ground ball rate over 50% while an extreme ground ball pitcher maintains a ground ball rate of 55% or higher.&lt;ref name=Neyer /&gt; Pitchers with high ground ball rates sustain lower [[BABIP]], or Batting Average against Balls in Play (Hardball), on ground balls than those with low ground ball rates.&lt;ref name=FG /&gt;

==Nature of pitches==
Ground ball pitchers rely on pitches that are likely to induce weak contact from the batter, thus resulting in a ground ball.&lt;ref name=SC /&gt; Pitches that are low in the strike zone with high negative horizontal or vertical movement and high velocity, such as splitters, sinkers, [[curveball]]s, and [[two-seam fastball]]s, result in the highest percentage of ground balls. According to data from the 2012 major league season, splitters and sinker balls result in the highest percentages of ground balls compared to other pitches, with 50.3% and 49.8%, respectively.&lt;ref name=Lepen /&gt;

===Sinker ball===
{{Main|Sinker (baseball)}}

The sinker ball has an ability to “dive” at the plate, often resulting in ground balls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video

In June 2002, Lowe allowed eleven fly balls to 129 batters, relying on his sinker to induce ground balls.&lt;ref name=Ver /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
According to a scouting report by Lewis Shaw, Brandon Webb’s sinker possesses heavy downward movement and high velocity, and one of his notable tendencies is to induce ground balls from right-handed hitters.&lt;ref name=Shaw /&gt;

==Ground ball pitching performances==

===1996 World Series===
{{Main|1996 World Series}}

In a [[World Series]] game on October 21, 1996, against the [[New York Yankees]], then-[[Atlanta Braves]] pitcher Greg Maddux pitched one fly ball and eighteen ground balls, earning nineteen of twenty-four outs on ground balls with [[Wade Boggs]] grounding into a double play. Yankees’ catcher [[Joe Girardi]] said of Maddux’s performance, “[H]e has a great sinker and he gets a lot of ground balls.” Braves center fielder [[Marquis Grissom]] noted, “He [Maddux] works fast. His games are not boring, by no means. That’s his style of pitching. He’s a ground ball pitcher.”

Baseball writer [[Murray Chass]] noted the similarities between this World Series game and a World Series game Maddux pitched against the [[Cleveland Indians]] a year prior, which resulted in a loss by the Indians, who scored two unearned runs. In this game, Maddux earned nineteen ground outs and pitched two fly balls.&lt;ref name=Chass /&gt;

===2007 ALCS===
{{Main|2007 American League Championship Series}}

In game three of the [[American League Championship Series]] between the Cleveland Indians and [[Boston Red Sox]] in 2007, Indians pitcher Jake Westbrook used his sinker ball to induce fifteen ground ball outs and also forced two 6-4-3 double plays.&lt;ref name=Ant /&gt;

'''Guts''' or '''disc guts''' (sometimes '''guts Frisbee''' in reference to the [[trademark]]ed [[brand name]]) is a [[Flying disc games|disc game]] inspired by [[dodgeball]], involving teams throwing a [[flying disc]] (rather than balls) at members of the opposing team.

== Game play ==
One to five team members stand in a line facing the opposing team across the court, with the two teams lined up [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to each other.  Which team begins play is determined by "flipping the disc", an action similar to a [[coin toss]], but using the disc itself. One member of the team is then selected to start play. That member then raises an arm to indicate readiness to throw, at which point the members of the opposing team freeze in position. The thrower then throws the disc as hard as possible at someone on the opposing team. If the thrower misses the "scoring area" (a demarcated area a bit larger than the space occupied by the opposing team), the receiving team scores a point. If a member of the receiving team catches the disc cleanly, neither team scores a point. If the throw is within the scoring area and the receiving team fails to catch, or catches but drops the disc, the throwing team gets a point. The receiving team then picks up the disc and becomes the throwing team.

The receiving team must catch the disc cleanly in one hand, and may not move from position until after the disc leaves the hand of the thrower. The disc may not be trapped between the hand and any other part of the body, including the other hand. This frequently results in a challenging sequence of "tips" or "bobbles", which are rebounds of the disc off of receivers' hands or body to slow the disc down and keep it in play until it can be caught. This often involves multiple players on the receiving team.

Play continues until at least 21 points have been scored by one of the teams and there is a difference in score of at least 2 points.

==History==
The first International Frisbee Tournament was held in [[Eagle Harbor, Michigan]], in 1958. The sport grew from a pastime of the Healy family picnic and, in the 1960s, its national profile was increased by Jim Boggio Sr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Veale|first=Brandon|title=Boggio boosted Guts frisbee in 1960s|url=http://www.mininggazette.com/page/content.detail/id/526020/Boggio-boosted-Guts-frisbee-in-1960s.html|accessdate=August 1, 2012|newspaper=The Daily Mining Gazette|date=July 6, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000530/http://www.mininggazette.com/page/content.detail/id/526020/Boggio-boosted-Guts-frisbee-in-1960s.html|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As guts evolved during the 1960s, players started throwing faster and faster, until it wasn’t unusual to see presumably unbreakable discs traveling at 60&amp;ndash;70&amp;nbsp;mph shatter on impact with an unlucky defender’s hand. Catching a speeding disc directly was said to really "take guts", thus the name of the game.  One tournament player even required fifteen stitches to close a gaping wound across the palm of his hand.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

By the early 1970s, the game had spread across the United States and to other countries, with coverage on radio, television, major newspapers,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} and magazines such as [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']].&lt;ref name="Time197207"&gt;* {{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877893,00.html|title=Flipped Disks|date=July 17, 1972|publisher=''[[TIME]]'' magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With over 60 teams at a tournament in the heyday of the game, matches became intensely competitive affairs, seeking the IFT’s Julius T. Nachazel Trophy. With radical curving shots, deflected Frisbees bobbled frantically among teammates, and spectacular diving catches, guts had become an [[extreme sport]] demanding fast reflexes, physical endurance, and concentration.

Since its rise in the 1970s, when even [[ABC Television|ABC]]’s ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'' was televising guts action, and numerous tournaments were springing up, from [[Toronto]] to [[Chicago]] and [[Los Angeles]], the sport has gradually declined in popularity in America. Guts had been introduced in Asia by the toy company [[Wham-O]] in the 1970s, and by the 1990s it had become even more popular in Japan and Taiwan than in the US.  Recent years, however, have seen pockets of strong new American players renewing competitive American interest in the game, also drawing some older players out of “retirement”.[Citation needed]

==Organization==
[[File:Guts Frisbee German Nationalteam 2016.jpg|thumb|Team photo of the German Guts National Team at the 2016 World Championship 2016 London, England]]
The sport's international [[sports governing body|governing body]], as with other major flying disc games, is the [[World Flying Disc Federation]] (WFDF). For North America, the more game-specific [[United States Guts Players Association]] (USGPA) officiates.

The fiftieth annual [[International Frisbee Tournament]] (IFT), held in [[Hancock, Michigan]], June 30 &amp;ndash; July 1, 2007, was a large guts disc tournament, drawing players from all over the United States and Canada, and for the first time, two strong teams from Japan &amp;ndash; including “Katon”, the WFDF World Champions.

As of 2007,{{Fact|date=September 2007}}{{Update after|2012|12|2}} the USGPA plans to induct some of the most outstanding players into the Guts Hall of Fame, joining Fred Morrison (inventor of the original [[Pluto Platter]] flying disc), the Healy brothers{{Clarify|date=September 2007}}&lt;!--Who the heck is that? At least be more specific, with complete names! There are probably 5,000 pairs-or-more of "Healy brothers" in the world.--&gt; (inventors of guts and founders of the IFT), and “Steady Ed” Headrick (IFT champion and inventor of the standard “pole hole” basket used on modern [[disc golf]] courses).

==Variations==

===Dodge disc===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
'''Dodge disc''' (or '''dodge Frisbee'''). In this variant, scoring is achieved not by throwing into a scoring zone, but by hitting opponents, without their successfully catching the disc. Opponents are permitted to move.  As in dodgeball, if a player is hit by a disc and fails to catch it, then the player is "out" and exits the field of play. If a player catches the thrown disc without its touching the ground, either before or after being hit by it, or before or after it hits another player, then the player who threw the disc is out instead. The game ends when there is only one player left. The game usually ends with a "shootout" between two players, each with several discs. The final players tend to execute several simultaneous "attacks" until one is hit without catching a disc thrown by the opponent. A variant of the game, Dodgebee, is a trademark of Hero Discs.  The Dodgebee disc is very soft, and thus can be thrown very fast without injuring any of the players.

===Flutterguts===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
Flutterguts is a noncompetitive variant of guts.  The two teams face each other a few metres apart.  The main rule change is that the disc must be thrown such that it does not rotate about its central axis (i.e. it can flip, but it cannot spin).  This restriction makes fast throws impossible, but catching is still challenging.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1133">'''Indoor cross country''' is a relatively new test of equestrian skills. It involves the use of both [[show jumping]]-type obstacles and [[cross-country equestrianism|cross country]]-type obstacles (including [[bank (obstacle)|banks]], [[water (obstacle)|water]], logs, and [[brush fence]]s) in a course of an indoor arena.

Indoor cross-country has mainly been performed in Europe. However, Britain offered its first competition at the British Open Show Jumping Championships in April, 2006. Such was the success of this event, which included riders such as [[Zara Phillips]] and Jeanette Brakewell, that the event is now one of the main attractions at the British Open. In Autumn 2006 the Royal Fair in Toronto launched their own version after consultation with the British Open organisers.

Rails down add penalties to the rider's score, as does going over time.

'''Leicester Racecourse''' is a [[horse racing]] course in [[Oadby]], [[Leicestershire]], [[England]].&lt;ref name=BRR-159 &gt;''[[British Racing and Racecourses]]'' ({{ISBN|978-0950139722}}) by [[Marion Rose Halpenny]] - Page 159&lt;/ref&gt;

The course is oval shaped and nearly 2 miles in extent.&lt;ref name= "BRR-159"/&gt; It was opened in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Leicester:A Pictorial History|last = Elliott|first = Malcolm|publisher = Phillimore|year = 1999 |isbn = 1 86077 099 1|location = Chichester|pages = 120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1883 Leicester Races, which had been run since 1773, were held at what is now Victoria Park, closer to the town centre.

The course hosts both forms of [[Horseracing in Great Britain|British horse racing]] event: [[National Hunt racing|National Hunt]], in which the horses race over fences or over hurdles, and [[Flat racing]], in which the horses run an unobstructed distance.&lt;ref name= "BRR-159"/&gt;

Prior to the 2009/10 National Hunt season, the open ditch, which was jumped as the fourth last fence, was moved to the home straight. The home straight now consists of four fences, with the open ditch now taken as the third last fence.

Leicester racecourse was the scene of the infamous [[Flockton Grey]] [[List of sports idioms#R|ringer]] case.

The racecourse had its heyday in the late nineteenth century when it staged some of the most valuable races in the United Kingdom including the Prince of Wales Stakes and the Portland Stakes, both of which carried more prize money than any of the five [[British Classic Races]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP18900329.2.46&amp;srpos=2&amp;e=01-02-1890-31-03-1890--10--1----0Donovan+Portland--|title=SPORTING|author="Vigilant"|date=29 March 1890|publisher=Evening Post|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Malta]]''' has competed in 15 [[Summer Olympic Games]] and 1 [[Winter Olympic Games]].

As of the London 2012 Olympic Games no Maltese competitor has won an Olympic medal. However shooter [[William Chetcuti]] (who has won World Championship events) missed the [[Double Trap]] Shooting final in 2004, 2008 and 2012 by a relatively slim margin. In 2004 and 2008 Chetcuti was tied for 6th (the required placing to enter the final), but lost at a tie breaker. 
[[Elise Pellegrin]] is the first Winter Olympian to represent the country, in [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|date=30 January 2013|title=Young skier to compete for Malta in next Alpine Ski World Cup|url=http://m.maltatoday.com.mt/newsdetails/sports/Young-skier-to-compete-for-Malta-in-next-Alpine-Ski-World-Cup-20130130|newspaper=[[Malta Today]]|location=|publisher=|accessdate=11 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111220026/http://m.maltatoday.com.mt/newsdetails/sports/Young-skier-to-compete-for-Malta-in-next-Alpine-Ski-World-Cup-20130130|archivedate=11 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maltese Olympic Committee was formed in 1928 and recognized by the IOC in 1936.

==History and profile==
''Mundo Deportivo'' was first published on 1 February 1906,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hemeroteca.elmundodeportivo.es/edition.html?bd=01&amp;bm=02&amp;by=1906&amp;x=19&amp;y=12 Copy of the first edition of "Mundo Deportivo", 1 February 1906]&lt;/ref&gt; as a weekly newspaper, and since 1929 daily. It is the oldest sports newspaper still published in Spain, and the second one in Europe, after the Italian ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' which was founded in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;International Association of Sports Newspapers (IASN), [http://www.press-iasn.org/members/members.html Association Members]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is published in Barcelona and is owned by ''Grupo Godó''.&lt;ref name=dav&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Enric Castelló|author2=David Domingo|title=Spanish media facing new media: a challenge to journalists?|journal=International Journal of Iberian Studies|date=2005|volume=18|issue=3|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=c38d19e1-7bac-4754-8a34-a4d204a334c8%40sessionmgr4002&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4210|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group also owns ''[[La Vanguardia]]''.&lt;ref name=dav/&gt;

The '''Netanya Tigers''' ({{lang-he|'''נתניה טייגרס'''}}) was an [[Israel]]i [[baseball]] team from [[Netanya]] in the [[Israel Baseball League]]. 

The Tigers finished the inaugural 2007 season in fourth place, 19-21 (.475), and were defeated by the [[Bet Shemesh Blue Sox]] in the semifinals of the 2007 championship, 6-3.

==History==
[[Image:Netanya Tigers shirt logo.jpg|thumb|left]]

The team's Manager was Israeli Ami Baran, who was originally from Chicago. 

The first player selected by the Tigers in the inaugural 2007 draft was outfielder Dan Rootenberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelbaseballleague.com/news/pressreleases/index.html?article_id=24 |title=First Player Draft in IBL History Yields Bumper Crop |accessdate=2007-04-29 |format=HTML |publisher=IsraelBaseballLeague.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is a former [[Midwood High School]] and [[Binghamton University]] [[left-handed]] hitting [[outfielder]], who hit .407 for Binghamton during his senior year, garnering All-SUNYAC and All-State honors, played in the [[Frontier League]], the Swiss professional league, and for the Pleasantville Red Sox, and in 2006 batted .351 in the Westchester Rockland Wood Bat League.  The first pitcher drafted by the Tigers was right-handed 6'5" pitcher [[Leon Feingold]], who pitched for the [[State University of New York at Albany]] 1990-1994, the [[Cleveland Indians]] system from 1994-1995, the independent Atlantic League in 1999, and also played for the Pleasantville Red Sox.  Both Rootenberg and Feingold were among the group of four players first signed by the League.

==Stadium==
Located at the [[Sportek Baseball Field]] in [[Tel Aviv]], due to a lack of appropriate facilities in [[Netanya]].

==Update==
For the first week of the season the Tigers did not have a home field, due to stadium construction delays in [[Tel Aviv]].  However, Sportek Stadium opened in mid-July 2007 at the intersection of [[Ibn Gvirol]] and Rokach Streets in Tel Aviv, and was home to both the Netanya Tigers and the [[Tel Aviv Lightning]].

'''Pedestrianism''' was a 19th-century form of competitive walking, often [[professional sport|professional]] and funded by [[wagering]], from which the modern sport of [[racewalking]] developed.

==18th- and early 19th-century Britain==
[[File:Foster Powell, a pedestrian. Etching. Wellcome V0007267ER.jpg|thumb|right|Foster Powell]]
During the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, pedestrianism, like [[running]] or horse racing ([[Horseracing in Great Britain|equestrianism]]) was a popular spectator sport in the [[British Isles]]. Pedestrianism became a fixture at fairs &amp;ndash; much like horse racing &amp;ndash; developing from wagers on footraces, [[rambling]], and 17th-century [[footman]] wagering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1663/07/30/ Pepys Diary], 30 July 1663, accessed 24 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Sources from the late 17th and early 18th century in England describe aristocrats pitting their carriage [[footmen]], constrained to walk by the speed of their masters' carriages, against one another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofhullac.co.uk/our-club/history/pedestrianism Club History: Pedestrianism]. ''City of Hull Athletic Club'' Refers to [[Samuel Pepys]] writing of Footman races in 17th century London.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first notable exponent of this long distance walking is generally considered to be [[Foster Powell]] (1734&amp;ndash;93) who in 1773 walked {{convert|400|mi|km}} from London to York and back, and in 1788 walked {{convert|100|mi|km}} in 21 hours 35 minutes.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], accessed 3 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mee&gt;Arthur Mee (1941) ''The King's England: Yorkshire West Riding'' (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, London) pp190&amp;ndash;1&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 18th century, and especially with the growth of the popular press, feats of foot travel over great distances (similar to a modern [[Ultramarathon]]) gained attention, and were labelled "pedestrianism".

==Distance feats and wagering==
One of the most famous pedestrians of the day was Captain [[Robert Barclay Allardice]], called "The Celebrated Pedestrian", of [[Stonehaven]].&lt;ref&gt;"Pedestrianism" by Matthew Algeo, Chicago Review Press, Chicago, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; His most impressive feat was to walk {{convert|1|mi|km}} every hour for 1000 hours, which he achieved between June 1 and July 12 1809. The feat captured the public's imagination and around 10,000 people came to watch over the course of the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gillonj.tripod.com/thecelebratedpedestrian/ JK Gillon. Robert Barclay Allardice: The Celebrated Pedestrian], (n.d.)&lt;br /&gt;Peter Radford. The Celebrated Captain Barclay: Sport, Gambling and Adventure in Regency Times. Headline Review, New Ed, (2002) {{ISBN|978-0-7472-6490-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, attempts to repeat the athletic challenge were made by many pedestrians, including [[George Wilson (racewalker)|George Wilson]] who attempted to walk {{convert|1000|mi|km}} in 480 hours in 1815 but was arrested after 3/4 of the distance for disturbing the peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/pedestrianism-george-wilson-walking|title=Professional Walking Was Once So Cool, It Could Get You Arrested|date=2017-06-29|work=Atlas Obscura|access-date=2018-01-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emma Sharp]] was thought to be the first woman to complete the challenge of {{convert|1000|mi|km}} in 1000 hours on the 29th October 1864.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2016/05/time-emma-sharp-walked-1000-miles-1864-just-prove-woman/&lt;/ref&gt; Later racewalkers proved to be more successful, especially [[Ada Anderson]], who after walking {{convert|1500|mi|km}} in 1000 hours was labelled by the press 'Champion Lady Walker of the World',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Champion Lady Walker of the World.|work=Leeds Times|date=4 May 1878|ref=Champion Lady Walker of the World.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a feat only equaled by one other, her trainer [[William Gale racewalker|William Gale]].&lt;ref name="Harry"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/898876817|title=The pedestriennes : America's forgotten superstars|last=Harry.|first=Hall,|date=2014|publisher=Dog Ear Pub|isbn=9781457534294|location=Indianapolis, IN|oclc=898876817}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another popular goal was for competitors in long distance events to walk {{convert|100|mi|km}} in less than 24 hours, from which they earned the nickname "[[Centurion (racewalking)|centurions]]".  Enormous cash prizes were offered for the races and they were a popular activity for the press, crowds of working class spectators, and the betting public until the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1876/02/27/archives/sporting-events-pedestrianism-extraordinary-a-remarkable-test-of.html Sporting Events.; Pedestrianism Extraordinary. A Remarkable Test of Endurance&amp;mdash;One Thousand Miles Walked in One Thousand Hours&amp;mdash;De Witt and Goulding Both Accomplish the Feat&amp;mdash;The Contestants Still Walking. Forty-Second Day.] New York Times, February 27, 1876, Wednesday, Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth and controversy==
Interest in the sport, and the wagering that accompanied it, spread to the United States, Canada, and Australia in the 19th century. By the end of the 19th century, pedestrianism was largely displaced by the rise in modern [[spectator sport]]s and by controversy involving rules, which limited its appeal as a source of wagering and led to its inclusion in the amateur athletics movement and eventually the creation of racewalking.

==Heel-to-toe rule==
Pedestrianism was first codified in the last half of the 19th century, evolving into what became [[racewalking]], while diverging from the long distance cross country [[fell running]], other [[track and field athletics]], and recreational [[hiking]] or [[hillwalking]].&lt;ref&gt;See Walsh (1867). pp.&amp;nbsp;508&amp;ndash;10 "I. Description of Pedestrianism: Quick Walking." in which "pedestrianism" is used for both "quick walking" by the "toe-and-heel" rule and "running".  He references the scepticism about records and code enforcement.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the mid-19th century, competitors were often expected to extend their legs straight at least once in their stride and obey what was called the "fair heel and toe" rule.  This rule, the source of modern racewalking, was a vague commandment that the toe of one foot could not leave the ground before the heel of the next foot touched down, however rules were customary and changed with competition.  Racers were usually allowed to jog in order to fend off cramps, and it was distance, not code, which determined gait for longer races. Newspaper reports suggest that "trotting" was common in events.&lt;ref&gt;Phil Howell (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heyday==
[[File:General view of the fair grounds showing the walking match in Raleigh North Carolina 1879.jpg|thumb|350px|[[African American]] walking match at the [[North Carolina State Fair|North Carolina State Fairgrounds]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], 1879]]
The longer form of "ultra marathon" walking featured in the popular press and in the decade after the [[American Civil War]] in the United States was a source of fascination. [[Edward Payson Weston]], a reporter for the [[New York Herald]] won a $10,000 prize by walking {{convert|1136|mi|km}} from Portland, Maine, to Chicago in 30 days in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1874/05/13/archives/pedestrianism.html Pedestrianism] The New York Times, 13 May 1874.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States a series of women's competitions were staged, special indoor tracks were built in some towns, and intra-community long distance pedestrianism came into vogue.  Along with sensational feats of distance, gambling was a central attraction for the large, mostly [[working-class]] crowds which came to pedestrian events.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Collins. [http://www.lehigh.edu/dmd1/public/www-data/kelly.html Old Time Walk and Run: Ultramarathon Running], Lehigh University, 11 December 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a time the a sport columns in the New York Times bundled prize races for horses, running and walking events: [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9406EEDA1F3FE03BBC4A52DFB066838B679FDE The Turf.; Trotting&amp;mdash;Racing and Pedestrianism] (this example June 12, 1860)&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United Kingdom, member of Parliament [[Sir John Dugdale Astley, 3rd Baronet|Sir John Astley]] founded a "Long Distance Championship of the World" in 1878, staged over six days, which became known as the "Astley Belt Races".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1878/04/01/archives/pedestrianism-in-london-the-great-international-match-an-early.html Pedestrianism in London].; The Great International Match. An Early Visit to Agricultural Hall&amp;mdash;Hospitality of Mrs. C'leary&amp;mdash;Sir John Astley's Speech to The Contestants&amp;mdash;Description of Some of the Pedestrians&amp;mdash;An Impudent Fellow Ruled Off the Course&amp;mdash;Lookingfor An Early Breakfast&amp;mdash;Progress of the Match.
The [[New York Times]], Page 1, April 1, 1878, Wednesday&lt;/ref&gt;  While marking a peak in press coverage of such races, the Astley Belt Races allowed a wide interpretation of rules, with trotting, jogging, and even some running allowed.  The competition was partly inspired by a desire to clean up the perception of the sport as corrupted by gambling interests and led to a push amongst some to codify pedestrianism as an amateur sport.  The same process was happening to British track and field athletics and gave rise to the modern [[Olympic Movement]].

==Amateur sport and racewalking==
Walkers organised the first English amateur walking championship in 1866, which was won by John Chambers, and judged by the "fair heel and toe" rule.  This vague code was the basis for the rules codified at the first championships meeting in 1880 of the [[Amateur Athletics Association]] in England, the birth of modern track and field.  With [[Football (soccer)|football]], [[cricket]] and other sports codified in the 19th century, the transition from professional pedestrianism to amateur codified racewalking was part of a process of regularisation occurring in most modern sports at this time.

The codified racewalk was included when the [[International Olympic Committee]] formed in 1893. In the [[1904 Olympic Games]] the "all-rounder" event, father of the [[decathlon]], included an {{convert|880|yd|m|adj=mid}} walk. It was only in the unofficial "Interim Olympic Games" of 1906 that racewalking became a separate event and since the [[1908 Olympic Games]] in London, it has been an official event in every summer games.

==Foot racing==
Foot racing was a form of competitive running and walking of the 17th and early 18th centuries.  Usually it involved feats of endurance which would now be classified as ultramarathon.  It evolved into pedestrianism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grubstreet.rictornorton.co.uk/ Early Eighteenth-Century Newspaper Reports, A Sourcebook compiled by Rictor Norton]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perth Racecourse''' is a [[thoroughbred horse racing]] venue adjacent to the ancient [[Scone Palace]], near [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], Scotland.&lt;ref name=BRR-197 &gt;''[[British Racing and Racecourses]]'' ({{ISBN|978-0950139722}}) by [[Marion Rose Halpenny]] – Page 197&lt;/ref&gt;

Perth Racecourse at the site in Scone Palace Parklands opened in 1908 and is the northernmost track in [[Great Britain|Britain]].&lt;ref name= "BRR-197"/&gt; However, horse racing in Perth has taken place since 1613 and was moved to Scone Palace due to a drinking law ban in the North Inch park. Lord Mansfield subsequently offered his land for the construction of a racecourse. 

The course is right-handed and ten [[furlong]]s in circumference. The [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase course]] consists of eight fences per circuit, with the water jump situated in front of the grandstand. The hurdle course is located on the inside going away from the stands, but switches to the outside of the chase course turning into the home straight.

'''Sandboarding''' is a [[boardsport]] and [[extreme sport]]{{cn|date=November 2018}} similar to [[snowboarding]] that involves riding across or down a [[sand dune]] while standing on a board, either with both feet strapped in or while standing loose, without bindings. Sandboarding can also be practised sitting down or lying on the belly or the back. It typically involves a [[sandboard]], although it is also possible to use [[Sledding|sleds]], [[Surfboard|surfboards]], a [[skateboard]] deck, or [[Snowboard|snowboards]].

Sandboarding has adherents throughout the world, but is most prevalent in desert areas or coastal areas with beach dunes. It is less popular than snowboarding, partly because it is very difficult to build a mechanised [[ski lift]] on a sand dune, meaning participants must walk or ride a [[dune buggy]] or [[all-terrain vehicle]] back to the top of the dune. On the other hand, dunes are normally available year-round as opposed to [[ski resorts]], which are seasonal.

==Equipment==
The sandboard base is much harder than a snowboard, and is built mostly out of [[formica (plastic)|formica]] or laminex with special base materials now being made for this sport. To glide in the sand, the board bottom is often waxed, usually with a [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]]-based sandboard wax, before a run. Afterwards, the bottom of the board may have a lightly sanded look to it, while 'Race Base' tends to polish smoother and glossier with use. Most terrain sandboards are composed of hardwood ply, while 'full-size' sandboards are a wood, fiber glass, and plastic composite. However, a snowboarding base will sometimes work on steeper dunes.

==Worldwide==
===Sandboarding in Israel===
Drorbamidbar has sandboarding in Israel at [[Negev Desert]] not far from [[Ashalim]] in the [[Ramat Negev]].

===Sandboarding in Australia===
[[Little Sahara (Kangaroo Island)|Little Sahara]] on [[Kangaroo Island]] in [[South Australia]] is a sand dune system roughly covering two square kilometres. The highest dune is approximately 70 metres above sea level.

Lucky Bay, about 30&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Kalbarri]], in Western Australia, is another sandboarding hotspot. Sandboarding Tours are offered in the area.

The Stockton dunes, 2.3 hours north from Sydney. Stockton Bight Sand Dunes system is up to one kilometre wide, 32 kilometres long, and covers an area of over 4,200 hectares. The massive sand dunes climb up to 40 metres high. Located only minutes from the centre of Nelson Bay, it is the largest sand dune system in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portstephens.org.au/TheSandDunes.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216080726/http://www.portstephens.org.au/TheSandDunes.aspx |archivedate=16 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sandboarding in Africa===
Sandboarding sites in [[Egypt]] include the Great Sand Sea near Siwa Oasis واحة سيوة in Egypt's Western Desert, the Qattaniya القطانية sand dunes (1.5 hr drive on/off-road from Cairo), El Safra الصفراء and Hadudah هدودة dunes midway between Dahab and St. Catherine in Sinai. 

[[Namibia]] features [[sand-skiing]], which is similar to sandboarding, performed with skis instead of a board. Most of the sand-skiing is performed in the [[Namib]] desert dunes around [[Swakopmund]] and [[Walvis Bay]]. With a special permit it is sometimes possible to sand-ski at the world's highest dunes in [[Sossusvlei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.xtremespots.com/board-sports/sandboarding/swakopmund-erongo-district-namibia/|title = Xtreme Spots|date = |accessdate = 26 August 2015|website = Xtreme Spots|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Henrik May, a German living in Namibia for some 10 years, set a Guinness World Record in speed sand-skiing on 6 June 2010. He reached a speed of 92.12&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ski-namibia.com/?id=1001 The World Record]", Ski Namibia, Retrieved 5 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

After some pioneers like Derek Bredenkamp who boarded Swakopmund around 1974, commercial operators in [[South Africa]] began offering sandboarding to tourists in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.downhilladventures.com/activities/full-half-day-adventures/sandboarding/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 the Sandboarding South Africa league was established. 
Between 2002 and 2004 the South African Sandboarding League held competitions on the Matterhorn Dune located between Swakopmund and Walvis bay. Competition events included dual slalom, boarder cross and big air events. In 2005 and 2006 Alter Action held sandboarding competitions at Matterhorn but the competitions no longer formed part of the South African Sandboarding League during those years. The league collapsed, then the sport was revived again in 2007 with weekly sandboarding sessions in and around Cape Town and Gauteng. 

===Sandboarding in the U.S.===
Sand Master Park, located in [[Florence, Oregon]] USA is a sandboard park with {{convert|40|acre|m2}} of private sculpted sand dunes and a full-time pro shop. Dune Riders International is the governing body for competitive sandboarding worldwide and sanctions three events each season at Sand Master Park.

[[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve]] near [[Alamosa, Colorado]] has sandboarding on what it calls the tallest dunes in North America. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nps.gov/grsa/index.htm. US National Park Service. Retrieved 05 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Sandboarding and skiing are permitted anywhere on the dunefield away from vegetated areas. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nps.gov/grsa/planyourvisit/sandboardingsandsledding.htm. US National Park Service. Retrieved 05 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Sandboarding in South America===
[[Peru]] is known for having large sand dunes in [[Ica Province|Ica]], some reaching up to 2&amp;nbsp;km. Duna Grande in Ica is the largest sand dune in the world. The ''Copa Sandboarding Perú'' (Peru – Sandboarding Cup) has been held near Paracas every year since 2009.&lt;ref name="copa"&gt;[http://www.livinginperu.com/news/13616 Peru's top sandboarders compete tomorrow in Paracas], Living Peru. Sports. 26-11-2010. Retrieved 11-26-2010&lt;/ref&gt; There are also great dunes near the capital city (Lima) in Chilca.

In [[Chile]], sandboarding is practiced throughout the north of the country, including the Medanoso dunes in Copiapo (where the Dakar rally takes place), Puerto Viejo beach in Caldera, excellent dunes in Iquique, and some near Viña del Mar.

===Sandboarding in Central America===
[[Nicaragua]] is home to [[Cerro Negro]], the youngest volcano in Central America. Since it has steep slopes and volcanic sand, it is possible to sandboard down this active volcano.

===Sandboarding in Europe===
[[File:Sanboardinggreece.jpg|thumb|Sandboarding in Greece]]
A rather small sand mountain is the [[Monte Kaolino]] in [[Hirschau]], [[Germany]]. Being equipped with a lift to the 120m top it is also the host of the annual Sandboarding World Championships. 

Amothines is a small desert five kilometres from Katalakkos village in [[Limnos]], [[Greece]]. There are many sand dunes there, where people can practice sandboarding.

In the [[North East England|North East region]] of the [[United Kingdom]], there is a small beach at [[Seaton Sluice]] where people can sandboard. This is a good alternative to [[sledding]], as there is insufficient [[snow]] to support sledding there, even though the UK has a cold climate, with cold winters and cool summers.

'''Wide Right II''' is a colloquial name for the [[1992 NCAA Division I-A football season|1992 college football]] game between the [[1992 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami Hurricanes]] and [[1992 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State Seminoles]].  The game is notable in the [[Florida State–Miami football rivalry]] and derives its name from the colloquial name [[Wide Right I]], played during the immediately preceding season.  Like its predecessor, the game had decisive [[NCAA Division I-A National Football Championship|national championship]] implications and ended with a Florida State kicker missing a game-altering [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] in the waning seconds.&lt;ref name="Bradley2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Michael|title=Big games: college football's greatest rivalries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Spp0uaLJ7t8C&amp;pg=PA61|accessdate=24 January 2012|year=2006|publisher=Potomac Books|isbn=978-1-57488-908-6|pages=61–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[1992 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami]] entered the October 3, 1992, matchup of intrastate rivals as the [[1991 Miami Hurricanes football team|defending national champion]] and second-ranked team in the country, riding a 20-game winning streak.  Miami, however, appeared to be vulnerable, as [[Hurricane Andrew]] had disrupted the early portion of its schedule and Miami was unimpressive in surviving an 8-7 scare against the [[1992 Arizona Wildcats football team|Arizona Wildcats]] the week prior.  Because of Miami's lackluster performance against Arizona, the Hurricanes lost their number one ranking in the [[AP Poll#College football|AP Poll]] and were dropped to number two, behind the [[1992 Washington Huskies football team|Washington Huskies]].  Nevertheless, Miami featured a bevy of stars on its roster, including [[Heisman Trophy]] candidate quarterback [[Gino Torretta]], wide receiver [[Lamar Thomas]], and linebackers [[Jessie Armstead]] and [[Micheal Barrow]], and the team was in the midst of an [[NCAA]]-record 58-game home winning streak at the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]]. [[1992 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]] was looking to avenge its loss to Miami in [[Wide Right I]] the season before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Long|first=Gary|title=Stadium stories: Florida State Seminoles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jCeFe4x-7KsC&amp;pg=PA114|accessdate=24 January 2012|year=2006|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=978-0-7627-4093-2|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The game==
Florida State came strong out of the gate, as [[Tamarick Vanover]] took the opening kickoff back 94 yards for a [[touchdown]].  Miami struck back in the second quarter with a 24-yard Dane Prewitt field goal and a 29-yard touchdown pass from [[Gino Torretta]] to [[Coleman Bell]], taking the lead, 10-7.  Florida State countered with a 22-yard field goal by Dan Mowrey, and the teams headed to the locker room deadlocked at 10.

Mowrey added a 38-yard field goal in the third quarter and a 41-yarder early in the fourth.  Leading 16-10 with just over 9 minutes to play, the Seminoles found themselves in a position eerily similar to the season before: a 6-point lead late in the game and a field goal kicker who was 3-for-3 on the day.

Miami responded as it did the season before, going on a 7-play, 58-yard drive that culminated with a 33-yard touchdown pass from Torretta to [[Lamar Thomas]].  Torretta was drilled as he released the ball, but Thomas was able to sneak behind [[Clifton Abraham]] and make a basket catch.  With the extra point, Miami seized the lead, 17-16.

Miami's defense held on the next possession, and the Florida State defense forced a punt on Miami's subsequent series.  The ensuing punt proved disastrous for the Seminoles: punt returner [[Corey Sawyer]] was penalized for attempting an illegal forward pass from his own end zone, resulting in a [[safety (American football score)|safety]] for Miami.  With Miami now leading 19-16, a field goal could only tie the game for the Seminoles.  The Miami defense again held, but Florida State then forced the 'Canes to punt, giving the Seminoles one last chance with 1:35 left.

Quarterback [[Charlie Ward]] drove the Seminoles 59 yards and into field goal range, converting a crucial fourth-and-12 with a completion to [[Kez McCorvey]] along the way.  The drive was highlighted by Matt Frier's diving, fingertip reception for 17 yards.  After Ward picked up 19 yards on two quick scrambles, the Seminoles were on the Miami 22-yard line but nearly out of time.  On the game's final play, Florida State called upon Mowrey to make a 39-yard field goal and tie the game at 19. With both Miami's and Florida State's [[NCAA Division I-A National Football Championship|national championship]] hopes again hanging in the balance, Mowrey, kicking into the open end of the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]], missed wide right and collapsed face down onto the turf.

==Aftermath==
Miami once again used a hard-fought win over its rival as a springboard for a national championship run, winning its final seven regular season games and earning a berth in the [[1993 Sugar Bowl]] as the nation's number one team in both the [[AP Poll#College football|AP]] and [[Coaches' Poll#College football|Coaches']] Polls. This time, however, the Hurricanes could not complete the perfect season, losing to the second-ranked and eventual national champion [[1992 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama Crimson Tide]] in the Sugar Bowl 34-13, and finishing 11-1 and ranked third in the country.

Unlike the previous season, when the Seminoles followed up their loss to Miami with an upset loss to [[1991 Florida Gators football team|Florida]], Florida State rebounded and won the rest of its games, going 11-1 on the season.  The Seminoles soundly defeated the [[1992 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska Cornhuskers]] in the [[1993 Orange Bowl]], 27-14, and, despite the loss to Miami, were ranked second in the final polls, one spot ahead of the Hurricanes.

The game was the second in a peculiar string of 5 games in 12 years in which Florida State lost to Miami due to a late missed field goal that would have won or tied the game for the Seminoles, often with national championship implications.

'''William Barber''' (1734–1805) was an English [[cricket]]er who played for the [[Hambledon Club]] in its great days during the 1760s and 1770s.  Originally from [[Walberton]], near [[Chichester]], he came to Hambledon to play after being "spotted".&lt;ref name=GDC&gt;[[Ashley Mote]], ''The Glory Days of Cricket'', Robson, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Barber finished playing in 1777.  He is said to have bowled a "high delivery on a good length" and was probably a medium quick bowler.&lt;ref name=JN&gt;[[Ashley Mote]], ''John Nyren's "The Cricketers of my Time"'', Robson, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

His family and that of [[Thomas Brett (cricketer)|Thomas Brett]] were inter-married.  Barber seems to have been a shoemaker but he latterly took over the ''[[Bat and Ball Inn]]'' (see also [[Broadhalfpenny Down]]) from [[Richard Nyren]].  He died aged 71 in 1805 and was buried in [[Catherington]].&lt;ref name=GDC/&gt;

'''Woolwich Cricket Club''' was an English [[cricket]] club based in the town of [[Woolwich]], [[Kent]]. It was formed sometime in the first half of the 18th century, or earlier, and its earliest known record is in 1754 when its team played two major matches against the prominent [[Dartford Cricket Club]]. The club, or at least a successor of it, then played a number of matches from 1797 to 1806 against [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC), [[Montpelier Cricket Club]], [[Croydon Cricket Club]] and other leading town clubs. After playing MCC in 1806, the club disappeared from the records. Throughout the period from 1754 to 1806, Woolwich's home ground was Barrack Field, part of [[Woolwich Common]], which remains the home ground of the Royal Artillery Cricket Club (RACC). Mainstays of the club in its "Napoleonic" period were [[William Ayling]], [[John Tanner (cricketer)|John Tanner]] and [[John Ward (Kent cricketer)|John Ward]].

==1754==
Woolwich came briefly to prominence in August 1754 when the team played home and [[Dartford Brent|away]] games against Dartford which at this time was probably the strongest team in England. In both matches, the away team won but no further details are known.  Both games were mentioned in the same report by ''Read's Weekly Journal'' dated Sat 31 August: "Dartford won away &amp; lost at home against Woolwich on Sat. &amp; Mon., Aug. 24 &amp; 26 respectively".&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Woolwich club's ability to successfully challenge Dartford at this time clearly infers that it was a leading club in the 1750s but its new found prominence was short-lived, probably because of the outbreak of the [[Seven Years' War]], during which cricket was impacted with few matches recorded.

==1797 to 1806==
In the years around the turn of the century, club cricket was very fashionable in London and matches between the town clubs were very popular. They generally held [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important match status]], depending on the quality of the teams. Woolwich reappeared in 1797 with two victories against Croydon, both at Barrack Field.  

In 1798, the club played home and away against both Croydon and Montpelier. Following two substantial victories against Croydon, Woolwich lost to Montpelier at [[Aram's New Ground]] and then drew the return at Barrack Field.

In 1800, Woolwich played home and away matches against MCC and won both, including an innings victory at [[Lord's Old Ground]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/0/280.html ''CricketArchive'' – match scorecard]. Retrieved on 4 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  In what was a very successful season, the team also defeated Montpelier by 8 wickets at Barrack Field.

The Napoleonic Wars were by now under way and, as in the Seven Years' War, cricket suffered a loss of investment and manpower that severely reduced the number of matches played. Woolwich played three more games against MCC at Lord's Old Ground,&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, pp.293, 303 and 323.&lt;/ref&gt; winning in 1802&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/260/260854.html ''CricketArchive'' – match scorecard].  Retrieved on 4 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1803&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/260/260860.html ''CricketArchive'' – match scorecard].

Retrieved on 4 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barrack Field==
The ''CricketArchive'' database records 96 matches, mostly services fixtures, as having taken place at [[Barrack Field]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/2453_misc.html ''CricketArchive'' – matches played at Barrack Field]. Retrieved on 4 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; but this record is incomplete because it excludes 8 matches played between 1797 and 1802, all of which are listed below:

* 23–24 August 1797 – Woolwich v Croydon. Woolwich won by 23 runs.
