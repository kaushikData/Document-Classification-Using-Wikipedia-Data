      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8222">The '''Annals of Essenbæk''' ([[Latin]] ''Annales Essenbecenses'') are [[annals]] with historical notices relating to the years 1020-1323, which seem written in the [[Benedictine]] [[Essenbæk Abbey]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Skov, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; 

== The text ==

=== Characterization ===
Much of the annals’ content is [[ecclesiastical]], which is why the person who wrote them was probably also ecclesiastical, but with great interest and sympathy for the [[peasants]]’ conditions. Especially in the latest part of the annals the peasants’ conditions are described as complicated by taxes, storms, diseases and raidings, &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Skov, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; and the person who wrote the annals clearly favored the Jutish peasants rather than the country’s [[king]] in the years 1313-1320.&lt;ref&gt;Skov, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Title ===
In 1773 [[Jakob Langebek|Langebek]] gave the annals the title ''Annales Essenbecenses'',&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Marstrand, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; with reference to Essenbæk Abbey and the nearby [[Randers]] being mentioned in them several times. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Knudsen [Retrieved 2017-03-05]&lt;/ref&gt; Also that in the annals there is mentioned several times the [[Kalø Castle|castle on Kalø]], but not once any of the other castles built by forced labor in 1314, indicates that the annals were written in [[Djursland]],&lt;ref&gt;Skov, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; where alone there was a [[monastery]] in [[Essenbæk Parish]].&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzen, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Especially persons and places in [[Jutland]] - not least [[bishops]] in [[Aarhus]] - are mentioned in the annals.&lt;ref&gt;Skov, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dating and sources ===
The Annals of Essenbæk were written no earlier than in 1323, which the last notice in them relates to,&lt;ref&gt;Skov, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; and no later than in 1367, when [[Archbishop]] [[Niels Jensen (Bild)|Nikles Jonsen (Bild)]] used them to write his Chronicle of the Archbishops of Lund.&lt;ref&gt;Marstrand, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; The Annals of Essenbæk seem to be based on the [[Ryd_Abbey#.22Annales_Ryenses.22|Annals of Ryd]] and the [[Annals of Lund]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; until about 1262, and the rest of them seem to be original.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Manuscripts and publications ==
After the [[Reformation_in_Denmark%E2%80%93Norway_and_Holstein|Reformation]] the annals probably went from the last [[Catholic]] archbishop [[Torben Bille|Torbern Bille]] to his brother [[Claus Bille|Klavs Bille]], because about 1590 [[Historiographer_Royal_(Denmark)|Historiographer Royal]] [[Anders Sørensen Vedel]] owned ”Alia quaedam chronologica of an old scroll, which Mr. Claus Bilde had, ab anno domini 1027 ad annum domini 1323” (''Alia quaedam chronologica aff en gamle rulle, som hr. Claus Bilde haffde, ab anno domini 1027 ad annum domini 1323''),&lt;ref&gt;Marstrand, pp. 255-257&lt;/ref&gt; and on another partial copy of the annals, &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Jørgensen, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; which probably around the same time&lt;ref&gt;Ilsøe, p. 434&lt;/ref&gt; was hand-written for [[Arild Huitfeldt|Huitfeldt]], there was noted:&lt;ref&gt;Marstrand, p. 257-258&lt;/ref&gt; ”This I have transcribed and noted off a scroll which belonged to Mr. Claus Bilde” (''Dette haffuer ieg udskreffuit oc noteret af en rulle som hørde her Claus Bilde thiill'').&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Marstrand, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; The annals have since disappeared.

=== Latin manuscripts ===
A manuscript, which is probably from around 1500, is the only nearly complete copy of the annals, and is now found in the manuscript collection ''Codex Bibliotheca Universitas Upsaliensis ex donatione de la Gardie L''.

The manuscript was owned by [[Stephanius|St. Johannis Stephanius]], when in the [[17th century]] he hand-wrote a poor copy of it. The Stephanian manuscript is now found in the manuscript collection ''Codex Bibliotheca Universitas Upsaliensis ex donatione de la Gardie XXV-XXIX'', which there are also copies of in [[Stockholm]] and [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The probably for Huitfeldt hand-written partial copy since came to [[Danzig]], from where [[Olof von Dalin|Dalin]] took it to [[Uppsala]] in the [[18th century]].&lt;ref&gt;Marstrand, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; It is now found in the manuscript collection ''Codex Bibliotheca Universitas Upsaliensis H 112''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

In 1664 Vedels partial copy was in the university library, and around 1690 [[Thomas Broder Bircherod]] hand-wrote a copy of it. Vedels partial copy burned &lt;ref&gt;Marstrand, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; together with the [[Copenhagen University Library|university library of Copenhagen]] in 1728.&lt;ref&gt;Ilsøe, p. 408&lt;/ref&gt; The Bircherodian manuscript from about 1690 does not exist now, but in the 18th century Bircherod and [[Peder Jensen Lucoppidan]] each hand-wrote a copy of it.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The latest Bircherodian manuscript is now found in the manuscript collection ''Codex Bibliotheca Regia Hafniensis signatus Ny kongelig Samling 402 in folia'', and the Lucoppidan manuscript is now found in the manuscript collection ''Codex Bibliotheca Regia Hafniensis signatus Ny kongelig Samling 561 in folia''.

Two hand-written copies of the Lucoppidan manucript are now found in the manuscript collection ''Codex Bibliotheca Regia Hafniensis signatus Ny kongelig Samling 570 in folia''. 

=== Publications ===
Based on the Lucoppidan manuscript&lt;ref&gt;Jørgensen, pp. 25-26&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Joachim von Westphalen]] in 1743 published the annals in the third volume of ''Monumenta ininedita rerum Germanicarum praecipue Cimbricarum et Megapolensium''.&lt;ref&gt;''Ernst Joachim v. Westphalen'' in ''Den Store Danske'' [Retrieved 2017-03-05]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Langebek owned the two hand-written copies of the Lucoppidan manuscript&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; when in 1773, based on them and a copy of the manuscript which is probably from around 1500,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; he published the annals in the second volume of ''Scriptores Rerum Danicarum''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Based on the manuscript which is probably from around 1500, the probably for Huitfeldt hand-written partial copy, the two hand-written copies of the Lucoppidan manuscript, and the copy of the Stephanian manuscript in Hamburg&lt;ref&gt;Jørgensen, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Waitz|Waitz]] in 1892 published the annals in the 29th volume of ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Based on the manuscript which is probably from around 1500, the probably for Huitfeldt hand-written partial copy, the latest Bircherodian manuscript and the Lucoppidan manuscript&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Ellen Jørgensen]] in 1920 published the annals in ''Annales Danici medii ævi''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1980 [[Erik Kromann|Erik Kroman]] published the annals in ''Danmarks middelalderlige annaler''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==History==
[[BP|British Petroleum]] took over sponsorship of the competition in 1989 from [[John Player &amp; Sons]], a tobacco company which had sponsored it from its inception in 1980, and has sponsored it since. The presence of both sponsors has triggered protests, with the group Art Not Oil (part of the international [[Rising Tide North America|Rising Tide]] network) being responsible for most of those against BP. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}} &lt;ref name="Aart Not Oil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnotoil.org.uk/blog/bp-portrait-award-demo-guests-and-judges-file-past-faces-gulf-spill-14611|title=BP PORTRAIT AWARD DEMO: GUESTS AND JUDGES FILE PAST FACES OF THE GULF SPILL, 14.6.11|website=Aart Not Oil|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, The Museums Association conducted a formal investigation into BP's sponsorship when Art Not Oil alleged that the company influenced curatorial decisions and used its association with the National Gallery to further its political interests both domestic and international.

The [[exhibition]] opens in June each year and runs until September. First prize is typically £30,000. In the early years of the century, the prize went up from £5,000, and its catchment area was gradually extended from residents of the UK and is now unrestricted.

In 1993, [[Tom Hallifax]] was used to advertise the awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fineart.ac.uk/artists.php?idartlist=24 | title=Fineart | accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Bamboo Annals''''' ({{zh|t=竹書紀年|p=Zhúshū Jìnián}}), also known as the '''''Ji Tomb Annals''''' ({{zh|t=汲冢紀年|p=Jí Zhǒng Jìnián}}), is a [[chronicle]] of ancient China.
It begins at the earliest legendary times (the [[Yellow Emperor]]) and extends to 299 BC, with the later centuries focusing on the history of the [[State of Wei]] in the [[Warring States period]].  It thus covers a similar period to [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (91 BC).  The original may have been lost during the Song dynasty,{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=2343}} and the text is known today in two versions, a "current text" (or "modern text") of disputed authenticity and an incomplete "ancient text".

== Textual history ==
The original text was interred with [[King Xiang of Wei]] (died 296 BC) and re-discovered nearly six centuries later in 281 AD ([[Western Jin dynasty]]) in the [[Jizhong discovery]]. For this reason, the chronicle survived the [[Burning of the books and burial of the scholars|burning of the books]] by Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]].  Other texts recovered from the same tomb included ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]'', ''[[I Ching]]'', and the ''[[Tale of King Mu]]''.  They were written on [[Bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo slips]], the usual writing material of the Warring States period, and it is from this that the name of the text derives.{{sfnp|Keightley|1978|p=423}}  The strips were arranged in order and transcribed by court scholars, who identified the work as the state chronicle of Wei.  According to [[Du Yu]], who saw the original strips, the text began with the [[Xia dynasty]], and used a series of different pre-Han calendars.  However, later indirect reports state that it began with the Yellow Emperor.  This version, consisting of 13 scrolls, was lost during the [[Song dynasty]].{{sfnp|Keightley|1978|p=423}}{{sfnp|Nivison|1993|pp=40–41}}
A 3-scroll version of the ''Annals'' is mentioned in the ''[[History of Song]]'' (1345), but its relationship to the other versions is not known.{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|2006|p=193}}

The "current text" (今本 ''jīnběn'') is a 2-scroll version of the text printed in the late 16th century.{{sfnp|Nivison|1993|pp=41, 44}}{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|2006|pp=193–194}}  The first scroll contains a sparse narrative of the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|pre-dynastic emperors]] (beginning with the Yellow Emperor), the Xia dynasty and the [[Shang dynasty]].  The narrative is interspersed with longer passages on portents, which are identical to passages in the late 5th century ''[[Book of Song]]''.  The second scroll contains a more detailed account of the history of the [[Western Zhou]], the [[Jin (Chinese state)|state of Jin]] and its successor state Wei, and has no portent passages.{{sfnp|Nivison|1993|p=40}}  This version gave years according to the [[sexagenary cycle]], a practice that began in the [[Han dynasty]].{{sfnp|Nivison|1993|pp=40–41}}  Discrepancies between the text and quotations of the earlier text in older books led scholars such as [[Qian Daxin]] and [[Shinzō Shinjō]] to dismiss the "current" version as a forgery,{{sfnp|Nivison|1993|pp=39, 42–43}} a view still widely held.{{sfnp|Keightley|1978|p=424}}{{sfnp|Barnard|1993|pp=50–69}}  Other scholars, notably [[David Shepherd Nivison|David Nivison]] and [[Edward L. Shaughnessy|Edward Shaughnessy]], argue that substantial parts of it are faithful copies of the original text.{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1986}}

The "ancient text" (古本 ''gǔběn'') is a partial version assembled through painstaking examination of quotations of the lost original in pre-Song works by Zhu Youzeng (late 19th century), [[Wang Guowei]] (1917) and Fan Xiangyong (1956).  Fang Shiming and Wang Xiuling (1981) have systematically collated all the available quotations, instead of following earlier scholars in trying to merge variant forms of a passage into a single text.{{sfnp|Keightley|1978|pp=423–424}}{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|2006|p=209}}
The two works that provide the most quotations, the ''[[Shui Jing Zhu]]'' (527) and [[Sima Zhen]]'s ''Shiji Suoyin'' (early 8th century), seem to be based on slightly different versions of the text.{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|2006|pp=210–222}}

[[File:CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 91st Edition.png|thumb|Cover of the 91st Edition]]

The '''''CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics''''' is a comprehensive one-volume reference resource for science research, currently in its 99th edition ({{ISBN|978-1-1385-6163-2}} with 1532 pages, 1000 black-and-white illustrations, June 18, 2018, Editor-in-Chief John R. Rumble). It is sometimes nicknamed the 'Rubber Bible' or the 'Rubber Book', as [[CRC Press|CRC]] originally stood for "Chemical Rubber Company".

As late as the 1962–1963 edition (3,604 pages) the ''Handbook'' contained myriad information for every branch of science and engineering.  Sections in that edition include: Mathematics, Properties and Physical Constants, Chemical Tables, Properties of Matter, Heat, Hygrometric and Barometric Tables, Sound, Quantities and Units, and Miscellaneous.  Earlier editions included sections such as "Antidotes of Poisons", "Rules for Naming Organic Compounds", "Surface Tension of Fused Salts", "Percent Composition of Anti-Freeze Solutions", "Spark-gap Voltages", "Greek Alphabet", "Musical Scales", "Pigments and Dyes", "Comparison of Tons and Pounds", "Twist Drill and Steel Wire Gauges" and "Properties of the Earth's Atmosphere at Elevations up to 160 Kilometers".  Later editions focus almost exclusively on Chemistry and Physics topics and eliminated much of the more "common" information.

This is a '''comparison of online backup services'''.

Online backup is a special kind of online storage service; however, various products that are designed for file storage may not have features or characteristics that others designed for backup have. Online Backup usually requires a backup client program. A browser-only online storage service is usually not considered a valid online backup service.

Online folder sync services can be used for backup purposes. However, some Online Folder Sync services may not provide a safe Online Backup. If a file is accidentally locally corrupted or deleted, it depends on the versioning features of a Folder Sync service, whether this file will still be retrievable.

===Legend===
*{{note|1|1}}'''[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]/[[Linux]]/[[Mac OS X|Mac]]/[[iOS]]/[[Android (operating system)|Android]]/[[BlackBerry]]''': Supported operating systems for thick client (native binary application), which provide background data transmission and setting services.
*{{note|2|2}}'''Zero knowledge''':  The service provider has no knowledge of the user's encryption key, ensuring privacy of the backup data.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/05/internet_security Internet security: Keys to the cloud castle | The Economist]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://evilrouters.net/2011/04/20/why-i-use-jungle-disk-and-tarsnap/ Why I Use Jungle Disk and Tarsnap — Evil Routers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/17/edward-snowden-dropbox-privacy-spideroak Snowden: Dropbox is hostile to privacy, unlike 'zero knowledge' Spideroak | Technology | theguardian.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{note|3|3}}'''Secure Key Management''': If yes, the user holds and controls the encryption key. If no, the service provider holds and controls the encryption key.
*{{note|4|4}} Payment options/plans:
**'''Limited MB plan''': Pay per computer. Additional fee for storage over a threshold.
**'''Unlimited MB plan''': Pay per computer. Storage per computer is unlimited.
**'''$/MB plan''': Pay per unit of storage, but unlimited computers may share that storage.
*{{note|5|5}}'''Cloud hosted Net Drive''': Cloud can serve storage over [[WebDAV]], [[Server Message Block|SMB]]/[[CIFS]], [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]], [[Apple Filing Protocol|AFP]] or other [[Network-attached storage|NAS]] protocol, allowing files to be streamed from the cloud. A change made to the cloud is immediately accessible to applications on all clients without needing to pre-download (sync) the file in full.
*{{note|7|7}}'''Sync''': [[File synchronization|Synchronization]] between computers, and/or mobile devices (PDA, MDA,...)
*{{note|8|8}}'''Public Internet file hosting'''
*{{note|9|9}}'''Restore via physical media'''
*{{note|10|10}}'''Server location''': Countries where physical servers are located.  Where the data will be located.
*{{note|11|11}} Still in [[Beta version#Beta|Beta version]]
*{{note|12|12}} Whether the desktop client (if available) can detect and upload changes without scanning all files.
*{{note|13|13}} Many backup services offer a limited free plan, often for personal use. Often it is possible to increase the free backup limit through coupons, referrals, or other means that are not included in this column. This column also does not include free trials that are only available for a limited period of time.
*{{note|14|14}} '''External hard drive support''': Can refer to an alternate backup destination or whether the service can back up external drives.
*{{note|15|15}} Hybrid Online Backup works by storing data to local disk so that the backup can be captured at high speed, and then either the backup software or a D2D2C (Disk to Disk to Cloud) appliance encrypts and transmits data to a service provider. Recent backups are retained locally, to speed data recovery operations.
*{{note|16|16}} '''Unlimited BW''': If bandwidth capping or limits are used on accounts.

He was born the son of John Braye of [[Eaton Bray]], [[Bedfordshire]] and the younger brother of [[Edmund Braye, 1st Baron Braye|Edmund Braye]]. He was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1509.

He became a naval commander and was knighted in October, 1513 for his bravery at the [[Battle of Tournai]] and made captain of the ''[[Mary Rose]]''. The following year he was made captain of the ''Magdaleyn of Founteraby''.

He was a justice of the peace for Sussex from 1524 to 1540. In 1535 he purchased the Manor of Shere (including the Vachery) in Surrey from his elder brother, Sir Edmund Braye, to whom it had been bequeathed by his uncle Sir Reginald Braye. He was appointed [[High Sheriff of Surrey]] and [[High Sheriff of Sussex|Sussex]] for 1539 and was JP for Surrey from 1554 to his death in 1558. He represented [[Surrey (UK Parliament constituency)|Surrey]] in Parliament as [[Knight of the Shire]] twice, October 1553 and April 1554, during the reign of Queen Mary.

He was made [[Lieutenant of Calais|Lieutenant of Calais Castle]] (1541–52), high treasurer for the army against France in 1545 and [[Constable of the Tower]] of London in 1556.

On his death he was buried in Cranleigh Church.

Bray married firstly, Elizabeth Lovell, daughter and coheir of Henry Lovell of [[Harting]], [[Sussex]] (divorced). He married secondly, Beatrix Shirley, daughter of Ralph Shirley of [[Wiston, Sussex]], and widow of Edward Elrington of London.

The '''European Audiovisual Observatory''' was set up by the [[Council of Europe]] as a Partial Agreement. Its legal basis is Resolution (92) 70 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, 15 December 1992. The idea for the Observatory originated at the European Audiovisual Assizes in 1989, and was actively pursued by Audiovisual Eureka during the years 1989 to 1992.

The observatory provides statistical and analytical information on the fields of: film, television, video/DVD, new audiovisual media services and public policy on film and television.

== Information ==
This information is available in the form of: Market reports, statistics and financial analyses as well as legal reports and news up-dates. The information is distributed by the Observatory in the form of products and services, some available for purchase, many free of charge: Print publications, information on-line, databases and directories, and contributions to conferences and workshops.

== Scope ==
The Observatory collects, processes and distributes information on the audiovisual sector in its member states as well as on the work of international organisations. Occasionally it also follows developments in other territories.

== Target Groups ==
The information provided by the European Audiovisual Observatory is aimed at professionals working within the audiovisual sector: producers, distributors, exhibitors, broadcasters and other media service providers, international organisations in this field, decision-makers within the various public bodies responsible for the media, national and European legislators, journalists, researchers, lawyers, investors and consultants.

== Statute and Resources ==
The ''European Audiovisual Observatory'' is based in [[Strasbourg]], [[France]]. The budget of the European Audiovisual Observatory is mainly funded by direct contributions from its member states and the [[European Union]], represented by the [[European Commission]], and partly through revenues from the sale of its ''products and services.''

== Team ==
The Executive Director, Susanne Nikoltchev, heads a multi-cultural team from several different European countries. Structurally, the Observatory is divided into two departments: The Department for Information on Markets and Financing'' headed by Gilles Fontaine, the Department for Legal Information headed by Dr. Maja Cappello.

These two departments are responsible for the collection, processing and editing of all the Observatory's information which is distributed in the form of products and services. The Observatory also hosts the secretariat of the European Platform of Regulatory Authorities (EPRA) thus allowing cooperation between the two bodies in the field of information collection. The official languages of the European Audiovisual Observatory are [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]].

== Headquarters ==
[[File:Villa schutzenberger 4.jpg|thumb|upright|Headquarters: Villa Schutzenberger (1900) in [[Strasbourg]] phot.F.J.CABRERA ]]

The Observatory is housed in the famous [[Art Nouveau]] [[Villa Schutzenberger]] in [[European Institutions in Strasbourg|Strasbourg's 'European quarter']]. This office space is made available by the City of [[Strasbourg]].

== Network ==
The European Audiovisual Observatory has built up and manages a unique European information network from which it collects its information. This network is made up of: 
* Partner organisations and institutions
* Professional information suppliers
* Selected correspondents

== Members ==
[[Image:European Audiovisual Observatory.png|thumb|right|400px]]

The European Audiovisual Observatory has 41 member states. The European Union, represented by the European Commission, is also a member. The members of the Observatory are represented on its Executive Council, which meets twice a year in order to adopt the Observatory's action plan and approve its budget. The representatives within the Executive Council usually come from those ministries and national institutions which deal with cultural or audiovisual policy.

==MAVISE==
'''MAVISE''' is a free online database on audiovisual services and companies in Europe. It is developed by the European Audiovisual Observatory of the [[Council of Europe]] and cover 41 member states, and [[Morocco]].

MAVISE is a useful source to analyse key aspects of the audiovisual industries in Europe, such as the level of [[Concentration of media ownership|media concentration]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obs.coe.int/documents/205595/264629/Media+ownership+towards+pan-European+groups/418385fa-cf0e-4c12-b233-29476177d863 Media ownership towards pan-European groups?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://la-rem.eu/2016/11/10/media-ownership-towards-pan-european-groups/ Media ownership towards pan european groups? La revue européenne des médias et du numérique]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as trends in the offer/demand of audiovisual services at regional,&lt;ref&gt;[http://shop.obs.coe.int/en/iris-special-legal-publications/43-iris-special-regional-and-local-broadcasting-in-europe.html Regional and local broadcasting in Europe – can the voice of the regions still be heard?]&lt;/ref&gt; national and European level.

It provides easy access to information on: national TV markets (42); television channels (over 12000 pan-European, national and regional channels); on-demand audiovisual services (over 1400); and audiovisual companies (over 9800 broadcasters, packagers, transmitters).

Full update of MAVISE is performed yearly every autumn. However, major market developments are continuously updated to ensure timely and accurate information.

===Sources of information===
While different sources of information are used by MAVISE team to make the data collection as comprehensive as possible, some limits are to be mentioned regarding the census of audiovisual services, for instance:
*rules for the registration/notification of on-demand services strongly differ between countries, making it often difficult to identify country of licence/registration;
*market data which are needed to identify relevant on-demand services are often lacking.

The '''Gardner–Pingree House''' is a [[historic house museum]] at 128 Essex Street in [[Salem, Massachusetts]].  It is judged to be a masterpiece of Federal architecture by the noted Salem builder [[Samuel McIntire]], and was designated a  [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1972 for its architectural significance.  It is owned by the [[Peabody Essex Museum]] as part of its architectural collection, and is open to the public for guided tours.

==Description==
The house is a three-story brick structure, rectangular in shape, with a three-story ell extending the rear.  The brick is laid in Flemish bond, and the trim is white marble.  The roof is surrounded by a low balustrade above a modillioned cornice, and is pierced by two interior brick chimneys.  There are marble trim bands separating the floors, and the third floor windows are shortened.  All windows have black shutters, and are topped by lintels with a keystone.  The main entrance is sheltered by an elliptical portico supported by four Corinthian columns.  The doorway is framed by sidelight windows and an elliptical fanlight, with pilasters rising to the base of the portico top.  The house interior features lavishly-carved woodwork in the public spaces on the first floor, including fireplace mantels, cornices, internal window shutters, and the stairway balustrades.&lt;ref name=NHL/&gt;

==History==
The house was built in 1804 by [[Samuel McIntire]] in a Federal style for John and Sarah (West) Gardner. John bought the lot from his father (John Gardner, Sr) whose cousin (John Gardner III) was the grandfather of [[John Lowell Gardner II|John Lowell Gardner I]]. John and Sarah sold the house to her brother, Nathaniel West, to cover shipping losses related to events leading up to the [[War of 1812]]. The house was sold, in 1814, to Capt. Joseph White. David Pingree bought the house in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Gardner Society blog [2011] ''Gardner–Pingree house (and murder)'' (via [http://thomasgardnerofsalem.blogspot.com/2011/12/gardner-pingree-house-and-murder.html blogspot.com])&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1933 descendants of David Pingree gave the house to the [[Essex Institute]], which merged with the [[Peabody Museum of Salem]] to form the [[Peabody Essex Museum]].&lt;ref name=NHL&gt;{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=70000541}}|title=NHL nomination for Gardner–Pingree House|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house was the site of the notorious 1830 murder of Capt. Joseph White,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/A-Murder-in-Salem.html?c=y&amp;page=7 A Murder in Salem]&lt;/ref&gt; whose death prompted a famous trial prosecuted by [[Daniel Webster]]. The trial inspired [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]].

The house was one of the filming locations for the 1979 [[Merchant Ivory]] film adaptation of [[Henry James]]' novel ''[[The Europeans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079123/locations&lt;/ref&gt;

The house was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1970,&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=966&amp;ResourceType=Building NPS NHL listing information]&lt;/ref&gt; and is a contributing property to both the [[Essex Institute Historic District]] and the [[Salem Common Historic District (Salem, Massachusetts)|Salem Common Historic District]].

Gaumont Pathé Archives was set up after the catalogues of Cinémathèque Gaumont and Pathé Archives were combined in 2004. This venture is now the leading French image bank for black and white and colour images illustrating the history of the 20th and 21st centuries. The archive contains nearly 12,000 hours of footage including [[Pathé]], [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]] and Eclair newsreels from 1908 to 1979, Sygma archives and the recently acquired Soviet archives from the Arkeion catalog, and numerous documentaries.

Gaumont-Pathe Archives also conserves and showcases silent movies from the combined catalogues of Gaumont and Pathé which contains over 2,000 titles. These include films by the founding fathers of French cinema, from [[Leonce Perret]] and [[Albert Capellani]] to [[Ferdinand Zecca]] and [[Louis Feuillade]].

==Corporate Structure==
The company, chaired by Mrs Martine Offroy, is 57.5%-owned by Gaumont and 42.5% by Pathé.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.focalint.org/member-news/news/881/gaumont-pathe-archives-become-one-in-st-ouen-paris Merger Announcement]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden''' is an [[art museum]] beside the [[National Mall]], in [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[United States]]. The museum was initially endowed during the 1960s with the permanent art collection of [[Joseph H. Hirshhorn]]. It was designed by [[architect]] [[Gordon Bunshaft]] and is part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. It was conceived as the United States' museum of [[Contemporary art|contemporary]] and [[modern art]] and currently focuses its collection-building and exhibition-planning mainly on the post–[[World War II]] period, with particular emphasis on art made during the last 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden: About | publisher= ARTINFO | year= 2008 | url= http://www.artinfo.com/galleryguide/21315/7833/about/hirshhorn-museum-and-sculpture-garden-washington/ | accessdate= 2008-07-28 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hirshhorn is sited halfway between the Washington Monument and the US Capitol, anchoring the southernmost end of the so-called L'Enfant axis (perpendicular to the Mall's green carpet). The National Archives/National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden across the Mall, and the National Portrait Gallery/Smithsonian American Art building several blocks to the north, also mark this pivotal axis, a key element of both the 1791 city plan by Pierre L'Enfant and the 1901 MacMillan Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Hirshhorn: The Architect|url=http://hirshhorn.si.edu/collection/history-of-the-hirshhorn/#collection=history-of-the-hirshhorn&amp;detail=http%3A//hirshhorn.si.edu/bio/the-architect/|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building itself is an attraction, an open cylinder elevated on four massive "legs," with a large fountain occupying the central courtyard. Before architect [[Gordon Bunshaft]] designed the building, the Smithsonian staff reportedly told him that, if it did not provide a striking contrast to everything else in the city, then it would be unfit for housing a modern art collection. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== History ==

===Founding===
In the late 1930s, the [[United States Congress]] mandated an art museum for the National Mall. At the time, the only venue for visual art was the [[National Gallery of Art]], which focuses on [[Dutch art|Dutch]], [[French art|French]], and [[Italian art]]. During the 1940s [[World War II]] shifted the project into the background.

Meanwhile, [[Joseph H. Hirshhorn]], now in his forties and enjoying great success from [[uranium]]-mining investments, began creating his collection from classic [[French Impressionism]] to works by living artists, [[American modernism]] of the early 20th century, and [[sculpture]]. Then, in 1955, Hirshhorn sold his uranium interests for more than $50-million. He expanded his collection to warehouses, an apartment in [[New York City]], and an estate in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], with extensive area for sculpture.

A 1962 sculpture show at New York's [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] awakened an international art community to the breadth of Hirshhorn's holdings. Word of his collection of modern and contemporary paintings also circulated, and institutions in [[Italy]], [[Israel]], [[Canada]], [[California]], and [[New York City]] vied for the collection. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and Smithsonian Secretary [[S. Dillon Ripley]] successfully campaigned for a new museum on the National Mall.

In 1966, an [[Act of Congress]] established the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution. Most of the funding was federal, but Hirshhorn later contributed $1-million toward construction. Joseph and his fourth wife, [[Olga Zatorsky Hirshhorn]], visited the [[White House]]. The groundbreaking was in 1969 and [[Abram Lerner]] was named the founding Director. He oversaw research, conservation, and installation of more than 6,000 items brought from the Hirshhorns' Connecticut estate and other properties to Washington, DC. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Joseph Hirshhorn spoke at the inauguration (1974), saying:

{{quote|It is an honor to have given my art collection to the people of the [[United States]] as a small repayment for what this nation has done for me and others like me who arrived here as [[immigrants]]. What I accomplished in the United States I could not have accomplished anywhere else in the world.}}

One million visitors saw the 850-work inaugural show in the first six months.

In 1984, James T. Demetrion, fourteen-year director of the [[Des Moines Art Center]] in Iowa, succeeded Abram Lerner as the Hirshhorn's director. Art collector and retail store founder [[Sydney Lewis]] of Richmond, Virginia, succeeded Senator [[Daniel P. Moynihan]] as board chairman.&lt;ref&gt;Hirshhorn Museum Official Site&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr. Demetrion held the post for more than 17 years.

Ned Rifkin became director in February 2002, returning to the Hirshhorn after directorship positions at the [[Menil Collection]] in Texas and the [[High Museum of Art]] in Atlanta, Georgia. Rifkin was previously chief curator of the Hirshhorn from 1986 until 1991. In October 2003, Rifkin was named Under Secretary for Art of the Smithsonian.

In 2005, Olga Viso was named director of the Hirshhorn. Viso joined the curatorial department of the Hirshhorn in 1995 as assistant curator, was named associate curator in 1998, and served as curator of contemporary art from 2000 to 2003. In October 2003, Viso was named deputy director of the Hirshhorn, a post she held until her 2005 promotion to director.  After two years, Ms. Viso accepted the position of Director of the [[Walker Art Center]] in Minneapolis, departing in December 2007.

Chief Curator and Deputy Director [[Kerry Brougher]] served as Acting Director for more than a year until an international search led to the hiring of Richard Koshalek, who was named the fifth director of the Hirshhorn in February, 2009.

[[File:Cards for Hirshhorn Wish Tree.JPG|thumb|Hirshhorn Sculpture Garden: cards for [[Yoko Ono]]'s ''[[Wish Tree for Washington, DC]]'']]

Richard Koshalek (born 1942) was president of [[Art Center College of Design]] in Pasadena, Calif., from 1999 until January 2009. Before that, he served as director of The [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Los Angeles for nearly 20 years. At both institutions, he was noted for his commitment to new artistic initiatives, including commissioned works, scholarly exhibitions and publications and the building of new facilities that garnered architectural acclaim. He worked with architect [[Frank Gehry]] on the design and construction of [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|MOCA]]'s Geffen Contemporary (1983), a renovated warehouse popularly known as the Temporary Contemporary. He also worked with the Japanese architect [[Arata Isozaki]] on the museum's permanent home in Los Angeles (1986). Koshalek resigned in 2013 after the Bloomberg Bubble controversy (see below).

On June 5, 2014, Hirshhorn trustees announced that they had hired [[Melissa Chiu]], director of [[Asia Society|Asia Society Museum]] in [[New York City]], to be the Hirshhorn's new director. Chiu, who was born in [[Darwin, Australia]], is a scholar of contemporary Chinese art. Chiu oversaw the Hirshhorn's 40th anniversary celebration in the fall of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/arts/design/asia-society-museum-director-to-lead-hirshhorn.html|last1=Cohen|first1=Patricia|last2=Vogel|first2=Carol|title=Asia Society Museum Director to Lead Hirshhorn|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 5, 2014|accessdate=June 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiu began her tenure at the Hirshhorn in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/06/05/hirshhorn-names-n-y-asia-society-museums-melissa-chiu-as-new-director/|last=Parker|first=Lonnae O'Neal|title=Hirshhorn Names N.Y.

===''Bloomberg Bubble'' controversy===
In 2009, then Director Richard Koshalek announced that an inflatable structure would be erected over the Hirshhorn's central plaza to create a new public space. The Seasonal Inflatable Structure, to be called the "Bloomberg Bubble," was due to be erected in 2013 and would be inflated annually for one two-month period. It was supposed to create a 14,000-square-foot space for performance and lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/arts-post/post/hirshhorn-bubble-to-be-called-bloomberg-balloon/2012/03/23/gIQAHRIIWS_blog.html | date=March 23, 2012 | title=Hirshhorn 'Bubble' to be called Bloomberg Balloon | author=Maura Judkis | newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Liz Diller: A giant bubble for debate | url=http://www.ted.com/talks/liz_diller_a_giant_bubble_for_debate.html | publisher=TED 2012 | date=March 2012 | accessdate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by [[Diller Scofidio + Renfro]], the proposal won a progressive architecture award from [[Architect (magazine)|''Architect'' magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date= February 9, 2011 | title=P/A AWARDS Award: Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden Seasonal Expansion | author=Vernon Mays | magazine=ARCHITECT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirshhorn officials began reconsidering the Bubble in 2013. Construction cost estimates for the structure more than tripled to $15.5 million from $5 million, and no major gifts for the project were received between 2010 and May 2013. A Hirshhorn study also concluded that the cost of programming (such as symposia and special events) using the Bubble were likely to run a $2.8 million annual deficit. The Hirshhorn's board of directors evenly split on a vote to proceed with the project in May 2013. In the wake of the vote, seen as a referendum on his leadership, museum director Richard Koshalek announced he would resign by the end of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/hirshhorn-board-split-on-bubble-project/2013/05/23/5555f43a-c310-11e2-8c3b-0b5e9247e8ca_story.html Parker, Lonnae O'Neal.

She cited what the ''Washington Post'' characterized as "a board, a museum and the larger Smithsonian Institution at a crossroads, roiled by a lack of transparency, trust, vision and good faith".

== Architecture==
[[File:Joseph Herman Hirshhorn.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of Joseph H Hirshhorn'', by [[Pablo Serrano]]]]
The museum was designed by architect [[Gordon Bunshaft]] (1909-1990) and provides {{convert|60000|sqft|m²}} of exhibition space inside and nearly four acres outside in its two-level Sculpture Garden and plaza.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as: "a fortress of a building that works as a museum." An original plan with a reflecting pool across the Mall was approved in July 1967. When excavation started, a controversy arose, resulting in a revised design, with a smaller footprint, which was approved on July 1, 1971.&lt;ref&gt;''A Garden for Art'', Valerie J. Fletcher, LOC # 97-61991, p.19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

;Architectural timeline
* 1969. The Hirshhorn Museum groundbreaking takes place on the former site of the [[Army Medical Museum and Library]] (built 1887) after the brick structure is demolished. A controversy soon develops over naming a building on the historic National Mall after a living person, as well as the new federal museum's modern look and intrusively expansive sculptural grounds.
* 1971. Amid this climate of controversy, Bunshaft's original conception for the Sculpture Garden-an elongated, sunken rectangle crossing the Mall with a large reflecting pool-is abandoned. He prepares a new design based on an idea outlined by art critic [[Benjamin Forgey]] in a ''[[Washington Star]]'' article. The new adaptation shifts the garden's Mall orientation from perpendicular to parallel and reduces its size from {{convert|2|acre|m2}} to {{convert|1.3|acre|m2}}. The design is deliberately stark, using gravel surfaces and minimal plantings to visually emphasize the works of art.
* 1974. The museum opens with three floors of painting galleries, a fountain plaza for sculpture, and the Sculpture Garden. In preparation for the opening, Hirshhorn [[curator]]s and staff spend several months scrupulously planning the locations of artworks, both indoors and outdoors. Lightweight foam-core "dummy" sculptures are used to resolve the final placement of works in the garden. The originals, many of which had been airlifted from Hirshhorn's Connecticut estate onto flatbed trucks for transport, are put into place in the weeks before the opening.
* 1981. Closed since the summer of 1979, the Sculpture Garden reopens in September after a renovation and redesign by Lester Collins, a well-known landscape architect and founder of the [[Innesfree Foundation]]. The design introduces plantings, paved surfaces, accessibility ramps, and areas of lawn.
* 1985. The Museum Shop is moved to the lobby, increasing exhibition space at its former location on the lower level.
* 1993. Closed since December 1991, the Hirshhorn Plaza reopens after a renovation and redesign by [[landscape architect]] [[James Urban]]. The {{convert|2.7|acre|m2|adj=on}} area around and under the building is repaved in two tones of gray granite, and raised areas of grass and trees are added to the east and west.
* 2014. The Museum Shop is moved back to the lower level. The ongoing installation of [[Barbara Kruger|Barbara Kruger's]] Belief and Doubt connects the shop with the lower level exhibition space.

;Comments and criticisms
* "The whole complex has been designed as one composition ... Bunshaft's design is not concerned with the grandeur of the Mall. It is concerned with the greater grandeur of his museum and it gives us an awful lot of [[Beaux-Arts architecture|beaux-arts]] pavement and pomposity that no longer seem to suit the taste and style of our times." [Preliminary design criticized] Wolf Von Eckhardt, ''The Washington Post'', February 6, 1971.
* "The circular plan is not only clear, but also provides a pleasant processional sequence that goes a long way. ... The fortress quality of the Hirshhorn suggests some rather obvious thoughts about the nature of housing art in our time. But the building's architecture ... is less the product of a desire to make a statement ... than it is a logical progression in aesthetic development. ... " Paul Goldberger, ''The New York Times'', October 2, 1974.
* "[The building] is known around Washington as the bunker or gas tank, lacking only gun emplacements or an [[Exxon]] sign ... It totally lacks the essential factors of esthetic strength and provocative vitality that make genuine 'brutalism' a positive and rewarding style. This is born-dead, neo-penitentiary modern. Its mass is not so much aggressive or overpowering as merely leaden." Ada Louise Huxtable, ''The New York Times'', October 6, 1974.
* "The parched severity of [the original Sculpture Garden] was not without merit, but the appeal was more to the mind than to the senses, more theoretical than practical. ... The new design reinforces the identity of the garden as a welcoming urban park. ... [This] park for art ... serves the sculpture. The divisions of the space prove essential accents; artworks pop in and out of view as the spectator moves about the space. ... " Benjamin Forgey, ''The Washington Post'', September 12, 1981.
* "[The Hirshhorn is] the biggest piece of abstract art in town - a huge, hollowed cylinder raised on four massive piers, in absolute command of its walled compound on the Mall. ... The circular fountain ... is a grand concoction ... that for good reason has become the museum's visual trademark." Benjamin Forgey, ''The Washington Post'', November 4, 1989.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6239">'''Hispanicisation''' or '''hispanisation''', also known as '''castilianization''' or '''castilianisation''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''castellanización'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&amp;q=hispanicisation Dictionary definition of Hispanicization]&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the process by which a place or person becomes influenced by [[Hispanic]] culture or a process of cultural and/or linguistic change in which something non-Hispanic becomes Hispanic.  Hispanicization is illustrated by spoken Spanish, production and consumption of [[Hispanic cuisine|Hispanic food]], [[Spanish language]] music, and participation in Hispanic festivals and holidays.&lt;ref&gt;Hispanic Spaces, Latino Places: Community and Cultural Diversity in Contemporary America, 2004. Edited by Dan Arreola, found in Chapter 14 "Hispanization of Hereford, Texas"&lt;/ref&gt; In the former Spanish colonies, the term is also used in the narrow linguistic sense of the Spanish language replacing indigenous languages.

==Spain==
Within [[Spain]], the term hispanization can refer to the cultural and linguistic absorption of the Berber Guanches, the indigenous people of the Canary Islands in the century following their conquest in the 15th century.

It is much more rarely used as a synonym for castilianisation (castellanización) i.e. the historical process whereby speakers of minority Spanish languages such as Basque, Catalan, Galician, Asturian, Leonese or Aragonese are linguistically assimilated and progressively abandon their language for Spanish. Since all of the aforementioned languages are co-official national languages together with Castilian Spanish, the term castilianisation is preferred.

==United States==
According to the [[2000 United States Census]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/censr-18.pdf US Bureau of the Census, 2004 (Page 10)]&lt;/ref&gt; about 75% of all Hispanics spoke Spanish in the home. Hispanic retention rates are so high in parts of Texas and New Mexico and along the border because the percentage of Hispanics living there is also very high. [[Laredo, Texas]]; [[Chimayo, New Mexico]]; [[Nogales, Arizona]]; and [[Coachella, California]], for example, all have Hispanic populations greater than 90 percent. Furthermore, in these places have had a Hispanic-majority population since the time of the Spanish conquest and colonization of the area in the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Hispanic Community Types and Assimilation in Mex-America 1998. Haverluk, Terrence W. The Professional Geographer, 50(4) pages 465-480&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hispanic America==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
In Spanish America it is also used to refer to the imposition of the [[Spanish language]] in the former Spanish colonies such as [[Mexico]] and its adoption by [[indigenous people]]s. This refers to Spain's influence which began in the late 15th century and the [[Spanish Empire]] beginning in the colonization of the [[Canary Islands]] in 1402 which is now part of Spain. Later the landing of Christopher Columbus in 1492 in the [[Caribbean]] then [[Central America]] and [[South America]]. All these countries were Hispanicised; however, there are still many people there who hold a culture that still has its origins in the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. Until recently, castilianization has been official policy by the governments of many [[Hispanic America]]n countries. Only recently programs of [[intercultural bilingual education]] have been introduced to a substantial extent.

==Philippines==
{{see also|Spanish influence on Filipino culture}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
The [[Philippines]] archipelago was ruled from [[Mexico City]] as a territory of [[New Spain]], from 1565 to 1821 and as a province of Spain until 1898. Since the late 16th century, [[Culture of Spain|Spanish]] and [[Hispanic culture]] has intemperately influenced, shaped, and became the foundation of modern Filipino cultural landscape. Derived from [[Austronesian]] and [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] influences, modern Filipino culture is described{{by whom|date=August 2011}} as a blend of Eastern and Western (mostly Spanish) traditions. Although most Filipinos speak an Austronesian language, the languages of the Philippines have thousands of Spanish loanwords. Furthermore, a number of Filipinos to the south speak a Spanish-based Creole known as [[Chavacano]].  This is also true with the Chamorro language in Guam, which lived side by side with Spanish for over 300 years.  Many people{{Who|date=April 2011}} consider these languages of the Pacific, Hispano-Austronesian languages, because of the heavy influence of Spanish on the language.

National City Bank of N.Y.''', 200 F. 287, 293 (S.D.N.Y. 1911) was a landmark case in [[contract]] law articulating the [[Contract|Objective Theory of Contracts]] and dealing with the meaning of a promise in a contract. To wit, [[Judge Learned Hand]] opined: "A contract has, strictly speaking, nothing to do with the personal, or individual, intent of the parties. A contract is an obligation attached by the mere force of law to certain acts of the parties, usually words, which ordinarily accompany and represent a known intent. If, however, it were proved by twenty bishops that either party when he used the words intended something else than the usual meaning which the law imposes on them, he would still be held, unless there were mutual mistake or something else of the sort."

{{EnigmaSeries}}
'''Hut 3''' was a wartime section of the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)]] at [[Bletchley Park]] tasked with the translation, interpretation and distribution of German Army (Heer) and Air Force (Luftwaffe) messages deciphered by [[Hut 6]]. The messages were largely encrypted by [[Enigma machine]]s.

== Location ==
Located initially in one of the original single-story wooden huts, the name “Hut 3” was retained when Huts 3, 6 &amp; 8 moved to a new brick building, Block D, in February 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs (2011) p.70&lt;/ref&gt; Then the decodes from Hut 6 for Hut 3 
which had been sent in a wooden tray from one hatch to another via a wooden tunnel between the huts were sent from the Hut 6 Decoding Room by a conveyor belt that “never stopped” &lt;ref&gt;Welchman (1982) pp.125, 159&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
The Enigma “Red” cypher was the main cypher used by the Luftwaffe in every theatre where they operated. Red had been broken sporadically from the beginning of 1940, and from 22 May BP overcame some changes to the Enigma machines. From then on, Hut 6 broke Red daily to the end of the war, and it became the “constant staple” of [[Ultra|ULTRA]]. [[Peter Calvocoressi|Calvocoressi]] wrote that later in the war “we in Hut 3 would get a bit tetchy if Hut 6 had not broken Red by breakfast time.” &lt;ref&gt;Calvacoressi (1980) p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially there were only four people in Hut 3, and there were serious personal frictions between them. They were the original leader, Lieutenant-Commander Malcolm Saunders, Squadron Leader Robert Humphreys (senior liaison officer with the Air Force), Captain Curtis (senior liaison officer with the War Office, who knew no German), and Cambridge academic [[F. L. Lucas]] who had been in the Intelligence Corps in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs (2011) p.91-2&lt;/ref&gt; Humphreys was “an excellent German linguist, but no team player. He wanted to get his own way. He found this difficult to do if only because Saunders had a mind of his own. [[Nigel de Grey]] described the situation as 'an imbroglio of conflicting jealousies, intrigues and differing opinions'. Initially [[Edward Travis|Travis]] moved the three [Saunders, Humphreys and Curtis] out of Hut 3 and put a small committee including [[Eric Malcolm Jones|Eric Jones]] in charge. As this did not work, Jones was made sole head in July 1942. Just over a year after he took over, H. S. Marchant was made his deputy, and the pair were in charge to the end of the war.” &lt;ref&gt;Briggs (2011) pp.9, 76, 91-92, 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Army and Air Force [[Ultra]] was distributed by the SLUs (Special Liaison Units) set up by [[Frederick Winterbotham]]. By the end of the war there were about 40 SLUs to 40 commands. Signals were given a priority from Z to ZZZZZ (the highest of 5), and about 100,000 signals were sent to commands during the war &lt;ref&gt;Calvocoressi (1980) pp.60-61, 86f&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of interpretation for Hut 3 were that if the text was not explicit the Hut 3 officer could not add his interpretation without qualification; for a 1944 SS Panzer message where the placename had been missed or corrupted when received, the officer did not say simply “Dreux” but would say “slight indications Dreux” or
“fair indications Dreux” or “strong indications Dreux”.&lt;ref&gt;Calvocoressi (1980) p60, 127&lt;/ref&gt; They could also add glosses preceded by the word “Comment”.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs (2011) p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

The Air Index had “hundreds of thousands” of cards about 5 by 9 inches; so important that they were photographed and stored in the underground stack of the Bodleian Library in Oxford in case they were destroyed by bombing. Run by “about two dozen girls” and a man who was a “strange genius”, it had cards for every individual, unit, place or equipment so that any previous reference to (say) Major So-and-So could be found. There were two card indexes, 3A &amp; 3M.&lt;ref&gt;Calvocoressi (1980) pp.61-2, 116&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph John Campbell''' (1904–1987) was an American Professor of Literature at [[Sarah Lawrence College]] who worked in [[comparative mythology]] and [[comparative religion]]. His work covers many aspects of the human experience. Campbell's most well-known work is his book ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949), in which he discusses his theory of the journey of the [[Archetype|archetypal]] [[hero]] shared by world [[mythology|mythologies]], termed the [[monomyth]].

Since the publication of ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'', Campbell's theory has been applied by a wide variety of modern writers and artists. His philosophy has been summarized by his own often repeated phrase: "Follow your bliss."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcf.org/new/index.php?categoryid=11 Campbell's biography] and [http://www.jcf.org/new/index.php?categoryid=31 Joseph Campbell: "Follow Your Bliss"] from the Joseph Campbell Foundation website.&lt;/ref&gt; He gained recognition in Hollywood when [[George Lucas]] credited Campbell's work as influencing his ''[[Star Wars]]'' saga.&lt;ref name=firemind&gt;[[Stephen Larsen|Stephen]] and Robin Larsen, ''Joseph Campbell: A Fire in the Mind''. 2002, p. 541.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Background===
Joseph Campbell was born in [[White Plains, New York]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcf.org/new/index.php?categoryid=11|title=Joseph Campbell Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on March 26, 1904, the son of Josephine (née Lynch) and Charles William Campbell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ke4pAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22the%20son%20of%20Charles%20William%20Campbell,%20a%20businessman,%20and%20Josephine%20Lynch%22&amp;dq=%22the%20son%20of%20Charles%20William%20Campbell,%20a%20businessman,%20and%20Josephine%20Lynch%22|title=American national biography|first1=John Arthur|last1=Garraty|first2=Mark Christopher|last2=Carnes|first3=American Council of Learned|last3=Societies|date=January 1, 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195206357}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was from an upper-middle-class [[Irish Catholic]] family. During his childhood, he moved with his family to nearby [[New Rochelle, New York]]. In 1919, a fire destroyed the family home in New Rochelle, killing his grandmother.&lt;ref name="essortment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/joseph-campbell-biography-20639.html|publisher=essortment.com|title= Joseph Campbell Bio |accessdate=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, Campbell graduated from the [[Canterbury School (Connecticut)|Canterbury School]] in [[New Milford, Connecticut]]. While at [[Dartmouth College]] he studied biology and mathematics, but decided that he preferred the humanities. He transferred to [[Columbia University]], where he received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[English literature]] in 1925 and a [[Master of Arts]] degree in [[medieval literature]] in 1927. At Dartmouth he had joined [[Delta Tau Delta]]. An accomplished athlete, he received awards in track and field events, and, for a time, was among the fastest half-mile runners in the world.{{sfn|Campbell|2003|pp=20–25}}

In 1924, Campbell traveled to Europe with his family. On the ship during his return trip he encountered the messiah elect of the [[Theosophical Society]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]]; they discussed [[Indian philosophy]], sparking in Campbell an interest in [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu]] and [[Indian philosophy|Indian thought]].{{sfn|Campbell|2003|pp=20, 29}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esalen.org/page/joseph-campbell . Joseph Campbell Bio. Retrieved on 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, he received a [[Scholarship|fellowship]] from Columbia University to study in Europe. Campbell studied [[Old French]], [[Provençal (dialect)|Provençal]], and [[Sanskrit]] at the [[University of Paris]] and the [[University of Munich]]. He learned to read and speak French and German.{{sfn|Campbell|2003|pp=29–35}}

On his return to Columbia University in 1929, Campbell expressed a desire to pursue the study of Sanskrit and [[modern art]] in addition to [[Medieval literature]]. Lacking faculty approval, Campbell withdrew from graduate studies. Later in life he jested that it is a sign of incompetence to have a PhD in the [[liberal arts education|liberal arts]], the discipline covering his work.{{sfn|Campbell|1990|pp=54–55}}

===The Great Depression===
With the arrival of the [[Great Depression]], Campbell spent the next five years (1929–1934) living in a rented shack in [[Woodstock, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Faulkner|first=Larry R.|title=Excerpts of remarks made at a dinner honoring new Phi Beta Kappa members|url=http://www.utexas.edu/president/past/faulkner/speeches/phibetakappa_050299.html|website=Office of the President website|publisher=The University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=August 13, 2012|date=May 2, 1999}} Citing a conversation between Campbell and [[Bill Moyers]]. "There was a wonderful old man up in Woodstock, New York, who had a piece of property he would rent out for twenty dollars a year or so to any young person he thought might have a future in the arts. There was no running water, only here and there a well and a pump. ... That is where I did most of my basic reading and work."&lt;/ref&gt; There, he contemplated the next course of his life&lt;ref&gt;Larsen and Larsen, 2002, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; while engaged in intensive and rigorous independent study. He later said that he "would divide the day into four four-hour periods, of which I would be reading in three of the four-hour periods, and free one of them&amp;nbsp;... I would get nine hours of sheer reading done a day. And this went on for five years straight."{{sfn|Campbell|2003|pp=52–53}}

Campbell traveled to California for a year (1931–1932), continuing his independent studies and becoming close friends with the budding writer [[John Steinbeck]] and his wife Carol. Campbell was introduced to the Steinbecks by author and early nutritionist [[Adelle Davis]] whom he met and developed a close relationship with on a cruise to the Caribbean with his father in December 1929.{{sfn|Campbell|2003|pp=52}}&lt;ref name=fireinthemind/&gt;{{rp|156}} On the [[Monterey Peninsula]], Campbell, like John Steinbeck, fell under the spell of the [[marine biologist]] [[Ed Ricketts]] (the model for "Doc" in Steinbeck's novel ''[[Cannery Row (novel)|Cannery Row]]'' as well as central characters in several other novels).&lt;ref&gt;Larsen and Larsen, 2002, chapters 8 and 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell lived for a while next door to Ricketts, participated in professional and social activities at his neighbor's, and accompanied him, along with Xenia and Sasha Kashevaroff, on a 1932 journey to [[Juneau]], Alaska on the ''Grampus''.&lt;ref name=Straley&gt;{{cite conference|first = John| last = Straley| authorlink = John Straley| title = Sitka's ''Cannery Row'' Connection and the Birth of Ecological Thinking| booktitle = 2011 Sitka WhaleFest Symposium: stories of our changing seas| publisher = Sitka WhaleFest  | date = November 13, 2011| location = Sitka, Alaska}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell began writing a novel centered on Ricketts as a hero but, unlike Steinbeck, did not complete his book.&lt;ref&gt;Tamm, Eric Enno (2005) [http://www.seaaroundus.org/OtherWebsites/2005/Of_myths_and_men_in_Monterey.pdf ''Of Myths and Men in Monterey: "Ed Heads" See Doc Ricketts as a Cult Figure''], seaaroundus.org; accessed August 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell continued his independent reading while teaching for a year in 1933 at the [[Canterbury School (Connecticut)|Canterbury School]], during which time he also attempted to publish works of fiction. While teaching at the Canterbury School, Campbell sold his first short story ''Strictly Platonic'' to ''Liberty'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Larsen|Larsen]] and Larsen, 2002, p. 214; [http://www.online.pacifica.edu/cgl/Campbellchronology Pacifica Graduate Institute | Joseph Campbell &amp; Marija Gimbutas Library | Joseph Campbell—Chronology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227072637/http://www.online.pacifica.edu/cgl/Campbellchronology |date=December 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Campbell|2004|p=291}}

===Sarah Lawrence College===
[[File:JosephCampbellandJeanErdmancirca1939.jpg|thumb|upright|Campbell and [[Jean Erdman]] {{circa|1939}}]]
In 1934, Campbell accepted a position as Professor of Literature at [[Sarah Lawrence College]]. In 1938, he married one of his former students, the dancer-choreographer [[Jean Erdman]]. For most of their 49 years of marriage they shared a two-room apartment in Greenwich Village in New York City. In the 1980s they also purchased an apartment in Honolulu and divided their time between the two cities. They did not have any children.

Early in [[World War II]], Campbell attended a lecture by the [[Indologist]] [[Heinrich Zimmer]]; the two men became good friends. After Zimmer's death, Campbell was given the task of editing and posthumously publishing Zimmer's papers, which he would do over the following decade.

In 1955–1956, as the last volume of Zimmer's posthumous (''The Art of Indian Asia, its Mythology and Transformations'') was finally about to be published, Campbell took a sabbatical from Sarah Lawrence College and traveled, for the first time, to Asia. He spent six months in southern Asia (mostly India) and another six in East Asia (mostly Japan). This year had a profound influence on his thinking about Asian religion and myth, and also on the necessity for teaching [[comparative mythology]] to a larger, non-academic audience.&lt;ref&gt;See Joseph Campbell, ''Baksheesh and Brahman: Asian Journals—India'' and ''Sake and Satori: Asian Journals—Japan'', New World Library, 2002, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Campbell retired from Sarah Lawrence College, after having taught there for 38 years.

===Later life and death===
Campbell attended a [[Grateful Dead]] concert in 1986, and marveled that "Everyone has just lost themselves in everybody else here!" With the Dead, Campbell put on a conference called "Ritual and Rapture from Dionysus to the Grateful Dead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mythic Dimension: Selected Essays 1959–1987|last=Campbell|first=Joseph|publisher=New World Library|year=2007|isbn=978-1-60868-491-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell died at his home in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], on October 30, 1987, from complications of [[esophageal cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/02/obituaries/joseph-campbell-writer-known-for-his-scholarship-on-mythology.html, "Joseph Campbell, Writer Known For His Scholarship on Mythology "], ''The New York Times''. .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024212/http://www.jcf.org/new/images/people/joe/grave_marker.jpg Joseph Campbell grave marker]&lt;/ref&gt; Before his death he had completed filming the series of interviews with [[Bill Moyers]] that aired the following spring as ''[[The Power of Myth]]''. He is buried in O'ahu Cemetery, Honolulu.

==Influences==

===Art, literature, philosophy===

Campbell often referred to the work of modern writers [[James Joyce]] and [[Thomas Mann]] in his lectures and writings, as well as to the art of [[Pablo Picasso]]. He was introduced to their work during his stay as a graduate student in Paris. Campbell eventually corresponded with Mann.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell Collection and at the OPUS Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

The works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] had a profound effect on Campbell's thinking; he quoted their writing frequently.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The "follow your bliss" philosophy attributed to Campbell following the original broadcast of ''The Power of Myth'' (see below) derives from the [[Hindu]] [[Upanishads]]; however, Campbell was possibly also influenced by the 1922 [[Sinclair Lewis]] novel ''[[Babbitt (novel)|Babbitt]]''. In ''[[The Power of Myth]],'' Campbell quotes from the novel:

{{quote|
''Campbell'': Have you ever read [[Sinclair Lewis]]' 
''[[Babbitt (novel)|Babbitt]]''?

''Moyers'': Not in a long time.

''Campbell'': Remember the last line? 'I have never done a thing that I wanted to do in all my life.' That is a man who never followed his bliss.&lt;ref&gt;''The Power of Myth,'' Doubleday and Co., 1988, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Psychology and anthropology===

The anthropologist [[Leo Frobenius]] and his disciple [[Adolf Ellegard Jensen]] were important to Campbell's view of cultural history. Campbell was also influenced by the psychological work of [[Abraham Maslow]] and [[Stanislav Grof]].

Campbell's ideas regarding myth and its relation to the human psyche are dependent in part on the pioneering work of [[Sigmund Freud]], but in particular on the work of Jung, whose studies of human psychology greatly influenced Campbell. Campbell's conception of myth is closely related to the Jungian method of dream interpretation, which is heavily reliant on symbolic interpretation. Jung's insights into [[archetype]]s were heavily influenced by the ''[[Bardo Thodol]]'' (also known as ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead''). In his book ''The Mythic Image'', Campbell quotes Jung's statement about the ''Bardo Thodol'', that it
{{quote|belongs to that class of writings which not only are of interest to specialists in [[Mahayana Buddhism]], but also, because of their deep humanity and still deeper insight into the secrets of the human psyche, make an especial appeal to the layman seeking to broaden his knowledge of life&amp;nbsp;... For years, ever since it was first published, the ''Bardo Thodol'' has been my constant companion, and to it I owe not only many stimulating ideas and discoveries, but also many fundamental insights.{{sfn|Campbell|1974|p=392}}}}

==Comparative mythology and Campbell's theories==

===Monomyth===
{{Main|Monomyth}}
Campbell's concept of ''monomyth'' (one myth) refers to the theory that sees all mythic narratives as variations of a single great story. The theory is based on the observation that a common pattern exists beneath the narrative elements of most great myths, regardless of their origin or time of creation. Campbell often referred to the ideas of [[Adolf Bastian]] and his distinction between what he called "folk" and "elementary" ideas, the latter referring to the prime matter of monomyth while the former to the multitude of local forms the myth takes in order to remain an up-to-date carrier of sacred meanings. The central pattern most studied by Campbell is often referred to as ''[[Hero's journey|the hero's journey]]'' and was first described in ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://orias.berkeley.edu/hero/|title=Monomyth Website, ORIAS, UC Berkeley|last=|first=|date=2012-12-26|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226220838/http://orias.berkeley.edu/hero/|archive-date=2012-12-26|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; An enthusiast of novelist [[James Joyce]],&lt;ref name="jcf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcf.org/works.php?id=331|publisher=jcf.org|title=Joseph Campbell Foundation&amp;nbsp;– Works: ''Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake'', A|accessdate=January 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711190723/https://www.jcf.org/works.php?id=331|archive-date=July 11, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell borrowed the term ''monomyth'' from Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.{{sfn|Campbell|1949|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;30, n.&amp;nbsp;35}} Campbell also made heavy use of [[Carl Jung]]'s theories on the structure of the human psyche, and he often used terms such as [[Anima and animus|''anima''/''animus'']] and ''[[Self in Jungian psychology|ego consciousness]]''.

As a strong believer in the [[Adolf Bastian#The Psychic Unity of Mankind|psychic unity of mankind]] and its poetic expression through mythology, Campbell made use of the concept to express the idea that the whole of the human race can be seen as engaged in the effort of making the world ''"transparent to transcendence"'' by showing that underneath the world of phenomena lies an eternal source which is constantly pouring its energies into this world of time, suffering, and ultimately death. To achieve this task one needs to speak about things that existed before and beyond words, a seemingly impossible task, the solution to which lies in the metaphors found in myths. These metaphors are statements that point beyond themselves into the transcendent. The Hero's Journey was the story of the man or woman who, through great suffering, reached an experience of the eternal source and returned with gifts powerful enough to set their society free.

As this story spread through space and evolved through time, it was broken down into various local forms (masks), depending on the social structures and environmental pressures that existed for the culture that interpreted it. The basic structure, however, has remained relatively unchanged and can be classified using the various stages of a hero's adventure through the story, stages such as ''the Call to Adventure, Receiving Supernatural Aid, Meeting with the Goddess/Atonement with the Father'' and ''Return''. These stages, as well as the symbols one encounters throughout the story, provide the necessary [[metaphor]]s to express the spiritual truths the story is trying to convey. Metaphor for Campbell, in contrast with ''[[simile|comparisons]]'' which make use of the word ''like'', pretend to a literal interpretation of what they are referring to, as in the sentence "[[Jesus]] is the Son of God" rather than "the relationship of man to God is ''like'' that of a son to a father".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell J. [1999] Mythos: The shaping of our mythic tradition&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000 documentary ''Joseph Campbell: A Hero's Journey'', he explains God in terms of a metaphor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;God is a metaphor for a mystery that absolutely transcends all human categories of thought, even the categories of being and non-being. Those are categories of thought. I mean it's as simple as that. So it depends on how much you want to think about it. Whether it's doing you any good. Whether it is putting you in touch with the mystery that's the ground of your own being. If it isn't, well, it's a lie. So half the people in the world are religious people who think that their metaphors are facts. Those are what we call theists. The other half are people who know that the metaphors are not facts. And so, they're lies. Those are the atheists.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell: The Hero's Journey, 2000 documentary (at 0:04 point)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some scholars have disagreed with the concept of the "monomyth" because of its oversimplification of different cultures. According to [[Robert S. Ellwood|Robert Ellwood]], "A tendency to think in generic terms of people, races&amp;nbsp;... is undoubtedly the profoundest flaw in mythological thinking."{{sfn|Ellwood|1999|p=x}}

===Functions of myth===
Campbell often described mythology as having a fourfold function within human society. These appear at the end of his work ''The Masks of God: Creative Mythology'', as well as various lectures.&lt;ref name="Campbell J. 1969"&gt;Campbell J. (1969) [http://www.jcf.org/new/index.php?categoryid=104&amp;p9999_action=displaylecturedetails&amp;p9999_svl=II11 Lectures II.1.1 The Function of Myth] (given at The Esalen Institute in August 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Metaphysical Function: ''Awakening a sense of awe before the mystery of being''
: According to Campbell, the absolute mystery of life, what he called transcendent reality, cannot be captured directly in words or images. Symbols and mythic metaphors on the other hand point outside themselves and into that reality. They are what Campbell called "being statements"&lt;ref name="Campbell J. 1969"/&gt; and their enactment through ritual can give to the participant a sense of that ultimate mystery as an experience. "Mythological symbols touch and exhilarate centers of life beyond the reach of reason and coercion.... The first function of mythology is to reconcile waking consciousness to the ''mysterium tremendum et fascinans'' of this universe ''as it is''."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell, ''The Masks of God, vol. 4: Creative Mythology'' (New York: Viking, 1965), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Cosmological Function: ''Explaining the shape of the universe''
: For pre-modern societies, myth also functioned as a ''proto-science'', offering explanations for the physical phenomena that surrounded and affected their lives, such as the change of seasons and the life cycles of animals and plants.

;The Sociological Function: ''Validate and support the existing social order''
: Ancient societies had to conform to an existing social order if they were to survive at all. This is because they evolved under "pressure" from necessities much more intense than the ones encountered in our modern world. Mythology confirmed that order and enforced it by reflecting it into the stories themselves, often describing how the order arrived from divine intervention. Campbell often referred to these "conformity" myths as the ''"Right Hand Path"'' to reflect the brain's left hemisphere's abilities for logic, order and linearity. Together with these myths however, he observed the existence of the ''"Left Hand Path"'', mythic patterns like the ''"Hero's Journey"'' which are revolutionary in character in that they demand from the individual a surpassing of social norms and sometimes even of morality.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell J. [1996] Mythos I: Psyche and Symbols (Joseph Campbell Foundation) {{YouTube|9ftFt1LnDzM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Pedagogical Function: ''Guide the individual through the stages of life''
: As a person goes through life, many psychological challenges will be encountered. Myth may serve as a guide for successful passage through the stages of one's life.

===Evolution of myth===
Campbell's view of mythology was by no means static and his books describe in detail how mythologies evolved through time, reflecting the realities in which each society had to adjust.{{efn|The schema laid out in the following text was one that Campbell explored in many of his works, including [[The Masks of God]] series; it was the explicit structure of his unfinished masterwork, [[The Historical Atlas of World Mythology]].}} Various stages of cultural development have different yet identifiable mythological systems. In brief these are:

;The Way of the Animal Powers: ''Hunting and gathering societies''
: At this stage of evolution religion was [[Animism|animistic]], as all of nature was seen as being infused with a spirit or divine presence. At center stage was the main hunting animal of that culture, whether the [[American bison|buffalo]] for Native Americans or the [[Common eland|eland]] for South African tribes, and a large part of religion focused on dealing with the psychological tension that came from the reality of the necessity to kill versus the divinity of the animal. This was done by presenting the animals as springing from an eternal archetypal source and coming to this world as ''willing victims'', with the understanding that their lives would be returned to the soil or to the Mother through a ritual of restoration.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell J. (1988) Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth. Interview by Bill Moyers. Episode 3: The first storytellers&lt;/ref&gt; The act of slaughter then becomes a ritual where both parties, animal and mankind, are equal participants. In ''[[Mythos (film)|Mythos]]'' and ''[[The Power of Myth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|UucgwRupTd4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell recounts the story he calls "The Buffalo's Wife" as told by the Blackfoot tribe of North America. The story tells of a time when the buffalos stopped coming to the hunting plains, leaving the tribe to starve. The chief's daughter promises to marry the buffalo chief in return for their reappearance, but is eventually spared and taught the buffalo dance by the animals themselves, through which the spirits of their dead will return to their eternal life source. Indeed, Campbell taught that throughout history mankind has held a belief that all life comes from and returns to another dimension which transcends temporality, but which can be reached through ritual.

;The Way of the Seeded Earth: ''Early agrarian societies''
: Beginning in the fertile grasslands of the [[Levant]] and the Fertile Crescent of Mesopotamia in the Bronze Age and moving to Europe, the practice of agriculture spread along with a new way of understanding mankind's relationship to the world. At this time the earth was seen as the Mother, and the myths focused around Her life-giving powers. The plant and cultivation cycle was mirrored in religious rituals which often included human sacrifice, symbolic or literal.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell J. (1988) The Way of the Seeded Earth, Part 1: The Sacrifice. Interview by Bill Moyers. Episode 3: The first storytellers&lt;/ref&gt; The main figures of this system were a female Great Goddess, Mother Earth, and her ever-dying and ever-resurrected son/consort, a male God. At this time the focus was to participate in the repetitive rhythm the world moved in expressed as the four seasons, the birth and death of crops and the phases of the moon. At the center of this motion was the Mother Goddess from whom all life springs and to whom all life returns. This often gave Her a dual aspect as both mother and destroyer.

;The Way of the Celestial Lights: ''The first high civilizations''
: As the first agricultural societies evolved into the high civilisations of [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Babylonia]], the observation of the stars inspired them with the idea that life on earth must also follow a similar mathematically predetermined pattern in which individual beings are but mere participants in an eternal cosmic play. The king was symbolised by the Sun with the golden crown as its main metaphor, while his court were the orbiting planets. The Mother Goddess remained, but her powers were now fixed within the rigid framework of a clockwork universe.
:However, two barbarian incursions changed that. As the Indo-European (Aryan) people descended from the north and the Semites swept up from the Arabian desert, they carried with them a male dominated mythology with a warrior god whose symbol was the thunder. As they conquered, mainly due to the superior technology of iron smithing, their mythology blended with and subjugated the previous system of the Earth Goddess. Many mythologies of the ancient world, such as those of Greece, India, and Persia, are a result of that fusion with gods retaining some of their original traits and character but now belonging to a single system. Figures such as [[Zeus]] and [[Indra]] are thunder gods who now interact with [[Demeter]] and [[Dionysus]], whose ritual sacrifice and rebirth, bearing testament to his pre-Indo-European roots, were still enacted in classical Greece. But for the most part, the focus heavily shifted toward the masculine, with Zeus ascending the throne of the gods and Dionysus demoted to a mere demi-god.
:This demotion was very profound in the case of the biblical imagery where the female elements were marginalized to an extreme. Campbell believed that Eve and the snake that tempted her were once fertility gods worshipped in their own right, with the tree of knowledge being the [[Tree of Life]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell J. (1964) The Masks of God, Vol. 3: Occidental Mythology&lt;/ref&gt; He also found significance in the biblical story of Cain and Abel, with Cain being a farmer whose agrarian offering is not accepted by God, while herder Abel's animal sacrifice is. In the lecture series of [[Mythos (film)|Mythos]], Campbell speaks of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries|Mysteries of Eleusis]] in Ancient Greece, where Demeter's journey in the underworld was enacted for young men and women of the time. There he observed that wheat was presented as the ultimate mystery with wine being a symbol of Dionysus, much like in the Christian mysteries where bread and wine are considered to incarnate the body and blood of Jesus. Both religions carry the same "seeded earth" cosmology in different forms while retaining an image of the ever-dying, ever-resurrected God.

;The Way of Man: ''Medieval mythology, romantic love, and the birth of the modern spirit''
: Campbell recognized that the poetic form of courtly love, carried through medieval Europe by the traveling troubadours, contained a complete mythology in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell J. (1988) Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth. Interview by Bill Moyers. Episode 5: Love and the Goddess&lt;/ref&gt; In'' The Power of Myth'' as well as the "Occidental Mythology" volume of ''The Masks of God'', Campbell describes the emergence of a new kind of erotic experience as a "person to person" affair, in contrast with the purely physical definition given to Eros in the ancient world and the communal agape found in the Christian religion. An archetypal story of this kind is the legend of [[Tristan and Isolde]] which, apart from its mystical function, shows the transition from an arranged-marriage society as practiced in the Middle Ages and sanctified by the church, into the form of marriage by "falling in love" with another person that we recognize today. So what essentially started from a mythological theme has since become a social reality, mainly due to a change in perception brought about by a new mythology—and represents a central foundational manifestation of Campbell's overriding interpretive message, "Follow your bliss."
:Campbell believed that in the modern world the function served by formal, traditional mythological systems has been taken on by individual creators such as artists and philosophers.{{efn|This is the central thesis of the last volume of [[The Masks of God]] series, ''Creative Mythology''.}} In the works of some of his favorites, such as [[Thomas Mann]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[James Joyce]], he saw mythological themes that could serve the same life-giving purpose that mythology had once played. Accordingly, Campbell believed the religions of the world to be the various culturally influenced "masks" of the same fundamental, transcendent truths. All religions can bring one to an elevated awareness above and beyond a dualistic conception of reality, or idea of "pairs of opposites" such as being and non-being, or right and wrong. Indeed, he quotes from the [[Rigveda]] in the preface to ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'': "Truth is one, the sages speak of it by many names."

==Influence==

===Joseph Campbell Foundation===
{{Main|Joseph Campbell Foundation}}
In 1991, Campbell's widow, choreographer [[Jean Erdman]], worked with Campbell's longtime friend and editor, [[Robert Walter (editor)|Robert Walter]], to create the Joseph Campbell Foundation.

Initiatives undertaken by the JCF include: ''The Collected Works of Joseph Campbell'', a series of books and recordings that aims to pull together Campbell's myriad-minded work; the Erdman Campbell Award; the Mythological RoundTables, a network of local groups around the globe that explore the subjects of comparative mythology, psychology, religion and culture; and the collection of Campbell's library and papers housed at the OPUS Archives and Research Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcf.org|title=Welcome to the Joseph Campbell Foundation Website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film and television===
[[George Lucas]] was the first Hollywood filmmaker to credit Campbell's influence. Lucas stated, following the release of the first [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'' film]] in 1977, that its story was shaped, in part, by ideas described in ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' and other works of Campbell's. The linkage between ''[[Star Wars]]'' and Campbell was further reinforced when later reprints of Campbell's book used the image of [[Luke Skywalker]] on the cover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/234.html Campbell, J.: The Hero with a Thousand Faces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908075820/http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/234.html|date=September 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas discusses this influence at great length in the authorized biography of Joseph Campbell, ''A Fire in the Mind'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I came to the conclusion after ''[[American Graffiti]]'' that what's valuable for me is to set standards, not to show people the world the way it is...around the period of this realization...it came to me that there really was no modern use of mythology...The [[Western (genre)|Western]] was possibly the last generically American [[fairy tale]], telling us about our values. And once the Western disappeared, nothing has ever taken its place. In literature we were going off into science fiction...so that's when I started doing more strenuous research on fairy tales, [[folklore]], and [[mythology]], and I started reading Joe's books. Before that I hadn't read any of Joe's books...It was very eerie because in reading ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'' I began to realize that my first draft of ''Star Wars'' was following classic motifs... So I modified my next draft [of ''Star Wars''] according to what I'd been learning about classical motifs and made it a little bit more consistent...I went on to read 'The Masks of God' and many other books.&lt;ref name=firemind/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was not until after the completion of the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy in 1983, however, that Lucas met Campbell or heard any of his lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.well-rounded.com/movies/reviews/lucas_intv.html|title=George Lucas Interview|last=Love|first=B.|date=1999|website=Well Rounded Entertainment|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120221951/http://www.well-rounded.com/movies/reviews/lucas_intv.html|archive-date=2008-11-20|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Campbell gave a lecture at the [[Palace of Fine Arts]] in San Francisco, with Lucas in the audience, who was introduced through their mutual friend [[Barbara McClintock]]. A few years later, Lucas invited Campbell to watch the entire ''Star Wars'' trilogy at [[Skywalker Ranch]], which Campbell called "real art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/mythic-discovery-within-the-inner-reaches-of-outer-space-joseph-campbell-meets-george-lucas-part-i|title=Mythic Discovery: Revisiting the Meeting between George Lucas and Joseph Campbell|website=StarWars.com|date=October 22, 2015|accessdate=October 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meeting led to the filming of the 1988 documentary ''[[The Power of Myth]]'' at Skywalker Ranch. In his interviews with [[Bill Moyers]], Campbell discusses the way in which Lucas used ''The Hero's Journey'' in the ''Star Wars'' films (IV, V, and VI) to re-invent the mythology for the contemporary viewer. Moyers and Lucas filmed an interview 12 years later in 1999 called the  ''Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas &amp; Bill Moyers'' to further discuss the impact of Campbell's work on Lucas' films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.films.com/id/11017/The_Mythology_of_Star_Wars_with_George_Lucas_and_Bill_Moyers.htm Films for the Humanities and Sciences—Educational Media—The Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas and Bill Moyers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103135453/http://films.com/id/11017/The_Mythology_of_Star_Wars_with_George_Lucas_and_Bill_Moyers.htm |date=January 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[National Air and Space Museum]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] sponsored an exhibit during the late 1990s called ''Star Wars: The Magic of Myth'', which discussed the ways in which Campbell's work shaped the ''Star Wars'' films.{{sfn|Henderson|1997}}

Many filmmakers of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries have acknowledged the influence of Campbell's work on their own craft. [[Christopher Vogler]], a Hollywood screenwriter, created a seven-page company memo based on Campbell's work, ''A Practical Guide to The Hero With a Thousand Faces'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021018061639/http://online.pacifica.edu/cgl/lucas Joseph Campbell and the Skywalker: Meetings with George Lucas], Pacifica Graduate Institute website; accessed August 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the development of [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s 1994 film ''[[The Lion King]]''. Among films that many viewers have recognized as closely following the pattern of the monomyth are ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'' series, the [[Batman in film|Batman]] series and the ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Classics/bcj/07-02.html James B. Grossman, Princeton University, "The Hero with Two Faces"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527062921/http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Classics/bcj/07-02.html|date=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Harmon]], the creator of the TV show ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'', often references Campbell as a major influence. According to him, he uses a "story circle" to formulate every story he writes, in a formulation of Campbell's work.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Rafferty, [https://www.wired.com/2011/09/mf_harmon/all/1 "How Dan Harmon Drives Himself Crazy Writing"], Wired Magazine, September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular literature===
After the explosion of popularity brought on by the ''Star Wars'' films and ''The Power of Myth'', creative artists in many media recognized the potential to use Campbell's theories to try to unlock human responses to narrative patterns. Novelists,{{sfn|Frey|2002}} songwriters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Prado |first=Ryan |date=February 3, 2009 |title=Repairing Broken Molds |url=http://submergemag.com/featured/repairing-broken-molds/549/ |website=Submerge |access-date=September 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Daly |first=Steven |year=1998 |title=Tori Amos: Her Secret Garden |url=http://www.thedent.com/rs062598.html |magazine=Rolling Stone |issue=789 |pages=38ff |access-date=September 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; video game designers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2007 |title=A Practical Guide to the Hero's Journey |url=http://www.gdcradio.net/2007/01/a_practical_guide_to_the_heros.html |website=GDC Radio |publisher=CMP Media |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210070012/http://www.gdcradio.net:80/2007/01/a_practical_guide_to_the_heros.html |archive-date=December 10, 2007 |access-date=September 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have studied Campbell's work in order to better understand mythology&amp;nbsp;– in particular, the [[monomyth]]&amp;nbsp;– and its impact.

The novelist [[Richard Adams]] acknowledges a debt to Campbell's work and specifically to the concept of the monomyth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Bridgman |first=Joan |year=2000 |title=Richard Adams at Eighty |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/RICHARD+ADAMS+AT+EIGHTY.-a064752236 |magazine=Contemporary Review |volume=277 |issue=1615 |page=110 |issn=0010-7565 |access-date=September 2, 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his best known work, ''[[Watership Down]]'', Adams uses extracts from ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' as chapter epigrams.{{sfn|Adams|2005|p=225}}

[[Dan Brown]] mentioned in a [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']] interview that Joseph Campbell's works, particularly ''The Power of Myth'' and ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'', inspired him to create the character of [[Robert Langdon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=June 20, 2013 |title=Dan Brown: By the Book |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/books/review/dan-brown-by-the-book.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=September 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Follow your bliss"===
One of Campbell's most identifiable, most quoted and arguably most misunderstood sayings was his admonition to "follow your bliss". He derived this idea from the [[Upanishads]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, I came to this idea of bliss because in Sanskrit, which is the great spiritual language of the world, there are three terms that represent the brink, the jumping-off place to the ocean of transcendence: [[Sat-Chit-Ananda]]. The word "Sat" means being. "Chit" means consciousness. "Ananda" means bliss or rapture. I thought, "I don't know whether my consciousness is proper consciousness or not; I don't know whether what I know of my being is my proper being or not; but I do know where my rapture is. So let me hang on to rapture, and that will bring me both my consciousness and my being." I think it worked.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth with Bill Moyers'', edited by Betty Sue Flowers. Doubleday and Co, 1988, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He saw this not merely as a mantra, but as a helpful guide to the individual along the hero journey that each of us walks through life:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If you follow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waiting for you, and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living. Wherever you are—if you are following your bliss, you are enjoying that refreshment, that life within you, all the time.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth with Bill Moyers'', edited by Betty Sue Flowers. Doubleday and Co., 1988. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Campbell began sharing this idea with students during his lectures in the 1970s. By the time that ''The Power of Myth'' was aired in 1988, six months following Campbell's death, "Follow your bliss" was a philosophy that resonated deeply with the American public—both religious and secular.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/10/nyregion/a-teacher-of-legends-becomes-one-himself.html|publisher=nytimes.com|title= Joseph Berger, "A Teacher of Legend Becomes One Himself", ''The New York Times'', December 10, 1988 |accessdate=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his later years, when some students took him to be encouraging [[hedonism]], Campbell is reported to have grumbled, "I should have said, 'Follow your ''blisters''.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hoxsey |first=Angela |date=December 5, 2014 |title=Follow Your Blisters |url=http://napavalleyregister.com/lifestyles/home-and-garden/columnists/angela-hoxsey/follow-your-blisters/article_a8057361-f35b-5036-ae40-a49cc0c1d81c.html |newspaper=Napa Valley Register |access-date=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Campbell's scholarship and understanding of Sanskrit has been questioned. [[Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson]], a former Sanskrit professor at the [[University of Toronto]], said that he once met Campbell, and that the two "hated each other at sight", commenting that, "When I met Campbell at a public gathering, he was quoting Sanskrit verses. He had no clue as to what he was talking about; he had the most superficial knowledge of India but he could use it for his own aggrandizement. I remember thinking: this man is corrupt. I know that he was simply ''lying'' about his understanding".&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Stephen, and Larsen, Robin. ''A Fire in the Mind: The Life of Joseph Campbell''. Doubleday, 1991, p. 510. (Ellipses from source.)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richard Buchen, librarian of the Joseph Campbell Collection at the Pacifica Graduate Institute, Campbell could not translate Sanskrit well. However, Buchen adds that Campbell worked closely with three scholars who did translate Sanskrit well.{{sfn|Buchen|2008|pp=363, 378}}

Ellwood observes that ''The Masks of God'' series "impressed literate laity more than specialists"; he quotes Stephen P. Dunn as remarking that in ''Occidental Mythology'' Campbell "writes in a curiously archaic style&amp;nbsp;– full of rhetorical questions, exclamations of wonder and delight, and expostulations directed at the reader, or perhaps at the author's other self&amp;nbsp;– which is charming about a third of the time and rather annoying the rest." Ellwood notes that "Campbell was not really a social scientist, and those in the latter camp could tell" and records a concern about Campbell's "oversimpification of historical matters and tendency to make myth mean whatever he wanted it to mean".{{sfn|Ellwood|1999|pp=131–132, 148, 153}} The critic [[Camille Paglia]], writing in ''[[Sexual Personae]]'' (1990), expressed disagreement with Campbell's "negative critique of fifth-century Athens" in ''Occidental Mythology'', arguing that Campbell missed the "visionary and exalted" androgyny in Greek statues of nude boys.{{sfn|Paglia|1991|pp=115–116}} Paglia has written that while Campbell is "a seminal figure for many American feminists", she loathes him for his "mawkishness and bad research." Paglia has called Campbell "mushy" and a "false teacher",{{sfn|Paglia|1992|pp=114, 241}} and described his work as a "fanciful, showy mishmash".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.salon.com/2009/11/11/pelosi_7/ | date= November 10, 2009 |title= Pelosi's Victory for Women| website= [[Salon.com]] | first= Camille | last= Paglia | accessdate= April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious studies scholar [[Russell T. McCutcheon]] characterized the "following [of] the bliss of self-realization" in Campbell's work as "spiritual and psychological legitimation" for [[Reaganomics]].{{sfn|McCutcheon|2001|p=45}}

Campbell has also been accused of [[antisemitism]] by some authors. [[Brendan Gill]], in an article published in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' in 1989, accused Campbell of both [[antisemitism]] and prejudice against blacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=After Death, a Writer Is Accused of Anti-Semitism|website=The New York Times|date=November 6, 1989|last=Bernstein|first=Richard|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/06/arts/after-death-a-writer-is-accused-of-anti-semitism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gill's article resulted in a series of letters to the editor, some supporting the charge of antisemitism or accusing Campbell of having various other right-wing biases, others defending him. However, [[Robert S. Ellwood|Robert Ellwood]] wrote that Gill relied on "scraps of evidence, largely anecdotal" to support his charges against Campbell.{{sfn|Ellwood|1999|pp=131–132, 148, 153}} Masson accused Campbell of "hidden anti-Semitism" and "fascination with conservative, semifascistic views".{{sfn|Masson|1991|p=206}} Contrarily, the "fascist undercurrents" in Campbell's work and especially its influence on ''Star Wars'' have been called "a reminder of how easily totalitarianism can knock at any society's door."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/star-wars--a-new-hope/movies-influences-george-lucas/|title=10 films that influenced Star Wars|last=Robey|first=Tim|date=December 14, 2015|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=October 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works by Campbell==

===Early collaborations===
{{Main|A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake}}
The first published work that bore Campbell's name was ''Where the Two Came to Their Father'' (1943), an account of a [[Navajo people|Navajo]] ceremony that was performed by singer ([[medicine man]]) [[Jeff King (Navajo)|Jeff King]] and recorded by artist and [[ethnologist]] [[Maud Oakes]], recounting the story of two young heroes who go to the [[hogan]] of their father, the Sun, and return with the power to destroy the monsters that are plaguing their people. Campbell provided a commentary. He would use this tale through the rest of his career to illustrate both the universal symbols and structures of human myths and the particulars ("folk ideas") of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] stories.

As noted above, [[James Joyce]] was an important influence on Campbell. Campbell's first important book (with [[Henry Morton Robinson]]), ''[[A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake]]'' (1944), is a critical analysis of Joyce's final text ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''. In addition, Campbell's seminal work, ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949), discusses what Campbell called the ''[[monomyth]]''&amp;nbsp;– the cycle of the journey of the [[hero]]&amp;nbsp;– a term that he borrowed directly from Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.{{sfn|Campbell|1949|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;30, n.&amp;nbsp;35}}

===''The Hero with a Thousand Faces''===
{{Main|The Hero with a Thousand Faces}}
From his days in college through the 1940s, Joseph Campbell turned his hand to writing fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen and Larsen, op. cit., pp. 96–211, passim.&lt;/ref&gt; In many of his later stories (published in the posthumous collection ''Mythic Imagination'') he began to explore the mythological themes that he was discussing in his Sarah Lawrence classes. These ideas turned him eventually from fiction to non-fiction.

Originally titled ''How to Read a Myth'', and based on the introductory class on mythology that he had been teaching at [[Sarah Lawrence College]], ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' was published in 1949 as Campbell's first foray as a solo author; it established his name outside of scholarly circles and remains, arguably, his most influential work to this day. The book argues that [[hero]] stories such as [[Krishna]], [[Buddha]], [[Apollonius of Tyana]], and Jesus all share a similar mythological basis.{{sfn|Bennett|2001|p=206}} Not only did it introduce the concept of the [[monomyth|hero's journey]] to popular thinking, but it also began to popularize the very idea of [[comparative mythology]] itself—the study of the human impulse to create stories and images that, though they are clothed in the [[motif (narrative)|motif]]s of a particular time and place, draw nonetheless on universal, eternal [[theme (literature)|theme]]s. Campbell asserted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wherever the poetry of myth is interpreted as biography, history, or science, it is killed. The living images become only remote facts of a distant time or sky. Furthermore, it is never difficult to demonstrate that as science and history, mythology is absurd. When a civilization begins to reinterpret its mythology in this way, the life goes out of it, temples become museums, and the link between the two perspectives becomes dissolved.{{sfn|Campbell|1993|p=249}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''The Masks of God''===
Published between 1959 and 1968, Campbell's four-volume work ''The Masks of God'' covers mythology from around the world, from ancient to modern. Where ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' focused on the commonality of mythology (the "elementary ideas"), the '' Masks of God'' books focus upon historical and cultural variations the monomyth takes on (the "folk ideas"). In other words, where ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'' draws perhaps more from psychology, the '' Masks of God'' books draw more from anthropology and history. The four volumes of ''Masks of God'' are as follows: ''Primitive Mythology'', ''Oriental Mythology'', ''Occidental Mythology'', and ''[[Creative Mythology]]''.

The book is quoted by proponents of the [[Christ myth theory]]. Campbell writes, "It is clear that, whether accurate or not as to biographical detail, the moving legend of the Crucified and Risen Christ was fit to bring a new warmth, immediacy, and humanity, to the old motifs of the beloved [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Adonis]], and [[Osiris]] cycles."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell. ''The Masks of God: Occidental Mythology'' Penguin, reprinted, {{ISBN|0140043063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Historical Atlas of World Mythology''===
{{Main|Historical Atlas of World Mythology}}
At the time of his death, Campbell was in the midst of working upon a large-format, lavishly illustrated series entitled ''Historical Atlas of World Mythology''. This series was to build on Campbell's idea, first presented in ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'', that myth evolves over time through four stages:
*''The Way of the Animal Powers''—the myths of [[Paleolithic]] hunter-gatherers which focus on shamanism and animal totems.
*''The Way of the Seeded Earth''—the myths of [[Neolithic]], agrarian cultures which focus upon a mother goddess and associated fertility rites.
*''The Way of the Celestial Lights''—the myths of [[Bronze Age]] city-states with pantheons of gods ruling from the heavens, led by a masculine god-king.
*''The Way of Man''—religion and philosophy as it developed after the [[Axial Age]] (c. 6th century BC), in which the mythic imagery of previous eras was made consciously metaphorical, reinterpreted as referring to psycho-spiritual, not literal-historical, matters. This transition is evident in the East in [[Buddhism]], [[Vedanta]], and philosophical [[Taoism]]; and in the West in the [[Mystery cult]]s, [[Platonism]], Christianity and [[Gnosticism]].

Only the first volume was completed at the time of Campbell's death. Campbell's editor Robert Walter completed the publication of the first three of five parts of the second volume after Campbell's death. The works are now out of print. {{as of|2014}}, Joseph Campbell Foundation is currently undertaking to create a new, ebook edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jcf.org/atlas Historical Atlas of World Mythology, Digital Edition], as viewed on Joseph Campbell Foundation website, July 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Power of Myth''===
{{Main|The Power of Myth}}
Campbell's widest popular recognition followed his collaboration with [[Bill Moyers]] on the [[PBS]] series ''[[The Power of Myth]]'', which was first broadcast in 1988, the year following Campbell's death. The series discusses mythological, religious, and psychological archetypes. A book, ''The Power of Myth'', containing expanded transcripts of their conversations, was released shortly after the original broadcast.

===''Collected Works''===
The ''Collected Works of Joseph Campbell'' series is a project initiated by the [[Joseph Campbell Foundation]] to release new, authoritative editions of Campbell's published and unpublished writing, as well as audio and video recordings of his lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=December 7, 2001 |title=Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor (Spirituality) |newspaper=National Catholic Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with [[New World Library]] and [[Acorn Media UK]], as well as publishing audio recordings and [[ebook]]s under its own banner, {{as of|2014|lc=y}} the project has produced over seventy-five titles. The series's executive editor is [[Robert Walter (editor)|Robert Walter]], and the managing editor is [[David Kudler]].

'''''Ma's Illustrated Catalogue of the Stamps of China''''' (國郵 [http://www.cidianwang.com/shufa/9451.htm 啚] 鑑) or ( (國郵圖鑑) is a specialized catalogue of earlier Chinese stamps covering the periods from the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]] to the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]]. It provides the most comprehensive and systematic record of every stamp from the first Customs issue of 1878 to the Dah Tung print Postage Due stamp in 1947. ''Ma's Illustrated Catalogue'' differs from other stamp catalogues as it goes beyond a simple listing of stamps. ''Ma's catalogue'' provides a wealth of philately related information of high historical significance that is much needed in the research and study of early Chinese stamps. Today many refer to this catalogue as simply "馬氏圖鑑" or "馬氏國郵圖鑑".

The first edition was primarily sourced from hand written manuscripts edited by the late Ma Zung-Sung (馬潤叟  1872-1945). His son, Ma Ren-Chuen ([http://www.baike.com/wiki/%25E9%25A9%25AC%25E4%25BB%25BB%25E5%2585%25A8 馬任全] 1908-1988), already a postal expert in Chinese stamps and like his father a [[philatelists|philatelist]], was inspired by his father's unfinished wish to put together a comprehensive catalogue during the last four years of his life. After his father's death in 1945,  and after extensive consultation with a number of Shanghai's authoritative philatelic experts and philatelic literature collectors, he compiled and supplemented his father's original manuscripts and then translated the entire work from [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]] to English. The first edition was published with 661 black &amp; white illustrations. The costs for typesetting, proofreading, printing, publishing, and distributing were self-funded by Ma alone.  A small quantity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Printed in low quantities|url=https://read.jd.com/13770/656063.html|website=read.jd.com|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 1000 copies was printed by Shun Chang &amp; Co. (順昌),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Cat|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/ma-shi-guo-you-tu-jian-mas-illustrated-catalogue-of-the-stamps-of-china/oclc/268786848?referer=di&amp;ht=edition|website=Worldcat.org|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Shanghai]], China in June 1947 (民國三十六年). For many years the catalogue was the most inclusive stamp catalogue ever published in China, and it was
the first and the only one printed in both Chinese and English texts together in one volume and exclusively published by a Chinese person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=馬任全先生與《國郵圖鑑》的前世今生|url=http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_3e5319690100cd00.html|website=Blog.sina.com|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stamp catalogues prior to Ma's were all available only in English and were printed overseas by foreign stamp dealers, often including incomplete or contradicting information among the various catalogues. The catalogue had made it possible for universal sharing and education of early Chinese stamps by all collectors in China or overseas.

== First Edition ==

When first published the catalogue was regarded as a considerable expense. There was no set retail price as this was unnecessary for a self-published and privately sold book. The book was sold at the office of the printing house. A full page advertisement on the back cover of the November 1947 issue of ''The New Light Philatelic Magazine'', Vol 14, No. 2 (《新光郵票雜誌》民國三十六年十一月十四卷第二期) listed the retail price of the catalogue as 500,000 yuan in National Currency. To put this price into perspective, the highest bank note denomination in 1947 was a 10,000 yuan note, the magazine where the advertisement appeared was sold for 10,000 yuan a copy, and the price for placing the full page advertisement was 2,400,000 yuan. In other words, if the magazine was sold for $10 a copy, a fair market price in 2016, then the catalogue would have been sold at an equivalent of $500, which was considered by many to be a substantial amount of money.

=== How to confirm a first edition ===
The first edition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ma|first1=Ren-Chuen|title=國郵圖鑑|date=June 1947|publisher=Shun Chang &amp; Co.|location=Shanghai, China|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a scarlet colour hardcover with gilt lettering in both Traditional Chinese (馬潤叟遺著，馬任全譯纂 written vertically) and English (written horizontally) on the front cover. A small horse emblem ("馬圖", pronounced "Ma" in Chinese, the editor's last name, mainly used for anti-counterfeiting) is embossed at the centre of the back cover. The front and back covers are further embossed with wrinkle like patterns such as those found on the palm of a hand, except within the area of the horse emblem. The number 1947 is located right below the book title frame. Every authentic copy has a distinct serial number&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Original copies printed|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/11708281.htm|accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (out of 1000) stamped in black ink on the endpaper opposite the back cover. The pages are bound together, using the "Sewing Through the Fold" method, with four binding threads visible. It has 568 pages.  The book measures 14mm x 19.5mm. The paper used is an advanced and costly paper called Art Paper (銅版紙), often referred as Coated Printing Paper (塗佈印刷紙), or Coated Paper (粉紙). The paper is coated with a thin clay to give it a more prestigious feel and elegant look. The prints can be felt when running one's fingers over the page.  The pages are uncut, and lie flat when the book is opened. There is no dust jacket issued with this book.

The cost for the paper and for the printing material are primary factors for the extremely high retail price.

=== Unauthorized Reprints ===
The first edition proved to be extremely popular and was quickly regarded by many to be the Bible of China Philately. On account of the very low initial production, a retail price not affordable by most collectors, and the lack of official second printings or updated editions for the next 40+ years, many unauthorized copies were produced in Hong Kong,&lt;ref&gt;Written correspondence with Ma You Zhang, son of the editor. January 9th, 2017. Special thanks to Mr. 马佑章、and Mr. 张钧 for their support and assistance in making this correspondence possible.&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan, and Japan and sold worldwide well into the 1980s. While the author was well aware of the outright stealing of his work, he was neither compensated, nor have the ability to enforce a stop to the copying due to China's political environment at the time and its isolation from the rest of the world, which both had immense affect and influence on publication and copyright laws.&lt;ref&gt;Written correspondence with Ma You Zhang, January 09, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In a written correspondence with Mr. Ma You Zhang (see third edition) dated January 9, 2017, he wrote, "1949，10，1 新中国成立以后，不断的政治运动对出版事业造成很大的影响，如不了解这段社会政治历史，无法解释与出版有关的法律与实践。". And because the reprints were purposely made to look like the original work, the reprint books themselves do not say that they are reprints. In fact, the publication date of June 1947 on the title page and July 1947 on the copyright page both remain unchanged in those books printed at a much later date. The original first edition and the unauthorized reprints may be distinguished by the following descriptions and distinct features.

=== Ma's Numbering System ===
To catalogue early Chinese stamps is complicated. The first postage stamps in China were, in fact, issued by the western nations occupying special concessions, known as '[[Treaty ports|Treaty Ports]]', which had been snatched from Imperial China by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ebay.com.au/gds/Buying-Collectable-Chinese-Postage-Stamps-on-Ebay-/10000000001085006/g.html&lt;/ref&gt; The first Treaty Ports stamp was issued in 1865 by the Shanghai Municipal Post, with additional Local Posts followed in sixteen other Treaty Ports. The postal services were taken over by the Qing government in November 1897 after it established the Imperial Chinese Post. After the overthrow of the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]] in 1911, central authority was broken apart. During the period of the Republic of China (1912 - 1949), ongoing conflict between the [[Beiyang government]], the Nationalist's Guomindang government, the Communist party (about 1930 - 1949), the remnant Northern [[Warlord Era|warlords]] government, and the [[Empire of Japan]] all further fragmented China's postal system. Without a unified central government, the semi-autonomous regional governments issued their own stamps at various times to meet postal needs; Japan had issued "Occupation" stamps through their puppet governments, and the Chinese Communist Party had issued "Liberated area" stamps. The designation "Liberated Areas" refers to areas the Communists "liberated" from the Nationalists and / or the Japanese. The Liberated Areas alone already issued an estimated more than 500 sets of stamps with over 2,300 values. As these stamps are printed under war conditions, done mostly underground, and most of the stamps are coarsely printed using the simplest printing techniques on sub-standard equipment, and made use of any raw material available at the time.  In fact, the first stamps issued by the new Nationalist government simply utilized remaining stocks of Imperial stamps, overprinting them with the words, 'Republic of China' until they could print new stamps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ebay.com.au/gds/Buying-Collectable-Chinese-Postage-Stamps-on-Ebay-/10000000001085006/g.html&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the Liberated Areas, co-existing provisional governments also find themselves difficult to unify their monetary system with the central authority of the time. Disparities and devaluation of local currencies from the ever-changing National Currency (oftentimes value had to be recalculated in a matter of hours) only promoted speculation on stamps. Such complicating factors demanded an unusual varieties of overprints (to restrict their use in a designated region so to stop speculators from profiting) or surcharging (charging extra money in National currency to make up for the difference in value). Moreover, as the central printing is done in Beijing or by externally contracted printers, the stamps are often delayed and rendering the value printed on the stamps useless. At times of an urgent need for postage stamps quickly, stocks of old issue stamps are simply overprinted by the local Post Masters, which often resulted in minor differences in design and colour variations occurring between official printers. After such a long period of complicated factors, coupled with other secret markings and numerous printing errors in between had all made it very difficult to distinguish and to document every early Chinese stamp, comprehensively or by chronological order alone.

In all, there are five main issuers of early Chinese stamps - Treaty Ports, Qing Dynasty, Republic of China, Japanese occupation, and Liberated areas. Ma's Illustrated Catalogue focused on stamps officially issued by the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China, along with relevant provincial issues, Air Mail stamps, and Postage Due stamps issued during the same period.

Ma's first edition catalogue listed stamps under a numbering system now universally recognized as the Ma's catalogue number (馬氏編號). Numbers without a preceding letter are regular issues of the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China. An Alphabet Letter preceding a stamp number denotes special purpose stamps or territorial stamps such as Provincial Overprints, Air Mail stamps, and Postage Due stamps. Letters following the stamp number are stamp errors and other special varieties.

=== Other noted features of the first edition ===

The first edition neither provides a table of contents nor an index.

The catalogue does not provide coverage for Military stamps, postcards, aerogramme, and stamps issued by treaty ports, colonial outposts, revolutionary base, and liberated areas.

Although the catalogue is printed in both Chinese and English text together, the material presented are not formal equivalent in nature and should not be regarded as a word-for-word translation.

Diagrams of overprints and special markings are not photo extrapolation from actual stamps, rather they are hand-drawn diagrams where the actual location or the size of some letters may not correspond exactly to an actual stamp.

Regular Issues of the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]] and the Republic of China are listed in chronological order. A total of 1115 varieties are recorded.

Provincial Overprint Issues, Air Mail stamps, and Postage Due stamps are grouped by province, then by stamp issue, then by special printing varieties such as printer name and special watermark. This section recorded over 1992 varieties.

Detailed issuing history, features, and variations including the date of issue, denomination, origin of the paper, quality of paper, quality of gum, printer's name, watermark, colour, ink, perforation, number of panes per sheet, number of stamps per sheet and how they are positioned, and how many lots had been issued, are noted within.

In the first edition the stamp prices quoted are in "Stamp Units", a reference value not tied to a particular currency. It is useful only for indicating the relative degree of rarity/value from one stamp to another, and should not be interpreted as an actual dollar amount. Since this book does not get updated on a frequent basis like other annually published stamp catalogues, there is an advantage to the "Stamp Units" style of pricing. Unfortunately it is not useful for anyone trying to price their collection with the most current street value. In subsequent editions the currency of the publisher country is used as a base for representing local value in order to be more useful to local collectors.

Prices for plate blocks are provided in the first edition. These prices are removed in subsequent editions.

The Chinese text portion refers to dates prior to 1912 by the [[List of rulers of China|Chinese Era Name]] (the last emperor officially abdicated on February 12, 1912), after 1912 by the [[Minguo calendar|Minguo Calendar]], while the English text uses the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian Calendar]].

== Second Edition ==

The 1988 revised and supplemented second edition was also edited by Ma Ren-Chuen. It was the first revision and update of the original catalogue since its publication 40 years earlier, and which Ma had decided to publish separate Chinese and English editions of the catalogue. The Chinese version of the catalogue was finished by 1983 and was sent to 中國集郵出版社 for publication. However, by 1985 the new edition was still not published. After much inquiries by his family and colleagues, they found the reason for the delay was partly due to the inclusion of some politically sensitive commemorative stamps issued near the final years of the Republic of China which at the time were deemed to be the "enemies of the people" and deemed inappropriate for publication by the 中國集郵出版社. Unfortunately the inclusion of such stamps was unavoidable for attaining comprehensive information on stamps issued in that period. Finally another printing house, Shanghai Cultural Press, 上海文化出版社, in early 1986 agreed to take on the printing of the Chinese text version. After this happy news Ma immediately began translating the entire work to English for the English publication.

Ma was then in the last years of his life and had been diagnosed with lung cancer in early 1987. Knowing that the translation work might never be completed if he were to stop, he asked to postpone all surgeries necessary for removing his cancer tumour and only to remain on mild medication for his cancer treatment in order to continue his work on finishing the catalogue while at the hospital. His son Ma Youzhang in an article published in the January 1989 edition of China Philately paying tribute to his late father accounted for how his father while updating the English manuscripts of the catalogue would secretly return home from the hospital when his work required it. Ma's determination to finish the catalogue while he was still alive never left him. The English revision was finally completed by the end of 1987 and was sent to Lee H. Hill Jr. for publication in the USA under Hill-Donnelly Corporation, and appointing Lee as his representative with full powers to find a publisher to publish the new catalogue. Lee H. Hill Jr., who now operated a publishing house, is an old acquaintance of Ma, whom he met while on a business trip to the United States back in 1947. While Lee H. Hill took only four months to edit and typeset the manuscripts and promised the book would be published by the end of July, and he would send the first copy to Ma by express mail. Ma Ren Chuen passed away on July 15, 1988, and he never saw the second editions, in English or Chinese, in book-form.

The catalogue had been expanded to cover all the Republic of China issues through the Silver Yuan issues of 1949, Military Post, Stamp Booklets, and stamps issued while under Japanese Occupation and the British Railway Administration. Also added were new date and quantity of issue information, additional pictures showing the stamp varieties within the same issue, and hand-drawn illustrations showing intricate details for identifying them.

=== English Text ===

The English text version is soft-bound, with gold lettering on a blue cover. The location of the date 1947 first printed on the first edition has been updated to read 1988. The Ma's reference numbering system follows that of the original 1947 edition. Newly added is a Table of Contents and a cross-reference table of "Modern" vs. "Traditional" spellings (for example, "Beijing" vs. "Peking"). The number of black &amp; white pictures and illustrations was expanded from 661 in the first edition to 1132. The total number of pages is 788. Market prices have been updated to US dollars but are still expressed in "Stamp Units" indicating the relative scarcity and value of each stamp. The retail price was $46.50 (US) that included delivery to the US or Canada, and $49.50 (US) for delivery to Europe.

The Chinese version is renamed Zhongguo you piao tu jian 1878-1949 "中国邮票图鉴(1878 －1949)" written in Simplified Chinese. In fact the entire catalogue has been rewritten in Simplified Chinese. The first printing is dated December 1988 and is printed in China by Shanghai Culture Publishing House  [http://baike.baidu.com/view/4913707.htm 上海文化出版社]. The book is hard-bound, with gold letters on a green colour cover.  It comes with a gold/white colour book jacket and black &amp; gold lettering.

Stamp categories covered in this edition include: Qing Dynasty, Republic of China, Air Mail, Postage Due, Military, and stamp booklets.

A table of contents was added, as well as updates of stamp release dates, quantity printed, pictures, places where stamps were first sold, secret markings, etc.

Market prices have been updated to 1987 values and are expressed in Renminbi for the ease of reference by Chinese Nationals.

Due to Ma's poor health and his desire to personally witness his book's publication, numerous typesetting related errors were only discovered after the catalogue was printed and sold. In total 169 errors were documented by his eldest son, 馬延璋, who published an error reference guide (勘誤表) in October 1989 and originally provided only to members of The New Light Philatelic (新光郵票會會員) as a supplement to the catalogue. This guide is reprinted in the September 2006 Philatelic Publication 集郵文獻擷英 2006年9月出版的彩二期(總第5期).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Error reference guide|url=http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_3e5319690100cd00.html|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such error is noted on the book cover and cover jacket where the year of stamp coverage 1897-1949 is misprinted and thus is incorrect. The date "1897-1949" only appears on the first edition covers and subsequent editions have this error corrected to read 1878-1949.

The first printing of 4,000 copies retails for 16.50 Renminbi. The second printing of 10,000 copies is dated April 1989 and retails for 21.50 Renminbi. The third printing of 3,000 copies is dated May 1992 and retails for 21.50 Renminbi. The total number of pages is 490.

== 1995 Lee H. Hill Jr. Edition ==

The 1995 edition is edited by Lee H. Hill Jr. and published by Hill-Donnelly Corporation in Tampa, FL, USA. This edition is printed in English text only and covers the earliest, the most valuable, and often most difficult to decipher stamp issues from 1878-1911 with enhanced illustrations, detailed descriptions, and specific identification techniques unique to each stamp issue.  A total of 138 digitally scanned images of actual stamps are printed in black &amp; white throughout the 202 pages on 8.5 X 11 papers. The book is soft-bound, with gold letters on a blue cover. The additional title "Volume 1 - Empire 1878-1911" is added, as well as an update to the publication date of 1995 on the front cover.

== 1998 Lee H. Hill Jr. Edition ==

The 1998 edition is edited by Lee H. Hill Jr. and published by Hill-Donnelly Corporation in Tampa, FL, USA. This version is supplemented from the 1988 edition with additional enhancements and updated to 1998 prices in US dollars. The book is soft-bound, 558 pages, 8.5 X 11 papers, with gold letters on a blue cover.

== Third Edition ==

After five years of work in 2009 the third edition was revised and published by Ma You Zhang ([http://baike.baidu.com/view/8425702.htm 馬佑璋], b. Nov. 1939), the son of the late editor Ma Ren-Chuen and the grandson of the original editor Ma Zung-Sung, and the younger brother of 馬延璋 who published the error reference guide for the second edition. The title of the third edition has been updated to 中國郵票圖鑑 1878 －1949 (Zhong guo you piao tu jian) written in Simplified Chinese. The first printing of this edition was December 2009 by [http://www.book-wind.com 冮苏人民出版社].

Besides the preface and a table of contents presented in English, all other sections of this book are written in Chinese.

This edition now covers all Chinese stamp issues from the very first Qin Dynasty issue of the "Customs Post Large Dragon" to the final Republic of China "Silver Yuan" issue in 1949 (up until the founding of the People's Republic of China), as well as Provincial Issues, Special Purpose Issues (Airmail, Postage Due, Military Post, Stamp Booklets), and Occupied Area Issues (British Railway Administration, Japanese Occupation, Shandong and Hbei Overprints, Northern China, Central China, Southern China, and Manchukuo issues).

Updates are included for any new variation types discovered since the previous edition, including revisions to some historical information of each stamp issue, ways to decipher the different varieties, corrections of some misprints, and revised market prices, which have been updated to 2009 values and are expressed in Renminbi for the ease of reference by Chinese Nationals. Prices for blocks have been removed.

The original Ma's numbering reference system is unchanged and follows that of the 1988 Chinese edition. Both Custom Post and Republic of China issues are identified by a reference number only. Starting with the Provincial Issues, stamp numbers are preceded by one or two Chinese characters to denote the primary variety, followed by a numeric number. For example, "華北 1003" is designated for stamp variety 1003 in the Northern China Issues.

Both the names of Ma Ren-Chuen (editor) and Ma Zubg-Sung (Supplemented) appear on the cover. The total number of pages is 470. The total number of illustrations is 1135. Paper used is coated paper.

Pictures of stamps and related illustrations remain printed in black and white only.

There is a marked difference in the way some descriptions are written between the first edition and third edition. For example, colours written in the order of the variant colour followed by the base primary colour in the first edition are now written in reversed order: 藍綠與黑 and 紅與黑 (1947) vs. 黑與藍綠 and 黑與紅 (2009).

There are two versions, a collector edition and a regular hardcover edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_49b252ba0100htrt.html|title=新版马任全《中国邮票图鉴》珍藏版与精装本的版式对比|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collector Presentation Edition ===

This edition is hard-bound. The cover has gold letters on a red cover. Only 100 copies were printed and it is not for sale.  This edition is reserved as commemorative gifts from Ma Zubg-Sung, with his autograph and chop stamped on the inside cover. Similar to the first edition, for the purpose of anti-counterfeiting, a small horse emblem ("馬圖", pronounced "Ma" in Chinese, the editor's last name) is engraved at the centre of the back cover. Each book is printed with a serial number from 1 to 100. "Collector Edition (珍藏版)" is noted below the {{ISBN|978-7-214-05403-6}}.

=== Hardcover Edition ===

This edition is also hard-bound, but the cover has gold letters written on a green background. Officially there is a horse-emblem engraved on the back cover, however, a sample of an error variety has been found without such a horse emblem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Book printing error|url=http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_49b252ba0100huvp.html|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has the same ISBN as the red cover version, but instead of "Collector Edition (珍藏版)" noted below the ISBN, a retail price of 98.00 Renminbi Yuan (精裝) is printed instead.

'''Mate''' ({{IPA-es|ˈmate|lang}}, {{IPA-pt|ˈmatʃi|lang}}; sometimes spelled '''maté''' in English though [[Yerba mate#Nomenclature|not in Spanish or Portuguese]]),&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/mate-beverage|title=Mate - beverage|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''chimarrão''' ({{IPA-pt|ʃimɐˈʁɐ̃w̃|lang}}) or '''''cimarrón''''' ({{IPA-es|simaˈron|lang}}), is a traditional South American [[caffeine]]-rich [[infusion|infused drink]], that was first consumed by the [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] and also spread by the [[Tupí people]]. In the last centuries, it became particularly popular in Argentina &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/215000-219999/218040/norma.htm|title=Ley 26.871 - Declárase al Mate como infusión nacional.|work=InfoLEG|publisher=[[Minister of Economy of Argentina|Ministry of Economy and Public Finance]]|accessdate=7 October 2010|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Uruguay, as also in Paraguay, the Bolivian [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]], [[Southern Chile]] and [[Southern Brazil]]. It is also consumed in Syria, the largest importer in the world, and in Lebanon.&lt;ref name="donald"&gt;{{cite book|title=Medical Toxicology of Drug Abuse: Synthesized Chemicals and Psychoactive Plants| last= Barceloux| first= Donald| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=1-11810-605-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Middle East Online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=64763|title=South American 'mate' tea a long-time Lebanese hit|publisher=Middle East Online|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is prepared by steeping dried leaves of [[yerba mate]] (''Ilex paraguariensis'', known in Portuguese as ''erva-mate'') in hot water and is served with a metal straw from a shared hollow [[calabash]] [[gourd]]. The straw is called a ''[[bombilla]]'' in Spanish, a ''bomba'' in Portuguese, and a ''bombija'' or, more generally, a ''masassa'' (straw) in Arabic. The straw is traditionally made of [[silver]]. Modern, commercially available straws are typically made of [[nickel silver]] (called ''alpaca''), [[stainless steel]], or hollow-stemmed cane. The gourd is known as a ''mate'' or a ''guampa''; while in Brazil, it has the specific name of ''cuia'', or also ''cabaça'' (the name for Indigenous-influenced calabash gourds in other regions of Brazil, still used for general food and drink in remote regions). Even if the water is supplied from a modern thermos, the infusion is traditionally drunk from ''mates'' or ''cuias''.

The mate leaves are dried, chopped, and ground into a powdery mixture called ''yerba'', "erva" in Portuguese, which means "herb". The bombilla functions as both a straw and a sieve. The submerged end is flared, with small holes or slots that allow the brewed liquid in, but block the chunky matter that makes up much of the mixture. A modern bombilla design uses a straight tube with holes, or a spring sleeve to act as a sieve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Anne | last = Goodfriend | title = Yerba maté: The accent is on popular health drink | url = https://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2006-03-02-yerba-mate_x.htm | work=USA Today | page = 1 | date = 2006-03-02 | accessdate = 2011-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tea-bag" type infusions of mate (Spanish: ''[[mate cocido]]'', Portuguese: ''chá mate'') have been on the market in many South American countries for many years under such trade names as "Taragüi" in Argentina, "Pajarito" and "Kurupí" in Paraguay, and [[Matte Leão]] and "Mate Real" in Brazil.

== History ==
{{main|History of yerba mate}}

[[File:Dr francia.JPG|right|thumb|upright=.8|Lithograph of [[José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia]], a 19th-century ruler of Paraguay, with a mate and its ''bombilla'']]

Mate was first consumed by the indigenous [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] and also spread by the [[Tupí people]] who lived in that part of southern Brazil and northeast Argentina, including some areas that were Paraguayan territory before the [[Paraguayan War]]. Therefore, the scientific name of the yerba mate is ''Ilex paraguariensis''. The consumption of yerba mate became widespread with the European colonization in the Spanish colony of Paraguay in the late 16th century, among both Spanish settlers and indigenous Guaraní, who consumed it before the Spanish arrival. Mate consumption spread in the 17th century to the [[Río de la Plata]] and from there to Chile. This widespread consumption turned it into Paraguay's main [[commodity]] above other wares such as tobacco, cotton and beef. Aboriginal labour was used to harvest wild stands. In the mid-17th century, Jesuits managed to domesticate the plant and establish plantations in [[Jesuit Reductions|their Indian reductions]] in the Paraguayan department of [[Misiones]], sparking severe competition with the Paraguayan harvesters of wild strands. After [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|their expulsion]] in the 1770s, the Jesuit missions — along with the yerba mate plantations — fell into ruins. The industry continued to be of prime importance for the Paraguayan economy after independence, but development in benefit of the Paraguayan state halted after the [[Paraguayan War]] (1864–1870) that devastated the country both economically and demographically.

Brazil then became the largest producer of mate. In Brazilian and Argentine projects in late 19th and early 20th centuries, the plant was domesticated once again, opening the way for plantation systems. When Brazilian entrepreneurs turned their attention to coffee in the 1930s, Argentina, which had long been the prime consumer, took over as the largest producer, resurrecting the economy of [[Misiones Province]], where the Jesuits had once had most of their plantations. For years, the status of largest producer shifted between Brazil and Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Mate|url=http://comex.lasmarias.com.ar/eng/detalle.php?a=yerba-mate-tea&amp;t=3&amp;d=1|publisher=Establecimiento Las Marías|accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Argentina is the largest producer with 56–62%, followed by Brazil, 34–36%, and Paraguay, 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://segundoenfoque.com/la-produccion-yerba-mate-argentina-registro-record-historico-2018-02-09|title=segundoenfoque|last=|first=|date=|website=|archiveurl=http://segundoenfoque.com/la-produccion-yerba-mate-argentina-registro-record-historico-2018-02-09|archivedate=July 13, 2018|deadurl=|accessdate=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uruguay is the largest consumer per capita, consuming around 19 liters per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.euromonitor.com/2016/10/as-consumption-stagnates-in-south-america-will-yerba-mate-move-north.html|title=As Consumption Stagnates in South America, will Yerba Mate Move North?|date=19 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==

Both the spellings "mate" and "maté" are used in English.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged'', 2002, shows the main entry for the word as '''ma·té''' ''or'' '''ma·te'''. The explanatory material for main entries on page 14a, headed 1.71, says "When a main entry is followed by the word ''or'' and another spelling or form, the two spellings or forms are equal variants. Their order is usually alphabetical, and the first is no more to be preferred than the second..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; An [[acute accent]] is not used in the Spanish spelling, because it would incorrectly indicate that the second syllable is stressed; an accent on the "e" sometimes seen in English is used to indicate that the word and its pronunciation are distinct from the English word "[[wikt:mate|mate]]". As the Yerba Mate Association of the Americas points out, with the accent the word "maté" in Spanish means "I killed".&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

In Brazil, traditionally prepared mate is known as ''chimarrão'', although the word ''mate'' and the expression "''mate amargo''" (bitter mate) are also used in Argentina and Uruguay. The Spanish ''cimarrón'' means "rough", "brute", or "barbarian", but is most widely understood to mean "feral", and is used in almost all of Latin America for domesticated animals that have become wild. The word was then used by the people who colonized the region of the [[Río de la Plata]] to describe the natives' rough and sour drink, drunk with no other ingredient to soften the taste.

Drinking mate is a common social practice in parts of Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and eastern Bolivia. Throughout the [[Southern Cone]], it is considered to be a tradition taken from the ''[[gaucho]]s'' or'' [[vaqueros]]'', terms commonly used to describe the old residents of the South American ''[[pampas]]'', ''[[Gran Chaco|chacos]]'', or [[Patagonian grasslands]], found principally in parts of Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, southeastern Bolivia, southern Chile and southern Brazil.

The preparation of mate is a simple process, consisting of filling a container with yerba, pouring hot, but not boiling, water over the leaves, and drinking with a straw, the ''bombilla'', which acts as a filter so as to draw only the liquid and not the yerba leaves. The method of preparing the mate infusion varies considerably from region to region, and which method yields the finest outcome is debated. However, nearly all methods have some common elements. The beverage is traditionally prepared in a gourd recipient, also called ''mate'' or ''guampa'' in Spanish and ''cuia'' in Portuguese, from which it is drunk. The gourd is nearly filled with ''yerba'', and hot water,&lt;ref name="Brooke 3"&gt;{{Cite news | first = Elizabeth | last = Brooke | title = Yerba Mate, Ancient Antidote To South America's Heat | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/24/garden/yerba-mate-ancient-antidote-to-south-america-s-heat.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | date = 1991-04-24 | accessdate = 2011-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; typically at {{convert|70|to|85|C|F}}, never boiling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ma-tea.com/pages/Traditional-Method.html |title=Traditional Method |website=ma-tea.com |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is added. The drink is so popular within countries that consume it, that several national electric kettle manufacters just refer to the range 70 to 85 °C on its thermostat as "mate" temperature.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The most common preparation involves a careful arrangement of the ''yerba'' within the gourd before adding hot water. In this method, the gourd is first filled one-half to three-quarters of the way with ''yerba''. Too much ''yerba'' will result in a "short" mate; conversely, too little ''yerba'' results in a "long" mate, both being considered undesirable. After that, any additional herbs (''yuyo'', in Portuguese ''jujo'') may be added for either health or flavor benefits, a practice most common in Paraguay, where people acquire herbs from a local ''yuyera'' (herbalist) and use the mate as a base for their herbal infusions. When the gourd is adequately filled, the preparer typically grasps it with the full hand, covering and roughly sealing the opening with the palm. Then the mate is turned upside-down, and shaken vigorously, but briefly and with gradually decreasing force, in this inverted position. This causes the finest, most powdery particles of the ''yerba'' to settle toward the preparer's palm and the top of the mate.

Once the ''yerba mate'' has settled, the mate is carefully brought to a near-sideways angle, with the opening tilted just slightly upward of the base. The mate is then shaken very gently with a side-to-side motion. This further settles the ''yerba mate'' inside the gourd so that the finest particles move toward the opening and the ''yerba'' is layered along one side. The largest stems and other bits create a partition between the empty space on one side of the gourd and the lopsided pile of ''yerba'' on the other.

}}

After arranging the ''yerba'' along one side of the gourd, the mate is carefully tilted back onto its base, minimizing further disturbances of the ''yerba'' as it is re-oriented to allow consumption. Some [[settling]] is normal, but is not desirable. The angled mound of ''yerba'' should remain, with its powdery peak still flat and mostly level with the top of the gourd. A layer of stems along its slope will slide downward and accumulate in the space opposite the ''yerba'' (though at least a portion should remain in place).

All of this careful settling of the ''yerba'' ensures that each sip contains as little particulate matter as possible, creating a smooth-running mate. The finest particles will then be as distant as possible from the filtering end of the straw. With each draw, the smaller particles would inevitably move toward the straw, but the larger particles and stems filter much of this out. A sloped arrangement provides consistent concentration and flavor with each filling of the mate.

[[File:Matero en Posadas.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Statue of a man preparing mate, in Posadas, Misiones, Argentina]]

Now the mate is ready to receive the straw. Wetting the ''yerba'' by gently pouring cool water into the empty space within the gourd until the water nearly reaches the top, and then allowing it to be absorbed into the ''yerba'' before adding the straw, allows the preparer to carefully shape and "pack" the ''yerba''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s slope with the straw's filtering end, which makes the overall form of the ''yerba'' within the gourd more resilient and solid. Dry ''yerba'', though, allows a cleaner and easier insertion of the straw, but care must be taken so as not to overly disturb the arrangement of the ''yerba''. Such a decision is entirely a personal or cultural preference. The straw is inserted with one's thumb on the upper end of the gourd, at an angle roughly perpendicular to the slope of the ''yerba'', so that its filtering end travels into the deepest part of the ''yerba'' and comes to rest near or against the opposite wall of the gourd. It is important for the thumb to form a seal over the end of the straw when it is being inserted, or the negative pressure produced will draw in undesirable particulates.

=== Brewing ===

After the above process, the ''yerba'' may be brewed. If the straw is inserted into dry ''yerba'', the mate must first be filled once with cool water as above, then be allowed to absorb it completely (which generally takes no more than two or three minutes). Treating the ''yerba'' with cool water before the addition of hot water is essential, as it protects the ''yerba mate'' from being scalded and from the chemical breakdown of some of its desirable nutrients. Hot water may then be added by carefully pouring it, as with the cool water before, into the cavity opposite the ''yerba'', until it reaches almost to the top of the gourd when the ''yerba'' is fully saturated. Care should be taken to maintain the dryness of the swollen top of the ''yerba'' beside the edge of the gourd's opening.

Once the hot water has been added, the mate is ready for drinking, and it may be refilled many times before becoming ''lavado'' (washed out) and losing its flavor. When this occurs, the mound of ''yerba'' can be pushed from one side of the gourd to the other, allowing water to be added along its opposite side; this revives the mate for additional refillings and is called "''reformar o/el mate''" (reforming the mate).

Mate is traditionally drunk in a particular social setting, such as family gatherings or with friends. The same gourd (''[[wikt:cuia|cuia]]'') and straw (''[[wikt:bomba|bomba]]/[[wikt:bombilla|bombilla]]'') are used by everyone drinking. One person (known in Portuguese as the ''[[wikt:preparador|preparador]]'', ''[[wikt:cevador|cevador]]'', or ''[[wikt:patrão|patrão]]'', and in Spanish as the ''[[wikt:cebador|cebador]]'') assumes the task of server. Typically, the ''cebador'' fills the gourd and drinks the mate completely to ensure that it is free of particulate matter and of good quality. In some places, passing the first brew of mate to another drinker is considered bad manners, as it may be too cold or too strong; for this reason, the first brew is often called ''[[wikt:mate del zonzo|mate del zonzo]]'' (''mate'' of the fool). The ''cebador'' possibly drinks the second filling, as well, if he or she deems it too cold or bitter. The ''cebador'' subsequently refills the gourd and passes it to the drinker to his or her right, who likewise drinks it all (there is not much; the mate is full of yerba, with room for little water), and returns it without thanking the server; a final ''gracias'' (thank you) implies that the drinker has had enough.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1156709-se-toma-un-mate-segunda-parte La Nación newspaper: ¿Se toma un mate? (Segunda parte)] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only exception to this order is if a new guest joins the group; in this case the new arrival receives the next mate, and then the cebador resumes the order of serving, and the new arrival will receive his or hers depending on his placement in the group. When no more tea remains, the straw makes a loud sucking noise, which is not considered rude. The ritual proceeds around the circle in this way until the mate becomes ''[[wikt:lavado|lavado]]'' (washed out), typically after the gourd has been filled about 10 times or more depending on the ''yerba'' used (well-aged ''yerba mate'' is typically more potent, so provides a greater number of refills) and the ability of the ''cebador''. When one has had one's fill of mate, he or she politely thanks the ''cebador'', passing the mate back at the same time. It is impolite for anyone but the cebador to move the bombilla or otherwise mess with the mate; the cebador may take exception to this and not offer it to the offender again. When someone takes too long, others in the round (''[[wikt:roda|roda]]'' in Portuguse, ''[[wikt:|ronda]]'' in Spanish) will likely politely warn him or her by saying "bring the talking gourd" (''cuia de conversar''); an Argentine equivalent, especially among young people, being ''no es un micrófono'' ("it's not a microphone"), an allusion to the drinkers holding the mate for too long, as if they were using it as a microphone to deliver a lecture.

Some drinkers like to add [[sugar]] or [[honey]], creating ''[[wikt:mate dulce|mate dulce]]'' or ''[[wikt:mate doce|mate doce]]'' (sweet mate), instead of sugarless ''[[wikt:mate amargo|mate amargo]]'' (bitter mate), a practice said to be [[Brazilian tea culture|more common in Brazil]] outside its southernmost state. Some people also like to add lemon or orange peel, some herbs or even coffee, but these are mostly rejected by people who like to stick to the "original" mate.
Traditionally, natural gourds are used, though wood vessels, bamboo tubes, and gourd-shaped ''mates'', made of ceramic or metal (stainless steel or even silver) are also common. The gourd is traditionally made out of the porongo or cabaça fruit shell. Gourds are commonly decorated with silver, sporting decorative or heraldic designs with floral motifs. Some gourd mates with elaborated silver ornaments and silver bombillas are true pieces of jewelry and very sought after by collectors.

A review of a number of population studies in 2009 revealed evidence of an association between [[esophageal cancer]] and hot mate drinking, but these population studies may not be conclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loria|first=D.|author2=Barrios E |author3=Zanetti R. |title=Cancer and Yerba Mate Consumption: a Review of Possible Associations|journal=Rev Panam Salud Publica|date=June 2009|volume=25 | issue = 6; June|pages=530–9|doi=10.1590/S1020-49892009000600010|pmid=19695149|url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1020-49892009000600010&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|accessdate=7 December 2013}} (Full Free Text)&lt;/ref&gt; Some research has suggested the correlation with esophageal cancer results almost entirely from damage caused to the esophagus by burns from the hot liquid as opposed to damage caused by chemicals in the mate; similar links to cancer have been found for tea and other beverages generally consumed at high temperatures. While drinking mate at very high temperatures is considered as "probably carcinogenic to humans" on the IARC Group 2A carcinogens list, mate itself is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mate (IARC Summary &amp; Evaluation) |publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer |year=1991 |volume=51 |page=273 |url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol51/03-mate.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from NCI (National Cancer Institutes) and Brazil found both cold- and hot-water extractions of popular commercial yerba mate products contained high levels (8.03 to 53.3&amp;nbsp;ng/g dry leaves) of carcinogenic [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs) (i.e. [[Benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[a]pyrene]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/17/5/1262 |title=High Levels of Carcinogenic Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Mate Drinks |publisher=Cebp.aacrjournals.org |accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these potential carcinogenic compounds originated from the commercial drying process of the mate leaves, which involves smoke from the burning of wood, much like [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s found in wood-smoked meat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matteleao.com/produtos/arquivos/Yerba%20mate%20Pharmacological%20Properties%20Research%20and%20Biotechnology.pdf Yerba mate: Pharmacological Properties Research and Biotechnology] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Unsmoked" or steamed varieties of yerba mate tea are also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yerbamate.com/drying-methods/ |title=Yerba mate drinking methods|date=2011|accessdate=May 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126142842/http://yerbamate.com/drying-methods/ |archivedate=January 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mate contains B and C [[vitamin]]s, [[polyphenol antioxidant]]s, and has a slightly higher antioxidant capacity than [[green tea]]. On average, mate tea contains 92&amp;nbsp;mg of the [[antioxidant]] [[chlorogenic acid]] per gram of dry leaves, and no [[catechin]]s, giving it a significantly different antioxidant profile from other teas.&lt;ref name="Journal of Food Science"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00535.x | title = Yerba Mate Tea: A Comprehensive Review on Chemistry, Health Implications, and Technological Considerations| journal = Journal of Food Science | date = 2007-10-17 | page = 1 | volume=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00535.x | title = Polyphenols in green tea, black tea, and Mate tea| journal = Journal of Food Science | date = 2007-10-17 | volume=72 | pages=R138–R151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legendary origins ==
{{see also|Guaraní_mythology#Guaran.C3.AD_creation_myth|l1=Guaraní creation myth}}

The Guaraní people started drinking mate in a region that currently includes Paraguay, southern Brazil, southeastern Bolivia, northeastern Argentina and Uruguay. The Guaraní have a legend that says the Goddesses of the Moon and the Cloud came to the Earth one day to visit it, but they instead found a ''yaguareté'' ([[jaguar]]) that was going to attack them. An old man saved them, and, in compensation, the goddesses gave the old man a new kind of plant, from which he could prepare a "drink of friendship".

== Variants ==

Another drink can be prepared with specially cut dry leaves, very cold water, and, optionally, lemon or another fruit juice, called ''[[tereré]]''. It is very common in Paraguay, northeastern Argentina and in the state of [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], Brazil. After pouring the water, it is considered proper to "wait while the saint has a sip" before the first person takes a drink. In southern Brazil, ''tererê'' is sometimes used as a derogatory term for a not hot enough ''chimarrão''.

In Uruguay and Brazil, the traditional gourd is usually big with a corresponding large hole. In Argentina (especially in the capital [[Buenos Aires]]), the gourd is small and has a small hole and people sometimes add sugar for flavor.

In Uruguay, people commonly walk around the streets toting a mate and a [[vacuum flask|thermos]] with hot water. In some parts of Argentina, gas stations sponsored by ''yerba mate'' producers provide free hot water to travelers, specifically for the purpose of drinking during the journey. Disposable mate sets with a plastic mate and straw and sets with a thermos flask and stacking containers for the yerba and sugar inside a fitted case are available.

[[File:Mate cocido frio.jpg|thumb|left|Iced ''[[mate cocido]]'']]

In Argentina, ''[[mate cocido]]'' (boiled mate), in Brazil, "chá mate", is made with a [[teabag]] or leaves and drunk from a cup or mug, with or without sugar and milk. Companies such as Cabrales from [[Mar del Plata]] and [[Establecimiento Las Marías]] produce teabags for export to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=340787 ''Cabrales abrirá locales en la Capital''] [[La Nación (Buenos Aires)|La Nación]] online, 6 October 2001 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travel narratives, such as [[Maria Graham]]'s ''Journal of a Residence in Chile'', show a long history of mate drinking in central Chile. Many rural Chileans drink mate, in particular in the southern regions, particularly [[Magallanes Region of Chile|Magallanes]], [[Aysén Region|Aysén]] and [[Chiloé Archipelago|Chiloé]].

In some parts of Syria, Lebanon and other Eastern Mediterranean countries, drinking mate is common. The custom came from Syrians and Lebanese who moved to South America during the late 19th and early parts of the 20th century, adopted the tradition, and kept it after returning to Western Asia. Syria is the biggest importer of yerba mate in the world, importing 15,000&amp;nbsp;tons a year. Mostly, the [[Druze]] communities in Syria and Lebanon maintain the culture and practice of mate.&lt;ref name="donald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Middle East Online"/&gt;

'''Matthew D. Teitelbaum''' (born February 13, 1956) is a Canadian [[art historian]], who is currently the director of [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].

==Career==
Born in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Teitelbaum is the son of the late painter [[Mashel Teitelbaum]] and Ethel. He holds a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[History of Canada|Canadian history]] from [[Carleton University]] and an [[Master of Philosophy|M.Phil.]] in modern [[European painting]] and [[sculpture]] from the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]]. He has taught and lectured at [[Harvard University]], [[York University]], and the [[University of Western Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mfa.org/news/new-mfa-director&lt;/ref&gt;

Teitelbaum first held curatorial positions with the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston]], and the [[Mendel Art Gallery]]. He later joined the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] in 1993 as chief [[curator]] and was later appointed as the Michael and Sonja Koerner Director and CEO in 1998. As a curator, he has published numerous publications and exhibition catalogues on modern and contemporary Canadian artists as [[Greg Curnoe]], [[Paterson Ewen]], [[Joe Fafard]], [[Betty Goodwin]], [[Edward Poitras]], and [[Robert Wiens]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3ATeitelbaum%2C+Matthew.&amp;qt=hot_author&lt;/ref&gt; As the museum's director and CEO, he oversaw the institution’s $306 million expansion and renovation of its Beaux-Arts building by the architect [[Frank Gehry]].&lt;ref&gt;Robin Pogrebin (April 9, 2015), [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/toronto-museum-director-to-succeed-malcolm-rogers-as-leader-of-museum-of-fine-arts-boston/ Toronto Museum Director to Succeed Malcolm Rogers as Leader of Museum of Fine Arts, Boston] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 9, 2015, the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] announced that Teitelbaum had been chosen to serve as the Ann and Graham Gund Director, replacing [[Malcolm Rogers (curator)|Malcolm Rogers]], who had served as the museum's director for 21 years.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Pogrebin (April 9, 2015), [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/toronto-museum-director-to-succeed-malcolm-rogers-as-leader-of-museum-of-fine-arts-boston/ Toronto Museum Director to Succeed Malcolm Rogers as Leader of Museum of Fine Arts, Boston] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Morphometrics''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] μορϕή ''morphe'', "shape, form", and -μετρία ''metria'', "measurement") or '''morphometry '''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/;jsessionid=3ECC7D5EDBE87ECFCCD62D9BD27A35D8?authRejection=true&amp;url=%2Fview%2FEntry%2F122372%3FredirectedFrom%3Dmorphometrics|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|author=|date=|website=oed.com|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the quantitative analysis of '''''form''''', a concept that encompasses size and shape.  Morphometric analyses are commonly performed on organisms, and are useful in analyzing their fossil record, the impact of mutations on shape, developmental changes in form, covariances between ecological factors and shape, as well for estimating quantitative-genetic parameters of shape. Morphometrics can be used to quantify a trait of evolutionary significance, and by detecting changes in the shape, deduce something of their [[ontogeny]], function or evolutionary relationships.  A major objective of morphometrics is to statistically test hypotheses about the factors that affect shape.

"Morphometrics", in the broader sense, is also used to precisely locate certain areas of organs such as the brain,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ripublication.com/irph/ijece/ijecev8n1_07.pdf|title=A Study Of Status Of Brain Morphometry Analysis In Neuroimaging|last=Mr. T.Chandra Sekhar Rao and Dr. G.Sreenivasulu|date=2015|website=Research India Publications|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www-sop.inria.fr/epidaure/personnel/Miguel.Gonzalez/Thesis.pdf|title=Morphometric Analysis of Brain Structures in MRI|last=González Ballester|first=Miguel Ángel|date=1999|website=Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chollet |first1=Madeleine B. |last2=Aldridge |first2=Kristina |last3=Pangborn |first3=Nicole |last4=Weinberg |first4=Seth M. |last5=DeLeon |first5=Valerie B. |last6=Baron |first6=Jean-Claude |title=Landmarking the Brain for Geometric Morphometric Analysis: An Error Study |journal=PLoS ONE |date=28 January 2014 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=e86005 |pmc =3904856|pmid = 24489689|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0086005|bibcode = 2014PLoSO...986005C}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in describing the shapes of other things.

==Forms of morphometrics==
[[File:BirdMorphometrics.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Standard measurements of birds]]

Three general approaches to form are usually distinguished: traditional morphometrics, landmark-based morphometrics and outline-based morphometrics.

==="Traditional" morphometrics===

Traditional morphometrics analyzes lengths, widths, masses, angles, ratios and areas.&lt;ref name=Marcus1990&gt;Marcus, L. F. (1990). Chapter 4. Traditional morphometrics. In Proceedings of the Michigan Morphometric Workshop. Special Publication No. 2. F. J. Rohlf and F. L. Bookstein. Ann Arbor MI, The University of Michigan Museum of Zoology: 77–122.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, traditional morphometric data are measurements of size.  A drawback of using many measurements of size is that most will be highly correlated; as a result, there are few independent variables despite the many measurements. For instance, tibia length will vary with femur length and also with humerus and ulna length and even with measurements of the head. Traditional morphometric data are nonetheless useful when either absolute or relative sizes are of particular interest, such as in studies of growth.  These data are also useful when size measurements are of theoretical importance such as body mass and limb cross-sectional area and length in studies of functional morphology. However, these measurements have one important limitation: they contain little information about the spatial distribution of shape changes across the organism. They are also useful when determining the extent to which certain pollutants have affected an individual. these indices include the hepatosomatic index, gonadosomatic index and also the condition factors (shakumbila, 2014).

===Landmark-based geometric morphometrics===
{{further|Geometric data analysis|Statistical shape analysis}}

In landmark-based geometric morphometrics, the spatial information missing from traditional morphometrics is contained in the data, because the data are coordinates of [[Landmark point|landmarks]]: discrete anatomical loci that are arguably ''homologous'' in all individuals in the analysis (i.e. they can be regarded as the "same" point in each specimens in the study). For example, where two specific [[Suture (geology)|sutures]] intersect is a landmark, as are intersections between veins on an insect wing or leaf, or [[foramina]], small holes through which veins and blood vessels pass. Landmark-based studies have traditionally analyzed 2D data, but with the increasing availability of 3D imaging techniques, 3D analyses are becoming more feasible even for small structures such as teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singleton|first=M.|author2=Rosenberger, A. L. |author3=Robinson, C. |author4=O'Neill, R. |title=Allometric and metameric shape variation in ''Pan'' mandibular molars: A digital morphometric analysis|journal=Anatomical Record|year=2011|volume=294|issue=2|pages=322–334|doi=10.1002/ar.21315|pmid=21235007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding enough landmarks to provide a comprehensive description of shape can be difficult when working with fossils or easily damaged specimens. That is because all landmarks must be present in all specimens, although coordinates of missing landmarks can be estimated. The data for each individual consists of a ''configuration'' of landmarks.

There are three recognized categories of landmarks.&lt;ref name="Bookstein1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bookstein|first=F. L.|title=Morphometric Tools for Landmark Data: Geometry and Biology|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Type 1 landmarks'' are defined locally, i.e. in terms of structures close to that point; for example, an intersection between three sutures, or intersections between veins on an insect wing are locally defined and surrounded by tissue on all sides. ''Type 3 landmarks'', in contrast, are defined in terms of points far away from the landmark, and are often defined in terms of a point "furthest away" from another point. ''Type 2 landmarks'' are intermediate; this category includes points such as  the tip structure, or local minima and maxima of curvature.  They are defined in terms of local features, but they are not surrounded on all sides. In addition to landmarks, there are ''semilandmarks'', points whose position along a curve is arbitrary but which provide information about curvature in two&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zelditch|first=M. |author2=Wood, A. R. |author3=Bonnet, R. M. |author4=Swiderski, D. L. |title=Modularity of the rodent mandible: Integrating muscles, bones and teeth|journal=Evolution &amp; Development|year=2008|volume=10|issue=6|pages=756–768|doi=10.1111/j.1525-142X.2008.00290.x|pmid=19021747 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitteroecker|first=P|author2=Bookstein, F.L.

====Procrustes-based geometric morphometrics====
Shape analysis begins by removing the information that is not about shape. By definition, shape is not altered by translation, scaling or rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kendall|first=D.G.|title=The diffusion of shape|journal=Advances in Applied Probability|year=1977|volume=9|pages=428–430|doi=10.2307/1426091|issue=3|jstor=1426091}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, to compare shapes, the non-shape information is removed from the coordinates of landmarks.  There is more than one way to do these three operations. One method is to fix the coordinates of two points to (0,0) and (0,1), which are the two ends of a baseline. In one step, the shapes are translated to the same position (the same two coordinates are fixed to those values), the shapes are scaled (to unit baseline length) and the shapes are rotated.&lt;ref name=Bookstein1991 /&gt;  An alternative, and preferred method, is [[Procrustes superimposition]].  This method translates the centroid of the shapes to (0,0); the ''x'' coordinate of the centroid is the average of the ''x'' coordinates of the landmarks, and the ''y'' coordinate of the centroid is the average of the ''y''-coordinates. Shapes are scaled to unit centroid size, which is the square root of the summed squared distances of each landmark to the centroid.  The configuration is rotated to minimize the deviation between it and a reference, typically the mean shape. In the case of semi-landmarks, variation in position along the curve is also removed. Because shape space is curved, analyses are done by projecting shapes onto a space tangent to shape space.  Within the tangent space, conventional multivariate statistical methods such as multivariate analysis of variance and multivariate regression, can be used to test statistical hypotheses about shape.

Procrustes-based analyses have some limitations.  One is that the Procrustes superimposition uses a least-squares criterion to find the optimal rotation; consequently, variation that is localized to a single landmark will be smeared out across many.  This is called the 'Pinocchio Effect.' Another is that the superimposition may itself impose a pattern of covariation on the landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rohlf|first=F. J.|author2=Slice, D.|title=Extensions of the Procrustes method for the optimal superimposition of landmarks|journal=Systematic Zoology|year=1990|volume=39|pages=40–59|doi=10.2307/2992207|issue=1|jstor=2992207|citeseerx=10.1.1.547.626}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=J.|title=The ability of geometric morphometric methods to estimate a known covariance matrix|journal=Systematic Biology|year=2000|volume=49|pages=686–696|doi=10.1080/106351500750049770|pmid=12116434|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, any information that cannot be captured by landmarks and semilandmarks cannot be analyzed, including classical measurements like "greatest skull breadth."  Moreover, there are criticisms of Procrustes-based methods that motivate an alternative approach to analyzing landmark data.

===Outline analysis===
[[File:Thelodont morphometrics.svg|thumb|The results of [[principal component analysis]] performed on an outline analysis of some [[thelodont]] denticles.]]
[[Outline analysis]] is another approach to analyzing shape. What distinguishes outline analysis is that coefficients of mathematical functions are fitted to points sampled along the outline. There are a number of ways of quantifying an outline.  Older techniques such as the "fit to a polynomial curve"&lt;ref&gt;

The former involves fitting a preset number of semilandmarks at equal intervals around the outline of a shape, recording the deviation of each step from semilandmark to semilandmark from what the angle of that step would be were the object a simple circle.&lt;ref name=MacLeod1993&gt;For an example "in use", see {{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter defines the outline as the sum of the minimum number of ellipses required to mimic the shape.&lt;ref name=Schmittbuhl2007&gt;e.g. {{cite journal

Both methods have their weaknesses; the most dangerous (and easily overcome) is their susceptibility to noise in the outline.&lt;ref name=Haines2000&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, neither compares homologous points, and global change is always given more weight than local variation (which may have large biological consequences).
Eigenshape analysis requires an equivalent starting point to be set for each specimen, which can be a source of error
EFA also suffers from redundancy in that not all variables are independent.&lt;ref name=Haines2000/&gt;  On the other hand, it is possible to apply them to complex curves without having to define a centroid; this makes removing the effect of location, size and rotation much simpler.&lt;ref name=Haines2000/&gt;
The perceived failings of outline morphometrics are that it doesn't compare points of a homologous origin, and that it oversimplifies complex shapes by restricting itself to considering the outline and not internal changes.  Also, since it works by approximating the outline by a series of ellipses, it deals poorly with pointed shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zelditch|first=M.L|author2=Swiderski, D.L. |author3=Sheets, H.D. |author4=Fink, W.L. |title=Geometric Morphometrics for Biologists: A Primer|year=2004|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|location=San Diego}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One criticism of outline-based methods is that they disregard homology – a famous example of this disregard being the ability of outline-based methods to compare a [[scapula]] to a potato chip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zelditch|first=M.|author2=Fink, W.

An argument against that critique is that, if landmark approaches to morphometrics can be used to test biological hypotheses in the absence of homology data, it is inappropriate to fault outline-based approaches for enabling the same types of studies &lt;ref name=MacLeod1999&gt;{{cite journal

==Analyzing data==
Multivariate statistical methods can be used to test statistical hypotheses about factors that affect shape and to visualize their effects.  To visualize the patterns of variation in the data, the data need to be reduced to a comprehensible (low-dimensional) form. [[Principal component analysis]] (PCA) is a commonly employed tool to do summarize the variation. Simply put, the technique projects as much of the overall variation as possible into a few dimensions.  See the figure at the right for an example.  Each axis on a PCA plot is an [[eigenvector]] of the covariance matrix of shape variables.  The first axis accounts for maximum variation in the sample, with further axes representing further ways in which the samples vary.  The pattern of clustering of samples in this morphospace represents similarities and differences in shapes, which can reflect [[phylogenetic relationship]]s. As well as exploring patterns of variation, Multivariate statistical methods can be used to test statistical hypotheses about factors that affect shape and to visualize their effects, although PCA is not needed for this purpose unless the method requires inverting the variance-covariance matrix.

Landmark data allow the difference between population means, or the deviation an individual from its population mean, to be visualized in at least two ways.  One depicts vectors at landmarks that show the magnitude and direction in which that landmark is displaced relative to the others.  The second depicts the difference via the [[thin plate splines]], an interpolation function that models change ''between'' landmarks from the data of changes in coordinates ''of'' landmarks.  This function produces what look like deformed grids; where regions that relatively elongated, the grid will look stretched and where those regions are relatively shortened, the grid will look compressed.

==Ecology and evolutionary biology==

[[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson|D'Arcy Thompson]] in 1917 suggested that shapes in many different species could also be related in this way. In the case of shells and horns he gave a fairly precise analysis… But he also drew various pictures of fishes and skulls, and argued that they were related by deformations of coordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolfram |first=Stephen |title=A New Kind of Science |url=http://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p400--growth-of-plants-and-animals |year=2002 |publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc. |isbn=978-1-57955-008-0 |page=1010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroimaging===
In [[neuroimaging]], the most common variants are [[voxel-based morphometry]], [[deformation-based morphometry]] and [[surface-based morphometry]] of the [[brain]].{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}

===Bone histomorphometry===
Histomorphometry of bone involves obtaining a [[Trephine|bone biopsy specimen]] and processing of bone specimens in the laboratory, obtaining estimates of the proportional volumes and surfaces occupied by different components of bone. First the bone is broken down by baths in highly concentrated [[ethanol]] and [[acetone]]. The bone is then embedded and [[staining|stained]] so that it can be visualized/analyzed under a [[microscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Revell PA |title=Histomorphometry of bone |journal=J.

A '''mother''' is the [[female]] parent of a [[child]]. Mothers are [[women]] who inhabit or perform the role of bearing some relation to their [[children]], who may or may not be their biological [[offspring]]. Thus, dependent on the context, women can be considered mothers by virtue of having given [[birth]], by raising their child(ren), supplying their ovum for [[fertilisation]], or some combination thereof. Such conditions provide a way of delineating the concept of motherhood, or the state of being a mother. Women who meet the third and first categories usually fall under the terms 'birth mother' or 'biological mother', regardless of whether the individual in question goes on to parent their child. Accordingly, a woman who meets only the second condition may be considered an [[adoption|adoptive]] mother, and those who meet only the third a [[surrogate pregnancy|surrogacy]] mother.

The above concepts defining the role of mother are neither exhaustive nor universal, as any definition of 'mother' may vary based on how social, cultural, and religious roles are defined. The parallel conditions and terms for males: those who are (typically biologically) [[father]]s do not, by definition, take up the role of fatherhood. Mother and fatherhood are not limited to those who are or have [[parenting|parented]]. Women who are [[pregnant]] may be referred to as expectant mothers or mothers-to-be, though such applications tend to be less readily applied to (biological) fathers or adoptive parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=definition of mother from Oxford Dictionaries Online|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mother?rskey=YplwRN&amp;result=1|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Define Mother at Dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mother|publisher=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of becoming a mother has been referred to as "matrescence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sacks |first1=Alexandra |title=The Birth of a Mother |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/well/family/the-birth-of-a-mother.html |accessdate=9 September 2018 |date=8 May 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological mother==
[[File:Countries by Birth Rate in 2014.svg|thumb|Countries by crude birth rate (CBR) in 2014. Birth rates are lowest in Western countries.]]
Biological motherhood for [[human]]s, as in other [[mammal]]s, occurs when a [[pregnant]] female gestates a fertilized ovum (the "egg"). A female can become pregnant through [[sexual intercourse]] after she has begun to [[ovulate]]. In well-nourished girls, [[menarche]] (the first [[menstrual cycle|menstrual period]])  usually takes place around the age of 12 or 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/589004_3|title=Medscape: Medscape Access|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, a [[fetus]] develops from the viable [[zygote]], resulting in an [[embryo]]. [[Gestation]] occurs in the woman's [[uterus]] until the fetus (assuming it is carried to [[Pregnancy duration|term]]) is sufficiently developed to be born. In humans, gestation is often around 9 months in duration, after which the woman experiences labor and gives birth. This is not always the case, however, as some babies are born [[preterm birth|prematurely]], late, or in the case of [[stillbirth]], do not survive gestation. Usually, once the baby is born, the mother produces [[milk]] via the [[lactation]] process. The mother's [[breast milk]] is the source of [[antibodies]] for the infant's [[immune system]], and commonly the sole source of nutrition for newborns before they are able to eat and digest other foods; older infants and toddlers may continue to be breastfed, in combination with other foods, which should be introduced from approximately six months of age.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/solid-foods-weaning/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Childlessness]] is the state of not having children. Childlessness may have personal, social or political significance. Childlessness may be [[voluntary childlessness]], which occurs by choice, or may be involuntary due to health problems or social circumstances. Motherhood is usually voluntary, but may also be the result of [[forced pregnancy]], such as [[pregnancy from rape]]. Unwanted motherhood occurs especially in cultures which practice [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]].

==Non-biological mother==
''Mother'' can often apply to a woman other than the biological parent, especially if she fulfills the main social role in raising the child. This is commonly either an [[adoptive]] mother or a [[stepmother]] (the biologically unrelated [[Significant other|partner]] of a child's [[father]]). The term "[[othermother]]" or "other mother" is also used in some contexts for women who provide care for a child not biologically their own in addition to the child's primary mother.

Adoption, in various forms, has been practiced throughout history, even predating human civilization.&lt;ref name="Conn2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Conn|title=Adoption: A Brief Social and Cultural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DoUh9LvIzRcC&amp;pg=PA25|date=28 January 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-33390-2|pages=25–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern systems of adoption, arising in the 20th century, tend to be governed by comprehensive [[statutes]] and [[regulations]]. In recent decades, [[international adoption]]s have become more and more common.

[[Adoption in the United States]] is common and relatively easy from a legal point of view (compared to other Western countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jardine|first=Cassandra|title=Why adoption is so easy in America|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/3354960/Why-adoption-is-so-easy-in-America.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=31 Oct 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the US accounted for nearly half of the total number of adoptions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/policy/child-adoption.pdf |format=PDF |title=Child Adoption : Trends and Policies |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surrogate mother===
{{Main|Surrogacy}}
A surrogate mother is a woman who bears a child that came from another woman's fertilized ovum on behalf of a couple unable to give birth to children. Thus the surrogate mother carries and gives birth to a child that she is not the biological mother of. Surrogate motherhood became possible with advances in [[reproductive technologies]], such as [[in vitro]] fertilization.

Not all women who become pregnant via in vitro fertilization are surrogate mothers. Surrogacy involves both a genetic mother, who provides the ovum, and a gestational (or surrogate) mother, who carries the child to term.

===Motherhood in same-sex relationships===
The possibility for lesbian and bisexual women in [[same-sex relationship]]s (or women without a partner) to become mothers has increased over the past few decades{{when|date=October 2014}} due to technological developments. Modern [[gay parenting|lesbian parenting]] (a term that somewhat [[bisexual erasure|erases]] the bisexual case) originated with women who were in heterosexual relationships who later identified as lesbian or bisexual, as changing attitudes provided more acceptance for non-heterosexual relationships. Another way for such women to become mothers is through [[LGBT adoption|adopting]] or [[foster parent]]ing. There is also the option of self-[[insemination]] and clinically assisted donor insemination, forms of [[artificial insemination]]. As fertility technology has advanced, more females not in a heterosexual relationship have become mothers through [[in vitro fertilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://find.galegroup.com/gtx/infomark.do?&amp;contentSet=IAC-Documents&amp;type=retrieve&amp;tabID=T002&amp;prodId=AONE&amp;docId=A96237890&amp;source=gale&amp;userGroupName=wash_main&amp;version=1.0 |title=Lesbian parenting: issues, strengths and challenges |accessdate=2011-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hooks2000"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mezey, Nancy J |title=New Choices, New Families: How Lesbians Decide about Motherhood |year=2008 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=978-0-8018-9000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social roles associated with motherhood are variable across time, culture, and social class.

In many cultures, women received significant help in performing these tasks from older female relatives, such as mothers in law or their own mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biology.unm.edu/fasmith/Web_Page_PDFs/Smith_Brown_1996.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Changing Role of Women in North American Mammalogy |publisher=Biology.unm.edu |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding [[women in the workforce]], mothers often entail a [[mommy track]] rather than being entirely "[[career women]]". Mothers may be [[Housewife|stay at home mothers]] or [[Working parent|working mothers]]. In recent decades there has been an increase in [[Stay-at-home dad|stay at home fathers]] too. Social views on these arrangements vary significantly by culture: in Europe for instance, in German-speaking countries there is a strong tradition of mothers exiting the workforce and being homemakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ined.fr/fichier/s_rubrique/26128/540.population.societies.2017.january.en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Has childlessness peaked in Europe? |website=Ined.fr|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers have historically fulfilled the primary role in raising children, but since the late 20th century, the role of the father in child care has been given greater prominence and social acceptance in some Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pascal.iseg.utl.pt/~cisep/conferencias/conferencia_20021016/Papers/kjeldstad55.PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815170110/http://pascal.iseg.utl.pt/~cisep/conferencias/conferencia_20021016/Papers/kjeldstad55.PDF|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucgstp.org/lit/gn/gn064/fathersimportant.htm |title=ucgstp.org |publisher=Ucgstp.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 20th century also saw more and more women entering paid work. [[Mothers' rights]] within the workforce include [[maternity leave]] and [[parental leave]].

The social role and experience of motherhood varies greatly depending upon location. Mothers are more likely than fathers to encourage assimilative and communion-enhancing patterns in their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ann M. Berghout Austin1 and T.J.

Since the 1970s, [[in vitro fertilization]] has made pregnancy possible at ages well beyond "natural" limits, generating ethical controversy and forcing significant changes in the social meaning of motherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/motherhood-is-it-ever-too_b_233916.html |title=Motherhood: Is It Ever Too Late? &amp;#124; Jacob M.

Traditionally, and still in most parts of the world today, a mother was expected to be a [[married]] woman, with birth outside of marriage carrying a strong [[social stigma]]. Historically, this stigma not only applied to the mother, but also to her child. This continues to be the case in many parts of the developing world today, but in many Western countries the situation has changed radically, with single motherhood being much more socially acceptable now. For more details on these subjects, see [[Legitimacy (family law)]] and [[single parent]].

The total fertility rate (TFR), that is, the number of children born per woman, differs greatly from country to country. The TFR in 2013 was estimated to be highest in [[Niger]] (7.03 children born per woman) and lowest in [[Singapore]] (0.79 children/woman).&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the TFR was estimated for 2013 at 2.06 births per woman.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; In 2011, the average age at first birth was 25.6 and 40.7% of births were to unmarried women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/births.htm|title=FastStats|work=cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''maternal death'' is defined by [[World Health Organization|WHO]] as "the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/indmaternalmortality/en/|title=WHO - Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births)|work=who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 56% of maternal deaths occur in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and another 29% in [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/news/over-99-percent-of-maternal-deaths-occur-in-developing-countries|title=Over 99 percent of maternal deaths occur in developing countries|work=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the organization [[Save the Children]] has [[Save the Children State of the World's Mothers report|ranked]] the countries of the world, and found that [[Scandinavia]]n countries are the safest places to give birth, whereas countries in sub-Saharan Africa are the least safe to give birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethechildren.net/alliance/what_we_do/newsdesk/2006-05-08b.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012211639/http://www.savethechildren.net/alliance/what_we_do/newsdesk/2006-05-08b.html|date=October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study argues a mother in the bottom ten ranked countries is over 750 times more likely to [[maternal mortality|die in pregnancy or childbirth]], compared to a mother in the top ten ranked countries, and a mother in the bottom ten ranked countries is 28 times more likely to [[infant mortality|see her child die]] before reaching their first birthday.

The most recent data suggests that [[Italy]], [[Sweden]] and [[Luxembourg]] are the safest countries in terms of maternal death and [[Afghanistan]], [[Central African Republic]] and [[Malawi]] are the most dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newser.com/story/86023/safest-place-to-give-birth-italy.html|title=Safest Place to Give Birth?

[[Childbirth]] is an inherently dangerous and risky procedure, subject to many complications. The "natural" mortality rate of childbirth—where nothing is done to avert maternal death—has been estimated as being 1500 deaths per 100,000 births.&lt;ref name="vanlerberghe"&gt;Van Lerberghe W, De Brouwere V. ''Of blind alleys and things that have worked: history’s lessons on reducing maternal mortality.'' In: De Brouwere V, Van Lerberghe W, eds. ''Safe motherhood strategies: a review of the evidence''. Antwerp, ITG Press, 2001 (Studies in Health Services Organisation and Policy, 17:7–33).  "Where nothing effective is done to avert maternal death, "natural" mortality is probably of the order of magnitude of 1,500/100,000."&lt;/ref&gt; Modern medicine has greatly alleviated the risk of childbirth. In modern Western countries the current maternal mortality rate is around 10 deaths per 100,000 births.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid'', p10&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history mothers with their children have often been the subject of artistic works, such as paintings, sculptures or writings.

Fourth century grave reliefs on the island of [[Rhodes]] depicted mothers with children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |plainurl= |id=3fnsWhZkq74C |page=234 |title=Women, Crime and Punishment in Ancient Law and Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paintings of mothers with their children have a long tradition in [[France]]. In the 18th century, these works embodied the Enlightenment's preoccupation with strong family bonds and the relation between mothers and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |plainurl= |title=Intimate Encounters: Love and Domesticity in Eighteenth-century France |id=DQ_8S3iJPa4C |page=87 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the nineteenth century, [[Mary Cassatt]] was a painter well known for her portraits of mothers.

Many contemporary movies portray mothers.

{{Main|Mama and papa}}
The proverbial "first word" of an infant often sounds like "ma" or "mama". This strong association of that sound with "mother" has persisted in nearly every language on earth, countering the natural localization of language.

Familiar or colloquial terms for ''mother'' in English are:
* ''Ma''(মা), ''Amma'' (আম্মা), ''Ammu'' (আম্মু) used in [[Bangladesh]]
* ''Aama'', ''Mata'' used in [[Nepal]]
* ''Mom'' and ''mommy'' are used in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[South Africa]], [[India]] and parts of the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] including [[Birmingham]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

* ''Mum'' and ''mummy'' and ''mama'' are used in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Singapore]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Ireland]]. [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] publicly addressed his mother Queen [[Elizabeth II]] as "Mummy" on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince Charles pays tribute to 'Mummy'|url=http://www.itn.co.uk/home/46932/Prince+Charles+pays+tribute+to+Mummy|accessdate=5 June 2012|newspaper=ITN website|date=5 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026031917/http://www.itn.co.uk/home/46932/Prince+Charles+pays+tribute+to+Mummy|archivedate=26 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
[[File:Մայր Հայաստան հուշարձան.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Mother Armenia]], aerial view in [[Yerevan]]]]
The modern English word is from Middle English moder, from Old English mōdor, from Proto-Germanic *mōdēr (cf. East Frisian muur, Dutch moeder, German Mutter), from Proto-Indo-European *méh₂tēr (cf. Irish máthair, Tocharian A mācar, B mācer, Lithuanian mótė). Other cognates include Latin māter, Greek μήτηρ, Common Slavic *mati (thence Russian мать (mat’)), Persian مادر (madar), and Sanskrit मातृ (mātṛ).

[[File:A sermon preached at Fort St. George on the coast of Chormandel in East India, February 21 1668.jpg|thumb|right|Due to their low cost and ease of production, pamphlets have often been used to popularize political or religious ideas.]]

A '''pamphlet''' is an unbound [[book]] (that is, without a [[Hardcover|hard cover]] or [[Bookbinding|binding]]). It may consist of a single sheet of [[paper]] that is printed on both sides and folded in half, in thirds, or in fourths, called a ''leaflet'', or it may consist of a few pages that are folded in half and [[Saddle stitch stapler|saddle stapled]] at the crease to make a simple book.

For the "International Standardization of Statistics Relating to Book Production and Periodicals", [[UNESCO]] defines a pamphlet as "a non-[[periodical]] printed publication of at least 5 but not more than 48 pages, exclusive of the cover pages, published in a particular country and made available to the public" and a [[book]] as  "a non-periodical printed publication of at least 49 pages, exclusive of the cover pages". The UNESCO definitions are, however, only meant to be used for the particular purpose of drawing up their book production statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13068&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO definition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''pamphlet'' for a small work (''opuscule'') issued by itself without covers came into [[Middle English]] ca 1387 as ''pamphilet'' or ''panflet'', generalized from a twelfth-century [[Elegiac comedy|amatory comic poem]] with an old flavor{{clarify|date=May 2015}}, ''[[Pamphilus de amore|Pamphilus, seu de Amore]]'' ("Pamphilus: or, Concerning Love"), written in [[Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'' [[s.v.]] "pamphlet".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OEtDpamphlet&gt;{{OEtymD|pamphlet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pamphilus's name is derived from the Greek name {{lang|grc|Πάμφιλος}}, meaning "beloved of all".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pa/mfilos|πάμφιλος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was popular and widely copied and circulated on its own, forming a slim [[codex]].

==History==
[[Image:Pamphlet dutch tulipomania 1637.jpg|thumb|right|The pamphlet form of literature has been used for centuries as an economical vehicle for the broad distribution of information.]]
Its modern connotations of a [[Tract (literature)|tract]] concerning a contemporary issue was a product of the heated arguments leading to the [[English Civil War]]; this sense appeared in 1642.&lt;ref name=OEtDpamphlet/&gt; In some European languages other than English, this secondary connotation, of a disputatious tract, has come to the fore: compare ''[[Libelle (literary genre)|libelle]]'', from the Latin ''libellus'', denoting a "little book".&lt;ref&gt;In German, French, Spanish and Italian ''pamphlet'' often has negative connotations of slanderous libel or religious propaganda; idiomatic neutral translations of English ''pamphlet'' include "Flugblatt" and "Broschüre" in German, "Fascicule" in French, and "folleto" in Spanish. In Russian and Romanian, the word "{{lang|ru|памфлет}}" in Russian Cyrillic, "{{lang|ru|pamflet}}" in Romanian also normally connotes a work of propaganda or satire, so it is best translated as "brochure" ("{{lang|ru|брошюра}}" in Russian, broşură in Romanian). ([http://dexonline.ro/search.php?cuv=pamflet DEX online - Cautare: pamflet])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Pamphlets can contain anything from information on kitchen appliances to medical information and religious treatises. Pamphlets are very important in [[marketing]] because they are cheap to produce and can be distributed easily to customers. Pamphlets have also long been an important tool of [[political platform|political]] [[protest]] and [[political campaign]]ing for similar reasons.

A [[pamphleteer]] is a historical term for someone who produces or distributes pamphlets, especially for a political cause.

==Collectibility==

Ephemeral and to wide array of political or religious perspectives given voice by the format's ease of production, pamphlets are prized by many [[book collecting|book collectors]]. Substantial accumulations have been amassed and transferred to ownership of academic [[research library|research libraries]] around the world.

Particularly comprehensive collections of American political pamphlets are housed at [[New York Public Library]], the [[Tamiment Library]] of [[New York University]], and the [[Jo Labadie]] collection at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;Oakley C. Johnson, ''Marxism in United States History Before the Russian Revolution (1876-1917).'' New York: Humanities Press, 1974; pg. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial uses==

The pamphlet has been widely adopted in commerce, particularly as a format for [[marketing]] communications. There are numerous purposes for pamphlets, such as product descriptions or instructions, corporate information, events promotions or tourism guides and they are often used in the same way as leaflets or brochures.

The '''''Peterborough Chronicle''''' (also called the '''Laud manuscript''' and the '''E manuscript'''), one of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]s'', contains unique information about the [[history of England]] after the [[Norman Conquest]].  According to [[philologist]] [[J.A.W. Bennett]], it is the only prose history in English between the Conquest and the later 14th century.

[[Image:Peterborough.Chronicle.firstpage.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The opening page of the Laud Manuscript.  The scribal hand is the copyist's work rather than either the First or Second continuation scribes.&lt;br /&gt;
''[https://books.google.com/books?id=F7sVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA277#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Translation of this scanned page.]''&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Bosworth, ''The Elements of Anglo-Saxon Grammar,'' p. 277. (This book is in public domain)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicles'' were composed and maintained between the various [[monastery|monasteries]] of Anglo-Saxon England and were an attempt to record the history of Britain throughout the years AD. Typically the chronicles began with the birth of Christ, went through [[Biblical]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] history, then continued to the present. Every major religious house in England kept its own, individual chronicle, and the chronicles were not compared with each other or in any way kept uniform. For example, in the opening paragraph of this chronicle it is said that the Britons that settled in South Britain came from "Armenia".  ("Armenia" is probably a mistaken transcription of Armorica, an area in Northwestern Gaul.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Avalon Project|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/medieval/ang01.asp|publisher=Yale Law School|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[https://books.google.com/books?id=F7sVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA277#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Bosworth, ''The Elements of Anglo-Saxon Grammar,'' p. 277. (This book is in public domain)&lt;/ref&gt; However, whenever a monastery's chronicle was damaged, or when a new monastery began a chronicle, nearby monasteries would lend out their chronicles for copying. Thus, a new chronicle would be identical to the lender's until they reached the date of copying and then would be idiosyncratic. Such was the case with the ''Peterborough Chronicle'': a fire compelled the abbey to copy the chronicles from other churches up to 1120.

When [[William the Conqueror]] took England and [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] became the official language, the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicles'' generally ceased. The monks of [[Peterborough Abbey]], however, continued to compile events in theirs. While the ''Peterborough Chronicle'' is not professional history, and one still needs [[Latin]] histories (e.g. [[William of Malmesbury]]'s ''Gesta Regum Anglorum''), it is one of the few surviving first-hand accounts from the period 1070 to 1154 in England written in English and from a non-courtly point of view.

It is also a valuable source of information about the early [[Middle English]] language itself. The first continuation, for example, is written in late [[Old English]], but the second continuation begins to show mixed forms, until the conclusion of the second continuation, which switches into an early form of distinctly Middle English. The linguistic novelties recorded in the second continuation are plentiful, including at least one true innovation: the feminine pronoun "[[she]]" (as ''"scæ"'') is first recorded in the ''Peterborough Chronicle'' ({{harvnb|Bennett|1986}}).

The chronicle from the original copied text through the continuations shows the history of the loss of [[grammatical gender]] in West Saxon English, going from the copied portion which while mostly conforming to Old English grammatical gender does have some discrepancies, through the first continuation in which modifiers are re-adapted to other functions and there is a large discrepancy with Old English grammatical gender, to the second continuation in which grammatical gender is completely lost or nearly so.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/317750245|title=Grammatical gender in English, 950 to 1250|last=1939-|first=Jones, Charles,|date=1988|publisher=C. Helm in association with Methuen|isbn=9780709914761|oclc=317750245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The fire and the continuations==

Today, the ''Peterborough Chronicle'' is recognised as one of the four distinct versions of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' (along with the ''Winchester Chronicle'' or ''Parker Chronicle'', the ''Abingdon Chronicle'' and the ''Worcester Chronicle''), but it is not wholly distinct ({{harvnb|Bennett|Smithers|1989|p=}}). There was a fire at Peterborough (Friday, 4 August 1116)&lt;ref&gt;Savage, A. ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles'' Colour Library Books. (1995) {{ISBN|1-85833-478-0}} page 249.&lt;/ref&gt; that destroyed the monastery's library, and so the earliest part of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' at Peterborough is a copy of [[Winchester Cathedral]]'s chronicle ({{harvnb|Ramsay|1898|p=}}). For the 11th century, the chronicle at Peterborough diverges from Parker's, and it has been speculated that a proto-''"Kentish Chronicle"'', full of nationalistic and regionalistic interests, was used for these years; however, such a single source is speculative ({{harvnb|Ward|Trent|1907–21|p=}}). The Peterborough copyists probably used multiple sources for their missing years, but the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] makes it impossible to be sure. Regardless, the entries for the 12th century to 1122 are a jumble of other chronicles' accounts, sharing half-entries with one source and half with another, moving from one source to another and then back to a previous one. This shifting back and forth raises, again, the vexatious possibility of a lost chronicle as a single, common source.

It is after 1122 that the Peterborough manuscript becomes unique. Therefore, the document usually called ''The Peterborough Chronicle'' is divided into the "''first continuation''" and the "''second continuation''" from the time of the fire and the copying. The two continuations are ''[[sui generis]]'' both in terms of the information they impart, the style they employ, and their language. The first continuation covers 1122–1131. The second continuation runs from 1132–1154 and includes the reign of King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]].

The copied portion uses grammatical gender and inflections like in Old English, but there are discrepancies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===First continuation (1122–1131)===

Although the second continuation holds the most importance, the first continuation has unique records of events in the Peterborough area and provides an insight into ordinary people's lives. The first continuation records the Conquest, the incursion of [[Sweyn III of Denmark|Sweyn]] of Denmark, and rumours of other turbulence about the throne. However, it has no evidence at all for [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] opposition and rebellion against William and his sons. An arguably eyewitness account describes the burning of Peterborough Abbey itself, due to the drunkenness of the monks. It also covers ecclesiastical scandals, such as the [[Abbot of Glastonbury]] bringing in [[mercenary|mercenaries]] to control his religious house. Further, there is a significant change in language from the previous late Old English that begins with the entry for the years 1122–1131, with mixtures of Old English and Middle English vocabulary (and increasing [[Gauls|Gallic]] formations) and syntax (a simplification of the pronouns and [[Germanic verb|strong verbs]], as well as a decrease in the [[declension]]s of the nouns).

Both the first and second continuation authors have sympathy for the common man. As Bennett suggests, Peterborough is the one source for compassion of the [[laity]] found in contemporary accounts.  The first continuation expresses as much outrage at the hanging of forty-four thieves in 1122, some of whom were innocent, as at the burning of the monastery at [[Gloucester]]. The monastic author suggests that taxes were too high, putting the impoverished villagers in a dilemma of stealing or starving. Therefore, the nobles were guilty of a double sin. First, they executed the innocent and used excessive cruelty with the guilty.  Second, it was at least as sinful for the nobles to compel theft with their avarice as for the poor to steal for bread. When the [[Normans|Norman]] king, [[Henry I of England]] foisted his kinsman upon Peterborough as abbot (he was already abbot of [[Saint-Jean d'Angély]]&lt;ref&gt;Cecily Clark, "'This Ecclesiastical Adventurer': Henry of Saint-Jean d'Angély" ''The English Historical Review'' '''84''' No. 332 (July 1969), pp. 548–560.&lt;/ref&gt;), the chronicler protests at some length at the illegality and impiety of the appointment. He also mentions that the [[Wild Hunt]] was seen at the same time as the appointment, as an ill omen. When Henry was eventually removed by death, the monk again takes the position that this was divine remedy, for Henry had tried to make Peterborough part of the [[Cluniac Order]] and had attempted to have his own nephew be the next abbot, "oc Crist it ne uuolde" ("but Christ did not will it").

The first continuation shows a major change in grammatical gender and inflections from how they were used in Old English. Though there are still 3 genders, masculine, feminine, and neuter, several nouns seem to have been shuffled among the categories in a manner that can't be completely explained by a move towards natural gender or the gender of French nouns, as the inflections marking gender are re-purposed for other functions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Second continuation (1132–1154)===

[[Image:Stephenblois.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The "softe and god" King Stephen, or Stephen of Blois, whom the Peterborough author blames for [[The Anarchy]].]]

The second, or final, continuation is remarkable for being in one authorial voice, and it relates the events of [[The Anarchy]] in England. Scholars speculate that the second continuation is dictated (because the language may reflect a version of early Middle English that scholars place later than Stephen and [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]]) or written as the recollections of a single elderly monk. It is a highly moving account of torture, fear, confusion, and starvation.

[[Henry I of England|Henry I]] died in 1135, and Stephen and Matilda both had a claim to the throne. The monastic author describes the rebellion of the [[baron]]s against Stephen, the escape of Matilda, and the tortures that the soldiers of the baronial powers inflicted upon the people. The author blames Stephen for the Anarchy for being "soft and good" when firmness and harshness were needed. When Stephen captured the rebelling barons, he let them go if they swore allegiance.  According to the author,
:"Þa the suikes undergæton ðat he milde man was and softe and god, and na iustise ne dide, þa diden hi alle wunder" (1137)
:: ("When the traitors understood that he (Stephen) was a gentle man, and soft and good, and did not execute justice, they committed all manner of atrocity.")

The barons then attempted to raise money as quickly as they could. They needed money and manpower to build [[castle]]s (which the author regards as novel and rare), and so they robbed everyone they met:
:"æuric rice man his castles makede and agænes him heolden; and fylden þe land ful of castles. Hi suencten suyðe þe uurecce men of þe land mid castelweorces; þa þe castles uuaren maked, þa fylden hi mid deoules and yuele men. Þa namen hi þa men þe hi wendan ðat ani god hefden, bathe be nihtes and be dæies, carlmen and wimmen, and diden heom in prisun and pined heom efter gold and syluer untellendlice pining; for ne uuaeren naeure nan martyrs swa pined alse hi waeron."
:: ("Every chieftain made castles and held them against the king; and they filled the land full of castles.  They viciously oppressed the poor men of the land with castle-building work; when the castles were made, then they filled the land with devils and evil men. Then they seized those who had any goods, both by night and day, working men and women, and threw them into prison and tortured them for gold and silver with uncountable tortures, for never was there a martyr so tortured as these men were.")

The monastic author sympathises with the average farmer and artisan and talks about the devastation suffered by the countryside. He is outraged by the accounts of torture he relates and laments,
:"Me henged up bi the fet and smoked heom mid ful smoke. Me henged bi the þumbes other bi the hefed and hengen bryniges on her fet. Me dide cnotted strenges abuton here hæued and uurythen it ðat it gæde to þe haernes… I ne can ne I ne mai tellen alle þe wunder ne all þe pines ðat he diden wrecce men on þis land."
:: ("One they hung by his feet and filled his lungs with smoke.  One was hung up by the thumbs and another by the head and had coats of mail hung on his feet.  One they put a knotted cord about his head and twisted it so that it went into the brains…  I neither can nor may recount all the atrocities nor all the tortures that they did on the wretched men of this land.")

Death and famine followed, as the farms were depleted and farmers murdered. If two or three riders came to a village, the monk said, everyone fled, for fear that they were robbers. Trade therefore came to a standstill, and those in want had no way to get supplies. Those travelling with money to purchase food would be robbed or killed along the way. The barons said that there was no God. The chronicler records that people said openly that Christ slept, along with His saints; he states that "this — and more than we can say — we suffered 19 winters for our sins."

After the account of The Anarchy, the chronicler goes on to church matters. He speaks of the abbot Martin, who replaced the illegitimate Henry, as a good abbot. Martin had a new roof put on the monastery and moved the monks into a new building. He also, according to the author, recovered certain monastic lands that had been previously held "by force" by noblemen. Which lands these are is unclear, but they had probably been claimed by the nobles through the practice of placing younger sons in monasteries, making and revoking gifts of land, and by some early form of [[chantry]]. The ''Chronicle'' ends with a new abbot entering upon the death of Martin, an abbot named William. This abbot presumably halted the writing of the ''Chronicle''.

Grammatical gender is almost completely gone, though Jones notes some authors consider the word ''that'' to still function as a neuter [[definite article]] here.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Unique authorial voice==

The two Peterborough continuations sympathise with the [[Poverty|poor]], and this makes them almost unique in Latin or English history. They also focus more on life outside of the abbey than other ''Chronicles''. The general ''Chronicle'' is somewhat insular. While most versions note the national events, such as a progress of the king or a change in sovereign, discussion of the countryside around the monastery is limited. Portents and omens receive coverage, but rarely do the chroniclers discuss political alliances (as the author of the second continuation does with his denunciation of the bishops who were allied with Matilda) or the legalities of monastic rule (as the author of the first continuation does in his lament over Abbot Henry). The monks who compiled the continuation at Peterborough were either consciously striking out in a new direction (perhaps under the direction of Abbot Martin) or continuing a type of chronicle that was confined to their own monastery (that was lost with the fire). It does not seem likely that Peterborough was in any sense a lax or secular monastery, as the description of drunkenness causing the fire would not have made the abbey singular in the age.

The continuations are also unique in their linguistic shifts. When copying from [[Winchester]], they preserve the [[orthography]] and [[syntax]] of late Old English, and when they get to events for which they have no copy text the language abruptly changes to a newer form. Given that the loan would have taken place just before the continuation, the change in language reflects either a dramatic attempt at greater [[vernacular]] by the continuation authors or a significant and quick change in the language itself as Norman influences spread.  Because the chronicle is in [[prose]], the artificiality of verse form does not entail the preservation of linguistic archaisms, and historians of English can trace the beginnings of Middle English in these pages.

==History of the manuscript==

The manuscript of the ''Chronicle'' is now held by the [[Bodleian Library]]. It was donated to the library by [[William Laud]], who was then [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of [[Oxford University]] as well as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], on 28 June 1639. Laud included the manuscript together with a number of other documents, part of the third of a series of donations he made to the library in the years leading up to the [[English Civil War]]. It is currently identified in the library catalogue as ''Laud Misc. 636''; previously it was designated as ''O. C. 1003'' based on the "Old Catalogue" by Edward Bernard.  The Bodleian has made a series of images of [http://bodley30.bodley.ox.ac.uk:8180/luna/servlet/view/all/what/MS.+Laud+Misc.+636?os=0&amp;pgs=250&amp;sort=Shelfmark%252Csort_order Laud Misc 636] available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1186">'''''Queen v Albert'''''&lt;ref&gt;(1895) 12 SC 272.&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South African criminal law]], especially as it applies to the defence of [[superior orders]]. It was heard in the Supreme Court of the Cape of Good Hope on August 5, 1895. The case had been sent up for review by the Resident Magistrate of Somerset West, under Act 20 of 1856.&lt;ref&gt;s 47.&lt;/ref&gt; It came before De Villiers CJ, as judge of the week.

De Villiers CJ held, and Upington J concurred that, a child under fourteen years of age who assists his father in committing a crime is presumed to do so in obedience to his father's orders, and is not punishable, even if he knew that he was doing a forbidden act—unless, in the case of a child above seven years of age, the crime was so heinous as obviously to absolve him from the duty of obedience.

'''Rashid Boudjedra''' ({{lang-ar|رشيد بوجدرة}}) (b. 5 September 1941 in [[Aïn Beïda, Oum El Bouaghi|Aïn Beïda]], Algeria) is an [[Algeria]]n poet, novelist, playwright and critic. Boudjedra wrote in French from 1965 to 1981, at which point he switched to writing in Arabic, often translating his own works back and forth between the two languages. Boudjedra returned to writing in French in 1992 and has continued to write in that language ever since. Educated in Constantine and in Tunis (at the [[Collège Sadiki]]), Boudjedra later fought for the FLN during the Algerian War of Independence. He received his degree in philosophy from the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], where he wrote a thesis on [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline|Céline]]. Upon receiving his degree, he returned to Algeria to teach, but was sentenced to two years in prison for his criticisms of the government and was exiled to [[Blida]]. He lived in France from 1969 till 1972, and then in [[Rabat]], [[Morocco]] until 1975.

Boudjedra's fiction is written in a difficult, complex style, reminiscent of [[William Faulkner]] or [[Gabriel García Márquez]] in its intricacy. ''La Répudiation'' (1969, "The Repudiation") brought him sudden attention, both for the strength with which he challenged traditional Muslim culture in Algeria and for the strong reaction against him. Because a [[fatwa]] was issued which called for his death, he felt he had to live outside of Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://perso.wanadoo.fr/calounet/biographies/boudjedra_biographie.htm A page, in French, that summarizes Boudjedra's life]&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2016}} He has routinely been called{{by whom|date=May 2016}} the greatest living North African writer.

Boudjedra was awarded the [[Prix du roman arabe]] in 2010 for ''Les Figuiers de Barbarie''.

Despite a dearth of English translations, two of his novels, ''Les Figuiers de Barbarie'' and ''Les Funérailles'' are currently being translated by [[André Naffis-Sahely]].

Rachid Boudjedra has also been involved in writing a number of films. ''[[Chronique des années de braise]]'' (''[[Chronicle of the Years of Fire]]''), (dir. by Mohamed Lakhdar-Hamina) which, in 1975 won the [[Palme d'or]] at the [[Cannes Festival]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1677">'''Reproduction fees''' are charged by [[image collections]] for the right to reproduce images in publications.  This is not the same as a copyright fee, but is charged separately, as is the cost of the provision of the image. It can be charged where an image is out of copyright, and reflects the possession of the image by a collection.

Image collection charges vary according to the media (books, magazines, TV, Internet etc.), and print run. Some charge a lower fee for [[not-for-profit]] publications. In the case of the Web, none appear to grant use  in perpetuity, but for small blocks of time &amp;mdash; 3 months, 6 months, etc. Some institutions employ specialist firms to administer their copyrights and reproduction fees.

In recent years the money asked per image can be so great as to make the publication of limited-market topics un-viable, by the time the other production costs are factored in. This is likely to have a deleterious effect on the future health of specialist academic publishing worldwide. The expansion of [[public domain]] image resources appear to be the way of overcoming this problem.

On the other hand, the fees can help a collection to balance its finances.

The '''Royal Almanac''' is a French administrative directory founded in 1683 by the [[bookseller]] Laurent d'Houry, which appeared under this title from 1700 to 1792, and under other titles until 1919.

He presented each year in the official [[order of precedence]], the list of members of the [[royal family]] of [[France]], the princes of blood, and the main body of the kingdom, great crown officers, senior clerics, abbots of large abbeys (with income of each abbey), marshals of France, colonels and general officers, ambassadors and consuls of France, presidents of the main courts, state councilors, bankers, etc..

Despite the fact that it could appear indigestible because of the many lists that it contained, the publication enjoyed a wide circulation with a readership consisting primarily of financiers, politicians, and all persons who had an interest in knowing the administrative organization of France.

Although his edition is due to the initiative of a private publisher, included in the lists of the Almanac was a royal official and abuse were therefore punished. Thus, a [[Poitou|Poitevin]], Pierre Joly, was interned in the [[Bastille]] at the end of the eighteenth century to have usurped the banking profession by being registered as such in the Almanach Royal.

His edition was in regular format in-8 o editor with a binder leather adorned with a sprinkling of [[fleur de lys]] gold.

==History==
===Founded at the request of King===
Laurent d'Houry imagines a calendar or [[Almanac]] 1683. The first edition contained only a few pages with a calendar and omens for the coming year. The last edition in this form, in 1699, already shows some lists that foreshadow the upcoming Royal Almanac. Thus we find lists of counselors of state with their ordinary homes, the commissioners of the Board, auditors general and stewards of finances, the Chancellor, archbishops and bishops of France, universities, and the list of major exhibitions, sessions of the courts of [[Paris]] and the log of the Palace, and finally addresses the messengers and items indicating the day of departure.

In 1699, [[Louis XIV]] asked him what the author describes in detail his work. Here as his widow explains these beginnings :

:"Louis XIV, who wanted this glorious memory Almanac, made him ask the author, who had the honor to present to Her Majesty's what induced him to give the title of Royal Almanac, &amp; to make it his principal occupation of this work. "

The same year [[Louis Tribouillet]], chaplain of the king and canon of [[Meaux]], publishes its State of France. This book describes in detail the functioning of the Court of the King, all his ministers, the treatments they receive, the various expenses of the state, clergy, etc..

The first edition of the Almanac Royal appears in 1700, at the same time as another book, Calendar of the Court of John Colombat, one of the printers of the King. Parisians have a choice between three books with similar content: the Almanach Royal Houry, Calendar of the Court of Colombat and the State of France Tribouillet. At that time, the yard around Louis XIV is highly stratified and since the expansion of the [[Palace of Versailles]] in 1684, it continues to grow. In this context, recognition of peers is a valuable asset "if someone has just placed a new post is an overflow of praise in its favor during the floods and the Chapel (...) but c is that while envy and jealousy talk like adulation.. One can understand the need to maintain directories so that everyone can follow the evolution of all these people. The multiplicity of these publications so says the king's will want to "officially" referencing his [[courtier]]s to charges created to keep beside him at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], and maintain the jealousies of each other.

Even if the king gave his approval, publishing such a book is not without risk. In December 1708, Laurent d'Houry is being prosecuted for having established a [[printing press]] in his house and forced to sell its equipment two months later. Then, in February 1716, he was imprisoned in the Bastille on complaint of the [[Earl of Stair]], the British Ambassador, "to be disrespectful in his almanac, the King George by not naming him not as king of England, or rather from Great Britain, and mention the king as son of Jacques II Stuart, exiled to St. Germain.

===Affirmation of a monopoly===
The Almanac and the Royal Court Calendar coexist peacefully for ten years and a lot of money to their authors, but from 1710, Laurent d'Houry integrates more and more topics like the book Colombat Biblio. The abscess broke out in 1717 when Houry Almanac releases its Abstract that will follow the format of the Calendar of the Court and simultaneously filing a [[lawsuit]] against its competitor. A Judgement of Solomon is made: if it is allowed to Houry now to continue the publication of its abstract and to counterfeit the Court Calendar, Colombat is obliged to freeze its calendar format and forbidden 'expand content. This stops any changes in the calendar of the Court, leaving the way open to the Almanac.

Upon the death of Laurent Houry in 1725, his family is [[destitute]]. Revenues from sales of the Almanac are not sufficient to cover expenses of printing and bookselling. In these circumstances, his widow, Elizabeth Dubois, took over the business. Their son Charles-Maurice, who had hitherto been a mere [[proofreader]] of the Almanac, is trying to evict her mother and she is suing cons. It prepares the edition of 1726 but a ruling forbade him to publish it in his name alone. The ruling of 11 December 1726 forbids even disturb the affairs of his mother and to participate directly or indirectly to the development of the Almanac. That is why Charles-Maurice is mentioned as editor of the Almanac on the edition of 1726.

In 1731, she filed a new lawsuit against Colombat which increased its schedule despite the prohibition of 1717. Unsuccessful, she resumed the publication of the Abstract and Colombat complaint in turn, she then accepts to abandon the publication of the Abstract "if returned to Colombat format from 1718. "The disputes have become extinct with the death of the parties.

The privilege of the Almanac is about to expire, Charles-Maurice d'Houry tries one last time to seize it, but a royal letter of 27 March 1744 confirmed definitively André-François Le Breton as sole heir.

==A family of hegemony 131 years==
===Directorate of André Le Breton===
In 1728, the widow of his grandson, Houry combines son André-François Le Breton, who was 18 years old and an orphan under the [[guardianship]] of Charles-Maurice d'Houry. Andrew Francis had inherited, according to the will of the estate of Lawrence Houry, half of the rights of the Almanac, and his widow, the rest.

Under his leadership, the Almanac takes a new breath and adds new sections, which sometimes does not go without punishment. For example, in 1768, he has trouble with [[Voltaire]], who sent him a letter incendiary:

:"I say as much to Le Breton, the Almanach royal printer: I'll pay him Almanac point that sold me this year. He had the rudeness to say that Mr. President... Mr. advisor..., remains in the cul-de-sac to Menard, in the cul-de-sac of the White Coats in the ass -de-sac de l'Orangerie. (...) How can you say that president remains in a serious ass?"

In 1773, Le Breton moved his print shop in a wing of the former Hotel d'Alegre, at 13 rue de Hautefeuille, he acquired William Louis Joly de Fleury and was previously occupied by Ambassador Portugal.

In the late eighteenth century, the weather is bad and bad [[wheat]] harvests. The price of this staple increases disproportionately. Recently, a rumor that the government would have the [[monopoly]] wheat, thus perpetuating the high cost of food. This rumor became official when accidentally in his edition of 1774, Le Breton added a "Treasurer's grain account of the King" in the person of Sr. Mirlavaud. The edition of the Almanac had yet been proofread and approved by the Chancellor, but was still sentenced to close his shop for 3 months and publish a revised edition, without the line in question,.

In 1777, Le Breton was again accused of inserting information deemed subversive. It has, according to its critics, cited "the Floral &amp; Pranks Vergès &amp; Vaucresson, among the prosecutors and attorneys general of the [[Parliament of Paris]], who had been involved in a reform of parliament made by Maupeou against the venality of Parliament desired by [[Louis XV]], but annulled by [[Louis XVI]]. In rebuke, Le Breton was sentenced to " carton "section on the Almanacs that had not yet been sold, and replacement cost, the Almanac issue of those who so request it."

He died on 4 October 1779 and his cousin, Charles-Laurent Houry, son of Charles-Maurice d'Houry, took over the business.

===French Revolution===
The privilege granted to the family of Houry for the Almanac has been threatened in 1789 when [[Camille Desmoulins]], in his speech at the Lantern to the Parisians, says it will cease in favor of Baldwin, another Parisian publisher. This threat has not been brought into effect since the Almanac remained in Houry. Looking at the publications of the time, we can nevertheless see that Baldwin got the impressions of the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] and other organs of state.

===Last generation Houry===
Following the death of Joan Nera, widow of Laurent-Charles Houry, the Almanac is echoed by Jean-François-Noël Debure, husband of Anne-Charlotte d'Houry, their daughter. Debure is from a prominent and wealthy family of Parisian booksellers, especially combined with the Didot family. It is a printer since 1784 with the title's printer [[Duke of Orleans]].

Debure takes time printing of the family of Houry, but his other business is in trouble and he is forced to file for [[bankruptcy]]. To keep the property inherited from his family, Anne-Charlotte d'Houry hires a separation procedure. In November 1791, the bankruptcy is declared and it is opposed to the [[creditor]]s to preserve his legacy, and this opposition is futile and a ruling allows creditors to seize his furniture, but that does not appear to have been necessary because a subsequent decision allows him to recover property that creditors have not taken her husband.

Francois-Jean-Noel Debure dies 1802 in [[Loiret]]. However, it is focused died from 1795 through various sources. Maybe it was just left without leaving an address.

Stephen Lawrence Testu worked as a clerk in the family home Debure since 1788, and had gradually won the confidence of the household. Because of the absence of Mr. Debure, Anne-Charlotte is alone with his two son. Despite their age difference, he is 20 years younger than she, she married Testu July 1795. Testu few highlights its knowledge in the profession to convince him to transfer the management of printing. It accepts in 1797 and offered him priority over the rights of the Almanac in exchange for a perpetual [[Annuity (European financial arrangements)|annuity]] of 800 francs, then she completely abandons the Almanac. This influx of money seems to turn the head Testu who play games and learn to enjoy the easy life, neglects the direction of its establishment and constantly running out of money, he contracted many loans that gradually ruining his business. Relations were strained with his wife because he left the marital home in September 1801 and the only ties that bind the couple are now linked to multiple trials they s'intentent.

In 1810, Testu secretly sold the rights of the Almanac in which he partnered with Guyot. Anne-Charlotte d'Houry opposes this sale she saw as a usurpation, but loses the case in 1812. She gets in return a pension of 1 200 francs Testu does not pay. Indeed, a decree of 1820 declares the debtor more than 90 000 francs... In 1814, due to the large sums invested by Guyot in the case, an order confirming the owner of the Almanac, a copy of this order is also printed at the end of the following books. Testu still gets Guyot repayment of its debts and an annuity of 2,400 francs.

Guyot dismisses Testu business in 1820 and continues even to pay his annuity. The latter, again running out of money turned in 1823 against his wife, calls it reaches the marital home and she pays all household expenses, or alternatively, that she pays rent of 6000 francs. Judges déboutent Testu the marital home, since he himself had deserted 22 years earlier and has no housing to offer his wife even though she already lives in a very beautiful but still require his wife, yet very rich, to pay him a pension of 1,800 francs by invoking the solidarity between spouses.

The [[hegemony]] of the family of Houry on the Almanac established in 1683 has finally ceased in 1814 when, by order, the company is transferred to the association Guyot-Testu. Anne-Charlotte d'Houry died 22 July 1828 aged about 83 years.

===Judgement of publishing===
In 1867, edition of the Almanac is transferred to the widow Berger-Levrault, who had already published the Yearbook of the French empire diplomatic, and military Yearbook of the French empire, both published as the Almanac according to documents provided by the administration.

The edition of the Almanac stops definitively in 1919 after four years of interruption due to war, the latter number includes the years 1915 to 1919. Not found in the literature the reasons that prompted the shutdown of publication, but it can be assumed that the combination of very large volume of the book (more than 1650 pages in 1900) and the hard times that the [[Economics]] and French policy at that time was to make the management of such a volume of information extremely complex and unprofitable for the publisher. It is also possible that the new government formed after elections in 1919 no longer supported the development of the Almanac.

==Changing content==
===The topics in the Almanac===
The Almanac or Calendar, as he was called in its early editions, was just a simple calendar which were associated topics on astronomical events, the days of fairs, the newspaper of the Palace, the residence of messengers The departure of the mails, the price of currencies and the list of collectors' offices. After his presentation to the king in 1699, many items are constantly being added including the clergy, the royal family of France, then the families of other sovereign nations, officers, ambassadors, etc..

In 1705, Houry added to the list of knights of the Holy Spirit and peer and marshal of France. In 1707, it is the state of the clergy and, in 1712, the birth of kings, princes and princesses of Europe. After the death of Louis XIV, the Duke of Orleans, became the Regent, is added to the list of members of the royal family of the members of the [[House of Orleans]]. Later, he put more of his own, the full house of the Queen and princes.

It is not possible to describe all items contained in an almanac as there, so the contents of 1780 covers ten pages:

The Almanac also stands abreast of scientific advances. In the middle of the eighteenth century, improving the accuracy of clocks and many wealthy fans begin to observe and study the stars. It is indispensable to know precisely the difference between true solar time of [[sundial]]s, and mean solar time clocks, especially since the advent of clocks seconds. This is the equation of the pendulum, also called the equation of time, the table is added shortly before 1750.

With the [[French Revolution]], the Almanac exchange of title and its content is modified to match the new institutions.

The abolition of all distinctions requires overhaul the topics, timing of the vulgar era is replaced by the [[French Republican Calendar|Republican calendar]], the place reserved for kings and princes of Europe is replaced by a note on the friendly powers of France, the administrative organs of royal power are replaced by new ministries.

The content changes again with the reforms of the Consulate and the Empire, the Restoration, the [[Hundred Days]], the [[July Monarchy]], the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] followed the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] and the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] who sees the end of the edition of Almanac. In each case, the bindings are supplied with the times.

As the number of entries is increasing, the number of pages follows the same trend: they numbered one hundred in 1699, nearly five-hundred in 1760, and seven-hundred just before the French Revolution. The course of a thousand pages is taken in 1840 to over 1000-6-cents in 1900. On average, about thirty names are listed per page, the total number of people or places listed annually in the tens of thousands, but no table patronymic does quickly find a particular name.

All changes in the Almanac makes it a very useful book for historians that may follow, year after year, ministries and other administrative bodies, movements of people in these offices, and retail organization public services to a resident of Paris (such as places of mailboxes, timetables and fares for ticks and royal messengers ).

===Chronology of the 237 years of publishing Almanacs===
After the death of Laurent Houry, his descendants continued his work until 1814. The edition was continued until 1919. It would be tedious to describe in words the evolution of the Almanac of the 237 years that have elapsed since the first edition by Laurent d'Houry in 1683, hence the choice of this table layout.

Throughout its existence, the Almanac has crossed 11 schemes political editor changed the title 14 times and 9 times.

==Publication==
===Collecting information===
Since its inception in 1700, following a royal demand, the Almanac invented by Laurent d'Houry aims to be an official handbook.

Until the French Revolution, contributors are cordially invited to provide information to the bookseller, as pointed note of the printer in the first pages of the Almanac. In 1771, for example, we read in the Journal History of the Revolution that the Bar Association in the person of a certain Gerbier, asserted that "there would be no change in the order of the table, and that it would be printed in the Almanac as Royal was last year, leaving out only the dead."

With the French Revolution, the order was given to government to provide all information to the publisher. In 1802, Testu gets even exclusivity.

Later, the collection of information for the Almanac is even part of the operating budget of the ministries and can be seen in order of December 31, 1844 signed by [[Louis-Philippe I]] "on the organization of the Ministry Administration Navy "Article 6 of which list the items in the budget" the formation of the Royal Almanac.

====Typography====
The print quality improves significantly when Laurent d'Houry became printer. It multiplies the bands and tail-lights to decorate and titles for sections. The Almanac is still very poor prints because the image is not its goal. Only that the reader can find are patterns explaining the oppositions of the planets and eclipses are present every year, and the map of [[departments of France]] editions of 1791 and 1792.

Despite the short time to prepare the book, the printer treats the presentation and uses in the case of many variations in size and shape of characters for easy reading of long lists, special characters to emphasize certain lines, compositions tables or columns and clusters in braces.

That Le Breton, grand son of Laurent Houry, who brings more to the book. It increases greatly and restructures the Almanac, and also improves its presentation in order to preserve readability. Many notes are added to guide the reader and help in understanding the operation of certain administrative bodies.

The Almanacs modern nineteenth-century advantage of technological advances. Cartoon characters are modernized and the use of fonts to graphics customizable multiplies, sometimes to excess: we can count at least 7 in 11 fonts fonts differ on the cover page of the National Almanac 1850 printed by Guyot et Scribe!

Announcements, the ancestors of [[advertising]], are introduced by the publisher Berger-Levrault in the late nineteenth century.

====Well-to-shoot====
The deadline for submitting this information to the editor is set to "first ten days of October (or November). The last-minute changes are incorporated in an erratum end of the book. When they are too large, they may even delay the release. In late December, an event is sent to the administration for approving the content. This approval is required before the sale.

It leaves only two months to integrate the information of the year in the text of the previous edition and call all of the pages before submitting the book for the right to shoot. The editing step, at least for the test in 1706, has not been done with great care as can be seen by very many shells and mistakes which have crept into the [[table of contents]] presented in thumbnail to the right.

Once the administrative agreement obtained, it is inserted end of the book, the Almanac is stapled or bound and is then distributed to customers at the end of the year.

===Printing===
Early Almanacs were not printed by Laurent d'Houry. The Almanac of 1706 and is printed by Jacques Vincent, installed Huchette street, at the sign of the Angel. November 15, 1712, Laurent Houry became printer and immediately began printing his work. Then all the almanacs will be printed by their publishers.

====Draw====
There is no source that explains the draw of the Almanac. The only figures available are the annual rents generated by sales.

In 1782, Mercier said a pension of more than 40 000 francs. Diderot, at the same time, puts the figure at 30,000 pounds. For a price of sale of 5 to 6 pounds, the draw must necessarily be greater than about 7500 almanacs.

Around 1820, during the trials that have brought the widow and Debure Testu, income of the Almanac was estimated between 25 and 30 000 francs. In 1834, another almanac, the Almanac of France, said that its cost is 35 cents for a sale price of 50 cents. Booksellers then purchase the item at prices of 38 cents, to resell a suggested retail price of 50 cents. The publisher earns so 3 cents per pound sold, the bookseller earns 12 (minus shipping costs, dependent). If one considers - arbitrarily - a four Almanac is sold directly into the library Testu (priced at 10 francs 50) the remainder being passed through intermediaries, we can prorate that to generate an annual income of 30 000 francs Testu must sell approximately 25 000.

In the absence of more precise information, we can only estimate at about 15,000, the number of copies sold per year between the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century.

====Binding====
The almanac is sold either stapled or bound by the printer. The [[paperback]] version allows the purchaser to connect his book as he wishes, and so it is possible to find books with bindings very ornate, with lace, weapons of families, many colors brightened or gilding Biblio 24, etc..

The bound version provided by the printer is usually presented in a bound in calf or Morocco,{{clarify|date=August 2012}} full, and lilies in the boxes back. With the revolution, the lilies are replaced with Phrygian caps in roundels Library 25.

====Distribution====
The Almanac is normally available from the bookseller, but it can also be found in the province in other bookstores that serve as intermediaries, for example in 1816, at Pesche, bookseller at Le Mans Ref 17, or by correspondence through the [[Sorbonne]], as did Voltaire Ref 18.

===Readership===
The Almanac has a very great interest because of the number of subjects it addresses the organization of the French administration. In 1785, Mairobert wrote that "the Almanach Royal is in the hands of everyone and is among the Princes, the King's office, the foreign ministers would cater Ref 19. Louis-Sebastien Mercier in a pamphlet, the Tableau de Paris that stands in 1782 Ref 20 explains that "Those who are thrown into the paths of ambition, study Almanac Royal with serious attention," "more a beautiful royal consult the almanac to see if her lover is a lieutenant or sergeant,... ", that" everyone is buying the almanac to find out exactly where they stand. "And finally" even Fontenelle said, that it was the book which contained the greatest truths."

Adages use the almanac as a reference. According to Jean-François de La Harpe is "the only book to read to get rich is the Royal Almanac Ref 21, [[Jean-Joseph Regnault-Warin]] uses the phrase" having the memory of a Royal Almanac Ref 22 " or the Memoirs of the Academy of hawkers Ref 23 explains that "it is enough to read the Almanac for education."

In the eyes of [[justice]], the book can be used as a basis for comparison: during a police investigation in 1824 Ref 24, a defendant defends himself by explaining that the volume of documents he was accused of having carried "could be equal to that of a royal Almanac almanac or a related trade."

Whether to have a certain level of resources to purchase this item, the customer extended beyond the financial and political world.

==Competition==
The Royal Almanac is competing at its inception with the Almanac of the Court of Colombat who can not make it evolve since 1717. In fact, bibliographers consider that the Royal Almanac is one of the "oldest and most helpful Ref 25". If it essentially describes the royal court and the Parisian institutions, other major cities also have their almanacs, such as the city of Lyon equally voluminous Ref 26. The Almanac is however considered a reference book. In 1780, a notice of a bookseller named Desnos inserted at the end of the Gazette of 27 offers for courts Ref 8 pounds to "the statesman, letters, and generally all persons attached to the service of the King (... ) Almanach Royal, Calendar of the Court, said Colombat, Mignone Strennas-Note 22, Ref 28, the State Military Note 23, the four connected units, with shelves &amp; stylus to write, which makes the closure ": the Royal Almanac ranks first in the collection.

===The Court Calendar===
Since 1717, the Calendar of the Court can not change, its sections are limited to an ephemeris of the celestial motions (30 years) increased by astronomical tables with sky conditions, and timing of the court to the family and royal house, lists of boards, departments and secretaries of state finances, births and deaths of kings, queens, princes and princesses of Europe, the knights of various orders, the archbishops and bishops of the kingdom and Cardinals of the Sacred College.

It is primarily sought for its ephemeris of the celestial motions and astronomical tables of events

===The Almanac of Commerce===
The Almanac of Business, published by Sébastien Bottin in the eighteenth century contains, besides the addresses of shops in Paris, many useful statistics financiers. It is supplementary to the Almanach royal, which concerns only the French administration.

===The State of France===
Some have criticized the Almanach Royal of being a [[plagiarism]] of the State of France, another administrative directory, the first publication seems to have been made in 1619 and is still published in the middle of the eighteenth century Ref 30. However, the edition of 1736 of the State of France said it was a "periodical whose audience has applied for renewal from time to time, and had been published until 1699, 1702, 1708, 1712, 1718 and 1727 Ref 31. The latest editions of 1727 and 1736 five volumes contain over 500 pages each. Offices are described down to the smallest detail Note 25, the state of France is a companion volume of the Almanach royal use by those who wish to deepen their knowledge on the functioning of the French administration.

==Examples of information contained in the Almanac==
Further details concerning the organization of the administration of the French state, and persons who occupied positions, many other topics are discussed in the Almanacs, for example in the eighteenth century:

===The cost of construction in Paris===
This section is only found in the Almanacs of the early eighteenth century, and stops just before 1726.

There are prices for masonry, carpentry and joinery, roofing, locksmithing, painting and glazing that are usually in Paris, for example:

:"Walls of circular pits, with layers of stone studded with low excess moilon quilted 18 inch thick, 22 pounds fquare fathom, and more in proportion to the depth of the wells, or other difficulties that may encounter."

With these data, the historian is able to quantify fully the construction of a building in Paris at that time.

===The official ceremonies===
The Almanac explains in great detail some official ceremonies:
* Opening Ceremony of the Annual Courthouse
:"The Entry of Parliament is the day after the S. Martin, 12 November, which day Presidents in red dresses holding their furs &amp; Mortar Note 26, &amp; Gowns Gentlemen Consultants red, after attending the solemn Mass that are usually said by a Bishop in the grand hall of the Palace, receive oaths of Lawyers &amp; Counsel. The first president made this day a speech to thank those who celebrated the Mass, which responds to him by another harangue Note 27."
* Procession of the University, whose description takes three pages of the Almanac Note 28
:"The Rector of the University at the end of its Rector, who regularly is only three months, indicating a general procession which assists the whole body. It is a ceremony that deserves to be seen. We will mark the place here What the doctors take the four faculties Note 29 that comprise the university, all the graduates of these faculties, with the Religious Orders Note 30. Procession from the Church of Religious Trinitarians, otherwise known as Maturin. (...) The procession is closed by the booksellers, papermakers, bookbinders, Parcherminiers, illuminators, writers swear by the University."

The detailed description of the ceremonies to stop mid-eighteenth century to make room for a still more comprehensive directory. A reference is then made towards the end of the book "guides for all kinds of ceremonies to be observed in the receipt of any office or employment whether in dress or in the Sword."

===Transportation===
Transportation of persons is ensured by the coaches, carriages, wagons and other carriages. Found in the Almanac schedules and rates of major roads.

In 1715, a passenger wishing to travel from Paris to [[Caen]] will go rue Saint-Denis on Monday at six o'clock in the morning. He has previously "sent his clothes the night before early." Fifteen years later, the starting time is advanced to 5 am in summer and in 1750, the departure is 5 hours throughout the year. In 1780, two flights are scheduled Tuesdays and Fridays at 23:30 and the journey takes two days. A van, slower, except Sunday at noon and made the trip in four and a half days in summer and five days in winter. In 1790, transportation is now provided by the General Department of stagecoaches and mail royal France. Three coaches liaise on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday and the van on Sunday. The departure is now Notre-Dame-des-Victoires.

Rates are rarely reported but in 1725 and 1761 is 18 pounds per person tournaments. He is 21 pounds in 1770 to reach 42 pounds in 1790 (fortunately for the traveler, it is stated that the "sleeping bag weighing 10 pounds is" free").

===Company guards of the King Pumps===
In 1716, the king appoints François Perrier Dumouriez as Director General of public pump to remedy fire, without the audience is obliged to pay anything. In 1722, he founded the Compagnie des Gardes Pumps du Roy, under the direction of the same. This company later became the Brigade of firefighters in Paris Note 32.

The Almanac of 1719 lists these pumps and their wardens and deputy wardens. We then learned that a brigade is made up of four guards and four sub-custodians who are responsible for maintaining the material deposited in each district. What became three years later the Society of King's Guards Pumps were not at that time that 41 people, 17 pumps distributed in groups of 8 men and 4 or 3 pumps in the City Hall, the convent of the Grands Augustins The Carmelite convent in the Place Maubert, Convent of Mercy, and the Fathers of Little Place des Victoires, in addition to a pump at the Director General of the pumps, Rue Mazarine. Except Dumouriez guards pumps are not professional fire but shoemakers, carpenters, locksmiths, etc..

==Considerations bibliophiles==
===Availability===
Almanacs are found regularly in auctions and in the antiquarian booksellers. Given their importance documentary and the fact that there are beautiful copies, these books are particularly sought after by historians, writers, bibliophiles and enthusiasts.

Volumes in the first round of the seventeenth century often exceed several thousand euros Ref 32, the other is generally negotiated between a few tens and five hundred euros, sometimes more, depending on their rarity, condition and quality bookbinding Note 33. Just over half are however available for free download on Gallica or Google Books:

===Notes handwritten readers===
Almanacs contain some handwritten notes left by their readers. The value of the book can then be influenced upward or downward depending on the quality and content of these notes, and especially the person who wrote them - when you can identify it. They are usually found on page intentionally left blank for the ephemeris. Some of these notes can provide very interesting information, such as notes written on the page in August 1715 a copy of the BNF. It relates the circumstances of the death of Louis XIV, who was suffering from gangrene Note 34:

:"We thought the death dez Roy Lundy 25. He marched
:better a day or two quoyque hopeless. It
:died after having suffered much and with great
:Patience on Sunday September 1, r t is 8 pm Morning
:M r le Duc d'Orleans went to Parl t and was declared
:Regent on 2. September e"

'''Set''' {{IPAc-en|s|ɛ|t}} or '''Seth''' {{IPAc-en|s|ɛ|θ}} (Egyptian: ''stẖ;'' also transliterated '''Setesh''', '''Sutekh''',&lt;ref&gt;Probably this is the lection of a god adored by the Hittites, the "Kheta", afterwards assimilated to the local Afro-Asiatic Seth. Sutekh appears, in fact, as a god of Hittites in the treaty declarations between the Hittite kings and Ramses II after the battle of Qadesh (see Archibald H. Sayce, "The Hittites: The Story of a Forgotten Empire"; also E. A. Wallis Budge, "A History of Egypt from the End of the Neolithic Period to the Death of Cleopatra VII B.C. 30".)&lt;/ref&gt; '''Setekh''', or '''Suty''') is a [[deity|god]] of chaos,  the [[desert]], [[storm]]s, disorder, violence, and foreigners in [[ancient Egyptian religion]].&lt;ref name="Ancient Egypt p. 269"&gt;Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt, vol. 3, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Greek]], the god's name is given as ''Sēth'' (Σήθ). Set had a positive role where he accompanies [[Ra]] on his [[Solar deity#Solar barge and sun chariot|solar boat]] to repel [[Apep]], the serpent of Chaos.&lt;ref name="Ancient Egypt p. 269"/&gt; Set had a vital role as a reconciled combatant.&lt;ref name="Ancient Egypt p. 269"/&gt; He was lord of the red (desert) land where he was the balance to [[Horus]]' role as lord of the black (soil) land.&lt;ref name="Ancient Egypt p. 269"/&gt;

In [[Egyptian mythology]], Set is portrayed as the [[usurper]] who killed and mutilated his own brother [[Osiris]]. Osiris' wife [[Isis]] reassembled (remembered) [[Osiris]]' corpse and resurrected her dead husband long enough to conceive his son and heir [[Horus]]. Horus sought revenge upon Set, and the myths describe their conflicts. This [[Osiris myth]] is a prominent theme in Egyptian mythology.

== Family ==
Set is the son of Geb, the Earth and Nut, the Sky; his siblings are Osiris, Isis, and Nephthys.  He married Nephthys and fathered [[Anubis]]; and in some accounts he had relationships with the foreign goddesses Anat, and Astarte.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt, vol. 3, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The meaning of the name ''Set'' is unknown but it is thought to have been originally pronounced *''sūtiẖ'' [ˈsuw.tixʲ] based on spellings of his name in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] as ''stẖ'' and ''swtẖ''.{{sfn|te Velde |1967 |pp=1–7}} The Late Egyptian spelling ''stš'' reflects the palatalization of ''ẖ'' while the eventual loss of the final consonant is recorded in spellings like ''swtj.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aaew2.bbaw.de/tla/servlet/GetWcnDetails?wn=600254|title=Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae |website=aaew2.bbaw.de|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Coptic language|Coptic]] form of the name, {{Coptic|ⲥⲏⲧ}} ''Sēt,'' is the basis for the English vocalization.{{sfn|te Velde |1967 |pp=1–7}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/coptic-dictionary/entry.cgi?entry=2733&amp;super=1095|title=Coptic Dictionary Online|website=corpling.uis.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Set animal==
{{main|Set animal}}
In [[art of ancient Egypt|art]], Set is usually depicted as an enigmatic creature referred to by [[Egyptologists]] as the ''[[Set animal]]'', a beast resembling no known creature, although it could be seen as a composite of an [[aardvark]], a [[donkey]], a [[jackal]] or a [[fennec fox]]. The animal has a curved [[snout]], long rectangular ears, a thin forked tail and [[Canidae|canine]] body, with sprouted fur tufts in an inverted arrow shape; sometimes, Set is depicted as a human with the distinctive head. Some early Egyptologists proposed that it was a stylised representation of the [[giraffe]], owing to the large flat-topped "horns" which correspond to a giraffe's [[ossicone]]s. The Egyptians themselves, however, made a distinction between the giraffe and the Set animal. During the Late Period, Set is depicted as a donkey or as having a donkey's head.{{sfn|te Velde |1967 |pp=13–15}}

The earliest representations of what might be the Set animal comes from a tomb dating to the [[Amratian culture]] ("Naqada I") of [[prehistoric Egypt]] (3790 BC–3500 BC), though this identification is uncertain. If these are ruled out, then the earliest Set animal appears on a [[ceremonial mace]]head of [[Scorpion II]], a ruler of the [[Naqada III]] phase. The head and the forked tail of the Set animal are clearly present.{{sfn|te Velde |1967 |pp=7–12}}

==Conflict of Horus and Set==
The next phase of the myth begins when the adult Horus challenges Set for the throne of Egypt. The contest between them is often violent but is also described as a legal judgment before the [[Ennead]], an assembled group of Egyptian deities, to decide who should [[royal succession|inherit]] the kingship. The judge in this trial may be Geb, who, as the father of Osiris and Set, held the throne before they did, or it may be the creator gods Ra or Atum, the originators of kingship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffiths|1960|pp=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other deities also take important roles: Thoth frequently acts as a conciliator in the dispute&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffiths|1960|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as an assistant to the divine judge, and in "Contendings", Isis uses her cunning and magical power to aid her son.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmann|2001|pp=135, 139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rivalry of Horus and Set is portrayed in two contrasting ways. Both perspectives appear as early as the ''Pyramid Texts'', the earliest source of the myth. In some spells from these texts, Horus is the son of Osiris and nephew of Set, and the murder of Osiris is the major impetus for the conflict. The other tradition depicts Horus and Set as brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffiths|1960|pp=12–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incongruity persists in many of the subsequent sources, where the two gods may be called brothers or uncle and nephew at different points in the same text.&lt;ref name="Assmann 134"&gt;{{harvnb|Assmann|2001|pp=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edfu47.JPG|thumb|right|Horus spears Set, who appears in the form of a hippopotamus, as Isis looks on]]
The divine struggle involves many episodes. "Contendings" describes the two gods appealing to various other deities to arbitrate the dispute and competing in different types of contests, such as racing in boats or fighting each other in the form of hippopotami, to determine a victor. In this account, Horus repeatedly defeats Set and is supported by most of the other deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lichtheim|2006b|pp=214–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the dispute drags on for eighty years, largely because the judge, the creator god, favors Set.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hart|2005|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late ritual texts, the conflict is characterized as a great battle involving the two deities' assembled followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pinch|2004|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strife in the divine realm extends beyond the two combatants. At one point Isis attempts to harpoon Set as he is locked in combat with her son, but she strikes Horus instead, who then cuts off her head in a fit of rage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lichtheim|2006b|pp=218–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thoth replaces Isis's head with that of a cow; the story gives a [[origin myth|mythical origin]] for the cow-horn headdress that Isis commonly wears.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, J. Gwyn, "Osiris", in {{harvnb|Redford|2001|loc=vol. II|pp=188–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a key episode in the conflict, Set sexually abuses Horus. Set's violation is partly meant to degrade his rival, but it also involves homosexual desire, in keeping with one of Set's major characteristics, his forceful, potent, and indiscriminate sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|te Velde|1967|pp=55–56, 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the earliest account of this episode, in a fragmentary Middle Kingdom papyrus, the sexual encounter begins when Set asks to have sex with Horus, who agrees on the condition that Set will give Horus some of his strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffiths|1960|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The encounter puts Horus in danger, because in Egyptian tradition semen is a potent and dangerous substance, akin to poison. According to some texts, Set's semen enters Horus's body and makes him ill, but in "Contendings", Horus thwarts Set by catching Set's semen in his hands. Isis retaliates by putting Horus's semen on lettuce-leaves that Set eats. Set's defeat becomes apparent when this semen appears on his forehead as a golden disk. He has been impregnated with his rival's seed and as a result "gives birth" to the disk. In "Contendings", Thoth takes the disk and places it on his own head; in earlier accounts, it is Thoth who is produced by this anomalous birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|te Velde|1967|pp=38–39, 43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important episode concerns mutilations that the combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes the eye is torn into pieces.&lt;ref name="Pinch 82"&gt;{{harvnb|Pinch|2004|pp=82–83, 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|te Velde|1967|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen [[Eye of Horus]] represents a wide variety of concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during [[lunar eclipse|eclipses]]. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him.&lt;ref name="Pinch 82"/&gt; The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge in the form of the Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|te Velde|1967|pp=43–46, 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, the restoration of the Eye of Horus to wholeness represents the return of the moon to full brightness,&lt;ref&gt;Kaper, Olaf E., "Myths: Lunar Cycle", in {{harvnb|Redford|2001|loc=vol. II|pp=480–482}}&lt;/ref&gt; the return of the kingship to Horus,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Griffiths|1960|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many other aspects of ''[[maat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pinch|2004|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the restoration of Horus's eye is accompanied by the restoration of Set's testicles, so that both gods are made whole near the conclusion of their feud.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|te Velde|1967|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protector of Ra==
[[File:Set speared Apep.jpg|thumb|Set [[spear]]s [[Apep]].]]
Set was depicted standing on the prow of [[Ra]]'s [[Atet|barge]] defeating the dark [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] [[Apep]]. In some [[Late Period of Egypt|Late Period]] representations, such as in the [[Twenty-seventh dynasty of Egypt|Persian Period]] [[Temple of Hibis]] at [[Kharga Oasis|Khargah]], Set was represented in this role with a [[falcon]]'s head, taking on the guise of [[Horus]]. In the ''[[Amduat]]'' Set is described as having a key role in overcoming [[Apep]].

==Set in the Second Intermediate and Ramesside Periods==
[[File:SethAndHorusAdoringRamsses crop.jpg|thumb|Set and [[Horus]] adore Ramesses in the small temple at [[Abu Simbel]].]]

During the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]] (1650–1550 BC), a group of Asiatic foreign chiefs known as the [[Hyksos]] (literally, "rulers of foreign lands") gained the rulership of Egypt, and ruled the [[Nile Delta]], from [[Avaris]]. They chose Set, originally Upper Egypt's chief god, the god of foreigners and the god they found most similar to their own chief god, as their patron. Set then became worshiped as the chief god once again. The Hyksos King [[Apepi (pharaoh)|Apophis]] is recorded as worshiping Set [[Monolatrism|exclusively]], as described in the following passage:

{{quote|text=[He] chose for his Lord the god Seth. He did not worship any other deity in the whole land except Seth.|author=''Papyrus Sallier 1 (Apophis and Sekenenre)''&lt;ref&gt;''Papyrus Sallier 1 (Apophis and Sekenenre)'', 1.2–3, ed. Gardiner 1932&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jan Assmann]] argues that because the ancient Egyptians could never conceive of a "lonely" god lacking personality, Seth the desert god, who was worshiped on his own, represented a manifestation of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Of God and Gods: Egypt, Israel, and the Rise of Monotheism |first=Jan |last=Assmann |pages=47–48 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-299-22550-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When, c. 1522 BC, [[Ahmose I]] overthrew the Hyksos and expelled them, Egyptians' attitudes towards Asiatic foreigners became [[xenophobia|xenophobic]], and royal propaganda discredited the period of Hyksos rule. The Set cult at Avaris flourished, nevertheless, and the Egyptian garrison of Ahmose stationed there became part of the priesthood of Set.

The founder of the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]], [[Ramesses I]] came from a military family from Avaris with strong ties to the priesthood of Set. Several of the Ramesside kings were named after the god, most notably [[Seti I]] (literally, "man of Set") and [[Setnakht]] (literally, "Set is strong"). In addition, one of the garrisons of [[Ramesses II]] held Set as its patron deity, and Ramesses II erected the so-called ''Four Hundred Years' Stele'' at [[Pi-Ramesses]], commemorating the 400-year anniversary of the Set cult in the Delta.

Set also became associated with foreign gods during the [[New Kingdom]], particularly in the Delta. Set was also identified by the Egyptians with the [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]] deity [[Teshub]], who, like Set, was a storm god.

==Demonization of Set==
[[File:Relief Herihor Seth obliterated.jpg|thumb|140px|Set on a late New Kingdom relief from Karnak: his figure was erased during his demonization.]]
According to Herman te Velde, the demonization of Set took place after Egypt's conquest by several foreign nations in the [[Third Intermediate Period|Third Intermediate]] and [[Late Period of Ancient Egypt|Late Periods]]. Set, who had traditionally been the god of foreigners, thus also became associated with foreign oppressors, including the [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] and [[Persian Empire|Persian]] empires.{{sfn|te Velde |1967 |pp=138–140}} It was during this time that Set was particularly vilified, and his defeat by Horus widely celebrated.

Set's negative aspects were emphasized during this period. Set was the killer of Osiris, having hacked Osiris' body into pieces and dispersed it so that he could not be [[resurrection|resurrected]]. The Greeks would later associate Set with [[Typhon]], a monstrous and evil force of raging nature. Both were sons of deities representing the Earth ([[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and [[Geb]]) who attacked the principal deities ([[Osiris]] for Set, [[Zeus]] for Typhon).

Nevertheless, throughout this period, in some outlying regions of Egypt, Set was still regarded as the heroic chief deity.

Set has also been classed as a [[trickster]] deity who, as a god of disorder, resorts to deception to achieve bad ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=2009 |title=The Trickster Revisited: Deception as a Motif in the Pentateuch |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2hke4LUD4QC&amp;pg=PA16 |first=Dean Andrew|last=Nicholas |series=Studies in Biblical Literature |volume=117 |pages=16–17 |publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-1-4331-0226-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temples==
Set was worshipped at the [[Egyptian temple|temples]] of [[Ombos]] (Nubt near Naqada) and Ombos (Nubt near [[Kom Ombo]]), at Oxyrhynchus in upper Egypt, and also in part of the [[Fayyum]] area.

More specifically, Set was worshipped in the relatively large metropolitan (yet provincial) locale of [[Sepermeru]], especially during the Ramesside Period.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Sauneron, Priests of Ancient Egypt, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; There, Seth was honored with an important temple called the "House of Seth, Lord of Sepermeru". One of the epithets of this town was "gateway to the desert", which fits well with Set's role as a deity of the frontier regions of ancient Egypt. At Sepermeru, Set's temple enclosure included a small secondary shrine called "The House of Seth, Powerful-Is-His-Mighty-Arm", and Ramesses II himself built (or modified) a second land-owning temple for Nephthys, called "The House of Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun".{{sfn|Katary|1989|p=216}}

There is no question, however, that the two temples of Seth and Nephthys in Sepermeru were under separate administration, each with its own holdings and prophets.{{sfn|Katary|1989|p=220}} Moreover, another moderately sized temple of Seth is noted for the nearby town of Pi-Wayna.{{sfn|Katary|1989|p=216}} The close association of Seth temples with temples of Nephthys in key outskirt-towns of this ''milieu'' is also reflected in the likelihood that there existed another "House of Seth" and another "House of Nephthys" in the town of Su, at the entrance to the Fayyum.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, Papyrus Wilbour Commentary, S28, pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps most intriguing in terms of the pre-Twentieth Dynasty connections between temples of Set and nearby temples of his consort Nephthys is the evidence of [[Papyrus Bologna]], which preserves a most irritable complaint lodged by one Pra'em-hab, Prophet of the "House of Seth" in the now-lost town of Punodjem ("The Sweet Place"). In the text of Papyrus Bologna, the harried Pra'em-hab laments undue taxation for his own temple (The House of Seth) and goes on to lament that he is also saddled with responsibility for: "the ship, and I am likewise also responsible for the House of Nephthys, along with the remaining heap of district temples".&lt;ref&gt;Papyrus Bologna 1094, 5,8–7, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unfortunate, perhaps, that we have no means of knowing the particular theologies of the closely connected Set and Nephthys temples in these districts—it would be interesting to learn, for example, the religious tone of temples of Nephthys located in such proximity to those of Seth, especially given the seemingly contrary Osirian loyalties of Seth's consort-goddess. When, by the [[Twentieth Dynasty]], the "demonization" of Seth was ostensibly inaugurated, Seth was either eradicated or increasingly pushed to the outskirts, Nephthys flourished as part of the usual Osirian pantheon throughout Egypt, even obtaining a Late Period status as tutelary goddess of her own Nome (UU Nome VII, "Hwt-Sekhem"/Diospolis Parva) and as the chief goddess of the Mansion of the Sistrum in that district.&lt;ref&gt;Sauneron, Beitrage Bf. 6, 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Le temple d'El-Qal'a.

Yet it is perhaps most telling that Seth's cult persisted with astonishing potency even into the latter days of ancient Egyptian religion, in outlying (but important) places like Kharga, Dakhlah, Deir el-Hagar, Mut, Kellis, etc. Indeed, in these places, Seth was considered "Lord of the Oasis/Town" and Nephthys was likewise venerated as "Mistress of the Oasis" at Seth's side, in his temples{{sfn|Kaper|1997b|pp=234–237}} (esp. the dedication of a Nephthys-cult statue). Meanwhile, Nephthys was also venerated as "Mistress" in the Osirian temples of these districts, as part of the specifically Osirian college.{{sfn|Kaper|1997b|pp=234–237}} It would appear that the ancient Egyptians in these locales had little problem with the paradoxical dualities inherent in venerating Seth and Nephthys as juxtaposed against Osiris, Isis, and Nephthys. Further study of the enormously important role of Seth in ancient Egyptian religion (particularly after the Twentieth Dynasty) is imperative.

'''Marcel Gauthier'''&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; (July 21, 1928 &amp;ndash; November 6, 1998) was a Canadian professional [[midget wrestler]] who worked as '''Sky Low Low'''. At a small 3 foot, 7 inches, he is the smallest superstar in WWE history.

==Professional wrestling career==
Known by his midget wrestler persona "Sky Low Low", Gauthier stood just 42&amp;nbsp;inches tall and weighed 86 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]].&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; He began wrestling in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; He made his debut in the Canadian [[National Wrestling Alliance]], and soon claimed the [[NWA World Midget Championship]] in [[Paris, France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwi-online.com/pages/wrestlingframe.html|title=Wrestling History: 1998|website=[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]|access-date=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was managed for the bulk of his career by [[Jack Britton]], father of [[Gino Brito]].&lt;ref name=slam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBios/skylowlow.html|title=Canadian Hall of Fame: Sky Low Low|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2009-03-04|author=Oliver, Greg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauthier and [[Lionel Giroux|Little Beaver]] squared off in a match for [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] and [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk of Egypt]].&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; He was touring with the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] as late as the 1980s.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;

One of his gimmicks was an open challenge to any other midget professional wrestlers to beat him in a [[two out of three falls match]] for $100.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; He could also stand on his head without using his hands to balance himself.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

He had a longtime feud with [[Farmer Brooks]].

==Personal life==
During [[World War II]], he worked in the tail of an aircraft bomber, fixing rivets.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; He liked fishing, golfing, and horseback riding.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; He died on November 6, 1998 from a heart attack.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; He was married at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; He was posthumously inducted into the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;

'''Vtape'''  is a [[Canadian artist-run centres|Canadian artist-run centre]] located in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].

Vtape's collection features more than 1000 artists and consists of conceptual art videos, video art installation, performance-based works, and social issue documentaries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vtape.org/about-vtape&lt;/ref&gt; All artists distributed by Vtape maintain full ownership of their work, and the organization does not require exclusive distribution rights. This model is seen in other Canadian video art distribution organizations [[Video In Video Out (arts organization)|Video In Video Out]] and [[Videopool]].&lt;ref name="Quanz" /&gt;

Vtape was established in 1980 by artists [[Lisa Steele]], Susan Britton, Rodney Werden, [[Clive Robertson (artist)|Clive Robertson]] and [[Colin Campbell (artist)|Colin Campbell]] with the mission to improve the distribution and dissemination of video art and to compensate artists fairly for their work. It was incorporated as a not-for-profit in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.vtape.org/history|website=www.vtape.org|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vtape provided organizational assistance for independent art exhibitions throughout the 1980s and 1990s during conditions of intensive censorship of artists' film and video works by the Government of Ontario.&lt;ref name="AGOSteele"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vtape’s Toronto New Work Shows Revisited - Program 1 {{!}} AGO Art Gallery of Ontario|url=https://www.ago.net/vtape1|website=www.ago.net|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aboriginal Collection==
Vtape began a dedicated collection of video works by Aboriginal artists in 1994, after being approached by [[Zachary Longboy]]. It is the only specialized collection within the organization, and the only collection at Vtape that will accept works on film and works by first-time artists. Longboy helped develop the collection as Vtape's Aboriginal outreach coordinator, and was succeeded by [[Cynthia Lickers-Sage]]. As outreach coordinator, Lickers-Sage broadened the collection's reach through the establishment of the [[ImagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival|imagineNative Film Festival]] in 1998. The foundation of the [[Aboriginal Digital Access Project]] in 2012 broadened access to this special collection by allowing curators from around the world to preview video and film works online, rather than at the archive in person.&lt;ref name="Quanz" /&gt;

'''Vukajlija''' is a popular [[Serbia]]-based web site very similar to [[Urban Dictionary]] in content. As such, the site mainly consists of often humorous definitions, observations and (not rarely vulgar) explanations of [[slang]] terms from a more local point of view that the one on Urban Dictionary.

The name Vukajlija is itself a [[word play]] on Vujaklija, the surname of Serbian linguist [[Milan Vujaklija]] whose most notable work is ''Lexicon of foreign words and terms'' (''Leksikon stranih reči i izraza'', ''Лексикон страних речи и израза''), first published in 1937. In the [[Balkans]], dictionaries are often colloquially known by the names of their author and thus Vujaklija's dictionary is known as ''Vujaklija'', leading to the word play in question. Also, the similarity in names may have contributed to early popularity of the site, as a number of people searching for Vukajlija in error instead of Vujaklija reached the site.

'''Web indexing''' (or '''Internet indexing''') refers to various methods for indexing the contents of a [[website]] or of the [[Internet]] as a whole. Individual websites or [[intranet]]s may use a [[back-of-the-book index]], while [[search engines]] usually use keywords and [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]] to provide a more useful vocabulary for Internet or onsite searching. With the increase in the number of [[periodical]]s that have articles online, web indexing is also becoming important for periodical websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Indexing the Web {{!}} American Society for Indexing|url = http://www.asindexing.org/reference-shelf/indexing-the-web/|website = www.asindexing.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back-of-the-book-style web indexes may be called "web site A-Z indexes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Advanced Computing, Networking and Informatics- Volume 1: Advanced Computing and Informatics Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Advanced Computing, Networking and Informatics (ICACNI-2014)|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qjwqBAAAQBAJ|publisher = Springer|date = 2014-05-26|isbn = 9783319073538|language = en|first = Malay Kumar|last = Kundu|first2 = Durga Prasad|last2 = Mohapatra|first3 = Amit|last3 = Konar|first4 = Aruna|last4 = Chakraborty}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication with "A-Z" is that there is an alphabetical browse view or interface. This interface differs from that of a browse through layers of hierarchical categories (also known as a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]]) which are not necessarily alphabetical, but are also found on some web sites. Although an A-Z index could be used to index multiple sites, rather than the multiple pages of a single site, this is unusual.

Metadata web indexing involves assigning keywords or phrases to web pages or web sites within a [[metadata tag]] (or "meta-tag") field, so that the web page or web site can be retrieved with a search engine that is customized to search the keywords field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Advanced Computing, Networking and Informatics- Volume 1: Advanced Computing and Informatics Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Advanced Computing, Networking and Informatics (ICACNI-2014)|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qjwqBAAAQBAJ|publisher = Springer|date = 2014-05-26|isbn = 9783319073538|language = en|first = Malay Kumar|last = Kundu|first2 = Durga Prasad|last2 = Mohapatra|first3 = Amit|last3 = Konar|first4 = Aruna|last4 = Chakraborty}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may or may not involve using keywords restricted to a controlled vocabulary list. This method is commonly used by [[search engine indexing]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1835">A '''work method statement''', sometimes referred to as a '''safe work method statement''' or '''SWMS''' or a '''[[Safe Work Procedure|safe work procedure]]''', is a part of a [[Occupational safety and health|workplace safety]] plan.&lt;ref name="Workcover NSW" /&gt; It is primarily used in construction to describe a document that gives specific instructions on how to safely perform a work related [[Task (project management)|task]], or operate a piece of plant or equipment. In many countries it is law to have work method statements, or similar, in place to advise employees and contractors on how to perform work related tasks safely.&lt;ref name="Workcover NSW"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.workcover.nsw.gov.au/formspublications/publications/Pages/WC00231_WritingWorkMethodStatementsinPlainEnglis_.aspx | title=Writing work method statements in plain English: Guidelines | accessdate=April 3, 2011 | date=Feb 1998 | publisher=WorkCover Authority NSW Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement is generally used as part of a safety induction and then referred to as required throughout a workplace, they should outline all the hazards that are likely to be encountered when undertaking a task or process and provide detailed guidance on how to carry out the task safely...

==Procedure for use==
A work method statement is prepared for each task on a particular worksite, the group of work method statements are then packaged and is typically submitted at the beginning of a project for approval by the client or their representative.

==Contents==
The work method statement encompasses the following:
# purpose
# [[Scope (project management)|scope]]
# references

{{EngvarB|date=April 2016}}

'''Y-stations''' were British [[signals intelligence]] collection sites established during the [[World War I|First World War]] and used again during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://antiqueradios.com/chrs/journal/intelligence.html Y-stations in World War I]&lt;/ref&gt; The sites were operated by a range of agencies including the [[British Army|Army]], [[Royal Navy|Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] plus the [[Foreign Office]] ([[MI6]] and [[MI5]]), [[General Post Office]] and [[Marconi Company]] receiving stations ashore and afloat.

==Background==
The "Y" stations tended to be of two types, for intercepting of the signals and for identifying where they were coming from. Sometimes both functions were operated at the same site, with the [[direction finding]] (D/F) hut being a few hundred metres from the main interception building, because of the need to minimise interference. The sites collected radio traffic which was then either analysed locally or if [[encryption|encrypted]], passed for processing initially to [[Admiralty]] [[Room 40]] in [[London]] and during World War II to the [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] at [[Bletchley Park]] in Buckinghamshire.

[[File:1943 Arkley View Front.jpg|thumb|Arkley View 1943]]

In the Second World War a large house called "Arkley View" on the outskirts of [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]] (now part of the [[London Borough of Barnet]]) acted as a data collection centre, where traffic was collated and passed to Bletchley Park and it also acted as a Y station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Pidgeon |first = Geoffrey |title = The Secret Wireless War: The Story of MI6 Communications 1939–1945 |publisher = UPSO |url=http://www.upso.co.uk |year = 2003 |isbn = 1-84375-252-2 | oclc = 56715513 |chapter=15. Box 25 - The RSS and Hanslope |pages=103–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[amateur radio]] (ham) operators supported the work of the Y stations, being enrolled as "Voluntary Interceptors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Popular Communications]] |date=December 2013 |volume=32 |issue=4 |title=The Secret Listeners of 'Box 25, Barnet' |author=R.B. Sturtevant, AD7IL |pages=22–26 |issn=0733-3315 |publisher=CQ Communications, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Much of the traffic intercepted by the Y stations was recorded by hand and sent to Bletchley by motorcycle couriers and later by [[teleprinter]], over post office [[land line]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, J., (2000) ''England Needs You: The Story of Beaumanor Y Station World War II'' Cheam, published by Joan Nicholls&lt;/ref&gt; The name derived from Wireless Interception (WI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McKay |first=Sinclair |publisher=Aurum Press Ltd |title=The Secret Listeners |date=2012 |isbn=978-1-78131-079-3 |location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also used for similar stations attached to the India outpost of the Intelligence Corps, the [[Wireless Experimental Centre]] (WEC) outside [[Delhi]].

==Direction-finding Y stations==
[[File:1945 Lydd HF DF Station - Louis Varney G5RV second from left.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lydd]] HF Direction Finding Station 1945 Captain Louis Varney G5RV 2nd from left]]
Specially constructed Y stations undertook direction finding on wireless transmissions. This became particularly important in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] where locating [[U-boats]] was vital. [[Admiral Dönitz]] told his commanders that they could not be located if they limited their wireless transmissions to under 30 seconds but skilled D/F operators were able to locate the origin of their signals in as few as six seconds.

The design of land-based D/F stations preferred by the [[Allies in World War II]] was the [[Adcock antenna|U-Adcock system]], which consisted of a small, central operators' hut that was surrounded by four {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} vertical aerial poles, usually placed at the four [[points of the compass|compass points]]. Aerial feeders ran underground and came up in the centre of the hut and were connected to a direction finding [[goniometer]] and a wireless receiver, that allowed the bearing of the signal source to be measured. In the UK some operators were located in an underground metal tank. These stations were usually in remote places, often in the middle of farmers' fields. Traces of World War II D/F stations can be seen as circles in the fields surrounding the village of [[Goonhavern]] in Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&amp;q=hendra%20croft&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl The operators huts can still be seen in the centre of the circles.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yellow Pages Limited''' (formerly '''Yellow Pages Income Fund''' and '''Yellow Media''') is a digital company in Canada. Yellow Media owns and operates some Canadian properties and publications including Yellow Pages directories, YellowPages.ca, and Canada411.ca. Its online destinations reach approximately 9 million of unique visitors monthly and its mobile applications for finding local citizens, downloaded over 3 million times. The company was founded following the buyout of [[Bell Canada]]'s directory business and subsequently acquired SuperPages Canada, the directory publisher for [[Telus]].

In October 2008, Yellow Pages was named one of "[[Canada's Top 100 Employers]]" by Mediacorp Canada Inc. and was featured in ''[[Maclean's]]'' newsmagazine, the only directory publisher to receive this honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluta.ca/top-employer-yellow-pages|title=Reasons for Selection, 2009 Canada's Top 100 Employers Competition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Yellow Pages sold [[Trader Corporation]] to funds advised by [[Apax Partners]] for $745 million.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Wauters. "[https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/25/yellow-media-sells-vertical-media-publishing-subsidiary-for-745-million-in-cash/ Yellow Media Sells Vertical Media Publishing Subsidiary for 745 million in Cash]." ''TechCrunch'', March 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Its ticker symbol changed from YLO to Y in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.financialpost.com/investing/once-staggering-under-2b-in-debt-yellow-media-looks-to-ride-brand-recognition-to-new-growth|first=Christine|last=Dobby|title=Once staggering under $2B in debt, Yellow Media looks to ride brand recognition to new growth|newspaper=Financial Post|date=May 14, 2014|access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16, 2018, it was announced that Yellow Pages would cut 18% otherwise, one fifth of its workforce. That very same day, approximately 500 employees were laid off nation-wide. According to its new CEO David Eckert, such measures were essential to ensure short-term financial health of the company, whose stock price took a significant nosedive over the year 2016–2017.

Its headquarters is located at 1751 Richardson Street in Montreal Québec.

==Dividend controversy==

Yellow Media is considered by some Canadian financial writers to be a prime example of why investors should be skeptical of high dividend yields.&lt;ref&gt;John Heinzl. "[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investor-community/trading-shots/how-not-to-invest-in-2013/article6603920/ How not to invest in 2013]." ''The Globe and Mail'', December 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, the company maintained a high dividend yield despite close scrutiny,&lt;ref&gt;John Heinzl. "[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/yellow-medias-dividend-under-the-microscope/article597402/ Yellow Media's dividend under the microscope]."
