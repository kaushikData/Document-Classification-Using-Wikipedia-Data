      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2159">'''Alberto Baldrich''' (January 20, 1898 – December 19, 1982) was an Argentine philosopher and [[sociologist]] who served as Minister of Justice and Public Instruction (1944–45) during the de facto presidency of General [[Edelmiro Farrell]] (1944–46).

==Biography==
He was born in [[Buenos Aires]], the son of General Alonso Baldrich.  He was one of the original members of the Institute of Sociology at the Faculty of Arts at the [[University of Buenos Aires]], created and directed in 1940 by [[Ricardo Levene]]. His intellectual circle included Hector Bernard, Adolfo Silenzio de Stagni, Federico Ibarguren, and Ramón Doll.

Baldrich was appointed financial comptroller of [[Tucumán Province]] by the de facto President, General [[Pedro Pablo Ramírez]], in 1943, and in 1944 he was appointed Minister of Justice and Public Instruction by President Farrell, replacing [[paleoconservative|conservative Catholic]] writer [[Hugo Wast|Gustavo Martinez Zuviría]]. His administration continued the nationalist elitist line Martínez began, but was more geared to [[Hispanism]] and [[economic nationalism]]. He appointed as Assistant Secretary of Education, working with Adolfo Silenzio de Stagni; during the Revolution of 1943, he adhered himself to [[Peronism]]. Following [[Juan Perón]]'s return from exile in 1973, he was appointed education minister of [[Buenos Aires Province]] by the newly elected Governor, [[Oscar Bidegain]]. Baldrich died in Buenos Aires in 1982.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3120">'''Alun Munslow''' (born 1947) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[historian]] known for his [[deconstructionist]] and [[postmodernist]] approach to [[historiography]]. He is Professor Emeritus of History and Historical Theory at [[Staffordshire University]]. He is also Visiting Professor at the University of Chichester. His argument is that prior to engaging with the past historians need to acknowledge that the past and history do not share the same ontic and epistemic space. He suggests that the past is the time before our perpetual present and 'history' is that range of authored narratives we substitute for it. Munslow suggests that the consequences of this argument are substantial and not the least among them being the situation that we can only engage with the aesthetics of 'historying' because we cannot access the ontic and epistemic nature of the past. The way to avoid that situation is to fuse – or as he argues - the historian should not (con)fuse the past with history. The past is the 'before now' and the past cannot anticipate the future. He accepts that this may seem ironic – and happily it is – the reason being that history is a singularly unprivileged authorial act undertaken in the perpetual present about the ineffable past. He is the author of a number of texts on the philosophy of history including 'Discourse and Culture: The Creation of America, 1870-1920' (1992), 'Deconstructing History' (1997), 'The New History' (2003), 'Narrative and History' (2007, Second Edition 2018), 'The Future of History' (2010), 'A History of History' (2012) and 'Authoring the Past' (2013). He was the UK Founding Co-Editor of the journal 'Rethinking History: The Journal of Theory and Practice' relinquishing its UK Editorship in 2017.   &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83761973.html|title=Where Does History Come from? Munslow argues that the centrality of narrative to 'history/historying' confronts the constructionist and reconstructionist understandings of how the past is evaluated and constituted. He suggests that the past cannot be (con)fused with the past, arguing that the past has no direct ontic or epistemic connection to the past.

'''At the Hub''' ({{lang-he|'''בַּעֲבִי הַשִּׁיר: מבחר שירים'''}}, [[romanization of Hebrew|tr.]] '''''Ba-'avi ha-shir: Mivhar shirim''''') is a lengthy [[2007 in poetry|2007]] [[modern Hebrew poetry|Hebrew]] [[political poetry|political poem]] written by [[Uri Zvi Greenberg]] and edited by [[Dan Miron]] and Greenberg's widow {{ill|Aliza Greenberg–Tur-Malka|he|עליזה גרינברג}}. Its publishing was made possible with the help of the [[Menachem Begin Heritage Center]], the [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Education]], the [[Ministry of Culture and Sport (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Culture and Sport]], the {{ill|Yehoshua Rabinovich Foundation for the Arts, Tel Aviv|he|קרן יהושע רבינוביץ לאמנויות תל אביב}}, and, the {{ill|Mifal HaPais Council for the Culture and Arts|he|מועצת הפיס לתרבות ולאמנות}}.

==Reception==
Writing for the far-leftist newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'', {{ill|Ariel Hirschfeld|he|אריאל הירשפלד}} from Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Hebrew literature department called the poem "one of the highest peaks of Hebrew poetry", and compared Greenberg's work to those of [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]], [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]], [[Dahlia Ravikovitch]], [[James Joyce]], Dr. [[Nathan Zach]], [[Franz Kafka]], Dr. [[Yitzhak Laor]], [[W. B. Yeats]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Osip Mandelstam]], and, [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], "as, his work is equal to theirs," adding that the poem "is a wellspring of rare beauty and wisdom," and is "the most profound confrontation written in Hebrew with man's breakdown during the [[20th century]], including the dissolution of [[History of the Jews in Europe|European Jewry]] during [[World War II]], which is man's shattered mirror."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=11 July 2007|script-title=he: ספר הראי המנופץ: מסע אל כמה מפסגותיה הגבוהות ביותר של השירה העברית|trans-title=The Book of the Shattered Mirror: A Journey Into Some of Hebrew Poetry's Highest Peaks|last=Hirschfeld|first=Prof. Dr. Ariel|url=http://haaretz.co.il/1.1425034|language=Hebrew|work=Haaretz|location=[[Tel Aviv]]|page=16|publisher=[[M. DuMont Schauberg]]|access-date=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also writing for ''Haaretz'', critic Dr. Oreet Meital opined that Dr. Miron attempted, via the aforementioned footnotes, to depoliticize Greenberg's poem: "Uri Zvi Greenberg's poetry should not lose, upon moving from the fringes to the mainstream, its provocative, violent, and, paradoxical nature, for, its canonization, especially if done so tendentiously and deliberately, is a castrating mechanism working against the text's subversiveness and against the wild dimension which is part of its magic and essence. Hence, one should be wary of this [[whitewashing (censorship)|whitewashing]] rendering Uri Zvi Greenberg anemic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=23 September 2007|script-title=he:המחיר שאצ״ג יצטרך לשלם כדי להיות ביאליק|trans-title=The Price Uri Zvi Greenberg Will Have to Pay in Order to Become Hayim Nahman Bialik|last=Meital|first=Dr. Oreet|url=http://haaretz.co.il/1.1444277|pages=18–19|volume=761|language=Hebrew|work=Haaretz|location=Tel Aviv|publisher=M. DuMont Schauberg|access-date=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for the right-leaning magazine ''{{ill|Nativ: A Journal of Politics and the Arts|he|נתיב (כתב עת)}}'', critic Dr. {{ill|Yoram Beck|he|יורם בק}} underscored that "at a time during which talks of a clash of civilizations are common, Uri Zvi Greenberg's ideas seem relevant more and more, however, we still do not completely understand their implications," for, "Uri Zvi Greenberg's poetry is a poetry of heights, a poetry of a deep soul which demands, both from itself and from others, extraordinary demands, and, one cannot be at the presence of this poetry comfortably. This poetry, first and foremost (surprisingly!), is bestowed by a zest for life — not a hedonistic but an ecstatic one — and, it embraces all layers of life: from the mundane to the historical, from the material to the spiritual, from the erotic to the religious. Uri Zvi Greenberg constructs his poetry out of all of life. This is a poetry of complete freedom, in which the poet allows himself (this is the correct expression) to use all [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]], all associations, and, all literary forms, in order to express himself," as, "this is a poetry of loneliness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=September 2007|script-title=he:תִּגָּר וְתִּגְרָה|trans-title=Distrust and Dispute|last=Beck|first=Dr. Yoram|url=http://acpr.org.il/nativ/articles/2007_4-5_book-reviews.pdf|language=Hebrew|work=Nativ: A Journal of Politics and the Arts|pages=96–97|volume='''117–118'''|issue='''4–5'''|location=[[Sha'arei Tikva]]|publisher={{ill|Ariel Center for Policy Research|he|מרכז אריאל למחקרי מדיניות|sh|Centar Ariel za politička istraživanja}}|access-date=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ataraxia''''' (ἀταραξία, literally, "unperturbedness", generally translated as "imperturbability", "equanimity", or "tranquillity") is a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] philosophical term for a lucid state of robust [[equanimity]] that was characterized by ongoing freedom from distress and worry. 

Achieving the state of ''ataraxia'' was a common goal for many [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek philosophies]]. As a result, the term plays an important role in many different Ancient Greek philosophical schools. The use of the term ''ataraxia'' to describe a state free from mental distress is similar throughout these different schools, but the role of the state of ''ataraxia'' within a philosophical school varied depending on the school's own philosophical theory. The mental disturbances that prevented one from achieving ''ataraxia'' often varied between schools, and each school often had a different understanding as to how to achieve ''ataraxia.'' Some schools valued ''ataraxia'' more highly than others. Three schools that often employed the term ''ataraxia'' within their philosophies were [[Epicureanism]], [[Pyrrhonism]], and [[Stoicism]].  

==Epicureanism==
''Ataraxia'', considered by [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] to be freedom from mental discomfort, was a key component of the Epicurean conception of the highest good.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=117-121}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ataraxia'' was extremely important to Epicurean ethics, since Epicurean ethics, like almost all other Greek philosophies, was concerned with determining the nature of and reaching the highest good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epicureans valued ''ataraxia'' so highly because of how they understood pleasure. Epicureans argued that pleasure was the highest good, and they broke pleasure down into two categories: the physical and the mental.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; They considered mental, not physical, pleasures to be greatest sort of pleasure because physical pleasures exist only in the present and mental pleasures exist in the past, the present, and the future.&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=118-119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epicureans further separated pleasure into what they called '''kinetic''' and '''katastematic''' pleasures.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=119-120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinetic pleasures are those pleasures which come about through action or change.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics: An Introduction to Hellenistic Philosophy|last=Sharples|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=91-92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an action could be satisfying a desire or removing a pain, as that very sort of act is pleasurable in itself.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicurus and Democritean Ethics: An Archaeology of Ataraxia|last=Warren|first=James|publisher=University of Cambridge|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actions that feel good, even if not done to satisfy a desire or remove a pain, such as eating good-tasting food, also fall under the category of kinetic pleasures.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Mental pleasures could also be kinetic in nature. Epicurus is said to have described joy as an example of a kinetic mental pleasure.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Katastematic pleasure is pleasure which comes about from the absence of pain or distress.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This sort of pleasure could be physical or mental. Physical katastematic pleasures comes in freedom from physical disturbances, such as simply being in the state of not being thirsty.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Comparatively, mental katastematic pleasure comes in freedom from mental disturbance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Those who achieved freedom from physical disturbance were said to be in a state of ''[[aponia]]'', while those who achieved freedom from mental disturbances were said to be in a state of ''ataraxia''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Katastematic pleasures were regarded to be better than kinetic pleasures by Epicurus, believing that one could feel no more pleasure than the removal of all pain.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, he is reported to have said,&lt;blockquote&gt;"The magnitude of pleasure reaches its limit in the removal of all pain. When pleasure is present, so long as it is uninterrupted, there is no pain either of body or of mind or of both together."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/diogenes_laertius-lives_eminent_philosophers_book_x_epicurus/1925/pb_LCL185.529.xml?mainRsKey=isX55s&amp;result=1&amp;rskey=1igPmJ|title=Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Volume II: Books 6-10|last=Laertius|first=Diogenes|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1925|isbn=|location=Cambrdige, MA|pages=665|translator-last=Hicks|translator-first=R. D.|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Being both a mental and katastematic pleasure, ''ataraxia'' retained a supreme importance in Epicurean ethics and was key to a person's happiness.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Under the Epicurean system, a person would experience the highest form of happiness should they ever be both in a state of ''aponia'' and ''ataraxia'' at the time.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Pyrrhonism==
[[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonists]] viewed ''ataraxia'' as a state of mental tranquility, and they felt that not only could Pyrrhonism lead to ''ataraxia,'' but also that the tranquility of that ''ataraxia'' would bring about happiness for a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Machuca|first=Diego E.|date=2006|title=The Pyrrhonist's Ἀταραξία and Φιλανθρωπία.|url=|journal=Ancient Philosophy|volume=vol. 26, no. (1)1|pages=114|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Pyrrhonists felt that this sort of happiness, one resulting from the tranquility of ''ataraxia'', was life's ultimate purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicurus and Democritean Ethics: An Archaeology of Ataraxia.|last=Warren|first=James|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyrrhonists offered multiple arguments for how Pyrrhonism could lead to ''ataraxia''. The general form of these arguments was that by refraining from all judgment, a Pyrrhonist would not be perturbed by anything and enter into a state of tranquility. The Pyrrhonist [[Timon of Phlius|Timon]] supposedly pointed to the life of [[Pyrrho]] as an example of Pyrrhonism leading to ''ataraxia''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Striker|first=Gisela|date=1990|title=ATARAXIA: HAPPINESS AS TRANQUILLITY.|url=|journal=The Monist|volume=vol. 73, no. 1|pages=102-103|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Timon, because Pyrrho remained skeptical and made no judgements about the world, he was able to successfully live a peaceful and undisturbed life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other Pyrrhonists also gave arguments for how Pyrrhonism can lead to ''ataraxia''. [[Sextus Empiricus]] gave a number of arguments for why Pyrrhonism leads to ''ataraxia''. In ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism,'' Sextus Empiricus argues that by making judgments about what is good and what is bad, an individual causes themselves to be disturbed since they will be distressed when they lack the good things and will constantly worry about losing those good things should they ever come into possession of them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Machuca|first=Diego E.|date=2006|title=The Pyrrhonist's Ἀταραξία and Φιλανθρωπία|url=|journal=Ancient Philosophy|volume=vol 26. no(1)1|pages=113|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"For the person who believes that something is by nature good or bad is constantly upset; when he does not possess the things that seem to be good, he thinks he is being tormented by things that are by nature bad, and he chases after the things he supposes to be good; then, when he gets these, he falls into still more torments because of irrational and immoderate exultation, and, fearing any change, he does absolutely everything in order not to lose the things that seem to him good. But the person who takes no position as to what is by nature good or bad neither avoids nor pursues intensely. As a result, he achieves ataraxia."&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, "The Skeptic Way", Trans. Benson Mates,  Book I, Ch. XII, "What Is the Goal of Skepticism?", p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Sextus Empiricus offers further variations on this core argument to explain why Pyrrhonism could lead to ''ataraxia''. Among such arguments, he claimed that even when one has good things, one would still feel troubled because the enjoyment of good things often comes from being the sole person with access to those things, and one might have anger or jealous feelings towards others who also have those same things.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Stoicism==
In [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophy]], the mental tranquility that was ''ataraxia'' was not the ultimate goal of life. Instead, a life according to nature was the goal of life.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Striker|first=Gisela|date=1990|title=ATARAXIA: HAPPINESS AS TRANQUILLITY|url=|journal=The Monist|volume=vol. 73, no. 1|pages=99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, ''ataraxia'' was still an important part of Stoic philosophy. Although ''ataraxia'' was not an explicit goal of Stoicism, stoics felt that by living in accordance with nature, one would also end up in a state of ''ataraxia''.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; In essence, ''ataraxia'' was a byproduct of a virtuous life.

An important distinction to be made is the difference in Stoicism between ''ataraxia'' and the Stoic idea of ''[[apatheia]].'' While closely related to ''ataraxia'', the state of ''apatheia'' was the absence of unhealthy passions; a state obtained by the ideal [[Sage (philosophy)#In Stoicism|Stoic sage]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven K. Strange, (2004), ''The Stoics on the Voluntariness of Passion'' in ''Stoicism: Traditions and Transformations'', page 37. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This is not the same as ''ataraxia''. ''Apatheia'' describes the freedom from the disturbance of emotions, not tranquility of the mind.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Striker|first=Gisela|date=1990|title=ATARAXIA: HAPPINESS AS TRANQUILLITY|url=|journal=The Monist|volume=vol. 73, no. 1|pages=100-101|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''apatheia'' was integral for a Stoic sage to reach the stage of ''ataraxia''. Since the Stoic sage does not care about matters outside of himself and is not susceptible to emotion because of his state of ''apatheia'', the Stoic sage would be unable to be disturbed by anything at all, meaning that he was in a stage of mental tranquility and thus was in the state of ''ataraxia''.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''Bishop's House''' is a [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat house]] for the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], located on the island of [[Iona]], off the west coast of [[Scotland]]. 

==History==
It was built in 1894, when [[Iona Abbey]] was still in ruins, to provide a place for [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Scottish Episcopalians]] on the island. It was originally called Saint Columba's House, after the chapel at its centre dedicated to Saint [[Columba]].&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; It was established under Bishop [[Alexander Chinnery-Haldane]], [[Bishop of Argyll and The Isles (Episcopal)|Bishop of Argyll and The Isles]] from 1883 to 1906, a year after the tenancy was granted by the [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|9th Duke of Argyll]], as a place of "prayer, study, contemplation and Eucharist".&lt;ref name="craft"&gt;MacArthur (2002), pp.192,251&lt;/ref&gt; Despite protests from the local established church minister the house continued to be supported by the Duke and the Bishop. Thanks to Bishop Chinnery-Haldane’s close involvement with the project, the house became known as the Bishop's House, a title which has stuck.&lt;ref&gt;MacArthur (2002), p.193&lt;/ref&gt;

The House was occupied by members of the [[Society of Saint John the Evangelist]] from 1896-1906. Despite the minister's fears they were seeking [[proselyte]]s, they seem to have been more interested in avoiding the roof leaking and finding space for contemplation.&lt;ref name="craft"/&gt; Known locally as "Cowley Fathers", they ran services and held tea parties for the islanders.&lt;ref&gt;MacArthur (1997) pp.46-47&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been run as a [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat house]] for the Scottish Episcopal Church, most recently by their subsidiary group Island Retreats Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.island-retreats.org/iona.html| title=Bishop's House, Iona| publisher=Island Retreats| accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chapel is open to the public and holds two services daily from March to October, and weekly in the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argyll.anglican.org/churches/iona/|title=Iona – St Columba’s Chapel, at Bishop’s House |publisher=Diocese of Argyll and the Isles |accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Boston Confucians''' are a group of [[New Confucianism|New Confucians]] from [[Boston]], of whom the best known are [[Tu Wei-Ming]] of [[Harvard]], and [[John Berthrong]] and [[Robert Neville (Boston University)|Robert Neville]] of [[Boston University]].

==Boston Confucianism==
Boston Confucianism refers to those who hold that [[Confucianism]] could be successfully adapted to a [[Western philosophy|Western perspective]]. Confucianism is seen as a tradition with rich spiritual and cultural resources that can inform other world traditions. Boston Confucianism also argues for the transportability of Confucianism to geographical locations beyond Asia proper. The internationalized character of Boston Confucianism is to a great extent a central feature in the second generation of the New Confucians. Both [[Platonism]] and [[Christianity]] began as such portable traditions, which could be practiced outside of the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Jew]]ish roots which originally generated them.

However, this is a view that is common to New Confucians in general, whether from Boston, [[Beijing]], [[Taipei]], [[Hong Kong]] or [[Singapore]].  Indeed, there are contemporary advocates of Confucianism who are not New Confucians, but who would agree that Confucianism is not geographically or culturally parochial, any more than Buddhism or Islam have been. [[Philip J. Ivanhoe]], [[Joel J. Kupperman]] and [[David B. Wong]] would fall into this latter category. Consequently, "Boston Confucian" is a term more closely linked to geography than intellectual content. Boston Confucianism seeks to explore different applications of Confucianism in the age of globalization/

The school of Boston Confucianism has become especially well known in academic circles in China. Chinese scholars see it as the first indication of Confucianism's ability to be enthusiastically endorsed by non-Asian North-American scholars and theologians for non-academic purposes.

A Facebook closed group named "Friends from Afar: A Confucianism Group" was established in 2015 [https://www.facebook.com/groups/confucian.friends/] Furthermore, a Facebook open group called "Ruism Discussion Group: Confucianism in America" was started in 2016. [https://www.facebook.com/groups/645630138944913/about/]. Dr. Bin Song has published a range of articles in The Huffington Post about Boston Confucianism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bin-song/&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Song received a Ph.D. from Boston University and now teaches at Washington College [https://www.washcoll.edu/live/profiles/13655-bin-song]. 

==Key texts==
In his 1988 essay "The Meaning of Life", Tu Wei-ming (1988) writes that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Copernicus decentered the earth, Darwin relativized the god-like image of man, Marx exploded the ideology of social harmony, and Freud complicated our conscious life. They have redefined humanity for the modern age. Yet they have also empowered us, with a communal, critical self-awareness, to renew our faith in the ancient Confucian wisdom that the globe is the center of our universe and the only home for us, and that we are the guardians of the good earth, the trustees of the mandate of Heaven that enjoins us to make our bodies healthy, our hearts sensitive, our minds alert, our souls refined and our spirits brilliant [...] We are here because embedded in our human nature is the secret code for heaven’s self-realization. Heaven is certainly omnipresent, may even be omniscient, but is most likely not omnipotent. It needs our active participation to realize its own truth. We are heaven’s partners, indeed co creators. We serve heaven with common sense, the lack of which nowadays has brought us to the brink of self-destruction. Since we help heaven to realize itself through our self-discovery and self-understanding in day-to-day living, the ultimate meaning of life is found in our ordinary human existence.&lt;ref&gt;Tu Wei-ming, "[http://www.maryellenmark.com/text/magazines/life/905W-000-037.html The Big Picture: The Meaning of Life]". ''[[Life Magazine|Life]]'' (December 1988) No. 14, 76-101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"The Western Inscription" by the 11th century Confucian [[Chang Tsai]] is a favorite of the Boston Confucians,{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} as it points toward ecological concerns:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Heaven is my father and earth is my mother, and even such a small creature as I finds an intimate place in their midst. Therefore, that which extends throughout the universe I regard as my body and that which directs the universe I consider as my nature. All people are my brothers and sisters and all things are my companions. Respect the aged...Show affection toward the orphaned and weak...The sage identifies his character with Heaven and earth, and the virtuous man is best. {among the children of Heaven and earth}. Even those who are tired and infirm, crippled and sick, those who have no brothers or children, wives or husbands, are all my brothers who are in distress and have no one to turn to.&lt;ref&gt;http://fore.yale.edu/religion/confucianism/texts/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Universalism}}
'''Brahmoism''' is a religious movement from the late 19th century Bengal originating the [[Bengali Renaissance]], the nascent [[Indian independence movement]]{{according to whom|date=February 2018}} and the wider [[Hindu reform movements]] of the period. Adherents, known as ''[[Brahmo]]s'' (singular Brahmo), are mainly of [[India]]n or [[Bangladesh]]i origin or nationality. The [[Brahmo Samaj]], literally the "Divine Society", was founded as a movement by [[Ram Mohan Roy]]. Placing great importance on the use of reason, he aimed to reform Hindu religious and social practices, being influenced by the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religions and modern science.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Chambers Dictionary Of World History. Editor BP Lenman. Chambers. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental principles==

The [[Brahmo]] articles of faith derive from the Fundamental (''Adi'') Principles of the ''[[Adi Brahmo Samaj]]'' religion.
* On God: There is always Infinite (limitless, undefinable, imperceivable, indivisible) Singularity - immanent and transcendent Singular Author and Preserver of Existence - "He" whose Love is manifest everywhere and in everything, in the fire and in the water, in the smallest plant to the mightiest oak.
* On Being: Being is created from Singularity. Being is renewed to Singularity. Being exists to be one (again) with Loving Singularity. (''See [[Tat Tvam Asi]]''.)
* On Intelligent Existence: Righteous (worshipful, intelligent, moral) actions alone rule (regulate [preserve]) Existence against Chaos (loss [decay, return, pervading emptiness]). Knowledge (Intelligence [reason, sentience, intuition]) of pure Conscience (light within) is the One (Supreme) ruler (authority [law, dharma]) of Existence with no symbol (creation [scripture, book, object]) or intermediary (being [teacher, messiah, ruler]).
* On Love: Respect all creations and beings but never venerate (worship) them for only Singularity can be loved (adored, worshipped).&lt;ref&gt;[http://brahmosamaj.org Brahmo Samaj Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Articles of faith===

The Articles of faith for Brahmos are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://brahmosamaj.org/ brahmosamaj.org - BRAHMO SAMAJ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Brahmos embrace righteousness as the only way of life.
* Brahmos embrace truth, knowledge, reason, free will and virtuous intuition (observation) as guides.
* Brahmos embrace secular principles but oppose sectarianism and imposition of religious belief into governance (especially propagation of religious belief by government).
* Brahmos embrace the co-existence of Brahmo principles with governance, but oppose all governance in conflict with Brahmo principles.
* Brahmos reject narrow theism (especially polytheism), idolatry and symbolism.
* Brahmos reject the need for formal rituals, priests or places (church, temple, mosque) for worship.
* Brahmos reject dogma and superstition.
* Brahmos reject scriptures as authority.
* Brahmos reject revelations, prophets, gurus, messiahs, or avatars as authority.
* Brahmos reject bigotry and irrational distinctions like caste, creed, colour, race, religion which divide beings.
* Brahmos reject all forms of totalitarianism.
* Brahmos examine the prevalent notion of "sin".
* Brahmos examine the prevalent notions of "heaven" or "hell".
* Brahmos examine the prevalent notion of "salvation".

Adherence to these articles are required only of ''Adi'' Brahmos or such ''Sadharan'' Brahmos who accept ''Adi''-ism i.e. [[Trust deed of Brahmo Sabha]] (1830).

==History==
[[Ram Mohan Roy]]'s quest for religious truth had led him to study with an open mind the scriptures of all major religions. Thus he not only studied the Hindu scriptures such as the Vedas in Sanskrit; he also read the Quran in Arabic and the Bible in Hebrew and Greek. His study of different religions convinced him that since every religion had the same end, namely, the moral regeneration of mankind, each stood in need of reinterpretation and reassessment in changing circumstances of the time. Therefore, he thought there was no reason for him to give up Hinduism and accept any other religion. He accepted the universal moral teachings of every religion but without its dogma, ritual and superstition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ahmed |first=AF Salahuddin |year=2012 |chapter=Brahma Sabha |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Brahma_Sabha |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Ram Mohan Roy aimed at reforming [[Hinduism]] from within, his successor Maharshi [[Debendranath Tagore]] in 1850 rejected the authority of the Vedas and thus broke with [[Āstika and nāstika|orthodox Hinduism]]. Tagore tried to retain some Hindu customs, but a series of schisms eventually resulted in the formation of the [[Sadharan Brahmo Samaj]] in 1878.

In 1901, a decision of the [[Privy Council]] of [[British India]] found that "the vast majority of Brahmo religionists are not Hindus and have their own religion".&lt;ref&gt;Official website http://brahmosamaj.org/ "In 1901 (Bhagwan Koer &amp; Ors v J.C.Bose &amp; Ors, 31 Cal 11, 30 ELR IA 249) the Privy Council (Britain's highest judicial authority) upholds the finding of the High Court of the Punjab that the vast majority of Brahmo religionists are not Hindus and have their own religion"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brahma Dharma was first codified by Debendranath Tagore with the formulation of the [[Brahmo Dharma Beej]] and publication of the ''Brahma Dharma'', a book of 1848 or 1850 in two parts. The Brahma Dharma is the source of every Brahmo's spiritual faith and reflects [[Brahmo]] repudiation of the Hindu Vedas as authority and the shift away from Ram Mohan Roy's Vedantic Unitary God per the Adi Shankara Advaita school. The traditional seed principles and Debendranath's ''Brahmo Dharma'' (or religious and moral law) now stand evolved as the "Fundamental Principles of Brahmoism" and are supplemented by precise evolving rules for adherents, akin to "Articles of Faith" which regulate the Brahmo way of life. In addition the assembly of Brahmos (and also Brahmo Samajists) for meeting or worship is always consonant with the Trust Principles of 1830 or its derivatives.

'''Carlo Ludovico Ragghianti'''  (18 March 1910 – 3 August 1987) was an Italian art critic, historian, philosopher of art and politician.

Born in [[Lucca]], Ragghianti studied in [[Pisa]], where he was a pupil of {{Interlanguage link multi|Matteo Marangoni|it}}. His education was influenced by [[Benedetto Croce]] and by his theory of "pure visibility"; then he approached and deepened the theories of [[Konrad Fiedler]], [[Alois Riegl]], [[Julius von Schlosser]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;Raffaele Bruno (cured by). ''Ragghianti critico e politico''. Franco Angeli, 2004. {{ISBN|88-464-6277-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He started his career as a scholar in 1933 with essays on [[the Carracci]] and [[Giorgio Vasari]]; later he wrote on cinema and entertainment industry as expressions of visual art, thus demonstrating his interest in all manifestations of the visual language. In 1935 he founded together with Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli the magazine ''Critica d'arte''.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;Raffaele Bruno (cured by). ''Ragghianti critico e politico''. Franco Angeli, 2004. {{ISBN|88-464-6277-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ragghianti was among the founders of the [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]] and after September 8, 1943 he organized armed resistance in [[Tuscany]]. He was president of the Tuscan [[National Liberation Committee]] and headed the liberation of [[Florence]] on November 8, 1944.&lt;ref name=ffo&gt;Giorgio Spini, Antonio Casali.

'''Cladistics''' ({{IPAc-en|k|l|ə|ˈ|d|ɪ|s|t|ɪ|k|s}}, from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|κλάδος}}, ''cládos'', "branch")&lt;ref name="OnlineEtDict"&gt;{{cite web|title=clade|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=clade&amp;searchmode=none|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an approach to [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological classification]] in which [[organism]]s are categorized in groups ("[[clade]]s") based on the [[most recent common ancestor]]. Hypothesized relationships are typically based on shared derived characteristics ([[synapomorphies]]'')'' that can be traced to the most recent common ancestor and are not present in more distant groups and ancestors. A key feature of a clade is that a common ancestor and all its descendants are part of the clade. Importantly, all descendants stay in their overarching ancestral clade. For example, if within a ''strict'' cladistic framework the terms animals, bilateria/worms, fishes/vertebrata, or monkeys/anthropoidea would be used, these terms would include humans. Many of these terms are normally used [[Paraphyly|paraphyletically]], outside of cladistics, e.g. as a '[[Evolutionary grade|grade]]'. [[Evolutionary radiation|Radiation]] results in the generation of new subclades by bifurcation.&lt;ref name=ce&gt;Columbia Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ucmp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/clad/clad1.html |title=Introduction to Cladistics |publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ode&gt;Oxford Dictionary of English&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oed&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

The techniques and nomenclature of cladistics have been applied to other disciplines.  (See [[phylogenetic nomenclature]].)

Cladistics is now the most commonly used method to classify organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/clad/clad5.html|title=The Need for Cladistics|website=www.ucmp.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original methods used in cladistic analysis and the school of taxonomy derived from the work of the German [[entomologist]] [[Willi Hennig]], who referred to it as '''phylogenetic systematics''' (also the title of his 1966 book); the terms "cladistics" and "clade" were popularized by other researchers. Cladistics in the original sense refers to a particular set of methods used in [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analysis, although it is now sometimes used to refer to the whole field.{{sfn|ps=|Brinkman|Leipe|2001|p=323}}

What is now called the cladistic method appeared as early as 1901 with a work by [[Peter Chalmers Mitchell]] for birds&lt;ref&gt;Schuh, Randall. 2000. Biological Systematics: Principles and Applications, p.7 (citing Nelson and Platnick, 1981).

Div. 225-52 (kfolinsb.public.iastate.edu)&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently by [[Robert John Tillyard]] (for insects) in 1921,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Trees of life: Essays in the philosophy of biology|last = Craw|first = RC|publisher = Kluwer Academic|year = 1992|isbn = 978-94-015-8038-0|location = Dordrecht|pages = 65–107|editor-last = Griffiths|editor-first = PE|chapter = Margins of cladistics: Identity, differences and place in the emergence of phylogenetic systematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Walter Max Zimmerman|W. Zimmermann]] (for plants) in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Schuh, Randall. 2000. Biological Systematics: Principles and Applications, p.7. Cornell U. Press&lt;/ref&gt;
The term "[[clade]]" was introduced in 1958 by [[Julian Huxley]] after having been coined by [[Lucien Cuénot]] in 1940,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cuénot|1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; "cladogenesis" in 1958,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Webster's 9th New Collegiate Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; "cladistic" by [[Arthur Cain|Cain]] and Harrison in 1960,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cain|Harrison|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; "cladist" (for an adherent of Hennig's school) by [[Ernst Mayr|Mayr]] in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dupuis|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "cladistics" in 1966.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Hennig referred to his own approach as "phylogenetic systematics". From the time of his original formulation until the end of the 1970s, cladistics competed as an analytical and philosophical approach to phylogenetic inference with [[phenetics]] and so-called [[evolutionary taxonomy]]. Phenetics was championed at this time by the [[Numerical taxonomy|numerical taxonomists]] [[Peter Sneath]] and [[Robert Sokal]] and the evolutionary taxonomist [[Ernst Mayr]].

Originally conceived, if only in essence, by Willi Hennig in a book published in 1950, cladistics did not flourish until its translation into English in 1966 (Lewin 1997). Today, cladistics is the most popular method for constructing phylogenies from morphological and molecular data. Unlike phenetics, cladistics is specifically aimed at reconstructing evolutionary histories.

In the 1990s, the development of effective [[polymerase chain reaction]] techniques allowed the application of cladistic methods to [[biochemical]] and [[molecular genetics|molecular genetic]] traits of organisms, as well as to anatomical ones, vastly expanding the amount of data available for phylogenetics. At the same time, cladistics rapidly became the dominant set of methods of phylogenetics in evolutionary biology, because [[computer]]s made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics.

The way for [[computational phylogenetics]] was paved by [[phenetics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1982|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; a set of methods commonly used from the 1950s to 1980s and to some degree later. Phenetics did not try to reconstruct phylogenetic trees; rather, it tried to build [[dendrograms]] from similarity data; its algorithms required less computer power than phylogenetic ones.

== Methodology ==
{{Main|Phylogenetics|Cladogram}}
{{See also|Phylogenetic tree}}
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}

The cladistic method interprets each character state transformation implied by the distribution of shared character states among taxa (or other terminals) as a potential piece of evidence for grouping. The outcome of a cladistic analysis is a [[cladogram]] – a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]]-shaped diagram ([[dendrogram]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weygoldt|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is interpreted to represent the best hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships. Although traditionally such cladograms were generated largely on the basis of morphological characters and originally calculated by hand, [[DNA sequencing|genetic sequencing]] data and [[computational phylogenetics]] are now commonly used in phylogenetic analyses, and the [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|parsimony]] criterion has been abandoned by many phylogeneticists in favor of more "sophisticated" but less parsimonious evolutionary models of character state transformation. Cladists contend that these models are unjustified.{{Why|date=May 2013}}

Every cladogram is based on a particular dataset analyzed with a particular method. Datasets are tables consisting of [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular]], morphological, [[Ethology|ethological]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jerison|2003|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or other characters and a list of [[operational taxonomic unit]]s (OTUs), which may be genes, individuals, populations, species, or larger taxa that are presumed to be monophyletic and therefore to form, all together, one large clade; phylogenetic analysis infers the branching pattern within that clade. Different datasets and different methods, not to mention violations of the mentioned assumptions, often result in different cladograms. Only scientific investigation can show which is more likely to be correct.

Until recently, for example, cladograms like the following have generally been accepted as accurate representations of the ancestral relations among turtles, lizards, crocodilians, and birds:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Vertebrate Palaeontology |last=Benton |first=Michael J. |authorlink=Michael Benton |year=2005 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-0-632-05637-8 |pages=214, 233}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

   }}
}}
&lt;/center&gt;

If this phylogenetic hypothesis is correct, then the last common ancestor of turtles and birds, at the branch near the {{color|LimeGreen|▼}} lived earlier than the last common ancestor of lizards and birds, near the {{font|size=150%|color=OrangeRed|text=♦}}. Most [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular evidence]], however, produces cladograms more like this:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Lyson |first1=Tyler |last2=Gilbert |first2=Scott F. |date=March–April 2009 |title=Turtles all the way down: loggerheads at the root of the chelonian tree |journal=Evolution &amp; Development |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=133–135 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-142X.2009.00325.x |url=http://www.mrfdigs.com/publications/2009_lyson-gilbert-loggerheads.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

         |2=[[bird]]s
         }}
      }}
   }}
}}
&lt;/center&gt;

If this is accurate, then the last common ancestor of turtles and birds lived later than the last common ancestor of lizards and birds. Since the cladograms provide competing accounts of real events, at most one of them is correct.

[[File:Monophyly, paraphyly, polyphyly.png|thumb|400px|right|Cladogram of the [[primate]]s, showing a [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] taxon (a [[clade]]: the simians or Anthropoidea, in yellow), a [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] taxon (the prosimians, in blue, including the red patch), and a [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] taxon (the nocturnal primates – the [[loris]]es and the [[tarsier]]s – in red)]]

The cladogram to the right represents the current universally accepted hypothesis that all [[primate]]s, including [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhines]] like the [[lemur]]s and [[loris]]es, had a common ancestor all of whose descendants were primates, and so form a clade; the name Primates is therefore recognized for this clade. Within the primates, all anthropoids (monkeys, apes and humans) are hypothesized to have had a common ancestor all of whose descendants were anthropoids, so they form the clade called Anthropoidea. The "prosimians", on the other hand, form a paraphyletic taxon. The name Prosimii is not used in [[phylogenetic nomenclature]], which names only clades; the "prosimians" are instead divided between the clades [[Strepsirrhini|Strepsirhini]] and [[Haplorhini]], where the latter contains Tarsiiformes and Anthropoidea.

== Terminology for character states ==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
The following terms, coined by Hennig, are used to identify shared or distinct character states among groups:&lt;ref name="Patterson 1982"&gt;{{harvnb|Patterson|1982|pp=21–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Patterson 1988"&gt;{{Harvnb|Patterson|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="de Pinna 1991"&gt;{{Harvnb|de Pinna|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{anchor|plesiomorphy}} A '''[[plesiomorphy]]''' ("close form") or '''ancestral state''' is a character state that a taxon has retained from its ancestors. When two or more taxa that are not nested within each other share a plesiomorphy, it is a '''symplesiomorphy''' (from ''syn-'', "together"). Symplesiomorphies do not mean that the taxa that exhibit that character state are necessarily closely related. For example, Reptilia is traditionally characterized by (among other things) being [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] (i.e., not maintaining a constant high body temperature), whereas birds are [[Homeothermy|warm-blooded]]. Since cold-bloodedness is a plesiomorphy, inherited from the common ancestor of traditional reptiles and birds, and thus a symplesiomorphy of turtles, snakes and crocodiles (among others), it does not mean that turtles, snakes and crocodiles form a clade that excludes the birds.
* {{anchor|apomorphy}}{{anchor|synapomorphy}} An '''[[apomorphy]]''' ("separate form") or '''derived state''' is an innovation. It can thus be used to diagnose a clade – or even to help define a clade name in [[phylogenetic nomenclature]]. Features that are derived in individual taxa (a single species or a group that is represented by a single terminal in a given phylogenetic analysis) are called '''autapomorphies''' (from ''auto-'', "self"). Autapomorphies express nothing about relationships among groups; clades are identified (or defined) by '''synapomorphies''' (from ''syn-'', "together"). For example, the possession of [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]] that are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] with those of ''Homo sapiens'' is a synapomorphy within the vertebrates. The [[tetrapod]]s can be singled out as consisting of the first vertebrate with such digits homologous to those of ''Homo sapiens'' together with all descendants of this vertebrate (an apomorphy-based [[Phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetic definition]]).&lt;ref name="LaurinAnderson2004"&gt;{{Harvnb|Laurin|Anderson|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, snakes and other tetrapods that do not have digits are nonetheless tetrapods: other characters, such as amniotic eggs and diapsid skulls, indicate that they descended from ancestors that possessed digits which are homologous with ours.
* A character state is '''homoplastic''' or "an instance of '''[[homoplasy]]'''" if it is shared by two or more organisms but is absent from their common ancestor or from a later ancestor in the lineage leading to one of the organisms. It is therefore inferred to have evolved by convergence or reversal. Both mammals and birds are able to maintain a high constant body temperature (i.e., they are warm-blooded). However, the accepted cladogram explaining their significant features indicates that their common ancestor is in a group lacking this character state, so the state must have evolved independently in the two clades. Warm-bloodedness is separately a synapomorphy of mammals (or a larger clade) and of birds (or a larger clade), but it is not a synapomorphy of any group including both these clades. Hennig's Auxiliary Principle &lt;ref name="Hennig 1966"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hennig|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that shared character states should be considered evidence of grouping unless they are contradicted by the weight of other evidence; thus, homoplasy of some feature among members of a group may only be inferred after a phylogenetic hypothesis for that group has been established.

The terms plesiomorphy and apomorphy are relative; their application depends on the position of a group within a tree. For example, when trying to decide whether the tetrapods form a clade, an important question is whether having four limbs is a synapomorphy of the earliest taxa to be included within Tetrapoda: did all the earliest members of the Tetrapoda inherit four limbs from a common ancestor, whereas all other vertebrates did not, or at least not homologously? By contrast, for a group within the tetrapods, such as birds, having four limbs is a plesiomorphy. Using these two terms allows a greater precision in the discussion of homology, in particular allowing clear expression of the hierarchical relationships among different homologous features.

It can be difficult to decide whether a character state is in fact the same and thus can be classified as a synapomorphy, which may identify a monophyletic group, or whether it only appears to be the same and is thus a homoplasy, which cannot identify such a group. There is a danger of circular reasoning: assumptions about the shape of a phylogenetic tree are used to justify decisions about character states, which are then used as evidence for the shape of the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|James|Pourtless IV|2009|p=25}}: "Synapomorphies are invoked to defend the hypothesis; the hypothesis is invoked to defend the synapomorphies."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phylogenetics]] uses various forms of [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|parsimony]] to decide such questions; the conclusions reached often depend on the dataset and the methods. Such is the nature of empirical science, and for this reason, most cladists refer to their cladograms as hypotheses of relationship. Cladograms that are supported by a large number and variety of different kinds of characters are viewed as more robust than those based on more limited evidence.

== Terminology for taxa ==
Mono-, para- and polyphyletic taxa can be understood based on the shape of the tree (as done above), as well as based on their character states.&lt;ref name="Patterson 1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="de Pinna 1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Patterson|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are compared in the table below.

{| class="wikitable"
|+
! Term
! Node-based definition
! Character-based definition
|- valign="top"
| [[Monophyly]]
| A [[clade]], a monophyletic taxon, is a taxon that includes all descendants of an inferred ancestor.
| A clade is characterized by one or more '''apomorphies''': derived character states present in the first member of the taxon, inherited by its descendants (unless secondarily lost), and not inherited by any other taxa.
|- valign="top"
| [[Paraphyly]]
| A paraphyletic assemblage is one that is constructed by taking a clade and removing one or more smaller clades.&lt;ref&gt;Many sources give a verbal definition of 'paraphyletic' that does not require the missing groups to be monophyletic. However, when diagrams are presented representing paraphyletic groups, these invariably show the missing groups as monophyletic. See e.g.{{Harvnb|Wiley|Siegel-Causey|Brooks|Funk|1991|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Removing one clade produces a singly paraphyletic assemblage, removing two produces a doubly paraphylectic assemblage, and so on.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
| A paraphyletic assemblage is characterized by one or more '''plesiomorphies''': character states inherited from ancestors but not present in all of their descendants. As a consequence, a paraphyletic assemblage is truncated, in that it excludes one or more clades from an otherwise monophyletic taxon. An alternative name is ''[[evolutionary grade]]'', referring to an ancestral character state within the group. While paraphyletic assemblages are popular among paleontologists and evolutionary taxonomists, cladists do not recognize paraphyletic assemblages as having any formal information content – they are merely parts of clades.
|- valign="top"
| [[Polyphyly]]
| A polyphyletic assemblage is one which is neither monophyletic nor paraphyletic.
| A polyphyletic assemblage is characterized by one or more '''[[Homoplasy|homoplasies]]''': character states which have converged or reverted so as to be the same but which have not been inherited from a common ancestor. No systematist recognizes polyphyletic assemblages as taxonomically meaningful entities, although ecologists sometimes consider them meaningful labels for functional participants in ecological communities (e. g., primary producers, detritivores, etc.).

== Criticism ==

Cladistics, either generally or in specific applications, has been criticized from its beginnings. Decisions as to whether particular character states are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]], a precondition of their being synapomorphies, have been challenged as involving [[circular reasoning]] and subjective judgements.&lt;ref name="AdraEdgeLieb02"&gt;{{Harvnb|Adrain|Edgecombe|Lieberman|2002|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transformed cladistics]] arose in the late 1970s in an attempt to resolve some of these problems by removing phylogeny from cladistic analysis, but it has remained unpopular.

However, homology is usually determined from analysis of the results that are evaluated with homology measures, mainly the consistency index (CI) and retention index (RI), which, it has been claimed,{{by whom|date=October 2013}} makes the process objective. Also, homology can be equated to synapomorphy, which is what Patterson has done.&lt;ref&gt;Forey, Peter et al. 1992. Cladistics,1st ed., p. 9, Oxford U. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In disciplines other than biology ==
The comparisons used to acquire data on which [[cladograms]] can be based are not limited to the field of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mace|Clare|Shennan|2005|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any group of individuals or classes that are hypothesized to have a common ancestor, and to which a set of common characteristics may or may not apply, can be compared pairwise. Cladograms can be used to depict the hypothetical descent relationships within groups of items in many different academic realms. The only requirement is that the items have characteristics that can be identified and measured.

[[Cultural anthropology|Anthropology]] and [[archaeology]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipo|O'Brien|Collard|Shennan|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cladistic methods have been used to reconstruct the development of cultures or artifacts using groups of cultural traits or artifact features.

[[Comparative mythology]] and [[Folklore|folktale]] use cladistic methods to reconstruct the protoversion of many myths. Mythological phylogenies constructed with mythemes clearly support low horizontal transmissions (borrowings), historical (sometimes Palaeolithic) diffusions and punctuated evolution.&lt;ref&gt;d'Huy 2012a, b; d'Huy 2013a, b, c, d&lt;/ref&gt; They also are a powerful way to test hypotheses about cross-cultural relationships among folktales.&lt;ref&gt;Ross and al. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tehrani 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Literature]]: Cladistic methods have been used in the classification of the surviving manuscripts of the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canterbury Tales Project |url=http://www.canterburytalesproject.org |accessdate=2009-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707103441/http://www.canterburytalesproject.org/ |archivedate=7 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the manuscripts of the Sanskrit ''[[Charaka Samhita]]''.&lt;ref name="Maas 2010"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maas|2010–2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Historical linguistics]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oppenheimer|2006|pp=290–300, 340–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cladistic methods have been used to reconstruct the phylogeny of languages using linguistic features. This is similar to the traditional [[comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]] of historical linguistics, but is more explicit in its use of [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] and allows much faster analysis of large datasets ([[computational phylogenetics]]).

[[Textual criticism]] or [[stemmatics]]:&lt;ref name="Maas 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|O’Hara|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cladistic methods have been used to reconstruct the phylogeny of manuscripts of the same work (and reconstruct the lost original) using distinctive copying errors as apomorphies. This differs from traditional historical-comparative linguistics in enabling the editor to evaluate and place in genetic relationship large groups of manuscripts with large numbers of variants that would be impossible to handle manually. It also enables [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|parsimony]] analysis of contaminated traditions of transmission that would be impossible to evaluate manually in a reasonable period of time.

[[Astrophysics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraix-Burnet|Choler|Douzery|Verhamme|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; infers the history of relationships between galaxies to create branching diagram hypotheses of galaxy diversification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14227">'''Claude Rex Nowell''' (November 2, 1944 – January 29, 2008), also known as '''Corky King''', '''Corky Ra''', and '''Summum Bonum Amon Ra''', was the [[Americans|American]] founder of [[Summum]], a [[501(c)(3)]], [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[religion|religious]] organization that practices a modern form of [[Mummy|mummification]].&lt;ref name="SummumCorkyBio"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Nowell was born in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], in the [[United States]]. When he was four years old, his parents divorced and he and his mother moved to [[Southern California]]. That same year (1948), his mother married Robert Williamson King and she had Claude's name legally changed to Claude Rex King. When he was young, Claude was given the nickname "Corky" which was how he was known to friends and family.&lt;ref name="SummumCorkyBio" /&gt;

Up until 1959, Corky King lived in [[Monrovia, California]]. Then his family moved to [[Tustin, California]], where he graduated from [[Tustin High School]] in 1962. He went on to attend [[Orange Coast College]] in [[Costa Mesa]] and graduated in Construction Technology. Corky King moved back to Salt Lake City in 1964 and about that same time, he legally changed his name back to Claude Rex Nowell.&lt;ref name="SummumCorkyBio" /&gt;
He attended Brigham Young University and graduated from the University of Utah.&lt;ref name="APSummumStory"&gt;{{cite news

==Founding of Summum==
In 1975, Nowell founded Summum following an experience he describes as an encounter with highly intelligent beings.&lt;ref name="DailyUtahChronical"&gt;{{Cite news

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of Summum is to share with others the information he received from his encounter and to provide an environment for those on a path of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] development. In 1980, Nowell legally changed his name to Summum Bonum Amon Ra as a representation of his spiritual path.&lt;ref name="SummumCorkyBio" /&gt;

==Pyramid and winery==
In 1978, Nowell began construction of a [[pyramid]] that would be used as a [[winery]] to produce Summum [[Soma (drink)|Soma]] Nectar.&lt;ref name="DailyUtahChronical" /&gt; Despite Utah's strict [[liquor law]]s and the rigid controls it places on alcoholic beverages, a Utah law allowed him to establish the winery provided the wine was used for religious purposes.&lt;ref name="ExitStrategy"&gt;{{cite book

==Modern mummification==
Through Summum, Nowell re-introduced mummification in a modernized form and at one point was a licensed [[funeral director]] in the state of California.&lt;ref name="ExitStrategy" /&gt; Nowell has been referred to as "the father of modern mummification,"&lt;ref name="MummyKids"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
The process begins with the body's submersion in fluids for 77 days and is complex, requiring about 1,000 hours of labor over six months.  Those wishing to be mummified write a "spiritual will" outlining where they hope their soul will go in the next lifetime, to be read to their body at least once a day during its 77 days of submersion.&lt;ref name="SLTrib"&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

The first human to undergo the mummification process was Nowell himself, who died in January 2008. His body is encased inside a bronze mummiform (casket) that is covered in gold and stands inside the group's pyramid.&lt;ref name="CNNBeliefBlog"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summum philosophy and litigation==
Since founding Summum, Nowell, under the name of Summum Bonum Amen Ra, has authored books published by Summum that delve into the organization's [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name="SummumBook"&gt;{{cite book

  | first = Summum Bonum Amen

  | isbn = 0-943217-00-8 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the books, Ra outlines principles upon which the Summum philosophy is based.&lt;ref name="SummumBook" /&gt; Summum has requested that monuments displaying these principles, known as the "Seven Aphorisms", be placed next to [[Ten Commandments]] monuments in city parks. In one case, where the city of Duchesne, Utah rejected the request, Summum filed a lawsuit on the basis of freedom of speech and discrimination.&lt;ref name="OgdenCase"&gt;{{cite court

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The city opted to relocate its monument rather than allowing Summum to erect its monument, rendering the lawsuit [[Mootness|moot]] and leading to its dismissal.&lt;ref name="SLTribSummumDuchesne"&gt;{{cite news| first =| last =| title =Move of Ten Commandments monument ends lawsuit against Duchesne| work =| pages =| language =| date =2009-07-10| publisher =Salt Lake Tribune| url =http://www.sltrib.com/ci_12812615| accessdate =2009-10-17| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110604204831/http://www.sltrib.com/ci_12812615| archive-date =2011-06-04| dead-url =yes| df =}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12487">'''''Clausula rebus sic stantibus''''' ([[Latin]] for "things thus standing"), in [[public international law]], is the [[legal doctrine]] allowing for a [[treaty]] to become inapplicable because of a fundamental change of circumstances. The doctrine is essentially an "escape clause" to the general rule of ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]'' (promises must be kept).&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the doctrine is a risk to the security of treaties, as its scope is relatively unconfined, the conditions in which it may be invoked must be carefully noted.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), pp. 23–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Malanczuk, ''Akehurst's Modern Introduction to International Law'', 7th rev. edn (London: Routledge, 1997), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function in international law==

The doctrine is part of [[customary international law]] but is also provided for in the 1969 [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], under Article 62 (Fundamental Change of Circumstance). Although the doctrine is not mentioned by name,&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 62 provides the only justifications for its invocation: the circumstances that existed at the time of the conclusion of the treaty were indeed objectively essential to the obligations of treaty (sub-paragraph A), and the instance for the change of circumstances has had a radical effect on the obligations of the treaty (sub-paragraph B).

If the parties to a treaty had contemplated for the occurrence of the changed circumstances, the doctrine does not apply and the provision remains in effect. ''Clausula rebus sic stantibus'' relates to changed circumstances only if they had never been contemplated by the parties. That principle is clarified in the [[Cod Wars|Fisheries Jurisdiction Case]] (''United Kingdom v. Iceland'', 1973).

Although it is clear that a fundamental change of circumstances might justify terminating or modifying a treaty, the unilateral [[denunciation]] of a treaty is prohibited. A [[party (law)|party]] does not have the right to denounce a treaty unilaterally. (However, that has been debated.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;)

==History==
A key figure in the formulation of ''clausula rebus sic stantibus'' was the Italian jurist [[Scipione Gentili]] (1563–1616), who is generally credited for coining the maxim ''omnis conventio intelligitur rebus sic stantibus'' ('every convention is understood with circumstances as they stand').&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M.

XIV.&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss legal expert [[Emer de Vattel]] (1714–1767) was the next key contributor.

Its provision in the 1969 [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] established the doctrine firmly but not without dispute as 'a norm of international law'.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M.

== Examples ==
* According to [[Polybius]], in 211 BC, [[Lyciscus of Acarnania]] argued that the [[Laconia (ancient region)|Lacedaemonians]] should abandon their treaty with the [[Aetolian League]] because of fundamentally changed circumstances. That is perhaps the earliest recorded example of the principle of ''rebus sic stantibus'' at work.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Elizabeth I of England]] sought to amend the 1585 [[Treaty of Nonsuch]] on the grounds of fundamentally changed circumstances, but her efforts have not been well regarded by modern jurists.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a 'classic' case for the doctrine, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] attempted to change the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)]] on military shipping in the Black Sea. That happened in connection with the Treaty of London (1871), partly by invoking ''clausula rebus sic stantibus''. One important outcome was the insistence by other parties that unilateral termination of a treaty was not legal on those grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), pp. 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Article 59 of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]] made [[Batumi]] a [[free port]]. In 1886, Russia terminated the arrangement, partly on the grounds of a fundamental change in circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1881, the [[United States]] attempted to end the [[Clayton–Bulwer Treaty]] with the [[United Kingdom]]. Various arguments were advanced, including ''clausula rebus sic stantibus''. Although that principle ultimately did not apply in the resolution of the case, it is noteworthy as the first time that the US invoked the principle, as it had previously been opposed to it. The US went on to cite the doctrine again in its arguments for the revision of the [[Treaty of London (1915)]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the 1908 [[Bosnian crisis]], [[Austria-Hungary]] renounced its rights and obligations under Article 25 of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]]. Austria-Hungary's arguments have been seen as an invocation of fundamentally-changed circumstances. Moreover, despite protests at its actions, Austria-Hungary succeeded, arguably setting a precedent for the use of the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 7 February 1923, the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] issued an advisory opinion on a case between [[French Third Republic|France]] and the United Kingdom on the application to [[British nationals]] of [[French nationality law|French nationality decrees]] issued by the capitulatory regimes in [[Tunis]] and [[Morocco]]. France cited a fundamental change of circumstances, and the case seems to be the first example of a state invoking ''rebus sic stantibus'' before an international court. However, the states settled before the court was required to issue a verdict.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1924, [[Norway]] dissolved its 1907 treaty with [[Sweden]] that had arisen from the [[dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden]], citing changed circumstances including the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and Norway's entry into the [[League of Nations]]. Since the 1907 treaty was also time-limited, the case has been seen as a precedent for ''rebus sic stantibus'' applying not only to indefinite treaties.
* In 1926, China came to terms with Belgium after its efforts to denounce the Sino-Belgian Pact (1865), citing fundamentally changed circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 1923, France moved its customs office to [[Gex, Ain]], provoking the 'Freezones Controversy' with Switzerland. The matter was brought before the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]], and France invoked ''rebus sic stantibus'', but Switzerland argued that the doctrine did not apply in respect of territorial rights. In 1932, the court found in favour of Switzerland on the basis of fact, but it did not reject that ''rebus sic stantibus'' might be a valid basis for France's argument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcourts.com/pcij/eng/decisions/1929/1929.08.19_savoy_gex.htm Case of the Free Zones of Upper Savoy and the District of Gex], Permanent Court of International Justice,  Parties: France &amp; Switzerland, August 19th, 1929, Initiated March 29th, 1928&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second time ''rebus sic stantibus'' had been argued before an international court.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M.

'''David Benjamin Kaplan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|p|l|ən}}; born September 17, 1933) is the Hans Reichenbach Professor of Scientific Philosophy at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] [[UCLA Department of Philosophy|Department of Philosophy]]. His philosophical work focuses on the [[philosophy of language]], [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]] and the philosophy of [[Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]].&lt;ref&gt;http://philosophy.ucla.edu/person/david-kaplan/&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his work on [[demonstrative]]s, [[proposition]]s, and [[reference]] in [[Extensional|intensional]] contexts.  He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences]] in 1983&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucla.edu/about/awards-and-honors/faculty/american-academy-of-arts-and-sciences&lt;/ref&gt; and a Corresponding Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/elections/2007/kaplan.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707002818/http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/elections/2007/kaplan.cfm |archivedate=2015-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Kaplan began as an undergraduate at UCLA in 1951, admitted on academic probation "owing to poor grades."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Philosophy of David Kaplan|last=|first=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=27–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he started as a music major due to his interest in jazz, he was soon persuaded by his academic counselor Veronica Kalish to take the logic course taught by her husband [[Donald Kalish]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kaplan went on to earn a B.A. in philosophy in 1956 and a B.A. in mathematics in 1957,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lancog.com/david-kaplan.html&lt;/ref&gt; continuing in the [[UCLA Department of Philosophy|department of philosophy]] as a graduate student. He was the last doctoral student supervised by [[Rudolf Carnap]], receiving his Ph.D. in 1964 with a thesis entitled "Foundations of Intensional Logic." His work continues the strongly formal approach to philosophy long associated with UCLA (as represented by mathematician-logician-philosophers such as [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Richard Montague]]).

In most years, Kaplan teaches an upper division course on [[philosophy of language]], focusing on the work of either [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], or [[P.F. Strawson]]. He also teaches a related course on [[Saul Kripke|Kripke's]] [[Naming and Necessity]]. His lively{{opinion|date=January 2014}} lectures often focus on selected paragraphs from Russell's "[[On Denoting]]" as well as Frege's "[[On Sense and Reference]]."

==Philosophical work==
{{original research|date=July 2017}}
Kaplan's work is primarily focused on issues in the philosophy of language and logic. These ventures, however, sometimes take him into related issues in other fields, such as the philosophy of mind.

===Semantics for indexicals and demonstratives===
Kaplan's most influential contribution to the philosophy of language is his [[semantic]] analysis of [[indexical]]s and [[demonstratives]], which is outlined (in progressively greater detail) in a series of articles: "Dthat," "On The Logic of Demonstratives," "Demonstratives," and "Afterthoughts".{{citation needed|reason=a published source asserting this 'fact' is needed|date=July 2017}}

Kaplan's insights center on two key distinctions, which may be seen as responses to the inability of Frege's semantics to deal with context-sensitivity in language. First, in place of Frege's categories of Sinn and Bedeutung (typically translated as "sense" and "reference"), Kaplan introduces the notions of ''character'' and ''content''. The former is the [[linguistics|linguistic]] meaning of an expression, and the latter is the [[proposition]] (or propositional component) expressed by an expression in a context. Second, Kaplan makes an explicit distinction between the context of an utterance and the circumstances of evaluation of the proposition expressed by an utterance. Context can be formalized as a set composed of a speaker, a place, a time, and a possible world (and, depending on the analysis of demonstratives, perhaps a set of either demonstrations or directing intentions). Circumstances of evaluation play a role very similar to [[possible worlds]] in modal semantics.

From these rough distinctions, Kaplan then defines character and content more precisely. Character defines a function associated by convention with an expression, which takes contextual elements as arguments and yields content as values. Content, on the other hand, defines a function taking as arguments those elements of the circumstances of evaluation relevant to determining extension, and yielding the [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]] ([[referent]] or [[truth-value]]) as a value.

Two more important notions can thus be defined. We can say that an expression is context-sensitive if and only if its character defines a non-constant function (i.e., ''[[if and only if|if, and only if]]'' it yields different content-values given different context-element-arguments). An expression is context-insensitive if and only if its character defines a constant function. Also, the distinction between character and content breaks down in the case of context-insensitive expressions, and convention associates each such expression directly with a content.

On the other hand, an expression is directly referential if, and only if its content defines a constant function from circumstances of evaluation to extension. Kaplan also characterizes [[directly referential expression]]s as those that refer without the mediation of a Fregean Sinn, or as those whose only contribution to content are their referents. Thus, in the case of directly referential expressions, we can say that the distinction between content and referent breaks down.

Any [[singular term]] is directly referential according to Kaplan. So the following intuitive picture emerges: the meaning of an indexical is a rule taking us from some part of the context to an expression, and the meaning of an expression is a bit of propositional content that determines the extension in each possible world.

Kaplan goes on to use this semantic scheme to explain phenomena concerning the relationship between necessary and ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' truth. An utterance is said to be [[logical truth|necessarily true]] if, and only if the content it expresses is true in every possible circumstance; while an utterance is said to be true ''a priori'' if, and only if it expresses, in each context, a content that is true in the circumstances that context is part of. So, "I am here now" is true ''a priori'' because each of the indexical expressions used ('I', 'here', 'now') directly refer to the speaker, location, and time of utterance. But the utterance is not ''necessarily'' true, because any given speaker might have been in at a different place at that time, given different circumstances of evaluation. On the other hand, "I am David Kaplan," as spoken by David Kaplan, is necessarily true, since "I" and "David Kaplan" (both directly referential expressions) refer to the same object in every circumstance of evaluation. The same statement is not true ''a priori'', however, because if it were spoken in a different context (e.g., one with a speaker other than Kaplan), it might be false.

Another result of Kaplan's theory is that it solves [[Frege's Puzzle]] for indexicals. Roughly, the puzzle here arises as indexicals are thought to be directly referential, i.e., they do not refer by means of a Fregean Sinn. However, Frege explains cognitive value in terms of Sinn. Thus the following problem emerges: The sentences "I am David Kaplan", spoken by David Kaplan, "he is David Kaplan", spoken by someone pointing at David Kaplan, and "David Kaplan is David Kaplan", spoken by anyone, all express the same content and refer to the same individuals. Yet each of the three has a different cognitive value (it is possible to rationally believe one while denying another). Kaplan explains this by associating cognitive value with character rather than content, thus remedying the problem. (There are problems with this approach, which Kaplan explores in "Afterthoughts".)

Kaplan's semantic theory faces a problem, however, with proper names, which seem both directly referential ''and'' context-insensitive. On Kaplan's account, this means that constant functions are defined by both a proper name's character ''and'' its content, which would imply that proper names have no meaning other than their reference. While this approach to proper names is not novel ([[John Stuart Mill]] being an early advocate), [[Frege's Puzzle]] is thought to cast doubt on any such account. Many philosophers have attempted to deal with this issue (notably [[Joseph Almog]], [[David Braun]], [[Michael Devitt]], [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]], [[Nathan Salmon]], [[Scott Soames]], and [[Howard Wettstein]]), but no solution has been widely accepted.

===Quantifying in===
In his article "Quantifying In" (1968), Kaplan discusses issues in intensional and indirect (''Ungerade'', or ''oblique'') discourse, such as substitution failure, existential generalization failure, and the distinction between [[De dicto and de re|''de re'' / ''de dicto'']] propositional attitude attributions. Such issues were made salient primarily by W.V. Quine in his "Quantifiers and Propositional Attitudes" (1956).

The phrase "quantifying in" comes from Quine's discussion of what he calls "relational" constructions of an existential statement. In such cases, a variable bound by an anterior variable-binding operator occurs within a non-extensional context such as that created by a 'that' clause, or, alternatively, by propositional attitude or modal operators. The "quantifying in" idiom captures the notion that the variable-binding operator (for example, the existential quantifier 'something') ''reaches into'', so to speak, the non-extensional context to bind the variable occurring within its scope.   For example, (using a propositional attitude clause), if one quantifies into the statement "Ralph believes that Ortcutt is a spy," the result is (partly formalized):

:(Ǝx) (Ralph believes that x is a spy)
:["There is someone Ralph believes is a spy"]

In short, Kaplan attempts (among other things) to provide an apparatus (in a [[Gottlob Frege|Fregean]] vein) that allows one to quantify into such intensional contexts even if they exhibit the kind of substitution failure that Quine discusses. If successful, this shows that Quine is wrong in thinking that substitution failure implies existential generalization failure for (or inability to quantify into) the clauses that exhibit such substitution failure.

===Logic Pedagogy &amp; Logic 2000 Program===
In recent years, Kaplan has devoted much effort to teaching introductory logic. A main contribution has been his work to create a computer program, Logic 2000, on which students can do their assignments. Logic 2000 is currently available for use free of charge. The program has many parts, including a derivations module, a symbolizations module, a models module, and much more. The program was initially developed to complement the logic text of Donald Kalish and Richard Montague, and the derivations module therefore uses their distinctive natural deduction system. Perhaps the most significant features of the program are its feedback and error-checking capacities. The program can provide a student with immediate and extensive error messages detailing any errors the student may have made on the problem he or she is currently working on.&lt;ref&gt;The program may be obtained at [http://logic2k.humnet.ucla.edu http://logic2k.humnet.ucla.edu].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[philosophy of mind]], '''double-aspect theory''' is the view that the [[mind|mental]] and the [[nature|physical]] are two aspects of, or perspectives on, the same substance.  It is also called '''dual-aspect monism'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harald Atmanspacher|author2=Christopher A. Fuchs|title=The Pauli-Jung Conjecture and Its Impact Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P7y7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT182|date=23 June 2014|publisher=Andrews UK Limited|isbn=978-1-84540-759-9|pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory's relationship to [[neutral monism]] is ill-defined, but one proffered distinction says that whereas neutral monism allows the context of a given group of neutral elements to determine whether the group is mental, physical, both, or neither, double-aspect theory requires the mental and the physical to be inseparable and mutually irreducible (though distinct).&lt;ref&gt;Leopold Stubenberg.  [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/neutral-monism/#9.4 "Neutral Monism and the Dual Aspect Theory"].  ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dualism-vs-Monism.png|thumb|right|Dual-aspect theory is akin to neutral monism. This diagram contrasts it with physicalism and idealism, as well as Cartesian dualism.]]

Double-aspect theorists include, among others:-

* [[Baruch Spinoza]], who believed that the Existence had two aspects, Extension and Mind, which together were to be taken as two of an infinite set of attributes comprising God (or, Nature). 
* There is a dual-aspect interpretation of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[noumenon]].
* [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who considered the fundamental aspects of reality to be Will and Representation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schopenhauer/#3 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Schopenhauer]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[David Bohm]], who used [[implicate and explicate order]] as a means of displaying dual-aspects
* [[Gustav Fechner]]
* [[George Henry Lewes]]
* [[Carl Gustav Jung]] 
* [[Wolfgang Pauli]]
* [[John Polkinghorne]]
* [[Brian O'Shaughnessy (philosopher)|Brian O'Shaughnessy]] on the dual aspect theory of the Will
* [[Thomas Nagel]].&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, T. ''The View from Nowhere'', Chapter III p28&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[David Chalmers]] who explores a double-aspect view of information, with similarities to [[Kenneth M. Sayre|Kenneth Sayre]]'s information-based neutral monism.
*  [[Christopher Langan]]

==Pauli-Jung conjecture==
From the work of Wolfgang Pauli and Carl G. Jung results a philosophical approach, which Harald Atmanspacher titles the ''Pauli-Jung conjecture'', of dual-aspect monism which has a very specific further feature, namely that different aspects may show a [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] in a quantum physical sense. That is, the Pauli-Jung conjecture implies that with regard to mental and physical states there may be incompatible descriptions of different parts that emerge from the whole.&lt;ref name="atmanspacher-2014-quote"&gt;Quote: "In the ''Pauli-Jung Conjecture'' these manifest aspects can even be incompatible or complementary, a feature that is not part of any other dual-aspect approach today. The possibility of incompatible descriptions of parts emerging from wholes clearly drives from Pauli's knowledge of this key concept of quantum theory, and it suggests that structural elements of quantum theory may elucidate our understanding of the psychophysical problem." Cited from: {{cite book|author1=Harald Atmanspacher|author2=Christopher A. Fuchs|title=The Pauli-Jung Conjecture and Its Impact Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P7y7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|date=23 June 2014|publisher=Andrews UK Limited|isbn=978-1-84540-759-9|pages=1 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stands in close analogy to [[quantum physics]],&lt;ref name="atmanspacher-2014-quote"/&gt; where complementary properties cannot be determined jointly with accuracy.

Atmanspacher further refers to [[Paul Bernays]]' views on complementarity in physics and in philosophy when he states that "Two descriptions are complementary if they mutually exclude each other, yet are both necessary to describe a situation exhaustively."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Harald Atmanspacher|title=Dual-Aspect Monism à la Pauli and Jung|journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies|volume=19|number=9-10|date=2012|pages=96–120(25)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Elements of Semiology''''' ({{lang-fr|Éléments de sémiologie}}) is a compendium-like text by French [[semiotics|semiotician]] [[Roland Barthes]], originally published under the title of "Éléments de Sémiologie" in the French review ''Communications'' (No. 4, 1964, pp. 91–135). The English translation by Annette Lavers and Colin Smith has been published independently as a short book.

In the slightly expanded introduction to the book, Barthes suggests that although linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] conceived of [[linguistics]] as a branch of semiology, semiology should rather be seen as a branch of linguistics.

[[File:Woman collapses in the East Village of New York.jpg|thumb|Emergency Medical Technician  treating a woman who has collapsed in the street in New York. Dangers to life and health are serious enough that emergency response systems are considered vital.]]
An '''emergency''' is a situation that poses an immediate risk to [[health]], [[life]], [[property]], or [[Natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Government Advice on Definition of an Emergency |url=http://www.ukresilience.info/upload/assets/www.ukresilience.info/15mayshortguide.pdf |accessdate=2007-05-30 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606230917/http://www.ukresilience.info/upload/assets/www.ukresilience.info/15mayshortguide.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most emergencies require urgent intervention to prevent a worsening of the situation, although in some situations, mitigation may not be possible and agencies may only be able to offer palliative care for the aftermath.

While some emergencies are self-evident (such as a [[natural disaster]] that threatens many lives), many smaller incidents require that an observer (or affected party) decide whether it qualifies as an emergency.
The precise definition of an emergency, the agencies involved and the procedures used, vary by jurisdiction, and this is usually set by the [[government]], whose agencies ([[emergency service]]s) are responsible for emergency planning and management.

==Defining an emergency==
An incident, to be an emergency, conforms to one or more of the following: if it:
* Poses an immediate threat to [[life]], [[health]], [[property]], or environment
* Has already caused loss of life, health detriments, property damage, or environmental damage
* has a high [[probability]] of escalating to cause immediate danger to life, health, property, or environment{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

In the United States, most states mandate that a notice be printed in each telephone book that requires that someone must relinquish use of a phone line, if a person requests the use of a telephone line (such as a [[party line (telephony)|party line]]) to report an emergency.   State statutes typically define an ''emergency'' as, "...a condition where life, health, or property is in jeopardy, and the prompt summoning of aid is essential."&lt;ref&gt;Some examples of state statutes defining ''emergency'' for this purpose: California Penal Code, Sec. 384&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst most emergency services agree on protecting [[human]] health, life and property, the environmental impacts are not considered sufficiently important by some agencies{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}.  This also extends to areas such as [[animal welfare]], where some emergency organizations cover this element through the "property" definition, where animals owned by a person are threatened (although this does not cover wild animals).   This means that some agencies do not mount an "emergency" response where it endangers wild animals or environment{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}, though others respond to such incidents (such as oil spills at sea that threaten marine life).  The attitude of the agencies involved is likely to reflect the predominant opinion of the government of the area.

==Types of emergency==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2014}}

===Dangers to life===
Many emergencies cause an immediate danger to the life of people involved.  This can range from emergencies affecting a single person, such as the entire range of [[Medical emergency|medical emergencies]] including [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]s, [[stroke]]s, [[cardiac arrest]] and [[Physical trauma|trauma]], to incidents that affect large numbers of people such as [[natural disaster]]s including [[tornado]]es, [[hurricane]]s, [[flood]]s, [[earthquake]]s, [[mudslide]]s and outbreaks of diseases such as [[cholera]], [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]], and [[malaria]].

Most agencies consider these the highest priority emergency, which follows the general school of thought that nothing is more important than human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukresilience.info/upload/assets/www.ukresilience.info/emergresponse.pdf |title=UK Government document stating that life-saving activity is the highest priority in an emergency |accessdate=2007-05-30 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606232027/http://www.ukresilience.info/upload/assets/www.ukresilience.info/emergresponse.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dangers to health===
Some emergencies are not necessarily immediately threatening to life, but might have serious implications for the continued health and well-being of a person or persons (though a health emergency can subsequently escalate to life-threatening).

The causes of a health emergency are often very similar to the causes of an emergency threatening to life, which includes medical emergencies and natural disasters, although the ''range'' of incidents that can be categorized here is far greater than those that cause a danger to life (such as broken limbs, which do not usually cause death, but immediate intervention is required if the person is to recover properly). Many life emergencies, such as cardiac arrest, are also health emergencies.

===Dangers to the environment===

Some emergencies do not immediately endanger life, health or property, but do affect the natural environment and creatures living within it.  Not all agencies consider this a genuine emergency, but it can have far-reaching effects on animals and the long term condition of the land.  Examples would include [[forest fire]]s and marine [[oil spill]]s.

==Systems of classifying emergencies==
Agencies across the world have different systems for classifying incidents, but all of them serve to help them allocate finite resource, by prioritising between different emergencies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

The first stage of any classification is likely to define whether the incident qualifies as an emergency, and consequently if it warrants an emergency response. Some agencies may still respond to non-emergency calls, depending on their remit and availability of resource.  An example of this would be a fire department responding to help retrieve a cat from a tree, where no life, health or property is immediately at risk.

Following this, many agencies assign a sub-classification to the emergency, prioritising incidents that have the most potential for risk to life, health or property (in that order).  For instance, many ambulance services use a system called the [[Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch System]] (AMPDS) or a similar solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampagov.net/dept_fire/rescue_division/general_info/advanced_medical_priority_dispatch.asp |title=Tampa Fire Department EMS dispatch details |accessdate=2007-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505220614/http://www.tampagov.net/dept_fire/rescue_division/general_info/advanced_medical_priority_dispatch.asp |archivedate=May 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/helpweoffer/help1.html |title=London Ambulance Service details of AMPDS use |accessdate=2007-05-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070130163345/http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/helpweoffer/help1.html |archivedate=2007-01-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The AMPDS categorises all calls to the ambulance service using it as  either 'A' category (immediately life-threatening), 'B' Category (immediately health threatening) or 'C' category (non-emergency call that still requires a response).  Some services have a fourth category, where they believe that no response is required after clinical questions are asked.

Another system for prioritizing medical calls is known as Emergency Medical Dispatch (EMD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.911dispatch.com/info/emd/index.html|title=EMD Resources|accessdate=2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.utah.gov/ems/stdseval/training/emd_curriculum_trainee.pdf |title=EMD Training Guide |publisher=Utah Bureau of Emergency Medical Services |date=January 2005 |accessdate=2007-07-07 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925174249/http://health.utah.gov/ems/stdseval/training/emd_curriculum_trainee.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jurisdictions that use EMD typically assign a code of "alpha" (low priority), "bravo" (medium priority), "charlie" (requiring [[paramedic|advanced life support]]), delta (high priority, requiring [[advanced life support]]) or "echo" (maximum possible priority, e.g., witnessed cardiac arrests) to each inbound request for service; these codes are then used to determine the appropriate level of response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/dph/ems/files/demsocreport2005.txt|title=DEMSOC Annual Report - 2005|publisher=Delaware Emergency Medical Services Oversight Council|year=2005|accessdate=2007-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emergencydispatch.org/JOURNAL/articles/UsingECHO.html |title=Using the ECHO Determinant |author=Brian Dale |accessdate=2007-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040904075414/http://www.emergencydispatch.org/JOURNAL/articles/UsingECHO.html |archivedate=September 4, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emergencydispatch.org/articles/themostofEMS.htm|title=EMD: Making the Most of EMS|author=Jeff J. Clawson|accessdate=2007-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other systems (especially as regards [[Emergency management|major incident]]s) use objective measures to direct resource.  Two such systems are [[CHALET|SAD CHALET]] and [[ETHANE]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/40001331|title=Patient Plus reference to CHALET and ETHANE systems|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are both mnemonics to help emergency services staff classify incidents, and direct resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leslp.gov.uk/firstoff.htm |title=London Emergency planning committee use of CHALET |accessdate=2007-05-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626114729/http://www.leslp.gov.uk/firstoff.htm |archivedate=2007-06-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these acronyms helps ascertain the number of casualties (usually including the number of dead and number of non-injured people involved), how the incident has occurred, and what emergency services are required.

==Agencies involved in dealing with emergencies==

{{main article|Emergency service}}

Most developed countries have a number of [[emergency service]]s operating within them, whose purpose is to provide assistance in dealing with any emergency.  They are often government operated, paid for from [[tax]] revenue as a public service, but in some cases, they may be private companies, responding to emergencies in return for payment, or they may be voluntary organisations, providing the assistance from funds raised from [[donation]]s.

Most developed countries operate three core emergency services{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}:

* '''[[Police]]''' – handle mainly [[crime]]-related emergencies.
* '''[[Fire department|Fire]]''' – handle [[fire]]-related emergencies and usually possess secondary rescue duties.
* '''[[Emergency Medical Service|Medical]]''' – handle [[Medicine|medical]]-related emergencies.

There may also be a number of specialized emergency services, which may be a part of one of the core agencies, or may be separate entities who assist the main agencies. This can include services, such as [[bomb disposal]], [[search and rescue]], and [[Dangerous goods|hazardous material]] operations.

The Military and the [[Amateur Radio Emergency Service]] (ARES) or [[Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service]] (RACES) help in large emergencies such as a disaster or major civil unrest.

=== Summoning emergency services ===
{{main article|Emergency telephone number}}
Most countries have an [[emergency telephone number]], also known as the universal emergency number, which can be used to summon the emergency services to any incident.  This number varies from country to country (and in some cases by region within a country), but in most cases, they are in a short number format, such as [[9-1-1|911]] (United States and many parts of Canada),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nena.org/|title=US National Emergency Number Association|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]] (United Kingdom),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fire.org.uk/advice/999history.htm |title=History of the 999 System |accessdate=2007-05-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528022735/http://www.fire.org.uk/advice/999history.htm |archivedate=2007-05-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.met.police.uk/999/index.htm |title=Metropolitan Police advice on using 999 |accessdate=2007-05-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609160248/http://www.met.police.uk/999/index.htm |archivedate=2007-06-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1-1-2|112]] (Europe)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/Oftel/publications/ind_guidelines/emer1002.htm |title=UK government advice on the use of 112 alongside 999 |accessdate=2007-05-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403072801/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/Oftel/publications/ind_guidelines/emer1002.htm |archivedate=2007-04-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ec&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/civil/pdfdocs/112surv-2001.pdf |title=European Commission document on the Implementation of the Single 112 emergency number |accessdate=2007-05-30 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614210603/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/civil/pdfdocs/112surv-2001.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[000]] (Australia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emergencycalls.aca.gov.au/ |title=Australian Government Advice on Emergency Calls |accessdate=2007-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531230159/http://www.emergencycalls.aca.gov.au/ |archivedate=2007-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of mobile phones also dial the emergency services, even if the phone keyboard is locked, or if the phone has an expired or missing [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM card]], although the provision of this service varies by country and network.&lt;ref name=ec/&gt;

=== Civil emergency services ===

In addition to those services provided specifically for emergencies, there may be a number of agencies who provide an emergency service as an incidental part of their normal 'day job' provision. This can include [[public utility]] workers, such as in provision of [[electricity]] or [[gas]], who may be required to respond quickly, as both utilities have a large potential to cause danger to life, health and property if there is an infrastructure failure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/Gas/Safety/Emergency|title=UK National Gas Emergency Number|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file33246.pdf |title=UK Government Gas and Electricity National Emergency Plan |accessdate=2007-05-30 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610203937/http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file33246.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic emergency services===

Generally perceived as pay per use emergency services, domestic emergency services are small, medium or large businesses who tend to emergencies within the boundaries of licensing or capabilities. These tend to consist of emergencies where health or property is perceived to be at risk but may not qualify for official emergency response. Domestic emergency services are in principal similar to civil emergency services where public or private utility workers will perform corrective repairs to essential services and avail their service at all times; however, these are at a cost for the service. An example would be an emergency plumber &lt;ref&gt;"http://www.silvaplumbing.com.au/"| 24-hour-emergency-plumbing-repairs. Retrieved 29/09/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergency action principles (EAP)==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
Emergency action principles are key 'rules' that guide the actions of rescuers and potential rescuers.  Because of the inherent nature of emergencies, no two are likely to be the same, so emergency action principles help to guide rescuers at incidents, by sticking to some basic tenets.

The adherence to (and contents of) the principles by would-be rescuers varies widely based on the [[training]] the people involved in emergency have received, the support available from emergency services (and the time it takes to arrive) and the emergency itself.

===Key emergency principle===

The key [[principle]] taught in almost all [[systems]] is that the [[rescue]]r, be they a lay person or a [[professional]], should [[Risk assessment|assess]] the situation for [[Risk|danger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg347.pdf|title=UK Health and Safety Executive publication on dealing with emergencies - Danger assessment is the first point|accessdate=2007-05-30|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/first-aid-advice/life-saving-procedures/primary-survey.aspx|title=St John Ambulance UK Primary Assessment guide|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason that an assessment for danger is given such high priority is that it is core to emergency [[management]] that rescuers do not become secondary victims of any incident, as this creates a further emergency that must be dealt with.

A typical assessment for danger would involve [[observation]] of the [[wikt:surroundings|surroundings]], starting with the cause of the [[accident]] (e.g. a falling object) and expanding outwards to include any situational [[hazard]]s (e.g. fast moving traffic) and history or secondary information given by [[witnesses]], bystanders or the emergency services (e.g. an [[attacker]] still waiting nearby).

Once a primary danger assessment has been complete, this should not end the system of checking for danger, but should inform all other parts of the process.

If at any time the risk from any hazard poses a significant danger (as a factor of [[likelihood]] and seriousness) to the rescuer, they should consider whether they should approach the scene (or leave the scene if appropriate).

==Managing an emergency==
[[File:Em cycle.png|right|thumb|A graphic representation of the four phases in emergency management.]]
{{main article|Emergency management}}
There are many emergency services protocols that apply in an emergency, which usually start with planning before an emergency occurs. One commonly used system for demonstrating the phases is shown here on the right.

The planning phase starts at '''preparedness''', where the agencies decide how to respond to a given incident or set of circumstances.  This should ideally include lines of command and control, and division of activities between agencies.  This avoids potentially negative situations such as three separate agencies all starting an official [[emergency shelter]] for victims of a disaster.

Following an emergency occurring, the agencies then move to a '''response''' phase, where they execute their plans, and may end up improvising some areas of their response (due to gaps in the planning phase, which are inevitable due to the individual nature of most incidents).

Agencies may then be involved in '''recovery''' following the incident, where they assist in the clear up from the incident, or help the people involved overcome their mental trauma.

The final phase in the circle is '''mitigation''', which involves taking steps to ensure no re-occurrence is possible, or putting additional plans in place to ensure less damage is done.  This should feed back into the preparedness stage, with updated plans in place to deal with future emergencies, thus completing the circle.

==State of emergency==
{{main article|State of emergency}}

In the event of a major incident, such as civil unrest or a major disaster, many governments maintain the right to declare a [[state of emergency]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldbills/077/04077.12-18.html|title=UK Government Civil Contingencies Act, giving powers to declare a state of emergency|accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives them extensive powers over the daily lives of their citizens, and may include temporary curtailment on certain [[civil rights]], including the right to trial. For instance to discourage [[looting]] of an evacuated area, a shoot on sight policy, however unlikely to occur, may be publicized.

'''Epistemic minimalism''' is the [[epistemology|epistemological]] thesis that mere true belief is [[sufficient condition|sufficient]] for [[knowledge]]. That is, the ''meaning'' of "Smith knows that it rained today" is accurately and completely analyzed by these two conditions:

# Smith believes that it rained today.
# It is true that it rained today.

The thesis is called ''minimalist'' by way of contrast with the competing accounts, which more or less universally require that true belief is [[necessary condition|necessary]] but [[sufficient condition|insufficient]] for knowledge&amp;mdash;that is, that a belief needs to be true in order to count as knowledge, but that truth alone is not enough&amp;mdash;that ''something else'' is needed. Traditionally, that something else was held to be evidential [[Theory of justification|justification]]; today it is usually held to be either justification ''and also'' some other condition, or else some other condition ''instead of'' justification, which will avoid the [[Gettier problem]].

Whatever the analysis, though, the standard view (both pre-Gettier and post-Gettier) pushes for ''narrower'' analyses of knowledge than mere true belief. Epistemic minimalism turns in exactly the opposite direction, and argues for a much more ''inclusive'' analysis--one which includes even Gettier cases, lucky guesses, and completely unjustified beliefs, as long as they happen to be true. The thesis is a ''minimalism'' in the sense that it eschews the additional requirements piled on top of true belief and argues that the intuitive reasons given for the [[justified true belief]] (JTB) analysis and its descendants are either misleading or misunderstood.

The most famous (or infamous) proponent of epistemic minimalism is [[Crispin Sartwell]] (1991). The view has been criticized by many epistemologists, with an influential criticism being delivered by [[William Lycan]] (1994).

[[File:François Turrettini.PNG|thumb|Portrait of François Turrettini]]

'''François Turrettini'''&lt;ref name=HDS&gt;[http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F11337.php Turrettini, François], in the [[Historical Dictionary of Switzerland]].&lt;/ref&gt; (17 October 1623 – 28 September 1687; also known as '''Francis Turretin''') was a Genevan-Italian [[Reformed scholastic]] theologian.

Turrettini is especially known as a zealous opponent of the [[theology]] of the [[Academy of Saumur]]&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Turretin |volume=28 |page=483}}&lt;/ref&gt; (embodied by [[Moise Amyraut]] and called [[Amyraldianism]]), as an earnest defender of the [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] [[orthodoxy]] represented by the [[Synod of Dort]], and as one of the [[authors]] of the ''[[Helvetic Consensus]]'', which defended the formulation of [[predestination]] from the Synod of Dort and the verbal [[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]] of the [[Bible]].

==Life==

He was the grandson of Francesco Turrettini, who left his native [[Lucca]] in 1574 and settled in [[Geneva, Switzerland|Geneva]] in 1592. Francis was born to [[Bénédict Turrettini]]&lt;ref name=HDS /&gt; at Geneva on 17 October 1623 and died there on 28 September 1687. He studied theology at Geneva&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; (1640–1644), [[Leiden]] (1644), [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], Paris (1645–1646), [[Saumur]] (1646–1648),{{sfn|Spencer|2000|p=512}} [[Montauban]], and [[Nîmes]].&lt;ref name=HDS /&gt; In Paris he also studied philosophy under Roman Catholic [[Pierre Gassendi]]. Returning to his native city, he was made [[pastor]] of the Italian church there from 1648 to 1687, of the French congregation from 1653-1687, and professor of [[theology]] at the [[University of Geneva]] in 1653.{{sfn|Spencer|2000|p=512}} He is the father of [[Jean-Alphonse Turrettini]], who would do much to dismantle the theology his father promoted.{{sfn|Spencer|2000|p=513}}

==Works==

His ''Institutio Theologiae Elencticae'' (3 parts, Geneva, 1679–1685) was the culmination of [[Reformed scholasticism]]. The ''Institutes'' uses the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] method to dispute a number of controversial issues. In it he defended the view that the Bible is God's verbally [[Biblical inspiration|inspired word]]. He also argued for [[infralapsarianism]] and [[federal theology]]. The ''Institutes'' was widely used as a textbook, up to its use at [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] by the [[Princeton theologians]] only to be replaced by [[Charles Hodge]]'s ''Systematic Theology'' in the late 19th century. Of his other [[disputation]]s, his most important are ''De Satisfactione Christi disputationes'' (1666) and ''De necessaria secessione nostra ab Ecclesia Romana et impossibili cum ea syncretismo'' (published in 1687).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; He wrote the ''[[Helvetic Consensus]]'', a [[Reformed confession]] written against [[Amyraldianism]], with [[J. H. Heidegger]] in 1675.{{sfn|Spencer|2000|p=513}}

Turrettini greatly influenced the [[Puritan]]s, but until recently, he was a mostly forgotten [[Protestant]] [[scholasticism|scholastic]] from the annals of [[History of Christianity|church history]], though the English translation of his ''Institutes of Elenctic Theology'' is increasingly read by students of theology. [[John Gerstner]] called Turrettini "the most precise theologian in the [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] tradition."{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Free Choice==

Along the lines of Reformed theology, Turrettini argues that after the fall human beings did not lose the faculty of will itself. "The inability to do good is strongly asserted, but the essence of freedom is not destroyed" (''Institutio theologiae elencticae'', 10.2.9). They still have liberty which is not repugnant to certain kinds of necessity. Turrettini distinguishes six kinds of necessity (''Institutio'', 10.2.4-9): physical necessity, necessity of coercion, necessity of dependence on God, rational necessity, moral necessity, and necessity of event. The first two among these six necessities are incompatible with freedom, whereas the latter four are not only compatible with freedom but perfect it. For Turrettini, freedom does not arise from an indifference of the will. No rational beings are indifferent to good and evil. The will of an individual human being is never indifferent in the sense of possessing an equilibrium, either before or after the fall. Turrettini defines freedom with the notion of rational spontaneity (''Institutio'', 10.2.10–11).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B. Hoon | title=The Difference between Scotus and Turretin in Their Formulation of the Doctrine of Freedom | journal= Westminster Theological Journal | year=2016 | volume=78 | url=https://www.academia.edu/30598029/_The_Difference_between_Scotus_and_Turretin_in_Their_Formulation_of_the_Doctrine_of_Freedom_Westminster_Theological_Journal_78_no._2_2016_249-69 | pages=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turrettini's doctrine of freedom appears to be similar to that of Scotus in that both of them endorse Aristotelian logic: the distinction between the necessity of the consequent (''necessitas consequentis'') and the necessity of the consequence (''necessitas consequentiae''); the distinction between ''in sensu composito'' and ''in sensu diviso''. It is not Scotus's notion of synchronic contingency but Aristotle's modal logic which is incorporated into Turrettini's doctrine of freedom. Moreover, the Scotistic ideas about necessity and indifference differ greatly from those of Turrettini. Turrettini develops the discussion on necessity and relates it to his argument about human freedom of choice. His careful rejection of the notion of indifference in the doctrine of freedom creates a big gap between his doctrine and that of Scotus. Turrettini's teaching of contingency emphasizes the sovereign act of God in the process of conversion, whereas Scotus's contingency theory blurs it. Turrettini is not a Scotist, but a Reformed theologian standing in a more “generic Aristotelian tradition.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4136">'''Henry Babcock Veatch Jr.''' (September 26, 1911 &amp;ndash; July 9, 1999) was an American [[philosopher]].

==Life and career==
Veatch was born in [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]], [[Indiana]].  He obtained his [[PhD]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1937 and spent his career at [[Indiana University]] (1937&amp;ndash;1965), [[Northwestern University]] (1965&amp;ndash;1973), and [[Georgetown University]] (1973&amp;ndash;1983) where he was Philosophy Department Chair from 1973 to 1976.  He also had visiting professorships at [[Colby College]], [[Haverford College]] and [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]].

Veatch was active in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] and served as president of the [http://www.acpaweb.org/ American Catholic Philosophical Association]. He served as president of the [[Metaphysical Society of America]] in 1961. In 1970&amp;ndash;71 he served as president of the Western Division of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. He was a member of the [[Guild of Scholars of The Episcopal Church]].

Henry Veatch died in [[Bloomington (Indiana)|Bloomington]], [[Indiana]].  Indiana University maintains the [http://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/findingaids/archives/InU-Ar-VAA2654 archive of his collected papers (1941&amp;ndash;1997)].

==Philosophy==
Veatch was a major proponent of [[rationalism]], an authority on [[Thomism|Thomistic philosophy]], and one of the leading neo-[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] thinkers of his time.  He opposed such modern and contemporary developments as the "[[transcendental idealism|transcendental turn]]" and the "[[linguistic turn]]."  A staunch advocate of plain speaking and "[[Hoosier]]" common sense, in philosophy and elsewhere, he argued on behalf of [[philosophical realism|realist]] [[metaphysics]] and practical [[ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Rocco Porecco and Ronald Duska, "Memorial Minutes: Henry Veatch 1911&amp;ndash;1999," ''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'', vol. 73, no. 2 (Nov/1999), pp. 31&amp;ndash;2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Veatch's most widely read book was ''Rational Man: A Modern Interpretation of Aristotelian Ethics'' (1962) which explicitly offered a rationalist counterpoint to [[William Barrett (philosopher)|William Barrett's]] well-known study in [[existentialism|existential philosophy]], ''[[Irrational Man]]'' (1958).

'''Hussein-Ali Montazeri''' (24 September 1922&lt;ref&gt;http://deskgram.org/khatami.76/taggedin?next_id=1612233350903059978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kaleme.com/1391/07/01/klm-113268/&lt;/ref&gt; – 19 December 2009; {{lang-fa|حسینعلی منتظری&amp;lrm;}}, {{pronunciation|Fa-ir-montazeri.ogg}}) was an [[Iranian people|Iranian]] Shia [[Islamic theology|Islamic theologian]], [[Islamic democracy]] advocate, writer and [[human rights]] activist. He was one of the leaders of the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979. He was once the designated successor to the revolution's [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]], with whom he had a falling-out in 1989 over government policies that Montazeri claimed infringed on people's freedom and denied them their rights. Montazeri spent his later years in [[Qom]], and remained politically influential in Iran, especially to the reformist movement.&lt;ref name="BBC Profile"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2699541.stm|title=Profile: Iran's dissident Ayatollah|accessdate=7 June 2007|publisher=BBC News|date=30 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was widely known as the most knowledgeable senior Islamic scholar in Iran&lt;ref name=NYTProfile/&gt; and a ''Grand Marja'' (religious authority) of [[Shia Islam]].

For more than two decades, Hussein-Ali Montazeri was one of the main critics of the Islamic Republic's domestic and foreign policy. He had also been an active advocate of [[Baha'i]] [[rights]], [[civil rights]] and [[women's rights in Iran]]. Montazeri was a prolific writer of books and articles. He was a staunch proponent of an [[Islamic state]], and he argued that post-revolutionary Iran was not being ruled as an Islamic state.

==Early life and public career==
Born in 1922, Montazeri was from a peasant family in [[Najafabad]],&lt;ref name="NY_rev"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Christopher de Bellaigui|title=Who Rules Iran?|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=27 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lebanese paper on Hashemi|url=https://nsarchive.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/1986-11-03-fbis-ash-shiraa-on-mcfarlane.pdf|accessdate=16 May 2016|work=Al Shira|date=3 November 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; a city in [[Isfahan Province]], 250 miles south of [[Tehran]].

His early theological education was in [[Isfahan]]. After Khomeini was forced into exile by the Shah, Montazeri "sat at the center of the clerical network" which Khomeini had established to fight the Pahlavi rule. He became a teacher at the Faiziyeh Theological School. While there he answered Khomeini's call to protest the [[White Revolution]] of [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] in June 1963 and was active in anti-Shah clerical circles.&lt;ref&gt;Hiro, Dikip, ''The Longest War: The Iran-Iraq Military Conflict'', Routledge Chapman and Hall, 1991, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent to prison in 1974 and released in 1978 in time to be active during the revolution.&lt;ref name="Mackey"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Iranians: Persia, Islam and the Soul of a Nation|last=Mackey| first=Sandra|authorlink=Sandra Mackey|year=1998|page=353|publisher=Plume Book|location=New York|isbn= 0-452-27563-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montazeri then went to [[Qom]] where he studied theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matthiesen|first=Toby|title=Hizbullah al-Hijaz: A History of The Most Radical Saudi Shi‘a Opposition Group|journal=The Middle East Journal|date=Spring 2010|volume=64|issue=2|pages=179–197|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/mej/summary/v064/64.2.matthiesen.html|accessdate=19 August 2013|doi=10.3751/64.2.11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iranian Revolution==
{{Main|Iranian Revolution}}
[[File:Hussein-Ali Montazeri in evin prison.jpg|thumb|left|Hussein-Ali Montazeri in [[Evin prison]]]]

Montazeri was famous as an Islamic jurist who was made to pay for his liberal-leaning beliefs. He supported a democratic republic as the best form of government; however in his ideal model for government, an Islamic jurist acts as a supervisor and advisor, what he, along with Ayatollah Khomeini, termed as [[velayat-e faqih]]. He was the author of ''Dirasāt fī wilāyah al-faqīh'', a scholarly book advocating the supervision of the administration by Islamic jurists. He believed in the independence of the government and did not accept any executive and policy making role for the Islamic jurist.&lt;ref name="Dabashi"&gt;{{cite book|title=Theology of Discontent: The Ideological Foundation of the Islamic Revolution in Iran| last=Dabashi|first=Hamid|authorlink=Hamid Dabashi|year=2006|pages=424–5|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, NJ|isbn=1-4128-0516-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montazeri asserted that the rule of the jurisprudent should not be an absolute rule;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memri.org/bin/latestnews.cgi?ID=SD117106|title=Interview With Grand Ayatollah Montazeri|work=MEMRI|accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2699541.stm|title=Iran's dissident Ayatollah|work=BBC News|date=30 January 2003|accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead, it should be limited to the function of advisor to the rulers, who are elected by the people.

In 1979, following the overthrow of the Shah, he played a pivotal role in instituting Iran's new constitution. He was one of the leaders of the movement to replace the democratic and secular draft constitution proposed for the Islamic Republic with one where the supervision of Islamic jurists was recognized. He distributed "a detailed commentary and alternate draft" for Iran's new constitution. It included proposals to specify that [[Twelver]] Shi'ism—and not Islam in general—was the official religion of the state and to state that Islamic jurists should appoint judges with the right of veto over all laws and actions that are against the Islamic principles.&lt;ref name="Bakhash"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Reign of the Ayatollahs|last=Bakhash|first=Shaul|authorlink=Shaul Bakhash|year=1984|page=79|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-465-06888-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he served on the [[Assembly of Experts]] (''Majles-e-Khobregan'') that wrote the [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran|constitution]] and that implemented many of his proposals.&lt;ref name="Mackey"/&gt;

During this time, Montazeri also served as Friday prayer leader of Qom, as a member of the Revolutionary Council and as deputy to Supreme Leader Khomeini. Khomeini began "to transfer some of his power" to Montazeri, in 1980. By 1983 "all government offices hung a small picture" of Montazeri next to that of Khomeini. In 1984, Montazeri became a grand ayatollah.&lt;ref name=moinobi9&gt;{{cite news|last=Moin|first=Baqer|title=Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/dec/20/grand-ayatollah-hossein-ali-montazeri-obituary|accessdate=2 August 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montazeri initially rejected Khomeini's proposal to make him his successor, insisting that the choice of successor be left to the democratically elected Assembly of Experts&lt;ref name="Brumberg"&gt;{{cite book|title=Kayhan, quoted in Reinventing Khomeini: the struggle for reform in Iran|last=Brumberg|first=Daniel|year=2001|page=172|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-07757-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Montazeri relented, and following a session of the Assembly of Experts in November 1985, he was officially appointed Khomeini's successor as Supreme Leader.&lt;ref name=NYTProfile/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moin_262"&gt;{{cite book|title=Khomeini: Life of the Ayatollah|last=Moin|first=Baqer|year=2000|page=262|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|location=New York|isbn=0-312-26490-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=parsi12&gt;{{cite book|title=Iran: A RevolutIonary  RepublIc in TransItIon|publisher=Institute for Security Studies  European Union|location=Paris|isbn=978-92-9198-198-4|pages=9–22|url=http://www.ab.gov.tr/files/ardb/evt/1_avrupa_birligi/1_9_politikalar/1_9_8_dis_politika/Iran_A_revolutionary_republic_in_transition.pdf|author=Rouzbeh Parsi|editor=Rouzbeh Parsi|accessdate=27 July 2013|format=Chaillot Papers|chapter=Introduction: Iran at a critical  juncture|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some observers believe Khomeini chose him for this role solely because of his support for Khomeini's principle of theocratic rule by Islamic jurists. Khomeini's proposed form of administration called for the most learned, or one of the most learned, Islamic jurists to "rule", and of all those who might be considered a leading Islamic jurist, only Montazeri supported theocracy. In Montazeri's opinion, however the jurist would not act as an absolute ruler, instead,  he would act as an advisor and consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iran-press-service.com/articles_2000/sep_2000/montazeri_interview_14900.htm|title=Interview With Grand Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri |work=Iran Press|accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Montazeri rajaee.jpg|thumb|Montazeri and then [[President of Iran|President]] [[Mohammad-Ali Rajai]]]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;... Montazeri fell short of the theological requirements of the supreme Faqih. He could not claim descent from the Prophet nor did he possess all the credentials of a revered scholar of Islamic law. His religious followers were few. And he lacked the all-important charisma. His selection had happened for one reason—he was the only one among the candidates for Faqih who totally endorsed Khomeini's vision of Islamic government.&lt;ref name="Mackey"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, traditionalists did not approve Montazeri's designation as successor due to several reasons, including his problematic persona in Shiite seminaries during the reign of the Shah and his support for [[Ali Shariati]]’s and for [[Nematollah Salehi Najafabadi|Nematollah Salehi Najaf Abadi]]'s works.&lt;ref name=mehdi2012&gt;{{cite web|last=Khalaji|first=Mehdi|title=Supreme Succession.

The middle class and elites would mock him in those early years.&lt;ref name=NYTProfile&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/world/middleeast/22ayatollah.html?_r=1&amp;hp|title=Cleric Wields Religion to Challenge Iran’s Theocracy|newspaper=New York Times|date=21 November 2009|accessdate=21 December 2009|first=Michael|last=Slackman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispute with Khomeini and demotion==
[[Mehdi Karrubi]] claims that the tensions between Montazeri and Khomenei began in around October 1986 when Montazeri sent a letter to the latter, criticising and questioning the foundation of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akhavi|first=Shahrough|title=The Thought and Role of Ayatollah Hossein'ali Montazeri in the Politics of Post-1979 Iran|journal=Iranian Studies|year=2008|volume=41|issue=5|pages=645–666|doi=10.1080/00210860802518301|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00210860802518301|accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montazeri's troubles became further evident due to his association with [[Mehdi Hashemi]] who ran an organization out of Montazeri's office which sought to export the Islamic revolution. Hashemi is thought to have embarrassed [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] by leaking information of his connection with the [[Iran-Contra|Iran-Contra affair]]. Subsequently Hashemi was arrested, convicted and executed in September 1987 on charges of counterrevolutionary activities.&lt;ref name="Keddie_260"&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Iran: Roots and Results of Revolution|last=Keddie|first=Nikki R.|authorlink=Nikki Keddie|author2=[[Yann Richard]]|year=2003|page=260|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Connecticut|isbn=0-300-09856-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1987, Montazeri created more controversy when he called for the legalization of political parties, though under strict regulation.&lt;ref name="Moin_277"&gt;Moin, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this by calling for "an open assessment of failures" of the Revolution and an end to the [[export of revolution]], saying that Iran should inspire by example, not train and arm allied groups.&lt;ref name="Keddie_260"/&gt; Khomeini responded the next February by criticizing Montazeri and a month later called for a meeting of the Assembly of Experts to "discuss him."&lt;ref name="Keddie_260"/&gt;

Things came to a head following the [[1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners|mass execution]] of political prisoners in late summer and early autumn 1988. Montazeri gave a series of lectures in which he indicated support for a "far more open" policy&lt;ref name="Moin_279"&gt;Moin, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; and in an interview published in ''Keyhan'' in early 1989, criticized Khomeini in language that is said to have sealed "his political fate":
&lt;blockquote&gt;The denial of people's rights, injustice and disregard for the revolution's true values have delivered the most severe blows against the revolution. Before any reconstruction [takes place], there must first be a political and ideological reconstruction... This is something that the people expect of a leader.&lt;ref name="Moin_279"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Hussein-Ali Montazeri And Ali Khamenei.jpg|thumb|Montazeri and later [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] [[Ali Khamenei]]]]
Still worse for him were the publication abroad and broadcast on the BBC of his letters condemning the post-war wave of executions in March 1989.&lt;ref name="Moin_287"&gt;Moin, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Montazeri also criticized Khomeini's fatwa ordering the assassination of author [[Salman Rushdie]] saying: "People in the world are getting the idea that our business in Iran is just murdering people."&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{cite book|title=The last great revolution: turmoil and transformation in Iran| last=Wright|first=Robin B.|year=2000|page=20|publisher=A. A. Knopf|location=New York|isbn=0-375-40639-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 March 1989, a furious Khomeini strongly denounced Montazeri's actions, and two days later announced that Montazeri had resigned his post.&lt;ref name="Dismissal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irvl.net/Translation%20of%20Ayatollah%20Khomeini's%20Letter%20Dismissing%20Montazeri.htm |title=Translation of Ayatollah Khomeini's Letter Dismissing Montazeri |accessdate=7 June 2007 |publisher=Iran Virtual Library |work=printed in Abrar |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313222514/http://www.irvl.net/Translation%20of%20Ayatollah%20Khomeini%27s%20Letter%20Dismissing%20Montazeri.htm |archivedate=13 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Montazeri did not protest his loss, issuing a message concluding, "I ask all brothers and sisters not to utter a word in my support."&lt;ref name="Moin_289"&gt;Moin, 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to losing his position as designated heir, Montazeri's title of Grand Ayatollah was withdrawn, publication of his lectures in the 
''[[Kayhan]]'' newspaper and references to him on the state radio were stopped, his portraits were ordered by the then Prime Minister [[Mir Hossein Mousavi]] to be removed from offices and mosques,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alef.ir/1388/content/view/60225/|title=الف - بخشنامه موسوي درباره عكس‌ منتظري/تصویر|first=|last=Behnegarsoft.com|website=alef.ir|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226020034/http://alef.ir/1388/content/view/60225|archivedate=26 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his security guards were withdrawn. "Articles and editorials appeared in various newspapers aimed at dismantling" Montazeri's "impeccable" revolutionary credentials."&lt;ref name="Moin_290-1"&gt;Moin, 290–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to numerous sources, the amendment to Iran's constitution removing the requirement that the [[Supreme Leader]] be a [[Marja'|Marja]] was instituted to deal with the problem of a lack of any remaining Grand Ayatollahs willing to accept "illimitable velayat-e faqih".&lt;ref name="Mackey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moin_293"&gt;Moin, 293.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roy"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Failure of Political Islam| last=Roy|first=Olivier|authorlink=Olivier Roy (professor)|year=1994|pages=173–4|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-29140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others said the reason marjas were not elected was because of their lack of votes in the Assembly of Experts. For example, Grand Ayatollah [[Mohammad Reza Golpaygani]] had the backing of only thirteen members of the assembly. Furthermore, there were other marjas present who accepted "illimitable velayat-e faqih".&lt;ref name="RadioFarda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiofarda.com/Article/2006/12/08/f2_rafsanjani.html|script-title=fa:آیت الله خامنه ای با ولایت فرد مخالف بود|accessdate=17 September 2007|work=Radio Farda|language=Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aftab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aftabnews.ir/vdchmzn23-nkm.html|script-title=fa:توضیحات هاشمی درباره شورای رهبری|accessdate=17 September 2007|work=Aftab News|date=7 December 2006|language=Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later dissent and house arrest==
Khomeini died in June 1989 and another cleric, [[Ali Khamenei|Seyed Ali Khamene'i]], was selected by the Assembly of Experts to be the new Supreme Leader. Khamenei had been only a mid-ranking [[Hojatoleslam]] before Montazeri's removal. His promotion was, sometimes silently and sometimes openly, rejected by many Shi'a,&lt;ref name="Keddie_262"&gt;Keddie, 262.&lt;/ref&gt; including Montazeri.

In December 1989, Montazeri's supporters in Qom distributed "[[night letter]]s" questioning Khamenei's qualifications to be a [[Marja'|Marja]] e Taqlid ("Source of Emulation"), or in other words, an Ayatollah. In retaliation [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] "detained and humiliated" Montazeri, "forcing him to wear his nightcap rather than his white turban."&lt;ref name="Brumberg"/&gt;

In October 1997, after openly criticizing the authority of the Iranian Supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei, Ayatollah Montazeri was placed under house arrest under the pretext of protecting him from hardliners. He was finally freed from house arrest in 2003&lt;ref name="BBC_release"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2707513.stm|title=Iran releases dissident cleric|accessdate=8 June 2007|publisher=BBC News|date=30 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FOX News"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,97567,00.html|title=Dissident Ayatollah Demands Iran's Rulers Be Elected|accessdate=8 June 2007|publisher=FOX News|date=17 September 2003|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; after "more than 100 Iranian legislators" called on President Khatami to free Montazeri. Some thought that the government lifted the house arrest to avoid the possibility of a popular backlash if the ailing Montazeri died while in custody.&lt;ref name="Keddie_283"&gt;Keddie, 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the government===
On 22 January 2007, Grand Ayatollah Montazeri criticized the former [[Iranian President]] [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] for his nuclear and economic policies.&lt;ref name="BBC_attack"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6286771.stm|title=Iranian cleric attacks president|accessdate=8 June 2007|publisher=BBC News|date=22 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USATODAY"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-01-22-iran_x.htm|title=Top dissident cleric slams Ahmadinejad|accessdate=8 June 2007|work=USA Today|date=22 January 2007|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While agreeing Iran had the right to develop nuclear energy, he called Ahmadinejad's approach to the issue aggressive, saying, "One has to deal with the enemy with wisdom, not provoke it, ... his (provocation) only creates problems for the country"&lt;ref name="USATODAY" /&gt; and asked, "Don't we have other rights too?", referring to individual and human rights.&lt;ref name="BBC_attack"/&gt; Montazeri also criticized the economic performance of Ahmadinejad's administration's, noting the rate of inflation—including a 50% increase in housing costs&lt;ref name="BBC_attack"/&gt;—arguing that a country cannot be run on "[[slogan]]s".&lt;ref name="RFERL"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/01/e984327d-c92b-4a08-b9cc-c4c903d8f5ae.html|title=Iranian Dissident Cleric Criticized Ahmadinejad|accessdate=8 June 2007|publisher=Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty|date=22 January 2007|agency=The Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montazeri, in a 2008 interview with [[Voice of America|the Voice of America]] concerning the 29th anniversary of the revolution, stated that the revolution had given Islam a bad name, arguing "Unfortunately, it is only by name that the revolution remains Islamic. Its content has changed, and what is taking place in the name of Islam gives a bad image of the religion. This is the religion of kindness and tolerance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Persian TV weekly highlights|url=http://ir.voanews.com/content/a-31-2008-02-19-voa20-62768327/635240.html|accessdate=4 August 2013|work=Voice of America|date=19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also issued a statement in 2008 in support of the rights of the [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|Baha'is]] in the Islamic Republic, saying that though Baha'is were not [[People of the Book]] like [[Jew]]s, [[Christian]]s and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], nonetheless: &lt;blockquote&gt; "they are the citizens of this country, they have the right of citizenship and to live in this country. Furthermore, they must benefit from the Islamic compassion which is stressed in [[Quran]] and by the religious authorities."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mideastyouth.com/2008/05/22/ayatollah-montazeri-proclaims-bahais-citizens-of-iran/ Ayatollah Montazeri proclaims bahais citizens of iran] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120904164856/http://www.mideastyouth.com/2008/05/22/ayatollah-montazeri-proclaims-bahais-citizens-of-iran/ |date=4 September 2012 }} Middle East Youth, 22 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Montazeri again spoke out against Ahmadinejad on 16 June 2009 during the [[2009 Iranian election protests|protests]] against his reelection. Ahmadinejad was controversially reelected as president after a closely contested and disputed election, which involved many candidates, but whose leading vote-getters were Ahmadinejad and former Prime Minister [[Mir Hossein Mousavi]]. The government reported that Ahmadinejad had won the election with 62 percent of the vote. Montazeri stated that "No one in their right mind can believe" the results were fairly counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Warren P. |last1=Strobel |first2=Jonathan S. |last2=Landay |title=Iran's Senior Ayatollah Slams Election |work=McClatchy Newspapers |date=16 June 2009 |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/251/story/70155.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620062222/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/251/story/70155.html |archivedate=20 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Montazeri called for three days of public mourning for the [[death of Neda Agha-Soltan]] and others killed during 20 June protests. He further declared that the then current ruling government was neither Islamic nor a republic, but military.&lt;ref name=Guardian1&gt;{{cite news|title=Funeral of Iranian cleric Montazeri turns into political protest|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/21/iran-funeral-ayatollah-montazeri-protest|work=The Guardian|date=21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mic21sep&gt;{{cite news|last=Theodoulou|first=Michael|title=The Grand Ayatollah unleashes his wrath|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/the-grand-ayatollah-unleashes-his-wrath|accessdate=27 July 2013|newspaper=The National|date=21 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, on the day before the 30th anniversary celebration of the [[Iran hostage crisis]], Montazeri said that the occupation of the American embassy in 1979 had been a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/middleeast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14816819 Protests in Iran: Green November] ''The Economist''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights and gender==
While Ayatollah Montazeri has been celebrated as a champion of the rights of political prisoners, and human rights associated with the public sphere, in an interview &lt;ref name="payvand1"&gt;[http://www.payvand.com/news/06/mar/1067.html Interview with Ayatollah Montazeri by Golbarg Bashi] ''Payvand''&lt;/ref&gt; conducted in 2003 in Qom with the Iranian feminist academic [[Golbarg Bashi]] he said that while men and women enjoy the same dignity and respect in the eyes of God, women's rights must remain strictly under the domain of Shi'i [[fiqh]] rather than international human rights conventions such as [[CEDAW]].

In response to [[Golbarg Bashi]], Ayatollah Montazeri said:

{{quote|Women are humans too... When we say humans, it includes both men and women... you see, if people around the world want to say certain things about women for example being equal to men in matters of inheritance or legal testimony, because these issues pertain to the very letter of the Qur'an, we cannot accept them... Now, consider that God Almighty has made it incumbent upon men to cover the expenses of women... in Iran we cannot accept those laws that are against our religion... on certain occasions that these laws contradict the very clear text of the Qur'an, we cannot cooperate... Men in general (no'-e mard ha), all things considered, are productively more active—both intellectual activities and practical activities... All things considered, the intellectual and practical activities of men are more than women.}}

When Bashi informed him that currently (2003) in Iranian universities, "some 60% of students are women" and asked him "so in future generations, when the number of professors, physicians, high-ranking experts, etc, will be mostly women, will Islam be able to have an [[ijtihad]] and modify these unjust laws because they no longer correspond with reality?"

Ayatollah Montazeri responded: "Those aspects of the Islamic law that are based on the very letter of the Qur'an, the answer is no. But certain other things yes, you can, and they can be subject to changing times. But those that are from the very letter of the Qur'an, no they cannot, and those have certain wisdom and subtleties in them."&lt;ref name="payvand1"/&gt;

==Reputation==
Montazeri was described by his allies as "brilliant," down-to-earth, unpretentious, plain spoken, and as one who "lives plainly, and equates Islam with social justice" and stays above political infighting." His detractors portrayed him as stubborn and naïve in his insistence that the Islamic republic find reconciliation with the "[[People's Mujahedin of Iran|hypocrites]]" and "[[Freedom Movement of Iran|liberals]]" who are its "internal enemies."&lt;ref name="NY_rev"/&gt;

==Public image==
In late 1960s Montazeri gained influence and popularity in [[Isfahan Province]] after his speeches criticizing the Shah, moving [[SAVAK]] to banish and subsequently imprison him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Muhammad Sahimi]]|title=Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri: 1922-2009|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/12/grand-ayatollah-hossein-ali-montazeri-1922-2009.html|date=21 December 2009|access-date=29 June 2016|publisher=[[Tehran Bureau]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1980s Montazeri was known by the [[pejorative]] nickname ''Gorbeh Nareh'' ({{lang-fa|گربه‌نره}}, the masculine cat) after [[The Fox and the Cat|the Cat]], a character in the ''[[Piccolino no Bōken|Pinocchio]]'' animated series. According to [[Elaine Sciolino]], this was due to his "poor public speaking skills, squeaky voice, round face and grizzled beard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Persian Mirrors: The Elusive Face of Iran|author=[[Elaine Sciolino]]|year=2001|publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]]|isbn=0743217799|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
On 4 September 1942, he married Mah-Sultan Rabbani (1926 – 26 March 2010) and had seven children, four daughters and three sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Montazeri, Hossein Ali (1922–)|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2830800209.html|work=Biographical Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East and North Africa|accessdate=15 October 2013|date=1 June 2008}}{{Subscription required|via=Questia}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his sons, [[Mohammad Montazeri]] died in [[Hafte Tir bombing|a bomb]] blast at Islamic Republican Party headquarters in 1981 which was carried out by the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]]; another, Saeed Montazeri, lost an eye in the Iran-Iraq war in 1985. Another son, Ahmad Montazeri, is a cleric in Qom. The brother of Montazeri's son-in-law, [[Mehdi Hashemi]], was sentenced to death and executed after the 1979 revolution due to his alleged involvement in the murder of Ayatollah Abul Hassan Shams Abadi, who had been a critic of Montazeri, in Isfahan.&lt;ref name=mehdi2012/&gt;

He was described by Ayatollah Mohammad Guilani as "meticulous about, if not obsessed by, cleanliness."&lt;ref name=reutersprofile/&gt;

==Death==
[[Image:Montazeri tomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Montazeri in [[Fatima al-Masumeh Shrine]]]]

On 19 December 2009, Montazeri died in his sleep of [[heart failure]] at his home in [[Qom]], at the age of 87.&lt;ref name=telegraph_obituaries&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/6852503/Grand-Ayatollah-Hossein-Ali-Montazeri.html|title=Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=20 December 2009|location=London|accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Islamic Republic News Agency]], the official news agency of Iran, did not use the Ayatollah title in its initial reports of his death and referred to him as the "clerical figure of rioters".&lt;ref name=BBC_mourn&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8423319.stm|title=Crowds gather to mourn reformist Iran cleric Montazeri|work=BBC News|date=20 December 2009|accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state television and radio broadcasters were similar, showing the tension between the government and its opponents.&lt;ref name=AP_Iranian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hQgPwTlHbsrYZAADlwDl3knsYBZgD9CN3M3O0| title=Iranian dissident cleric Montazeri dies|work=Associated Press|date=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:The funeral of Grand Ayatollah Hosein-Ali Montazeri-2009-1.jpg|thumb|left|The funeral of Grand Ayatollah Hosein-Ali Montazeri]]
On 21 December, hundreds of thousands of mourners and the [[Iranian Green Movement|Green Movement]] supporters from across Iran turned out in Montazeri's funeral and turned the funeral to a massive protest against the Iranian government. The funeral service for him began at his house and funeral prayers were held at the Grand Mosque in Qom.&lt;ref name=qantara12&gt;{{cite news|last=Sartowicz|first=Urs|title=The Search for Montazeri's Heirs|url=http://en.qantara.de/The-Search-for-Montazeris-Heirs/20385c22309i0p/|accessdate=27 July 2013|newspaper=Qantara|date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the special prayers by Ayatollah Mousa Shabiri Zanjani,&lt;ref name=rooz&gt;{{cite news|title=Million-Man Show of Force|url=http://www.roozonline.com/english/news3/newsitem/archive/2009/december/23/article/million-man-show-of-force.html|accessdate=27 July 2013|newspaper=Rooz|date=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; his body was laid to rest in [[Fatima Masumeh Shrine|the Fatima Masumeh Shrine]].&lt;ref name=telegraph1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/6856357/Grand-Ayatollah-Montazeris-funeral-sees-hundreds-of-thousands-challenge-the-Iranian-regime.html|title=Grand Ayatollah Montazeri's funeral sees hundreds of thousands challenge the Iranian regime|first=Richard|last=Spencer|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=21 December 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried alongside his son, Mohammad Montazeri.&lt;ref name=stirs&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6964563.ece Ayatollah's death stirs Iranian opposition to bitter protests] ''Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pay2009dec&gt;{{cite web|title=Funeral of A Revered Ayatollah, Hossein Ali Montazeri|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/09/dec/1218.html|work=Payvand|accessdate=2 August 2013|date=21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protesters chanted opposition slogans, including "Our shame, our shame, our idiot leader", and “Dictator, this is your last message: the people of Iran are rising!”

Although the police mostly stayed clear of the funeral, there were some skirmishes between protesters and the Basij militia. Also on 21 December, inside the Qom shrine where Montazeri’s body was laid to rest, opposition activists gathered and chanted “Death to the dictator.” When one group of pro-government basiji militiamen came toward them, chanting “Death to the hypocrites,” the crowd changed to an anti-basiji slogan. Then they took out money, offering it to the basiji, and chanted that they were acting as paid mercenaries of the government: “Where is the oil money? Spent on the Basiji,” and “Basij’s great pride, rape in prison.”&lt;ref name=energized&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2009/1221/Iran-opposition-energized-by-Montazeri-funeral-in-Qom-say-eyewitnesses/(page)/2 Iran opposition energized by Montazeri funeral in Qom, say eyewitnesses] ''The CS Monitor'', 21 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]] stepped out from the compound of [[Yousef Sane'i|Grand Ayatollah Saanei]], a fellow reformist, to cross the street to Montazeri’s house in Qom. At that moment, a group of 30 bearded men, holding Montazeri pictures to blend into the crowd, dropped the portraits, started attacking Mousavi and shouted “death to the hypocrite.” The former candidate had to be hustled quickly into the Montazeri compound. The same thing happened when cleric [[Mehdi Karroubi]] stepped into the street. This time, groups of reformists were ready and pushed back the vigilantes, so that Karroubi could pass.&lt;ref name=energized/&gt;

As the funeral procession ended, security forces poured into the city, blocking roads to the Ayatollah's house and tearing down posters of the Ayatollah. Mourners were reported to have thrown stones at police who tried to stop them chanting pro-Montazeri slogans. Mourners responded defiantly when ordered by loudspeaker not to chant, breaking into shouts of "Ya Hossein, Mir Hossein" in support of Mir Hossein Mousavi. When a crowd of pro-government supporters chanted back: "I will give my life for the supreme leader," they were booed by mourners, a witness said.&lt;ref name=Guardian1/&gt; The security forces prevented the Ayatollah's family from holding a planned memorial ceremony in the grand mosque of Qom following the funeral.&lt;ref name="funeral"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/world/middleeast/22cleric.html?_r=1&amp;hp|work=The New York Times|title=Cleric's Funeral Becomes Protest of Iran Leaders|first1=Robert F.|last1=Worth|first2=Nazila|last2=Fathi| date=22 December 2009|accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the reformist website Kalameh, men on motorbikes, believed to be Ahmadinejad supporters, attacked the car carrying Mir Hossein Mousavi back from Qom to Tehran. They insulted Mousavi, smashed the back window and injured one of his aides.&lt;ref name=stirs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/Iran-s-Ayatollah-Montazeri-buried-in-Qom-amid-protests/H1-Article1-489156.aspx Iran's Ayatollah Montazeri buried in Qom amid protests] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606132630/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Iran-s-Ayatollah-Montazeri-buried-in-Qom-amid-protests/H1-Article1-489156.aspx |date=6 June 2011 }} ''Hindustan Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also protests in Najafabad, birthplace of Ayatollah Montazeri. Internet videos showed protesters waving green banners and chanting, “Dictator, dictator, Montazeri is alive!” and “Oh Montazeri, your path will be followed even if the dictator shoots us all!”&lt;ref name="funeral"/&gt;

====22 and 23 December====
On 22 December, Ahmadinejad continued his quest to strip his opponents of their last vestiges of political power. He interrupted a visit to [[Shiraz]] to return to Tehran and remove Mir Hossein Mousavi, the main opposition leader he defeated in the presidential election, as head of the state Academy of Arts and Culture- a post he had held for ten years.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8427806.stm Clashes at Montazeri ceremony, Iran opposition says] ''BBC''&lt;/ref&gt; Hardliners also want Mousavi arrested for his role in inciting unrest since the disputed June election.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/12/24/2780083.htm?section=justin Women, children beaten at memorial service] ''ABC'', 24 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 December, Iranian security forces clashed with tens of thousands of opposition supporters in the city of [[Isfahan]], according to opposition website reports. Activists said police used tear gas, pepper spray and batons to disperse people gathering to commemorate Grand Ayatollah Montazeri in the Seyed mosque. People had gathered at the main mosque for the memorial service, but when they arrived the doors were closed and security forces told them to leave. Afterwards, security forces began beating people, including women and children with batons, chains and stones, used tear gas and pepper spray and arrested at least 50 people, including four journalists and a cleric, Masoud Abid, who was to deliver the sermon. Many were also injured. One witness said, "They took people in the shops and beat them up mostly out of public vision although some beatings happened outside on the streets." Security forces also sealed off the home of Ayatollah [[Jalal Al-Din Taheri]], who organised the service and used to lead Friday prayers in Isfahan until he resigned in 2002 in protest at the government’s growing authoritarianism.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8428252.stm Iran government supporters stage demo] ''BBC''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8429193.stm|title=BBC News - Iranian opposition protests show defiance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/12/23/iran.demonstrations/ Fresh protests, clashes reported in Iran] ''CNN'', 23 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6967004.ece Iranian security forces suppress new wave of opposition protests in Isfahan] ''Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, footage sent to the [[BBC]] from [[Najafabad]] showed crowds chanting "Criminals, rapists, death to the leadership" and "We're not afraid, we're not afraid" as security men watched from rooftops.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Police severely attacked mourners and protesters in several cities, with many wounded and arrested. The government also announced that banknotes with anti-government annotation, which recently spread across the country, will be forbidden starting from 8 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5BN2Y720091224|work=Reuters|title=Iran security clashes with cleric mourners|date=24 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====24 December====
On 24 December, opposition web sites reported that police in Tehran and the northwestern city of [[Zanjan (city)|Zanjan]] clashed with protesters defying an order by the Iranian government banning memorial services for Montazeri. Protesters marched in Imam Khomeini Square in southern Tehran in a sign of mourning for Montazeri. The protesters chanted, "Today is a mourning day; the green nation of Iran is mourning today"—a reference to the trademark color of the opposition. The police attacked the protesters with clubs and tear gas. Older women tried to prevent the arrest of young men by throwing themselves on them, and were severely beaten by officers who intended to drag the young men away.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/25/world/middleeast/25cleric.html Police Try to Quell Protesters Who Mourn Iranian Cleric] ''The New York Times'', 25 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the police in Zanjan, a city of mostly Turkish speakers, tried to prevent a mourning ceremony for Montazeri by locking the mosque where the ceremony was to be held and attacking mourners who chanted outside it. It was mentioned that: “The police beat people with such violence that many suffered from broken legs, arms and noses.” There were also many arrests.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

====26 December====
Witnesses and opposition websites reported the following incidents:
*There were protests in several areas of the capital, including the poorer areas of south Tehran, and government forces were using tear gas to try to disperse demonstrators.&lt;ref name="Renewed clashes reported in Iran"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8430786.stm Renewed clashes reported in Iran] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;
*Clashes were reported in northern Tehran near [[Jamaran]] mosque (where Khomeini used to address people), between thousands of opposition supporters (who shouted anti-government slogans) and riot police. Reformist ex-President Mohammad Khatami had been due to speak at the mosque to mark the Shiite holy day of [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]]. However, security officials cancelled the Ashura speech to be given by Khatami and also surrounded the mosque. A reformist website reported about 50 plainclothes forces breaking into Jamaran mosque and attacking people. Riot police also fired tear gas during the incident. Protesters shouted, "death to this dictatorship" and "if Khomeini was alive, he would sure be with us," according to witnesses. A witness also said, "Police told them they have five minutes to leave and, when they were still shouting slogans and persisted, policemen on motorbikes drove through the crowds and fired teargas." Riot police and members of the Basij also chased demonstrators into the nearby bustling [[Niavaran]] street and fired paintballs at them. The security forces also arrested several protesters. Clashes were also reported between police and protesters near another north Tehran mosque, Dar al-Zahra, which is known to host reformist clerics.&lt;ref name="Renewed clashes reported in Iran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jH7jEVWsvaTFE_pEzrBFTfZhUIsg|title=Iran anti-government clashes erupt on Shiite holy day|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/Iran-police-clash-with-protesters-in-north-Tehran-Report/articleshow/5382901.cms Iran police clash with protesters in north Tehran: Report] India Times&lt;/ref&gt;
*Opposition supporters had gathered in groups along a stretch of a main Tehran city centre route several kilometres long, but police were out in force and were not letting them join each other. Earlier, there were clashes at several points along Enghelab Street, a main thoroughfare where months earlier hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters had staged protest marches after Ahmadinejad's disputed re-election. Police also stopped and arrested the passengers of a bus near Enghelab Square because they were chanting pro-opposition slogans. Some protesters were reported to have chanted: "The dictator must know that he will soon be overthrown."&lt;ref name="Renewed clashes reported in Iran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article6968496.ece|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/27/iran-protests-riot-police-shots Iran hit by new clashes as crowds protest during religious ceremonies] The Guardian, 27 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
*Tension was running high at rallies in which protesters were chanting anti-government slogans in three areas of central Tehran. Government forces, including soldiers of the elite Revolutionary Guard and the paramilitary Basiji, are said to have reacted aggressively—beating protesters with batons, firing warning shots into the air to disperse demonstrators, using teargas and pepper spray and smashing the windscreens of cars that were hooting in protest, as well as making numerous arrests.&lt;ref name="Renewed clashes reported in Iran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;
*Security forces chased protesters into a building housing the offices of the [[Iranian Students News Agency|ISNA]] news agency, where some demonstrators had sought shelter during the clashes, ISNA said, adding one of its reporters had been injured when security forces had attacked the building. An eyewitness said at least two people were injured when police chased after protesters into the building. “They fractured the skull of one ISNA person and badly beat up another employee,” the witness said. ISNA's news service appeared to be working normally and it later issued a report on the incident, saying one of its reporters had been injured without specifying who was to blame.&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"/&gt;
*An elderly woman travelling on a city bus in the area was heard urging passengers to chant slogans such as "Ya Hossein, Mir Hossein" in support of opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi, a witness said. The witness said passengers on the packed bus also chanted "Our Neda is not dead, it is the government which is dead," referring to protestor [[Neda Agha Soltan]], who bled to death during a 20 June protest in shocking scenes caught on video and viewed by millions around the world.&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt;
*Witnesses said riot police fired warning shots in several areas of Tehran to deter demonstrators, many of whom chanted slogans increasingly against the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's most powerful figure, rather than President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;
*Clashes were reported in cities including Isfahan, [[Kermanshah]] and Shiraz, as opposition supporters used the Tasua and Ashura ceremonies to take to the streets.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;

In 2010, the office of Montazeri that had been run by his son Ahmad was closed on the orders of Ali Khameini.&lt;ref name=qantara12/&gt;

An '''instant''' is an [[infinitesimal]] moment in [[time]], a moment whose passage is instantaneous.

The continuous nature of time and its infinite divisibility was addressed by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', where he wrote on [[Zeno's paradoxes]]. The philosopher and mathematician [[Bertrand Russell]] was still seeking to define the exact nature of an instant thousands of years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=29E9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA129 |title=The structure of time |author=W. Newton-Smith |chapter=The Russellian construction of instants |page=129 |publisher=Routledge |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-7102-0389-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], a theoretical lower-bound unit of time called the [[Planck time]] has been proposed, that being the time required for [[light]] to travel a distance of 1&amp;nbsp;[[Planck length]].&lt;ref name="gsu_hbase"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/planck.html | title = Big Bang models back to Planck time | publisher = [[Georgia State University]] | date = 19 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Planck time is theorized to be the smallest time measurement that will ever be possible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/P/Planck+Time |title=Planck Time |encyclopedia =COSMOS - The SAO Encyclopedia of Astronomy |publisher= Swinburne University}}&lt;/ref&gt; roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds. Within the framework of the laws of physics as they are understood today, for times less than one Planck time apart, one can neither measure nor detect any change. It is therefore physically impossible, with current technology, to determine if any action exists that causes a reaction in "an instant", rather than a reaction occurring after an interval of time too short to observe or measure.

{{As of|2016|November}}, the smallest time interval uncertainty in direct measurements is on the order of 850 zeptoseconds (850 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−21&lt;/sup&gt; seconds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-measure-the-smallest-fragment-of-time-ever-witness-an-electron-escaping-an-atom|title=Scientists have measured the smallest fragment of time ever|last=|first=|date=2010-05-12|website=|publisher=|accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Itsunen Shoyu''' ({{zh|t=逸然性融}}，1601 in [[Hangzhou]], [[Zhejiang]], [[China]] &amp;ndash; 1668 in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Japan]]) is famous as a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk and painter who helped to establish [[Zen|Chan]] (Zen) in [[Japan]]. He was also the third abbot of [[Kofukuji (Nagasaki)|Kofukuji Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kofukuji.com/contents.php?contID=1 縁起/ゆかりの唐僧 ]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his skill of painting, he also practices the art of [[Seal carving]] and cemented the popularity of this art in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kofukuji.com/contents.php?contID=1 縁起/ゆかりの唐僧：初期黄檗僧が用いた見事な印章は書を引き立たせ、わが国に篆刻の楽しさ、印章の美しさへの目を開かせた。]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1642 he travelled to [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] as a trader in [[Chinese medicine]], and in 1644 entered [[Kofukuji (Nagasaki)|Kofukuji Temple]], becoming its 3rd abbot in 1645. Established by monks immigrated from China, the temple was then a base of the [[Ōbaku]] school of Zen Buddhism in Japan.  In 1654 after multiple requests he succeeded in persuading [[Yinyuan Longqi]] (Ingen Ryuki), the 33rd [[abbot]] of [[Wanfu Temple]] ([[Mount Huangbo]], [[Fujian]]) to emigrate to [[Japan]], where he founded [[Ōbaku (school of Buddhism)|Ōbaku]], the third and final major Japanese [[Zen]] [[Schools of Buddhism|sect]].

Itsunen was a talented late [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] style painter of Buddhist figural subjects, and is known to have copied works by [[Chen Xian (painter)|Chen Xian]] brought to Japan by [[Yinyuan Longqi]].

'''Johannes Bronkhorst''' (born 17 July 1946, [[Schiedam]]){{citation needed|date=August 2016}} is an [[Indologist]] and specialist on early [[Buddhism]]. He is emeritus professor at the [[University of Lausanne]]. After studying Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy at the [[Vrije Universiteit]] in Amsterdam (B.Sc. 1968), he moved to India, where he turned to [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]], first at the [[University of Rajasthan]] (Jaipur), then the [[University of Pune]] (M.A. 1976, Ph.D. 1979). In Pune he read with traditional Sanskrit scholars specializing in Sanskrit grammar and philosophy. Back in the Netherlands, he did a second doctorate (1980) at the [[University of Leiden]]. Having worked for research projects funded by the [[Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek]], he was appointed, in 1987, to the position of Professor of Sanskrit and Indian studies at the University of Lausanne. He  retired in 2011.

Bronkhorst has concentrated on the history of Indian thought and published on a wide range of topics, including indigenous grammar and linguistics, the interaction between [[Brahmanism]], Buddhism and [[Jainism]] and their philosophical schools and religious practices. A key output of this work appeared in his monograph ''Greater Magadha'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Bronkhorst, ''Greater Magadha: Studies in the Culture of Early India'' (Leiden, 2007). For the publication see: http://www.brill.nl/greater-magadha&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been reviewed by several scholars including Jason Neelis &lt;ref&gt;In ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'': http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=5857332&lt;/ref&gt; and Alexander Wynne.&lt;ref&gt;H-Net Reviews: http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=31537&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Bronkhort's publications address larger questions relating to the theory and study of religion. The website of the University of Lausanne provides access to some of his work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://applicationspub.unil.ch/interpub/noauth/php/Un/UnPers.php?PerNum=3139&amp;LanCode=8&amp;menu=pub Unisciences - UNIL - Johannes Bronkhorst]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronkhorst became a corresponding member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/correspondents/3951?set_language=en |title=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19733">'''John William Miller''' (1895–1978) was an American philosopher in the idealist tradition. His work appears in six published volumes, including ''The Paradox of Cause'' (1978) and most recently The ''Task of Criticism'' (2006). His principal philosophical ambitions were 1) to reconcile the [[idealism]] of [[Josiah Royce]] and the [[pragmatism]] of [[William James]] and 2) to integrate philosophical thought and historical thought. As testimony to the integrative nature of his thinking, Miller referred to his philosophy as a "historical idealism” and a “naturalistic idealism.”

==Early years and education==
John William Miller was born on January 8, 1895 in [[Rochester, New York]]. He began his undergraduate education at [[Harvard University]] in 1912, transferred to the [[University of Rochester]] for his sophomore and junior years, and then returned to Cambridge, Massachusetts, for his senior year. Miller received his A. B. from Harvard in 1916. At the onset of American involvement in the First World War, Miller declared himself a conscientious objector and served as a volunteer in the ambulance corps in France with Base Hospital 44.

After the war, Miller returned to Harvard to begin graduate studies in philosophy. Among his teachers were philosophical realists such as [[Ralph Barton Perry]] and [[Edwin Holt|Edwin Bissell Holt]] as well as idealists such as [[William Ernest Hocking]] and [[Clarence Irving Lewis]].  It is still fair to say, however, that Miller’s strongest philosophical influences dated from the 19th century and were, most prominently, the German idealists [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] was also an important influence on the American side. In 1921 Miller received his master's degree and, under the direction of Hocking, went on to compose a work on the fundamental connection among epistemology, semiotics, and ontology. This work, titled "The Definition of the Thing," earned him the doctorate in 1922.

Miller's teaching career began in 1922 with an appointment at [[Connecticut College]]. During this time he married Katherine S. Gisel (1897–1993). In the fall of 1924 he took a position at [[Williams College]] in the Berkshire Mountains of northwest Massachusetts.

==Williams College years==
Apart from two summer sessions and a one-year visiting appointment at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1937–1938, Miller’s teaching career was spent at Williams College until his retirement in 1960. He served as chair of the philosophy department from 1931 to 1955 and influenced three generations of students. (Miller was often selected by graduating classes as the most influential professor at Williams and twice the college yearbook was dedicated to him.) From 1945 on he was Mark Hopkins Professor of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy, a title inherited from his colleague and predecessor as chair, the critical realist [[James Bissett Pratt]].

During his early years at Williams, Miller and Katherine raised their two sons, Eugene (born 1925) and Paul (born 1928).

===Pedagogy===
At Williams, Miller taught courses across the whole philosophical curriculum—i.e., epistemology, metaphysics, [[aesthetics]], semiotics, and political philosophy. Perhaps his greatest innovation in the classroom was the introduction of a course in the philosophy of history at a time when [[positivism]] was further separating philosophical reflection from historical thinking.

There was also no separating Miller’s historical idealism from his pedagogical philosophy. He was known to say, "I cannot understand a man unless I take him at his word." Classroom discussion, the civil exchange of ideas, and having a personal stake in each philosophical conversation were essential. For Miller philosophy was a mode of utterance wherein one actually speaks (i.e., expresses himself) and takes responsibility for what is said (i.e., reflects upon himself).  Short of making both of these commitments—i.e., to expression and reflection—honest conversation is no more possible than is philosophy. The speech of the classroom serves to highlight the philosophical bases of conversation.

===Influence on writing===
It was as a teacher and not as a scholar that Miller was best known initially. Indeed, his reputation as a thinker spread via his teaching practice and the modest fame that came to him by means of the accounts of his former students. (See George Brockway’s essay on Miller, first published in the journal of the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]], ''The American Scholar'', and later reprinted in ''Masters: Portraits of Great Teachers'' wherein Miller was grouped with educators of renown such as [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Morris Raphael Cohen]].) However, because he focused on his teaching and did most of his writing in the context of preparing lecturers and philosophical correspondence, Miller did not focus on formal scholarly publication.

In the 1930s he published two important articles in ''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]'': "The Paradox of Cause" (1935) and "Accidents Will Happen" (1937). After these two publications, he presented four public papers: "Freedom as a Characteristic of Man in a Democratic Society" ([[American Political Science Association]], Chicago, 1938), "History and Humanism" (Harvard Philosophy Club, 1948), "The Midworld" (Harvard Philosophy Club, 1952), and "The Scholar as Man of the World" (Phi Beta Kappa Society, [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart College]], 1952). This small number of essays and statements made available to public audiences belied the fact that in private Miller was a prodigious writer who was actively at work developing a coherent philosophical system organized around his central concept, ''the midworld''. It would not be until his retirement that he would gather his writings and begin to make his historical idealism known to people other than his students and occasional auditors.

==Philosophy==
Upon his retirement in 1960, Miller remained in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts|Williamstown]] and continued his practice of philosophical conversation. However, the years of his retirement found Miller faced with the strong encouragement of a handful of former students who urged him to publish the four public addresses just mentioned and some of the many essays that he had penned over the years. In 1961 Miller published "The Ahistoric and the Historic" as an Afterword to a volume of translated essays by [[José Ortega y Gasset]], ''History as a System and Other Essays Toward a Philosophy of History''. Finally, by the late 1970s, Miller gathered a collection of his essays, which were published just before his death under the title ''The Paradox of Cause and Other Essays''.

The philosophy that one finds in ''The Paradox of Cause'' and such posthumous works as ''The Philosophy of History'' (1981), ''The Midworld of Symbols and Functioning Objects'' (1982), and ''In Defense of the Psychological'' (1983) is a hybrid. Miller consciously sought a middle route through the oppositions of realism and idealism as well as pragmatism and idealism.  It is a synthesis and revision of those contesting positions. For Miller philosophy was not the means of removing strife but, rather, the recognition and thoughtful organization of conflict. "To philosophize," Miller wrote, "is to be in thoughtful control of a problem." One important way of describing his thinking, then, is to say that Miller's philosophical synthesis does not effectively resolve the conflicts of his predecessors but shows the philosophical import of their disputes and the way in which their contests outline what must be ingredient in any worthwhile philosophy. His conception defines [[critical philosophy|philosophy as the activity of criticism]] in the Kantian sense of that term—i.e., to be aware of the conditions of one's endeavors.

As stated above, Miller’s philosophy unites philosophical thinking and historical thinking. In doing so he fully integrated concepts of action and symbolism into his epistemology and metaphysics. The fruits of this approach are seen in his ethical and political philosophy.

===Definition and action===
In his dissertation and subsequent book ''The Definition of the Thing With Some Notes on Language'' (1980), Miller tied together [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]] via an examination of the process of [[definition]]. Here the possibility of “static definition” was attacked—i.e., a definition that has no connection to [[action (philosophy)|action]] and a defined thing that is fundamentally ahistorical. Unless definition is considered in this manner, Miller argued, we cannot make sense of 1) our own participation in the process and the establishment of meaning, and 2) the evolution and constant refinement of our understanding of things in the world. There is a dynamic relationship between the universal and particular, the terms of definition (predicates) and the thing defined.

The process of definition is founded on human action and meaning understood as "meaning for a human actor." At the bottom of definition is, Miller contended, an unending search for local control—i.e., an understanding of oneself and one’s world that was adequate to support a plan of action. Definition thus ties in with pragmatism. But Miller was careful to underscore that his appropriation of pragmatism was not a crude pragmatism of simple means–ends thinking. Rather Miller saw the fundamental practicality of universal ideas and fundamental concepts which provide general order to our world (e.g., mathematics, language) but which are, on their face, not useful in any immediate sense. Definition links together individual actors and universal concepts in an existential dialectic in which meaning is established and revised.

===Midworld===
The ''midworld'' was one of Miller’s central [[idea]]s and also one of his most difficult to understand. First it needs to be stated that the midworld of [[semiotics|symbols]] and what Miller called ‘’functioning objects’’, is part of his answer to the [[problem of universals]]. What are these universals that are part of the process of definition? How do they arise? How do they relate to particulars? Miller’s response to these age-old questions was to say that universals are always embodied and they are always applied (and so made evident) in action. Just so, the idea of space is established in measuring devices like rulers. Instruments such as clocks determine the idea of time. The idea of justice is founded in judicial courts. Rulers, clocks, courts—these are all symbolic objects or practices. They are also ''functioning objects'' in the sense that a ruler is only different from another piece of wood in terms of what one does with it; they are symbolic objects that exist in use and in no other way.

As Miller made clear in ''The Midworld of Symbols and Functioning Objects'', the midworld is not a ''world'' proper but rather the totality of all functioning objects (understanding ''object'' to have enough flexibility to include regularized practices and natural bodies such as the human organism). This open-ended collection of symbols is also not truly ''between'' anything. The midworld is not halfway between subjectivity and objectivity, the ideal and the real, or the natural and the artificial. It is more accurate to say that the functioning object is that thing which allows for one to disclose the subjective and the objective; it is not between these two worlds of experience but is in fact their condition of appearance. The symbols of the midworld are the vehicles by which we define ourselves, define our world, and engage in the ongoing process by which those definitions are revised in light of our discoveries about the world and our new demands for local control

===History===
Definition is a historical process and the symbols of the midworld have historical careers. The need to generate, maintain, and revise meanings is one way of understanding [[history]], and it is on such terms that we see the unity of epistemology, ontology, and [[metaphysics]] that provides a deep context in which we can grasp what Miller writes regarding definition, action, and symbol.

Miller embraced history in all his works but it is in ''The Philosophy of History'' that he drew a close connection between historical thinking and philosophical thinking. He did this in contrast to an ancient tradition (beginning at least with [[Plato]]) which joins philosophy with the timeless. However, as Miller noted, if philosophy is ahistoric then all philosophy can produce are observations. Philosophy cannot be related to or relevant for action. Of course, for proponents of the [[contemplation|contemplative life]] this was something that recommended the ahistoricism of philosophy. Miller not only questioned the fundamental premises of ahistoric philosophy by arguing that every observation or thought is an action and thus an engagement in history but he also cast doubt on the relevance of a philosophy that does not derive from and speak to our pressing concerns for personal order, meaning, and right action. Because Miller’s philosophy is fundamentally a philosophy of criticism, if we are to grasp the conditions of our endeavors (and thus have self-conscious and responsible lives) then our philosophy must be historical and go to the midworld as the historical career of those very conditions. Philosophy and history not only must come together but also, considered in the appropriate light, are the same.

===Ethics and politics===
A critical philosophy becomes a political philosophy by virtue of our involvement in a community. Historical and philosophical thought can be individual and the sort of responsibility about which Miller wrote is in an important sense a responsibility of an individual to and for herself. However, the concept of the individual begs its pair in society and political institutions, and so critical ethics must become critical politics. It is in this fashion that Miller’s historical idealism can be understood as a ''metaphysics of democracy'' (a term he borrowed from [[Walt Whitman|Walt Whitman’s]] ''Democratic Vistas'').

The ideal community provides people with the chance to act, the chance to be effective and become historical actors who maintain or revise the conditions of their endeavors. As one can see in ''The Task of Criticism'', in order for that to be so we need to support something not unlike [[Karl Popper|Karl Popper’s]] idea of an open society. Here Miller revisited the traditional connection between liberal democratic politics and the scientific community in which free and respectful speech is licensed, formal modes of criticism are supported, and orderly change and development is a key goal. In order to affect that, in both politics and science, Miller maintained that, as noted above, a historical and symbolic conception of rationality has to be endorsed.

Ultimately, for Miller, there is a convergence of historical study and political action. Scholarship and citizenship are two sides of the same coin in that they are two facets of an active and responsible life—i.e., understanding and then engaging with conditions of one’s endeavors.

==Final years==
While retirement did eventuate in the publication of ''The Paradox of Cause'', Miller passed his latter years quietly, conducting philosophy in the form of conversation and correspondence much as he had during his teaching career. Miller continued to write and clarify his philosophical position right up until his death on December 25, 1978. He was buried in the Westlawn Cemetery just west of the Williams College campus.

'''Joseph Lonchampt'''  (1825–1890) was a [[French people|French]] stockbroker and [[positivism|positivist]] writer.

Lonchampt had a religious view of positivism, composing a series of prayers dedicated to the "New great Being" i.e. "Humanity". He claimed that prayer or meditation as a mental exercise would ensure success and constituted a useful instrument to realise both personal and social improvement.&lt;ref name="Harp"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harp|first1=Gillis J.|title=Positivist Republic: Auguste Comte and the Reconstruction of American Liberalism, 1865-1920|date=2010|publisher=Penn State Press|location=University Park, Pennsylvania|page=41|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859 he was appointed professor of Popular Astronomy at the [[Association Polytechnique pour le développement de l'instruction publique]].&lt;ref name="CTHS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Association Polytechnique pour le développement de l'instruction publique|url=http://cths.fr/an/societe.php?id=100728&amp;proso=y#|website=cths.fr|publisher=Le comité des travaux historiques et scientifiques|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Priestley''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|r|iː|s|t|l|i}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/priestley "Priestley"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030033729/http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/priestley |date=30 October 2014 }}: ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'' – Complete &amp; Unabridged 2012 Digital Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; {{OldStyleDate|24 March|1733|13 March}} – 6 February 1804) was an 18th-century [[English Separatist]] [[theologian]], [[Natural philosophy|natural philosopher]], [[chemistry|chemist]], innovative [[Linguist|grammarian]], multi-subject educator, and [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Political philosophy|political theorist]] who published over 150 works.  He has historically been credited with the discovery of [[oxygen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=General Chemistry |edition=4th |author=H.&amp;nbsp;I. Schlesinger |year=1950 |page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; having isolated it in its gaseous state, although [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] and [[Antoine Lavoisier]] also have strong claims to the discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 53–60; Schofield (2004), 112–113. The difficulty in precisely defining the time and place of the "discovery" of oxygen, within the context of the developing [[chemical revolution]], is one of [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s central illustrations of the gradual nature of [[paradigm shift]]s in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his lifetime, Priestley's considerable scientific reputation rested on his invention of [[soda water]], his writings on [[electricity]], and his discovery of several "airs" (gases), the most famous being what Priestley dubbed "dephlogisticated air" (oxygen). However, Priestley's determination to defend [[phlogiston theory]] and to reject what would become the [[chemical revolution]] eventually left him isolated within the scientific community.

Priestley's science was integral to his theology, and he consistently tried to fuse [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationalism]] with Christian [[theism]].&lt;ref&gt;Tapper, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In his metaphysical texts, Priestley attempted to combine theism, [[materialism]], and [[determinism]], a project that has been called "audacious and original".&lt;ref name=Tap314/&gt; He believed that a proper understanding of the natural world would promote human [[Progress (history)|progress]] and eventually bring about the Christian [[millennialism|millennium]].&lt;ref name=Tap314&gt;Tapper, 314.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley, who strongly believed in the free and open exchange of ideas, advocated [[religious toleration|toleration]] and equal rights for [[English Dissenters|religious Dissenters]], which also led him to help found [[Unitarianism]] [[History of Unitarianism#England|in England]]. The controversial nature of Priestley's publications, combined with his outspoken support of the [[French Revolution]], aroused public and governmental suspicion; he was eventually forced to flee in 1791, first to London and then to the United States, after a mob [[Priestley Riots|burned down]] his Birmingham home and church. He spent his last ten years in [[Northumberland County, Pennsylvania]].

A scholar and teacher throughout his life, Priestley also made significant contributions to [[pedagogy]], including the publication of a seminal work on [[Grammar#History|English grammar]] and books on history, and he prepared some of the most influential early timelines. These educational writings were among Priestley's most popular works. It was his metaphysical works, however, that had the most lasting influence, being considered primary sources for [[utilitarianism]] by philosophers such as [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Herbert Spencer]].

==Early life and education (1733–55)==
[[File:PriestleyBirthplace.jpg|thumb|Priestley's birthplace (since demolished) in Fieldhead, [[Birstall, West Yorkshire]] – about six miles (10 km) southwest of [[Leeds]]&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=Black-and-white drawing of a two-story brick house along a road.]]

Priestley was born to an established English [[English Dissenters|Dissenting]] family (i.e. they did not conform to the [[Church of England]]) in [[Birstall, West Yorkshire|Birstall]], near [[Batley]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. He was the oldest of six children born to Mary Swift and Jonas Priestley, a [[finishing (textiles)|finisher]] of cloth. To ease his mother's burdens, Priestley was sent to live with his grandfather around the age of one. He returned home, five years later, after his mother died. When his father remarried in 1741, Priestley went to live with his aunt and uncle, the wealthy and childless Sarah and John Keighley, {{convert|3|mi|km}} from Fieldhead.&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=22788|title=Priestley, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Priestley was precocious—at the age of four he could flawlessly recite all 107 questions and answers of the [[Westminster Shorter Catechism]]—his aunt sought the best education for the boy, intending him for the ministry. During his youth, Priestley attended local schools where he learned Greek, Latin, and Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 2–12; Uglow, 72; Jackson, 19–25; Gibbs, 1–4; Thorpe, 1–11; Holt, 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1749, Priestley became seriously ill and believed he was dying. Raised as a devout [[Calvinist]], he believed a [[Conversion to Christianity|conversion experience]] was necessary for salvation, but doubted he had had one. This emotional distress eventually led him to question his theological upbringing, causing him to reject [[Unconditional election|election]] and to accept [[Universal reconciliation|universal salvation]]. As a result, the elders of his home church, the [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] Upper Chapel of [[Heckmondwike]], refused him admission as a full member.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 1, 7–8; Jackson, 25–30; Gibbs, 4; Priestley, ''Autobiography'', 71–73, 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley's illness left him with a permanent stutter and he gave up any thoughts of entering the ministry at that time. In preparation for joining a relative in trade in [[Lisbon]], he studied French, Italian, and German in addition to [[Aramaic]], and Arabic. He was tutored by the Reverend George Haggerstone, who first introduced him to higher mathematics, [[natural philosophy]], logic, and [[metaphysics]] through the works of [[Isaac Watts]], [[Willem 's Gravesande]], and [[John Locke]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 14, 28–29; Uglow, 72; Gibbs, 5; Thorpe, 11–12; Holt, 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daventry Academy===
Priestley eventually decided to return to his theological studies and, in 1752, matriculated at [[Daventry Academy|Daventry]], a Dissenting academy.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 28–29; Jackson, 30; Gibbs, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Because he had already read widely, Priestley was allowed to skip the first two years of coursework. He continued his intense study; this, together with the liberal atmosphere of the school, shifted his theology further leftward and he became a [[English Dissenters#Rational Dissenters|Rational Dissenter]]. Abhorring dogma and religious mysticism, Rational Dissenters emphasised the rational analysis of the natural world and the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;McEvoy (1983), 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley later wrote that the book that influenced him the most, save the Bible, was [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley's]] ''[[Observations on Man]]'' (1749). Hartley's psychological, philosophical, and theological treatise postulated a material [[Philosophy of mind|theory of mind]].&lt;!-- "philosophy of mind" link is better than "theory of mind" --&gt; Hartley aimed to construct a Christian philosophy in which both religious and moral "facts" could be scientifically proven, a goal that would occupy Priestley for his entire life. In his third year at Daventry, Priestley committed himself to the ministry, which he described as "the noblest of all professions".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Jackson, 33. See Schofield (1997), 40–57; Uglow, 73–74; Jackson, 30–34; Gibbs, 5–10; Thorpe, 17–22; Tapper, 314; Holt, 11–14; Garrett, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Schofield, Priestley's major modern biographer, describes his first "call" in 1755 to the Dissenting parish in [[Needham Market]], Suffolk, as a "mistake" for both Priestley and the congregation.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 62–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley yearned for urban life and theological debate, whereas Needham Market was a small, rural town with a congregation wedded to tradition. Attendance and donations dropped sharply when they discovered the extent of his [[heterodoxy]]. Although Priestley's aunt had promised her support if he became a minister, she refused any further assistance when she realised he was no longer a [[Calvinist]]. To earn extra money, Priestley proposed opening a school, but local families informed him that they would refuse to send their children. He also presented a series of scientific lectures titled "Use of the Globes" that was more successful.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 62–69; Jackson, 44–47; Gibbs, 10–11; Thorpe, 22–29; Holt, 15–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sweetbriar Hall plaque.jpg|thumb|Sweetbriar Hall plaque]]
Priestley's Daventry friends helped him obtain another position and in 1758 he moved to [[Nantwich]], Cheshire, living at [[Sweetbriar Hall]] in the town's Hospital Street; his time there was happier. The congregation cared less about Priestley's heterodoxy and he successfully established a school. Unlike many schoolmasters of the time, Priestley taught his students [[natural philosophy]] and even bought scientific instruments for them. Appalled at the quality of the available English grammar books, Priestley wrote his own: ''[[The Rudiments of English Grammar]]'' (1761).&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[The Rudiments of English Grammar]]; adapted to the use of schools. With observations on style''. London: Printed for R. Griffiths, 1761.&lt;/ref&gt; His innovations in the description of English grammar, particularly his efforts to dissociate it from [[Grammar#History|Latin grammar]], led 20th-century scholars to describe him as "one of the great grammarians of his time".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Schofield (1997), 79.&lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of ''Rudiments'' and the success of Priestley's school, [[Warrington Academy]] offered him a teaching position in 1761.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 77–79, 83–85; Uglow, 72; Jackson 49–52; Gibbs, 13–16; Thorpe, 30–32; Holt, 19–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warrington Academy (1761–1767)==

In 1761, Priestley moved to [[Warrington]] and assumed the post of tutor of modern languages and rhetoric at [[Warrington Academy|the town's Dissenting academy]], although he would have preferred to teach mathematics and natural philosophy. He fitted in well at Warrington, and made friends quickly.&lt;ref name="Schofield"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schofield |first1=Robert E. |title=Enlightened joseph priestley : a study of his life and work from 1773 to 1804. |date=2009 |publisher=Penn State Univ Press |location=University Park |isbn=978-0-271-03625-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGHiCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT57 |accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included [[John Aikin]], his sister [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld|Anna Laetitia Aikin]], and [[Josiah Wedgwood]]. Wedgwood met Priestley in 1762, after a fall from his horse. Wedgwood and Priestley met rarely, but exchanged letters, advice on chemistry, and laboratory equipment.

On 23 June 1762, Priestley married Mary Wilkinson of [[Wrexham]]. Of his marriage, Priestley wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This proved a very suitable and happy connexion, my wife being a woman of an excellent understanding, much improved by reading, of great fortitude and strength of mind, and of a temper in the highest degree affectionate and generous; feeling strongly for others, and little for herself. Also, greatly excelling in every thing relating to household affairs, she entirely relieved me of all concern of that kind, which allowed me to give all my time to the prosecution of my studies, and the other duties of my station.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, ''Autobiography'', 87.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On 17 April 1763, they had a daughter, whom they named Sarah after Priestley's aunt.&lt;ref&gt;See Thorpe, 33–44 for a description of life at Warrington; Schofield (1997), 89–90, 93–94; Jackson, 54–58; Uglow, 73–75; Thorpe, 47–50; Holt, 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educator and historian===
{{further|Joseph Priestley and education}}

All of the books Priestley published while at Warrington emphasised the study of history; Priestley considered it essential for worldly success as well as religious growth. He wrote histories of science and Christianity in an effort to reveal the progress of humanity and, paradoxically, the loss of a pure, "primitive Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 135, 149; Holt, 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A New Chart of History.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A timeline, showing major civilisations|A redacted version of ''[[A New Chart of History]]'' (1765); Priestley believed this chart would "impress" upon students "a just image of the rise, progress, extent, duration, and contemporary state of all the considerable empires that have ever existed in the world"&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 146.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In his ''[[Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life]]'' (1765),&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life]]''. London: Printed for C. Henderson under the Royal Exchange; T. Becket and De Hondt in the Strand; and by J. Johnson and Davenport, in Pater-Noster-Row, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Lectures on History and General Policy]]'' (1788), and other works, Priestley argued that the education of the young should anticipate their future practical needs. This principle of utility guided his unconventional curricular choices for Warrington's aspiring middle-class students. He recommended modern languages instead of classical languages and modern rather than ancient history. Priestley's lectures on history were particularly revolutionary; he narrated a [[providentialism|providentialist]] and naturalist account of history, arguing that the study of history furthered the comprehension of God's natural laws. Furthermore, his [[millennialism|millennial]] perspective was closely tied to his optimism regarding scientific progress and the improvement of humanity. He believed that each age would improve upon the previous and that the study of history allowed people to perceive and to advance this progress. Since the study of history was a moral imperative for Priestley, he also promoted the education of middle-class women, which was unusual at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, 52–54; Schofield (1997), 124–25; Watts, 89, 95–97; Sheps, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars of education have described Priestley as the most important English writer on education between the 17th-century [[John Locke]] and the 19th-century [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 121; see also Watts, 92.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lectures on History'' was well received and was employed by many educational institutions, such as New College at Hackney,&lt;!-- Is this [[Homerton College, Cambridge]]? --&gt; [[Brown University|Brown]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Yale]], and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 254–59; McLachlan (1987–90), 255–58; Sheps, 138, 141; Kramnick, 12; Holt, 29–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley designed two ''Charts'' to serve as visual study aids for his  ''Lectures''.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[A Chart of Biography]]''. London: J. Johnson, St. Paul's Church Yard, 1765 and Joseph Priestley, ''A Description of a Chart of Biography''.

London: Printed for J. Johnson, 1770.&lt;/ref&gt; These charts are in fact timelines; they have been described as the most influential timelines published in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, 57–65 and ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Both were popular for decades, and the trustees of Warrington were so impressed with Priestley's lectures and charts that they arranged for the [[University of Edinburgh]] to grant him a [[Doctor of Laws|Doctor of Law]] degree in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 37; Schofield (1997), 118–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

====History of electricity====

Thank you. --&gt;

The intellectually stimulating atmosphere of Warrington, often called the "Athens of the North" (of England) during the 18th century, encouraged Priestley's growing interest in natural philosophy. He gave lectures on anatomy and performed experiments regarding temperature with another tutor at Warrington, his friend [[John Seddon of Warrington|John Seddon]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 136–37; Jackson, 57–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Priestley's busy teaching schedule, he decided to write a history of electricity. Friends introduced him to the major experimenters in the field in Britain—[[John Canton]], [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]], and the visiting [[Benjamin Franklin]]—who encouraged Priestley to perform the experiments he wanted to include in his history. In the process of replicating others' experiments, Priestley became intrigued by unanswered questions and was prompted to undertake experiments of his own design.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 141–42, 152; Jackson, 64; Uglow 75–77; Thorpe, 61–65.&lt;/ref&gt; (Impressed with his ''Charts'' and the manuscript of his history of electricity, Canton, Franklin, Watson, and [[Richard Price]] nominated Priestley for a fellowship in the [[Royal Society]]; he was accepted in 1766.)&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 143–44; Jackson, 65–66; see Schofield (1997), 152 and 231–32 for an analysis of the different editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1767, the 700-page ''[[The History and Present State of Electricity]]'' was published to positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[The History and Present State of Electricity]], with original experiments''. London: Printed for J. Dodsley, J. Johnson and T. Cadell, 1767.&lt;/ref&gt; The first half of the text is a history of the study of electricity to 1766; the second and more influential half is a description of contemporary theories about electricity and suggestions for future research. Priestley reported some of his own discoveries in the second section, such as the [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]] of [[charcoal]] and other substances and the continuum between conductors and non-conductors.&lt;ref name=S14456&gt;Schofield (1997), 144–56.&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery overturned what he described as "one of the earliest and universally received maxims of electricity", that only water and metals could conduct electricity. This and other experiments on the electrical properties of materials and on the electrical effects of chemical transformations demonstrated Priestley's early and ongoing interest in the relationship between chemical substances and electricity.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 156–57; Gibbs 28–31; see also Thorpe, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on experiments with charged spheres, Priestley was among the first to propose that electrical force followed an [[inverse-square law]], similar to [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Other early investigators who suspected that the electrical force diminished with distance as the gravitational force did (i.e., as the inverse square of the distance) included [[Daniel Bernoulli]] (see: Abel Socin (1760)  ''Acta Helvetia'', vol. 4, pp. 224–25.) and [[Alessandro Volta]], both of whom measured the force between plates of a capacitor, and [[Franz Aepinus|Aepinus]]. See: J.L. Heilbron, ''Electricity in the 17th and 18th Centuries: A Study of Early Modern Physics'' (Los Angeles, California: University of California Press, 1979), pp. 460–62,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=UlTLRUn1sy8C&amp;pg=PA464#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 464] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514033716/https://books.google.com/books?id=UlTLRUn1sy8C&amp;pg=PA464 |date=14 May 2016 }} (including footnote 44).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Priestley, ''The History and Present State of Electricity, with Original Experiments'' (London, England: 1767), [https://books.google.com/books?id=HZE_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA732#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 732] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528211919/https://books.google.com/books?id=HZE_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA732 |date=28 May 2016 }}:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;May we not infer from this experiment, that the attraction of electricity is subject to the same laws with that of gravitation, and is therefore according to the squares of the distances; since it is easily demonstrated, that were the earth in the form of a shell, a body in the inside of it would not be attracted to one side more than another?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not generalise or elaborate on this,&lt;ref name=S14456/&gt; and the [[Coulomb's law|general law]] was enunciated by French physicist [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] in the 1780s.

Priestley's strength as a natural philosopher was qualitative rather than quantitative and his observation of "a current of real air" between two electrified points would later interest [[Michael Faraday]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] as they investigated [[electromagnetism]]. Priestley's text became the standard history of electricity for over a century; [[Alessandro Volta]] (who later invented the battery), [[William Herschel]] (who discovered [[infrared radiation]]), and [[Henry Cavendish]] (who discovered [[hydrogen]]) all relied upon it. Priestley wrote a popular version of the ''History of Electricity'' for the general public titled ''A Familiar Introduction to the Study of Electricity'' (1768).&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''A Familiar Introduction to the Study of Electricity''. London: Printed for J. Dodsley; T. Cadell; and J. Johnson, 1768.&lt;/ref&gt; He marketed the book with his brother Timothy, but unsuccessfully.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 228–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--|alt=An illustration of a machine that generated electricity through a wheel and attached to the side of a table.--&gt;

==Leeds (1767–73)==
[[File:PriestleyLeeds.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Half-length portrait of a man holding a small book in his right hand. He is wearing a black jacket and a white shirt.|The earliest known portrait of Priestley, known as the "Leeds" portrait (c. 1763); except for his membership on the Leeds Library Committee, Priestley was not active in the town's social life&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 162–64.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Perhaps prompted by Mary Priestley's ill health, or financial problems, or a desire to prove himself to the community that had rejected him in his childhood, Priestley moved with his family from Warrington to [[Leeds]] in 1767, and he became [[Mill Hill Chapel]]'s minister. Two sons were born to the Priestleys in Leeds: Joseph junior on 24 July 1768 and [[William Priestley (Louisiana planter)|William]] three years later. [[Theophilus Lindsey]], a [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] at [[Catterick, North Yorkshire|Catterick, Yorkshire]], became one of Priestley's few friends in Leeds, of whom he wrote: "I never chose to publish any thing of moment relating to theology, without consulting him."&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, ''Autobiography'', 98; see also Schofield (1997), 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Priestley had extended family living around Leeds, it does not appear that they communicated. Schofield conjectures that they considered him a [[Heresy|heretic]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 162, note 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Each year Priestley travelled to London to consult with his close friend and publisher, [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]], and to attend meetings of the [[Royal Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, (1997), 158, 164; Gibbs, 37; Uglow, 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minister of Mill Hill Chapel===
{{further|Joseph Priestley and education|Joseph Priestley and Dissent}}

[[File:PriestleyInstitutes.png|thumb|upright|alt=Page reads: "Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion. In Two Volumes. Two which is prefixed, An Essay on the best Method of communicating religious Knowledge to the Members of Christian Societies. By Joseph Priestley, LL.D. F.R.S. The Second Edition. vol. I. Wisdom is the principal Thing. Solomon. Birmingham, Printed by Pearson and Rollason, for J. Johnson, No. 72, St. Paul's Church-Yard, London. M DCC LXXXIII."|Priestley had been working on ''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]'' since his Daventry days.]]

When Priestley became its minister, [[Mill Hill Chapel]] was one of the oldest and most respected [[English Dissenters|Dissenting congregations in England]]; however, during the early 18th century the congregation had fractured along doctrinal lines, and was losing members to the charismatic [[Methodism#Wesleyan revival|Methodist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 165–69; Holt, 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley believed that by educating the young, he could strengthen the bonds of the congregation.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 170–71; Gibbs, 37; Watts, 93–94; Holt, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his magisterial three-volume ''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]'' (1772–74),&lt;ref&gt;Priestley. ''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]''. London: Printed for J. Johnson, Vol. I, 1772, Vol. II, 1773, Vol. III, 1774.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley outlined his theories of religious instruction. More importantly, he laid out his belief in [[Socinianism]]. The doctrines he explicated would become the standards for [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] in Britain. This work marked a change in Priestley's theological thinking that is critical to understanding his later writings—it paved the way for his [[materialism]] and [[necessitarianism]] (the belief that a divine being acts in accordance with necessary metaphysical laws).&lt;ref&gt;Miller, xvi; Schofield (1997), 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley's major argument in the ''Institutes'' was that the only revealed religious truths that could be accepted were those that matched one's experience of the natural world. Because his views of religion were deeply tied to his understanding of nature, the text's [[theism]] rested on the [[argument from design]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 174; Uglow, 169; Tapper, 315; Holt, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Institutes'' shocked and appalled many readers, primarily because it challenged basic Christian orthodoxies, such as the [[Christ|divinity of Christ]] and the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|miracle of the Virgin Birth]]. Methodists in Leeds penned a hymn asking God to "the Unitarian fiend expel / And chase his doctrine back to Hell."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Jackson, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley wanted to return Christianity to its "primitive" or "pure" form by eliminating the "corruptions" which had accumulated over the centuries. The fourth part of the ''Institutes'', ''[[An History of the Corruptions of Christianity]]'', became so long that he was forced to issue it separately in 1782. Priestley believed that the ''Corruptions'' was "the most valuable" work he ever published. In demanding that his readers apply the logic of the emerging sciences and comparative history to the Bible and Christianity, he alienated religious and scientific readers alike—scientific readers did not appreciate seeing science used in the defence of religion and religious readers dismissed the application of science to religion.&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan (1987–90), 261; Gibbs, 38; Jackson, 102; Uglow, 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious controversialist===
Priestley engaged in numerous political and religious [[pamphlet]] wars. According to Schofield, "he entered each controversy with a cheerful conviction that he was right, while most of his opponents were convinced, from the outset, that he was willfully and maliciously wrong. He was able, then, to contrast his sweet reasonableness to their personal rancor",&lt;ref name=S181&gt;Schofield (1997), 181.&lt;/ref&gt; but as Schofield points out Priestley rarely altered his opinion as a result of these debates.&lt;ref name=S181/&gt; While at Leeds he wrote controversial pamphlets on the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]] and on [[Calvinist]] doctrine; thousands of copies were published, making them some of Priestley's most widely read works.&lt;ref&gt;See Schofield (1997), 181–88 for analysis of these two controversies.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley founded the ''[[Theological Repository]]'' in 1768, a journal committed to the open and rational inquiry of theological questions. Although he promised to print any contribution, only like-minded authors submitted articles. He was therefore obliged to provide much of the journal's content himself (this material became the basis for many of his later theological and metaphysical works). After only a few years, due to a lack of funds, he was forced to cease publishing the journal.&lt;ref&gt;See Schofield (1997), 193–201 for an analysis of the journal; Uglow, 169; Holt, 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt; He revived it in 1784 with similar results.&lt;ref&gt;See Schofield (2004), 202–7 for an analysis of Priestley's contributions.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defender of Dissenters and political philosopher===
{{further|Joseph Priestley and Dissent}}

[[File:PriestleyFirstPrinciples.jpg|thumb|His ''[[Essay on the First Principles of Government]]'' (1768) influenced early 19th-century political philosophers, including [[Jeremy Bentham]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 207.&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=Page reads: "An Essay on the First Principles of Government, and on the Nature of Political, Civil, and Religious Liberty, including Remarks on Dr. Brown's Code of Education, and on Br. Balguy's Sermon on Church Authority. The Second Edition, corrected and enlarged, by Joseph Priestley, LL.D. F.R.S. London: Printed for J. Dodsley, in Pall-Mall; T. Cadell, (successor to Mr. Millar) in the Strand; and J. Johnson, No. 72 in St. Paul's Church-Yard. MDCCLXXI."]]

Many of Priestley's political writings supported the repeal of the [[Test Act|Test]] and [[Corporation Act 1661|Corporation Acts]], which restricted the rights of Dissenters. They could not hold political office, serve in the armed forces, or attend Oxford and Cambridge unless they subscribed to the [[Thirty-nine Articles]] of the [[Church of England]]. Dissenters repeatedly petitioned Parliament to repeal the Acts, arguing that they were being treated as second-class citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 202–05; Holt, 56–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley's friends, particularly other Rational Dissenters, urged him to publish a work on the injustices experienced by Dissenters; the result was his ''[[Essay on the First Principles of Government]]'' (1768).&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Essay on the First Principles of Government]]; and on the nature of political, civil, and religious liberty''. London: Printed for J. Dodsley; T. Cadell; and J. Johnson, 1768.&lt;/ref&gt; An early work of [[Liberalism|modern liberal political theory]] and Priestley's most thorough treatment of the subject, it—unusually for the time—distinguished political rights from civil rights with precision and argued for expansive civil rights. Priestley identified separate private and public spheres, contending that the government should only have control over the public sphere. Education and religion, in particular, he maintained, were matters of private conscience and should not be administered by the state. Priestley's later radicalism emerged from his belief that the British government was infringing upon these individual freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 39–43; Uglow, 169; Garrett, 17; Tapper, 315; Holt, 34–37; Philip (1985); Miller, xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley also defended the rights of Dissenters against the attacks of [[William Blackstone]], an eminent legal theorist, whose ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (1765–69) had become the standard legal guide. Blackstone's book stated that dissent from the Church of England was a crime and that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects. Furious, Priestley lashed out with his ''Remarks on Dr. Blackstone's Commentaries'' (1769), correcting Blackstone's interpretation of the law, his grammar (a highly politicised subject at the time), and history.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''Remarks on some paragraphs in the fourth volume of Dr. Blackstone's Commentaries on the laws of England, relating to the Dissenters''. London: Printed for J. Johnson and J. Payne, 1769.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackstone, chastened, altered subsequent editions of his ''Commentaries'': he rephrased the offending passages and removed the sections claiming that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects, but he retained his description of Dissent as a crime.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 214–16; Gibbs, 43; Holt, 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural philosopher: electricity, ''Optics'', and soda water===
[[File:Joseph Priestley's book Optics.jpg|thumb|''Optics: The History and Present State of Vision, Light, and Colours'', published in 1772, London]]
Although Priestley claimed that [[natural philosophy]] was only a hobby, he took it seriously. In his ''History of Electricity'', he described the scientist as promoting the "security and happiness of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Kramnick, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley's science was eminently practical and he rarely concerned himself with theoretical questions; his model was [[Benjamin Franklin]]. When he moved to Leeds, Priestley continued his electrical and chemical experiments (the latter aided by a steady supply of carbon dioxide from a neighbouring brewery). Between 1767 and 1770, he presented five papers to the [[Royal Society]] from these initial experiments; the first four papers explored [[coronal discharge]]s and other phenomena related to [[electrical discharge]], while the fifth reported on the conductivity of charcoals from different sources. His subsequent experimental work focused on chemistry and [[pneumatics]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 227, 232–38; see also Gibbs, 47; Kramnick, 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley published the first volume of his projected history of experimental philosophy,&lt;!-- do not link to [[experimental philosophy]] – that page describes a separate modern discipline --&gt; ''The History and Present State of Discoveries Relating to Vision, Light and Colours'' (referred to as his ''Optics''), in 1772.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''Proposals for printing by subscription, The history and present state of discoveries relating to vision, light, and colours''. Leeds: n.p., 1771.&lt;/ref&gt; He paid careful attention to the history of optics and presented excellent explanations of early optics experiments, but his mathematical deficiencies caused him to dismiss several important contemporary theories. Furthermore, he did not include any of the practical sections that had made his ''History of Electricity'' so useful to practising natural philosophers. Unlike his ''History of Electricity'', it was not popular and had only one edition, although it was the only English book on the topic for 150 years. The hastily written text sold poorly; the cost of researching, writing, and publishing the ''Optics'' convinced Priestley to abandon his history of experimental philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 240–49; Gibbs, 50–55; Uglow, 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley was considered for the position of astronomer on [[James Cook]]'s [[James Cook#Second voyage (1772–75)|second voyage to the South Seas]], but was not chosen. Still, he contributed in a small way to the voyage: he provided the crew with a method for making [[carbonated water|soda water]], which he erroneously speculated might be a cure for [[scurvy]]. He then published a pamphlet with ''Directions for Impregnating Water with Fixed Air'' (1772).&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''Directions for impregnating water with fixed air; in order to communicate to it the peculiar spirit and virtues of Pyrmont water, and other mineral waters of a similar nature''. London: Printed for J. Johnson, 1772.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley did not exploit the commercial potential of soda water, but others such as {{nowrap|[[Johann Jacob Schweppe|J. J. Schweppe]]}} made fortunes from it.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 256–57; Gibbs, 57–59; Thorpe, 76–79; Uglow, 134–36; 232–34.&lt;/ref&gt; For his discovery of soda water Priestley has been labelled “the father of the [[soft drink]]”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schils|first1=René|title=How James Watt Invented the Copier: Forgotten Inventions of Our Great Scientists|date=2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the beverage company [[Schweppes]] regarding him as “the father of our industry”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=LaMoreaux|first1=Philip E.|title=Springs and Bottled Waters of the World: Ancient History, Source, Occurrence, Quality and Use|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1773, the Royal Society recognised Priestley's achievements in natural philosophy by awarding him the [[Copley Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 251–55; see Holt, 64; Gibbs, 55–56; and Thorpe, 80–81, for the traditional account of this story.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley's friends wanted to find him a more financially secure position. In 1772, prompted by [[Richard Price]] and Benjamin Franklin, [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] wrote to Priestley asking him to direct the education of his children and to act as his general assistant. Although Priestley was reluctant to sacrifice his ministry, he accepted the position, resigning from Mill Hill Chapel on 20 December 1772, and preaching his last sermon on 16 May 1773.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 270–71; Jackson, 120–22; Gibbs, 84–86: Uglow, 239–40; Holt, 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calne (1773–80)==

In 1773, the Priestleys moved to [[Calne]] in [[Wiltshire]], and a year later [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] and Priestley took a tour of Europe. According to Priestley's close friend [[Theophilus Lindsey]], Priestley was "much improved by this view of mankind at large".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Gibbs, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon their return, Priestley easily fulfilled his duties as librarian and tutor. The workload was intentionally light, allowing him time to pursue his scientific investigations and theological interests. Priestley also became a political adviser to Shelburne, gathering information on parliamentary issues and serving as a liaison between Shelburne and the Dissenting and American interests. When the Priestleys' third son was born on 24 May 1777, they named him Henry at the lord's request.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 4–11; 406; Gibbs, 91–94; Jackson, 122, 124, 143–52, 158–62; Thorpe, 80–85; Watts, 96; Holt, 70–94 (includes large quotations from Priestley's letters sent from Europe to Shelburne's sons).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materialist philosopher===
{{further|Joseph Priestley and Dissent}}

[[File:PriestleyMatterSpirit.png|thumb|upright|alt=Page reads: "Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit. To which is added, The History of the Philosophical Doctrine concerning the Origin of the Soul, and the Nature of Matter; with its Influence on Christianity, especially with Respect to the Doctrine of the Pre-existence of Christ."|By 1782, at least a dozen hostile refutations were published to ''[[Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit]]'', and Priestley was branded an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 72.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Priestley wrote his most important philosophical works during his years with Lord Shelburne. In a series of major [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] texts published between 1774 and 1780—''An Examination of Dr. Reid's Inquiry into the Human Mind'' (1774), ''Hartley's Theory of the Human Mind on the Principle of the Association of Ideas'' (1775), ''[[Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit]]'' (1777), ''[[The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated]]'' (1777), and ''[[Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever]]'' (1780)—he argues for a philosophy that incorporates four concepts: [[determinism]], [[materialism]], [[causality|causation]], and [[necessitarianism]]. By studying the natural world, he argued, people would learn how to become more compassionate, happy, and prosperous.&lt;ref&gt;McEvoy and McGuire, 326–27; Tapper, 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley strongly suggested that there is no [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind-body duality]], and put forth a materialist philosophy in these works; that is, one founded on the principle that everything in the universe is made of matter that we can perceive. He also contended that discussing the soul is impossible because it is made of a divine substance, and humanity cannot perceive the divine. Despite his separation of the divine from the mortal, this position shocked and angered many of his readers, who believed that such a duality was necessary for the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 59–76; Gibbs, 99–100; Holt, 112–24; McEvoy and McGuire, 333–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to [[Baron d'Holbach]]'s ''[[The System of Nature|Système de la Nature]]'' (1770) and [[David Hume]]'s ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779) as well as the works of the French ''philosophers'', Priestley maintained that materialism and determinism could be reconciled with a belief in God. He criticised those whose faith was shaped by books and fashion, drawing an analogy between the scepticism of educated men and the credulity of the masses.&lt;ref&gt;Tapper, 320; Priestley, ''Autobiography'', 111; Schofield (2004), 37–42; Holt, 93–94; 139–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintaining that humans had no [[free will]], Priestley argued that what he called "philosophical necessity" (akin to [[determinism|absolute determinism]]) is consonant with Christianity, a position based on his understanding of the natural world. Like the rest of nature, man's mind is subject to the laws of causation, Priestley contended, but because a benevolent God created these laws, the world and the people in it will eventually be perfected. Evil is therefore only an imperfect understanding of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 77–91; Garrett, 55; Tapper, 319; Sheps, 138; McEvoy (1983), 50; McEvoy and McGuire, 338–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Priestley's philosophical work has been characterised as "audacious and original",&lt;ref name=Tap314/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; it partakes of older philosophical traditions on the problems of [[free will]], [[determinism]], and [[materialism]].&lt;ref name="MM341"&gt;McEvoy and McGuire, 341–45.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 17th-century philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] argued for absolute determinism and absolute materialism.&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm.

===Founder of Unitarianism===
{{See also|History of Unitarianism}}
When Priestley's friend [[Theophilus Lindsey]] decided to found a new Christian denomination that would not restrict its members' beliefs, Priestley and others hurried to his aid. On 17 April 1774, Lindsey held the first [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] service in Britain, at the newly formed [[Essex Street Chapel]] in London; he had even designed his own liturgy, of which many were critical. Priestley defended his friend in the pamphlet ''Letter to a Layman, on the Subject of the Rev. Mr. Lindsey's Proposal for a Reformed English Church'' (1774),&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''Letter to a Layman, on the Subject of the Rev. Mr. Lindsey's Proposal for a Reformed English Church''. London: Printed for J. Wilkie, 1774.&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that only the form of worship had been altered, not its substance, and attacking those who followed religion as a fashion. Priestley attended Lindsey's church regularly in the 1770s and occasionally preached there.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 26–28; Jackson, 124; Gibbs, 88–89; Holt, 56–64.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to support institutionalised Unitarianism for the rest of his life, writing several ''Defenses'' of Unitarianism and encouraging the foundation of new Unitarian chapels throughout Britain and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 225, 236–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air===
{{see also|Wikisource:An Inventory of the Furniture in Dr. Priestley's Study}}

[[File:Priestley Joseph pneumatic trough.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Equipment used by Priestley in his experiments on gases, 1775|alt=Engraving of assorted scientific equipment, such as a pneumatic trough. A dead mouse rests under one glass canister.]]

Priestley's years in Calne were the only ones in his life dominated by scientific investigations; they were also the most scientifically fruitful. His experiments were almost entirely confined to "airs", and out of this work emerged his most important scientific texts: the six volumes of ''[[Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air]]'' (1774–86).&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air]]''. 3 vols. London W. Bowyer and J. Nichols, 1774–77. There are several different editions of these volumes, each important.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Gibbs 67–83 for a description of all of Priestley's experiments during this time; Thorpe, 170ff.&lt;/ref&gt; These experiments helped repudiate the last vestiges of the [[Classical element|theory of four elements]], which Priestley attempted to replace with his own variation of [[phlogiston theory]]. According to that 18th-century theory, the combustion or [[redox|oxidation]] of a substance corresponded to the release of a material substance, ''phlogiston''.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, 167–68; Schofield (2004), 98–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley's work on "airs" is not easily classified. As historian of science [[Simon Schaffer]] writes, it "has been seen as a branch of physics, or chemistry, or natural philosophy, or some highly idiosyncratic version of Priestley's own invention".&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the volumes were both a scientific and a political enterprise for Priestley, in which he argues that science could destroy "undue and usurped authority" and that government has "reason to tremble even at an air pump or an electrical machine".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Kramnick, 11–12; see also Schofield (2004), 121–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume I of ''Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air'' outlined several discoveries: "nitrous air" ([[nitric oxide]], NO); "vapor of spirit of salt", later called "acid air" or "marine acid air" ([[anhydrous hydrochloric acid]], HCl); "alkaline air" ([[ammonia]], NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;); "diminished" or "dephlogisticated nitrous air" ([[nitrous oxide]], N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O); and, most famously, "dephlogisticated air" ([[oxygen]], O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as well as experimental findings that showed plants revitalised enclosed volumes of air, a discovery that would eventually lead to the discovery of [[photosynthesis]]. Priestley also developed a "nitrous air test" to determine the "goodness of air". Using a [[pneumatic trough]], he would mix nitrous air with a test sample, over water or mercury, and measure the decrease in volume—the principle of [[eudiometer|eudiometry]].&lt;ref name="Fruton"&gt;Fruton, 20, 29&lt;/ref&gt; After a small history of the study of airs, he explained his own experiments in an open and sincere style. As an early biographer writes, "whatever he knows or thinks he tells: doubts, perplexities, blunders are set down with the most refreshing candour."&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 98; Thorpe, 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley also described his cheap and easy-to-assemble experimental apparatus; his colleagues therefore believed that they could easily reproduce his experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 259–69; Jackson, 110–14; Thorpe, 76–77, 178–79; Uglow, 229–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with inconsistent experimental results, Priestley employed phlogiston theory. This, however, led him to conclude that there were only three types of "air": "fixed", "alkaline", and "acid". Priestley dismissed the [[History of chemistry#17th and 18th centuries: Early chemistry|burgeoning chemistry]] of his day. Instead, he focused on gases and "changes in their sensible properties", as had natural philosophers before him. He isolated [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), but apparently did not realise that it was a separate "air".&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 93–105; Uglow, 240–41; see Gibbs 105–16 for a description of these experiments.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Discovery of oxygen====
{{see also|Wikisource:The Mouse's Petition}}

[[File:Bowood House laboratory.jpg|thumb|left|The laboratory at Lord Shelburne's estate, [[Bowood House]], in which Priestley discovered oxygen|alt=Photograph of a laboratory, with glass-encased, wooden bookcases on two walls and a window on the third. There is a display case in the middle of the room.]]

In August 1774 he isolated an "air" that appeared to be completely new, but he did not have an opportunity to pursue the matter because he was about to tour Europe with Shelburne. While in Paris, however, Priestley managed to replicate the experiment for others, including French chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]]. After returning to Britain in January 1775, he continued his experiments and discovered "vitriolic acid air" ([[sulphur dioxide]], SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

In March he wrote to several people regarding the new "air" that he had discovered in August. One of these letters was read aloud to the [[Royal Society]], and a paper outlining the discovery, titled "An Account of further Discoveries in Air", was published in the Society's journal ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. "[https://www.jstor.org/pss/106209 An Account of Further Discoveries in Air]". ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'' 65 (1775): 384–94.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley called the new substance "dephlogisticated air", which he made in the famous experiment by [[burning glass|focusing the sun’s rays]] on a sample of [[mercuric oxide]]. He first tested it on mice, who surprised him by surviving quite a while entrapped with the air, and then on himself, writing that it was "five or six times better than common air for the purpose of respiration, inflammation, and, I believe, every other use of common atmospherical air".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Schofield (2004), 107.&lt;/ref&gt; He had discovered [[oxygen]] gas (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

[[File:Shelburne.jpg|thumb|[[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne]] – a fellow Unitarian – built a laboratory for the famous dissenter at [[Bowood House]].|alt=Half-length portrait of a man wearing furred robes and a white wig and looking regal. Underneath his white robes, he is wearing red and gold and he is sitting in a red chair.]]

Priestley assembled his oxygen paper and several others into a second volume of ''Experiments and Observations on Air'', published in 1776. He did not emphasise his discovery of "dephlogisticated air" (leaving it to Part III of the volume) but instead argued in the preface how important such discoveries were to rational religion. His paper narrated the discovery chronologically, relating the long delays between experiments and his initial puzzlements; thus, it is difficult to determine when exactly Priestley "discovered" oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 105–19; see also Jackson, 126–27, 163–64, 166–74; Gibbs, 118–23; Uglow, 229–31, 241; Holt, 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Such dating is significant as both Lavoisier and Swedish pharmacist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] have strong claims to the discovery of oxygen as well, Scheele having been the first to isolate the gas (although he published after Priestley) and Lavoisier having been the first to describe it as purified "air itself entire without alteration" (that is, the first to explain oxygen without phlogiston theory).&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his paper "Observations on Respiration and the Use of the Blood", Priestley was the first to suggest a connection between blood and air, although he did so using [[phlogiston theory]]. In typical Priestley fashion, he prefaced the paper with a history of the study of respiration. A year later, clearly influenced by Priestley, Lavoisier was also discussing respiration at the [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie des sciences]]. Lavoisier's work began the long train of discovery that produced papers on oxygen respiration and culminated in the overthrow of phlogiston theory and the establishment of modern chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 129–30; Gibbs, 124–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1779 Priestley and Shelburne had a rupture, the precise reasons for which remain unclear. Shelburne blamed Priestley's health, while Priestley claimed Shelburne had no further use for him. Some contemporaries speculated that Priestley's outspokenness had hurt Shelburne's political career. Schofield argues that the most likely reason was Shelburne's recent marriage to Louisa Fitzpatrick—apparently, she did not like the Priestleys. Although Priestley considered moving to America, he eventually accepted [[Birmingham]] New Meeting's offer to be their minister.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 141–43; see also Jackson, 198–99; Holt, 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Priestley and Shelburne's families upheld their Unitarian faith  for generations.
In December 2013, it was reported that [[Sir Christopher Bullock]] – a direct descendant of Shelburne's brother, [[Thomas Fitzmaurice (MP)]] – had married his wife, [[Lupton family|Lady Bullock]], née Barbara May Lupton, at London's Unitarian [[Essex Street Chapel|Essex Church]] in 1917. Barbara Lupton was the second cousin of [[Family of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Olive Middleton]], née Lupton, the great grandmother of [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]]. In 1914, Olive and Noel Middleton had married at Leeds' [[Mill Hill Chapel]], which Priestly, as its minister, had once guided towards Unitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nikkah|first1=Roya|title=The Duchess discovers blue blood in her own family|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/kate-middleton/9747412/Duchess-of-Cambridge-discovers-blue-blood-in-her-own-family.html|website=UK Sunday Telegraph|date=16 December 2012|page=9|accessdate=8 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029061649/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/kate-middleton/9747412/Duchess-of-Cambridge-discovers-blue-blood-in-her-own-family.html|archivedate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birmingham (1780–91)==
In 1780 the Priestleys moved to [[Birmingham]] and spent a happy decade surrounded by old friends, until they were forced to flee in 1791 by religiously motivated mob violence in what became known as the [[Priestley Riots]]. Priestley accepted the ministerial position at New Meeting on the condition that he be required to preach and teach only on Sundays, so that he would have time for his writing and scientific experiments. As in Leeds, Priestley established classes for the youth of his parish and by 1781, he was teaching 150 students. Because Priestley's New Meeting salary was only 100 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]], friends and patrons donated money and goods to help continue his investigations.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 147–50, 196–99, 242–46. Gibbs, 134–40, 169; Uglow, 310–20, 407; Jackson, 227–28; Holt, 132–33.&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1782.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter P|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterP.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515183157/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterP.pdf|archivedate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical Revolution===
{{See also|Chemical Revolution}}

[[File:Lunar Society Moonstones 22 Priestley.jpg|thumb|upright|One of a set of [[Lunar Society Moonstones]] commemorating Priestley at [[Great Barr]], Birmingham]]

Many of the friends that Priestley made in Birmingham were members of the [[Lunar Society]], a group of manufacturers, inventors, and natural philosophers who assembled monthly to discuss their work. The core of the group included men such as the manufacturer [[Matthew Boulton]], the chemist and geologist [[James Keir]], the inventor and engineer [[James Watt]], and the botanist, chemist, and geologist [[William Withering]]. Priestley was asked to join this unique society and contributed much to the work of its members.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 151–52; for an analysis of Priestley's contributions to each man's work, see Schofield's chapter "Science and the Lunar Society"; see also Jackson, 200–01; Gibbs, 141–47; Thorpe, 93–102; Holt, 127–32; Uglow, 349–50; for a history of the Lunar Society, see Uglow.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this stimulating intellectual environment, he published several important scientific papers, including "Experiments relating to Phlogiston, and the seeming Conversion of Water into Air" (1783). The first part attempts to refute Lavoisier's challenges to his work on oxygen; the second part describes how steam is "converted" into air. After several variations of the experiment, with different substances as fuel and several different collecting apparatuses (which produced different results), he concluded that air could travel through more substances than previously surmised, a conclusion "contrary to all the known principles of hydrostatics".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Schofield (2004), 167&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery, along with his earlier work on what would later be recognised as gaseous diffusion&lt;!-- [[gaseous diffusion]] page seems like an incorrect link --&gt;, would eventually lead [[John Dalton]] and [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]] to formulate the [[kinetic theory of gases]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 168; see also Jackson 203–08; Gibbs, 154–61; Uglow, 358–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1777, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] had written ''Mémoire sur la combustion en général'', the first of what proved to be a series of attacks on [[phlogiston theory]];&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris'' année 1777 (1780): 592–600. The next, most notable installment was "Réflexions sur le phlogistique, pour servir de suite à la théorie de la combustion et de la calcination publiée en 1777" ''Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris'' année 1783 (1786): 505–538 (translated by Nicholas W. Best as "[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10698-015-9220-5 Lavoisier's 'Reflections on Phlogiston' I: Against Phlogiston Theory"], ''[[Foundations of Chemistry]]'' 17 (2015): 137–151).&lt;/ref&gt; it was against these attacks that Priestley responded in 1783. While Priestley accepted parts of Lavoisier's theory, he was unprepared to assent to the major revolutions Lavoisier proposed: the overthrow of phlogiston, a chemistry based conceptually on [[Chemical element|elements]] and [[Chemical compound|compounds]], and a new [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry nomenclature|chemical nomenclature]]. Priestley's original experiments on "dephlogisticated air" (oxygen), combustion, and water provided Lavoisier with the data he needed to construct much of his system; yet Priestley never accepted Lavoisier's new theories and continued to defend phlogiston theory for the rest of his life. Lavoisier's system was based largely on the ''quantitative'' concept that [[mass]] is neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions (i.e., the [[law of conservation of mass|conservation of mass]]). By contrast, Priestley preferred to observe ''qualitative'' changes in heat, color, and particularly volume. His experiments tested "airs" for "their solubility in water, their power of supporting or extinguishing flame, whether they were respirable, how they behaved with acid and alkaline air, and with nitric oxide and inflammable air, and lastly how they were affected by the [[electric spark]]."&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, 210; see also Schofield (2004), 169–94; Jackson 216–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1789, when Lavoisier published his ''[[Traité Élémentaire de Chimie]]'' and founded the ''[[Annales de Chimie]]'', the new chemistry had come into its own. Priestley published several more scientific papers in Birmingham, the majority attempting to refute Lavoisier. Priestley and other Lunar Society members argued that the new French system was too expensive, too difficult to test, and unnecessarily complex. Priestley in particular rejected its "establishment" aura. In the end, Lavoisier's view prevailed: his new chemistry introduced many of the principles on which [[chemistry|modern chemistry]] is founded.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, 164; Uglow, 356; McEvoy (1983), 56–57; Donovan, 175–76, 180–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley's refusal to accept Lavoisier's "new chemistry"—such as the [[law of conservation of mass|conservation of mass]]—and his determination to adhere to a less satisfactory theory has perplexed many scholars.&lt;ref&gt;See Schaffer, 162–70 for a historiographical analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; Schofield explains it thus: "Priestley was never a chemist; in a modern, and even a Lavoisierian, sense, he was never a scientist. He was a natural philosopher, concerned with the economy of nature and obsessed with an idea of unity, in theology and in nature."&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian of science John McEvoy largely agrees, writing that Priestley's view of nature as coextensive with God and thus infinite, which encouraged him to focus on facts over hypotheses and theories, prompted him to reject Lavoisier's system.&lt;ref&gt;McEvoy (1983), 51ff.&lt;/ref&gt; McEvoy argues that "Priestley's isolated and lonely opposition to the oxygen theory was a measure of his passionate concern for the principles of intellectual freedom, epistemic equality and critical inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;McEvoy (1983), 57; see also McEvoy and MeGuire 395ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley himself claimed in the last volume of ''Experiments and Observations'' that his most valuable works were his theological ones because they were "superior [in] dignity and importance".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Thorpe, 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Priestley was busy defending phlogiston theory from the "new chemists", most of what he published in Birmingham was theological. In 1782 he published the fourth volume of his ''Institutes'', ''[[An History of the Corruptions of Christianity]]'', describing how he thought the teachings of the early Christian church had been "corrupted" or distorted.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[[An History of the Corruptions of Christianity]]''. 2 vols. Birmingham: Printed by Piercy and Jones; London: Printed for J. Johnson, 1782.&lt;/ref&gt; Schofield describes the work as "derivative, disorganized, wordy, and repetitive, detailed, exhaustive, and devastatingly argued".&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 216.&lt;/ref&gt; The text addresses issues ranging from the divinity of Christ to the proper form for the Lord's Supper. Priestley followed up in 1786 with the provocatively titled book, ''An History of Early Opinions concerning Jesus Christ, compiled from Original Writers, proving that the Christian Church was at first Unitarian''. [[Thomas Jefferson]] would later write of the profound effect that these two books had on him: "I have read his Corruptions of Christianity, and Early Opinions of Jesus, over and over again; and I rest on them&amp;nbsp;... as the basis of my own faith. These writings have never been answered."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Gibbs, 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a few readers such as Jefferson and other Rational Dissenters approved of the work, it was harshly reviewed because of its extreme theological positions, particularly its rejection of the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 216–23; Thorpe, 106–08; Holt, 133–39; Philip (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1785, while Priestley was engaged in a pamphlet war over ''Corruptions'', he also published ''The Importance and Extent of Free Enquiry'', claiming that the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] had not really reformed the church.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''The importance and extent of free inquiry in matters of religion: a sermon, preached before the congregations of the Old and New Meeting of Protestant Dissenters at Birmingham. 5 November 1785. To which are added, reflections on the present state of free inquiry in this country''. Birmingham: Printed by M. Swinney; for J. Johnson, London, 1785.&lt;/ref&gt; In words that would boil over into a national debate, he challenged his readers to enact change:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let us not, therefore, be discouraged, though, for the present, we should see no great number of churches professedly unitarian&amp;nbsp;.... We are, as it were, laying gunpowder, grain by grain, under the old building of error and superstition, which a single spark may hereafter inflame, so as to produce an instantaneous explosion; in consequence of which that edifice, the erection of which has been the work of ages, may be overturned in a moment, and so effectually as that the same foundation can never be built upon again&amp;nbsp;....&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Gibbs, 173.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Although discouraged by friends from using such inflammatory language, Priestley refused to back down from his opinions in print and he included it, forever branding himself as "Gunpowder Joe". After the publication of this seeming call for revolution in the midst of the [[French Revolution]], pamphleteers stepped up their attacks on Priestley and he and his church were even threatened with legal action.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 169–76; Uglow, 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Word of Comfort2.jpg|left|thumb|"A Word of Comfort" by [[William Dent (cartoonist)|William Dent]] (dated 22 March 1790). Priestley is preaching in front of [[Charles James Fox]] who asks "Pray, Doctor, is there such a thing as a Devil?", to which Priestley responds "No" while the devil prepares to attack Priestley from behind.|alt=Caricature of a man preaching out of a barrel labelled "Fanaticism", stacked up on books labelled "Priestley's works" to a crowd, while the devil sneaks up on him.]]
In 1787, 1789, and 1790, Dissenters again tried to repeal the [[Test Act|Test]] and [[Corporation Act 1661|Corporation Acts]]. Although initially it looked as if they might succeed, by 1790, with the fears of revolution looming in Parliament, few were swayed by appeals to equal rights. Political cartoons, one of the most effective and popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 176–83.&lt;/ref&gt; In Parliament, [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]] and [[Edmund Burke]] argued against the repeal, a betrayal that angered Priestley and his friends, who had expected the two men's support. Priestley wrote a series of ''Letters to William Pitt''&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''A letter to the Right Honourable William Pitt,&amp;nbsp;... on the subjects of toleration and church establishments; occasioned by his speech against the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, on Wednesday 28 March 1787''. London: Printed for J. Johnson and J. Debrett, 1787.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Letters to Burke''&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''Letters to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke, occasioned by his Reflections on the Revolution in France, &amp;c.'' Birmingham: Printed by Thomas Pearson; sold by J. Johnson, London, 1791.&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but these publications only further inflamed the populace against him.

Dissenters such as Priestley who supported the French Revolution came under increasing suspicion as scepticism regarding the revolution grew.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 269–81; Thorpe, 122–25; Uglow, 409, 435–38; Holt, 142ff; Philip (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; In its propaganda against "radicals", Pitt's administration used the "gunpowder" statement to argue that Priestley and other Dissenters wanted to overthrow the government. Burke, in his famous ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), tied natural philosophers, and specifically Priestley, to the French Revolution, writing that radicals who supported science in Britain "considered man in their experiments no more than they do mice in an air pump".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Crossland, 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke also associated [[republicanism|republican]] principles with alchemy and insubstantial air, mocking the scientific work done by both Priestley and French chemists. He made much in his later writings of the connections between "Gunpowder Joe", science, and Lavoisier—who was improving gunpowder for the French in their [[French Revolutionary Wars|war against Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Crossland, 283–87, 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Paradoxically, a secular statesman, Burke, argued against science and maintained that religion should be the basis of civil society, whereas a Dissenting minister, Priestley, argued that religion could not provide the basis for civil society and should be restricted to one's private life.&lt;ref&gt;Kramnick, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birmingham riots of 1791===
{{main|Priestley Riots}}
[[File:Priestley Riots painting.jpg|thumb|The attack on Priestley's home, Fairhill, [[Sparkbrook]], Birmingham|alt=Burning three-story house, surrounded by a mob. People are throwing things out of the windows and belongings are scattered on the street.]]

The animus that had been building against Dissenters and supporters of the American and French Revolutions exploded in July 1791. Priestley and several other Dissenters had arranged to have a celebratory dinner on the anniversary of the [[storming of the Bastille]], a provocative action in a country where many disapproved of the French Revolution and feared that it might spread to Britain. Amid fears of violence, Priestley was convinced by his friends not to attend. Rioters gathered outside the hotel during the banquet and attacked the attendees as they left. The rioters moved on to the New Meeting and Old Meeting churches—and burned both to the ground. Priestley and his wife fled from their home; although their son [[William Priestley (Louisiana planter)|William]] and others stayed behind to protect their property, the mob overcame them and torched Priestley's house "Fairhill" at [[Sparkbrook]], destroying his valuable laboratory and all of the family's belongings. Twenty-six other Dissenters’ homes and three more churches were burned in the three-day riot.&lt;ref name=Dionisio&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dionisio|first1=Jennifer|title=Birmingham Toast|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|date=Summer 2010|volume=28|issue=2|page=18|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/birmingham-toast|archivedate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley spent several days hiding with friends until he was able to travel safely to London. The carefully executed attacks of the "mob" and the farcical trials of only a handful of the "leaders" convinced many at the time—and modern historians later—that the attacks were planned and condoned by local Birmingham [[Magistrate#United Kingdom|magistrates]]. When [[George III]] was eventually forced to send troops to the area, he said: "I cannot but feel better pleased that Priestley is the sufferer for the doctrines he and his party have instilled, and that the people see them in their true light."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Gibbs, 204; Schofield (2004), 264, 285, 289; Thorpe, 122–44; Uglow, 440–46; Jackson, 248–60; Rose, 68–88; Holt, 154ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unable to return to Birmingham, the Priestleys eventually settled in [[Lower Clapton]], a district in [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]], [[Middlesex]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ep-joseph-priestley.htm Joseph Priestley at hackney.gov.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303205157/http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ep-joseph-priestley.htm |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he gave a series of lectures on history and natural philosophy at the [[Dissenting academies|Dissenting academy]], the [[New College at Hackney]]. Friends helped the couple rebuild their lives, contributing money, books, and laboratory equipment. Priestley tried to obtain restitution from the government for the destruction of his Birmingham property, but he was never fully reimbursed.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, 160; Schofield (2004), 298–99; Thorpe, 145–46; Uglow, 446–49; Jackson, 300–05.&lt;/ref&gt; He also published ''An Appeal to the Public on the Subject of the Riots in Birmingham'' (1791),&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''An Appeal to the Public on the Subject of the Riots in Birmingham. To which are added, strictures on a pamphlet, entitled ’Thoughts on the late riot at Birmingham.’'' Birmingham: Printed by J. Thompson; sold by J. Johnson, London, 1791.&lt;/ref&gt; which indicted the people of Birmingham for allowing the riots to occur and for "violating the principles of English government".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Schofield (2004), 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple's friends urged them to leave Britain and emigrate to either France or the new United States, even though Priestley had received an appointment to preach for the [[Gravel Pit Meeting]] congregation.&lt;ref&gt;A [[blue plaque]] marks the site of the Gravel Pit Meeting at Ram Place and a brown plaque the site of the Priestleys' house at 113, Lower Clapton Road: [http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ep-joseph-priestley.htm Joseph Priestley at hackney.gov.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303205157/http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ep-joseph-priestley.htm |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley was minister between 1793 and 1794 and the sermons he preached there, particularly the two [[Fasting|Fast]] Sermons, reflect his growing [[millennialism|millenarianism]], his belief that the end of the world was fast approaching. After comparing Biblical prophecies to recent history, Priestley concluded that the [[French Revolution]] was a harbinger of the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Christ]]. Priestley's works had always had a millennial cast, but after the beginning of the French Revolution, this strain increased.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, 53, 57, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote to a younger friend that while he himself would not see the Second Coming, his friend "may probably live to see it&amp;nbsp;... It cannot, I think be more than twenty years [away]."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Garrett, 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daily life became more difficult for the family: Priestley was burned in effigy along with [[Thomas Paine]]; vicious political cartoons continued to be published about him; letters were sent to him from across the country, comparing him to the devil and [[Guy Fawkes]]; tradespeople feared the family's business; and Priestley's Royal Academy friends distanced themselves. As the penalties became harsher for those who spoke out against the government, Priestley examined options for removing himself and his family from England.

Joseph Priestley's son William was presented to the French Assembly and granted letters of naturalization on 8 June 1792.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley learned about it from the ''Morning Chronicle''.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs (1965), p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; A decree of 26 August 1792 by the French National Assembly conferred French citizenship on Joseph Priestley and others who had "served the cause of liberty" by their writings.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs (1965), p. 216; Schofield (2004), p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley accepted French citizenship, considering it "the greatest of honours".&lt;ref&gt;Graham (1995), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[French National Convention election, 1792|French National Convention election]] on 5 September 1792, Joseph Priestley was elected to the French [[National Convention]] by at least two departments, ([[Orne]] and [[Rhône-et-Loire]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs (1965), p. 216; Schofield,(2004), p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he declined the honour, on the grounds that he was not fluent in French.&lt;ref name=Schwartz&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Schwartz|editor-first1=A.

As relations between England and France worsened, however, a removal to France became impracticable.&lt;ref&gt;Graham (1995), p. 27; Schofield (2004), p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the declaration of war of February 1793, and the Aliens Bill of March 1793, which forbade correspondence or travel between England and France, William Priestley left France for America.

The Priestleys arrived in New York City on 4 June 1794, where they were [[wikt:fête|fêted]] by various political factions vying for Priestley's endorsement. Priestley declined their entreaties, hoping to avoid political discord in his new country. Before travelling to a new home in the backwoods of [[Northumberland County, Pennsylvania]], at Point township (now the [[Northumberland, Pennsylvania|Borough of Northumberland]]), Dr and Mrs Priestley lodged in [[Philadelphia]], where Priestley gave a series of sermons which led to the founding of the [[First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia]]. Priestley turned down an opportunity to teach chemistry at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 324–32; Thorpe, 155–57; Jackson, 310–14; Holt, 179ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley's son Joseph Priestley Jr. was a leading member of a consortium that had purchased 300,000 acres of virgin woodland between the forks of [[Loyalsock Creek]], which they intended to lease or sell in 400-acre plots, with payment deferred to seven annual instalments, with interest.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Cathryne Park, ''Joseph Priestley and the problem of Pantisocrasy'' (Philadelphia, 1947), 14–24, 52–57.

Mary Priestley's health, already poor, deteriorated further; although [[William Priestley (Louisiana planter)|William's]] wife, Margaret Foulke-Priestley, moved in with the couple to nurse Mary twenty-four hours a day,&lt;ref&gt;Tony Rail, ''op. cit.'' 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Priestley died 17 September 1796.&lt;ref&gt;Rutt, I(ii), 354.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Priestley now moved in with his elder son, Joseph Jr., and his wife Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley. [[Thomas Cooper (U.S. politician)|Thomas Cooper]], whose son, Thomas Jr., was living with the Priestleys, was a frequent visitor.

Since his arrival in America, Priestley had continued to defend his [[Unitarianism|Christian Unitarian]] beliefs; now, falling increasingly under the influence of Thomas Cooper and Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley, he was unable to avoid becoming embroiled in political controversy. In 1798, when, in response to the [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney|Pinckney affair]], a belligerent [[John Adams|President Adams]] sought to enlarge the navy and mobilise the militia into what Priestley and Cooper saw as a 'standing army', Priestley published an anonymous newspaper article: ''Maxims of political arithmetic'', which attacked Adams, defended free trade, and advocated a form of Jeffersonian isolationism.&lt;ref&gt;Signed ‘A Quaker in politics,’ the ''Maxims'' were printed over two days in the ''Aurora General Advertiser'', 26 &amp; 27 February 1798, and reprinted in both the ''Aurora''and ''Carey's United States' Recorder'', 31 March &amp; 1 April 1799. See Rutt, XXV, 175-82.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, a small package, addressed vaguely: "Dr Priestley in America," was seized by the [[Royal Navy]] on board a neutral Danish boat. It was found to contain three letters, one of which was signed by the radical printer [[John Hurford Stone]]. These intercepted letters were published in London, and copied in numerous papers in America.&lt;ref&gt;''Copies of original letters recently written by persons in Paris to Dr. Priestley in America, taken on board of a neutral vessel'' (London, 1798). ''Federal Gazette'' (Baltimore, MD), 27 August 1798.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the letters was addressed to "MBP", with a note: "I inclose a note for our friend MBP—but, as ignorant of the name he bears at present among you, I must beg you to seal and address it." This gave the intercepted letters a tinge of intrigue. Fearful lest they be taken as evidence of him being a 'spy in the interest of France', Priestley sent a clumsy letter to numerous newspaper editors, in which he naively named "MBP" (Member of the British Parliament) as [[Benjamin Vaughan|Mr. Benjamin Vaughan]], who "like me, thought it necessary to leave England, and for some time is said to have assumed a feigned name."&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan had fled to France in May 1794, when [[John Hurford Stone]]'s brother, William, was arrested and found to have a letter from Vaughan. In France, to avoid arrest as an Englishmen, he assumed the name of Jean Martin, and lived quietly at Passy. ([[John Goldworth Alger|John G. Alger]], ''Englishmen in the French Revolution'' (London, 1889), 93).&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Cobbett]], in his ''Porcupine's Gazette'', 20 August 1798, added that Priestley "has told us who Mr MBP is, and has confirmed me in the opinion of their both being spies in the interest of France."&lt;ref&gt;Tony Rail, ''op. cit.''; Schofield (2004), 329–38; Gibbs, 234–37; Jackson, 317–18; Garrett, 63; Holt, 199–204.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Priestley Jr. left on a visit to England at Christmas 1798, not returning until August 1800. In his absence, his wife Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley and Thomas Cooper became increasing close, collaborating in numerous political essays.&lt;ref&gt;In December 1799, two of Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley's essays, ''On the propriety and expediency of unlimited enquiry'', and ''A Reply to'' [Thomas Cooper's] ''Observations on the Fast Day'' [Cooper had challenged the power of a President to declare a day of fasting and prayer], were published as part of ''Political essays'' (Northumberland, PA, 1799). [Eugene Volokh: "Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley, Early American author on free speech"; ''New York University Journal of Law &amp; Liberty'', 4(2) (2009), 382–5].&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley allowed himself to fall too heavily under Elizabeth and Cooper's influences, even helping hawk a seditious handbill Cooper had printed, around [[Northumberland, Pennsylvania|Point township]], and across the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] at [[Sunbury, Pennsylvania|Sunbury]]. In September 1799, [[William Cobbett]] printed extracts from this handbill, asserting that: "Dr Priestley has taken great pains to circulate this address, has travelled through the country for the purpose, and is in fact the patron of it." He challenged Priestley to "clear himself of the accusation" or face prosecution."&lt;ref&gt;Tony Rail, ''op. cit.'' 166–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Barely a month later, in November and December 1799, Priestley stepped forward in his own defence, with his ''Letters to the inhabitants of Northumberland''.&lt;ref&gt;Published in two parts, Northumberland-town PA, 1799; printed by Andrew Kennedy who printed the ''Sunbury and Northumberland Gazette''. A pirate edition seems to have been published at Albany NY for Samuel Campbell of New York.

[[File:Priestley Graves VIII.jpg|thumb|right|Priestley's original 1804 gravestone in Riverview Cemetery, Northumberland, Pennsylvania. Visible at right is part of the new stone, placed in front of it in 1971.]]
Priestley’s son, [[William Priestley (Louisiana planter)|William]], now living in Philadelphia, was increasingly embarrassed by his father's actions. He confronted his father, expressing [[John Vaughan (wine merchant)|John]] and [[Benjamin Vaughan]]’s unease, his own wife's concerns about Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley's dietary care,&lt;ref&gt;Dr Priestley suffered a bilious and bowel condition throughout his adult life, with episodes of severe diarrhoea, for which Margaret Foulke-Priestley seems to have suggested a diet that used maize flour (US Cornmeal), and excluded wheat flour. (Tony Rail, ''op. cit.'' 156, 161).&lt;/ref&gt; and his own concerns at the closeness of Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley and Thomas Cooper's relationship, and their adverse influence on Dr Priestley; but this only led to a further estrangement between William and his sister-in-law. When, a while later, Priestley's household suffered a bout of food poisoning, perhaps from [[milk sickness]] or a [[Pathogenic bacteria|bacterial infection]], Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley, falsely accused William of having poisoned the family's flour. Although this allegation has attracted the attention of some modern historians, it is believed to be without foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Rail, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley continued the educational projects that had always been important to him, helping to establish the "Northumberland Academy" and donating his library to the fledgling institution. He exchanged letters regarding the proper structure of a university with [[Thomas Jefferson]], who used this advice when founding the [[University of Virginia]]. Jefferson and Priestley became close, and when he had completed his ''General History of the Christian Church'',&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''[https://archive.org/details/ageneralhistory03priegoog A General History of the Christian Church]''. Northumberland: Printed for the author by Andrew Kennedy, 1803.&lt;/ref&gt; he dedicated it to President Jefferson, writing that "it is now only that I can say I see nothing to fear from the hand of power, the government under which I live being for the first time truly favourable to me."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Schofield (2004), 339–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley tried to continue his scientific investigations in America with the support of the [[American Philosophical Society]]. He was hampered by lack of news from Europe; unaware of the latest scientific developments, Priestley was no longer on the forefront of discovery. Although the majority of his publications focused on defending [[phlogiston theory]], he also did some original work on [[spontaneous generation]] and dreams. Despite Priestley's reduced scientific output, his presence stimulated American interest in chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 352–72; Gibbs, 244–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1801, Priestley had become so ill that he could no longer write or experiment. He died on the morning of 6 February 1804,&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 400–01; Gibbs, 247–48; Thorpe, 162–65; Jackson, 324–25; Holt, 213–16.&lt;/ref&gt; aged seventy&lt;ref&gt;In accordance with known birth-death dates.  His original headstone gives his age as "LXXI" (71).&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried at Riverview Cemetery in [[Northumberland, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;For the original marker, see {{cite web| title=Edgar Fahs Smith Collection| url=http://dewey.library.upenn.edu/sceti/smith/PortraitList.cfm?ScientistID=223&amp;visited=smithScientist| accessdate=17 November 2006| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223002710/http://dewey.library.upenn.edu/sceti/smith/PortraitList.cfm?ScientistID=223&amp;visited=smithScientist| archivedate=23 December 2008| df=dmy-all}}

Priestley's epitaph reads:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Return unto thy rest, O my soul, for the
Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.
I will lay me down in peace and sleep till
I awake in the morning of the resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Schofield (2004), 401.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time he died in 1804, Priestley had been made a member of every major scientific society in the Western world and he had discovered numerous substances.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 151–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th-century French naturalist [[George Cuvier]], in his eulogy of Priestley, praised his discoveries while at the same time lamenting his refusal to abandon phlogiston theory, calling him "the father of modern chemistry [who] never acknowledged his daughter".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in McLachlan (1987–90), 259–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley published more than 150 works on topics ranging from political philosophy to education to theology to natural philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, 74; Kramnick, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He led and inspired British radicals during the 1790s, paved the way for [[utilitarianism]],&lt;ref name="Tapper, 322"&gt;Tapper, 322.&lt;/ref&gt; and helped found [[Unitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; A wide variety of philosophers, scientists, and poets became [[Association of Ideas|associationists]] as a result of his [[redaction]] of David Hartley's ''[[Observations on Man]]'', including [[Erasmus Darwin]], Coleridge, [[William Wordsworth]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Alexander Bain]], and [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 52–57; Holt, 111–12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] praised Priestley in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781), writing that he "knew how to combine his paradoxical teaching with the interests of religion".&lt;ref name=Tap314/&gt; Indeed, it was Priestley's aim to "put the most 'advanced' Enlightenment ideas into the service of a rationalized though heterodox Christianity, under the guidance of the basic principles of scientific method".&lt;ref name="Tapper, 322"/&gt;

Considering the extent of Priestley's influence, relatively little scholarship has been devoted to him. In the early 20th century, Priestley was most often described as a conservative and dogmatic scientist who was nevertheless a political and religious reformer.&lt;ref&gt;McEvoy (1983), 47.&lt;/ref&gt; In a historiographic review essay, historian of science [[Simon Schaffer]] describes the two dominant portraits of Priestley: the first depicts him as "a playful innocent" who stumbled across his discoveries; the second portrays him as innocent as well as "warped" for not understanding their implications better. Assessing Priestley's works as a whole has been difficult for scholars because of his wide-ranging interests. His scientific discoveries have usually been divorced from his theological and metaphysical publications to make an analysis of his life and writings easier, but this approach has been challenged recently by scholars such as John McEvoy and Robert Schofield. Although early Priestley scholarship claimed that his theological and metaphysical works were "distractions" and "obstacles" to his scientific work, scholarship published in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s maintained that Priestley's works constituted a unified theory. However, as Schaffer explains, no convincing synthesis of his work has yet been expounded.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, 154–57.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in 2001, historian of science Dan Eshet has argued that efforts to create a "synoptic view" have resulted only in a rationalisation of the contradictions in Priestley's thought, because they have been "organized around philosophical categories" and have "separate[d] the producers of scientific ideas from any social conflict".&lt;ref&gt;Eshet, 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley has been remembered by the towns in which he served as a reforming educator and minister and by the scientific organisations he influenced. Two educational institutions have been named in his honour—[[Priestley College]] in [[Warrington]] and [[Joseph Priestley College]] in [[City of Leeds|Leeds]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joseph-priestley.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=288&amp;Itemid=115 |title=Joseph Priestley College |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114060836/http://www.joseph-priestley.ac.uk/AboutUs/JosephPriestley.htm |archivedate=14 November 2007|publisher=Joseph Priestley College|accessdate=1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now part of [[Leeds City College]])—and an asteroid, [[5577 Priestley]], discovered in 1986 by [[Duncan Waldron]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmadel, Lutz D.

'''Lama''' ({{bo|t=བླ་མ་|w=bla-ma}}; "chief" or "high priest"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lama |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a title for a teacher of the ''[[Dharma]]'' in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. The name is similar to the [[Sanskrit]] term ''[[guru]]'' and in use it is similar, but not identical to the western monastic rank of [[abbot]].&lt;ref name="brit"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/328400/lama "lama"] from [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the term was used for venerated spiritual masters&lt;ref&gt;[http://buddhism.about.com/od/buddhismglossaryl/g/lamadef.htm Lama:definition] at [[About.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marcotte |first=Amanda |url=http://www.slate.com/id/1004379/ |title=Who Are the Tibetan Lamas? |publisher=Slate.com |date=2000-01-14 |accessdate=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; or heads of [[monastery|monasteries]].&lt;ref name="brit"/&gt; Today the title can be used as an [[honorific|honorific title]] conferred on a [[Bhikkhu|monk]],&lt;ref name="brit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt; nun or (in the [[Nyingma]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Sakya]] schools) advanced [[vajrayana|tantric]] practitioner to designate a level of spiritual attainment and authority to teach, or may be part of a title such as [[Dalai Lama]]&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt; or [[Panchen Lama]]&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt; applied to a [[Lineage (Buddhism)#Tibetan Buddhism|lineage]] of reincarnate lamas ([[Tulku]]s).

Perhaps due to misunderstandings by early western scholars attempting to understand Tibetan Buddhism, the term ''lama'' has historically been erroneously applied to Tibetan monks in general. Similarly, Tibetan Buddhism was referred to as "Lamaism"&lt;ref name="brit"/&gt; by early western scholars and travelers who perhaps did not understand that what they were witnessing was a form of Buddhism;&lt;ref name="brit"/&gt; they may also have been unaware of the distinction between Tibetan Buddhism and [[Bön]]. The term Lamaism is now considered by some to be derogatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Frank J. Korom |coauthors= |title=Constructing Tibetan Culture: Contemporary Perspectives |year=1997 |publisher=World Heritage Press |quote= | url= |isbn=1-896064-12-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Vajrayana]] path of Tibetan Buddhism, the lama is often the [[Tantra|tantric]] spiritual guide, the guru to the aspiring Buddhist ''[[yogi]]'' or ''[[yogini]]''. As such, the lama will then appear as one of the [[Three Roots]] (a variant of the [[Three Jewels]]), alongside the ''[[yidam]]'' and protector (who may be a ''[[dakini]]'', ''[[dharmapala]]'' or other Buddhist deity figure).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11040">'''Platonists''' are followers of [[Platonism]], the philosophy of [[Plato]]. Platonism can be said to have begun when Plato founded his [[Platonic Academy|academy]] c. 385 BC. Ancient Platonism went on to last until the end of the last remaining pagan school of Platonism in Alexandria which was brought on by the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] in 641, over a thousand years after the opening of the first Platonic school. Platonism had an immense impact on the intellectual life of the ancient world eventually becoming the dominant philosophy of [[late antiquity]].

'''Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu''' ({{IPA-ro|luˈkret͡sju pətrəʃˈkanu}}; November 4, 1900 – April 17, 1954) was a [[Romania]]n [[Communism|communist]] politician and leading member of the [[Communist Party of Romania]] (PCR), also noted for his activities as a lawyer, sociologist and economist. For a while, he was a professor at [[University of Bucharest|Bucharest University]].
Pătrășcanu rose to a government position before the end of [[World War II]] and, after having disagreed with [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] tenets on several occasions, eventually came into conflict with the [[Communist Romania|Romanian Communist government]] of [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]]. He became a [[political prisoner]] and was ultimately executed. Fourteen years after Pătrășcanu's death, Romania's new communist leader, [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], endorsed his [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitation]] as part of a change in policy.

==Early life==
Pătrășcanu was born in [[Bacău]] to a leading political family, as the son of [[Poporanism|Poporanist]] figure [[Dimitrie D. Pătrășcanu]] (Lucrețiu's mother was a scion of the Stoika family of [[Transylvania]]n [[petty nobility]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mocsony Stârcea, in Caranfil, p.30. The Pătrășcanu branch of the family was also described as "of low-ranking [[Moldavia]]n [[boyar]]s" by historian [[Stelian Tănase]], who also argued that Pătrășcanu had been confronted with criticism that he was "a [[Liberal elite|salon communist]]" (Tănase, "Belu Zilber".I)&lt;/ref&gt; He became a Poporanist and later a [[socialist]] in his youth,&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp.236–238&lt;/ref&gt; joining the [[Socialist Party of Romania]] in 1919,&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp.238–239&lt;/ref&gt; and working as editor of its newspaper, ''Socialismul'' (1921).&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.239&lt;/ref&gt; Professionally, he was educated at the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Law (graduated 1922) and at the [[University of Leipzig]] (earning his [[Ph.D.]] in 1925).&lt;ref name="Cioroianu, p.240"&gt;Cioroianu, p.240&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly radical after the success of the [[October Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.238&lt;/ref&gt; he was one of the original members of the PCR (known as PCdR at the time) in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.34; Tismăneanu, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; Pătrășcanu, [[Elek Köblös]] and [[Ana Pauker|Ana]] and [[Marcel Pauker]] were the representatives of the group to the 4th [[Comintern]] Congress in [[Moscow]] (November–December 1922).&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.34; Frunză, p.39&lt;/ref&gt; Back in Romania, Pătrășcanu was arrested and imprisoned at [[Jilava]] in 1924 (the year when the party was outlawed); he went on [[hunger strike]] until being relocated to a prison hospital.&lt;ref name="Cioroianu, p.240"/&gt;

At the [[Kharkiv]] Congress of 1928, where he was present under the name Mironov,&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.37; Ioniță, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; Pătrășcanu clashed with the Comintern overseer [[Bohumír Šmeral]], as well as with many of his fellow party members, over the issue of [[Bessarabia]] and [[Moldovenism]], which was to be passed into a resolution stating that [[Greater Romania]] was an [[Imperialism|imperialist]] entity. Pătrășcanu argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Moldovans]] are not a nation apart and—from a historical and geographical point of view—Moldovans are the same [[Romanians]] as the Romanians in [[Moldavia]] [on the right bank of the [[Prut River]]]. Thus, I believe that the introduction of such a false point renders the resolution itself false.&lt;ref&gt;Pătrășcanu, in Ioniță, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==1930s==
With [[Imre Aladar]], [[Eugen Rozvan]] and two others, Pătrășcanu was elected to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]] in May 1931 as a candidate for the ''Workers and Peasants' Bloc'', an [[umbrella group]] masking the outlawed party.&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.148-149; Tismăneanu, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same year, the 5th Party Congress (held in Soviet exile, at [[Gorikovo]]), chose him among the new [[Central Committee]] members while [[Alexander Stefanski]] rose to the position of [[general secretary]].&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.39; Tismăneanu, p.72&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, he was involved in polemics at the ''[[Criterion (literary society)|Criterion]]'' group, where he and his collaborator [[Belu Zilber]] defended a [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] view of [[Vladimir Lenin]] in front of criticism from the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Mircea Vulcănescu]] and [[Mihail Polihroniade]],&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.150&lt;/ref&gt; as well as from the [[Austromarxism|Austromarxist]] perspective of [[Henri H. Stahl]].&lt;ref&gt;Petreu, "O generație apolitică, paricidă, autohtonistă, experiențialistă, antipașoptistă"; Tănase, "Belu Zilber".II&lt;/ref&gt;

Pătrășcanu again served as the PCdR's representative to the Comintern in 1933, and 1934 (remaining in Moscow until 1935),&lt;ref&gt;Editor's note in Caranfil, p.30; Tănase, "Belu Zilber".II&lt;/ref&gt; during which time he is thought to have developed doubts about Stalinism itself.&lt;ref&gt;Tănase, "Belu Zilber".II&lt;/ref&gt; He put these questions aside in order to prioritize opposition to [[fascism]], and remained active in the PCR. In 1936, he was heading the defense team of PCR members who were facing the much-publicized [[1936 Craiova Trial|Craiova Trial]], but was himself denounced as a communist and consequently handed the position to [[Ion Gheorghe Maurer]].&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.234&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II imprisonment==
Pătrășcanu was imprisoned during [[World War II]] and, after August 1940, spent time at the [[Târgu Jiu]] internment camp with [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] and the "prison faction" of the Party (the communists inside Romania, virtually all imprisoned at various stages of the war, as opposed to those who had taken refuge inside the Soviet Union).

Like his fellow activist [[Scarlat Callimachi (communist activist)|Scarlat Callimachi]], he was set free by the [[National Legionary State|National Legionary Government]] while the fascist [[Iron Guard]], which allied Romania with [[Nazi Germany]], was trying to preserve good relations with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Chiva &amp; Șchiop&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently followed orders from [[Teohari Georgescu]] to re-create a defunct outlet of the party, the cultural society ''[[Amicii URSS]]'' ("Friends of the USSR").&lt;ref name="Betea, Ambiția"&gt;Betea, "Ambiția..."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, following the [[Legionnaires' Rebellion and Bucharest Pogrom|Legionary Rebellion]], he was again arrested by the regime of ''[[Conducător]]'' [[Ion Antonescu]]. After a release from camp for health reasons in 1943, he was under [[house arrest]] in [[Poiana Țapului]]; allowed to settle in [[Bucharest]] later in that year, he remained under supervision until May 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Editor's note in Caranfil, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

==1944 negotiations and fall of Foriș==
In April, Pătrășcanu was contacted by [[Ioan Mocsony Stârcea]], baron de Foen, marshal of [[King of Romania|King]] [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]]'s court between 1942 and 1944, who mediated an agreement between the monarch and the Communists regarding a pro-[[Allies of World War II|Allied]] move to overthrow [[Antonescu]] and withdraw Romania, which was fighting the Soviets on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], from the [[Axis Powers|Axis]].&lt;ref name="Mocsony Stârcea, in Caranfil, p.30"&gt;Mocsony Stârcea, in Caranfil, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Pătrășcanu (together with [[Emil Bodnăraș]], who maintained links with the Soviets)&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.131; Rădulescu&lt;/ref&gt; represented the Communist Party during the clandestine talks with the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal]] and [[National Peasants' Party|National Peasants']] parties, aimed at overthrowing the Antonescu dictatorship. [[Corneliu Coposu]], who had friendly contacts with Pătrășcanu at the time, attested that the latter had been selected by the Soviets as representative of the Communists (during negotiations in [[Cairo]], [[Nikolai Vasilevich Novikov|Nikolai Novikov]], the Soviet ambassador to [[Egypt]], had reportedly first mentioned Pătrășcanu's name to [[Barbu Știrbey]] for further contacts).&lt;ref name="Rădulescu"&gt;Rădulescu&lt;/ref&gt; It was also at this time that Gheorghiu-Dej and Bodnăraș, together with [[Constantin Pîrvulescu]] and [[Iosif Rangheț]], toppled the general secretary [[Ștefan Foriș]], and assumed leadership of the party&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.49-50, 62; Frunză, p.400-402; Rădulescu&lt;/ref&gt; (Gheorghiu-Dej had probably attracted Pătrășcanu's support for the planned move as early as 1943).&lt;ref name="Betea, Ambiția"/&gt;

According to Mocsony Stârcea, Pătrășcanu was responsible for a compromise between the Communist Party and institutions of the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian monarchy]] (allegedly assuring the king that it was not his party's intent to proclaim a republic without a previous [[referendum]] on the matter).&lt;ref name="Mocsony Stârcea, in Caranfil, p.30"/&gt; Coposu also stated that, through Pătrășcanu, the Communist Party had entered negotiations with the other opposition groups regarding the pledge of having abandoned its previous theses of the future Romanian state.&lt;ref name="Rădulescu"/&gt;

==August 23 and government position==
The collaboration led to the arrest of Ion Antonescu and [[Mihai Antonescu]] at the [[National Museum of Art of Romania|Royal Palace]] in Bucharest, during the [[King Michael Coup|August 23 Coup]] (1944). Pătrășcanu authored the proclamation to the country which the king read on [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|National Radio]] immediately after the coup,&lt;ref&gt;Barbu, "Destinul colectiv...", p.188; Tănase, "Belu Zilber".II&lt;/ref&gt; and, confronting the new [[List of Prime Ministers of Romania|Premier]] [[Constantin Sănătescu]], imposed himself as a PCR representative on the delegation that signed Romania's [[armistice]] with the Soviets, on September 12, 1944.&lt;ref name="antisovietismul"&gt;Betea, "Antisovietismul..."&lt;/ref&gt;  Present in [[Moscow]], he contacted [[Ana Pauker]] and [[Vasile Luca]] through their overseer [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], reestablishing communication between the two major sections of the PCR.&lt;ref name="antisovietismul" /&gt; Pătrășcanu joined the [[Central Committee]] in 1945—after having returned to Romania with the [[Red Army]] late in 1944—and was largely responsible for the success his party had in controlling Romania's legal framework for the following years.&lt;ref&gt;Barbu, "Destinul colectiv...", p.188-190&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]], he served on the Romanian [[Politburo]] from 1946 to 1947 and held power in the new governments, as [[Minister without Portfolio]] (1944) and Minister of Justice (1944–1948).&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.232&lt;/ref&gt; Pătrășcanu, who according to journalist Victor Frunză and politician [[Corneliu Coposu]] attempted to become [[general secretary]] early in 1944 (before Gheorghiu-Dej secured the position for himself),&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.214-215; Rădulescu&lt;/ref&gt; was considered{{who|date=September 2018}} leader of the party's "Secretariat Communists" (perceived{{who|date=September 2018}} as less willing to follow Stalin's directions).

After the ascension of the [[Petru Groza]] government, Pătrășcanu was also one of the initiators of purges and persecutions, being responsible for dismissing and arresting members of the [[civil service]] who were considered suspect, for the creation of the [[Romanian People's Tribunals]], as well as the appointment of prosecutors (promoting [[Avram Bunaciu]], [[Constanța Crăciun]], and [[Alexandra Sidorovici]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.226, 232-233; Frunză, p.227, 471&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing a statement by Pătrășcanu rendered by ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] commentator [[Tony Cliff]] extended his critique of the [[People's Republic|people's democracies]] of the [[Eastern Bloc]] to the realm of justice systems and retribution for [[war crime]]s.&lt;ref name="cliff"&gt;Cliff&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United States|American]] newspaper, Pătrășcanu had reassured media that "industrialists, businessmen and bankers will escape punishment as war criminals";&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', in Cliff&lt;/ref&gt; Cliff also argued that the new course in justice had failed to alter what he saw as Romania's "[[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] and [[Militarism|militarist]] character".&lt;ref name="cliff" /&gt;

Pătrășcanu put pressure on King Michael to sign legislation that went against the letter of the [[1923 Constitution of Romania|1923 Constitution]], which contributed to the latter's decision to initiate the "royal strike" (a refusal to countersign documents issued by the Groza executive).&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.226-227&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early conflicts with party==
During the late 1940s, he is thought to have begun expressing his opposition to strict Stalinist guidelines; at the same time, Pătrășcanu had become suspect to the rest of the party leadership for his intellectual approach to socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.92-93, 175, 177, 195, 222, 234-235, 262; Tismăneanu, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gheorghe Apostol]], a collaborator of Gheorghiu-Dej's, later expressed a particular view on the matter of Pătrășcanu's relations with the rest of the party:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He was a reliable party [[intellectual]]. But he was also a very arrogant man, self-important, intolerant, and unwilling to communicate with his party comrades. And yet, Gheorghiu-Dej treasured him. Between '46-'48, Pătrășcanu changed quite a lot."&lt;ref&gt;Apostol, in Antoniu et al.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Around February 1945, he began to fear the possibility that [[Emil Bodnăraș]] was planning his assassination and that he intended to blame it on political opponents of the Communist Party (as a means to direct sympathy towards the latter group).&lt;ref name="Betea, Ambiția"/&gt; He suspected that Bodnăraș had chosen to back Gheorghiu-Dej (allegedly fearing that Pătrășcanu was betraying the fragile alliance established before the fall of [[Ștefan Foriș]]).&lt;ref name="Betea, Ambiția"/&gt; Consequently, he attempted to block Bodnăraș's rise to power, and denounced his reputedly [[Political corruption|corrupt]] activities as Secretary in the [[List of Romanian Ministers of the Interior|Interior Ministry]] to the other members of the leadership.&lt;ref name="Betea, Ambiția"/&gt;

Historiography is divided over the possibility of Pătrășcanu having initially allied himself with the PCR's second in command, [[Ana Pauker]], in her post-war confrontation with Gheorghiu-Dej.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.177, 184-195&lt;/ref&gt; It is apparent that Pătrășcanu was alarmed by Pauker's close cooperation with Soviet overseers, and especially by her tight connection with [[Dmitry Manuilsky]];&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.179&lt;/ref&gt; it was also contended that Pauker was intrigued by Pătrășcanu's self-promotion in front of Soviet overseers during late 1944.&lt;ref name="Betea, Ambiția" /&gt; Under arrest, however, Pătrășcanu asserted that he was closest to [[Pauker]] and [[Teohari Georgescu]] among the Romanian party leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Declaration of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, November 18, 1949, ASRI, Fond P, Dosar 40002, Vol. 1, p. 113; cited in Robert Levy, ''Ana Pauker:  The Rise and Fall of a Jewish Communist,'' Berkeley and Los Angeles:  2001,, p. 139, 315, n. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Although, overall, Pătrășcanu was argued to have been much less revolutionary-minded than various other PCR ideologues,&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.241-244, 255-256, 261-262&lt;/ref&gt; his original perspective on [[Marxism]] remained strongly connected with party doctrine in its most essential points&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.241, 248-251, 254-255&lt;/ref&gt; (including his intense advocacy of [[collectivization]], using statistics to point out the existence of a class of ''chiaburi'', the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] equivalent of the Soviet ''[[kulak]]s'').&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.252&lt;/ref&gt; He showed himself surprised when informed that the Soviet Union had planned a rapid [[communization]] of the country, and dismissed [[Vasile Luca]] and Pauker's vocal support for the latter policy.&lt;ref name="Betea, Ambiția" /&gt; Instead, he argued in favor of "making a distinction inside the [[bourgeoisie]]",&lt;ref name="Pătrășcanu, in Betea, Ambiția"&gt;Pătrășcanu, in Betea, "Ambiția..."&lt;/ref&gt; and opening the Communist Party to collaboration with the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]].&lt;ref name="Betea, Ambiția"/&gt; Based on this, he denounced Pauker's agreement with [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]]'s National Liberal dissidence (the [[National Liberal Party-Tătărescu]], which he called "a gang of [[Confidence trick|con artists]], [[blackmail]]ers, and well-known [[bribe]]rs").&lt;ref name="Pătrășcanu, in Betea, Ambiția"/&gt;

A serious break with the party line occurred in early 1946, when Pătrășcanu decided to take initiative and intervened in the standoff between [[King of Romania|King]] [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]] and the [[Petru Groza]] executive (an episode colloquially known as ''greva regală'', "the royal [[Strike action|strike]]"); with the help of [[Lena Constante]], he approached the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] figures [[Victor Rădulescu-Pogoneanu]] and [[Grigore Niculescu-Buzești]], calling on them to convince the monarch to resume communications with his government.&lt;ref name="Betea, Ambiția"/&gt;

==1946 elections==
During the campaign preceding the [[Romanian general election, 1946|rigged elections of 1946]], he was actively involved in the PCR's electoral campaign in [[Transylvania]], and, after [[drought]] and [[famine]] surfaced in several other areas of Romania, he attempted to persuade the peasants of [[Arad County]] to sell their wheat harvest to the government, to be used as aid.&lt;ref name="Pokivailova, p.13"&gt;Pokivailova, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; Received with suspicion, he later reported that he had eventually been able to carry out the task.&lt;ref name="Pokivailova, p.13"/&gt;

Responding to [[Hungarian minority in Romania|Hungarian]]-Romanian clashes, Pătrășcanu gave a speech in the city of [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], one in which he attempted to identify communism and [[patriotism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.225-226&lt;/ref&gt; It stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the name of the government and of the PCR, I raise my voice against border changes [in connection with the disputed status of newly-recovered [[Northern Transylvania]]]. Democratic Romania ensures [[social equality|equal rights]] to coinhabiting nationalities, but the Magyar population needs to understand that its belonging to the Romanian state is definitive. Nobody has the right to debate our borders.&lt;ref&gt;Pătrășcanu, June 1946, in Betea, "Portret în gri...", p.37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He ran for the position of [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|deputy]] in Arad County, and won through various [[electoral fraud]]s (in Arad's case, forty inspectors nominated by the government had sole control over counting and recording the results).&lt;ref&gt;Betea, "Portret în gri...", p.38-39&lt;/ref&gt;

Pătrășcanu soon received harsh criticism from Gheorghiu-Dej, who branded the views expressed as "[[chauvinism]]" and "[[Reformism|revisionism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghiu-Dej during a PCR [[Central Committee]] plenum, November 1946, in Frunză, p.362, in Tismăneanu, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, the [[National Peasants' Party]], as the main force opposing the PCR, published praises of Pătrășcanu in its paper ''[[Dreptatea]]'', until Pătrășcanu met with the editor, [[Nicolae Carandino]], and explained that such articles were harming his image inside the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;Betea, "Portret în gri...", p.37&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Pătrășcanu's writings of the time show that, in contrast with his 1928 point of view, he had largely accommodated [[Leninism|Leninist]] principles regarding the national issue and [[Bessarabia]]n topics,&lt;ref&gt;Betea, "Antisovietismul..."; Cioroianu, p.224, 246-247, 261&lt;/ref&gt; although he used more neutral terms than the ones present in official [[propaganda]],&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.247, 253-254&lt;/ref&gt; and was known to have deplored the unwillingness of the PCR to reduce and refine its [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.275; Cioroianu, p.261-262&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marginalisation==
In 1946-1947, Pătrășcanu was nevertheless a member of the Tătărescu-headed Romanian delegation to the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Conference]], and, in fact, one of the signatories of the Peace Treaty with Romania. According to [[Belu Zilber]], during this time, he read [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ''[[Darkness at Noon]]''&lt;ref&gt;Zilber, rendered in Tănase, "Belu Zilber".III; in Tismăneanu, p.75, 114&lt;/ref&gt; (a glimpse into [[forced confession]]s alluding to the 1936-1937 [[Moscow Trials]], the book was banned throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]]). The attitudes he expressed in [[Paris]] were considered [[Nationalism|nationalist]] by his Soviet overseers,&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.359-360; Tismăneanu, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; and he himself complained to Gheorghiu-Dej about the party's suspicion surrounding his diplomatic activities.&lt;ref&gt;Betea, "Portret în gri...", p.37; Tănase, "Belu Zilber".II&lt;/ref&gt;

He was progressively marginalized inside the Party: his texts became subject to [[censorship]] and, on public occasions, his name was mentioned after those of less significant politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.362&lt;/ref&gt; The Communist press virtually ceased referring to Pătrășcanu as "[[comrade]]", and used instead the more distant formula "Professor Pătrășcanu", at the same time as Gheorghiu-Dej's speeches on combating internal currents of the Party.&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.360-361&lt;/ref&gt; The VIth Party Congress in February 1948 did not confirm his Central Committee membership, and in the months following the event, he was removed from government office.&lt;ref&gt;Drăgoescu, p.23; Frunză, p.363&lt;/ref&gt;

Belu Zilber claimed that having himself been subject to suspicion and marginalisation, he had attempted to warn Pătrășcanu of the change in climate, and had asked him to consider fleeing the Eastern Bloc, only to be stiffly rebuffed.&lt;ref name="Tănase, Belu Zilber.III"&gt;Tănase, "Belu Zilber".III&lt;/ref&gt; Zilber was eventually arrested in February 1948, on suspicion that he had been a [[Siguranța Statului]] agent infiltrating the party.&lt;ref name="Tănase, Belu Zilber.III"/&gt;

==Securitate imprisonment and interrogations==
On April 28, 1948, Pătrășcanu was arrested and came under the investigation of a party committee, comprising the high-ranking Communists [[Teohari Georgescu]], [[Alexandru Drăghici]], and [[Iosif Rangheț]]; interrogations were occasionally attended by Gheorghiu-Dej.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.201; Drăgoescu, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; His file indicates that the [[secret police]] (which was soon to become the [[Securitate]]) had been keeping him under surveillance from as early as the summer of 1946.&lt;ref name="Drăgoescu, p.23"&gt;Drăgoescu, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1949, [[Gheorghiu-Dej]] (apparently contradicting the committee's conclusions) ordered Pătrășcanu's transfer into the custody of the Secret Service of the Council of Ministers (SSI) under the provisional charge that Pătrășcanu had not reported various political crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Drăgoescu, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; A report on "[[Titoism]]" and collaboration with the maverick [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was presented to the [[Cominform]]: it placed Pătrășcanu, the [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungarian Republic]]'s [[László Rajk]], and [[History of Communist Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]'s [[Traicho Kostov]] in the same camp, as "[[Imperialism|imperialist]] agents" (''see [[Tito-Stalin split]], [[Informbiro]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation also implicated [[Remus Koffler]], who had been imprisoned in 1944, during the confrontation between Gheorghiu-Dej and [[Ștefan Foriș]].&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.402&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after the SSI began its inquiry, Pătrășcanu attempted suicide by slitting his veins with a smuggled razor blade; upon his recovery, he tried to take his life a second time by swallowing an overdose of sleeping pills.&lt;ref&gt;Pătrășcanu and his SSI handlers revealed this in subsequent interrogations or statements; cited in Levy, p. 145, 318, note 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after his second suicide attempt, the Pătrășcanu inquiry was transferred to the Interior Ministry, where it was suspended for a six-month period to enable officers to determine a factual basis in the case.&lt;ref&gt;Levy,'' Ana Pauker'', p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the inquiry resumed in February 1951, Interior Minister [[Teohari Georgescu]] ordered that the detainees in the case were not to be physically coerced, in stark contrast to the expressed instructions of the ministry's chief Soviet adviser, [[Aleksandr Sakharovsky]], to do everything necessary to determine the guilt of the accused. In the summer of 1951 [[Teohari Georgescu]], together with his deputies [[Gheorghe Pintilie]] and [[Mișu Dulgheru]], reached the conclusion that there was no basis to continue Pătrășcanu's prosecution—and did so while the [[Soviet advisers]] were away on their summer vacation. When the advisers returned, they angrily vetoed any closing of the Pătrășcanu inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Levy,'' Ana Pauker'', p. 147-148.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in 1951 that Pătrășcanu responded to the charges voiced by Gheorghiu-Dej after the Cluj incident, indicating that he had attempted to "answer to the Hungarian [[Revanchism|revisionist]] campaign", as well as to aid his party in competing with the appeal of the National Peasants' Party among Romanians in Transylvania (to "take the weapon that was Transylvania away from [[Iuliu Maniu|Maniu]] supporters' hands").&lt;ref&gt;Pătrășcanu, in Betea, "Portret în gri...", p.37&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticized his own advocacy of a PCR alliance with the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]].&lt;ref name="Betea, Ambiția"/&gt;

He was accused of having been financed by "[[bourgeois]]" figures during the electoral campaign, and even of having been bought by agents of the [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;Betea, "Portret în gri...", p.36, 37; Drăgoescu, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; or of planning, together with [[Ioan Mocsony Stârcea, baron de Foen|Ioan Mocsony Stârcea]] and Titoist agents, an "[[imperialist]]" insurrection in [[Săvârșin]].&lt;ref&gt;Betea, "Portret în gri...", p.39&lt;/ref&gt; The latter allegation also surfaced in the parallel investigations of Koffler and [[Emil Calmanovici]].&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"&gt;Betea, "Recunoștința..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious questions remain on the positions of the various Romanian Communist leaders on the Pătrășcanu case. The matter has not been satisfactorily resolved in the Romanian archives, for the simple reason that all records and transcripts of Politburo and Secretariat discussions on Pătrășcanu were summarily destroyed on Gheorghiu-Dej's orders.&lt;ref&gt;"Report on the Party Commission Established to Clarify the Situation of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, submitted to the Party Leadership on June 29, 1968," Executive Archive of the Central Committee of the R.C.P., pp. 43-44; cited in Levy,'' Ana Pauker'', p. 149, note 133.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, no piece of evidence or confession was obtained by the inquiry until after May 1952, after the purge of [[Ana Pauker]] and [[Teohari Georgescu]], who were accused by the Soviet adviser Sakharovskii of having "sabotaged and postponed investigations" in the Pătrășcanu case.&lt;ref&gt;Levy,'' Ana Pauker'', p. 149, 321, note 137.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Central Committee plenum that purged them assigned the Pătrășcanu investigation to a team of Securitate officials and their Soviet advisors, directly supervised by Alexandru Drăghici, [[Alexandru Nicolschi]], and [[Vladimir Mazuru]].&lt;ref&gt;Betea, "Recunoștința..."; Drăgoescu, p.24, 25; Golopenția&lt;/ref&gt; Under this new team, torture and beating began to be employed in interrogations in the Pătrășcanu case for the first time in the fall of 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Levy,'' Ana Pauker'', p. 150-151.&lt;/ref&gt; In time, authorities also alleged that, before 1944, Pătrășcanu, like Zilber, had acted as an agent of [[Siguranța Statului]].&lt;ref&gt;Drăgoescu, p.24-25; Ionițoiu; Tănase, "Belu Zilber".III&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and execution==
Pătrășcanu was kept in detention until 1954, when he was executed on 17 April&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cIpMCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT90&amp;lpg=PT90#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=De-Stalinising Eastern Europe: The Rehabilitation of Stalin's Victims after 1953 | publisher=Springer | author=McDermott, Kevin; Stibbe, Matthew | year=2015 | isbn=9781137368928}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Koffler in [[Jilava]], near [[Bucharest]], after a [[show trial]] overseen by [[Iosif Chișinevschi]].&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.398; Drăgoescu, p.25-26; Ionițoiu&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that he was [[torture]]d throughout the questioning conducted on direct orders from the Securitate's [[Alexandru Drăghici]], and he had one leg [[Amputation|amputated]] for unknown reasons before his trial.&lt;ref&gt;Drăgoescu, p.25; Frunză, p.408-409&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation for the procedures, the Securitate took direct inspiration from the [[Slánský trials]] in [[History of Communist Czechoslovakia|Communist Czechoslovakia]] (where a team of Romanian officers had been sent to take notes) and, possibly, from the Soviet [[Trial of the Twenty One]] (which was allegedly used as template for Calmanovici's fabricated confession).&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt;

Pătrășcanu refused to be represented by a lawyer, and even to organize his own defense. Aside from some outbursts against the prosecutors, he stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have nothing to say, except [that I] spit on the charges brought against me.&lt;ref&gt;Pătrășcanu, in Drăgoescu, p.26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The actions taken against Pătrășcanu and others signaled the start of a wave of arrests and prison sentences, including that of his wife, as well as those of [[Harry Brauner]], [[Lena Constante]], [[Petre Pandrea]] (who was Pătrășcanu's brother-in-law), [[Herant Torosian]], Mocsony Stârcea, Calmanovici, Victoria Sârbu (who had been [[Ștefan Foriș]]'s lover), and Alexandru Ștefănescu.&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.401, 409; Golopenția; Ionițoiu; Tănase, "Belu Zilber".II&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the trial, the Securitate organized violent interrogations of political detainees (among others, the National Peasant Party's [[Corneliu Coposu]] and the Liberal politician [[Bebe Brătianu]]) or suspects ([[Gheorghe Tătărescu]], who testified against Pătrășcanu and was the target of a sharp rebuke from the latter).&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.228; Ionițoiu&lt;/ref&gt;

Belu Zilber, the first of the group to give in to Securitate pressures and confessed to the charges, was verbally attacked by Pătrășcanu inside the courthouse — Pătrășcanu notably accused him of having invented the entire conspiracy account.&lt;ref&gt;Tănase, "Belu Zilber".I&lt;/ref&gt; Records of their various interrogations show that both he and Calmanovici identified [[Emil Bodnăraș]] as the main instigator of their downfall.&lt;ref name="Betea, Recunoștința"/&gt;

==Rehabilitation==
He was posthumously [[rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] in April 1968 by [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], in the latter's attempt to discredit his predecessors and establish his own legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.256; Cioroianu, p.233, 397-399&lt;/ref&gt; The main target of this campaign, as indicated by a Central Committee resolution, was Drăghici:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] the party leadership has uncovered the anti-party line which Alexandru Drăghici, encouraged by servile, uncultured, and decaying elements, has introduced to the [Securitate] bodies' activities, attempting to remove them from party control and to erect them into supreme bodies standing above party and state leadership, thus causing serious harm to activity in various domains, including that of scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;''Analele Institutului de Studii Istorice și Social-Politice de pe lângă CC al PCR'', in Müller, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A party committee which included [[Ion Popescu-Puțuri]]&lt;ref name="Drăgoescu, p.23"/&gt; investigated the matter of his arrest and interrogation, concluding that evidence against Pătrășcanu was fabricated, that he had been systematically beaten and otherwise ill-treated, and that a confession had been prepared for him to sign.&lt;ref&gt;Betea, "Recunoștința..."; Drăgoescu, p.25; Golopenția&lt;/ref&gt; This was coupled with various irregularities in procedures (such as the court having been given only 24 hours to assess evidence from years of investigation, and the death penalty having been decided by the party leadership before being imposed on the panel of judges).&lt;ref&gt;Drăgoescu, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence was also presented that some of the false confessions were designed as political weapons in internal party struggles (implicating names of politicians who were not facing trial at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Drăgoescu, p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Party Plenum in late April 1968, Ceaușescu used Pătrășcanu's case and other ones to single out the negative influence of Drăghici and Iosif Chișinevschi, while also placing suspicion on Emil Bodnăraș and [[Gheorghe Apostol]], who had approved of Pătrășcanu's purge.&lt;ref name="Cioroianu, p.398-399"&gt;Cioroianu, p.398-399&lt;/ref&gt; All of them were required to express "[[self-criticism]]",&lt;ref name="Cioroianu, p.398-399"/&gt; while Gheorghiu-Dej was condemned for having "initiated and overseen" the measures.&lt;ref&gt;Rendered in Cioroianu, p.399&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceaușescu profited on the enduring perception of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu's activities as patriotic and verging on [[dissidence]], while shadowing his fundamental role in the creation of the new penal system in Romania. In fact, although he was frequently quoted and displayed by the regime, Pătrășcanu's life was usually described in brief and vague sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.256; Cioroianu, p.233; Müller, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; In popular discourse, Pătrășcanu was also largely identified with positive causes, and remained among the most popular Communist figures after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]] toppled the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Betea, "Antisovietismul..."; Cioroianu, p.223-224, 230-231; Tănase, "Belu Zilber".II&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology==

===Overview===
In his most important volumes (most of which attracted public attention only after 1944),&lt;ref name="stahl"&gt;Stahl&lt;/ref&gt; Pătrășcanu combined his commitment to [[Marxism-Leninism]] with his sociological training, producing an original outlook on social evolution (focusing on major trends in Romanian society from the time of the [[Danubian Principalities]] to his day).&lt;ref name="stahl" /&gt;

Aside from its support for communist tenets, his work shared many characteristics with the prominent currents of the Romanian sociological school (notably, the attention paid to prevailing social contrasts in a peasant-dominated environment),&lt;ref&gt;Barbu, ''Political Science in Romania''&lt;/ref&gt; and made occasional use of material provided by [[Dimitrie Gusti]]'s comprehensive surveys.&lt;ref name="stahl" /&gt;

===On feudalism and serfdom===
According to Pătrășcanu, [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] had forsaken [[feudalism]] by the mid 18th century, maintaining instead a form of [[serfdom]] which had not been affected by the reforms of ''[[Hospodar]]'' [[Constantine Mavrocordatos]].&lt;ref name="stahl" /&gt; He argued that, whereas feudalism was supported by ''[[metayage]]'', legislation passed by Mavrocordatos had endorsed and prolonged  ''[[corvée]]s'', a system consecrated in the 1830s by the new [[Regulamentul Organic|Organic Statute]].&lt;ref name="stahl" /&gt; In his view, [[capitalism]] had manifested itself mainly as a [[reactionary]] force inside Romanian economy during the time of [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] rules. Thus, despite characteristic [[underdevelopment]] (which he also noted), the local economy had not contrasted with the stages postulated by [[Marxian economics]].&lt;ref name="stahl" /&gt;

Pătrășcanu contended that the first relevant social conflict had occurred in 1821, at the time of [[Tudor Vladimirescu]]'s [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|Wallachian uprising]]. He rejected the notion that, despite Vladimirescu's statements to the contrary, the rebellion had a peasant character, and argued instead that it was evidence of low-ranking [[boyars]] and merchants ("the embryo of a [[Social class|class]], that was to become the [[bourgeoisie]]")&lt;ref name="Pătrășcanu, in Stahl"&gt;Pătrășcanu, in Stahl&lt;/ref&gt; attempting to emancipate themselves from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] pressures.&lt;ref name="stahl" /&gt; In his view, its [[Nationalism|nationalist]] character (''see [[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]]'') had been manipulated by high-ranking boyars as a measure to dissuade adverse reactions to [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s.&lt;ref name="stahl" /&gt;

===On radicalism and reformism===
The [[Wallachian revolution of 1848|Wallachian Revolution of 1848]], the most successful of similar revolts at the time, was, according to Pătrășcanu, a mature reaction of bourgeois circles against boyar supremacy&lt;ref name="stahl" /&gt; ("it only sought [...] to replace a [privileged] minority with another"),&lt;ref name="Pătrășcanu, in Stahl"/&gt; but was generally not opposed to preserving an [[Estate in land|estate]]-based economy.&lt;ref name="stahl" /&gt; He similarly rejected [[Junimea]]'s traditional criticism of post-1848 realities, indicating that, in its theory of "forms without substance", the group had failed to note that, as a means to preserve several [[Conservatism|conservative]] tenets, [[Westernization]] in Romania had willingly, and not accidentally, adopted an incomplete form.'''''&lt;ref&gt;Cernea; Stahl&lt;/ref&gt; '''''

In analyzing the history of [[liberalism and radicalism in Romania]], he concluded that many of the most extreme [[social reform]]ists had rallied in opposition to [[land reform]] (he saw this phenomenon as having made possible the toppling of Romania's ''[[Domnitor]]'' [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]], whom he saw as a supporter of [[industrialization]]).&lt;ref name="stahl" /&gt; He extended this criticism to [[Socialism|socialist]] groups other than his own, arguing that the prevalent [[reformism]] was "the cult of [[Legalism (Western philosophy)|legalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Pătrășcanu, in Cernea&lt;/ref&gt;

These views placed Pătrășcanu in opposition to other [[left-wing]] authors in Romania — namely, the influential [[Poporanism|Poporanists]], most of whom had emphasized various contradictions between the Marxian model and local realities, using Junimea's theory as a fundament (aside from Pătrășcanu's own father, these included his contemporary [[Virgil Madgearu]] and, to a certain degree, the Marxist [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]]).&lt;ref name="stahl" /&gt; In parallel, Pătrășcanu's theories were in sharp contrast with those held by advocates of [[economic liberalism]], and especially with [[Ștefan Zeletin]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.250-251; Stahl&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the 20th century===
As part of his reflection on post-1900 realities, Pătrășcanu contended that, relatively delayed in comparison to economies of the [[Western world]], Romania had become subject to "[[primitive accumulation of capital]]", where the role of [[colonialism]] was taken by [[Rate of exploitation|exploitation]] of the peasantry.&lt;ref name="stahl" /&gt; Like Madgearu, he appealed to the works of [[Rudolf Hilferding]], but used them as a basis to argue that foreign [[Capital (economics)|capital]] was being accumulated inside Romania, and only transferred further through a limited number of industries.&lt;ref name="stahl" /&gt; The Marxist historian [[Henri H. Stahl]] has challenged this particular thesis, calling it "highly questionable".&lt;ref name="stahl" /&gt;

While endorsing some aspects of Dobrogeanu-Gherea's theories regarding the ways in which serfdom was allegedly prolonged, in a discreet form, even after the 20th century, Pătrășcanu challenged his refusal to investigate the effects of capitalism in rural areas.&lt;ref name="stahl" /&gt; According to Pătrășcanu, the establishment of [[Leasehold estate|estate leaseholders]], which he viewed as the cause for the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|1907 revolt]] and other, more minor, peasant rebellions, was not a sign of prolonged feudalism, but one of capitalist penetration into agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.251-253; Stahl&lt;/ref&gt; Contradicting the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1927-1948)|Social Democratic]] ideologists [[Lothar Rădăceanu]] and [[Șerban Voinea]] (whom he accused of having lost contact with the [[working class]]), Pătrășcanu theorized that the Romanian [[petite bourgeoisie]] was shrinking under pressure from successful capitalists, while rejecting the notion that [[civil servant]]s belonged to the [[middle class]].&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.249&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguing in favor of a Romanian communist society during the late 1940s, Pătrășcanu indicated a series of essential steps to this goal: after discarding all legislation passed by the [[Ion Antonescu]] regime and purging the administrative apparatus, a political [[amnesty]] was to be declared, all properties upwards of 50 [[hectare]]s were to be confiscated, the [[National Bank of Romania|National Bank]] passed into state property while [[trade union]]s came under government supervision and a new [[Labour law|labour code]] was enforced, and [[civil liberties]] were enhanced.&lt;ref name="Cioroianu, p.255"&gt;Cioroianu, p.255&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, a new [[People's Republic|people's democratic]] government was to be imposed, removing all forms of [[antisemitism]] and [[chauvinism]] from public discourse and preserving good relations with the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Cioroianu, p.255"/&gt; Polemically, Pătrășcanu theorized that all these steps were "[[Liberal democracy|democratic-bourgeois]]", and not socialist in their essence.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.255-256&lt;/ref&gt;

The arguably most influential of Pătrășcanu's writings remains his analysis of the Romanian [[intelligentsia]], part of ''Probleme de bază ale României''.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.256&lt;/ref&gt; Transcending Leninist rhetoric, the work postulates a characteristic inability of Romanian [[intellectual]]s in sacrificing petty politics for the [[common good]], and argues that Romanian [[elite]]s, while in subservience to the State, have traditionally been attracted to [[extremism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.256-259, 260&lt;/ref&gt; On one instance in 1945, when theorizing about ''intellectual déclassés'', he proposed their ''neutralization and systematic supervision".&lt;ref&gt;Pătrășcanu, in Cioroianu, p.262&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu was married to Elena, born Herta Schwamen, who had a career as a stage designer (employed, with [[Lena Constante]], by the [[Țăndărică Theater]] in Bucharest). Elena, who was [[Jew]]ish, avoided the first wave of official [[Anti-semitism|anti-Semitic]] persecutions at the end of the 1930s (under the [[Octavian Goga]] government) by converting to the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] (she was [[Baptism|baptized]] by the socialist sympathiser [[Gala Galaction]]).&lt;ref&gt;Antoniu et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elena Pătrășcanu was also a party activist, and was instrumental in maintaining links between her husband and other Communist leaders during the early stages of World War II.&lt;ref name="Betea, Ambiția"/&gt; Implicated in the trial and forced to testify against Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, she was given eight years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Ionițoiu&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pătrășcanus had no children.

==In art==
[[Titus Popovici]]'s play ''Puterea și adevărul'' ("The Power and the Truth"), published in the early 1970s (staged by [[Liviu Ciulei]] and filmed, in 1971, by [[Manole Marcus]]), centers on the character Petrescu, largely based on Pătrășcanu, who is persecuted by the party secretary Pavel Stoian (a disguised reference to Gheorghiu-Dej), while living to see his hopes for a better future fulfilled by Mihai Duma (standing for Ceaușescu).&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.229-230&lt;/ref&gt; For a while after its publication, ''Puterea și adevărul'' was translated into several languages and used as official [[propaganda]] in cultural contacts with the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.229&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1993 film ''[[Oglinda|The Mirror]]'' (''Începutul adevărului'', also known as ''Oglinda''), [[Sergiu Nicolaescu]] cast [[Șerban Ionescu]] as Pătrășcanu.

'''Michael E. Bratman''' (born July 25, 1945) is an American [[philosopher]] who is Durfee Professor in the School of Humanities &amp; Sciences and Professor of Philosophy at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://philosophy.stanford.edu/people/michael-bratman|title=Michael E. Bratman - Philosophy|website=philosophy.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography and career ==

Bratman graduated from [[Haverford College]] in 1967 and earned his Ph.D. in [[philosophy]] at [[Rockefeller University]] in 1974, where he worked with [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]].  He joined the faculty at [[Stanford University]] in 1974, where he has taught ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://philosophy.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/bratman_cv_2015.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620061811/https://philosophy.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/bratman_cv_2015.pdf |archivedate=June 20, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/april/aaas-awards-list-041912.html|title=American Academy of Arts and Sciences elects nine Stanford professors to 2012 class of members|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, [[Oxford University Press]] published a collection of essays on Bratman's work by colleagues and former students, ''Rational and Social Agency:  The Philosophy of Michael Bratman.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/rational-and-social-agency-9780199794515?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Rational and Social Agency: The Philosophy of Michael Bratman|date=May 6, 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A review in ''[[Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews]]'' remarked that, "Our very understanding of what it is to form a plan or shared intention is owed in no small part to Michael Bratman's massively influential body of work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/56815-rational-and-social-agency-the-philosophy-of-michael-bratman/|title=Review of Rational and Social Agency: The Philosophy of Michael Bratman|first=Sarah K.|last=Paul|date=March 30, 2015|publisher=|via=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical work ==

His interests include [[philosophy of action]] and [[moral philosophy]].  He is best known for his development of the idea that "intention is a distinctive practical attitude marked by its pivotal role in planning for the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/intention/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Kieran|last=Setiya|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=March 30, 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His work in those areas led him to the [[Belief-Desire-Intention model]] that is used in many areas, including artificial intelligence, today.  Bratman's theory of intentions as plans has also led to a distinctive and widely discussed account of "[[collective intentionality]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/collective-intentionality/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=David P.|last1=Schweikard|first2=Hans Bernhard|last2=Schmid|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=March 30, 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5517">'''Modular constructivism''' is a style of [[sculpture]] that emerged in the 1950s and 1960s and was associated especially with [[Erwin Hauer]] and [[Norman Carlberg]]. It is based on carefully structured modules which allow for intricate and in some cases infinite patterns of repetition, sometimes used to create limitless, basically planar, screen-like formations, and sometimes employed to make more multidimensional structures. Designing these structures involves intensive study of the combinatorial possibilities of sometimes quite curvilinear and fluidly shaped modules, creating a seamless, quasi-organic unity that can be either rounded and self-enclosed, or open and potentially infinite. The latter designs have proved useful and attractive for use in eye-catching architectural walls and screens, often featuring complex patterns of undulating, tissue-like webbing, with apertures which transmit and filter light, while generating delicate patterns of shadow.

Writing in ''Architecture Week'' (August 4, 2004), Hauer explains that "Continuity and potential infinity have been at the very center of my sculpture from early on." [http://www.architectureweek.com/2004/0804/culture_2-2.html] Hauer made an extensive study of [[biomorphism|biomorphic]] form, especially what he calls "saddle surfaces," which combine convex and concave curvature and thus allow for smooth self-combination, sometimes in multiple dimensions. Another inspiration is the sculpture of [[Henry Moore]], with its fluid curves and porosity.

Hauer's enthusiasm caught the imagination of his colleague at [[Yale]], [[Norman Carlberg]]. Both were devoted students of the arch-formalist [[Josef Albers]]. Indeed, from the beginning, there was in this modular approach to sculpture an implicit [[formalism (art)|formalism]] and even [[minimalism]] which held itself aloof from some of the other artistic trends of the time, such as the [[pop art]] and [[post-modernism]] that were just beginning to emerge. As Carlberg recalls, within his artistic circle "you analysed, you looked at something, but you looked at it formally just for what it was and the message was almost always out of it."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1473">The term '''Open conference''' (or "[[openconference]]") is a derivative of the adjective "[[opensource]]", and its meaning is similarly based on the ideas of public access and community development found in the [[open source culture]] and [[OpenCourseWare]] movements.  "Conference" in this sense is used to indicate an academic or professional gathering of practitioners in a given field to present and discuss current thought, research, and practice.

An open conference is a conference that is open to the general public (usually at no cost) and encourages or requires participants to relax or eliminate [[intellectual property]] restrictions on ideas generated and presentations delivered during the conference.  Presenters often make presentations and materials available to the public for free access and use, for example through the use of a [[Creative Commons]] non-commercial attribution license.

Open conference organizers seek to open access to the conference for attendees by elimination of cost (relying on community support and sponsorships), they also provide community access to archived presentations and discussions through similar licensing agreements.

Additionally, attendees are encouraged to become participants in a collaborative community that supports and grows the conference—even to derive new  open conferences.

==Early career==
He studied physics at the [[University of Vienna]] and graduated in 1907 with a thesis in theoretical physics under the supervision of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]. [[Albert Einstein]] recommended him as his successor for a professorship at the [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universität|German Charles-Ferdinand University]] of Prague, a position which he held from 1912 until 1938.

==Emigration to the USA==
He then emigrated to the United States, where he became a lecturer of physics and mathematics at [[Harvard University]].

In 1947 he founded the Institute for the Unity of Science as part of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (AAAS). This arose after [[Howard Mumford Jones]] (then president of the AAAS) had issued a call to overcome the fractionalization of knowledge, which he felt the AAAS well suited to address. The institute held regular meetings attracting a broad range of participants. Quine regarded the organisation as a "Vienna Circle in exile".&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holton|first1=Gerald|title=Science and Anti-Science|date=1993|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomer [[Halton Arp]] described Frank's Philosophy of Science class at Harvard as being his favorite elective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/4490.html Oral History Transcript] — Dr. [[Halton Arp]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frank on Mach's principle==
In lectures given during World War II at Harvard, Frank attributed to Mach himself the following graphic expression of [[Mach's principle]]:

"When the subway jerks, it's the fixed stars that throw you down."

In commenting on this formulation of the principle, Frank pointed out that Mach chose the subway for his example because it shows that inertial effects are not shielded (by the mass of the earth): The action of distant masses on the subway-rider's mass is direct and instantaneous. It is apparent why Mach's Principle, stated in this fashion, does not fit with Einstein's conception of the retardation of all distant action.

'''Predestination''', in theology, is the doctrine that all events have been willed by [[God]], usually with reference to the eventual fate of the individual [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/predestination "Predestination", '' The American Heritage New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy'', Third Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2005. 13 Jun 2011 at Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Explanations of predestination often seek to address the "[[Argument from free will|paradox of free will]]", whereby God's [[omniscience]] seems incompatible with human [[Free will in theology|free will]]. In this usage, predestination can be regarded as a form of religious [[determinism]]; and usually [[predeterminism]].

==Christianity==

===History===

====New Testament period====
There is some disagreement among scholars regarding the views on predestination of [[Second Temple period|first-century AD Judaism]], out of which Christianity came. [[Josephus]] wrote during the first century that the three main Jewish sects differed on this question. He argued that the [[Essenes]] and [[Pharisees]] argued that God's providence orders all human events, but the Pharisees still maintained that people are able to choose between right and wrong. He wrote that the [[Sadducees]] did not have a doctrine of providence.
 
The biblical scholar [[N. T. Wright]] argues that Josephus's portrayal of these groups is incorrect, and that the Jewish debates referenced by Josephus should be seen as having to do with God's work to liberate Israel rather than philosophical questions about predestination. Wright asserts that Essenes were content to wait for God to liberate Israel while Pharisees believed Jews needed to act in cooperation with God.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=15}} [[John Barclay (theologian)|John Barclay]] responded that Josephus's description was an over-simplification and there were likely to be complex differences between these groups which may have been similar to those described by Josephus.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=16}} [[Francis Watson (theologian)|Francis Watson]] has also argued on the basis of [[4 Ezra]], a document dated to the first century AD, that Jewish beliefs in predestination are primarily concerned with God's choice to save some individual Jews.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=17}}

In the [[New Testament]], [[Letter to the Romans|Romans]] 8–11 presents a statement on predestination. In [[Romans 8]]:28–30, Paul writes, {{quote|We know that in everything God works for good with those who love him, who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the first-born among many brethren. And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=25}}}}
Biblical scholars have interpreted this passage in several ways. Many say this only has to do with service, and is not about salvation. The Catholic biblical commentator Brendan Byrne wrote that the predestination mentioned in this passage should be interpreted as applied to the Christian community corporately rather than individuals.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=29}} Another Catholic commentator, [[Joseph Fitzmyer]], wrote that this passage teaches that God has predestined the [[universal salvation|salvation of all humans]].{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=31}} [[Douglas Moo]], a Protestant biblical interpreter, reads the passage as teaching that God has predestined a certain set of people to salvation.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=32}} Similarly, Wright's interpretation is that in this passage Paul teaches that God will save those whom he has chosen, but Wright also emphasizes that Paul does not intend to suggest that God has eliminated human free will or responsibility. Instead, Wright asserts, Paul is saying that God's will works through that of humans to accomplish salvation.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=33}}

====Patristic period====
[[Origen]], writing in the third century, taught that God's providence extends to every individual.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=38}} He believed God's predestination was based on God's foreknowledge of every individual's merits, whether in their current life or a [[pre-existence|previous life]].{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=39–40}}

Later in the fourth and fifth centuries, [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430) also taught that God orders all things while preserving human freedom.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=44}} Prior to 396, Augustine believed that predestination was based on God's foreknowledge of whether individuals would believe, that God's grace was "a reward for human assent".{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=48-49}} Later, in response to [[Pelagius]], Augustine said that the sin of [[pride]] consists in assuming that "we are the ones who choose God or that God chooses us (in his foreknowledge) because of something worthy in us", and argued that it is God's grace that causes the individual act of faith.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=47–48}} Scholars are divided over whether Augustine's teaching implies [[double predestination]], or the belief that God chooses some people for damnation as well as some for salvation. Catholic scholars tend to deny that he held such a view while some Protestants and secular scholars affirm that Augustine did believe in double predestination.{{sfn|James|1998|p=102}}

Augustine's position raised objections. [[Julian of Eclanum]] expressed the view that Augustine was bringing [[Manichean]] thoughts into the church.{{sfn|Chadwick|1993|p=232}} For [[Vincent of Lérins]], this was a disturbing innovation.{{sfn|Chadwick|1993|p=233}} This new tension eventually became obvious with the confrontation between Augustine and [[Pelagius]] culminating in condemnation of [[Pelagianism]] (as interpreted by Augustine) at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431. Pelagius denied Augustine's view of predestination in order to affirm that salvation is achieved by an act of free will.

The [[Council of Arles (475)|Council of Arles]] in the late fifth century condemned the position "that some have been condemned to death, others have been predestined to life", though this may seem to follow from Augustine's teaching. The [[Second Council of Orange]] in 529 also condemned the position that "some have been truly predestined to evil by divine power".{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=37}}

In the eighth century, [[John of Damascus]] emphasized the freedom of the human will in his doctrine of predestination, and argued that acts arising from peoples' wills are not part of God's providence at all. Damascene teaches that people's good actions are done in cooperation with God, but are not caused by him.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=60}}

====Middle Ages====
[[Gottschalk of Orbais]], a ninth-century [[Saxon]] monk, argued that God predestines some people to hell as well as predestining some to heaven, a view known as double predestination. He was condemned by several synods, but his views remained popular. Irish theologian [[John Scottus Eriugena]] wrote a refutation of Gottschalk.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=70}} Eriugena abandoned Augustine's teaching on predestination.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=69}} He wrote that God's predestination should be equated with his foreknowledge of people's choices.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=74}}

In the twelfth century, [[Thomas Aquinas]] taught that God predestines certain people to the [[beatific vision]] based solely on his own goodness rather than that of creatures.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=80}} Aquinas also believed that people are free in their choices, fully cause their own sin, and are solely responsible for it.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=78}} According to Aquinas, there are several ways in which God wills actions. He directly wills the good, indirectly wills evil consequences of good things, and only permits evil. Aquinas held that in permitting evil, God does not will it to be done or not to be done.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=78–79}}

In the thirteenth century, [[William of Ockham]] taught that God does not cause human choices and equated predestination with divine foreknowledge.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=88}} Though Ockham taught that God predestines based on people's foreseen works, he maintained that God's will was not constrained to do this.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=89}}

====Reformation====
[[John Calvin]] rejected the idea that God permits rather than actively decrees the damnation of sinners, as well as other evil.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=102}} Calvin did not believe God to be guilty of sin, but he considered it an unfathomable mystery that God seems to simultaneously will sin and to also not will sin.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=104}} Though he maintained God's predestination applies to damnation as well as salvation, he taught that the damnation of the damned is caused by their sin, but that the salvation of the saved is solely caused by God.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=105–106}} Other [[Protestant Reformers]], including [[Huldrych Zwingli]], also held double predestinarian views.{{sfnm|James|1998|1p=30|Trueman|1994|2p=69}}

===Views of Christian branches===

====Eastern Orthodoxy====
The [[Eastern Orthodox]] view was summarized by Bishop [[Theophan the Recluse]] in response to the question, "What is the relationship between the Divine provision and our free will?"
{{quote|Answer: The fact that the Kingdom of God is "taken by force" presupposes personal effort. When the Apostle Paul says, "it is not of him that willeth," this means that one's efforts do not produce what is sought. It is necessary to combine them: to strive ''and'' to expect all things from grace. It is not one's own efforts that will lead to the goal, because without grace, efforts produce little; nor does grace without effort bring what is sought, because grace acts in us and for us ''through'' our efforts. Both combine in a person to bring progress and carry him to the goal. (God's) foreknowledge is unfathomable. It is enough for us with our whole heart to believe that it never opposes God's grace and truth, and that it does not infringe man's freedom. Usually this resolves as follows: God foresees how a man will freely act and makes dispositions accordingly. Divine determination depends on the life of a man, and not his life upon the determination.&lt;ref&gt;St. Theophan the Recluse, ''An Explanation of Certain Texts of Holy Scripture'', as quoted in Johanna Manley's ''The Bible and the Holy Fathers for Orthodox: Daily Scripture Readings and Commentary for Orthodox Christians'', pg. 609.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Catholicism====
[[File:The Last Judgement - Stefan Lochner - Wallraf-Richartz Museum - Cologne - Germany 2017.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Stefan Lochner]], ''[[Last Judgement (Lochner)|Last Judgement]]'', c. 1435. [[Wallraf-Richartz Museum]], Cologne]]
Catholicism teaches the doctrine of predestination, while rejecting the classical Calvinist view known as "double predestination". This means that while it is held that those whom God has elected to eternal life will infallibly attain it, and are therefore said to be predestined to salvation by God, those who perish are not predestined to damnation. According to the Catholic Church, God predestines no one to go to hell, for this, a willful turning away from God (a mortal sin) is necessary, and persistence in it until the end."&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 1037&lt;/ref&gt; Catholicism has been generally discouraging to human attempts to guess or predict the Divine Will. The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' entry on predestination says:&lt;ref&gt;[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] entry on [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12378a.htm entry on Predestination]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|God, owing to His infallible prescience of the future, has appointed and ordained from eternity all events occurring in time, especially those that directly proceed from, or at least are influenced by, man's free will.}} The heretical seventeenth and eighteenth centuries sect within Roman Catholicism known as [[Jansenism]] preached the doctrine of double predestination, although Jansenism claimed that even members of the saved elect could lose their salvation by doing sinful, un-repented deeds, as implied in Ezekiel 18:21–28 in the Old Testament of the Bible.

[[Pope John Paul II]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;the [[encyclical]] ''[[Redemptoris Missio]]'', chapter 1, section 10&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The universality of salvation means that it is granted not only to those who explicitly believe in Christ and have entered the Church. Since salvation is offered to all, it must be made concretely available to all.

Grace comes from Christ; it is the result of his Sacrifice and is communicated by the Holy Spirit. It enables each person to attain salvation through his or her free cooperation.}}

The [[Catholic Catechism]] says, "To God, all moments of time are present in their immediacy. When therefore he establishes his eternal plan of "predestination", he includes in it each person's free response to his grace."&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 600&lt;/ref&gt; 

Catholics do not believe that any hints or evidence of the predestined status of individuals is available to humans, and predestination generally plays little or no part in Catholic teaching to the faithful, being a topic addressed in a professional theological context only.

[[Augustine of Hippo]] laid the foundation for much of the later Catholic teaching on predestination. His teachings on grace and free will were largely adopted by the Second Council of Orange (529), whose decrees were directed against the Semipelagians. Augustine wrote, 
{{quote|[God] promised not from the power of our will but from His own predestination. For He promised what He Himself would do, not what men would do. Because, although men do those good things which pertain to God’s worship, He Himself makes them to do what He has commanded; it is not they that cause Him to do what He has promised. Otherwise the fulfilment of God’s promises would not be in the power of God, but in that of men"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Augustine of Hippo|title=In What Respects Predestination and Grace Differ.|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf105.xxi.ii.xix.html|work=Anti Pelagian Writings|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Augustine also teaches that people have free will. For example, in "On Grace and Free Will", (see especially chapters II–IV) Augustine states that "He [God] has revealed to us, through His Holy Scriptures, that there is in man a free choice of will," and that "God's precepts themselves would be of no use to a man unless he had free choice of will, so that by performing them he might obtain the promised rewards." (chap. II)

[[Thomas Aquinas]]' views concerning predestination are largely in agreement with Augustine and can be summarized by many of his writings in his ''[[Summa Theologiæ]]'':
{{quote|God does reprobate some. For it was said above (A[1]) that predestination is a part of providence. To providence, however, it belongs to permit certain defects in those things which are subject to providence, as was said above (Q[22], A[2]). Thus, as men are ordained to eternal life through the providence of God, it likewise is part of that providence to permit some to fall away from that end; this is called reprobation. Thus, as predestination is a part of providence, in regard to those ordained to eternal salvation, so reprobation is a part of providence in regard to those who turn aside from that end. Hence reprobation implies not only foreknowledge, but also something more, as does providence, as was said above (Q[22], A[1]). Therefore, as predestination includes the will to confer grace and glory; so also reprobation includes the will to permit a person to fall into sin, and to impose the punishment of damnation on account of that sin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Whether God Reprobates any Man|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.FP_Q23_A3.html|work=Summa Theologica|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=====Lutheranism=====
[[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] historically hold to unconditional election unto salvation. However, some do not believe that there are certain people that are predestined to salvation, but salvation is predestined for those who seek God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013:48;&amp;version=9; Acts 13:48], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Eph.%201:4-11;&amp;version=47; Eph. 1:4–11], [http://www.bookofconcord.com/fc-ep.html#XI.%20Election.

"The Election of Grace", paragraph 176.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans believe Christians should be assured that they are among the predestined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Thessalonians%202:13;&amp;version=50; 2 Thess. 2:13], Mueller, J.T., &lt;cite&gt;Christian Dogmatics&lt;/cite&gt;. St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1934. pp. 589–593, section "The Doctrine of Eternal Election: 2.

St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1934. pp. 127–8, Part XXXI. "The Election of Grace", paragraph 180.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, they disagree with those who make predestination the source of salvation rather than Christ's suffering, death, and resurrection. Unlike some [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], Lutherans do not believe in a predestination to damnation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Tim.%202:4;&amp;version=31; 1 Tim. 2:4], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Pet.%203:9;&amp;version=31; 2 Pet. 3:9], [http://www.bookofconcord.com/fc-ep.html#XI.%20Election.

The Election of Grace, pp. 124–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Lutherans teach eternal damnation is a result of the unbeliever's sins, rejection of the forgiveness of sins, and unbelief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea%2013:9;&amp;version=9; Hos. 13:9], Mueller, J.T., &lt;cite&gt;Christian Dogmatics&lt;/cite&gt;.

"Eternal Damnation", and Engelder, T.E.W., &lt;cite&gt;[https://archive.org/details/MN41551ucmf_1 Popular Symbolics]. St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1934. pp. 135–6, Part XXXIX. "Eternal Death", paragraph 196.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]]'s attitude towards predestination is set out in his ''[[On the Bondage of the Will]]'', published in 1525. This publication by Luther was in response to the published treatise by [[Desiderius Erasmus]] in 1524 known as ''[[De libero arbitrio diatribe sive collatio|On Free Will]]''. Luther based his views on [[Ephesians 2]]:8–10, which says:
{{quote|For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.}}

=====Calvinism=====
{{main|Predestination in Calvinism}}
The [[Belgic Confession]] of 1561 affirmed that God "delivers and preserves" from perdition "all whom he, in his eternal and unchangeable council, of mere goodness hath elected in Christ Jesus our Lord, without respect to their works" (Article XVI).
Calvinists believe that [[Christianity|God]] picked those who he will save and bring with him to [[Heaven]] before the world was created. They also believe that those people God does not save will go to [[Hell]]. John Calvin thought people who were saved could never lose their salvation and the "[[Election (Christianity)|elect]]" (those God saved) would know they were saved because of their actions.

In this common, loose sense of the term, to affirm or to deny predestination has particular reference to the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] doctrine of [[unconditional election]]. In the Calvinist interpretation of the Bible, this doctrine normally has only pastoral value related to the assurance of salvation and the absolution of salvation by grace alone. However, the philosophical implications of the doctrine of election and predestination are sometimes discussed beyond these systematic bounds. Under the topic of the doctrine of God (theology proper), the predestinating decision of God cannot be contingent upon anything outside of himself, because all other things are dependent upon him for existence and meaning. Under the topic of the doctrines of salvation (soteriology), the predestinating decision of God is made from God's knowledge of his own will (Romans 9:15), and is therefore not contingent upon human decisions (rather, free human decisions are outworkings of the decision of God, which sets the total reality within which those decisions are made in exhaustive detail: that is, nothing left to chance). Calvinists do not pretend to understand how this works; but they are insistent that the Scriptures teach both the [[Sovereignty of God in Christianity|sovereign control]] of God and the responsibility and freedom of human decisions.

Calvinist groups use the term [[Hyper-Calvinism]] to describe Calvinistic systems that assert without qualification that God's intention to destroy some is equal to his intention to save others. Some forms of Hyper-Calvinism have racial implications, as when Dutch Calvinist theologian [[Franciscus Gomarus]] however argued that Jews, because of their refusal to worship Jesus Christ, were members of the non-elect, as also argued by [[John Calvin]] himself, based on I John 2:22–23 in The New Testament of the Bible. Some Dutch settlers in South Africa argued that black people were sons of Ham, whom Noah had [[Curse of Ham|cursed to be slaves]], according to Genesis 9:18–19, or drew analogies between them and the Canaanites, suggesting a "chosen people" ideology similar to that espoused by proponents of the [[Jews as the chosen people|Jewish nation]]. This justified racial hierarchy on earth, as well as racial segregation of congregations, but did not exclude blacks from being part of the elect. Other Calvinists vigorously objected to these arguments (see [[Afrikaner Calvinism]]). 

Expressed sympathetically, the [[Calvinist]] doctrine is that God has mercy or withholds it, with particular consciousness of who are to be the recipients of mercy in Christ. Therefore, the particular persons are chosen, out of the total number of human beings, who will be rescued from enslavement to sin and the fear of death, and from punishment due to sin, to dwell forever in his presence. Those who are being saved are assured through the gifts of faith, the sacraments, and communion with God through prayer and increase of good works, that their reconciliation with him through Christ is settled by the sovereign determination of God's will. God also has particular consciousness of those who are passed over by his selection, who are without excuse for their rebellion against him, and will be judged for their sins.

Calvinists typically divide on the issue of predestination into [[infralapsarianism|infralapsarians]] (sometimes called 'sublapsarians') and [[supralapsarianism|supralapsarians]]. Infralapsarians interpret the biblical election of God to highlight his love (1 John 4:8; Ephesians 1:4b–5a) and chose his elect considering the situation after the Fall, while supralapsarians interpret biblical election to highlight God's sovereignty (Romans 9:16) and that the Fall was ordained by God's decree of election. In infralapsarianism, election is God's response to the Fall, while in supralapsarianism the Fall is part of God's plan for election. In spite of the division, many Calvinist theologians would consider the debate surrounding the infra- and supralapsarian positions one in which scant Scriptural evidence can be mustered in either direction, and that, at any rate, has little effect on the overall doctrine.

Some Calvinists decline to describe the eternal decree of God in terms of a sequence of events or thoughts, and many caution against the simplifications involved in describing any action of God in speculative terms. Most make distinctions between the positive manner in which God chooses some to be recipients of grace, and the manner in which grace is consciously withheld so that some are destined for everlasting punishments.

Debate concerning predestination according to the common usage concerns the destiny of the damned: whether God is just if that destiny is settled prior to the existence of any actual volition of the individual, and whether the individual is in any meaningful sense responsible for his destiny if it is settled by the eternal action of God.

=====Arminianism=====
{{Main|Corporate election}}
[[Arminianism|Arminians]] hold that God does not predetermine, but instead infallibly knows who will believe and perseveringly be saved. This view is known as [[conditional election]], because it states that election is conditional on the one who wills to have faith in God for salvation. Although God knows from the beginning of the world who will go where, the choice is still with the individual. The Dutch Calvinist theologian Franciscus Gomarus strongly opposed the views of Jacobus Arminius with his doctrine of supralapsarian predestination.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) rejects the doctrine of predestination, but does believe in [[foreordination]]. Foreordination, an important [[Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|doctrine]] of the LDS Church,&lt;ref name="GT: Foreordination"&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.lds.org/topics/foreordination?lang=eng |title= Gospel Topics: Foreordination |work= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141207153038/https://www.lds.org/topics/foreordination?lang=eng |archive-date= 2014-12-07 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McConkie May 1974"&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://www.lds.org/ensign/1974/05/god-foreordains-his-prophets-and-his-people?lang=eng |title= God Foreordains His Prophets and His People |first= Bruce R. |last= McConkie |authorlink= Bruce R.

For example, [[prophets]] were foreordained to be the Lord's servants (see Jeremiah 1:5), all who receive the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] were foreordained to that calling, and Jesus was foreordained to enact the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]].

The LDS Church teaches the doctrine of moral [[Agency (LDS Church)|agency]], the ability to choose and act for ourselves, and decide whether to accept Christ's atonement.&lt;ref name="lds2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/topics/agency?lang=eng|title=Agency|publisher=lds.org|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of predestination===

====Conditional election====
[[Conditional election]] is the belief that [[God in Christianity|God]] chooses for eternal [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] those whom he foresees will have [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] in [[Christ]]. This belief emphasizes the importance of a person's [[free will]]. The counter-view is known as [[unconditional election]], and is the belief that God chooses whomever he will, based solely on his purposes and apart from an individual's free will. It has long been an issue in [[History of the Calvinist–Arminian debate|Calvinist–Arminian debate]]. An alternative viewpoint is [[Corporate election]], which distinguishes God's election and predestination for corporate entities such as the community "in Christ," and individuals who can benefit from that community's election and predestination so long as they continue belonging to that community.

====Supralapsarianism and infralapsarianism====
[[Supralapsarianism and infralapsarianism|Infralapsarianism]] (also called sublapsarianism) holds that predestination logically coincides with the preordination of Man's fall into sin. That is, God predestined sinful men for salvation. Therefore, according to this view, God is the [[proximate and ultimate causation|ultimate cause]], but not the proximate source or "author" of sin. Infralapsarians often emphasize a difference between God's decree (which is inviolable and inscrutable), and his revealed will (against which man is disobedient). Proponents also typically emphasize the grace and mercy of God toward all men, although teaching also that only some are predestined for salvation.

In common English parlance, the doctrine of predestination often has particular reference to the doctrines of [[Calvinism]]. The version of predestination espoused by [[John Calvin]], after whom Calvinism is named, is sometimes referred to as "double predestination" because in it God predestines some people for salvation (i.e. [[unconditional election]]) and some for condemnation (i.e. [[Reprobation]]) which results by allowing the individual's own sins to condemn them. Calvin himself defines predestination as "the eternal decree of God, by which he determined with himself whatever he wished to happen with regard to every man. Not all are created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation; and, accordingly, as each has been created for one or other of these ends, we say that he has been predestined to life or to death."&lt;ref name=Calvin&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.iv.iii.xxii.html |title=Calvin, John. ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', (Henry Beveridge, trans.), III.21.5 |access-date=21 June 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829234225/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.iv.iii.xxii.html |archive-date=29 August 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the spectrum of beliefs concerning predestination, Calvinism is the strongest form among Christians. It teaches that God's predestining decision is based on the knowledge of his own will rather than foreknowledge, concerning every particular person and event; and, God continually acts with entire freedom, in order to bring about his will in completeness, but in such a way that the freedom of the creature is not violated, "but rather, established".&lt;ref name="WCF3"&gt;[[s:Westminster Confession of Faith#CHAPTER III. Of God's Eternal Decree.|Westminster Confession of faith, Ch 3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvinists who hold the infralapsarian view of predestination usually prefer that term to "sublapsarianism," perhaps with the intent of blocking the inference that they believe predestination is on the basis of foreknowledge (''sublapsarian'' meaning, assuming the fall into sin).&lt;ref&gt;Here, sub- is opposed to super- or supra- in a sense related to volition and/or necessity. Cf., for relapse of same origin, http://freedictionary.org/index.php?Query=relapse&amp;database=%2A&amp;strategy=exact : L. relapsus, p. p. of relabi to slip back, to relapse.&lt;/ref&gt; The different terminology has the benefit of distinguishing the Calvinist double predestination version of infralapsarianism from Lutheranism's view that predestination is a mystery, which forbids the unprofitable intrusion of prying minds since God only reveals partial knowledge to the human race.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

[[Supralapsarianism and infralapsarianism|Supralapsarianism]] is the doctrine that God's decree of predestination for salvation and reprobation logically precedes his preordination of the human race's fall into sin. That is, God decided to save, and to damn; he then determined the means by which that would be made possible. It is a matter of controversy whether or not Calvin himself held this view, but most scholars link him with the infralapsarian position. It is known, however, that Calvin's successor in Geneva, [[Theodore Beza]], held to the supralapsarian view.

====Double predestination====
Double predestination, or the double decree, is the doctrine that God actively [[reprobates]], or decrees damnation of some, as well as salvation for those whom he has elected. Augustine made statements that on their own seem to teach such a doctrine, but in the context of his other writings it is not clear whether he held it. Augustine's doctrine of predestination does seem to imply a double predestinarian view.{{sfn|James|1998|p=102}} Gottschalk of Orbais taught it more explicitly in the ninth century,{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=70}} and [[Gregory of Rimini]] in the fourteenth.{{sfn|James|1998|p=147}} During the Protestant Reformation John Calvin also held double predestinarian views.{{sfn|James|1998|p=30}}{{sfn|Trueman|1994|p=69}} John Calvin states: "By predestination we mean the eternal decree of God, by which he determined with himself whatever he wished to happen with regard to every man. All are not created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation; and, accordingly, as each has been created for one or other of these ends, we say that '''he has been predestinated to life or to death'''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calvin|first1=John|title=Institutes of Christian Religion|location=Book Three, Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Open theism====
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
[[Open theism]] advocates the non-traditional Arminian view of election that predestination is corporate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Brian Abasciano |title=The FACTS of Salvation: A Summary of Arminian Theology/the Biblical Doctrines of Grace |date=25 October 2013 |url=http://evangelicalarminians.org/the-facts-of-salvation-a-summary-of-arminian-theologythe-biblical-doctrines-of-grace/ |publisher=Society of Evengelical Arminians|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[corporate election]], God does not choose which individuals he will save prior to creation, but rather God chooses the church as a whole. Or put differently, God chooses what type of individuals he will save. Another way the New Testament puts this is to say that God chose the church in Christ (Eph. 1:4). In other words, God chose from all eternity to save all those who would be found in Christ, by faith in God. This choosing is not primarily about salvation from eternal destruction either but is about God's chosen agency in the world. Thus individuals have full freedom in terms of whether they become members of the church or not. Corporate election is thus consistent with the open view's position on God's omniscience, which states that God's foreknowledge does not determine the outcomes of individual free will.

====Middle Knowledge====
[[Middle knowledge|Middle Knowledge]] is a concept that was developed by [[Jesuit]] theologian [[Luis de Molina]], and exists under a doctrine called [[Molinism]]. It attempts to deal with the topic of predestination by reconciling Gods sovereign providence with the notion of [[libertarian free will]]. The concept of Middle Knowledge holds that God has a knowledge of true pre-volitional [[counterfactuals]] for all free creatures. That is, what any individual creature with a free will (e.g. a human) would do under any given circumstance. Gods knowledge of counterfactuals is reasoned to occur logically prior to his divine creative decree (that is, prior to creation), and after his knowledge of [[Logical truth|necessary truths]]. Thus, Middle Knowledge holds that before the world was created, God knew what every existing creature capable of libertarian freedom (e.g. every individual human) would freely choose to do in all possible circumstances. It then holds that based on this information, God elected from a number of these [[Possible world|possible worlds]], the world most consistent with his ultimate will, which is the actual world that we live in.

For example:

* if Free Creature A was to be placed in Circumstance B, God via his Middle Knowledge would know that Free Creature A will freely choose option Y over option Z.
* if Free Creature A was to be placed in Circumstance C, God via his Middle Knowledge would know that Free Creature A will freely choose option Z over option Y. 

Based on this Middle Knowledge, God has the ability to actualise the world in which A is placed in a circumstance that he freely chooses to do what is consistent with Gods ultimate will. If God determined that the world most suited to his purposes is a world in which A would freely choose Y instead of Z, God can actualise a world in which Free Creature A finds himself in Circumstance B.

In this way, Middle Knowledge is thought of by its proponents to be consistent with any theological doctrines that assert God as having divine providence and man having a libertarian freedom (e.g. Calvinism, Catholicism, Lutheranism), and to offer a potential solution to the concerns that Gods providence somehow nullifies man from having true liberty in his choices.

==Islam==
{{Main|Predestination in Islam}}
''Qadar'' ({{lang-ar|قدر}}, [[Hans Wehr transliteration|transliterated]] ''qadar'', meaning "fate", "divine fore-ordainment", "predestination")&lt;ref name="Wehr"&gt;J. M. Cowan (ed.) (1976). ''The Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic''. Wiesbaden, Germany: Spoken Language Services. {{ISBN|0-87950-001-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the concept of [[Divinity|divine]] [[destiny]] in [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionislam.com/knowledge/Qadar.htm|title=Qadar|work=missionislam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of Sunni Islam's [[Iman (concept)|six pillars of faith]], along with belief in the [[Tawhid|Oneness of God]], the [[Islamic holy books|Revealed Books]], the [[Prophets of Islam]], the [[Islamic eschatology|Day of Resurrection]] and [[Angels in Islam|Angels]].

In Islam, "predestination" is the usual English language rendering of a belief that Muslims call ''al-qada wa al-qadar'' in Arabic. The phrase means "the divine decree and the predestination". In Islam, God has predetermined, known, ordained, and is constantly creating every event that takes place in the world. This is entailed by his being omnipotent and omniscient. Sunni scholars hold that there is no contradiction in people's deeds (and naturally their choices) being created and predetermined by the creator, since they define free will to be the antonym of compulsion and coercion. People – in the Sunni perspective – do acknowledge that they are free, since they do not see anybody or anything forcing them to do whatever they chose to do. This, however, does not contradict that everything they do, including the choices they make, are predestined and predetermined by God. Consequently, people are already predestined to either heaven or hell at birth, as Sunnis believe; however, they will have no argument on the day of judgment since they never knew in advance what their fate would be, and they do acknowledge that they have choice; which is what moral responsibility comes with.&lt;ref name="eltwhed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltwhed.com/vb/showthread.php?28233-%C7%E1%CC%E6%C7%C8-%DD%ED-%E3%D3%C3%E1%C9-%C7%E1%DE%CF%D1-%E6%D4%C8%E5%C9-%C7%E1%CC%C8%D1-%E6%C7%E1%C7%CE%CA%ED%C7%D1|title=الجواب في مسألة القدر وشبهة الجبر والاختيار.|publisher=eltwhed.com|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of human will being predetermined by God's will is stated clearly in the Quran:
"Verily this (The Holy Quran) is no less than a Message to (all) the Worlds; (With profit) to whoever among you wills to go straight, ''but ye shall not will except as God wills;'' the Cherisher of the Worlds."&lt;ref&gt;[http://quran.al-islam.com/Page.aspx?pageid=221&amp;BookID=15&amp;SuraNum=81&amp;AyaNum=29 The Koran; Section 81, Verses 27-29]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="islam-qa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islam-qa.com/index.php?ref=96978&amp;ln=eng|title=موقع الإسلام سؤال وجواب - عربي - islamqa.info|publisher=islam-qa.com|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predestination is rejected in Shiaism.&lt;ref&gt;Need of Religion, by Sayyid Sa'id Akhtar Rizvi, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{See also|Free will in theology#In Jewish thought}}
In [[Rabbinic literature]], there is much discussion as to the apparent [[contradiction]] between God's omniscience and free will. The representative view is that "Everything is foreseen; yet free will is given" ([[Rabbi Akiva]], ''[[Pirkei Avoth]]'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20060830203834/http://sichosinenglish.org/books/ethics/03-15.htm 3:15]). Based on this understanding, the problem is formally described as a [[paradox]], perhaps beyond our understanding.

[[Hasdai Crescas]] resolved this dialectical tension by taking the position that free will doesn't exist. All of a person's actions are predetermined by the moment of their birth, and thus their judgment in the eyes of God (so to speak) is effectively preordained. In this scheme this is not a result of God's predetermining one's fate, but rather that the universe is deterministic. Crescas's views on this topic were rejected by Judaism at large. In later centuries this idea independently developed among some in the [[Chabad]] (Lubavitch) movement of [[Hasidic Judaism]]. Many individuals within Chabad take this view seriously, and hence effectively deny the existence of free will.&lt;ref name="Apologetics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abasciano|first1=Brian|title=The FACTS of Salvation: A Summary of Arminian Theology/the Biblical Doctrines of Grace|journal=Society of Evangelical Arminians|issue=The Facts of Salvation|url=http://evangelicalarminians.org/the-facts-of-salvation-a-summary-of-arminian-theologythe-biblical-doctrines-of-grace/|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many Chabad (Lubavitch) Jews attempt to hold both views. They affirm as infallible their [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson|rebbe]]'s teachings that God knows and controls the fate of all, yet at the same time affirm the classical Jewish belief in free will. The inherent contradiction between the two results in their belief that such contradictions are only "apparent", due to man's inherent lack of ability to understand greater truths and due to the fact that Creator and Created exist in different realities. The same idea is strongly repeated by [[Rambam]] ([[Mishneh Torah]], Laws of Repentance, Chapter 5).

Many other Jews (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and secular) affirm that since free will exists, then by definition one's fate is not preordained. It is held as a tenet of faith that whether God is omniscient or not, nothing interferes with mankind's free will. Some Jewish theologians, both during the medieval era and today, have attempted to formulate a philosophy in which free will is preserved, while also affirming that God has knowledge of what decisions people will make in the future. Whether or not these two ideas are mutually compatible, or whether there is a contradiction between the two, is still a matter of great study and interest in [[philosophy]] today.

==Zoroastrianism==
Predestination is rejected in [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=201 Billion Galaxies: And Other Religious Discoveries|date=2012|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=9781466962187|page=301|author=Nicholas Campbell Corff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Olsen|first=Brad|title=Modern Esoteric: Beyond Our Senses|date=1 Mar 2014|publisher=CCC Publishing|isbn=9781888729504|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans bear responsibility for all situations they are in, and in the way they act toward one another.

'''Primordial black holes''' are a hypothetical type of [[black hole]] that formed soon after the [[Big Bang]]. In the early universe, high densities and inhomogeneous conditions could lead sufficiently dense regions to undergo gravitational collapse, forming black holes.

Since primordial black holes did not form from stellar [[gravitational collapse]], their masses can be far below stellar mass (c. {{val|2|e=30|u=kg}}). Hawking calculated that primordial black holes could weigh as little as {{val|e=−8|u=kg}}, about the weight of a human ovum.&lt;!--

NOTE: this seems out of place. Several mechanisms have been proposed to produce the inhomogeneities at the origin of primordial black hole formation—such as that of [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]], reheating, or [[phase transition]]s. --&gt;

== Theoretical history ==

Depending on the model, primordial black holes could have initial masses ranging from {{val|e=−8|u=kg}} (the so-called Planck relics) to more than thousands of solar masses. However, primordial black holes with a mass lower than {{val|e=11|u=kg}} would have evaporated due to [[Hawking radiation]] in a time much shorter than the age of the Universe, so they cannot have survived until the present Universe. A noticeable exception is the case of Planck relics that could eventually be stable.{{Clarify|date=April 2018}} The abundance of primordial black holes could be as important as the one of [[dark matter]], to which they are a plausible candidate.  Primordial black holes are also good candidates for being the seeds of the [[supermassive black hole]]s at the center of massive galaxies, as well as of [[intermediate-mass black hole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Clesse |first=S. |last2=Garcia-Bellido |first2=J. |year=2015

Primordial black holes belong to the class of [[massive compact halo object]]s (MACHOs). They are naturally a good dark matter candidate: they are (nearly) collision-less and stable (if sufficiently massive), they have non-relativistic velocities, and they form very early in the history of the Universe (typically less than one second after the [[Big Bang]]). Nevertheless, tight limits on their abundances have been set up from various astrophysical and cosmological observations, so that it is now excluded that they contribute importantly to the dark matter over most of the plausible mass range.

In March 2016, one month after the announcement of the detection by Advanced [[LIGO]]/[[Virgo interferometer|VIRGO]] of gravitational waves emitted by the merging of two 30 solar mass black holes (about {{val|6|e=31|u=kg}}), three groups of researchers proposed independently that the detected black holes had a primordial origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bird |first=S. |last2=Cholis |first2=I. |year=2016 |title=Did LIGO Detect Dark Matter? |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=116 |issue=20 |pages=201301 |arxiv=  1603.00464|bibcode= 2016PhRvL.116t1301B|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.201301|pmid=27258861 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clesse |first=S. |last2=Garcia-Bellido |first2=J. |year=2017 |title=The clustering of massive Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter: Measuring their mass distribution with Advanced LIGO |journal=[[Physics of the Dark Universe]] |volume=10 |issue=2016 |pages=142–147 |arxiv=1603.05234 |bibcode= 2017PDU....15..142C|doi=10.1016/j.dark.2016.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sasaki |first=M. |last2=Suyama |first2=T. |last3=Tanaki |first3=T. |year=2016 |title=Primordial Black Hole Scenario for the Gravitational-Wave Event GW150914 |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=117 |issue=6 |pages=061101 |arxiv=1603.08338 |bibcode= 2016PhRvL.117f1101S|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.061101 |pmid=27541453 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]] | title=Did Gravitational Wave Detector Find Dark Matter? | date=June 15, 2016 | url=http://releases.jhu.edu/2016/06/15/did-gravitational-wave-detector-find-dark-matter/ | access-date=June 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of them found that the merging rates inferred by LIGO are consistent with a scenario in which all the dark matter is made of primordial black holes, if a non-negligible fraction of them are somehow clustered within halos such as faint [[Dwarf spheroidal galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] or [[globular cluster]]s, as expected by the standard theory of cosmic [[structure formation]]. The third group claimed that these merging rates are incompatible with an all-dark-matter scenario and that primordial black holes could only contribute to less than one percent of the total dark matter. The unexpected large mass of the black holes detected by LIGO has strongly revived the interest for primordial black holes with masses in the range of 1 to 100 solar masses. It is however still unclear and debated whether this range is excluded or not by other observations, such as the absence of micro-lensing of stars, the [[cosmic microwave background]] anisotropies, the size of faint dwarf galaxies, and the absence of correlation between X-ray and radio sources towards the galactic center.

In May 2016, Alexander Kashlinsky suggested that the observed spatial correlations in the unresolved gamma-ray and X-ray background radiations could be due to primordial black holes with similar masses, if their abundance is comparable to the one of dark matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kashlinsky |first=A. |year=2016 |title=LIGO gravitational wave detection, primordial black holes and the near-IR cosmic infrared background anisotropies |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=823 |issue=2 |pages=L25 |arxiv=1605.04023 |bibcode= 2016ApJ...823L..25K|doi=10.3847/2041-8205/823/2/L25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==

Primordial black holes could have formed in the very early Universe (less than one second after the Big-Bang), during the so-called ''radiation dominated era''. The essential ingredient for a primordial black hole to form is a fluctuation in the density of the Universe, inducing its gravitational collapse. One typically requires density contrasts &lt;math&gt; \delta \rho / \rho \sim 0.1 &lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the Universe) to form a black hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Harada |first=T. |last2=Yoo |first2=C.-M. |last3=Khori |first3=K. |year=2013 |title=Threshold of primordial black hole formation |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=88 |issue=8 |pages=084051 |arxiv=1309.4201 |bibcode= 2013PhRvD..88h4051H|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.88.084051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several mechanisms able to produce such inhomogeneities in the context of cosmic inflation (in hybrid inflation models, for example axion inflation), reheating, or cosmological phase transitions.

== Observational limits and detection strategies ==

A variety of observations have been interpreted to place limits on the abundance and mass of primordial black holes:

* ''Lifetime, Hawking radiation and gamma-rays:''  One way to detect primordial black holes, or to constrain their mass and abundance, is by their [[Hawking radiation]].  [[Stephen Hawking]] theorized in 1974 that large numbers of such smaller primordial black holes might exist in the [[Milky Way]] in our [[galaxy]]'s [[Galactic halo|halo]] region. All black holes are theorized to emit Hawking radiation at a rate inversely proportional to their mass. Since this emission further decreases their mass, black holes with very small mass would experience runaway evaporation, creating a massive burst of radiation at the final phase, equivalent to a hydrogen bomb yielding millions of megatons of explosive force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawking | first1 = S.W. | year = 1977 | title = The quantum mechanics of black holes | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 236 | issue = | pages = 34–40 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0177-34|bibcode = 1977SciAm.236a..34H }}&lt;/ref&gt; A regular black hole (of about 3 [[solar mass]]es) cannot lose all of its mass within the current age of the universe (they would take about 10&lt;sup&gt;69&lt;/sup&gt; years to do so, even without any matter falling in). However, since primordial black holes are not formed by stellar core collapse, they may be of any size. A black hole with a mass of about 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; kg would have a lifetime about equal to the age of the universe. If such low-mass black holes were created in sufficient number in the Big Bang, we should be able to observe some of those that are relatively nearby in our own [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]] exploding today.  [[NASA]]'s [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] satellite, launched in June 2008, was designed in part to search for such evaporating primordial black holes.  Fermi data set up the limit that less than one percent of dark matter could be made of primordial black holes with masses up to 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; kg.   Evaporating primordial black holes would have also an impact on the Big Bang nucleosynthesis and change the abundances of light elements in the Universe.  However, if theoretical Hawking radiation does not actually exist, such primordial black holes would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to detect in space due to their small size and lack of large gravitational influence.
* ''Lensing of gamma-ray bursts:''  Compact objects can induce a change in the luminosity of [[gamma-ray burst]]s when passing close to their line-of-sight, through the [[gravitational lens]]ing effect.   The Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor experiment found that primordial black holes cannot contribute importantly to the dark matter within the mass range 5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; – 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=A. |last=Barnacka  |first2=J. |last2=Glicenstein |first3=R. |last3=Moderski |arxiv=1204.2056 |title=New constraints on primordial black holes abundance from femtolensing of gamma-ray bursts  |journal=Physical Review D  |volume=86  |issue=4  |pages=043001  |year=2012  |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.86.043001  |bibcode=2012PhRvD..86d3001B  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Capture of primordial black holes by neutron stars:''  If primordial black holes with masses between 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; kg and 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; kg had abundances comparable to the one of dark matter, [[neutron star]]s in [[globular cluster]]s should have captured some of them, which leads to the rapid destruction of the star.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Capela |first=Fabio |last2=Pshirkov |first2=Maxim |last3=Tinyakov |first3=Peter |title=Constraints on primordial black holes as dark matter candidates from capture by neutron stars |journal=Physical Review D |volume=87 |issue=12 |pages=123524 |arxiv=1301.4984|year=2013 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.87.123524 |bibcode=2013PhRvD..87l3524C }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The observation of neutron stars in globular clusters can thus be used to set a limit on primordial black holes abundances.
*  ''Micro-lensing of stars:''  If a primordial black hole passes between us and a distant stars, it induces a magnification of these stars due to the [[gravitational lens]]ing effect.  By monitoring the magnitude of stars in the [[Magellanic Clouds]], the EROS and MACHO surveys have put a limit on the abundance of primordial black holes in the range 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; – 10&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; kg.  According to these surveys, primordial black holes within this range cannot constitute an important fraction of the dark matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=astro-ph/0607207|last1= Tisserand|first1= P.|title= Limits on the Macho Content of the Galactic Halo from the EROS-2 Survey   of the Magellanic Clouds|journal= Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume= 469|issue= 2|pages= 387–404|last2=  Le Guillou|first2= L.|last3=  Afonso|first3= C.|last4=  Albert|first4= J.

*  ''Temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background:''  Accretion of matter onto primordial black holes in the early Universe should lead to energy injection in the medium that affects the [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] history of the Universe.  This effect induces signatures in the statistical distribution of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background|cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) anisotropies.

It is still debated whether the constraints are stronger or weaker in more realistic or complex scenarios.

At the time of the detection by LIGO of the gravitational waves emitted during the final coalescence of two 30 solar mass black holes, the mass range between 10 and 100 solar masses were still only poorly constrained.   Since then, new observations have been claimed to close this window, at least for models in which the primordial black holes have all the same mass:

== Implications ==

The evaporation of primordial black holes has been suggested as one possible explanation for [[gamma-ray burst]]s. This explanation is, however, considered unlikely.{{clarify|date=February 2012}}{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Other problems for which primordial black holes have been suggested as a solution include the [[dark matter]] problem, the cosmological [[Domain wall (string theory)|domain wall]] problem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = D.

Even if they do not solve these problems, the low number of primordial black holes (as of 2010, only two [[intermediate mass black hole]]s were confirmed) aids [[physical cosmology|cosmologists]] by putting constraints on the spectrum of density fluctuations in the early universe.

== String theory ==
{{main|String theory}}

[[General relativity]] predicts the smallest primordial black holes would have evaporated by now, but if there were a [[Four-dimensional space|fourth spatial dimension]]&amp;nbsp;– as predicted by [[string theory]]&amp;nbsp;– it would affect how gravity acts on small scales and "slow down the evaporation quite substantially".&lt;ref&gt;McKee, Maggie. (2006) [http://www.newscientistspace.com/article/dn9240-satellite-could-open-door-on-extra-dimension.html NewScientistSpace.com&amp;nbsp;– Satellite could open door on extra dimension]&lt;/ref&gt; This could mean there are several thousand black holes in our galaxy. To test this theory, scientists will use the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] which was put in orbit by [[NASA]] on June 11, 2008. If they observe specific small interference patterns within [[gamma-ray burst]]s, it could be the first indirect evidence for primordial black holes and string theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6745">In [[philosophy]], '''Ryle's regress''' is a classic argument against [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] theories, and concludes that such theories are essentially meaningless as they do not explain what they purport to. 

==Overview==
The [[philosopher]] [[Gilbert Ryle]] was concerned with what he called the ''[[intellectualist]] legend'' (also known as the "Dogma of the [[ghost in the machine]]," the "Two-Lives Legend," the "Two-Worlds Story," or the "Double-Life Legend") which requires intelligent acts to be the product of the conscious application of mental rules. In other words Ryle was attempting to combat [[Cartesian dualism]]. 

A fine summation of the position which Ryle is combating is the famous statement by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] that, "The ancestor of every action is a thought."{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In sharp contrast to such assertions, which rule out any other possible parentage to actions by the use of the word "every," Ryle argued in ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949) that the intellectualist legend results in an [[infinite regress]] of thought: 

:''According to the legend, whenever an agent does anything intelligently, his act is preceded and steered by another internal act of considering a regulative proposition appropriate to his practical problem. [...] Must we then say that for the hero's reflections how to act to be intelligent he must first reflect how best to reflect how to act? The endlessness of this implied regress shows that the application of the criterion of appropriateness does not entail the occurrence of a process of considering this criterion.''(''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949), p. 31.)

:''The crucial objection to the intellectualist legend is this. The consideration of propositions is itself an operation the execution of which can be more or less intelligent, less or more stupid. But if, for any operation to be intelligently executed, a prior theoretical operation had first to be performed and performed intelligently, it would be a logical impossibility for anyone ever to break into the circle.''(''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949), p. 30.)

Variants of Ryle's regress are commonly aimed at cognitivist theories. For instance, in order to explain the behavior of rats, [[Edward Tolman]] suggested that the rats were constructing a "cognitive map" that helped them locate reinforcers, and he used intentional terms (e.g., expectancies, purposes, meanings) to describe their behavior.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} This led to a famous attack on Tolman's work by Edwin R. Guthrie who pointed out that if one was implying that every action must be preceded by a cognitive 'action' (a 'thought' or 'schema' or 'script' or whatever), then what 'causes' this act? (a physical feeling perhaps?) Clearly it must be preceded by another cognitive action, which must in turn be preceded by another and so on, in an [[infinite regress]] (always a sign that something has gone wrong with a theory). Guthrie's key point is that Tolman's explanation, which attempts to explain animal cognition, does not really explain anything at all. 

As a further example, we may take note of the following statement from ''The Concept of Mind'':

:"The main object of this chapter is to show that there are many activities which directly display qualities of mind, yet are neither themselves intellectual operations nor yet effects of intellectual operations. Intelligent practice is not a step-child of theory. On the contrary theorizing is one practice amongst others and is itself intelligently or stupidly conducted."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ryl-ezY6Mn8C&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=%22the+main+object+of+this+chapter+is+to+show+that+there+are+many+activities+which+directly+display+qualities+of+mind+yet+are+neither+themselves+intellectual+operations+nor+yet+effects+of+intellectual+operations%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=a07Q-Hok3a&amp;sig=OFQpu_UuMDw19Ned_iXqp_1PwW0&amp;hl=en books.google.com] page 26 of ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' by [[Gilbert Ryle]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of Ryle's critique, we may translate the statement by Emerson (still very much in common currency) into, "The ancestor of every action is an action." (This is so, since Ryle notes that, "theorizing is one practice amongst others.") - a reminder of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Or we can go even further and argue that, according to Ryle: "The ancestor of every behavior is a behavior". 

As the use of the word 'behaviour' in the sentence above indicates, Ryle's regress arises from the [[Behaviorist]] tradition.  Near the end of ''The Concept of Mind'', Ryle states

:''The Behaviorists’ methodological program has been of revolutionary importance to the program of psychology. But more, it has been one of the main sources of the philosophical suspicion that the two-worlds story is a myth.'(''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949), p. 328.)

Ryle's brand of logical behaviorism is not to be confused with the [[radical behaviorism]] of [[B. F. Skinner]], or the methodological behaviorism of [[John B. Watson]]. Alex Byrne noted that "Ryle was indeed, as he reportedly said, 'only one arm and one leg a behaviorist'."{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Cognitive scientists have Ryle's regress as a potential problem with their theories. A desideratum for those is a principled account of how the (potentially) infinite regress that emerges can be stopped. See also the [[homunculus fallacy]].

== Response to Ryle's regress ==

[[Immanuel Kant]] anticipated Ryle's Regress when he wrote in [[The Critique of Pure Reason]] the following:

"But of reason one cannot say that before the state in which it determines the power of choice, another state precedes in which this state itself is determined. For since reason itself is not an appearance and is not subject at all to any conditions of sensibility, no temporal sequence takes place in it even as to its causality, and thus the dynamical law of nature, which determines the temporal sequence according to rules, cannot be applied to it."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''The Critique of Pure Reason''.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. p.543&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, Kant is saying that Reason is outside of the causative elements of the natural world and as such is not subject to the law of cause and effect.  Hence, for Kant, Reason needs no prior explanation for any of its choices or volitions.  Ryle's assumption is that all volitions are physicalistic processes and thus subject to cause and effect.  If such is the case, then Ryle would be correct in his regress.  However, if some volitions are not subject to cause and effect, per Kant, then Ryle's regress fails.

==Background and life==
Safi al-Din Abd al-Muʾmin ibn Yusof ibn Fakhir al-Ormawi al-Baghdadi (Sufi al-Dīn in some Ottoman sources), renowned musician and writer on the theory of music, was born c. 613 [[Islamic calendar|AH]] (1216 AD), probably in Urmiya (Iran). He died in [[Baghdad]] on 28 Ṣafar 693 AH (28 January 1294 AD), at the age of about 80.  According to the [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;ref name="Encislam"&gt;{{cite web|last1=E.|first1=Neubauer|title=ṢAFĪ al-DĪN al-URMAWĪ|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_6447|website=Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition|publisher=Brill|accessdate=22 March 2017|language=en|doi=10.1163/1573-3912_islam_sim_6447}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The sources are silent about the ethnic origin of his family. He may have been of [[Persian people|Persian]] descent [[Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi]] calls him afdal-i Īrān (A sage of [[Iran]])". Based on its terminology, Al-Urmawi's 'international' modal system was intended to represent the predominant Arab and Persian local traditions.&lt;ref&gt;E. Neubaer, "Music in the Islamic World", in Clifford Edmund Bosworth, M.S.Asimov, "History of Civilizations of Central Asia, Volume 4, Part 2", pg 596.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=ELrRr0L8UOsC&amp;pg=PA596&amp;lpg=PA596&amp;dq=urmawi+persian+music&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6kCpooYFw6&amp;sig=L_uhZUFYeS3Y6CzsRRNhW7oijWY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CfE6UIKBK8r46QGnwIB4&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=urmawi%20persian%20music&amp;f=false].  excerpt: "To judge from its terminology, al-Urmawi's international modal system was intended to represent the predominant Arab and Persian local traditions.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his youth, he went to Baghdad and was educated in the [[Arabic language]], literature, [[history]] and [[penmanship]].  He made a name for himself as an excellent calligrapher and was appointed copyist at the new library built by the [[Abbassid]] [[caliph]] al-Mustaṣim.

He had also studied [[Shafii]] law &lt;ref name="Encislam"/&gt;  and comparative law (Khilaf [[Fiqh]]) at the Mustansiriyya Madrasa which opened in 631 AH (1234 AD). This qualified him to assume a post in al-Mustaʿsim's juridical administration and, after 656 AH (1258), to head the supervision of the foundations (naẓariyyat al-waqf) in [[Iraq]] until 665 AH (1267), when [[Nasir al-Din Tusi]] took over.

al-Urmawi become known as a musician and excellent lute (‘[[Oud|Ud]]) player and accepted as a member of the private circle of boon companions, thanks to one of his music students, the caliph's favoured songstress Luḥaẓ.  His musical talent made him survive the fall of [[Baghdad]], by generously accommodating one of Hulagu’s officer.  [[Hulagu]] the Mongol ruler was impressed by al-Urmawi and doubled his income relative to the [[Abbassid]] era.

His musical career, however, seems to have been supported mainly by the Juwayni family, especially by [[Shams ad-Din Juvayni|Shams al-Din Muḥammad]] and his son Sharaf Din Harun who was put to death in 685 AH (1285). After the demise of his patrons, he fell into oblivion and poverty. He was placed under arrest on account of a debt of 300 dinars.  He died in the Shafi'i Madrasat al-Khalil in Baghdad.

==Music and music theory==
As a composer, al-Urmawi cultivated the vocal forms of ''[[Sawt (music)|ṣawt]]'', ''qawl'' and ''[[Andalusi nubah|nawba]]''.  In the anonymous Persian ''Kanz al-tuḥaf'' of the 8th century AH (14th century AD), he is also credited with the invention of two stringed musical instruments, the ''nuzha'' and the mughnī.&lt;ref&gt;See H. G. Farmer, ''Studies in oriental [[musical instrument]]s'', First Series, London 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Urmawi's most important work are two books in [[Arabic Language]] on music theory, the Kitab al-Adwār and Risālah al-Sharafiyyah fi 'l-nisab al-taʾlifiyyah. The first book was written while he still worked in the library of [[al-Mustasim]]. The [[Abbassid]] caliph was well known for his addiction to music. The second book was dedicated to Sharaf al-Din Harun Juvayni who ordered him to compile it.

[[File:Safi al-Din lute.png |thumb|Drawing of a lute by Safi al-Din from a 1333 copy of  his book, ''Kitab al-Adwār''. The oldest copy dates to 1296.]]

The Kitab al-Adwār is the first extant work on scientific music theory after the writings on music of [[Avicenna]].&lt;ref name="Encislam"/&gt; It contains valuable information on the practice and theory of music in the Perso-ʿIraqi&lt;ref name="Encislam"/&gt; area, such as the factual establishment of the five-stringed lute (still an exception in [[Avicenna]]’s time), the final stage in the division of the octave into 17 steps, the complete nomenclature and definition of the scales constituting the system of the twelve Makams (called shudūd) and the six Awāz modes.&lt;ref name="Encislam"/&gt; It also contains precise depictions of contemporary musical metres, and the use of letters and numbers for the notation of melodies. It is the first time that this occurs in history, making it a unique work of greatest value.&lt;ref name="Encislam"/&gt; Al-Urmawi's 'international' modal system was intended to represent the predominant Arab and Persian local musical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;"History of Civilizations of Central Asia", Contributor Clifford Edmund Bosworth, M.S. Asimov,.Motilal Banarsidass Publ, 2002. pg 596&lt;/ref&gt;

By its conciseness it became the most popular and influential book on music for centuries. No other Arabic (Persian or Ottoman Turkish) music treatise was so often copied, commented upon and translated into Oriental (and Western) languages.&lt;ref name="Encislam"/&gt; The Kitab al-Adwār was conceived as a compendium (mukhtasar) of the standard musical knowledge of its time.

The Kitab al-Adwār was translated several times into [[Persian language]] and there also exists an [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] translation.&lt;ref name="Encislam"/&gt;
 
Al-Urmawi’s second book, Risāla al-Sharafiyya, was written around 665 AH (1267 AD).&lt;ref name="Encislam"/&gt; It is dedicated to his student and later patron, Sharaf al-Din Harun Juvayni (Juvayn is a town in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]). He was part of the scientific, literary and artistic circle of the Juvayni family. Through these gatherings, al-Urmawi was in contact with the Persian scholar [[Nasir al-Din Tusi]].  Nasir al-Din Tusi, who left a short treatise on the proportions of musical intervals perceivable in the pulse may have stimulated al-Urmawī's interest in Greek science and music theory.&lt;ref name="Encislam"/&gt;

These two major books have become the foundation of academic discourse on Arabic music, most notably modern works by Briton Owen Wright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=619996|title='Abd al-Qādir al-Marāghī and 'Alī b.

{{Scholasticism}}
{{Catholic philosophy}}
'''Scholasticism''' is a method of critical [[thought]] which dominated teaching by the [[academics]] ("scholastics", or "schoolmen"{{anchor|Schoolmen}}) of [[medieval university|medieval universities]] in Europe from about 1100 to 1700, and a program of employing that method in articulating and defending [[dogma]] in an increasingly pluralistic context. It originated as an outgrowth of and a departure from Christian theology within the [[monastic]] schools at the earliest European universities.&lt;ref&gt;See Steven P. Marone, "Medieval philosophy in context" in A. S. McGrade, ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Philosophy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003). On the difference between scholastic and medieval monastic postures towards learning, see Jean Leclercq, ''The Love of Learning and the Desire for God'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1970) esp. 89; 238ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of scholasticism was closely associated with the rise of the 12th and 13th century schools that developed into the earliest modern universities, including those in Italy, France, Spain and England.&lt;ref&gt;Gracia, Jorge JE, and Timothy B. Noone, eds. A companion to philosophy in the middle ages. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, 55–64&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholasticism is not so much a philosophy or a theology as a method of learning, as it places a strong emphasis on [[dialectical reasoning]] to extend knowledge by [[inference]] and to resolve [[contradictions]]. Scholastic thought is also known for rigorous conceptual analysis and the careful drawing of distinctions. In the classroom and in writing, it often takes the form of explicit [[disputation]]; a topic drawn from the tradition is broached in the form of a question, opponents' responses are given, a counterproposal is argued and opponents' arguments rebutted. Because of its emphasis on rigorous dialectical method, scholasticism was eventually applied to many other fields of study.&lt;ref name=cambridgedict&gt;Patte, Daniel. ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Christianity.'' Ed. Daniel Patte. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010, 11132-1133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Edward. ''God and Reason in the Middle Ages.'' Cambridge University Press, 2004, 159&lt;/ref&gt;

As a program, scholasticism began as an attempt at harmonization on the part of medieval Christian thinkers, to harmonize the various authorities of their own tradition, and to reconcile Christian theology with classical and late antiquity philosophy, especially that of [[Aristotle]] but also of [[Neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;Particularly through Pseudo-Dionysius, Augustine, and Boethius, and through the influence of Plotinus and Proclus on Muslim philosophers. In the case of Aquinas, for instance, see Jan Aertsen, "Aquinas' philosophy in its historical setting" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Aquinas'', ed. Norman Kretzmann and Eleonore Stump (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993).   Jean Leclerq, ''The Love of Learning and the Desire for God'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Christian apologetics]].)

Some of the main figures of scholasticism include [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (the "father of scholasticism"&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Edward. ''God and Reason in the Middle Ages.'' Cambridge University Press, 2004, 56&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Peter Abelard]], [[Alexander of Hales]], [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]], [[Bonaventure]], and [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Aquinas's masterwork ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' is considered to be the pinnacle of scholastic, medieval, and Christian philosophy;&lt;ref name=GilsonP&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilson|first=Etienne|title=The Spirit of Medieval Philosophy (Gifford Lectures 1933–35)|year=1991|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|location=Notre Dame, IN|isbn=978-0-268-01740-8|pages=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; it began while Aquinas was regent master at the ''studium provinciale'' of [[Santa Sabina]] in Rome, the forerunner of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']]. Important work in the scholastic tradition has been carried on well past Aquinas's time, for instance by [[Francisco Suárez]] and [[Luis de Molina]], and also among Lutheran and Reformed thinkers. The historical legacy of scholasticism lay not in specific scientific discoveries, for these were not made,&lt;ref&gt;Verger, Jacques, "The universities and scholasticism" in ''The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume 5 c. 1198–1300.'' Cambridge University Press, 2007, 273&lt;/ref&gt; but laying the foundations for the development of natural science.&lt;ref&gt;Colish, Marcia L. ''Medieval foundations of the western intellectual tradition, 400–1400.'' Yale University Press, 1999, 317–351&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The terms "scholastic" and "scholasticism" derive from the [[Latin]] word ''{{lang|la|scholasticus}}'', the Latinized form of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|σχολαστικός}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|scholastikos}}''), an adjective derived from {{lang|grc|σχολή}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|scholē}}''), "[[school]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=school|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=school&amp;allowed_in_frame=0}} {{cite web|title=scholastic|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=scholastic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}} {{LSJ|sxolh/|σχολή}}, {{LSJ|sxolastiko/s|σχολαστικός|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scholasticus'' means "of or pertaining to schools". The "scholastics" were, roughly, "schoolmen".

== History ==

The foundations of Christian scholasticism were laid by Boethius through his logical and theological essays,&lt;ref name=cambridgedict /&gt; and later forerunners (and then companions) to scholasticism were Islamic [[Kalām|Ilm al-Kalām]], literally "science of discourse",&lt;ref name="Wolfson"&gt;Winter, Tim J. "Introduction." Introduction. The Cambridge Companion to Classical Islamic Theology. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2008. 4–5. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jewish philosophy#Jewish scholarship after destruction of Second Temple|Jewish philosophy]], especially [[Jewish Kalam]].&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Pelner Cosman, Linda Gale Jones, Handbook to Life in the Medieval World, p. 391. {{ISBN|1438109075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early Scholasticism ===

The first significant renewal of learning in the West came with the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] of the [[Early Middle Ages]]. [[Charlemagne]], advised by [[Peter of Pisa]] and [[Alcuin of York]], attracted the scholars of England and Ireland. By decree in AD 787, he established schools in every abbey in his empire.  These schools, from which the name ''scholasticism'' is derived, became centers of medieval learning.&lt;ref&gt;Colish, Marcia L. ''Medieval foundations of the western intellectual tradition, 400–1400.'' Yale University Press, 1999, 66–67&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, knowledge of Ancient Greek had vanished in the West except in Ireland, where its teaching and use was widely dispersed in the [[monastic school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;MacManus, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;{{nonspecific|date=November 2018}} Irish scholars had a considerable presence in the [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish court]], where they were renowned for their learning.&lt;ref name="StanfordEriugena"&gt;{{cite web |title=John Scottus Eriugena |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottus-eriugena/ |website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |date=2004-10-17 |accessdate=2008-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them was [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] (815–877), one of the founders of scholasticism.&lt;ref name="Gothic"&gt;{{harvnb|Toman|2007|p=10}}: "[[Peter Abelard|Abelard]] himself was&amp;nbsp;... together with John Scotus Erigena (9th century), and [[Lanfranc]] and [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (both 11th century), one of the founders of scholasticism."&lt;/ref&gt; Eriugena was the most significant Irish intellectual of the early monastic period and an outstanding philosopher in terms of originality.&lt;ref name="StanfordEriugena"/&gt; He had considerable familiarity with the Greek language and translated many works into Latin, affording access to the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Greek theological tradition]].&lt;ref name="StanfordEriugena"/&gt;

The other three founders of scholasticism were the 11th-century scholars [[Peter Abelard]], Archbishop [[Lanfranc of Canterbury]] and Archbishop [[Anselm of Canterbury]].&lt;ref name="Gothic"/&gt;

This period saw the beginning of the '[[Transmission of Greek philosophical ideas in the Middle Ages|rediscovery]]' of many Greek works which had been lost to the Latin West.  As early as the 10th century, scholars in Spain had begun to gather translated texts and, in the latter half of that century, began transmitting them to the rest of Europe.{{sfn|Lindberg|1978|pp=60–61}} After a successful burst of [[Reconquista]] in the 12th century, Spain opened even further for Christian scholars, and as these Europeans encountered Islamic philosophy, they opened a wealth of Arab knowledge of mathematics and astronomy.&lt;ref name=institutions&gt;Grant, Edward, and Emeritus Edward Grant. The foundations of modern science in the Middle Ages: their religious, institutional and intellectual contexts. Cambridge University Press, 1996, 23–28&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as [[Adelard of Bath]] traveled to Spain and Sicily, translating works on astronomy and mathematics, including the first complete translation of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' into Latin.{{sfn|Clagett|1982|p=356}}

At the same time, [[Anselm of Laon]] systematized the production of the [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]] on Scripture, followed by the rise to prominence of [[dialectic]] (the middle subject of the medieval [[trivium (education)|trivium]]) in the work of [[Abelard]]. [[Peter Lombard]] produced a collection of ''[[Sentences]],'' or opinions of the Church Fathers and other authorities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Hoffecker |title=Peter Lombard, Master of the Sentences|url=http://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/peter-lombard-master-of-the-sentences/|publisher=Ligonier Ministries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High Scholasticism ===

The 13th and early 14th centuries are generally seen as the high period of scholasticism. The early 13th century witnessed the culmination of the [[recovery of Aristotle|recovery of Greek philosophy]]. Schools of translation grew up in Italy and Sicily, and eventually in the rest of Europe.  Powerful Norman kings gathered men of knowledge from Italy and other areas into their courts as a sign of their prestige.{{sfn|Lindberg|1978|pp=70–72}} [[William of Moerbeke]]'s translations and editions of Greek philosophical texts in the middle half of the thirteenth century helped form a clearer picture of Greek philosophy, particularly of Aristotle, than was given by the Arabic versions on which they had previously relied. [[Edward Grant]] writes "Not only was the structure of the Arabic language radically different from that of Latin, but some Arabic versions had been derived from earlier Syriac translations and were thus twice removed from the original Greek text. Word-for-word translations of such Arabic texts could produce tortured readings. By contrast, the structural closeness of Latin to Greek, permitted literal, but intelligible, word-for-word translations."&lt;ref name=institutions /&gt;

[[university|Universities]] developed in the large cities of Europe during this period, and rival clerical orders within the church began to battle for political and intellectual control over these centers of educational life. The two main orders founded in this period were the [[Franciscans]] and the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]. The Franciscans were founded by [[Francis of Assisi]] in 1209. Their leader in the middle of the century was [[Bonaventure]], a traditionalist who defended the theology of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and the philosophy of [[Plato]], incorporating only a little of Aristotle in with the more neoplatonist elements. Following Anselm, Bonaventure supposed that reason can only discover truth when philosophy is illuminated by religious faith.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, Jay, Wayne Hellmann, and Jared Goff, eds. ''A companion to Bonaventure.'' Brill, 2014, 122&lt;/ref&gt; Other important Franciscan scholastics were [[Duns Scotus]], [[Peter Auriol]] and [[William of Ockham]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Gillian Rosemary. ''Fifty key medieval thinkers.'' Routledge, 2002, 93–93, 147–149, 164–169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gracia, Jorge JE, and Timothy B. Noone, eds. A companion to philosophy in the middle ages. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, 353–369, 494–503, 696–712&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, the Dominican order, a teaching order founded by [[St Dominic]] in 1215, to propagate and defend Christian doctrine, placed more emphasis on the use of reason and made extensive use of the [[recovery of Aristotle|new Aristotelian sources]] derived from the East and Moorish Spain. The great representatives of Dominican thinking in this period were [[Albertus Magnus]] and (especially) [[Thomas Aquinas]], whose artful synthesis of Greek rationalism and Christian doctrine eventually came to define Catholic philosophy. Aquinas placed more emphasis on reason and argumentation, and was one of the first to use the new translation of Aristotle's metaphysical and epistemological writing. This was a significant departure from the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] and Augustinian thinking that had dominated much of early scholasticism. Aquinas showed how it was possible to incorporate much of the philosophy of Aristotle without falling into the errors of the Commentator, [[Averroes]].&lt;ref&gt;Hannam, James.

=== Neo-Scholasticism ===
{{Main|Neo-scholasticism}}

The revival and development from the second half of the 19th century of medieval scholastic philosophy is sometimes called neo-[[Thomism]].&lt;ref name=:0&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/10/thomistic-tradition-part-i.html |author=[[Edward Feser]] |title=The Thomistic tradition, Part I (archived copy) |accessdate=2011-01-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129133527/http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/10/thomistic-tradition-part-i.html |archivedate=29 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thomistic Scholasticism ===
As J. A. Weisheipl [[Order of Preachers|O.P.]] emphasizes, within the [[Dominican Order]] Thomistic scholasticism has been continuous since the time of Aquinas: "Thomism was always alive in the Dominican Order, small as it was after the ravages of the Reformation, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic occupation. Repeated legislation of the General Chapters, beginning after the death of St. Thomas, as well as the Constitutions of the Order, required all Dominicans to teach the doctrine of St. Thomas both in philosophy and in theology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://domcentral.org/blog/the-revival-of-thomism-an-historical-survey-weisheipl/ |title=The Revival of Thomism: An Historical Survey |first=James |last=Weisheipl |year=1962 |accessdate=2013-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927202339/http://domcentral.org/blog/the-revival-of-thomism-an-historical-survey-weisheipl/ |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomistic scholasticism or scholastic [[Thomism]] identifies with the philosophical and theological tradition stretching back to the time of St. Thomas.  It focuses not only on exegesis of the historical Aquinas but also on the articulation of a rigorous system of orthodox Thomism to be used as an instrument of critique of contemporary thought.  Due to its suspicion of attempts to harmonize Aquinas with non-Thomistic categories and assumptions, Scholastic Thomism has sometimes been called, according to philosphers like [[Edward Feser]], "Strict Observance Thomism".&lt;ref&gt;http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/10/thomistic-tradition-part-i.html  Accessed 5 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  A discussion of recent and current Thomistic scholasticism can be found in ''La Metafisica di san Tommaso d'Aquino e i suoi interpreti'' (2002) by {{ill|Battista Mondin|it}}, which includes such figures as Sofia Vanni Rovighi (1908–1990),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/sofia-vanni-rovighi_(Dizionario-di-filosofia) Vanni Rovighi, Sofia]. [[Treccani]] Encyclopedia./  Accessed 17 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cornelio Fabro]] (1911–1995), Carlo Giacon (1900–1984),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlo-giacon_(Dizionario-Biografico) GIACON, Carlo]. Treccani Encyclopedia./  Accessed 9 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tomas Tyn]] [[Order of Preachers|O.P.]] (1950–1990), Abelardo Lobato [[Order of Preachers|O.P.]] (1925–2012), Leo Elders (1926– ) and [[Ventimiglia Giovanni|Giovanni Ventimiglia]] (1964– ) among others.  Fabro in particular emphasizes Aquinas' originality, especially with respect to the ''actus essendi'' or act of existence of finite beings by participating in being itself.  Other scholars such as those involved with the "Progetto Tommaso" seek to establish an objective and universal reading of Aquinas' texts.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |first=Raffaele |last=Rizzello |chapter=Il Progetto Tommaso |title=Vita quaerens intellectum |editor1=Giacomo Grasso, O.P. |editor2=Stefano Serafini |publisher=Millennium Romae |location=Rome |year=1999 |pages=157–161 |chapter-url=http://www.phmae.it/rec35.htm  |accessdate=2013-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013141/http://www.phmae.it/rec35.htm |archivedate=2013-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomistic scholasticism in the English speaking world went into decline in the 1970s when the Thomistic revival that had been spearheaded by [[Jacques Maritain]], [[Étienne Gilson]], and others, diminished in influence. Partly, this was because this branch of [[Thomism]] had become a quest to understand the historical Aquinas after the [[Second Vatican Council]].

=== Analytical Scholasticism ===

A renewed interest in the "scholastic" way of doing philosophy has recently awoken in the confines of the [[analytic philosophy]]. Attempts emerged to combine elements of scholastic and analytic methodology in pursuit of a contemporary philosophical synthesis. Proponents of various incarnations of this approach include [[Anthony Kenny]], [[Peter King (philosopher)|Peter King]], Thomas Williams or [[David Oderberg]]. [[Analytical Thomism]] can be seen as a pioneer part of this movement.{{Citation needed|reason=we need done boys|date=November 2018}}

== Scholastic method ==

Cornelius O'Boyle explained that Scholasticism focuses on how to acquire knowledge and how to communicate effectively so that it may be acquired by others. It was thought that the best way to achieve this was by replicating the discovery process (''modus inveniendi'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The art of medicine: medical teaching at the University of Paris, 1250–1400|last=Cornelius|first=O'Boyle|date=1998|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004111240|location=Leiden|oclc=39655867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholasticists would choose a book by a renowned scholar, ''[[auctor]]'' (author), as a subject for investigation.  By reading it thoroughly and critically, the disciples learned to appreciate the theories of the author.  Other documents related to the book would be referenced, such as Church councils, papal letters and anything else written on the subject, be it ancient or contemporary.  The points of disagreement and contention between multiple sources would be written down in individual sentences or snippets of text, known as [[sententiae]]. Once the sources and points of disagreement had been laid out through a series of [[dialectic]]s, the two sides of an argument would be made whole so that they would be found to be in agreement and not contradictory. (Of course, sometimes opinions would be totally rejected, or new positions proposed.) This was done in two ways. The first was through [[philology|philological]] analysis.  Words were examined and argued to have multiple meanings.  It was also considered that the ''auctor'' might have intended a certain word to mean something different.  Ambiguity could be used to find common ground between two otherwise contradictory statements. The second was through logical analysis, which relied on the rules of formal [[logic]] – as they were known at the time – to show that contradictions did not exist but were subjective to the reader.&lt;ref name=westintel&gt;Colish, Marcia L. ''Medieval foundations of the western intellectual tradition, 400–1400.'' Yale University Press, 1999, 265–273&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholastic instruction ==

Scholastic instruction consisted of several elements. The first was the ''lectio'': a teacher would read an authoritative text followed by a commentary, but no questions were permitted. This was followed by the ''meditatio'' ([[wikt:meditatio|meditation]] or reflection) in which students reflected on and appropriated the text. Finally, in the ''quaestio'' students could ask questions (''quaestiones'') that might have occurred to them during ''meditatio''. Eventually the discussion of ''questiones'' became a method of inquiry apart from the ''lectio'' and independent of authoritative texts. ''Disputationes'' were arranged to resolve controversial ''quaestiones''.{{sfn|van Asselt|2011|p=59}}

Questions to be disputed were ordinarily announced beforehand, but students could propose a question to the teacher unannounced – ''disputationes de quodlibet''. In this case, the teacher responded and the students rebutted; on the following day the teacher, having used notes taken during the disputation, summarised all arguments and presented his final position, riposting all rebuttals.&lt;ref name=westintel /&gt;{{sfn|van Asselt|2011|p=60}}

The ''quaestio'' method of reasoning was initially used especially when two authoritative texts seemed to contradict one another. Two contradictory propositions would be considered in the form of an either/or question, and each part of the question would have to be approved (''sic'') or denied (''non''). Arguments for the position taken would be presented in turn, followed by arguments against the position, and finally the arguments against would be refuted. This method forced scholars to consider opposing viewpoints and defend their own arguments against them.{{sfn|van Asselt|2011|pp=61–62}}

{{nihongo|'''Shōhō-ji'''|正法寺}} is a [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temple]] of the [[Ōbaku (school of Buddhism)|Ōbaku school]] of [[Buddhism]] in [[Gifu, Gifu|Gifu]], [[Gifu Prefecture]], [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="buddha"&gt;[http://www.gifucvb.or.jp/en/kankou/meisyo/gifudaibutu.shtml Gifu Great Buddha] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208131014/http://www.gifucvb.or.jp/en/kankou/meisyo/gifudaibutu.shtml |date=2008-12-08 }}. Gifu Convention and Visitors Bureau. Accessed June 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a branch temple of [[Mampuku-ji]] in [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]], [[Kyoto Prefecture]]. The temple has many aspects of the Ōbaku school, but its building style and sacraments are in the [[Chinese_Buddhism|Chinese]] style. Additionally, it is much larger than the average Japanese temple. The temple's official name is '''Kinpōzan Shōhō-ji''' (金鳳山正法寺).&lt;ref name="shoho"&gt;[http://www.gifu-daibutsu.com/shohoji/english.html Gifu Shouhouji Daibutsu]. Shōhō-ji. Accessed December 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The temple was first established in 1638, but did not join the Ōbaku school until 1692. In 1790, Ichū (推中), the 11th head priest, began planning the construction of the [[Gifu Great Buddha]] out of respect for [[Tōdai-ji]]'s Great Buddha in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. Ichū never saw the completed Buddha, as he died in 1825. The Great Buddha was finally completed in 1832.&lt;ref name="shoho"/&gt;

== Early life ==
Persky was born in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. As a teenager, he made contact with and received encouragement from [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Allen Ginsberg]] and other writers of the [[Beat Generation]]. Persky served in the [[United States Navy]], and then settled in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]] in the early 1960s, becoming part of a group of writers that included [[Jack Spicer]], [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]], [[Robin Blaser]] and George Stanley.

== Life during university ==
In 1966, Persky moved to [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]], Canada, and attended the [[University of British Columbia]], receiving degrees in [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]]. He studied with anthropologist Michael Kew, political philosopher Bob Rowan, and sociologist Roy Turner, and briefly studied as a graduate student with Rowan's teacher, political philosopher Joseph Tussman in the Experimental Program at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

During the 1960s and '70s, he was prominent as a student and civic activist, was an early staff member of the ''[[Georgia Straight]]'', a free alternative newspaper, and co-founder with Dennis Wheeler of the "Georgia Straight Writing Supplement", which eventually became New Star Books.

== Career after university ==
After university, Persky worked at Vancouver Mental Patients Association and the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] before becoming a college instructor in the sociology department at [[Northwest College]] in [[Terrace, British Columbia|Terrace]], [[British Columbia]]. He subsequently taught briefly at Malaspina College in [[Nanaimo, British Columbia|Nanaimo]], [[British Columbia]] and [[Simon Fraser University]] in [[Burnaby, British Columbia|Burnaby]]. From 1983-2016, he was a professor at [[Capilano University]] in [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|North Vancouver]], first in political studies and then in philosophy. Since 1990, Persky has resided part-time in Vancouver and in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].

He is the author or editor of some 20 books and has worked as a media commentator for the CBC, a literary columnist for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' and ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'', and has written for ''[[Body Politic (magazine)|The Body Politic]]'', ''[[This Magazine]]'', ''New Directions'', ''[[Saturday Night (magazine)|Saturday Night]]'', ''Sodomite Invasion Review'', ''[[Books in Canada]]'' and most recently ''[[The Tyee]]''.

'''''The Philosophy of Money''''' (1900) is a book on [[economic sociology]] by the German [[sociologist]] and [[social philosopher]], [[Georg Simmel]].&lt;ref name="Sociological Theory 158"&gt;Simmel, George. Georg Simmel. Sociological Theory. 7th ed. New York: The McGraw-Hill Companies, 2008. 158-88. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Probably considered Simmel's greatest work, Simmel saw money as a structuring agent that helps us understand the totality of life.&lt;ref name="Sociological Theory 158"/&gt;

==Money and value==
Simmel believed people created value by making objects, then separating themselves from those objects and then trying to overcome that distance. He found that objects that were too close were not considered valuable and objects that were too far away for people to obtain were also not considered valuable. What was also considered in determining value was the scarcity, time, sacrifice, and difficulties involved in getting objects. In the pre-modern era, beginning with bartering, different systems of exchange for goods and services allowed for the existence of incomparable systems of value (land, food, honor, love, etc.). With the advent of a universal currency as an intermediary, these systems became reconcilable, as everything tended to become expressible in a single quantifiable metric: its monetary cost.

==Social effects of money==
Simmel's outlook, while gloomy, is not wholly negative. As money and transactions increase, the independence of an individual decreases as he or she is drawn into a holistic network of exchange governed by quantifiable monetary value. Paradoxically, this results in greater potential freedom of choice for the individual, as money can be deployed toward any possible goal, even if most people's sheer lack of money renders that potential quite low much of the time. Money's homogenizing nature encourages greater liberty and equality and melts away forms of feudalism and patronage, even as it minimizes exceptional, incommensurable achievements in art and love.

'''''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations''''', generally referred to by its shortened title '''''The Wealth of Nations''''', is the ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' of the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[economist]] and moral [[philosopher]] [[Adam Smith]].  First published in 1776, the book offers one of the world's first collected descriptions of what builds nations' [[wealth]], and is today a fundamental work in [[classical economics]].  By reflecting upon the economics at the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the book touches upon such broad topics as the [[division of labour]], productivity, and [[free market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;O'Rourke, P. J.  [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/books/chapters/0107-1st-orou.html ""On 'The Wealth of Nations.'""] ''New York Times''.  7 January 2007.  18 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''The Wealth of Nations'' was published 9 March 1776, during the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and the [[Scottish Agricultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book |last=Smith |first=Adam |author-link=Adam Smith |year=1776 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title=An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations |volume=1 |edition=1 |publisher=W. Strahan |publication-date=1776 |publication-place=London |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C5dNAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |accessdate=2012-12-07}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mt1SAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP4#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=true volume 2] via Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; It influenced several authors and economists, such as [[Karl Marx]], as well as governments and organisations, setting the terms for economic debate and discussion for the next century and a half.&lt;ref&gt;I Ousby ed, ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge 1995) p. 1000&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Alexander Hamilton]] was influenced in part by ''The Wealth of Nations'' to write his ''[[Report on Manufactures]]'', in which he argued against many of Smith's policies. Hamilton based much of this report on the ideas of [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], and it was, in part, Colbert's ideas that Smith responded to, and criticised, with ''The Wealth of Nations.''&lt;ref&gt;K Sutherland ed., ''Wealth of Nations'' (Oxford 2008) p. 295 and p. 573&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wealth of Nations was the product of seventeen years of notes and earlier works, as well as an observation of conversation among economists of the time concerning economic and societal conditions during the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, and it took Smith some ten years to produce.&lt;ref&gt;K Sutherland ed., ''Wealth of Nations'' (Oxford 2008) p. i and p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;  The result, An Inquiry to the Wealth of Nations, was a treatise which sought to offer a practical application for reformed economic theory to replace the [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] and [[Physiocracy|physiocratic]] economic theories that were becoming less relevant in the time of industrial progress and innovation.&lt;ref&gt;K Sutherland ed., ''Wealth of Nations'' (Oxford 2008) p. xxix-xxxi&lt;/ref&gt;  It provided the foundation for economists, politicians, mathematicians, biologists,{{citeneeded|date=September 2018}} and thinkers of all fields to build upon.  Irrespective of historical influence, ''The Wealth of Nations'' represented a clear [[paradigm shift]] in the field of economics,&lt;ref&gt;K Sutherland ed., ''Wealth of Nations'' (Oxford 2008) p. xxi-ii&lt;/ref&gt; comparable to Sir [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' for [[physics]], [[Antoine Lavoisier]]'s ''[[Traité Élémentaire de Chimie]]'' for [[chemistry]], or [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' for [[biology]].

Fifth edition.&lt;/ref&gt; They found minor but numerous differences (including the addition of many footnotes) between the first and the second editions, both of which were published in two volumes. The differences between the second and third editions, however, are major.&lt;ref&gt;K Sutherland ed., ''Wealth of Nations'' (Oxford 2008) p. xlvi-vii&lt;/ref&gt; In 1784, Smith annexed these first two editions with the publication of ''Additions and Corrections to the First and Second Editions of Dr. Adam Smith’s Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,'' and he also had published the three-volume third edition of the ''Wealth of Nations'', which incorporated ''Additions and Corrections'' and, for the first time, an index. Among other things, the ''Additions and Corrections'' included entirely new sections, particularly to Bk 4 Chs 4 &amp; 5, and Bk 5 Ch 1, as well as an additional chapter (8), ‘Conclusion of the Mercantile System’, in Bk 4.&lt;ref&gt;K Sutherland ed., ''Wealth of Nations'' (Oxford 2008) p. xlvi-vii&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth edition, published in 1786, had only slight differences from the third edition, and Smith himself says in the ''Advertisement'' at the beginning of the book, "I have made no alterations of any kind."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Adam.

==Reception and impact==
===Great Britain===
====Intellectuals, critics, and reviewers====
[[File:Edward Gibbon by Henry Walton cleaned.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edward Gibbon]] praised ''The Wealth of Nations'']]
The first edition of the book sold out in six months.&lt;ref&gt;John Rae, ''Life of Adam Smith'' (London: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1895), p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; The printer [[William Strahan (publisher)|William Strahan]] wrote on 12 April 1776 that [[David Hume]] said ''The Wealth of Nations'' required too much thought to be as popular as [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''. Strahan also wrote: "What you say of Mr. Gibbon's and Dr. Smith's book is exactly just. The former is the most popular work; but the sale of the latter, though not near so rapid, has been more than I could have expected from a work that requires much thought and reflection (qualities that do not abound among modern readers) to peruse to any purpose."&lt;ref&gt;Rae, pp. 285–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbon wrote to [[Adam Ferguson]] on 1 April: "What an excellent work is that with which our common friend Mr. Adam Smith has enriched the public! An extensive science in a single book, and the most profound ideas expressed in the most perspicuous language".&lt;ref&gt;Rae, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; The review of the book in the ''[[Annual Register]]'' was probably written by Whig MP [[Edmund Burke]].&lt;ref&gt;Rae, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1791 the English radical [[Thomas Paine]] wrote in his ''[[Rights of Man]]'' that "Had Mr. Burke possessed talents similar to the author ‘On the Wealth of Nations,’ he would have comprehended all the parts which enter into, and, by assemblage, form a constitution."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Paine, ''Rights of Man, Common Sense, and Other Political Writings'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1800, the ''[[Anti-Jacobin Review]]'' criticized ''The Wealth of Nations''.&lt;ref name=jacobin&gt;J. J. Sack, ''From Jacobite to Conservative. Reaction and orthodoxy in Britain, c. 1760–1832'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1803, ''The Times'' argued against war with Spain: &lt;blockquote&gt;"She is our best customer; and by the gentle and peaceable stream of commerce, the treasures of the new world flow with greater certainty into English reservoirs, than it could do by the most successful warfare. They come in this way to support our manufactures, to encourage industry, to feed our poor, to pay taxes, to reward ingenuity, to diffuse riches among all classes of people. But for the full understanding of this beneficial circulation of wealth, we must refer to Dr. Adam Smith's incomparable ''Treatise on the Wealth of Nations"''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (25 October 1803), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In 1810, a correspondent writing under the pseudonym of Publicola included at the head of his letter Smith's line that "Exclusive Companies are ''nuisances'' in every respect" and called him "that learned writer".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (8 February 1810), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1812, [[Robert Southey]] of the ''Quarterly Review'' condemned ''The Wealth of Nations'' as a "tedious and hard-hearted book".&lt;ref name=jacobin/&gt; In 1821, ''The Times'' quoted Smith's opinion that the interests of corn dealers and the people were the same.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (17 September 1821), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1826, the English radical [[William Cobbett]] criticised in his ''[[Rural Rides]]'' the political economists' hostility to the Poor Law: "Well, amidst all this suffering, there is one good thing; the Scotch political economy is blown to the devil, and the ''Edinburgh Review'' and Adam Smith along with it".&lt;ref&gt;William Cobbett, ''Rural Rides'' (Penguin, 2001), p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberal statesman [[William Ewart Gladstone]] chaired the meeting of the [[Political Economy Club]] to celebrate the centenary of the publication of ''The Wealth of Nations''.&lt;ref&gt;H. C. G. Matthew, ''Gladstone. 1875–1898'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberal historian [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] believed that ''The Wealth of Nations'' gave a "scientific backbone to liberal sentiment"&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Fasnacht, ''Acton's Political Philosophy. An Analysis'' (London: Hollis and Carter, 1952), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; and that it was the "classic English philosophy of history".&lt;ref&gt;Fasnacht, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legislators====
Smith's biographer [[John Rae (biographer)|John Rae]] contends that ''The Wealth of Nations'' shaped government policy soon after it was published.&lt;ref name="Rae294" /&gt;

=====18th century=====
In 1777, in the first budget after the book was published, the Prime Minister [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]], got the idea for two new taxes from the book: one on man-servants and the other on property sold at auction. The budget of 1778 introduced the inhabited house duty and the malt tax, both recommended by Smith. In 1779, Smith was consulted by politicians [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Henry Dundas]] and [[Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle|Lord Carlisle]] on the subject of giving Ireland free trade.&lt;ref name="Rae294"&gt;Rae, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Charles James Fox00.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles James Fox]] was the first person to mention ''The Wealth of Nations'' in Parliament]]
''The Wealth of Nations'' was first mentioned in Parliament by the Whig leader [[Charles James Fox]] on 11 November 1783: &lt;blockquote&gt;"There was a maxim laid down in an excellent book upon the Wealth of Nations which had been ridiculed for its simplicity, but which was indisputable as to its truth. In that book it was stated that the only way to become rich was to manage matters so as to make one's income exceed one's expenses. This maxim applied equally to an individual and to a nation. The proper line of conduct therefore was by a well-directed economy to retrench every current expense, and to make as large a saving during the peace as possible."&lt;ref name="Rae, p. 290"&gt;Rae, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; However Fox once told [[Charles Butler (lawyer)|Charles Butler]] sometime after 1785 that he had never read the book and that "There is something in all these subjects which passes my comprehension; something so wide that I could never embrace them myself nor find any one who did."&lt;ref name="Rae, p. 289"&gt;Rae, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; When Fox was dining with [[James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale|Lord Lauderdale]] in 1796, Lauderdale remarked that they knew nothing of political economy before Adam Smith wrote. "Pooh," replied Fox, "your Adam Smiths are nothing, but" (he added, turning to the company) "that is his love; we must spare him there." Lauderdale replied: "I think he is everything", to which Fox rejoined: "That is a great proof of your affection".&lt;ref name="Rae, p. 289" /&gt; Fox also found Adam Smith "tedious" and believed that one half of ''The Wealth of Nations'' could be "omitted with much benefit to the subject".&lt;ref&gt;L. G. Mitchell, ''Charles James Fox'' (Penguin, 1997), p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Wealth of Nations'' was next mentioned in Parliament by Robert Thornton MP in 1787 to support the [[Eden Agreement|Commercial Treaty with France]]. In the same year [[George Dempster (lawyer)|George Dempster]] MP referenced it in the debate on the proposal to farm the post-horse duties and in 1788 by a Mr. Hussy on the Wool Exportation Bill.&lt;ref name="Rae, p. 290" /&gt;

The Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]], praised Smith in the House of Commons on 17 February 1792: "…an author of our own times now unfortunately no more (I mean the author of a celebrated treatise ''on the Wealth of Nations''), whose extensive knowledge of detail, and depth of philosophical research will, I believe, furnish the best solution to every question connected with the history of commerce, or with the systems of political economy."&lt;ref&gt;John Ehrman, ''The Younger Pitt. The Years of Acclaim'' (London: Constable, 1969), p. 267, n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year it was quoted by Samuel Whitbread MP and Fox (on the division of labour) in the debate on the armament against Russia and also by [[William Wilberforce]] in introducing his Bill against the slave trade.  The book was not mentioned in the House of Lords until a debate in 1793 between [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Lansdowne]] [[Alexander Wedderburn, 1st Earl of Rosslyn|Lord Loughborough]] about revolutionary principles in France.&lt;ref&gt;Rae, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 May 1797, Pitt said in the debate on the suspension of cash payments by the [[Bank of England]] that Smith was "that great author" but his arguments, "though always ingenious", were "sometimes injudicious".&lt;ref&gt;John Ehrman, ''The Younger Pitt. The Consuming Struggle'' (London: Constable, 1996), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1798, [[John Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale|Sir John Mitford]], the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]], cited the book in his criticism of bills of exchange given in consideration of other bills.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (24 December 1798), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; 

During a debate on the price of corn in 1800 [[George Greville, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Lord Warwick]] said: &lt;blockquote&gt;"There was hardly any kind of property on which the law did not impose some restraints and regulations with regard to the sale of them, except that of provisions.  This was probably done on the principles laid down by a celebrated and able writer, Doctor Adam Smith, who had maintained that every thing ought to be left to its own level.  He knew something of that Gentleman, whose heart he knew was as sound as his head; and he was sure that had he lived to this day and beheld the novel state of wretchedness to which the country was now reduced ...; that Great Man would have reason to blush for some of the doctrines he had laid down.  He would now have abundant opportunities of observing that all those artificial means of enhancing the price of provisions, which he had considered as no way mischievous, were practised at this time to a most alarming extent.  He would see the Farmer keeping up his produce while the poor were labouring under all the miseries of want, and he would see Forestallers, Regraters, and all kinds of Middle-men making large profits upon it."&lt;ref name="The Times 1800 p. 2"&gt;''The Times'' (6 December 1800), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Lord Grenville]] replied: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[W]hen that great man lived, ... his book was first published at a period, previous to which there had been two or three seasons of great dearth and distress; and during those seasons there were speculators without number, who ... proposed that a certain price should be fixed on every article: but all their plans were wisely rejected, and the ''Treatise on the Wealth of Nations'', which came forward soon after, pointed out in the clearest light how absurd and futile they must have been."&lt;ref name="The Times 1800 p. 2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====19th century=====
[[File:Hon. Richard Corden, M.P - NARA - 528678.jpg|thumb|right|''The Wealth of Nations'' influenced [[Richard Cobden]]]]
The [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] MP [[Richard Cobden]] studied ''The Wealth of Nations'' as a young man; his copy is still in the library of his home at Dunford House and there are lively marginal notes on the places where Smith condemns British colonial policy. There are none on the passage about the invisible hand.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Grampp, ''The Manchester School of Economics'' (London: Oxford University Press, 1960), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Cobden campaigned for free trade in his agitation against the [[Corn Laws]]. In 1843, Cobden quoted Smith's protest against the "plain violation of the most sacred property" of every man derived from his labour.&lt;ref&gt;John Bright and J. E. Thorold Rogers (eds.), ''Speeches on Questions of Public Policy by Richard Cobden, M.P. Volume I'' (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1908), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1844, he cited Smith's opposition to slave labour&lt;ref&gt;Bright and Thorold Rogers, ''Volume I'', p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed that Smith had been misrepresented by protectionists as a monopolist.&lt;ref&gt;Bright and Thorold Rogers, ''Volume I'', pp. 104–05.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849 Cobden claimed that he had "gone through the length and breadth of this country, with Adam Smith in my hand, to advocate the principles of Free Trade." He also said he had tried "to popularise to the people of this country, and of the Continent, those arguments with which Adam Smith ... and every man who has written on this subject, have demonstrated the funding system to be injurious to mankind."&lt;ref&gt;John Bright and J. E. Thorold Rogers (eds.), ''Speeches on Questions of Public Policy by Richard Cobden, M.P. Volume II'' (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1908), pp. 399–400.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cobden believed it to be morally wrong to lend money to be spent on war.  In 1849, when ''The Times'' claimed political economists were against Cobden on this, Cobden wrote: "I can quote Adam Smith whose authority is without appeal now in intellectual circles, it gives one the basis of science upon which to raise appeals to the moral feelings."&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Hinde, ''Richard Cobden. A Victorian Outsider'' (Yale University Press, 1987), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850, when the Russian government attempted to raise a loan to cover the deficit brought about by its war against Hungary, Cobden said: "I take my stand on one of the strongest grounds in stating that Adam Smith and other great authorities on political economy are opposed to the very principle of such loans."&lt;ref&gt;Bright and Thorold Rogers, ''Volume II'', p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, during Cobden's dispute with ''The Times'' over its claims that his fellow [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] [[John Bright]] wanted to divide the land of the rich amongst the poor, Cobden read to a friend the passage in the ''Wealth of Nations'' which criticized [[primogeniture]] and [[entail]].  Cobden said that if Bright had been as plain-speaking as Smith, "how he would have been branded as an incendiary and Socialist".&lt;ref&gt;Donald Read, ''Cobden and Bright. A Victorian Political Partnership'' (Edward Arnold, 1967), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, Cobden proclaimed, "If I were five-and-twenty or thirty, ... I would take Adam Smith in hand, and I would have a League for free trade in Land just as we had a League for free trade in Corn.  You will find just the same authority in Adam Smith for the one as for the other."&lt;ref&gt;Bright and Thorold Rogers, ''Volume II'', p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Interestingly, after the British took control over occupied French North America in the Seven Years War, Charles Townshend suggested that the American colonist provide help to pay for the war debt by paying an additional taxes on tea. During this time, Adam Smith was working for Townshend and developed a relationship with Benjamin Franklin, who played a vital role in the United State's independence three months after Smith's The Wealth of Nations book was released.&lt;ref name="Constitutional rights"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Costly |first1=Andrew |title=BRIA 23 1 a Adam Smith and The Wealth of Nations |url=http://www.crf-usa.org/bill-of-rights-in-action/bria-23-1-a-adam-smith-and-the-wealth-of-nations.html |website=http://www.crf-usa.org |publisher=Constitutional Rights Foundations |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[James Madison]], in a speech given in [[United States Congress|Congress]] on 2 February 1791, cited ''The Wealth of Nations'' in opposing a national bank: "The principal disadvantages consisted in, 1st. banishing the precious metals, by substituting another medium to perform their office: This effect was inevitable. It was admitted by the most enlightened patrons of banks, particularly by Smith on the ''Wealth of Nations''."&lt;ref&gt;James Madison, ''Writings'' (The Library of America, 1999), p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]], writing to [[John Norvell]] on 14 June 1807, claimed that on "the subjects of money &amp; commerce, Smith's ''Wealth of Nations'' is the best book to be read, unless ''[[Say's Political Economy]]'' can be had, which treats the same subject on the same principles, but in a shorter compass &amp; more lucid manner."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson, ''Writings'' (The Library of America, 1984), p. 1176.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Wealth of the Nation, Seymour Fogel.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Bustling with work and activity, "The Wealth of the Nation" by [[Seymour Fogel]] is an interpretation of the theme of Social Security.]]
[[George Stigler]] attributes to Smith "the most important substantive proposition in all of economics" and foundation of [[Allocation of resources|resource-allocation]] theory. It is that, under competition, owners of resources (labour, land, and capital) will use them most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] for all uses (adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training, trust, hardship, and unemployment).&lt;ref&gt;George J. Stigler (1976). "The Successes and Failures of Professor Smith," ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', 84(6), p. 1202 (pp. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1831274 1199–1213]). Also published as Selected Papers, No. 50 [http://testwww.chicagobooth.edu/research/selectedpapers/sp50c.pdf (PDF)], Graduate School of Business, University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; He also describes Smith's theorem that "the [[division of labour]] is limited by the extent of the market" as the "core of a [[Theory of the firm|theory of the functions of firm]] and [[industrial organisation|industry]]" and a "fundamental principle of economic organisation."&lt;ref&gt;George J. Stigler, 1951. "The Division of Labor Is Limited by the Extent of the Market." ''Journal of Political Economy'', 59(3), pp. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1826433 185], 193. Reprinted in J.M.

[[Paul Samuelson]] finds in Smith's pluralist use of [[supply and demand]]—as applied to wages, rents, and profit—a valid and valuable anticipation of the [[general equilibrium]] modelling of [[Léon Walras|Walras]] a century later. Moreover, Smith's allowance for wage increases in the short and intermediate term from capital accumulation and invention added a realism missed later by Malthus, Ricardo, and Marx in their propounding a rigid subsistence-wage theory of labour supply.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Samuelson (1977). "A Modern Theorist's Vindication of Adam Smith," ''American Economic Review'', 67(1),  [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1815879 p. 42.] Reprinted in J.C. Wood, ed., ''Adam Smith: Critical Assessments'', pp. 498–509. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B8FY8mo5zX4C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA498=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In noting the last words of the ''Wealth of Nations'',
:If any of the provinces of the British empire cannot be made to contribute towards the support of the whole empire, it is surely time that Great Britain should free herself from the expence of defending those provinces in time of war, and of supporting any part of their civil or military establishments in time of peace, and endeavour to accommodate her future views and designs to the real mediocrity of her circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1776).  Bk. V: Of the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth, ch. 3 Of Public Debts, para. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Coase]] suggests that if Smith's earlier proposal of granting colonies representation in the British parliament proportional to their contributions to public revenues had been followed, "there would have been no 1776, … America would now be ruling England, and we [in America] would be today celebrating Adam Smith not simply as the author of  the ''Wealth of Nations'', but hailing him as a [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding father]]."&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Coase (1977). "The Wealth of Nations," ''Economic Inquiry'' 15(3), pp. 323–25 ([http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/file/coase%20the%20wealth%20of%20nations.pdf 309–25] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514223414/http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/file/coase%20the%20wealth%20of%20nations.pdf |date=14 May 2013 }}).

[[Mark Blaug]] argues that it was Smith's achievement to shift the burden of proof against those maintaining that the pursuit of self-interest does not achieve social good. But he notes Smith's relevant attention to definite institutional arrangements and process as disciplining self-interest to widen the scope of the market, accumulate capital, and grow income.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Blaug (1997). ''Economic Theory in Retrospect'', 5th ed., in ch. 2, sect. 19, "Adam Smith as an Economist, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4nd6alor2goC&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA59=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 59–62.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Economic anthropology|Economic anthropologist]] [[David Graeber]] argues that throughout antiquity, one can identify many different systems of credit and later monetary exchange, drawing evidence for his argument from historical and also ethnographical records, that the traditional explanation for the origins of monetary economies from primitive bartering systems, as laid out by Adam Smith, does not find empirical support.&lt;ref name=Debt&gt;{{cite book |last=Graeber |first=David |title=Debt: the first 5,000 years |year=2010 |publisher=Melville House |location=Brooklyn, NY |isbn=9781933633862}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author argues that credit systems developed as means of account long before the advent of coinage around 600 BCE, and can still be seen operating in non-monetary economies. The idea of barter, on the other hand, seems only to apply to limited exchanges between societies that had infrequent contact and often in a context of  [[endemic warfare|ritualised warfare]], rendering its conceptualisation among economists as a myth.&lt;ref name=Graeber&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonreview.net/BR37.1/david_graeber_debt_economics_occupy_wall_street.php |title=''What We Owe to Each Other'' An Interview with David Graeber, Part 1 |work=Boston Review |date=February 15, 2012 |accessdate=February 20, 2012 |author=Johnson, David V.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative explanation for the creation of economic life, the author suggests that it originally related to social currencies, closely related to non-market quotidian interactions among a community and based on the "everyday communism" that is based on mutual expectations and responsibilities among individuals. This type of economy is, then, contrasted with the moral foundations of exchange based on formal equality and reciprocity (but not necessarily leading to market relations) and hierarchy, based on clear inequalities that tend to crystallise in customs and castes.&lt;ref name=Graeber /&gt;

'''View''' or '''position''' ([[Pali]] ''{{IAST|diṭṭhi}}'', [[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|dṛṣṭi}}'') is a central idea in [[Buddhism]].{{sfn|Fuller|2005|page=1}} In Buddhist thought, a view is not a simple, abstract collection of propositions, but a charged interpretation of experience which intensely shapes and affects thought, sensation, and action.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus 2002"&gt;{{cite book|first=Dan|last=Lusthaus|title=Buddhist Phenomenology|url=http://www.khamkoo.com/uploads/9/0/0/4/9004485/buddhist_phenomenology_-_a_pholosophical_investigation_of_yogacara_buddhism_and_the_cheng_wei-shih_lun.pdf|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|page=242, n. 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having the proper mental attitude toward views is therefore considered an integral part of the Buddhist path, as sometimes correct views need to put into practice and incorrect views abandoned, and sometimes all views are seen as obstacles to enlightenment.{{sfn|Fuller|2005|pages=1–2}}

== Positions ==
[[File:Jungle Landscape.jpg|alt=jungle in India|thumb|255x255px|In describing the highly diverse intellectual landscape of his day, the Buddha is said to have referred to "the wrangling of views, the jungle of views".&lt;ref name="Harvey 2000"&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter |last=Harvey|title=Buddhist Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NoLAHXt4PRMC|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2000|pages=239–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Views are produced by and in turn produce [[sankhara|mental conditioning]]. They are symptoms of conditioning, rather than neutral alternatives individuals can dispassionately choose.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus 2002" /&gt; The Buddha, according to [[Pali Canon|early texts]], having attained the state of [[Nibbana|unconditioned mind]], is said to have "passed beyond the bondage, tie, greed, obsession, acceptance, attachment, and lust of view."{{sfn|Fuller|2005|page=2}}

Those who wish to experience [[nirvana]] must free themselves from everything binding them to the world, including philosophical and religious doctrines.&lt;ref name="Skirbekk 2001"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Gunnar|last1=Skirbekk|first2=Nils|last2=Gilje|title=A history of Western thought: from ancient Greece to the twentieth century|url=https://books.google.co.th/books?id=NoLAHXt4PRMC|edition=7th|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2001|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noble Eightfold Path#Right view|Right view]] as the first part of the Noble Eightfold Path leads ultimately not to the holding of correct views, but to a detached form of cognition.{{sfn|Fuller|2005|page=2}}

== Understanding karma ==
{{See also|Noble Eightfold Path}}
The term "right view" (''{{IAST|samyak-dṛuṣṭi}}'' / ''{{IAST|sammā-diṭṭhi}}'') or "right understanding" is basically about having a correct attitude towards one's social and religious duties. This is explained from the perspective of the system of [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]] and the [[samsara|cycle of rebirth]].{{sfn|Collins|1990|p=88}} Used in an ethical context, it entails that our actions have consequences, that death is not the end, that our actions and beliefs also have consequences after death, and that the Buddha followed and taught a successful path out of this world and [[Buddhist cosmology|the other world]] (heaven and underworld or hell).{{sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=12; 77-79}}{{sfn|Velez de Cea|2013|p=54}}{{sfn|Collins|1990|p=88}} Originating in the pre-Buddhist [[Brahmanical]] concerns with [[yajna|sacrifice rituals]] and [[Asceticism#Hinduism|asceticism]], in early texts the Buddha shifts the emphasis to a karmic perspective, which includes the entire religious life. The Buddha further describes such right view as beneficial, because whether these views are true or not, people acting on them (e.i. leading a good life) will be praised by the wise.{{sfn|Collins|1990|p=88}} They will also act in a correct way. If the views do turn out to be true, and there is a next world after death, such people will experience the good karma of what they have done when they were still alive. This is not to say that the Buddha is described as uncertain about right view: he, as well as other accomplished spiritual masters, are depicted as having "seen" these views by themselves as reality.&lt;!--p=88--&gt; Although devotees may not be able to see these truths for themselves yet, they are expected to develop a "pro-attitude" towards them.&lt;!--p=89--&gt;{{sfn|Collins|1990|pp=88–9}} Moral right view is not just considered to be adopted, however. Rather, the practitioner endeavors to live following right view, such practice will reflect on the practitioner, and will eventually lead to deeper insight into and wisdom about reality.{{sfn|Fuller|2005|p=41}}

According to Indologist Tilmann Vetter, right view came to explicitly include karma and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|Rebirth]], and the importance of the [[Four Noble Truths]], when "insight" became central to Buddhist [[soteriology]].{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=77}} This presentation of right view still plays an essential role in Theravada Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Harvey 2000" /&gt;

== Understanding doctrine ==
A second meaning of right view is an initial understanding of points of doctrine such as the [[Four Noble Truths]], [[anatman|not-self]] and [[Dependent Origination]],&lt;!--pp=89-90--&gt; combined with the intention to accept those teachings and apply them to oneself.&lt;!--pp=92, 95--&gt; Thirdly, a "supramundane" right view is also distinguished, which refers to a more refined, intuitive understanding produced by meditative practice. Thus, a gradual path of self-development is described, in which the meaning of right view gradually develops.&lt;!--pp=91-2--&gt; In the beginning, right view can only lead to a good rebirth, but at the highest level, right view can help the practitioner to attain to liberation from the cycle of existence.&lt;!--p=120--&gt;{{sfn|Collins|1990|pp=89–92, 95, 120}}

Buddhist Studies scholar Paul Fuller believes that although there are differences between the different levels of right view, all levels aim for emotional detachment. The wisdom of right view at the moral level leads to see the world without [[lobha|greed]], [[Dvesha|hatred]] and [[moha (Buddhism)|delusion]].{{sfn|Fuller|2005|p=42}}

Misunderstanding objects as self is not only seen as a form of wrong view, but also as a manifestation of desire, requiring a change in character.{{sfn|Collins|1990|p=119}}

== No views ==
The Buddha of the [[early Buddhism|early discourses]] often refers to the negative effect of attachment to speculative or fixed views, dogmatic opinions, or even correct views if not known to be true by personal verification. In describing the highly diverse intellectual landscape of his day, he is said to have referred to "the wrangling of views, the jungle of views".&lt;ref name="Harvey 2000" /&gt; He assumed an unsympathetic attitude toward speculative and religious thought in general.&lt;ref name="Skirbekk 2001"/&gt; In a set of poems in the early text [[Sutta Nipata]], the Buddha states that he himself has no viewpoint. According to Steven Collins, these poems distill the style of teaching that was concerned less with the content of views and theories than with the psychological states of those who hold them.{{sfn|Collins|1990|p=129}}{{elucidate|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Espionage den04 33.png|thumb|right|A [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) document about Afansayev seized from the US Embassy in Tehran in 1979 by Iranian students]]

'''Viktor Grigoryevich Afanasyev''' ({{lang-ru|Ви́ктор Григо́рьевич Афана́сьев}}; 18 November 1922&lt;ref name="Who Was Who"&gt;{{cite book|title=Who Was Who in America, 1993-1996, vol. 11|year=1996|publisher=Marquis Who's Who|location=New Providence, N.J.|isbn=0837902258|page=2|chapter=Afanasyev, Viktor Grigoryevich}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 10 April 1994) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] public figure, remembered for his work as a [[philosophy]] academic, politician, and news editor. Afanasyev was editor-in-chief (1974-1975) of the journal ''[[Kommunist]]'' and  deputy editor (1968–1974) and editor-in-chief (1976–1989) of ''[[Pravda]]''.

Moderately critical of Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and still more so of rising independent politician [[Boris Yeltsin]] in his capacity as editor, Afanasyev was dismissed from his high position at ''Pravda'' after a period of falling circulation and a negative official reaction to the newspaper's highlighting Boris Yeltsin's troubles with [[alcohol]] during the [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev administration]] in 1989 and spent the remaining half-decade of his life working for the national [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences in Moscow]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in 1922 in [[Aktanyshsky District|Aktanysh]] in the [[Tatar ASSR]] (now [[Russia]]'s [[Republic of Tatarstan]]) in 1922, Afanasyev joined the [[Red Army]] in 1940 and served with the Soviet paratroopers in the 1940s and [[World War II]], remaining in the armed forces until 1953. He was awarded his first university degree for his independent completion of the required curriculum of the [[Chita Pedagogical Institute]] in [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai]] while still serving in the Soviet military.

===Academic and public figure===
Afanasyev first became a professional instructor upon leaving the Soviet Army in 1953 and continued concentrate his professional interest on teaching and administrative appointments in academia into the 1960s and 1970s. His appointments during this period included teaching as an instructor in Soviet [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory at the [[Chelyabninsk Pedogagical Institute]] and a position with the philosophical branch of the [[Academy of Social Sciences of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. He authored a range of papers and books on philosophical subjects in the 1960s and 1970s. His [[dissertation]] for a ''[[Doktor nauk]]'' degree, a work concerned with issues pertinent to both [[philosophy]] and [[biology]] on a theoretical level, was accepted in 1964.

Afanasyev was elected a corresponding member of the [[Academy of Sciences of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] in 1972 and advanced to become a full member in 1981.&lt;ref name = "Afanasyev - GSE"&gt;[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article082245.html "Афанасьев Виктор Григорьевич"] ("Afanasyev, Viktor Grigoryevich"). ''Большая Советская Энциклопедия'' (''[[The Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]''), Third Edition. Ed. [[Alexander Prokhorov]]. Moscow: Soviet Encyclopedia, 1978. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1976.&lt;ref name = "Afanasyev - GSE"/&gt;

Afanasyev became deputy editor of ''[[Pravda]]'' (a newspaper given the prestige of serving as the "official voice of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]") in 1968. He remained as deputy editor with ''Pravda'' until joining the ''[[Kommunist]]'' (regarded as the theoretical and political organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) for a brief period as [[chief editor]] in 1974-1975. He returned to become chief editor of ''Pravda'' in 1975, remaining with the newspaper in the same capacity until 1989.

Afanasyev was a Deputy (representative) of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], serving from 1974 to 1979. He was twice elected as a Deputy of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]], serving from 1979 to 1989.

====As ''Pravda'' editor====
Afansyev's period as editor of ''Pravda'' saw a lukewarm response to [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s changes in the late 1980s, vacillating between support for Gorbachev's policies and for those of his opponents in the leading circles of the party, while ''Pravda'''s readership witnessed a precipitous decline, dropping by around half in the course of Gorbachev's first four years at the helm of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name = "TIME-Oct-1989"&gt;Doerner, William R., and John Kohan. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958905,00.html "Soviet Union: Dear Editor: You're Fired. Signed, Mikhail Gorbachev"]. ''[[TIME Magazine]]''. 30 October 1989. Retrieved 18 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[TIME]]'' story of October 1989 also recalled that Afanasyev "suffered a nasty embarrassment last month, when ''Pravda'' reprinted a lurid dispatch from an [[Italy|Italian]] newspaper claiming that [[reformist]] [[Supreme Soviet]] Deputy [[Boris Yeltsin]] boozed and shopped his way through a tour of the [[United States|U.S.]]"&lt;ref name = "TIME-Oct-1989"/&gt; The report noted that the newspaper was pressured into publishing an apology, although recorded video subsequently broadcast over the Soviet television "appeared to show Yeltsin at least mildly [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]]."&lt;ref name = "TIME-Oct-1989"/&gt;

Afanasyev was dismissed in favor of Gorbachev ally [[Ivan Frolov (journalist)|Ivan Frolov]] under the guise of requesting a "transfer to scientific work" during the subsequent fallout.&lt;ref name = "TIME-Oct-1989"/&gt; He spent the remaining half-decade of his life absorbed in work for the Academy of Sciences of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] since 1991).

He died in [[Moscow]] in 1994.

==Recognition==
Afanasyev was well-recognized for his service by the Soviet state: among the honors awarded him were two [[Order of the October Revolution|Orders of the October Revolution]].&lt;ref name = "Afanasyev - GSE"/&gt; He was a laureate of the [[USSR State Prize]] in 1983.&lt;ref name="ISPR"&gt;[http://www.ispr.ru/BIBLIO/biblio68.html "В.

A thirty-six page work devoted to the achievements of Afanasyev's life was published by the [[Institute of Socio-Political Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences]] in 2002, in honor of what would have been Afanasyev's 80th birthday.&lt;ref name = "ISPR"/&gt;

[[File:Duncan, William – The elements of logic, 1811 – BEIC 769468.jpg|thumb|''The elements of logic'', 1811]]

'''William Duncan''' (1717 in [[Aberdeen]] &amp;ndash; 1760 in Aberdeen) was a Scottish natural philosopher and classicist, professor of natural philosophy at [[Marischal College, Aberdeen]].

Educated at Marischal College, Aberdeen, he was appointed professor of natural philosophy there in 1752. His popular ''Elements of Logic'', first published in [[Robert Dodsley]]'s ''The Preceptor'' (2 vols, London, 1748), combined a [[John Locke|Lockean]] [[theory of knowledge]] with [[Syllogism|syllogistic]] [[logic]].&lt;ref name=CHECP&gt;{{Citation | last=Haakonssen | first=Knud | year=2006 | contribution=Duncan, William | editor-last=Haakonssen | editor-first=Knud | title=The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Philosophy | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=2 | pages=1166}}&lt;/ref&gt; He translated the [[Caesar's Commentaries (disambiguation)|Commentaries of Julius Caesar]] and orations of [[Cicero]]; at his death, translations of [[Plutarch]]'s [[Parallel Lives|Lives]] and a continuation of [[Thomas Blackwell (scholar)|Thomas Blackwell]]'s ''Court of Augustus'' were left unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;John Westby-Gibson, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/823 ‘Duncan, William (1717–1760)’], rev.
