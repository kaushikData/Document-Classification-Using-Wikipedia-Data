Comet '''252P/LINEAR''' is a [[List of periodic comets|periodic]] [[comet]] and [[near-Earth object]] discovered by the [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research|LINEAR]] survey on April 7, 2000. The comet is an Earth-Jupiter family comet, meaning that it passes quite close to both [[Earth]] and [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt; This causes its orbit to be [[Orbital Perturbation|perturbed]] frequently on an astronomical timescale.

The nominal orbit of 252P/LINEAR [2001] (K102/1) was thrown into the near-Earth region by Jupiter in February 1785,&lt;ref name=horizons/&gt; before which it had a perihelion near that of Mars (1774–1785). Prior to this, it had a perihelion in the asteroid belt (1607–1690) and even further before was most likely a [[Jupiter Trojan]].{{cn|date=April 2017}} Since its Jupiter [[Minimum orbit intersection distance|MOID]] is currently 0.2 [[Astronomical unit|AU]],&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt; Jupiter remains the primary factor in its orbital disruption.

At some point before 1860, 252P/LINEAR separated from a secondary, smaller fragment discovered in January 2016, designated P/2016 BA14 (PANSTARRS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=2016BA14;cad=1 JPL SBDB: 2016BA14]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20160318"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Agle |first1=DC |last2=Brown |first2=Dwayne |last3=Cantillo |first3=Laurie |title=A 'Tail' of Two Comets |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6164 |date=18 March 2016 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nucleus of the secondary is 60–200 meters wide, half that of the primary.{{Dubious |reason=Radar images of P/2016 BA14 have shown that it has a diameter of 1 km, much larger than 252P (https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6180)|date=October 2017}} 252P/LINEAR will get as close as 0.0356&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] (13.9&amp;nbsp;[[Lunar distance (astronomy)|LD]]) to Earth on 21 March 2016 and P/2016 BA14 (PANSTARRS) will get as close as 0.0237&amp;nbsp;AU (9.2&amp;nbsp;LD) to Earth on 22 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/ca/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 4, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307125729/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/ca/ |archivedate=March 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated meteor shower==
252P/LINEAR is predicted to perhaps make a weak new meteor shower during its 2016 approach. [[Peter Jenniskens]] and Jeremie
Vaubaillon calculated that possible meteors from this comet would radiate from the constellation of [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]], south of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], from a radiant at R.A. = 77.0 deg, Decl. = -16.3 deg., with a slow geocentric velocity of Vg = 11.1&amp;nbsp;km/s on March 28 and 29, when Earth reaches the comet orbit. Rates will be low. There are no encounters with the dust trails created since A.D. 1850, but instead a diffuse cloud of perturbed meteoroids ejected during 1894-1926 is calculated to be in Earth's path (see CBET telegram 4267).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/iau/cbet/004200/CBET004267.txt |format=TXT |title=COMET 252P/LINEAR |website=Cbat.eps.harvard.edu |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quan-Zhi Ye calculated that possible meteors from comet P/2016 BA14 (PANSTARRS) would radiate from the constellation [[Columba (constellation)|Columba]], south of [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]] during the late UT hours of March 20. The radiant is at R.A. = 82 deg, Decl. = -39 deg, with geocentric velocity Vg = 14.1&amp;nbsp;km/s. Meteoroids ejected since A.D. 1750 were studied, with also no dust trail encounters found in 2016 (see CBET telegram 4259).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/iau/cbet/004200/CBET004259.txt |format=TXT |title=POSSIBLE METEOR ACTIVITY FROM COMET P/2016 BA14 |website=Cbat.eps.harvard.edu |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meteor shower has been observed with a similar orbit to 252P/LINEAR, previously known as the March Lyncids, in the constellation Lynx. It is not known for certain if the shower is related to the comet.

==P/2016 BA14==
{{main|P/2016 BA14}}
[[P/2016 BA14]] was radar imaged at distance of 2.2 million miles (9 lunar distances) during a flyby of Earth in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/32398-flyby-comet-was-way-bigger-than-thought.html|title=Flyby Comet Was WAY Bigger Than Thought|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled the size of the nucleus to be calculated to be about 3000 to 3300 feet (1 km) in diameter, which was bigger than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/32398-flyby-comet-was-way-bigger-than-thought.html|title=Flyby Comet Was WAY Bigger Than Thought|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BA 14 had unique history in that when it was discovered in January 2016 by a [[PanSTARRS]] telescope, it was thought to be an asteroid and went by a provisional [[minor planet designation]] 2016 BA14.. &lt;reF&gt;[https://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/p2016-ba14-closest-comet-in-almost-250-years03162016/]&lt;/reF&gt; An astronomer then realized the body's orbit was very similar to 252P/LINEAR , which lead to a follow up observation by the [[Discovery Channel Telescope]].&lt;reF&gt;[https://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/p2016-ba14-closest-comet-in-almost-250-years03162016/]&lt;/reF&gt; The body showed a tail, identifying it as a probable comet and then named P/2016 BA14.&lt;reF&gt;[https://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/p2016-ba14-closest-comet-in-almost-250-years03162016/]&lt;/reF&gt;

In 2016, following the 2015 summit, the 25zero project grew into a documentary film production, with a broader focus on both the glaciers themselves and the communities that live near them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1219719/news?ref_=nm_nwr_1|title=Adelaide Film Festival names Jim Bettison and Helen James Award recipients|last=|first=|date=22 September 2016|website=IMDB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://if.com.au/adelaide-film-festival-names-jim-bettison-and-helen-james-award-recipients/|title=Adelaide Film Festival names Jim Bettison and Helen James Award recipients|last=|first=|date=22 September 2016|website=IF.com.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naming the project ==
While many mountains straddle the equator, only 25 of these have a glacier at their peak (defined at the time of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] adoption in 1992); hence, 25 mountains at zero latitude. In reality, however, there are about three degrees (some 320&amp;nbsp;km) of leniency in the inclusions, both North and South.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://condesan.org/mtnforum/fr/content/glaciers-these-25-mountains-will-completely-melt-25-years|title=Glaciers on These 25 Mountains Will Completely Melt in 25 Years|last=|first=|date=5 October 2017|website=Mountain Forum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the name wordplays on estimates that within an average of 25 years, all these glaciers will have retreated to zero ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.roundsquare.org/news/news/tim-jarvis-appointed-as-first-idealist-for-environment/|title=Tim Jarvis appointed as first Idealist for Environmental Understanding|last=Westgarth|first=Rachael|date=18 November 2017|website=Round Square|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/rnafternoons/climbing-for-the-climate/6963888|title=Climbing for the Climate|last=Michael|first=Mackenzie|date=23 November 2017|work=ABC Radio National|access-date=16 September 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the project team, this is important because melting ice is an excellent proxy indicator for climate change impacts. While much of the public global interest centres around ice-melt at the Earth's poles, relatively little attention is given to the ice at more unexpected locations, such as in the high-altitude tropics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2015/11/05/25zero-tim-jarvis_n_8468668.html|title=Adventurer Tim Jarvis Creates 25Zero To Raise Awareness About Disappearing Equatorial Glaciers|last=Dengate|first=Cayla|date=15 July 2017|work=Huffington Post Australia|access-date=16 September 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1992, four of the 25 mountains originally included have 'lost' their glacier completely.

== Methodology ==
The notional baseline date for mountains included in the 25zero project are those mountains that had glaciers in 1992, when the [[United Nations|UN]] started to "began to climate change (and acting on it) seriously".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.25zero.com|title=25zero Origins|last=Jarvis|first=Tim|date=1 October 2016|website=25zero|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several years of [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UNFCCC]] processes, the Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php|title=Kyoto Protocol|last=|first=|date=2014|website=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, 25 mountains at the equator had glaciers. The project uses climbing expeditions to the various mountain ranges to support published glaciology data, effectively tracking the status of the equatorial glaciers against the backdrop of the UN timeline on climate change action.

== Climbing team ==
The 25zero climbing team has varied over time depending on the expedition, although the original 2014 team comprised:

* [[Tim Jarvis]]
* [[Ed Wardle]]
* Heidi Sand
* [[Vanessa O'Brien]]
* [[Khoo Swee Chiow]]
* Barry 'Baz' Gray

The up-to-date team are listed on the project website, [https://25zero.com 25zero].

== Mountains ==
While the 25zero mountains are spread around the world, more than half of them are located in the South American [[Andes]] mountain range, and chiefly in [[Ecuador]].

According to some glaciologists, contradictory information exists in the literature as to whether glaciers on Sangay and Cerro Ayapungo (locally known as Soroche) are true glaciers or only permanent snow (névé or firn).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Francou|first=Bernard|last2=Ramirez|first2=Edson|last3=Cáceres|first3=Bolivar|last4=Mendoza|first4=Javier|date=|year=2000|title=Glacier evolution in the tropical Andes during the last decades of the 20th century: Chacaltaya, Bolivia, and Antizana, Ecuador|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1579/0044-7447-29.7.416|journal=AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment|volume=29|issue=7|pages=416–422|via=BioOne Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The climbs ==

=== 2015 ===
In December 2015, to coincide with the COP21 climate change talks in Paris, multiple 25zero teams scaled a number of the 25zero peaks. Jarvis and a core team summited Carstensz Pyramid (4,884&amp;nbsp;m) in Indonesia, and Mount Stanley (5,109&amp;nbsp;m) and Mount Baker (4,844&amp;nbsp;m) in Uganda. Simultaneously, other 25zero teams climbed Mount Kenya (5,199&amp;nbsp;m), Kilimanjaro (5,895&amp;nbsp;m) and a number of Ecuadorian peaks. Footage, observations and stories from these climbs were transmitted to a government-endorsed press conference for 25zero at COP21 in Paris.

=== 2016 ===
In 2016, Jarvis and colleague Royal Marines Sergeant Major Barry Gray went on an information-gathering and mountain-climbing expedition to Ecuador for the 25zero project. They successfully summited three glaciated mountains in Ecuador: Illiniza Sur (5,248&amp;nbsp;m), Antisana (5,704&amp;nbsp;m) and Chimborazo (6,310&amp;nbsp;m). The trip coincided with the ongoing UN climate change talks in Marrakech ([[COP22]]).

=== 2017 ===
In September 2017, Jarvis together with Ecuadorian climbers Edgar Parra and Ethan Sigle summited Carihuazo (5,018&amp;nbsp;m), and climbed and documented glacier decline on Cayambe (5,790&amp;nbsp;m) and Cotopaxi (5,897&amp;nbsp;m).

=== 2018 ===
In June 2018, Jarvis assembled a large climbing team, including a film crew and several social media and mountaineering identities, to undertake climbs in East Africa, including Kilimanjaro, Mount Speke, and Mount Stanley.

== Awards ==
25zero (and the project team) has received a number of awards for contribution to conservation and public education.

=== Australian Geographic Society, 2016 ===
The project has received citation through the annual awards of the [[Australian Geographic]] Society, with project leader Tim Jarvis receiving the title of Conservationist of the Year in 2016, for his work on 25zero.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2016/10/winners-of-australian-geographic-societys-2016-awards|title=Winners of the 2016 Australian Geographic Society Awards|last=|first=|date=27 October 2016|website=Australian Geographic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society had also supported the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/adventure/2015/11/tim-jarvis-25zero-intro|title=Tim Jarvis 25zero expedition: background|last=|first=|date=27 November 2015|website=Australian Geographic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''aethrioscope''' (or æthrioscope) is a meteorological device invented by [[John Leslie (physicist)|Sir John Leslie]] in 1818 for measuring the chilling effect of a clear sky.  The name is from the Greek word for clear – ''αίθριος''.&lt;ref name=DSLA&gt;{{citation |title=A Dictionary of Science, Literature, &amp; Art |volume=1 |author=William Thomas Brande, George William Cox |publisher=[[Longmans, Green &amp; Co.]]|year=1867 |page=33 |chapter=Æthrioscope}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of a metallic cup standing upon a tall hollow pedestal, with a differential [[thermometer]] placed so that one of its bulbs is in the focus of the paraboloid formed by the cavity of the cup.  The interior of the cup is highly polished and is kept covered by a plate of metal, being opened when an observation is made.  The second bulb is always screened from the sky and so is not affected by the radiative effect of the clear sky, the action of which is concentrated upon the first bulb.  The contraction of the air in the second bulb by its sudden exposure to a clear sky causes the liquid in the stem to rise.&lt;ref name=DSLA/&gt;

The device will respond in a contrary fashion when exposed to heat radiation and so may be used as a [[pyrometer]] too.&lt;ref name=DSLA/&gt;

{{distinguish|text=[[Attitude (disambiguation)|Attitude]]}}

'''Altitude''' or '''[[height]]''' (sometimes known as 'depth') is defined based on the context in which it is used (aviation, geometry, geographical survey, sport, atmospheric pressure, and many more). As a general definition, altitude is a distance measurement, usually in the vertical or "up" direction, between a reference [[datum (geodesy)|datum]] and a point or object. The reference datum also often varies according to the context. Although the term altitude is commonly used to mean the [[height above sea level]] of a location, in [[geography]] the term [[elevation]] is often preferred for this usage.

Vertical distance measurements in the "down" direction are commonly referred to as [[:wikt:depth|depth]].

== In aviation==
{{anchor|Aviation}}
{{see also|Sea level#Aviation}}
[[Image:vertical distances.svg|thumb|300px|Vertical distance comparison]]
In aviation, the term altitude can have several meanings, and is always qualified by  explicitly adding a modifier (e.g. "true altitude"), or implicitly through the context of the communication.  Parties exchanging altitude information must be clear which definition is being used.&lt;ref name="AFM_51-40"&gt;{{cite book | date=1 December 1989 | title=Air Navigation |publisher=Department of the Air Force| id=AFM 51-40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aviation altitude is measured using either [[mean sea level]] (MSL) or local ground level (above ground level, or AGL) as the reference datum.

[[Pressure altitude]] divided by 100 feet (30&amp;nbsp;m) is the [[flight level]], and is used above the [[transition altitude]] ({{convert|18000|ft|m}} in the US, but may be as low as {{convert|3000|ft|m}} in other jurisdictions); so when the altimeter reads 18,000&amp;nbsp;ft on the standard pressure setting the aircraft is said to be at "Flight level 180". When flying at a flight level, the altimeter is always set to standard pressure (29.92&amp;nbsp;[[Inches of mercury|inHg]] or 1013.25&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|hPa]]).

On the flight deck, the definitive instrument for measuring altitude is the pressure [[altimeter]], which is an [[barometer#Aneroid barometers|aneroid barometer]] with a front face indicating distance (feet or metres) instead of [[atmospheric pressure]].

There are several types of aviation altitude:

* '''Indicated altitude''' is the reading on the altimeter when it is set to the [[QNH|local barometric pressure at mean sea level]]. In UK aviation radiotelephony usage, ''the vertical distance of a level, a point or an object considered as a point, measured from mean sea level''; this is referred to over the radio as ''' altitude'''.(see [[QNH]])&lt;ref name="CAP413"&gt;{{cite book | date=1 January 1995 | title=Radiotelephony Manual |publisher=UK Civil Aviation Authority| id=CAP413| isbn=0-86039-601-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Absolute altitude''' is the height of the aircraft above the terrain over which it is flying. It can be measured using a [[radar altimeter]] (or "absolute altimeter").&lt;ref name="AFM_51-40" /&gt; Also referred to as "radar height" or feet/metres [[Above Ground Level|above ground level]] (AGL).
* '''True altitude''' is the actual elevation above [[mean sea level]].  It is indicated altitude corrected for non-standard temperature and pressure.
* '''Height''' is the elevation above a ground reference point, commonly the terrain elevation. In UK aviation radiotelephony usage, ''the vertical distance of a level, a point or an object considered as a point, measured from a specified datum''; this is referred to over the radio as '''height''', where the specified datum is the airfield elevation (see [[Mean sea level pressure|QFE]])&lt;ref name="CAP413" /&gt;
* '''Pressure altitude''' is the elevation above a standard datum air-pressure plane (typically, 1013.25 millibars or 29.92" Hg). Pressure altitude is used to indicate "flight level" which is the standard for altitude reporting in the U.S. in Class A airspace (above roughly 18,000 feet). Pressure altitude and indicated altitude are the same when the altimeter setting is 29.92" Hg or 1013.25 millibars.
*'''[[Density altitude]]''' is the altitude corrected for non-ISA [[International Standard Atmosphere]] atmospheric conditions. Aircraft performance depends on density altitude, which is affected by barometric pressure, humidity and temperature. On a very hot day, density altitude at an airport (especially one at a high elevation) may be so high as to preclude takeoff, particularly for helicopters or a heavily loaded aircraft.

These types of altitude can be explained more simply as various ways of measuring the altitude:
*'''Indicated altitude''' – the altitude shown on the altimeter.
*'''Absolute altitude''' – altitude in terms of the distance above the ground directly below
*'''True altitude''' – altitude in terms of elevation above sea level
*'''Height''' – altitude in terms of the distance above a certain point
*'''Pressure altitude''' – the [[air pressure]] in terms of altitude in the International Standard Atmosphere
*'''Density altitude''' – the density of the air in terms of altitude in the International Standard Atmosphere in the air

==In atmospheric studies==

===Atmospheric regions===
The [[Earth's atmosphere]] is divided into several altitude regions. These regions start and finish at varying heights depending on season and distance from the poles.  The altitudes stated below are averages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Layers of the Atmosphere |work=JetStream, the National Weather Service Online Weather School | publisher=National Weather Service | url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/srh/jetstream/atmos/layers.htm | accessdate=22 December 2005| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051219190158/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/srh/jetstream/atmos/layers.htm| archivedate= 19 December 2005 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Troposphere]]: surface to {{convert|8000|m|mi}} at the poles, {{convert|18000|m|miles}} at the [[Equator]], ending at the Tropopause
* [[Stratosphere]]: Troposphere to {{convert|50|km|mi}}
* [[Mesosphere]]: Stratosphere to {{convert|85|km|mi}}
* [[Thermosphere]]: Mesosphere to {{convert|675|km|mi}}
* [[Exosphere]]: Thermosphere to {{convert|10000|km|mi}}

The [[Kármán line]], at an altitude of {{convert|100|km|mi}} above [[sea level]], by convention defines represents the demarcation between the atmosphere and [[outer space|space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.org/icare-records/100km-altitude-boundary-for-astronautics|title=The 100 km Boundary for Astronautics|author=Dr. S. Sanz Fernández de Córdoba|publisher=[[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]]|date=2004-06-24|accessdate=2014-05-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/618QHms8h?url=http://www.fai.org/astronautics/100km.asp|archivedate=22 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thermosphere and exosphere (along with the higher parts of the mesosphere) are regions of the atmosphere that are conventionally defined as space.

===High altitude and low pressure===
{{anchor|High altitude and low air pressure}}
Regions on the [[Earth]]'s surface (or in its atmosphere) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as '''high altitude'''. High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at {{convert|8000|ft|meters|order=flip}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=websterMed&gt;{{cite book|title=Webster's New World Medical Dictionary|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8578|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-18928-3|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ismmed.org/np_altitude_tutorial.htm |title=An Altitude Tutorial |publisher=International Society for Mountain Medicine |accessdate=2011-06-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719194849/http://www.ismmed.org/np_altitude_tutorial.htm |archivedate=19 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MedicalProblems/&gt;

At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.&lt;ref name=nova&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/everest/exposure/pressure.html|title=Atmospheric pressure|work=NOVA Online Everest|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=23 January 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090125053918/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/everest/exposure/pressure.html| archivedate= 25 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature profile===
The temperature profile of the atmosphere is a result of an interaction between [[radiation]] and [[convection]]. Sunlight in the [[visible spectrum]] hits the ground and heats it. The ground then heats the air at the surface. If [[radiation]] were the only way to transfer heat from the ground to space, the [[greenhouse effect]] of gases in the atmosphere would keep the ground at roughly {{convert|333|K|C F}}, and the temperature would decay exponentially with height.&lt;ref name=goodywilson&gt;{{cite book|first1=Richard M.|last1=Goody|first2=James C.G.|last2=Walker|title=Atmospheres|chapter=Atmospheric Temperatures|chapterurl=http://lasp.colorado.edu/~bagenal/3720/GoodyWalker/AtmosCh3sm.pdf|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when air is hot, it tends to expand, which lowers its density. Thus, hot air tends to rise and transfer heat upward. This is the process of [[convection]]. Convection comes to equilibrium when a parcel of air at a given altitude has the same density as its surroundings. Air is a poor conductor of heat, so a parcel of air will rise and fall without exchanging heat. This is known as an [[adiabatic process]], which has a characteristic pressure-temperature curve. As the pressure gets lower, the temperature decreases. The rate of decrease of temperature with elevation is known as the [[adiabatic lapse rate]], which is approximately 9.8&amp;nbsp;°C per kilometer (or 5.4&amp;nbsp;°F per 1000&amp;nbsp;feet) of altitude.&lt;ref name=goodywilson/&gt;

Note that the presence of water in the atmosphere complicates the process of convection. Water vapor contains latent [[heat of vaporization]]. As air rises and cools, it eventually becomes [[Dew point|saturated]] and cannot hold its quantity of water vapor. The water vapor condenses (forming [[cloud]]s), and releases heat, which changes the lapse rate from the [[dry adiabatic lapse rate]] to the [[moist adiabatic lapse rate]] (5.5&amp;nbsp;°C per kilometer or 3&amp;nbsp;°F per 1000&amp;nbsp;feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meteorologytraining.tpub.com/14312/css/14312_47.htm |title=Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate |publisher=tpub.com |accessdate=2016-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603041448/http://meteorologytraining.tpub.com/14312/css/14312_47.htm |archivedate=3 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As an average, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines an [[international standard atmosphere]] (ISA) with a temperature [[lapse rate]] of 6.49&amp;nbsp;°C per kilometer (3.56&amp;nbsp;°F per 1,000&amp;nbsp;feet).&lt;ref name="ICAO 1993"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=[[International Civil Aviation Organization]]|title=Manual of the ICAO Standard Atmosphere (extended to 80 kilometres (262 500 feet))|id=Doc 7488-CD|edition=Third|year=1993|isbn=92-9194-004-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual lapse rate can vary by altitude and by location.

Finally, note that only the [[troposphere]] (up to approximately {{convert|11|km|ft}} of altitude) in the Earth's atmosphere undergoes notable convection; in the [[stratosphere]], there is little vertical convection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scied.ucar.edu/shortcontent/stratosphere-overview|title=The stratosphere: overview|publisher=UCAR|accessdate=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For athletes, high altitude produces two contradictory effects on performance. For explosive events (sprints up to 400 metres, [[long jump]], [[triple jump]]) the reduction in atmospheric pressure signifies less atmospheric resistance, which generally results in improved athletic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ward-Smith|year=1983|title=The influence of aerodynamic and biomechanical factors on long jump performance|journal=Journal of Biomechanics|volume=16|pages=655–658|doi=10.1016/0021-9290(83)90116-1|pmid=6643537|first1=AJ|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For endurance events (races of 5,000 metres or more) the predominant effect is the reduction in oxygen which generally reduces the athlete's performance at high altitude. Sports organizations acknowledge the effects of altitude on performance: the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF), for example, marks record performances achieved at an altitude greater than {{convert|1000|m|ft}} with the letter "A".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaaf.net/mm/Document/06/32/50/63250_PDF_English.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LJKytwwS?url=http://www.iaaf.net/mm/Document/06/32/50/63250_PDF_English.pdf |archivedate=22 November 2013 |title=IAAF World Indoor Lists 2012 |date=2012-03-09 |publisher=IAAF Statistics Office |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletes also can take advantage of altitude acclimatization to increase their performance. The same changes that help the body cope with high altitude increase performance back at sea level.&lt;ref name="pmid16497842"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wehrlin|first1=JP|last2=Zuest|first2=P|last3=Hallén|first3=J|last4=Marti|first4=B |title=Live high—train low for 24 days increases hemoglobin mass and red cell volume in elite endurance athletes |journal=J.

===Other organisms===
{{main|Organisms at high altitude}}
Decreased oxygen availability and decreased temperature make life at high altitude challenging. Despite these environmental conditions, many species have been successfully [[high-altitude adaptation|adapted at high altitudes]]. Animals have developed physiological adaptations to enhance oxygen uptake and delivery to tissues which can be used to sustain metabolism. The strategies used by animals to adapt to high altitude depend on their [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[phylogeny]]. For example, small mammals face the challenge of maintaining body heat in cold temperatures, due to their small volume to surface area ratio. As oxygen is used as a source of metabolic heat production, the hypobaric hypoxia at high altitudes is problematic.

There is also a general trend of smaller body sizes and lower [[species richness]] at high altitudes, likely due to lower oxygen partial pressures.&lt;ref name=macroinvertrichness&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobsen|first=Dean|title=Low oxygen pressure as a driving factor for the altitudinal decline in taxon richness of stream macroinvertebrates|journal=Oecologia|volume=154|pages=795–807|doi=10.1007/s00442-007-0877-x|issue=4|pmid=17960424|date=24 September 2007|bibcode=2008Oecol.154..795J}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors may decrease [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]] in high altitude habitats, meaning there will be less energy available for consumption, growth, and activity.&lt;ref name="trout"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rasmussen|first1=Joseph B.|first2=Michael D.|last2=Robinson|first3=Alice|last3=Hontela|first4=Daniel D.|last4=Heath|title=Metabolic traits of westslope cutthroat trout, introduced rainbow trout and their hybrids in an ecotonal hybrid zone along an elevation gradient|journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=105|pages=56–72|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2011.01768.x|date=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some species, such as birds,thrive at high altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCracken|first1=K.

The subject of '''birth aboard aircraft and ships''' is one with a long history in [[public international law]]. The law on the subject is complex, because various [[Sovereign state|states]] apply differing principles of [[nationality]], namely ''[[jus soli]]'' and ''[[jus sanguinis]]'', to varying degrees and with varying qualifications.

==Historical background==
Before the 1961 convention, quite a number of states expressly provided, in their laws, that [[childbirth|births]] and [[death]]s aboard an [[aircraft]] registered to that state are considered to have occurred on national territory, and thus the nationality laws of that territory apply. One such was § 32(5) of the [[British Nationality Act 1948]].
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

==Contemporary laws==
Under the 1944 [[Convention on International Civil Aviation]], articles 17&amp;ndash;21, all aircraft have the nationality of the state in which they are registered, and may not have multiple nationalities. The law of the aircraft's nationality is applicable on the aircraft. However, nationality laws of any country already apply everywhere, since it is for each country to determine who are its nationals. So this convention has no effect on nationality laws. The convention does not say that a birth on a country's aircraft is to be treated as a birth in that country for the purposes of nationality.

Under the [[1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness]], for the purposes of determining the obligations under the convention, a birth on a ship or aircraft in international waters or airspace shall be treated as a birth in the country of the ship or aircraft's registration. However, the convention applies only to births where the child would otherwise be stateless. Since in most cases a child would be covered by one or more countries' [[jus sanguinis]] at birth (getting the same citizenship as its parents), this convention rarely comes into play. In addition, there are still very few member states that are party to the 1961 convention.

{{globalise/US|date=March 2017}}

===Canada===
Children born in Canadian airspace are automatically extended Canadian citizenship, but birth in or over international waters is assessed on a case-by-case basis. Various factors are assessed in determining citizenship at birth, parentage being the most important factor. But being born in a Canadian-registered vehicle would establish a connection with Canada which would probably be taken into account, if application was made to have the person declared a Canadian citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/air-born-will-baby-delivered-mid-flight-get-canadian-citizenship-1.2368565 |title=Air-born: Will baby delivered mid-flight get Canadian citizenship? |author=Josh Elliot |date=May 11, 2015 |work=CTV News |accessdate=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Birthright citizenship in the United States of America|United States nationality law}}
U.S. law holds that natural persons born on foreign ships docked at U.S. ports or born within the limit of U.S. [[territorial waters]] are U.S. citizens. An important exception to this rule is that children born to people who (in line with the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]]) are not "subject to the jurisdiction" of the United States (e.g., foreign [[diplomat]]s accredited with the [[United States Department of State]] or invading foreign enemy forces) are not automatically U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Multistate and Multinational Estate Planning|edition=Third|author=Jeffrey A. Schoenblum|pages=9–56|date=2006|publisher=CCH|isbn=0-8080-8950-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a common misconception to the contrary, birth on board a U.S.-flagged ship, airliner, or military vessel outside of the 12-nautical mile (22.2&amp;nbsp;km/ 13-13/16 st. mi.) limit is not considered to be a birth on U.S. territory, and the principle of ''[[jus soli]]'' thus does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fam.state.gov/FAM/08FAM/08FAM030101.html#M301_1_3 Foreign Affairs Manual - 8 FAM 301.1 Acquisition by Birth in the United States]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the question of a child's citizenship, there is also a question of how to report "Place of Birth" for children born in transit.  US State Department guidance instructs that a child born in international waters should have their place of birth listed as "AT SEA", while those born in the territorial waters of any country would list the name of that country.&lt;ref name="USGuidance"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://fam.state.gov/FAM/08FAM/08FAM040304.html#M403_4_4_B|title=U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual - 8 FAM 403.4 (U) Place of Birth|publisher=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A child born in flight in a region where no country claims sovereignty would list their place of birth as "IN THE AIR".&lt;ref name="USGuidance"/&gt;

[[File:Coded aperture mask (for gamma camera).jpg|thumb|Coded aperture mask for [[gamma camera]] (for [[SPECT]])]]
'''Coded Apertures''' or '''Coded-Aperture Masks''' are grids, gratings, or other patterns of materials opaque to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. The wavelengths are usually high-energy radiation such as [[X-rays]] and [[gamma rays]]. By blocking radiation in a known pattern, a coded "shadow" is cast upon a plane. The properties of the original radiation sources can then be mathematically reconstructed from this shadow. Coded apertures are used in X- and gamma ray imaging systems, because these high-energy rays cannot be focused with lenses or mirrors that work for visible light.

==Rationale==
[[File:HURA_hexagonal_coded_aperture_mask_principle.svg|thumb|Simplified principle of operation of a HURA hexagonal coded aperture mask used in the SPI instrument of the INTEGRAL space telescope]]

Imaging is usually made at optical wavelengths by lenses and mirrors. However, for [[X-ray]]s and [[γ-ray]]s, lenses and mirrors do not exist, or else are impractical. Image modulation by apertures is therefore often used instead. The [[pinhole camera]] is the most basic form of such a modulation imager, but its disadvantage is low throughput, as its small aperture allows through little radiation. Only a tiny fraction of the light passes through the pinhole, which causes a low [[signal-to-noise ratio]]. To solve this problem, the mask can contain many holes, in one of several particular patterns, for example. Multiple masks, at varying distances from a detector, add flexibility to this tool. Specifically the [[modulation collimator]], invented by [[Minoru Oda]], was used to identify the first cosmic X-ray source and thereby to launch the new field of [[X-ray astronomy]] in 1965. Many other applications in other fields, such as [[tomography]], have since appeared.

In a coded aperture more complicated than a [[pinhole camera]], images from multiple apertures will overlap at the detector array. It is thus necessary to use a computational algorithm (which depends on the precise configuration of the aperture arrays) to reconstruct the original image. In this way a sharp image can be achieved without a lens. The image is formed from the whole array of sensors and is therefore tolerant to faults in individual sensors; on the other hand it accepts more background radiation than a focusing-optics imager (e.g., a refracting or reflecting [[telescope]]), and therefore is normally not favored at wavelengths where these techniques can be applied.

The coded aperture imaging technique is one of the earliest forms of [[computational photography]] and has a strong affinity to [[astronomical interferometry]]. Aperture-coding was first introduced by Ables&lt;ref name=ables&gt;{{cite journal

The '''Creation Research Society''' (CRS) is a [[Christianity|Christian]] research group that engages in [[creation science]]. The organization has produced various publications, including a journal and a creation-based [[biology]] textbook. During the first few years of its existence, different beliefs about [[Creationism]] and disagreement over its statement of beliefs resulted in various members of the board and voting members being forced out of the organization.

== History ==

=== Formation ===
Walter E. Lammerts formed the organization in the 1950s after becoming concerned that the [[American Scientific Affiliation]] was falling under the influence of [[theistic evolution]]. It was originally named the Creation Research Advisory Committee in February 1963, and headed by Walter E. Lammerts and Wiliam J. Tinkle with assistance from [[Henry M. Morris]]. The committee originally consisted of ten creationists: Lammerts, Tinkle, Morris, John W. Klotz, [[Frank Lewis Marsh]], Edwin Y. Monsma, [[Duane Gish]], Wilbert H. Rusch, John J. Grebe, and [[R. Laird Harris]]. The CRS was later formed in June 1963, with the original advisory committee constituting the new society's 'steering committee', with Karl W. Linsenmann, David A. Warriner and John N. Moore joining it at that time. At about the same time, Morris recruited Harold S. Slusher, [[Thomas G. Barnes]], Willis L. Webb and later Clifford L. Burdlick. Finally, Paul A. Zimmerman joined it. By the end of the year had expanded to approximately fifty members. Members with at least an M.Sc. or equivalent were eligible to be voting members.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p239-258&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early purges===
The organization's early growth allowed Lammerts to purge committee members who were insufficiently active or orthodox. Four committee members were removed: Monsma and Webb for inactivity, Harris for opposing a literal six-day creation, and Warriner after losing his university position and suggesting that the society hire him as a paid promoter. These members were replaced by George F. Howe, Bolton Davidheiser and H. Douglas Dean. Dean and Davidheiser left after only two years, Dean because of his unorthodox views on Evolution, and Davidheiser because he was unable to work with Seventh Day Adventists on the committee. Marsh, an Adventist, left about the same time because he interpreted the society's weekend meetings as a religious affront.

By the end of 1964, the society had grown sufficiently that Lammerts decided to purge the society of [[Old Earth creationism|Old Earth]], [[Gap creationism|Gap]] and [[Day-Age Creationism|Day Age]] creationists:
{{cquote|I am determined to get our organization so clearly committed to not only creation but [[flood geology]] and the [[Young Earth creationism|young earth]] concept that it will later be difficult to deviate from these commitments.}}

In 1967, Lammerts arranged for Morris to succeed him as chairman of the board, in order to ensure continuing fidelity to flood geology.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p259-260&lt;/ref&gt; Historian of creationism [[Ronald L. Numbers]] states that the Society "acquired a well-deserved reputation for welcoming only committed flood geologists."&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p262&lt;/ref&gt;

===Textbook project===
In response to the [[Sputnik]]-inspired emphasis on [[science education]], and the resultant [[Biological Sciences Curriculum Study]] textbooks (which emphasised evolution for the first time), creationists in the early 1960s were searching for an orthodox and up-to-date creationist biology textbook. The CRS responded with ''Biology: A Search for Order in Complexity'', published in 1970 by Christian publisher [[Zondervan]], which was a mixed success, selling out its first run of 10,000, and being approved by a number of state textbook committees, but being adopted by few public schools and after an Indiana school that attempted to make exclusive use of it, a state court banned its use (in ''[[Hendren v. Campbell]]'') stating:&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p264-267&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|The question is whether a text obviously designed  to present ''only'' the view of Biblical Creationism in a favorable light is constitutionally acceptable in the public schools of Indiana. Two hundred years of constitutional government demands that the answer be ''no''.}}

== Beliefs and stated purpose ==

The statement of belief was an issue of discussion among the 10 founders during its formation, with typical wrangling over wording, and little consensus beyond keeping out anyone supportive of [[evolution]]. There was concern that [[Flood Geology]] would be able to explain all geologic evidence and whether the six literal-day creation included the creation of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p255-256&lt;/ref&gt;

The CRS adopted the following statement of belief, mandatory for all members:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creationresearch.org/belief_wndw.htm CRS Statement of Belief] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021651/http://www.creationresearch.org/belief_wndw.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|
#The Bible is the written Word of God, and because it is inspired throughout, all its assertions are historically and scientifically true in the original autographs. To the student of nature this means that the account of origins in Genesis is a factual presentation of simple historical truths.
#All basic types of living things, including man, were made by direct creative acts of God during the Creation Week described in Genesis. Whatever biological changes have occurred since Creation Week have accomplished only changes within the original created kinds.
#The great flood described in Genesis, commonly referred to as the Noachian Flood, was an historic event worldwide in its extent and effect.
#We are an organization of Christian men and women of science who accept Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior. The account of the special creation of Adam and Eve as one man and one woman and their subsequent fall into sin is the basis for our belief in the necessity of a Savior for all mankind. Therefore, salvation can come only through accepting Jesus Christ as our Savior.}}

The society's stated purpose is "publication and research which impinge on creation as an alternate view of origins".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creationresearch.org/hisaims.htm CRS History and Aims] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021547/http://www.creationresearch.org/hisaims.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CRS' statement of belief was cited in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling of [[Edwards v. Aguillard]]. Its mandate that members affirm that the origin story described in Genesis was an established fact was cited by   Justice [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.]] as evidence there was a fundamentalist sectarian objective in the field of creation science and in Louisiana's 1981 [[Edwards v. Aguillard|Balanced Treatment Act]], a law requiring creation science instruction in the state's public schools wherever scientific evolution was taught.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard.html#POWELLI | title=Edwards v.

=== Publications ===
The ''Creation Research Society Quarterly'' has been published since July, 1964.  ''Creation Matters'' containing popular level articles has been published bi-monthly since 1996.  CRS has also published an assortment of special papers, monographs and books. Creationist publications have been criticized by scientists, such as [[Massimo Pigliucci]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://direct.bl.uk/bld/PlaceOrder.do?UIN=228018087&amp;ETOC=RN&amp;from=searchengine | title=Creationist peer review | publisher=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date= May–June 2008  | last=Pigliucci | first=Massimo | authorlink = Massimo Pigliucci| accessdate =2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "nonsense" in their attempt to blend faith with empirical fact. Glenn R. Morton is an author of more than 20 articles published by CRS in an attempt to "solve scientific problems" of creationism.&lt;ref name="Morton"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://chem.tufts.edu/science/Stear-NoAiG/no-AiG/transformation_of_a_yec.htm| title=Why I left Young-earth Creationism |publisher=[[Tufts University]] Department of Chemistry|year= 2000  | first=Glenn | last=Morton  | accessdate =2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morton later left the creationist movement complaining "The reaction to the pictures, seismic data, the logic disgusted me. They were more interested in what I sounded like than in the data!".&lt;ref name="Morton"/&gt;

[[Image:Mineraly.sk - dacit.jpg|thumb|250px|Dacite from Western Carpathians.]]

'''Dacite''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|d|eɪ|s|aɪ|t}}) is an [[igneous rock|igneous]], [[volcanic rock]]. It has an [[aphanitic]] to [[porphyritic]] texture and is intermediate in composition between [[andesite]] and [[rhyolite]]. The word dacite comes from [[Dacia]], a province of the [[Roman Empire]] which lay between the [[Danube River]] and [[Carpathian Mountains]] (now modern [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]]) where the rock was first described.

==Composition==
[[Image:Dacite-AphaniticQAPF.gif|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Aphanitic]] [[QAPF diagram]] denoting dacite.]]
Dacite consists mostly of [[plagioclase]] feldspar with [[biotite]], [[hornblende]], and [[pyroxene]] ([[augite]] and/or [[enstatite]]). It has [[quartz]] as some rounded, corroded [[phenocryst]]s, or as an element of the ground-mass.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Dacite |volume=7 |page=728 |first=John Smith |last=Flett |authorlink=John Flett (geologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The relative proportions of [[feldspar]]s and [[quartz]] in dacite, and in many other volcanic rocks, are illustrated in the [[QAPF diagram]]. The [[TAS classification]], based on [[silica]] and [[Alkali metal|alkali]] contents, puts dacite in the O3 sector .
The plagioclase ranges from [[oligoclase]] to [[andesine]] and [[labradorite]]. [[Sanidine]] occurs, although in small proportions, in some dacites, and when abundant gives rise to rocks that form transitions to the rhyolites.

The groundmass of these rocks is composed of plagioclase and quartz.

==Texture==
[[Image:Different types of dacite-1200px.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|Grey, red, black, altered white/tan, flow-banded pumice dacite]]
In hand specimen, many of the hornblende and biotite dacites are grey or pale brown and yellow rocks with white feldspars, and black crystals of biotite and hornblende. Other dacites, especially pyroxene-bearing dacites, are darker colored.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In thin section, dacites may have an [[aphanitic]] to [[porphyritic]] texture. Porphyritic dacites contain blocky highly zoned [[plagioclase]] phenocrysts and/or rounded corroded [[quartz]] phenocrysts. Subhedral [[hornblende]] and elongated [[biotite]] grains are present. [[Sanidine]] phenocrysts and [[augite]] (or [[enstatite]]) are found in some samples. The groundmass of these rocks is often [[aphanitic]] [[microcrystalline]], with a web of minute feldspars mixed with interstitial grains of quartz or tridymite; but in many dacites it is largely vitreous, while in others it is felsitic or cryptocrystalline.

==Geological context and formation==
[[File:Dacite-ThinSection-USGS.jpg|thumb|300px|Thin section of a porphyritic dacite from [[Mount St. Helens]]]]
Dacite usually forms as an intrusive rock such as a [[dike (geology)|dike]] or [[sill (geology)|sill]]. Examples of this type of dacite outcrop are found in northwestern [[Montana]] and northeastern [[Bulgaria]]. Nevertheless, because of the moderately high silica content, dacitic [[magma]] is quite viscous&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whittington|first1=A. G.|last2=Hellwig|first2=B. M.|last3=Behrens|first3=H.|last4=Joachim|first4=B.|last5=Stechern|first5=A.|last6=Vetere|first6=F.|title=The viscosity of hydrous dacitic liquids: implications for the rheology of evolving silicic magmas|journal=Bulletin of Volcanology|date=2009|volume=71|issue=2|pages=185–199|doi=10.1007/s00445-008-0217-y|bibcode=2009BVol...71..185W}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore prone to explosive eruption. A notorious example of this is [[Mount St. Helens]] in which dacite domes formed from previous eruptions. [[Pyroclastic flows]] may also be of dacitic composition as is the case with the [[Fish Canyon Tuff]] of [[La Garita Caldera]].&lt;ref name="Fish Canyon"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/sim/3123/site/photos/10.pdf | title=Outflow ignimbrite sheet of Fish Canyon Tuff: crystal-rich dacitic ignimbrite erupted from La Garita caldera | publisher=[[USGS]] | accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dacitic magma is formed by the subduction of young oceanic crust under a thick [[felsic]] continental plate. Oceanic crust is hydrothermally altered causing addition of quartz and sodium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Devore|first1=G. W.|title=The influence of submarine weathering of basalts on their partial melting during subduction|journal=[[Lithos (journal)|Lithos]] |date=1983|volume=16|issue=3|pages=203–213|doi=10.1016/0024-4937(83)90024-5|bibcode=1983Litho..16..203D}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the young, hot oceanic plate is subducted under continental crust, the subducted slab [[partial melting|partially melts]] and interacts with the upper mantle through convection and dehydration reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drummond|first1=M. S.|last2=Defant|first2=M. J.|title=A model for Trondhjemite-Tonalite-Dacite Genesis and crustal growth via slab melting: Archean to modern comparisons|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|date=1990|volume=95|issue=B13|pages=21503–21521|doi=10.1029/JB095iB13p21503|bibcode=1990JGR....9521503D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of subduction creates metamorphism in the subducting slab. When this slab reaches the mantle and initiates the dehydration reactions, minerals such as [[talc]], [[Serpentine group|serpentine]], [[mica]] and [[amphibole]]s break down generating a more sodic melt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fyfe|first1= W.|last2= McBirney|first2= A.|date=1975|title=Subduction and the structure of andesitic volcanic belts|journal=American Journal of Science |volume=275-A|pages= 285-297}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magma then continues to migrate upwards causing differentiation and becomes even more sodic and silicic as it rises. Once at the cold surface, the sodium rich magma crystallizes plagioclase, quartz and hornblende.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Defant|first1=M. J.|last2=Richerson|first2=P. M.|last3=de Boer|first3=J. Z.|last4=Stewart|first4=R. H.|last5=Maury|first5=R. C.|last6=Bellon|first6=H.|last7=Drummond|first7=M. S.|last8=Feigenson|first8=M. D.|last9=Jackson|first9=T. E.|title=Dacite Genesis via both Slab Melting and Differentiation: Petrogenesis of La Yeguada Volcanic Complex, Panama|journal=Journal of Petrology|date=1991|volume=32|issue=6|pages=1101–1142|doi=10.1093/petrology/32.6.1101|bibcode=1991JPet...32.1101D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accessory minerals like pyroxenes provide insight to the history of the magma.

The formation of dacite provides a great deal of information about the connection between oceanic crust and continental crust. It provides a model for the generation of felsic, buoyant, perennial rock from a mafic, dense, short-lived one.

===Dacite's role in the creation of Archean continental crust===
The process by which dacite forms has been used to explain the generation of continental crust during the [[Archean|Archean eon]]. At that time, the fabrication of dacitic magma was more ubiquitous due to the availability of young hot oceanic crust. Today, the colder oceanic crust that subducts under most plates is not capable of melting before the dehydration reactions therefore inhibiting the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atherton|first1=M. P.|last2=Petford|first2=N.|title=Generation of sodium-rich magmas from newly underplated basaltic crust|journal=Nature|date=1993|volume=362|issue=6416|pages=144–146|doi=10.1038/362144a0|bibcode=1993Natur.362..144A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molten dacite magma at Kīlauea===
Dacite magma was encountered in a drillhole during geothermal exploration on [[Kīlauea]] in 2005. At a depth of 2488 m, the magma flowed up the wellbore. This produced several kilograms of clear, colorless vitric (glassy, non-crystalline) cuttings at the surface. The dacite magma is a residual melt of the typical [[basalt]] magma of Kīlauea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abstractsearch.agu.org/meetings/2008/FM/V23A.html Puna Dacite Magma at Kilauea: Unexpected Drilling Into an Active Magma Posters, 2008 Eos Trans. AGU, 89(53), Fall Meeting]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==
Dacite is relatively common and occurs in various tectonic and magmatic contexts:
* In oceanic volcanic series. Examples: [[Iceland]] (Heiðarsporður ridge),&lt;ref name="ManciniEtAl2015"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377027315001420 | title=Origin of the compositional diversity in the basalt-to-dacite series erupted along the Heiðarsporður ridge, NE Iceland | first=A. | last=Mancini | first2=H.B. | last2=Mattsson | first3=O. | last3=Bachmann | journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research | year=2015 | volume=301 | pages=116–127 | doi=10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2015.05.010| bibcode=2015JVGR..301..116M }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juan de Fuca Ridge]]&lt;ref name="PerfitEtAl2008"&gt;{{cite conference | url=https://www.academia.edu/24261994/Petrogenesis_of_dacites_from_the_southern_Juan_de_Fuca_Ridge | title=Petrogenesis of dacites from the southern Juan de Fuca Ridge | accessdate=23 February 2018 | first=M.R. | last=Perfit | first2=A.K. | last2=Schmitt | first3=W.I. | last3=Ridley | first4=K.H. | last4=Rubin | first5=J.W. | last5=Valley | booktitle=Goldschmidt Conference Abstracts 2008 | year=2008 | conference=Goldschmidt Conference 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In limestone-alkaline and [[tholeiitic]] volcanic series of the subduction zones of [[island arc]]s and active [[continental margin]]s. Examples of dacitic magmatism in island arcs are [[Japan]], the [[Philippines]], the [[Aleutians]], the [[Antilles]], the [[Sunda Arc]] ([[Mount Batur]]),&lt;ref name="Wheller1986"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://eprints.utas.edu.au/21879/ | title=Petrogenesis of Batur caldera, Bali, and the geochemistry of Sunda-Banda arc basalts | publisher=PhD thesis, University of Tasmania. | author=Wheller, Graeme Eric | year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tonga]] and the [[South Sandwich Islands]]. Examples of dacitic magmatism in active continental margins are the [[Cascade Range]], [[Guatemala]] and the [[Andes]] ([[Ecuador]] and [[Chile]]).

In [[astrophysics]], '''dark flow''' is a possible non-random component of the [[peculiar velocity]] of [[galaxy cluster]]s. The actual measured velocity is the sum of the velocity predicted by [[Hubble's Law]] plus a possible small and unexplained (or ''dark'') velocity flowing in a common direction.

According to standard [[cosmological model]]s, the motion of galaxy clusters with respect to the [[cosmic microwave background]] should be randomly distributed in all directions. However, analyzing the three-year [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) data using the kinematic [[Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect]], astronomers [[Alexander Kashlinsky]], F. Atrio-Barandela, D. Kocevski and H. Ebeling found evidence of a "surprisingly coherent" 600–1000&amp;nbsp;km/s&lt;ref name="10.1086/592947" /&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1088/0004-637X/691/2/1479" /&gt; flow of clusters toward a 20-degree patch of sky between the constellations of [[Centaurus]] and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]].

The researchers had suggested that the motion may be a remnant of the influence of no-longer-visible regions of the universe prior to [[inflationary cosmology|inflation]]. Telescopes cannot see events earlier than about 380,000 years after the [[Big Bang]], when the universe became transparent (the [[cosmic microwave background]]); this corresponds to the [[particle horizon]] at a distance of about 46 billion (4.6×10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;) [[light year]]s. Since the matter causing the net motion in this proposal is outside this range, it would in a certain sense be outside our [[visible universe]]; however, it would still be in our past [[light cone]].

The results appeared in the October 20, 2008, issue of [[Astrophysical Journal Letters]].&lt;ref name="10.1086/592947"&gt;{{cite journal

In 2013, data from the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck space telescope]] showed no evidence of "dark flow" on that sort of scale, discounting the claims of evidence for either gravitational effects reaching beyond the visible universe or existence of a multiverse.&lt;ref name="newsci-dn23340" /&gt; However, in 2015  Kashlinsky ''et al'' claim to have found support for its existence using both Planck and WMAP data.&lt;ref name="10.1088/0004-637X/810/2/143"&gt;{{cite journal

The dark flow was determined to be flowing in the direction of the [[Centaurus]] and [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] constellations.&lt;ref name="Kash2010"&gt;NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (2010, March 11). Mysterious cosmic 'dark flow' tracked deeper into universe. ScienceDaily. Retrieved 2010-09-28, from https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100310162829.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=August 2013}} This corresponds with the direction of the [[Great Attractor]], which is a gravitational mystery originally discovered in 1973. However, the source of the Great Attractor's attraction was thought to originate from a massive cluster of galaxies called the [[Norma Cluster]], located about 250 million light-years away from Earth.

In a study from March 2010, Kashlinsky extended his work from 2008, by using the 5-year WMAP results rather than the 3-year results, and doubling the number of galaxy clusters observed from 700. The team also sorted the cluster catalog into four "slices" representing different distance ranges. They then examined the preferred flow direction for the clusters within each slice. While the size and exact position of this direction display some variation, the overall trends among the slices exhibit remarkable agreement.&lt;ref name="Kash2010" /&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=August 2013}}  "We detect motion along this axis, but right now our data cannot state as strongly as we'd like whether the clusters are coming or going," Kashlinsky said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mysterious Cosmic 'Dark Flow' Tracked Deeper into Universe |author1=Reddy, Francis  |author2=Chandler, Lynn |publisher=Goddard Space Flight Center |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/releases/2010/10-023.html |date=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team has so far catalogued the effect as far out as 2.5 billion light-years, and hopes to expand its catalog out further still to twice the current distance.

== Criticisms ==

Astrophysicist [[Edward L. Wright|Ned Wright]] posted an online response to the study arguing that its methods are flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/dark-flow-errors.html |title=Archived item in Ned Wright's News of the Universe |publisher=Astro.ucla.edu |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the "dark flow" study released a statement in return, refuting three of Wright's five arguments and identifying the remaining two as a typo and a technicality that do not affect the measurements and their interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kashlinsky.info/bulkflows/Wright_is_wrong |title=Refutation of Wright's remarks |publisher=Kashlinsky.info |date=2008-09-29 |accessdate=2012-11-11 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent statistical work done by Ryan Keisler&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| arxiv=0910.4233|title=The Statistical Significance of the "Dark Flow" |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=707 |pages=L42–L44 |date=2009-10-22 |last1=Keisler |first1=Ryan |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/707/1/L42 |bibcode = 2009ApJ...707L..42K }}&lt;/ref&gt; claims to rule out the possibility that the dark flow is a physical phenomenon because Kashlinsky et al. did not consider the primary [[anisotropies]] of the [[CMB|cosmic microwave background (CMB)]] to be as important as they are.

NASA's Goddard Space Center considered that this could be the effect of a sibling universe or a region of space-time fundamentally different from the observable universe. Data on more than 1,000 galaxy clusters have been measured, including some as distant as 3 billion light-years. Alexander Kashlinsky claims these measurements show the universe's steady flow is clearly not a statistical fluke. Kashlinsky said: "At this point we don't have enough information to see what it is, or to constrain it. We can only say with certainty that somewhere very far away the world is very different than what we see locally. Whether it's 'another universe' or a different fabric of space-time we don't know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.discovery.com/space/dark-flow-universe.html | title=Mysterious 'Dark Flow' May Be Tug Of Other Universe |publisher=News.discovery.com |date=2010-03-18 |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laura Mersini-Houghton]] and Rich Holman observe that some anisotropy is predicted both by theories involving interaction with another universe, or when the frame of reference of the CMB does not coincide with that of the universe's expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=5966|title=A Tale of Two Oxford Talks – Not Even Wrong|work=columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, data from the European Space Agency's [[Planck satellite]] was claimed to show no statistically significant evidence of existence of dark flow.&lt;ref name="newsci-dn23340"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23340-blow-for-dark-flow-in-plancks-new-view-of-the-cosmos.html|title=Blow for 'dark flow' in Planck's new view of the cosmos|date=3 April 2013|author=Maggie McKee|journal=[[New Scientist]]|issue=2911}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1303.5090"&gt;{{arxiv|1303.5090}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, another analysis by a member of the Planck collaboration, Fernando Atrio-Barandela, suggested the data were consistent with the earlier findings from WMAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{arxiv|1303.6614}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Popular media continued to be interested in the idea, with Mersini-Houghton claiming the Planck results support existence of a multiverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=5907|title=Hard Evidence for the Multiverse Found, but String Theory Limits the Space Brain Threat|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=22 May 2013|author=Peter Woit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2326869/Is-universe-merely-billions-Evidence-existence-multiverse-revealed-time-cosmic-map.html|title=Is our universe merely one of billions?

The '''Ediacaran''' Period ({{IPAc-en|pron|iː|d|i|ˈ|æ|k|ər|ə|n}}), spans 94 million years from the end of the [[Cryogenian|Cryogenian Period]] 635 million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the [[Cambrian|Cambrian Period]] 541 Mya. It marks the end of the  [[Proterozoic Eon]], and the beginning of the [[Phanerozoic Eon]]. It is named after the [[Ediacara Hills]] of [[South Australia]].

The Ediacaran Period's status as an official geological period was ratified in 2004 by the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] (IUGS), making it the first new geological period declared in 120 years.&lt;ref name=Knoll2004a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Knoll2004&gt;{{cite journal

The Vendian in its type area consists of large subdivisions such as Laplandian, [[Redkino]], [[Kotlin Island|Kotlin]] and [[Rovno]] Regional stages with the globally traceable subdivisions and their boundaries, including its lower one.

The Redkino, Kotlin and Rovno regional stages have been substantiated in the type area of the Vendian on the basis of the abundant organic-walled [[microfossil]]s, megascopic algae, [[metazoan]] body fossils and [[ichnofossil]]s.&lt;ref name=Sokolov1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=SokolovFedonkin1984&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1134/S0869593808060014| title = The Yudomian of Siberia, Vendian and Ediacaran systems of the International stratigraphic scale| year = 2008| last1 = Khomentovsky | first1 = V.

The lower boundary of the Vendian could have a [[biostratigraphic]] substantiation as well taking into consideration the worldwide occurrence of the [[Pertatataka Formation|Pertatataka]] assemblage of giant acanthomorph [[acritarch]]s.&lt;ref name=Fedonkin2007/&gt;

The Ediacaran Period (c. 635–542 Mya) represents the time from the end of global [[Marinoan glaciation]] to the first appearance worldwide of somewhat complicated trace fossils (''[[Treptichnus pedum]]'' (Seilacher, 1955)).&lt;ref name=Knoll2004a&gt;A. Knoll, M. Walter, G. Narbonne, and N. Christie-Blick (2004) "[http://www.stratigraphy.org/bak/ediacaran/Knoll_et_al_2004a.pdf The Ediacaran Period: A New Addition to the Geologic Time Scale.]" Submitted on Behalf of the Terminal Proterozoic Subcommission of the International Commission on Stratigraphy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Ediacaran Period does contain soft-bodied [[fossil]]s, it is unusual in comparison to later periods because its beginning is not defined by a change in the fossil record. Rather, the beginning is defined at the base of a chemically distinctive [[carbonate]] layer that is referred to as a "[[cap carbonate]]," because it caps glacial deposits.

This bed is characterized by an unusual depletion of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;[[Carbon|C]] that indicates a sudden climatic change at the end of the [[Marinoan]] [[ice age]]. The lower boundary [[GSSP]] of the Ediacaran is at the base of the cap carbonate (Nuccaleena Formation), immediately above the Elatina [[diamictite]] in the Enorama Creek section, Brachina Gorge, Flinders Ranges, South Australia.

The [[GSSP]] of the upper boundary of the Ediacaran is the lower boundary of the Cambrian on the SE coast of Newfoundland approved by the International Commission on Stratigraphy as a preferred alternative to the base of the [[Tommotian]] Stage in [[Siberia]] which was selected on the basis of the ichnofossil ''[[Treptichnus pedum]]'' (Seilacher, 1955). In the history of stratigraphy it was the first case of usage of bioturbations for the System boundary definition.

Nevertheless, the definitions of the lower and upper boundaries of the Ediacaran on the basis of chemostratigraphy and [[ichnofossil]]s are disputable.&lt;ref name=Fedonkin2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Comments2004&gt;Comments By B. S. Sokolov, M. A. Semikhatov, And M. A. Fedonkin.

Cap carbonates generally have a restricted geographic distribution (due to specific conditions of their precipitation){{vague|date=June 2013}} and usually siliciclastic sediments laterally replace the cap carbonates in a rather short distance but cap carbonates do not occur above every tillite elsewhere{{clarify|reason=location not specified|date=May 2013}} in the world.

The C-isotope chemostratigraphic characteristics obtained for contemporaneous cap carbonates in different parts of the world may be variable in a wide range owing to different degrees of secondary alteration of carbonates, dissimilar criteria used for selection of the least altered samples, and, as far as the C-isotope data are concerned, due to primary lateral variations of δ &lt;sup&gt;l3&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;carb&lt;/sub&gt; in the upper layer of the ocean.&lt;ref name=Fedonkin2007/&gt;&lt;ref name= Bristow2008&gt;{{cite journal

As to the ''Treptichnus pedum'', a reference ichnofossil for the lower boundary of the Cambrian, its usage for the stratigraphic detection of this boundary is always risky, because of the occurrence of very similar trace fossils belonging to the Treptichnids group well below the level of ''T. pedum'' in [[Namibia]], [[Spain]] and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and possibly, in the [[western United States]]. The stratigraphic range of ''T. pedum'' overlaps the range of the Ediacaran fossils in Namibia, and probably in Spain.&lt;ref name=Fedonkin2007/&gt;&lt;ref name= Ragozina2007&gt;A. Ragozina, D.

== Subdivisions ==
The Ediacaran period is not yet formally subdivided, but a proposed scheme&lt;ref name="Xiao2016"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.paleo.geos.vt.edu/Ediacaran/Xiao2016EdiacaranTimeScaleEpisodes.pdf | title=Towards an Ediacaran  Time Scale: Problems, Protocols, and Prospects | first=Shuhai | last=Xiao | first2=Guy M. | last2=Narbonne | first3=Chuanming | last3=Zhou | first4=Marc | last4=Laflamme | first5=Dmitriy V. | last5=Grazhdankin | first6=Malgorzata | last6=Moczydlowska-Vidal | first7=Huan | last7=Cui | journal=Episodes | year=2016 | volume=39 | issue=4 | pages=540555 | doi=10.18814/epiiugs/2016/v39i4/103886}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognises an Upper Ediacaran whose base corresponds with the [[Gaskiers glaciation]], a Terminal Ediacaran Stage starting around {{Ma|550}}, a preceding stage beginning around 557 Ma with the earliest widespread [[Ediacaran biota]] fossils; two proposed schemes differ on whether the lower strata should be divided into an Early and Middle Ediacaran or not, because it's not clear whether the Shuram excursion (which would divide the Early and Middle) is a separate event from the Gaskiers, or whether the two events are correlated.

==Absolute dating==
The [[Absolute dating|dating]] of the rock type section of the Ediacaran Period in South Australia has proven uncertain. Therefore, the age range of 635 to 542 million years is based on [[Stratigraphy|correlations]] to other countries where dating has been possible. The base age of approximately 635 million years is based on [[Uranium–lead dating|U–Pb]] ([[uranium]]–[[lead]]) [[isochron dating]] from [[Namibia]]&lt;ref name=Hoffmann2004&gt;{{cite journal

Applying this age to the base of the Ediacaran assumes that cap carbonates are laid down synchronously around the world and that the correct cap carbonate layers have been selected in such diverse locales as Australian and Namibia. This is controversial because an age of about 580 million years has been obtained for glacial rocks in [[Tasmania]] which some scientists tentatively assign to those just beneath the Ediacaran rocks of the Flinders Ranges.&lt;ref name=Calver2004&gt;{{cite journal

==Biota==
{{main article|Ediacaran biota}}

The fossil record from the Ediacaran Period is sparse, as more easily fossilized hard-shelled animals had yet to evolve. The Ediacaran biota include the oldest definite [[multicellular organism]]s (with specialized tissues), the most common types of which resemble segmented worms, fronds, disks, or immobile bags.

Ediacara biota bear little resemblance to modern lifeforms, and their [[biological classification|relationship]] even with the immediately following lifeforms of the [[Cambrian explosion]] is rather difficult to interpret. More than 100 [[List of Ediacaran genera|genera]] have been described, and well known forms include ''[[Arkarua]]'', ''[[Charnia]]'', ''[[Dickinsonia]]'', ''[[Ediacaria]]'', ''[[Marywadea]]'', ''[[Onega (fossil)|Onega]]'', ''[[Pteridinium]]'', and ''[[Yorgia]]''.

There is evidence that Earth's first mass extinction happened during this period when early animals changed the environment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150902123456.htm Science Daily&lt;/ref&gt;

== Astronomical factors ==
The relative proximity of the Moon at this time meant that [[Tidal acceleration|tides]] were stronger and more rapid than they are now. The day was 21.9±0.4 hours, and there were 13.1±0.1 synodic months/year and 400±7 solar days/year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1029/1999RG900016 | last1 = Williams | first1 = George E. | date = 2000 | title = Geological constraints on the Precambrian history of Earth's rotation and the Moon's orbit | bibcode = 2000RvGeo..38...37W | journal = Reviews of Geophysics | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 37–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electric potential energy''', or '''electrostatic potential energy''', is a [[potential energy]] (measured in [[joule]]s) that results from [[conservative force|conservative]] [[Coulomb force]]s and is associated with the configuration of a particular set of point [[electric charge|charges]] within a defined [[physical system|system]]. An ''object'' may have electric potential energy by virtue of two key elements: its own electric charge and its relative position to other electrically charged ''objects''.

The term "electric potential energy" is used to describe the potential energy in systems with [[Time-variant system|time-variant]] [[electric field]]s, while the term "electrostatic potential energy" is used to describe the potential energy in systems with [[time-invariant system|time-invariant]] electric fields.

==Definition==

The electric potential energy of a system of point charges is defined as the work required assembling this system of charges by bringing them close together, as in the system from an infinite distance.
:The electrostatic potential energy, ''U&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'', of one [[point charge]] ''q'' at position '''r''' in the presence of an [[electric field]] '''E''' is defined as the negative of the [[Work (electrical)|work]] ''W'' done by the [[electrostatic force]] to bring it from the reference position '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The reference zero is usually taken to be a state in which the individual point charges are very well separated ("are at infinite separation") and are at rest.&lt;/ref&gt; to that position '''r'''.&lt;ref&gt;Electromagnetism (2nd edition), I.S. Grant, W.R. Phillips, Manchester Physics Series, 2008 {{ISBN|0-471-92712-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Halliday |first=David |author2=Resnick, Robert |author3=Walker, Jearl  |title=Fundamentals of Physics |edition=5th |year=1997 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |chapter=Electric Potential |isbn=0-471-10559-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|§25-1}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Alternatively, it can also be defined as the [[Mechanical work|work]] ''W'' done by an external force to bring it from the reference position '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; to some position '''r'''. Nonetheless, both definitions yield the same results.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|equation=&lt;math&gt;U_\mathrm{E}(\mathbf r) = -W_{r_{\rm ref} \rightarrow r } = -\int_{{\mathbf{r}}_{\rm ref}}^\mathbf{r} q\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r'}) \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r'}&lt;/math&gt;,
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

:where '''E''' is the electrostatic field and d'''r'''' is the displacement vector in a curve from the reference position '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; to the final position '''r'''.

The electrostatic potential energy can also be defined from the electric potential as follows:

:The electrostatic potential energy, ''U&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'', of one point charge ''q'' at position '''r''' in the presence of an [[electric potential]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Phi&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the product of the charge and the electric potential.

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|equation=&lt;math&gt;U_\mathrm{E}(\mathbf r) = q \Phi(\mathbf r)&lt;/math&gt;,
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

:where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electric potential]] generated by the charges, which is a function of position '''r'''.

==Units==

The [[SI]] unit of electric potential energy is the [[joule]] (named after the English physicist [[James Prescott Joule]]). In the [[Cgs system|CGS system]] the [[erg]] is the unit of energy, being equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; J. Also [[electronvolts]] may be used, 1 eV = 1.602×10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; J.

==Electrostatic potential energy of one point charge==

===One point charge ''q'' in the presence of another point charge ''Q''===

[[File:Point Charge q in an electric field.svg|right|A point charge q in the electric field of another charge Q.|thumb|434px]]

The electrostatic potential energy, ''U&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'', of one point charge ''q'' at position '''r''' in the presence of a point charge ''Q'', taking an infinite separation between the charges as the reference position, is:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|equation=&lt;math&gt; U_E(r) =  k_e\frac{qQ}{r}&lt;/math&gt;,
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

where &lt;math&gt;k_e = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Coulomb's constant]], ''r'' is the distance between the point charges ''q'' &amp; ''Q'', and ''q'' &amp; ''Q'' are the charges (not the absolute values of the charges—i.e., an [[electron]] would have a negative value of charge when placed in the formula). The following outline of proof states the derivation from the definition of electric potential energy and [[Coulomb's law]] to this formula.

The electrostatic force '''F''' acting on a charge ''q'' can be written in terms of the electric field '''E''' as
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = q\mathbf{E} &lt;/math&gt;,

By definition, the change in electrostatic potential energy, ''U&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'', of a point charge ''q'' that has moved from the reference position '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; to position '''r''' in the presence of an electric field '''E''' is the negative of the work done by the [[electrostatic force]] to bring it from the reference position '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; to that position '''r'''.

:&lt;math&gt; U_E(r) - U_E(r_{\rm ref}) = -W_{r_{\rm ref} \rightarrow r } = -\int_{{r}_{\rm ref}}^r q\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s} &lt;/math&gt;.

where:
*'''r''' = position in 3d space of the charge ''q'', using cartesian coordinates '''r''' = (''x'', ''y'', ''z''), taking the position of the ''Q'' charge at '''r''' = (0,0,0), the scalar ''r'' = |'''r'''| is the [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] of the position vector,
*d'''s''' = differential [[displacement vector]] along a path ''C'' going from '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; to '''r''',
*&lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle W_{r_{\rm ref} \rightarrow r } &lt;/math&gt; is the work done by the electrostatic force to bring the charge from the reference position '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; to '''r''',

Usually ''U&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' is set to zero when '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; is infinity:

:&lt;math&gt; U_E (r_{\rm ref}=\infty) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

so

:&lt;math&gt; U_E(r) = - \int_\infty^r q\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s} &lt;/math&gt;

When the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] {{nowrap|'''&amp;nabla;''' &amp;times; '''E'''}} is zero, the line integral above does not depend on the specific path ''C'' chosen but only on its endpoints. This happens in time-invariant electric fields. When talking about electrostatic potential energy, time-invariant electric fields are always assumed so, in this case, the electric field is [[conservative vector field|conservative]] and Coulomb's law can be used.

Using [[Coulomb's law]], it is known that the electrostatic force '''F''' and the electric field '''E ''' created by a discrete point charge ''Q'' are radially directed from ''Q''. By the definition of the position vector '''r''' and the displacement vector '''s''', it follows that '''r''' and '''s''' are also radially directed from ''Q''. So, '''E''' and d'''s''' must be parallel:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s} = |\mathbf{E}| \cdot |\mathrm{d}\mathbf{s}|\cos(0) = E \mathrm{d}s &lt;/math&gt;

Using Coulomb's law, the electric field is given by

:&lt;math&gt; |\mathbf{E}| = E = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{Q}{s^2} &lt;/math&gt;

and the integral can be easily evaluated:

:&lt;math&gt; U_E(r) = -\int_\infty^r q\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s} = -\int_\infty^r \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{qQ}{s^2}{\rm d}s = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{qQ}{r} = k_e\frac{qQ}{r} &lt;/math&gt;

===One point charge ''q'' in the presence of ''n'' point charges ''Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''===
[[File:Electric potential energy 3 charge.gif|thumb|Electrostatic potential energy of ''q'' due to ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; charge system:&lt;math&gt;U_E = q\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \left(\frac{Q_1}{r_1} + \frac{Q_2}{r_2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;]]
The electrostatic potential energy, ''U&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'', of one point charge ''q'' in the presence of ''n'' point charges ''Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', taking an infinite separation between the charges as the reference position, is:

where &lt;math&gt;k_e = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Coulomb's constant]], ''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the distance between the point charges ''q'' &amp; ''Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''q'' &amp; ''Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the signed values of the charges.

The electrostatic potential energy ''U''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; stored in a system of two charges is equal to the electrostatic potential energy of a charge in the [[electrostatic potential]] generated by the other. That is to say, if charge q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; generates an electrostatic potential Φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a function of position '''r''', then

:&lt;math&gt;U_\mathrm{E} = q_2 \Phi_1(\mathbf r_2).&lt;/math&gt;

Doing the same calculation with respect to the other charge, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;U_\mathrm{E} = q_1 \Phi_2(\mathbf r_1).&lt;/math&gt;

The electrostatic potential energy is mutually shared by &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt;, so the total stored energy is

: &lt;math&gt;U_E = \frac{1}{2}\left[q_2 \Phi_1(\mathbf r_2) + q_1 \Phi_2(\mathbf r_1)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

This can be generalized to say that the electrostatic potential energy ''U''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; stored in a system of ''N'' charges ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'' at positions '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; respectively, is:

&lt;math&gt;U_\mathrm{E} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^N q_i \Phi(\mathbf{r}_i)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Energy stored in a system of one point charge===

The electrostatic potential energy of a system containing only one point charge is zero, as there are no other sources of electrostatic potential against which an external agent must do work in moving the point charge from infinity to its final location.

A common question arises concerning the interaction of a point charge with its own electrostatic potential. Since this interaction doesn't act to move the point charge itself, it doesn't contribute to the stored energy of the system.

===Energy stored in a system of two point charges===
Consider bringing a point charge, ''q'', into its final position in the vicinity (neighbourhood) of a point charge, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. The electrostatic potential Φ('''r''') due to ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi(r) = k_e \frac{Q_1}{r} &lt;/math&gt;

Hence we obtain, the electric potential energy of ''q'' in the potential of ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;U_E = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q Q_1}{ r_1 }&lt;/math&gt;

where r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the separation between the two point charges.

===Energy stored in a system of three point charges===

The electrostatic potential energy of a system of three charges should not be confused with the electrostatic potential energy of ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; due to two charges ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, because the latter doesn't include the electrostatic potential energy of the system of the two charges ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

The electrostatic potential energy stored in the system of three charges is:

:&lt;math&gt;U_\mathrm{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \left[ \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r_{12}} + \frac{Q_1 Q_3}{r_{13}} + \frac{Q_2 Q_3}{r_{23}} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="80%" style="text-align:left"
!Outline of proof
|-
|
Using the formula given in ({{EquationNote|1}}), the electrostatic potential energy of the system of the three charges will then be:

:&lt;math&gt;U_\mathrm{E} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ Q_1 \Phi(\mathbf{r}_1) + Q_2 \Phi(\mathbf{r}_2) + Q_3 \Phi(\mathbf{r}_3) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\Phi(\mathbf{r}_1)&lt;/math&gt; is the electric potential in '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; created by charges ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Phi(\mathbf{r}_2)&lt;/math&gt; is the electric potential in '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; created by charges ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Phi(\mathbf{r}_3)&lt;/math&gt; is the electric potential in '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; created by charges ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The potentials are:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(\mathbf{r}_1) = \Phi_2(\mathbf{r}_1) + \Phi_3(\mathbf{r}_1) = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Q_2}{r_{12}} + \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Q_3}{r_{13}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(\mathbf{r}_2) = \Phi_1(\mathbf{r}_2) + \Phi_3(\mathbf{r}_2) = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Q_1}{r_{21}} + \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Q_3}{r_{23}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(\mathbf{r}_3) = \Phi_1(\mathbf{r}_3) + \Phi_2(\mathbf{r}_3) = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Q_1}{r_{31}} + \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Q_2}{r_{32}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''r''&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt; is the distance between charge ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;.

If we add everything:

:&lt;math&gt;U_\mathrm{E} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \left[ \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r_{12}} + \frac{Q_1 Q_3}{r_{13}} + \frac{Q_2 Q_1}{r_{21}} + \frac{Q_2 Q_3}{r_{23}} + \frac{Q_3 Q_1}{r_{31}} +  \frac{Q_3 Q_2}{r_{32}}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, we get that the electrostatic potential energy stored in the system of three charges:

:&lt;math&gt;U_\mathrm{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \left[ \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r_{12}} + \frac{Q_1 Q_3}{r_{13}} + \frac{Q_2 Q_3}{r_{23}}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

== Energy stored in an electrostatic field distribution ==

The energy density, or energy per unit volume, &lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{dV}&lt;/math&gt;, of the [[electrostatic field]] of a continuous charge distribution is:

: &lt;math&gt; u_e = \frac{dU}{dV} = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_0 \left|{\mathbf{E}}\right|^2.&lt;/math&gt;

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="80%" style="text-align:left"
!Outline of proof
|-
|
One may take the equation for the electrostatic [[potential energy]] of a continuous charge distribution and put it in terms of the [[electrostatic field]].

Since [[Gauss's law]] for electrostatic field in differential form states

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;

where

* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} \ &lt;/math&gt; is the electric field vector
* &lt;math&gt;\rho \ &lt;/math&gt; is the total [[charge density]] including [[dipole]] charges [[bound charge|bound]] in a material
* &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the [[permittivity of free space]],

then,

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\int \limits_{\text{all space}} \rho(r) \Phi(r) \, dV \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{2}\int \limits_{\text{all space}} \varepsilon_0(\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot{\mathbf{E}})\Phi \, dV
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

so, now using the following divergence vector identity

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla\cdot(\mathbf{A}{B}) = (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{A}){B} + \mathbf{A}\cdot(\nabla{B}) \Rightarrow (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{A}){B} = \nabla\cdot(\mathbf{A}{B}) - \mathbf{A}\cdot(\nabla{B})&lt;/math&gt;

we have

: &lt;math&gt; U = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2}\int \limits_{\text{all space}} \mathbf{\nabla}\cdot(\mathbf{E}\Phi) dV - \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2}\int \limits_{\text{all space}} (\mathbf{\nabla}\Phi)\cdot\mathbf{E} dV&lt;/math&gt;

using the [[divergence theorem]] and taking the area to be at infinity where &lt;math&gt;\Phi(\infty) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
U &amp; = \overbrace{\frac{\varepsilon_0}{2}\int\limits_{{}^\text{boundary}_\text{ of space}} \Phi\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf A}^{0} - \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2}\int \limits_{\text{all space}} (-\mathbf{E})\cdot\mathbf{E} \, dV \\
&amp; = \int \limits_{\text{all space}} \frac{1}{2}\varepsilon_0\left|{\mathbf{E}}\right|^2 \, dV.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

So, the energy density, or energy per unit volume &lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{dV}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[electrostatic field]] is:

: &lt;math&gt; u_e = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_0 \left|{\mathbf{E}}\right|^2.&lt;/math&gt;

|}

== Energy stored in electronic elements==
[[File:Electronic component electrolytic capacitors.jpg|right|thumb|150x150px|The electric potential energy stored in a [[capacitor]] is U&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;=½ CV&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]
Some elements in a circuit can convert energy from one form to another. For example, a resistor converts electrical energy to heat. This is known as the [[Joule's first law|Joule effect]]. A [[capacitor]] stores it in its electric field. The total electric potential energy stored in a capacitor is given by

: &lt;math&gt; U_E = \frac{1}{2}QV = \frac{1}{2} CV^2 = \frac{Q^2}{2C}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is the [[capacitance]], ''V'' is the [[electric potential]] difference, and ''Q'' the [[Electric charge|charge]] stored in the capacitor.

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="80%" style="text-align:left"
!Outline of proof
|-
|
One may assemble charges to a capacitor in infinitesimal increments, &lt;math&gt;dq \to 0&lt;/math&gt;, such that the amount of work done to assemble each increment to its final location may be expressed as

: &lt;math&gt; W_q = V dq = \frac{q}{C}dq.&lt;/math&gt;

The total work done to fully charge the capacitor in this way is then

: &lt;math&gt; W = \int dW = \int_0^Q V dq = \frac{1}{C} \int_0^Q qdq = \frac{Q^2}{2C}.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the total charge on the capacitor. This work is stored as electrostatic potential energy, hence,

: &lt;math&gt; W = U_E = \frac{Q^2}{2C}.&lt;/math&gt;

Notably, this expression is only valid if &lt;math&gt;dq \to 0&lt;/math&gt;, which holds for many-charge systems such as large capacitors having metallic electrodes. For few-charge systems the discrete nature of charge is important. The total energy stored in a few-charge capacitor is

: &lt;math&gt; U_E = \frac{Q^2}{C}&lt;/math&gt;

which is obtained by a method of charge assembly utilizing the smallest physical charge increment &lt;math&gt;\Delta q = e&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Elementary charge|elementary unit of charge]] and &lt;math&gt;Q = Ne&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of charges in the capacitor.

|}

The total electrostatic potential energy may also be expressed in terms of the electric field in the form

: &lt;math&gt;U_E = \frac{1}{2}\int_V \mathrm{E}\cdot \mathrm{D} dV&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the displacement of the electric field within a dielectric material and integration is over the entire volume of the dielectric.

The total electrostatic potential energy stored within a charged dielectric may also be expressed in terms of a continuous volume charge, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;U_E = \frac{1}{2} \int_V \rho \Phi dV&lt;/math&gt;

where integration is over the entire volume of the dielectric.

These latter two expressions are valid only for cases when the smallest increment of charge is zero (&lt;math&gt;dq \to 0&lt;/math&gt;) such as dielectrics in the presence of metallic electrodes or dielectrics containing many charges.

'''Fordlândia''' ({{IPA-pt|fɔʁdʒiˈlɐ̃dʒjɐ}}, ''Ford-land'') is a district and adjacent area of 14.268&amp;nbsp;km² in the city of [[Aveiro, Pará|Aveiro]], in the Brazilian state of [[Pará]]. It is located on the east banks of the [[Tapajós|Tapajós river]] roughly 300&amp;nbsp;km south of  the city of [[Santarém, Pará|Santarém]]. It was established by American industrialist [[Henry Ford]] in the [[Amazon Rainforest]] in 1928 as a prefabricated industrial town intended to be inhabited by 10,000 people to secure a source of [[Natural rubber|cultivated rubber]] for the automobile manufacturing operations of the [[Ford Motor Company]] in the [[United States]]. Ford had negotiated a deal with the Brazilian government granting him a concession of {{convert|10000|sqkm|abbr=on}} of land on the banks of the [[Tapajós|Rio Tapajós]] near the city of [[Santarém, Pará|Santarém, Brazil]], in exchange for a 9% share in the profits generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Dempsey |first1=Mary A. |url=http://www.michiganhistorymagazine.com/extra/fordlandia/fordlandia.html |title=Fordlandia |journal=Michigan History |year=1994 |volume=78 |number=4 |pages=24–33 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/418/20080304195857/http://www.michiganhistorymagazine.com/extra/fordlandia/fordlandia.html |archivedate=4 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford's project failed, and the city was abandoned in 1934.

The town was mostly deserted, with only 90 residents still living in the city until the early 2000s when it saw an increase of population, being home to around 3,000 people {{as of|2017||lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/19/lost-cities-10-fordlandia-failure-henry-ford-amazon|title=Lost cities #10: Fordlandia – the failure of Henry Ford's utopian city in the Amazon|first=Drew|last=Reed|date=19 August 2016|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the 1920s, the Ford Motor Company sought to elude British monopoly over the supply of rubber, mainly used for producing tires and other car parts.&lt;ref name="NYT-Romero"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Romero|first1=Simon|title=Deep in Brazil’s Amazon, Exploring the Ruins of Ford’s Fantasyland|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/world/americas/deep-in-brazils-amazon-exploring-the-ruins-of-fords-fantasyland.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=21 February 2017|date=21 Feb 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Ford looked for alternatives and a permanent place to establish a colony to produce rubber. Central America was considered; however, information about the [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber trees]] in the Amazon was uncovered{{who|date=February 2017}}{{clarify|date=February 2017}} and this, along with other factors, caused a change of plans.

Negotiations with the Brazilian government started{{when|date=February 2017}} during the visit by then-governor of the [[Pará|State of Pará]], {{ILL|Dionísio Bentes|pt}} to the United States to meet Ford. An agreement was signed and the American industrialist received an area of about 2.5 million [[acre]]s (10,100 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Macintyre|first1=Ben|title=Dearborn-on-Amazon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/books/review/Macintyre-t.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=21 February 2017|date=July 16, 2009}} Review of Greg Grandin book.&lt;/ref&gt; called "Boa Vista". The agreement exempted Ford from taxes on the exportation of goods produced in Brazil in exchange for 9% of the profits.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==History==
Work on the area began in 1926 by the ''Companhia Ford Industrial do Brasil''. It was immediately hindered by poor logistics and diseases that affected the workers who succumbed to yellow fever and malaria. No roads were available in the area thus the area was only accessible by the Tapajós river. The site was developed as a planned community with different areas of the city being designated to the Brazilian workers and the American managers, who lived in the so-called American Village. Typical American houses were built, as were a hospital, school, library and hotel. The town also had a swimming pool, a playground, and a golf course.

In 1928, Ford Company sent two merchant ships – ''Lake Ormoc'' and ''Lake Farge'' – loaded with equipment and furnishings ranging from door knobs to the town's water tower. The town was then founded under the name Fordlândia.

Seeking workers, several offices were opened in the cities of [[Belém]] and [[Manaus]], and with the promise of good wages people of the nearby states answered.

In lower temperatures the latex is concentrated in the lower areas of the tree, as the temperature rises during the day the latex spreads throughout the tree, making the tapping less effective. Due to this, the typical journey of a rubber tapper began early in the morning, at around 5 am, ending at noon. The plantation was divided into areas and each worker was assigned to a different area to prevent workers from tapping the same trees successively.

The town had a strict set of rules imposed by the managers. Alcohol, women, tobacco and even football were forbidden within the town, including inside the workers' own homes. Inspectors would go from house to house to check how organised the houses were and to enforce these rules. The inhabitants circumvented these prohibitions by paddling out to merchant riverboats moored beyond town jurisdiction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fordlandia: The Rise and Fall of Henry Ford's Forgotten Jungle City|last1=Grandin|first1=Greg|date=June 2009|publisher=Metropolitan Books|isbn=978-0-8050-8236-4}}&lt;!-- ISBN 0-8050-8236-0 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; often hiding contraband goods inside fruits like watermelons. A small settlement was established {{convert|5|mi|sigfig=1|disp=flip}} upstream on the "Island of Innocence" with bars, nightclubs and [[brothel]]s.

The land was hilly, rocky and infertile. None of Ford's managers had the requisite knowledge of [[tropical agriculture]]. In the wild, the rubber trees grow apart from each other as a protection mechanism against plagues and diseases, often growing close to bigger trees of other species for added support. In Fordlândia, however, the trees were planted close together in [[plantation]]s, easy prey for tree [[blight]], sauva ants, lace bugs, red spiders, and leaf caterpillars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehenryford.org/research/rubberPlantations.aspx |title=Rubber Plantations |publisher=Thehenryford.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The workers on the plantations were given unfamiliar food, such as hamburgers and canned food, and forced to live in American-style housing. Most disliked the way they were treated – being required to wear [[ID badge]]s and work through the middle of the day under the tropical sun – and would often refuse to work.

===Revolts===
In 1930, the native workers grew tired of the American food and revolted in the town's cafeteria. This became known as the ''Breaking Pans'' (Portuguese: ''Quebra-Panelas''). The rebels proceeded to cut the telegraph wires and chased away the managers and even the town's cook into the jungle for a few days until the [[Brazilian Army]] arrived and the revolt ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Galey |first1=John |title=Industrialist in the Wilderness: Henry Ford's Amazon Venture |journal=Journal of Interamerican Studies and World Affairs |year=1979 |volume=21 |number=2 |pages=261–289 |issn=0022-1937 |jstor=165528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agreements were then made on the type of food the workers would be served.

===Ford's failure===
The government of Brazil was suspicious of any foreign investments, particularly in the northern Amazonian region, and offered little help. It wasn't long before the numerous problems began to take a toll on the project and the decision was made to relocate. Fordlândia was abandoned by the Ford Company in 1934, and the project was relocated downstream to [[Belterra, Pará|Belterra]], 40&amp;nbsp;km south of the city of Santarém, where better conditions to grow rubber existed. By 1945, [[synthetic rubber]] had been developed, reducing world demand for natural rubber. Ford's investment opportunity dried up overnight without producing any rubber for Ford's tires, and the second town was also abandoned. In 1945, Henry Ford's grandson [[Henry Ford II]] sold the area comprising both towns back to the Brazilian government for a loss of over [[United States dollar|US$]]20 million ($208 million 2013 dollars).

In spite of the huge investment and numerous invitations, Henry Ford never visited either of his ill-fated towns.

===Ministry of Agriculture===
Between the 1950s and late 1970s, after being given back the rights to the lands, the Brazilian government, through its Ministry of Agriculture, installed several facilities in the area. The houses that once belonged to Ford's rubber tappers were then given to the families of the Ministry's employees, whose descendants still occupy them.

This project was also short-lived and left the city nearly completely abandoned upon reaching its end.

==Rebirth==
The town remained inhabited by roughly 90 people until the latter half of the 2000s. No basic services were offered in the area, with medical help only coming by boat in long intervals. That changed when people looking for places to live decided to go back into the town, often claiming houses. The town, now a district of Aveiro, is home to nearly 2,000 people as of 2017.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Facilities==
[[File:Fordlandia - Escritorio local et allée de manguiers.JPG|thumb|Ruins of Fordlândia, circa 2005.]]
[[File:Fordlandia 2.JPG|thumb|Ruins of Fordlândia, circa 2005.]]
Most of the original buildings still stand, with the exception of the hospital, which was dismantled by people looking for valuables.

===Water tower===
Regarded as the symbol of Fordlândia, the 50-meter high water tower is located by the main warehouses. As with most of the equipment in the town, it was built in Michigan and brought to Fordlândia by merchant ship. The water tower, water treatment plant and all of its original plumbing are still operational.

===Hospital===
[[File:FordlandiaHospitalDestroyed.jpg|thumb|Fordlândia Hospital completely dismantled after people removed all of its contents.]]
The hospital was left intact until the late 2000s, when people looking for valuables completely dismantled the hospital and removed its contents.

Before being dismantled, a number of controversies occurred regarding the hospital's X-ray machines. As a local TV station reported, several marked boxes containing radioactive material were left behind. This generated fears of contamination among the population of nearby cities, with people often mentioning the [[Goiânia accident]], causing the authorities to remove the materials following an outcry.

===Sawmill===
The town had a sawmill responsible for providing lumber for all the construction around. The sawmill and kiln still stand; however, most equipment is gone.

===Workshop===
The town's workshop was a three-story warehouse responsible for manufacturing parts for the machines working in the town. It still stands and has most of the original equipment. It is now used as a warehouse where most artifacts from Ford's era are kept. Hospital beds, equipment, a lead coffin and parts of an X-ray machine are stored in this warehouse.

The second floor of the warehouse was allowed to be used for the processing of seeds for a community project. The oil extracted from those seeds greatly accelerated the rotting of the wooden floor which has collapsed in some areas.

===American Village===
The six houses in the American Village still had their original furniture, silverware and even clothes that were left behind when the town was deserted. The houses were claimed by locals and most items were sold or taken as souvenirs. One of the houses was lost to a fire.

'''Hybrid power''' are combinations between different technologies to produce power.

In [[power engineering]], the term 'hybrid' describes a combined power and energy storage system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ginn|first1=Claire|title=Energy pick n’ mix: are hybrid systems the next big thing?|url=https://blog.csiro.au/energy-pick-n-mix-hybrid-systems-next-big-thing/|website=www.csiro.au|publisher=[[CSIRO]]|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It does not mean a "method," such as the popular use of hybrid to mean a [[hybrid electric vehicle]] like the [[Toyota Prius]]. Although the drive train in the Toyota Prius can accurately be described as a hybrid power system.

Examples of power producers used in hybrid power are [[photovoltaics]], [[wind turbine]]s, and various types of [[engine-generator]]s{{snd}} e.g. diesel gen-sets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.powerengineeringint.com/articles/print/volume-19/issue-8/features/fuel-savings-make-a-powerful-case-for-hybrid-diesel-generator-systems.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrid power plants often contain a renewable energy component (such as PV) that is balanced via a second form of generation or storage such as a diesel genset, fuel cell or battery storage system. They can also provide other forms of power such as heat for some applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Badwal|first1=Sukhvinder P.

==Hybrid power system==
Hybrid systems, as the name implies, combine two or more modes of electricity generation together, usually using renewable technologies such as solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbines.  Hybrid systems provide a high level of energy security through the mix of generation methods, and often will incorporate a storage system (battery, [[fuel cell]]) or small fossil fueled generator to ensure maximum supply reliability and security.

When done right, a Hybrid MicroGrid solution can:&lt;br&gt;


– Boost electricity supply system efficiency, flexibility, and reliability&lt;br&gt;

– Cut fuel consumption, emissions, and overall energy costs&lt;br&gt;

– Save 10-30% on operating costs (eg. for an industrial plant or mining operation thereby increasing the company’s profitability)&lt;br&gt;

– Provide a long-term sustainable source of electricity&lt;br&gt;

– Reduce carbon footprints and improve environmental credentials&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26332">The '''International Workingmen's Association''' ('''IWA'''; 1864-1872) in the [[United States of America]] took the form of a loose network of about 35 frequently discordant local "sections," each professing allegiance to the London-based IWA, commonly known as the "First International." These sections were divided geographically and by the language spoken by their members, frequently new immigrants to America, including those who spoke German, French, Czech, as well as Irish and "American" English-language groups.

The peak membership of the various sections of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] in the United States has been variously estimated in the vicinity of 4,000 to 5,000.

==Organizational history==

===Background===
[[File:Wendell Phillips by Brady.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Abolitionist Wendell Phillips was an early supporter of the IWA and the Paris Commune of 1871, an event which boosted that organization in America.]]

The [[International Workingmen's Association]] (IWA), commonly known as the First International, was established in [[London]] in 1864. The organization was initially strictly European in composition, including prominently English, French, German, Polish, and Italian labor leaders and political activists.

The International made its way to American soil in 1866 when Italian [[socialism|socialist]] Cesare Orsini, brother of an attempted assassin of [[Napoleon III]], arrived in the United States in 1866 and attempted to organize an American section.&lt;ref name=TMK6&gt;Timothy Messer-Kruse, ''The Yankee International: Marxism and the American Reform Tradition, 1848-1876.'' Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1998; pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Orsini managed to win the support of a number of a handful of émigré socialists in [[New York City]], in addition to gaining a sympathetic hearing from several prominent political figures, including newspaper editor [[Horace Greeley]], abolitionist orator [[Wendell Phillips]], and radical [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Charles Sumner]].&lt;ref name=TMK6 /&gt;

At the time of its establishment, the International was far from a revolutionary organization, seeking rather to advance the cause of labor through international cooperation of organized workers around a general program based upon the notions of liberty and justice.&lt;ref&gt;Messer-Kruse, ''The Yankee International,'' pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; This somewhat tender trade unionist perspective was not universal among its members, however, as from the outset it gained the participation of German émigrés [[Karl Marx]] and [[Frederick Engels]] and many of their co-thinkers, for whom the purpose of the IWA were not the modest goals of raising wages, lowering working hours, and liberalizing election law through international cooperation, but rather the construction of an international organization as a tool for the winning of state power from the [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref&gt;Messer-Kruse, ''The Yankee International,'' pg. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this era of imperfect transatlantic communications the message of the IWA was spread through personal communication, with parallel networks emerging between Karl Marx and his associates on the one hand and the official "American Corresponding Secretary" of the General Council of the IWA in London.&lt;ref name=TMK58&gt;Messer-Kruse, ''The Yankee International,'' pg. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; In effect these parallel channels of communication replicated the factional divisions of the European organization.&lt;ref name=TMK58 /&gt; The tension between labor-reformist and revolutionary visions of the IWA would find reflection in the factional warfare within the organization in America. [[Andrew Cameron (labor leader)|Andrew Cameron]] was a delegate of the [[National Labor Union]] who attended the [[Basle Congress (1869)]].

===Early New York movement===

In December 1867 a first step towards formal organization on behalf of the International took place in New York City when a call was issued for a meeting to be held the next month at the Germania Assembly Rooms, located in the city's [[Bowery]] district.&lt;ref name=Hillquit177&gt;Morris Hillquit, ''History of Socialism in the United States.'' New York: Funk and Wagnalls Co., 1903; pg. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Those calling the meeting were activists in the German-American labor movement.&lt;ref name=Hillquit177 /&gt; This event was held successfully and served as the foundation convention for an independent political party known as the [[Social Party of New York and Vicinity]].&lt;ref name=Hillquit177 /&gt;

The Social Party adopted a platform which incorporated elements both of the program of the International as well as that of the fledgling [[National Labor Union]] (NLU) established less than two years earlier by [[William H. Sylvis]].&lt;ref name=Hillquit177 /&gt; The group elected parallel Executive Boards, one each for its German-speaking and English-speaking membership.&lt;ref name=Hillquit177 /&gt; These two executive bodies cooperated in naming and running a ticket for city political office in the election of 1868.&lt;ref name=Hillquit177 /&gt; This effort was met with voter apathy, however, and the first campaign of the Social Party of New York also proved to be its last.&lt;ref name=Hillquit177 /&gt;

[[File:Sorge-Friedrich.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Friedrich Sorge (1828-1906), a friend and correspondent of Karl Marx, was the leading figure in Section No. 1 of New York, IWA.]]

Following the 1868 electoral failure, the Social Party of New York dissolved and its leading German-speaking members established a new organization called the ''Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein'' (General German Workers' Association).&lt;ref name=Hillquit177 /&gt; This group had an unabashed international socialist orientation and was later recalled by [[Friedrich Sorge]] to have consisted "almost exclusively" of "plain wage-workers of every possible trade."&lt;ref&gt;F.A. Sorge, "Die Arbeiterbewegung in den Vereinigten Staaten, 1867-1877" (The Labor Movement in the United States, 1867-1877), ''Neue Zeit,'' No. 13 (1891-92), cited in Hillquit, ''History of Socialism in the United States,'' pg. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1869, shortly after its formation, the ''Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein'' was admitted to the National Labor Union as "Labor Union No. 5 of New York."&lt;ref name=Hillquit178&gt;Hillquit, ''History of Socialism in the United States,'' pg. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The group sent delegates to the 1869 and 1870 national conventions of the NLU, but withdrew from the organization immediately after the 1870 conclave.&lt;ref name=Hillquit178 /&gt;

===Section 1===

In the fall of 1869, the ''Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein,'' also known as Labor Union No. 5 of New York, affiliated as a group with the International Workingmen's Association, becoming "Section No. 1 of New York."&lt;ref name=Hillquit178 /&gt; The group would not only become the bulwark of the International in America, but it would ultimately outlive the International itself, terminating only in 1874, two years after the death of the International.&lt;ref name=Hillquit178 /&gt;

Section 1 maintained contacts with various trade unions in New York City and around the country and was instrumental in helping to establish new sections of the International.&lt;ref name=Hillquit178 /&gt; Early in 1870 a French-speaking section was established in New York City, with a Czech-speaking section following the fall of that same year.&lt;ref name=Hillquit178 /&gt;

Communication between the executive of the International in London and the American movement was fragmented, with American sections speaking one or another language communicating directly with corresponding secretaries in that language in London — a situation which was deemed as contributing to factional rivalry and personal animosity.&lt;ref name=Bernstein53&gt;Samuel Bernstein, ''The First International in America.'' New York: Augustus M. Kelley, 1962; pg. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; It was deemed desirable that a single Central Committee should be established in the United States to smooth the transmission of official communications to and from London.&lt;ref name=Bernstein53 /&gt; On October 2, 1870 a joint meeting of the German and French sections of New York City voted to accept the London Council's plan.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, ''The First International in America,'' pp. 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed in December 1870 by the formal launch of the "Central Committee of the International Workingmen's Association for North America" by the German, French, and Czech sections.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, ''The First International in America,'' pg. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Within six months this body would include representatives of 10 sections of the International, including 8 from New York City and 2 from Chicago.&lt;ref name=Foner415&gt;Philip S. Foner, ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Volume 1: From Colonial Times to the Founding of the American Federation of Labor.'' New York: International Publishers, 1947; pg. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; This would be the formal governing body of the IWA in America.

===Growth of the IWA in America===
[[File:Communards in their Coffins.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The defeat of the Paris Commune in May 1871 was followed by harsh reprisals against the defeated revolutionaries.]]

The IWA was not geographically limited to New York City and its environs. In actual fact the first formal section of the International was established in the West Coast city of San Francisco in March 1869.&lt;ref name=Bernstein61&gt;Bernstein, ''The First International in America,'' pg. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year supporters of the International were playing a role in the movement for the [[8-hour day]] in San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, and New York.&lt;ref name=Bernstein61 /&gt;

Growth of the IWA in America was spurred enormously by the launch of the [[Paris Commune]] on March 26, 1871. Vilified by the conservative press, iconoclasts and radicals of all stripes in America rallied to the revolutionary city government of Paris, which was closely linked with the International Workingmen's Association in the public mind, if not in actual practice.&lt;ref name=TMK100&gt;Messer-Kruse, ''The Yankee International,'' pg. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Parisian barricades were overrun by defenders of the old regime in May amidst a bloody reaction that claimed as many as 20,000 lives, the French events nevertheless occupied the thinking of a generation in much in the same way that the Russian Revolution of 1917 would have a polarizing and far reaching impact nearly half a century later.&lt;ref name=TMK100 /&gt;

While most of the American press denounced the revolutionaries of Paris, radical reformers took up the revolutionary vision in the pages of their own journals.&lt;ref name=TMK101&gt;Messer-Kruse, ''The Yankee International,'' pg. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''National Anti-Slavery Standard'' carried regular dispatches from Paris and kept its readers informed of the legal and political retribution levied against Commune leaders in the aftermath of the failed uprising.&lt;ref name=TMK101 /&gt; The Boston magazine ''Commonwealth,'' established by a Southern abolitionist minister, likewise defended the Commune in its pages.&lt;ref&gt;Messer-Kruse, ''The Yankee International,'' pg. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; So, too, did radical abolitionist Wendell Phillips, who declared, "There is no hope for France but in the Reds."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Messer-Kruse, ''The Yankee International,'' pg. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the abolitionist movement, an additional source of broad support for the goals and methods of the Paris Commune came via various newspapers associated with the [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]] movement.&lt;ref name=TM103&gt;Messer-Kruse, ''The Yankee International,'' pg. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest Spiritualist weekly, ''[[Banner of Light]],'' attempted to explain for its readers the motivations and actions of the Communards, declaring they were "weary of the servitude that practically accompanies the wages condition, when all exercise of political power is denied it."&lt;ref&gt;''Banner of Light,'' July 15, 1871, quoted in Messer-Kruse, ''The Yankee International,'' pp. 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

By September 1871 there were 19 sections of the International in the USA, of which 3 were "American" and 16 were non-English speaking.&lt;ref name="Bernstein61"/&gt; Eight more sections were added the next month and another 7 in November.&lt;ref name=Bernstein61 /&gt; By the end of 1871 the IWA in America included a total of about 35 sections,&lt;ref name=Bernstein61 /&gt; including groups in [[Philadelphia]], [[Washington, DC]], [[St. Louis]], [[New Orleans]],&lt;ref name="Bernstein61"/&gt; [[Newark, New Jersey]], and [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], among other places.&lt;ref name=Hillquit178 /&gt;

While no hard membership data is extant, scholarly estimates of the total number of American participants have generally clustered in the vicinity of 5,000,&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Hillquit, ''History of Socialism in the United States,'' pg. 179; Foner, ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Volume 1,'' pg. 413; Messer-Kruse, ''The Yankee International,'' pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Bernstein (historian)|Samuel Bernstein]], perhaps the most careful scholar of the subject, indicates that total membership "very likely did not go beyond 4,000, after the increase in the first part of 1872."&lt;ref name="Bernstein61"/&gt;

===Section 12===
[[File:Victoria Woodhull.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Victoria Woodhull (1838-1927) - Spiritualist, feminist, stockbroker, reform advocate, leader of Section 12, and 1872 candidate for President of the United States.]]

The French events also seem to have helped radicalize [[Victoria Woodhull]] and her sister [[Tennessee Claflin]], editors in 1870 of the eclectic ''[[Woodhull &amp; Claflin's Weekly]].''&lt;ref name=TMK106&gt;Messer-Kruse, ''The Yankee International,'' pg. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Woodhull and Claflin were daughters of a religious revivalist mother and a father reckoned by his contemporaries as a grifter; Victoria had attempted to escape through marriage at age 15, while Tennessee had been exploited as a purported psychic healer and namesake of a homebrewed quack remedy concocted by her parents, "Miss Tennessee's Magnetio Life Elixir for Beautifying the Complexion and Cleansing the Blood."&lt;ref name=TMK107 /&gt;

Following Victoria's divorce from her drunken and philandering first husband, the pair set up shop as "Tennessee Claflin and Victoria Woodhull, Clairvoyants" and managed to stack up a substantial nest egg from gullible believers.&lt;ref name=TMK108&gt;Messer-Kruse, ''The Yankee International,'' pg. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Their list of satisfied clients ultimately included among them none other than [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], one of the country's richest men.&lt;ref name=TMK108 /&gt;

Backed with Vanderbilt's cash through silent partnership, in 1870 the sisters Woodhull and Claflin had become [[stockbrokers]], establishing the first brokerage managed by women up to that date.&lt;ref name=TMK109&gt;Messer-Kruse, ''The Yankee International,'' pg. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; It was with the profits from Woodhull, Claflin &amp; Co. that ''Woodhull and Claflin's Weekly'' had sprung.&lt;ref name=TMK109 /&gt; The paper's reformist political line, was pumped up and made profitable with a sensationalistic approach and a hyperbolic writing style.&lt;ref name=TMK109 /&gt; Covering a broad range of subjects running the gamut from abolitionism to feminism to labor reform to Spiritualism, in 1871 the paper dedicated significant coverage to the Paris Commune and the entity commonly imagined to be behind it, the IWA.&lt;ref name=TMK106 /&gt;

The paper reprinted official documents of the International and ran an interview with Karl Marx himself, with Marx returning the favor by providing the controversial female editors with a first-hand account by his daughter [[Jenny Longuet|Jenny]] of her expulsion from France.&lt;ref name=TMK106 /&gt; It was an unlikely vehicle for the social revolution and the opportunistic sisters with their unconventional lifestyle deeply alienated the German international socialists of Section 1.

Woodhull and Claflin were instrumental in the organization of a second English-language branch of the International in New York City, IWA Branch 12, making use of the newspaper's office as a meeting location.&lt;ref name=TMK106 /&gt; Section 12 attracted a wide range of dissident intellectuals, including in the first place tinsmith and abolitionist William West.&lt;ref name=TMK107&gt;Messer-Kruse, ''The Yankee International,'' pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Also active in Section 12 was [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], an abolitionist who had previously established a failed utopian socialist community on [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]] called "Modern Times."&lt;ref name=TMK110&gt;Messer-Kruse, ''The Yankee International,'' pg. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrews had later established a commune on Manhattan called "Unitary Home" and had with his wife launched a political group called the New Democracy, members of which went on to help launch Sections 9 and 12 of the IWA in New York City.&lt;ref name=TMK110 /&gt;

===Factional strife===

A sharp difference of opinion emerged between the committed centralists of German-speaking Branch 1 of New York City and the predominantly middle class English-speaking Branches 9, 12, and 26 — with Branch 12 in the leading role.&lt;ref name=Bernstein112&gt;Bernstein, ''The First International in America,'' pg. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; These latter have been described by historian Samuel Bernstein as "American autonomists," who

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"by reason of faith in their respective blueprints of what America ought to be, counted first, on the spread of enlightenment and the democratic process to cleanse government of corruption, and then, on meliorative laws to direct the nation toward their primal model. Thus a boundary divided autonomists; but they lined up together against centralized authority."&lt;ref name=Bernstein112 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section 12 disputed the authority of the Central Committee, dominated by Section 1, writing a letter to the General Council in London in the fall of 1871 calling for it to take control over the entire American movement.&lt;ref name=Bernstein115&gt;Bernstein, ''The First International in America,'' pg. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 12 had its friends on the General Council, including general secretary John Hales and corresponding secretary for the United States [[George Eccarius]].&lt;ref name=Bernstein115 /&gt; It pushed forward with its own program of eclectic social reform in 1872, bringing a protest from the doctrinaire international socialists of Section 1, who demanded the suspension from the organization for their ideological heresy of their erstwhile comrades.&lt;ref name=Hillquit180&gt;Hillquit, ''History of Socialism in the United States,'' pg. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fight for control of the American movement ensured, with Section 1 in the minority, supported by most of the German and the Irish sections, with Section 12 winning the American, two of the German, and most of the French sections for its program.&lt;ref name=Hillquit180 /&gt; In response, Section 1 and its supporters split the IWA, establishing a new governing body called the Federal Council.&lt;ref name=Hillquit180 /&gt; Both Section 12 and Section 1 appealed to the General Council in London to resolve the dispute.&lt;ref name=Hillquit180 /&gt; In March 1872 the General Council issued its ruling, suspending Section 12 from the organization and ordering the two rival executive bodies to unite into a single provisional committee pending formal resolution at the next national convention.&lt;ref name=Hillquit180 /&gt;

Section 12 continued an independent existence, ultimately convening its own convention at the [[Apollo Theater]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=Hillquit180 /&gt; This gathering nominated a ticket headed by Victoria Woodhull as its candidate for President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Hillquit, ''History of Socialism in the United States,'' pp. 180-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main body of the IWA opened its 1st National Convention in New York on July 6, 1872, with representatives of 22 sections in attendance.&lt;ref name=Hillquit181&gt;Hillquit, ''History of Socialism in the United States,'' pg. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The gathering adopted a new formal name for the American organization — the North American Federation of the International Workingmen's Association — as well as compiling a new set of organizational bylaws.&lt;ref name=Hillquit181 /&gt;

===Move of IWA headquarters to New York===
[[File:Bakunin.png|thumb|right|200px|Mikhail Bakunin (1814-1876) an émigré from Tsarist Russia, was an anarchist theoretician and competitor with Marx for control of the IWA.]]

The Americans were not the only national division of the International fighting a factional war for control of the organization. The General Council, which had long been divided between moderate trade union reformers and international socialist revolutionaries, was becoming the object of a still greater fight — a battle between [[anarchism|anarchists]] and socialists.&lt;ref name=JB175&gt;Julius Braunthal, ''History of the International: Volume 1, 1864-1914'' [1961]. Henry Collins and Kenneth Mitchell, trans. New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1967; pg. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; More than an ideological battle, this struggle also fell into the realm of personal antipathy between the primary leaders of the two wings, the German émigré Karl Marx and the Russian émigré [[Mikhail Bakunin]].&lt;ref name=JB175 /&gt;

Marx saw a socialist future as the inevitable result of a process of economic growth and development, with the revolutionary transformation making it possible conducted by an educated and disciplined working class led by a political party.&lt;ref name=JB175 /&gt; In the view of Bakunin, the new world would emerge via the revolt of the poor and oppressed masses, workers and peasant farmers alike, suffering under the heel of an exploitative semi-feudal economic and political structure.&lt;ref name=JB175 /&gt; Bakunin was contemptuous of the educated industrial workers favored by Marx, believing they were "infected with a bourgeois outlook," and instead favored an alliance of radical intellectuals, the peasant masses,  as well as the most impoverished and unwashed workers of the cities.&lt;ref name=JB175 /&gt; 

Bakunin rejected the coordinated trade union and political action favored by the international socialists, instead professing the expedience and necessity of the armed uprising.&lt;ref name=JB176&gt;Braunthal, ''History of the International: Volume 1,'' pg. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; He sought the forcible destruction of state power and its replacement with what historian [[Juilius Braunthal]] has characterized as a "stateless federation of communes free from all outside coercion and authority."&lt;ref name=JB176 /&gt; Marx, on the other hand, saw a long process of education and organization as a necessary precursor for a revolutionary overthrow of the ruling class, followed by a "withering away" of the coercive state in the new non-exploitative world.&lt;ref name=JB176 /&gt; In short, Bakunin and Marx agreed upon little, rejected the fundamental ideas of the other, and saw themselves as antagonistic rivals locked in a irreconcilable conflict for control of the fledgling IWA organization.

'''Krystyna Chojnowska-Liskiewicz''' (born 15 July 1936, in [[Poland]]) is the first woman to [[sailing|have sailed]] [[single-handed sailing|single-handed]] (i.e. solo) around the world, repeating the accomplishment of [[Joshua Slocum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joshuaslocumsocietyintl.org/solo/solotable.htm ''List Of Solo Circumnavigators''], from the Joshua Slocum Society International&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solocircumnavigation.com/SoloSailingCircumnavigation/SinglehandedCircumnavigators.htm ''Solo Oceans Sailing &amp; Racing''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410181453/http://www.solocircumnavigation.com/SoloSailingCircumnavigation/SinglehandedCircumnavigators.htm |date=10 April 2008 }} from solocircumnavigation.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sport.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=%2Fsport%2F2004%2F02%2F04%2Fsoyots04.xml ''Joyon's strength and skill shatters two solo records''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222131721/http://sport.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=%2Fsport%2F2004%2F02%2F04%2Fsoyots04.xml |date=22 February 2006 }}, from Telegraph Sport&lt;/ref&gt;  She sailed from the [[Canary Islands]] on 28 February 1976, and returned there on 21 April 1978, completing a [[circumnavigation]] of 31,166&amp;nbsp;nautical miles (57,719&amp;nbsp;km) in 401 days.

== The boat ==
Krystyna Chojnowska-Liskiewicz carried out her westabout (east to west) voyage on ''Mazurek'', a Conrad 32 [[sloop]] built in [[Poland]].  ''Mazurek'' was 9.51&amp;nbsp;metres (31.2&amp;nbsp;ft) long, with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of 2.70&amp;nbsp;metres (8.86&amp;nbsp;ft) and a [[sail]] area of 35&amp;nbsp;square metres (376.7&amp;nbsp;ft²).  ''Mazurek''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s construction team was headed by Chojnowska-Liskiewicz's husband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poland.gov.pl/?document=1982 ''The First Lady of the oceans''], from Polska (Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs tourism website)&lt;/ref&gt;

== The voyage ==
She set sail from the [[Canary Islands]] on 28 February 1976, crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to [[Barbados]].  She then sailed through the [[Caribbean Sea]] to the [[Panama Canal]], and hence to the [[Pacific Ocean]].

After crossing the Pacific, Chojnowska-Liskiewicz sailed via [[Tahiti]] and [[Fiji]] to [[Australia]], and then west across the [[Indian Ocean]] via [[Mauritius]].  After passing the [[Cape of Good Hope]], she sailed north, and crossed her outbound track on 20 March 1978 at latitude 16°&amp;nbsp;08.5' north and longitude 35°&amp;nbsp;50' west.

Chojnowska-Liskiewicz completed her voyage when she entered the port of [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] on 21 April 1978, having sailed {{convert|31166|nmi|km}} in 401 days.  On 18 June 1978, she returned to Poland, where she is still seen as something of a national hero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaaf.org/magazine/news/Kind=262144/newsId=29358.html ''Rogowska: the latest Pole to vault to the top''], International Association of Athletics Associations&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other contenders for the title ==
In completing her voyage, Chojnowska-Liskiewicz  only narrowly beat [[Naomi James]], who completed her own single-handed circumnavigation on 8 June 1978.  James' voyage is itself notable, however; she completed a fast (although not non-stop) circumnavigation in just 272 days, thus improving on Sir [[Francis Chichester]]’s solo round-the-world sailing record by two days.  She also became the first woman to single-handedly sail the [[clipper route]], eastabout and south of the three [[great capes]], starting and finishing in the [[English Channel]] (a requirement for speed records).

In 1988, [[Kay Cottee]] of Australia became the first woman to complete a ''non-stop'' single-handed circumnavigation, on ''Blackmore's First Lady''.

[[File:Leidenfrost droplet.svg|thumb|Leidenfrost droplet]]
[[File:18. Лајденфростов ефект.webm|thumb|Demonstration of the Leidenfrost effect]]

The '''Leidenfrost effect''' is a physical [[phenomenon]] in which a liquid, in near contact with a mass significantly hotter than the liquid's [[boiling point]], produces an insulating [[vapor]] layer keeping that liquid from [[boiling]] rapidly.  Because of this 'repulsive force', a droplet hovers over the surface rather than making physical contact with it.  This is most commonly seen when [[cooking]]: one sprinkles drops of water in a pan to gauge its temperature: if the pan's [[temperature]] is at or above the Leidenfrost point, the water skitters across the pan and takes longer to evaporate than in a pan with a temperature below the Leidenfrost point but still above boiling. It is named after [[Johann Gottlob Leidenfrost]], who discussed it in ''A Tract About Some Qualities of Common Water'' in 1751.

The effect is responsible for the ability of liquid nitrogen to skitter across floors. It also allows a person to dip a wet finger in molten [[lead]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Willey|first1=David|title=The Physics Behind Four Amazing Demonstrations|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=1999|volume=23|issue=6|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/physics_behind_four_amazing_demonstrations/|accessdate=11 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013213439/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/physics_behind_four_amazing_demonstrations/|archivedate=13 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or blow out a mouthful of [[liquid nitrogen]], without injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=Jearl|title=Boiling and the Leidenfrost Effect|journal=Fundamentals of Physics|pages=1–4|url=http://www.wiley.com/college/phy/halliday320005/pdf/leidenfrost_essay.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904122959/http://www.wiley.com/college/phy/halliday320005/pdf/leidenfrost_essay.pdf|archivedate=4 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is potentially lethal, particularly should one accidentally swallow the liquid nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Gulps Into Medical Literature |url=http://www.wpi.edu/news/19989/nitro.html |publisher=[[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] |accessdate=11 October 2014 |date=20 January 1999 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222192214/http://www.wpi.edu/news/19989/nitro.html |archivedate=22 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details ==
[[File:Effet leidenfrost.ogg|thumb|A video clip demonstrating the Leidenfrost effect]]
[[File:Spherical harmonic in water drop.ogv|thumb|Excitation of [[normal modes]] in a drop of water during the Leidenfrost effect]]

The effect can be seen as drops of water are sprinkled onto a pan at various times as it heats up. Initially, as the temperature of the pan is just below {{convert|100|C|F}}, the water flattens out and slowly evaporates, or if the temperature of the pan is well below {{convert|100|C|F}}, the water stays liquid. As the temperature of the pan goes above {{convert|100|C|F}}, the water droplets hiss when touching the pan and these droplets evaporate quickly. Later, as the temperature exceeds the Leidenfrost point, the Leidenfrost effect comes into play. On contact with the pan, the water droplets bunch up into small balls of water and skitter around, lasting much longer than when the temperature of the pan was lower. This effect works until a much higher temperature causes any further drops of water to evaporate too quickly to cause this effect.

This is because at temperatures above the Leidenfrost point, the bottom part of the water droplet vaporizes immediately on contact with the hot pan. The resulting gas suspends the rest of the water droplet just above it, preventing any further direct contact between the liquid water and the hot pan.  As steam has much poorer [[thermal conductivity]] than the metal pan, further heat transfer between the pan and the droplet is slowed down dramatically. This also results in the drop being able to skid around the pan on the layer of gas just under it.

[[File:Heat transfer leading to Leidenfrost effect for water at 1 atm.png|thumb|Behavior of water on a hot plate. Graph shows heat transfer (flux) vs temperature. Leidenfrost effect occurs after transition boiling.]]

The temperature at which the Leidenfrost effect begins to occur is not easy to predict. Even if the volume of the drop of liquid stays the same, the Leidenfrost point may be quite different, with a complicated dependence on the properties of the surface, as well as any impurities in the liquid. Some research has been conducted into a theoretical model of the system, but it is quite complicated.&lt;ref name="Bernardin &amp; Mudawar" &gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1115/1.1470487 |title=A Cavity Activation and Bubble Growth Model of the Leidenfrost Point |journal=Journal of Heat Transfer |volume=124 |issue=5 |pages=864–74 |date=2002 |last1=Bernardin |first1=John D. |last2=Mudawar |first2=Issam}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a very rough estimate, the Leidenfrost point for a drop of water on a frying pan might occur at {{convert|193|C|F}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The effect was also described by the eminent Victorian steam boiler designer, [[Sir William Fairbairn]], in reference to its effect on massively reducing heat transfer from a hot iron surface to water, such as within a boiler. In a pair of lectures on boiler design,&lt;ref name="Fairbairn"&gt;{{cite book |title=Two Lectures: The Construction of Boilers, and on Boiler Explosions, with the means of prevention |author=[[William Fairbairn]] |date=1851 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VD5MAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=fairbairn%20boiler&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123164123/https://books.google.com/books?id=VD5MAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=fairbairn%20boiler&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2017-11-23 |df= }}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; he cited the work of Pierre Hippolyte Boutigny (1798-1884) and Professor Bowman of [[King's College, London]] in studying this. A drop of water that was vaporized almost immediately at {{convert|168|C}} persisted for 152 seconds at {{convert|202|C}}. Lower temperatures in a boiler [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] might evaporate water more quickly as a result; compare [[Mpemba effect]]. An alternative approach was to increase the temperature beyond the Leidenfrost point. Fairbairn considered this too, and may have been contemplating the [[flash boiler|flash steam boiler]], but considered the technical aspects insurmountable for the time.

The Leidenfrost point may also be taken to be the temperature for which the hovering droplet lasts longest.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Incropera, DeWitt, Bergman &amp; Lavine: Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer, 6th edition. Pages 325-330&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been demonstrated that it is possible to stabilize the Leidenfrost vapour layer of water by exploiting [[superhydrophobic]] surfaces. In this case, once the vapour layer is established, cooling never collapses the layer, and no nucleate boiling occurs; the layer instead slowly relaxes until the surface is cooled.&lt;ref name="vakarelski2012"&gt;{{cite journal  |doi=10.1038/nature11418 |pmid=22972299 |title=Stabilization of Leidenfrost vapour layer by textured superhydrophobic surfaces |journal=Nature |volume=489 |issue=7415 |pages=274–7 |date=2012 |last1=Vakarelski |first1=Ivan U. |last2=Patankar |first2=Neelesh A. |last3=Marston |first3=Jeremy O. |last4=Chan |first4=Derek Y. C. |last5=Thoroddsen |first5=Sigurdur T. |bibcode=2012Natur.489..274V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leidenfrost effect has been used for the development of high sensitivity ambient mass spectrometry. Under the influence of Leidenfrost condition the Levitating droplet does not release molecules out and the molecules are enriched inside the droplet. At the last moment of droplet evaporation all of the enriched molecules release in a short time domain and thus increase the sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Leidenfrost Phenomenon-assisted Thermal Desorption (LPTD) and Its Application to Open Ion Sources at Atmospheric Pressure Mass Spectrometry| journal=Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry |authors=Subhrakanti Saha, Lee Chuin Chen, Mridul Kanti Mandal, Kenzo Hiraoka | date=March 2013 | volume=24 | issue=3 | pages=341–7 | doi=10.1007/s13361-012-0564-y|bibcode = 2013JASMS..24..341S | pmid=23423791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[heat engine]] based on the Leidenfrost effect has been prototyped.  It has the advantage of extremely low friction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=Gary G.|last2=Ledesma-Aguilar|first2=Rodrigio|last3=McHale|first3=Glen|last4=Sefiane|first4=Khellil|title=A sublimation heat engine|journal=Nature Communications|date=3 March 2015|doi=10.1038/ncomms7390|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150303/ncomms7390/full/ncomms7390.html|accessdate=5 March 2015|bibcode=2015NatCo...6E6390W|volume=6|pages=6390|pmid=25731669|pmc=4366496|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307073730/http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150303/ncomms7390/full/ncomms7390.html|archivedate=7 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leidenfrost point ==
[[File:Water droplet Leidenfrost effect cropped.JPG|thumb|A water droplet experiencing Leidenfrost effect on a hot stove plate]]

The Leidenfrost point signifies the onset of stable film boiling. It represents the point on the boiling curve where the heat flux is at the minimum and the surface is completely covered by a vapor blanket. Heat transfer from the surface to the liquid occurs by conduction and radiation through the vapor. In 1756, Leidenfrost observed that water droplets supported by the vapor film slowly evaporate as they move about on the hot surface. As the surface temperature is increased, radiation through the vapor film becomes more significant and the heat flux increases with increasing excess temperature.

The minimum heat flux for a large horizontal plate can be derived from Zuber's equation,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{{\frac{q}{A}}_{min}}=C{{h}_{fg}}{{\rho }_{v}}{{\left[ \frac{\sigma g\left( {{\rho }_{L}}-{{\rho }_{v}} \right)}{{{\left( {{\rho }_{L}}+{{\rho }_{v}} \right)}^{2}}} \right]}^{{}^{1}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{4}\;}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the properties are evaluated at saturation temperature. Zuber's constant, C is approximately 0.09 for most fluids at moderate pressures.

== Heat transfer correlations ==

The heat transfer coefficient may be approximated using Bromley's equation,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;h=C{{\left[ \frac{k_{v}^{3}{{\rho }_{v}}g\left( {{\rho }_{L}}-{{\rho }_{v}} \right)\left( {{h}_{fg}}+0.4{{c}_{pv}}\left( {{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{sat}} \right) \right)}{{{D}_{o}}{{\mu }_{v}}\left( {{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{sat}} \right)} \right]}^{{}^{1}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{4}\;}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where, &lt;math&gt;{{D}_{o}}&lt;/math&gt; is the outside diameter of the tube. The correlation constant C is 0.62 for horizontal cylinders and vertical plates and 0.67 for spheres. Vapor properties are evaluated at film temperature.

For stable film boiling on a horizontal surface, Berenson has modified Bromley's equation to yield,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;James R. Welty; Charles E. Wicks; Robert E. Wilson; Gregory L. Rorrer., "Fundamentals of Momentum, Heat and Mass transfer" 5th edition, John Wiley and Sons. Page 327&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;h=0.425{{\left[ \frac{k_{vf}^{3}{{\rho }_{vf}}g\left( {{\rho }_{L}}-{{\rho }_{v}} \right)\left( {{h}_{fg}}+0.4{{c}_{pv}}\left( {{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{sat}} \right) \right)}{{{\mu }_{vf}}\left( {{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{sat}} \right)\sqrt{\sigma /g\left( {{\rho }_{L}}-{{\rho }_{v}} \right)}} \right]}^{{}^{1}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{4}\;}}&lt;/math&gt;

For vertical tubes, Hsu and Westwater have correlated the following equation,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;h{{\left[ \frac{\mu _{v}^{2}}{g{{\rho }_{v}}\left( {{\rho }_{L}}-{{\rho }_{v}} \right)k_{v}^{3}} \right]}^{{}^{1}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{3}\;}}=0.0020{{\left[ \frac{4m}{\pi {{D}_{v}}{{\mu }_{v}}} \right]}^{0.6}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where, m is the mass flow rate in &lt;math&gt;l{{b}_{m}}/hr&lt;/math&gt; at the upper end of the tube

At excess temperatures above that at the minimum heat flux, the contribution of radiation becomes appreciable and becomes dominant at high excess temperatures. The total heat transfer coefficient can be is thus a combination of the two. Bromley has suggested the following equations for film boiling boiling from the outer surface of horizontal tubes.

&lt;math&gt;{{h}^{{}^{4}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{3}\;}}={{h}_{conv}}^{{}^{4}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{3}\;}+{{h}_{rad}}{{h}^{{}^{1}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{3}\;}}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;{{h}_{rad}}&lt;{{h}_{conv}}&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;h={{h}_{conv}}+\frac{3}{4}{{h}_{rad}}&lt;/math&gt;

The effective radiation coefficient, &lt;math&gt;{{h}_{rad}}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as,

&lt;math&gt;{{h}_{rad}}=\frac{\varepsilon \sigma \left( T_{s}^{4}-T_{sat}^{4} \right)}{\left( {{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{sat}} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; is the emissivity of the solid and &lt;math&gt;\sigma &lt;/math&gt; is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

== Pressure field in a Leidenfrost droplet ==

The equation for the pressure field in the vapor region between the droplet and the solid surface can be solved for using the standard momentum and [[continuity equations]].  For the sake of simplicity in solving, a linear temperature profile and a parabolic velocity profile are assumed within the [[vapor phase]]. The heat transfer within the vapor phase is assumed to be through [[Conduction (heat)|conduction]]. With these approximations, the Navier-Stokes equation can be solved&lt;ref&gt;Carey, Van P. , Liquid Vapor Phase change Phenomena&lt;/ref&gt; to get the pressure field.

== Leidenfrost temperature and surface tension effects ==

The Leidenfrost temperature is the property of a given set of solid-liquid pair. The temperature of the solid surface beyond which the liquid undergoes Leidenfrost phenomenon is termed as Leidenfrost temperature. The calculation of Leidenfrost temperature involves the calculation of minimum film boiling temperature of a fluid. Berenson&lt;ref&gt;Berenson, P.J., ''[http://heattransfer.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=1432357 Film boiling heat transfer from a horizontal surface] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402125436/http://heattransfer.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=1432357 |date=2015-04-02 }}'', Journal of Heat Transfer, Volume 83, 1961, Pages 351-362&lt;/ref&gt; obtained a relation for the minimum film boiling temperature from minimum heat flux arguments. While the equation for the minimum film boiling temperature, which can be found in the reference above, is quite complex, the features of it can be understood from a physical perspective.  One critical parameter to consider is the [[surface tension]]. The proportional relationship between the minimum film boiling temperature and surface tension is to be expected since fluids with higher surface tension need higher quantities of heat flux for the onset of [[nucleate boiling]]. Since film boiling occurs after nucleate boiling, the minimum temperature for film boiling should have a proportional dependence on the surface tension.

Henry developed a model for Leidenfrost phenomenon which includes transient wetting and microlayer evaporation.&lt;ref&gt;Henry, R.E., ''[A correlation for the minimum film boiling temperature]'',Chem. Eng. Prog. Symp. Ser. , Volume 70, 1974, Pages 81-90&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Leidenfrost phenomenon is a special case of film boiling, the Leidenfrost temperature is related to the minimum film boiling temperature via a relation which factors in the properties of the solid being used. While the Leidenfrost temperature is not directly related to the surface tension of the fluid, it is indirectly dependent on it through the film boiling temperature. For fluids with similar thermophysical properties, the one with higher surface tension usually has a higher Leidenfrost temperature.

For example, for a saturated water-copper interface, the Leidenfrost temperature is {{convert|257|C}}. The Leidenfrost temperatures for glycerol and common alcohols are significantly smaller because of their lower surface tension values (density and [[viscosity]] differences are also contributing factors.)

Non-volatile materials were discovered in 2015 to also exhibit a 'reactive Leidenfrost effect,' whereby solid particles were observed to float above hot surfaces and skitter around erratically.&lt;ref&gt;"Scientists levitate wood on structured surfaces captured by high speed photography" Phys.org. {{cite web |url=http://phys.org/news/2015-06-scientists-levitate-wood-surfaces-captured.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611164453/http://phys.org/news/2015-06-scientists-levitate-wood-surfaces-captured.html |archivedate=2015-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Detailed characterization of the reactive Leidenfrost effect was completed for small particles of [[cellulose]] (~0.5&amp;nbsp;mm) on high temperature polished surfaces by high speed photography.  Cellulose was shown to decompose to short-chain [[oligomers]] which melt and wet smooth surfaces with increasing heat transfer associated with increasing surface temperature. Above {{convert|675|C}}, cellulose was observed to exhibit transition boiling with violent bubbling and associated reduction in heat transfer.  Liftoff of the cellulose droplet (depicted at the right) was observed to occur above about {{convert|750|C}} associated with a dramatic reduction in heat transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =  Teixeira| first1 =  Andrew R| last2 =  Krumm| first2 =  Christoph| last3 =  Vinter| first3 =  Katherine P| last4 =  Paulsen| first4 =  Alex D| last5 =  Zhu| first5 =  Cheng| last6 =  Maduskar| first6 =  Saurabh| last7 =  Joseph| first7 =  Kristeen E| last8 =  Greco| first8 =  Katharine| last9 =  Stelatto| first9 =  Michael| last10 =  Davis| first10 =  Eric| last11 =  Vincent| first11 =  Brendon| last12 =  Hermann| first12 =  Richard| last13 =  Suszynski| first13 =  Wieslaw| last14 =  Schmidt| first14 =  Lanny D| last15 =  Fan| first15 =  Wei| last16 =  Rothstein| first16 =  Jonathan P| last17 =  Dauenhauer| first17 =  Paul J| year = 2015 | title = Reactive Liftoff of Crystalline Cellulose Particles | url = http://www.nature.com/articles/srep11238 | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 5 | issue =  | page = 11238 | doi = 10.1038/srep11238 | pmid =  26057818| pmc =  4460903| bibcode = 2015NatSR...511238T | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117162337/http://www.nature.com/articles/srep11238 | archivedate = 2015-11-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

High speed photography of the reactive Leidenfrost effect of cellulose on porous surfaces (macroporous [[alumina]]) was also shown to suppress the reactive Leidenfrost effect and enhance overall heat transfer rates to the particle from the surface.  The new phenomenon of a 'reactive Leidenfrost (RL) effect' was characterized by a dimensionless quantity (φ&lt;sub&gt;RL&lt;/sub&gt;= τ&lt;sub&gt;conv&lt;/sub&gt;/τ&lt;sub&gt;rxn&lt;/sub&gt;), which relates the time constant of solid particle heat transfer to the time constant of particle reaction, with the reactive Leidenfrost effect occurring for 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt; φ&lt;sub&gt;RL&lt;/sub&gt;&lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;.  The reactive Leidenfrost effect with cellulose will occur in numerous high temperature applications with carbohydrate polymers including biomass conversion to [[biofuels]], preparation and [[cooking]] of food, and [[tobacco]] use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scientists Levitate Wood on Structured Surfaces Captured by High Speed Photography |date=June 9, 2015 |url=http://www.newswire.com/press-release/scientists-levitate-wood-on-structured-surfaces-captured-by |website=www.newswire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jules Verne]]'s 1876 book ''[[Michael Strogoff]]'', the protagonist is saved from being blinded with a hot blade by evaporating tears.&lt;ref&gt;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6946/ff2f44746f410a42782e3347bce06d7fca16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 season 7 finale of ''[[MythBusters]]'', "[[MythBusters (2009 season)#Lead Plunge|Mini Myth Mayhem]]", the team demonstrated that a person can wet their hand and briefly dip it into molten [[lead]] without injury, using the Leidenfrost effect as the scientific basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Mini-Myth Mayhem |url=https://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/full-episodes/mini-myth-mayhem |series=Mythbusters |series-link=Mythbusters |network=Discovery Channel |date=December 28, 2009 |season=7 |number=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of Corbett mountains in Scotland by height'''.

The first list was compiled in the 1920s by [[John Rooke Corbett]], a Bristol-based climber and [[Scottish Mountaineering Club]] ("SMC") member, and was published posthumously, after his sister passed it to the SMC, in the 1953 edition of ''Munro's Tables''.&lt;ref name="cor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="munros"&gt;{{cite book| last=Bearhop | first=D.A. | year=1997 | title=Munro's Tables | isbn=0-907521-53-3 | publisher=Scottish Mountaineering Club &amp; Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Corbetts are the next category down from the [[Lists of mountains and hills in the British Isles#Munros|Munros and Munro Tops]] in terms of height (e.g. below the {{convert|3000|ft|1}} threshold), but their explicit prominence threshold of {{convert|500|ft|0}}, ensure they are material peaks.&lt;ref name="cor"/&gt;  By definition, all Corbetts, given their prominence, are [[Lists of mountains and hills in the British Isles#Marilyns|Marilyns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/Corbetts.php|title=The Corbets|date=2018|publisher=HillBaggingUK|quote=A Corbett is "a Scottish hill between 2500 and 2999 feet high with a drop of at least 500 feet (152.4m) on all sides".  They are named after the list's compiler, J.Rooke Corbett. The Corbetts are a subset of the Marilyns.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The SMC keeps a list of Corbetts.&lt;ref name="smc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smc.org.uk/hills/hill-lists#Corbetts|title=Corbetts|publisher=[[Scottish Mountaineering Club]]|date=2018|quote=The list of all peaks in Scotland with a height of 2500ft (762m) or more and less than 3000ft (914.4m) with a drop of at least 500ft (152.4m) between each peak and any higher land. The Corbetts are more clearly defined than is the case with the Munros, only the aforementioned rules and sufficiently detailed topographic data are necessary to reproduce the list of hills in the set.  John Rooke Corbett was a district valuer based in Bristol and a keen member of the Scottish Mountaineering Club (SMC) in the years between the two World Wars. [...] When Corbett died, his list was passed to the SMC by his sister. As has been the case with the Munros, the list of Corbetts has changed over the years as a result of changes in hill and bealach heights recognised by the Ordnance Survey. There are currently 222 Corbetts.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{As of| October 2018}}, there were 222 Corbetts in Scotland.&lt;ref name="dbc"/&gt;  21 of these 222 Corbetts have a prominence that exceeds the [[Lists of mountains and hills in the British Isles#P600 (the "Majors")|P600]] threshold of {{convert|600|m|0}}, which would class them as "Majors".&lt;ref name="dbc"/&gt;  The highest Corbett, [[Beinn a' Chlaidheimh]], at {{convert|914|m|0}} is just below the threshold for a Munro, a status it held until it was demoted in 2012 based on new surveys;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13072347.Munro_demoted_as_it_fails_to_hit_heights/|title=Munro demoted as it fails to hit heights|work=The Herald of Scotland|date=8 September 2012|quote=Beinn a' Chlaidheimh was found to be just under the 3000ft required for a Munro.  The society said any re-classification decision would be made by the Scottish Mountaineering Club which issues the tables listing Scotland's Munros.

Climbers who climb all of the Corbetts are called ''Corbetteers'', with the first being John Corbett himself who completed them in 1943.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12480">This is a '''list of Superfund sites in South Carolina''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;   These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  

The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of March 10, 2011, there were 26 Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[South Carolina]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One additional site is currently proposed for entry on the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  Four sites have been cleaned up and removed from the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

==Superfund Alternative sites==
Superfund Alternative sites are locations that have been found to be polluted enough to be listed on the [[National Priorities List]], but are cleaned up through other methods without formal listing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/compliance/cleanup/superfund/saa.html |title=Superfund Alternative Approach |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are not "Superfund" sites since they do not go through the Superfund listing process.  There are 10 SA sites in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/region4/waste/npl/index.htm#SC South Carolina Superfund sites]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8899">The UK countries of [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] are obliged by their individual laws to maintain lists of '''species and habitats of principal importance''' for biodiversity conservation. Public bodies, including local authorities now have a legal [[Biodiversity Duty|duty]] to have regard to conserving biodiversity in the exercise of their normal functions.&lt;ref name="NERC Act P3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 Part 3|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/16/part/3|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=H M Government|accessdate=16 February 2017|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Wales, that obligation originally derived from section 42 of the [[Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006|Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006]].&lt;ref name="Toolkit-Primary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Primary Legislation: England|url=http://www.biodiversityplanningtoolkit.com/stylesheet.asp?file=324_england|website=Biodiversity Planning Toolkit|publisher=The Biodiversity Toolkit Partnership|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM"&gt;{{cite web|title=NERC Act 2006. NERC Act 2006. Section 42: Species of Principal Importance in Wales |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/data/uk-species/checklists/NHMSYS0020516404/index.html |website=www.nhm.ac.uk|publisher=Natural History Museum|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this requirement for Wales has since been superseded by an almost identical requirement enshrined within the [[Environment (Wales) Act 2016]].&lt;ref name="EWA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment (Wales) Act|url=http://www.biodiversitywales.org.uk/Environment-Wales-Bill|website=www.biodiversitywales.org.uk|publisher=Wales Biodiversity Partnership|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Section 6"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodiversity and resilience of ecosystems duty |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2016/3/section/6/enacted|website=www.legislation.gov.uk |publisher=[[The National Archives]]|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EWA Factsheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment (Wales) Act 2016 Factsheet: Biodiversity and Resilience of Ecosystems Duty|url=http://gov.wales/docs/desh/publications/160321-biodiversity-and-resilience-of-ecosystems-duty-en.pdf|website=gov.wales|publisher=[[Welsh Government]]|accessdate=19 February 2017|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection==
The habitats that have been designated to be of "principal importance for the purpose of conserving biodiversity" derive from lists originally drawn up for the [[UK Biodiversity Action Plan|UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP)]]. These lists were reviewed in 2007, and the total number of UK BAP habitats increased from 45 to 65, and the number of UK BAP species increased from under 600 to 1,150.&lt;ref name="UK BAP priority"&gt;{{cite web|title=UK BAP priority species and habitats|url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-5705|website=jncc.defra.gov.uk|publisher=[[Joint Nature Conservation Committee]]|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From these, the formal list just for Wales (and laid out below) now contains 53 of those 65 habitats.&lt;ref name="Priority habitat list"&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment (Wales) Act 2016 Section 7|url=https://www.biodiversitywales.org.uk/File/35/en-GB|publisher=Welsh Government|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal obligations===
Section 6 of the Environment (Wales) Act 2016 places a legal obligation on public bodies in Wales to 'maintain and enhance biodiversity' whilst carrying out their functions.&lt;ref name="Section 6"/&gt; Section 7 of that Act requires [[Welsh Ministers]] to publish and maintain lists of species and types of habitats in Wales that are regarded as of 'principal importance' for the purpose of maintaining and enhancing that biodiversity. This section of the Act replaces the biodiversity duty originally outlined in Section 42 of the NERC Act 2006 for both England and Wales.&lt;ref name="EWA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Section 7"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodiversity lists and duty to take steps to maintain and enhance biodiversity |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2016/3/section/7/enacted|website=www.legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significance===
Awareness of the presence of any priority habitat or priority species identified on these lists is of importance within the [[Local planning authority|local authority planning process]] when land is considered for development. Along with legally protected species, as well as statutory and non-statutory sites, knowledge of the presence of priority habitats and priority species is required if the impact of future development is to be avoided or mitigated.  Planning Policy Wales indicates that, when determining planning applications, the existence of priority habitats are of greater status than others. By fully considering all these features in the decision-making process, a planning authority will have demonstrated that it has discharged its duty to conserve biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Development and wildlife|url=http://www.hertswildlifetrust.org.uk/what-we-do/planning/development-and-wildlife|website=www.hertswildlifetrust.org.uk|publisher=Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 10: Priority habitats and species and development|url=http://www.thomsonecology.com/teh/Priority-Habitats-and-Species-and-Development|website=www.thomsonecology.com|publisher=Thomson Ecology|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sabal minor 2.jpg|thumb|[[Dwarf palmetto]] ''Sabal minor'' with a dusting of snow, [[Congaree National Park]], [[South Carolina]].]]
'''Hardy palms''' are any of the species of [[Arecaceae|palm]] ([[Arecaceae]]) that are able to withstand ''brief'' periods of colder temperatures and even occasional snowfall. A few palms are native to higher elevations of [[south Asia]] where true winter conditions occur, while a few others are native to the warmer parts of the [[temperate zone]] in [[North America]]. A few of these temperate climate palms can tolerate hard freezes with little or no damage. Many of these "hardy " species can be cultivated in warmer parts of temperate climates.

The hardiest species are found in the [[genera]] ''[[Rhapidophyllum]]'', ''[[Sabal]]'', and ''[[Trachycarpus]]''. Members of these and other genera are sometimes grown in areas where they are not truly hardy, overwintering with the aid of various kinds of artificial protection.

The minimum temperature a palm can sustain depends on a variety of factors, such as humidity, size and age of the palm, daytime high temperatures, or the length of time the temperature is at the minimum. A week of high temperatures below {{convert|-6.6|C}} will do far more damage to a palm than an overnight low of {{convert|-13.9|C}} for an hour or so.

==Fan palms==
The fan palms ([[List of Arecaceae genera#Tribe Corypheae|Arecaceae tribe Corypheae]]; palms with fan-shaped [[leaf|leaves]]) include all of the hardiest palms.
*[[Trachycarpus|Windmill Palms]] (''[[Trachycarpus fortunei]]'', ''[[Trachycarpus takil|T. takil]]'') – is considered the most cold hardy palm in the world. These tough species are native to eastern [[China]] and the [[Himalaya]] mountains where severe (though brief) winter conditions occur. Hardy to about {{convert|-10|F|C|order=flip}}, they grow at high altitudes where temperatures are cool. It is also tolerant of low summer temperatures.  Mature ''Trachycarpus'' trees have been successfully grown as far north as 58°N in northern [[Scotland]]. Mature specimens can also be found in the southern coast of [[Ireland]], the southern coast of [[England]], southwestern [[Canada]] (in the city of [[Vancouver]] and on [[Vancouver Island]]), eastern Asia ([[Japan]], southeast [[China]], [[South Korea]]), Southern [[Switzerland]] ([[Ticino]]) and in parts of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}. 

In the [[United States]] ''Trachycarpus'' is cultivated along the Pacific coast and as far north as Seattle, and along the Atlantic coast as far north as  [[Long Island, New York]]/coastal [[Connecticut]]. Across the interior of the United States, there are reports of long term specimens that have survived north to the [[Ohio River]], with several long term plantings in [[Tennessee]] and western North Carolina. It appears that areas west of the [[Mississippi River]] (the southern Plains) may be too hot in summer for successful long term cultivation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Long Island Palm Society|title=Cold Hardy Palms|url=http://www.kokomotrading.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Chamaerops|Mediterranean Fan Palm]] (''Chamaerops humilis'') – The only palm native to southern [[Europe]] besides the [[Phoenix theophrasti|Cretan Date Palm]], and very drought-tolerant. Hardy to {{convert|−12|C|F}}, but does prefer hot summers. Despite the fact that this palm is less hardy than many palms listed here, it has the northernmost native habitat. It is found in abundance across most of southwestern Europe and northwestern [[Africa]]. It is a very slow-growing plant. The blue form of the species, native to high elevations of the Atlas Mountains, has recently been introduced into the trade and early reports indicate that it may be {{convert|5|C-change|0}} or more degrees hardier than the green form.

*[[Rhapidophyllum|Needle Palm]] (''Rhapidophyllum hystrix'') – This clustering and usually trunkless palm is native to the subtropical southeastern United States, from central [[Florida]] to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Mississippi]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Alabama]] in the United States. It is considered hardy to -23.3 C (-10 F), and is cultivated along the East Coast from [[Florida]] to southern [[Massachusetts]], and along the West Coast from [[California]] to [[Seattle]]. They have proven hardy in the [[Tennessee]] valley region and up into the lower [[Ohio]] Valley. The needle palm is very slow-growing and rarely reaches heights of over {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}}. There are documented specimens that have been growing in [[White County, Tennessee]], since the early part of the 1960s, as well as [[United States National Arboretum]] in the Asia Valley section, in the city of [[Washington D.C.]], that are at {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} in height.  

[[File:SawPalmetto.jpg|thumb|right|''Serenoa repens'']]
*[[Nannorrhops|Mazari Palm]] (''Nannorrhops richtiana'') – This palm, native to the dry, mountainous terrains of northern [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]] and surrounding regions, is also thought to be extremely cold hardy (perhaps to about {{convert|−20|C|F|disp=or}}), though also requiring hot summers and dry soils. However, due to its limited availability in cultivation, not much is known about this palm. Mazari Palm is not easy to grow, perfect drainage and full sun are required for this palm to survive. This palm will not tolerate wet freezes.
*[[Serenoa|Saw Palmetto]] (''Serenoa repens'') - These palms are native to the [[southeastern United States]], most commonly along the [[Atlantic]] and Gulf Coastal plains, but also as far inland as southern [[Arkansas]], this bushy palm is hardy to about {{convert|−15|C|F}}.  This bushy palm grows in abundance within [[wetlands]] and subtropical grasslands of central and northern [[Florida]].  Extract from Saw Palmetto is often used to treat problems with the [[prostate]].
*''[[Sabal]]'' palms (palmettos; 13 species) – These palms are native to the southeastern United States, Mexico, [[Central America]], and the [[Caribbean]].  The [[Sabal palmetto|Cabbage Palmetto]] (''Sabal palmetto''), the [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of both [[Florida]] and [[South Carolina]], and is widely cultivated along the south Atlantic coast of the United States. The species is considered hardy to [[USDA Hardiness Zone]] 8, and may survive short periods of temperatures as low as {{convert|−14|C|F}}. The [[Sabal mexicana|Mexican Palmetto]] (''Sabal mexicana'') is a close relative of the Cabbage Palmetto, native to southern Texas and northern Mexico.

*[[Sabal minor|Dwarf Palmetto]] (''S. minor'') is considered hardy to USDA zone 6b, like the needle palm. It can tolerate short periods of temperatures as low as {{convert|−22|C|F}}. Endemic to the swamps and lowlands of the south [[Atlantic]] and [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast of the United States, it can stand long periods of heat and drought. Sabal minor is successfully cultivated across the entire southern United States below 35 latitude, and up the East Coast to 41 latitude and up the West Coast to 45 latitude. 

*[[Trithrinax campestris|Caranday palm]] (''Trithrinax campestris'') is a South American arecaceae palm native of Uruguayan and northeastern Argentine sabanas. It is a very rustic palm that grows in arid, well drained, rocky soils. Its distinctive features are its compact shape, short green to grayish foliage, and trunk fully hidden by dry dead branches (coat) remaining from several previous seasons. It is very resistant to drought, and -9 °C/-15 °C temperatures when not in growing season, although it tends to shed its leaves in these conditions. It is one of the most cold-hardy palms in the world, because it also grows in the mountains of Sierras de Córdoba.

*''[[Washingtonia]]'' palms (''[[Washingtonia filifera]], [[Washingtonia robusta|W. robusta]]'') – These palms are native to southern [[California]] and northwest [[Mexico]], growing as high as {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} in their native habitat. [[California Washingtonia]] (''W. filifera'') is hardy to {{convert|−12|C|F}}; it prefers a dry [[Mediterranean climate]], though it still grows in areas with humid subtropical climates like Brisbane, Sydney, Houston, and New Orleans.  It is sometimes grown in containers, or planted as short-term specimens in areas where it is not quite hardy. [[Mexican Washingtonia]] (''W. robusta'') is somewhat less hardy, native to northern [[Mexico]] (Baja California Peninsula). It has a more robust trunk and stiffer leaves than ''W. filifera'', and is hardy to {{convert|-10|C|F}}.
*''[[Livistona australis]]'' – It is native to southeastern Australia.
*''[[Rhapis excelsa]]'' – It is native to [[China]] and it is hardy to about {{convert|−7|C|F}}.

==Pinnate-leaved palms==
Few palms with pinnate leaves tolerate much frost. They belong to several tribes of the Arecaceae, with the species listed here belonging to [[List of Arecaceae genera#Tribe Areceae|Tribe Areceae]] (''[[Chamaedorea]]''), [[List of Arecaceae genera#Tribe Cocoeae|Tribe Cocoseae]] (''Butia, Jubaea'') and [[List of Arecaceae genera#Tribe Phoeniceae|Tribe Phoeniceae]] (''Phoenix'').
[[File:Jubaea chilensis Hyères gross.jpg|thumb|''Jubaea chilensis'' in France]]
*[[Jubaea|Chilean Wine Palm]] (''Jubaea chilensis'') – A contender for the hardiest pinnate-leaved palm, it is hardy to about {{convert|-12|C|F}} and has been cultivated successfully as far north as Seattle, Washington, Vancouver, British Columbia, and [[London]] [[England]]. This palm does not perform well in hot, humid climates.
*[[Butia|Butia Palm]] or Jelly Palm / Pindo Palm (''[[Butia odorata]]'' (syn. ''B. capitata'' Hort.)&lt;ref name=Soares2015&gt;{{cite journal |last=Soares |first=Kelen Pureza |date=2015 |title=Le genre Butia |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288181003 |language=French |journal=Principes |volume=1 |pages=12–57 |doi= |access-date=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://florida.plantatlas.usf.edu/Plant.aspx?id=4222 |title=Butia capitata - Species Page |last=Wunderlin |first=R.

''B. odorata'' is a palm native to Brazil and Uruguay.&lt;ref name=Soares2015/&gt; This palm grows up to {{convert|6|m|abbr=on}}, exceptionally {{convert|8|m|abbr=on}}, in a slow but steady manner. It is easily identifiable with beautiful pinnate leaves that arch outwards from a thick stout trunk. ''B. odorata'' is notable as one of the hardiest feather palms, tolerating temperatures down to about {{convert|-10|C|F}}; it is widely cultivated in warm temperate regions. It is commonly grown on the East Coast of the United States as far north as [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and [[Seattle]] on the West coast. It thrives in humid subtropical climates. This tree is commonly known as the "jelly palm" because of the sticky, edible, date-like fruit it produces, which is used in many [[South America]]n countries to make jelly.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
*''[[Chamaedorea microspadix]]'' and ''[[Chamaedorea radicalis]]'' – the hardiest known species in the genus ''[[Chamaedorea]]''. Both species come from Mexico and are considered stem hardy to about {{convert|-11|C|F}}, although they will lose their leaves at temperatures below about {{convert|-6|C|F}}.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
*[[Phoenix canariensis|Canary Island Date Palm]] (''Phoenix canariensis'') – This species is hardy to about {{convert|-10|C|F}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://phoenixcanariensispalm.com/wiki |title=Wiki |first= |last= |work=phoenixcanariensispalm.com |year=2011 |quote=It can be cultivated where temperatures never fall below {{convert|-10|to|-12|C|F}} for extended periods, although it will require some protection if cold periods are longer than normal. |accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is grown as far north as the south of England (50°N), producing viable seed (in [[Southsea]], [[Hampshire]]). In North America mature specimens can be found as far north as Gold Beach, Oregon (42.5º N) on the West Coast, and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina (34.1 N) on the East Coast.  This palm is one of the most commonly grown palms in the world.  Well adapted to low humidity and little watering, this palm is used as an ornamental in both Mediterranean climates and desert climates. In more humid climates, these trees will often be seen with [[Nephrolepis|sword fern]]s sprouting just beneath the crown.
*[[Phoenix theophrasti|Cretan Date Palm]] (''Phoenix theophrasti'') – Another species of ''[[Phoenix (plant)|Phoenix]]'' which may show similar frost tolerance, native to Crete and southwest Turkey, but has not been adequately tested.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
*[[Date Palm]] (''Phoenix dactylifera'') – This relative of the Canary Island date palm, and producer of the edible date, is also hardy to about {{convert|-11|C|F}}, but does not tolerate very wet areas.  This palm is one of the staple plants of the [[Middle East]] for its versatility and edible fruit.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
*[[Mule Palm]] (''×&amp;nbsp;Butiagrus nabonnandii'') – Hardy to about {{convert|-10|C|F}}.  Manmade hybrid between the Butia palm and [[Queen palm]].  One of the hardiest feather palms. It combines the hardiness of the Butia palm with the fast-growing, tropical fronds of the Queen palm.  Mature specimens are quite rare due to the difficulty in producing this palm and the characteristics and cold tolerance of the palm is variable with each specimen. Many of them resemble coconut palms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bash|first=Jason|title=Kokomo Trading Company|url=http://www.kokomotrading.com|publisher=Kokomo Trading Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''[[Ceroxylon quindiuense]]'' – It is native to the [[Colombia]]n [[Andes]] where it is found at {{convert|2500|-|2800|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. At this altitude it tolerates occasional frosts for short periods of time.	
*''[[Ceroxylon alpinum]]'' – It is native to the [[Andes]]
*''[[Archontophoenix cunninghamiana]]'' – It is native to [[Australia]].
*''[[Howea forsteriana]]'' – It is native to [[Lord Howe Island]] in Australia.
*''[[Rhopalostylis sapida]]'' – It is native to [[New Zealand]]. It is southernmost palm in the world found as far south as 44°S.
*''[[Caryota]]'' species – They are generally considered tolerant to occasional frosts.

==Plants referred to as palms==
Some plants used in subtropical landscaping in temperate climates like much of Europe, northern China/Japan, Korea, the northern USA, New Zealand, etc. that are commonly referred to as "palms", but are not palms, i.e. not members of the [[Arecaceae]] family, include: [[yucca]]s, ''[[Aloidendron barberae]]'', ''[[Cordyline australis]]'', ''[[Cordyline indivisa]]'', ''[[Cycas revoluta]]'', ''[[Macrozamia communis]]'', ''[[Macrozamia johnsonii]]'', ''[[Macrozamia riedlei]]'', ''[[Cyathea australis]]'', ''[[Cyathea capensis]]'', ''[[Cyathea cooperi]]'', ''[[Cyathea dealbata]]'', ''[[Cyathea medullaris]]'', ''[[Dicksonia antarctica]]'', ''[[Dicksonia squarrosa]]'', ''[[Pseudopanax ferox]]'', and occasionally the sumac ''[[Rhus typhina]]''.

==Hardiness==
In general, hardy palms can only tolerate ''brief'' periods with temperatures in the range {{convert|0|to|10|F|C|abbr=on|disp=flip}}. As such, this generally limits hardy palm cultivation and long term specimens to zone 7a or higher. Some hardy palms can be cultivated in areas with low temperatures slightly below this range when given wind sheltering (planted on the south side of a building). In the USA, hardy palm cultivation is generally attempted from USDA zones 6b/7a southward.{{Citation needed|date = November 2014}}

In very cold winter areas below zone 6b, cold hardy palms have been cultivated by partially (or completely) covering plants with mini-green house coverings and wraps. Some garden enthusiasts in severe cold winter areas have gone as far as heating the interiors of these winter enclosures. As such, there are occasional reports of hardy palms be cultivated in areas with severe winters with low temperatures below {{convert|0|F|C|disp=flip}}.{{Citation needed|date = November 2014}}

[[Image:lcurve.jpg|303px|thumb|Typical seasonal loads of electric utilities in Eastern New England Division in 1919. United States Geological Survey, 1921. Image courtesy of the [http://americanhistory.si.edu/ National Museum of American History] from [http://americanhistory.si.edu/powering/ Powering a Generation of Change]&lt;hr /&gt;]]
[[File:Duck_Curve_CA-ISO_2016-10-22.agr.png|thumb|300px|Graphs by hour of California's total electric load, the total load less solar and wind power (known as the [[duck curve]]) and solar power output. Data is for October 22, 2016, a day when the wind power output was low and steady throughout the day.]]
In [[electrical engineering]], a '''load profile''' is a graph of the variation in the [[electrical load]] versus time.  A load profile will vary according to customer type (typical examples include residential, commercial and industrial), temperature and holiday seasons.  Power producers use this information to plan how much electricity they will need to make available at any given time.  [[Teletraffic engineering]] uses a similar load curve.

== Power generation ==

In a power system, a load curve or load profile is a chart illustrating the variation in demand/electrical load over a specific time. Generation companies use this information to plan how much power they will need to generate at any given time. A [[Load Duration Curve|load duration curve]] is similar to a load curve. The information is the same but is presented in a different form. These curves are useful in the selection of [[Electrical generator|generator]] units for supplying electricity.

==Electricity distribution==
In an [[electricity distribution]] [[Grid (electricity)|grid]], the load profile of electricity usage is important to the efficiency and reliability of power transmission. The power [[transformer]] or [[battery-to-grid]] are critical aspects of power distribution and sizing and modelling of batteries or transformers depends on the load profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/44343/story.htm|publisher=Planet Ark|title=E.ON UK Plans Giant Battery to Store Wind Power}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factory specification of transformers for the optimization of [[Transformer#Energy losses|load losses versus no-load losses]] is dependent directly on the characteristics of the load profile that the transformer is expected to be subjected to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Eromon | first =David I. | title = The Dynamics of Transformer Purchasing in a Transformed Electric Market | journal = The International Journal of Modern Engineering | volume = 6| issue = 1  | year=2005 | url = http://www.ijme.us/issues/fall2005/articles/p33.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes such characteristics as average [[Load factor (electrical)|load factor]], [[diversity factor]], [[utilization factor]], and [[demand factor]], which can all be calculated based on a given load profile.  

On the [[Electricity market|power market]] so-called [[Electricity Forward Agreement|EFA blocks]] are used to specify the [[Trader (finance)|traded]] [[forward contract]] (on the delivery of a certain amount of electrical energy at a certain time.

==Retail energy markets==

In retail energy markets, supplier obligations are settled on an hourly or subhourly basis.  For most customers, consumption is measured on a monthly basis, based on meter reading schedules.  Load profiles are used to convert the monthly consumption data into estimates of hourly or subhourly consumption in order to determine the supplier obligation.  For each hour, these estimates are aggregated for all customers of an energy supplier, and the aggregate amount is used in market settlement calculations as the total demand that must be covered by the supplier.

== Calculating and recording load profiles ==
Load profiles can be determined by direct metering but on smaller devices such as distribution network transformers this is not routinely done. Instead  a load profile can be inferred from customer billing or other data.  An example of a practical calculation used by utilities is using a transformer's maximum demand reading and taking into account the known number of each customer type supplied by these transformers. This process is called [[load research]].

Actual demand can be collected at strategic locations to perform more detailed load analysis; this is beneficial to both distribution and end-user customers looking for peak consumption. [[Smart grid]] [[smart meter|meters]], utility meter load profilers, data logging sub-meters and portable data loggers are designed to accomplish this task by recording readings at a set interval.

[[File:Why is the sky blue.jpg|thumb|[[Rayleigh scattering]] in opalescent glass: it appears blue from the side, but orange light shines through.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/14B.html&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Opalescence''' is a type of [[dichroism]] seen in highly [[colloid|dispersed systems]] with little [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]]. The material appears yellowish-red in transmitted light and blue in the scattered light perpendicular to the transmitted light. The phenomenon is named after the appearance of [[opal]]s and is an example of the [[Tyndall effect]].

There are different degrees of opalescent behaviour. One can still see through a slightly opalescent phase. The larger the particles are, the stronger the scattering arising from them and the cloudier the particular phase will look. At a certain concentration the scattering is so strong that all light passing through is scattered, so that it is no longer transparent.

Examples are the [[Diffuse sky radiation|blue sky]] in the daytime and the yellowish-red sky at sunset. Another example can be made by adding a few droplets of milk to a glass of water. The liquid appears bluish. However, if one looks through the glass at a light source, it becomes yellowish-red. Opalescence is an effect exploited in [[lustreware]] pottery.

A '''pendant bar''' is a [[fluvial]] [[geomorphology]] term that is usually applied to large landforms created by large scale flooding events. Pendant bars are thin, sharp-crested [[Deposit (geology)|deposits]], and are typically made up of coarser [[sediment]] from the bed load. This type of bar is found on the downstream side of a weathering-resistant protrusion such as a large outcrop of bedrock, and is separated from the protrusion by a depression.&lt;ref name=Osterkamp&gt;{{cite web|last=Osterkamp|first=W.R.|title=Annotated Definitions of Selected Geomorphic Terms  and Related Terms of Hydrology, Sedimentology, Soil  Science and Ecology|work=Open File Report 2008–1217|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Department of the Interior}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Burr|editor-first=Devon M.|editor2=Paul A.

==Formation==
Pendant bars form as high-velocity floodwater moves around a protrusion. The water scours out a depression behind the protusion and deposits the sediment a short distance downstream in a bar-shaped formation. A similar process forms a sand splay, which is much like a [[shoal]] but is formed on [[floodplain]]s or terraces in lower-intensity flooding episodes.&lt;ref name=Osterkamp/&gt;  Other fluvial features that are formed by bed load sediments are the [[point bar]], longitudinal bar, and expansion bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imnh.isu.edu/digitalatlas/hydr/main/lbffr.htm |title=The Lake Bonneville Flood |work=Digital Atlas of Idaho |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of plants found in the [[Sierra de Manantlán Biosphere Reserve]]'''. The reserve straddles the [[Mexico|Mexican]] states of [[Colima]] and [[Jalisco]]. It is located in the transition between the [[Nearctic]] and [[Neotropical]] realms and encompasses parts of the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]], with a wide range of altitudes, climates and soils. The effects of tectonic and volcanic activities and erosion are notable within the reserve.

==Ecological characteristics==
Forest types in the reserve including [[mesophytic]], [[Cloud forest|cloud]], [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|dry deciduous]] and [[semi-deciduous]] tropical forests. Anthropologists know the region as ''Zona de Occidente'', an area notably different to the rest of [[Mesoamerica]]. Some ceramic remnants, figurines and graves have been found, but there is little other material evidence of ancient human settlement. As of 1995 almost 8,000 people lived in the Sierra de Manantlán Reserve, engaged mainly in agriculture (corn, beans, tomatoes, sugar cane, watermelon, mangoes), livestock grazing, timber production, and extraction of wood for fuel and mining of coal or minerals. Another 30,000 lived in the surrounding communities and almost 700,000 in the surrounding region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/ecological-sciences/biosphere-reserves/latin-america-and-the-caribbean/mexico/sierra-de-manantian/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sierra de Manantlán Biosphere Reserve is located to the extreme north of the inter-tropical zone. The climate in the region is influenced by its proximity to the coast, the effect of its landform ([[Rain shadow|orographic shade]]) and the breadth of its altitudinal range. These characteristics explain the high [[biodiversity]] and the presence of numerous plant formations ranging from tropical forests to temperate-cold climates.

The Sierra de Manantlán's varied and complex plant cover harbours a great wealth of flora. There are over 2900 species of vascular plants belonging to 981 genera. Wildlife is one of the important components of the high biodiversity in this reserve. Among the main values of the Sierra de Manantlán, in addition to its great wealth of species and its unique biogeographical characteristics, particular mention should be made of the presence of endangered or useful endemic species. So far 110 mammal species have been reported, including the [[Mexican vole]] subspecies ''Microtus mexicanus neveriae'', the pocket gopher ''[[Cratogeomys gymnurus]] russelli'', the [[oncilla]], [[jaguarandi]], [[ocelot]], [[puma (genus)|puma]], [[bobcat]], [[jaguar]] and four species of [[Nectarivore|nectarivorous]] bats.

There are 336 bird species which have been reported, among them are 36 which are endemic to Mexico, such as the charismatic species: [[crested guan]] (''Penelope purpurascens''), [[military macaw]] (''Ara militaris''), [[red-lored amazon]] (''Amazona autumnalis'') and the Mexican national symbol, the [[golden eagle]]. In terms of [[herpetofauna]], 85 species have been recorded; of these 13 are endemic to the western and central region of Mexico: [[rattlesnake]], [[black iguana]], frog ''[[Shyrrhopus modestus]]'', [[beaded lizard]] (''Heloderma horridum'') and the [[Autlan rattlesnake]] (''Crotalus lannomi''), an endemic species only reported for the area of Puerto de Los Mazos. Of the 16 species of fish identified, 13 are native and four are endemic to the region.

Most plants in the list below can be found in ''Flora de Manantlán'',&lt;ref name=Vazquez1995/&gt; and that should be assumed as a reference when no other is indicated. References to other sources are included where found. The herbarium web pages at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]&lt;ref name=unam&gt;http://unibio.unam.mx/&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]]&lt;ref name=tropicos&gt;http://www.tropicos.org/&lt;/ref&gt; are used as authorities for names with adjustments for the system in use by Wikipedia. Species include ecosystem, growth habit, and common names where available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1135">'''Polflucht''' (from German, ''flight from the poles'') is a geophysical concept invoked in 1915 by [[Alfred Wegener]] to explain his ideas of [[continental drift]]. He suggested that a differential gravitational force (horizontal component of centrifugal or [[Eötvös effect|Eötvös force]]) and the Earth's [[flattening]] would cause continental masses to drift slowly towards the [[equator]].

The hypothesis was expanded by [[Paul Sophus Epstein]] in 1920 but the force is now known to be far too weak to cause [[plate tectonics]]. The strength of the layers of the [[Earth's crust]] is much stronger than assumed by Wegener and Epstein.

'''SNAP-1''' is a British nanosatellite orbiting in [[Low Earth Orbit]].&lt;ref name="RoyalSocietyUnderwood"&gt;C Underwood, G Richardson, J Savignol, [http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/361/1802/199.abstract "In-orbit results from the SNAP-1 nanosatellite and its future potential"], Philosophical Transactions of The Royal Society, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WileyFortescueEngineering"&gt;P Fortescue, J Stark, G Swinerd, "Spacecraft Systems Engineering", Third Edition, Wiley - Section 18.7, pages 597-599&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite was built at the Surrey Space Centre by [[Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd]] (SSTL) and members of the [[Surrey University|University of Surrey]]. It was launched on 28 June 2000 on board a [[Kosmos-3M]] rocket from the [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] in northern [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/2000/2000-1%20-%200022.html "SSTL satellites launched on board Cosmos 3M booster"], Flight International 4–10 July 2000, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;  It shared the launch with a Russian [[Nadezhda (satellite)|Nadezhda]] search and relay spacecraft and the Chinese Tsinghua-1 microsatellite.

==Mission==
The objectives of the SNAP-1 mission were to:&lt;ref name="RoyalSocietyUnderwood" /&gt;

* Develop and prove a modular [[Commercial off-the-shelf|Commercial Off-The-Shelf]] (COTS) based nanosatellite bus.
* Evaluate new manufacturing techniques and technologies.
* Image the Tsinghua-1 microsatellite during its deployment (timed to occur a few seconds after the deployment of SNAP-1).
* Demonstrate the systems required for future nanosatellite constellations.  For example: three-axis attitude control, [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) based orbit determination, and orbital manoeuvres.  
* Depending on propellant availability, rendezvous with Tsinghua-1 and demonstrate formation flying.

During deployment, SNAP-1 successfully imaged the Nadezhda and Tsinghua-1 satellites that accompanied it on the launch.&lt;ref name="SurreyLancasterMvs"&gt;R Lancaster, [http://rjplancaster.net/documents/20010822-UniversityOfSurrey-Thesis-RLancaster-Snap1OpticalRemoteInspectionSystem.pdf "An optical remote inspection system for the Surrey Nanosatellite Applications Program"], University of Surrey MSc thesis, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UsuLancasterMvs"&gt;R Lancaster, C Underwood, [http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2000/All2000/20/ "The SNAP-1 Machine Vision System"], 14th AIAA / USU Conference on Small Satellites, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/2000/2000-1%20-%201423.html "SpaceFlight News"], Flight International 17–23 October 2000, page 33&lt;/ref&gt;  Once in orbit, SNAP-1 achieved three axis attitude control,&lt;ref name="UsuSteynAttitude"&gt;W H Steyn, Y Hashida, [http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2001/All2001/28/ "In-Orbit Attitude Performance of the 3-Axis Stabilised SNAP-1 Nanosatellite"], 15th AIAA / USU Conference on Small Satellites, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; then demonstrated its orbital maintenance capability using its butane cold gas propulsion system.&lt;ref name="UsuGibbonPropulsion"&gt;D Gibbon, C Underwood, [http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2001/All2001/76/ "Low Cost Butane Propulsion Systems for Small Spacecraft"], 15th AIAA / USU Conference on Small Satellites, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Katsushika Hokusai - Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji- The Great Wave Off the Coast of Kanagawa - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|alt="Great wave" by Hokusai|''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa|Great wave off the coast of Kanagawa]]'' ([[Katsushika Hokusai]], c. 1830)&lt;ref name=Stow8/&gt;]]

The role of the '''sea in culture''' has been important for centuries, as people experience the [[sea]] in contradictory ways: as powerful but serene, beautiful but dangerous.&lt;ref name=Stow10&gt;[[#Stow|Stow]], p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Human responses to the sea can be found in artforms including [[literature]], [[art]], [[poetry]], [[film]], [[theatre]], and [[classical music]]. The earliest art representing boats is 40,000 years old. Since then, artists in different countries and cultures have depicted the sea. Symbolically, the sea has been perceived as a hostile environment populated by fantastic creatures: the [[Leviathan]] of the [[Bible]], [[Isonade]] in [[Japanese mythology]], and the [[kraken]] of late [[Norse mythology]]. In the works of the psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]], the sea symbolises the personal and the [[collective unconscious]] in [[dream interpretation]].

The sea and ships have been depicted in art ranging from simple drawings on the walls of huts in [[Lamu Archipelago|Lamu]] to seascapes by [[J. M. W. Turner|Joseph Turner]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]]. The Japanese artist [[Katsushika Hokusai]] created colour [[Printmaking|prints]] of the moods of the sea, including ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]''. The sea has appeared in literature since [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' (8th century BC). The sea is a recurring theme in the [[Haiku]] poems of the Japanese [[Edo period]] poet [[Matsuo Bashō|Matsuo Bashō (松尾 芭蕉)]] (1644–1694).

The sea plays a major role in [[Homer]]'s [[epic poetry|epic poem]] the ''Odyssey'', describing the ten-year voyage of the Greek hero [[Odysseus]] who struggles to return home across the sea, encountering sea monsters along the way. In the Middle Ages, the sea appears in romances such as the [[Tristan]] legend, with motifs such as mythical islands and self-propelled ships. Pilgrimage is a common theme in stories and poems such as ''[[The Book of Margery Kempe]]''.

Contemporary sea-inspired novels have been written by [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Herman Wouk]], and [[Herman Melville]]; poems about the sea have been written by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Rudyard Kipling]] and [[John Masefield]]. The sea has inspired much music over the centuries including [[Sea shanty|sea shanties]], [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'', [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'' (1903–05), [[Charles Villiers Stanford]]'s ''[[Songs of the Sea (Stanford)|Songs of the Sea]]'' (1904) and ''[[Songs of the Fleet]]'' (1910), [[Edward Elgar]]'s ''[[Sea Pictures]]'' (1899) and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]' ''[[A Sea Symphony]]'' (1903–1909). [[Burial at sea]] has been practised in various ways by countries around the world since the [[Ancient Egypt|ancient civilisations of Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].

==Humans and the sea==

Human reactions to the [[sea]] are found in, for example, [[literature]], [[art]], [[poetry]], [[film]], [[theatre]], and [[classical music]], as well as in [[mythology]] and the [[dream interpretation|psychotherapeutic interpretation of dreams]]. The importance of the sea to maritime nations is shown by the intrusions it makes into their culture; its inclusion in myth and legend; its mention in [[proverb]]s and [[folk song]]; the use of ships in [[votive offering]]s; the importance of ships and the sea in [[initiation ceremonies]] and in mortuary rites; children playing with toy boats; adults making [[model ship]]s; crowds gathering at the launch of a new ship; people congregating at the arrival or departure of a vessel and the general attitude towards maritime matters.&lt;ref name=Westerdahl&gt;{{cite journal |author=Westerdahl, Christer |year=1994 |title=Maritime cultures and ship types: brief comments on the significance of maritime archaeology |journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=265–270 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-9270.1994.tb00471.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade and exchange of ideas with neighbouring nations is one of the means by which civilizations advance and evolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Collapse |last=Diamond |first=Jared |year=2005 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-027951-1 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happened widely among the ancient peoples living in lands bordering the [[Mediterranean Sea]], as well as in India, China and other Southeast Asian nations.&lt;ref name=Cotterell208&gt;[[#Cotterell|Cotterell]], pp. 206–208&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Oceans Day]] takes place every 8 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Oceans Day: Why June 8 is an important day for our planet|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/06/08/world-oceans-day-june-8/85592548/|work=USA Today|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==

British Museum.|An [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] relief from  the reign of [[Sennacherib]], [[Nineveh]], {{nowrap|{{circa|lk=no|700}} BC}} showing fish and a crab swimming around a [[bireme]].]]

[[Petroglyph]]s depicting boats made of [[papyrus]] are among rock art dating back 40,000 years on the shores of the Caspian Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1076 |title=Gobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape |work=World Heritage Centres |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[James Hornell]] studied traditional, indigenous watercraft and considered the significance of the "oculi" or eyes painted on the prows of boats which may have represented the watchful gaze of a god or goddess protecting the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prins, A. H. J. |year=1970 |title=Maritime art in an Islamic context: oculos and therion in Lamu ships |journal=The Mariner's Mirror |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=327–339 |doi=10.1080/00253359.1970.10658550 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vikings portrayed fierce heads with open jaws and bulging eyes at bow and stern of their [[longship]]s to ward off evil spirits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/ships_figurehead.aspx |title=Ship's figurehead |work=Explore |publisher=British Museum |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the figureheads on the prows of sailing ships were regarded with affection by mariners and represented the belief that the vessel needed to find its way. The Egyptians placed figures of holy birds on the prow while the Phoenicians used horses representing speed. The Ancient Greeks used boars' heads to symbolise acute vision and ferocity while Roman boats often mounted a carving of a centurion representing valour in battle. In northern Europe, serpents, bulls, dolphins and dragons were customary used to decorate ships' prows and by the thirteenth century, the swan was commonly used to signify grace and mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_Figureheads.htm |title=Ship's figureheads |work=Research |publisher=Royal Naval Museum Library |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sea thiasos Nereis Glyptothek Munich 239 front n1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nereid]] riding a sea-bull (2nd century BC)]]
The [[Greek mythology]] of the sea includes a complex pantheon of gods and other supernatural creatures. The god of the sea, [[Poseidon]], is accompanied by his wife, [[Amphitrite]], who is one of the fifty [[Nereid]]s, sea nymphs whose parents were [[Nereus]] and [[Doris (mythology)|Doris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nereides|url=http://www.theoi.com/Pontios/Nereides.html|publisher=Theoi|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]s, sons of Poseidon, who were variously represented with the tails of fish or seahorses, formed Poseidon's retinue along with the Nereids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tritones |url=http://www.theoi.com/Pontios/Tritones.html |publisher=Theoi |accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mythic sea was further peopled by dangerous sea monsters such as [[Scylla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Gods of the Greeks | publisher=Thames and Hudson | author=Kerenyi, C. | year=1974 | pages=37–40 | isbn=0-500-27048-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poseidon himself had something of the shifting character of the sea, presiding not only over the sea, but also earthquakes, storms and horses. [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] occupied a similar position in Roman mythology.&lt;ref name=Cotterell54&gt;[[#Cotterell|Cotterell]], p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Another Greek sea-god, [[Proteus]], specifically embodies the domain of sea change, the adjectival form "protean" meaning mutable, able to assume many forms.

The rich blackish red and oily texture of the water were almost identical to Mavrodaphni.

His wandering voyage takes him from one strange and dangerous land to another, experiencing among other maritime hazards shipwreck, the sea-monster [[Scylla]], the whirlpool [[Charybdis]] and the island [[Ogygia]] of the delightful nymph [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://homepage.usask.ca/~jrp638/CourseNotes/OdSummary.html | title=Plot Outline for Homer's Odyssey | publisher=University of Saskatchewan | date=8 May 2006 | accessdate=10 September 2013 | author=Porter, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ptolemy]], writing in his ''[[Geographia]]'' in about 150 AD, described how the Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean were great enclosed seas and believed that a vessel venturing into the Atlantic would soon reach the countries of the East. His map of the then known world was remarkably accurate but from the fourth century onwards, civilisation suffered a setback at the hands of [[Migration Period|barbarian invaders]] and knowledge of geography took a backward step. In the seventh century, [[Isidore of Seville]] produced a "wheel map" in which Asia, Africa and Europe were arranged like segments in an orange, separated by the "Mare Mediterranean", "Nilus" and "Tanais" and surrounded by "Oceanus". It was not until the fifteenth century that Ptolemy's maps were used again and [[Henry the Navigator]] of Portugal initiated ocean exploration and maritime research. Encouraged by him, Portuguese navigators explored, mapped and charted the west coast of Africa and the Eastern Atlantic and this knowledge prepared the way for the great voyages of exploration that were to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Seas: Our Knowledge of Life in the Sea and How it is Gained |last=Russell |first=S.

[[File:Saint brendan german manuscript.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint [[Brendan]] and the whale. German manuscript, c 1460]]

Medieval literature offers rich encounters with the sea, as in the well-known romance of Tristan and ''The Voyage of Saint [[Brendan]]''. The sea acts as an arbiter of good and evil and the barrier of fate, as in the mercantilist fifteenth-century poem ''[[The Libelle of Englyshe Polycye]]''. Medieval romances frequently ascribe a prominent role to the sea. The originally Mediterranean family of [[Apollonius of Tyre]] romances use the [[Odyssey|Odyssean]] format of the extended sea voyage. The story may have influenced ''Guillaume Roi d'Angleterre'' and [[Chaucer]]’s [[The Man of Law's Tale]]. Other romances, such as the ''[[Romance of Horn]]'', the ''Conte del Graal'' of [[Chrétien de Troyes]], ''Partonopeu de Blois'' or the [[Tristan]] legend employ the sea as a structural feature and source of motifs: setting adrift, mythical islands, and self-propelled ships. Some of these maritime motifs appear in the [[lais of Marie de France|lais]] of [[Marie de France]].&lt;ref name=Sob2005&gt;Sobecki, Sebastian (2005). "The Sea," in ''International Encyclopaedia for the Middle Ages''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sob2008&gt;Sobecki, Sebastian (2008).

The ascetic sea desert (''heremum in oceano'') appears in  Adomnán’s ''Life of Columba'' or ''The Voyage of Saint [[Brendan]]'', an entirely seaborne tale cognate with the Irish ''immram'' or maritime pilgrimage tale.{{efn|Three of these have survived: ''The Voyage of Mael Duin'', ''The Voyage of Snedgus and MacRiagla'', and ''The Voyage of the Húi Corra'' (''Immram curaig Máele Dúin'', ''Immram Snédgus ocus Maic Riagla'', and ''Immram curaig Ua Corra'').}} The Old English poem ''[[The Seafarer (poem)|The Seafarer]]'' has a similar background. Sermons sometimes speak of the sea of the world and the ship of the Church, and moralistic interpretations of shipwreck and floods. These motifs in chronicles such as the ''Chronica majora'' of [[Matthew Paris]], and [[Adam of Bremen]]’s ''History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen''. Similar motives are treated in Biblical paraphrases, e.g. the anonymous Middle English poem ''[[Patience (poem)|Patience]]'', and pilgrimage narratives and poems such as ''The Book of [[Margery Kempe]]'', [[Saewulf]]'s ''Voyage'', ''The Pilgrims' Sea Voyage''. Marian devotion created prayers to Mary as the Star of the Sea (''stella maris''), both as lyrics and as features in larger works like [[John Gower]]'s ''[[Vox Clamantis]]''.&lt;ref name=Sob2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sob2008/&gt;

Other [[early modern]] authors to have made use of the cultural associations of the sea include [[John Milton]] in his poem ''[[Lycidas]]'' (1637), [[Andrew Marvell]] in his ''Bermudas'' (1650) and [[Edmund Waller]] in his ''The Battle of the Summer Islands'' (1645).

A sailor's work was hard in the days of sail.

==Burial at sea==

{{main|Burial at sea}}

The burial of entire or cremated bodies at sea has been practised by countries around the world since ancient times, with instances recorded from the ancient civilisations in Egypt, Greece, and Rome.&lt;ref name=WaterBurials&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/history-of-death/water-burials.html | title=History of Death / Water Burials | publisher=AETN UK (History channel) | accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practices vary by country and by religion; for example, the United States allows human remains to be buried at sea at least 3 nautical miles from land, and if the remains are uncremated the water must be at least 600 feet deep,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.epa.gov/region2/water/oceans/burials.htm | title=Burials at Sea | publisher=U.

{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2014}}
'''Shale gas in the United Kingdom''' has attracted increasing attention since 2007, when onshore [[shale gas]] production was proposed. The first [[shale gas]] well in England was drilled in 1875.&lt;ref name="Royal Society &amp; Royal Aacademy of Engineering 2012"&gt;{{harvnb|Royal Society &amp; Royal Aacademy of Engineering|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of wells have been drilled, and favourable tax treatment has been offered to shale gas producers.&lt;ref name="Macalister 2013"&gt;{{harvnb|Macalister|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 UK Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] had claimed that, "fracking has real potential to drive energy bills down".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Macalister|2013}} "Shale gas is a resource with huge potential to broaden the UK's energy mix," said the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne. "We want to create the right conditions for industry to explore and unlock that potential in a way that allows communities to share in the benefits. "This new tax regime, which I want to make the most generous for shale in the world, will contribute to that. I want Britain to be a leader of the shale gas revolution – because it has the potential to create thousands of jobs and keep energy bills low for millions of people."&lt;/ref&gt; However, in November 2013 representatives from industry and government, such as former BP Chief Executive and government advisor [[John Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley|Lord Browne]], Energy Secretary [[Ed Davey]] and economist [[Lord Stern]] said that fracking in the UK alone will not lower prices as the UK is part of a well connected European market.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrington|29 November 2013}} In July, Osborne said: "This a real chance to get cheaper energy for Britain … a major new energy source that can reduce energy bills."In August, Cameron said: "If we don't back this technology, we will miss a massive opportunity to help families with their bills … fracking has real potential to drive energy bills down." In November, "the chairman of the UK's leading shale gas company", Lord Browne, said "Fracking is not going to reduce gas prices in the UK". "The statement by Lord Browne, one of the most powerful energy figures in Britain, contradicts claims by David Cameron and George Osborne that shale gas exploration could help curb soaring energy bills."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The Telegraph| 9 September 2013}} "North Sea gas didn’t significantly move UK prices – so we can’t expect UK shale production alone to have any effect," Mr Davey said, pointing out that Britain is just one part of the wider European gas market. He said it was "far from clear that UK shale gas production could ever replicate the price effects seen in the US", where the shale gas boom has seen prices plummet.
The comments stand in stark contrast to those of David Cameron, who wrote in the Telegraph last month that "fracking has real potential to drive energy bills down"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The Independent| 3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{As of |December 2014}}, there has been no commercial production of shale gas in the UK. {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Areas==
The [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]] (DECC) originally identified large areas of eastern and southern England as having the "best shale gas potential":{{quote|The [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17726538 main area] identified runs from just south of Middlesbrough in a crescent through East Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire and the Cotswolds to Somerset and Wiltshire. It then turns along the South Coast and Downs, including most of Dorset, Hampshire, Sussex, Surrey and Kent. Shale gas sites are under investigation in the Sussex commuter belt, near Haywards Heath, the Mendip Hills, south of Bath, in Kent, Lincolnshire, south Wales, Staffordshire and Cheshire, as well as more sites near the existing find in Lancashire.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvnb|Gilligan|26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} However the British Geological Survey report released in October 2014 said that there was little potential for shale gas in the Weald Basin as the field has not yet reached thermal maturation, however may exhibit oil-shale potential. (see 'Weald Basin' below)

===Bowland Basin===
As of June 2013, the Bowland Basin was the only area in the UK where wells have been drilled specifically for shale gas. Four wells have been drilled by [[Cuadrilla Resources]], and one by IGAS Energy. None of the wells have produced gas.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Cuadrilla started drilling Britain's first shale gas exploration well, the Preese-Hall-1, in August 2010. The well penetrated 800m of organic-rich shale. The company hydraulically fractured the well in early 2011, but suspended the operation when it triggered two seismic events of magnitudes (M&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) 2.3 and 1.5, the larger of which was felt&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The Sun|2011}}A spokesman for Blackpool Police said: "We started to get calls at around 3.35am. Some may have thought it was an April Fool prank, but staff here felt the building move."&lt;/ref&gt; by at least 23 people at the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|British Geological Survey|2011}}"Twenty-three reports of the shaking caused by the earthquake were used to determine earthquake intensity. We find a maximum intensity of 4 EMS close to the epicentre. This is consistent with a magnitude 2.3 earthquake at a depth of 3.5 km, however, the limited nature of the data means that this is also poorly constrained."&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the well stopped in May 2011, and the government declared a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing that was sustained until December 2012, subject to additional controls to limit seismic risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrabin|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal Society &amp; Royal Aacademy of Engineering 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) &amp; The Rt Hon Edward Davey|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Cuadrilla announced a huge discovery of 200 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas in place under the [[Fylde Coast]] in Lancashire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Macalister|21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BBCLancashire|1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuadrilla stated that it would be happy if it could recover 10–20% of the gas in place.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvnb|Gilligan|26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley|Lord Browne]] ignored this latter point in media interviews, claiming that the Lancashire discovery could satisfy the UK's gas consumption "for 56 years",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|25 September 2011}} Browne gets his headline-grabbing figure of 56 years by simply dividing the size of the entire Lancashire find, about 5.6 Tcm, by annual UK gas consumption, currently [http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/postpn230.pdf around 0.1 Tcm]. Such a calculation takes no account of the fact that only a minority of the Lancashire discovery is recoverable.&lt;/ref&gt; with similar, sensational media reports claiming that the find was "so rich it could meet Britain's needs for decades",&lt;ref name="harvnb|Leake|12 February 2012"&gt;{{harvnb|Leake|12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that it had "the potential to do more for Lancashire than the cotton industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clover|25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (For comparison, the cotton industry in Lancashire employed, at peak penetration in 1811, 37% of the county, or about 70,000 people; Cuadrilla believes fracking will create 1,700 jobs in Lancashire, current population 1.1m).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walton|1987|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vision of Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BBC|21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Geological Survey—responsible for producing inventories of the UK's mineral resources, and far more cautious in its estimates—felt prompted, however, to re-evaluate its projections in light of the find,&lt;ref name="harvnb|Leake|12 February 2012"/&gt; which Cuadrilla believes could provide 5,600 jobs in the UK at the peak of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry estimates suggest shale gas in Lancashire alone could deliver £6bn of gas a year for the next three decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKie|25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Cuadrilla applied for a permit to hydraulically fracture its previously drilled well at the Grange Hill site.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reed|5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, Cuadrilla published news of their continuing consultation with residents shale gas exploration sites in the Fylde.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cuadrilla Resources Ltd|23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 and 2012, [[IGas Energy]] drilled a deep well to evaluate shale gas, and found gas shows in the [[Bowland Shale Formation|Bowland Shale]], with total organic content averaging 2.7%. The formation was reported to be thermally mature, in the wet gas window. IGAS bought large blocks of gas licences in 2011, much of which is reportedly prospective for shale gas.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{harvnb|US Energy Information Administration|June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IGas announced that it would drill a well to evaluate shale gas at Barton, near Manchester. Drilling would begin in October 2013, and take two to three months. IGas has not applied for a permit to hydraulically fracture the well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gosden|9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weald Basin===

A BGS/DECC report from May 2014 indicates that there is little potential for shale gas fracturing in the [[Weald Basin]], south of London. It does suggest that there is the possibility for the extraction of [[Tight oil|light tight oil from shales]] (LTO)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrews|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{why|I thought this was tight oil from Kimmeridge micrites(Jurassic limestone bands), not shale oil. Please explain what this discovery has to with shale gas in the Weald basin|date=August 2016}} Subsequent exploration showed a potentially major oil field near Gatwick Airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodway|22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern Ireland===
According to February 2013 reports from [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], there could be £80 billion in reserves in Northern Ireland, although these claims were criticised as being sensationalist.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Fowler|14 February 2013"&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Parks===
The [[Durham Energy Institute]] has examined the likelihood of drilling in [[National Parks of England and Wales|National Parks]]. The parks with geologies of interest are the [[North York Moors]], the [[Peak District]], the [[South Downs]] and to the south of the [[Yorkshire Dales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herringshaw|March 2015}} "This research has found that, of the 15 national parks in Britain, there are: 4 (North Yorks Moors, Peak District, South Downs, and Yorkshire Dales) with rocks of possible interest to companies looking to frack for shale gas, shale oil, or coalbed methane"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resource estimates==
According to a 2011 report of the [[Energy and Climate Change Select Committee]], "Shale gas resources in the UK could be considerable—particularly offshore—but are unlikely to be a "game changer" to the same extent as they have been in the US, where the shale gas revolution has led to a reduction in natural gas prices."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|House of Commons:Energy and Climate Change Committee|23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee's chairperson, [[Tim Yeo]], revised his personal opinion in 2012, however, and argued shale gas is a "game changer" that could "transform the UK's energy independence".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whipple|17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Webb|3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in fracking came just as imports of gas to the UK had surpassed domestic production in 2011 for the first time since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gosden|29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimating the size of recoverable resource is difficult due to the uncertainty of the usually small percentage of shale gas that is recoverable. In addition, companies may embrace large estimations of reserves to boost share prices. In the United States, companies had been subpoenaed in 2011 on suspicion that the projections they provided to investors, including press-release figures, were inflated. In 2012, national agencies in the U.S and Poland revised dramatically downward their estimates of shale gas resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Urbina|28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strzelecki|2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the problem in evaluation is also the uncertainty of [[decline curve analysis]] from early data: shale gas wells can fall off sharply during the first year or two, then level off to a slower decline rate; the shape of the curve, and therefore the ultimate recovery, is difficult to predict from early production rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frean|20 October 2011}} A typical well in North Dakota's seemingly prolific Bakken shale oil and gasfield, for example, may produce more than 1,000 barrels of oil per day in year [one], but only 200 in year two, according to Lynn Helms, director of the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources. Existing fracking methods are capable of extracting only 5 per cent of the oil content of the shale. This can be raised to 15 per cent by multiple extractions from each wellhead. Even then, 85 per cent of the oil remains below ground.{{dead link|date = September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before drilling, [[IGas]] estimated gas in place of 4.6 Tcf in the [[Ince]] Marshes site, though it was unlikely that more than 20% of it could be recoverable;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heren|26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After drilling their first well, IGas announced that the estimated gas in place was at least double their previous estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IGas|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2012, Celtique Energie estimated that there might be as much as 14 Tcf of recoverable reserves in countryside south of [[Horsham]], [[West Sussex]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvnb|Gilligan|26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary estimates in 2011 suggested that there may be £70bn worth of shale gas in [[South Wales]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rigby|1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1.5bn bbl [[oil equivalent]] in Northern Ireland according to a report by PwC.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Fowler|14 February 2013"/&gt;

===British Geological Survey===
In June 2013, the British Geological Survey estimated the gas in place within the Bowland Shale of central Britain to be within the range of 822 TCF to 2281 TCF, with a central estimate of {{convert|1329|e12cuft|km3}}, but did not estimate how much of the gas was likely to be recoverable,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{harvnb|BBC News Business|27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Webb, Sylvester, Thomson|9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cautioned:

:"Estimates of the amount of recoverable gas and the gas resources are variable. It is possible that the shale gas resources in UK are very large. However, despite the size of the resource, the proportion that can be recovered is the critical factor."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|British Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry estimates were that about 10% of gas in place could be extracted.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; 130 TCF would supply Britain's gas needs for about 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chazan|10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Urquhart|11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comment from the British Geological Survey suggested even more substantial shale gas reserves offshore.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reuters|17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US Energy Information Administration===
In June 2013, the US [[Energy Information Administration]] issued a worldwide estimate of shale gas, which included an incomplete estimate of recoverable shale gas resources in the UK. The Carboniferous shale basins of North of England and Scotland, which include the Bowland Basin, were estimated to have 25 trillion cubic feet of recoverable shale gas. The Jurassic shales of the Wessex Basin and [[Weald Basin]] of southern England were estimated to have 600 billion cubic feet of recoverable shale gas and 700 million barrels of associated oil. The agency noted that the UK shale basins are more complex than those in the US, and therefore more costly to drill. On the other hand, as of June 2013, the price of natural gas in the United Kingdom was reported to be more than double the price in the US and Canada by one source&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and three times higher by other sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BP web page, Retrieved 11 January 2014}}{{dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reuters|25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
&lt;!---Alter the refs to harvnb---&gt;
In 2012, a joint report by the Royal Society and Royal Association of Engineers (RS/RAE), commissioned by the government to identify the problems and advise regulatory agencies, emphasised that regulation "must be fit for purpose" with a focus on maintaining "regulatory co-ordination and capacity" and "the way in which risks scale up should a future shale gas industry develop nationwide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report: Shale Gas Extraction|url=https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/shale-gas-extraction/report/|publisher=Royal Society and Royal Association of Engineers|date=29 June 2012|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government responded with a paper that outlined the requirements of the regulatory framework.&lt;ref name="RAE recommendations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Government response to Royal Academy of Engineering and Royal Society report on "Shale Gas Extraction in the UK: a review of hydraulic fracturing"|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/49541/7269-government-response-sg-report-.pdf|website=Gov.UK|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, an impact assessment by the European Commission concluded that existing legal and regulatory environments for shale gas exploration and development were insufficient, and recommended a new directive with specific requirements for high volume hydraulic fracturing to address: "environmental risks and impacts"; allay "public concerns", and; "enable investments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author=European Commission|title=COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF THE IMPACT ASSESSMENT|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52014SC0022|accessdate=29 July 2015|date=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, the Environment Agency followed up their 2013 draft consultation&lt;ref name=EADraft2013&gt;{{cite web|author1=Environment Agency|title=Onshore oil and gas exploratory operations: technical guidance Consultation Draft, August 2013|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/297024/LIT_7983_3b53c2.pdf|publisher=Environment Agency|accessdate=13 September 2016|format=PDF|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with their final version on guidance for "flow testing and well stimulation, including hydraulic fracturing" for onshore operators in England.&lt;ref name="OOGSG Aug16"&gt;{{cite web|title=Onshore Oil &amp; Gas Sector Guidance Version 1, 17 August 2016|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/545924/LIT_10495.pdf|publisher=Environment Agency|date=17 August 2016|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
In 2012, the joint Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering report was critical of current regulation which failed to ensure independence of the well examiner scheme by ensuring that the well examiner was independent of the operating company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| title=3.2 Improving the well examination scheme|page=26|quote="The guidelines should be clarified to ensure the well examiner is an employee of a separate company. The independence of the scheme must not be compromised."|url=http://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/shale-gas-extraction/report|date=April 2012|accessdate=8 September 2016}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The government responded: "there are a few well operators who wish to use in-house examiners, and that option is legally open to them if they can fulfil the DCR (Design and Construction Regulations) requirements of an appropriate level of impartiality and independence from any aspects of the well design/construction/operation."(paraphrase this instead of using quote)&lt;ref name="RAE recommendations"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

==Climate change==
Shale gas is largely [[methane]], a hydrocarbon fuel. As such the carbon dioxide it produces contributes to [[global warming]], although less so than coal. Of more concern is leaking or fugitive emissions of unburned methane, which is a [[greenhouse gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|DECC|February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that, in opening a new source of hydrocarbons, it may reduce the incentive and financing of renewable sources of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aitkenhead|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 Climate Change Act committed the UK to reducing CO2 emissions by 50% in 2030, and by 80% by 2050. In 2013, the UK generated 36% of its electricity from coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|DEFRA|DECC|EA|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to {{by whom|reason=Who said this|date=June 2017}} , replacing coal with shale gas would be one possible solution that provides reliable on demand electricity{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} as it has a greenhouse gas equivalent value of about half that of coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacKay|Stone|2013}} The UK is much smaller than the USA, and European energy markets are different, so we extrapolate from the American studies with caution. That said, if shale gas were extracted in the UK, and if the price of shale gas were low enough, one would expect, as in America, (a) an increase in demand for gas; (b) a switch of electricity production from coal to gas; and (c) that UK shale gas production would substitute for a mix of UK production and imports, the latter of which could be by pipeline from Norway or the Continent or as LNG. Because the UK has strong links to the North West European gas market, production from unconventional gas in the UK alone is unlikely to have a significant impact on the wider European market price59 so the increase in gas demand and the coal-to-gas substitution are expected to be small. The first-order effect of the switch of electricity production from coal to gas would be to reduce the emissions-rate of the electricity production sector. Since this sector falls within the emissions trading scheme, there might be no effect on the overall emissions rate in the EU ETS (the reduction in electricity emissions would cause the value of emissions permits to fall slightly, and emissions-reduction effort in other sectors in the EU ETS would decline such that the emissions rate remained at the level set by the cap).&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study based in the United States found that, due to the fugitive emissions of methane, shale gas may produce more greenhouse gas emissions than coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howarth; et al|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was criticised by other researchers,{{according to whom|date=May 2017}}, but the authors argue that their data has since been corroborated by other studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cathles; et al|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howarth|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 government-sponsored study of the effect of large-scale natural gas development in Britain concluded that emissions from shale gas could be consistent with meeting climate change targets so long as the emissions were counteracted by similar size reductions elsewhere in the world, although the authors suggest that 'without global climate policies...new fossil fuel exploitation is likely to lead to an increase in cumulative carbon emissions and the risk of climate change'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacKay|Stone|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) issued its 5th Assessment report.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to natural gas, and the shale gas debate, it states "GHG emissions from energy supply can be reduced significantly by replacing current world average coal‐fired power plants with modern, highly efficient natural gas combined‐cycle power plants or combined heat and power plants, provided that natural gas is available and the fugitive emissions associated with extraction and supply are low or mitigated (robust evidence, high agreement). In mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 ppm CO2eq concentrations by 2100, natural gas power generation without CCS acts as a bridge technology, with deployment increasing before peaking and falling to below current levels by 2050 and declining further in the second half of the century (robust evidence, high agreement)".

In November 2014, the [[UK Energy Research Centre]] issued a report that stated "gas could play an important role as a ‘bridging fuel’ to a low-carbon economy, but warns that it won’t be long before gas becomes part of the problem rather than the solution". It noted that the UK imports more than half its gas, and that "gas use beginning to fall in the late 2020s and early 2030s, with any major role beyond 2035 requiring the widespread use of carbon capture and storage"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UK Energy Research Centre}}{{dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also states "Instead of banking on shale, UKERC recommends rapidly expanding investment in alternative low-carbon energy sources and investing in more gas storage, which would help protect consumers against short-term supply disruption and price rises"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gosden|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UKERC|2014a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UKERC|2014b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
&lt;!---write summary---&gt;
In 2012, the jointly published Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering Shale Gas Review included recommendations on groundwater contamination, well integrity, seismic risk, gas leakage, water usage and disposal, management of environmental risk, implementation of best practice, with well integrity being "of key importance".&lt;ref name=RAEreport&gt;{{cite report|title=Shale gas extraction in the UK: a review of hydraulic fracturing|url=http://royalsociety.org/uploadedFiles/Royal_Society_Content/policy/projects/shale-gas/2012-06-28-Shale-gas.pdf|date=28 June 2012|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air pollution===
&lt;!---Transferred from Hydraulic fracturing in the United Kingdom - these references will need to be placed in harvnb style---&gt;
There are concerns, originating in the USA that drilling could lead to pollution from hydrocarbon based chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fracking Fumes: Air Pollution from Hydraulic Fracturing Threatens Public Health and Communities|url=https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/fracking-air-pollution-IB.pdf|website=NRDC Issue BRIEF|publisher=Natural Resources Defense Council|accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulations in the UK call for total fluid and gas security meaning that in routine operations, no unburnt gases would be emitted.{{clarify|reason=Radon gas, as an unburned gas, would be emitted during flaring.

{{See also|Oil and gas industry in the United Kingdom#Flaring}}

===Groundwater contamination===
&lt;!---This needs expanding---&gt;
The British Geological Survey, in reviewing the US experience with hydraulic fracturing of shale formations, observed: "where the problems are genuinely attributable to shale gas operations, the problem is with poor well design and construction, rather than anything distinctive to shale gas."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|British Geological Survey|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contamination of groundwater by methane can occur after the abandonment of the well: "Gas and other contaminants may accumulate slowly in these cracks, enter shallow strata or even leak at the surface many years after production or well abandonment. Even the presence of surface casing provides no assurance against gas leakage at the surface from the surrounding ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Royal Society &amp; Royal Academy of Engineering|2012|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land usage===
&lt;!---This section was moved from Hydraulic fracturing in the United Kingdom. It's not relevant to hydraulic fracturing process. The information on Jonah Gas field in US was removed before moving here.---&gt;
[[Directional drilling]] allows a large hydrocarbon reservoir to be accessed using a single well pad, such as in Europe's biggest onshore oilfield, [[Wytch Farm]]. Likely well spacing visualised by the December 2013 DECC Strategic Environmental Assessment report indicated that well pad spacings of 5&amp;nbsp;km were likely in crowded areas, with up to 3 hectares per well pad. Each pad could have 24 separate wells. This amounts to 0.16% of land area.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|AMEC Environment &amp; Infrastructure UK Limited|12 December 2013|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Chartered Institute for Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM) stated that shale gas fields will potentially be "more extensive" than conventional onshore fields, using around 3.6&amp;nbsp;ha per shale gas well pad compared to 1.9&amp;nbsp;ha for conventional well pads, and that after "completion or abandonment" of a shale gas well pad, "it may not be possible to fully restore sites" "in areas of high agricultural, natural or cultural value".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CIWEM|2016|p=7}} "Shale gas formations typically cover much wider lateral extent than conventional gas reservoirs and will require multiple surface entry points. Surface installations require an area of approximately 3.6 hectares per pad for high volume hydraulic fracturing during the fracturing and completion phases, compared to 1.9 hectares per pad for conventional drilling. This opens the possibility of more extensive gas fields. Following the completion or abandonment of a well it may not be possible to fully restore sites particularly in areas of high agricultural, natural or cultural value. Over a wider area, with multiple installations, this could result in a significant loss or fragmentation of valuable farmland or natural habitats, which must be considered during the planning process."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Well integrity===
&lt;!---This section was moved from Hydraulic fracturing in the United Kingdom as it is relevant to shale gas in the United Kingdom. It requires extensive editing and the references need to be changed to harvnb style. Please do not edit this section until the references have been updated to the style followed by this page. Thank you---&gt;
According to Professor Mair, who chaired the joint review by the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering, "well integrity is of key importance".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Royal Academy of Engineering|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first UK shale gas well, Preese Hall 1, the [[cement bond log]] (CBL) showed some places with [[Well cementing|poor cement]] behind the casing in the lowest 100 feet of the well, between zones in the production hole section, which were repaired to achieve better zone isolation. Without repair, production would have been compromised, but not the integrity of the well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|2011|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magnitude 2.3M coseismic slip of 1 April 2011 caused casing deformation in "the lower section of the reservoir productive zone" of the Preese Hall 1 well. Well "integrity was not considered a risk" "due to the "integrity of the casing, and the cement, in the upper completion", "confirmed by surface gas measurements and annular pressure readings".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2012|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Well leak concerns====
It is commonly believed{{by whom|reason=WP:POV WP:Weasel. Commonly believed by whom? Claims about what people say, think, feel, or believe, and what has been shown, demonstrated, or proved should be clearly attributed|date=December 2016}} that '6% of wells leak immediately, 50% of wells leak after some time and all wells will leak eventually'. This is not an issue specific to shale gas exploration and production, it is a concern with every well that is drilled. This originates from a document that sells solutions for this problem to oil and gas companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bruffato; et al.|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|reason=We need a reference to a RS that states this. Reference doesn't support statement|date=April 2017}} This often relates to 'SCP', or Sustained Casing Pressure This is a 'well barrier' issue, but could also include casing 'integrity' (external) leaks. Regulation calls for baseline monitoring to determine if any leak issues are related to the drilled well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuadrillaresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GGS222-01-Preese-Hall-Summary-Report-26-02-14.pdf Preese Hall well report]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211740/http://www.cuadrillaresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GGS222-01-Preese-Hall-Summary-Report-26-02-14.pdf |date=23 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!---Summarise. Move pre-summarised to Well Cementing Article; Keep new summary---&gt;
If a well were to leak, workover operations can usually fix leaks, by, for instance, perforating the casing above and below a poorly cemented zone, and 'squeezing' cement behind the pipe. The cement is drilled out and a pressure test is performed until pressure integrity is good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remedial Cementing|url=http://petrowiki.org/Remedial_cementing|publisher=SPE International}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!---END---&gt;

In 2013, data from DECC was released concerning offshore and onshore well leaks from operating and abandoned wells and of the approx 2000 onshore wells, and approx 6500 offshore wells, the number of reported leaks between and 2008 and 2013 was zero,{{clarify|reason=FOI states in the last five years, although there was a need for two well integrity repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|DECC|2013}} Decc stated in the last five years:"As far as DECC OGED is aware, there have been no reports of leaks from abandoned wells in the last 5 years"&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, ReFINE published a report that investigated well leak concerns, involving UK's producing, suspended, old, abandoned, and 'orphaned' wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included a large number of data sets, from around the world, including some very old well data. There are issues of 'well barrier', where an internal leak is found, that does not leak to the environment, and 'well integrity' where external leaking/venting is an issue. The data provided often puts the two data sets together. In the ReFINE abstract, ''the percentage of wells that have had some form of well barrier or integrity failure is highly variable (1.9% to 75%)''.The ReFINE report does also indicate that there is no meaningful data on the bulk of the land based wells, and that only the 143 producing wells have been examined. The industry trade and advocacy group UKOOG welcomed the ReFINE report, stating that well leaks in the UK were little problem, and contrasted the small number of orphan wells with the estimated 250,000 abandoned mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UKOOG|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!---Belongs in Shale gas in the United States - well leak concerns---&gt;
Looking at the most recent results ''In a separate study of 3533 Pennsylvanian wells monitored between 2008 and 2011, there were 85 examples of cement or casing failures, 4 blowouts and 2 examples of gas venting''. A November 2013 paper states ''Well-integrity failure occurs when all barriers fail and a leak is possible. True well-integrity failure rates are two to three orders of magnitude lower than single-barrier-failure rates.''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King and King|title=Environmental Risk Arising From Well Construction Failure: Differences Between Barrier Failure and Well Failure, and Estimates of Failure Frequency Across Common Well Types, Locations and Well Age|journal=Spe Production &amp; Operations|volume=28|issue=4|pages=323–344|url=https://www.onepetro.org/journal-paper/SPE-166142-PA|accessdate=10 September 2016|doi=10.2118/166142-PA|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another paper from 2012 indicates that the bulk of the environment code violations in recent activity in Pennsylvania are nothing to do with well leaks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourenergypolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/UBSRSI-Environmental-Impact.pdf Environmental Impacts Consodine et al]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!---END---&gt;

A research paper by Watson and Bachu from 2009 indicates: ''Low cement top or exposed casing was found to be the most important indicator for sustained casing vent flow (SCVF)or gas migration (GM)SCVF/GM. The effect of low or poor cement was evaluated on the basis of the location of the SCVF/GM compared to the cement top. The vast majority of SCVF/GM originates from formations not isolated by cement.''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ingraffea|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current regulations from the HSE are designed to mitigate these concerns, and seal wells back to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Health and Safety Executive (HSE)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern has been raised {{by whom|reason=Please say who is concerned. Is it SEPA, the Scotland Environmental Protection Agency?|date=December 2016}} about some wells drilled before the latest guidelines that do have potential leak paths. An internal memo{{by whom|reason=whose internal memo is this?|date=December 2016}} shows on page 3{{clarify|reason=This document appears to be discussing Coal Bed Methane|date=December 2016}} that there is no cement from 1200 feet to the surface aquifer, and as such there is a potential leak path. If the casing were to leak due to corrosion or other reason, there would be a leak path from deep salty formations into the aquifer. In addition the aquifer is only protected by one layer of (uncemented) casing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pritchard|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!---This belongs in [[Shale gas in the United States]] or [[Oil and gas wells]]---&gt;
Information from the US Groundwater Protection Council shows that there is a failure rate of around 1 every 3500 wells, or 0.03%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fracfocus.org/sites/default/files/publications/state_oil__gas_agency_groundwater_investigations_optimized.pdf State Oil and Gas Agency Groundwater Investigations]&lt;/ref&gt;{{why|reason=This is US data, not UK.

==Political issues==
Shale gas development has brought with it various challenges for Britain's political parties.  That is particularly the case for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], where there are tensions between the aspirations of the leadership – who tend to view shale gas in terms of economic benefit, energy independence, and a means of reducing carbon emissions – and the priorities of many of its supporters who are hostile to the process, especially those who live in areas likely to be explored for shale gas.&lt;ref name=Guardian73113&gt;{{cite news |title= Once, the Tories understood rural Britain.

The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], in 2013 in a coalition government with the Conservative government which strongly supported shale gas development, began taking a position downplaying prospects for a "shale gas revolution", issuing several position papers on climate change which minimized the role of shale gas in favour of renewables.&lt;ref name=Observor82413&gt;{{cite news|title=Liberal Democrats blast environmental damage caused by fracking: Poll shows strong public opposition to fracking as Lib Dems speak out against Tories' push to drill for shale gas|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/24/lib-dems-damage-fracking-shale-gas-revolution|accessdate=25 August 2013|newspaper=The Observer The Guardian|date=24 August 2013|author=Toby Helm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] has been more reticent, but MPs have indicated they are receptive to shale gas development if environmental safeguards and an appropriate regulatory regime are in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An absolutist position on shale gas is not in our interests|url=http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/opinion/2157329/absolutist-position-shale-gas|accessdate=15 April 2014|website=Business Green|date=7 March 2012|author=Tom Greatrex MP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[UKIP]] is enthusiastic about shale gas development, a stance that is partly derived from its hostility to [[wind farms]].&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|title=Ukip: anti-fracking 'eco-freaks' will kill economic opportunity: Party's energy spokesman says fracking protesters would kill 'greatest new economic opportunity for UK in our lifetimes'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/20/ukip-shale-gas|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 September 2013|author=Damian Carrington}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Green Party`s energy policy EN264 states that: "We will halt the development of coal-bed methane, shale gas and similar hydrocarbon exploitation since it is not needed to meet UK energy demands, is environmentally destructive, and will lead to increasing GHG emissions".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.greenparty.org.uk/values/ Green Party | What We Stand For&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013 the government was solidly behind development of the fossil fuel shale gas industry and was offering to give shale gas companies favourable tax treatment for the unconventional energy source. Also they stated they would turn 100% of business tax proceeds over to local councils instead of the usual 50% which has been seen as controversial in some parts of the media.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/government-accused-of-bribing-local-councils-on-controversial-fracking-projects-9057077.html "Government accused of bribing local councils"], ''The Independent''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macalister 2013"/&gt;
Green Party leader [[Natalie Bennett]] said of the government's proposal to turn the business taxes gained from shale gas development over to the local councils: "It looks like the government is bribing local councils and it shows how desperate it is to get fracking accepted locally."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

The House of Lords report "The Economic Impact on UK Energy Policy of Shale Gas and Oil" from the Economic Affairs Committee was published in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201314/ldselect/ldeconaf/172/172.pdf House of Lords report]&lt;/ref&gt; It took evidence on a wide variety of subjects from a wide variety of sources. It concludes that shale gas exploration and development should go ahead urgently, and that the regulatory regime was complex, and a hindrance to growth.

In May 2014, the prospect of drilling under peoples homes was put out for consultation and the resulting report in October 2014 indicated that 99% of 40,000 responses were opposed to this.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/358521/Government_Response_FINAL.pdf Govt response to consultation]&lt;/ref&gt; The Infrastructure bill, which became law in February 2015, included an amendment that this was to be permitted. 
The National Farmers Union issued this statement that indicated concerns with property prices, long term environmental issues and payment for access in line with other industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfuonline.com/assets/33767 NFU consultation response]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/fracking/11141913/Farmers-fear-fracking-could-spell-financial-ruin.html Daily Telegraph and farmers]{{citation needed|reason=add link archive https://archive.is/20141006135021/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/fracking/11141913/Farmers-fear-fracking-could-spell-financial-ruin.html|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!---This is now included twice, with the addition of a new subsection in Regulation called Community and public engagement. Both the paragraph below, and the subsection 'Community and public engagement' that is currently in Regulation, need to be moved to 'Industry Response' and it needs to be stated that it is, as I understand it, an industry charter and not a regulation. This appears to be part of the operator's engagement with communities.---&gt;
The chemical firm Ineos has proposed that they would pay 6% of income in payments for local people, farmers,  and landowners. Ineos chairman Jim Ratcliffe said "Giving 6% of revenues to those living above Britain's shale gas developments means the rewards will be fairly shared by everyone." Friends of the Earth said this was a "transparent attempt to bribe communities"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ineos 6% pledge|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-29411261|publisher=BBC|date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflicts of interest===
There have been a number of concerns raised regarding conflicts of interest between policy makers and financial links to shale gas development, notably:
*Lord Browne of Cuadrilla - The former BP boss is chairman of Cuadrilla, which is exploring for shale gas in Lancashire and West Sussex. He is lead "non-executive" across Government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/why-the-former-bp-bosss-new-government-job-is-beyond-parody-2016399.html Why the former BP boss's new government job is beyond parody]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Baroness Hogg - The non-executive for the Treasury sits on the board of BG Group, which has significant shale gas assets in the United States.
*Sam Laidlaw - The non-executive to the Transport Department is also chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica, which recently bought a 25 per cent stake in Cuadrilla's most promising shale gas prospect.
*Ben Moxham - A former executive at BP when Lord Browne was at the helm, he followed the peer to Riverstone Holdings, which owns 42 per cent of Cuadrilla. Moxham was energy adviser at No 10 but quit in May 2013.
*Lord Howell - George Osborne's father-in-law is also president of the British Institute of Economics, whose backers include BP and BG Group.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/revealed-fracking-industry-bosses-at-heart-of-coalition-8707589.html Revealed: Fracking industry bosses at heart of coalition]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Viscount Ridley - The House of Lords Commissioner for Standards found that "Lord Ridley breached the Code of Conduct by not declaring his interests in Weir Group, whose activities include shale gas production, when speaking on the Energy Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The conduct of Viscount Ridley |url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201314/ldselect/ldprivi/119/119.pdf|publisher=HOUSE OF LORDS Committee for Privileges and Conduct 12th Report of Session 2013–14 |format=PDF|date=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs potential conflicts of interest with regards to shale gas development: 
*Baron Hollick: Has shares in Samson resources a US company with shale gas investments.
*Lord Skidelsky: invested in Janus Capital who hold stakes in oil and gas firms
*Lord Mcfall: Held investments in FTI consulting, fracking industry advisers
*Baroness Noakes: had shares in at least 3 firms with interests in shale gas.&lt;ref name= HoLEPCoI&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-committees/economic-affairs/EnergyPolicy/Declarations-for-web.pdf|title=Declarations of the Economic Affairs Committee members' interests for the inquiry into the economic impact on UK energy policy of shale gas and oil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2014/05/08/energy-interests-house-lords-economic-affairs-committee/|title=Revealed: What energy interests do the House of Lord's economic affairs committee have?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPRE Northumberland's Chairman David Montag-Smith is also chairman of the board of directors of Rathlin Energy Ltd who are exploring Yorkshire for shale gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/10465022/We-are-open-to-fracking-says-leading-environmental-group.html|title=CPRE Chairman David Montag-Smith open to fracking|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20141007084932/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/10465022/We-are-open-to-fracking-says-leading-environmental-group.html|archivedate=7 October 2014|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moratoria===
&lt;!----This needs to include information on all moratoria; It will also require summarising in parent header 'Political'---&gt;
In July 2014, the Scottish Government issued an Expert Scientific Panel Report on Unconventional Oil &amp; Gas which investigated the technical, and environmental challenges of this technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expert Scientific Panel Report on Unconventional Oil &amp; Gas|url=http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0045/00456579.pdf|publisher=Scottish Government|accessdate=9 February 2015|ref=ISBN 9781784126834}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the third reading of the Infrastructure bill in January 2015, Scotland imposed a moratorium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moratorium called on fracking|url=http://news.gov.scot/news/moratorium-called-on-fracking|publisher=Scottish Government|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; pending another environmental review. This prompted negative comment from the original report authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Simon |first1= Johnson |title= SNP fabricated reasons for fracking ban, says expert |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/energy/fracking/11382948/SNP-fabricated-reasons-for-fracking-ban-says-expert.html |accessdate= 9 February 2015 |publisher= Daily Telegraph |date= 1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--In October 2014, the European Academies Science Advisory Council issued an expert review of "the issues around fracking and the underlying science" following the EU Commission's January 2014 recommendations for "Minimum principles for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons (such as shale gas) using high volume hydraulic fracturing". The expert review stated: "This EASAC analysis provides no basis for a ban on shale gas exploration or extraction using hydraulic fracturing on scientific and technical grounds".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite report |title= Shale gas extraction: issues of particular relevance to the European Union |url= http://www.easac.eu/fileadmin/PDF_s/reports_statements/EASAC_Statement_ShaleGasExtraction.pdf |publisher= European Academies Science Advisory Council |date= October 2014 |accessdate= 10 December 2014 |quote= This EASAC analysis provides no basis for a ban on shale gas exploration or extraction using hydraulic fracturing on scientific and technical grounds, although EASAC supports calls for effective regulations in the health, safety and environment fields highlighted by other science and engineering academies and in this statement.}}&lt;/ref&gt; -hid this as it is nothing to do with moratoria KW--&gt;

&lt;!---Explain how this is a moratorium?---&gt;
The Welsh Government stated that applications from drilling companies must be referred to ministers from February 2015. "Planning applications for the exploration, appraisal, or extraction of unconventional oil and gas which would utilise unconventional techniques (including hydraulic fracturing) must be referred to the Welsh Ministers, where local planning authorities are minded to approve them"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Town and Country Planning (Notification) (Unconventional Oil and Gas) (Wales) Direction 2015|url=http://gov.wales/topics/planning/policy/dear-cpo-letters/unconventional-oil-and-gas/?lang=en|publisher=Welsh Government|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion===
Quarterly "Wave" polling, originally commissioned by DECC (now BEIS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy and Climate Change Public Attitudes Tracker - GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/public-attitudes-tracking-survey|website=www.gov.uk|accessdate=29 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been monitoring public opinion on shale gas with its Energy and Climate Change Public Attitudes Tracker since Wave 8 (December 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=DECC|title=Wave 8|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/277080/summary_wave_8_findings_decc_public_attitudes_tracker.pdf#4|format=PDF|date=4 February 2014 |accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eighth wave showed 27% supported "extracting shale gas to generate the UK’s heat and electricity", while 21% opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC)|title=DECC Public Attitudes Tracker - Main stage questionnaire - Wave 8|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/277081/wave_8_questionnaire.pdf#4|publisher=HMSO|accessdate=29 March 2017|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of Wave 20 (December 2016), that position has shifted with 18%  supporting extraction of shale gas and 31% opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy|title=Energy and Climate Change Tracker - Wave 20|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/602451/Summary_of_key_findings_BEIS_Public_Attitudes_Tracker_-_wave_20__2_.pdf#7|accessdate=29 March 2017|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Nottingham ‘Survey of Public Attitudes to Shale Gas Extraction in the UK’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/pressreleases/2016/october/support-for-fracking-is-at-an-all-time-low-says-new-survey.aspx | title=Support for fracking is at an all-time low, says new survey - the University of Nottingham}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been running since March 2012. This series of polls shows that public support for the extraction and use of shale gas (from those who correctly identified shale gas in the gateway question), has fallen from a peak of 58.3% in July 2013 to just over 37.3% by the twelfth poll in October 2016. In the same time period opposition is shown as having grown from 18.8% to 41.1%. The October 2016 poll was "a milestone" according to its authors as for the first time a majority of respondents were opposed to its development in the UK. Moreover, across the survey there had been an increase in respondents associating shale gas with negative environmental impacts. As concerns about the environmental impacts of shale gas have increased the poll's authors say they have seen the UK public become less convinced of its benefits to the economy and the energy security of the UK.

A survey by YouGov for Friends of the Earth, published in August 2016,&lt;ref name="drillordrop.com"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://drillordrop.com/2016/08/15/pms-fracking-payment-plan-fails-to-win-majority-support-for-shale-gas-poll/ | title=PM's fracking payment plan fails to win majority support for shale gas – poll| date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 33% of people would support fracking in their local area if individual households received a payment of up to £10,000. According to the research, 43% said they would oppose fracking despite the payment and 25% said they didn’t know.

July 2016 Polling by ComRes for Remsol&lt;ref name="drillordrop.com"/&gt; showed support for shale gas at 26% with opposition at 46%, with shale gas being the least popular energy source when compared to solar, onshore wind, nuclear, biomass and electricity storage.

Both the 2016 YouGov and ComRes polling showed that while men in the UK were evenly divided about fracking, women were strongly against it;
DECC/BEIS wave polling&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-and-climate-change-public-attitudes-tracker-wave-20 | title=Energy and Climate Change Public Attitudes Tracker: Wave 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that support for renewables has consistently been stronger than support for fracking, with support for on-shore wind having increased from 66% to 71% between Waves 1 and 19."

A January 2014 ''Guardian'' poll found that a majority support shale gas extraction, but by a somewhat narrower margin than previously.  To the question "Should shale gas extraction be allowed?" 53% said yes (down from 58% in July 2012), and 27% answered no (up from 19% in July 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vaughan|first=Adam|title=Public support for fracking in Britain falls for a second time|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/28/fracking-protest-david-cameron-public-support-poll|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 January 2014|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll conducted by ''[[Opinium Research LLP|Opinium]]/[[The Observer|Observer]]'' in August 2013 showed that while men in the UK were evenly divided about fracking taking place in their area, women were strongly against it; the population as a whole preferred renewables such as wind farms.&lt;ref name="Observor82413"/&gt;

An ICM poll in August 2013 found that public opinion in the UK was in favour of hydraulic fracturing in general, by 44% in favour to 30% opposed. However, when asked if they favoured hydraulic fracturing in their own area, the public split evenly, 40% in favour to 40% against. Support for fracking was stronger among men, older people, and conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Harvey, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/13/fracking-splits-public-opinion-icm-poll "Fracking splits public opinion down the middle, poll finds"], ''The Guardian'', 13 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sky-3.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The sky above the [[cloud]]s]]

The '''sky''' (or '''celestial dome''') is everything that lies above the surface of the [[Earth]], including the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] and [[outer space]].

In the field of [[astronomy]], the sky is also called the [[celestial sphere]]. This is viewed from Earth's surface as an abstract dome on which the [[Sun]], [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, and [[Moon]] appear to be [[diurnal motion|traveling]]. The celestial sphere is conventionally divided into designated areas called [[constellation]]s. Usually, the term ''sky'' is used informally as the point of view from the Earth's surface; however, the meaning and usage can vary. In some cases, such as in discussing the [[weather]], the sky refers to only the lower, more dense portions of the atmosphere.

During [[daylight]], the sky appears to be [[blue]] because [[air]] [[Rayleigh scattering|scatters]] more blue [[sunlight]] than red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=John Tyndall | date=December 1868 |title=On the Blue Colour of the Sky, the Polarization of Skylight, and on the Polarization of Light by Cloudy Matter Generally |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]] |volume=17 |pages=223–233 |doi=10.1098/rspl.1868.0033 |jstor=112380|url=http://rspl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/17/223.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lord Rayleigh | date=June 1871 |title=On the scattering of light by small particles |journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]] |volume=41, 275 |pages=447–451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=J.G.

During the day, the Sun can be seen in the sky unless obscured by [[cloud]]s. In the [[night sky]] (and to some extent during the day) the Moon, planets and stars are visible in the sky. Some of the natural phenomena seen in the sky are [[cloud]]s, [[rainbow]]s, and [[Polar Aurora|aurorae]]. [[Lightning]] and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] can also be seen in the sky during [[storm]]s. [[Bird]]s, [[insect]]s, [[aircraft]], and [[kite flying|kites]] are often considered to [[Flight|fly]] in the sky. Due to human activities, [[smog]] during the day and [[light pollution]] during the night are often seen above large [[city|cities]].

{{See also|Atmospheric optics}}

Except for [[sunlight|light]] that comes directly from the sun, most of the light in the day sky is caused by [[diffuse sky radiation|scattering]], which is dominated by a small-particle limit called [[Rayleigh Scattering]].

Scattering also occurs even more strongly in [[cloud]]s. Individual water droplets exposed to white light will create a set of colored rings.  If a cloud is thick enough, scattering from multiple water droplets will wash out the set of colored rings and create a washed-out white color.{{clarify|date=October 2014|reason=What in the world is "a washed-out white color"?}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Yi8r4qgMV4C&amp;pg=PA427&amp;dq=water+droplet+scattering+light+atmosphere&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2f5GT_zMNaiZ0QGX_MiPDg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=water%20droplet%20scattering%20light%20atmosphere&amp;f=false|title=Fundamentals of atmospheric radiation: an introduction with 400 problems|author=Craig F.

The sky can turn a multitude of colors such as red, orange, purple and yellow (especially near [[sunset]] or [[sunrise]]) when the light must pass through a much longer path (or [[optical depth]]) through the atmosphere.  Scattering effects also partially [[Polarization (waves)|polarize]] light from the sky and are most pronounced at an angle 90° from the sun.  Scattered light from the [[horizon]] travels through as much as 38 times the atmosphere as does light from the [[zenith]], causing a blue [[Image gradient|gradient]]: vivid at the zenith, and pale near the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/science/wonderquest/2001-04-11-bluer-sky.htm|title=Bluer on top|work=[[USA Today]]|date=11 April 2001|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because red light also scatters if there is enough air between the source and the observer causing parts of the sky to change color during a sunset. As the amount of atmosphere nears infinity, the scattered light appears whiter and whiter.&lt;ref name="Lynch" /&gt;

The sun is not the only object that may appear less blue in the atmosphere. Far away clouds or snowy mountaintops may appear yellowish. The effect is not very obvious on clear days but is very pronounced when clouds cover the line of sight, reducing the blue hue from scattered sunlight.&lt;ref name="Lynch"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Abp5FdhskAC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=distant+clouds+snow+covered+mountains+appear+yellow+book#v=onepage&amp;q=distant%20clouds%20snow%20covered%20mountains%20appear%20yellow%20book&amp;f=false|title=Color and light in nature|author=David K.

The intensity of the sky varies greatly over the day, and the primary cause of that intensity differs as well. When the sun is well above the horizon, direct scattering of sunlight (Rayleigh scattering) is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. However, in twilight, the period of time between sunset and night and between night and sunrise, the situation is more complicated. [[Green flash]]es and green rays are [[optical phenomenon|optical phenomena]] that occur shortly after [[sunset]] or before [[sunrise]], when a [[green]] spot is visible above the sun, usually for no more than a second or two, or it may resemble a green ray shooting up from the sunset point. Green flashes are a group of phenomena that stem from different causes,&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite news | author=Young, A. | url=http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/papers/Zenit/glance.html | title=Green flashes at a glance | date=2006 | work=San Diego State University page | accessdate=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of which occur when there is a temperature inversion (when the temperature increases with altitude rather than the normal decrease in temperature with altitude). Green flashes may be observed from any [[altitude]] (even from an aircraft). They are usually seen at an unobstructed [[horizon]], such as over the [[ocean]], but are also seen over cloud tops and mountain tops. Green flashes may also be observed at the horizon in association with the [[Moon]] and bright planets, including [[Venus]] and [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nave|first=C.R.|title=Red Sunset, Green Flash|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/redsun.html|work=Georgia State University|publisher=HyperPhysics|accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Connell|first=D.J.K.|title=The green flash and other low sun phenomena|journal=Castel Gandolfo: Vatican Observatory, Ricerche Astronomiche|date=1958|volume=4|page=7|publisher=Harvard|bibcode=1958RA......4.....O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Earth's shadow]] is the [[shadow]] that the [[Earth]] casts on its [[atmosphere]]. This [[atmospheric phenomenon]] is sometimes seen twice a day, around the times of sunset and sunrise.  When the weather conditions and the observer's viewing point permit a clear sight of the horizon, the shadow can be seen as a dark blue or greyish-blue band. Assuming the sky is clear, the Earth's shadow is visible in the half of the sky opposite to the sunset or sunrise, and is seen as a dark blue band right above the [[horizon]]. A related phenomenon is the "[[Belt of Venus]]" or "anti-twilight arch", a pink band that is visible above the dark blue band of the Earth's shadow in the same part of the sky. There is no clear dividing line between the Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus: one colored band shades into the other in the sky.&lt;ref name=AO&gt;{{cite web|title=Earth's shadow|publisher = Les Cowley |author =Les Cowley|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=15 February 2012|url = http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/earshad.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=earth-shadow&gt;{{cite book|title=Color and light in nature|author= David K.

Twilight is divided into three segments according to how far the sun is below the horizon, measured in segments of 6°. After sunset the [[civil twilight]] sets in; it ends when the sun drops more than 6° below the horizon. This is followed by the [[nautical twilight]], when the sun is 6° and 12° below the horizon (heights of between −6° and −12°), after which comes the [[astronomical twilight]], defined as the period from −12° to −18°. When the sun drops more than 18° below the horizon, the sky generally attains its minimum brightness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/twilight/index.htm|publisher=[[University of Toronto]]|author=Dr. Irv Bromberg|date=4 April 2011|accessdate=15 February 2012|title=The Duration of Twilight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several sources can be identified as the source of the intrinsic brightness of the sky, namely [[airglow]], indirect scattering of sunlight, scattering of starlight, and artificial [[light pollution]].

== During the night ==
{{Main|Night sky}}
[[File:Polarlicht 2.jpg|thumb|Aurora borealis over Bear Lake, Alaska]]
[[File:Deathvalleysky nps big.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Milky Way]] can be seen as a large band across the night sky, and is distorted into an arch in this 360° [[panorama]].]]

The term night sky refers to the sky as seen at [[night]]. The term is usually associated with [[skygazing]] and [[astronomy]], with reference to views of [[celestial bodies]] such as stars, the Moon, and planets that become visible on a clear night after the Sun has set. Natural light sources in a night sky include [[moonlight]], [[starlight]], and airglow, depending on location and timing.  The fact that the sky is not completely dark at night can be easily observed. Were the sky (in the absence of moon and city lights) absolutely dark, one would not be able to see the silhouette of an object against the sky.

The night sky and studies of it have a historical place in both ancient and modern [[cultures]].  In the past, for instance, [[farmers]] have used the state of the night sky as a [[calendar]] to determine when to plant [[agriculture|crops]].  The [[history of astrology|ancient belief]] in [[astrology]] is generally based on the belief that relationships between heavenly bodies influence or convey information about events on [[Earth]].  The ''scientific'' study of the night sky and bodies observed within it, meanwhile, takes place in the science of astronomy.

Within [[visible-light astronomy]], the visibility of celestial objects in the night sky is affected by light pollution. The presence of the Moon in the night sky has historically hindered astronomical observation by increasing the amount of ambient lighting. With the advent of artificial light sources, however, light pollution has been a growing problem for viewing the night sky. Special filters and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for the best views, both professional and amateur optical astronomers seek viewing sites located far from major urban areas.

=== Tropical cyclones ===
[[File:Tropical cyclone eyewall P-3.jpg|thumb|right|Picture of the sky in the eye of a tropical cyclone]]
Within 36&amp;nbsp;hours of the passage of a [[tropical cyclone]]'s center, the pressure begins to fall and a veil of white cirrus clouds approaches from the [[cyclone]]'s direction.  Within 24&amp;nbsp;hours of the closest approach to the center, low clouds begin to move in, also known as the [[bar (tropical cyclone)|bar]] of a tropical cyclone, as the barometric pressure begins to fall more rapidly and the winds begin to increase. Within 18&amp;nbsp;hours of the center's approach, [[squall]]y weather is common, with sudden increases in wind accompanied by rain showers or thunderstorms. Within six hours of the center's arrival, rain becomes continuous. Within an hour of the center, the rain becomes very heavy and the highest winds within the tropical cyclone are experienced. When the center arrives with a strong tropical cyclone, weather conditions improve and the sun becomes visible as the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] moves overhead. Once the system departs, winds reverse and, along with the rain, suddenly increase. One day after the center's passage, the low overcast is replaced with a higher overcast, and the rain becomes intermittent. By 36&amp;nbsp;hours after the center's passage, the high overcast breaks and the pressure begins to level off.&lt;ref&gt;[[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]] (23 July 2006).

{{See also|Astrology|Sky father}}

Many mythologies have deities especially associated with the sky.  In [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]], the sky was deified as the goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] and as the god [[Horus]]. [[Dyeus]] is reconstructed as the god of the sky, or the sky personified, in [[Proto-Indo-European religion]], whence [[Zeus]], the god of the sky and [[thunder]] in [[Greek mythology]] and the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] god of sky and thunder [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].

In [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]], [[Altjira]] (or Arrernte) is the main sky god and also the creator god. In [[Iroquois mythology]], [[Atahensic]] was a sky goddess who fell down to the ground during the creation of the Earth. Many cultures have drawn [[constellation]]s between [[star]]s in the sky, using them in association with [[legend]]s and [[mythology]] about their [[deities]].

A '''sorbent''' is a material used to [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorb]] or [[Adsorption|adsorb]] liquids or gases. Examples include:
*A material similar to [[molecular sieve]] material, which acts by adsorption (attracting molecules to its surface). It has a large internal [[surface area]] and good [[thermal conductivity]]. It is typically supplied in pellets of 1&amp;nbsp;mm to 2&amp;nbsp;mm diameter and roughly 5&amp;nbsp;mm length or as grains of the order 1&amp;nbsp;mm. Occasionally as beads up to 5&amp;nbsp;mm diameter. They are typically made from [[aluminium oxide]] with a porous structure.
*Materials used to absorb other materials due to their high [[Chemical affinity|affinity]] for doing so. Examples include:
**In [[composting]], dry (brown, high-[[carbon]]) materials absorb many [[odoriferous]] [[chemical]]s, and these chemicals help to decompose these sorbents.
**A [[sponge]] absorbs many times its own weight in water.
**A [[polypropylene]] fiber mat may be used to absorb oil.
**A [[cellulose]] fiber product may be used to absorb oil.
**The granular gel material in a baby [[diaper]] will absorb several times its original weight in [[urine]].

**[[Desiccant]]s attract water, [[drying]] out ([[desiccation|desiccating]]) the surrounding materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4511">The '''Twomey effect''' describes how additional [[cloud condensation nuclei]] (CCN), possibly from anthropogenic pollution, may increase the amount of solar radiation reflected by clouds. This is an indirect effect (or [[radiative forcing]]) by such particles, as distinguished from direct effects (forcing) due to enhanced scattering or absorbing radiation by such particles not in clouds.

Cloud droplets normally form on aerosol particles that serve as CCN. Increasing the number concentration of CCN can lead to formation of more cloud droplets, which, in turn, have smaller size. The increase in number concentration increases the [[optical depth]] of the cloud, which results in increase in the cloud [[albedo]] making clouds appear whiter. Satellite imagery often shows trails of cloud or of enhanced brightness of cloud behind ocean-going ships due to this effect. The decrease in global mean absorption of solar radiation due to increases in CCN concentrations exerts a cooling influence on climate; the global average magnitude of this effect over the industrial era is estimated as between -0.3 and -1.8 Wm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC 4th Assessment Report, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Derivation ==
Assume a uniform cloud that extends infinitely in the horizontal plane, also assume that the particle size distribution peaks near an average value of &lt;math&gt;\bar{r}&lt;/math&gt;.

The formula for the optical depth of a cloud:

&lt;math&gt;\tau=2\pi h\bar{r}^{2} N&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the optical depth, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is cloud thickness, &lt;math&gt;\bar{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the average particle size, and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the total particle density.

The formula for the liquid water content of a cloud is:

&lt;math&gt;LWC = \tfrac{4}{3} \pi\bar{r}^{3}\rho_L h N&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\rho_L&lt;/math&gt;is the density of water.

Taking our assumptions into account we can combine the two to derive this expression:

&lt;math&gt;\tau= \tfrac{3}{2} \tfrac{LWC}{\rho_L \bar{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

If we assume liquid water content (&lt;math&gt;LWC&lt;/math&gt;) is equal for the cloud before and after altering the particle density we obtain:

&lt;math&gt;\bar{r_2}=\bar{r_1}\left ( \frac{N_1}{N_2} \right )^{\frac{1}{3}}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we assume total particle density &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is increased by a factor of 2 and we can solve for how &lt;math&gt;\bar{r_1}
&lt;/math&gt; changes when &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is doubled.

&lt;math&gt;\bar{r_2}&lt;/math&gt;= &lt;math&gt;0.79\bar{r_1}=\bar{r_1}\left ( \frac{N_1}{2N_1} \right )^{\frac{1}{3}}&lt;/math&gt;

We can now take our equation that relates &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;LWC&lt;/math&gt; to solve for the change in optical depth when the particle size is reduced.

&lt;math&gt;\tau_2 = \frac{\tau_1}{0.79}=1.26 \, \tau_1&lt;/math&gt;

In more general terms, the Twomey effect states that for a fixed liquid water content &lt;math&gt;LWC&lt;/math&gt; and cloud depth, the optical thickness can be represented by:

&lt;math&gt;\tau\varpropto N^\tfrac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

This brings us to the conclusion that increasing the total particle density also increases the optical depth, illustrating the Twomey Effect mathematically.

[[File:Vegetable lamb of tartary.png|thumb|The Vegetable Lamb in a 17th-century illustration]]
The '''Vegetable Lamb of Tartary''' ([[Latin]]: ''Agnus scythicus'' or ''Planta Tartarica Barometz''&lt;ref&gt;These are not [[scientific name]]s, but predate [[binomial nomenclature]].&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Legendary creature|legendary]] [[zoophyte]] of [[Central Asia]], once believed to grow [[sheep]] as its [[fruit]]. It was believed the sheep were connected to the plant by an [[umbilical cord]] and grazed the land around the plant. When all accessible foliage was gone, both the plant and sheep died.

Underlying the legend is the [[Gossypium|cotton plant]], which was unknown in [[Cotton#Europe|Northern Europe]] before the [[Norman conquest of Sicily]].

==Characteristics==
[[Thomas Browne]]'s ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' named it as the ''Boramez''.&lt;ref name=Brow&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=aOI_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA227|title=Pseudodoxia Epidemica, Or, Enquiries Into Very Many Received Tenents, and Commonly Presumed Truths|publisher=Edward Dod|author=[[Thomas Browne]]|edition=4|volume=3|page=227|year=1658|publication-place=London|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ephraim Chambers' ''[[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopædia]]'', Agnus scythicus was described as a kind of [[zoophyte]], said to grow in [[Tartary]], resembling the figure and structure of a lamb. It was also called ''Agnus Vegetabilis'', ''Agnus Tartaricus'' and bore the reported [[endonym]]s of ''Borometz'', ''Borametz'' and ''Boranetz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;id=HistSciTech.CycloSupple01&amp;entity=HistSciTech.CycloSupple01.p0073|title=A supplement to Mr. Chambers's cyclopædia: or, universal dictionary of arts and sciences.

In his book, ''The Vegetable Lamb of Tartary'' (1887), [[Henry Lee (naturalist)|Henry Lee]] describes the legendary lamb as believed to be both a true animal and a living plant. However, he states that some writers believed the lamb to be the fruit of a plant, sprouting forward from melon-like seeds. Others, however, believed the lamb to be a living member of the plant that, once separated from it, would perish. The vegetable lamb was believed to have blood, bones, and flesh like that of a normal lamb. It was connected to the earth by a stem, similar to an umbilical cord, that propped the lamb up above ground. The cord could flex downward, allowing the lamb to feed on the grass and plants surrounding it. Once the plants within reach were eaten, the lamb died. It could be eaten, once dead, and its blood supposedly tasted sweet like honey. Its wool was said to be used by the native people of its homeland to make head coverings and other articles of clothing. The only carnivorous animals attracted to the lamb-plant (other than humans) were wolves.&lt;ref name="Lee, 1887, p2" &gt;{{cite book

==Possible origins==
[[File:Mandeville cotton.jpg|thumb|Fanciful depiction of cotton by John Mandeville, featuring sheep instead of cotton bolls.]]
[[File:Hans Sloane's vegetable lamb of Scythia specimen.jpg|thumb|An illustration of the specimen of the vegetable lamb, actually the rhizome of the fern [[Cibotium barometz|''Cibotium barometz'']],  [[Hans Sloane]] included in a letter published in Philosophical Transactions, Volume 20, in 1698.]]
The Greek historian Herodotus wrote of trees in India "the fruit whereof is a wool exceeding in beauty and goodness that of sheep. The natives make their clothes of this tree-wool."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History|last=Herodotus|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Book III}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is mention of a similar plant-animal in Jewish folklore as early as AD 436. This creature, called the Yeduah ({{Hebrew|ידוע}}, {{Hebrew|ידעוני}}, or {{Hebrew|[[:he:אדני השדה|אַדְנֵי הַשָׂדֵה]]}}), was like a lamb in form and sprouted from the earth connected to a stem. Those who went hunting the Yeduah could only harvest the creature by severing it from its stem with arrows or darts. Once the animal was severed, it died and its bones could be used in divination and prophetic ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Lee5"&gt;[[#Lee, 1887|Lee, 1887]] p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative version of the legend tells of the "jeduah", a human-shaped plant-animal connected to the earth from a stem attached to its navel. The jeduah was believed to be aggressive, though, grabbing and killing any creature that wandered too close. Like the Barometz, it too died once severed from its stem.&lt;ref name="Lee, 1887, p6" &gt;[[#Lee, 1887|Lee, 1887]] p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minorite Friar [[Odoric of Pordenone]], upon recalling first hearing of the vegetable lamb, told of trees on the shore of the Irish Sea with gourd-like fruits that fell into the water and became birds called Bernacles.&lt;ref name="Lee11"&gt;[[#Lee, 1887|Lee, 1887]] p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt; He is referring to the legendary plant-animal, the barnacle tree, which was believed to drop its ripened fruit into the sea near the Orkney Islands. The ripened fruit would then release "[[barnacle goose#Folklore|barnacle geese]]" that would live in the water, growing to mature geese. The alleged existence of this fellow plant-animal was accepted as an explanation for migrating geese from the North.&lt;ref&gt;Lehner, Ernst, and Johanna Lehner. ''Folklore and Symbolism of Flowers, Plants, and Trees''. New York: Tudor Publishing Company, 1960. pg. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work ''The Shui-yang or Watersheep and The Agnus Scythicus or Vegetable Lamb'' (1892), [[Gustav Schlegel]] points to Chinese legends of the "watersheep" as inspiration for the legend of the Vegetable Lamb of Tartary. Much like the vegetable lamb, the watersheep was believed to be both plant and animal and tales of its existence placed it near Persia. It was connected to the ground by a stem and, if the stem were severed, it would die. The animal was protected from aggressors by an enclosure built around it and by armored men yelling and beating drums. Its wool was also said to be used for fine clothing and headdresses.&lt;ref name="Schlegel23" &gt;Schlegel, Gustav. "The Shui-yang or Watersheep and The Agnus Scythicus or Vegetable Lamb". ''Acts of the 8th International Congress of Orientalists''. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1892. pg 23.&lt;/ref&gt; (In turn, the origin of watersheep is an explanation for [[sea silk]].)

==In search of the legend==
[[File:Bertuch-Vegetable-Lamb.png|right|thumb|"Das Boramez, oder Scythische Lamm (The Baromez, or Scythian Lamb)" from [[Friedrich Justin Bertuch|Friedrich Johann Justin Bertuch]]'s picture book for children]]

Earlier versions of the legend tell of the lamb as a fruit, springing from a melon or gourd-like seed, perfectly formed as if born naturally. As time passed, this idea was replaced with the notion that the creature was indeed both a living animal and a living plant. Gustav Schlegel, in his work on the various legends of the vegetable lamb, recounts the lamb being born without its horns, but with two puffs of white, curly hair instead.&lt;ref name="Schlegel23" /&gt;

The 14th century book, ''[[The Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]'' is credited with bringing the legend to public attention in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/04/fantastically-wrong-vegetable-lamb-tartary/|title=Fantastically Wrong: When People Thought Lambs Grew Right Out of the Ground|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It describes a strange gourd-like fruit grown in Tartary. Once ripe, the fruit was cut open, revealing what looked like a lamb in flesh and blood but lacking wool. The fruit and the lamb could then be eaten.&lt;ref name="Lee5" /&gt;

Friar [[Odoric of Friuli]], much like Mandeville, travelled extensively and claimed to have heard of gourds in Persia that when ripe, opened to contain lamb-like beasts.&lt;ref name="Lee11" /&gt;

In the mid-16th century, [[Sigismund von Herberstein|Sigismund, Baron von Herberstein]], who in 1517 and 1526 was the Ambassador to the Emperors Maximilian I and Charles V, presented a much more detailed account of the Barometz in his "Notes on Russia." He claimed to have heard from too many credible sources to doubt the lamb’s existence and gave the location of the creature as being near the Caspian Sea, between the [[Ural River|Jaick]] and Volga rivers. The creature grown from the melon-like seeds described was said to grow to two and half feet high (80&amp;nbsp;cm), resembling a lamb in most ways except a few. It was said to have blood, but not true flesh as it more closely resembled that of a crab. Unlike a normal lamb, its hooves were said to be made of parted hair. It was the favourite food of wolves and other animals.&lt;ref name="Lee, 1887, p12" &gt;[[#Lee, 1887|Lee, 1887]] p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1600 Sir Hans Sloane claimed a Chinese tree fern, ''[[Cibotium barometz]]'', was the origin of the myth. Sloane found the specimen in a Chinese cabinet of curiosities he acquired. The "lamb" is produced by removing the leaves from a short length of the fern's woolly [[rhizome]]. When the rhizome is inverted, it fancifully resembles a woolly lamb with the legs being formed by the severed petiole bases.&lt;ref name="Large&amp;Braggins"&gt;{{cite book|title=Tree Ferns|last=Large|first=Mark F.|author2=John E. Braggins|publisher=Timber Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-88192-630-9|location=Portland, Oregon|page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German scholar and physician [[Engelbert Kaempfer]] accompanied an embassy to Persia in 1683 with the intention of locating the lamb. After speaking with native inhabitants and finding no physical evidence of the lamb-plant, Kaempfer concluded it to be nothing but legend.&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, Gustav. ''The Shui-yang or Watersheep and The Agnus Scythicus or Vegetable Lamb. Acts of the 8th International Congress of Orientalists.'' Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1892. pg 31.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he observed the custom of removing an unborn lamb from its mother’s womb in order to harvest the soft wool and believed the practice to be a possible source of the legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tryon |first=Alice |title=The Vegetable Lamb of Tartary |journal=American Fern Journal |volume=47 |issue=1 |year=1957 |pages=1–7 [pg. 5] |doi=10.2307/1545391}}&lt;/ref&gt; He speculated further that museum specimens of the fetal wool could be mistaken for a vegetable substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carrubba |first=Robert |title=Engelbert Kaempfer and the Myth of the Scythian Lamb |journal=The Classical World |volume=87 |issue=1 |year=1993 |pages=41–47 [pg. 45] |jstor=4351440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In poetry==
In Dr. [[Erasmus Darwin]]’s work ''[[The Botanic Garden]]'' (1781), he writes of the Borametz:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
E'en round the Pole the flames of love aspire,
And icy bosoms feel the secret fire,
Cradled in snow, and fanned by Arctic air,
Shines, gentle borametz, thy golden hair
Rooted in earth, each cloven foot descends,
And round and round her flexile neck she bends,
Crops the grey coral moss, and hoary thyme,
Or laps with rosy tongue the melting rime;
Eyes with mute tenderness her distant dam,
And seems to bleat – a vegetable lamb&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darwin  |first=Erasmus  |authorlink=Erasmus Darwin  |title=[[The Botanic Garden]]|location=London |publisher=Jones &amp; Company  |origyear=1781  |year=1825}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas]] writes of the vegetable lamb in his poem ''La Semaine'' (1587). In the poem, Adam wanders the Garden of Eden and is amazed by the peculiarity of the creature. [[Joshua Sylvester]] translates:&lt;ref name="Lee18" &gt;[[#Lee, 1887|Lee, 1887]] p.&amp;nbsp;18&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
But with true beasts, fast in the ground still sticking
Feeding on grass, and th' airy moisture licking,
Such as those Borametz in Scythia bred
Of slender seeds, and with green fodder fed;
Although their bodies, noses, mouths, and eyes,
Of new-yeaned lambs have full the form and guise,
And should be very lambs, save that for foot
Within the ground they fix a living root
Which at their navel grows, and dies that day
That they have browzed the neighboring grass away.
Oh! Wondrous nature of God only good,
The beast hath root, the plant hath flesh and blood.
The nimble plant can turn it to and fro,
The nummed beast can neither stir nor goe,
The plant is leafless, branchless, void of fruit,
The beast is lustless, sexless, fireless, mute:
The plant with plants his hungry paunch doth feede,
Th' admired beast is sowen a slender seed.&lt;ref name="Lee18" /&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his work ''Connubia Florum, Latino Carmine Demonstrata'' (1791), Dr. De la Croix writes of the vegetable lamb (translated):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
For in his path he sees a monstrous birth,
The Borametz arises from the earth
Upon a stalk is fixed a living brute,
A rooted plant bears quadruped for fruit,
…It is an animal that sleeps by day
And wakes at night, though rooted in the ground,
To feed on grass within its reach around.&lt;ref&gt;Ho, Judith. [https://web.archive.org/web/20090530074448/http://www.nal.usda.gov/pgdic/Probe/v2n3/legend.html Legend of the Lamb Plant]. ''Probe'' Vol. 2(3) (fall 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
