'''Adrian Parr''' (born 1967) is an Australian-born philosopher and cultural critic. She specializes in environmental philosophy and activism. She has also published on the sustainability movement, climate change politics, activist culture, and creative practice.

==Biography==
Parr was born in Sydney Australia. Her father, [[Mike Parr]], and her aunt, [[Julie Rrap]], are contemporary Australian artists who introduced Parr to the world of activist culture at an early age.

She completed her bachelor's degree with First Class Honors in Philosophy at Deakin University in 1998, followed by a Master's in Philosophy in 2000. She began her PhD studies under the direction of the feminist philosopher Clair Colebrook. Parr's PhD dissertation "Creative Production: From Da Vinci to Deleuze” was revised and published by Edwin Mellen Press in 2003.

Between 2003 and 2006 she was a professor of cultural criticism at Savannah College of Art and Design. Whilst in Savannah, Parr co-founded (with Avantika Bawa and Celina Jeffery) [http://drainmag.com/about/ Drain: A Journal of Contemporary Art and Culture].

In 2006 she moved to the University of Cincinnati. Parr was a tenured Full Professor with a joint appointment in the Department of Political Science and the School of Architecture and the Interior Design at the University of Cincinnati. In 2011 she was awarded the [https://www.uc.edu/fellows/recipients.html Rieveschl Award for Scholarly and Creative Work].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Rieveschl Award Recipients|url=https://www.uc.edu/fellows/recipients.html|website=The Fellows of the Graduate School|publisher=University Cincinnati|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinguished award recognizes a University of Cincinnati faculty for professional achievement in creative and scholarly work.  In 2013, she was appointed Director of The Charles Phelps Taft Research Center and Chair of Taft Faculty.

In 2013, Parr was one of the speakers at the "[http://www.fox19.com/story/22424235/cincinnati-joins-national-march-against-monsanto-movement March Against Monsanto]" rally held in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Cincinnati rally was part of a national movement of protests that called attention to the dangers of using genetically modified food. The protest also spotlighted the companies that use genetically modified [http://www.wsmv.com/story/22424235/cincinnati-joins-national-march-against-monsanto-movement food].

In that same year (2013), Parr, along with Dr. Dion Dionysiou (also of the University of Cincinnati) were appointed as UNESCO Co-Chairs Co-Chairs of Water Accessibility and Sustainability.  In July 2017, Parr was one of the founding signatories for the [https://genevaactions.org/signatories Geneva Actions on Human Water Security].  The signatories are committed "to prioritize local and global actions and to focus on water solutions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Founding Signatories|url=https://genevaactions.org/signatories|website=The Geneva Actions on Human Water Security}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, Parr was appointed Dean of the College of Architecture, Planning and Public Affairs (CAPPA) at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA).

==Public Outreach==

In November 2013, Adrian Parr and Michael Zaretsky co-directed the ''[http://www.futurecitieslf.com/ Future Cities; Livable Futures]'' symposium, a public event that provided a platform for attendees to share and discuss the future of urban life. ''Future Cities; Livable Futures'' featured an interdisciplinary panel of speakers focused on topics such as sustainable urban development, increasing population, inadequate infrastructure, poor social services, escalating health problems, and challenges posed by climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heyne|first1=Mark|title=Future Cities; Livable Futures|url=http://wvxu.org/post/future-cities-livable-futures|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Parr and Zaretsky were [http://wvxu.org/post/future-cities-livable-futures interviewed] on public radio about sustainable urban development and their notion of livable cities.  She was also interviewed by public radio for her views on [http://wvxu.org/post/importance-and-continuing-struggle-clean-water-us-and-around-world#stream/0 environmental racism].  Then again on CBS where she described [http://local12.com/news/newsmakers/newsmakers-september-3-2017 Hurricane Harvey] as more of a man-made disaster than a natural disaster.

In 2014 Parr founded [http://louderthanabombcincy.com/ Louder Than A Bomb Cincy]. She worked with local organizations, University of Cincinnati affiliations, spoken-word poets, and Cincinnati public school district teachers to bring what is the largest youth poetry slam in the nation, to Cincinnati. According to an article in the News Record, "LTAB was originally founded in Chicago in 2001 through nonprofit Young Chicago Authors as a festival for young spoken word artists of diverse cultural backgrounds to gather and engage in performances of their poetry."She has been interviewed on national public radio and television for her work directing the Louder Than A Bomb Cincy program.  Her interviews have included [https://ucmail.uc.edu/owa/redir.aspx?C=3CM8YkjG-8x_8mpfYBbvghCzpnfvSpUL-ZX7tFGCCyf6NZK2tzXVCA..&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwvxu.org%2fpost%2flouder-bomb-youth-poetry-slam-finals-april-9%23stream%2f0 2016 interview with NPR], [http://www.wlwt.com/article/worlds-larget-youth-poetry-slam-coming-to-cincinnati/3206942 a 2015 interview with WVXU Chanel 5], and an earlier [http://wvxu.org/post/poetry-slam-blends-arts-youth-cultures#stream/0 2015 NPR interview with Bill Reinhardt].

In addition to community outreach, Parr has spoken on and been interviewed for her views on climate change, environmental degradation, and sustainable development. In her capacity as a UNESCO water chair, she is strong advocate for water justice. In a [http://wvxu.org/post/importance-and-continuing-struggle-clean-water-us-and-around-world#stream/0%20The%20Importance%20of,%20and%20Continuing%20Struggle%20for%20Clean%20Water%20in%20the%20USA%20and%20Around%20the%20World NPR interview] for World Water Day Parr speaks of the ongoing struggle for clean, accessible, and affordable water the world over. Again on public radio she speaks of the connection between environmental racism and the struggles of Native American communities to survive the rising seas and the contamination of their water supplies. Later, in a television interview with the Newsmakers, Parr describes Hurricane Harvey as more of a man-made than a natural disaster.

In an [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/opinion/our-crime-against-the-planet-and-ourselves.html interview] for The New York Times with journalist Natasha Lennard, Parr discusses how environmental damage and climate change are not only forms violence but a crime against humanity. In his [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/opinion/humans-in-dark-times.html op-ed] in The New York Times Brad Evans, the founder/director of the [https://www.historiesofviolence.com/ Histories of Violence Project] expanded upon Parr's framework of climate violence explaining that environmental degradation is a crime against humanity.  Evans writes, Parr "also posed the question of what a crime against humanity actually means in such a context. It turns out, there are many ways in which damage to the environment rises to that level. This type of violence presents profound existential questions about what it means to be human and the ontological crimes (i.e., a crime against the human as such) some of us wage against ourselves."

==Films==
In 2016, Parr produced, wrote, and narrated her first documentary, ''The Intimate Realities of Water''.   Parr co-directed the film with Sean Hughes.  In addition, Sean Hughes was the editor and Jon Hughes, his father was the director of photography. When the documentary was released in 2016, it was screened it was screened at numerous independent film festivals in the United States where it went on to win 13 awards.

The film follows the lives of four women living in the slums of Nairobi, documenting the water and sanitation challenges they face. National public radio featured an [http://wvxu.org/post/uc-professors-talk-about-their-documentary-intimate-realities-water#stream/0 interview] with Parr and the film team where they discussed the making of the film.

From 2014-2017 Parr produced and directed the TAFTtalks and H2Otalks series.  TAFTtalks concentrate on drawing out issues of interest beyond the academy and focus on big, contemporary ideas, and concerns.  Among those she has interviewed for TAFTtalks include Tara Houska and [http://www.rosibraidotti.com/ Rosi Braidotti].  Houska is a staunch activist of Native American rights.  She is an Ojibwe of Saulteaux, Couchiching First Nation and is the founding board member of Not Your Mascots. Houska was also the Native American adviser for Bernie Sanders, during his presidential campaign, and Houska is the National Campaigns Director for Honor the Earth.  Braidotti is a Distinguished University Professor and the director of the Centre for the Humanities at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.

The H2Otalks were featured as a part of the 50th anniversary of the UNESCO Water Programmes during the 38th UNESCO General Conference, as part of the "50 Years, 50 Movies on Water," in November 2015.  Those she has interviewed include prominent environmentalist [http://www.billmckibben.com/ Bill McKibben].

== Writing ==
Parr has published numerous books on environmental politics, the built environment, and cultural production.

*{{cite book|title=Birth of a New Earth|date=212|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0231180098|location=New York City, New York|last1=Parr|first1=Adrian}} 
**Her most recent book, ''Birth Of A New Earth'', was published by Columbia University Press in 2017.  In his endorsement of the book, 350.org founder [[Bill McKibben]] writes "As Adrian Parr suggests in timely fashion, imagination may be the best weapon we have in the fight against environmental destruction, as useful as a new engine or a bigger windmill."  [[Ananya Roy]], author of ''Poverty Capital: Microfinance and the Making of Development'', describes Parr's book, as "one that not only provides a rigorous and critical analysis of emergent environmentalisms but also charts how imaginations of a 'new earth' can be forged at the limits of liberal democracy.  In this sense, the book is as much about the political as it is about the environmental.  It is a must-read for our times." [[Henry Giroux]], author of ''America at War with Itself'', noted that "''Birth Of A New Earth'' is one of those rare and brilliant books that critiques the ongoing destruction of the environment in a writing style that is lyrical compassionate and as accessible as it is informative. Parr masterfully weaves together a language of critique and possibility and in doing so makes a convincing case of environmental and economic justice on a global scale and offers a powerful argument for rethinking the meaning and practice of politics." The book explores how activists and popular movements are fighting the environmental crisis of climate change and the ongoing devastation of the earth.  The influence of the growing environment can be seen in how corporate mission statements, government policy, and national security agendas now focus much more on sustainability.  Parr maintains political scenarios for change often pursue either a revolutionary platform or a reformist agenda.  She argues these are false choices as she advocates for an emancipatory political imagination, maintaining that environmental politics engages the twofold problem of democratization and decolonization. 
*{{cite book|title=The Wrath of Capital: Neoliberalism and Climate Change Politics|date=212|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0231158289|location=New York City, New York|last1=Parr|first1=Adrian}} 
**This monograph has also been commended by a number of experts in the environmental profession.  [[Raj Patel]], the author of the two books ''Stuffed and Starved'' and the ''Value of Nothing,'' said of Parr's book, "With this short, pointed, and very welcome text, Parr blends political theory and startling fact to refresh our understanding about the capitalist roots of environmental change."  Parr's work investigates the intersection of social and environmental justice issues, arguing that the neoliberalism framework is hurting climate change talks and policy. Parr concentrates on how those with the most economic power continue to have control over the environmental change discourse. Many scholars felt this work contributed greatly to the field.  In positive review of this work, M. M. Gunter Jr., of Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla., wrote Parr “presents an engaging, hard-cutting critique of neoliberalism, arguing more transformative politics are needed to address climate change and sustainability problems worldwide but that a ‘Trojan horse’ of market mechanisms under the dominant neoliberal paradigm prevents viable alternatives from emerging.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunter Jr.|first=M.M.|date=August 2013|title=Book Review of the Wrath of Capital: Neoliberalism and Climate Change Politics|url=http://www.cro3.org/content/50/12/50-7016.full|journal=Choice Reviews Online|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Global Environmental Politics, Rebecca Pearse, a research associate working on the Global Arenas of Knowledge at the University of Sydney, also writes that the book gives scholars and activists, who are looking for an introduction of leftist critiques on environmental politics, will receive a good summary from Parr’s book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pearse|first=R.|date=2014|title=Book Review|url=|journal=Global Environmental Politics|volume=14|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critical of this work, John Bellamy Foster, a sociology professor at the University of Oregon, writes in “Contemporary Sociology,” Parr “confuses matters by providing seemingly conflicting definitions of ‘neoliberalism,’ which she describes as (1) ‘a more virulent strain’ of the liberalism inherited from Adam Smith,’ (2) ‘a cultural mode of production that in turn defines the political economy,’ and (3) a particular ‘agenda.'”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=J.B.|date=2015|title=The Climate Movement: Environmental Sociology, Climate Change, and the Left|url=|journal=Contemporary Sociology|volume=44|issue=3|pages=314–321|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He says Parr allows readers to use words such as “capital,” “capitalism, and “the law of value,” interchangeably, when the three words have three, different meanings.  Ryder W. Miller, a freelance environmental and science reporter based in San Francisco, writes in the Electronic Green Journal (2013), that Parr focuses too much on drawbacks of the environmental movement and does not acknowledge all the achievements of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=R.|date=2013|title=Book Review|url=|journal=Electronic Green Journal|publisher=|volume=1|issue=35|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

**Along with Michael Zaretsky, also a University of Cincinnati professor, Parr edited this anthology on sustainable design and development initiatives, combining the viewpoints of practitioners and scholars.  The central idea is that sustainable design is not merely about material production but also about changing the way people live, their relationship to the world, and one another.  This text combines a number of essays from recognized experts in sustainability practices, in theory and design to construction, on order to develop a comprehensive approach to thinking, designing, building, and living sustainably. According to [[WorldCat]], the book is held in 228 libraries &lt;ref name="wc" /&gt; 
*{{cite book|last1=Parr|first1=Adrian|title=Hijacking sustainability|date=2009|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262517469}}
**· In this work, Parr argues that contemporary environmental activism, rather than helping redress environmental issues, is actually hurting these same issues.  She uses five examples of where the capitalists are hijacking sustainability: corporate image-greening, Hollywood activism, gated communities, the greening of the White House, and the incongruous efforts to achieve a ‘sustainable’ army. These examples are also used to help explain how architecture, especially urban spaces, add to global inequality by contributing more distinct boundaries between areas with and without poverty.    This work received several positive reviews.

In a critical review of this work, R. Moore,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Review: Adrian Parr, Hijacking Sustainability|last = Moore|first = R.|date = 2010|journal = Spontaneous Generations: A Journal for the History and Philosophy of Science|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 1|volume = 4|pages = 284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the University of Toronto, argues that Parr failed to adequately define the core term “sustainability.” While a difficult task, greater clarity is required in order to avoid an argument that is “at best vague and at worst incomprehensible” (p.&amp;nbsp;284).  Failing to clarify the term “sustainability culture,” Moore contends that readers do not get a good description of the type of individuals and organizations who can further environmental progress without adding to the capitalistic machine.  Monika also notes she would like to see Parr add solutions about way people can fix this problem of “Hijacking Sustainability.”According to [[WorldCat]], the book is held in 420 libraries &lt;ref name="wc" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 2010|title=Adrian Parr (2009), ''Hijacking Sustainability'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 209pp.|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/pdfplus/10.3366/E1750224110000899|journal=Deleuze Studies|volume=4|issue=1|pages=138–145|doi=10.3366/E1750224110000899|last1=Hillier|first1=Jean|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2010|title=''Hijacking Sustainability: Capitalism, Militarism, and the Struggle for Collective Life'' (review)|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/symploke/summary/v018/18.1-2.wilson.html|journal=symploke|volume=18|issue=1-2|pages=387–389|last1=Wilson|first1=Aimee|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

**This work combines critical theory, cultural studies, and media theory with empirical research to describe the political scope of collective remembrance of traumatic events, e.g., the event of 9/11, the Holocaust, and the Amish shooting in Pennsylvania. Parr argues that memorialization, e.g., monuments marking a tribute, is not a means of capturing a definitive, implicitly negative historical truth of events but is, instead, a form of cultural production of a collective memory, which offers means of positive therapeutic outcomes for a group of people.

**Co-edited this anthology with Ian Buchanan, now the director of the Institute for Social Transformation Research based at the University of Wollongong, the goal of this book is to show how Deleuzian concepts can be seen in today's political concerns.  Contributors use Deleuzian theories when explaining a number of real-world issues, e.g., the Holocaust, immigration, and the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. Parr and Buchanan here defend Deleuzian concepts from some of their largest critics, many of whom attack Deleuze concepts as too abstract or idealistic. Contributors to this book include, Nicholas Thoburn, senior lecturer in sociology at the University of Manchester; Kenneth Surin, Professor of Literature and Professor of Religion and Critical Theory at Duke University; Rosi Braidotti, Distinguished University Professor at Utrecht University and director of the Centre for the Humanities in Ultrect, in the Netherlands ; Verena Andermatt Conley, Visiting Professor at Harvard University; Paul Patton, Philosophy Professor at the University of New South Wales, in Sydney, Australia; Eugene W.

**First published by Columbia University Press in 2005, the book was subsequently expanded and published 2010 by both Columbia University Press and Edinburgh University Press. In the 2010 edition, Parr makes a new connection between Deleuze's more recent work and architecture, cinema, psychoanalysis, biology, and geography.  An expanded bibliography is also included. The book includes more than 150 entries, with some focus on individuals who have impacted Deleuze's work such as Spinoza, Nietzsche, Kafka, Hume, Leibniz, and Bergson, while the majority of the entries focus on Deleuze's main oppositional concepts, e.g., molar/molecular, exteriority/interiority, and deterritorialisation/reterritorialization. To help readers, many of the entries also provide a list of “’connectives,’” which point readers toward other sections in the dictionary.

**Parr reworked and published her dissertation under a new title, with Edwin Mellen Press. This work examines the connections between science, technology, philosophy, art, and design developing a concept of creative production. Looking at the da Vinci’s sketchbooks and work, Parr analyzes his method of creative production, arguing that da Vinci takes and reworks what is real, through an imaginative process, allowing a new reality to emerge.

'''''Adversus Valentinianos''''', or '''''Against the Valentinians''''', is a famous refutation of [[Valentinianism]] by [[Tertullian]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Seb99|Seban 1999]]. p. 947.&lt;/ref&gt; an orthodox contemporary of the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] and one of the first to investigate them. The work satirized the bizarre elements that appear in Gnostic mythology, ridiculing the Gnostics for creating elaborate cosmologies, with multi-storied heavens like apartment houses.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pag89|Pagels 1989]]. pp. xxix, 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though an enemy of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]], Tertullian nevertheless spoke of him as a brilliant and eloquent man. Tertullian claims that Valentinus refused to submit himself to the superior authority of the bishop of Rome because he wanted to become bishop himself. In Tertullian's version of events, when another man was chosen to be bishop, Valentinus was filled with envy and frustrated ambition and separated himself from the church to found a rival group of his own. Tertullian's story follows a typical polemic against heresy, maintaining that envy and ambition lead heretics to deviate from the true faith, and for this and other reasons is largely rejected by historians. Twenty years after the incident which Tertullian claims led to their separation from it, followers of Valentinus still considered themselves full members of the church, and they resisted orthodox attempts to expel them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pag89|Pagels 1989]]. pp. 36, 39, 161, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious historian [[Elaine Pagels]] writes that though Tertullian's story may be untrue, it illustrates the potential of heresy to encourage insubordination to clerical authority, which Christians saw as one of its dangers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pag89|Pagels 1989]]. pp. 39, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anacalypsis.jpg|thumb|The original edition of ''Anacalypsis'' by [[Godfrey Higgins]]]]

'''''Anacalypsis''''' (full title: '''''Anacalypsis: An Attempt to Draw Aside the Veil of the Saitic Isis or an Inquiry into the Origin of Languages, Nations and Religions''''')  is a lengthy two-volume treatise written by religious historian [[Godfrey Higgins]], and published after his death in 1836. The book was published in two quarto volumes numbering 1,436 pages, and contains meticulous references to hundreds of references. Initially printed as a limited edition of 200 copies, it was partially reprinted in 1878, and completely reprinted in a limited edition of 350 copies in 1927. In 1965, University Books, Inc. published 500 sets for the United States and 500 sets for the British Commonwealth with Publisher's Note and a Postface.

==Meaning of the word "Anacalypsis"==
A problem that the reader may find in [[Godfrey Higgins|Higgins]]' book is that the meaning of the title is unexplained. In the original London edition of 1836, the word ''Anacalypsis'' appears only twice: once in the title, and once in a footnote on page 447, in which Higgins expresses his plan for a sequel titled ''Commentaries on the Anacalypsis and on Ancient History''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Godfrey Higgins]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sNBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA447 ''Anacalypsis'']. Published by Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, and Longman: London, 1836. Footnote on page 447.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''anacalypsis'' comes from the Greek ''ανακάλυψης'', which can be translated as «discovery» or «find». ''Anacalypsis'' is the antonym of "[[apocalypse]]." In the [[Godfrey Higgins|Higgins]]´ book, the meaning of the word is twofold:

* On the one hand, the idea of anacalypsis is seen as something that is evident, transparent and clear, while the apocalyptic is mysterious, dark, and enigmatic.
* On the other hand, ''apocalypse'' means ''revelation'' and refers to the last canonical book of the [[New Testament]], [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], which states that the world is heading for an imminent and tragic end.

Regarding to the second meaning, it is very important to understand that, the [[Godfrey Higgins|Higgins]]´ book, ''anacalypsis'' does not refer to a teleological principle, but a regression towards the beginning that allows us to see through light how myths were created, precisely like the [[apocalypse]] in many religions. In fact, the title of the work speaks precisely about this unveiling from the Egyptian goddess [[Isis]]. The idea of ''anacalypsis'' as "unveiling" was discussed in depth by the Russian-born writer and theosophist [[Helena Blavatsky]] in her book ''[[Isis Unveiled]]''.

==Content==
The work is the product of more than twenty years of research during which Higgins tried to uncover "a most ancient and universal religion from which all later creeds and doctrines sprang."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mandaeanworld.com/mandaean_bibliography_book_11 mandaeanworld.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050501212148/http://www.mandaeanworld.com/mandaean_bibliography_book_11 |date=2005-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes several [[map]]s and [[lithograph]]ic plates of [[Druid]]ical Monuments. The book itself details many of Higgins' beliefs and observations about the development of religion. Among these was his theory that a secret religious order, which he labeled "Pandeism" (from Pans- or Pandu- referring to a family of Gods, appending with -ism), had continued from ancient times to the present day, stretching at least from Greece to India, and possibly having once covered the entire world.

Among the many theories presented in this book is that both the [[Celt]]ic Druids and the [[Jew]]s originated in India – and that the name of the [[Biblical]] [[Abraham]] is really a variation of the word [[Brahma]], created by shifting the last letter to the beginning: Abrahma. Higgins used the term "Pandeism" to describe the religious society that he purported had existed from ancient times, and at one time had been known throughout the entire world. Higgins believed this practice continued in secret until the time of his writing, in the 1830s in an area stretching from [[Greece]] to India.

{{cquote|
I think Pandeism was a system; and that when I say the country or kingdom of Pandæa, I express myself in a manner similar to what I should do, if I said the Popish kingdom, or the kingdoms of Popery: or, again, the Greeks have many idle ceremonies in their church, meaning the Greeks of all nations: or, the countries of the Pope are superstitious, &amp;c. At the same time, I beg to be understood as not denying that there was such a kingdom as that of Pandæa, the daughter of Cristna, any more than I would deny that there was a kingdom of France ruled by the eldest son of the church, or the eldest son of the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;[[Godfrey Higgins]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sNBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA439 ''Anacalypsis''] (1836). Book 8, chapter 8, section 2; page 439.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His usage appears related to [[pantheism]], but is distinctly different. While pantheism normally refers to one universal god, the Pandeism described by Higgins, refers to the worship of a family, a union, or a [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of gods which are collectively universal.

Higgins was a follower of [[John Toland]]; although Toland had lived in an era when "deism" and "theism" were interchangeable, Higgins wrote during the 1820s and 1830s, a period several generations later when [[deism]] was popular and  became distinct from [[theism]]. When coining "Pandeism", Higgins showed his awareness of the similarity between Pandeism and [[pantheism]] by directly contrasting his Pandeism with Toland's pantheism:
{{cquote|
Many persons have thought that this ''Pan'' related to what has been called Pantheism, or the adoration of universal nature, and that Pantheism was the first system of man. For this opinion I cannot see a shadow of foundation. As I have formerly said, it seems to me contrary to common sense to believe, that the ignorant half-savage would first worship the ground he treads upon,— that he would raise his mind to so abstruse and so improbable a doctrine as, that the earth he treads upon created him and created itself: for Pantheism instantly comes to this.&lt;ref&gt;[[Godfrey Higgins]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sNBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA440 ''Anacalypsis''] (1836). Book 8, chapter 8, section 2; page 440.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Higgins was also aware of the similarity between his Pandeism and deism, and demonstrated familiarity with deism, as he mentions deism or deists at several other points in the same work. Higgins noted for example that "the [[Robert Taylor (Radical)|Rev. R. Taylor, A.M.]], the Deist, now in gaol, persecuted by the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] for his religious opinions, in his learned defense of Deism called the ''[[Diegesis]]'', has clearly proved all the hierarchical institutions of the Christians to be a close copy of those of the [[Essenes|Essenians]] of [[Egypt]]." &lt;ref&gt;''Anacalypsis'', pg. 787.&lt;/ref&gt;

While more contemporary [[pandeism]] evokes both pantheism and deism and suggests their combination, Higgins' usage is removed from both. Whereas Toland's construction of pantheism was based on the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] root words ''pan'', meaning ''all'' and ''Theos'', meaning ''God'', Higgins flips the construction around, stating:
{{cquote|
When I consider all the circumstances detailed above respecting the Pans, I cannot help believing that, under a mythos, a doctrine or history of a sect is concealed. [[Kunti|Cunti]], the wife of [[Pandu]] (du or God, Pan), wife of the generative power, mother of the [[Pandavas]] or devas, daughter of Sura or Syra the Sun — Pandæa only daughter of Cristna or the Sun — Pandion,&lt;ref&gt;The person Higgins refers to as "Pandion" here is more commonly known as [[Aegeas]], the husband of Medea and father of Medus; Aegeas was himself the son of [[Pandion II]], and Higgins' reference clearly equated Aegeas with the [[Kinship and descent|lineage]] of his father; use of the less common name, Pandion, connects this figure to Pandu and others with Pand- names.&lt;/ref&gt; who had by [[Medea]] a son called [[Medus]], the king of the Medes, who had a cousin, the famous [[Perseus]] — surely all this is very [[mythological]] — an historical parable!

...

We have seen that though Cristna was said to have left many sons, he left his immense empire, which extended from the sources of the [[Indus River|Indus]] to [[Cape Comorin]], (for we find a Regio Pandionis near this point,) to his daughter Pandæa; but, from finding the icon of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] so constantly shaded with the nine Cobras, &amp;c., I am induced to think that this Pandeism was a doctrine, which had been received both by [[Buddhists]] and [[Brahmin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Godfrey Higgins]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sNBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA439 ''Anacalypsis''] (1836). Book 8, chapter 8, sections 1 and 2; page 439.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In contrast to Toland, Higgins uses the word "Pans" or "Pande" to collect variations of named gods or godlike heroes – such as [[Pandu]], Pandæa, the [[Pandava]]s, and Pandion – into a single system of worship called "Pandeism" as a sort of family name for a group of godlike individuals. Thus where Toland's term referred to pan- (all) and -theism (god), Higgins refers to Pande- (a root indicating this family of gods) and [[-ism]], a wholly English construction indicating allegiance to an ideology. The term related by Higgins refers to a secret sect of worshipers of these "Pans", which was left in the wake of the collapse of an ancient empire that stretched from [[Greece]] (the home of [[Medea]] and [[Perseus]]) to India (where the [[Buddhists]] and the [[Brahmins]] coexist). Higgins concludes that his observations:

{{cquote|
...confirm the very close connexion which there must have been in some former time, between [[Siam]], [[Afghanistan]], Western [[Syria]], and Ireland. Indeed I cannot doubt that there has been really one grand empire, or one Universal, one Pandæan, or one Catholic religion, with one language, which has extended over the whole of the old world; uniting or governing at the same time [[Colombo|Columbo]] in the island of Serendive, and [[Iona|Columbo]] in the West of Scotland...&lt;ref&gt;[[Godfrey Higgins]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sNBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA443 ''Anacalypsis''] (1836). Book 8, chapter 8, sections 3; page 443.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While worthy of note, the above discussion is an example of what Higgins tries to present in his work: that religious scripture is written in a manner to confuse rather than clarify.  The exhaustive discussion above comparing "Pandeism" and "Pantheism", while valid, fails to disclose the main emphasis of his effort, which is to show that all religions are the same and from a lost, antediluvian, original source in which all characters are allegoric representations of the zodiac with the primary deity being the sun.  His theory is that this lost doctrine has been corrupted, by ignorance of allegory or by intentional purposes, from ancient times up and through Higgins' own time.

==Death and later influence==
Higgins died before he was able to complete the final chapter on [[Christianity]]. Higgins leaves clues, however, that there may be additional layers of meaning in his work, stating in the preface to Vol. I of 'Anacalypsis':

:I think it right to warn my reader, that there are more passages than one in the book, which are of that nature, which will be perfectly understood by my [[Masonic]] friends, but which my engagements prevent me explaining to the world at large.&lt;ref&gt;''Anacalypsis'', xx.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decades later, [[John Ballou Newbrough]] cited extensively to the ''Anacalypsis'', including Higgins' use of Pandeism, in the notes to Newbrough's 1882 ''[[Oahspe]] Bible''.&lt;ref&gt;John Ballou Newbrough, ''Oahspe Bible'', pg. 874.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar, possibly related coinings of Pandeism have occurred elsewhere. One author writes of a contemporary religious group in Bali (which is within the geographic realm of Pandeism described by Higgins):

:The empu uses a typical pedanda ketu, "crown" which is tall and red, and a ball. Another man leads Pande ceremonies on the island. He represents a curious mix of Buddhism, Hinduism, and, if it can be called this, "Pandeism".&lt;ref&gt;Fred B. Eiseman, Jr., ''Bali: Sekala and Niskala: Essays on Religion, Ritual, and Art'' (1989) p. 89. {{ISBN|0-945971-03-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later references==
[[Kersey Graves]], author of the 1875 book ''[[The World's 16 Crucified Saviours]],'' derived "many of the most important facts collated in [his] work" from the Anacalypsis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/kersey_graves/16/ infidels.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vsevolod Solovyov]], author of the 1895 book, ''[[A Modern Priestess of Isis]]'', was alleged to have [[plagiarized]] extensively from Higgins, among others. The same investigator also alleged similar plagiarism in [[Madame Blavatsky|Madame Blavatsky's]] 1888, work, ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theohistory.org/thcovers/thscan103.html#Anchor-of-47942 theohistory.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Twentieth century author [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]] and contemporary author [[Tom Harpur]], both proponents of the [[Christ myth theory]], reference Higgins in their writings, particularly in Harpur's 2004 best-seller, ''[[The Pagan Christ]]''.

The '''Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club''', founded in October 1878, is a [[philosophy]] discussion group that meets weekly at Cambridge during term time. Speakers are invited to present a paper with a strict upper time limit of 45 minutes, after which there is discussion for an hour. Several Colleges have hosted the Club: [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]], [[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin College]], [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], and from 2014 [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College]].

The club has been highly influential in [[analytic philosophy]] because of the concentration of philosophers at Cambridge. Members have included many of British philosophy's top names, such as [[Henry Sidgwick]], [[J.M.E. McTaggart]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G.E. Moore]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and several papers regarded as founding documents of various schools of thoughts had their first airing at a club meeting. Moore's "The Nature of Judgment" was first read to the club on 21 October 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, G.E. [http://fair-use.org/mind/1899/04/the-nature-of-judgment "The Nature of Judgment"], Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, April 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank P. Ramsey]]'s "Knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description" was presented to a meeting in 1911, and in 1926 became ''Truth and Probability''. Russell's "Limits of Empiricism" was read in the Michaelmas term of 1935, [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s "The Facts of the Social Sciences" was read in the Michaelmas term of 1942, and [[Moore's paradox]] was first read in Michaelmas 1944.  Almost every major anglophone philosopher since the Second World War has delivered a paper to the club.&lt;ref name=history&gt;Ahmed, Arif. [http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/seminars-phil/seminars-msc-history "The Moral Sciences Club (A Short History)"], Faculty of Philosophy, University of Cambridge, 2013, accessed 30 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during a meeting of the Moral Sciences Club in October 1946 that Wittgenstein famously waved a [[Fire iron|poker]] at Sir [[Karl Popper]] during a heated discussion about whether philosophical problems are real or just [[Linguistic philosophy|linguistic games]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
The club originally emerged from the Grote Society in 1874,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jonathan and Stray, Christopher. ''Teaching and Learning in Nineteenth-Century Cambridge''. Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2001, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; but it lasted only two years. In 1878, another group decided to revive it, led by [[Alfred Caldecott]] &amp;mdash;later professor of logic and mental philosophy at King's College London&amp;mdash;when he was a third-year undergraduate at John's. They used the same name, and regular meetings began on 19 October 1878, consisting of Caldecott; [[Joseph Jacobs]], later founder of the Jewish Historical Society and a friend of [[George Eliot]]; and Alfred Momerie, who also became a professor of logic at King's College London. It was decided that meetings would take place each Saturday in term time at nine in the evening, with membership restricted to those who had taken or were reading for the moral sciences [[tripos]]. The first recorded club paper was "Development Theories of Conscience," read by [[Thomas Edward Scrutton|T.E. Scrutton]] of Trinity College on 26 October that year.&lt;ref name=Pitt&gt;Pitt, Jack. [http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1617&amp;context=russelljournal "Russell and the Cambridge Moral Sciences Club"], "Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies: Vol. 1, issue 2, article 3, winter 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambridge Apostles===
{{main|Cambridge Apostles}}
Jack Pitt infers from the decision to meet on Saturdays that none of the original members were Apostles, the secret Cambridge debating society that had been meeting on Saturdays since it was formed in 1820. The day of the club meeting was changed to Friday in 1885, when [[Henry Sidgwick]] was president, which allowed the Apostles to attend club meetings, and vice versa. Sidgwick was already an Apostle and [[J.M.E. McTaggart]] became both club secretary and an Apostle in 1886. Several other Apostles joined the club over the years&amp;mdash;including [[Bertrand Russell]], [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[A.N. Whitehead]], [[G. Lowes Dickinson]], [[G.H. Hardy]], Crompton Llewelyn Davies, C.P. Sanger, A.E.A.W. Smyth, and H.T. Norton&amp;mdash;and several Apostles after Sidgwick and McTaggart became officers of the club, including [[G.E. Moore]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

==Women==
[[File:14. Members of the Moral Science Club, Cambridge, c. 1913.jpg|left|thumb|Members of the Moral Science Club, Cambridge, c. 1913. In the front row, third from left, is [[James Ward (psychologist)|James Ward]]; to the right of him, [[Bertrand Russell]]; next to [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] is [[William Ernest Johnson|W. E. Johnson]]; in the second row, on the far right, is [[J. M. E. McTaggart|McTaggart]]; and third from the right, [[G. E. Moore]]]]
Women were never formally restricted from membership, but because women were not allowed to take the tripos examinations until 1881 and were not granted full membership of the university with the right to obtain degrees until 1947, the club was mostly a male affair in its early days. The first record of women even listening to papers was in Michaelmas 1894, when [[Sidney Webb, 1st Baron Passfield|Sidney Webb]] read "The Economic Basis of Trade Unionism," and the audience included his wife [[Beatrice Webb]] and two women from [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton College]], a women's college. The first woman to read a paper was [[Emily Elizabeth Constance Jones]], who spoke about [[James Ward (psychologist)|James Ward]]'s ''Naturalism and Agnosticism'' on 1 December 1899 in McTaggart's rooms. Sidgwick was in the chair, which Jack Pitt writes was significant, because he had been at the forefront of the campaign to admit women to the university, and his wife, [[Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick|Eleanor Mildred Balfour]], had become president of [[Newnham College]], another women's college, in 1892.&lt;ref name=Pittwomen&gt;Pitt, Jack. [http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1617&amp;context=russelljournal "Russell and the Cambridge Moral Sciences Club"], "Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies: Vol. 1, issue 2, article 3, winter 1982, appendix. p. 116ff. For a timeline about women in Cambridge, see [http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/factsheets/women2.html "Fact sheet: Women at Cambridge: A Chronology"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114162700/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/factsheets/women2.html# |date=2012-01-14 }}, University of Cambridge, 2010, accessed 1 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, the club minutes make clear that women were still not fully accepted: "after the lady visitors departed the following were elected members of the Club," and no women were among those listed. There were five women members from Newnham in 1908 and in 1912 six from Newnham and five from Girton. Miss [[Dorothy Wrinch]] read a paper on 7 December 1917 about "Mr Russell's Theory of Judgment," which Pitt writes was probably the same paper she had published in ''Mind'' in 1919 as ''On the Nature of Judgment''.&lt;ref&gt;Wrinch, Dorothy. "On the Nature of Judgment," ''Mind'', 28 (1919): 319&amp;ndash;329.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1926, there were woman officers, including [[Elsie Whetnall]], the club secretary, and later [[G.E.M. Anscombe|G.E.M. (Elizabeth) Anscombe]], who continued to speak to the club until at least the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Pittwomen/&gt;

==Wittgenstein==
{{main|Wittgenstein's Poker: The Story of a Ten-Minute Argument Between Two Great Philosophers}}
[[File:Wittgenstein1920.jpg|thumb|200px|Wittgenstein (second from right) in 1920]]
Wittgenstein arrived in Cambridge in 1911 and became a member of the club in 1912, when he suggested that no paper last more than seven minutes, a rule adopted on 15 November 1912, though soon abandoned. He gave his first paper on 29 November that year, called "What is philosophy?", at a meeting in his rooms at Trinity. Fifteen members were present, including G.E. Moore. The minutes record:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr Wittgenstein ... read a paper entitled "What is Philosophy?" The paper lasted only about 4 minutes, thus cutting the previous record established by Mr Tye by nearly two minutes. Philosophy was defined as all those primitive propositions which are assumed as true without proof by the various sciences. This defn. was much discussed but there was no general disposition to adopt it. The discussion was kept very well to the point, and the Chairman did not find it necessary to intervene much.&lt;ref name=Klagge332&gt;Klagge, James Carl and Nordmann, Alfred (eds.) ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: Public and Private Occasions''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003, p. 332, citing Michael Nedo and Michele Ranchetti (eds.). ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: sein Leben in Bildern und Texten''. Suhrkamp, 1983, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Moral Sciences Club minutes, dated Oct 26, 1946.JPG|left|thumb|160px|Minutes of the poker-waving meeting]]

He left Cambridge in 1913, but returned in January 1929 and started attended meetings again, but he was an intense man and was accused of dominating discussion, which led him to break off his relationship with the club for a few years in 1931. Another member, Fania Pascal, wrote that he was the disturbing centre of the evenings. "He would talk for long periods without interruption, using similes and allegories, stalking about the room and gesticulating. He cast a spell."&lt;ref&gt;Klagge, James Carl and Nordmann, Alfred (eds.) ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: Public and Private Occasions''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003, pp. 333&amp;ndash;334, citing Pascal's recollections in Rush Rhees. ''Recollections of Wittgenstein''. Oxford University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

His dominance of the Moral Sciences Club reached its height in October 1946 during a meeting that is now legendary among philosophers. It was on 25 October in [[R. B. Braithwaite|Richard Braithwaite]]'s rooms in the Gibbs building at [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]] (room three on the first floor of staircase H). A confrontation arose between Wittgenstein, who was chairing the meeting, and the evening's guest speaker, [[Karl Popper]], Reader in Logic and Scientific Method at the [[London School of Economics]]. The meeting had been organized by Wasfi Hijab, the club secretary, and was attended by 30 philosophers&amp;mdash;dons and students&amp;mdash;including [[Peter Geach]], Peter Gray-Lucas, [[Georg Kreisel]], [[Peter Munz]], Stephen Plaister, [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Stephen Toulmin]], [[John Vinelott]], and Michael Wolff. It was reportedly the only time Popper, Russell, and Wittgenstein&amp;mdash;three of the world's most eminent philosophers&amp;mdash;were ever together.&lt;ref name=Eidinow/&gt;

Popper was reading "Are there philosophical problems?" and an argument broke out about the nature of philosophy: whether philosophical problems were real, which was Popper's position, or just linguistic puzzles, which was Wittgenstein's. The pair almost came to blows, with Wittgenstein pointing Braithwaite's reportedly red-hot [[Fire iron|poker]] at Popper, demanding that he give an example of a moral rule. Popper offered one: "Not to threaten visiting speakers with pokers," at which point Wittgenstein stormed out in a huff.&lt;ref name=Eidinow&gt;Eidinow, John and Edmonds, David.

{{quote box|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|width=90%|align=center|salign=right
|quote=Second meeting Oct 26th, 1946

:::Dr K.R. Popper, Methods in Philosophy
:::In Mr. Braithwaite's Rooms at King's

In the first part of his paper Dr Popper explained how he chose this topic as a consequence of his astonishment and surprise at the Secretary's letter of invitation*, which made use of such expressions as "a short paper," "open a discussion," "state a philosophical puzzle" etc, which reflected a different view from his own as to what philosophy is. He went on to describe this philosophy and its origins, giving it the label "Linguistic Philosophy" (Wittgenstein and his "school"). He considers the advent of this school an epoch in philosophy, but he would criticize it very strongly on several points. Thus while it occupies itself with "preliminaries" it claims exclusiveness to the title of "philosophy" and never goes beyond these "preliminaries" to the more important problems of philosophy. After all, one knows what he means by his philosophical question and the important thing is to provide the "true answer" for it. It also cultivates "esotericism."

In discussion, however, it turned out that to give an example of the "beyond the preliminaries" problem is a difficult task which calls for both labour and time. The examples which Dr Popper eventually suggested seemed to some of the audience to be no more than problems in pure maths or Sociology. The meeting was charged to an unusual degree with a spirit of controversy.

Prof. Wittgenstein was in the chair.

&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;It is the Club's form of invitation.  Wasfi Hijab, Secretary

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5044">'''Cebes of Thebes''' ({{lang-el|Κέβης Θηβαῖος}}, ''gen''.: Κέβητος; ''c''. 430 – 350 BCE&lt;ref name="nails"&gt;[[Debra Nails]], (2002), ''The people of Plato: a prosopography of Plato and other Socratics'', page 82.&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher from [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] remembered as a disciple of [[Socrates]]. One work, known as the ''Pinax'' (Πίναξ) or ''Tabula'', attributed to Cebes still survives, but it is believed to be a composition by a pseudonymous author of the 1st or 2nd century CE.

==Life==
Cebes was a disciple of Socrates and [[Philolaus]], and a friend of [[Simmias of Thebes]]. He is one of the speakers in the ''[[Phaedo]]'' of [[Plato]], in which he is represented as an earnest seeker after virtue and truth, keen in argument and cautious in decision. [[Xenophon]] says he was a member of Socrates' inner circle, and a frequent visitor to the [[hetaera]], Theodote, in [[Classical Athens|Athens]].&lt;ref name="nails"/&gt;  He is also mentioned by Plato in the ''[[Crito]]'' and ''[[Epistles (Plato)|Epistle]]'' ''[[Epistles (Plato)#Thirteenth Letter|XIII]]''.

Three dialogues, the ''Hebdome'', the ''Phrynichus'', and the ''Pinax'' or ''Tabula'', are attributed to him by the ''[[Suda]]'' and [[Diogenes Laërtius]]. The two former are lost, and most scholars deny the authenticity of the ''Tabula'' on the ground of material and verbal anachronisms.&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Cebes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Tablet of Cebes''==
[[File:Title Page with the Tabula Cebetis, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|Title page with the Tablet of Cebes, by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], 1521. Metalcut by [[Jacob Faber]].]]

The ''Tablet of Cebes'' is probably by a pseudonymous author of the 1st or 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;"The date of the ''Pinax'' is uncertain. The [[Teubner]] editor gives reason for thinking that it is later than [[Dio Chrysostom]], and as we know it to be earlier than [[Lucian]] the first half of the second century seems the best conjecture." Donald R. Dudley, ''A History of Cynicism - From [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] to the 6th Century A.D.'', page 198&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A philosopher called '''Cebes of Cyzicus''' is mentioned by [[Athenaeus]] (iv. 156 D) in a fictional ''Banquet of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]]'', but there is no evidence that Cebes of Cyzicus was a real person. Cf. Bracht Branham, Marie-Odile Goulet-Cazé, (2000), ''The Cynics: The Cynic Movement in Antiquity and Its Legacy''. page 411&lt;/ref&gt;  The work professes to be an interpretation of an allegorical picture of a tablet on which the whole of human life with its dangers and temptations was symbolically represented, and which is said to have been dedicated by someone in the temple of [[Cronus]] at Athens or Thebes.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{SmithDGRBM|title = Cebes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author introduces some youths contemplating the tablet, and an old man who steps among them undertakes to explain its meaning.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; It is intended to show that only the proper development of our mind and the possession of real virtues can make us truly happy.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; The author develops the [[Platonism|Platonic]] theory of [[pre-existence]], and shows that true education consists not in mere erudition, but rather in the formation of character.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; Parallels are often drawn between this work and [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

The ''Tabula'' has been widely translated both into [[Europe]]an languages and into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (the latter version published with the [[Greek language|Greek]] text and [[Latin language|Latin]] translation by [[Claudius Salmasius]] in 1640). It has often been printed together with the ''[[Enchiridion of Epictetus]]''. Separate editions have been issued by CS Jerram (with introduction and notes, 1878), [[Karl Praechter]] (1893), and many others.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Eduard Zeller]]'s ''History of Greek Philosophy''; F Klopfer, ''De Cebetis Tabula'' (1818–1822); C Prachter, ''Cebetis Tabula quanam aetate conscripta esse videatur'' (1885).&lt;/ref&gt; An English translation and commentary by John T. Fitzgerald and L. Michael White was published in 1983.

'''''Cligès''''' is a poem by the [[medieval]] [[France|French]] poet [[Chrétien de Troyes]], dating from around 1176. It is the second of his five Arthurian romances; ''[[Erec and Enide]]'', ''Cligès'', ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion|Yvain]]'', ''[[Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart|Lancelot]]'' and ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail|Perceval]]''. The poem tells the story of the knight Cligès and his love for his uncle's wife, Fenice. 

==Background==
''Cligès'' has come down to us through seven manuscripts and various fragments. The poem comprises 6,664 [[octosyllable]]s in [[rhyme]]d [[couplet]]s. A 15th century prose version also exists. The first modern edition of ''Cligès'' was in 1884 by Wendelin Foerster.

There are many stylistic techniques that set Chrétien de Troyes and his work ''Cligès'' apart from his contemporaries and their work. Chrétien used many Latin writing techniques such as nature ''topos'', ''portraiture'', ''conjointure'', ''amplificato'' and ''interpretatio'' to convey a realistic romance story.

''Cligès'' can be better understood by dividing the text into two parts, or two nearly separate stories. The first story consists of Cligès's father's adventures and the second story consists of Cligès's adventures. ''Cligès'' scholar Z.P. Zaddy supports the dual story approach, but also divides the text even further. Zaddy creates a new structure where the two stories are divided into 8 episodes. This approach is intended to make the text read more dramatically.

==Synopsis==
''Cligès'' begins with the story of the title character's parents, Alexander and Soredamors. Alexander, the son of the Greek emperor (also called Alexander), travels to Britain to become a knight in [[King Arthur]]'s realm. While at court, Alexander gains favor with King Arthur, is knighted, and assists in retaking [[Windsor Castle]] when it is taken by the traitor, Count Angrès. During his time at court, Alexander meets Arthur's niece, Soredamors and falls in love but is unable to express his feelings to her. She feels the same, but neither party is able to tell the other how they feel. Queen [[Guinevere]] takes notice and encourages them to express their mutual love. They immediately marry and a child is born. This child is Cligès.

Alexander and his family then return to Greece and find out that Alexander's brother, Alis, has claimed the throne to Greece since their father has died. Although Alexander is the rightful heir to the throne, he concedes to Alis with the condition that Alis will not marry or have children so that the throne will pass to Cligès. Alexander dies and Cligès is raised in Greece. 

Many years after Alexander's death, Alis is persuaded to marry and he chooses the daughter of the German Emperor, Fenice. Thus begins the story of Cligès and Fenice. Cligès falls in love with his uncle Alis' wife. She also loves Cligès but he follows in his father's footsteps to Arthur's kingdom to be knighted. Like his father, he does well in King Arthur's court, participating in tournaments and displaying courtly manners. He is knighted and returns home. 

Cligès and Fenice still love each other and Fenice concocts a plan to use magic to trick Alis to escape. Using the magic of her governess, she fakes her death so that she and Cligès can runaway together. They succeed and hide in a tower but are found by Bertrand, who tells Alis; Cligès goes to Arthur to ask for help in getting his kingdom back from his uncle, but Alis dies while he is away. Cligès and Fenice are free to marry and Cligès is now emperor.

==Analysis==
In ''Cligès and Courtliness'', [[Norris J. Lacy]] examines the characters found in Cligès and argues that Chrètien uses the story as an ironic presentation of chivalric character. Although Cligès displays the ability to master the social forms and rhetoric of the court, it is without substance. Lacy claims that the actions of Cligès and Fenice may seem to represent courtliness or chivalric traits, but at their core they are not moral. Lacy believes that Chrètien's ''Cligès'' is meant to throw doubt on the value and validity of courtliness.

''Cligès'' scholar Lucie Polak verifies the ''[[Tristan and Isolde]]'' reworking found in the text, but also suggests that Cligès may be modeled after Ovid's character Narcissus. ''Cligès'' opening lines give some of the only extant information on the creator's biography and earlier work.

==Other appearances==
Another version of the romance is knownn from a few fragments of a German version. 

In the 15th century, an unknown Burgundian author created a prose version of Chrétien's ''Cligés'', under the title ''Le Livre de Alixandre Empereur de Constentinoble et de Cligés Son Filz''. This prose version differs from the original in several aspects, and the story is thought to have been adapted to the cultural and political circumstances of the Burgundian court at the time.

The character Cligès himself appears in other stories.

'''Depiction''' is reference conveyed through pictures. Basically a picture refers to its object through a non-linguistic two-dimensional scheme. A picture is not writing or notation. A depictive two-dimensional scheme is called a [[picture plane]] and may be constructed according to [[descriptive geometry]] where they are usually divided between ''projections'' (orthogonal and various oblique angles) and ''perspectives'' (according to number of vanishing points). Pictures are made with various materials and techniques, such as painting, drawing, or prints (including photography and movies) mosaics, tapestries, stained glass, and collages of unusual and disparate elements. Occasionally, picture-like features may be recognised in simple inkblots, accidental stains, peculiar clouds or a glimpse of the moon, but these are special cases, and it is controversial whether they count as genuine instances of depiction.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Robert Hopkins (1998), "Picture, Image, Experience" (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, sculpture and theatrical performances are sometimes said to depict, but this requires a broad understanding of 'depict', as simply designating a form of representation that is not linguistic or notational. The bulk of studies of depiction however deal only with pictures. While sculpture and performance clearly represent or refer, they do not strictly picture their objects. 
 
Objects pictured may be factual or fictional, literal or metaphorical, realistic or idealised and in various combination. Idealised depiction is also termed schematic or stylised and extends to icons, diagrams and maps. Classes or styles of picture may abstract their objects by degrees, conversely, establish degrees of the concrete (usually called, a little confusingly, figuration or figurative, since the 'figurative' is then often quite literal). Stylisation can lead to the fully abstract picture, where reference is only to conditions for a picture plane – a severe exercise in self-reference and ultimately a sub-set of pattern.

But just ''how'' pictures function remains controversial. Philosophers, art historians and critics, perceptual psychologists and other researchers in the arts and social sciences have contributed to the debate and many of the most influential contributions have been interdisciplinary. Some key positions are briefly surveyed below.

== Resemblance ==

Traditionally, depiction is distinguished from denotative meaning by the presence of a [[mimesis|mimetic]] element or resemblance. A picture resembles its object in a way a word or sound does not. Resemblance is no guarantee of depiction, obviously. Two pens may resemble one another but do not therefore depict each other. To say a picture resembles its object especially is only to say that its object is that which it especially resembles; which strictly begins with the picture itself. Indeed, since everything resembles something in some way, mere resemblance as a distinguishing trait is trivial. Moreover, depiction is no guarantee of resemblance to an object. A picture of a dragon does not resemble an actual dragon. So resemblance is not enough.

Theories have tried either to set further conditions to the kind of resemblance necessary, or sought ways in which a notational system might allow such resemblance. It is widely believed that the problem with a resemblance theory of depiction is that resemblance is a symmetrical relation between terms (necessarily, if x resembles y, then y resembles x) while in contrast depiction is at best a non-symmetrical relation (it is not necessary that, if x depicts y, y depicts x). If this is right, then depiction and resemblance cannot be identified, and a resemblance theory of depiction is forced to offer a more complicated explanation, for example by relying on experienced resemblance instead, which clearly is an asymmetrical notion (that you experience x as resembling y does not mean you also experience y as resembling x).&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Hopkins (1998), Christopher Peacocke (1987) 'Depiction', in Philosophical Review 96(3):383-410.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued, however, that the concept of resemblance is not exclusively a relational notion, and so that the initial problem is merely apparent.&lt;ref&gt;John Hyman (2012), 'Depiction', in Royal Institute of Philosophy Supplement 71:129-150.&lt;/ref&gt;

In art history, the history of actual attempts to achieve resemblance in depictions is usually covered under the terms "[[realism (arts)|realism]]", [[Naturalism (visual art)|naturalism]]", or "[[illusionism]]".

== Illusion ==

The most famous and elaborate case for resemblance modified by reference, is made by art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1960) ''Art and Illusion'' (Oxford: Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1963) Meditations on a Hobbyhorse (Oxford, Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. ''The Image and the Eye'' (Oxford and New York: Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Resemblance in pictures is taken to involve illusion. Instincts in [[visual perception]] are said to be triggered or alerted by pictures, even when we are rarely deceived. The eye supposedly cannot resist finding resemblances that accord with illusion. Resemblance is thus narrowed to something like the seeds of illusion. Against the one-way relation of reference Gombrich argues for a weaker or labile relation, inherited from [[:wikt:substitution|substitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1960): pp 80-98, (1982): pp 278–297.&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures are thus both more primitive and powerful than stricter reference.

But whether a picture can deceive a little while it represents as much seems gravely compromised. Claims for innate dispositions in sight are also contested. Gombrich appeals to an array of psychological research from [[James J. Gibson]], R. L. Gregory, John M. Kennedy, Konrad Lorenz, Ulric Neisser and others in arguing for an 'optical' basis to perspective, in particular (see also [[perspective (graphical)]]. Subsequent cross-cultural studies in depictive competence and related studies in child-development and vision impairment are inconclusive at best.

Gombrich's convictions have important implications for his popular history of art,&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1995), The Story Of Art 16th ed. (London: Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt; for treatment and priorities there. In a later study by John Willats (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Willats, John, (1997), ''Art and Representation: New Principles In The Analysis Of Pictures'' (Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press.)&lt;/ref&gt; on the variety and development of picture planes, Gombrich's views on the greater realism of perspective underpin many crucial findings.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (1995), pp. 133, 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dual invariants ==

A more frankly behaviouristic view is taken by the perceptual psychologist [[James J. Gibson]],&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, James J., 'The Ecological approach to Visual Perception in Pictures' Leonardo, 1978, 11, p.231.&lt;/ref&gt; partly in response to Gombrich. Gibson treats visual perception as the eye registering necessary information for behaviour in a given environment. The information is filtered from light rays that meet the retina. The light is called the stimulus energy or sensation. The information consists of underlying patterns or 'invariants' for vital features to the environment.

Gibson's view of depiction concerns the re-presentation of these invariants. In the case of illusions or trompe l'oeil, the picture also conveys the stimulus energy, but generally the experience is of perceiving two sets of invariants, one for the picture surface, another for the object pictured. He pointedly rejects any seeds of illusion or substitution and allows that a picture represents when two sets of invariants are displayed. But invariants tell us little more than that the resemblance is visible, dual invariants only that the terms of reference are the same as those for resemblance

== Seeing-in ==

A similar duality is proposed by the philosopher of art [[Richard Wollheim]]. He calls it 'twofoldness'.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim, Richard (1987), ''Painting as an Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson) pp 46-7, 72-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Our experience of the picture surface is called the 'configurational' aspect, and our experience of the object depicted the 'recognitional'. Wollheim's main claim is that we are simultaneously aware of both the surface and the depicted object. The concept of twofoldness has been very influential in contemporary analytic aesthetics, especially in the writings of [[Dominic Lopes]]&lt;ref&gt;Lopes, Dominic (2005), Sight and Sensibility: Evaluating Pictures (Oxford: Clarendon Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Bence Nanay]].&lt;ref&gt;Nanay, Bence (2005), 'Is Twofoldness Necessary for Representational Seeing?', British Journal of Aesthetics 45(3): 263-272.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, illusion is forestalled by the prominence of the picture surface where an object is depicted. Yet the object depicted quite simply ''is'' the picture surface under one reading, the surface indifferent to picture, another. The two are hardly compatible or simultaneous. Nor do they ensure a reference relation.

Wollheim introduces the concept of 'seeing-in' to qualify depictive resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim (1987), pp. 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing-in is a psychological disposition to detect a resemblance between certain surfaces, such as inkblots or accidental stains, etc. and three-dimensional objects. The eye is not deceived, but finds or projects some resemblance to the surface. This is not quite depiction, since the resemblance is only incidental to the surface. The surface does not strictly refer to such objects. Seeing-in is a necessary condition to depiction, and sufficient when in accordance with the maker's intentions, where these are clear from certain features to a picture. But seeing-in cannot really say in what way such surfaces resemble objects either, only specify where they perhaps first occur.

Wollheim's account of how a resemblance is agreed or modified, whereby maker and user anticipate each other's roles, does not really explain how a resemblance refers, but rather when an agreed resemblance obtains.

== Other psychological resources ==

The appeal to broader psychological factors in qualifying depictive resemblance is echoed in the theories of philosophers such as Robert Hopkins,&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Robert (1998), Picture, Image, and Experience (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Flint Schier&lt;ref&gt;Schier, Flint (1986), Deeper Into Pictures (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kendall Walton]].&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall (1990), Mimesis as Make-believe (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; They enlist 'experience', 'recognition' and 'imagination' respectively. Each provides additional factors to an understanding or interpretation of pictorial reference, although none can explain how a picture resembles an object (if indeed it does), nor how this resemblance is then also a reference.

For example, Schier returns to the contrast with language to try to identify a crucial difference in depictive competence. Understanding a pictorial style does not depend upon learning a vocabulary and syntax. Once grasped, a style allows the recognition of any object known to the user. Of course recognition allows a great deal more than that – books teaching children to read often introduce them to many exotic creatures such as a kangaroo or armadillo through illustrations. Many fictions and caricatures are promptly recognised without prior acquaintance of either a particular style or the object in question.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Stephanie (1971), 'Caricature', The Monist 58: pp 285-93.&lt;/ref&gt; So competence cannot rely on a simple index or synonymy for objects and styles.

Schier's conclusion that lack of syntax and semantics in reference then qualifies as depiction, leaves dance, architecture, animation, sculpture and music all sharing the same mode of reference. This perhaps points as much to limitations in a linguistic model.

== Notation ==
Reversing orthodoxy, the philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]]&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Nelson (1968), Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols (Indianapolis and New York: The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Inc.).&lt;/ref&gt; starts from reference and attempts to assimilate resemblance. He denies resemblance as either necessary or sufficient condition for depiction but surprisingly, allows that it arises and fluctuates as a matter of usage or familiarity.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (1968), pp. 16-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Goodman, a picture denotes. Denotation is divided between description, covering writing and extending to more discursive notation including music and dance scores, to depiction at greatest remove. However, a word does not grow to resemble its object, no matter how familiar or preferred. To explain how a pictorial notation does, Goodman proposes an analogue system, consisting of undifferentiated characters, a density of syntax and semantics and relative repleteness of syntax. These requirements taken in combination mean that a one-way reference running from picture to object encounters a problem. If its semantics is undifferentiated, then the relation flows back from object to picture. Depiction can acquire resemblance but must surrender reference. This is a point tacitly acknowledged by Goodman, conceding firstly that density is the antithesis of notation&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (1968), p.&amp;nbsp;160.&lt;/ref&gt; and later that lack of differentiation may actually permit resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Nelson and Elgin, Catherine Z, (1988) Reconceptions in Philosophy (London and New York: Routledge) p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; A denotation without notation lacks sense.

Nevertheless, Goodman's framework is revisited by philosopher John Kulvicki&lt;ref&gt;Kulvicki, John (2006), On Images: Their structure and content (Oxford: Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and applied by art historian James Elkins&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James (1999), The Domain of Images (Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; to an array of hybrid artefacts, combining picture, pattern and notation.

== Pictorial semiotics ==

Pictorial [[semiotics]] aims for just the kind of integration of depiction with notation undertaken by Goodman, but fails to identify his requirements for syntax and semantics. It seeks to apply the model of structural linguistics, to reveal core meanings and permutations for pictures of all kinds, but stalls in identifying constituent elements of reference, or as semioticians prefer, 'signification'. Similarly, they accept resemblance although call it 'iconicity' (after [[Charles Sanders Peirce]],&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, Charles Sanders - (1931-58), Collected Papers I-VIII. Hartshorne, C, Weiss, P, &amp; Burks, A, (eds.) (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; 1931–58) and are uncomfortable in qualifying its role. Older practitioners, such as [[Roland Barthes]]&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, Roland (1969), Elements of semiology (Paris, 1967) translated by Annette Lavers and Colin Smith, (London: Cape).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Umberto Eco]]&lt;ref&gt;Eco, Umberto (1980), A Theory of Semiotics (Milan 1976) (Bloomington: Indiana University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; variously shift analysis to underlying 'connotations' for an object depicted or concentrate on description of purported content at the expense of more medium-specific meaning. Essentially they establish a more general [[iconography]].

A later adherent, Göran Sonesson,&lt;ref&gt;Sonesson, Göran (1989), Pictorial Concepts: Inquiries into the semiotic heritage and its relevance for the analysis of the visual world. (Lund: Aris/Lund University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sonesson, Göran (2001), 'Iconicity strikes back: the third generation – or why Eco is still wrong'. VISIO 9: 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; rejects Goodman's terms for syntax and semantics as alien to linguistics, no more than an ideal and turns instead to the findings of perceptual psychologists, such as J. M. Kennedy,&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, John M. (1974) The Psychology of Picture Perception (San Francisco, Jossey-Bass).&lt;/ref&gt; N. H. Freeman&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, N. H. and Cox, M. V. (eds.) (1985), Visual Order: The Nature and Development of Pictorial Representation (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, N. H., Evans, D., and Willats, J. (1988) Symposium overview: the computational approach to projection drawing-systems. (Budapest, Paper given at Third European Conference on Developmental Psychology).&lt;/ref&gt; and David Marr&lt;ref&gt;Marr, David (1977), 'Analysis of occluding outline', Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B 197 441-475.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marr, David (1978), 'Representing visual information: a computational approach.' in Computer Vision, A. R. Hanson and E. M. Riseman (eds.) Academic Press, New York and London, pp. 61-80.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to detect underlying structure. Sonesson accepts 'seeing-in',&lt;ref&gt;Sonesson, Göran (Revised August 2006), 'Current issues in pictorial semiotics. Lecture three: From the Critique of the Iconicity Critique to Pictorality' . Third conference of a series published online at the Semiotics Institute Online. January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; although prefers Edmund Husserl's version.&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund (1928), Zur Phänomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins. Halle. (Republished in Husserliana X, The Hague: Nijhoff, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund (1980), Phantasie, Bildbewusstsein, Erinnerung, Husserliana XXIII. (The Hague: Nijhoff).&lt;/ref&gt; Resemblance is again grounded in optics or the visible, although this does not exclude writing nor reconcile resemblance with reference. Discussion tends to be restricted to the function of outlines in schemes for depth.

==Deixis==
The art historian [[Norman Bryson]]&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, Norman (1983) Vision and Painting: The Logic of The Gaz, (New Haven and London: Yale University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; persists with a linguistic model and advances a detail of parsing and tense, '[[deixis]]'. He rejects resemblance and illusion as incompatible with the ambiguities and interpretation available to pictures and is also critical of the inflexible nature of structuralist analysis. Deixis is taken as the rhetoric of the narrator, indicating the presence of the speaker in a discourse, a bodily or physical aspect as well as an explicit temporal dimension. In depiction this translates as a difference between 'The [[Gaze]]' where deixis is absent and 'The Glance' where it is present. Where present, details to materials indicate how long and in what way the depiction was made, where absent, a telling suppression or prolonging of the act. The distinction attempts to account for the 'plastic' or medium-specific qualities absent from earlier semiotic analyses and somewhat approximates the 'indexic' aspect to [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#Icon, index, symbol|signs introduced by Peirce]].

Deixis offers a more elaborate account of the picture surface and broad differences to expression and application but cannot qualify resemblance.

==Iconography==
Lastly, iconography is the study of pictorial content, mainly in art, and would seem to ignore the question of how to concentrate upon what. But iconography's findings take a rather recondite view of content, are often based on subtle literary, historical and cultural allusion and highlight a sharp difference in terms of resemblance, optical accuracy or intuitive illusion. Resemblance is hardly direct or spontaneous for the iconographer, reference rarely to the literal or singular. Visual perception here is subject to reflection and research, the object as much reference as referent.

The distinguished art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]]&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, Erwin (1955) Meaning in the Visual Arts (New York: Doubleday).&lt;/ref&gt; allowed three levels to iconography. The first is 'natural' content, the object recognised or resembling without context, on a second level, a modifying historical and cultural context and at a third, deeper level, a fundamental structure or ideology (called iconology). He even ascribed the use of perspective a deep social meaning (1927). However more recently, a natural or neutral level tends to be abandoned as mythical. The cultural scholar [[W. J. T. Mitchell]]&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, W. J. T. (1980), The Language of Images (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, W. J. T. (1986), Iconology: Image, Text, Ideology, (Chicago and London: University Of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, W. J. T. (1994), Picture Theory (Chicago and London: University Of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt; looks to ideology to determine resemblance and depiction as acknowledgement of shifts in relations there, albeit by an unspecified scheme or notation.

Iconography points to differences in scope for a theory of depiction. Where stylistics and a basic object is nominated, resemblance is prominent, but where more elaborate objects are encountered, or terms for nature denied, simple perception or notation flounder. The difference corresponds somewhat to the division in philosophy between the analytic and continental.

==Other issues==
Dozens of factors influence depictions and how they are represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomson|first=T. J.|last2=Greenwood|first2=Keith|date=2016-03-08|title=Beyond Framing|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17512786.2016.1152908|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/17512786.2016.1152908|issn=1751-2786}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the equipment used to create the depiction, the creator’s intent, vantage point, mobility, proximity, publication format, among others, and, when dealing with human subjects, their potential desire for impression management.

Other debates about the nature of depiction include the relationship between seeing something in a picture and seeing face to face, whether depictive representation is [[Convention (norm)|conventional]], how understanding novel depictions is possible, the [[aesthetic]] and [[ethical]] value of depiction and the nature of [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] in pictorial [[art]].

==Biography==
Dmitry Galkovsky was born in Moscow in a working-class family, his father being an engineer, and his mother a tailor. Both his parents were originated from the families of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] clerics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anticompromat.ru/galkovsky/galkovskbio.html Антикомпромат.Ру. Галковский Дмитрий&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129145928/http://www.anticompromat.ru/galkovsky/galkovskbio.html |date=January 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from school No. 51 in Moscow in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://galkovsky.livejournal.com/108678.html?thread=15103878#t15103878 galkovsky: 422. НЕКОТОРЫЕ ДОПОЛНИТЕЛЬНЫЕ СВЕДЕНИЯ О ЖИЗНИ И ДЕЯТЕЛЬНОСТИ ДМИТРИЯ ГАЛКОВСКОГО&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between school and university he has tried a job of a worker at [[Zavod Imeni Likhacheva|the Likhachev Automotive Factory]] between 1977 and 1980. In 1980 he has also briefly employed as a lab assistant at [[Soviet military academies#Malinovsky Military Academy of Armored Forces|Malinovsky Military Academy of Armored Forces]].
Galkovsky graduated from [[Moscow State University]] in 1986 with the degree in [[philosophy]]. Between 1981 and 1990 he was involved in publishing of [[samizdat]]. In 1985 sculptor Valery Yevdokimov created bronze statue of Dmitry Galkovsky, later exhibited at several art shows.

==Major works==

===The Infinite Deadlock===
(Alternative translations: ''Endless Dead-end'', ''Endless Impasse'')

Galkovsky's first major work was the philosophical novel ''Бесконечный тупик'' (''The Infinite Deadlock''). The work consists of three parts. The first part, completed in 1984 and entitled "The Round World," is a brief analysis of, and homage to, the work of the Russian philosopher [[Vasily Rozanov]]. Rozanov's writings were not published during Soviet rule, and he had become somewhat obscure by the time Galkovsky was writing. "The Round World" argues that Rozanov's work is "very modern and relevant" to Russia in the late 20th century, and that he is "perhaps...the most modern Russian philosopher."

The second part of ''The Infinite Deadlock'', referred to as "The Infinite Deadlock (main text)" in the third edition, is an essay (completed in 1985) that fleshes out many of the arguments made in "The Round World." In this work, Rozanov is placed in the greater context of 19th century [[Russian history]] and [[Russian philosophy|philosophy]]. The essay favorably compares Rozanov to such writers as [[Nikolai Chernyshevsky]] and [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], whom Galkovsky views as "infantile" and "talkative." Galkovsky makes the argument that the [[Russian language]] is inherently highly amorphous, and that Russian culture is better adapted to faith (which is associated with "silence") than to reason ("logos" or "speech"). In this interpretation, the fragmented nature of Rozanov's later writing is the ideal expression of the Russian way of thinking.

The third part of ''The Infinite Deadlock'' is called "Comments on 'The Infinite Deadlock'" and consists of 949 "comments" (fragments of text anywhere from one sentence to several pages long). Each "comment" is addressed to a single phrase, either from the "main text" in the second part, or from an earlier comment. Thus, the comments have a [[tree structure]], with one main branch commenting on the "main text," and other smaller branches taking off from comments in the main branch, forming a [[hypertext]]. The comments constitute the vast majority of the overall text of ''The Infinite Deadlock'' (the third part takes up 1077 out of 1230 pages in the third edition).

The fragmented, episodic nature of the comments resembles Rozanov's style of writing. However, although Rozanov provided the main inspiration for Galkovsky's work, he is only one of many subjects discussed in the third part of ''The Infinite Deadlock''. The main topics covered by the hypertext include the following:

* An attack on the high status of [[Russian literature]] in [[Russian culture]]. Galkovsky believes that the doctrine of "realism" adopted by Russian literature was a false front for a revolutionary agenda. In this interpretation, Russian literature uses a hyper-real appearance to describe things that were not actually common in real life, and often were surreal inventions of the authors. For example, Galkovsky interprets the work of [[Nikolai Gogol]] as the author's own fantastic, irrational expression of the ambiguity of the Russian language, and concludes that Gogol's influence became irreparably harmful when this work was interpreted as a realistic criticism of Russian society. In general, Galkovsky argues against the idea that writers should have political and social influence.
* Historical revisionism of 19th century [[Russian history]] leading up to the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]]. Galkovsky argues that revolutionary movements were patronized, and often directly supervised, by the imperial police. He characterizes the revolutionary movement, starting with the [[Decembrist revolt]], as a series of "double provocations" in which elements of the government deliberately sabotaged the government's own response to revolutionary acts. In his analysis, the revolution had become inevitable by the reign of [[Nicholas II]] due to long-standing treason at every level of the government. Galkovsky cites the pervasiveness of [[Freemasonry]] in Russian society and the influence of [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jews]] in revolutionary movements, but he implies that their success was inspired and funded by European governments for the purpose of destroying the Russian monarchy.
* A discrediting of the character and work of Russian philosopher [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], a key figure in Russian religious philosophy. Galkovsky portrays Solovyov as an opportunist who was largely ignorant of the [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Christian philosophy]] that he attempted to summarize in his work. ''The Infinite Deadlock'' implies that Solovyov's main goal was to create a caricatured form of conservatism that would draw attention away from more "authentic" nationalist thinkers such as Yuri Samarin. Galkovsky expresses similar criticism of [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], whom he views as a 20th-century epigone of Solovyov.
* The nature of the Russian language itself. Galkovsky notes what he considers to be the amorphousness of the Russian language, building on the "silence"/"speech" dichotomy put forth in the "main text." In his view, the ambiguity of language makes it difficult to create an unambiguous depiction of evil in a written work. He gives examples of works from Russian literature that use language to "muffle" psychological or ideological conflicts.
* The author's own feelings of loneliness (Galkovsky refers to himself using his mother's maiden name "Odinokov," meaning "lonely one"), his childhood experiences, and his relationship with his father. These passages form a literary (often lyrical) counterpoint to the denser philosophical passages in the text. However, Galkovsky also implies that his experience is a natural outcome of the historical and literary developments he discusses throughout the novel.

Many other subjects are covered in passing, including the nature and purpose of philosophy, a discussion of [[Platonism]] and [[Aristotelianism]], and an analysis of the characters of [[Anton Chekhov]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]].

====Critical reception====
Parts from ''The Infinite Deadlock'' were published in the USSR in both the "liberal" journal ''[[Novy Mir]]'' and the "nationalist" periodical ''[[Nash Sovremennik]]'' ([https://web.archive.org/web/20071102201824/http://nashsovr.aihs.net/main.php?m=mpage ''Наш Современник'']). It sparked some interest and discussion in the press, though many official critics condemned the novel. The third edition of ''The Infinite Deadlock'' contains a selection of hypothetical critical reactions (written by Galkovsky himself) to the work [http://www.samisdat.com/3/311-943.htm] from across the ideological spectrum.

The novel has not been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waggish.org/2005/03/dmitry_galkovsky_the_infinite_deadlock.html Dmitry Galkovsky: The Infinite Deadlock] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926010632/http://www.waggish.org/2005/03/dmitry_galkovsky_the_infinite_deadlock.html |date=September 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The complicated structure of the hypertext, and Galkovsky's heavy use of conversational idioms, make English translation difficult.

In 1997, Galkovsky was awarded the [[Anti-booker prize]] for ''The Infinite Deadlock'', but he refused the monetary award. He explained his refusal in an essay later published in the collection ''Propaganda''.

To this day, ''The Infinite Deadlock'' is Galkovsky's best-known and most expansive work. However, despite the critical acclaim it has received, it has never been published by any Soviet or post-Soviet organization, and every edition released so far has been self-published by Galkovsky. The first edition was released in 1997, nine years after the novel was completed. The third edition was released in 2007 by a publishing house expressly founded by Galkovsky for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://galkovsky.livejournal.com/116302.html galkovsky: 450.

===Duckspeak===
Galkovsky compiled an anthology of "typical" Soviet poetry, referencing the Orwellian term ''Уткоречь'' (''[[Duckspeak]]'') as a title. It was first published online in 1997 and in print in 2002. In the introduction, Galkovsky argues that earlier anthologies of the Soviet poetry featured a disproportionally large number of [[Silver Age of Russian Poetry|Russian silver age]] poets, whose aesthetic views were largely carried over from pre-revolutionary times, and rejected by the Soviet order. Furthermore, in Galkovsky's opinion, a truly "representative" collection should include the most "typical" poems in a certain category, rather than the "best" ones. Thus, ''Duckspeak'' samples many obscure and provincial Soviet poets in addition to more acclaimed ones.

The poems are categorized by subject. The subjects covered by the anthology include:
* "Love for the Three Mandarins" (poems extolling [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Joseph Stalin]])
* "Kukushkin" (poems about [[Alexander Pushkin]] and [[Russian literature]] in general)
* "Friendship of Nations" (poems extolling the Soviet doctrine of [[proletarian internationalism]])
* "The Soviet Woman" (poems expressing Soviet images of the ideal woman)
* "Enemies" (poems attacking [[capitalism]] and capitalist countries)
The size of each section is intended to mirror the frequency of the section's topic in Soviet poetry.

===Friend of Ducklings===
In 2002, Galkovsky wrote a film script called "Друг Утят" ("Friend of Ducklings"). The screenplay tells a futuristic (both [[utopian]] and [[dystopian]]) story describing a technologically advanced, robotized post-nuclear age. The script was written at the request of film-maker [[Vladimir Menshov]], but has never been adapted. "Friend of Ducklings" was widely reviewed throughout the Russian press; Galkovsky's comments on some of the reviews can be found in ''Magnet''.

===Propaganda and Magnet===
In 2003-2004, Galkovsky published two collections of essays, articles and interviews, entitled ''Пропаганда'' (''Propaganda'') and ''Магнит'' (''Magnet''). These collections include Galkovsky's analysis of [[Philosophy in the Soviet Union|Soviet philosophy]], entitled "Разбитый компас указывает путь" ("The Broken Compass Points The Way"), his explanation for his own refusal of the monetary component of the [[Anti-booker prize]], and other writing. Around this time, many of Galkovsky's short stories (from the series ''Svyatochnye Rasskazy'' and ''Skazki Druga Utyat'') were published in both online and offline media.

===Two Idiots===
In 2009, Galkovsky published another collection of essays entitled ''Два идиота'' (''Two Idiots''). The core of the book consists of articles written by Galkovsky in 2005-2007 for the online newspaper [[Vzglyad (newspaper)|Vzglyad.ru]] and the magazine [[Russkaya Zhizn]]. The title refers to [[Konstantin Rykov]], Russian publisher and editor of Vzglyad, and Dmitry Olshansky, editor of Russkaya Zhizn. The book was published through Galkovsky's own publishing house.

==Journalism==

===Articles and columns===
During the 1990s, Galkovsky decided to boycott post-Soviet media as a result of his inability to publish ''The Infinite Deadlock'', which he believed to be caused by an organized campaign against him. (His account of this campaign was later published in ''Propaganda''.) After that, his interviews and articles began to appear in various publications:
* [[Nezavisimaya Gazeta]] (short stories from the ''Svyatochnye Rasskazy'' and ''Skazki Druga Utyat'' series)

===Galkovsky.Livejournal.com===
In 2003, Galkovsky started a [[Livejournal]] [[blog]], covering wide range of topics in history, culture and politics. His blog has gained recognition in the Russian [[blogosphere]] and regularly appears on various lists of the most popular blogs ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080225204842/http://deep-water.ru/top/info.php?id=73]).

===Ducks' Truth magazine===
Galkovsky has participated in the creation of a website parodying the typical style of [[youth movement]]s in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gudilap.ru/ Главный Сервер Движения Утят]&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the "Ducklings" movement are encouraged to participate in [[Massively multiplayer online game]]s. Between 2005 and 2007, the movement published the online magazine "Утиная Правда" ("Ducks' Truth", a parody of [[Pravda]]), co-founded in 2004 by Galkovsky and Russian [[counterculture]] publisher Konstantin Rykov. The magazine contained many articles on history and politics, written by Galkovsky under his "Friend of Ducklings" pseudonym.

The original website of the magazine has now closed, but the content has been archived by a Galkovsky fansite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galkovsky.com/default.asp?view=uprav&amp;cat1=uprav_cont&amp;fold=0000100000 Утиная правда] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711070416/http://www.galkovsky.com/default.asp?view=uprav&amp;cat1=uprav_cont&amp;fold=0000100000 |date=July 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the magazine was reopened under the name "New Ducks' Truth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upravda2.ru Новая утиная правда]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606132305/http://www.upravda2.ru/ |date=June 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4864">In the [[philosophy of language]], an '''empty name''' is a [[proper names|proper name]] that has no [[sense and reference|referent]].

The '''problem of empty names''' is that empty names have a meaning that it seems they should not have.  The name "[[Pegasus]]" is empty;&lt;ref&gt;[[W. V. O. Quine]], "[[On What There Is]]" ''The Review of Metaphysics'' '''2'''(5), 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; there is nothing to which it refers. Yet, though there is no Pegasus, we know what the sentence "Pegasus has two wings" means.  We can even understand the sentence "There is no such thing as Pegasus."  But, what can the meaning of a proper name be, except the object to which it refers?

==Overview==
There are three broad ways which philosophers have tried to approach this problem.

# The [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] of a proper name is not the same as the object (if there is any) it refers to.  Hence, though "Pegasus" refers to nothing, it still has a meaning.  The German philosopher [[Gottlob Frege]] seems to have held a theory of this sort.  He says that the sentence "Odysseus was set ashore at Ithaca while sound asleep"  obviously has a sense.  ... the thought [expressed by that sentence] remains the same whether "Odysseus" has reference or not." [[Bertrand Russell]] may also have held a similar theory, that a proper name is a disguised [[definite description]] that signifies some unique characteristic.  If any object has this characteristic feature, the name has a referent.  Otherwise it is empty.  Perhaps "[[Aristotle]]" means "the teacher of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]".  Since there was such a person, "Aristotle" refers to that person.  By contrast, "Pegasus" may mean "the winged horse of [[Bellerophon]]".  Since there was no such horse, the name has no referent.  This is the so-called [[theory of descriptions|description theory of names]]. The difficulty with this account is that we may always use a proper name to deny that the individual bearing the name actually has some characteristic feature.  So, we can meaningfully say that Aristotle was not the teacher of Alexander.  But if "Aristotle" ''means'' "teacher of Alexander", it would follow that this assertion is self-contradictory, which it is not. [[Saul Kripke]] proposed this argument in a series of influential papers in the 1970s. Another difficulty is that different people may have different ideas about the defining characteristics of any individual. Yet we all understand what the name means.  The sole information carried by the name seems to be the [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] of the individual that it belongs to.  This information therefore cannot be descriptive, it cannot describe the individual.  As [[John Stuart Mill]] argued, a proper name tells us the identity of its bearer, without telling us anything else about it. Naming is rather like ''pointing''.
# A theory that became influential following Kripke's attack is that empty proper names, have, strictly speaking, no meaning.  This is the so-called [[Direct reference|direct-reference]] theory.  Versions of this theory have been defended by [[Keith Donnellan]], [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]], [[Nathan Salmon]], [[Scott Soames]] and others. The problem with the direct-reference theory is that names appear to be meaningful independently of whether they are empty.  Furthermore, negative existential statements using empty names are both true and apparently meaningful.  How can "Pegasus does not exist" be true if the name "Pegasus", as used in that sentence, has no meaning?
# There are no empty names. All names have a referent. The difficulty with this theory is how to distinguish names like "Pegasus" from names like "Aristotle".  Any coherent account of this distinction seems to require that there are, i.e. there exist, objects that do not exist.  Given that "Pegasus does not exist" is true, it follows that the referent of "Pegasus" does not exist.  Hence there is something&amp;mdash;the referent of "Pegasus"&amp;mdash;that does not exist.
Some philosophers, such as [[Alexius Meinong]] have argued that there are two senses of the verb "exists", exemplified by the sentence "there are things that do not exist".  The first, signified by "there are", is the so-called "wide sense", including Pegasus, the golden mountain, the round square, and so on.  The second, signified by "exist" is the so-called "narrow sense", encompassing only things that are real or existent. The difficulty with this "two sense" theory is that there is no strong evidence that there really are two such distinct senses of the verb "to be".{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===In non-humans===
Although not found in all organisms, researchers have identified sexual intercourse patterns in certain animals that reflect extended female sexuality, such as in some old world primates, birds and insects.&lt;ref name="evolution of mind" /&gt; Extensive research has focused on analysing the [[White-toothed shrew|musk shrew]]'s rate of sexual behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rissman|first1=E.

Both of these primates mate at all stages of the ovarian cycle, with only slight increases in sexual receptivity during [[fertility|fertile stages]], and decreases during [[menstruation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopædia of Sexual Behaviour, Volume 1|author1=Albert Ellis |author2=Albert Abarbanel |publisher=Elsevier|year=2013|isbn=1483225100|location=London|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In humans===
Human females are considered to exhibit the greatest degree of extended female sexuality, with receptivity to sexual intercourse remaining constant across fertile and infertile phases of the reproductive cycle, including during [[pregnancy]], [[lactation]], and in adolescence. In a study of 20,000 women from 13 countries, frequency of copulation was reportedly the same across all stages of the ovarian cycle. The only notable drop in sexual behaviour occurred during [[menstruation]]. Therefore, women largely showed the same level of sexual behaviour in the non-fertile phases of their ovarian cycles as in the fertile phases.&lt;ref name="human oestrus" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brewis|first1=A.|last2=Meyer|first2=M.|title=Demographic evidence that human ovulation is undetectable (at least in pair bonds)|journal=Current Anthropology|date=2005|volume=46|issue=3|pages=465–471|doi=10.1086/430016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have investigated the effect of [[Hormonal contraception|hormonal contraceptive]] use in women on the frequency of sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guida|first1=M.|title=Effects of two types of hormonal contraception--oral versus intravaginal--on the sexual life of women and their partners|journal=Human Reproduction|date=17 December 2004|volume=20|issue=4|pages=1100–1106|doi=10.1093/humrep/deh686|pmid=15608030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these contraceptives mimic a pregnancy state in females by altering hormone levels. Therefore, women who use these contraceptives do not experience the fertile phases of their cycles. In a systematic review, it appeared that the frequency of sexual intercourse was unaffected by contraceptive use in the majority of women. Although artificially created, this adds to the literature documenting the existence of copulation in humans during non-fertile periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burrows|first1=L.

=== Impact of concealed ovulation ===
In order to encourage [[mating]] in non-conceptive periods and to encourage males to maintain their proximity, males must possess imperfect knowledge of the female's [[fertility]] status. This is achieved through [[concealed ovulation]] in most animals that exhibit extended female sexuality.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grebe|first1=N. M.|last2=Gangestad|first2=S.

==Explanations==

=== Male assistance hypothesis ===
Mating outside the fertile window of their [[menstrual cycle|ovarian cycle]] may incur considerable costs for females, such as in time and energy usage. To counteract these costs, the male assistance hypothesis argues that females exhibit extended sexuality to obtain resources from males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fürtbauer|first1=I.|last2=Heistermann|first2=M.|last3=Schülke|first3=O.|last4=Ostner|first4=J.|title=Concealed fertility and extended female sexuality in a non-human primate (Macaca assamensis)|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2011|volume=6|issue=8|pages=e23105|bibcode=2011PLoSO...623105F|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023105|pmid=21853074|pmc=3154278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Higham|first1=J.

====Male provision of non-genetic resources====
Firstly, in species that demonstrate extended female sexuality, there should be evidence that the males provide non-genetic resources to females. This prediction is supported in a variety of animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodrı́guez-Gironés|first1=M. A.|last2=Enquist|first2=M.|title=The evolution of female sexuality|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=2001|volume=61|issue=4|pages=695–704|doi=10.1006/anbe.2000.1630}}&lt;/ref&gt; with reviews revealing that male assistance (such as food or protection), is provided to certain [[mammal]]s and communally breeding birds in exchange for mating outside the conceptive period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stacey|first1=P. B.|title=Female promiscuity and male reproductive success in social birds and mammals.|journal=American Naturalist|date=1982|pages=51–64|doi=10.1086/283969}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, female [[Common blackbird|blackbirds]] that solicit mating outside the fertile period have increased [[Mating|mate guarding]] from their pair-bonded partner. This increases protection against other [[Sexual coercion|sexually coercive]] males and ensures the provision of other material benefits.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wysocki|first=Dariusz|last2=Halupka|first2=Konrad|date=2004-04-01|title=The Frequency and Timing of Courtship and Copulation in Blackbirds, Turdus Merula, Reflect Sperm Competition and Sexual Conflict|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/10.1163/156853904323066766|journal=Behaviour|volume=141|issue=4|pages=501–512|doi=10.1163/156853904323066766|issn=1568-539X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review investigating primates that exhibit extended female sexuality, it was noted that females engaging in extended sexuality benefited from increased offspring protection and paternal care from males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soltis|first=Joseph|date=2002-01-01|title=Do primate females gain nonprocreative benefits by mating with multiple males?

====Enhanced reproductive success====
Secondly, in order to outweigh the aforementioned costs, [[mating]] during infertile phases should increase females' [[reproductive success]] by increasing the number of offspring produced. Current research has only investigated this factor indirectly, and it has predominantly been investigated in insects. For example, when male insects deliver material benefits in exchange for sexual access, the reproductive success of the females increases with the number of matings.&lt;ref name="Thornhill Gangestad" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arnqvist|first1=G.|last2=Nilsson|first2=T.|title=The evolution of polyandry: multiple mating and female fitness in insects|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=2000|volume=60|issue=2|pages=145–164|pmid=10973716|doi=10.1006/anbe.2000.1446}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that the [[mating]] behaviour assessed was not limited to extended female sexuality. Hence, it only provides indirect support for the second prediction.

====Shifting mate preferences and behaviour across the ovarian cycle====
{{See also|Ovulatory shift hypothesis}}

The final prediction of the male-assistance hypothesis has been extensively investigated. It predicts that females will exhibit differing [[mating preferences|mate preferences]] during fertile and non-fertile periods. Specifically, when fertile, the females will be sensitive to indicators of high genetic quality to increase the genetic quality of her [[offspring]].&lt;ref name="human oestrus" /&gt; Conversely, outside of the fertile period, females will show a preference for males who can provide resources for her and her offspring. In most species, males of higher genetic quality offer fewer non-genetic resources (such as shelter and food) than those of lower quality, so females are likely to choose different males at each stage.&lt;ref name="Thornhill Gangestad" /&gt;

Evidence for this prediction has been found in many different species. In [[Chicken|hens]], those near peak fertility show a preference for socially dominant roosters with large [[Comb (anatomy)|combs]]. Larger combs have been reliably associated with health and [[offspring]] survival so reliably indicate the genetic quality of the [[rooster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=T. H.|last2=Ligon|first2=J. D.|title=Female mating preferences in red junglefowl: a meta-analysis.|journal=Ethology, Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=2003|volume=15|issue=1|pages=63–72|doi=10.1080/08927014.2003.9522691}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the non-fertile phases, hens mate more indiscriminately with less regard for the larger comb size. A similar pattern emerges in humans. A review of relevant studies on female preferences across the [[menstrual cycle|ovarian cycle]] reveals that women show a greater preference for [[masculinity|masculine]] traits in fertile phases, especially for [[human mating strategies|short term mating]] intention. This finding occurs across a variety of traits, such as masculine [[human voice|voices]], body and facial features, [[odor|scent]], and [[Display (zoology)#Among humans|behavioural displays]].&lt;ref name="human oestrus"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gangestad|first1=S.

[[File:Big red rooster.jpg|thumb|The image shows a rooster with a comb. The comb concerns the red bit of 'skin' underneath the beak. Author: BazzaDaRambler]]

In addition to impacting [[mating preferences]], females have been found to exhibit differing mating behaviour at different cycle stages. An analysis of 121 studies with female birds showed that most mate outside their [[pair bond]] at a higher rate when fertile, especially when the primary partner possesses indicators of low quality [[gene]]s. During infertile phases, birds showed reductions in this behaviour, suggesting that the function of extended female sexuality is not to increase the genetic quality of offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Akçay|first1=E.|last2=Roughgarden|first2=J.|title=Extra-pair paternity in birds: review of the genetic benefits.|journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research|date=2007|volume=9|issue=5|page=855}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, females show increased motivation for mating with other males at [[menstrual cycle|mid-cycle]] without an accompanying increase in [[sexual intercourse|copulation]] with their long term partner, especially if the partner was less physically attractive.&lt;ref name="human oestrus"/&gt;

===Hrdy's hypothesis===

[[File:Baby ginger monkey.jpg|thumb|An infant lutung (old world primate). Source: flickr.com]]
Hrdy's hypothesis is an extension of the male assistance hypothesis, in that both hypotheses argue that women have evolved this adaptation to gain some tangible benefit from males. According to Hrdy's hypothesis,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson Education"/&gt; extended female sexuality is an [[Adaptation|adaptive]] process with an aim of creating paternity confusion in their male counterparts.&lt;ref name="Thornhill Gangestad" /&gt; Paternity confusion refers to the male being unsure as to whether [[offspring]] are genetically his own. If the female mates with different males (at all points of her [[Menstrual cycle|ovarian cycle]]) whilst concealing [[fertility]], then the males will inevitably have paternity confusion.

Paternity confusion is proposed to be an adaptive function for preventing [[Infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Significance of Male and Female Reproductive Strategies for Male Reproductive Success in Wild Longtailed Macaques (Macaca Fascicularis)|last = Engelhardt|first = Antje|publisher = Cuvillier Verlag|year = 2004|isbn = |location = Göttingen|pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Infanticide by Males and Its Implications|last = Van Schaik|first = Carl|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2000|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = 361}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Primates and Cetaceans: Field Research and Conservation of Complex Mammalian Societies|last = Yamagiwa|first = Juichi|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Tokyo|pages = 387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if the female can successfully create paternity confusion, males will be less likely to kill her offspring, as the lack of paternity certainty means that they run the risk of killing their own genetic [[offspring]]. Additionally, the males, in turn, are likely to protect the same female's offspring from infanticide that may be committed by other adults within the species. Once again, this is because they are uncertain about paternity, and aim to protect infants that are genetically their own.

====Paternity confusion in primates====
Researchers have analysed the behaviour of [[chimpanzee]]s, with particular reference to [[Female copulatory vocalizations|copulation calling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Townsend|first=Simon|date=2008|title=Female chimpanzees use copulation calls flexibly to prevent social competition|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002431|journal=PLOS ONE |volume=3 |issue= 6|pages= e2431.|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002431|pmid=22423311|pmc=3278306|access-date=|bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.2431T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copulation calling is a type of vocalisation used to attract mates. The calls are vocalised either before, during, or after sexual intercourse. Copulation calling, in line with Hrdy's hypothesis, may then be one way to ensure that the female can mate with as many different males as possible, causing paternity confusion. Indeed, the authors found that the probability of copulatory calling in female chimpanzees was not modulated by the ovarian phase of the female caller, thereby aiding paternity confusion. This paternity confusion ultimately ensures that the woman has access to the resources of a number of different males. These resources can be utilised by her, as well as by her offspring.

Criticism of Hrdy's hypothesis emerges from evidence which suggests that male primates can discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Biosocial Foundations of Family Processes|last = Booth|first = Alan|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year = 2010|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buchan|first=J.

They found that males selectively cared for their own offspring, particularly when their offspring became involved in aggressive confrontations which posed the possibility of injuries or a threat to their [[Social status|social standing]]. Evidently, if males can discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others, then there is no purpose in the female attempting to create paternity confusion during the pregnancy stage. This would be counter-intuitive, as, once the offspring is born, the males will know whether the offspring is, or is not, their own. Future research will need to be conducted in this vein to investigate whether males in other species show the ability to discriminate between their own offspring and the offspring of others before coming to any decisive conclusions.

====Concealed estrus as a function of paternity confusion in primates====
Research is fairly consistent in the finding that species with concealed estrus mate at all stages of their ovarian cycle. For instance, mating activity in [[Macaques|assamese macaques]] (''Macaca assamensis'') has been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Furtbauer|first=Ines|date=2011|title=Concealed fertility and extended female sexuality in a non-human primate (macaca assamensis)|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0023105|journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue= 8|pages=  e23105.|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023105|pmid=21853074|pmc=3154278|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers analysed the levels of [[Menstrual cycle|progesterone]] in the monkeys, in order to establish the ovarian stage of the female, as progesterone peaks following the fertile window. They found that the females concealed estrus and were [[Estrous cycle|sexually receptive]] during the entire mating season. Concealed estrus and sexual receptivity (at all times of the ovarian cycle) aids paternity confusion. This is because the males are unsure of who mated with the female during her fertile period, and so do not know the identity of the father.

Hrdy's hypothesis has been criticised, however, on the basis that some female [[primate]]s show both extended female sexuality and [[sexual swelling|sexual swellings.]]&lt;ref name="Thornhill Gangestad" /&gt; In terms of Hrdy's hypothesis these two concepts are incompatible. Sexual swellings appear only during the most fertile phase of the female's ovarian cycle, with the purpose of advertising fertility. In sharp contrast, according to Hrdy, extended sexuality is adapted to [[Concealed ovulation|conceal fertility]] and ensure mating across all stages of the ovarian cycle, to aid paternity confusion.

===Male-driven hypotheses===
One of the alternative explanations is that extended female sexuality is 'male-driven'. This hypothesis is theoretically based on male uncertainty regarding the fertility status of females.&lt;ref name="Thornhill Gangestad" /&gt; Although some [[Menstrual cycle|physiological changes]] occur during the fertile period that may act as reliable indicators (e.g. the concentration of [[Estrogen|oestrogen]] can change female [[Odor|scent]]), most species have not evolved signals advertising fertility (e.g. [[sexual swelling]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pawlowski|first=B|date=1999|title=Loss of oestrus and concealed ovulation in human evolution: the case against the sexual selection hypothesis|url=|journal=Current Anthropology |volume=40 |issue= |pages= 257–275.|doi=10.2307/2991395|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, males will be unable to detect fertility with any precision. As a result, extended female sexuality is proposed as a male [[Sexual selection|sexually selected]] trait. Males will pursue sexual access throughout the entirety of the [[Menstrual cycle|ovarian cycle]] to increase their chances of [[Fertilisation|impregnating]] the female. According to this hypothesis, females lack any benefit from this activity due to their inability to conceive, yet will be [[Coercion|coerced]] by males to engage in [[sexual intercourse]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gangestad | first1 = S.

====The training hypothesis====

[[File:HumanSpermVideoAffordableHomeMicroscope.ogv|thumb|The video shows human sperm under a microscope. Author:StirlingJulian]]
Another hypothesis claiming that extended female sexuality has evolved to benefit males' interests is the 'training hypothesis'. It has been shown that women's [[immune system]]s attack foreign [[antigen]]s found in [[sperm]].&lt;ref name="Thornhill Gangestad" /&gt; This may reduce the likelihood of conception so reduce the [[reproductive success]] for the males. However, prior exposure to sperm antigens can dampen the immune response to increase the chances of successful conception and [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation.]]&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robertson | first1 = S.

Indeed, research has identified findings consistent with this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Couples who had used condoms before trying to conceive were more likely to suffer complications, such as [[pre-eclampsia]], during pregnancy as a result of the woman's immune system having no prior exposure to the antigens in the sperm. In non-humans, an increased frequency of copulation in crickets has been shown to reduce the female's immune response to sperm.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

This hypothesis has received much criticism. For example, as all mammals experience the same immune system responses to sperm antigens, this hypothesis predicts that all mammals should exhibit extended female sexuality. However, only few species of mammals exhibit sexual behaviour outside the conceptive period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introductiom to Behavioural Endocrinology|last=Nelson|first=R. J.|publisher=Sinauer|year=2000|isbn=|location=Sunderland|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spuhler's hypothesis===
Spuhler's hypothesis is a stand-alone hypothesis of extended female sexuality. Spuhler suggests that extended female sexuality has evolved as a by-product of an adaptation in females that increases the levels of [[Adrenal hormone|adrenal]] [[hormone|hormones.]]&lt;ref name="Thornhill Gangestad" /&gt; He proposed that secretion of higher levels of adrenal hormones were initially selected in women in order to increase endurance for walking or running. This hypothesis suggests that the larger [[adrenal gland]]s may have contributed to the development of extended female sexuality as they are also the main source of '[[libido]] hormones', which increase the female's sexual drive.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = J. P. | last2 = Wolfe | first2 = L. D. | year = 1983 | title = Human female sexual cycles and the concealment of ovulation problem | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Biological Structures | volume = 6 | issue = 4| pages = 345–352 | doi=10.1016/s0140-1750(83)90134-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, extended sexuality is little to do with sexual behavior, or evolutionary advantage, but rather it is just a by-product of hormones.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, G. C. (1966). Adaptation and Natural SelectionPrinceton University Press. ''Princeton, NJ''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this hypothesis cannot account for extended female sexuality in invertebrates, which lack adrenal systems.&lt;ref name="Thornhill Gangestad" /&gt; Additionally Spuhler highlighted the existence of larger [[thyroid]] and [[adrenal gland]]s in humans compared to other primates. However, no empirical evidence has established the link between hormones and endurance walking as an adaptation and extended female sexuality as a natural incidental effect. As there are costs to extended sexuality, it can be argued that selection would serve the dissociation of extended sexuality from the mechanism that affects endurance walking.&lt;ref name="Thornhill Gangestad" /&gt;

Magnin was a carpenter. He became a [[positivist]] in 1840, becoming the first proletarian convert. [[Auguste Comte]], the founder of [[positivism]], appointed him to be President of the Positivist Society after his death. Magnin filled this role from 1857 to 1880, when he resigned.&lt;ref name="Pickering"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pickering|first1=Mary|title=Auguste Comte: Volume 3: An Intellectual Biography|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnin also spread workers positivism (le positivisme ouvrier).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1731">'''Friedrich Calker''' (July 4, 1790 – January 5, 1870), German philosopher, was educated in [[Jena]].  For a short time, he was a lecturer in [[Berlin]]. In 1818, he was called to an extraordinary [[professor]]ship in the newly founded [[University of Bonn]], becoming an ordinary professor in 1826. He substantially echoed the ideas of his teacher [[Jakob Fries]]. His two major works are ''Urgesetzlehre des Wahren, Guten und Schönen'' (''The Original Teachings on the Law of the True, Good and Beautiful''; Berlin 1820) und ''Denklehre'' (''Logic''; Bonn 1822).

*[[Carl Schurz]], ''Reminiscences'' (3 volumes), New York: The McClure Company, 1907.  Schurz writes of Calker (although he refers to him as “van Calker” rather than simply “Calker”) in Chapter V where Calker's residence is the target of a students' march to deliver a petition, Calker being the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the University at that point.  The petition proposed the abolishing of the office of “government authority,” (''Regierungsbevollmächtigter'' {{De icon}}) then held by [[August von Bethmann-Hollweg]].  Schurz seemed amused by the timid man who gave a speech regarding the “soaring spirit of German youth.” In the German edition, Schurz remarks that he seemed to find the soaring spirit rather spooky.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6896">'''Geneviève Fraisse''' (born October 1948 in [[Paris]]) is a [[French people|French]] philosopher and an historian of feminist thought.

She was born within ''Murs blancs'' ({{fr icon}} "White walls"), a community founded by [[Emmanuel Mounier]] at [[Châtenay-Malabry]].  Her parents, Paul Fraisse (an author of books of experimental psychology) and Simone Fraisse (an author of books on [[Charles Péguy]], [[Ernest Renan]], and [[Simone Weil]]), were both professors at the Sorbonne.  After May 1968, she helped Jacques Rancière create the journal ''Les Révoltes logiques'' ({{fr icon}} "Logical revolts"). Author of numerous books, her work focuses on the history of the controversy of the sexes from an epistemological and political viewpoint.

Her research led her to postulate concepts on the "domestic", "exclusive democracy," "women of reason", the "two governments", the "mixing of the sexes" and, more recently, "consent". The complexity of the debate on gender led her to work closely with the historians, particularly on the synthesis of the history of women in the West.  Seen as a leader of contemporary thought, her idea of gender equality lies between theory and practice, elaborating concepts from contemporary history.

Geneviève Fraisse has been an interministerial delegate on women's rights from 1997 to 1998 and a Member of European Parliament from 1999 to 2004, as an independent member of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left. She took the initiative of two parliamentary agendas, one on the performing arts, the other on women and sport. Since 2004, Geneviève Fraisse has also been a producer at France Culture (Europe ideas).

Geneviève Fraisse joined the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] (CNRS) in 1983. She helped create the International College of Philosophy (1984). She was Visiting Scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in 1990. A doctor, she has been director of research at CNRS since 1997 and visiting professor at [[Rutgers University]] (USA, 2000–2002). She was also president of the Scientific Committee of the Institut Emilie du Châtelet from 2006 to 2010. From 2011 to 2013, she gave a Master Class at Science-Po Paris, "Pensée des sexes et démocratie", with the program PRESAGE (Programme de Recherche et de Savoir sur le Genre).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19794">The '''Gifford Lectures''' are an annual series of [[lecture]]s which were established by the will of [[Adam Gifford|Adam Lord Gifford]] (died 1887). They were established to "promote and diffuse the study of [[natural theology]] in the widest sense of the term &amp;mdash; in other words, the knowledge of God." A Gifford lectures appointment is one of the most prestigious honors in Scottish academia. The lectures are given at several [[Scotland|Scottish]] universities: [[University of St Andrews]], [[University of Glasgow]], [[University of Aberdeen]] and [[University of Edinburgh]]. They are normally presented as a series over an academic year and given with the intent that the edited content be published in book form. A number of these works have become classics in the fields of [[theology]] or [[philosophy]] and the [[relationship between religion and science]].

Ginga&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telemidia.puc-rio.br/?q=pt-br/node/59&lt;/ref&gt; is also ITU-T Recommendation for IPTV Services. It is also considered in ITU-T recommendations for Cable Broadcast services (ITU-T J.200 Recommendation series: Rec. ITU-T J.200,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-J.200-201004-I!!PDF-E&amp;type=items&lt;/ref&gt; Rec.

ITU-T J.202&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-J.202-201008-I!!PDF-E&amp;type=items&lt;/ref&gt;) and for Terrestrial Broadcast services by ITU-R BT.1889,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bt/R-REC-BT.1889-0-201103-I!!PDF-E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; ITU-R BT.1699&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bt/R-REC-BT.1699-1-200909-I!!PDF-E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and ITU-R BT.1722.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bt/R-REC-BT.1722-2-201103-I!!PDF-E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Ginga was developed based on a set of standardized technologies but mainly on innovations developed by Brazilian researchers. Its current reference implementation was released under the [[GPL]] license.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.softwarepublico.gov.br/&lt;/ref&gt;

Ginga is divided into two main integrated subsystems, which allow the development of applications following two different programming paradigms. Those subsystems are called Ginga-NCL&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telemidia.puc-rio.br/?q=pt-br/node/59&lt;/ref&gt; (for declarative [[Nested Context Language|NCL]] applications) and Ginga-J (for imperative [[Java (programming language)|Java]] applications).

In the case of the Brazilian Terrestrial Digital TV System, and any other Digital TV Systems following the definitions in the [[ABNT]] standards for the Ginga Middleware ABNT 15606,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumsbtvd.org.br/materias.asp?id%3D112 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223011323/http://www.forumsbtvd.org.br/materias.asp?id=112 |archivedate=2012-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ginga-J is required to be supported in fixed receivers and it is optional in portable receivers. For IPTV services following the H.761 ITU-T Recommendation, only the Ginga-NCL subsystem is required, for any terminal type.

==Development==
Ginga was developed by Telemídia Lab from [[Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro]] (PUC-Rio) and by LAViD from Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB).

'''Dom Heliodoro de Paiva''' (fl. [[Coimbra]], 1552) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[composer]], [[philosopher]], and [[theologian]].

== Life ==
Heliodoro de Paiva was born in [[Lisbon]] (date unknown). He studied at the Monastery of Santa Cruz de Coimbra, where he took the holy orders as an [[Augustinian]] regular [[capitulary]]. He was remarkable for the qualities he revealed in a wide variety of subjects: apart from [[musician]] and composer, he was well versed in the [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], and [[Hebraic language|Hebraic]] languages, and he was a good philosopher and theologian. As a musician, he played several instruments with skill and he was an esteemed singer.

== Work ==
Paiva's work can be found in the music manuscripts of the Monastery of Santa Cruz de Coimbra (now kept at the library of the [[University of Coimbra]]). He composed [[mass]]es, [[motet]]s, and [[Magnificat]]s but, as he was excessively humble, he did not sign his works, which makes it more difficult to identify them.

'''Henry Scrimgeour''' or '''Scrymgeour''' (c. 1505 – 23 September 1572) was a [[diplomat]] and book collector.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Dundee]], most likely in 1505, but possibly in 1508 or 1509, since [[Andrew Melville]] gives Scrimgeour's age at death as sixty-three.

Having first attended [[Dundee Grammar School]], he then went to [[St Salvator's College, St Andrews]], in 1532. He determined as a bachelor in 1533, and won first place in the examination for licence the following year. Some time later he proceeded to [[Paris]] where he studied under [[Guillaume Budé]] and [[Petrus Ramus]]. Shortly afterwards he went to [[Bourges]] to study [[Civil law (area)|civil law]] for four years under [[Éguinaire Baron]] and [[François Douaren]]. While in Bourges, he formed an acquaintance with [[Jacques Amyot]], professor of [[Greek language|Greek]], and succeeded him in becoming preceptor to the sons of [[Guillaume Bochetel]], the secretary of state, probably for three or four years. In February 1547 he returned to [[Scotland]] for a short stay and Bochetel recommended him in a letter to [[Mary of Guise]].

Back in [[France]] in 1548, Scrimgeour then accompanied his pupil [[Bernardin Bochetel]] to [[Padua]]. Although a [[Catholic]], he was plunged into the controversies of the Italian [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] when he visited a young lawyer of Cittadella, [[Francesco Spiera]], who was slowly dying of despair, having adopted the new opinions and then been forced to recant. Scrimgeour wrote an essay on piety, published at [[Geneva]] (under the name of Henricus Scotus) by [[Jean Gerard]] and with a preface by [[Jean Calvin]] dated December 1549, entitled "Exemplum memorabile desperationis in Francisco Spera, propter abiuratam fidei confessionem". The tract was republished the same year in [[Basel]]. Nonetheless, it was some years before Scrimgeour would openly show his adherence to [[protestantism]], and his second publication was a law book, an edition of the Novellae, printed by Estienne in Geneva in May 1558 and subsidized by [[Ulrich Fugger]], entitled: Impp. Justiniani, Justini, Leonis novellae constitutiones. The Novellae were fundamental to the teaching of law on the continent at this time, and a new edition was badly needed. Scrimgeour used his contacts with the French [[ambassador]] to [[Venice]] to gain access to the important Bessarian codex there, and his edition was well received by contemporary [[lawyers]]. The period between 1558 and his last visit to [[Italy]] in 1564 represents the most energetic part of Scrimgeour's activity in another capacity, that of book collector; it is accepted that the greatest part of the Greek, [[Latin]], and [[Hebrew]] manuscripts of the Fugger collection were gathered by Scrimgeour, who frequently travelled between [[Augsburg]] and Italy. It is today the core of the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]] Palatine collection. Scrimgeour also acted as agent in buying books for [[Otto-Heinrich]], the elector palatine.

Scrimgeour kept his benefices in [[Scotland]] all his life, but he also enjoyed an income in France-—there exists an authorization given to him in 1556 by King [[Henry II of France|Henri II]] to hold and receive benefices in his country of adoption.  He also engaged on a diplomatic career, travelling to Padua, [[Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Rome]], [[Milan]], [[Mantua]], and [[Bologna]], and also to Bourges, where he tried unsuccessfully to set up a printing press. Bernandin Bochetel, now [[abbot]] of [[St Laurent des Aubats]], had several times invited him to [[Vienna]], and he finally went there in November 1560. Bochetel may have wanted his diplomatic services at this time to help him in difficult negotiations with the German Lutheran princes, or with the [[colloquy of Poissy]] of 1561 between French reformers and Catholics, or with the [[Council of Trent]], which after a ten-year interval had resumed its sessions in January 1562. However, Scrimgeour's stay in Vienna was brief, for by the end of 1561 he was in Geneva. 
 
Ulrich Fugger, now a [[Lutheran]], had a plan for a public [[library]] in Geneva in order to secure his large and important collection of rare books, and Scrimgeour was associated with this project. At the same time, on 30 December, he was honoured by the magistrates of Geneva who received him as a [[burgess (title)|burgess]], three years after [[John Knox]], and thanks to Calvin he soon became involved in the city's public life.

On 18 April 1562, with Calvin's blessing, Scrimgeour married Françoise de Saussure. However, Françoise died, on 1 February 1568, aged twenty-five, leaving a three-year-old daughter, Marie.  In 1563 the Genevan pastors appointed Scrimgeour reader in [[philosophy]], and the same year he was admitted to the [[town council]] of two hundred. Later he started giving lessons in civil law. When Calvin died in the spring of 1564 Scrimgeour was witness to his will.  On 3 January 1570 Scrimgeour joined the council of sixty at Geneva, and on 11 May married Catherine de Veillet. That year, two regents-—the earls of Moray and Mar-—and also [[George Buchanan]] tried to attract Scrimgeour back to Scotland to assist in the education of the young [[James VI]], but he declined, arguing his age and the instability of Scotland. Henry Scrimgeour died in Geneva on 23 September 1572.

'''Jean-André Deluc''' or '''de Luc'''&lt;ref name=spelling/&gt; (8 February 1727 – 7 November 1817) was a Swiss geologist, natural philosopher and [[meteorology|meteorologist]]. He also devised [[measuring instrument]]s.

== Biography ==
Jean-André Deluc was born in [[Geneva]]. His family had come to the [[Republic of Geneva]] from [[Lucca]], Italy, in the 15th century.&lt;ref name=lucques/&gt; His mother was Françoise Huaut. His father, Jacques-François Deluc,&lt;ref name=Sigrist/&gt; had written in refutation of [[Bernard Mandeville]] and other rationalistic writers, but he was also a decided supporter of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.&lt;ref name=letterByRousseau/&gt;

As a student of [[Georges-Louis Le Sage]], Jean-André Deluc received a basic education in mathematics and in natural philosophy. He engaged early in business, which occupied a large part of his first adult years, with the exception of scientific investigation in the Alps. With the help of his brother Guillaume-Antoine, he built a splendid collection of [[mineralogy]] and [[fossils]].&lt;ref&gt;René Sigrist, "Collecting nature's medals", in John Heilbron &amp; René Sigrist (eds), ''Jean-André Deluc. Historian of Earth and Man'', Geneva, Slatkine, 2011, p. 105-146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=museum/&gt;

Deluc also took part in politics. In 1768, sent on an embassy to the [[Étienne François, duc de Choiseul|duc de Choiseul]] in Paris, he succeeded in gaining the duke's friendship. In 1770 he became a member of the [[Council of Two Hundred]] in Geneva.

Three years later, business reverses forced him to leave his native town; he returned, briefly, only once. The change freed him for non-scientific pursuits; with little regret he moved to Great Britain in 1773, where he was appointed reader to [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]], a position he held for forty-four years and that afforded him both leisure and income.

Despite his duties at court, he was given leave to make several tours of Switzerland, France, Holland and Germany. At the beginning of his German tour (1798–1804), he was distinguished with an honorary professorship of philosophy and geology at the [[University of Göttingen]], which helped to cover diplomatic missions for the king George III. Back to Britain, he undertook a geological tour of the country (1804–1807).&lt;ref name=Michaud/&gt;

In 1773 Deluc was made a [[fellow of the Royal Society]]; he was a correspondent of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] and a member of several other [[learned society|learned societies]]. He died at [[Windsor, Berkshire]], England, in 1817, after nearly 70 years of research. [[Deluc (crater)|Deluc]], an [[impact crater]] on the Moon, was given his name.

== Scientific contributions ==

=== Observations and theory ===
Deluc's main interests were geology and meteorology; [[Georges Cuvier]] mentions him as an authority on the former subject.&lt;ref name=Cuvier/&gt; His major geological work, ''Lettres physiques et morales sur les montagnes et sur l'histoire de la terre et de l'homme'' (6 vol., 1778–1780), was dedicated to Queen Charlotte. He published volumes on geological travels: in northern Europe (1810), in England (1811), and in France, Switzerland and Germany (1813).

Deluc noticed the disappearance of heat in the thawing of ice about the same time that [[Joseph Black]] made it the foundation of his hypothesis of [[latent heat]]. He ascertained that water was densest at about 40&amp;nbsp;°F (4&amp;nbsp;°C) (and not at the freezing temperature); he was the originator of the theory, later reactivated by [[John Dalton]], that the quantity of [[water vapour]] contained in any space is independent of the presence or density of the air, or of any other elastic fluid.

His book ''Lettres sur l'histoire physique de la terre'' (Paris, 1798), addressed to [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]], develops a theory of the Earth divided into six periods modelled on the six days of Creation. It contains an essay on the existence of a [[Moral realism|General Principle of Morality]] and gives an interesting account of conversations with [[Voltaire]] and [[Rousseau]]. Deluc was an ardent admirer of [[Francis Bacon]], on whose writings he published two works: ''Bacon tel qu'il est'' (Berlin, 1800), showing the bad faith of the French translator, who had omitted many passages favourable to revealed religion, and ''Précis de la philosophie de Bacon'' (2 vols 8vo, Paris, 1802), giving an interesting view of the progress of natural science. ''Lettres sur le christianisme'' (Berlin and Hanover, 1803) was a controversial correspondence with [[Wilhelm Abraham Teller]] of Berlin in regard to the [[Moses|Mosaic]] [[cosmogony]]. His ''Traité élémentaire de géologie'' (Paris, 1809, translated into English by Henry de la Fite the same year) was principally intended as a refutation of [[James Hutton]] and [[John Playfair]]. They had shown that geology was driven by the operation of internal heat and erosion, but their system required much more time than Deluc's [[Moses|Mosaic]] variety of [[neptunism]] allowed.

Many other papers are in the ''Journal de Physique'', in the ''Philosophical Transactions'' and in the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]''.

=== Instruments ===
[[File:Whalebone hygrometer-MHS 1085-P4070321-gradient.jpg|thumb|Deluc's whalebone hygrometer, on display at the [[Musée d'histoire des sciences de la ville de Genève]].]]
Deluc dedicated a large part of his activity to perfecting or inventing [[measuring instrument]]s.

He devised a portable barometer for use in geological expeditions.&lt;ref name=barometer/&gt; His ''Recherches sur les modifications de l'atmosphère'' (2&amp;nbsp;vols. 4to, Geneva, 1772; 2nd&amp;nbsp;ed., 4&amp;nbsp;vols. Paris, 1784) contain experiments on moisture, evaporation and the indications of [[hygrometer]]s and [[thermometer]]s. He applied the [[barometer]] to the determination of heights. The ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'' published his account of a new hygrometer, which resembled a mercurial thermometer, with an ivory bulb, which expanded by moisture, and caused the mercury to descend.&lt;ref name=hygrometer/&gt; He later devised a whalebone hygrometer which sparked a bitter controversy with [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure]], himself inventor of a hair hygrometer.&lt;ref&gt;René Sigrist, "Scientific standards in the 1780s: A controversy over hygrometers", in John Heilbron &amp; René Sigrist (eds), ''Jean-André Deluc. Historian of Earth and Man'', Geneva, Slatkine, 2011, p. 147-183.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave the first correct rules for measuring heights with the help of a barometer&lt;!-- Please beware of the mention in 1911 Britannica: "in the ''Philosophical Transactions'', 1771, p. 158"--&gt;.&lt;ref name=AltitudeBarometer/&gt; Deluc advocated the use of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], instead of alcohol, in thermometers.

In 1809 he sent a long paper to the Royal Society on separating the chemical from the electrical effect of the [[dry pile]], a form of [[Voltaic pile]],&lt;ref name=Nicholson/&gt; with a description of the electric column and aerial electroscope, in which he advanced opinions contradicting the latest discoveries of the day; they were deemed inappropriate to admit into the ''Transactions''. The dry column described by Deluc was constructed by various scientists and his improvement of the dry pile has been regarded as his most important work, although he was not in fact its inventor. He was a valued mentor to the young [[Francis Ronalds]], who published several papers on dry piles in 1814–15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=July 2016|title=Francis Ronalds (1788–1873): The First Electrical Engineer?|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2016.2571358|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scriptural and observational data===
The last decades of Deluc's life were occupied with theological considerations.&lt;ref name=Sigrist/&gt; In his controversy with Hutton, "while never arguing that Hutton was an atheist, Deluc did accuse him of failing to counter [[atheism]] sufficiently".&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt;

He took care in reconciling observational data and the Scriptures considered as a description of the history of the world. In his ''Lettres physiques et morales'' he explained the six days of the creation as epochs preceding the current state of the globe, and attributed the deluge to the filling up of cavities in the interior of the earth.

The subject is discussed at length by Martina Kölbl-Ebert in ''Geology and Religion''.&lt;ref name=GeolReligion/&gt;

'''John of Salisbury''' (c. 1120 – 25 October 1180), who described himself as '''Johannes Parvus''' ("John the Little"),&lt;ref name="McCormick 1889 44"&gt;{{cite book|last=McCormick |first=Stephen J. |authorlink=S. J. McCormick |title=The Pope and Ireland.|publisher=A. Waldteufel|location=San Francisco|year=1889|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English author, philosopher, educationalist, diplomat and [[bishop of Chartres]], and was born at [[Salisbury, England|Salisbury]].

==Early life and education==
He was of [[Anglo-Saxon]], not of [[Normans|Norman]] extraction, and therefore apparently a [[Cleric|clerk]] from a modest background, whose career depended upon his education. Beyond that, and that he applied to himself the cognomen of ''Parvus'', "short", or "small", few details are known regarding his early life. From his own statements it is gathered that he crossed to France about 1136, and began regular studies in [[Paris]] under [[Peter Abelard]],&lt;ref name=Guilfoy&gt;Guilfoy, Kevin, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/john-salisbury/ "John of Salisbury"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  (Spring 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; who had for a brief period re-opened his famous school there on [[Montagne Sainte-Geneviève]].

His vivid accounts of teachers and students provide some of the most valuable insights into the early days of the [[University of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Cantor 1992:324.&lt;/ref&gt; When Abelard withdrew from Paris John studied under Master Alberic and [[Robert of Melun]]. In 1137 John went to Chartres, where he studied grammar under [[William of Conches]], and rhetoric, logic and the classics under [[Richard l'Evêque]], a disciple of [[Bernard of Chartres]].&lt;ref name=Pike&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/salisbury/policrat123.htm John of Salisbury. ''Frivolities of Courtiers and Footprints of Philosophers'', (Joseph B. Pike, trans.), University of Minnesota, 1938]&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard's teaching was distinguished partly by its pronounced [[Neoplatonism|Platonic]] tendency, and partly by the stress laid upon literary study of the greater Latin writers.  The influence of the latter feature is noticeable in all John of Salisbury's works.

Around 1140 John returned to Paris to study theology under [[Gilbert de la Porrée]], then under [[Robert Pullus]] and Simon of Poissy, supporting himself as a tutor to young noblemen. In 1148 he resided at the Abbey of Moutiers-la-Celle in the [[diocese of Troyes]], with his friend [[Peter of Celle]]. He was present at the [[Council of Rheims (1148)|Council of Reims]] in 1148, presided over by [[Pope Eugene III]]. It is conjectured that while there, he was introduced by St. [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] to [[Theobald of Bec|Theobald]], whose secretary he became.&lt;ref name=Guilfoy/&gt;

==Secretary to the Archbishop of Canterbury==
John of Salisbury was secretary to Archbishop Theobald for seven years. While at Canterbury he became acquainted with Thomas Becket, one of the significant potent influences in John's life. During this period he went on many missions to the Papal See; it was probably on one of these that he made the acquaintance of Nicholas Breakspear, who in 1154 became Pope [[Adrian IV]]. The following year John visited him, remaining at Benevento with him for several months. He was at the court of Rome at least twice afterward.&lt;ref name=Pike/&gt;

During this time he composed his greatest works, published almost certainly in 1159, the ''[[Policraticus|Policraticus, sive de nugis curialium et de vestigiis philosophorum]]'' and the ''Metalogicon'', writings invaluable as storehouses of information regarding the matter and form of scholastic education, and remarkable for their cultivated style and humanist tendency. The ''Policraticus'' also sheds light on the decadence of the 12th-century court manners and the lax ethics of royalty. The idea of contemporaries ''[[standing on the shoulders of giants]]'' of Antiquity first appears in written form in the ''Metalogicon''. After the death of Theobald in 1161, John continued as secretary to his successor, [[Thomas Becket]], and took an active part in the long [[Becket controversy|disputes]] between that [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] and his sovereign, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], who looked upon John as a papal agent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman F. Cantor]], 1993. ''The Civilization of the Middle Ages'', 324-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

His letters throw light on the constitutional struggle then agitating England. In 1163, John fell into disfavor with the king for reasons that remain obscure, and withdrew to France. The next six years he spent with his friend Peter of La Celle, now Abbot of St. Remigius at Reims. Here he wrote "Historia Pontificalis".&lt;ref name=Coffey&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08478b.htm Coffey, Peter. "John of Salisbury." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 20 Jul. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 1170 he led the delegation charged with preparing for Becket's return to England,&lt;ref name=Guilfoy/&gt; and was in Canterbury at the time of Becket's assassination. In 1174 John became treasurer of Exeter cathedral.

==Bishop of Chartres==
In 1176 he was made bishop of [[Chartres]], where he passed the remainder of his life. In 1179 he took an active part in the [[Third Council of the Lateran]]. He died at or near Chartres on October 25, 1180.&lt;ref name="McCormick 1889 44"/&gt;

==Scholarship and influences==
John's writings are excellent at clarifying the literary and scientific position of [[Renaissance of the 12th century|12th century Western Europe]]. Though he was well versed in the new logic and dialectical rhetoric of the university, John's views imply a cultivated intelligence well versed in practical affairs, opposing to the extremes of both [[nominalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]] a practical [[common sense]]. His doctrine is a kind of [[utilitarianism]], with a strong leaning on the speculative side to the modified literary scepticism of [[Cicero]], for whom he had unbounded admiration and on whose style he based his own. His view that the end of education was moral, rather than merely intellectual, became one of the  prime educational doctrines of western civilization, but his influence is to be found, not in his immediate contemporaries but in the world-view of [[Renaissance humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cantor 1993:325f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of Greek writers he appears to have known nothing at first hand, and very little in translations. He was one of the best Latinists of his age. The ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' of Plato in the Latin version of [[Chalcidius]] was known to him as to his contemporaries and predecessors, and probably he had access to translations of the ''[[Phaedo]]'' and ''[[Meno]]''. Of [[Aristotle]] he possessed the whole of the ''[[Organon]]'' in Latin; he is, indeed, the first of the medieval writers of note to whom the whole was known.

He first coined the term ''[[Theatrum Mundi|theatrum mundi]]'', a notion that influences the theater several centuries later. In several chapters of the third book of his ''[[Policraticus]]'', he meditates on the fact that "the life of man on earth is a comedy, where each forgetting his own plays another's role" &lt;ref&gt;John Gillies, ''Shakespeare and the Geography of Difference'', Volume 4 of Cambridge Studies in Renaissance Literature and Culture, Cambridge University Press, 1994. {{ISBN|9780521458535}}. [https://books.google.ca/books?id=HoKybxnJLVMC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76 Pages 76-77].&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Fictional portrayals==
John was portrayed by actor  [[Alex G. Hunter]] in the 1923 silent film ''Becket'', based on a play by [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]].

'''Kriya Yoga''' (क्रिया योग) is described by its practitioners as the ancient [[Yoga]] system revived in modern times by [[Mahavatar Babaji]] through his disciple [[Lahiri Mahasaya]], c. 1861. Kriya Yoga was brought to international awareness by [[Paramahansa Yogananda]]'s book ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]''&lt;ref name="Miller178"&gt;{{cite book | last =Miller | first =Timothy | title =America's Alternative Religions | publisher =SUNY Press | year =1995 | page=178/183 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3Mt7QlXrRwC&amp;pg=PA178 | isbn =0791423972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and through Yogananda's introductions of the practice to the west from 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Kriya Yoga Path of Meditation|url=http://www.yogananda-srf.org/kriya_yoga_path_of_meditation.aspx#.VRw7BzusXZY|journal=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Kriya Yoga is the "Yoga of Practice".

According to Yogananda the ancient Yogic text the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'', contains a description of Kriya Yoga in the second chapter II.49:&lt;ref&gt;Patanjali, Translator, Chip Hartranft (2003). ''The Yoga-Sutra of Patanjali: A New Translation with Commentary'' (Shambhala Classics). {{ISBN|1-59030-023-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Liberation can be attained by that pranayama which is accomplished by disjoining the course of inspiration and expiration."&lt;ref name="Chapter26"&gt;{{cite book |last=Yogananda |first=Paramahansa |title= Autobiography of a Yogi- Chapter 26 - The Science of Kriya Yoga|year=1997 |publisher=[[Self-Realization Fellowship]] |isbn=0876120869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kriya yoga system consists of a number of levels of [[pranayama]], [[mantra]], and [[mudra]] based on techniques intended to rapidly accelerate spiritual development&lt;ref name="Miller178" /&gt; and engender a profound state of tranquility and God-communion.&lt;ref name="Chapter26"/&gt; Yogananda attributes his description of ''Kriya Yoga'' to his lineage of [[guru]]s, [[Sri Yukteswar Giri]], [[Lahiri Mahasaya]], and [[Mahavatar Babaji]]. The latter is reported to have introduced the concept as essentially identical to the [[Raja Yoga]] of [[Patanjali]] and the concept of Yoga as described in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''.&lt;ref name="Chapter26"/&gt;

==Practice==
[[File:Lahiri Mahasaya.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lahiri Mahasaya]] (1828–1895).]]
[[File:Krishna instructing Arjuna.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Krishna]] instructing Arjuna]]

Kriya Yoga, as taught by Lahiri Mahasaya, is traditionally exclusively learned via the Guru-disciple relationship and the initiation consists of a secret ceremony.&lt;ref name=Dasgupta&gt;{{cite book | last =Dasgupta| first = Sailendra Bejoy | title =Kriya Yoga, its dissemination, and the Mahamuni Babaji Maharaj - Chapter 5 &amp; 8 | publisher =Yoga Niketan | year =2011 | page= | url=http://www.yoganiketan.net | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller178"/&gt; He recounted that after his initiation into Kriya Yoga, "Babaji instructed me in the ancient rigid rules which govern the transmission of the yogic art from Guru to disciple."&lt;ref name="Chapter33"&gt;{{cite book |last=Yogananda |first=Paramahansa |title= Autobiography of a Yogi- Chapter 33 - Babaji, Yogi-Christ of Modern India|year=1997 |publisher=Self-Realization Fellowship |isbn=0876120869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Yogananda describes Kriya Yoga, "The Kriya Yogi mentally directs his life energy to revolve, upward and downward, around the six spinal centers (medullary, cervical, dorsal, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal plexuses) which correspond to the twelve astral signs of the zodiac, the symbolic Cosmic Man. One half-minute of revolution of energy around the sensitive spinal cord of man effects subtle progress in his evolution; that half-minute of Kriya equals one year of natural spiritual unfoldment."&lt;ref name="Chapter26"/&gt;

There seems to be a suggestion that the process of performing Kriya Yoga leads to a certain purification of the blood which in turn frees up the life force to withdraw into the spine. "''Kriya Yoga'' is a simple, psycho-physiological method by which the human blood is decarbonized and recharged with oxygen. The atoms of this extra oxygen are transmuted into life current to rejuvenate the brain and spinal centers. By stopping the accumulation of venous blood, the yogi is able to lessen or prevent the decay of tissues; the advanced yogi transmutes his cells into pure energy. Elijah, Jesus, Kabir and other prophets were past masters in the use of ''Kriya'' or a similar technique, by which they caused their bodies to dematerialize at will."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Autobiography of a Yogi|last=Yogananda|first=Paramahansa|publisher=THE PHILOSOPHICAL LIBRARY, INC.|year=1946|isbn=9788189535513|location=New york|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Kriya Quotes from Swami Satyananda'', it is written, "Kriya sadhana may be thought of as the [[sadhana]] of the 'practice of being in [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'{{-"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Satyananda | first =Swami| title =A Collection of Biographies of 4 Kriya Yoga Gurus by Swami Satyananda Giri - Kriya Quotes from Swami Satyananda Giri (translated by Yogi Niketan) |url = http://www.yoganiketan.net | year =2006 | page= |  publisher= iUniverse| isbn =978-0595386758 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Offering inhaling breath into the outgoing breath, and offering the outgoing breath into the inhaling breath, the yogi neutralizes both these breaths; he thus releases the life force from the heart and brings it under his control.&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavad Gita IV:29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yogananda also stated that Krishna was referring to Kriya Yoga when "Lord Krishna ... relates that it was 'he', in a former incarnation, who communicated the indestructible yoga to an ancient illuminato, Vivasvat, who gave it to Manu, the great legislator. He, in turn, instructed Ikshwaku, the father of India’s solar warrior dynasty."&lt;ref name="Chapter26"/&gt; And again when he says,"Liberation can be accomplished by that pranayama which is attained by disjoining the course of inhalation and exhalation."&lt;ref name="Chapter26"/&gt; A direct disciple of [[Sri Yukteswar Giri]], Sailendra Dasgupta (d. 1984) has written that, "Kriya entails several acts that have evidently been adapted from the Gita, the Yoga Sutras, [[Tantra]] shastras and from conceptions on the Yugas."&lt;ref name=Dasgupta/&gt;

Kriya means action or doing or perform or movement.

===Recent history===
The story of Lahiri Mahasaya receiving initiation into Kriya Yoga by the yogi Mahavatar Babaji in 1861 is recounted in ''Autobiography of a Yogi''.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yogananda |first=Paramahansa |title= Autobiography of a Yogi- Chapter 34 - Materializing a Palace in the Himalayas|year=1997 |publisher=Self-Realization Fellowship |isbn=0876120869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yogananda wrote that at that meeting, [[Mahavatar Babaji]] told Lahiri Mahasaya, "The Kriya Yoga that I am giving to the world through you in this nineteenth century, is a revival of the same science that Krishna gave millenniums ago to Arjuna; and was later known to Patanjali, and to Christ, St. John, St. Paul, and other disciples." Yogananda also wrote that Babaji and Christ were in continual communion and together, "have planned the spiritual technique of salvation for this age."&lt;ref name="Miller178" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapter33"/&gt;

Through Lahiri Mahasaya, Kriya Yoga soon spread throughout India. Yogananda, a disciple of [[Sri Yukteswar Giri]] who was himself a disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya, then brought Kriya Yoga to the United States and Europe during the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Chapter26"/&gt;

Lahiri Mahasaya's disciples included his two sons, Dukouri Lahiri and [[Tinkouri Lahiri]], [[Sri Yukteswar Giri]], [[Panchanan Bhattacharya]], Swami Pranabananda, Swami Kebalananda, [[Keshavananda Brahmachari]], Bhupendranath Sanyal (Sanyal Mahasaya), and many others .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yogananda |first=Paramahansa |title= Autobiography of a Yogi- Chapters 3, 32, 33, 36|year=1997 |publisher=Self-Realization Fellowship |isbn=0876120869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3545">'''Marjorie Silliman Harris''' (June 6, 1890 – March 27, 1976) was an American philosopher who wrote on the problem of determining meaningfulness in life. Influenced by [[Auguste Comte]], [[Henri Bergson]], and [[Francisco Romero (philosopher)|Francisco Romero]], she addressed questions related to individual experience and its assimilation or transcendence.

==Education==
Marjorie Harris was born in 1890 in Wethersfield, Connecticut, to Elizabeth Mills Harris and George Wells Harris. She attended [[Mount Holyoke College]], receiving her B.A. in 1913. She went on to complete a doctorate in philosophy at [[Cornell University]] (1921), where she was awarded the Susan Linn Sage Scholarship.&lt;ref name=waithe/&gt; Her dissertation was on the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]].&lt;ref name=shook/&gt;

==Career==
Harris taught briefly at the University of Colorado (1921–22), but the bulk of her academic career was spent at [[Randolph-Macon Woman's College]] in Virginia (1922–58), where she rose to be a full professor and chair of the Philosophy Department. From 1934 onward, she was an emerita professor at the college.&lt;ref name=waithe/&gt;

Harris wrote principally on the French philosophers Comte and [[Henri Bergson]] and the Latin-American philosopher [[Francisco Romero (philosopher)|Francisco Romero]].&lt;ref name=waithe/&gt; A major theme of her writing is the role of philosophy in illuminating what is significant in an individual life, and here she shows the influence of Bergson's conception of 'life' as well as [[John Dewey]]'s pragmatism.&lt;ref name=shook/&gt; The title of one of her books, ''[[Sub specie aeternitatis|Sub Specie Aeternitatis]]'' (1937, 'from the perspective of eternity'), makes visible her concern to connect what is (or may be) universally true with the individual experiences that fall within our often narrow perceptions. She is much concerned with how the human quest for truth and meaning in a life are shaped by our notions of experience, transcendence (as developed by Romero), freedom, and will.&lt;ref name=shook/&gt; One of her lines of argument holds that a satisfactory life requires a certain degree of detachment as well as the ability to resist trying to organize all experience through rigid and predetermined categories.&lt;ref name=shook/&gt;

Harris was a member of numerous professional organizations, including the American Philosophical Association.&lt;ref name=shook/&gt;

She died in 1976 in Rocky Hill, Connecticut.&lt;ref name=shook/&gt;

Mind and Life Dialogues, forerunners of the Institute, were initiated by American entrepreneur [[R. Adam Engle]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=TM1&gt;Begley 2007, pp.19-22&lt;/ref&gt;  He heard of Tenzin Gyatso, [[14th Dalai Lama#Interest in science.2C and Mind and Life Institute|the 14th Dalai Lama’s interest in modern science]]&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|author1=Tenzin Gyatso|title=Our Faith in Science|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/12/opinion/12dalai.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|publisher=New York Times|date=November 12, 2005|quote=Science has always fascinated me}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Melissa Rice|title=Carl Sagan and the Dalai Lama found deep connections in 1991-92 meetings, says Sagan's widow|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2007/10/meeting-two-minds-carl-sagan-and-dalai-lama|publisher=Cormell University, Cornell Chronicle|date=October 3, 2007|quote=The Dalai Lama, who has had a lifelong interest in science}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offered to arrange a dialogue for him with selected scientists.&lt;ref name=Plasticmind&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sharon Begley|title=The Plastic Mind|date=2007|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-84529-674-2|pages=318–324|edition=Kindle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fP6dBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT229 |chapter=Appendix}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dalai Lama accepted and authorised Engle to set one up.&lt;ref&gt;Begley 2007, pp.19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 Chilean neuroscientist [[Francisco Varela]] heard about this.&lt;ref name=GB&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeremy W. Hayward, Francisco J. Varela|title=Gentle Bridges: Conversations with the Dalai Lama on the Sciences of Mind|date=1992|publisher=Shambala Publications|location=USA|isbn=1-57062-893-9|page=x|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gentle-Bridges-Conversations-Dalai-Sciences/dp/1570628939#reader_1570628939|accessdate=10 May 2015|chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having participated in a conference on consciousness attended by the Dalai Lama in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;Begley 2007, pp.18-19&lt;/ref&gt; and like Engle a Buddhist practitioner since 1974, he was interested in further exploration of the interface between science and Buddhism and contacted Engle, offering to assist.&lt;ref name=BM&gt;Barinaga M. Buddhism and neuroscience. Studying the well-trained mind. Science. 2003 Oct 3;302(5642):44-6. {{PMID|14526055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[R. Adam Engle|Engle]], [[Francisco Varela|Varela]], and the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] saw Buddhism and science as different methodologies with a similar aim: to investigate nature and reality, using knowledge gained to improve the quality of life and the planet.&lt;ref name=BGK&gt;{{cite web|author1=Vincent Horn|title=The Evolution of the Mind and Life Dialogues|url=http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2009/05/bg-122-the-evolution-of-the-mind-and-life-dialogues/|publisher=Buddhist Geeks|accessdate=9 May 2015|ref=BD 122|quote=And Buddhism ... is based on also understanding the nature of reality and then using that to provide a knowledge base for improving lives|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504061533/http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2009/05/bg-122-the-evolution-of-the-mind-and-life-dialogues/|archivedate=4 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They concurred that science uses technology and the scientific method as its means while Buddhism uses the human nervous system refined by meditation and rigorous mental and emotional training.&lt;ref name=GB/&gt;&lt;ref name=MITTR&gt;{{cite web|author1=Curt Newton|title=Meditation and the Brain|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/402450/meditation-and-the-brain/|website=technologyreview.com|publisher=MIT Technology Review|date=February 1, 2004|quote=The Dalai Lama notes that both traditions encourage challenging dogma based on observation and analysis, and a willingness to revise views based on empirical evidence.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, there had been no mechanism for scientists and Buddhist masters to meet and share their findings in dialogue. The concept pioneered a new interdisciplinary, cross-cultural engagement.&lt;ref name=Plasticmind /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watson 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=80JNDfdTA2MC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA169&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.169]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[R. Adam Engle|Engle]] organized the original Mind and Life Dialogue in October 1987 at the Dalai Lama’s residence in [[Dharamshala]], India as  a week-long event.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Varela 1992, Preface&lt;/ref&gt; Six scientists including Varela, two interpreters and the Dalai Lama spent five hours daily, sharing views and discussing the sciences of the mind.&lt;ref name=Plasticmind /&gt;  At the end, Engle asked the Dalai Lama if he wanted to do it again. The answer was "yes," and the series of dialogues was born.&lt;ref name=BG122&gt;{{cite web|author1=Vincent Horn|title=The Evolution of the Mind and Life Dialogues|url=http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2009/05/bg-122-the-evolution-of-the-mind-and-life-dialogues/|publisher=Buddhist Geeks|accessdate=9 May 2015|ref=BD 122|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504061533/http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2009/05/bg-122-the-evolution-of-the-mind-and-life-dialogues/|archivedate=4 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second dialogue was a two-day event in October 1989 in Newport Beach, California.&lt;ref name=Plasticmind /&gt; At the third dialogue, held in Dharamsala in 1990, it was decided that in order to organize and fund further dialogues and potential research programmes  the Mind and Life Institute should be incorporated as a non-profit organization in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Begley 2007, p.258&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speakers and Panelists for Investigating the Mind 2005|url=http://www.investigatingthemind.org/speakers.html|publisher=The Mind and Life Institute|accessdate=9 May 2015|date=2003|quote=[Adam Engle] co-founded the Mind and Life dialogues in 1983, and formed the Mind and Life Institute in 1990|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220033300/http://investigatingthemind.org/speakers.html|archivedate=20 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watson 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=80JNDfdTA2MC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA169&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.170]&lt;/ref&gt; The institute was incorporated in 1991. Engle was elected Chair and CEO, a post he held for 22 years until his retirement in 2012 having guided its development into "a worldwide and influential  organization bringing together the highest standards of modern science and contemplative practice." Engle was then succeeded by the physicist and author [[Arthur Zajonc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Matthieu Ricard|title=Celebrating the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary of the Mind and Life Institute|url=http://www.matthieuricard.org/en/blog/posts/celebrating-the-twenty-fifth-anniversary-of-the-mind-and-life-institute|website=Matthieu Ricard, Buddhist monk, photographer and author|accessdate=28 July 2015|date=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1998 Mind &amp; Life had hosted seven dialogues between numerous world renowned scientists, philosophers and the Dalai Lama on [[cognitive neuroscience]] and [[physics]], and published six books relating the dialogues to the general public.&lt;ref name=pdf&gt;{{cite web|title=A 25 Years History of Accomplishment|url=https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gns1ff0ziu9ikx3/AAAH3rqan1jP_RyksNVOYl0Da/MLI%2025%20years%20of%20Accomplishment.pdf?dl=0|publisher=Mind and Life Institute|accessdate=6 May 2015|format=PDF|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Mind &amp; Life held its second public dialogue in Washington DC, titled “The Science and Clinical Applications of Meditation,” co-sponsored by Johns Hopkins Medical University, and the Georgetown Medical Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investigatingthemind.org/ |title=The Science and Clinical Applications of Meditation |date=2005 |website=Investigating the Mind |accessdate=3 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801130259/http://investigatingthemind.org/ |archivedate=1 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2013 a total of 27 dialogues with the Dalai Lama had been hosted, eleven books had been published relating the first thirteen dialogues to the public (see publications) and DVDs or videos published on most of the others.&lt;ref name="pdf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dialogues with the Dalai Lama - Past Dialogues|url=https://www.mindandlife.org/dialogues-dalai-lama/|website=Mind and Life Institute|publisher=Mind and Life Institute|accessdate=13 August 2015|quote=[list of dialogues with location, subject, participants etc.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, under the new leadership of president Susan Bauer-Wu, PhD, the Mind and Life Institute relocated to Charlottesville, Virginia.

==Establishment of research agenda==
In 1998, to increase Mind &amp; Life's potential for societal benefits, Engle broadened its mission to include carrying out scientific research.&lt;ref name="BG122" /&gt; This idea was encouraged by the Dalai Lama, who, at the next dialogue in 2000, suggested scientific investigation under laboratory conditions to establish whether Buddhist contemplative practices could be of significant benefit to modern society, and if so to find a way of teaching the subject in a secular environment.&lt;ref name="BG122" /&gt;
A research programme was launched accordingly as a result of Mind &amp; Life's first public dialogue, held at MIT in 2003, entitled "Investigating the Mind."&lt;ref name=BM/&gt;

In 2004, Mind &amp; Life launched its Summer Research Institute at the [[Garrison Institute]] in New York. This conference presented the first curriculum on [[contemplative neuroscience]] to graduate students, post doctorates and science faculty members.&lt;ref&gt;Begley, 2007 p.260&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the same year, Mind &amp; Life also started the [[Francisco J. Varela]] Research Awards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mind and Life Summer Research Institute and Francisco J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1231">'''Naïve empiricism''' is a term used in several ways in different fields.

In the [[philosophy of science]], it is used by opponents to describe the position, associated with some [[logical positivist]]s, that "knowledge can be clearly learnt through evaluation of the natural world and its substances, and, through empirical means, learn truths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Thomas Ernst Uebel]] | title = Overcoming Logical Positivism from Within: The Emergence of Neurath's Naturalism in the Vienna Circle's Protocol Sentence Debate | pages = 205 | year = 1992 | publisher = Rodopi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also is used to describe a particular methodology for [[literary analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Michael McKeon | title = The Origins of the English novel | pages = 105–109 | year = 1986 | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orchestrated objective reduction''' ('''Orch-OR''') is a hypothesis that [[consciousness]] in the [[brain]] originates from processes ''inside'' [[neurons]], rather than from connections ''between'' neurons (the conventional view). The mechanism is held to be a [[quantum physics]] process called [[objective reduction]] that is orchestrated by molecular structures called [[microtubules]]. It is proposed that objective reduction is influenced by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|non-computable]]  factors embedded in spacetime geometry which thus may account for the [[Hard Problem of Consciousness]]. The hypothesis was put forward in the early 1990s by [[theoretical physicist]] [[Roger Penrose]] and [[Anesthesiologist|anaesthesiologist]] and [[psychologist]] [[Stuart Hameroff]].

==Overview==
The hypothesis states that consciousness derives from deeper-level, finer-scale [[Quantum information science|quantum]] activities inside cells, most prevalent in the neurons. It combines approaches from [[molecular biology]], [[neuroscience]], quantum physics, [[pharmacology]], [[philosophy]], [[quantum information theory]] and from a yet to come theory to [[Penrose interpretation|"gravitize" quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref name=H&amp;PvsReimers2014&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hameroff |first=Stuart |last2=Penrose |first2=Roger |date=March 2014 |title=Reply to criticism of the ‘Orch OR qubit’ – ‘Orchestrated objective reduction’ is scientifically justified |journal=Physics of Life Reviews |publisher=Elsevier |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=94–100 |doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2013.11.013 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571064513001905 |accessdate=17 March 2014 |bibcode=2014PhLRv..11...94H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Penrose2014"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Penrose

==Penrose–Lucas argument&lt;!--'Penrose–Lucas argument' redirects here--&gt;==
{{Main article|Gödel's incompleteness theorems}}

The Penrose–Lucas argument states that, because humans are capable of knowing the truth of Gödel-unprovable statements, human thought is necessarily [[computable function|non-computable]].&lt;ref name=Penrose1989/&gt;

In 1931, mathematician and logician [[Kurt Gödel]] [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|proved]] that any [[effective procedure|effectively generated]] theory capable of proving basic arithmetic cannot be both [[consistency|consistent]] and [[completeness (logic)|complete]]. Furthermore, he showed that any such theory also including a statement of its own consistency is inconsistent. A key element of the proof is the use of [[Gödel numbering]] to construct a "Gödel sentence" for the theory, which encodes a statement of its own incompleteness, e.g. "This theory can't assert the truth of this statement." This statement is either true but unprovable (incompleteness) ''or'' false and provable (inconsistency). An analogous statement has been used to show that humans are subject to the same limits as machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofstadter|1979|pp=476–477}}, {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=950}}, {{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "The Argument from Mathematics" where he writes "although it is established that there are limitations to the powers of any particular machine, it has only been stated, without sort of proof, that no such limitations apply to the human intellect."&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in his first book on consciousness, ''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]'' (1989), Penrose made Gödel's theorem the basis of what quickly became a controversial claim.&lt;ref name=Penrose1989/&gt; He argued that while a formal proof system cannot prove its own consistency, Gödel-unprovable results are provable by human mathematicians. He takes this disparity to mean that human mathematicians are not describable as formal proof systems, and are therefore running a [[computable function|non-computable algorithm]]. Similar claims about the implications of Gödel's theorem were originally espoused by the philosopher [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]] of [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College, Oxford in 1961]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lucas|first=John R.|date=1961|title=Minds, Machines and Godel|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/LUCMMA|journal=Philosophy|volume=36|issue=April-July|pages=112–127|doi=10.1017/s0031819100057983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective reduction==
{{main article|Penrose interpretation}}

===Motivation===
If correct, the Penrose–Lucas argument creates a need to understand the physical basis of non-computable behaviour in the brain.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Most physical laws are computable, and thus algorithmic. However, Penrose determined that [[wave function collapse]] was a prime candidate for a non-computable process.

In [[quantum mechanics]], particles are treated differently from the objects of [[classical mechanics]]. Particles are described by [[wave function]]s that evolve according to the [[Schrödinger equation]]. Non-stationary wave functions are [[linear combination]]s of the [[eigenstate]]s of the system, a phenomenon described by the [[superposition principle]]. When a quantum system interacts with a classical system—i.e. when an [[observable]] is measured—the system appears to [[wave function collapse|collapse]] to a random eigenstate of that [[observable]] from a classical vantage point.

If collapse is truly random, then no process or algorithm can deterministically predict its outcome. This provided Penrose with a candidate for the physical basis of the non-computable process that he hypothesized to exist in the brain. However, he disliked the random nature of environmentally-induced collapse, as randomness was not a promising basis for mathematical understanding. Penrose proposed that isolated systems may still undergo a new form of [[wave function collapse]], which he called objective reduction (OR).&lt;ref name="Penrose-Hameroff2014"/&gt;

===Details===
Penrose sought to reconcile [[general relativity]] and quantum theory using his own ideas about the possible structure of [[spacetime]].&lt;ref name=Penrose1989&gt;{{Cite book |last=Penrose |first= Roger |authorlink=Roger Penrose |title=The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds and The Laws of Physics |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1989 |page=480|isbn=0-19-851973-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Penrose1994&gt;{{Cite book |last=Penrose |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Penrose |title=Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989 |page= 457 |isbn=0-19-853978-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that at the [[Planck scale]] curved spacetime is not continuous, but discrete. Penrose postulated that each separated [[quantum superposition]] has its own piece of [[spacetime curvature]], a blister in spacetime. Penrose suggests that gravity exerts a force on these spacetime blisters, which become unstable above the Planck scale of &lt;math&gt;10^{-35} \text{m}&lt;/math&gt; and collapse to just one of the possible states. The rough threshold for OR is given by Penrose's indeterminacy principle:
:&lt;math&gt;
\tau \approx \hbar/E_G
&lt;/math&gt;
where:
* &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the time until OR occurs, 
* &lt;math&gt;E_G&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational self-energy or the degree of spacetime separation given by the superpositioned mass, and
* &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Planck constant]]. 
Thus, the greater the mass-energy of the object, the faster it will undergo OR and vice versa. Atomic-level superpositions would require 10 million years to reach OR threshold, while an isolated 1 [[kilogram]] object would reach OR threshold in 10&lt;sup&gt;−37&lt;/sup&gt;s. Objects somewhere between these two scales could collapse on a timescale relevant to neural processing.&lt;ref name="Penrose-Hameroff2014"/&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2013 |reason=Search for supporting evidence besides the papers from the main authors of the theory.}}

An essential feature of Penrose's theory is that the choice of states when objective reduction occurs is selected neither randomly (as are choices following [[wave function collapse]]) nor algorithmically. Rather, states are selected by a "non-computable" influence embedded in the [[Planck]] scale of spacetime geometry. Penrose claimed that such information is [[Platonism|Platonic]], representing pure mathematical truth, aesthetic and ethical values at the Planck scale. This relates to Penrose's ideas concerning the three worlds: physical, mental, and the Platonic mathematical world. In his theory, the Platonic world corresponds to the geometry of fundamental spacetime that is claimed to support non-computational thinking.&lt;ref name="Penrose-Hameroff2014"/&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2013 |reason=Search for supporting evidence besides the papers from the main authors of the theory.}}

No evidence supports Penrose's objective reduction, but the theory is considered testable and the [[FELIX (experiment)]] has been suggested to evaluate and measure the objective criterion.&lt;ref name="Marshall2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marshall, W., Simon, C., Penrose, R., and Bouwmeester, D. |title=Towards quantum superpositions of a mirror |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=91 |issue=13 |page=130401 |year=2003 |pmid=14525288 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.130401|arxiv = quant-ph/0210001 |bibcode = 2003PhRvL..91m0401M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, Penrose and Hameroff reported that the experiments had been carried out by Bandyopadhyay et al., supporting Penrose's theory on six out of his twenty theses, while invalidating none of the others. They subsequently responded to critiques, including a 2009 critique from a group led by Jeffrey Reimers.&lt;ref name="Penrose-Hameroff2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/discovery-of-quantum-vibrations-in-microtubules-inside-brain-neurons-corroborates-controversial-20-year-old-theory-of-consciousness |title=Discovery of quantum vibrations in microtubules inside brain neurons corroborates controversial 20-year-old theory of consciousness |work=KurzweilAI |date=2014-01-16 |accessdate=2014-02-01 }}

==The creation of the Orch-OR model==
Penrose and Hameroff initially developed their ideas quite separately from one another, and it was only in the 1990s that they cooperated to produce the Orch-OR theory.  Penrose came to the problem from the view point of mathematics and in particular [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]], while Hameroff approached it from a career in cancer research and [[anesthesia]] that had given him an interest in brain structures.  Specifically, when Penrose wrote his first consciousness book, ''The Emperor's New Mind'' in 1989, he lacked a detailed proposal for how such quantum processes could be implemented in the brain. Subsequently, Hameroff read ''The Emperor's New Mind'' and suggested to Penrose that certain structures within brain cells (neurons) were suitable candidate sites for quantum processing and ultimately for consciousness.&lt;ref name="Hameroff1982"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(82)90137-0 |author1=Hameroff, S.R. |author2=Watt, R.C.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Information processing in microtubules |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=98 |issue=4 |pages=549–561 |year=1982 |url= http://www.quantumconsciousness.org/documents/informationprocessing_hameroff_000.pdf |pmid=6185798}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hameroff1987"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hameroff, S.R. |title=Ultimate Computing |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |year=1987 |url=http://www.quantumconsciousness.org/ultimatecomputing.html |isbn=0-444-70283-0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406000209/http://www.quantumconsciousness.org/ultimatecomputing.html |archivedate=2005-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orch-OR theory arose from the cooperation of these two scientists, and was developed in Penrose's second consciousness book ''[[Shadows of the Mind]]'' (1994).&lt;ref name=Penrose1994/&gt;

Hameroff's contribution to the theory derived from studying brain cells. His interest centered on the [[cytoskeleton]], which provides an internal supportive structure for neurons, and particularly on the [[microtubule]]s,&lt;ref name=Hameroff1987/&gt; which are the most important component of the cytoskeleton. As neuroscience has progressed, the role of the cytoskeleton and microtubules has assumed greater importance. In addition to providing structural support, microtubule functions include [[axoplasmic transport]] and control of the cell's movement, growth and shape.&lt;ref name=Hameroff1987/&gt;

===Microtubule condensates===
Hameroff proposed that microtubules were suitable candidates for quantum processing.&lt;ref name=Hameroff1987/&gt; Microtubules are made up of [[tubulin]] [[protein]] subunits. The tubulin protein [[Dimer (biochemistry)|dimers]] of the microtubules have [[hydrophobic]] pockets that may contain delocalized [[π electron]]s. Tubulin has other, smaller non-polar regions, for example 8 [[tryptophan]]s per tubulin, which contain π electron-rich [[indole]] rings distributed throughout tubulin with separations of roughly 2&amp;nbsp;nm. Hameroff claims that this is close enough for the tubulin π electrons to become [[quantum entanglement|quantum entangled]].&lt;ref name=Hameroff_2007&gt;{{cite book |last=Hameroff |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart Hameroff |chapter=That's life! The geometry of π electron resonance clouds |title= Quantum aspects of life |editor-last=Abbott |editor1-first=D |editor2-last=Davies |editor2-first=P |editor3-last=Pati |editor3-first=A |url=http://www.quantumconsciousness.org/documents/Hameroff_received-1-05-07.pdf |year=2008 |publisher=World Scientific |pages=403–434 |accessdate=Jan 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During entanglement, particle states become inseparably correlated.

Hameroff originally suggested in the fringe ''[[Journal of Cosmology]]'' that the tubulin-subunit electrons would form a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]].&lt;ref name="Penrose-Hameroff2011"&gt;{{cite journal 
|author1=Roger Penrose  |author2=Stuart Hameroff  |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Consciousness in the Universe: Neuroscience, Quantum Space-Time Geometry and Orch OR Theory |journal= Journal of Cosmology |volume= 14 |issue= |pages= |year= 2011 |url= http://journalofcosmology.com/Consciousness160.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then proposed a [[Frohlich condensate]], a hypothetical coherent oscillation of dipolar molecules. However, this too was rejected by Reimers' group.&lt;ref name="Reimers2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reimers|first=Jeffrey R.|author2=McKemmish, Laura K. |author3=McKenzie, Ross H. |author4=Mark, Alan E. |author5= Hush, Noel S. |title=Weak, strong, and coherent regimes of Fröhlich condensation and their applications to terahertz medicine and quantum consciousness|journal=PNAS|date=17 March 2009|volume=106|issue=11|pages=4219–4224|doi=10.1073/pnas.0806273106|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/11/4219.full|pmid=19251667|bibcode = 2009PNAS..106.4219R|pmc=2657444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hameroff then responded to Reimers. "Reimers et al have most definitely NOT shown that strong or coherent Frohlich condensation in microtubules is unfeasible. The model microtubule on which they base their Hamiltonian is not a microtubule structure, but a simple linear chain of oscillators." Hameroff reasoned that such condensate behavior would magnify nanoscopic quantum effects to have large scale influences in the brain.

Hameroff proposed that condensates in microtubules in one [[neuron]] can link with microtubule condensates in other neurons and [[glial cell]]s via the [[gap junctions]] of [[electrical synapse]]s.&lt;ref name="Hameroff2006a"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00000542-200608000-00024 |author=Hameroff, S.R. |title=The entwined mysteries of anesthesia and consciousness |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=400–412 |year=2006 |pmid=16871075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hameroff2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hameroff, S. |title=The "conscious pilot"—dendritic synchrony moves through the brain to mediate consciousness |journal=Journal of Biological Physics |volume= 36 |pages= 71–93 |year=2009 |doi=10.1007/s10867-009-9148-x |pmid= 19669425 |issue= 1 |pmc= 2791805}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hameroff proposed that the gap between the cells is sufficiently small that quantum objects can [[quantum tunneling|tunnel]] across it, allowing them to extend across a large area of the brain. He further postulated that the action of this large-scale quantum activity is the source of 40&amp;nbsp;Hz [[gamma wave]]s, building upon the much less controversial theory that gap junctions are related to the gamma oscillation.&lt;ref name="Bennett&amp;Zukin2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bennett, M.V.L. |author2=Zukin, R.S.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Electrical Coupling and Neuronal Synchronization in the Mammalian Brain |journal=Neuron |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=495–511 |year=2004 |pmid=14980200 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(04)00043-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences===
The Orch-OR theory combines the Penrose–Lucas argument with Hameroff's hypothesis on quantum processing in microtubules. It proposes that when condensates in the brain undergo an objective wave function reduction, their collapse connects non-computational decision-making to experiences embedded in spacetime's fundamental geometry.

The theory further proposes that the microtubules both influence and are influenced by the conventional activity at the synapses between neurons.

In 1998 Hameroff made 8 probable assumptions and 20 testable predictions to back his proposal.&lt;ref name="Hameroff1998"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hameroff, S.R. |title=Quantum Computation In Brain Microtubules?

Landau at the Mathematics Department of King's College London writes that "Penrose's argument, its basis and implications, is rejected by experts in the fields which it touches."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgess"&gt;Princeton Philosophy professor John Burgess writes in ''[http://www.princeton.edu/~jburgess/Montreal.doc On the Outside Looking In: A Caution about Conservativeness]'' (published in Kurt Gödel: Essays for his Centennial, with the following comments found on [https://books.google.com/books?id=83Attf6BsJ4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 131–132]) that "the consensus view of logicians today seems to be that the Lucas–Penrose argument is fallacious, though as I have said elsewhere, there is at least this much to be said for Lucas and Penrose, that logicians are not unanimously agreed as to where precisely the fallacy in their argument lies. There are at least three points at which the argument may be attacked."&lt;/ref&gt; with different authors attacking different aspects of the argument.&lt;ref name="Burgess" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nachum Dershowitz|Dershowitz, Nachum]] 2005.

LaForte pointed out that in order to know the truth of an unprovable Gödel sentence, one must already know the formal system is consistent. Referencing [[Paul Benacerraf|Benacerraf]], he then demonstrated that humans cannot prove that they are consistent,&lt;ref name=laforte_1998/&gt; and in all likelihood human brains are inconsistent. He pointed to contradictions within Penrose's own writings as examples. Similarly, [[Marvin Minsky|Minsky]] argued that because humans can believe false ideas to be true, human mathematical understanding need not be consistent and consciousness may easily have a deterministic basis.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Minsky. "Conscious Machines." Machinery of Consciousness, Proceedings, National Research Council of Canada, 75th Anniversary Symposium on Science in Society, June 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solomon Feferman|Feferman]] faulted detailed points in Penrose's second book, ''Shadows of the Mind''. He argued that mathematicians do not progress by mechanistic search through proofs, but by trial-and-error reasoning, insight and inspiration, and that machines do not share this approach with humans. He pointed out that everyday mathematics can be formalized. He also rejected Penrose's [[Platonism]].&lt;ref name=solomon_1996/&gt;

[[John Searle|Searle]] criticized Penrose's appeal to Gödel as resting on the fallacy that all computational algorithms must be capable of mathematical description. As a counter-example, Searle cited the assignment of [[Vehicle registration plate|license plate number]]s to specific [[vehicle identification number]]s, as part of vehicle registration. According to Searle, no mathematical function can be used to connect a known VIN with its LPN, but the process of assignment is quite simple—namely, [[First-come, first-served|"first come, first served"]]—and can be performed entirely by a computer.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John R. ''The Mystery of Consciousness''. 1997. {{ISBN|0-940322-06-4}}. pp 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since an algorithm (as defined in the Oxford American Dictionary) is a 'set of rules to be followed in calculations or problem-solving operations', the assignment of LPN to a VIN is not an algorithm as such, merely the use of a database in which every VIN has a corresponding LPN. No algorithm could arbitrarily 'compute' database assignments. Thus, Searle's counter-example does not describe a computational algorithm that is not mathematically describable.{{original research inline|date=September 2018}}

===Decoherence in living organisms===
In 2000 [[Max Tegmark|Tegmark]] claimed that any quantum coherent system in the brain would undergo effective [[wave function collapse]] due to environmental interaction long before it could influence neural processes (the ''"warm, wet and noisy"'' argument, as it was later came to be known).&lt;ref name=Tegmark2000/&gt; He determined the decoherence timescale of microtubule entanglement at brain temperatures to be on the order of [[femtosecond]]s, far too brief for neural processing. [[Christof Koch]] and [[Klaus Hepp]] also agreed that [[Coherence_(physics)#Quantum_coherence|quantum coherence]] does not play, or does not need to play any major role in [[neurophysiology]].&lt;ref name=Koch2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hepp2012/&gt; Koch and Hepp concluded that ''``The empirical demonstration of slowly decoherent and controllable quantum bits in neurons connected by electrical or chemical synapses, or the discovery of an efficient quantum algorithm for computations performed by the brain, would do much to bring these speculations from the ‘far-out’ to the mere ‘very unlikely’.''''&lt;ref name=Koch2006/&gt;

In response to Tegmark's claims, Hagan, Tuszynski and Hameroff&lt;ref name="Hagan2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.65.061901 |author=Hagan, S., Hameroff, S., and Tuszyński, J. |title=Quantum Computation in Brain Microtubules?

This involved superpositions of quanta separated by 24&amp;nbsp;nm rather than the much smaller separations stipulated for Orch-OR. As a result, Hameroff's group claimed a decoherence time seven orders of magnitude greater than Tegmark's, although still far below 25&amp;nbsp;ms. Hameroff's group also suggested that the [[Debye force|Debye]] layer of [[counterion]]s could screen thermal fluctuations, and that the surrounding actin [[gel]] might enhance the ordering of water, further screening noise. They also suggested that incoherent metabolic energy could further order water, and finally that the configuration of the microtubule lattice might be suitable for [[quantum error correction]], a means of resisting quantum decoherence.

Since the 1990s numerous counter-observations to the "warm, wet and noisy" argument existed at ambient temperatures, ''in vitro''&lt;ref name=elsevier2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bandyopadhyay2013A" /&gt; and ''in vivo'' (i.e. [[photosynthesis]], [[bird navigation]]).

In 2007, Gregory S. Engel, Professor in Chemistry at The University of Chicago, claimed that all arguments concerning the brain being "too warm and wet" have been dispelled, as multiple "warm and wet" quantum processes have been discovered.&lt;ref name="Engel2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Panitchayangkoon|first=Gitt|author2=Dugan Hayes |author3=Kelly A.

In 2009, Reimers ''et al.'' and McKemmish ''et al.,'' published critical assessments.&lt;ref name=" McKemmish2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reimers2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reimers2013"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Jeffrey |last1=Reimers |first2=Laura |last2=McKemmish |first3=Ross |last3=McKenziec |first4=Alan |last4=Markd |first5=Noel  |last5=Hush |title=The revised Penrose-Hameroff orchestrated objective-reduction proposal for human consciousness is not scientifically justified: Comment on "Consciousness in the universe: A review of the 'Orch OR' theory" by Hameroff and Penrose.|doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2013.11.003 |url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1571064513001619/1-s2.0-S1571064513001619-main.pdf?_tid=adf99c88-4378-11e4-ab1c-00000aab0f6c&amp;acdnat=1411514812_3e2e308655e46e5d6e69dff2d6c41e46 |journal=Physics of Life Reviews |volume=11 |issue=2014 |pages=101–103 |accessdate=24 Sep 2014 |bibcode=2014PhLRv..11..101R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier versions of the theory had required tubulin-electrons to form either [[Bose–Einstein condensate|Bose–Einstein]]s or [[Herbert Fröhlich|Frohlich]] condensates, and the Reimers group claimed that these were experimentally unfounded. Additionally they claimed that microtubules could only support 'weak' 8&amp;nbsp;MHz coherence. The first argument was voided by revisions of the theory that described dipole oscillations due to [[London forces]] and possibly due to magnetic and/or nuclear spin cloud formations.&lt;ref name="HameroffVs7Others2014" /&gt; On the second issue the theory was retrofitted so that 8&amp;nbsp;MHz coherence is sufficient to support the whole Orch-OR hypothesis.

McKemmish ''et al.'' made two claims: that aromatic molecules cannot switch states because they are delocalised; and that changes in tubulin protein-conformation driven by [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] conversion would result in a prohibitive energy requirement. Hameroff and Penrose responded to the first claim by stating that they were referring to the behaviour of two or more electron clouds, inherently non-localised. For the second claim they stated that no GTP conversion is needed since (in that version of the theory) the conformation-switching is not necessary, replaced by oscillation due to the [[London force]]s produced by the electron cloud dipole states.

===Neuron cell biology===
[[Image:Orch_OR.PNG|300px|right|thumb|The presented neuronal reconstrucions illustrate Hameroff's miscalculation of the number of tubulins per neuron upon which he based Orch OR.&lt;ref name="Georgiev2009a"/&gt; Hameroff frequently writes: ``''A typical brain neuron has roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; tubulins (Yu and Baas, 1994),''" yet this is Hameroff's own invention, which should not be attributed to Yu and Baas.&lt;ref name="YuBaas1994"/&gt; Hameroff apparently misunderstood that Yu and Baas actually ``''reconstructed the microtubule (MT) arrays of a 56 μm axon from a cell that had undergone axon differentiation''" and this reconstructed axon ``''contained 1430 MTs ... and the total MT length was 5750 μm.''"&lt;ref name="YuBaas1994"/&gt; A direct calculation shows that 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; tubulins (to be precise 9.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; tubulins) correspond to this MT length of 5750 μm inside the 56 μm axon.]]

Hameroff's 1998 hypothesis required that cortical [[dendrites]] contain primarily 'A' lattice microtubules,&lt;ref name="Hameroff1998"/&gt; but in 1994 Kikkawa ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Kikkawa1994"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kikkawa, M., Ishikawa, T., Nakata, T., Wakabayashi, T., Hirokawa, N. |title=Direct visualization of the microtubule lattice seam both in vitro and in vivo |journal=Journal of Cell Biology |volume=127 |issue=6|pages=1965–1971 |year=1994|pmid=7806574 |url=http://jcb.rupress.org/cgi/content/abstract/127/6/1965 |pmc=2120284 |doi= 10.1083/jcb.127.6.1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kikkawa2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kikkawa, M., Metlagel, Z. |title=A molecular "zipper" for microtubules |journal=Cell |volume=127 |issue=7 |pages=1302–1304 |year=2006 |pmid=17190594 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.12.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that all ''in vivo'' microtubules have a 'B' lattice and a seam.

Orch-OR also required [[gap junctions]] between neurons and glial cells,&lt;ref name="Hameroff1998"/&gt; yet Binmöller ''et. al.'' proved in 1992 that these don't exist  ''in the adult brain''.&lt;ref name="Binmoller1992"&gt;{{cite journal  |author1=F.

&lt;/ref&gt;, however, the Orch OR claim is that ''mature'' neurons are electrotonically coupled to astrocytes in the adult brain. Therefore, Orch OR contradicts the well-documented ''electrotonic decoupling'' of neurons from astrocytes in the process of neuronal [[Cellular_differentiation|maturation]], which is stated by Fróes ''et al.'' as follows: ``''junctional communication may provide metabolic and electrotonic interconnections between neuronal and astrocytic networks '''at early stages of neural development''' and such interactions '''are weakened as differentiation progresses'''''.''&lt;ref name="Froes1999"/&gt;

In 2001, Hameroff further proposed that microtubule coherence spreads between different neurons via [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22329032 dendritic lamellar bodies] (DLBs) that are connected directly with gap junctions.&lt;ref name="Hameroff2001"&gt;{{cite journal

Hameroff speculated that visual photons in the [[retina]] are detected directly by the [[cone cell|cones]] and [[rod cell|rods]] instead of decohering and subsequently connect with the retinal [[glia cells]] via gap junctions,&lt;ref name="Hameroff1998"/&gt; but this too was falsified.&lt;ref name="Georgiev2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Georgiev, D. |title=Photons do collapse in the retina not in the brain cortex: Evidence from visual illusions |journal=Neuroquantology |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=206–231 |year=2011 |arxiv=quant-ph/0208053|bibcode = 2002quant.ph..8053G |doi=10.14704/nq.2011.9.2.403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While such ideas have been central to philosophy from its inception, the philosophy of space and time was both an inspiration for and a central aspect of early [[analytic philosophy]]. The subject focuses on a number of basic issues, including whether time and space exist independently of the mind, whether they exist independently of one another, what accounts for time's apparently unidirectional flow, whether times other than the present moment exist, and questions about the nature of identity (particularly the nature of identity over time).

==Ancient and medieval views==
The earliest recorded [[Western philosophy]] of [[time]] was expounded by the [[ancient Egypt]]ian thinker [[Ptahhotep]] (c. 2650–2600 BC) who said:

The ''[[Vedas]]'', the earliest texts on [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Hindu philosophy]], dating back to the late [[2nd millennium BC]], describe ancient [[Hindu cosmology]], in which the [[universe]] goes through repeated cycles of creation, destruction, and rebirth, with each cycle lasting 4,320,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cosmology of the Bhagavata Purana: Mysteries of the Sacred Universe |first1=Richard L. |last1=Thompson |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-81-208-1919-1 |page=225 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TZmDSr-1msC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3TZmDSr-1msC&amp;pg=PA225  Extract of page 225]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient philosophy|Ancient]] [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]], including [[Parmenides]] and [[Heraclitus]], wrote essays on the nature of time.&lt;ref&gt;Dagobert Runes, ''Dictionary of Philosophy'', p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]], in the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', identified time with the period of motion of the heavenly bodies, and space as that in which things come to be. [[Aristotle]], in Book IV of his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', defined time as the number of changes with respect to before and after, and the place of an object as the innermost motionless boundary of that which surrounds it.

In Book 11 of [[St. Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine's]] ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'', he ruminates on the nature of time, asking, "What then is time? If no one asks me, I know: if I wish to explain it to one that asketh, I know not." He goes on to comment on the difficulty of thinking about time, pointing out the inaccuracy of common speech: "For but few things are there of which we speak properly; of most things we speak improperly, still the things intended are understood."&lt;ref&gt;St. Augustine, ''Confessions'', Book 11. http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/augconf/aug11.htm (Accessed 19/5/14).&lt;/ref&gt;  But Augustine presented the first philosophical argument for the reality of Creation (against Aristotle) in the context of his discussion of time,  saying that knowledge of time depends on the knowledge of the movement of things,  and therefore time cannot be where there are no creatures to measure its passing (Confessions Book XI ¶30; [[The City of God|City of God]] Book XI ch.6).

In contrast to ancient Greek philosophers who believed that the universe had an infinite past with no beginning, [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] and [[Theology|theologians]] developed the concept of the universe having a finite past with a beginning, now known as [[Temporal finitism]]. The [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]] [[John Philoponus]] presented early arguments, adopted by later Christian philosophers and theologians of the form "argument from the impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite", which states:&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Whitrow and Popper on the Impossibility of an Infinite Past|first=William Lane|last=Craig|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|volume=30|issue=2|date=June 1979|pages=165–170 [165–6]|doi=10.1093/bjps/30.2.165|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"An actual infinite cannot exist."
:"An infinite temporal regress of events is an actual infinite."
:"∴ An infinite temporal regress of events cannot exist."

In the early 11th century, the [[Islamic physics|Muslim physicist]] [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen or Alhazen) discussed [[Depth perception|space perception]] and its [[Epistemology|epistemological]] implications in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021). He also rejected Aristotle's definition of ''topos'' (''Physics'' IV) by way of geometric demonstrations and defined place as a mathematical spatial extension.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nader El-Bizri]], 'In Defence of the Sovereignty of Philosophy: al-Baghdadi's Critique of Ibn al-Haytham's Geometrisation of Place', ''Arabic Sciences and Philosophy'' 17 (2007), 57–80&lt;/ref&gt; His [[experiment]]al proof of the intro-mission model of vision led to changes in the understanding of the [[visual perception]] of space, contrary to the previous [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory of vision]] supported by [[Euclid]] and [[Ptolemy]]. In "tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience, Alhacen unequivocally rejected the intuitiveness of spatial perception and, therefore, the autonomy of vision. Without tangible notions of distance and size for correlation, sight can tell us next to nothing about such things."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=A.

==Realism and anti-realism==
A traditional [[Philosophical realism|realist]] position in [[ontology]] is that time and space have existence apart from the human mind. [[Idealism|Idealists]], by contrast, deny or doubt the existence of objects independent of the mind. Some [[anti-realism|anti-realists]], whose ontological position is that objects outside the mind do exist, nevertheless doubt the independent existence of time and space.

In 1781, [[Immanuel Kant]] published the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', one of the most influential works in the history of the philosophy of space and time. He describes time as an ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' notion that, together with other ''a priori'' notions such as [[space]], allows us to comprehend [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]. Kant denies that neither space or time are [[Substance theory|substance]], entities in themselves, or learned by experience; he holds, rather, that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to structure our experience. Spatial [[measurement]]s are used to [[quantity|quantify]] how far apart [[Physical body|object]]s are, and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare the interval between (or duration of) [[Spacetime#Basic concepts|event]]s. Although space and time are held to be ''transcendentally ideal'' in this sense, they are also ''empirically real''—that is, not mere illusions.

Some idealist writers, such as [[J. M. E. McTaggart]] in ''[[The Unreality of Time]]'', have argued that time is an illusion (see also [[Philosophy of space and time#The flow of time|The flow of time]], below).

The writers discussed here are for the most part realists in this regard; for instance, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] held that his [[monadology|monad]]s existed, at least independently of the mind of the observer.

==Absolutism and relationalism==

===Leibniz and Newton&lt;!--linked from 'Adolf Grünbaum'--&gt;===
The great debate between defining notions of space and time as real objects themselves (absolute), or mere orderings upon actual objects ([[relationalism|relational]]), began between physicists [[Isaac Newton]] (via his spokesman, Samuel Clarke) and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]] in the papers of the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]].

Arguing against the absolutist position, Leibniz offers a number of [[thought experiment]]s with the purpose of showing that there is contradiction in assuming the existence of facts such as absolute location and velocity. These arguments trade heavily on two principles central to his philosophy: the [[principle of sufficient reason]] and the [[identity of indiscernibles]]. The principle of sufficient reason holds that for every fact, there is a reason that is sufficient to explain what and why it is the way it is and not otherwise. The identity of indiscernibles states that if there is no way of telling two entities apart, then they are one and the same thing.

The example Leibniz uses involves two proposed universes situated in absolute space. The only discernible difference between them is that the latter is positioned five feet to the left of the first. The example is only possible if such a thing as absolute space exists. Such a situation, however, is not possible, according to Leibniz, for if it were, a universe's position in absolute space would have no sufficient reason, as it might very well have been anywhere else. Therefore, it contradicts the principle of sufficient reason, and there could exist two distinct universes that were in all ways indiscernible, thus contradicting the identity of indiscernibles.

Standing out in Clarke's (and Newton's) response to Leibniz's arguments is the [[bucket argument]]: Water in a bucket, hung from a rope and set to spin, will start with a flat surface. As the water begins to spin in the bucket, the surface of the water will become concave. If the bucket is stopped, the water will continue to spin, and while the spin continues, the surface will remain concave. The concave surface is apparently not the result of the interaction of the bucket and the water, since the surface is flat when the bucket first starts to spin, it becomes concave as the water starts to spin, and it remains concave as the bucket stops.

In this response, Clarke argues for the necessity of the existence of [[absolute space]] to account for phenomena like rotation and acceleration that cannot be accounted for on a purely [[relationalism|relationalist account]]. Clarke argues that since the curvature of the water occurs in the rotating bucket as well as in the stationary bucket containing spinning water, it can only be explained by stating that the water is rotating in relation to the presence of some third thing—absolute space.

Leibniz describes a space that exists only as a relation between objects, and which has no existence apart from the existence of those objects. Motion exists only as a relation between those objects. Newtonian space provided the absolute frame of reference within which objects can have motion. In Newton's system, the frame of reference exists independently of the objects contained within it. These objects can be described as moving in relation to space itself. For almost two centuries, the evidence of a concave water surface held authority.

===Mach===
Another important figure in this debate is 19th-century physicist [[Ernst Mach]]. While he did not deny the existence of phenomena like that seen in the bucket argument, he still denied the absolutist conclusion by offering a different answer as to what the bucket was rotating in relation to: the [[fixed stars]].

Mach suggested that thought experiments like the bucket argument are problematic. If we were to imagine a universe that only contains a bucket, on Newton's account, this bucket could be set to spin relative to absolute space, and the water it contained would form the characteristic concave surface. But in the absence of anything else in the universe, it would be difficult to confirm that the bucket was indeed spinning. It seems equally possible that the surface of the water in the bucket would remain flat.

Mach argued that, in effect, the water experiment in an otherwise empty universe would remain flat. But if another object were introduced into this universe, perhaps a distant star, there would now be something relative to which the bucket could be seen as rotating. The water inside the bucket could possibly have a slight curve. To account for the curve that we observe, an increase in the number of objects in the universe also increases the curvature in the water. Mach argued that the momentum of an object, whether angular or linear, exists as a result of the sum of the effects of other objects in the universe ([[Mach's Principle]]).

===Einstein===
[[Albert Einstein]] proposed that the laws of physics should be based on the [[principle of relativity]]. This principle holds that the rules of physics must be the same for all observers, regardless of the frame of reference that is used, and that light propagates at the same speed in all reference frames. This theory was motivated by [[Maxwell's equations]], which show that electromagnetic waves propagate in a vacuum at the [[speed of light]]. However, Maxwell's equations give no indication of what this speed is relative to. Prior to Einstein, it was thought that this speed was relative to a fixed medium, called the [[luminiferous ether]]. In contrast, the theory of special relativity postulates that light propagates at the speed of light in all inertial frames, and examines the implications of this postulate.

All attempts to measure any speed relative to this ether failed, which can be seen as a confirmation of Einstein's postulate that light propagates at the same speed in all reference frames. [[Special relativity]] is a formalization of the principle of relativity that does not contain a privileged inertial frame of reference, such as the luminiferous ether or absolute space, from which Einstein inferred that no such frame exists.

Einstein generalized relativity to frames of reference that were non-inertial. He achieved this by positing the [[equivalence principle|Equivalence Principle]], which states that the force felt by an observer in a given gravitational field and that felt by an observer in an accelerating frame of reference are indistinguishable. This led to the conclusion that the mass of an object warps the geometry of the space-time surrounding it, as described in [[Einstein's field equation]]s.

In classical physics, an inertial reference frame is one in which an object that experiences no forces does not accelerate. In general relativity, an inertial frame of reference is one that is following a [[Geodesic (general relativity)|geodesic]] of space-time. An object that moves against a geodesic experiences a force. An object in [[free fall]] does not experience a force, because it is following a geodesic. An object standing on the earth, however, will experience a force, as it is being held against the geodesic by the surface of the planet.

Einstein partially advocates [[Mach's principle]] in that distant stars explain inertia because they provide the gravitational field against which acceleration and inertia occur. But contrary to Leibniz's account, this warped space-time is as integral a part of an object as are its other defining characteristics, such as volume and mass. If one holds, contrary to idealist beliefs, that objects exist independently of the mind, it seems that relativistics commits them to also hold that space and temporality have exactly the same type of independent existence.

==Conventionalism==
The position of conventionalism states that there is no fact of the matter as to the geometry of space and time, but that it is decided by convention. The first proponent of such a view, [[Henri Poincaré]], reacting to the creation of the new [[non-Euclidean geometry]], argued that which geometry applied to a space was decided by convention, since different geometries will describe a set of objects equally well, based on considerations from his [[sphere-world]].

This view was developed and updated to include considerations from relativistic physics by [[Hans Reichenbach]]. Reichenbach's conventionalism, applying to space and time, focuses around the idea of [[coordinative definition]].

Coordinative definition has two major features. The first has to do with coordinating units of length with certain physical objects. This is motivated by the fact that we can never directly apprehend length. Instead we must choose some physical object, say the Standard Metre at the [[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]] (International Bureau of Weights and Measures), or the [[wavelength]] of [[cadmium]] to stand in as our unit of length. The second feature deals with separated objects. Although we can, presumably, directly test the equality of length of two measuring rods when they are next to one another, we can not find out as much for two rods distant from one another. Even supposing that two rods, whenever brought near to one another are seen to be equal in length, we are not justified in stating that they are always equal in length. This impossibility undermines our ability to decide the equality of length of two distant objects. Sameness of length, to the contrary, must be set by definition.

Such a use of coordinative definition is in effect, on Reichenbach's conventionalism, in the General Theory of Relativity where light is assumed, i.e. not discovered, to mark out equal distances in equal times. After this setting of coordinative definition, however, the geometry of spacetime is set.

As in the absolutism/relationalism debate, contemporary philosophy is still in disagreement as to the correctness of the conventionalist doctrine.

==Structure of space-time==
{{unreferenced|section (and every subsection)|date=August 2018}}
Building from a mix of insights from the historical debates of absolutism and conventionalism as well as reflecting on the import of the technical apparatus of the General Theory of Relativity, details as to the structure of [[spacetime|space-time]] have made up a large proportion of discussion within the philosophy of space and time, as well as the [[philosophy of physics]]. The following is a short list of topics.

===Relativity of simultaneity===
According to [[special relativity]] each point in the universe can have a different set of events that compose its present instant. This has been used in the [[Rietdijk–Putnam argument]] to demonstrate that relativity predicts a [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|block universe]] in which events are fixed in four dimensions.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Invariance vs. covariance===
Bringing to bear the lessons of the absolutism/relationalism debate with the powerful mathematical tools invented in the 19th and 20th century, [[Michael Friedman (philosopher)|Michael Friedman]] draws a distinction between invariance upon mathematical [[Transformation (mathematics)|transformation]] and covariance upon transformation.

Invariance, or symmetry, applies to ''objects'', i.e. the [[symmetry group]] of a space-time theory designates what features of objects are invariant, or absolute, and which are dynamical, or variable.

Covariance applies to ''formulations'' of theories, i.e. the [[Group (mathematics)|covariance group]] designates in which range of [[coordinate system]]s the laws of physics hold.

This distinction can be illustrated by revisiting Leibniz's thought experiment, in which the universe is shifted over five feet. In this example the position of an object is seen not to be a property of that object, i.e. location is not invariant. Similarly, the covariance group for [[classical mechanics]] will be any coordinate systems that are obtained from one another by shifts in position as well as other translations allowed by a [[Galilean transformation]].

In the classical case, the invariance, or symmetry, group and the covariance group coincide, but they part ways in relativistic physics. The symmetry group of the general theory of relativity includes all differentiable transformations, i.e., all properties of an object are dynamical, in other words there are no absolute objects. The formulations of the general theory of relativity, unlike those of classical mechanics, do not share a standard, i.e., there is no single formulation paired with transformations. As such the covariance group of the general theory of relativity is just the covariance group of every theory.

===Historical frameworks===
A further application of the modern mathematical methods, in league with the idea of invariance and covariance groups, is to try to interpret historical views of space and time in modern, mathematical language.

In these translations, a theory of space and time is seen as a [[manifold]] paired with [[vector spaces]], the more vector spaces the more facts there are about objects in that theory. The historical development of spacetime theories is generally seen to start from a position where many facts about objects are incorporated in that theory, and as history progresses, more and more structure is removed.

For example, Aristotelian space and time has both absolute position and special places, such as the center of the cosmos, and the circumference. Newtonian space and time has absolute position and is [[Galilean invariance|Galilean invariant]], but does not have special positions.

===Holes===
With the general theory of relativity, the traditional debate between absolutism and relationalism has been shifted to whether spacetime is a substance, since the general theory of relativity largely rules out the existence of, e.g., absolute positions. One powerful argument against spacetime [[substantivalism]], offered by [[John Earman]] is known as the "[[hole argument]]".

This is a technical mathematical argument but can be paraphrased as follows:

Define a function ''d'' as the [[identity function]] over all elements over the manifold M, excepting a small [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] H belonging to M. Over H ''d'' comes to differ from identity by a [[smooth function]].

With use of this function ''d'' we can construct two [[mathematical model]]s, where the second is generated by applying ''d'' to proper elements of the first, such that the two models are identical prior to the time ''t''=0, where ''t'' is a time function created by a [[foliation]] of spacetime, but differ after ''t''=0.

These considerations show that, since substantivalism allows the construction of holes, that the universe must, on that view, be indeterministic. Which, Earman argues, is a case against substantivalism, as the case between determinism or indeterminism should be a question of physics, not of our commitment to substantivalism.

==Direction of time==
The problem of the [[Arrow of time|direction of time]] arises directly from two contradictory facts. Firstly, the fundamental physical laws are time-reversal [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]]; if a cinematographic film were taken of any process describable by means of the aforementioned laws and then played backwards, it would still portray a physically possible process. Secondly, our experience of time, at the [[macroscopic]] level, is ''not'' time-reversal invariant.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert, D.M. (2006) Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2nd Ed. Vol. 9. MI: Cengage Learning. P. 468.&lt;/ref&gt; Glasses can fall and break, but shards of glass cannot reassemble and fly up onto tables. We have memories of the past, and none of the future. We feel we can't change the past but can influence the future.

===Causation solution===
One solution to this problem takes a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] view, in which the direction of time follows from an asymmetry of [[Causality|causation]]. We know more about the past because the elements of the past are causes for the effect that is our perception. We feel we can't affect the past and can affect the future because we ''can't'' affect the past and ''can'' affect the future.

There are two main objections to this view. First is the problem of distinguishing the cause from the effect in a non-arbitrary way. The use of causation in constructing a temporal ordering could easily become circular. The second problem with this view is its explanatory power. While the causation account, if successful, may account for some time-asymmetric phenomena like perception and action, it does not account for many others.

However, asymmetry of causation can be observed in a non-arbitrary way which is not metaphysical in the case of a human hand dropping a cup of water which smashes into fragments on a hard floor, spilling the liquid. In this order, the causes of the resultant pattern of cup fragments and water spill is easily attributable in terms of the trajectory of the cup, irregularities in its structure, angle of its impact on the floor, etc. However, applying the same event in reverse, it is difficult to explain why the various pieces of the cup should fly up into the human hand and reassemble precisely into the shape of a cup, or why the water should position itself entirely within the cup. The causes of the resultant structure and shape of the cup and the encapsulation of the water by the hand within the cup are not easily attributable, as neither hand nor floor can achieve such formations of the cup or water. This asymmetry is perceivable on account of two features: i) the relationship between the agent capacities of the human hand (i.e., what it is and is not capable of and what it is for) and non-animal agency (i.e., what floors are and are not capable of and what they are for) and ii) that the pieces of cup came to possess exactly the nature and number of those of a cup before assembling. In short, such asymmetry is attributable to the relationship between i) temporal direction and ii) the implications of form and functional capacity.

The application of these ideas of form and functional capacity only dictates temporal direction in relation to complex scenarios involving specific, non-metaphysical agency which is not merely dependent on human perception of time. However, this last observation in itself is not sufficient to invalidate the implications of the example for the progressive nature of time in general.

===Thermodynamics solution===
The second major family of solutions to this problem, and by far the one that has generated the most literature, finds the existence of the direction of time as relating to the nature of thermodynamics.

The answer from classical [[thermodynamics]] states that while our basic physical theory is, in fact, time-reversal symmetric, thermodynamics is not. In particular, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the net [[entropy]] of a closed system never decreases, and this explains why we often see glass breaking, but not coming back together.

But in [[statistical mechanics]] things become more complicated. On one hand, statistical mechanics is far superior to classical thermodynamics, in that thermodynamic behavior, such as glass breaking, can be explained by the fundamental laws of physics paired with a [[statistical]] postulate. But statistical mechanics, unlike classical thermodynamics, is time-reversal symmetric. The second law of thermodynamics, as it arises in statistical mechanics, merely states that it is ''overwhelmingly'' likely that net entropy will increase, but it is not an absolute law.

Current thermodynamic solutions to the problem of the direction of time aim to find some further fact, or feature of the laws of nature to account for this discrepancy.

===Laws solution===
A third type of solution to the problem of the direction of time, although much less represented, argues that the laws are not time-reversal symmetric. For example, certain processes in [[quantum mechanics]], relating to the [[weak nuclear force]], are not time-reversible, keeping in mind that when dealing with quantum mechanics time-reversibility comprises a more complex definition. But this type of solution is insufficient because 1) the time-asymmetric phenomena in quantum mechanics are too few to account for the uniformity of macroscopic time-asymmetry and 2) it relies on the assumption that quantum mechanics is the final or correct description of physical processes.{{citation needed |date=April 2012}}

One recent proponent of the laws solution is [[Tim Maudlin]] who argues that the fundamental laws of physics are laws of temporal evolution (see Maudlin [2007]). However, elsewhere Maudlin argues: "[the] passage of time is an intrinsic asymmetry in the temporal structure of the world... It is the asymmetry that grounds the distinction between sequences that runs from past to future and sequences which run from future to past" [ibid, 2010 edition, p.&amp;nbsp;108]. Thus it is arguably difficult to assess whether Maudlin is suggesting that the direction of time is a consequence of the laws or is itself primitive.

==Flow of time==
The problem of the flow of time, as it has been treated in analytic philosophy, owes its beginning to a paper written by [[J. M. E. McTaggart]], in which he proposes two "temporal series". The first series, which means to account for our intuitions about temporal becoming, or the moving Now, is called the [[A-series and B-series|A-series]]. The A-series orders events according to their being in the past, present or future, ''simpliciter'' and in comparison to each other. The [[A-series and B-series|B-series]] eliminates all reference to the present, and the associated temporal modalities of past and future, and orders all events by the temporal relations ''earlier than'' and ''later than''.

McTaggart, in his paper "[[The Unreality of Time]]", argues that time is unreal since a) the A-series is inconsistent and b) the B-series alone cannot account for the nature of time as the A-series describes an essential feature of it.

Building from this framework, two camps of solution have been offered. The first, the A-theorist solution, takes becoming as the central feature of time, and tries to construct the B-series from the A-series by offering an account of how B-facts come to be out of A-facts. The second camp, the B-theorist solution, takes as decisive McTaggart's arguments against the A-series and tries to construct the A-series out of the B-series, for example, by temporal indexicals.

== Dualities ==
{{expand section|date=May 2016}}
[[Quantum field theory]] models have shown that it is possible for theories in two different space-time backgrounds, like [[AdS/CFT]] or [[T-duality]], to be equivalent.

==Presentism and eternalism==
{{Main|Presentism (philosophy of time)|Eternalism (philosophy of time)}}
According to [[Presentism (philosophy of time)|Presentism]], time is an ordering of various [[reality|realities]]. At a certain time some things exist and others do not. This is the only reality we can deal with and we cannot for example say that [[Homer]] exists because at the present time he does not. An [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|Eternalist]], on the other hand, holds that time is a dimension of reality on a par with the three spatial dimensions, and hence that all things&amp;mdash;past, present and future&amp;mdash;can be said to be just as real as things in the present. According to this theory, then, Homer really ''does'' exist, though we must still use special language when talking about somebody who exists at a distant time&amp;mdash;just as we would use special language when talking about something far away (the very words ''near'', ''far'', ''above'', ''below'', and such are directly comparable to phrases such as ''in the past'', ''a minute ago'', and so on).

==Endurantism and perdurantism==
{{Main|Endurantism|Perdurantism}}
The positions on the persistence of objects are somewhat similar. An [[endurantism|endurantist]] holds that for an object to persist through time is for it to exist completely at different times (each instance of existence we can regard as somehow separate from previous and future instances, though still numerically identical with them). A [[perdurantism|perdurantist]] on the other hand holds that for a thing to exist through time is for it to exist as a continuous reality, and that when we consider the thing as a whole we must consider an aggregate of all its "[[temporal part]]s" or instances of existing. Endurantism is seen as the conventional view and flows out of our pre-philosophical ideas (when I talk to somebody I think I am talking to that person as a complete object, and not just a part of a cross-temporal being), but perdurantists such as [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] have attacked this position. They argue that perdurantism is the superior view for its ability to take account of change in objects.

On the whole, [[Presentism (philosophy of time)|Presentists]] are also endurantists and [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|Eternalists]] are also perdurantists (and vice versa), but this is not a necessary relation and it is possible to claim, for instance, that time's passage indicates a series of ordered realities, but that objects within these realities somehow exist outside of the reality as a whole, even though the realities as wholes are not related. However, such positions are rarely adopted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1926">'''Police science''' is the study and research which deals with police work. Studies and research in [[criminology]], [[forensic science]], [[psychiatry]], [[psychology]], [[jurisprudence]], [[community policing]], [[criminal justice]], correctional administration and [[penology]] all come under this umbrella term 'police science'. It thus includes physical and social sciences.

==Scope==

===United Kingdom===
UK has developed the [[Police National Computer]] as a sophisticated intelligence tool that holds extensive data on criminals, vehicles and property, and accessible in a matter of seconds through over 30,000 terminals across the country.

[[PITO]] reports that a national fingerprint and [[DNA database]] has been developed containing over 3.4 million DNA profiles providing the police with an average of 3,000 matches a month. In 2004-5 there were over 40,000 matches.

The police use a wide range of technologies to curb road traffic offences like speeding and drunk driving including [[breathalyser]] devices, bus lane enforcement cameras, immobilisation devices, light signals devices and speed measuring devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/science-research/using-science/police-science-tech UK has developed new technologies for effective policing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726174111/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/science-research/using-science/police-science-tech/ |date=2008-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2899">'''Pride of workmanship''' is the gratifying sense of having done good work. It is an element of [[job satisfaction]]. 

One of the key principles in the philosophy of management consultant [[W. Edwards Deming#Key principles|W. Edwards Deming]] is that workers have a right to [[pride]] of [[workmanship]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
12a. Remove barriers that rob the hourly worker of his right to pride of workmanship. The responsibility of supervisors must be changed from sheer numbers to quality.

b. Remove barriers that rob people in management and in engineering of their right to pride of workmanship. This means, ''[[inter alia]]'', abolishment of the annual or merit rating and of [[management by objective]].{{sfn|Deming|2000|p=24}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Out of the Crisis'' (1982), Deming argues that pride of workmanship is more important to workers than "gymnasiums, tennis courts, and recreation areas,"{{sfn|Deming|2000|p=125}} and that barriers to pride of workmanship are a major obstacle to cost reduction and quality improvement.{{sfn|Deming|2000|p=83}}

Economist [[Thorstein Veblen]] advocated transferring control of industry from financial and business people to engineers, who were most likely to be driven by pride of workmanship and curiosity.{{sfn|Tool|1988|p=61}}

During the [[Industrial Revolution]], the factory system destroyed the workers' traditional way of life, depriving them of pride of workmanship, among other things. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, workers responded by destroying machines and factories in what were called the [[Luddite]] revolts.{{sfn|Hunt|2016|p=65}}

''Tibetan Mandala, Art and Practice (The Wheel of Time)''. New York: Konecky &amp; Konecky, 2004. {{ISBN|1-56852-473-0}}. pp.20-26&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Sera Monastery]]]]
{{for|the Buddhist practice community|Shambhala Buddhism}}
In [[Hinduism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] tradition '''Shambhala''' ({{lang-sa|शम्भलः}} ''{{IAST|Śambhalaḥ}}'', also spelled '''Shambala''' or '''Shamballa'''; {{bo|t=བདེ་འབྱུང|w=bde 'byung}}; {{zh|c=香巴拉|p=xiāngbālā}}) is a mythical [[monarchy|kingdom]]. The kingdom is said to be laid out in precisely the same form as an eight-petalled lotus blossom surrounded by a chain of snow mountains. At the centre lies the palace of the King of Shambala who governed from the city called [[Kalapa]]. Shambhala is also often called Shangri-la in some texts. &lt;ref&gt;Leepage, V (1996) Shambhala: The Fascinating Truth Behind the Myth of Shangri-la. Theosophical Publishing House, Illinois.pp 23-4 &lt;/ref&gt;

Shambhala  is mentioned in various ancient texts, including the ''[[Kalachakra|Kalacakra Tantra]]''&lt;ref&gt;The Tantra by Victor M. Fic, Abhinav Publications, 2003, p.49.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ancient [[Zhangzhung]] texts of western [[Tibet]]. The [[Bon]] scriptures speak of a closely related land called [[Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring]].&lt;ref&gt;The Bon Religion of Tibet by Per Kavǣrne, Shambhala, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts such as the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' (4.24) mention the village Shambhala as the birthplace of [[Kalki]], the final incarnation of [[Vishnu]], who will usher in a new Age ([[Satya Yuga]]).&lt;ref name=Hindu&gt;{{cite book|last=LePage|first=Victoria|title=Shambhala: The Fascinating Truth Behind the Myth of Shangri-La|year=1996|publisher=Quest Books|isbn=9780835607506|pages=125–126|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oUIum8H_9qgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever its historical basis, Shambhala (spelling derived from Buddhist transliterations) gradually came to be seen as a Buddhist [[pure land]], a fabulous kingdom whose reality is visionary or spiritual as much as physical or geographic. It was in this form that the Shambhala myth reached [[Western Europe]] and [[the Americas]], where it influenced non-Buddhist as well as Buddhist spiritual seekers—and, to some extent, popular culture in general.

==In the Buddhist Kalachakra teachings==
[[File:Rigdan Tagpa.jpg|thumb|right|220 px|Manjuśrīkīrti, [[Kings of Shambhala|King of Shambhala]]]]
{{main|Kalachakra}}
Shambhala is ruled over by [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha. The ''Kalacakra tantra'' prophesies that when the world declines into war and greed, and all is lost, the 25th Kalki king will emerge from Shambhala with a huge army to vanquish "Dark Forces" and usher in a worldwide [[Golden Age]]. Using calculations from the Kalachakra Tantra, Alex Berzin puts this date at 2424.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/vajrayana/kalachakra-advanced/overview-of-kalachakra |title=Taking the Kalachakra Initiation | accessdate =2016-06-20 |last=Berzin |first=Alexander |authorlink=|year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manjuśrīkīrti is said to have been born in 159 BC and ruled over a kingdom of 300,510 followers of the [[Mlechha]] religion, some of whom worshipped the sun. He is said to have expelled 20,000 people from his domain who clung to 'Surya Samadhi' (sun realization) rather than convert to Kalachakra (Wheel of Time) Buddhism. 
[[File:Alti-Himalayan Shaman -1812-1813.jpg|thumbnail|Portrait of an Alti Himalian Shaman. Detail from "A Sorceress from Tungusy" 1812–1813   by: E. Karnejeff]]
These expelled Rishis, seers, sages and saints, who had realized truth and eternal knowledge exclaimed, "''We want to remain true to our Sun-Chariot. We do not wish to give up our belief system to change to another."'' This shows there may have been a fundamental difference between the 2 time-cycle-based doctrines. After realizing these were the wisest and best of his people and how much he was in need of them, he later asked them to return. Some did. Those who did not return were said to have set up another magical city elsewhere, the Shambhallah of mystic legend. Manjuśrīkīrti initiated the preaching of the ''Kalachakra'' teachings in order to try to convert those who returned and all still under his rule. In 59 BC he abdicated his throne to his son, Puṇḍārika, and died soon afterward, entering the [[sambhogakaya]] of [[buddhahood]] and was made a posthumous Buddhist saint.&lt;ref&gt;Das, Sarat Chandra (1882). ''Contributions to the Religion and History of Tibet'', in ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'', Vol. LI. Reprint: Manjushri Publishing House, Delhi. 1970, pp. 81–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Bernbaum "The Way to Shambhala: A Search for the Mythical Kingdom Beyond the Himalayas" 1980 &amp; Albert Grünwedel "Der Weg nach Shambhala" 1915&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western receptions and interpretations ==

Some westerners have been fascinated with the idea of Shambhala, often based on fragmentary accounts from the Kalachakra tradition. Tibet and its ancient traditions were largely unknown to westerners until the twentieth century; whatever little information westerners received was haphazard at best.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Donald S. Jr. ''Prisoners of Shangri~La, Tibetan Buddhism and the West'', The University of Chicago Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The first information that reached western civilization about Shambhala came from the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Catholic missions|Catholic missionary]] [[Estêvão Cacella]], who had heard about Shambhala (which he transcribed as "Xembala"), and thought it was another name for [[Cathay]] or China. In 1627 they headed to [[Tashilhunpo]], the seat of the [[Panchen Lama]] and, discovering their mistake, returned to India.&lt;ref&gt;Bernbaum, Edwin. (1980). ''The Way to Shambhala'', pp. 18-19. Reprint: (1989). Jeremy P. Tarcher, Inc., Los Angeles. {{ISBN|0-87477-518-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Altai Mountains]] folklore [[Gora Belukha|Mount Belukha]] is also believed to be a gateway to Shambhala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-places-asia/mysteries-kingdom-shambhala-001529|title=Mysteries of the Kingdom of Shambhala|first=|last=aprilholloway|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hungarian scholar [[Sándor Kőrösi Csoma]], writing in 1833, provided the first geographic account of "a fabulous country in the north...situated between 45' and 50' north latitude". Due north from India to between these latitudes is eastern [[Kazakhstan]], which is characterized by green hills, low mountains, rivers, and lakes. This is in contrast to the landscape of the provinces of Tibet and Xinjiang in western China, which are high mountains and arid.

== Theosophy ==

During the late-19th century, [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical Society]] co-founder [[Helena Blavatsky]] alluded to the Shambhala myth, giving it currency for Western [[occult]] enthusiasts. Blavatsky, who claimed to be in contact with a [[Great White Brotherhood|Great White Lodge]] of Himalayan Adepts, mentions Shambhala in several places, but without giving it especially great emphasis.

Later [[esotericism|esoteric]] writers further emphasized and elaborated on the concept of a hidden land inhabited by a [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|hidden mystic brotherhood]] whose members labor for the good of humanity. [[Alice A. Bailey]] claims Shamballa (her spelling) is an extra-dimensional or spiritual reality on the [[etheric plane]], a spiritual centre where the governing [[deity]] of [[Earth]], [[Sanat Kumara]], dwells as the highest [[Avatar]] of the Planetary [[Logos]] of Earth, and is said to be an expression of the Will of God.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A, ''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' 1932 Lucis Trust. 1925, p 753&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expeditions ==

[[Nicholas Roerich|Nicholas]] and [[Helena Roerich]] led a 1924–1928 expedition aimed at Shambhala.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Kenneth. ''Roerich East &amp; West''. Parkstone Press 1999, p.94&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|Theosophical]] lore and several visiting Mongol lamas, [[Gleb Bokii]], the chief Bolshevik [[cryptographer]] and one of the bosses of the [[Soviet secret police]], along with his writer friend Alexander Barchenko, embarked on a quest for Shambhala, in an attempt to merge Kalachakra-tantra and ideas of Communism in the 1920s. Among other things, in a secret laboratory affiliated with the secret police, Bokii and Barchenko experimented with Buddhist spiritual techniques to try to find a key for engineering perfect communist human beings.&lt;ref name="Znamenski"&gt;Znamenski (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; They contemplated a special expedition to Inner Asia to retrieve the wisdom of Shambhala - the project fell through as a result of intrigues within the Soviet intelligence service, as well as rival efforts of the Soviet Foreign Commissariat that sent its own expedition to Tibet in 1924.

== Modern times ==

French Buddhist [[Alexandra David-Néel]] associated Shambhala with [[Balkh]] in present-day Afghanistan, also offering the Persian ''Sham-i-Bala'', "elevated candle" as an etymology of its name.&lt;ref&gt;David-Néel, A. ''[[Les Nouvelles littéraires]]'' ;1954, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, the [[Gurdjieff]]ian [[J. G. Bennett]] published speculation that Shambalha was ''Shams-i-Balkh'', a [[Bactria]]n sun temple.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, J.G: "Gurdjieff: Making a New World". Bennett notes [[Idries Shah]] as the source of the suggestion.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Western culture ==
Shambhala may have been the inspiration for [[Shangri-La]], a paradise on Earth hidden in a Tibetan valley, which features in the 1933 [[novel]] ''[[Lost Horizon]]'' by British author [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]].&lt;ref name="Wood11"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wood|first1=Michael|title=BBC - History - Ancient History in depth: Shangri-La|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/cultures/shangri_la_01.shtml|accessdate=28 February 2018|work=BBC|date=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The textual evidence indicates a multiplicity of perspectives on these issues including probable changes during the centuries in which the biblical corpus developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Disembodied Souls: The Nefesh in Israel and Kindred Spirits in the Ancient Near East, with an Appendix on the Katumuwa Inscription|last=Steiner,|first=Richard C.|publisher=SBL Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=Atlanta|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical developments ==
The traditional concept of an immaterial and [[Immortality of the soul|immortal soul]] distinct from the body was not found in [[Judaism]] before the [[Babylonian exile]],&lt;ref name="Tabor" /&gt; but developed as a result of interaction with [[Persian philosophy|Persian]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic]] philosophies.&lt;ref name="thompson" /&gt; Accordingly, the Hebrew word {{Hebrew|נֶ֫פֶשׁ}}, ''[[nephesh]]'', although translated as "soul" in some older English Bibles, actually has a meaning closer to "living being". ''Nephesh'' was rendered in the [[Septuagint]] as ''{{lang|grc|ψυχή}}'' ([[Psyche (psychology)#Etymology|''psūchê'']]), the Greek word for soul. The New Testament also uses the word ''{{lang|grc|ψυχή}}'', but with the Hebrew meaning and not the Greek.&lt;ref&gt;''Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to Greek "psyche"==
The only Hebrew word traditionally translated "soul" (''nephesh'') in English language Bibles refers to a living, breathing conscious body, rather than to an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;"Even as we are conscious of the broad and very common biblical usage of the term "soul," we must be clear that scripture does not present even a rudimentarily developed theology of the soul. The creation narrative is clear that all life originates with God. Yet the Hebrew scripture offers no specific understanding of the origin of individual souls, of when and how they become attached to specific bodies, or of their potential existence, apart from the body, after death. The reason for this is that, as we noted at the beginning, the Hebrew Bible does not present a theory of the soul developed much beyond the simple concept of a force associated with respiration, hence, a life-force.", Avery-Peck, "Soul", in Neusner, et al. (eds.), "The Encyclopedia of Judaism", p. 1343 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Testament, the Greek word traditionally translated "soul" ({{lang|grc|ψυχή}}) "psyche", has substantially the same meaning as the Hebrew, without reference to an immortal soul. In the Greek Septuagent psyche is used to translate each instance of nephesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=In the nt, ‘soul’ retains its basic Hebrew field of meaning. Soul refers to one’s life: Herod sought Jesus’ soul (Matt. 2:20); one might save a soul or take it (Mark 3:4). Death occurs when God ‘requires your soul’ (Luke 12:20). ‘Soul’ may refer to the whole person, the self: ‘three thousand souls’ were converted in Acts 2:41 (see Acts 3:23). Although the Greek idea of an immortal soul different in kind from the mortal body is not evident, ‘soul’ denotes the existence of a person after death (see Luke 9:25; 12:4; 21:19); yet Greek influence may be found in 1 Peter’s remark about ‘the salvation of souls’ (1:9). A moderate dualism exists in the contrast of spirit with body and even soul, where ‘soul’ means life that is not yet caught up in grace.

==Genesis 2:7==
According to {{bibleref2|Genesis|2:7}} God did not make a body and put a soul into it like a letter into an envelope of dust; rather he formed man's body from the dust, then, by breathing divine breath into it, he made the body of dust live, i.e. the dust did not ''embody'' a soul, but it ''became'' a soul—a whole creature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Berry  | first = Wendell  | editor1-last = Wolfe| editor1-first = Gregory| title = The New Religious Humanists| year =  1997| publisher = The Free press  | pages  = 253| chapter = Christianity and the Survival of Creation  | chapterurl =https://books.google.com/books?id=2OKiszvwvikC&amp;pg=PA253&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;dq=body+plus+breath+of+life+equals+soul+be&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lbtzEBjoo1&amp;sig=cIZcaN0nLcVkUkCFfjDE-uWPaLA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2Xh5TfuWFIHXrAHjqd3NBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=body%20plus%20breath%20of%20life%20equals%20soul%20be&amp;f=false| quote  = The crucial test is probably Genesis 2:7, which gives the process by which Adam was created: 'The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life: and man became a living soul.'  My mind, like most people’s, has been deeply influenced by dualism, and I can see how dualistic minds deal with this verse.  They conclude that the formula for man-making is man equals body plus soul.   But that conclusion cannot be derived, except by violence, from Genesis 2:7, which is not dualistic.  The formula given in Genesis 2:7 is not man equals body plus soul; the formula there is soul equals dust plus breath.  According to this verse, God did not make a body and put a soul into it, like a letter into an envelope.  He formed man of dust; then, by breathing His breath into it, He made the dust live.  The dust, formed as man and made to live, did not ''embody'' a soul, it ''became'' a soul-that is, a whole creature.  Humanity is thus presented to us, in Adam, not as a creature of two discrete parts temporarily glued together but as a single mystery.| ref = harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rabbinic understanding of Genesis 2:7 as found in the [[Targum]]===
{{Primary sources|section|date=October 2012}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;And the Lord God created man in two formations; and took dust from the place of the house of the sanctuary, and from the four winds of the world, and mixed from all the waters of the world, and created him red, black, and white; and breathed into his nostrils the inspiration of life, and there was in the body of Adam the inspiration of a speaking spirit, unto the illumination of the eyes and the hearing of the ears.–[[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://targum.info/pj/pjgen1-6.htm Targum Pseudo-Jonathan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;And the Lord God created Adam from dust of the ground, and breathed upon his face the breath of lives, and it became in Adam a Discoursing Spirit.–[[Targum Onkelos]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://targum.info/onk/Gen1_6.htm%20 Targum of Onkelos]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Man as nephesh===
{{see also|Johannes Pedersen (theologian)#2Perdersen’s beliefs}}
    {{quote|The {{LORD}} God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath&lt;sup&gt;[neshemah]&lt;/sup&gt; of life; and man became a living&lt;sup&gt;[chay]&lt;/sup&gt; soul.&lt;sup&gt;[nephesh]&lt;/sup&gt; (Genesis 2:7 with notes added){{cn|date=February 2018}}}}Here and “all through Scripture” a “living soul” denotes a “living person”.&lt;ref&gt;James Hastings,  ''A Dictionary of the Bible: Vol IV: Part I: Pleroma-Shimon'' (Scribner's sons, 1902), s. v. “Psychology,” 166-167.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because, as [[Brevard Childs]] writes, in the biblical view, a person “does not ''have'' a soul, but ''is'' a soul”. &lt;ref&gt;Brevard S. Childs, ''Old Testament Theology in a Canonical Context'' (Fortress, 1985), 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animals as nephesh===
{{quote|And out of the ground the {{LORD}} God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living&lt;sup&gt;[chay]&lt;/sup&gt; creature,&lt;sup&gt;[nephesh]&lt;/sup&gt; that was the name thereof.|Genesis 2:19 with notes added{{cn|date=February 2018}}}}

The definition of ''soul'' [''psūchê''] in the New Testament is based on the definition found in the Old Testament.  "And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul;&lt;sup&gt;[psūchê]&lt;/sup&gt; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit." ({{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|15:45|KJV}}){{cn|date=February 2018}}

==New Testament==
The New Testament counterpart to the Old Testament word for soul, ''nephesh'', is ''psyche''. The two words carry a similar range of meanings.{{cn|date=February 2018}} Both can designate the person or the person’s life as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Walter A. Elwell, ed, ''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology'' (Baker Books, 1966), s. v. “Soul”.&lt;/ref&gt; For all uses and meanings of ''psyche''/ψυχἠ, see [[Joseph Henry Thayer]], ''A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament''.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=G5590&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of the soul==

[[John Goldingay]] writes, "The life of a human being came more directly from God, and it is also evident that when someone dies, the breath (''rûaḥ'', e.g., Ps 104:29) or the life (''nepeš'', e.g., Gen 35:18) disappears and returns to the God who is ''rûaḥ''."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Goldingay|Goldingay]], "Old Testament Theology", volume 2, p. 640 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immortality==
{{main|Immortality of the soul}}
The concept of an immaterial soul separate from and surviving the body is common today but according to modern scholars, it was not found in ancient Hebrew beliefs.&lt;ref name=Tabor &gt;Tabor, James, [http://clas-pages.uncc.edu/james-tabor/ancient-judaism/death-afterlife-future/ What the Bible says about Death, Afterlife, and the Future], , access date: December 14, 2013. "The ancient Hebrews had no idea of an immortal soul living a full and vital life beyond death, nor of any [[Resurrection of the Dead|resurrection or return from death]]. Human beings, like the beasts of the field, are made of "dust of the earth," and at death they return to that dust (Gen. 2:7; 3:19). The Hebrew word ''nephesh'', traditionally translated "living soul" but more properly understood as "living creature," is the same word used for all breathing creatures and refers to nothing immortal.&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''nephesh'' never means an immortal soul&lt;ref&gt;''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology.''&lt;/ref&gt; or an incorporeal part of the human being&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Biblical Theology,'' Father Xavier Leon Dufour, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; that can survive death of the body as the spirit of dead,&lt;ref&gt;''New International Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional Christianity===
In [[Patristic]] thought, towards the end of the 2nd century, ''psūchê'' had begun to be understood in a more Greek than a Hebrew way, contrasted with the body. By the 3rd century, with the influence of [[Origen]], the traditions of the inherent [[immortality of the soul]] and its divine nature were established.&lt;ref&gt;The early Hebrews apparently had a concept of the soul but did not separate it from the body, although later Jewish writers developed the idea of the soul further. Old Testament references to the soul are related to the concept of breath and establish no distinction between the ethereal soul and the corporeal body. Christian concepts of a body-soul dichotomy originated with the ancient Greeks and were introduced into Christian theology at an early date by St. Gregory of Nyssa and by St. Augustine.—''Britannica,'' 2004&lt;/ref&gt; As the new ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' points out: “The early Christian philosophers adopted the Greek concept of the soul’s immortality and thought of the soul as being created by God and infused into the body at conception.”&lt;ref&gt;The New Encyclopædia Britannica (1988), Volume 11, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; Inherent immortality of the soul was accepted among western and eastern theologians throughout the [[Middle Ages]], and after the Reformation, as evidenced by the [[Westminster Confession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://religible.com/562/questioning-immortality-soul-westminster-confession-ch-32/|title=Questioning the Immortality of the Soul In the Westminster Confession CH 32 « Religible|date=2017-04-05|work=Religible|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{fact|date=April 2017}}

===Modern scholarship===
The modern scholarly consensus holds that the canonical teaching of the [[Old Testament]] made no reference to an immortal soul independent of the body.&lt;ref&gt;
"Twentieth century biblical scholarship largely agrees that the ancient Jews had little explicit notion of a personal afterlife until very late in the Old Testament period. Immortality of the soul was a typically Greek philosophical notion quite foreign to the thought of ancient Semitic peoples. Only the latest stratum of the Old Testament asserts even the resurrection of the body, a view more congenial to Semites." - Donelley, "Calvinism and Scholasticism in Vermigli's doctrine of man and grace", p. 99 (1976)
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"Modern scholarship has underscored the fact that Hebrew and Greek concepts of soul were not synonymous. While the Hebrew thought world distinguished soul from body (as material basis of life), there was no question of two separate, independent entities. A person did not have a body but was an animated body, a unit of life manifesting itself in fleshly form—a psychophysical organism (Buttrick, 1962). Although Greek concepts of the soul varied widely according to the particular era and philosophical school, Greek thought often presented a view of the soul as a separate entity from body. Until recent decades Christian theology of the soul has been more reflective of Greek (compartmentalized) than Hebrew (unitive) ideas.", Moon, "Soul", in Benner &amp; Hill (eds.), "Baker encyclopedia of psychology &amp; counseling, p. 1148 (2nd ed. 1999)
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"A broad consensus emerged among biblical and theological scholars that soul-body dualism is a Platonic, Hellenistic idea that is not found anywhere in the Bible. The Bible, from cover to cover, promotes what they call the "Hebrew concept of the whole person." G. C. Berkouwer writes that the biblical view is always holistic, that in the Bible the soul is never ascribed any special religious significance. Werner Jaeger writes that soul-body dualism is a bizarre idea that has been read into the Bible by misguided church fathers such as Augustine. Rudolf Bultmann writes that Paul uses the word soma (body) to refer to the whole person, the self, so that there is not a soul and body, but rather the body is the whole thing. This interpretation of Pauline anthropology has been a theme in much subsequent Pauline scholarship.", McMinn &amp; Phillips, "Care for the soul: exploring the intersection of psychology &amp; theology", pp. 107-108 (2001).
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"The general consensus is that the Old Testament rejected any natural or innate immortality.", McNamara, "Beauty and the Priest: Finding God in the New Age", p. 64 (1997).
&lt;/ref&gt;
A wide range of scholarly reference works consistently represent this view.&lt;ref name="Indeed p. 518"&gt;
"Indeed, the salvation of the 'immortal soul' has sometimes been a commonplace in preaching, but it is fundamentally unbiblical. Biblical anthropology is not dualistic but monistic: human being consists in the integrated wholeness of body and soul, and the Bible never contemplates the disembodied existence of the soul in bliss.", Myers (ed.), "The Eerdmans Bible Dictionary", p. 518 (1987).
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hence 2001"&gt;
"There is no suggestion in the OT of the transmigration of the soul as an immaterial, immortal entity. Man is a unity of body and soul—terms that describe not so much two separate entities in a person as much as one person from different standpoints. Hence, in the description of man's creation in Genesis 2:7, the phrase 'a living soul' (kjv) is better translated as 'a living being.'", Elwell &amp; Comfort (eds.), "Tyndale Bible dictionary", p. 1216 (2001)
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"Barr is surely right to stress that the Genesis story as it now stands indicates that humans were not created immortal, but had (and lost) the chance to gain unending life.’, Wright, ‘The Resurrection of the Son of God’, p. 92 (2003); Wright himself actually interprets some passages of Scripture as indicating alternative beliefs, "The Bible offers a spectrum of belief about life after death", Wright, "The Resurrection of the Son of God", p. 129 (2003)
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"In contrast to the two enigmatic references to Enoch and Elijah, there are ample references to the fact that death is the ultimate destiny for all human beings, that God has no contact with or power over the dead, and that the dead do not have any relationship with God (see, inter alia, Ps. 6:6, 30:9–10, 39:13–14, 49:6–13, 115:16–18, 146:2–4). If there is a conceivable setting for the introduction of a doctrine of the afterlife, it would be in Job, since Job, although righteous, is harmed by God in the present life. But Job 10:20–22 and 14:1–10 affirm the opposite.", Gillman, "Death and Afterlife, Judaic Doctrines Of", in Neusner, "The Encyclopedia of Judaism", volume 1, p. 176 (2000)
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"'Who knows whether the breath of human beings rises up and the breath of an animal sinks down to the earth?' (Eccles 3:21). In Qohelet's day there were perhaps people who were speculating that human beings would enjoy a positive afterlife, as animals would not. Qohelet points out that there is no evidence for this.", [[John Goldingay|Goldingay]], "Old Testament Theology", volume 2, p. 644 (2006)&lt;br&gt;"The life of a human being came more directly from God, and it is also evident that when someone dies, the breath (rûaḥ, e.g., Ps 104:29) or the life (nepeš, e.g., Gen 35:18) disappears and returns to the God who is rûaḥ. And whereas the living may hope that the absence of God may give way again to God’s presence, the dead are forever cut off from God’s presence.241 Death means an end to fellowship with God and to fellowship with other people. It means an end to the activity of God and the activity of other people. Even more obviously, it means an end to my own activity. It means an end to awareness.", ibid., p. 640
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern theologians reject the view that the Bible teaches the doctrine of the immortal soul,&lt;ref&gt;
"But the Jew did not believe that human beings consist of an immortal soul entombed for a while in a mortal body.", Caird &amp; Hurst, "New Testament Theology", p. 267 (1994).
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"While the idea of an immortal soul is an established belief for most Christians, it cannot be supported by Biblical texts.", Ford &amp; Muers, "The modern theologians: an introduction to Christian theology since 1918", p. 693 (2005).
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"Consequently Buddhist and biblical views of the self agree that there exists no immortal soul that remains self-identically permanent through time.", Ford &amp; Muers, "The modern theologians: an introduction to Christian theology since 1918", p. 693 (2005).
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"Berkouwer has a long chapter on the meaning of the soul called "The Whole Man." Here he denounces the theory of a "substantial dichotomy" between an immortal soul and a mortal body.", Moody, "The Word of Truth: A Summary of Christian Doctrine Based on Biblical Revelation", p. 182 (1990).
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"Berkouwer's critique of belief in the natural immortality of the soul is as significant as it is Scriptural. At times he argues that "creedal caution" is better than dogmatic theology, but his main thrust is against the theory of belief in an immortal soul independent of God. Only God is by nature immortal, and man's immortality is a gift received in dependence upon the immortal God.", Moody, "The Word of Truth: A Summary of Christian Doctrine Based on Biblical Revelation", p. 182 (1990).
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"Fudge admits that belief in the immortality of the soul is the main current in church history. He, however, favors another view: 'Crisscrossing all of this flows the stream of Christian mortalism. . . . This understanding appears as the sparkling water of pristine Christianity.' He defines mortalism as 'the belief that according to divine revelation the soul does not exist as an independent substance after the death of the body.'", Fudge &amp; Peterson, "Two views of hell: a biblical &amp; theological dialogue", p. 173 (2000).
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"Theodore R. Clark also taught it. In his view, the whole person is mortal and subject to final and total destruction.", Richards, "Winds of doctrines: the origin and development of Southern Baptist theology", p. 207 (1991).
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"It is generally accepted that in biblical thought there is no separation of body and soul and, consequently, the resurrection of the body is central. The idea of an immortal soul is not a Hebrew concept but comes from Platonic philosophy. It is, therefore, considered a severe distortion of the NT to read this foreign idea into its teaching.", Vogels, "Review of "The Garden of Eden and the Hope of Immortality", by James Barr", Critical Review of Books in Religion, volume 7, p. 80 (1994).
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"Several Evangelical theologians suggest that the concept of man possessing an 'immortal soul' is not the teaching of the Word of God. Clark Pinnock argues that its source is Plato (or Greek philosophy in general), and not the Bible.",  Dixon, "What Is Man?", Emmaus Journal (9.2.168), 2000.
&lt;/ref&gt;
and Hebblethwaite observes the doctrine is "not popular amongst Christian theologians or among Christian philosophers today".&lt;ref&gt;
"That the idea of the soul's immortality as  disembodied state beyond death is not popular amongst Christian theologians or among Christian philosophers today has already been acknowledged.", Hebblethwaite, "Philosophical theology and Christian doctrine", p. 113 (2005).

{{Nihongo|'''Takeshi Umehara'''|梅原 猛|Umehara Takeshi|born March 20, 1925}} was born in [[Miyagi Prefecture]] in [[Tōhoku Region|Tōhoku]] and graduated from the philosophical faculty of [[Kyoto University]] in 1948. He taught [[philosophy]] at [[Ritsumeikan University]] and was subsequently appointed president of the [[Kyoto City University of Arts]]. He is noted for his prolific essays on Japanese culture, in which he has endeavoured to refound the discipline of Japanese studies along more Japanocentric lines, notably in his book {{nihongo4||日本学事始|Nihongaku kotohajime}} written in 1972 in collaboration with [[Shunpei Ueyama]]. Aside from his voluminous academic essays on numerous aspects of Japanese culture  he has also composed theatrical works on figures as varied as [[Yamato Takeru]] and [[Gilgamesh]].

He was appointed in 1987 to head the [[International Research Center for Japanese Studies]], otherwise known by the abbreviation of [[Nichibunken]], established by Prime Minister [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]] to function as a centralized academic body collecting and classifying all available information about Japanese culture, both within Japan and abroad. He retired as head administrator of Nichibunken in 1995.

==Early years==
His mother Chiyo Ishikawa died early while Umehara was being breast-fed, and his father was still a student at [[Tohoku University]]. Arrangements were made to have him looked after by relatives, and over New Year  1927, aged 1 year nine months, Umehara was adopted by his father’s brother Hanbei Umehara and his wife Toshi, and raised as their foster child.

Throughout his education, from primary through to tertiary level, Umehara was by his own account an indifferent student. He was in his primary school years somewhat of a daydreamer, preferring play to study. After graduating from [[Tokai High School]] in Nagoya, he gained entry in 1942 to the [[Hiroshima]] Higher Normal School, but withdrew after only two months, and, in the following year, the managed to obtain a place at the Hachikō (Eighth Rank) High School in Nagoya, under its Principal Itō Nikichi (伊藤仁吉). Over the following two years he developed a passionate interest in the philosophies of [[Nishida Kitarō]] and [[Tanabe Hajime]], the intellectual leaders of what was known as the [[Kyoto School]] (''Kyōto Gakuha''), a circle of conservative modernists who gave substantial theoretical backing to Japan’s imperial outreach during the period known as the 15-year war. Umehara was also attracted by the philosophy of ethics being worked out by Nishida and Tanabe’s former colleague, [[Watsuji Tetsurō]], who had now shifted to [[Tokyo University]]. Reading their work made Umehara resolve to dedicate his life to philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Umehara Takeshi, ''Nihonjin no「ano yo」kan'' ChūōKōron, Tokyo, 1991 p.164&lt;/ref&gt; On graduation from his secondary schooling, Umehara won a place at [[Kyoto University]]. By that time, both Nishida and Tanabe had retired, and Umehara’s father, a practical man with a career in the [[Toyota]] company, initially opposed the idea of him studying philosophy. At his son’s insistence, however, he relented and gave his permission. Soon after his admission however Umehara was conscripted into the army, and only managed to return to his studies in September of that year. He graduated in 1948.

==Noh theatre==
In 2008 Umehara began to publish modernized version of Noh theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Yuka Nishimoto [http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/people/AJ201301110010  'Philosopher Takeshi Umehara creates modern-day Noh for today's audiences,'] Asahi Shinbun, January 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Korea}}
{{Taoism}}
[[File:Flag of South Korea.svg|right|thumb|''Taegeukgi'', the [[flag of South Korea]], with a blue and red ''Taegeuk'' in the center.]]
'''[[Taoism]]''' or "Do" is thought to be the earliest state philosophy for the Korean people spanning several thousand years.  However, its influence waned with the introduction of [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhism]] during the [[Goryo |Goryo kingdom]] as the national religion and the dominance of [[neo-Confucianism]] during the [[Joseon dynasty|Joseon kingdom]].  Despite its diminished influence during those periods, it permeated all strata of the Korean populace, integrating with its native [[animism]] as well as Buddhist and Confucian institutions, temples, and ceremonies. The Taoist practice in Korea developed, somewhat in contrast to China, as an esoteric meditative practice in the mountains taught by the "mountain masters" or "mountain sages".  One of Korea's well-known founding myths in which a tiger and a bear seek to become human during an encounter with [[Hwanung]] may be viewed as a Taoist parable. The exact origin, despite various theories by historians, is in question because the royal records maintained by the early Korean kingdoms were destroyed during the two occasions in which the royal libraries were burned by invading Chinese armies. Later attempts to study the history and philosophy of Korean Taoism were suppressed during the Joseon kingdom which embraced only Confucianism as the proper field of study.

== Background ==
Broadly speaking, Taoism, [[Confucianism]], and [[Buddhism]] infused native [[Totemism]] and [[Korean Shamanism|Shamanism]] from the earliest centuries of the [[Common Era]], but [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhism]] dominated official thought during [[Silla]] and [[Goryeo]] dynasties, replaced by [[Korean Confucianism|Confucianism]] during the [[Joseon Dynasty]].

Very little writing on Taoism survived prior to the 20th century. Until recently, Taoism in Korea received little attention from scholars, usually only described as a "romantic influence" or "literary theme" within other contexts.&lt;ref name="aasianst.org"&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://aas2.asian-studies.org/absts/1995abst/korea/kses73.htm |title=Session 73: Taoism: The Forgotten Strand in Korea's Religious Heritage|author= Jahyun Kim Haboush|year=1995|publisher=Association for Asian Studies, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taoism's effects have been limited because of a lack of an institutional or political base, rejected by Confucian and Buddhist elites. Some modern scholars, however, are calling for a more critical reading of Confucianized histories, study of alternative sources, and a broader definition of Taoism, to find more extensive presence of Korean Taoist ritual practices and positive valuations.&lt;ref name="aasianst.org" /&gt;

== Three Kingdoms period ==

=== Goguryeo ===
Taoism first arrived in Korea in 624. Emperor [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Gaozu]], the founder of [[China]]'s [[Tang Dynasty]], sent a Taoist preacher and literature, [[Laozi]] and [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]], to the [[Goguryeo]] kingdom. These were eagerly welcomed by the Goguryeo's king and his minister [[Yeon Gaesomun]]. Buddhist temples were eventually transformed to Taoist temples. However, this first enthusiasm lasted for only 30 years. Taoist symbols are found in Goguryeo tomb murals near [[Kangso]], [[P'yongan-do]].

=== Baekje ===
In [[Baekje]], Taoism was mentioned in some treatises in passing, and did not take hold as in the other Korean kingdoms.

=== Silla ===
[[Silla]], having received Lao-tzu's [[Tao Te Ching]] in 738 from the Tang emperor, left the most substantial legacy of Taoism.  Silla scholars went to China to study Taoism, and Lao-tzu was tested in civil service examinations. [[Sinseon Sasang]], which was relatively widespread in Silla, had its roots in [[animism|animistic]] folk beliefs and practices, but it was also influenced by Korean Taoism.

Silla Taoism concentrated on the practice and training of one's mind or self-discipline. Its most distinctive mark can be found in the [[Hwarang]], an elite armed force noted for its disciplined composure, simplicity, relaxation and harmony, every one a component of philosophical Taoism.

== Goryeo ==
Taoism enjoyed its greatest popularity during the [[Goryeo Dynasty]], especially in the court and the ruling class. Taoist court rituals were introduced into Korea from [[Song dynasty]] China, especially under King [[Yejong of Goryeo|Yejong]] (r. 1105–1122). The object of worship in these rituals included most of the major and minor deities of the Taoist pantheon, but certain deities such as [[Samgye]] and [[Chinese theology#Taiyi|T'aeil]] seem to have been the most popular.&lt;ref name="aasianst.org" /&gt;

By the mid period of the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty, [[Buddhism]] dominated Korea, subsuming other religions and philosophies, including Taoism.

== Joseon ==
The state religion under the [[Joseon Dynasty]] can be described as Neo-Confucianism, although not popular among the common people. At least at the start of the dynasty, Taoist literature was quite popular among groups of the intelligentsia. These writings on Taoism were predominantly from a Confucian perspective. However, there was a growing opposition from the main Confucian faction against Taoism, and Taoism began to be perceived as "heretical". Subsequently, the presence of Taoism shrank noticeably, and during the 1592 [[Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea|Japanese invasion]], Taoism was systematically abolished.

In the 16th to 18th centuries, Taoism flourished, as literati, monks, private scholars (sarim), and even women, studied and practiced Taoist meditation and inner alchemy (naedan/[[Danhak]]) and produced hagiographic and anecdotal accounts of their Taoist contemporaries and forebears. The most important of these accounts known to date are four anecdotal biographies of immortals (Sason chon) in the collected writings of [[Heo Gyun]] (1569–1618), the [[Ch'onghakjip]] (Collected Discourses of Master Blue Crane) by [[Cho Yojok]] (early 17th century).&lt;ref name="aasianst.org" /&gt;

While these were written to encourage Koreans to practice inner alchemy for the sake of immortality (i.e., deliverance from the corpse), they also re-envision and broaden the meaning of Korean religious history by reiterating nativist and folk traditions about the role of Korean mountain recluses and earthbound immortals in the maintenance and protection of Korean society.&lt;ref name="aasianst.org" /&gt;

== Modern presence ==
Since the late Joseon Dynasty, Taoism has been marginalized not only by the Korean Royal Court, Confucians, and Buddhists but also by society as a whole. Due to such a history, only a handful of Taoists exist throughout Korea today.

Taoism has been absorbed into the traditional Korean vision of the world, a world view in which shamanistic, Confucian, Buddhist, and Taoist elements are so intimately intertwined that often only a scholar can distinguish which is which.&lt;ref name="aasianst.org" /&gt;

Evidence of Taoist revival can be seen in [[Tanjeon Hoheup]], [[Tonghak]] and [[Kouk Sun Do]]. Even if the term "Taoism" is not used, the terms, techniques, and goals are clearly Taoist.&lt;ref name="aasianst.org" /&gt; The Taoist mark of Chinese characters ''su'' (longevity) and ''bok'' (bliss) decorate many everyday articles, from spoons to pillow cases, even today. Many place names, especially related to mountains, bear strong Taoist influence.

The Taoist symbol [[Taegeuk]] is featured in the [[flag of South Korea]].{{fact|date=January 2017}}, and [[Chondoism]] is the Korean religion with more presence in [[North Korea]], when Chondoist people are represented in politics by [[Chondoist Chongu Party]].

'''''The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief''''' is a [[Bestseller|bestselling]] book by [[Francis Collins (geneticist)|Francis Collins]] in which he advocates [[theistic evolution]]. Francis Collins is an American [[physician]]-[[geneticist]], noted for his landmark discoveries of disease genes, and his leadership of the [[Human Genome Project]] (HGP). He currently serves as the Director of the US [[National Institutes of Health]]. &lt;!-- The previous sentencesabout Francis Collins was obtained from his main Wikipedia article. --&gt; In the book, Collins describes briefly the process by which he became a [[Christian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Cornelia|last= Dean|title=Faith, Reason, God and Other Imponderables |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/25/science/25books.html |work=[[New York Times]] |date=July 25, 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Scientists on Religion |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&amp;colID=12&amp;articleID=0006559D-DF6D-150E-9D8283414B7F0000 |work=[[Scientific American]] |date=October 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins raises arguments for the idea of God from [[biology]], [[astrophysics]], [[psychology]] and other disciplines. He cites many famous thinkers, most prevalently [[C. S. Lewis]], as well as [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] and others. In 2007 ''[[Christianity Today]]'' judged it one of the best books of the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/june/8.36.html|accessdate=2009-05-08}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BioLogos==
The book proposes the name "BioLogos" as a new term for [[theistic evolution]]. "[[BioLogos Foundation|BioLogos]]" is also the name of a science-and-faith organization [[Francis Collins|Collins]] founded in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biologos.org|title=BioLogos — Home|accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bios'' is the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "life". ''[[Logos]]'' is Greek for "word," with a broader meaning in [[Heraclitus#Philosophy|Heracleitean Philosophy]] and [[Stoicism]]—namely the rational principle ordering the universe. This concept was appropriated by Christian theology. In Christian theology, "Word" is actually a creative agent for all that exists, in addition to being an ordering principle. Furthermore, in some Christian thinking the eternal and divine ''Logos'' merged and synthesized with a human nature to become Jesus Christ in the [[Incarnation]]. This is laid out in the opening prologue of the [[Gospel of John]], forming part of the textual basis for Christian belief in the Trinity, as the concept of Logos morphed over time into ''God the Son'' for the second person of the Trinity.&lt;ref&gt;See Athanasius treatise ''The Incarnation of the Word of God''&lt;/ref&gt;

"BioLogos" expresses the belief that God is the source of all life and that life expresses the will of God. BioLogos represents the view that science and faith co-exist in harmony.&lt;ref name=log&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JcMCmBnpHGsC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=Biologos#v=onepage&amp;q=Biologos&amp;f=false ''The Language of God: a Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief'']. [[Francis S. Collins]]. [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2006. {{ISBN|0-7432-8639-1}}. p.203&lt;/ref&gt;

BioLogos rests on the following premises:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biologos.org/about Official BioLogos statement of belief]&lt;/ref&gt;
#The universe was created by God, approximately 14 billion years ago.
#The properties of the universe appear to have been precisely tuned for life.
#While the precise mechanism of the origin of life on earth remains unknown, it is possible that the development of living organisms was part of God's original creation plan.
#Once life began, no special further interventions by God were required.
#Humans are part of this process, sharing a common ancestor with the great apes.
#Humans are unique in ways that defy evolutionary explanations and point to our spiritual nature. This includes the existence of the knowledge of right and wrong and the search for God.

==Description==
Collins' conversion to Christianity is detailed at the beginning and end of ''The Language of God''. He grew up in an agnostic family, and knew at an early age that he wanted to be a scientist. At first, he was interested in the physical sciences, since "biology was rather like existential philosophy: it just didn't make sense" (page 181). However, nearing the end of a Ph.D. program, Collins took a biochemistry course and was hooked. He applied for and was admitted to medical school, from which he graduated and began genetic research and a clinical practice. During one clinic, Collins was asked by a Christian patient about his spiritual beliefs. He did not really have an answer, but determined that he should confirm his atheism by studying the best arguments for faith. A pastor directed him to ''[[Mere Christianity]]'' by C. S. Lewis, which he cites as the main cause of his conversion.

Another section of "The Language of God" focuses on 'The Moral Law Argument.' Moral Law is very important for Collins: "After twenty-eight years as a believer, the Moral Law stands out for me as the strongest signpost of God" (p.&amp;nbsp;218). Moral Law is an argument for the existence of a God. What is the Moral Law? Collins quotes C. S. Lewis, "the denunciation of oppression, murder, treachery, falsehood and the injunction of kindness to the aged, the young, and the weak, almsgiving, impartiality, and honesty." Collins has two main arguments: one is that all cultures and religions of the world endorse a universal, absolute and timeless Moral Law. It is overwhelmingly documented in the "Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics." According to Collins, it is a unique property that separates humans and animals. The Moral Law includes altruism which is more than just reciprocity ("You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours"). His second argument is: "Selfless altruism presents a major challenge for the evolutionist" (p.&amp;nbsp;27).

Collins argues that science and faith can be compatible. In an interview on the [[Point of Inquiry]] podcast he told [[D. J. Grothe]] that “the scientific method and the scientific worldview can't be allowed to get distorted by religious perspectives”, but he does not think “being a believer or a non-believer affects one's ability to do science”.&lt;ref name=languageofgod&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/dr_francis_collins_the_language_of_god/|title=''Dr. Francis Collins - The Language of God''|author=[[D.J. Grothe]]|publisher=[[Point of Inquiry]]|date=2007-08-31|accessdate=2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that "the faith [[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins]] describes in [[the God Delusion]] isn't the faith I recognise", and that, like him, "most people are seeking a possible harmony between these worldviews [faith and science]"&lt;ref name=languageofgod/&gt;

==Reception==
The July 17 ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' review reads: “This marvelous book combines a personal account of Collins’s faith and experiences as a genetics researcher with discussions of more general topics of science and spirituality, especially centering around evolution.” Robert K. Eberle summarizes his opinion of the book: "The Language of God is well written, and in many places quite thoughtful, but unless one is predisposed to the idea of theistic evolution, most will probably find the book unconvincing on this front."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=The Language of God: If God Could Talk What Would he Say? |url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/06-10-03.html |work=[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|eSkeptic]] |date=October 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] saw Collins's waterfall experience (three frozen streams reminding him of the [[Trinity]]) as no more valid than would be a reminder to him (Harris) of the [[Romulus and Remus|three mythical founders of Rome]], argued that Collins's treatment of the evolution of altruism should have considered [[kin selection]] and [[exaptation]], and challenged Collins's [[theodicy]] by arguing that rationalists should ask whether evidence ''suggests'' the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God rather than whether it is ''compatible'' with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Sam Harris: The Language of Ignorance|url=http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/20060815_sam_harris_language_ignorance |work=[[truthdig]] |date=August 15, 2006 |accessdate=2010-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Harris' criticisms, physicist [[Stephen M. Barr]] for [[First Things]] writes that Collins' book is meant to be "the story of how and why he came to believe in God...There are many conversion stories and many scientific autobiographies, but few books in which prominent scientists tell how they came to faith." Barr concludes that while "so many people on both sides are trying to foment a conflict between science and religion, Collins is a sorely needed voice of reason. His book may do more to promote better understanding between the worlds of faith and science than any other so far written."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barr|first1=Stephen|title=The Form of Speaking|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2006/12/the-form-of-speaking|website=www.firstthings.com|publisher=First Things|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highly fragmented material was discovered in 1906 by a German expedition team headed by Indologist Dr. Moritz Spitzer. The material was found in Qizil&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/05/01/a-brief-note-on-the-spitzer-manuscript-and-related-issues/|title=A brief note on the Spitzer manuscript and related issues|date=2013-05-01|work=mAnasa-taraMgiNI|access-date=2018-01-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Central Asia) which falls in the ancient [[Silk Road|silk]] route. The material is currently preserved in State library of [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. The work is unique in that no parallel work has ever been found related to it and also the text has not been transmitted to China/Tibet/Japan through translations like most other early Buddhist texts do.

== Script Used ==
This ancient manuscript was written with a broad-nib copper pen in Kuṣāṇa-Brāhmã script.

== Contents ==
The account of the manuscript as edited by Franco is presented below with a few comments.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; avidyA-lakShaNa; godAna vastra-dAna, criticism of the ghR^ihastAshrama, brAhmaNa-s. None of this is clear as the pages are rather fragmentary.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; An account of AjIvika theories such as dharma and adharma having no consequence.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Some account of sukha, dukha, death, bandha and mokSha, etc.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; An account of the properties (lakShaNa-s) of the primary substances teja, vAyu, Apa etc. A detailed account of vaisheShika theory of guNa-s, probably statement of a pUrvapakSha for a nAstika (?)

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; The four Arya satyAni of the buddha and the concept of nairAtmya.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Some account of principles of logical inference and argument.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; saMkSipta rAmAyaNa- a summary of vAlmIki’s epic. A parvan summary of the mahAbhArata. It should be noted that this is fragmentary with the so claimed missing virATaparvan being a lacuna in the manuscript with some name starting in ‘a’ or ‘A’, which might have read aj~nAtaparvan – effectively the same as the virATaparvan. The missing anushAsanaparvan cannot be confirmed as being really missing or: 1) poor preservation; 2) some Mbh manuscripts outside India, like Indonesia, combine the shAntiparvan and the anushAsanaparvan; simply accidental or ignorant omission by the author. 

In conclusion, the evidence is just tenuous to insist that this fragmentary parvan list from a unique manuscript from uttarApatha (Central Asia) represented the state of the Mbh as was known elsewhere in jambudvIpa at that age. Franco also places a fragment of the text regarding the origin of daitya-s and dAnava-s, a legal procedure, an account of the gandharva veda, the chatuH ShaShTi kalA-s, vedA~Nga-s, and the duties of each varNa in this part of the text.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Brief account of upaniShad-s, mantra-s and brAhmaNa injunctions. The concepts of adhidaiva and adhyAtman.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Brief account of taxonomy of living beings.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; The claim that the buddha knew all of the veda, the vedA~Nga-s, astronomy, dance and music. Arguments [possibly of an Astika] as to why the buddha could not have been all-knowing.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; The buddha as an authoritative teacher, the merits of building stUpa-s, the evils of dishonest actions, destruction of desire by knowledge, a meditation on the bodily processes to end desire, mokSha, use of garlic vis-a-vis brAhmaNa-s and shaka-s.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Nature of saMsAra, a refutation of Ishvara concept, law of conservation of matter and the beginningless nature of saMsAra.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; An attack on the bauddha-mata [Arguments of mImAMsaka-s]: The buddha’s teaching is not pramANa because he used prAkR^ita, examples of vulgar prAkR^ita

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Debate regarding whether compassion is dharma because it involves attachment to the object of compassion.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; sharabha and other animals.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Existence of past and future dharma-s in addition to those of the present – bauddha theory of sarvAstivAda, which was popular in uttarApatha and among the chIna-s.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Discourse on how the Arya satyAni of the buddha can be understood – by a gradual process or in a sudden revelation. The text explains that it is a gradual process.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; An attack on the Astika theory of the “self-luminescent” consciousness.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; The tathAgata’s place in the saMgha and the obscure question of whether making a donation to the saMgha is a donation to the buddha.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; The concepts of samyag-buddhi and mithyA-buddhi – correct and wrong cognition.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; An attack on the kAshyapIya theory of the action continuing to exist until it bears fruit.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Lengthy philosophical considerations and debates between tAthAgata-s and naiyAyika-s, mImAMsaka-s and sAMkhyavAdin-s.

'''''Thick Black Theory''''' ({{zh|t=厚黑學|p=''Hòu hēi xué''}}) is a philosophical [[treatise]] written by [[Li Zongwu]] [[:zh:李宗吾]] (1879–1943), a disgruntled politician and scholar born at the end of [[Qing dynasty]]. It was published in [[China]] in 1911, the year of the [[Xinhai revolution]], when the Qing dynasty was overthrown.

==Name==
''Houheixue'' is translated as "Thick Black Theory", "Thick and Dark Theory", or "Study of the Thick and Dark". ''Hou'' 厚 is first word of "thick face" in Chinese; it means having a thick hide. Hei 黑 means black or dark in Chinese; it means having a dark mind in the context (cf. xuan 玄, e.g. in [[Xuanxue]]). 

==Quotations==
Li was a scientist of political intrigue. He wrote: "When you conceal your will from others, that is Thick. When you impose your will on others, that is Black (Dark)." According to [[Chin-Ning Chu]], the 'Thick Black Theory' describes the ruthless and hypocritical&lt;ref&gt;Chin-Ning Chu in "50 Success Classics" by Tom Butler-Bowdon Chapter 9.  {{ISBN|1857883330}}&lt;/ref&gt; means men use to obtain and hold power: "thick faces" (shamelessness), "black heart" (ruthlessness), according to author's view of history. It went through several printings before being banned in China as subversive.

Li argued that "A great hero is no more than a person who is impudent and wicked." According to Li, the wickedest of all was [[Cao Cao]]. "I would rather betray someone than be betrayed." It shows how black Cao Cao's heart was inside. Li picked [[Liu Bei]] (king of one rival kingdom competing with Cao's) as the highly skilled person with a "thick face". He never thought it shameful to live inside another's fence. He was also a frequent crier, appealing to others' sympathy. There is even a humorous saying, "Liu Bei's JiangShan (kingdom) was obtained through his crying."

==Studies==
During the 1980s, news spread that [[Mao Zedong]] had studied the Thick Black Theory before the [[Cultural Revolution]], and Li Zongwu was in the spotlight again. In [[Beijing]] during the 1990s, many books related to the Thick Black Theory, "thick-black-ology", were published.

Low Sui Pheng, in 1997 a Senior Lecturer at National University of Singapore, discusses the theory and issues in "Thick face, black heart and the marketing of construction services in China" in the "Marketing Intelligence &amp; Planning" journal, volume 15 (1997), number 5, pp.&amp;nbsp;221–226, MCB University Press. Low proposes that Li Zongwu's principles from the 1911 book are widely practiced today as, more than ever, the Chinese view business as war and the marketplace as a battlefield.

The principles are also discussed by Tony Fang, of the School of Business, Stockholm University, in "Negotiation: the Chinese style", "Journal of Business &amp; Industrial Marketing", volume 21 (2006), number 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;50–60, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The '''Trager approach''' is a form of [[somatics|somatic education]]. Proponents claim the Trager approach helps release deep-seated physical and mental patterns and facilitates deep [[relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], increased physical mobility, and [[mental clarity]].&lt;ref&gt;Trivieri, Larry, and John W.

He was an athlete, dancer, and bodybuilder. He began doing bodywork with no training and later worked under a variety of practitioner licenses, including an MD earned in Mexico followed by 2 years residency in psychiatry.&lt;ref name= "Stillerman" /&gt; Trager wanted western medicine to accept his proposed mind-body connection in treating challenging conditions such as postpolio, Parkinson's, and other neuromuscular conditions. Doctors reportedly referred patients to him and were surprised by the results, but "none seemed to consider his drugless treatments as effective as surgery or medication" and the medical approach to these conditions did not fundamentally shift away from them as he had envisioned.&lt;ref name="Stillerman"/&gt; 
Late in life, at the [[Esalen Institute]], he was encouraged to begin teaching, which he did for the last 22 years of his life.&lt;ref name= "Stillerman"&gt;{{cite book |last= Stillerman |first= Elaine |year= 2016 |edition= second |title= Modalities for Massage and Bodywork |publisher= [[Mosby (publisher)|Mosby]] |pages= 402–14 |isbn= 9780323239318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of a session, the practitioner enters into a state of [[meditation]] that Milton Trager originally termed "hook-up".&lt;ref name= "Stillerman" /&gt; From this state of mind, the practitioner uses gentle [[touch]] and a combination of passive and active [[:wikt:movement|movement]] with the intent of teaching the recipient how to move with less effort.&lt;ref name= "Levine"&gt;{{cite book |last= Levine |first= Andrew |year= 1998 |title= The Bodywork and Massage Sourcebook |publisher= [[Lowell House]] |pages= 159–171 |isbn= 9780737300987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contact is gentle in a sense; it may be quite firm but is without strain or resistance.&lt;ref name= "Stillerman" /&gt; Regarding pain, Trager practitioners avoid causing pain, and attempt to contact the body in a way that allows the client to have decreased fear of pain and increased willingness to be present with the full range of sensations.&lt;ref name= "Stillerman" /&gt; Practitioners are taught to allow a tone of curiosity, playfulness, and effortlessness to guide their work.&lt;ref name= "Stillerman" /&gt; In addition to hands-on bodywork, clients are taught a series of movements called "Mentastics" to be performed with a certain mental attention. While doing these movements, the client is asked to explore how to move with the least tension and effort possible.&lt;ref name= "Stillerman" /&gt;

In the history of the [[Austria-Hungary]] '''trialism''' was the political movement that aimed to reorganize the bipartite Empire into a tripartite one, creating a [[Croatia]]n state equal in status to [[Austria]] and [[Hungary]].&lt;ref name="abcclio"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Bosnia-Hercegovina |encyclopedia=Eastern Europe |page=644 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lVBB1a0rC70C&amp;pg=PA644}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] promoted trialism before his assassination in 1914 to prevent the Empire from being ripped apart by Slavic dissent.  The Empire would be restructured three ways instead of two, with the Slavic element given representation at the highest levels equivalent to what Austria and Hungary had at the time. Serbians saw this as a threat to their dream  of a new state of Yugoslavia. Hungarian leaders had a predominant voice in imperial circles and strongly rejected Trialism because it would liberate many of their minorities from Hungarian rule they considered oppressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Spencer Tucker et al. eds. |title=The European Powers in the First World War: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gv3GEyB19wIC&amp;pg=PA269|year=1999|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea never came close to actual implementation, though it had several notable proponents among the political elites. At the end of World War I, its advocates briefly obtained nominal support for a trialist manifesto, but the monarchy as a whole crumbled shortly thereafter.

==History==

The movement originated in the 1880s in aristocratic and clerical circles of the Empire as a reaction to Hungarian nationalism&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=From independence to trialism: the Croatian Party of Right and the project for a liberal "Greater Croatia" within the Habsburg Empire, 1861–1914 |author=Nevenko Bartulin |encyclopedia=Liberal Imperialism in Europe |editor=Matthew P. Fitzpatrick |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2012 |page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; and must be contrasted to the revolutionary, secessionist [[Yugoslavism]], as it worked within the Habsburg state apparatus with support from Croat politicians and Austrian officials (including the Archduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]].&lt;ref name="abcclio"/&gt;)
The hope of trialist Austrian imperialists was that Serbia might eventually join the great Croatia that was to be created, while putting pressure on the Hungarians and allowing Vienna to continue to dominate the Empire as a whole.&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick"/&gt;

In the early and mid-19th century the movement was [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavic]] and demanded that, in addition to the Austrian and Hungarian crowns, a third Slavic crown be established (North Slavs and the South Slavs separately), to allow the empire to resist claims from other Slavic countries and nations (Russia and Serbia.)

With the collapse of the early pan-Slavic (Czech-Slovak and Croatian-Slovene-Serb) movements, the new concept of trialism was strictly relegated to Croatia. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and the Croatian-Hungarian Compromise of 1868 there was great dissatisfaction among the Croatian population that was divided between the two crowns of the empire (Croats in [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]] under the Austrian crown, Croats in Croatia and Slavonia under the Hungarian, and [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] divided between them.)  Strong pressure for the reorganization of the empire arose mainly from Croatia-Slavonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, who since the 1848-49 defeat of the Hungarians had resented their association with them. There were many trialist propositions proposed but the common idea was that the monarchy would be composed of [[Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council|empire of Austria]], [[kingdom of Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|kingdom of Croatia]].

In Croatia the most prominent advocates of the idea were Dr. [[Nikola Zvonimir Bjelovučić]], author of the book ''Trialism and the Croatian state'', Dr. [[Ivo Pilar]], historian, politician and K.u.K. officer who advocated the idea of trialism in his book ''The South Slav Question'', Dr. [[Aleksandar Horvat]], leader of the pro-monarchy Pure Party of Rights and Croatian delegate at the signing of the trialist treaty in Vienna and Budapest 1918.&lt;ref name="Budisavljević"&gt;Budisavljević Srđan, ''Stvaranje Države SHS, (Creation of the state of SHS)'', Zagreb, 1958, p. 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt; Other proponents of the idea included General [[Stjepan Sarkotić]], Field marshal [[Svetozar Borojević]], [[Ivo Prodan]], archbishop [[Josip Štadler]], generals [[Lukas Šnjarić]]
and [[Mihael Mihaljević]].&lt;ref name="Kazimirović"&gt;Vasa Kazimirović ''NDH u svetlu nemačkih dokumenata i dnevnika Gleza fon Horstenau 1941 – 1944'', Beograd 1987, p.56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nikola Zvonimir Bjelovučić's proposed trialist monarchy (1911) would be named Austro-Hungaro-Croatian monarchy, and every emperor and king would have to be separately crowned in Austria, Hungary and Croatia.&lt;ref name="Bjelovučić"&gt;Bjelovučić Nikola Zvonimir, ''Trijalizam i Hrvatska država'', Dubrovnik, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2015}} Common affairs in Austro-Hungaro-Croatia would include a ministry of navy headquartered in [[Pula]];&lt;ref&gt;Bjelovučić, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; an independent army for every state in the monarchy with its own language and officer cadre;&lt;ref name="Bjelovučić, page 12"&gt;Bjelovučić, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; a foreign affairs ministry equally staffed and financed by each of the states;&lt;ref name="Bjelovučić, page 12"/&gt; and a parliament equally representing each state.&lt;ref&gt;Bjelovučić, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2015}}

According to Bjelovučić the Croatian kingdom would comprise the [[Slovene Lands]], Istria, Rijeka, Croatia-Slavonia, Dalmatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. [[Trieste]] with western Istria would form an autonomous region in the kingdom. In that region the Italians would be in a political sense equal to Croats. In the Croatian kingdom Croats and Serbs (with Muslims) would enjoy national freedom especially in the local administration. Special provisions would be made for languages, education and religions in the Croatian kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Bjelovučić, pages 7.-20.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2015}}
According to Bjelovučić's proposal, Croatia would host a total of six 'Royal Croatian' government ministries.&lt;ref&gt;Bjelovučić, pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2015}}

Among the Habsburg family the supporters of reorganizing the empire from a dualist to a trialist one included [[Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria|Archduke Leopold Salvator]] who served as an artillery officer in Zagreb 1894–1900, [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Crown Prince Rudolf]] who supported federalization of the monarchy, and [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], who was the most prominent trialist supporter which made him a great threat to the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Serbian nationalists]] and led to the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination in Sarajevo]]. During his short reign Emperor and king [[Charles I of Austria|Charles (Karl) I (IV)]] supported the trialist concept and advocated the reorganization of the monarchy.

==World War I==

Croatian delegations attempted to attain trialism throughout the entire [[World War I]], but even though they had support from emperor Karl I (IV), they were always declined and vetoed by the Hungarian side, which wanted to preserve the integrity of the Hungarian crown.&lt;ref name="SZABÓ DÁNIEL"/&gt;

Emperor Karl's manifest of 14 October 1918 was rejected by the declaration of the [[National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs|National Council]] in Zagreb.&lt;ref name="F. Šišić"&gt;F. Šišić ''Dokumenti'', p.180.&lt;/ref&gt;

President of the Croatian pro-monarchy political party [[Pure Party of Rights]] Dr. [[Aleksandar Horvat]], with parliament members [[Ivo Frank]] and [[Josip Pazman]], and generals [[Lukas Šnjarić]] and [[Mihael Mihaljević]],&lt;ref name="Kazimirović"/&gt; went to visit king Karl I (IV) on 21 October 1918 in Bad Ischl.&lt;ref name="Jedna infamija"&gt;Jedna Hrvatska ‘H. Rieči’", 1918., no. 2167&lt;/ref&gt; Since the king was favorable to the earlier Croatian trialist proposals from 1917, which were vetoed by the Hungarian side, the king agreed and signed the trialist manifest under the proposed terms set by the delegation, on the condition that the Hungarian part does the same since he swore an oath on the integrity of the Hungarian crown.&lt;ref name="A. PAVELIĆ"&gt;A. Pavelić (lawyer) ''Doživljaji'', p.432.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dr. Aleksandar Horvat"&gt;Dr. Aleksandar Horvat ''Povodom njegove pedesetgodišnjice rodjenja'', Hrvatsko pravo, Zagreb, 17/1925., no. 5031&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edmund von Glaise-Horstenau"&gt;Edmund von Glaise-Horstenau,Die Katastrophe. Die Zertrümmerung Österreich-Ungarns und das Werden der Nachfolgestaaten, Zürich – Leipzig – Wien 1929, p.302-303.&lt;/ref&gt; The delegation went the next day to Budapest where it met Count [[Istvan Tisza]] and presented the manifest on 22 October 1918 to the Hungarian Council of Ministers led by Hungarian prime minister [[Sándor Wekerle]], who released the king from his oath, and signed the manifest on the creation and unification of all Croatian lands into a single state.&lt;ref name="Budisavljević"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dr. Aleksandar Horvat"/&gt; After the signing of the manifest, in Zagreb [[Fran Milobar]] got a telegram to prepare a public proclamation of the creation of "Zvonimir's kingdom".&lt;ref name="F. Milobar"&gt;F. Milobar ''Slava dr. Aleksandru Horvatu!'', Hrvatsko pravo, 20/1928., no. 5160&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Croatian delegation in Budapest after the signing the trialist manifest Count Istva Tisza stated "Ich sehe ein, dass wir gegenüber Kroatien grosse Fehler begangen haben" (I realized that we have made some great mistakes towards Croatia).&lt;ref name="S. MATKOVIĆ"&gt;S. Matković, "Tko je bio Ivo Frank?", Politički zatvorenik, Zagreb, 17/2007., no. 187, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the signing, two parades were held in Zagreb, one for the ending of the K.u.K. monarchy, which was held in front of the Croatian National Theater, and another one for saving the trialist monarchy.&lt;ref name="Budisavljević"/&gt;

The last vote for the support of the trialist reorganization of the empire was, however, too late, as the very next day, on 23 October 1918, the Hungarian prime minister Alexander Wekerle resigned and the council of ministers was deposed.&lt;ref name="SZABÓ DÁNIEL"&gt;SZABÓ DÁNIEL ''Wekerle Sándor utolsó miniszterelnöksége'' p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 October 1918, the Croatian Sabor (parliament), on the basis of a complete right of self-determination which was recognized by all the warring authorities, declared the end of the union and all ties between Hungary and Croatia, and also united all Croatian lands and entered the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]].&lt;ref name="Hrvatska Država"&gt;Hrvatska Država, newspaper ''Public proclamation of the Sabor 29.10.1918.'' Issued 29.10.1918. no. 299. p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The curiosity is that no act of Sabor dethroned king Karl I, nor did it acknowledge the entering in a state union with Serbia, which is today mentioned in the preamble of the Constitution of Croatia.&lt;ref name="Narodne novine"&gt;Narodne novine, br. 56/90, 135/97, 8/98 – pročišćeni tekst, 113/2000, 124/2000 – pročišćeni tekst, 28/2001, 41/2001 – pročišćeni tekst, 55/2001 – ispravak&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Classic [[Truth value#Classical logic|binary]] logic is represented by a small set of mathematical functions depending on one (monadic ) or two (dyadic) variables. In the binary set, the value 1 corresponds to ''[[True (logic)|true]]'' and the value 0 to ''[[False (logic)|false]]''. A two-valued vector logic requires a correspondence between the truth-values ''true'' (t)  and ''false'' (f), and two ''q''-dimensional normalized [[column vector]]s composed by real numbers ''s'' and ''n'', hence:

: &lt;math&gt;t\mapsto s&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f\mapsto n&lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt; q \geq 2&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary natural number, and “normalized” means that the [[Euclidean norm|length]] of the vector is 1; usually s and n are orthogonal vectors).  This correspondence generates a space of vector truth-values: ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''s'',''n''}. The basic logical operations defined using this set of vectors lead to matrix operators.

The operations of vector logic are based on the scalar product between ''q''-dimensional column vectors: &lt;math&gt;u^Tv=\langle u,v\rangle&lt;/math&gt;: the orthonormality between vectors ''s'' and ''n'' implies that &lt;math&gt;\langle u,v\rangle=1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;u = v&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\langle u,v\rangle=0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;u \ne v&lt;/math&gt;.

===Monadic operators===
The monadic operators result from the application &lt;math&gt;Mon: V_2 \to V_2&lt;/math&gt;, and the associated matrices have ''q'' rows and ''q'' columns. The two basic monadic operators for this two-valued vector logic are the [[Identity function|identity]] and the [[Logical negation|negation]]:

* '''Identity''': A logical identity ID(p)is represented by matrix &lt;math&gt;I=ss^T + nn^T&lt;/math&gt;. This matrix operates as follows:  ''Ip''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p'', ''p''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; due to the orthogonality of ''s'' respect to ''n'', we have &lt;math&gt;Is=ss^Ts+nn^Ts=s\langle s,s\rangle+n\langle n,s\rangle=s&lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp; and conversely &lt;math&gt;In=n&lt;/math&gt;.  It is important to note that this vector logic identity matrix is not generally an [[identity matrix]] in the sense of matrix algebra.
* '''Negation''': A logical negation ¬p is represented by matrix &lt;math&gt;N=ns^T + sn^T&lt;/math&gt; Consequently, ''Ns''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''  and ''Nn''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''s''. The [[Involution (mathematics)|involutory]] behavior of the logical negation, namely that ¬(¬''p'') equals ''p'',  corresponds with the fact that ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''I''.

=== Dyadic operators ===
The 16 two-valued dyadic operators correspond to functions of the type &lt;math&gt;Dyad: V_2 \otimes V_2\to V_2&lt;/math&gt;; the dyadic matrices have ''q'' rows and ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; columns.
The matrices that execute these dyadic operations are based on the properties of the [[Kronecker product]].

Two properties of this product are essential for the formalism of vector logic:
{{ordered list
|1= '''The mixed-product property'''
If '''A''', '''B''', '''C''' and '''D''' are matrices of such size that one can form the matrix products '''AC''' and '''BD''', then
:&lt;math&gt; (A \otimes B)(C \otimes D) = AC \otimes BD &lt;/math&gt;
|2= '''Distributive transpose''' The operation of transposition is distributive over the Kronecker product:
:&lt;math&gt;(A\otimes B)^T = A^T \otimes B^T.&lt;/math&gt;
}}

Using these properties, expressions for dyadic logic functions can be obtained:

* '''[[∧|Conjunction]]'''. The conjunction (p∧q) is executed by a matrix that acts on two vector truth-values: &lt;math&gt;C(u\otimes v)&lt;/math&gt; .This matrix reproduces the features of the classical conjunction truth-table in its formulation:

::&lt;math&gt;C=s(s\otimes s)^T + n(s\otimes n)^T + n(n\otimes s)^T + n(n\otimes n)^T &lt;/math&gt;

::and verifies

::&lt;math&gt;C(s\otimes s)=s,&lt;/math&gt; and

::&lt;math&gt;C(s\otimes n)=C(n\otimes s)=C(n\otimes n)=n.&lt;/math&gt;

* '''[[∨|Disjunction]]'''. The disjunction (p∨q) is executed by the matrix
::&lt;math&gt;D=s(s\otimes s)^T+s(s\otimes n)^T+s(n\otimes s)^T+n(n\otimes n)^T,&lt;/math&gt; resulting in
::&lt;math&gt;D(s\otimes s)=D(s\otimes n)=D(n\otimes s)=s&lt;/math&gt; and
::&lt;math&gt;D(n\otimes n)=n.&lt;/math&gt;

* '''[[Logical implication|Implication]]'''. The implication corresponds in classical logic to the expression p&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;q&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;¬p&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;q. The vector logic version of this equivalence leads to a matrix that represents this implication in vector logic: &lt;math&gt;L=D(N\otimes I)&lt;/math&gt;. The explicit expression for this implication is:

::&lt;math&gt;L=s(s\otimes s)^T+n(s\otimes n)^T+s(n\otimes s)^T+s(n\otimes n)^T,&lt;/math&gt;

::and the properties of classical implication are satisfied:
::&lt;math&gt;L(s\otimes s)=L(n\otimes s)=L(n\otimes n)=s&lt;/math&gt; and
::&lt;math&gt;L(s\otimes n)=n.&lt;/math&gt;

* '''[[Logical equivalence|Equivalence]] and [[Exclusive or]]'''. In vector logic the equivalence p≡q is represented by the following matrix:
::&lt;math&gt;E=s(s\otimes s)^T+n(s\otimes n)^T+n(n\otimes s)^T+s(n\otimes n)^T&lt;/math&gt; with

::&lt;math&gt;E(s\otimes s)=E(n\otimes n)=s&lt;/math&gt; and

::&lt;math&gt;E(s\otimes n)=E(n\otimes s)=n.&lt;/math&gt;

::The Exclusive or is the negation of the equivalence, ¬(p≡q); it corresponds with the matrix &lt;math&gt;X=NE&lt;/math&gt; given by

::&lt;math&gt;X=n(s\otimes s)^T+s(s\otimes n)^T+s(n\otimes s)^T+n(n\otimes n)^T,&lt;/math&gt;

::with &lt;math&gt;X(s\otimes s)=X(n\otimes n)=n&lt;/math&gt; and

::&lt;math&gt;X(s\otimes n)=X(n\otimes s)=s.&lt;/math&gt;

* '''[[Sheffer stroke|NAND]] and [[Peirce arrow|NOR]]'''
The matrices ''S'' and ''P'' correspond to the [[Sheffer stroke|Sheffer]] (NAND) and the [[Logical NOR|Peirce]] (NOR) operations, respectively:
::&lt;math&gt;S=NC&lt;/math&gt;   
::&lt;math&gt;P=ND&lt;/math&gt;

=== De Morgan's law ===
In the two-valued logic, the conjunction and the disjunction operations satisfy the [[De Morgan's Laws|De Morgan's law]]: p∧q≡¬(¬p∨¬q), and its dual: p∨q≡¬(¬p∧¬q)). For the two-valued vector logic this Law is also verified:

::&lt;math&gt;C(u\otimes v)=ND(Nu\otimes Nv)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''u'' and ''v'' are two logic vectors.

The Kronecker product implies the following factorization:

::&lt;math&gt;C(u\otimes v)=ND(N\otimes N)(u\otimes v).&lt;/math&gt;

Then it can be proved that in the two–dimensional vector logic the De Morgan's law is a law involving operators, and not only a law concerning operations:&lt;ref name="miz96"&gt;Mizraji, E. (1996) The operators of vector logic. Mathematical Logic Quarterly, 42, 27–39&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;C=ND(N\otimes N)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Law of contraposition ===
In the classical propositional calculus, the [[Contraposition (traditional logic)|Law of Contraposition]] ''p''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;¬''q''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;¬''p'' is proved because the equivalence holds for all the possible combinations of truth-values of ''p'' and ''q''.&lt;ref name="suppes"&gt;Suppes, P. (1957) Introduction to Logic, Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, in vector logic, the law of contraposition emerges from a chain of equalities within the rules of matrix algebra and Kronecker products, as shown in what follows:

::&lt;math&gt;L(u\otimes v)=D(N\otimes I)(u\otimes v)=D(Nu\otimes v)=D(Nu\otimes NNv)=&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; D(NNv\otimes Nu)=D(N\otimes I)(Nv\otimes Nu)=L(Nv\otimes Nu)&lt;/math&gt;

This result is based in the fact that ''D'', the disjunction matrix, represents a commutative operation.

== Many-valued two-dimensional logic ==
[[Many-valued logic]] was developed by many researchers, particularly by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] and allows extending logical operations to truth-values that include uncertainties.&lt;ref&gt;Łukasiewicz, J. (1980) Selected Works. L. Borkowski, ed., pp. 153–178. North-Holland,
Amsterdam, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of two-valued vector logic, uncertainties in the truth values can be introduced using vectors with ''s'' and ''n'' weighted by probabilities.

Let &lt;math&gt;f=\epsilon s + \delta n&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\epsilon, \delta \in [0,1], \epsilon + \delta = 1&lt;/math&gt; be this kind of “probabilistic” vectors. Here, the many-valued character of the logic is introduced [[A priori and a posteriori|''a posteriori'']] via the uncertainties introduced in the inputs.&lt;ref name="miz92"/&gt;

===Scalar projections of vector outputs===
The outputs of this many-valued logic can be projected on scalar functions and generate a particular class of probabilistic logic with similarities with the many-valued logic of Reichenbach.&lt;ref&gt;Rescher, N. (1969) Many-Valued Logic. McGraw–Hill, New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blanché, R. (1968) Introduction à la Logique Contemporaine, Armand Colin, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klir, G.J., Yuan, G. (1995) Fuzzy Sets and Fuzzy Logic. Prentice–Hall, New Jersey&lt;/ref&gt;  Given two vectors &lt;math&gt;u=\alpha s + \beta n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v=\alpha's + \beta'n&lt;/math&gt; and a dyadic logical matrix &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, a scalar probabilistic logic is provided by the projection over vector&amp;nbsp;''s'':

::&lt;math&gt;Val(\mathrm{scalars}) = s^TG(\mathrm{vectors})&lt;/math&gt;

Here are the main results of these projections:

::&lt;math&gt;NOT(\alpha)=s^TNu=1-\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;OR(\alpha,\alpha')=s^TD(u\otimes v)=\alpha + \alpha' - \alpha\alpha'&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;AND(\alpha,\alpha')=s^TC(u\otimes v)=\alpha\alpha'&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;IMPL(\alpha,\alpha')=s^TL(u\otimes v)=1-\alpha(1-\alpha')&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;XOR(\alpha,\alpha')=s^TX(u\otimes v)=\alpha+\alpha'-2\alpha\alpha'&lt;/math&gt;

The associated negations are:
::&lt;math&gt;NOR(\alpha,\alpha')=1-OR(\alpha,\alpha')&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;NAND(\alpha,\alpha')=1-AND(\alpha,\alpha')&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;EQUI(\alpha,\alpha')=1-XOR(\alpha,\alpha')&lt;/math&gt;

If the scalar values belong to the set {0, ½, 1}, this many-valued scalar logic is for many of the operators almost identical to the 3-valued logic of Łukasiewicz. Also, it has been proved that when the monadic or dyadic operators act over probabilistic vectors belonging to this set, the output is also an element of this set.&lt;ref name="miz96"/&gt;

Early attempts to use linear algebra to represent logic operations can be referred to [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] and [[Irving Copi|Copilowish]],&lt;ref&gt;Copilowish, I.M. (1948) Matrix development of the calculus of relations. Journal of Symbolic Logic, 13, 193–203&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the use of [[logical matrix|logical matrices]] to interpret the [[algebraic logic#Calculus of relations|calculus of relations]].

The approach has been inspired in [[neural network]] models based on the use of high-dimensional matrices and vectors.&lt;ref&gt;Kohonen, T. (1977) Associative Memory: A System-Theoretical Approach. Springer-Verlag, New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mizraji, E. (1989) [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02458441 Context-dependent associations in linear distributed memories]. Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, 50, 195–205&lt;/ref&gt; Vector logic is a direct translation into a matrix-vector formalism of the classical [[Boolean algebra|Boolean polynomials]].&lt;ref name="boole"&gt;Boole, G. (1854) An Investigation of the Laws of Thought, on which are Founded the Theories of Logic and Probabilities. Macmillan, London, 1854; Dover, New York Reedition, 1958&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of formalism has been applied to develop a [[fuzzy logic]] in terms of [[complex numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;Dick, S. (2005) Towards complex fuzzy logic. IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 15,405–414, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Other matrix and vector approaches to logical calculus have been developed in the framework of [[quantum physics]], [[computer science]] and [[optics]].&lt;ref&gt;Mittelstaedt, P. (1968) Philosophische Probleme der Modernen Physik, Bibliographisches Institut, Mannheim&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stern, A. (1988) Matrix Logic: Theory and Applications. North-Holland, Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indian people|Indian]] biophysicist [[G.N. Ramachandran]] developed a formalism using algebraic matrices and vectors to represent many operations of classical Jain Logic known as Syad and Saptbhangi. [[Indian logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Jain, M.K. (2011) Logic of evidence-based inference propositions, Current Science, 1663–1672, 100&lt;/ref&gt; It requires independent affirmative evidence for each assertion in a proposition, and does not make the assumption for binary complementation.

== Boolean polynomials ==

[[George Boole]] established the development of logical operations as polynomials.&lt;ref name="boole"/&gt; For the case of monadic operators (such as [[Identity function|identity]] or
[[Logical negation|negation]]), the Boolean polynomials look as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;f(x) = f(1)x + f(0)(1-x) &lt;/math&gt;

The four different monadic operations result from the different binary values for the coefficients. Identity operation requires ''f''(1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''f''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, and negation occurs if ''f''(1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''f''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.  For the 16 dyadic operators, the Boolean polynomials are of the form:

::&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = f(1,1)xy + f(1,0)x(1-y) +f(0,1)(1-x)y + f(0,0)(1-x)(1-y)&lt;/math&gt;

The dyadic operations can be translated to this polynomial format when the coefficients ''f'' take the values indicated in the respective [[truth table]]s. For instance: the [[Sheffer stroke|NAND]] operation requires that:
::&lt;math&gt; f(1,1)=0&lt;/math&gt;    and    &lt;math&gt;f(1,0)=f(0,1)=f(0,0)=1&lt;/math&gt;. 
These Boolean polynomials can be immediately extended to any number of variables, producing a large potential variety of logical operators.
In vector logic, the matrix-vector structure of logical operators is an exact translation to the format of linear algebra of these Boolean polynomials, where the ''x'' and ''1-x'' correspond to vectors ''s'' and ''n'' respectively (the same for ''y'' and ''1-y''). In the example of NAND, ''f(1,1)=n'' and ''f(1,0)=f(0,1)=f(0,0)=s'' and the matrix version becomes:

::&lt;math&gt;S=n(s\otimes s)^T + s[(s\otimes n)^T+(n\otimes s)^T+(n\otimes n)^T]&lt;/math&gt;

==Extensions==

* Vector logic can be extended to include many truth values since large dimensional vector spaces allow to create many orthogonal truth values and the corresponding logical matrices.&lt;ref name="miz08"/&gt;
* Logical modalities can be fully represented in this context, with recursive process inspired in [[Artificial neuron|neural models]]&lt;ref name="miz08"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mizraji, E.

Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic, 35, 272–283&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some cognitive problems about logical computations can be analyzed using this formalism, in particular recursive decisions. Any logical expression of classical propositional calculus can be naturally represented by a [[tree structure]].&lt;ref name="suppes"/&gt; This fact is retained by vector logic, and has been partially used in neural models focused in the investigation of the branched structure of natural languages.&lt;ref&gt;Mizraji, E., Lin, J.

'''Vincent Ferrer''', [[Dominican Order|O.P.]] ({{lang-ca-valencia|Sant Vicent Ferrer}} {{IPA-ca|ˈsam viˈsɛm feˈreɾ|}}; 23 January 1350 – 5 April 1419) was a [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencian]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]], who gained acclaim as a [[missionary]] and a [[logician]]. He is honored as a [[saint]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

==Early life==
[[File:San Vicent Casa Natalicia.jpg|right|thumb|left|upright|Inside the birthhouse of Vincent Ferrer, [[Valencia]].]]
[[File:Església de Sant Esteve voltes.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Iglesia de San Esteban, Valencia|Iglesia de San Esteban]] in Valencia, in this church Vincent Ferrer was baptized.]]
Vincent was the fourth child of the [[nobility|nobleman]] Guillem Ferrer, a notary who came from [[Palamós]], and  wife, Constança Miquel, apparently from [[Valencia]] itself or [[Girona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.normalitzacio.cat/testimonis/index.php?sec=testimonis&amp;n=5555 "Sant Vicent Ferrer, patró de l'antic Regne de València"], by Àngel Canet Català, ''[[Vilaweb]]'', 31 March 2008, reprinted in ''Normalització'', {{ca}}.

(p. 490)&lt;/ref&gt;  Legends surround his birth. It was said that his father was told in a dream by a Dominican friar that his son would be famous throughout the world. His mother is said never to have experienced pain when she gave birth to him. He was named after St. [[Vincent of Saragossa|Vincent Martyr]], the patron saint of Valencia.&lt;ref name=minnaji/&gt; He would fast on Wednesdays and Fridays and he loved the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]] very much. He would help the poor and distribute alms to them. He began his classical studies at the age of eight, his study of [[theology]] and philosophy at fourteen.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15437a.htm Reinhart, Albert. "St. Vincent Ferrer." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 11 Feb. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years later, at the age of nineteen, Ferrer entered the Order of Preachers,&lt;ref name=cna&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint.php?n=426 "St. Vincent Ferrer", Catholic News Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; commonly called the [[Dominican Order]], in England also known as Blackfriars. As soon as he had entered the [[novitiate]] of the Order, though, he experienced temptations urging him to leave. Even his parents pleaded with him to do so and become a [[secular clergy|secular priest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.op.org/en/index.php/eng/about-us/history-a-more/portraits/106-st-vincent-ferrer-1350-1419 International website of the Order of Preachers "St. Vincent Ferrer"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He prayed and practiced penance to overcome these trials. Thus he succeeded in completing the year of probation and advancing to his [[profession]].

For a period of three years, he read solely [[Bible|Sacred Scripture]] and eventually committed it to memory. He published a treatise on Dialectic Suppositions after his solemn profession, and in 1379 was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a [[Catholic priest]] at Barcelona. He eventually became a [[Master of Sacred Theology]] and was [[commission (document)|commission]]ed by the Order to deliver lectures on philosophy. He was then sent to [[Barcelona]] and eventually to the [[University of Lleida]], where he earned his [[Doctor of Theology|doctorate in theology]].&lt;ref name="ewtn.com"/&gt;

Vincent Ferrer is described as a man of medium height, with a lofty forehead and very distinct features. His hair was fair in color and tonsured. His eyes were very dark and expressive; his manner gentle. Pale was his ordinary color. His voice was strong and powerful, at times gentle, resonant, and vibrant.&lt;ref name=minnaji&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://churchofstvincentferrer.org/stvincentofferrer.html |title=Minnaji O.P., Cora.

==Western Schism==
[[File:Église Saint-André (Brech) 4240.JPG|thumb|St. Vincent Ferrer, Église Saint-André (Brech)]]
The [[Western Schism]] (1378–1418) divided Roman Catholicism between two, then eventually three, claimants to the papacy. [[Antipope]] Clement VII lived at Avignon in France, and Pope Urban VI in Rome. Vincent was convinced that the election of Urban was invalid, although [[Catherine of Siena]] was just as devoted a supporter of the Roman pope. In the service of Cardinal Pedro de Luna, Vincent worked to persuade Spaniards to follow Clement. When Clement died in 1394, Cardinal de Luna was elected as the second antipope successor to the [[Avignon papacy]] and took the name Benedict XIII.&lt;ref name=foley&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1344 Foley OFM, Leonard, "St. Vincent Ferrer", ''Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons, and Feast'', (revised by Pat McCloskey), Franciscan Media] {{ISBN|978-0-86716-887-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vincent was loyal to [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]], commonly known as "Papa Luna" in Castile and Aragon.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt; He worked for Benedict XIII as apostolic penitentiary and Master of the Sacred Palace.&lt;ref name=foley/&gt; Nonetheless Vincent labored to have Benedict XIII end the schism.&lt;ref name="ewtn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/FERRER.htm |title='&amp;#39;The Lives or the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal Saints'&amp;#39; by Rev. Alban Butler |publisher=Ewtn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Benedict XIII did not resign as intended at either the [[Council of Pisa]] (1409) or the [[Council of Constance]] (1414–1418), he lost the support of the French king and of most of his cardinals, and was excommunicated as a schismatic in 1417. Vincent encouraged King Ferdinand I of Aragon to withdraw his support from Benedict XIII.

Vincent later claimed that the Western Schism had had such a depressing effect on his mind that it caused him to be seriously ill.&lt;ref name=Hogan&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/saintvincentferr00hogauoft Hogan O.P., Stanislaus M., ''Saint Vincent Ferrer O.P.'', London: Longmans, Green and Co., 1911]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious gifts and missionary work==
For twenty-one years he was said to have traveled to [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], [[Aragon]], [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], [[France]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Italy]], preaching the [[Gospel]] and converting many. Many biographers believe that he could speak only [[valencian language|Valencian]], but was endowed with the [[gift of tongues]].&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt;

He preached to St. [[Colette of Corbie]] and to her [[nuns]], and it was she who told him that he would die in France. Too ill to return to Spain, he did, indeed, die in [[Brittany]] in 1419. Breton fishermen still invoke his aid in storms, and in Spain he is the patron of orphanages.&lt;ref&gt;Website O.P.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion of Jews and controversy==
Vincent is said to have been responsible for the conversion of many [[Jews]] to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], often by questionable means according to the Jewish Encyclopedia, although this claim is disputable {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}; for instance, he is said to have made their lives difficult until they converted and to have "dedicated" synagogues as churches on the basis of his own authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=120&amp;letter=F&amp;search=ferrer |title=Jewish Encyclopedia, Vincent Ferrer |publisher=Jewishencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his converts, a former [[rabbi]] by the name of [[Paul of Burgos|Solomon ha-Levi]], went on to become the [[Bishop of Cartagena]] and later the [[Archbishop of Burgos]]. Vincent is alleged to have contributed to [[Antisemitism in Spain|anti-Semitism in Spain]], as violence accompanied his visits to towns that had Jewish communities.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kINwT_56U8C&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166&amp;dq=vincent+ferrer+antisemitism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5L56jA6OW1&amp;sig=YO6F5SFO_YsK8J2rTFdIUiowOeU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aiVoTd_GFIX6lwfjhIn_AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The History of Anti-Semitism: From Mohammed to the Marranos – Léon Poliakov – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the Spanish's [[History of the Jews in Spain#1391.E2.80.931492|harsh methods of converting Jews at the time]], the means which Vincent had at his disposal were either baptism or [[spoliation]]. He won them over by his preaching, estimated at 25,000.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt;

Sources are contradictory concerning Vincent's achievement in converting a synagogue in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], Spain, into the Church of [[Santa María la Blanca]]. One source says he preached to the mobs whose riots led to the appropriation of the synagogue and its transformation into a church in 1391;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://agora.qc.ca/reftext.nsf/Documents/Religion--La_religion_en_Occident__Grandes_ou_petites_verites_par_Michel_Despland | accessdate = 2007-08-26 |first = Michel |last=Despland | publisher = Encyclopédie de l'Agora | title = La religion en Occident: Grandes ou petites vérités? |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; a second source says he converted the Jews of the city who then changed the synagogue to a church after they embraced the Faith, but hints at the year 1411.&lt;ref name="ewtn.com"/&gt; A third source identifies two distinct incidents, one in Valencia in 1391 and one in Toledo at a later date, but says that Vincent put down an uprising against Jews in one place and defused a persecution against them in the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://secondexodus.com/ Barrack, Marty, ''Second Exodus'']&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent also attended the [[Disputation of Tortosa]] (1413–14), called by Avignon Pope Benedict XIII in an effort to convert Jews to Catholicism after a debate among scholars of both faiths.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

==Compromise of Caspe==
Vincent participated in the management of a significant political crisis in his homeland. King [[Martin of Aragon]] died in 1410 without a legitimate heir, and five potential candidates came forth to claim the throne, all with royal bloodlines. It was determined that a committee of nine respected figures, three each from Aragon, Catalonia, and Valencia (the realms comprising the [[Crown of Aragon]]), would review the qualifications and select the next king. Vincent was chosen as one of the representatives of Valencia, and he voted for the Castilian prince [[Ferdinand of Antequera]], who became the next King of Aragon. The process by which Ferdinand was determined to be the next king is known as the [[Compromise of Caspe]].

==Death and legacy==
Vincent died on 5 April 1419 at [[Vannes]] in [[Brittany]], at the age of sixty-nine,&lt;ref name=cna/&gt; and was buried in [[Vannes Cathedral]]. He was [[canonized]] by [[Pope Calixtus III]] on 3 June 1455.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt; His [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] is celebrated on 5 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drees|first=Clayton J.|title=The Late Medieval Age of Crisis and Renewal, 1300-1500: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8jDfydG6ReAC|accessdate=4 April 2018|year=2001|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=0313305889|page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fraternity of Saint Vincent Ferrer]], a pontifical [[religious institute]] founded in 1979, is named for him,{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} as well two Brazilian municipalities, [[São Vicente Ferrer, Maranhão]] and [[São Vicente Ferrer, Pernambuco]].

"Vincent Ferrer", an obvious reference to the saint, was an alias used by the character [[Simon Templar]] in the 1997 movie [[The Saint (1997 film)|The Saint]], starring [[Val Kilmer]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3114">'''Welfarism''' is a form of [[consequentialism]].  Like all forms of consequentialism, welfarism is based on the premise that actions, policies, and/or rules should be evaluated on the basis of their consequences.  Welfarism is the view that the morally significant consequences are impacts on human (or animal) welfare.  There are many different understandings of human welfare, but the term "welfarism" is usually associated with the economic conception of welfare.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}  Economists usually think of individual welfare in terms of [[utility function]]s, a perspective in which social welfare can be conceived as an aggregation of individual utilities or utility functions.

''Welfarist'' views have been especially influential in the [[law and economics]] movement. Steven Shavell and Louis Kaplow have argued in an influential book, ''Fairness versus Welfare'' that welfare should be the exclusive criteria by which legal analysts evaluate legal policy choices.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Kaplow and Steven Shavell, ''Fairness versus Welfare'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press 2002) {{ISBN|0-674-00622-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Penal welfarism==
Penal welfarism is a theory in the study of [[criminal justice]] which holds that prisoners should have the right and the positive motivation to gain opportunities for advancement within the criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=u3sSVezrTB4C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s  David Garland, "The Crisis of Penal Modernism", '''The Culture of Control: Crime and Social Order in Contemporary Society,''' pp. 53-73, University of Chicago Press (2002).] {{ISBN|0226283844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome utilitarianism, welfarism, and sum-ranking==
[[Amartya Sen]] (1979) provides the following two definitions:

"Welfarism: The judgment of the relative goodness of alternative states of affairs must be based exclusively on, and taken as an increasing function of, the respective collections of individual utilities in these states."

"Sum-ranking: One collection of individual utilities is at least as good as another if and only if it has at least as large a sum total."

Sen makes the statement: "It is easily checked that welfarism and sum-ranking together are exactly equivalent to outcome utilitarianism." He then proceeds to criticize outcome utilitarianism by criticizing each of its two components: first sum-ranking, and then welfarism.

'''William Irwin''' (born 1970) is Professor of [[Philosophy]] at [[King's College (Pennsylvania)|King's College]] in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]] and is best known for originating the "philosophy and popular culture" book genre with ''Seinfeld and Philosophy: A Book about Everything and Nothing'' in 1999 and ''[[The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer]]'' in 2001.

== Early life ==
Irwin was born in 1970 and raised in [[Yonkers, New York]]. He attended [[Regis High School (New York City)|Regis High School]] in [[Manhattan]], an elite Jesuit institution, graduating in 1988. He received his B.A. in Philosophy from [[Fordham University]] in 1992 where he graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and Summa cum Laude, having attended Fordham on a full Presidential Scholarship. He later received his Ph.D. in Philosophy from the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]] in 1996 at the age of 26. Irwin’s dissertation, “Harmonizing Hermeneutics: The Normative and Descriptive Approaches, Interpretation and Criticism,” was awarded the Perry Prize for Outstanding Dissertations in Philosophy. His dissertation director was [[Jorge J.E. Gracia]]. [[E.D. Hirsch, Jr.]] was his external evaluator.

== Contributions to philosophy ==

Irwin’s most recent book is ''God Is a Question, Not an Answer: Finding Common Ground in Our Uncertainty'', published by Rowman &amp; Littlefield.

He is also the author of two novels, ''Free Dakota'' and ''Little Siddhartha'', a sequel to [[Hermann Hesse]]'s novel ''[[Siddhartha (novel)|Siddhartha]]''.

''The Free Market Existentialist: Capitalism without Consumerism'' was published by Wiley-Blackwell in 2015. [[Michael Shermer]], the editor of ''Skeptic'' magazine, praised the book, saying “William Irwin has transcended ideology and tribalism to unite a set of ideas that, for the first time, could end the rancor between the Left and the Right by reminding each of their shared values. This book will change the thinking of everyone interested in politics, economics, or religion—a game changing work.”

Irwin’s first book, ''Intentionalist Interpretation: A Philosophical Explanation and Defense'', was nominated for the American Philosophical Association Young Scholar’s Book Prize and was the subject of a special book session at the annual meeting of the Canadian Society for Hermeneutics and Postmodern Thought in May 2000.

Irwin has published scholarly articles in leading journals such as ''[[Philosophy and Literature]]'', ''[[Philosophy Today]]'', ''[[Journal of Value Inquiry]]'', and ''[[The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism]]''.

Irwin is best known for having originated the philosophy and popular culture genre of books with ''Seinfeld and Philosophy: A Book about Everything and Nothing'' in 1999 and then the popular ''[[The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer]]'' in 2001. He was editor of these books and then series editor of the Popular Culture and Philosophy Series through [[Open Court Publishing Company]], producing titles such as ''Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts'', ''Star Wars and Philosophy: More Powerful Than You Can Possibly Imagine'', ''Superheroes and Philosophy: Truth, Justice, and the Socratic Way'', and many others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opencourtbooks.com/categories/pcp.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Carlin Romano from ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' called the Popular Culture and Philosophy Series “the most serious philosophy series on the market, if some link between academic seriousness and real life still exists.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opencourtbooks.com/books_n/more_matrix.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Stephen T. Asma called William Irwin the “chief architect” of the philosophy and popular culture movement.&lt;ref&gt;Vol 54, Issue 7, p. B14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Irwin left Open Court to become the General Editor of The Blackwell Philosophy and Pop Culture Series through [[Wiley-Blackwell]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-324354.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reuters]] (now [[Thomson Reuters]]) reported that Irwin’s books have sold more than one million copies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSTRE5241J320090305?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today]]'' was the first in that series, published in 2006. ''Metallica and Philosophy: A Crash Course in Brain Surgery'' followed shortly thereafter; Scott Ian from [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] called it “a kick-ass read.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metclub.fi/pics/Metallica+PR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The series also includes ''Black Sabbath and Philosophy: Mastering Reality'' published in 2012. Irwin is quoted in USA Today as claiming that "the books are about smart popular culture for smart fans.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Donahue|first=Deirdre|title='Terminator' gets 'smart' pop-culture treatment|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20090317/philosophy17_st.art.htm|newspaper=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irwin first theorized the philosophy and pop culture genre in his article “Philosophy as/and/of Popular Culture” in Irwin and Gracia eds. ''Philosophy and the Interpretation of Popular Culture'' (Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2006), pp.&amp;nbsp;41–63. In 2010 he explained the motivation for the series and defended it against critics in an article in ''The Philosophers’ Magazine'' titled [http://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/55564/fancy-taking-pop.pdf “Fancy Taking a Pop?”] Irwin defended the style of the books in [http://commons.pacificu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1490&amp;context=eip “Writing for the Reader: A Defense of Philosophy and Popular Culture Books”].

When Irwin was with Open Court, he edited ''The Matrix and Philosophy: Welcome to the Desert of the Real,'' which [[Anderson Cooper]] referred to as an "interesting collection of thoughts on the movie and its place in the world" in an interview with Irwin.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFcKTva9oQQ&lt;/ref&gt; Irwin also discussed a follow-up book, ''More Matrix and Philosophy: Revolutions and Reloaded Decoded'', in an interview with [[Keith Olbermann]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DMWxSuYqsg&lt;/ref&gt;

Irwin has appeared as a guest on hundreds of radio and television shows. He has been interviewed by ''Time'', ''The New York Times'', the ''Los Angeles Times'', ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', USA Today, the BBC, CNN, NPR, and MSNBC, among others. In a 2010 interview with ''Time'', Irwin said “Philosophy has had a bad rap for centuries. People mistakenly think it has nothing to do with their everyday lives, including enjoying media.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2009261,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning readers’ reaction to the book series, Irwin told ''The Wall Street Journal'', "I think an equal amount of people find it either too fluffy or too rigorous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hollander|first=Sophia|title=That Pop Song May Provide a Classics Lesson|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324235304578436690052254624?KEYWORDS=SOPHIA+HOLLANDER&amp;mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424127887324235304578436690052254624.html%3FKEYWORDS%3DSOPHIA%2BHOLLANDER|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=April 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012 Irwin was named Outstanding Alumnus by the Philosophy Department at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]]. He is the first person ever to receive this award.

A picture and description of [http://chronicle.com/blogPost/And-Still-More-Scholarly-Ink/20545/ one of Irwin’s tattoos] appeared in The Chronicle of Higher Education blog.

Along with David Kyle Johnson, Irwin writes the blog [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/plato-pop "Plato on Pop"] for Psychology Today.

He also maintains the blog [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/it-s-your-choice “It’s Your Choice: The Free Market Existentialist Perspective”] for Psychology Today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2473">"'''Wpływologia'''" ("influenceology") is a [[Poland|Polish]] term that is sometimes used within the [[History of literature|history]] and theory of [[literature]], the [[History of art|history]] and theory of [[art]], the [[History of music|history]] and [[theory of music]], and even within [[history|general history]]. The term expresses skepticism about exaggerated attempts at tracking down alleged "[[Social influence|influence]]s" among [[artist]]s, [[scholar]]s and their respective works. 

==History==
The term ''wpływologia'' was formed from the Polish ''wpływ'' ("influence") and from ''-logia'', a [[ancient Greek|Greek]]-derived suffix meaning "science."

The term was coined after [[World War I]] by Polish [[literary critic]] [[Adam Grzymała-Siedlecki]]. (According to [[Karol Irzykowski]], its author was actually the prominent author and [[translator]] [[Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karol Irzykowski]], ''Słoń wśród porcelany'' (A Bulll in a 
China Shop), [http://univ.gda.pl/~literat/irzykow/0004.htm online version]&lt;/ref&gt;) The [[neologism]] immediately won currency among Polish scholars and literary critics due to the anti-[[Positivism in Poland|positivist]] turn that the [[humanities]] had taken in the early 20th century.

The term ''wpływologia'' made light of certain [[positivist]] practices that had been common in the 19th-century humanities. Positivist history of literature had posited that the study of literature may be regarded as scientific only when it deals with [[fact]]s, and that scientific analysis must formulate general [[laws of science|laws]]. Positivist analysis saw these laws as being embodied in  "influences" (''"wpływy"'') obtaining among various writers and their works. 

This view had led some positivist-influenced literary historians to propose outlandish theories concerning "influences" on specific literary works. Even the greatest masterpieces had sometimes been seen as mere recombinations of influences derived from earlier works, rather than as independent works in their own right.

'''Yolteotl''' is an [[Nahuatl language|Nahua]] word from [[Mexico]] meaning the "heart of God" or someone who contains an almost spiritual creativity ("an enlightened mind").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1409594|title=Rediscovering the Sacred: From the Secular to a Postmodern Sense of the Sacred|first=Arnoldo C.|last=Vento|date=1 January 2000|publisher=|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=15|issue=1|pages=183–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of '''''[[wiktionary:yollotl|yollotl]]''''' ([[heart]]) and ''[[teotl]]'' (God, spirit, force, or movement).   In Yaqui/Chicana spirituality, which can combine aspects of traditional and Catholic " 'root concepts' (which resonate in all the world's religions)," Yolteotl compares with the Catholic concept of The Sacred Heart (Spanish: El Sagrado Corazon).&lt;ref&gt;Broyles-Gonzalez, Yolanda. ''"Indianizing Catholicism: Chicana/India/Mexicana indigenous spiritual practices in our image."'' in Cantu, Norma E. and Najira-Ramirez, Olga (Eds.) ''"CHICANA TRADITIONS: CONTINUITY &amp; CHANGE."'' (2002). Ch. 6, p.128. IL: Univ. of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophically, Yolteotl is a state of oneness with the universe to be obtained through personal efforts, similar to [[Nirvana (concept)|Nirvana]] in [[Buddhism]], although Nirvana is an inward form of enlightenment while Yolteotl is an outward form of enlightenment geared towards creation.

==In art and popular culture==
The term was used in the [[anime]] ''[[RahXephon]]'' to describe a state of being, much like the philosophical definition, in which the Xephon System could be used for its true purpose: the recreation of the world.

The related term "yollotl" (meaning "heart") is used in ''Wizard101'' as the name of a mystical place, pursued throughout the world of Azteca, which based on Mayan and Aztec cultures.

The Arabic ''zindīq'' is a loan word from pre-Islamic [[Middle Persian]] 𐭦𐭭𐭣𐭩𐭪 ''zandik'', a [[Zoroastrian]] term of uncertain etymology and meaning (for a discussion of the term in a pre-Islamic context, see ''[[zandik]]'').

Under the 8th-century [[Abbasid]]s, Arabic ''zindīq'' and the adjectival ''zandaqa'' could "denote many different things, though it seems primarily (or at least initially) to have signified a follower of [[Manichaeism]]."&lt;ref name="Zaman1997"&gt;{{citation|last=Zaman|first=Muhammad Qasim|title=Religion and Politics Under the Early 'Abbasids: The Emergence of the Proto-Sunni Elite|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0xkpdl6UVOwC&amp;pg=PA64|year=1997|publisher=Brill|pages=63-65}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of those persecuted for ''zandaqa'' under the Abbasids claimed to be Muslims, and when applied to Muslims, the accusation was that the accused secretly harbored Manichaean beliefs.&lt;ref name="Zaman1997" /&gt; "The proof for such an accusation was sought, if at all, in an indication of some kind of dualism, or if that individual openly flouted Islamic beliefs or practices."&lt;ref name="Zaman1997" /&gt; As such, certain Muslim poets of early Abbasid times could thus also be accused of ''zandaqa'' as much as an actual Manichaean might.&lt;ref name="Zaman1997" /&gt;

The charge of ''zandaqa'' was a serious one, and could cost the accused his/her life.&lt;ref name="Zaman1997" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bowker|first=John|chapter=Zindiq|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions|year=1997|publisher=OUP}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A history of the time states cites the "Spiller" caliph [[As-Saffah|Abu al-'Abbas]] as having said "tolerance is laudable, except in matters dangerous to religious belief, or to the sovereign's dignity."&lt;ref name="Glasse" /&gt; The third Abbasid caliph, [[Al-Mahdi]], ordered the composition of polemnical works to refute freethinkers and other heretics, and for years he tried to exterminate them absolutely, hunting them down and exterminating freethinkers in large numbers, putting to death anyone on mere suspicion of being a ''zindiq''.&lt;ref name="Glasse"&gt;{{citation|last=Glassé|first=Cyril|chapter=Zindiq|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2013|edition=4th|page=491}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Al-Mahdi's successors, the caliphs [[al-Hadi]] and [[Harun al-Rashid]], continued the pogroms, although with diminished intensity during the reign of the latter and was later abolished by him.&lt;ref name="Zaman1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Christine"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aPgGBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCWoVChMIq56WlPLLxgIVSweOCh0SkAfF#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title= Medieval Heresies|author= Christine Caldwell Ames|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|year= 2015|page= 88|isbn= 9781107023369}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy in turn influenced the [[Mihna]] policy of [[al-Ma'mun]] which targeted those Muslim religious scholars and officials who refused to accept the doctrine of created nature of Quran.&lt;ref name="Zaman1997" /&gt;

The reason for these persecutions are not easy to determine.&lt;ref name="Zaman1997" /&gt; ''Zandaqa'' was viewed as a threat to Islam, to Muslim society, and to the state.&lt;ref name="Zaman1997" /&gt; In the 8th century, Islamic norms were still under development and had not yet crystallized, and Muslims were still a small minority in the vast territories ruled by the caliphate, and even those who had converted were perceived to have been only "imperfectly" Islamized. Many of these converts had previously been Manichaeans, and Manichaeaism with its well developed missionary ideals had undergone a slight resurgence during early caliphate rule. As such, the Manichaeans were perceived as a threat to the security of the Muslim religious elite and to the Abbasid state. The threat was perceived to be especially evident in the quasi-scientific manner in which the Manichaeans posed unsettling questions, their skill at creating a favourable impression in public debate, and their ability in defending their own intellectually-appealing world-view.&lt;ref name="Zaman1997" /&gt;

==Later usage==
In time, Muslim theologians came to apply ''zindiq'' to "the criminal dissident—the professing Muslim who holds beliefs or follows practices contrary to the central dogmas of Islam and is therefore to be regarded as an apostate and an infidel. The jurists differ as to the theoretical formulation of the point of exclusion, but in fact usually adopt the practical criterion of open rebellion."&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; 

In modern times, the term ''zindiq'' is occasionally used to denote members of religions, sects or cults that originated in a Muslim society but are considered heretical or independent faiths by mainstream Muslims.&lt;ref name="Adamec2016"&gt;{{citation | last = Adamec | first = Ludwig W. | year=2016 | p=494 | chapter=Zindiq | title= Historical Dictionary of Islam | location = London | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield | isbn=1-4422-7723-8 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, a ''zindiq'' is perceived to be incorrigibly disloyal to the tenets of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hughes | first = Thomas Patrick | year = 1895| edition=2nd | page = 713 | chapter = Zindīq| title = Dictionary of Islam | location = London | publisher = W.H.
