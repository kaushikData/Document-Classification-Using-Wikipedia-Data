The '''Juba talks''' were a series of negotiations between the government of [[Uganda]] and the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] rebel group over the terms of a ceasefire and possible peace agreement.  The talks, held in [[Juba, Sudan|Juba]], the capital of autonomous [[Southern Sudan]], began in July 2006 and were mediated by [[Riek Machar]], the Vice President of Southern Sudan.  The talks, which had resulted in a ceasefire by September 2006, were described as the best chance ever for a negotiated settlement to the 20-year-old war.&lt;ref name=BBC_deadline&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4790049.stm Uganda hopeful about rebel talks], BBC News, 14 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However, LRA leader [[Joseph Kony]] refused to sign the peace agreement in April 2008.  Two months later, the LRA carried out an attack on a Southern Sudanese town, prompting the Government of Southern Sudan to officially withdraw from their mediation role.

==Preparations==
A delegation from the LRA arrived in [[Juba, Sudan]] on 8 June 2006 to prepare for talks with the Ugandan government, to be mediated by the [[Southern Sudan autonomous region (2005–2011)|Government of Southern Sudan]] &lt;ref name="juba_8_june"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5060666.stm LRA rebels arrive for Sudan talks], BBC News, 8 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Community of Sant'Egidio]].&lt;ref name="Sant'Egidio"&gt;{{it icon}}[http://santegidio.de/news/rassegna/2006/0820_004061_IT.htm "Guerra in Nord Uganda: la fine è a portata di mano"], [[Avvenire]], August 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  These talks were agreed to after Kony released a video in May in which he denied committing atrocities and seemed to call for an end to hostilities, in response to an announcement by Museveni that he would guarantee the safety of Kony if peace was agreed to by July. Museveni had pledged to grant Kony total amnesty if he gave up "[[terrorism]]". Uganda's security minister [[Amama Mbabazi]] urged the [[International Criminal Court]] to drop the indictments issued in 2005 against leaders of the LRA, but LRA legal adviser [[Krispus Ayena Odongo]] rejected the offer, saying that accepting amnesty "presupposes surrender" and would mean the LRA was no longer available for discussions.&lt;ref name="amnesty_rejection"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5157220.stm Uganda LRA rebels reject amnesty], [[BBC News]], 7 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="drop_charges"&gt;[http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1966651,00.html ICC urged to drop LRA charges] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229135255/http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1966651,00.html |date=2008-02-29 }}, [[BBC News]], 12 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Several organizations, including the ICC&lt;ref name="amnesty_offer"&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200607060715.html Museveni Amnesty to Kony Illegal - ICC], AllAfrica (The Monitor), 6 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Bar Association]]'s Human Rights Institute&lt;ref name="IBA_rejects_amnesty"&gt;[http://www.legalbrief.co.za/filemgmt/visit.php?lid=401 IBA says Ugandan Government must meet obligations under the Rome Statute], IBA News Release, 13 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; insisted that LRA leaders must be arrested in accordance with the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]]. 

[[Joseph Kony]] gave his first interview to the press after 20 years of carrying out the conflict in late June 2006. He denied that the LRA had carried out any atrocities and blamed President Museveni for oppressing the Acholi.&lt;ref name="kony_speaks"&gt;Sam Farmar, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/5124762.stm Uganda rebel leader breaks silence], BBC [[Newsnight]], 28 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless, in late June 2006, the Government of Southern Sudan formally invited Uganda to attend peace talks.&lt;ref name="sudan_invitation"&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=54279 UGANDA: Gov't to send team to Sudan over proposed LRA talks], IRIN, 28 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial negotiations==
On 14 July 2006 talks began in Juba between delegations from the LRA and Uganda, with the Vice-president of Southern Sudan [[Riek Machar]] as the chief mediator. The leader of the Ugandan delegation, Internal Affairs Minister [[Ruhakana Rugunda]] stated that his priority was to obtain a quick ceasefire.&lt;ref name="Rugunda_comment"&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200607140756.html Ceasefire First On Kony Agenda], AllAfrica (The Monitor), 15 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The LRA delegation, led by [[Martin Ojul]], said that LRA's acceptance of the peace talks should not be interpreted that LRA can no longer fight, but stressed that a negotiated settlement is the best way to end the conflict.&lt;ref name="Ojul_speech"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070401151418/http://www.sundayvision.co.ug/detail.php?mainNewsCategoryId=7&amp;newsCategoryId=132&amp;newsId=509505 Opening speech of LRA delegation at Juba talks], Sunday Vision, 15 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial delegation was criticized as largely consisting of expatriate Acholi, rather than members of the fighting force. However, after many delays [[Vincent Otti]] arrived for meetings on the 29th,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5227526.stm Key Uganda rebel 'attends talks'], BBC News, 29 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; followed the next day by Kony's 14-year-old son [[Salim Saleh Kony]] (sharing a name with brother of President Museveni, [[Salim Saleh]]).&lt;ref name="BBC meet"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5231042.stm Uganda officials 'meet LRA chief'], BBC News, 30 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Kony himself met with local religious and political leaders from northern Uganda and southern Sudan on the following day.&lt;ref name="BBC meet"/&gt;  On 2 August, Kony held his first ever press conference in which he demanded a ceasefire before LRA-government negotiations resumed on the 7th and denied ever abducting children. Some media sources noted that, of the approximately 80 LRA fighters surrounding the press venue, several appeared to be in their early teens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=54938 UGANDA: Government, rebels to resume talks in Sudan], IRIN, 2 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/archives/2006/08/rb_06_aug_16.html Video footage of peace talks in Juba, plus snippet of Kony press conference] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017135801/http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/archives/2006/08/rb_06_aug_16.html |date=2006-10-17 }}, video and commentary by Ruud Elmendorp presented on [[Rocketboom]], 16 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The broader context of the talks remained confused. The government of Southern Sudan views the talks as a means of ridding itself of a foreign army that is complicating their delicate relationship with the [[Khartoum]] government. The request by the Ugandan Government for ICC to suspend war crimes indictments against leaders of the LRA, condemned by international human rights groups but largely supported by leaders and civilians within northern Uganda, led some political analysts to see Ugandan Government's request as a ploy to gain local support.  The comment of a George Olara, an [[Internally displaced person|IDP]] living in a camp in [[Pader District|Pader]], was fairly typical: "He [Kony] should not be taken to [[The Hague]]. Let him come back and live with the community because this is how reconciliation will be achieved. ... [[Peace]] will come if the talks succeed, but there is the potential that they may also fail like they have done before".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=54920 UGANDA: Locals want rebel leader forgiven], IRIN, 1 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceasefire==
[[Image:Scharq al-Istiwa'iya.PNG|thumb|left|[[Owiny Ki-Bul]] is in [[East Equatoria]] (in red) bordering [[Uganda]] to the south, [[Kenya]] to the southeast and [[Ethiopia]] to the east.]]

On 4 August 2006, Vincent Otti declared a unilateral ceasefire and asked the Ugandan government to reciprocate. Ugandan Internal Affairs Minister [[Ruhakana Rugunda]] stated that they were waiting to see the effect on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5243038.stm LRA leaders declare ceasefire], BBC, 4 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  ICC indictee Raska Lukwiya was killed in battle on 12 August 2006; the LRA asked for three days of mourning though a spokesman said that talks would continue.&lt;ref name=BBC_deadline/&gt;  Ugandan President Museveni set a 12 September 2006 deadline to finalize a peace deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5264742.stm Uganda resumes talks with rebels] ''BBC News'' 18 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The government and LRA signed a truce on 26 August 2006.  Under the terms of the agreement, LRA forces were required to leave Uganda and gather in two assembly areas, where the Ugandan government promised they would not attack and the government of Southern Sudan guaranteed their safety. Once this is accomplished, talks on a comprehensive peace agreement would begin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5288776.stm Uganda and LRA rebels sign truce], BBC News, 26 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Although a final agreement was not reached by the 12 August deadline, LRA rebels began gathering in the assembly areas and the government delegation stated that they would not hold to the deadline.  Machar stated that several hundred rebels, including Otti, had gathered either at [[Ri-Kwangba]] in [[West Equatoria]] or [[Owiny Ki-Bul]] in [[East Equatoria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5337888.stm Uganda drops peace talks deadline], BBC, 12 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kitgum IDP camp from the air, Uganda.jpg|thumb|Huts in the [[Kitgum]] IDP camp are tightly packed together]]

The government also began a process of creating "satellite camps" to decongest the main IDP camps.  In Pader, 28 satellite sites were occupied out of 48 identified as of late September 2006, while the numbers in [[Kitgum]] were 21 of 36.  IDPs farther south in [[Teso sub-region|Teso]] and [[Lango sub-region|Lango]] were being encouraged to return home directly.  However, talks continued to be delayed.  On 23 September, the LRA delegation threatened to walk out of the negotiations, claiming that the UPDF had attacked their forces at Owiny Ki-Bul and demanding that composition of the government delegation be changed and that the ICC warrants be voided before any agreement.  Uganda denied the accusation of attacks.  Both delegations met with mediator Riek Machar on 25 September 2006, but not with each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=55722 UGANDA: Most rebels have left northern Uganda for Sudan - army], IRIN, 26 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks===
The negotiations were paused in early October while a Cessation of Hostilities monitoring team was sent to Owiny Ki-Bul.  The team found that no attack had taken place, but that the LRA had simply moved away from the designated site.  The team recommended that the LRA rebels regroup at Owiny Ki-Bul, while stating that the LRA had not honored the agreement and was using hostile propaganda, that the UPDF was located close to the assembly points and that the mediators had failed to provide armed guards for the assembled rebels.  On 11 October 2006, the LRA proposed that Uganda adopt a [[federalism|federalist]] structure, prompting criticism from the government spokesperson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=55906 UGANDA: Rebels propose federalist solution at Juba talks], [[IRIN]], 11 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 October 2006, Ugandan President [[Yoweri Museveni]] traveled to Juba to meet the LRA negotiators face-to-face for the first time in an attempt to revive the talks, described as "stalled" by ''[[BBC News]]'' and "faltering" by ''[[The Monitor (Uganda)|The Monitor]]'' newspaper.  A Uganda government source reported that the president spoke angrily and rebuked the LRA team several times, before later referring to the LRA as "unserious" in a subsequent address to South Sudan government officials.  A pall had been thrown over the talks by the murder of several dozen civilians, including the shooting of women and children in the head, near Juba during the two previous days.  The attacks were carried out by an as-yet unnamed group, but some suspected that the LRA was responsible for the mayhem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6072994.stm "LRA rebels meet Uganda's Museveni"], BBC News, 21 October 2006; [http://irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=56019 "SUDAN: Armed group kills 42 civilians"], ''IRIN'', 20 October 2006; and [http://www.monitor.co.ug/sunday/news/news10227.php "Museveni meets LRA face to face"]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[The Monitor (Uganda)|The Sunday Monitor]]'', 21 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

After a week-long impasse, the LRA and government signed a second truce on 1 November 2006 that mandated the monitoring team until 1 December. The previous agreement had technically expired in September.  As part of the agreement, the army was to withdraw from Owiny Ki-Bul, past a 30-km (18-mi) buffer zone.  The LRA was given a week to regroup at Owiny Ki-Bul, and four weeks to gather at Ri-Kwangba.  Both Kony and Otti refused to enter the camps, citing fear of arrest on the ICC warrants.  The agreement further stated that food would not be provided to LRA units outside the assembly points except in "exceptional circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;[http://irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=56146 "UGANDA: Revised gov't-LRA ceasefire deal signed"], ''IRIN'', 1 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the most significant moments for the LRA during the talks, [[United Nations]] [[Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator]] [[Jan Egeland]] met with Kony and Otti in the hopes of pushing the talks forward on 12 November 2006.  Egeland had previously stated that he would meet with Kony only if the LRA released abducted children and wounded members, but Kony denied that anyone in the LRA was either wounded or held against their will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6139554.stm "UN envoy sees Uganda rebel chief"], ''BBC News, 12 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The LRA declared that it was withdrawing from the talks on November 30, stating that UPDF had killed three of its fighters.  The deadline for the LRA fighters to finish gathering at the assembly points was 1 December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=56580 "UGANDA: Talks hit fresh snag amid rebel protest"], ''IRIN'', 30 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Uganda denied the charge.  Also, outgoing [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] appointed [[Joaquim Chissano]], former president of [[Mozambique]], to be the UN envoy to the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=56623 "UGANDA: Museveni optimistic peace will prevail"], ''IRIN'', 5 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The truce was further extended for two more months on 18 December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6190283.stm "Ugandan LRA rebel truce extended"], ''BBC News'', 18 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January 2007 Ojul stated that recent comments made by al-Bashir and Kiir clearly signified that the LRA was not welcome any longer in Sudan, and that further talks should occur in [[Kenya]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6255369.stm "Rebels snub Ugandan peace talks"], BBC News, 12 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200701200030.html "Uganda: LRA Quit Juba Talks, Govt Rejects Rebels' Demands"], allAfrica.com, 21 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 March 2007 the LRA stated it would once again return to the Juba talks.&lt;ref&gt;http://allafrica.com/stories/200703140450.html&lt;/ref&gt; After [[South Africa]], [[Kenya]] and [[Mozambique]] agreed to join the peace talks (a demand the LRA had made before it would return to Juba), the next round of talks was held from 13 April to 14 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200704021629.html allAfrica.com: Uganda: S. Africa, Kenya Join Juba Peace Talks (Page 1 of 1)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In this round, the ceasefire was extended until 30 June 2007, and [[Ri Kwangba]] was the agreed upon assembly point.  The next round of talks was set for 25 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monitor.co.ug/sunday/news/news041510.php "Govt, LRA talks underway"]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Sunday Monitor]], 15–21 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resumption==
Following this suspension in the peace talks, the [[Juba Initiative Project]] enabled the resumption of the talks in May 2007, thanks to the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for LRA-affected areas [[Joaquim Chissano]].  The talks were again mediated by the Government of [[Southern Sudan]], but with the support of the [[United Nations]] and logistic facilitation from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), under the leadership of her local head [[Eliane Duthoit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=72489 "SUDAN-UGANDA: LRA talks, pencils and helicopters"], ''IRIN'', 31 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June 2007, the sides agreed to the principles of how justice and reconciliation will be handled, the third of the five-point agenda.  The LRA and government agreed that both formal justice procedures and the traditional [[Mato Oput]] ceremony of reconciliation would play a role.  Government delegation spokesperson Barigye Ba-Hoku stated that they would attempt to convince the ICC that this would address their concerns about impunity and that arrests under ICC auspices would not be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=73010 |title=UGANDA: LRA talks reach agreement on accountability |publisher=Irinnews.org |date=2007-06-30 |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2007, an LRA delegation led by [[Martin Ojul]] journeyed to Kampala to restate their commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.  Ojul later led the delegation on a tour of northern Uganda to meet victims of the insurgency and ask their forgiveness.

'''Abstract index notation''' is a mathematical notation for [[tensor]]s and [[spinor]]s that uses indices to indicate their types, rather than their components in a particular basis.  The indices are mere placeholders, not related to any basis and, in particular, are non-numerical. Thus it should not be confused with the [[Ricci calculus]]. The notation was introduced by [[Roger Penrose]] as a way to use the formal aspects of the [[Einstein summation convention]] to compensate for the difficulty in describing [[tensor contraction|contraction]]s and [[covariant derivative|covariant differentiation]] in modern abstract tensor notation, while preserving the explicit [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariance]] of the expressions involved.

Let ''V'' be a [[vector space]], and ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; its [[dual space|dual]].  Consider, for example, an order-2 [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] tensor 
&lt;math&gt;h\in V^*\otimes V^*&lt;/math&gt;.  Then ''h'' can be identified with a [[bilinear form]] on ''V''.  In other words, it is a function of two arguments in ''V'' which can be represented as a pair of ''slots'':

: &lt;math&gt;h = h(-,-).&lt;/math&gt;

Abstract index notation is merely a ''labelling'' of the slots with Latin letters, which have no significance apart from their designation as labels of the slots (i.e., they are non-numerical):

: &lt;math&gt;h = h_{ab}.&lt;/math&gt;

A [[tensor contraction]] (or trace) between two tensors is represented by the repetition of an index label, where one label is contravariant (an ''upper index'' corresponding to a tensor in ''V'') and one label is covariant (a ''lower index'' corresponding to a tensor in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;).  Thus, for instance,

: &lt;math&gt;{t_{ab}}^b&lt;/math&gt;

is the trace of a tensor ''t'' = ''t''&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; over its last two slots.  This manner of representing tensor contractions by repeated indices is formally similar to the [[Einstein summation convention]].  However, as the indices are non-numerical, it does not imply summation: rather it corresponds to the abstract basis-independent trace operation (or duality pairing) between tensor factors of type ''V'' and those of type ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Abstract indices and tensor spaces ==

A general homogeneous tensor is an element of a [[tensor product]] of copies of ''V'' and ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, such as

:&lt;math&gt;V\otimes V^*\otimes V^* \otimes V\otimes V^*.&lt;/math&gt;

Label each factor in this tensor product with a Latin letter in a raised position for each contravariant ''V'' factor, and in a lowered position for each covariant ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; position.  In this way, write the product as

:&lt;math&gt;V^a V_b V_c V^d V_e&lt;/math&gt;

or, simply

:&lt;math&gt;{{{V^a}_{bc}}^d}_e.&lt;/math&gt;

The last two expressions denote the same object as the first.  Tensors of this type are denoted using similar notation, for example:

:&lt;math&gt;{{{h^a}_{bc}}^d}_e \in {{{V^a}_{bc}}^d}_e = V\otimes V^*\otimes V^* \otimes V\otimes V^*.&lt;/math&gt;

==Contraction==
{{See also|Tensor contraction}}
In general, whenever one contravariant and one covariant factor occur in a tensor product of spaces, there is an associated ''contraction'' (or ''trace'') map.  For instance,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tr}_{12} : V\otimes V^*\otimes V^* \otimes V\otimes V^* \to V^* \otimes V\otimes V^*&lt;/math&gt;

is the trace on the first two spaces of the tensor product.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tr}_{15} : V\otimes V^*\otimes V^* \otimes V\otimes V^* \to V^* \otimes V^*\otimes V&lt;/math&gt;

is the trace on the first and last space.

These trace operations are signified on tensors by the repetition of an index.  Thus the first trace map is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tr}_{12} : {{{h^a}_{bc}}^d}_e \mapsto {{{h^a}_{ac}}^d}_e&lt;/math&gt;

and the second by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tr}_{15} : {{{h^a}_{bc}}^d}_e \mapsto {{{h^a}_{bc}}^d}_a.&lt;/math&gt;

==Braiding==
To any tensor product on a single vector space, there are associated [[braided monoidal category|braiding maps]].  For example, the braiding map
:&lt;math&gt; \tau_{(12)} : V\otimes V \rightarrow V\otimes V&lt;/math&gt;
interchanges the two tensor factors (so that its action on simple tensors is given by &lt;math&gt;\tau_{(12)} (v \otimes w) = w \otimes v&lt;/math&gt;).  In general, the braiding maps are in one-to-one correspondence with elements of the [[symmetric group]], acting by permuting the tensor factors.  Here, we use &lt;math&gt;\tau_\sigma&lt;/math&gt; to denote the braiding map associated to the permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; (represented as a product of disjoint [[cyclic permutation]]s).

Braiding maps are important in [[differential geometry]], for instance, in order to express the [[Bianchi identity]].  Here let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; denote the Riemann tensor, regarded as a tensor in &lt;math&gt;V^* \otimes V^* \otimes V^* \otimes V&lt;/math&gt;.  The first Bianchi identity then asserts that
:&lt;math&gt;R+\tau_{(123)}R+\tau_{(132)}R = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Abstract index notation handles braiding as follows.  On a particular tensor product, an ordering of the abstract indices is fixed (usually this is a [[lexicographic order]]ing).  The braid is then represented in notation by permuting the labels of the indices.  Thus, for instance, with the Riemann tensor
:&lt;math&gt;R={R_{abc}}^d\in {V_{abc}}^d = V^*\otimes V^*\otimes V^*\otimes V,&lt;/math&gt;
the Bianchi identity becomes
:&lt;math&gt;{R_{abc}}^d+{R_{cab}}^d+{R_{bca}}^d = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

== Antisymmetrization and Symmetrization ==
A general tensor may be antisymmetrized or symmetrized, and there is according notation.

We demonstrate the notation by example. Let's antisymmetrize the type-(0,3) tensor &lt;math&gt;\omega_{abc}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_3&lt;/math&gt; is the symmetric group on three elements.

&lt;math&gt;\omega_{[abc]} := \frac{1}{3!} \sum_{\sigma \in \Sigma_3} (-1)^{\text{sgn}(\sigma)} \omega_{\sigma(a)\sigma(b)\sigma(c)}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, we may symmetrize:

&lt;math&gt;\omega_{(abc)} := \frac{1}{3!} \sum_{\sigma \in \Sigma_3} \omega_{\sigma(a)\sigma(b)\sigma(c)}&lt;/math&gt;

	'''Alexander Carl Heinrich Braun''' (10 May 1805 – 29 March 1877) was a German [[botanist]] from [[Regensburg]], Bavaria. His research centered on the morphology of plants.

==Biography==
He studied botany in [[Heidelberg]], [[Paris]] and [[Munich]]. In 1833 he began teaching botany at the Polytechnic School of [[Karlsruhe]], staying there until 1846. Afterwards he was a professor of botany in [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]] (from 1846), [[University of Giessen|Giessen]] (from 1850) and at the [[University of Berlin]] (1851), where he remained until 1877. While in Berlin, he was also director of the [[Berlin Botanical Garden|botanical garden]]. In 1852, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

Braun is largely known for his research involving [[plant morphology]]. He accepted evolution but was a critic of [[Darwinism]].&lt;ref&gt;Glick, Thomas F. (1988). ''The Comparative Reception of Darwinism''. University of Chicago Press. p. 86. {{ISBN|0-226-29977-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a proponent of [[vitalism]], a popular 19th century speculative theory that claimed that a regulative force existed within living matter in order to maintain functionality. Despite these beliefs, Braun made important contributions in the field of [[cell theory]].

From his 1830s analysis of the arrangement of scales on a [[pine cone]] he was a pioneer of [[phyllotaxis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/80/3/231.pdf] A History of the Study of Phyllotaxis&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877 [[Wilhelm Philippe Schimper]] and [[Philipp Bruch]] named the plant genus ''[[Braunia]]'' in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&amp;taxon_id=104560 EFloras, Flora of North America] Braunia Bruch &amp; Schimper&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a decorative plant known as "Braun's holly [[fern]]" (''[[Polystichum braunii]]'') commemorates his name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UNe-JB5ftKEC&amp;pg=PA326] Encyclopedia of garden ferns by Suzanne Olsen&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, '''BF algebras''' are a class of algebraic structures arising out of a symmetric "Yin Yang" concept for Bipolar Fuzzy logic, the name was introduced by Andrzej Walendziak in 2007.  The name covers discrete versions, but a canonical example arises in the BF space [-1,0]x[0,1] of pairs of (false-ness, truth-ness).

==Definition==
A '''BF-algebra''' is a non-empty [[subset]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with a [[constant (mathematics)|constant]] &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and a [[binary operation]] &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the following:
# &lt;math&gt;x*x=0&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;x*0=x&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;0*(x*y)=y*x&lt;/math&gt;

== Example ==
Let &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Set_(mathematics)|set]] of [[integer]]s and '&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;' be the binary operation '[[subtraction]]'. Then the [[algebra]]ic structure &lt;math&gt;(Z,-)&lt;/math&gt; obeys the following [[Property (philosophy)|properties]]:
# &lt;math&gt;x-x=0&lt;/math&gt; 
# &lt;math&gt;x-0=x&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;0-(x-y)=y-x&lt;/math&gt;

'''Carnism''' is a concept used in discussions of humanity's relation to other animals, defined as a prevailing [[ideology]] in which people support the use and consumption of [[animal product]]s, especially [[meat]].{{refn|group=n|Gibert, Martin; Desaulniers, Élise (2014):"Carnism refers to the ideology conditioning people to consume certain animal products. It is essentially the opposite of veganism."&lt;ref name="Gibert2014" /&gt;}} Carnism is presented as a dominant belief system supported by a variety of [[defense mechanisms]] and mostly unchallenged assumptions.&lt;ref name="Gibert2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DeMello2012p138&gt;{{cite book | title=Animals and Society: An Introduction to Human-Animal Studies | publisher=New York: Columbia University Press | author=DeMello, Margo | year=2012 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=92Ct9iD1QTYC&amp;pg=PA138 138]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dhont, Kristof; Hodson, Gordon (2014).

[http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/11/carnism/ "Carnism"], Schott's Vocab, ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the ideology, according to the theory, is the acceptance of meat-eating as "natural", "normal", "necessary", and (sometimes) "nice".{{refn|group=n|Joy introduced the "Three Ns of Justification", namely that meat-eating is regarded as "normal, natural, and necessary".&lt;ref name=Joy2011p96&gt;Joy 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;96.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 paper developed this into the "Four Ns": "natural, normal, necessary, and nice".&lt;ref name="Piazza2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal4June2015"&gt;Singal, Jesse (4 June 2015). [http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/06/4-ways-people-rationalize-eating-meat.html "The 4 Ways People Rationalize Eating Meat"], ''New York Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;}} An important feature of carnism is the classification of only particular species of animal as food, and the acceptance of practices toward those animals that would be rejected as unacceptable [[Cruelty to animals|cruelty]] if applied to other species. This classification is culturally relative, so that, for example, dogs are eaten by some people in Korea but may be pets in the West, while cows are eaten in the West but [[Cattle in religion|protected]] in much of India.&lt;ref name="Gibert2014" /&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Ethics of eating meat|History of vegetarianism}}

Analyzing the history of vegetarianism and opposition to it from ancient Greece to the present day, literary scholar Renan Larue found certain commonalities in what he described as carnist arguments. According to him, carnists typically held that vegetarianism is a ludicrous idea unworthy of attention, that mankind is invested with dominion over animals by divine authority, and that abstaining from violence against animals would pose a threat to humans. He found that the views that farmed animals do not suffer, and that slaughter is preferable to death by disease or predation, gained currency in the nineteenth century, but that the former had precedent in the writings of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], a vegetarian who advocated the humane production of animal products which do not require animals to be slaughtered, such as wool.&lt;ref name="Desaulniers30Jan2015"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://penseravantdouvrirlabouche.com/2015/01/30/le-vegetarisme-et-ses-ennemis-entrevue-avec-renan-larue/ | title=Le végétarisme et ses ennemis: entrevue avec Renan Larue | date=30 January 2015 | accessdate=6 August 2015 | author=[[Élise Desaulniers|Desaulniers, Élise]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s traditional views on the moral standing of animals were challenged by [[animal rights]] advocates, including psychologist [[Richard D. Ryder|Richard Ryder]], who in 1971 introduced the notion of [[speciesism]]. This is defined as the assignment of value and rights to individuals solely on the basis of their [[species]] membership.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard D. Ryder|Ryder, Richard D.]] (1971).

"Eating Meat and Eating People", in [[Cass Sunstein]], [[Martha Nussbaum]] (eds.), ''Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions'', Oxford University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;93.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 psychologist and animal rights advocate Melanie Joy coined the term ''carnism'' for a form of speciesism that she argues underpins using animals for food, and particularly killing them for meat.&lt;ref name=Joy2001&gt;[[Melanie Joy|Joy, Melanie]] (2001). [http://www.satyamag.com/sept01/joy.html "From Carnivore to Carnist: Liberating the Language of Meat"], ''Satya'', 18(2), September, pp.&amp;nbsp;126–127; Joy, Melanie (2003). ''Psychic Numbing and Meat Consumption: The Psychology of Carnism'', doctoral dissertion, Saybrook Graduate School, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; Joy compares carnism to [[patriarchy]], arguing that both are dominant normative ideologies that go unrecognized because of their ubiquity:&lt;ref name="Gibert2014"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-007-0929-4_83 | title=Encyclopedia of Food and Agricultural Ethics | chapter = Carnism | chapterurl=https://martingibert.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/gibert-desaulniers-2013-carnism.pdf| publisher=Springer Netherlands | author=Gibert, Martin; [[Élise Desaulniers|Desaulniers, Élise]]| year=2014 | pages=292–298 | isbn=978-94-007-0929-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--ref name="Braunsberger2015"&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10873-5_201 | title=The Sustainable Global Marketplace | publisher=Springer International Publishing |author1=Braunsberger, Karin |author2=Flamm, Richard O. | year=2015 | pages=345 | isbn=978-3-319-10873-5 | chapter=Consumer Identities: Carnism Versus Veganism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Webster1994"&gt;{{cite conference | first = A.

{{quote|We don't see meat eating as we do vegetarianism&amp;nbsp;– as a choice, based on a set of assumptions about animals, our world, and ourselves. Rather, we see it as a given, the "natural" thing to do, the way things have always been and the way things will always be. We eat animals without thinking about what we are doing and why, because the belief system that underlies this behavior is invisible. This invisible belief system is what I call ''carnism''.&lt;ref name="Joy2011p9" /&gt;}}

Sandra Mahlke argues that carnism is the "central crux of speciesism" because the eating of meat motivates ideological justification for other forms of animal exploitation.&lt;ref name="Mahle2014"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F6hPAwAAQBAJ | title=Das Machtverhältnis zwischen Mensch und Tier im Kontext sprachlicher Distanzierungsmechanismen: Anthropozentrismus, Speziesismus und Karnismus in der kritischen Diskursanalyse | publisher=Diplomica Verlag | author=Mahlke, Sandra | year=2014 | isbn=978-3-8428-9140-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central aspect of carnism is that animals are categorized as edible, inedible, pets, [[vermin]], predators, or entertainment animals, according to people's [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]] – mental classifications that determine, and are determined by, our beliefs and desires.&lt;ref name="Gibert2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Joy2011pp14,17" /&gt; There is cultural variability regarding which animals count as food. Dogs are eaten in China, and South Korea, but elsewhere are not viewed as food, either because they are loved or, as in the Middle East and parts of India, regarded as unclean.&lt;ref name="Gibert2014" /&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Podberscek2009" /&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, Hal (2011).

===Meat paradox===
{{main|Psychology of eating meat#Meat paradox}}
Jeff Mannes writes that carnism is rooted in a paradox between most people's values and actions: they oppose harming animals, and yet eat them. He argues that this conflict leads to [[cognitive dissonance]], which people attempt to attenuate through [[psychic numbing]].&lt;ref name="Mannes2015"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.transcript-verlag.de/978-3-8376-2232-4/lexikon-der-mensch-tier-beziehungen | title=Lexikon der Mensch-Tier-Beziehungen | chapter = Karnismus | publisher=Transcript Verlag | author=Mannes, Jeff| year=2015 | pages=191–193 | isbn=978-3-8376-2232-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent conflict between caring about animals and embracing diets which require them to be harmed has been termed the "[[Psychology of eating meat#Meat paradox|meat paradox]]".&lt;ref name=Loughnan2014&gt;Loughnan, Steve; Bastian, Brock; Haslam, Nick (2014).

{{anchor|4 Ns}}&lt;!-- Linked to by [[Psychology of eating meat]]. This should appear directly before the section currently titled "Justification" which discusses the 4 N's"--&gt;

===Justification===
Joy introduced the idea of the "Three Ns of Justification", writing that meat-eaters regard [[meat consumption]] as "normal, natural, and necessary".&lt;ref name="Joy2011p96" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal4June2015" /&gt; She argues that the "Three Ns" have been invoked to justify other ideologies, including slavery and denying women the right to vote, and are widely recognized as problematic only after the ideology they support has been dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;Joy 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument holds that people are conditioned to believe that humans evolved to eat meat, that it is expected of them, and that they need it to survive or be strong. These beliefs are said to be reinforced by various institutions, including religion, family and the media. Although scientists have shown that humans get more than enough protein in their diets without eating meat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-vegetarians-get-enough-protein/ | title = Do vegetarians get enough protein? | first1 = Michael | last1 = Greger | date = 6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the belief that meat is required persists.&lt;ref name="Piazza2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal4June2015" /&gt;

Building on Joy's work, psychologists conducted a series of studies in the United States and Australia, published in 2015, that found the great majority of meat-eaters' stated justifications for consuming meat were based on the "Four Ns"&amp;nbsp;– "natural, normal, necessary, and nice". The arguments were that humans are [[omnivore]]s (''natural''), that most people eat meat (''normal''), that vegetarian diets are lacking in nutrients (''necessary''), and that meat tastes good (''nice'').&lt;ref name="Piazza2015"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Rationalizing meat consumption. The 4Ns | author=Piazza, Jared| journal=Appetite |date=August 2015  | volume=91 | pages=114–128 | doi=10.1016/j.appet.2015.04.011|display-authors=etal | pmid=25865663}}{{paragraph break}}

Meat-eaters who endorsed these arguments more strongly reported less guilt about their dietary habits. They tended to objectify animals, have less moral concern for them and attribute less consciousness to them. They were also more supportive of [[social inequality]] and hierarchical ideologies, and less proud of their consumer choices.&lt;ref name="Piazza2015" /&gt;

==="Saved from slaughter" narratives===
[[File:Obama ThanksGiving Turkey Pardon 2009.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation]], in which the American president pardons a turkey, has been cited as an illustration of carnism.&lt;ref name="Freeman2012p103" /&gt;]]

An illustration of dissonance reduction is the prominence given to "saved from slaughter" stories, in which the media focus on one animal that evaded slaughter, while ignoring the millions that did not.&lt;ref name="Mizelle2015p264" /&gt; Joy wrote that this dichotomy is characteristic of carnism.&lt;ref&gt;Joy 2011, pp. 135,150&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals at the center of these narratives include Wilbur in ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'' (1952); the eponymous and fictional star of ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'' (1995); Christopher Hogwood in [[Sy Montgomery]]'s ''The Good, Good Pig'' (2006);&lt;ref name=Mizelle2015p264&gt;Mizelle, Brett (2015).

==Non-academic reception==
Opinion pieces in ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', ''[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]'', and ''[[The Drum (TV program)|The Drum]]'' praised the idea, saying the term made it easier to discuss, and challenge, the practices of animal exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spencer|first1=Stephan|title=Friend or Food?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13166">'''Categorical quantum mechanics''' is the study of [[quantum foundations]] and [[quantum information]] using paradigms from [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], notably [[Monoidal category|monoidal category theory]]. The primitive objects of study are physical [[Process (science)|processes]], and the different ways that these can be composed. It was pioneered in 2004 by [[Samson Abramsky|Abramsky]] and [[Bob Coecke|Coecke]].

== Mathematical setup ==

Mathematically, the basic setup is captured by a [[dagger symmetric monoidal category]]: composition of [[morphisms]] models sequential composition of processes, and the [[tensor product]] describes parallel composition of processes. The role of the dagger is to assign to each state a corresponding test.  These can then be adorned with more structure to study various aspects. For instance:

* A [[dagger compact category]] allows one to distinguish between an "input" and "output" of a process. In the [[#Diagrammatic calculus|diagrammatic calculus]], it allows wires to be bent, allowing for a less restricted transfer of information.  In particular, it allows entangled states and measurements, and gives elegant descriptions of protocols such as [[quantum teleportation]].&lt;ref name=AC&gt;[[Samson Abramsky]] and [[Bob Coecke]], ''[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402130  A categorical semantics of quantum protocols]'', Proceedings of the 19th IEEE conference on Logic in Computer Science (LiCS'04). IEEE Computer Science Press (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Considering only the morphisms that are [[completely positive map]]s, one can also handle [[Mixed state (physics)|mixed state]]s, allowing the study of [[quantum channel]]s categorically.&lt;ref&gt;P. Selinger, ''[http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/papers.html#dagger  Dagger compact closed categories and completely positive maps]'', Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Quantum Programming Languages, Chicago, June 30–July 1 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wires are always two-ended (and can never be split into a Y), reflecting the [[no-cloning theorem|no-cloning]] and [[no-deleting theorem]]s of quantum mechanics.
* Special commutative dagger [[Frobenius algebra]]s model the fact that certain processes yield classical information, that can be cloned or deleted, thus capturing [[classical information channel|classical communication]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Coecke and D. Pavlovic, ''[http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608035 Quantum measurements without sums]''. In: Mathematics of Quantum Computing and Technology, pages 567–604, Taylor and Francis (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In early works, dagger [[biproduct]]s were used to study both [[classical information channel|classical communication]] and the [[superposition principle]]. Later, these two features have been separated.&lt;ref&gt;B. Coecke and S. Perdrix, ''[http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1004.1598 Environment and classical channels in categorical quantum mechanics]''In: Proceedings of the 19th EACSL Annual Conference on Computer Science Logic (CSL), [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] 6247, Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Complementary [[Frobenius algebra]]s embody the principle of [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]], which is used to great effect in quantum computation.&lt;ref&gt;B. Coecke and R. Duncan, ''[http://www.arxiv.org/abs/0906.4725 Interacting quantum observables]'' In: Proceedings of the 35th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP), pp. 298–310, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 5126, Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

A substantial portion of the mathematical backbone to this approach is drawn from [[Australian category theory]], most notably from work by Kelly and Laplaza,&lt;ref&gt;G.M. Kelly and M.L. Laplaza, Coherence for compact closed categories, Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra 19, 193–213 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; Joyal and Street,&lt;ref&gt;A. Joyal and R. Street, The Geometry of tensor calculus I, Advances in Mathematics 88, 55–112 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Carboni and Walters,&lt;ref&gt;A. Carboni and R. F. C. Walters, Cartesian bicategories I, Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra 49, 11–32 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; and Lack.&lt;ref&gt;S. Lack, Composing PROPs, Theory and Applications of Categories 13, 147–163 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagrammatic calculus ==

One of the most notable features of categorical quantum mechanics is that the compositional structure can be faithfully captured by a purely diagrammatic calculus.&lt;ref name=QPict&gt;B. Coecke, ''[https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1787  Quantum picturalism]'', Contemporary Physics 51, 59–83 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|Teleport.png|780px|An illustration of the diagrammatic calculus: the [[quantum teleportation]] protocol as modeled in categorical quantum mechanics.}}

These diagrammatic languages can be traced back to [[Penrose graphical notation]], developed in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=Penrose&gt;R. Penrose, Applications of negative dimensional tensors, In: Combinatorial Mathematics and its Applications, D.~Welsh (Ed), pages 221–244. Academic Press (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;  Diagrammatic reasoning has been used before in [[quantum information science]] in the [[quantum circuit]] model, however, in categorical quantum mechanics primitive gates like the CNOT-gate arise as composites of more basic algebras, resulting in a much more compact calculus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Backens|first=Miriam|date=2014|title=The ZX-calculus is complete for stabilizer quantum mechanics|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1367-2630/16/i=9/a=093021|journal=New Journal of Physics|language=en|volume=16|issue=9|pages=093021|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/16/9/093021|issn=1367-2630|arxiv=1307.7025|bibcode=2014NJPh...16i3021B}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the [[ZX-calculus]] has sprang forth from categorical quantum mechanics as a diagrammatic counterpart to conventional linear algebraic reasoning about [[quantum gates]]. The ZX-calculus consists of a set of generators representing the common [[Pauli gate|Pauli quantum gates]] and the [[Hadamard gate]] equipped with a set of graphical [[rewrite rule]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s governing their interaction. Although a standard set of rewrite rules has not yet been established some versions have been proven to be ''complete'', meaning that any equation that holds between two quantum circuits represented as diagrams can be proven using the rewrite rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Jeandel|first=Emmanuel|last2=Perdrix|first2=Simon|last3=Vilmart|first3=Renaud|date=2017-05-31|title=A Complete Axiomatisation of the ZX-Calculus for Clifford+T Quantum Mechanics|eprint=1705.11151|class=quant-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ZX-calculus has been used to study for instance [[Measurement Based Quantum Computing]].

== Branches of activity ==
=== Axiomatization and new models ===

One of the main successes of the categorical quantum mechanics research program is that from seemingly weak abstract constraints on the compositional structure, it turned out to be possible to derive many quantum mechanical phenomena. In contrast to earlier axiomatic approaches which aimed to reconstruct [[Hilbert space]] quantum theory from reasonable assumptions, this attitude of not aiming for a complete axiomatization may lead to new interesting models that describe quantum phenomena, which could be of use when crafting future theories.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Baez, ''[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404040 Quantum quandaries: a category-theoretic perspective]''.  In: The Structural Foundations of Quantum Gravity, D. Rickles, S. French and J. T. Saatsi (Eds), pages 240–266. Oxford University Press (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Completeness and representation results ===

There are several theorems relating the abstract setting of categorical quantum mechanics to traditional settings for quantum mechanics.

* Completeness of the diagrammatic calculus: an equality of morphisms can be proved in the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces if and only if it can be proved in the graphical language of dagger compact closed categories.&lt;ref&gt;P. Selinger, ''[http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/papers.html#finhilb Finite dimensional Hilbert spaces are complete for dagger compact closed categories]''. Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science, to appear (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dagger commutative Frobenius algebras in the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces correspond to [[Orthogonal basis|orthogonal bases]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Coecke, D. Pavlovic, and J. Vicary, ''[http://www.arxiv.org/abs/0810.0812 A new description of orthogonal bases]''. Mathematical Structures in Computer Science, to appear (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; A version of this correspondence also holds in arbitrary dimension.&lt;ref&gt;S. Abramsky and C. Heunen ''[http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1011.6123 H*-algebras and nonunital Frobenius algebras: first steps in infinite-dimensional categorical quantum mechanics]'', Clifford Lectures, AMS Proceedings of Symposia in Applied Mathematics, to appear (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Certain extra axioms guarantee that the scalars embed into the field of [[complex number]]s, namely the existence of finite dagger biproducts and dagger equalizers, well-pointedness, and a cardinality restriction on the scalars.&lt;ref&gt;J. Vicary, ''[http://www.arxiv.org/abs/0807.2927 Completeness of dagger-categories and the complex numbers]'', Journal of Mathematical Physics, to appear (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Certain extra axioms on top of the previous guarantee that a dagger symmetric monoidal category embeds into the category of Hilbert spaces, namely if every dagger monic is a dagger kernel. In that case the scalars form an involutive field instead of just embedding in one. If the category is compact, the embedding lands in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.&lt;ref&gt;C. Heunen, ''[http://www.arxiv.org/abs/0811.1448 An embedding theorem for Hilbert categories]''. Theory and Applications of Categories 22, 321–344. (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Special dagger commutative Frobenius algebras in the [[category of relations|category of sets and relations]] correspond to discrete Abelian [[groupoid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;D. Pavlovic, ''[http://www.arxiv.org/abs/0812.2266 Quantum and classical structures in nondeterminstic computation]'', Lecture Notes in Computer Science 5494, page 143–157, Springer (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Finding complementary basis structures in the category of sets and relations corresponds to solving combinatorical problems involving [[Latin square]]s.&lt;ref&gt;J. Evans, R. Duncan, A. Lang and P. Panangaden, ''[http://www.arxiv.org/abs/0909.4453 Classifying all mutually unbiased bases in Rel]'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dagger commutative Frobenius algebras on qubits must be either special or antispecial, relating to the fact that [[Maximally entangled state|maximally entangled]] tripartite states are [[multipartite entanglement|SLOCC]]-equivalent to either the [[GHZ state|GHZ]] or the [[W state]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Coecke and A. Kissinger ''[http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1002.2540 The compositional structure of multipartite quantum entanglement]'', Proceedings of the 37th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP), pages 297–308, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 6199, Springer (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Categorical quantum mechanics as logic ===

Categorical quantum mechanics can also be seen as a [[type theory|type theoretic]] form of [[quantum logic]] that, in contrast to traditional [[quantum logic]], supports formal deductive reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;R. Duncan (2006) ''Types for Quantum Computing'', DPhil. thesis. University of Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; There exists [https://quantomatic.github.io/ software] that supports and automates this reasoning.

There is another connection between categorical quantum mechanics and quantum logic as subobjects in dagger kernel categories and dagger complemented biproduct categories form [[Orthomodular lattice#Orthomodular lattices|orthomodular lattices]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Heunen and B. Jacobs, ''[http://www.arxiv.org/abs/0902.2355 Quantum logic in dagger kernel categories]''. Order 27, 177–212 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Harding, ''A Link between quantum logic and categorical quantum mechanics'', International Journal of Theoretical Physics 48, 769–802 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the former setting allows [[Logical quantifier#Mathematics|logical quantifiers]], the existence of which was never satisfactorily addressed in traditional quantum logic.

=== Categorical quantum mechanics as foundation for quantum mechanics ===

Categorical quantum mechanics allows a  description of more general theories than quantum theory. This enables one to study which features single out quantum theory in contrast to other non-physical theories, hopefully providing some insight in the nature of quantum theory. For example, the framework allows a succinct compositional description of [[Spekkens Toy Model|Spekkens' Toy Theory]] that allows one to pinpoint which structural ingredient causes it to be different from quantum theory.&lt;ref&gt;B. Coecke, B. Edwards and R. W. Spekkens, ''[http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1003.5005 Phase groups and the origin of non-locality for qubits]'', Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science, to appear (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Codework''' is the mixing of [[Alan Sondheim]]'s writing with the code of various [[computer languages]]. The word 'codework' was originally created and given its name by Sondheim,&lt;ref&gt;Sondheim, A. 2001, ABR, Vol 22, Issue 6.&lt;/ref&gt; but also popularized by other Internet artists such as [[Mez Breeze]].&lt;ref&gt;Raley, Rita 2009, Interferences: [Net.Writing] and the Practice of Codework&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes referred to as net.writing. It is said&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/electropoetics/net.writing |title= Code|accessdate=2007-01-25 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to have been inspired by the eclectic poetry of [[e.e.cummings]].

Codework has been used for many forms of writing, mostly [[poetry]] and [[fiction]]. Duc Thuan's  [http://www.ducthuan.com/JavaMoon/moon.htm Days of the Java Moon] is an example of fiction in the codework style. For example:
&lt;!-- should it be &lt;source&gt;--&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
    //Feeling.
   if(ashamed++ == losing self-esteem.S_____ wasn't on diet) [re]solution =
   would stop eating lunch next time;

   //Result.
   after all = S_____ couldn't resist to eat when see[sniff]ing food
   ("ate();", felt defeated &amp; self-disgusted x 1000);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The '''Common Weakness Enumeration''' (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses and vulnerabilities. It is sustained by a community project with the goals of understanding flaws in software and creating automated tools that can be used to identify, fix, and prevent those flaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cwe.mitre.org/about/index.html |title=CWE - About CWE|publisher=at mitre.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project is sponsored by the [[National Cybersecurity FFRDC]], which is owned by [[Mitre Corporation|The MITRE Corporation]], with support from [[US-CERT]] and the [[National Cyber Security Division]] of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/categories National Vulnerabilities Database CWE Slice] at nist.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

Version 3.0 of the CWE standard was released in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cwe.mitre.org/news/index.html#nov162017_CWE_Version_3.0_Now_Available|title=CWE News|publisher=at mitre.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CWE has over 600 categories, including classes for buffer overflows, path/directory tree traversal errors, race conditions, [[cross-site scripting]], hard-coded passwords, and insecure random numbers.&lt;ref name=samate&gt;[https://samate.nist.gov/BF/Enlightenment/CWE.html The Bugs Framework (BF) / Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)] at nist.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
* CWE category 121 is for stack-based buffer overflows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflows]&lt;/ref&gt;

== CWE compatibility ==
Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) Compatibility program allows a service or a product to be reviewed and registered as officially "CWE-Compatible" and "CWE-Effective". The program assists organizations in selecting the right software tools and learning about possible weaknesses and their possible impact.

In order to obtain CWE Compatible status a product or a service must meet 4 out of 6 requirements, shown below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''CWE Searchable'''
| users may search security elements using CWE identifiers
|-
| '''CWE Output'''
| security elements presented to users includes, or allows users to obtain, associated CWE identifiers
|-
| '''Mapping Accuracy'''
| security elements accurately link to the appropriate CWE identifiers
|-
| '''CWE Documentation'''
| capability's documentation describes CWE, CWE compatibility, and how CWE-related functionality in the capability is used
|-
| '''CWE Coverage'''
| for CWE-Compatibility and CWE-Effectiveness, the capability's documentation explicitly lists the CWE-IDs that the capability claims coverage and effectiveness against locating in software
|-
| '''CWE Test Results'''
| for CWE-Effectiveness, test results from the capability showing the results of assessing software for the CWEs are posted on the CWE Web site
|}

There are 48 organizations as of January 2018 that develop and maintain products and services that achieved CWE Compatible status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cwe.mitre.org/compatible/compatible.html |title=CWE - CWE-Compatible Products and Services|publisher=at mitre.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research, critiques, and new developments ==
Some researchers think that ambiguities in CWE can be avoided or reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Black, Irena V. Bojanova, Yaacov Yesha, Yan Wu. 2015. [https://www.nist.gov/publications/towards-147periodic-table148-bugs Towards a “Periodic Table” of Bugs]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diango Hernández''' is a [[Cuba]]n artist.

== Biography ==
Hernandez was born in 1970 in [[Sancti Spíritus, Cuba|Sancti Spíritus]], Cuba. He earned a degree in [[industrial design]] at the [[Havana Superior Institute of Design]] (ISDI). After graduation in 1994 he began a collaboration experience together with [[Ernesto Oroza]], Juan Bernal, [[Francis Acea]] and [[Manuel Piña]] under the name of Ordo Amoris Cabinet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diangohernandez.com/tag/ordo-amoris-cabinet-1994-2003/ |title=Ordo Amoris Cabinet (1994-2003)|website=diangohernandez.com|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[Latin]] words for "order" and "love". From 1996 until 2003 Ordo Amoris Cabinet was only formed by Hernández and Francis Acea. The duo's sculptural installations were exhibited throughout [[Cuba]], [[Europe]], and [[North America]]. Hernández’s works has been included at the 51st [[Venice Biennale|Venice Art Biennale]] (Arsenale, 2005), [[São Paulo Art Biennial]] (2006), [[Biennale of Sydney]] (2006), [[Kunsthalle Basel]] (2006), Munich’s [[Haus der Kunst]] (2010), London’s [[Hayward Gallery]] (2010) and more recently with a survey at the [[Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Trento and Rovereto|MART]] in Rovereto, Italy, (2011). Hernández currently lives and works in [[Düsseldorf]], [[Germany]].

'''Egalitarian communities''' are groups of people who have chosen to live together, with [[egalitarianism]] as one of their core values. A broad definition of egalitarianism is "equal access to resources and to decision-making power." For example, decision-making is done by [[consensus decision-making|consensus]] or another system in which each person has a voice; it is not done hierarchically with only one or a few people making choices that will affect the whole group. If the group shares assets (income, vehicles, etc.), they are distributed equitably throughout the group, and each member has access to more-or-less the same resources as any other member. Egalitarian communities are a type of [[commune]] (some communal groups are not egalitarian in nature).

An "egalitarian decision" is a decision made by a group as opposed to a single individual. The decision may be made by committee or elected members but still is an egalitarian decision.

The [[Federation of Egalitarian Communities]] is a network of communal groups in North America with values including egalitarianism, [[non-violence]], income-sharing and [[cooperation]].

Four such processes are widely recognized: natural selection (in the broad sense, to include sexual selection), genetic drift, mutation, and migration (Fisher 1930; Haldane 1932).

The [[scientific theory]] of evolution by natural selection was proposed by [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in the mid-19th century and was set out in detail in Darwin's book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859).&lt;ref name=Darwin&gt;{{cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |authorlink = Charles Darwin |year=1860 |title=On the Origin of Species |place=London |publisher=John Murray |edition=2nd |pages=490 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F376&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution by natural selection was first demonstrated by the observation that more offspring are often produced than can possibly survive. This is followed by three observable [[fact]]s about living organisms: 1) traits vary among individuals with respect to their morphology, [[physiology]] and behaviour ([[Phenotype#Phenotypic variation|phenotypic variation]]), 2) different traits confer different rates of survival and [[reproduction]] (differential [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]) and 3) traits can be passed from generation to generation ([[heritability]] of fitness).&lt;ref name="Lewontin70"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewontin |first=Richard C. |authorlink=Richard Lewontin |date=November 1970 |title=The Units of Selection |url=http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/167/lewontin%2070%20-%20the%20units%20of%20selection.pdf |journal=[[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics]] |volume=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.01.110170.000245 |jstor=2096764 |issn=1545-2069 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206172942/http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/167/lewontin%2070%20-%20the%20units%20of%20selection.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in successive generations members of a population are more likely to be replaced by the [[offspring|progenies]] of parents with favourable characteristics that have enabled them to survive and reproduce in their respective [[biophysical environment|environments]]. In the early 20th century, other [[Alternatives to evolution by natural selection|competing ideas of evolution]] such as [[mutationism]] and [[orthogenesis]] were [[Superseded scientific theories|refuted]] as the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] reconciled [[Darwinism|Darwinian evolution]] with [[classical genetics]], which established [[Adaptation|adaptive evolution]] as being caused by natural selection acting on [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian]] genetic variation.&lt;ref name="Futuyma2017a"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Futuyma | first1=Douglas J. | last2=Kirkpatrick | first2=Mark | year = 2017 | chapter = Evolutionary Biology | title=Evolution | pages = 3–26 | edition = Fourth | publisher = Sunderland, Massachusetts: Sinauer Associates, Inc | isbn=978-160-5-35605-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classical times ===
The proposal that one type of organism could descend from another type goes back to some of the first [[pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] Greek [[philosopher]]s, such as [[Anaximander#Origin of humankind|Anaximander]] and [[Empedocles#Cosmogony|Empedocles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|Raven|Schofield|1983|pp=100–142, 280–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such proposals survived into Roman times. The [[poet]] and philosopher [[Lucretius]] followed Empedocles in his masterwork ''[[De rerum natura]]'' (''On the Nature of Things'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucretius}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sedley |first=David |authorlink=David Sedley |year=2003 |title=Lucretius and the New Empedocles |url=http://lics.leeds.ac.uk/2003/200304.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Leeds International Classical Studies |volume=2 |issue=4 |issn=1477-3643 |accessdate=2014-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823062637/http://lics.leeds.ac.uk/2003/200304.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval ===
In contrast to these [[Materialism|materialistic]] views, [[Aristotelianism]] considered all natural things as [[potentiality and actuality|actualisations]] of fixed natural possibilities, known as [[Theory of forms|forms]].&lt;ref name="Torrey37"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Torrey |first1=Harry Beal |last2=Felin |first2=Frances |date=March 1937 |title=Was Aristotle an Evolutionist? |journal=[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]] |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1086/394520 |issn=0033-5770 |jstor=2808399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hull67"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hull |first=David L. |authorlink=David Hull |date=December 1967 |title=The Metaphysics of Evolution |journal=[[The British Journal for the History of Science]] |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=309–337 |doi=10.1017/S0007087400002892 |jstor=4024958}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of a medieval [[teleology|teleological]] understanding of [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] in which all things have an intended role to play in a [[divinity|divine]] [[cosmos|cosmic]] order. Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the [[Middle Ages]] and were integrated into [[Christianity|Christian]] learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real types of organisms always correspond one-for-one with exact metaphysical forms and specifically gave examples of how new types of living things could come to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mason|1962|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-Darwinian ===
In the 17th century, the new [[scientific method|method]] of [[History of science#Modern science|modern science]] rejected the Aristotelian approach. It sought explanations of natural phenomena in terms of [[physical law]]s that were the same for all visible things and that did not require the existence of any fixed natural categories or divine cosmic order. However, this new approach was slow to take root in the biological sciences, the last bastion of the concept of fixed natural types. [[John Ray]] applied one of the previously more general terms for fixed natural types, "species," to plant and animal types, but he strictly identified each type of living thing as a species and proposed that each species could be defined by the features that perpetuated themselves generation after generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1982|pp=256–257}}
* {{harvnb|Ray|1686}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological classification introduced by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1735 explicitly recognised the hierarchical nature of species relationships, but still viewed species as fixed according to a divine plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/linnaeus.html |title=Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) |last=Waggoner |first=Ben |date=July 7, 2000 |website=Evolution |publisher=[[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] |location=Berkeley, California |type=Online exhibit |accessdate=2012-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430160025/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/linnaeus.html |archivedate=2011-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other [[Natural history|naturalists]] of this time speculated on the evolutionary change of species over time according to natural laws. In 1751, [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over many generations to produce new species.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=73–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] suggested that species could degenerate into different organisms, and [[Erasmus Darwin]] proposed that all warm-blooded animals could have descended from a single microorganism (or "filament").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/Edarwin.html |title=Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802) |date=October 4, 1995 |website=Evolution |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |location=Berkeley, California |type=Online exhibit |accessdate=2012-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119004316/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/Edarwin.html |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first full-fledged evolutionary scheme was [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s "transmutation" theory of 1809,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lamarck|1809}}&lt;/ref&gt; which envisaged [[spontaneous generation]] continually producing simple forms of life that developed greater complexity in parallel lineages with an inherent progressive tendency, and postulated that on a local level, these lineages adapted to the environment by inheriting changes caused by their use or disuse in parents.&lt;ref name="Nardon_Grenier91"&gt;{{harvnb|Nardon|Grenier|1991|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould02"&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|2002}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The latter process was later called [[Lamarckism]].)&lt;ref name="Nardon_Grenier91" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ImaginaryLamarck"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ghiselin |first=Michael T. |authorlink=Michael Ghiselin |date=September–October 1994 |title=The Imaginary Lamarck: A Look at Bogus 'History' in Schoolbooks |url=http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm |journal=The Textbook Letter |oclc=23228649 |accessdate=2008-01-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212174536/http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm |archivedate=2008-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Magner|2002}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jablonka07"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jablonka |first1=Eva |authorlink1=Eva Jablonka |last2=Lamb |first2=Marion J. |authorlink2=Marion J.

In particular, [[Georges Cuvier]] insisted that species were unrelated and fixed, their similarities reflecting divine design for functional needs. In the meantime, Ray's ideas of benevolent design had been developed by [[William Paley]] into the ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]'' (1802), which proposed complex adaptations as evidence of divine design and which was admired by Charles Darwin.&lt;ref name="Darwin91"&gt;{{harvnb|Burkhardt|Smith|1991}}

=== Darwinian revolution ===
The crucial break from the concept of constant typological classes or types in biology came with the theory of evolution through natural selection, which was formulated by Charles Darwin in terms of variable populations. Partly influenced by ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' (1798) by [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], Darwin noted that population growth would lead to a "struggle for existence" in which favourable variations prevailed as others perished. In each generation, many offspring fail to survive to an age of reproduction because of limited resources. This could explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common ancestry through the working of natural laws in the same way for all types of organism.&lt;ref name="Sober09"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sober |first=Elliott |authorlink=Elliott Sober |date=June 16, 2009 |title=Did Darwin write the ''Origin'' backwards? |journal=Proc.

[[Thomas Henry Huxley]] applied Darwin's ideas to humans, using [[paleontology]] and [[comparative anatomy]] to provide strong evidence that humans and [[ape]]s shared a common ancestry. Some were disturbed by this since it implied that humans did not have a special place in the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Desmond |first=Adrian J. |authorlink=Adrian Desmond |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/277746/Thomas-Henry-Huxley |title=Thomas Henry Huxley |accessdate=2014-12-02 |date=July 17, 2014 |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] |location=Chicago, Illinois |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119231241/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/277746/Thomas-Henry-Huxley |archivedate=January 19, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pangenesis and heredity ===
The mechanisms of reproductive heritability and the origin of new traits remained a mystery. Towards this end, Darwin developed his provisional theory of [[pangenesis]].&lt;ref name="Liu09"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Y. S. |last2=Zhou |first2=X. M. |last3=Zhi |first3=M.

[[Hugo de Vries]] connected Darwin's pangenesis theory to Weismann's germ/soma cell distinction and proposed that Darwin's pangenes were concentrated in the [[cell nucleus]] and when expressed they could move into the [[cytoplasm]] to change the [[Cell (biology)|cell]]'s structure. De Vries was also one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well known, believing that Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline.&lt;ref name="Wright84"&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1984|p=480}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain how new variants originate, de Vries developed [[Mutationism|a mutation theory]] that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de Vries.&lt;ref name="Gould02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Provine|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stamhuis |first1=Ida H. |last2=Meijer |first2=Onno G. |last3=Zevenhuizen |first3=Erik J.

=== The 'modern synthesis' ===
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}
In the 1920s and 1930s the so-called [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] connected natural selection and population genetics, based on Mendelian inheritance, into a unified theory that applied generally to any branch of biology. The modern synthesis explained patterns observed across species in populations, through [[Transitional fossil|fossil transitions]] in palaeontology, and complex cellular mechanisms in [[developmental biology]].&lt;ref name="Gould02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|1989}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of the structure of [[DNA]] by [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] with contribution of [[Rosalind Franklin]] in 1953 demonstrated a physical mechanism for inheritance.&lt;ref name="Watson53"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Watson |first1=J.

=== Further syntheses ===
Since then, the modern synthesis has been further extended to explain biological phenomena across the full and integrative scale of the [[Biological organisation|biological hierarchy]], from genes to species.

Evolution in organisms occurs through changes in heritable traits—the inherited characteristics of an organism. In humans, for example, [[Eye color|eye colour]] is an inherited characteristic and an individual might inherit the "brown-eye trait" from one of their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sturm |first1=Richard A. |last2=Frudakis |first2=Tony N. |date=August 2004 |title=Eye colour: portals into pigmentation genes and ancestry |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Genetics]] |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=327–332 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2004.06.010 |issn=0168-9525 |pmid=15262401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inherited traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism's [[genome]] (genetic material) is called its genotype.&lt;ref name="Pearson_2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pearson |first=Helen |date=May 25, 2006 |title=Genetics: What is a gene? |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7092 |pages=398–401 |bibcode=2006Natur.441..398P |doi=10.1038/441398a |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=16724031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete set of observable traits that make up the structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype. These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Visscher |first1=Peter M. |last2=Hill |first2=William G. |authorlink2=William G. Hill |last3=Wray |first3=Naomi R. |date=April 2008 |title=Heritability in the genomics era — concepts and misconceptions |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=255–266 |doi=10.1038/nrg2322 |issn=1471-0056 |pmid=18319743}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, [[sun tanning|suntanned]] skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in genotypic variation; a striking example are people with the inherited trait of [[albinism]], who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to [[sunburn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oetting |first1=William S. |last2=Brilliant |first2=Murray H. |last3=King |first3=Richard A. |date=August 1996 |title=The clinical spectrum of albinism in humans |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Molecular Medicine Today]] |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=330–335 |doi=10.1016/1357-4310(96)81798-9 |issn=1357-4310 |pmid=8796918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritable traits are passed from one generation to the next via DNA, a [[molecule]] that encodes genetic information.&lt;ref name="Pearson_2006" /&gt; DNA is a long [[biopolymer]] composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called [[chromosome]]s. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a [[locus (genetics)|locus]]. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism.&lt;ref name="Futuyma_2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|2005}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by [[quantitative trait locus|quantitative trait loci]] (multiple interacting genes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Phillips |first=Patrick C. |date=November 2008 |title=Epistasis—the essential role of gene interactions in the structure and evolution of genetic systems |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=855–867 |doi=10.1038/nrg2452 |issn=1471-0056 |pmc=2689140 |pmid=18852697}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lin"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rongling Wu |author2=Min Lin |date=March 2006 |title=Functional mapping — how to map and study the genetic architecture of dynamic complex traits |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=229–237 |doi=10.1038/nrg1804 |issn=1471-0056 |pmid=16485021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent findings have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot be explained by changes to the sequence of [[nucleotide]]s in the DNA. These phenomena are classed as [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] inheritance systems.&lt;ref name="Jablonka09"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jablonka |first1=Eva |last2=Raz |first2=Gal |date=June 2009 |title=Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance: Prevalence, Mechanisms, and Implications for the Study of Heredity and Evolution |journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=131–176 |doi=10.1086/598822 |issn=0033-5770 |pmid=19606595|url=http://compgen.unc.edu/wiki/images/d/df/JablonkaQtrRevBio2009.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.617.6333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DNA methylation]] marking [[chromatin]], self-sustaining metabolic loops, gene silencing by [[RNA interference]] and the three-dimensional [[Protein structure|conformation]] of [[protein]]s (such as [[prion]]s) are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level.&lt;ref name="Bossdorf10"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bossdorf |first1=Oliver |last2=Arcuri |first2=Davide |last3=Richards |first3=Christina L. |last4=Pigliucci |first4=Massimo |authorlink4=Massimo Pigliucci |date=May 2010 |title=Experimental alteration of DNA methylation affects the phenotypic plasticity of ecologically relevant traits in ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' |journal=Evolutionary Ecology |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=541–553 |doi=10.1007/s10682-010-9372-7 |issn=0269-7653|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/318722/files/10682_2010_Article_9372.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jablonka|Lamb|2005}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developmental biologists suggest that complex interactions in [[gene regulatory network|genetic networks]] and communication among cells can lead to heritable variations that may underlay some of the mechanics in [[developmental plasticity]] and [[Canalisation (genetics)|canalisation]].&lt;ref name="Jablonka02"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jablonka |first1=Eva |last2=Lamb |first2=Marion J. |date=December 2002 |title=The Changing Concept of Epigenetics |journal=[[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]] |volume=981 |issue=1 |pages=82–96 |bibcode=2002NYASA.981...82J |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2002.tb04913.x |issn=0077-8923 |pmid=12547675}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heritability may also occur at even larger scales. For example, ecological inheritance through the process of [[niche construction]] is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in their environment. This generates a legacy of effects that modify and feed back into the selection regime of subsequent generations. Descendants inherit genes plus environmental characteristics generated by the ecological actions of ancestors.&lt;ref name="Laland06"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laland |first1=Kevin N. |last2=Sterelny |first2=Kim |authorlink2=Kim Sterelny |date=September 2006 |title=Perspective: Seven Reasons (Not) to Neglect Niche Construction |journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]] |volume=60 |issue=9 |pages=1751–1762 |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2006.tb00520.x |issn=0014-3820}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of heritability in evolution that are not under the direct control of genes include the inheritance of [[Dual inheritance theory|cultural traits]] and [[symbiogenesis]].&lt;ref name="Chapman98"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chapman |first1=Michael J. |last2=Margulis |first2=Lynn |authorlink2=Lynn Margulis |date=December 1998 |title=Morphogenesis by symbiogenesis |url=http://www.im.microbios.org/04december98/14%20Chapman.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[International Microbiology]] |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=319–326 |issn=1139-6709 |pmid=10943381 |accessdate=2014-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823062546/http://www.im.microbios.org/04december98/14%20Chapman.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson07"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=David Sloan |authorlink1=David Sloan Wilson |last2=Wilson |first2=Edward O. |authorlink2=E.

{{main|Genetic variation}}
{{Further|Genetic diversity|Population genetics}}
An individual organism's phenotype results from both its genotype and the influence from the environment it has lived in. A substantial part of the phenotypic variation in a population is caused by genotypic variation.&lt;ref name="Lin" /&gt; The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative to other forms of that gene. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of [[fixation (population genetics)|fixation]]—when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.&lt;ref name="Amos"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Amos |first1=William |last2=Harwood |first2=John |date=February 28, 1998 |title=Factors affecting levels of genetic diversity in natural populations |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]] |volume=353 |issue=1366 |pages=177–186 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1998.0200 |issn=0962-8436 |pmc=1692205 |pmid=9533122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural selection will only cause evolution if there is enough [[genetic variation]] in a population. Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, one common hypothesis was [[blending inheritance]]. But with blending inheritance, genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural selection implausible. The [[Hardy–Weinberg principle]] provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance. The frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant in the absence of selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.&lt;ref name="Ewens W.J. 2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Ewens|2004}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variation comes from mutations in the genome, reshuffling of genes through [[sexual reproduction]] and migration between populations ([[gene flow]]). Despite the constant introduction of new variation through mutation and gene flow, most of the genome of a species is identical in all individuals of that species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Butlin |first1=Roger K. |last2=Tregenza |first2=Tom |date=February 28, 1998 |title=Levels of genetic polymorphism: marker loci versus quantitative traits |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=353 |issue=1366 |pages=187–198 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1998.0201 |issn=0962-8436 |pmc=1692210 |pmid=9533123}}

=== Mutation ===
{{Main|Mutation}}
[[File:Gene-duplication.svg|thumb|upright=0.45|Duplication of part of a [[chromosome]]]]
Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome. When mutations occur, they may alter the [[gene product|product of a gene]], or prevent the gene from functioning, or have no effect. Based on studies in the fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', it has been suggested that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, this will probably be harmful, with about 70% of these mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sawyer |first1=Stanley A. |last2=Parsch |first2=John |author3=Zhang Zhi |last4=Hartl |first4=Daniel L. |date=April 17, 2007 |title=Prevalence of positive selection among nearly neutral amino acid replacements in ''Drosophila'' |journal=Proc.

Mutations can involve large sections of a chromosome becoming [[gene duplication|duplicated]] (usually by [[genetic recombination]]), which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hastings |first1=P.

New genes can be generated from an ancestral gene when a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function. This process is easier once a gene has been duplicated because it increases the [[Gene redundancy|redundancy]] of the system; one gene in the pair can acquire a new function while the other copy continues to perform its original function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gregory |first1=T.

=== Sex and recombination ===
{{Further|Sexual reproduction|Genetic recombination|Evolution of sexual reproduction}}
In [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]] organisms, genes are inherited together, or ''linked'', as they cannot mix with genes of other organisms during reproduction. In contrast, the offspring of [[sex]]ual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents' chromosomes that are produced through independent assortment.

The two-fold cost of sex was first described by [[John Maynard Smith]].&lt;ref name="maynard"&gt;{{harvnb|Maynard Smith|1978}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first cost is that in sexually dimorphic species only one of the two sexes can bear young. (This cost does not apply to hermaphroditic species, like most plants and many [[invertebrate]]s.) The second cost is that any individual who reproduces sexually can only pass on 50% of its genes to any individual offspring, with even less passed on as each new generation passes.&lt;ref name="ridley"&gt;{{harvnb|Ridley|1993}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet sexual reproduction is the more common means of reproduction among eukaryotes and multicellular organisms.

Gene transfer between species includes the formation of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] organisms and [[horizontal gene transfer]].

== Mechanisms ==
[[File:Mutation and selection diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Mutation]] followed by natural selection results in a population with darker colouration.]]
From a [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] perspective, evolution occurs when there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms,&lt;ref name="Ewens W.J. 2004" /&gt; for example, the allele for black colour in a population of moths becoming more common. Mechanisms that can lead to changes in allele frequencies include natural selection, genetic drift, genetic hitchhiking, mutation and gene flow.

=== Natural selection ===
{{Main|Natural selection}}
{{Further|Sexual selection}}
Evolution by means of natural selection is the process by which traits that enhance survival and reproduction become more common in successive generations of a population. It has often been called a "self-evident" mechanism because it necessarily follows from three simple facts:&lt;ref name="Lewontin70" /&gt;
* Variation exists within populations of organisms with respect to morphology, physiology, and behaviour (phenotypic variation).
* Different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction (differential fitness).
* These traits can be passed from generation to generation (heritability of fitness).

More offspring are produced than can possibly survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction. Consequently, organisms with traits that give them an advantage over their competitors are more likely to pass on their traits to the next generation than those with traits that do not confer an advantage.&lt;ref name="Hurst"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hurst |first=Laurence D. |authorlink=Laurence Hurst |title=Fundamental concepts in genetics: genetics and the understanding of selection |date=February 2009 |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=83–93 |doi=10.1038/nrg2506 |issn=1471-0056 |pmid=19119264}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[teleonomy]] is the quality whereby the process of natural selection creates and preserves traits that are [[teleology in biology|seemingly fitted]] for the [[function (biology)|functional]] roles they perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=477 Chapter XIV]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequences of selection include [[Assortative mating|nonrandom mating]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Otto |first1=Sarah P. |author-link1=Sarah Otto |last2=Servedio |first2=Maria R. |last3=Nuismer |first3=Scott L. |title=Frequency-Dependent Selection and the Evolution of Assortative Mating |journal=Genetics |date=August 2008 |volume=179 |issue=4 |pages=2091–2112 |issn=0016-6731 |doi=10.1534/genetics.107.084418 |pmc=2516082 |pmid=18660541|bibcode=2001gpm..book.....L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[genetic hitchhiking]].

The central concept of natural selection is the [[fitness (biology)|evolutionary fitness]] of an organism.&lt;ref name="Orr"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orr |first=H. Allen |authorlink=H.

If an allele increases fitness more than the other alleles of that gene, then with each generation this allele will become more common within the population. These traits are said to be "selected ''for''." Examples of traits that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased [[fecundity]]. Conversely, the lower fitness caused by having a less beneficial or deleterious allele results in this allele becoming rarer—they are "selected ''against''."&lt;ref name="Lande"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lande |first1=Russell |authorlink1=Russell Lande |last2=Arnold |first2=Stevan J. |date=November 1983 |title=The Measurement of Selection on Correlated Characters |journal=Evolution |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=1210–1226 |doi=10.2307/2408842 |pmid=28556011 |issn=0014-3820 |jstor=2408842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, the fitness of an allele is not a fixed characteristic; if the environment changes, previously neutral or harmful traits may become beneficial and previously beneficial traits become harmful.&lt;ref name="Futuyma_2005" /&gt; However, even if the direction of selection does reverse in this way, traits that were lost in the past may not re-evolve in an identical form (see [[Dollo's law of irreversibility|Dollo's law]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldberg |first1=Emma E. |last2=Igić |first2=Boris |date=November 2008 |title=On phylogenetic tests of irreversible evolution |journal=Evolution |volume=62 |issue=11 |pages=2727–2741 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00505.x |issn=0014-3820 |pmid=18764918}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collin |first1=Rachel |last2=Miglietta |first2=Maria Pia |date=November 2008 |title=Reversing opinions on Dollo's Law |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]] |volume=23 |issue=11 |pages=602–609 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2008.06.013 |issn=0169-5347 |pmid=18814933}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a re-activation of dormant genes, as long as they have not been eliminated from the genome and were only suppressed perhaps for hundreds of generations, can lead to the re-occurrence of traits thought to be lost like hindlegs in [[dolphin]]s, teeth in [[chicken]]s, wings in wingless stick [[insect]]s, tails and additional nipples in humans etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tomić |first1=Nenad |last2=Meyer-Rochow |first2=Victor Benno |year=2011 |title=Atavisms: Medical, Genetic, and Evolutionary Implications |journal=[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]] |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=332–353 |doi=10.1353/pbm.2011.0034 |issn=0031-5982 |pmid=21857125}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Throwbacks" such as these are known as [[atavism]]s.

Natural selection within a population for a trait that can vary across a range of values, such as height, can be categorised into three different types. The first is [[directional selection]], which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time—for example, organisms slowly getting taller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoekstra |first1=Hopi E. |last2=Hoekstra |first2=Jonathan M. |last3=Berrigan |first3=David |last4=Vignieri |first4=Sacha N. |last5=Hoang |first5=Amy |last6=Hill |first6=Caryl E. |last7=Beerli |first7=Peter |last8=Kingsolver |first8=Joel G. |date=July 31, 2001 |title=Strength and tempo of directional selection in the wild |journal=Proc.

This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in [[stabilising selection]] there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in [[variance]] around the average value and less diversity.&lt;ref name="Hurst" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Felsenstein |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Felsenstein |date=November 1979 |title=Excursions along the Interface between Disruptive and Stabilizing Selection |journal=Genetics |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=773–795 |issn=0016-6731 |pmc=1214112 |pmid=17248980}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would, for example, cause organisms to eventually have a similar height.

A special case of natural selection is sexual selection, which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andersson |first1=Malte |last2=Simmons |first2=Leigh W. |date=June 2006 |title=Sexual selection and mate choice |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=296–302 |pmid=16769428 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2006.03.015 |issn=0169-5347 |url=http://academic.reed.edu/biology/professors/srenn/pages/teaching/2008_syllabus/2008_readings/2_anderson-simmons_2006.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309112854/http://academic.reed.edu/biology/professors/srenn/pages/teaching/2008_syllabus/2008_readings/2_Anderson-Simmons_2006.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-09 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.595.4050 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent among males of several animal species.

Natural selection most generally makes nature the measure against which individuals and individual traits, are more or less likely to survive. "Nature" in this sense refers to an [[ecosystem]], that is, a system in which organisms interact with every other element, [[Abiotic component|physical]] as well as [[Biotic component|biological]], in their local environment. [[Eugene Odum]], a founder of [[ecology]], defined an ecosystem as: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms...in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e., exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system...."&lt;ref name="Odum1971"&gt;{{harvnb|Odum|1971|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each population within an ecosystem occupies a distinct [[Ecological niche|niche]], or position, with distinct relationships to other parts of the system. These relationships involve the life history of the organism, its position in the [[food chain]] and its geographic range. This broad understanding of nature enables scientists to delineate specific forces which, together, comprise natural selection.

=== Genetic hitchhiking ===
{{Further|Genetic hitchhiking|Hill–Robertson effect|Selective sweep}}
Recombination allows alleles on the same strand of DNA to become separated. However, the rate of recombination is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close together on a chromosome may not always be shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as [[genetic linkage|linkage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lien |first1=Sigbjørn |last2=Szyda |first2=Joanna |last3=Schechinger |first3=Birgit |last4=Rappold |first4=Gudrun |last5=Arnheim |first5=Norm |date=February 2000 |title=Evidence for Heterogeneity in Recombination in the Human Pseudoautosomal Region: High Resolution Analysis by Sperm Typing and Radiation-Hybrid Mapping |journal=[[American Journal of Human Genetics]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=557–566 |doi=10.1086/302754 |issn=0002-9297 |pmc=1288109 |pmid=10677316 |display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to [[independence (probability theory)|expectations]], which is called their [[linkage disequilibrium]]. A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a [[haplotype]]. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a [[selective sweep]] that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barton |first=Nicholas H. |authorlink=Nick Barton |date=November 29, 2000 |title=Genetic hitchhiking |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=355 |issue=1403 |pages=1553–1562 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0716 |issn=0962-8436 |pmc=1692896 |pmid=11127900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.&lt;ref name="gillespie 2001" /&gt;

=== Gene flow ===
{{Further|Gene flow|Hybrid (biology)|Horizontal gene transfer}}
Gene flow involves the exchange of genes between populations and between species.&lt;ref name="Morjan C, Rieseberg L 2004 1341–56" /&gt; The presence or absence of gene flow fundamentally changes the course of evolution. Due to the complexity of organisms, any two completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral processes, as in the [[Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller Model|Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model]], even if both populations remain essentially identical in terms of their adaptation to the environment.

If genetic differentiation between populations develops, gene flow between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous in the local population and this may lead to organisms within these populations evolving mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations, eventually resulting in the appearance of new species. Thus, exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important for the development of the [[Species problem#Mayr's Biological Species Concept|''Biological Species Concept'']] (BSC).

Evolution influences every aspect of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding [[Predation|predators]] or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by [[Co-operation (evolution)|cooperating]] with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial [[symbiosis]]. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.

These outcomes of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as [[macroevolution]] versus microevolution. Macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs at or above the level of species, in particular speciation and extinction; whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population, in particular shifts in [[allele frequency]] and adaptation.&lt;ref name="ScottEC"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=Eugenie C. |authorlink1=Eugenie Scott |last2=Matzke |first2=Nicholas J. |authorlink2=Nick Matzke |date=May 15, 2007 |title=Biological design in science classrooms |journal=Proc.

For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new [[habitat]]s, lessening the chance of it going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels—with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as [[Unit of selection#Species selection and selection at higher taxonomic levels|species selection]] acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.{{sfn|Gould|2002|pp=657–658}}&lt;ref name="Gould_1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |date=July 19, 1994 |title=Tempo and mode in the macroevolutionary reconstruction of Darwinism |journal=Proc.

Adaptation is the process that makes organisms better suited to their habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1982|p=483}}: "Adaptation... could no longer be considered a static condition, a product of a creative past and became instead a continuing dynamic process."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The sixth edition of the ''Oxford Dictionary of Science'' (2010) defines ''adaptation'' as "Any change in the structure or functioning of successive generations of a population that makes it better suited to its environment."&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the term adaptation may refer to a trait that is important for an organism's survival. For example, the adaptation of [[horse]]s' teeth to the grinding of grass. By using the term ''adaptation'' for the evolutionary process and ''adaptive trait'' for the product (the bodily part or function), the two senses of the word may be distinguished. Adaptations are produced by natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orr |first=H.

# ''Adaptation'' is the evolutionary process whereby an organism becomes better able to live in its habitat or habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dobzhansky|1968|pp=1–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Adaptedness'' is the state of being adapted: the degree to which an organism is able to live and reproduce in a given set of habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dobzhansky|1970|pp=4–6, 79–82, 84–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# An ''adaptive trait'' is an aspect of the developmental pattern of the organism which enables or enhances the probability of that organism surviving and reproducing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dobzhansky |first=Theodosius |date=March 1956 |title=Genetics of Natural Populations.

Adaptation may cause either the gain of a new feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature. An example that shows both types of change is bacterial adaptation to antibiotic selection, with genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance by both modifying the target of the drug, or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nakajima |first1=Akira |last2=Sugimoto |first2=Yohko |last3=Yoneyama |first3=Hiroshi |last4=Nakae |first4=Taiji |date=June 2002 |title=High-Level Fluoroquinolone Resistance in ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' Due to Interplay of the MexAB-OprM Efflux Pump and the DNA Gyrase Mutation |journal=Microbiology and Immunology |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=391–395 |doi=10.1111/j.1348-0421.2002.tb02711.x |issn=1348-0421 |pmid=12153116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other striking examples are the bacteria ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' evolving the ability to use [[citric acid]] as a nutrient in a [[E. coli long-term evolution experiment|long-term laboratory experiment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blount |first1=Zachary D. |last2=Borland |first2=Christina Z. |last3=Lenski |first3=Richard E. |date=June 10, 2008 |title=Inaugural Article: Historical contingency and the evolution of a key innovation in an experimental population of ''Escherichia coli'' |journal=Proc.

Adaptation occurs through the gradual modification of existing structures. Consequently, structures with similar internal organisation may have different functions in related organisms. This is the result of a single ancestral structure being adapted to function in different ways.

{{Further|Coevolution}}
Interactions between organisms can produce both conflict and cooperation. When the interaction is between pairs of species, such as a [[pathogen]] and a [[host (biology)|host]], or a predator and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species. This cycle of selection and response is called coevolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wade |first=Michael J. |authorlink=Michael J.

For instance, an extreme cooperation exists between plants and the [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrhizal fungi]] that grow on their roots and aid the plant in absorbing nutrients from the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Paszkowski |first=Uta |date=August 2006 |title=Mutualism and parasitism: the yin and yang of plant symbioses |journal=[[Current Opinion (Elsevier)|Current Opinion in Plant Biology]] |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=364–370 |doi=10.1016/j.pbi.2006.05.008 |issn=1369-5266 |pmid=16713732}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocal]] relationship as the plants provide the fungi with sugars from [[photosynthesis]]. Here, the fungi actually grow inside plant cells, allowing them to exchange nutrients with their hosts, while sending [[signal transduction|signals]] that suppress the plant [[immune system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hause |first1=Bettina |last2=Fester |first2=Thomas |date=May 2005 |title=Molecular and cell biology of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis |journal=[[Planta (journal)|Planta]] |volume=221 |issue=2 |pages=184–196 |doi=10.1007/s00425-004-1436-x |issn=0032-0935 |pmid=15871030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coalitions between organisms of the same species have also evolved. An extreme case is the [[eusociality]] found in social insects, such as [[bee]]s, [[termite]]s and [[ant]]s, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a [[Colony (biology)|colony]] that are able to reproduce. On an even smaller scale, the somatic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's germ cells to produce offspring. Here, somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or die. If cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately, their uncontrolled growth [[carcinogenesis|causes cancer]].&lt;ref name="Bertram"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bertram |first=John S. |date=December 2000 |title=The molecular biology of cancer |journal=[[Molecular Aspects of Medicine]] |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=167–223 |doi=10.1016/S0098-2997(00)00007-8 |issn=0098-2997 |pmid=11173079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Speciation modes edit.svg|left|thumb|upright=1.6|The four geographic modes of [[speciation]]]]

Speciation is the process where a species diverges into two or more descendant species.&lt;ref name="Gavrilets"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gavrilets |first=Sergey |date=October 2003 |title=Perspective: models of speciation: what have we learned in 40 years? |journal=Evolution |volume=57 |issue=10 |pages=2197–2215 |doi=10.1554/02-727 |issn=0014-3820 |pmid=14628909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple ways to define the concept of "species." The choice of definition is dependent on the particularities of the species concerned.&lt;ref name="Queiroz"&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Queiroz |first=Kevin |date=May 3, 2005 |title=Ernst Mayr and the modern concept of species |journal=Proc.

Despite the diversity of various species concepts, these various concepts can be placed into one of three broad philosophical approaches: interbreeding, ecological and phylogenetic.&lt;ref name="Ereshefsky92"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ereshefsky |first=Marc |authorlink=Marc Ereshefsky |date=December 1992 |title=Eliminative pluralism |journal=[[Philosophy of Science (journal)|Philosophy of Science]] |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=671–690 |doi=10.1086/289701 |issn=0031-8248 |jstor=188136}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Biological Species Concept'' (BSC) is a classic example of the interbreeding approach. Defined by evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] in 1942, the BSC states that "species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1942|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its wide and long-term use, the BSC like others is not without controversy, for example because these concepts cannot be applied to prokaryotes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fraser |first1=Christophe |last2=Alm |first2=Eric J. |last3=Polz |first3=Martin F. |last4=Spratt |first4=Brian G. |last5=Hanage |first5=William P. |date=February 6, 2009 |title=The Bacterial Species Challenge: Making Sense of Genetic and Ecological Diversity |journal=Science |volume=323 |issue=5915 |pages=741–746 |bibcode=2009Sci...323..741F |doi=10.1126/science.1159388 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=19197054 |display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this is called the [[species problem]].&lt;ref name="Queiroz" /&gt; Some researchers have attempted a unifying monistic definition of species, while others adopt a pluralistic approach and suggest that there may be different ways to logically interpret the definition of a species.&lt;ref name="Queiroz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ereshefsky92" /&gt;

[[Reproductive isolation|Barriers to reproduction]] between two diverging sexual populations are required for the populations to become new species. Gene flow may slow this process by spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations.

There are four primary geographic modes of speciation. The most common in animals is [[allopatric speciation]], which occurs in populations initially isolated geographically, such as by [[habitat fragmentation]] or migration. Selection under these conditions can produce very rapid changes in the appearance and behaviour of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herrel |first1=Anthony |last2=Huyghe |first2=Katleen |last3=Vanhooydonck |first3=Bieke |last4=Backeljau |first4=Thierry |last5=Breugelmans |first5=Karin |last6=Grbac |first6=Irena |last7=Van Damme |first7=Raoul |last8=Irschick |first8=Duncan J. |date=March 25, 2008 |title=Rapid large-scale evolutionary divergence in morphology and performance associated with exploitation of a different dietary resource |journal=Proc.

The second mode of speciation is [[peripatric speciation]], which occurs when small populations of organisms become isolated in a new environment. This differs from allopatric speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically much smaller than the parental population. Here, the [[founder effect]] causes rapid speciation after an increase in [[inbreeding]] increases selection on homozygotes, leading to rapid genetic change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Templeton |first=Alan R. |authorlink=Alan Templeton |date=April 1980 |title=The Theory of Speciation ''VIA'' the Founder Principle |url=http://www.genetics.org/content/94/4/1011.full.pdf+html |journal=Genetics |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=1011–1038 |pmid=6777243 |issn=0016-6731 |pmc=1214177 |accessdate=2014-12-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823063455/http://www.genetics.org/content/94/4/1011.full.pdf+html |archivedate=2014-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third mode is [[parapatric speciation]]. This is similar to peripatric speciation in that a small population enters a new habitat, but differs in that there is no physical separation between these two populations. Instead, speciation results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce gene flow between the two populations.&lt;ref name="Gavrilets" /&gt; Generally this occurs when there has been a drastic change in the environment within the parental species' habitat. One example is the grass ''[[Anthoxanthum|Anthoxanthum odoratum]]'', which can undergo parapatric speciation in response to localised metal pollution from mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Antonovics |first=Janis |authorlink=Janis Antonovics |date=July 2006 |title=Evolution in closely adjacent plant populations X: long-term persistence of prereproductive isolation at a mine boundary |url=http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v97/n1/full/6800835a.html |journal=[[Heredity (journal)|Heredity]] |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=33–37 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800835 |issn=0018-067X |pmid=16639420 |accessdate=2014-12-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823063443/http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v97/n1/full/6800835a.html |archivedate=2014-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, plants evolve that have resistance to high levels of metals in the soil. Selection against interbreeding with the metal-sensitive parental population produced a gradual change in the flowering time of the metal-resistant plants, which eventually produced complete reproductive isolation. Selection against hybrids between the two populations may cause [[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement]], which is the evolution of traits that promote mating within a species, as well as [[character displacement]], which is when two species become more distinct in appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nosil |first1=Patrik |last2=Crespi |first2=Bernard J. |last3=Gries |first3=Regine |last4=Gries |first4=Gerhard |date=March 2007 |title=Natural selection and divergence in mate preference during speciation |journal=Genetica |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=309–327 |doi=10.1007/s10709-006-0013-6 |pmid=16900317 |issn=0016-6707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in [[sympatric speciation]] species diverge without geographic isolation or changes in habitat.

One type of sympatric speciation involves [[crossbreed]]ing of two related species to produce a new hybrid species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during [[meiosis]] the [[homologous chromosome]]s from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair.

Speciation events are important in the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which accounts for the pattern in the fossil record of short "bursts" of evolution interspersed with relatively long periods of stasis, where species remain relatively unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eldredge|Gould|1972|pp=82–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, speciation and rapid evolution are linked, with natural selection and genetic drift acting most strongly on organisms undergoing speciation in novel habitats or small populations. As a result, the periods of stasis in the fossil record correspond to the parental population and the organisms undergoing speciation and rapid evolution are found in small populations or geographically restricted habitats and therefore rarely being preserved as fossils.&lt;ref name="Gould_1994" /&gt;

Second, the diversity of life is not a set of completely unique organisms, but organisms that share morphological similarities. Third, vestigial traits with no clear purpose resemble functional ancestral traits and finally, that organisms can be classified using these similarities into a hierarchy of nested groups—similar to a family tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=16 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern research has suggested that, due to horizontal gene transfer, this "tree of life" may be more complicated than a simple branching tree since some genes have spread independently between distantly related species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Doolittle |first1=W.

Past species have also left records of their evolutionary history. Fossils, along with the comparative anatomy of present-day organisms, constitute the morphological, or anatomical, record.&lt;ref name=Jablonski&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jablonski |first=David |date=June 25, 1999 |title=The Future of the Fossil Record |journal=Science |volume=284 |issue=5423 |pages=2114–2116 |pmid=10381868 |doi=10.1126/science.284.5423.2114 |issn=0036-8075}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing the anatomies of both modern and extinct species, paleontologists can infer the lineages of those species. However, this approach is most successful for organisms that had hard body parts, such as shells, bones or teeth. Further, as prokaryotes such as bacteria and archaea share a limited set of common morphologies, their fossils do not provide information on their ancestry.

More recently, evidence for common descent has come from the study of biochemical similarities between organisms.

The teaching of evolution in American secondary school biology classes was uncommon in most of the first half of the 20th century.  The [[Scopes Trial]] decision of 1925 caused the subject to become very rare in American secondary biology textbooks for a generation, but it was gradually re-introduced later and became legally protected with the 1968 ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' decision.  Since then, the competing religious belief of creationism was legally disallowed in secondary school curricula in various decisions in the 1970s and 1980s, but it returned in [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] form as [[intelligent design]] (ID), to be excluded once again in the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41883">'''Failure mode and effects analysis''' ('''FMEA''')—also "'''failure modes'''", plural, in many  publications—was one of the first ''highly structured, systematic'' techniques for [[failure analysis]]. It was developed by [[Reliability engineering|reliability engineers]] in the late 1950s to study problems that might arise from malfunctions of military systems. An FMEA is often the first step of a system reliability study. It involves reviewing as many components, assemblies, and subsystems as possible to identify failure modes, and their causes and effects. For each component, the failure modes and their resulting effects on the rest of the system are recorded in a specific FMEA worksheet. There are numerous variations of such worksheets. An FMEA can be a qualitative analysis,&lt;ref&gt;System Reliability Theory: Models, Statistical Methods, and Applications, Marvin Rausand &amp; Arnljot Hoylan, Wiley Series in probability and statistics—second edition 2004, page 88&lt;/ref&gt; but may be put on a quantitative basis when mathematical [[failure rate]] models&lt;ref name="KMTay2"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tay K. M.|author2=Lim C.P. | title=n On the use of fuzzy inference techniques in assessment models: part II: industrial applications |journal=Fuzzy Optimization and Decision Making  |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10700-008-9037-y |doi=10.1007/s10700-008-9037-y |volume=7 |pages=283–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; are combined with a statistical failure mode ratio database.

A few different types of FMEA analyses exist, such as:
* Functional
* Design
* Process

Sometimes FMEA is extended to [[FMECA]] (failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis) to indicate that criticality analysis is performed too.

FMEA is an [[inductive reasoning]] (forward logic) single point of failure analysis and is a core task in [[reliability engineering]], [[safety engineering]] and [[quality engineering]].

A successful FMEA activity helps identify potential failure modes based on experience with similar products and processes—or based on common physics of failure logic. It is widely used in development and manufacturing industries in various phases of the product life cycle. ''Effects analysis'' refers to studying the consequences of those failures on different system levels.

Functional analyses are needed as an input to determine correct failure modes, at all system levels, both for functional FMEA or Piece-Part (hardware) FMEA. An FMEA is used to structure Mitigation for Risk reduction based on either failure (mode) effect severity reduction or based on lowering the probability of failure or both. The FMEA is in principle a full inductive (forward logic) analysis, however the failure probability can only be estimated or reduced by understanding the ''failure mechanism''. Hence, FMEA may include information on causes of failure (deductive analysis) to reduce the possibility of occurrence by eliminating identified [[Root cause|''(root) causes'']].

== Introduction ==
The FME(C)A is a design tool used to systematically analyze postulated component failures and identify the resultant effects on system operations. The analysis is sometimes characterized as consisting of two sub-analyses, the first being the failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), and the second, the criticality analysis (CA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| id                    = JPL-D-5703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful development of an FMEA requires that the analyst include all significant failure modes for each contributing element or part in the system. FMEAs can be performed at the system, subsystem, assembly, subassembly or part level. The [[FMECA]] should be a living document during development of a hardware design. It should be scheduled and completed concurrently with the design. If completed in a timely manner, the FMECA can help guide design decisions. The usefulness of the FMECA as a design tool and in the decision-making process is dependent on the effectiveness and timeliness with which design problems are identified. Timeliness is probably the most important consideration. In the extreme case, the FMECA would be of little value to the design decision process if the analysis is performed after the hardware is built. While the FMECA identifies all part failure modes, its primary benefit is the early identification of all critical and catastrophic subsystem or system failure modes so they can be eliminated or minimized through design modification at the earliest point in the development effort; therefore, the FMECA should be performed at the system level as soon as preliminary design information is available and extended to the lower levels as the detail design progresses.

Remark: For more complete scenario modelling another type of Reliability analysis may be considered, for example [[fault tree analysis]] (FTA); a ''deductive'' (backward logic) failure analysis that may handle multiple failures within the item and/or external to the item including maintenance and logistics. It starts at higher functional / system level. A FTA may use the basic failure mode FMEA records or an effect summary as one of its inputs (the basic events). Interface hazard analysis, Human error analysis and others may be added for completion in scenario modelling.

=== Functional Failure mode and effects analysis ===
The analysis may be performed at the functional level until the design has matured sufficiently to identify specific hardware that will perform the functions; then the analysis should be extended to the hardware level. When performing the hardware level FMECA, interfacing hardware is considered to be operating within specification. In addition, each part failure postulated is considered to be the only failure in the system (i.e., it is a single failure analysis). In addition to the FMEAs done on systems to evaluate the impact lower level failures have on system operation, several other FMEAs are done. Special attention is paid to interfaces between systems and in fact at all functional interfaces. The purpose of these FMEAs is to assure that irreversible physical and/or functional damage is not propagated across the interface as a result of failures in one of the interfacing units. These analyses are done to the piece part level for the circuits that directly interface with the other units. The FMEA can be accomplished without a CA, but a CA requires that the FMEA has previously identified system level critical failures. When both steps are done, the total process is called a FMECA.

=== Ground rules ===
The ground rules of each FMEA include a set of project selected procedures; the assumptions on which the analysis is based; the hardware that has been included and excluded from the analysis and the rationale for the exclusions. The ground rules also describe the indenture level of the analysis, the basic hardware status, and the criteria for system and mission success. Every effort should be made to define all ground rules before the FMEA begins; however, the ground rules may be expanded and clarified as the analysis proceeds. A typical set of ground rules (assumptions) follows:&lt;ref&gt;

# Only one failure mode exists at a time.
# All inputs (including software commands) to the item being analyzed are present and at nominal values.
# All consumables are present in sufficient quantities.
# Nominal power is available

=== Benefits ===
Major benefits derived from a properly implemented FMECA effort are as follows:

# It provides a documented method for selecting a design with a high probability of successful operation and safety.
# A documented uniform method of assessing potential failure mechanisms, failure modes and their impact on system operation, resulting in a list of failure modes ranked according to the seriousness of their system impact and likelihood of occurrence.
# Early identification of single failure points (SFPS) and system interface problems, which may be critical to mission success and/or safety. They also provide a method of verifying that switching between redundant elements is not jeopardized by postulated single failures.
# An effective method for evaluating the effect of proposed changes to the design and/or operational procedures on mission success and safety.
# A basis for in-flight troubleshooting procedures and for locating performance monitoring and fault-detection devices.
# Criteria for early planning of tests.

From the above list, early identifications of SFPS, input to the troubleshooting procedure and locating of performance monitoring / fault detection devices are probably the most important benefits of the FMECA. In addition, the FMECA procedures are straightforward and allow orderly evaluation of the design.

The automotive industry began to use FMEA by the mid 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matsumoto|first=K.|year=1975|title=Reliability Analysis of Catalytic Converter as an Automotive Emission Control System|url=http://papers.sae.org/750178|journal=SAE Technical Paper 750178|doi=10.4271/750178|author2=T.

In 1993 the [[Automotive Industry Action Group]] (AIAG) first published an FMEA standard for the automotive industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Potential Failure Mode and Effect Analysis|last=AIAG|publisher=Automotive Industry Action Group|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now in its fourth edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.aiag.org/source/Orders/index.cfm?search=FMEA-4|title=Potential Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), 4th Edition|last=AIAG|publisher=Automotive Industry Action Group|year=2008|isbn=9781605341361}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SAE first published related standard J1739 in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://standards.sae.org/j1739_199407/|title=Potential Failure Mode and Effects Analysis in Design (Design FMEA), Potential Failure Mode and Effects Analysis in Manufacturing and Assembly Processes (Process FMEA), and Potential Failure Mode and Effects Analysis for Machinery (Machinery FMEA)|last=SAE|publisher=SAE International|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard is also now in its fourth edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://standards.sae.org/j1739_200208/|title=Potential Failure Mode and Effects Analysis in Design (Design FMEA) and Potential Failure Mode and Effects Analysis in Manufacturing and Assembly Processes (Process FMEA) and Effects Analysis for Machinery (Machinery FMEA)|last=SAE|publisher=SAE International|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method is now supported by the [[American Society for Quality]] which provides detailed guides on applying the method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asq.org/learn-about-quality/process-analysis-tools/overview/fmea.html|title=Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA)|publisher=ASQ|accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA)
procedures identify the product failure mechanisms, but may not model them without specialized software. This limits their applicability to provide a meaningful input to critical procedures such as virtual qualification, root cause analysis, accelerated test programs, and to remaining life assessment. To overcome the shortcomings of FMEA and FMECA a Failure Modes, Mechanisms and Effect Analysis (FMMEA) has often been used.

== Basic terms ==
The following covers some basic FMEA terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Langford |first1=J. W. |title=Logistics: Principles and Applications |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=1995 |page=488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Failure
: The loss of a function under stated conditions.
;Failure mode
:The specific manner or way by which a failure occurs in terms of failure of the item (being a part or (sub) system) ''function'' under investigation; it may generally describe the way the failure occurs. It shall at least clearly describe a (end) failure state of the item (or function in case of a Functional FMEA) under consideration. It is the result of the failure mechanism (cause of the failure mode). ''For example; a fully fractured axle, a deformed axle or a fully open or fully closed electrical contact are each a separate failure mode of a DFMEA, they would not be failure modes of a PFMEA. Here you examine your process, so process step x - insert drill bit, the failure mode would be insert wrong drill bit, the effect of this is too big a hole or too small a hole.''
;Failure cause and/or mechanism
:Defects in requirements, design, process, quality control, handling or part application, which are the underlying cause or sequence of causes that initiate a process (mechanism) that leads to a failure mode over a certain time. A failure mode may have more causes. ''For example; "fatigue or corrosion of a structural beam" or "fretting corrosion in an electrical contact" is a failure mechanism and in itself (likely) not a failure mode. The related failure mode (end state) is a "full fracture of structural beam" or "an open electrical contact". The initial cause might have been "Improper application of corrosion protection layer (paint)" and /or "(abnormal) vibration input from another (possibly failed) system".
;Failure effect
:Immediate consequences of a failure on operation, function or functionality, or status of some item.
;Indenture levels (bill of material or functional breakdown)
:An identifier for system level and thereby item complexity. Complexity increases as levels are closer to one.
;Local effect
:The failure effect as it applies to the item under analysis.
;Next higher level effect
:The failure effect as it applies at the next higher indenture level.
;End effect
:The failure effect at the highest indenture level or total system.
;Detection
:The means of detection of the failure mode by maintainer, operator or built in detection system, including estimated dormancy period (if applicable) 
;Probability
:The likelihood of the failure occurring.
; Risk Priority Number (RPN)
:Severity (of the event) * Probability (of the event occurring) * Detection (Probability that the event would not be detected before the user was aware of it) 
;Severity
:The consequences of a failure mode. Severity considers the worst potential consequence of a failure, determined by the degree of injury, property damage, system damage and/or time lost to repair the failure.
;Remarks / mitigation / actions
:Additional info, including the proposed mitigation or actions used to lower a risk or justify a risk level or scenario.

=== Probability (P) ===
It is necessary to look at the cause of a failure mode and the likelihood of occurrence. This can be done by analysis, calculations / FEM, looking at similar items or processes and the failure modes that have been documented for them in the past. A failure cause is looked upon as a design weakness. All the potential causes for a failure mode should be identified and documented. This should be in technical terms. Examples of causes are: Human errors in handling, Manufacturing induced faults, Fatigue, Creep, Abrasive wear, erroneous algorithms, excessive voltage or improper operating conditions or use (depending on the used ground rules).
A failure mode is given a ''Probability Ranking''.

| Remote (relatively few failures)
|-
| C
| Occasional (occasional failures)
|-
| D
| Reasonably Possible (repeated failures)
|-
| E
| Frequent (failure is almost inevitable)
|}

=== Severity (S) ===
Determine the Severity for the worst-case scenario adverse end effect (state). It is convenient to write these effects down in terms of what the user might see or experience in terms of functional failures. Examples of these end effects are: full loss of function x, degraded performance, functions in reversed mode, too late functioning, erratic functioning, etc. Each end effect is given a Severity number (S) from, say, I (no effect) to V (catastrophic), based on cost and/or loss of life or quality of life. These numbers prioritize the failure modes (together with probability and detectability). Below a typical classification is given. Other classifications are possible. See also [[hazard analysis]].

{| class="wikitable"
|-

!Meaning
|-
| I
| No relevant effect on reliability or safety

|-
| V
| Catastrophic (product becomes inoperative; the failure may result in complete unsafe operation and possible multiple deaths)
|}

=== Detection (D) ===
The means or method by which a failure is detected, isolated by operator and/or maintainer and the time it may take. This is important for maintainability control (availability of the system) and it is especially important for multiple failure scenarios. This may involve dormant failure ''modes'' (e.g. No direct system effect, while a redundant system / item automatically takes over or when the failure only is problematic during specific mission or system states) or latent failures (e.g. deterioration failure ''mechanisms'', like a metal growing crack, but not a critical length). It should be made clear how the failure mode or cause can be discovered by an operator under normal system operation or if it can be discovered by the maintenance crew by some diagnostic action or automatic built in system test. A dormancy and/or latency period may be entered.

| 3
| High 
|-
| 4
| Moderate 
|-
| 5
| Low 
|-
| 6
| Fault is undetected by Operators or Maintainers 
|}

=== Dormancy or Latency Period ===
The average time that a failure mode may be undetected may be entered if known. For example:

* Seconds, auto detected by maintenance computer
* 8 hours, detected by turn-around inspection
* 2 months, detected by scheduled maintenance block X
* 2 years, detected by overhaul task x

=== Indication ===
If the undetected failure allows the system to remain in a ''safe'' / working state, a second failure situation should be explored to determine whether or not an indication will be evident to all ''operators'' and what corrective action they may or should take.

Indications to the operator should be described as follows:

* Normal. An indication that is evident to an operator when the system or equipment is operating normally.
* Abnormal. An indication that is evident to an operator when the system has malfunctioned or failed.
* Incorrect. An erroneous indication to an operator due to the malfunction or failure of an indicator (i.e., instruments, sensing devices, visual or audible warning devices, etc.).

PERFORM DETECTION COVERAGE ANALYSIS FOR TEST PROCESSES AND MONITORING (From ARP4761 Standard):

This type of analysis is useful to determine how effective various test processes are at the detection of latent and dormant faults. The method used to accomplish this involves an examination of the applicable failure modes to determine whether or not their effects are detected, and to determine the percentage of failure rate applicable to the failure modes which are detected. The possibility that the detection means may itself fail latently should be accounted for in the coverage analysis as a limiting factor (i.e., coverage cannot be more reliable than the detection means availability). Inclusion of the detection coverage in the FMEA can lead to each individual failure that would have been one effect category now being a separate effect category due to the detection coverage possibilities. Another way to include detection coverage is for the FTA to conservatively assume that no holes in coverage due to latent failure in the detection method affect detection of all failures assigned to the failure effect category of concern. The FMEA can be revised if
necessary for those cases where this conservative assumption does not allow the top event probability requirements to be met.

After these three basic steps the Risk level may be provided.

=== Risk level (P*S) and (D) ===
'''Risk is the combination of End Effect Probability And Severity''' where probability and severity includes the effect on non-detectability ('''dormancy time'''). This may influence the end effect probability of failure or the worst case effect Severity. The exact calculation may not be easy in all cases, such as those where multiple scenarios (with multiple events) are possible and detectability / dormancy plays a crucial role (as for redundant systems). In that case Fault Tree Analysis and/or Event Trees may be needed to determine exact probability and risk levels.

Preliminary Risk levels can be selected based on a Risk Matrix like shown below, based on Mil. Std. 882.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-0800-0899/MIL-STD-882E_41682/|title=MIL-STD-882 E SYSTEM SAFETY|website=www.everyspec.com|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher the Risk level, the more justification and mitigation is needed to provide evidence and lower the risk to an acceptable level. High risk should be indicated to higher level management, who are responsible for final decision-making.

* After this step the FMEA has become like a [[FMECA]].

== Timing ==
The FMEA should be updated whenever:
* A new cycle begins (new product/process)
* Changes are made to the operating conditions
* A change is made in the design
* New regulations are instituted
* Customer feedback indicates a problem

== Uses ==
* Development of system requirements that minimize the likelihood of failures.
* Development of designs and test systems to ensure that the failures have been eliminated or the risk is reduced to acceptable level.
* Development and evaluation of diagnostic systems
* To help with design choices (trade-off analysis).

== Advantages ==
{{Prose|section|date=January 2017}}
* Catalyst for teamwork and idea exchange between functions
* Collect information to reduce future failures, capture engineering knowledge
* Early identification and elimination of potential failure modes
* Emphasize problem prevention
* Improve company image and competitiveness
* Improve production yield
* Improve the quality, reliability, and safety of a product/process
* Increase user satisfaction
* Maximize profit
* Minimize late changes and associated cost
* Reduce impact on company profit margin
* Reduce system development time and cost
* Reduce the possibility of same kind of failure in future
* Reduce the potential for warranty concerns

== Limitations ==
While FMEA identifies important hazards in a system, its results may not be comprehensive and the approach has limitations.&lt;ref name="potts2014"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Potts H.W.W. |author2=Anderson J.E. |author3=Colligan L. |author4=Leach P. |author5=Davis S. |author6=Berman J. | title=Assessing the validity of prospective hazard analysis methods: A comparison of two techniques |journal=BMC Health Services Research |volume=14 |year=2014 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/14/41 |doi=10.1186/1472-6963-14-41 |pmid= |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franklin BD, Shebl NA, Barber N: "Failure mode and effects analysis: too little for too much?"

J Patient Saf 2009, 5: 86–94&lt;/ref&gt; In the healthcare context, FMEA and other risk assessment methods, including SWIFT ([[Structured What If Technique]]) and retrospective approaches, have been found to have limited validity when used in isolation. Challenges around scoping and organisational boundaries appear to be a major factor in this lack of validity.&lt;ref name="potts2014" /&gt;

If used as a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] tool, FMEA may only identify major failure modes in a system. [[Fault tree analysis|Fault tree analysis (FTA)]] is better suited for "top-down" analysis. When used as a "bottom-up" tool FMEA can augment or complement FTA and identify many more causes and failure modes resulting in top-level symptoms. It is not able to discover complex failure modes involving multiple failures within a subsystem, or to report expected failure intervals of particular failure modes up to the upper level subsystem or system.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Additionally, the multiplication of the severity, occurrence and detection rankings may result in rank reversals, where a less serious failure mode receives a higher RPN than a more serious failure mode.&lt;ref name='Kmenta2004-11'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1115/1.1799614 |title=Scenario-Based Failure Modes and Effects Analysis Using Expected Cost |year=2004 |last1=Kmenta |first1=Steven |last2=Ishii |first2=Koshuke |journal=Journal of Mechanical Design |volume=126 |issue=6 |page=1027}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is that the rankings are [[ordinal scale]] numbers, and multiplication is not defined for ordinal numbers. The ordinal rankings only say that one ranking is better or worse than another, but not by how much. For instance, a ranking of "2" may not be twice as severe as a ranking of "1," or an "8" may not be twice as severe as a "4," but multiplication treats them as though they are. See [[Level of measurement]] for further discussion. Various solutions to this problems have been proposed, e.g., the use of [[fuzzy logic]] as an alternative to classic RPN model.&lt;ref name="KMTay"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jee T.L. |author2=Tay K.

Process FMEA can be challenging for participants who have not completed many PFMEAS, often confusing FAILURE MODES with EFFECTS and CAUSES.  To clarify, a Process FMEA shows how the process can go wrong.  Using a detailed Process Map will aid the person filling in the worksheet to correctly list the steps of the process being reviewed.  The FAILURE MODE is then simply how that step can go wrong.  Example, Process Step 1. Pick Up right handed part.  Can they pick up the wrong part? (some manufacturing centers have left and right handed parts etc.)  FAILURE MODE put left hand part in, EFFECT could be wrecked CNC machine and scrapped part, or hole drilled in wrong location.  The cause, keeping inventory of similar parts at the job.  Why is it important to do a PFMEA with regard to the process?  When a process is examined or if we ask what can go wrong with the process unknown issues are uncovered, solving problems before they occur and tackling root cause issues or at least 2 Y's deep on a 5 Y.  Here the manufacturing engineer could possibly poke yoke the tooling to prevent a left handed part in the fixture when running the right handed parts or program a touch off probe in the CNC programming - all before ever making the mistake the first time.  If a PFMEA is set up where the FAILURE MODE relates to the feature on the print, example FAILURE MODE drilled hole too big - no further understanding of what caused the problem is gained.  Numerous PFMEA's have been examined and show that little to no value is gained when reviewing features off of a print as FAILURE MODES - little understanding of the cause is gained.  New PFMEA practitioners often try to relate the PFMEA FAILURE MODE to the FEATURE, numerous authors list this as trying to inspect in quality rather than listing the process step determining how it can go wrong and building in quality through root cause evaluation.

Besides, two shortcomings are
# complexity of the FMEA worksheet;
# intricacy of its use. Entries in an FMEA worksheet are voluminous.

The FMEA worksheet is hard to produce, hard to understand and read, as well as hard to maintain. The use of neural network techniques to cluster and visualise failure modes were suggested, recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tay K.M. |author2=Jong C.H. |author3=Lim C.P. | title=A clustering-based failure mode and effect analysis model and its application to the edible bird nest industry |journal=Neural Computing and Applications |volume=26|year=2015|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-014-1647-4|doi=10.1007/s00521-014-1647-4 |pages=  551–560}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chang|first1=Wui Lee  |last2=Tay|first2=Kai Meng |last3=Lim |first3=Chee Peng|date=Nov 2015|title=Clustering and visualization of failure modes using an evolving tree|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417415002729|journal=Expert Systems with Applications|volume=42 |pages=7235–7244 |doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2015.04.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chang|first1=Wui Lee  |last2=Pang|first2=Lie Meng |last3=Tay |first3=Kai Meng|date=March 2017|title=Application of Self-Organizing Map to Failure Modes and Effects Analysis Methodology|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231217305702|journal=Neurocomputing|volume=PP|pages=PP |doi=10.1016/j.neucom.2016.04.073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
*'''Functional''': before design solutions are provided (or only on high level) functions can be evaluated on potential functional failure effects. General Mitigations ("design to" requirements) can be proposed to limit consequence of functional failures or limit the probability of occurrence in this early development. It is based on a functional breakdown of a system. This type may also be used for Software evaluation.
*'''Concept Design / Hardware''': analysis of systems or subsystems in the early design concept stages to analyse the failure mechanisms and lower level functional failures, specially to different concept solutions in more detail. It may be used in trade-off studies.
*'''Detailed Design / Hardware''': analysis of products prior to production. These are the most detailed (in mil 1629 called Piece-Part or Hardware FMEA) FMEAs and used to identify any possible hardware (or other) failure mode up to the lowest part level. It should be based on hardware breakdown (e.g. the BoM = Bill of Material). Any Failure effect Severity, failure Prevention (Mitigation), Failure Detection and Diagnostics may be fully analyzed in this FMEA.
*'''Process''': analysis of manufacturing and assembly processes. Both quality and reliability may be affected from process faults. The input for this FMEA is amongst others a work process / task Breakdown.

'''Field dependence''' is a concept in the field of [[cognitive styles]]. It is a [[cognitive style#Bipolar.2C one-dimensional models and measures|one-dimensional model]] of variation in cognitive style. The concept was first proposed by American psychologist [[Herman Witkin]] in 1962. Field dependence/independence was the earliest studied area in the study of cognitive styles.

In general, people who exhibit field dependence tend to rely on information provided by the outer world, the field or frame of a situation and their cognition (toward other things) is based on this overall field.

== Measures ==
Field Dependence or Independence is indicated by the Tilting Rod and Frame Test and the Tilting Room, Tilting Chair Test. The tilt of the frame or room provided a field and the degree of independence from it was shown by the accuracy with which the subject had the experimenter adjust the rod or chair. Their interpretation and the concept of field dependence/independence was initially presented by Witkin and his group in his book ''Personality Through Perception''. As its title suggests, other tests were studied and reported on. A field dependence/independence factor was reported in his later book, ''Psychological Differentiation''.

Later, Witkin and his group developed an Embedded Figure Test and did more work with human development. The EFT figured prominently in ''Psychological Differentiation''. Differentiation was shown by an ability to trace a figure "embedded" within a more complex figure. Field-independent people were generally more differentiated, but differentiation was a broader concept than field dependency.

Witkin's group participated in developing their concepts and were given coauthor credit in their two books. The group included the psychoanalyst Helen Block Lewis, the psychologist Hanna Fatterson, and the experimental psychologist Don Goodenough.

More independently, Witkin wrote a ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'' review of relationships between Field Dependency/Psychological Differentiation and types of psychopathology. For example, field-independent people appeared to be more likely to develop delusions while field-dependent people were more likely to have scattered hallucinations.

Educational Testing Service (ETS) produced a [[Group Embedded Figures Test]], suited for testing a classroom of students. It correlated with the EFT to an extent, but was not exactly the same in some correlations. After his work on the books and review, Witkin went to ETS and published some ETS reviews of the thousands of studies related to Field Dependency/Psychological Differentiation.

A rating scale was developed for the Draw a Person Test by Witkin's clinicians, described in ''Psychological Differentiation'', and was widely used as another measure of psychological differentiation. In it, greater psychological differentiation was shown by more sophisticated detail, demonstrating more specific identity.

Less differentiated people were usually also more field-dependent and were more inclined to use what Witkin's clinicians in ''Psychological Differentiation'' called "massive global repression." Since his experienced clinicians could also recognize field dependence and lack of psychological differentiation upon meeting subjects, however, their conclusion about subjects' use of repression was open to possible contamination.

Their repression hypothesis was more objectively supported for group extremes by studies of "perceptual defense"—the tendency to recognize emotionally significant, disturbing words less easily than more neutral words. Such "defense" had been shown by numerous studies to be correlated with a tendency to repress as shown by measures such as the MMPI.

Those average in Differentiation/Field Independence had been given little specific attention since it was assumed they would simply be intermediate in repression.

In their perceptual defense, however, they were not intermediate. People who were average (statistically "normal") were more able to recognize words if they were emotionally significant. That was defended as making more sense in evolutionary/survival terms. (Minard, et. al. in various publications). It seems reasonable to suppose that average ("normal") subjects can confuse the results of a study that includes them without recognizing their particular contribution.

=== Rod and Frame Test (RFT) ===
{{main|Rod and frame test}}
To be more specific, in the RFT, examinees are required to sit in a completely dark room without reflecting surfaces where a 3.5 foot luminous square frame with one inch wide sides contains a rod much like one of the sides. The test is properly given after brief (120-second) dark adaptation and the large glowing RFT is seven feet from the subject so it is a dramatic visual display filling much of the visual field. If the test is given with insufficient dark adaptation, many subjects will see the luminous stimulus disappear or fragment when they fixate it visually and a large proportion of them will not happen to report that. The test's validity then is not known. Hebb and others have written about the fragmentation phenomenon.

The RFT is presented with the tilt of rod and tilt of frame in every possible order (RR, LL, RL, LR). The examinee is then asked to tell the examiner how to adjust the rod to "straight up and down like the flagpole outside." Scores are based the number of degrees away from 90.

A less commonly used task was the tilting-room-tilting-chair test, which was similar to the RFT but involved rotating the participant in a chair within a room that also rotated.&lt;ref name="Kirton"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael|last=Kirton |year=1978 |title=Field dependence and adaptation-innovation theories|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=47 |pages=1239–1245 |url=http://www.amsciepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2466/pms.1978.47.3f.1239 |doi=10.2466/pms.1978.47.3f.1239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Embedded Figures Test (EFT) ===
Examinees are shown a simple geometric figure and then asked to find the simple figure embedded or hidden in a relatively complex figure. Examinees may circle the figure and are scored based on identifying the full, correct figure.&lt;ref name="Goodstein"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodstein |first=L. D. |chapter=Review of Group Embedded Figures Test  |editor-last=Buros |editor-first= Oscar K. |title=[[The Eighth Mental Measurements Yearbook]] |year=1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying learning style theory is that field-independent people can better ignore the influence of the background image and find the hidden figure, while field-dependent people will find it harder to ignore the irrelevant field and will be slower to locate the figure. The Witkin EFT was first developed by [[Herman Witkin]] as suggested by the figures of [[Kurt Gotschaldt]] and described in his book ''Psychological Differentiation'' by Witkin's group. Thurston had an earlier Hidden Figures Test which correlated with the EFT but had a different pattern of other correlations.

Researchers since Witkin's group have extended the use of this measure to other concepts, including components of memory and logic.&lt;ref name="EFT CA"&gt;{{citation |title=Embedded Figures Test (Cognitive Atlas) |url= http://www.cognitiveatlas.org/term/id/trm_4b749b8829eee }}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures may also be sensitive to traits of Autism Spectrum Disorder, where individuals with ASD are quicker to solve EFT tasks.&lt;ref name="Pheno"&gt;{{citation |title=Embedded Figures Test (PhenoWiki) |url=http://149.142.158.188/phenowiki/wiki/index.php/Embedded_Figures_Test |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131118091207/http://149.142.158.188/phenowiki/wiki/index.php/Embedded_Figures_Test |archivedate=2013-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4110">'''Francis Polkinghorne Pascoe''' (1 September 1813 – 20 June 1893) was an English [[Entomology|entomologist]] mainly interested in Coleoptera, commonly known as [[beetle]]s.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Penzance]], Cornwall and trained at [[St. Bartholomew's Hospital]], London. Appointed surgeon in the [[Royal Navy|Navy]] he served on Australian, [[West Indies|West Indian]] and [[Mediterranean]] stations. He married a Miss Mary Glasson of [[Cornwall]] and settled at [[Trewhiddle]] near [[St Austell]] where his wife's property produced [[china clay]]. Widowed in 1851 he settled in London devoting himself to [[natural history]] and [[entomology]] in particular. The results of collecting trips to Europe, North Africa and the [[Amazon Rainforest|Lower Amazons]] were poor and Pascoe worked mainly on insects collected by others. His entomological papers listed and described species collected by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] (in ''Longicornia Malayana''), [[Robert Templeton]] and other assiduous collectors but not prolific writers on [[systematics|systematic]]  entomology. He became a Fellow of the [[Royal Entomological Society of London|Entomological Society]] in 1854, was president from 1864–1865, a Member of the [[Société Entomologique de France]] and belonged to the Belgian and [[Stettin Entomological Society|Stettin]] Societies. He was also a Fellow of the [[Linnean Society]] (elected 1852) and was on the Council of the [[Ray Society]]. His 2,500 [[Type (zoology)|types]] are in the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], London.

Pascoe accepted the fact of [[evolution]] but was an opponent to [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/naturalscience03lond#page/159/mode/1up Natural Science: A Monthly Review of Scientific Progress, Volume 3]. (1893). Macmillan &amp; Company. p. 159. "Although a believer in evolution, he was, with so many of the older systematists, opposed to the theory of Natural Selection."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harvey Luskin Molotch''' (born January 3, 1940) is an American [[sociologist]] known for studies that have reconceptualized power relations in interaction, the mass media, and the city.  He helped create the field of [[environmental sociology]] and has advanced [[qualitative methods]] in the [[social sciences]].  In recent years, Molotch helped develop a new field—the sociology of objects. He is currently a professor of [[Sociology]] and of Metropolitan Studies at [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyu.edu/academics/open-education/faculty-highlights/harvey-molotch.html&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Introduction to Sociology'' is featured as one of NYU Open Education's courses available to stream freely.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyu.edu/academics/open-education/coursesnew/intro-sociology.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other courses that he teaches include ''Approaches to Metropolitan Studies'' and ''Urban Objects''. He is also affiliated with the graduate program in Humanities and Social Thought.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.draper.fas.nyu.edu/object/draper.people.mastersteachers&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Molotch was born Harvey Luskin in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], where his family was in the retail car business on one side and the [[Luskin's]] home appliance business on the other. His father, Paul Luskin, died in the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in 1944 during [[World War II]].  His mother remarried to Nathan Molotch. He received a B.A. in Philosophy from the [[University of Michigan]] (1963), with a thesis on [[John Dewey]]. He received an M.A. (1966) and Ph.D. (1968) in Sociology from the [[University of Chicago]]. He served in the [[U.S. Army]], stationed in [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]], 1961-62.

He taught at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] from 1967 to 2003. He has also been a visiting professor at [[Stony Brook University]], the [[University of Essex]], and [[Northwestern University]]. In 1998-99  he was Centennial Professor at the [[London School of Economics]].

His 1964 marriage to Linda Molotch ended with her death, by car accident, in 1976. The couple had two children, Shana (born 1969), now with two children and living in Northern California; and Noah (born 1972), now with two children and living in Boulder Colorado where he is on faculty at University of Colorado as [[hydrology|hydrological]] scientist, as well as research scientist at [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]. Molotch has lived with his domestic partner, Glenn Wharton, a conservator at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and faculty member at New York University, since 1979.

==Ideas==
===Racial Segregation: Rethinking “White Flight”===

Molotch's early work on "[[white flight]]" overturned conventional wisdom on neighborhood change, showing that normal mobility makes neighborhood racial change possible. When blacks constitute the bulk of those who move into the vacancies that result, racial change is made inevitable. The implication of this finding, based on Molotch's systematic studies of matched neighborhoods (and since replicated by others on large data sets), was that it is the reluctance of whites to move into a changing neighborhood that makes racial integration so difficult to achieve. From a policy perspective, Molotch concluded that while stabilizing neighborhoods would not be easy, the focus needs to be on getting white people to replace the whites who are leaving, rather than talking people who are leaving into staying.

===The Santa Barbara Oil Spill and Environmental Sociology===

On January 28, 1969, there was a massive eruption of crude oil from Union Oil's Platform A in the [[Santa Barbara Channel]]--an eruption which was to cover much of the coast line of two counties with oil. Molotch saw in this disaster a research opportunity. His article "Oil in Santa Barbara and Power in America" became a founding document of the new field of [[environmental sociology]], and a key contribution to [[political sociology]].

Molotch argued that accident research at the local level might be capable of revealing what political scientists called the "second face of power." This is a dimension of power ordinarily ignored by traditional community studies which fail to concern themselves with the processes by which bias is mobilized and thus how issues rise and fall.

Molotch's findings highlighted the extraordinary intransigence of national institutions in the face of local dissent, but more importantly, pointed out the processes and tactics which undermine that dissent and frustrate and radicalize the dissenters. Molotch called for comparable studies of the agriculture industry, the banking industry, and for more accident research at the local level, which might bring to light the larger social arrangements which structure the parameters of such local debate.  In this way, research at the local level might serve as an avenue to knowledge about ''national'' power.  Molotch ended, "Sociologists should be ready when an accident hits in their neighborhood, and then go to work."

===The Mass Media and the Social Construction Framework===

Molotch helped introduce the [[social constructionism|social construction]] framework to the study of news media.  Whereas news accounts had been treated, however critically, as "failed" representations of a presumed reality, Molotch and Marilyn Lester held that every account is a product of the social organization that goes into its production.  In founding papers in the sociology of the mass media, Molotch and Lester applied the insights of ethnomethodology to the Santa Barbara oil spill and the way it was covered. They argued for an approach to the mass media which does not look for reality, but for practices of those having the power to determine the experience of others.

In addition, Molotch and Lester recognized that this social construction of the news had a crucial political component, a perspective later endorsed by such media sociologists as W. Lance Bennett. In normal times, Molotch and Lester said, the news is merely the ritualized presentation of the stories of powerful corporate and governmental organizations. Only in certain contexts does the veil of this ruling elite consensus get pushed aside to reveal other possible constructions of the facts. Molotch and Lester pointed to such disruptive contexts as scandals and accidents like the Santa Barbara Oil Spill, while Bennett pointed to significant social issues that break through the normally ritualized conflicts of the two political parties.

Molotch's work has inspired studies of the social construction of news, of the particular ways that the content of presentation is contingent on the social setting of its production, including the occupational workplace of news professionals as well as the larger societal setting.  His more recent work on mass media has included studies of war protest and the stock market.

===The City as a Growth Machine===

Molotch is probably best known for his book ''Urban Fortunes'' (1987, with John Logan), which won sociology's most prestigious prize for scholarship in 1990. Urban Fortunes builds on Molotch's 1976 classic paper, "The City as a Growth Machine."  In this body of work, Molotch took the dominant convention of studying urban land use and turned it on its head.  The field of [[urban sociology]] (as well as urban geography, planning, and economics) was dominated by the idea that cities were basically containers for human action, in which actors competed among themselves for the most strategic parcels of land, and the real estate market reflected the state of that competition.  Out of this competition were thought to come the shape of the city and the distribution of social types within it (e.g. banks in the center, affluent residents in the suburbs).  Long established notions such as central place theory and the sectoral hypothesis were claims that are more or less "natural" spatial geography evolved from competitive market activity.

Molotch helped reverse the course of [[urban theory]] by pointing out that land parcels were not empty fields awaiting human action, but were associated with specific interests—commercial, sentimental, and psychological.  Especially important in shaping cities were the real estate interests of those whose properties gain value when growth takes place.  These actors make up what Molotch termed "the local growth machine" -- a term now standard in the urban studies lexicon.  From this perspective, cities need to be studied (and compared) in terms of the organization, lobbying, manipulating, and structuring carried out by these actors.  The outcome—the shape of cities and the distribution of their peoples—is thus not due to an interpersonal market or geographic necessities, but to social actions, including opportunistic dealing. ''Urban Fortunes'' has influenced hundreds of national and international studies.  A twentieth anniversary edition was issued by the University of California Press in 2007 with a new preface.

===Other work===

Molotch has also conducted a series of studies in [[conversation analysis]] on mechanisms such as gaps and silences in human conversation that reveal the way power operates at the micro-interactional level. This work includes  a notable collaboration with Mitchell Duneier on talk between men on the street and women passersby. His research builds on writings of Don Zimmerman, [[Harvey Sacks]], [[Gail Jefferson]], and [[Emanuel Schegloff]]. Molotch was among the first to utilize ethnomethodology and conversation analysis in the study of traditional sociological topics, bridging what had been regarded as a highly esoteric and specialized approach to micro-sociology with mainstream, macro-level sociological issues such as hegemony and power.

More recently in ''Where Stuff Comes From'', Molotch builds on the work of [[Howard S. Becker]] and [[Bruno Latour]], to show how objects and physical artifacts are joint result of various types of actors, most particularly product designers operating within frameworks of technology, regulation, mass tastes, and corporate profits. While neo-Marxists and others have treated "[[commodity fetishism]]" as a signal of oppression, repression, and delusion, he uses goods to understand, in a more comprehensive way, just what makes production happen and how artifacts reveal larger social and cultural forces.

'''''High Adventure Role Playing''''' ('''''HARP''''') is a [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]], designed by Tim Dugger &amp; [[Heike A. Kubasch]], and published by [[Iron Crown Enterprises]] ('''ICE''').

== Background ==
'''''HARP''''' is produced by [[Iron Crown Enterprises]], the same company that produces ''[[Rolemaster]]'', but the mechanics of the system are very much simplified in comparison. The system also takes cues from the ''[[d20 system]]''.

== System ==
The ''HARP'' book is 15 chapters long, with the first nine devoted to character generation.

=== Professions ===
''HARP'' has Professions that determine which sets of skills are favoured or not, many also provide level bonuses to skills, spell spheres and/or talents.  The Professions in ''HARP Revised'' are: Cleric, Fighter, Harper, Mage, Monk, Ranger, Rogue, Thief, and Warrior Mage. Additional professions are found in other support books and include: Paladin, Beastmaster, Elementalist, Thaumaturge, Necromancer, Vivimancer, Adventurer, Mystic, Shadowblade, &amp; Druid.  ''HARP'''s Professions are designed to be flexible, with a single level progression chart allowing the player to build the character he or she wants from the base profession.

=== Statistics ===
A system of eight [[statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]] are used for characters featuring Strength, Constitution, Agility, Quickness, Self Discipline, Reasoning, Insight and Presence. Statistics range from 1 to 105.

Statistics are generated during [[character creation]] one of three ways: -

* The first is to roll [[percentile dice|1d100]] eight times (re-rolling any result below 40) and assign the eight results.
* The second is to divide 550 points amongst the eight scores, with an increased cost to raise a score above 90.
* The third is to roll 10d10 and add the total to 500, then assigning that total to the scores as in method two.

Much of the game play revolves around the ability scores, (the Development Points that are used throughout the rest of character creation are based on these scores,) so a character generated with method one runs a risk of not being playable, though the chance of a highly exceptional score is possible.

=== Races and Cultures===
Player characters in ''HARP'' belong to one of a set of [[Race (fantasy)|fantasy races]]: Human, [[dwarf (mythology)|Dwarf]], [[Elf]], [[Gnome]] and [[Halfling]]; ''Harp'' adds the ''Gryx'', a race who are physically similar to [[Orc]]s, with a more peaceful mentality.

''HARP'' does not directly offer mixed races. Instead characters may purchase Greater and Lesser Blood Talents to customize their character.  Greater Blood Talents reflect the more traditional half-race, (meaning that the character is half the Base Race and half the Race chosen with the Blood Talent,) while Lesser Blood Talents represent traits from inter-racial ancestors.

Cultures represent the other side to the [[nature versus nurture]] equation. These traits represent the character's upbringing, from nomadic and rural, to urban and underhill. These directly influence the character's background, starting location, clothing, demeanour and language.  They provide a relatively standard set of cultural skill ranks called adolescent ranks.  These skills are typical skills that most people in a culture will learn in their formative years.

==== Cyradon Races ====

There is also a new campaign setting offered by ICE which is called ''Gryphon World'' and has set its main focus on the continent of ''Cyradon''.  It offers a variation on the standard fantasy races, with the Dwarves becoming the Mablung, the Arali and Sithi replacing the normal elves, the Rhona a wise gnomish race, Nagazi a civilized lizard race, and Gryphons as a flying quadruped race.

Notably it excludes Halflings, orcs, goblins, kobolds and many other standard fantasy races and creatures by default.

===Skills ===
There are 10 skill categories with 3-9 skills each, for a total of 60 skills. Some skills have sub-skills (that are a little more difficult to perform). Each profession receives 20 starting ranks, divided among their favored skill categories, and can build from there with development points.

Skills are used by rolling an open ended d100 (96-100 re-roll and add), adding your skill bonus and the related stat bonus, a modifier for the difficulty of the task, and trying to get over 101. Difficulty modifiers range from Mundane (+60) to Absurd (-100).

Spells are purchased in this stage as well, each spell is purchased as a separate skill.  Several professions have a Professional Sphere of spells, and any character may purchase spells from the Universal Sphere.  Spells are powered by '''[[magic point|Power Points]]''', and in order to be able to cast a spell, a character must have a rank in that spell equal to the power points needed.  Spells  can be scaled upwardly, thereby increasing the required power points and skill ranks needed to cast the scaled version of the spell.

=== Talents ===
Talents are both inherent to the character's race and available as a form of character customization. In order to obtain a talent the character expends DP while creating or levelling up a character. GM's are encouraged to customize the available talents and even require in game explanations should they wish.  Forty-one talents make up the Master List in ''HARP Revised Edition'' (though more are available in support material) and include Dark Vision, Blazing speed, Ambidexterity, Familiar, Athletic, Shapechanger and Outdoorsman.

Special Starting Items such as an Item of Quality or a Loyal Domesticated or Unusual Animal or Creature are also available, and while not talents, they are purchased in the same way.

=== Fate Points ===
Fate Points are a way to aid in dice rolls in critical circumstances or in reducing critical wounds, a single Fate Point is worth +50 on the dice or a -25 to the critical received and can be purchased at a cost of 5 development points to a maximum of 5 Fate Points. All new player characters begin with 3 fate points. These points are a method of allowing the heroic protagonists to achieve the heroic, they are not normally given to non player characters.

=== Training Packages ===
Training packages are sets of linked skills that come at a discount and hail from a common background. Characters may take one package per level. Examples include Bounty Hunter, Astothian Archer, Jade Dragon, and Tyrian Sage.

This allows quick customizations of professions within settings without the need to create a new profession.  For example, in a military order within a campaign several training packages can be created to mimic troop specialization and or rank.  Only one training package can be acquired by a character at each level.

== Awards ==
On August 21, 2004, HARP won the Silver ENnie for Best Non-d20 Game at [[Gen Con]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enworld.org/ennies/2004.html EN World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pricing ==
''HARP'' is available from the OneBookShelf network &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rpgnow.com/product/104176/High-Adventure-Role-Playing-Fantasy?term=high+adventure+ro&lt;/ref&gt; It retails at $20.00 for an Adobe PDF version.

He looks straight to the artist and is dressed in typical Tudor dress, with a heavy coat, a ruff, and tie tails]]
A '''Hobson's choice''' is a [[free choice]] in which only one thing is offered. Because a person may refuse to accept what is offered, the two options are taking it or taking nothing. In other words, one may "take it or leave it".
The phrase is said to have originated with [[Thomas Hobson]] (1544–1631), a [[livery stable]] owner in [[Cambridge]], England, who offered customers the choice of either taking the horse in his stall nearest to the door or taking none at all.

==Origins==
According to a plaque underneath a painting of Hobson donated to [[Cambridge Guildhall]], Hobson had an extensive stable of some 40 horses. This gave the appearance to his customers that, upon entry, they would have their choice of mounts, when in fact there was only one: Hobson required his customers to choose the horse in the stall closest to the door. This was to prevent the best horses from always being chosen, which would have caused those horses to become overused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waywordradio.org/whats-a-hobsons-choice/ Barrett, Grant. "Hobson's Choice", ''A Way with Words'']&lt;/ref&gt; Hobson's stable was located on land that is now owned by [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.creatingmycambridge.com/history-stories/hobsons-choice/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Ford]] is said to have offered the [[Ford Model&amp;nbsp;T]] as a Hobson's choice with the famous dictum: "Any customer can have a car in any color  as long as it is black."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/hnfrd10.txt | last1 = Ford | first1 = Henry | last2 = Crowther | first2 = Samuel | title = My Life and Work | chapter = IV | isbn = 978-0-7661-2774-6 |origyear = 1922 | year = 2003 | publisher=Kessinger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book |last=Ford |first= Henry |author-link=|year=1922 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title= My Life and Work by Henry Ford in Collaboration with Samuel Crowther |edition=1 |publisher= Doubleday, Page &amp; Company |publication-date=1922 |publication-place=New York |page=72 |url=https://archive.org/stream/mylifework01ford#page/72/mode/2up |accessdate=10 May 2015 |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact,  the car was offered in a [[Ford Model T#Colors|variety of colors]] in the earliest days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Made in America (book)|Made In America]]|author-last=Bryson|author-first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Bryson|isbn=
0-380-71381-0|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ultimatum game]] is a form of Hobson's choice.

===Early appearances in writing===

==Modern use==
The term "Hobson's choice" is often used to mean an illusion of choice, but it is not a choice between two equivalent options, which is a [[Morton's fork]], nor is it a choice between two undesirable options, which is a [[dilemma]]. Hobson's choice is one between something or nothing.

[[John Stuart Mill]], in his book ''[[Considerations on Representative Government]]'', refers to Hobson's choice:

{{quote|When the individuals composing the majority would no longer be reduced to Hobson's choice, of either voting for the person brought forward by their local leaders, or not voting at all.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |author-link=John Stuart Mill|year=1861 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title= Considerations on Representative Government   |edition=1 |publisher= Parker, Son, &amp; Bourn |publication-date=1861 |publication-place=London |page=145 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=emABAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 June 2014 }} via Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In another of his books, ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'', Mill discusses [[marriage]]:

{{quote|Those who attempt to force women into marriage by closing all other doors against them, lay themselves open to a similar retort.  If they mean what they say, their opinion must evidently be, that men do not render the married condition so desirable to women, as to induce them to accept it for its own recommendations. It is not a sign of one's thinking the boon one offers very attractive, when one allows only Hobson's choice, 'that or none'.... And if men are determined that the law of marriage shall be a law of despotism, they are quite right in point of mere policy, in leaving to women only Hobson's choice. But, in that case, all that has been done in the modern world to relax the chain on the minds of women, has been a mistake.  They should have never been allowed to receive a literary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Mill| first =John Stuart| authorlink = John Stuart Mill| coauthors =| title =The Subjection of Women | publisher =Longmans, Green, Reader &amp; Dyer| publication-place = London | edition = 1869 first| year =1869| pages = 51–2 | language = | isbn =| url = https://archive.org/stream/subjectionofwome00millrich#page/50/mode/2up|accessdate= 28 July  2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1951 [[Robert Heinlein]] book ''[[Between Planets]]'', the main character Don Harvey incorrectly mentions he has a Hobson's choice. While on a space station orbiting Earth, Don needs to get to Mars, where his parents are. The only rockets available are back to Earth (where he is not welcome) or on to Venus.

A Hobson's choice is different from:
* [[Dilemma]]: a choice between two or more options, none of which is attractive.
* [[False dilemma]]: only two choices are considered, when in fact there are others.
* [[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]]: a [[logical paradox]] arising from a situation in which an individual needs something that can only be acquired by not being in that very situation.
* [[Morton's fork]], and a [[double bind#Neuro-linguistic programming|double bind]]: choices yield equivalent, and often undesirable, results.
* [[Blackmail]] and [[extortion]]: the choice between paying money (or some non-monetary good or deed) or risk suffering an unpleasant action.

A common error is to use the phrase "Hobbesian choice" instead of "Hobson's choice", confusing the philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] with the relatively obscure [[Thomas Hobson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hobbes|first=Thomas|origyear=1651|year=1982|title=Leviathan, or the Matter, Form, and Power of a Commonwealth, Ecclesiastical and Civil|place=New York|publisher=Viking Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dyzenhaus|first=David|year=2001|title=Hobbes and the Legitimacy of Law|journal=Law and Philosophy|issue=20 (September)|pages=461–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Aloysius Martinich|Martinich]]|first=A.

==Cultural references==
''[[Hobson's Choice (play)|Hobson's Choice]]'' is a full-length stage comedy written by [[Harold Brighouse]] in 1915. At the end of the play, the central character, Henry Horatio Hobson, formerly a wealthy, self-made businessman but now a sick and broken man, faces the unpalatable prospect of being looked after by his daughter Maggie and her husband Will Mossop, who used to be one of Hobson's underlings. His other daughters have refused to take him in, so he has no choice but to accept Maggie's offer which comes with the condition that he must surrender control of his entire business to her and her husband, Will.

The play was adapted for filming several times:
* [[Hobson's Choice (1920 film)]] by [[Percy Nash]]
* [[Hobson's Choice (1931 film)]] by [[Thomas Bentley]]
* [[Hobson's Choice (1954 film)]] by [[David Lean]]
* [[Hobson's Choice (1983 film)]] as a TV movie.

==Law==
In ''[[Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha]]'' (1983), Justice [[Byron White]] dissented and classified the majority's decision to strike down the "one-house veto" as unconstitutional as leaving Congress with a Hobson's choice. Congress may choose between "refrain[ing] from delegating the necessary authority, leaving itself with a hopeless task of writing laws with the requisite specificity to cover endless special circumstances across the entire policy landscape, or in the alternative, to abdicate its lawmaking function to the executive branch and independent agency".

{{quote|text=[T]here was ample support for Blair's view that the [[Sherman Amendment]], by putting municipalities to the Hobson's choice of keeping the peace or paying civil damages, attempted to impose obligations to municipalities by indirection that could not be imposed directly, thereby threatening to "destroy the government of the states".

{{quote|text=The traditional basis for invalidating laws that prohibit the exercise of an obligatory religious practice is that it confronts the adherents with a Hobson's choice between observance of their faith and adherence to the law. There is however more to the protection of religious and cultural practices than saving believers from hard choices.  As stated above, religious and cultural practices are protected because they are central to human identity and hence to human dignity which is in turn central to equality. Are voluntary practices any less a part of a person's identity or do they affect human dignity any less seriously because they are not mandatory?}}

'''''Homo homini lupus''''', or in its unabridged form '''''Homo homini lupus est''''', is a [[Latin proverb]] meaning "A man is a wolf to another man," or more tersely "Man is wolf to man." It has meaning in reference to situations where people are known to have behaved in a way comparably in nature to a [[wolf]]. The wolf as a creature is thought, in this example, to have qualities of being predatory, cruel, inhuman i.e. more like an animal than civilized.

==History==
A variation of the proverb appeared as line 495 in the play ''[[Asinaria]]'' by [[Plautus]]: "''Lupus est homo homini, non homo, quom qualis sit non novit''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Titus Maccius Plautus|author-link=Plautus|title=Asinaria|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/plautus/asinaria.shtml|website=The Latin Library|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[wikiquote:Plautus#Asinaria_.28The_One_With_the_Asses.29|has been translated]] as "Man is no man, but a wolf, to a stranger," or more precisely "A man is a wolf, not a man, to another man which he hasn't met yet."

As a counterpoint, [[Seneca the Younger]] wrote, in his ''[[Epistulae morales ad Lucilium]]'' (specifically, Epistula XCV, paragraph 33), "''homo, sacra res homini''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lucius Annaeus Seneca|author-link=Seneca the Younger|title=Epistulae morales ad Lucilium|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sen/seneca.ep14-15.shtml|website=The Latin Library|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[wikisource:Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 95|has been translated]] as "man, an object of reverence in the eyes of man".

[[Erasmus]] included the proverb in his ''[[Adagia]]'', writing of the variation by Plautus, "Here we are warned not to trust ourselves to an unknown person, but to beware of him as of a wolf."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erasmus|first=Desiderius|author-link=Desiderius Erasmus|year=2001|orig-year=1500-1536|editor-last=Barker|editor-first=William|title=The Adages of Erasmus|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0802048749|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmJn6IFMyicC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SvHxgZrDwC&amp;sig=EOZUjNww1ezfCBfkNQLPZekbB1c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0JSQVbDEMoOwsAWI0oPoBA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher, theologian, and jurist [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (in Latin, Franciscus de Victoria) [[wikisource:De Indis De Jure Belli/Part_2|wrote in one of his ''Relectiones Theologicae'']] that the poet [[Ovid]] disagreed with the proverb: "'Man,' says Ovid, 'is
not a wolf to his fellow man, but a man.'"

[[Thomas Hobbes]] drew upon the proverb in his ''[[De Cive]]'', [[wikisource:De Cive|writing in the dedication]] "To speak impartially, both sayings are very true; That Man to Man is a kind of God; and that Man to Man is an arrant Wolfe. The first is true, if we compare Citizens amongst themselves; and the second, if we compare Cities." Hobbes was describing the tendency of people to act fairly and generously toward other people in the same society and the tendency of societies to act deceptively and violently toward other societies, or [[wikisource: De Cive|as he put it]], "In the one, there's some analogie of similitude with the Deity, to wit, Justice and Charity, the twin-sisters of peace: But in the other, Good men must defend themselves by taking to them for a Sanctuary the two daughters of War, Deceipt and Violence."

[[Sigmund Freud]] agreed with the proverb, writing in his ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'', "Men are not gentle creatures, who want to be loved, who at the most can defend themselves if they are attacked; they are, on the contrary, creatures among whose instinctual endowments is to be reckoned a powerful share of aggressiveness. As a result, their neighbor is for them not only a potential helper or sexual object, but also someone who tempts them to satisfy their aggressiveness on him, to exploit his capacity for work without compensation, to use him sexually without his consent, to seize his possessions, to humiliate him, to cause him pain, to torture and to kill him. ''Homo homini lupus.'' Who in the face of all his experience of life and of history, will have the courage to dispute this assertion?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|author-link=Sigmund Freud|title=Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents, 1930 (excerpt)|url=http://historyguide.org/europe/freud_discontents.html|website=The History Guide|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primatologist and ethologist [[Frans de Waal]] disagreed with the proverb, writing that it "contains two major flaws. First, it fails to do justice to canids, which are among the most gregarious and cooperative animals on the planet (Schleidt and Shalter 2003). But even worse, the saying denies the inherently social nature of our own species."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Waal|first=Frans|author-link=Frans de Waal|year=2006|title=Primates and Philosophers: How Morality Evolved|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691124477|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PccMuO2pcOcC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;1pg=PA3&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI1OW82OnbxgIVEEGICh1KXgTY#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sacco and Vanzetti|Bartolomeo Vanzetti]], after being convicted of murder, along with Nicolo Sacco, in 1927, said that their pending execution would become an emblem "of a cursed past in which man was wolf to the man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/saccov/courtspeech.html|title=Speeches by Sacco and Vanzetti to the Court at the Time of Sentencing|last=Linder|first=Douglas O.|access-date=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:HubbleTuningFork.jpg|thumb|350px|Tuning-fork style diagram of the Hubble sequence]]

Hubble’s scheme divides regular galaxies into three broad classes – [[elliptical galaxy|ellipticals]], [[lenticular galaxy|lenticulars]] and [[spiral galaxy|spirals]] – based on their visual appearance (originally on [[photographic plate]]s). A fourth class contains galaxies with an [[irregular galaxy|irregular]] appearance. To this day, the Hubble sequence is the most commonly used system for classifying galaxies, both in professional astronomical research and in [[amateur astronomy]].

==Classes of galaxies==

===Ellipticals===

[[Image:Abell S740, cropped to ESO 325-G004.jpg|thumb|The giant elliptical galaxy ESO 325-G004.]]
On the left (in the sense that the sequence is usually drawn) lie the [[elliptical galaxy|ellipticals]]. Elliptical galaxies have relatively smooth, featureless light distributions and appear as ellipses in photographic images. They are denoted by the letter E, followed by an integer ''n'' representing their degree of [[Flattening|ellipticity]] in the sky. By convention, ''n'' is ten times the ellipticity of the galaxy, rounded to the nearest integer, where the ellipticity is defined as {{nowrap|''e'' {{=}} 1 − {{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}} for an ellipse with semi-major and semi-minor axes of lengths ''a'' and ''b'' respectively.&lt;ref name="binney_merrifield"&gt;{{cite book |last=Binney |first=J. |authorlink=James Binney |author2=Merrifield, M. |title=Galactic Astronomy |date=1998 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=978-0-691-02565-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ellipticity increases from left to right on the Hubble diagram, with near-circular (E0) galaxies situated on the very left of the diagram. It is important to note that the ellipticity of a galaxy on the sky is only indirectly related to the true 3-dimensional shape (for example, a flattened, discus-shaped galaxy can appear almost round if viewed face-on or highly elliptical if viewed edge-on). Observationally, the most flattened "elliptical" galaxies have ellipticities ''e'' = 0.7 (denoted E7).  However, from studying the light profiles and the ellipticity profiles, rather than just looking at the images, it was realised in the 1960s that the E5–E7 galaxies are probably misclassified lenticular galaxies with large-scale disks seen at various inclinations to our line-of-sight.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Liller (1966), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1966ApJ...146...28L The Distribution of Intensity in Elliptical Galaxies of the Virgo Cluster.

===Lenticulars===
[[Image:Ngc5866 hst big rotated.jpg|thumb|The [[NGC 5866|Spindle Galaxy]] (NGC 5866), a lenticular galaxy with a prominent [[dust lane]] in the [[Draco (constellation)|constellation of Draco]].]]
At the centre of the Hubble tuning fork, where the two spiral-galaxy branches and the elliptical branch join, lies an intermediate class of galaxies known as [[lenticular galaxy|lenticulars]] and given the symbol S0. These galaxies consist of a bright central [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]], similar in appearance to an [[elliptical galaxy]], surrounded by an extended, [[galaxy disk|disk]]-like structure. Unlike [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]], the disks of lenticular galaxies have no visible spiral structure and are not actively forming stars in any significant quantity. 

When simply looking at a galaxy's image, lenticular galaxies with relatively face-on disks are difficult to distinguish from ellipticals of type E0–E3, making the classification of many such galaxies uncertain. When viewed edge-on, the disk becomes more apparent and prominent dust-lanes are sometimes visible in [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] at optical wavelengths.

At the time of the initial publication of Hubble's galaxy classification scheme, the existence of lenticular galaxies was purely hypothetical. Hubble believed that they were necessary as an intermediate stage between the highly flattened "ellipticals" and spirals. Later [[observational astronomy|observations]] (by Hubble himself, among others) showed Hubble's belief to be correct and the S0 class was included in the definitive exposition of the Hubble sequence by [[Allan Sandage]].&lt;ref name="sandage"&gt;{{cite conference |first = A. |last = Sandage |authorlink = Allan Sandage |date = 1975 |title = Classification and Stellar Content of Galaxies Obtained from Direct Photography |booktitle = Galaxies and the Universe |editor = A.

Kristian |url = http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sandage/frames.html |accessdate = 2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Missing from the Hubble sequence are the early-type galaxies with intermediate-scale disks, in between the E and S0 type, Martha Liller denoted them '''ES''' galaxies in 1966.

Lenticular and spiral galaxies, taken together, are often referred to as [[disk galaxy|disk galaxies]].  The bulge-to-disk flux ratio in lenticular galaxies can take on a range of values, just as it does for each of the spiral galaxy morphological types (Sa, Sb, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Graham |first=A. |author2=Worley, C. |date=August 2008 |title=Inclination- and dust-corrected galaxy parameters: bulge-to-disc ratios and size-luminosity relations |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=388 |issue=4 |pages=1708–1728 |bibcode=2008MNRAS.388.1708G |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13506.x|arxiv = 0805.3565 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spirals===
[[Image:M101 hires STScI-PRC2006-10a.jpg|thumb|The [[Pinwheel Galaxy]] (Messier 101/NGC 5457): a spiral galaxy classified as type Scd on the Hubble sequence]]
[[Image:Hubble2005-01-barred-spiral-galaxy-NGC1300.jpg|thumb|right|The barred spiral galaxy [[NGC 1300]]: a type SBbc]]
On the right of the Hubble sequence diagram are two parallel branches encompassing the [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]]. A spiral galaxy consists of a flattened [[galaxy disk|disk]], with [[star]]s forming a (usually two-armed) [[spiral]] structure, and a central concentration of stars known as the [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]]. Roughly half of all spirals are also observed to have a bar-like structure, extending from the central bulge, at the ends of which the spiral arms begin. In the tuning-fork diagram, the regular spirals occupy the upper branch and are denoted by the letter S, while the lower branch contains the barred spirals, given the symbol SB. Both type of spirals are further subdivided according to the detailed appearance of their spiral structures. Membership of one of these subdivisions is indicated by adding a lower-case letter to the morphological type, as follows:
* Sa (SBa) – tightly wound, smooth arms; large, bright central bulge
* Sb (SBb) – less tightly wound spiral arms than Sa (SBa); somewhat fainter bulge
* Sc (SBc) – loosely wound spiral arms, clearly resolved into individual stellar clusters and nebulae; smaller, fainter bulge

Hubble originally described three classes of spiral galaxy. This was extended by [[Gérard de Vaucouleurs]]&lt;ref name="devaucouleurs"&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Vaucouleurs |first=G. |authorlink=Gérard de Vaucouleurs |date=1959 |title=Classification and Morphology of External Galaxies |journal=Handbuch der Physik |volume=53 |pages=275 |bibcode=1959HDP....53..275D |last2=Oemler |first2=Augustus, Jr. |last3=Butcher |first3=Harvey R. |last4=Gunn |first4=James E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to include a fourth class:
* Sd (SBd) – very loosely wound, fragmentary arms; most of the luminosity is in the arms and not the bulge

Although strictly part of the [[Galaxy morphological classification#De Vaucouleurs system|de Vaucouleurs system]] of classification, the Sd class is often included in the Hubble sequence. The basic spiral types can be extended to enable finer distinctions of appearance. For example, spiral galaxies whose appearance is intermediate between two of the above classes are often identified by appending two lower-case letters to the main galaxy type (for example, Sbc for a galaxy that is intermediate between an Sb and an Sc).

Our own [[Milky Way]] is generally classed as SBb or SBc&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hodge (1983), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983PASP...95..721H The Hubble type of the Milky Way Galaxy]&lt;/ref&gt;, making it a barred spiral with well-defined arms. 

Examples of regular spiral galaxies: [[Andromeda Galaxy|M31]] (Andromeda Galaxy), [[Messier 74|M74]], [[Messier 81|M81]], [[Sombrero Galaxy|M104]] (Sombrero Galaxy), [[Whirlpool Galaxy|M51a]] (Whirlpool Galaxy), [[NGC 300]], [[NGC 772]].

Examples of barred spiral galaxies: [[Messier 91|M91]], [[Messier 95|M95]], [[NGC 1097]], [[NGC 1300]], [[NGC1672]], [[NGC 2536]], [[NGC 2903]].

===Irregulars===
[[Image:large.mc.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|The [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] (LMC) - a dwarf [[irregular galaxy]]]]
Galaxies that do not fit into the Hubble sequence, because they have no regular structure (either disk-like or ellipsoidal), are termed [[irregular galaxy|irregular galaxies]]. Hubble defined two classes of irregular galaxy:&lt;ref name="longair"&gt;{{cite book |last=Longair |first=M. S. |authorlink=Malcolm Longair |title=Galaxy Formation |date=1998 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn=3-540-63785-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Irr I galaxies have asymmetric profiles and lack a central bulge or obvious spiral structure; instead they contain many individual clusters of young stars
* Irr II galaxies have smoother, asymmetric appearances and are not clearly resolved into individual stars or stellar clusters
In his extension to the Hubble sequence, de Vaucouleurs called the Irr I galaxies 'Magellanic irregulars', after the [[Magellanic Clouds]] – two satellites of the Milky Way which Hubble classified as Irr I. The discovery of a faint spiral structure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Vaucouleurs |first=G. |authorlink=Gérard de Vaucouleurs |date=1955 |title=Studies of Magellanic Clouds. I. Dimensions and structure of the Large Cloud |journal=The Astronomical Journal |volume=160 |pages=126–140 |bibcode=1955AJ.....60..126D |doi=10.1086/107173 |last2=Oemler |first2=Augustus, Jr. |last3=Butcher |first3=Harvey R. |last4=Gunn |first4=James E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] led de Vaucouleurs to further divide the irregular galaxies into those that, like the LMC, show some evidence for spiral structure (these are given the symbol Sm) and those that have no obvious structure, such as the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]] (denoted Im). In the extended Hubble sequence, the Magellanic irregulars are usually placed at the end of the spiral branch of the Hubble tuning fork.

Examples of irregular galaxies: [[Messier 82|M82]], [[NGC 1427A]], [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], [[Small Magellanic Cloud]].

==Physical significance==

Elliptical and lenticular galaxies are commonly referred to together as “early-type” galaxies, while spirals and irregular galaxies are referred to as “late types”. This nomenclature is the source of the common,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baldry |first=I. K. |date=2008 |title=Hubble's Galaxy Nomenclature |journal=Astronomy &amp; Geophysics |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=5.25 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-4004.2008.49525.x |bibcode=2008A&amp;G....49e..25B|arxiv = 0809.0125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but erroneous, belief that the Hubble sequence was intended to reflect a supposed [[evolution (term)|evolutionary]] sequence, from [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] through [[lenticular galaxy|lenticulars]] to either [[barred spiral galaxy|barred]] or [[spiral galaxy|regular spirals]]. In fact, Hubble was clear from the beginning that no such interpretation was implied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The nomenclature, it is emphasized, refers to position in the sequence, and temporal connotations are made at one's peril. The entire classification is purely empirical and without prejudice to theories of evolution...&lt;ref name="hubble27"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hubble |first=E. P. |authorlink=Edwin Hubble |date=1927 |title=The Classification of Spiral Nebulae |journal=The Observatory |volume=50 |pages=276 |bibcode=1927Obs....50..276H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The evolutionary picture appears to be lent weight by the fact that the disks of spiral galaxies are observed to be home to many young [[star]]s and regions of active [[star formation]], while elliptical galaxies are composed of predominantly old stellar populations. In fact, current evidence suggests the opposite: the early Universe appears to be dominated by spiral and irregular galaxies. In the currently favored picture of [[galaxy formation]], present-day ellipticals formed as a result of mergers between these earlier building blocks; while some lenticular galaxies may have formed this way, others may have accreted their disks around pre-existing spheroids.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Alister W.; Dullo, Bililign T.; Savorgnan, Giulia A. D. (2015), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...804...32G Hiding in Plain Sight: An Abundance of Compact Massive Spheroids in the Local Universe]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some lenticular galaxies may also be evolved spiral galaxies, whose gas has been stripped away leaving no fuel for continued star formation&lt;ref name="ChristensenMartin2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lars Lindberg Christensen|author2=Davide de Martin|author3=Raquel Yumi Shida|title=Cosmic Collisions: The Hubble Atlas of Merging Galaxies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QhRAokTI2RYC&amp;pg=PA24|date=7 April 2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-93855-4|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although the galaxy [[LEDA 2108986]] opens the debate on this.


==Shortcomings==

A common criticism of the Hubble scheme is that the criteria for assigning galaxies to classes are subjective, leading to different observers assigning galaxies to different classes (although experienced observers usually agree to within less than a single Hubble type).&lt;ref name=dressler_et_al&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dressler|first=A. |last2=Oemler, Jr.|first2=A. |last3=Butcher|first3=H. R. |last4=Gunn|first4=J. E. |date=July 1994 |title=The morphology of distant cluster galaxies. 1: HST observations of CL 0939+4713 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=430 |issue=1 |pages=107–120 |bibcode=1994ApJ...430..107D | doi = 10.1086/174386}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lahav, O., et al. (1995), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995Sci...267..859L Galaxies, Human Eyes, and Artificial Neural Networks]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although not really a short-coming, since the 1961 Hubble Atlas of Galaxies, the primary criteria used to assign the morphological type (a, b, c, etc.) has been the nature of the spiral arms, rather than the bulge-to-disk flux ratio, and thus a range of flux ratios exist for each morphological type&lt;ref&gt;Allan Sandage (1961), [The Hubble Atlas of Galaxies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vorontsov-Vel'Yaminov, B. A.; Arkhipova, V. P. (1962), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1962MCG...C01....0V Morphological catalogue of galaxies. Part 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vorontsov-Vel'Yaminov, B. A.; Noskova, R. I. (1973) [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1973SvA....16..824V Photometric Parameters of Flat Galaxies.]&lt;/ref&gt;, as with the lenticular galaxies.

Another criticism of the Hubble classification scheme is that, being based on the appearance of a galaxy in a two-dimensional image, the classes are only indirectly related to the true physical properties of galaxies. In particular, problems arise because of [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]] effects. The same galaxy would look very different, if viewed edge-on, as opposed to a face-on or ‘broadside’ viewpoint.  As such, the early-type sequence is poorly represented: the ES galaxies are missing from the Hubble sequence, and the E5–E7 galaxies are actually S0 galaxies.  Furthermore, the barred ES and barred S0 galaxies are also absent.

Visual classifications are also less reliable for faint or distant galaxies, and the appearance of galaxies can change depending on the [[wavelength]] of light in which they are observed.

Nonetheless, the Hubble sequence is still commonly used in the field of [[extragalactic astronomy]] and Hubble types are known to correlate with many physically relevant properties of galaxies, such as [[Luminosity|luminosities]], colours, masses (of stars and gas) and star formation rates.&lt;ref name=roberts_haynes&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=M.

In [[ring theory]], a branch of [[abstract algebra]], an '''ideal''' is a special [[subset]] of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. Ideals generalize certain subsets of the [[integer]]s, such as the [[even numbers]] or the multiples of 3. Addition and subtraction of even numbers preserves evenness, and multiplying an even number by any other integer results in another even number;  these [[Closure (mathematics)|closure]] and absorption properties are the defining properties of an ideal.  An ideal can be used to construct a [[quotient ring]] similarly to the way that, in [[group theory]], a [[normal subgroup]] can be used to construct a [[quotient group]].

Among the integers, the ideals correspond one-for-one with the [[non-negative integer]]s: in this ring, every ideal is a [[principal ideal]] consisting of the multiples of a single non-negative number. However, in other rings, the ideals may be distinct from the ring elements, and certain properties of integers, when generalized to rings, attach more naturally to the ideals than to the elements of the ring. For instance, the [[prime ideal]]s of a ring are analogous to [[prime number]]s, and the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] can be generalized to ideals.  There is a version of [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic|unique prime factorization]] for the ideals of a [[Dedekind domain]] (a type of ring important in [[number theory]]).

The concept of an [[order ideal]] in [[order theory]] is derived from the notion of ideal in ring theory. A [[fractional ideal]] is a generalization of an ideal, and the usual ideals are sometimes called '''integral ideals''' for clarity.

== History ==
Ideals were first proposed by [[Richard Dedekind]] in 1876 in the third edition of his book ''[[Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie]]'' (English: ''Lectures on Number Theory''). They were a generalization of the concept of [[ideal number]]s developed by [[Ernst Kummer]].&lt;ref name="flt"&gt;{{cite book

| title = An introduction to number theory
| year = 2005
| page = 83
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later the concept was expanded by [[David Hilbert]] and especially [[Emmy Noether]].

== Definitions ==
For an arbitrary ring &lt;math&gt;(R,+,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;(R,+)&lt;/math&gt; be its [[additive group]]. A subset &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''two-sided ideal''' (or simply an '''ideal''') of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; if it is an additive subgroup of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; that "absorbs multiplication by elements of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;." Formally we mean that &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal if it satisfies the following conditions:

# &lt;math&gt;(I,+)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[subgroup]] of &lt;math&gt;(R,+)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in I, \forall r \in R :\quad x \cdot r, r \cdot x \in I &lt;/math&gt;
Equivalently, an ideal of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a sub-&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-[[bimodule]] of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

A subset &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''right ideal''' of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;See Hazewinkel et al. (2004), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; if it is an additive subgroup of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and absorbs multiplication on the right, that is:
# &lt;math&gt;(I,+)&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;(R,+)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in I, \forall r \in R: \quad x \cdot r \in I.&lt;/math&gt;
Equivalently, a right ideal of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a right &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-[[module (mathematics)|submodule]] of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly a subset &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''left ideal''' of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; if it is an additive subgroup of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; absorbing multiplication on the left:
# &lt;math&gt;(I,+)&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;(R, +)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in I, \forall r \in R: \quad r \cdot x \in I.&lt;/math&gt;
Equivalently, a left ideal of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a left &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-submodule of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

In all cases, the first condition can be replaced by the following well-known criterion that ensures a nonempty subset of a group is a subgroup:

:1'. &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is [[empty set|non-empty]] and &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y \in I: x - y \in I&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, since &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be [[unital ring|unital]], it suffices that &lt;math&gt;x + y&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, since the second condition implies that &lt;math&gt;-y&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The left ideals in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are exactly the right ideals in the [[opposite ring]] &lt;math&gt;R^o&lt;/math&gt; and vice versa.

A two-sided ideal is a left ideal that is also a right ideal, and is often called an ideal except to emphasize that there might exist single-sided ideals. When &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a commutative ring, the definitions of left, right, and two-sided ideal coincide, and the term ''ideal'' is used alone.

== Properties ==

{0} and ''R'' are ideals in every ring ''R''. If ''R'' is a [[division ring]] or a [[Field (mathematics)|field]], then these are its only ideals. The ideal ''R'' is called the '''unit ideal'''.  Any ideal ''I'' is a '''proper ideal''' if it is a proper subset of ''R'', that is, if ''I'' does not equal ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lang|2005|loc=Section III.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as [[normal subgroup]]s of groups are [[Kernel (algebra)|kernels]] of group [[homomorphisms]], ideals have interpretations as kernels. For a nonempty subset ''A'' of ''R'': 
* ''A'' is an ideal of ''R'' if and only if it is a kernel of a ring homomorphism from ''R''.
* ''A'' is a right ideal of ''R'' if and only if it is a kernel of a homomorphism from the right ''R'' module ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; to another right ''R'' module.
* ''A'' is a left ideal of ''R'' if and only if it is a kernel of a homomorphism from the left ''R'' module &lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' to another left ''R'' module.

If ''p'' is in ''R'', then ''pR'' is a right ideal and ''Rp'' is a left ideal of ''R''. These are called, respectively, the [[Principal ideal|principal]] right and left ideals generated by ''p''. To remember which is which, note that right ideals are [[invariant (mathematics)#Invariant set|stable under]] right-multiplication (''IR''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''I'') and left ideals are stable under left-multiplication (''RI''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''I'').

The connection between [[coset]]s and ideals can be seen by switching the operation from "multiplication" to "addition".

== Motivation ==
Ideals &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are in some sense a generalisation of the set of multiples of an integer. That is, &lt;math&gt;n\mathbb{Z}\subset\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively, the definition can be motivated as follows: Suppose we have a subset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and that we would like to obtain a ring with the same structure as &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, except that the elements of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; should be zero (they are in some sense "negligible").

But if &lt;math&gt;s_1=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_2=0&lt;/math&gt; in our new ring, then surely &lt;math&gt;s_1+s_2&lt;/math&gt; should be zero too, and &lt;math&gt;r s_1&lt;/math&gt; as well as &lt;math&gt;s_1 r&lt;/math&gt; should be zero for ''any'' element &lt;math&gt;r \in R&lt;/math&gt; (zero or not).

The definition of an ideal is such that the ideal &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; generated (see below) by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is exactly the set of elements that are forced to become zero if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; becomes zero, and the [[quotient ring]] &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt; is the desired ring where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is zero, and ''only'' elements that are forced by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to be zero are zero. The requirement that &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt; should have the same structure (except that &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; becomes zero) is formalized by the condition that the projection from &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt; is a (surjective) [[ring homomorphism]].

The quintessential example is when &lt;math&gt;R=\mathbb{Z},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S=\{n\}&lt;/math&gt; for some nonzero &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. By "considering &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; to be zero", we are essentially reducing elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; to their remainder after dividing by n. Thus &lt;math&gt;I=n\mathbb{Z}=\{...,-2n,-n,0,n,2n,...\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R/I=\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}=\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; is the set of possible remainders after dividing an integer by n (ie. the [[cyclic group]] of order n).

== Examples ==
* In a ring ''R'', the set ''R'' itself forms an ideal of ''R''. Also, the subset containing only the additive identity 0&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; forms an ideal. These two ideals are usually referred to as the ''trivial ideals'' of ''R''.
* The even [[integer]]s form an ideal in the ring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; of all integers; it is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;2\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. This is because the sum of any even integers is even, and the product of any integer with an even integer is also even. Similarly, the set of all integers divisible by a fixed integer ''n'' is an ideal denoted &lt;math&gt;n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The set of all [[polynomial]]s with real coefficients which are divisible by the polynomial ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 is an ideal in the ring of all polynomials.
* The set of all ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] whose last row is zero forms a right ideal in the ring of all ''n''-by-''n'' matrices. It is not a left ideal. The set of all ''n''-by-''n'' matrices whose last ''column'' is zero forms a left ideal but not a right ideal.
* The ring &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; of all [[continuous function]]s ''f'' from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; under [[pointwise multiplication]] contains the ideal of all continuous functions ''f'' such that ''f''(1) = 0. Another ideal in &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; is given by those functions which vanish for large enough arguments, i.e. those continuous functions ''f'' for which there exists a number ''L'' &gt; 0 such that ''f''(''x'') = 0 whenever |''x''| &gt; ''L''.
* [[Compact operator]]s form an ideal in the ring of [[bounded operators]].

== Ideal generated by a set ==
Let ''R'' be a (possibly not unital) ring. Any intersection of any nonempty family of left ideals of ''R'' is again a left ideal of ''R''. If ''X'' is any subset of ''R'', then the intersection of all left ideals of ''R'' containing ''X'' is a left ideal ''I'' of ''R'' containing ''X'', and is clearly the smallest left ideal to do so. This ideal ''I'' is said to be the left ideal '''[[generating set of a module|generated]]''' by ''X''. Similar definitions can be created by using right ideals or two-sided ideals in place of left ideals.

If ''R'' has unity, then the left, right, or two-sided ideal of ''R'' generated by a subset ''X'' of ''R'' can be expressed internally as we will now describe. The following set is a left ideal:
:&lt;math&gt;\{r_1x_1+\dots+r_nx_n \mid n\in\mathbb{N}, r_i\in R, x_i\in X\}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Each element described would have to be in every left ideal containing ''X'', so this left ideal is in fact the left ideal generated by ''X''. The right ideal and ideal generated by ''X'' can also be expressed in the same way:
:&lt;math&gt;\{x_1r_1+\dots+x_nr_n \mid n\in\mathbb{N}, r_i\in R, x_i\in X\}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\{r_1x_1s_1+\dots+r_nx_ns_n \mid n\in\mathbb{N}, r_i\in R,s_i\in R, x_i\in X\}.\,&lt;/math&gt;
The former is the right ideal generated by ''X'', and the latter is the ideal generated by ''X''.

By convention, 0 is viewed as the [[empty sum|sum of zero such terms]], agreeing with the fact that the ideal of ''R'' generated by ∅ is {0} by the previous definition.

If a left ideal ''I'' of ''R'' has a finite subset ''F'' such that ''I'' is the left ideal  generated by ''F'', then the left ideal ''I'' is said to be [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]]. Similar terms are also applied to right ideals and two-sided ideals generated by finite subsets.

In the special case where the set ''X'' is just a singleton {''a''} for some ''a'' in ''R'', then the above definitions turn into the following:

:&lt;math&gt;Ra=\{ra \mid r\in R\}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;aR=\{ar \mid  r\in R\}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;RaR=\{r_1as_1+\dots+r_nas_n \mid n\in\mathbb{N}, r_i\in R,s_i\in R\}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

These ideals are known as the left/right/two-sided [[principal ideal]]s generated by ''a''. It is also very common to denote the two-sided ideal generated by ''a'' as (''a'').

If ''R'' does not have a unit, then the internal descriptions above must be modified slightly. In addition to the finite sums of products of things in ''X'' with things in ''R'', we must allow the addition of ''n''-fold sums of the form ''x''+''x''+...+''x'', and ''n''-fold sums of the form (''−x'')+(''−x'')+...+(''−x'') for every ''x'' in ''X'' and every ''n'' in the natural numbers. When ''R'' has a unit, this extra requirement becomes superfluous.

=== Example ===
* In the ring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; of integers, every ideal can be generated by a single number (so &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[principal ideal domain]]), and the only two generators of ''pR'' are ''p'' and ''−p''. The concepts of "ideal" and "number" are therefore almost identical in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. If ''aR''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''bR'' in an arbitrary domain, then ''au''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'' for some [[invertible element|unit]] ''u''. Conversely, for any unit ''u'', ''aR''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''auu''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''auR''. So, in a commutative principal ideal domain, the generators of the ideal ''aR'' are just the elements ''au'' where ''u'' is an arbitrary unit. This explains the case of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; since 1 and −1 are the only units of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Types of ideals ==
* '''[[Factor Ideal]]''': Suppose that '''R''' is a ring and that '''I''' is a (two-sided) ideal of '''R'''. Then we can use '''R''' and '''I''' to create a new ring, called "the factor ring of '''R''' modulo '''I'''". This ring is denoted '''R'''/'''I''', and its elements are certain subsets of '''R''' associated to '''I'''. The most well known examples are the rings '''Z'''/n'''Z''', created from the ring '''Z''' of integers and its ideals.

''To simplify the description all rings are assumed to be commutative. The non-commutative case is discussed in detail in the respective articles.''

Ideals are important because they appear as kernels of ring homomorphisms and allow one to define [[factor ring]]s. Different types of ideals are studied because they can be used to construct different types of factor rings.

* '''[[Maximal ideal]]''': A proper ideal ''I'' is called a '''maximal ideal''' if there exists no other proper ideal ''J'' with ''I'' a proper subset of ''J''.  The factor ring of a maximal ideal is a [[simple ring]] in general and is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] for commutative rings.&lt;ref&gt;Because simple commutative rings are fields. See {{cite book|author=Lam|year=2001|title=A First Course in Noncommutative Rings|url={{Google books|plainurl=y|id=f15FyZuZ3-4C|page=39|text=simple commutative rings}}|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Minimal ideal]]''': A nonzero ideal is called minimal if it contains no other nonzero ideal.
* '''[[Prime ideal]]''': A proper ideal ''I'' is called a '''prime ideal''' if for any ''a'' and ''b'' in ''R'', if ''ab'' is in ''I'', then at least one of ''a'' and ''b'' is in ''I''. The factor ring of a prime ideal is a [[prime ring]] in general and is an [[integral domain]] for commutative rings.
* '''[[Radical of an ideal|Radical ideal]]''' or [[semiprime ideal]]: A proper ideal ''I'' is called '''radical''' or '''semiprime''' if for any ''a'' in ''R'', if ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is in ''I'' for some ''n'', then ''a'' is in ''I''. The factor ring of a radical ideal is a [[semiprime ring]] for general rings, and is a [[reduced ring]] for commutative rings.
* '''[[Primary ideal]]''': An ideal ''I'' is called a '''primary ideal''' if for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''R'', if ''ab'' is in ''I'', then at least one of ''a'' and ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is in ''I'' for some [[natural number]] ''n''. Every prime ideal is primary, but not conversely. A semiprime primary ideal is prime.
* '''[[Principal ideal]]''': An ideal generated by ''one'' element.
* '''Finitely generated ideal''': This type of ideal is [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] as a module.
* '''[[Primitive ideal]]''': A left primitive ideal is the [[Annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] of a [[simple module|simple]] left [[module (mathematics)|module]].  A right primitive ideal is defined similarly.  Actually (despite the name) the left and right primitive ideals are always two-sided ideals. Primitive ideals are prime. A factor rings constructed with a right (left) primitive ideals is a right (left) [[primitive ring]]. For commutative rings the primitive ideals are maximal, and so commutative primitive rings are all fields.
* '''[[Irreducible ideal]]''': An ideal is said to be irreducible if it cannot be written as an intersection of ideals which properly contain it.
* '''Comaximal ideals''': Two ideals &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{i}, \mathfrak{j}&lt;/math&gt; are said to be '''comaximal''' if &lt;math&gt;x + y = 1&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathfrak{j}&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''[[Regular ideal]]''': This term has multiple uses. See the article for a list.
* '''[[Nil ideal]]''':  An ideal is a nil ideal if each of its elements is nilpotent.

Two other important terms using "ideal" are not always ideals of their ring. See their respective articles for details:
*'''[[Fractional ideal]]''': This is usually defined when ''R'' is a commutative domain with [[quotient field]] ''K''. Despite their names, fractional ideals are ''R'' submodules of ''K'' with a special property. If the fractional ideal is contained entirely in ''R'', then it is truly an ideal of ''R''.
*'''[[Invertible ideal]]''': Usually an invertible ideal ''A'' is defined as a fractional ideal for which there is another fractional ideal ''B'' such that ''AB''=''BA''=''R''. Some authors may also apply "invertible ideal" to ordinary ring ideals ''A'' and ''B'' with ''AB''=''BA''=''R'' in rings other than domains.

== Further properties ==
* In rings with identity, an ideal is proper ''if and only if'' it does not contain 1 or equivalently it does not contain a unit.
* The set of ideals of any ring are [[partially ordered set|partially ordered]] via [[subset|subset inclusion]], in fact they are additionally a [[complete lattice|complete]] [[modular lattice]] in this order with [[join (lattice theory)|join operation]] given by addition of ideals and [[meet (lattice theory)|meet operation]] given by set intersection. The trivial ideals supply the least and greatest elements: the largest ideal is the entire ring, and the smallest ideal is the zero ideal. The lattice is not, in general, a [[distributive lattice]].
* Unfortunately [[Zorn's lemma]] does not necessarily apply to the collection of proper ideals of ''R''. However, when ''R'' has identity 1, this collection can be reexpressed as "the collection of ideals which do not contain 1". It can be checked that Zorn's lemma now applies to this collection, and consequently there are maximal proper ideals of ''R''. With a little more work, it can be shown that every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal. See ''[[Krull's theorem]]'' at [[maximal ideal]].
* The ring ''R'' can be considered as a left module over itself, and the left ideals of ''R'' are then seen as the [[submodule]]s of this module. Similarly, the right ideals are submodules of ''R'' as a right module over itself, and the two-sided ideals are submodules of ''R'' as a [[bimodule]] over itself. If ''R'' is commutative, then all three sorts of module are the same, just as all three sorts of ideal are the same.
* Every ideal is a [[pseudo-ring]].
* The ideals of a ring form a [[semiring]] (with identity element ''R'') under addition and multiplication of ideals.

== Ideal operations ==
The sum and product of ideals are defined as follows. For  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{b}&lt;/math&gt;, ideals of a ring R,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{b}:=\{a+b \mid a \in \mathfrak{a} \mbox{ and } b \in \mathfrak{b}\}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a} \mathfrak{b}:=\{a_1b_1+ \dots + a_nb_n \mid a_i \in \mathfrak{a} \mbox{ and } b_i \in \mathfrak{b}, i=1, 2, \dots, n; \mbox{ for } n=1, 2, \dots\},&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. the product of two ideals &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{b}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the ideal &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}\mathfrak{b}&lt;/math&gt; generated by all products of the form ''ab'' with ''a'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; and ''b'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{b}&lt;/math&gt;. The product &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}\mathfrak{b}&lt;/math&gt; is [[subset|contained in]] the intersection of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{b}&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{b}&lt;/math&gt; is also the intersection of all ideals containing both &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{b}&lt;/math&gt;.

The sum and the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of ideals is again an ideal; with these two operations as join and meet, the set of all ideals of a given ring forms a [[complete lattice|complete]] [[modular lattice]].  Also, the [[union (set theory)|union]] of two ideals is a subset of the sum of those two ideals, because for any element ''a'' inside an ideal, we can write it as ''a''+0, or 0+''a''; therefore, it is contained in the sum as well. However, the union of two ideals is not necessarily an ideal; rather, the sum is the ideal generated by the union.

The three operations of intersection, sum (or join), and product make the set of ideals of a commutative ring into a [[quantale]].

== Examples of ideal operations ==
In &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; we have
:&lt;math&gt;(n)\cap(m) = \text{lcm}(n,m)\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
since &lt;math&gt;(n)\cap(m)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of integers which are divisible by both &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;R = \mathbb{C}[x,y,z,w]&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;I = (z, w),\text{ }J = (x+z,y+w),\text{ }K = (x+z, w)&lt;/math&gt;. Then,
* &lt;math&gt;I + J = (z,w, x+z, y+w) = (x, y, z, w)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I + K = (z, w, x + z)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;IJ = (z(x + z), z(y + w), w(x + z), w(y + w))= (z^2 + xz, zy + wz, wx + wz, wy + w^2)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;IK = (xz + z^2, zw, xw + zw, w^2)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;I \cap J = IJ&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;I \cap K = (w, xz + z^2) \neq IK&lt;/math&gt;
In the first computation, we see the general pattern for taking the sum of two finitely generated ideals, it is the ideal generated by the union of their generators. In the last three we observe that products and intersections agree whenever the two ideals intersect in the zero ideal. These computations can be checked using [[Macaulay 2|Macaulay2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/doc/Macaulay2-1.9.2/share/doc/Macaulay2/Macaulay2Doc/html/_ideals.html|title=ideals|website=www.math.uiuc.edu|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/doc/Macaulay2-1.9.2/share/doc/Macaulay2/Macaulay2Doc/html/_sums_cm_spproducts_cm_spand_sppowers_spof_spideals.html|title=sums, products, and powers of ideals|website=www.math.uiuc.edu|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/doc/Macaulay2-1.9.2/share/doc/Macaulay2/Macaulay2Doc/html/_intersection_spof_spideals.html|title=intersection of ideals|website=www.math.uiuc.edu|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideals and congruence relations ==
There is a bijective correspondence between ideals and [[congruence relation]]s (equivalence relations that respect the ring structure) on the ring:

Given an ideal ''I'' of a ring ''R'', let ''x'' ~ ''y'' if ''x'' − ''y'' ∈ ''I''.  Then ~ is a congruence relation on ''R''.

Conversely, given a congruence relation ~ on ''R'', let ''I'' = {''x'' : ''x'' ~ 0}.  Then ''I'' is an ideal of ''R''.

The '''International IUPAC Conferences on Green Chemistry''' (ICGCs) gather several hundreds scientists, technologists, and experts from all over the world with the aim to exchange and disseminate new ideas, discoveries, and projects on [[green chemistry]] and a [[sustainable development]]. After mid twentieth century, an increasingly general consensus acknowledges that these subjects play a unique role in mapping the way ahead for the humankind progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sdgoverview/post-2015-development-agenda.html|title=Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical topics discussed in these IUPAC Conferences are: 
* bio-based [[Renewable resource|renewable chemical resources]], bio-inspired materials and [[nanomaterials]], bio-based [[polymer]]s; 
* polymer composites and natural surfactants;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00221139/177|title=C. Pigliacelli, A. D'Elicio, R. Milani, G. Terraneo, G.

== History ==

In 2006 the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) promoted the organization of the 1st International IUPAC Conference on Green-Sustainable Chemistry (ICGC-1). This conference, started in collaboration with the [[Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker|German Chemical Society]] (GDCh), was a major acknowledgement by IUPAC of the relevance of green chemistry. The Special Topic Issue on Green Chemistry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/72/7/|title=''Pure Appl. Chem.'' 2000, 72(7), 1207-1403}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Pure and Applied Chemistry'' and the starting of a [https://iupac.org/who-we-are/committees/committee-details/?body_code=303 Subcommittee on Green Chemistry,]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iupac.org/nc/home/about/members-and-committees/db/division-committee.html?tx_wfqbe_pi1%5Btitle%5D=Subcommittee%20on%20Green%20Chemistry&amp;tx_wfqbe_pi1%5Bpublicid%5D=303|title=Division III, Subcommittee on Green Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; operating in the IUPAC Division of Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry, were two important landmarks towards that acknowledgement. 
ICGC-1 registered the presence of over 450 participants from 42 countries and proceedings were published in ''[https://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/conferences/family/ICGC/index.html Pure and Applied Chemistry]''. This Conference then became a biannual appointment that continuously attracted several hundreds scientists and technologists from academia, research institutes, and industries.

On 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of July 2017, IUPAC established the '''[https://iupac.org/body/041 Interdivisional Committee on Green Chemistry for Sustainable Development ICGCSD]''' that supersedes the former Subcommittee on Green Chemistry and has the aim to assist IUPAC in initiating, promoting, and coordinating the work of the Union in the area of green and sustainable chemistry. 

ICGCSD will continue to organize the ICGCs Series. The next 8th Conference will take place in Bangkok, Thailand, in September 2018.

== Biography and career ==

Paul graduated from [[Antioch College]] in [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]] in 1990 with a B.A. in [[chemistry]]. Before going to graduate school, Paul corresponded with a number of philosophers about their work, including [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]] and [[Lynne Rudder Baker]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/05/opportunity-cost.html "Opportunity Cost: Marginal Revolution"]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, Paul graduated from [[Princeton University]] with a Ph.D in [[philosophy]], where she wrote a [[Thesis|dissertation]] titled ''Essays on Causation'' &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Essays_on_Causation.html?id=NrfltgAACAAJ '"Essays on Causation"]&lt;/ref&gt; under the supervision of [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/05/new-apps-interview-la-paul.html "New APPS Interview: LA Paul"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul taught at [[Yale University]] from 1999 to 2001, and at the [[University of Arizona]] from 2001 until 2008, before moving to North Carolina.  She has also held appointments at the [[Australian National University]] and at the [[University of St. Andrews]].

She is married to sociologist [[Kieran Healy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2008/08/23/189128/mereological_update/ "Think Progress: Matthew Yglesias"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical work ==

Paul's principal research interests are in [[metaphysics]] and the [[philosophy of mind]]. Her work focuses on causation, [[mereology]], the philosophy of [[time]], and related topics in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the [[philosophy of science]], and [[philosophy of language]]. Her work in [[ontology]] and mereology develops a distinctive view of objects as fusions of property instances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Metaphysics.html?id=0vGzcQAACAAJ "Metaphysics: 5 Questions (Interview with LA Paul)"]&lt;/ref&gt; Her article "What You Can't Expect When You're Expecting" develops the notion of transformative experience and explores its consequences for the possibility of rational decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2013/03/11/173977133/is-having-a-child-a-rational-decision "Tania Lombrozo, Is Having a Child a Rational Decision? (NPR)"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/apr/06/this-column-change-life-transformative-experiences "Oliver Burkeman, This Column Will Change Your Life (The Guardian)"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2013/04/graduate-school-advice-impossible-decision.html "Joshua Rothman, The Impossible Decision (The New Yorker)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

She has written more than twenty articles, and is the editor of ''Causation and Counterfactuals'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/causation-and-counterfactuals "Causation And Counterfactuals"] MIT Press, {{ISBN|978-0-26253-2563}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-author of ''Causation: A User's Guide'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199673445.do#.UIniW7Rpfls "Causation: A User's Guide"] Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-967345-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and author of ''Transformative Experience.''&lt;ref&gt;http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198717959.do&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guglielmo Marconi]] enunciated at one time an [[empirical law]] that, for [[radio transmitter|simple vertical sending]] and [[radio receiver|receiving antennas]] of equal height, the maximum working [[radio telegraphy|telegraphic]] distance varied as the square of the height of the antenna. It has been stated that the rule was tested in experiments made on [[Salisbury Plain]] in 1897, and also by experiments made by Italian [[naval officer]]s on behalf of the [[Royal Italian Navy]] in 1900 and 1901. [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] [[Quintino Bonomo]] gave a report of these experiments in an official report.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Description==
{{expand section|date=December 2010}}
&lt;!-- Need the equation put in here --&gt;

If ''H'' is the height (i.e. the length) of the antenna and ''D'' the maximum signalling distance, then we have, according to ''Marconi's law''
: &lt;math&gt;H = c \sqrt{D}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''c'' is some constant.

''Marconi's law'' can be deduced theoretically as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, J. A. (1906). The principles of electric wave telegraphy. London: Longmans, Green, and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Heinrich Hertz|Hertz]] has shown that distances large compared with its length the magnetic force of a linear oscillator varies inversely as the distance. The maximum value of the current set up in any given receiving antenna varies as its length, also as the magnetic force of the waves incident on it, and as the maximum value of the current in the transmitting antenna. Hence, if &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic force of the waves incident on a receiving antenna of height H, and if &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the sending and receiving antenna, and if &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_2&lt;/math&gt; are the maximum values of the currents in the sending and receiving antennæ, we have—

&lt;math&gt;M \propto \frac{I_1}{D}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_2 \propto MH&lt;/math&gt;

Hence &lt;math&gt;I_2 \propto \frac{I_2H}{D}&lt;/math&gt;

Also, since for a given charging voltage the current &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt; in the sending antenna varies very nearly as its capacity—that is, as its height—and if the sending antenna has the same height, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, as the receiving aerial, we have—

&lt;math&gt;I_1 \propto H&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;I_2 \propto \frac{I_1H}{D}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore &lt;math&gt;I_2 \propto \frac{H^2}{D} \propto&lt;/math&gt; some constant

For any given receiving apparatus a certain constant minimum value of the maximum current in the receiving antenna is necessary to cause a signal. Therefore it follows that, with given receiving and sending apparatus, we must have &lt;math&gt;\frac{H^2}{D}&lt;/math&gt; a constant, or—

&lt;math&gt;H = c \sqrt{D}&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the maximum signalling distance with given apparatus will vary as the square of the height of the antenna.

The above law is, however, much interfered with by the nature of the surface over which the propagation takes place.

{{Semiotics}}

In [[semiotics]], the '''meaning''' of a sign is its place in a [[sign relation]], in other words, the set of roles that it occupies within a given sign relation.  

This statement holds whether ''sign'' is taken to mean a ''sign type'' or a ''sign token''.  Defined in these global terms, the meaning of a sign is not in general analyzable with full exactness into completely localized terms, but aspects of its meaning can be given approximate analyses, and special cases of sign relations frequently admit of more local analyses.

Two aspects of meaning that may be given approximate analyses are the ''connotative relation'' and the ''denotative relation''.  The connotative relation is the relation between signs and their interpretant signs.  The denotative relation is the relation between signs and objects. An arbitrary association exists between the ''signified'' and the ''signifier.''
For example, a US salesperson doing business in [[Etiquette in Japan|Japan]] might interpret [[silence]] following an offer as rejection, while to Japanese negotiators silence means the offer is being considered. This difference in interpretations represents a difference in: semiotics

==Triadic relation==
The triadic (three part) model of the sign separates the meaning of a sign into three distinct components:

1.The representamen, which is the medium, or ‘sign vehicle’,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Summer 2013|title = Peirce's Theory of Signs|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/peirce-semiotics/|date = 2013-01-01|first = Albert|last = Atkin|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; through which the sign is represented. For example, this could be written/spoken words, a photograph, or a painting.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Semiotics: The Basics|last = Chandler|first = Daniel|publisher = Routledge|year = 2002|isbn = 0-415-35111-1|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2.The interpretant, or what is meant by the sign &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

3. The object, or that to which the sign refers &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Together, these three components generate [[semiosis]]. For example, an exclamation mark can be broken down into these components. The representamen is the exclamation mark itself, the interpretant is the idea of excitement or an elevated volume of speech, and the object is the actual excitement or elevated volume of speech to which it refers.
While it might appear that the latter two are the same, the subtle difference lies in the fact that the interpretant refers to the idea of something, and the object is the thing itself.

The representamen component of the sign can be further broken down into three categories, which are icon, index, and symbol.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These denote the degree of abstraction from the object to which they refer. A symbol, which is the most abstract, does not resemble or bear any physical relation to the thing that it represents in any way. For example, a peace sign has no relation to peace aside from its social construction as a symbol that represents it. An icon is slightly less abstract, and resembles to some degree the thing that it represents, and bears some physical likeness to it. A good example of this would be a painted portrait. An index is the least arbitrary category of representamen, and has a definite physical tie to that which it represents. This could be something like a weather vane blowing in the wind indicating that it is windy out, or smoke, which indicates a fire.

The triadic model of the sign was proposed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]]. In contradistinction to [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s dyadic model, which assumed no material referent, Peirce's model assumes that in order for a sign to be meaningful, it must refer to something external and cannot be self-contained, as it is for Saussure. Thus, Peirce's model includes the addition of an 'object'. The ‘representamen’ and ‘interpretant’ components of the triadic model are comparable to Saussure’s dyadic model of the sign, which breaks down into signifier and signified.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''Meyer v. Nebraska''''', 262 U.S. 390 (1923),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Meyer v. Nebraska|262|390|1923}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case that held that a 1919 [[Nebraska]] law restricting foreign-language education violated the [[Due Process]] clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].

==Context and legislation==
[[World War I]] witnessed an extensive [[Anti-German sentiment#United States|campaign against all things German]], such as the performance of German music at symphony concerts and the meetings of German-American civic associations. Language was a principal focus of legislation at the state and local level. It took many forms, from requiring associations to have charters written in English to a ban on the use of German within the town limits. Some states banned foreign language instruction, while a few banned only German. Some extended their bans into private instruction and even to religious education. A bill to create a Department of Education at the federal level was introduced in October 1918, designed to restrict federal funds to states that enforced English-only education. An internal battle over conducting services and religious instruction in German divided the Lutheran churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Capozzola |title=Uncle Sam Wants You: World War I and the Making of the Modern American Citizen |location=NY |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2008 |pages=176–85, 190–3 |isbn=978-0-19-533549-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 9, 1919, Nebraska enacted a statute called "An act relating to the teaching of foreign languages in the state of Nebraska," commonly known as the Siman Act. It imposed restrictions on both the use of a foreign language as a medium of instruction and on foreign languages as a subject of study. With respect to the use of a foreign language while teaching, it provided that "No person, individually or as a teacher, shall, in any private, denominational, parochial or public school, teach any subject to any person in any language other than the English language." With respect to foreign-language education, it prohibited instruction of children who had yet to successfully complete the eighth grade.

==Facts and arguments==
On May 25, 1920, Robert T. Meyer, while an instructor in Zion Parochial School, a one-room schoolhouse in [[Hampton, Nebraska]], taught the subject of reading in the [[German language]] to 10-year-old Raymond Parpart, a fourth-grader.   The Hamilton County Attorney entered the classroom and discovered Parpart reading from the Bible in German. He charged Meyer with violating the Siman Act.&lt;ref name=capozzola94&gt;Capolzzola, 194&lt;/ref&gt;

Meyer was tried and convicted in the district court for [[Hamilton County, Nebraska|Hamilton County]], was and fined $25 USD (about ${{Inflation|US|25|1920}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars). The [[Nebraska Supreme Court]] affirmed his conviction by a vote of 4 to 2. The majority thought the law a proper response to "the baneful effects" of allowing immigrants to educate their children in their mother tongue, with results "inimical to our own safety." The dissent called the Siman Act the work of "crowd psychology."&lt;ref name=capozzola94 /&gt;

Meyer appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. His lead attorney was Arthur Mullen, an Irish Catholic and a prominent Democrat, who had earlier failed in his attempt to obtain an injunction against enforcement of the Siman Act from the Nebraska State Supreme Court. Oral arguments expressed conflicting interpretations of the World War I experience. Mullen attributed the law to "hatred, national bigotry and racial prejudice engendered by the World War." Opposing counsel countered that "it is the ambition of the State to have its entire population 100 per cent. American."&lt;ref&gt;Capozzola, 195&lt;/ref&gt;

==Majority opinion==
In his decision, [[James Clark McReynolds|Justice McReynolds]] stated that the "liberty" protected by the Due Process clause "[w]ithout doubt...denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men."

Analyzing in that context the liberty of the teacher and of parents with respect to their children, McReynolds wrote: "Practically, education of the young is only possible in schools conducted by especially qualified persons who devote themselves thereto. The calling always has been regarded as useful and honorable, essential, indeed, to the public welfare. Mere knowledge of the German language cannot reasonably be regarded as harmful. Heretofore it has been commonly looked upon as helpful and desirable. Plaintiff in error taught this language in school as part of his occupation. His right thus to teach and the right of parents to engage him so to instruct their children, we think, are within the liberty of the amendment." And further: "Evidently the Legislature has attempted materially to interfere with the calling of modern language teachers, with the opportunities of pupils to acquire knowledge, and with the power of parents to control the education of their own."

And finally: "That the state may do much, go very far, indeed, in order to improve the quality of its citizens, physically, mentally and morally, is clear; but the individual has certain fundamental rights which must be respected. The protection of the Constitution extends to all, to those who speak other languages as well as to those born with English on the tongue. Perhaps it would be highly advantageous if all had ready understanding of our ordinary speech, but this cannot be coerced by methods which conflict with the Constitution&amp;#8203;—&amp;#8203;a desirable end cannot be promoted by prohibited means."

He allowed that wartime circumstances might justify a different understanding, but that Nebraska had not demonstrated sufficient need "in time of peace and domestic tranquility" to justify "the consequent infringement of rights long freely enjoyed."

==Dissent==
Justices [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] and [[George Sutherland]] dissented. Their dissenting opinion, written by Holmes, is found in the companion case of ''[[Bartels v. State of Iowa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Bartels v. State of Iowa|link=|volume=262|page=404|pin=|year=1923}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes wrote that he differed with the majority "with hesitation and unwillingness" because he thought the law did not impose an undue restriction on the liberty of the teacher since it was not arbitrary, was limited in its application to the teaching of children, and the State had areas where many children might hear only a language other than English spoken at home. "I think I appreciate the objection to the law, but it appears to me to present a question upon which men reasonably might differ and therefore I am unable to say the Constitution of the United States prevents the experiment being tried."

==In later jurisprudence==

''Meyer'', along with ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'' (1925), is often cited as one of the first instances in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] engaged in [[substantive due process]] in the area of [[civil liberties]]. [[Laurence Tribe]] has called them "the two sturdiest pillars of the substantive due process temple". He noted that the decisions in these cases did not describe specific acts as constitutionally protected but a broader area of liberty: "[they] described what they were protecting from the standardizing hand of the state in language that spoke of the family as a center of value-formation and value-transmission...the authority of parents to make basic choices" and not just controlling the subjects one's child is taught.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lawrence |last=Tribe |title=''Lawrence v. Texas'': The 'Fundamental Right' That Dare Not Speak Its Name |journal=[[Harvard Law Review]] |volume=117 |issue=6 |year=2004 |pages=1893–1955 [p. 1934] |jstor=4093306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Substantive due process has since been used as the basis for many far-reaching decisions of the Court, including ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', and ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''. [[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]] speculated in 2000 that both of those cases might have been written differently nowadays: "''Pierce'' and ''Meyer'', had they been decided in recent times, may well have been grounded upon First Amendment principles protecting freedom of speech, belief, and religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Troxel v. Granville|link=|volume=530|page=57|pin=|year=2000|dissent=Kennedy }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Burning-14.jpg|thumb|300px|Preparing to burn a witch in 1544. [[Witch-hunt]]s are an example of mass behavior fueled by moral panic.]]

A '''moral panic''' is a feeling of [[fear]] spread among a large number of people that some [[evil]] threatens the well-being of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panics and Mass Hysteria|url=https://sites.google.com/site/formsofcollectivebehavior/panics-and-mass-hysteria|website=FormsOfCollectiveBehavior|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Jones&gt;see also: Jones, M, and E.  Jones. (1999). ''Mass Media.'' London: Macmillan Press&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Dictionary of Sociology'' defines a moral panic as "the process of arousing social concern over an issue – usually the work of [[moral entrepreneur]]s and the [[mass media]]".&lt;ref name=Oxford_Uni&gt;{{Citation | contribution = M: Moral panic | editor-last = Scott | editor-first = John | editor-link = John Scott (sociologist) | title = A dictionary of sociology | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | page = 492 | location = Oxford New York | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780199683581 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=2zr_AwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover Book preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The media are key players in the dissemination of moral indignation, even when they do not appear to be consciously engaged in [[crusading]] or [[Muckraker|muckraking]]. Simply reporting the facts can be enough to generate concern, anxiety, or panic.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]] states that moral panic happens when "a condition, episode, person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to societal values and interests." Examples of moral panic include the belief in widespread abduction of children by predatory [[pedophilia|paedophiles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hesselink-Louw | first1 = Anne | last2 = Olivier | first2 = Karen | year = 2001 | title = A criminological analysis of crimes against disabled children: the adult male sexual offender | url = | journal = CARSA | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 15–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520262065 |title=Sex Panic and the Punitive State |last=Lancaster |first=Roger |publisher=University of California Press |year=2011 |isbn=9780520262065 |location=Berkeley |pages=4, 33–34, 76–79.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Extein&gt;{{cite news |last1=Extein |first1=Andrew |title=Fear the Bogeyman: Sex Offender Panic on Halloween |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrew-extein-msw/fear-the-bogeyman-sex-off_b_4161136.html |accessdate=26 November 2014 |work=Huffington Post |date=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; belief in [[Satanic ritual abuse|ritual abuse of women and children by satanic cults]],&lt;ref name="Goode"&gt;{{cite book |title=Moral Panics: The Social Construction of Deviance |last2=Ben-Yehuda |first2=Nachman |publisher=Blackwell |year=2009 |isbn=9781405189347 |edition=2nd |location=Oxford |pages=57–65 |author-link2=Nachman Ben-Yehuda |last1=Goode |first1=Erich |author-link1=Erich Goode |origyear=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[War on Drugs]],&lt;ref name="DR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thersa.org/action-research-centre/current-projects/drugs-commission/drugs-report |title=Drugs Report |date=March 2007 |publisher=[[Royal Society of Arts]] Action and Research Centre |accessdate=24 November 2014}} [http://www.rsadrugscommission.org.uk/pdf/RSA_Drugs_Report.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[public health]] issues.

== Use as a social science term ==
[[Marshall McLuhan]] gave the term academic treatment in his book ''[[Understanding Media]]'', written in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McLuhan | first = Marshall | author-link = Marshall McLuhan | title = [[Understanding Media|Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]] | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1994 }} {{ISBN|9780262631594}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stanley Cohen, author of a sociological study about youth culture and media called ''Folk Devils and Moral Panics'' (1972),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hayes | first1 = Hennessey | last2 = Prenzler | first2 = Tim | title = Introduction to Crime and Criminology | publisher = Pearson Australia | location = Frenchs Forest, New South Wales | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781442545243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a moral panic occurs when "...[a] condition, episode, person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to [[society|societal values]] and interests".&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;{{cite book | last = Cohen | first = Stanley | author-link = Stanley Cohen (sociologist) | title = Folk Devils and Moral Panics: The Creation of the Mods and Rockers | doi=10.4324/9780203828250 | url=https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203828250 | isbn= 9781138834743 | publisher = Paladin | year = 1973 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who start the panic when they fear a threat to prevailing social or [[cultural]] values are known by researchers as '[[moral entrepreneur]]s', while people who supposedly threaten the social order have been described as '[[folk devil]]s'.

===British vs. American===
Many sociologists have pointed out the differences between definitions of a ''moral panic'' as described by American versus British sociologists. In addition to pointing out other sociologists who note the distinction, Kenneth Thompson has characterized the difference as American sociologists tending to emphasize psychological factors while the British portray "moral panics" as [[crisis of capitalism|crises of capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Thompson | first1 = Kenneth | contribution = The History and Meaning of the Concept | editor-last = Critcher | editor-first = Chas | title = Critical Readings: Moral Panics and the Media | publisher = Open University Press | pages = 60–66 | location = Maidenhead England New York | year = 2006 | origyear = 1998 | isbn = 9780335218073 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = Kenneth | title = Moral Panics | publisher = Routledge | location = London &amp; New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780415119771 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

British criminologist [[Jock Young]] used the term in his participant observation study of drug taking in [[Porthmadog]] between 1967 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Young | first1 = Jock | author-link1 = Jock Young | contribution = The role of the police as amplifiers of deviance | editor-last = Cohen | editor-first = Stanley | editor-link = Stanley Cohen (sociologist) | title = Images of Deviance | publisher = Penguin | pages = | location = Harmondsworth | year = 1971 | isbn = 9780140212938 }}; {{cite book | last = Young | first = Jock | title = The Drugtakers: The Social Meaning of Drug Use | publisher = MacGibbon and Kee | location = London | year = 1971 | isbn = 9780261632400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Policing the Crisis: Mugging, the State and Law and Order'' (1978), [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] and his colleagues studied the public reaction to the phenomenon of [[robbery|mugging]] and the perception that it had recently been imported from American culture into the UK. Employing Cohen's definition of 'moral panic', Hall ''et al.'' theorized that the "...rising crime rate equation..." performs an ideological function relating to [[social control]]. [[Crime statistics]], in Hall's view, are often manipulated for political and economic purposes; moral panics could thereby be ignited to create public support for the need to "...police the crisis".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hall | first1 = Stuart | author-link1 = Stuart Hall (cultural theorist) | title = Policing the Crisis: Mugging, the State and Law and Order | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York | year = 2013 | origyear = 1978 | isbn = 9781137007186 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cohen's stages of moral panic==
According to [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]],&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; who seems to have borrowed the term from Marshall McLuhan (see above), there are five key stages in the construction of a moral panic:
#Someone, something or a group are defined as a threat to social norms or community interests
#The threat is then depicted in a simple and recognizable symbol/form by the media
#The portrayal of this symbol rouses public concern
#There is a response from authorities and policy makers
#The moral panic over the issue results in social changes within the community

In 1971 Stanley Cohen investigated a series of "moral panics". Cohen used the term "moral panic" to characterize the reactions of the media, the public, and agents of social control to youth disturbances.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; This work, involving the [[Mods and rockers|Mods and Rockers]], demonstrated how agents of social control amplified deviance. According to Cohen, these groups were labeled as being outside the central core values of consensual society and as posing a threat to both the values of society and society itself, hence the term "folk devils".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Donna |last1=Killingbeck |year=2001 |title=The role of television news in the construction of school violence as a 'moral panic' |journal=Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=186–202 |url=http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol8is3/killingbeck.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more recent edition of ''Folk Devils and Moral Panics,'' Cohen outlines some of the criticisms that have arisen in response to moral panic theory. One of these is of the term "panic" itself, as it has connotations of irrationality and a lack of control. Cohen maintains that "panic" is a suitable term when used as an extended metaphor.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;

==Mass media==
According to Stanley Cohen in ''Folk Devils and Moral Panics'', the concept of "moral panic" was linked to certain assumptions about the mass media.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; Stanley Cohen showed that the mass media are the primary source of the public's knowledge about deviance and social problems. He further argued that moral panic gives rise to the folk devil by labeling actions and people.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;

According to Cohen, the media appear in any or all three roles in moral panic dramas:&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;
* Setting the agenda – selecting deviant or socially problematic events deemed as newsworthy, then using finer filters to select which events are candidates for moral panic.
* Transmitting the images – transmitting the claims by using the rhetoric of moral panics.
* Breaking the silence and making the claim.

==Characteristics==
Moral panics have several distinct features. According to Goode and Ben-Yehuda, moral panic consists of the following characteristics:&lt;ref name=Goode/&gt;
* Concern – There must be the belief that the behaviour of the group or activity deemed deviant is likely to have a negative effect on society.
* Hostility  – Hostility toward the group in question increases, and they become "folk devils". A clear division forms between "them" and "us".
* Consensus – Though concern does not have to be nationwide, there must be widespread acceptance that the group in question poses a very real threat to society. It is important at this stage that the "moral entrepreneurs" are vocal and the "folk devils" appear weak and disorganized.
* Disproportionality – The action taken is disproportionate to the actual threat posed by the accused group.
* Volatility – Moral panics are highly volatile and tend to disappear as quickly as they appeared because public interest wanes or news reports change to another narrative.&lt;ref name = Jones/&gt;

==Examples==
&lt;!-- Note: Please do not make NEW ADDITIONS to this section unless you have a reference that cites the incident or phenomenon as an EXAMPLE OF A MORAL PANIC. --&gt;

===20th–21st century: public health===
The fear of disease (or fear of threats to [[public health]]) and spread of panic dates back many centuries and continues into the 21st century with diseases such as [[AIDS]], [[Ebola]], [[H1N1]], [[Zika]], and [[SARS]]. Cohen's idea of the "folk devil"&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; and epidemics can be compared because of their role in spreading mass panic and fear. The intense concentration on hygiene emerged, before the 20th century, with a medical belief referred to as [[miasma theory]], which states that disease was the direct result of the polluting emanations of filth: sewer gas, garbage fumes, and stenches that polluted air and water, which results in an epidemic. The [[Great Stink]] of 1858 was blamed on miasma, along with reoccurring [[cholera]] epidemics during the [[Victorian era]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halliday|first=Stephen|date=22 December 2001|title=Death and miasma in Victorian London: an obstinate belief|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume=323|issue=7327|pages=1469–1471|issn=0959-8138|pmc=1121911|pmid=11751359|doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7327.1469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the water was safe to drink in most parts of London, such a panic had arisen that very few people would dare drink the water.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== 1950s: switchblades ===
In the United States, a 1950 article titled "The Toy That Kills" in the ''Women's Home Companion'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pollack, Jack H., ''The Toy That Kills'', 77 Women's Home Companion Magazine 38, November 1950&lt;/ref&gt; about automatic knives, or "[[switchblade]]s", sparked a storm of controversy, further fed by highly popular films of the late 1950s including ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', ''[[Crime in the Streets]]'', ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'', ''[[The Delinquents (1957 film)|The Delinquents]]'', ''[[High School Confidential (film)|High School Confidential]]'', and the 1957 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]''. Fixation on the switchblade as the symbol of youth violence, sex, and delinquency resulted in demands from the public and Congress to control the sale and possession of such knives.&lt;ref name="TWFK"&gt;{{Citation | surname=Dick | given=Steven| title=The Working Folding Knife | year=1997| publisher= Stoeger Publishing Company |ISBN= 978-0-88317-210-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LEV"&gt;Levine, Bernard R., ''[http://www.knife-expert.com/schr-pb.txt The Switchblade Menace]'', OKCA Newsletter (1993): Rep. [[Sidney R. Yates]] (D) of Illinois was convinced of a sadistic connection, proclaiming that "vicious fantasies of omnipotence, idolatry...barbaric and sadistic atrocities, and monstrous violations of accepted values spring from [switchblades]&amp;nbsp;... Minus switchblade knives and the distorted feeling of power they beget—power that is swaggering, reckless, and itching to express itself in violence—our delinquent adolescents would be shorn of one of their most potent means of incitement to crime".&lt;/ref&gt; State laws restricting or criminalizing switchblade possession and use were adopted by an increasing number of state legislatures, and many of the [[Switchblade#Legality|restrictive laws around them]] worldwide date back to this period.

=== 1970s–present: increase in crime ===
Research shows that fear of increasing crime is often the cause of moral panics.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goode 2009 217"&gt;{{cite book |title=Moral Panics: The Social Construction of Deviance |last2=Ben-Yehuda |first2=Nachman |publisher=Blackwell |year=2009 |isbn=9781405189347 |edition=2nd |location=Oxford |page=217 |author-link2=Nachman Ben-Yehuda |last1=Goode |first1=Erich |author-link1=Erich Goode |origyear=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byron, Reginald; Molidor, William; Cantu, Andrew (2018).

The Howard Journal of Crime and Justice. 57(2): 250-277. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hojo.12257&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have shown that despite declining crime rates, this phenomenon, which often taps into a population's "[[herd mentality]]", continues to occur in various cultures. Japanese jurist [[:ja:浜井浩一|Koichi Hamai]] explains how the changes in crime recording in Japan since the 1990s caused people to believe that the crime rate was rising and that crimes were getting increasingly severe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koichi |first=Hamai |date=October 2004 |title=How 'the myth of collapsing safe society' has been created in Japan: beyond the moral panic and victim industry (rising fear of crime and re-building safe society in Japan: moral panic or evidence-based crime control) |url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006153656/ |journal=Japanese Journal of Sociological Criminology |publisher=NII Scholarly Services |issue=29 |pages=4–93 |postscript=.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s–present: video games and violence===
{{main|Video game controversy}}

There have been calls to regulate violence in [[video game]]s for nearly as long as the video game industry has existed, with ''[[Death Race (1976 video game)|Death Race]]'' a notable early example.&lt;ref name="byrd"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=Summer 2007 |title=Comment: It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt: the effectiveness of proposed video-game legislation on reducing violence in children |url=http://www.houstonlawreview.org/archive/downloads/44-2_pdf/5_Byrd.pdf |journal=Houston Law Review |publisher=Houston Law Foundation |last1=Byrd |first1=Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kocurek"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koucurek |first=Carly |date=September 2012 |title=The Agony and the Exidy: A History of Video Game Violence and the Legacy of Death Race |url=http://gamestudies.org/1201/articles/carly_kocurek |volume=12 |issue=1 |work=Game Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, however, improvements in video game technology allowed for more lifelike depictions of violence in games like ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' and ''[[Doom (game)|Doom]]''. The industry attracted controversy over violent content and concerns about [[influence of mass media|effects]] they might have on players, generating frequent media stories drawing connections between video games and violent behavior as well as a number of academic studies reporting conflicting findings about the strength of correlations.&lt;ref name="byrd" /&gt; According to Christopher Ferguson, sensationalist media reports and the scientific community unintentionally worked together in "promoting an unreasonable fear of violent video games".&lt;ref name="scotus"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2013 |title=Violent video games and the Supreme Court: Lessons for the scientific community in the wake of Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association |journal=American Psychologist |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=57–74 |doi=10.1037/a0030597 |pmid=23421606 |last1=Ferguson |first1=Christopher J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns from parts of the public about violent games led to cautionary, often exaggerated news stories, warnings from politicians and other public figures, and calls for research to prove the connection, which in turn led to studies "speaking beyond the available data and allowing the promulgation of extreme claims without the usual scientific caution and skepticism."&lt;ref name="scotus" /&gt;

Since the 1990s, there have been attempts to regulate violent video games in the United States through congressional bills as well as within the industry.&lt;ref name="byrd" /&gt; Public concern and media coverage of violent video games reached a high point following the [[Columbine High School massacre]] in 1999, after which videos were found of the perpetrators talking about violent games like ''Doom'' and making comparisons between the acts they intended to carry out and aspects of games.&lt;ref name="byrd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scotus" /&gt;

Ferguson and others have explained the video game moral panic as part of a cycle that all new media go through.&lt;ref name="scotus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fergusonapa"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2010 |title=Blazing angels or resident evil? Can violent video games be a force for good? |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=68 |doi=10.1037/a0018941 |last1=Ferguson |first1=Christopher J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jpr"&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Coulson |first2=Mark |last3=Barnett |first3=Jane |year=2011 |title=A meta-analysis of pathological gaming prevalence and comorbidity with mental health, academic and social problems |journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research |volume=45 |issue=12 |pages=1573 |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2011.09.005 |pmid=21925683 |last1=Ferguson |first1=Christopher J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that legally restricting sales of video games to minors would be unconstitutional and called the research presented in favor of regulation "unpersuasive".&lt;ref name="scotus" /&gt;

===1970s–present: war on drugs===

Some critics have pointed to moral panic as an explanation for the [[War on Drugs]]. For example, a [[Royal Society of Arts]] commission concluded that "the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]] ... is driven more by 'moral panic' than by a practical desire to reduce harm."&lt;ref name="DR" /&gt;

Some have written that one of the many rungs supporting the moral panic behind the war on drugs was a separate but related moral panic, which peaked in the late 1990s, involving media's gross exaggeration of the [[Date rape drug#Media coverage|frequency of the surreptitious use of date rape drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Synthetic Panics: The Symbolic Politics of Designer Drugs |last=Jenkins |first=Philip |publisher=New York University Press |year=1999 |isbn=9780814742440 |location=New York, New York |pages=20 and 161–182 |author-link=Philip Jenkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goode 2009 217" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Psychology &amp; Crime |last=Webber |first=Craig |publisher=Sage |year=2010 |isbn=9781412919425 |location=Los Angeles &amp; London |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; News media have been criticized for advocating "grossly excessive protective measures for women, particularly in coverage between 1996 and 1998," for overstating the threat and for excessively dwelling on the topic.&lt;ref name="Goode 2009 217" /&gt; For example, a 2009 Australian study found that drug panel tests were unable to detect any drug in any of the 97 instances of patients admitted to the hospital believing their drinks might have been spiked.&lt;ref name="Quigley 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Lynch |first2=Dania M. |last3=Little |first3=Mark |last4=Murray |first4=Lindsay |last5=Lynch |first5=Ann-Maree |last6=O'Halloran |first6=Sean J. |year=2009 |title=Prospective study of 101 patients with suspected drink spiking |journal=Emergency Medicine Australasia |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=222 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-6723.2009.01185.x |pmid=19527282 |last1=Quigley |first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s–1990s: ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''===
{{main|Dungeons &amp; Dragons controversies}}
At various times, ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' and other [[tabletop role-playing game]]s have been accused of promoting such practices as [[Satanism]], [[witchcraft]], [[suicide]], [[pornography]] and [[murder]]. In the 1980s and later, some groups, especially [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] Christian groups, accused the games of encouraging interest in [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and the veneration of [[demon]]s.&lt;ref name="panic"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2005 |title=Role-Playing Games and the Christian Right: Community Formation in Response to a Moral Panic |journal=The Journal of Religion and Popular Culture |volume=9 |pages=3 |doi=10.3138/jrpc.9.1.003 |last1=Waldron |first1=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many of these criticisms have been aimed specifically at ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', they touch on the genre of [[fantasy]] [[roleplaying game]]s as a whole.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Also known as the "satanic panic", this was a series of moral panics regarding Satanic ritual abuse that originated in the United States and spread to other English-speaking countries in the 1980s and 1990s, and led to a string of wrongful convictions.&lt;ref name="Goode" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{cite book |title=Moral Panic: Changing Concepts of the Child Molester in Modern America |last=Jenkins |first=Philip |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1998 |isbn=9780300109634 |location=New Haven, Connecticut |pages=207–231 |author-link=Philip Jenkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Satanic Panic: The Creation of a Contemporary Legend |last=Victor |first=Jeffrey S. |publisher=[[Open Court Publishing Company]] |year=1993 |isbn=9780812691917 |location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Day Care Ritual Abuse Moral Panic |last=Young |first=Mary |publisher=McFarland |year=2004 |isbn=9780786418305 |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |authorlink=Mary de Young}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980s–present: HIV/AIDS ===

[[HIV/AIDS|Acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS) may lead to or exacerbate other health conditions such as [[pneumonia]], [[fungal infection]]s, [[tuberculosis]], [[toxoplasmosis]], and [[cytomegalovirus]]. A meeting of the [[British Sociological Association]]'s South West and Wales Study entitled "AIDS: The Latest Moral Panic" was prompted by the growing interest of medical sociologists in [[AIDS]], as well as that of UK health care professionals working in the field of health education. It took place at a time when both groups were beginning to voice an increased concern with the growing media attention and [[Fearmongering|fear-mongering]] that AIDS was attracting.&lt;ref name="ATLMP"&gt;Gilligan, J. H., and Coxon, A. P. M. (eds.), 1985, ''AIDS: The Latest Moral Panic, Occasional Paper No 11'', December, The School of Social Studies, University College of Swansea{{page needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, a moral panic was created within the media over HIV/AIDS. In Britain the notable iceberg advert by the government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pemberton |first1=Max |title=HIV/Aids treatment has come a long way - in the West |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/sexual-health-and-advice/9715372/HIVAids-treatment-has-come-a-long-way-in-the-West.html |accessdate=14 June 2017 |work=The Telegraph |date=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; clearly hinted that the public was uninformed about HIV/AIDS due to a lack of publicly assessable and accurate information.

The media outlets nicknamed HIV/AIDS the "gay plague", causing further stigmatization and misunderstandings about the disease. However, scientists gained a far better understanding of HIV/AIDS as it grew in the 1980s and moved into the 1990s and beyond. The illness was still negatively viewed by many as either caused by, or passed on through, the gay community. Once it became clear that this wasn't the case, the moral panic created by the media changed to blaming the overall negligence of ethical standards of the younger generation (both male and female), resulting in another moral panic. It is prevalent in the media{{Clarify|reason=Vague usage of the word "it"|date=March 2017}} and the way HIV/AIDS is depicted taken from this extract, "British TV and press coverage is locked into an agenda which blocks out any approach to the subject which does not conform in advance to the values and language of a profoundly homophobic culture-a culture that is which does not regard gay men as fully or properly human. No distinction obtains for the agenda between 'quality' and 'tabloid' newspapers, or between 'popular' and 'serious' television."&lt;ref&gt;Aggleton, P., Davies, P., &amp; Hart, G. (1992). ''AIDS: Rights, Risk, and Reason''. London: Falmer Press. {{ISBN|9780750700405}}{{page needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, blame shifted to "uncivilized Africans" as the new "folk devils", with a popular theory alleging that HIV originated from humans having sex with [[simian]]s. This theory was debunked by numerous experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Did AIDS come from having sex with monkeys? | date = 25 November 1998 | author = Rick Sowadsky | url = http://www.thebody.com/Forums/AIDS/SafeSex/Q8781.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1990s–present: sex offenders ===

The media narrative of a [[sex offender]] highlighting egregious offenses as typical behavior of any sex offender, and media distorting the facts of some cases,&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2012 |title=Incurable Sex Offenders, Lousy Judges &amp; the Media: Moral Panic Sustenance in the Age of New Media |journal=American Journal of Criminal Justice |volume=38|pages=160 |doi=10.1007/s12103-012-9154-6 |last1=Fox |first1=Kathryn J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; has led legislators to attack [[judicial discretion]],&lt;ref name="Fox" /&gt; making sex offender registration mandatory based on certain listed offenses rather than individual risk or the actual severity of the crime, thus practically catching less serious offenders under the domain of harsh sex offender laws.

In the 1990s and 2000s, there have been instances of moral panics in the UK and the US related to colloquial uses of the term [[pedophilia]] to refer to such unusual crimes as high-profile cases of [[child abduction]].&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt;

=== 2000–present: human trafficking ===

Many critics of contemporary anti-prostitution activism argue that much of the current concern about [[human trafficking]] and its more general conflation with [[prostitution]] and other forms of [[sex work]] have all the hallmarks of a moral panic. They further argue that this moral panic shares much in common with the '[[Human trafficking|white slavery]]' panic of a century earlier as prompted passage of the 1910 [[Mann Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12147-999-0021-9 |pmid=12296110 |title=Loose women or lost women?

=== 2016–present: suicide communities ===
The so-called "[[Blue Whale (game)|Blue Whale]]" hypothetical communities encouraging minors to commit suicide in alternative reality game form. As with many other moral panics, this one may have been started with an article in a newspaper. Some people consider it as a hoax with the objective to increase approval to [[Internet censorship]] in societies. Some governments have taken legislative actions strengthening internet censorship and introducing new [[felony|felonies]] in the wake of the panic.

==Criticism==
Paul Joosse (2017) has argued that while classic moral panic theory styled itself as being part of the 'sceptical revolution' that sought to critique structural functionalism, it is actually very similar to [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]]'s depiction of how the collective conscience is strengthened through its reactions to deviance (in Cohen's case, for example, 'right-thinkers' use folk devils to strengthen societal orthodoxies). In his analysis of [[Donald Trump]]'s 2016 electoral victory, Joosse reimagines moral panic in [[Max Weber|Weberian]] terms, showing how charismatic moral entrepreneurs can at once deride folk devils in the traditional sense while avoiding the conservative moral recapitulation that classic moral panic theory predicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bjc/azx047 |title=Expanding Moral Panic Theory to Include the Agency of Charismatic Entrepreneurs |journal=British Journal of Criminology |last1=Joosse |first1=Paul |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism is that of disproportionality. The problem with this argument is that there is no way to measure what a proportionate reaction should be to a specific action.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;{{rp|xxvi–xxxi}} Jarrett Thibodeaux (2014) further argues that the criteria of disproportionality erroneously assumes that a social problem ''should'' correspond with some objective criteria of harm. The idea that a social problem should correspond with some objective criteria of harm, but is a moral panic when it does not, is a 'constructionism of the gaps' line of explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0038038513511560 |title=Three Versions of Constructionism and their Reliance on Social Conditions in Social Problems Research |journal=Sociology |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=829 |year=2014 |last1=Thibodeaux |first1=J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1995 about the moral panic that arose in the UK after a series of murders by juveniles, chiefly that of two-year-old [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]] by two ten-year-old boys but also including that of 70-year-old [[Murder of Edna Phillips|Edna Phillips]] by two 17-year-old girls, the sociologist [[Colin Hay (political scientist)|Colin Hay]] pointed out that the folk devil was ambiguous in such cases; the child perpetrators would normally be thought of as innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Colin |last=Hay |authorlink=Colin Hay (political scientist) |title=Mobilization Through Interpellation: James Bulger, Juvenile Crime and the Construction of a Moral Panic |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/096466399500400203 |journal=Social &amp; Legal Studies |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=197–223 |year=1995 |doi=10.1177/096466399500400203 }} Cited in {{cite book |first=Alan |last=Hunt |contribution=Fractious Rivals? Moral Panics and Moral Regulation |title=Moral Panic and the Politics of Anxiety |editor-first=Sean Patrick |editor-last=Hier |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=2011 |isbn=9780415555555 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HLyTgaErBZ8C&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Rethinking 'moral panic' for multi-mediated social worlds", [[Angela McRobbie]] and [[Sarah Thornton]] argue "that it is now time that every stage in the process of constructing a moral panic, as well as the social relations which support it, should be revised." Their argument is that mass media has changed since the concept of moral panic emerged so "that 'folk devils' are less marginalized than they once were", and that 'folk devils' are not only castigated by mass media but supported and defended by it as well. They also suggest that the "points of social control" that moral panics used to rest on "have undergone some degree of shift, if not transformation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/591571 |jstor=591571 |title=Rethinking 'Moral Panic' for Multi-Mediated Social Worlds |journal=The British Journal of Sociology |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=559 |year=1995 |last1=McRobbie |first1=Angela |last2=Thornton |first2=Sarah L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British criminologist Yvonne Jewkes has also raised issue with the term 'morality', how it is accepted unproblematically in the concept of 'moral panic' and how most research into moral panics fails to approach the term critically but instead accepts it at face value.&lt;ref name = Jewkes1&gt;{{citation | last = Jewkes | first = Yvonne | contribution = Media and moral panics | editor-last = Jewkes | editor-first = Yvonne | title = Media &amp; Crime | publisher = SAGE | pages = 76–77 | location = London &amp; Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2011 | origyear = 2004 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781848607033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewkes goes on to argue that the thesis and the way it has been used fails to distinguish between crimes that quite rightly offend human morality, and thus elicit a justifiable reaction, and those that demonise minorities. The public are not sufficiently gullible to keep accepting the latter and allowing themselves to be manipulated by the media and the government.&lt;ref name="Jewkes1"/&gt;

Another British criminologist, Steve Hall, goes a step further to suggest that the term 'moral panic' is a fundamental category error. Hall argues that although some crimes are sensationalized by the media, in the general structure of the crime/control narrative the ability of the existing state and criminal justice system to protect the public is also overstated. Public concern is whipped up only for the purpose of being soothed, which produces not panic but the opposite, comfort and complacency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall |first=S. |year=2012 |title=Theorizing Crime and Deviance: A New Perspective |location=London |publisher=Sage |pages=132–139 |isbn=9781848606722 |url=https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/theorizing-crime-and-deviance/book233792#description}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Echoing another point Hall makes, the sociologists Thompson and Williams argue that the concept of 'moral panic' is not a rational response to the phenomenon of social reaction, but itself a product of the irrational middle-class fear of the imagined working-class 'mob'. Using as an example a peaceful and lawful protest staged by local mothers against the re-housing of sex-offenders on their estate, Thompson and Williams show how the sensationalist demonization of the protesters by moral panic theorists and the liberal press was just as irrational as the demonization of the sex offenders by the protesters and the tabloid press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=W. |last2=Williams |first2=A. |year=2013 |title=The Myth of Moral Panics: Sex, Snuff, and Satan |series=Routledge Advances in Criminology |location=London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415812665 }} {{page needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sociologists and criminologists (Ungar, Hier, Rohloff) have revised Cohen's original framework. The revisions are compatible with the way in which Cohen theorizes panics in the third ''Introduction to Folk Devils and Moral Panics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-4446.2011.01377.x |pmid=21899526 |title=Tightening the focus: Moral panic, moral regulation and liberal government |journal=The British Journal of Sociology |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=523–41 |year=2011 |last1=Hier |first1=Sean P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The term was used in 1830, in a way that completely differs from its modern [[social science]] application, by a religious magazine&lt;ref name=HB&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Dr. Cox on regeneration | journal = [[Millennial Harbinger]] | volume = 1 | pages = 546–550 | publisher = W.

To paralyze the soul, or to strike it through with a moral panic is not regeneration." (page 546) and "After quoting such scriptures as these, "''Seek'' and you shall find," "''Come'' unto me, and I will give you rest," they ask,  ...is it not the natural language of these expressions that the mind is as far as possible from stagnation, or torpor, or "moral panic?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="955">'''Moral perception''' is a term used in [[ethics]] to denote the discernment of the morally salient qualities in particular situations. Moral [[perception]]s are argued to be necessary to [[moral reasoning]] (see [[practical reason]]), the deliberation of what is the right thing to do. Moral perception is variously conceptualized by [[Aristotle]], [[Hannah Arendt]], and [[Martha C. Nussbaum]]. [[Lawrence Blum]] (1994) distinguishes moral perception from moral judgment. Whereas a person's judgment about what the moral course of action would be is the result of a conscious deliberation, the basis for that process is the perception of aspects of one's situation, which is different for each person. Moral perceptions are also particular in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Lawrence. 1994. Moral Perception and Particularity. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10979">{{Violence against women}}
'''Murder of pregnant women''' is a type of [[homicide]] often resulting from [[domestic violence]]. Domestic violence&amp;mdash;or [[intimate partner violence]] (IPV)&amp;mdash;is suffered by many, and when analyzing cases in which victims came forward, majority of them are women.{{Citation needed|reason= 221 studies say otherwise: http://web.csulb.edu/~mfiebert/assault.htm|date=March 2017}} Many of these women fear harm not just to themselves but also to their unborn children. Recently, more focus has been placed on pregnancy-associated deaths due to violence.&lt;ref name="Martin, SL 2007"&gt;Martin, S. L., Macy, R. J., Sullivan, K., and Magee, M. L. (2007) Pregnancy-Associated Violent Deaths: The Role of Intimate Partner Violence. Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse. (8), 135-148.&lt;/ref&gt; IPV may begin when the victim becomes pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, B., McFarlane, J., and Soeken, K. (1994) Abuse During Pregnancy: Effects on Maternal Complications and Birth Weight in Adult and Teenage Women. Obstet Gynecol. 323-328.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown that abuse while pregnant is a red flag for pregnancy-associated homicide.&lt;ref name="Campbell, JC 2007"&gt;Campbell, J. C., Glass, N., Sharps, P. W., Laughon, K., and Bloom, T. (2007) Intimate Partner Homicide: Review and Implications of Research and Policy. Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse. (8), 246-269.&lt;/ref&gt;

The murder of pregnant women represents a relatively recently studied class of [[murder]]. Limited statistics are available as there is no reliable system in place yet to track such cases.&lt;ref name="Wash Post"&gt;{{cite web|first=Donna|last=St. George|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10074-2004Dec18.html|title=Many New or Expectant Mothers Die Violent Deaths|publisher=''[[Washington Post]]''|date=December 19, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether [[pregnancy]] is a [[Causality|causal factor]] is hard to determine.

==Statistics==
ABC News have reported that studies in Maryland, New York, and Chicago found that approximately 20 percent of women who die during pregnancy are victims of murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3316485&amp;page=1&amp;GMA=true|title=Murder Is One of Top Causes of Death for Pregnant Women|date=June 26, 2007|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' examined death-record data across the US which documented the killings of 1,367 pregnant women and new mothers since 1990. The newspaper reports:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he killings span racial and ethnic groups. In cases whose details were known, 67 percent of women were killed with firearms. Many women were slain at home &amp;mdash; in bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens &amp;mdash; usually by men they knew. Husbands. Boyfriends. Lovers.&lt;ref name="Wash Post"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Isabelle Horon and Diana Cheng of the [[Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene]] conducted a study of pregnancy-associated deaths in [[Maryland]] between 1993 and 1998, defining pregnancy-associated death as death during pregnancy or within a year of pregnancy ending. They found that homicide was the leading cause of pregnancy-associated death, accounting for 20% of such deaths. In contrast, homicide was only the fifth leading cause of death for women of reproductive age who had not been pregnant in the year previous to their death, and accounted for 6.4% of deaths in this group. The second leading cause of pregnancy-associated death, heart disease, accounted for 19%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horon|first=Isabelle L.|last2=Cheng|first2=Diana|date=2001|title=Enhanced Surveillance for Pregnancy-Associated Mortality—Maryland, 1993-1998|url=http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/193666|journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]|volume=285|pages=1455–1459|doi=10.1001/jama.285.11.1455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20010320/number-1-cause-of-death-in-pregnant-women-murder|title=No. 1 Cause of Death in Pregnant Women: Murder|author=|date=|website=webmd.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study using data from the District of Columbia also found that homicide was the leading cause of pregnancy-associated death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krulewitch|first=Cara J.|last2=Pierre-Louis|first2=Marie Lydie|last3=de Leon-Gomez|first3=Regina|last4=Guy|first4=Richard|last5=Green|first5=Richard|date=2001|title=Hidden from view: violent deaths among pregnant women in the District of Columbia, 1988-1996|journal=[[Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health]]|volume=46|pages=4–10|doi=10.1016/s1526-9523(00)00096-9|pmid=11300307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Homicide a leading cause of death in pregnant women. (ContinuingEducation)  http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Homicide+a+leading+cause+of+death+in+pregnant+women.+%28Continuing...-a080055987&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] study reported that "the overall pregnancy-associated homicide ratio was 1.7 deaths per 100 000 live births", and that homicide was not the leading cause of pregnancy-associated death, though it was still highlighted as among the leading causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Berg|first2=C. J.|last3=Saltzman|first3=L. E.|last4=Herndon|first4=J.|year=2005|title=Homicide: a leading cause of injury deaths among pregnant and postpartum women in the United States, 1991–1999|journal=Am J Public Health|volume=95|issue=|pages=471–477|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2005.072017|pmc=1449445|pmid=16195505|last1=Chang|first1=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Horon and Cheng argued that the CDC's study underestimated the problem because it used incomplete information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Using more sources of information, Horon and Cheng found that the rate of pregnancy-associated homicide in Maryland was 10.5 per 100,000 live births. They suggested a need for US states to improve their collection of data on pregnancy-associated deaths.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horon|first=Isabelle|last2=Cheng|first2=Diana|date=2005|title=Underreporting of pregnancy-associated deaths|journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]]|volume=95|pages=1879|doi=10.2105/ajph.2005.072017|pmid=16195505|pmc=1449445}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Washington Post'' reported in 2004 that "13 states said they had no way of telling how many pregnant and postpartum women had been killed in recent years".&lt;ref name="Wash Post" /&gt; In 2003, California remedied this by changing its [[death certificate]] documentation to include a female victim's maternity status.&lt;ref name="Wash Post" /&gt;

Homicide was the second-leading cause of death among women ages 20 to 24 and fifth among women ages 25–34 in 1999. The top cause of death in both age groups is accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kim|last=Curtis|url=http://www.now.org/issues/violence/043003pregnant.html|title=Murder: The Leading Cause of Death for Pregnant Women|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=April 23, 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120233913/http://www.now.org/issues/violence/043003pregnant.html|archivedate=November 20, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws and policies==
The [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]], passed in 2004, defines a fetus as a "child in uterus" and a person as being a legal crime victim "if a fetal injury or death occurs during the commission of a federal violent crime."&lt;ref&gt;Ghazaleh, S., Martin, S. L., and Schiro, S. (2010) Homicide Among Pregnant and Postpartum Women in the United States: A Review of the Literature. Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse. (11), 42-54.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., 38 states have laws with more harsh penalties if the victim is murdered while pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrlc.org/federal/unbornvictims/statehomicidelaws092302/|title=State Homicide Laws That Recognize Unborn Victims|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nrlc.org|publisher=National Right to Life Committee|access-date=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/fetal-homicide-state-laws.aspx|title=Fetal Homicide State Laws|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these laws defining the fetus as being a person, "for the purpose of criminal prosecution of the offender" (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2008). [[Murder of Laci Peterson|Laci Peterson]], murdered in 2002, is one of the more high-profile homicides.

Currently in the [[North Carolina Senate]], a bill called the SB 353 Unborn Victims of Violence Act is being considered for legislation that would create a separate criminal offense for the death of a fetus when the mother is murdered. The North Carolina Coalition Against Domestic Violence does not support this law for numerous reasons including failure to see violence against the mother as the cause of the fetal death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCCADV Position Statement: Fetal Murder Legislation|url=http://www.nccadv.org/pdf/2008/finalNCCADVSTATEMENTfetalmurder07.pdf|publisher=North Carolina Coalition Against Domestic Violence|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coalition does, however, support the position of the [[National Network to End Domestic Violence]] regarding the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Intervention==
While it is almost impossible to determine an exact intervention point to prevent pregnancy-associated homicides, some possible opportunities can be pinpointed. The medical community is one of those points. Women may feel safe speaking to their health care providers about the abuse, especially after discovering they are pregnant. Some medical office and hospital policies specify that doctors will examine the patient privately without allowing the partner access. In a 2001 editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Victoria Frye writes, "Homicide by intimate partners may offer a focal point for effective pregnancy-associated mortality prevention efforts because many of these women come into contact with the health care system before their deaths."&lt;ref&gt;Frye, V. (2001) Examining Homicide's Contribution to Pregnancy-Associated Deaths. Journal of American Medical Association. (11), 1510-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of Intimate Partner Homicide policy and research has identified several needs: System-wide training in healthcare on signs of domestic violence&lt;ref name="Campbell, JC 2007"/&gt; and system-wide screening for domestic violence by health care providers, as well as the knowledge of where to refer women to that need services when abuse is disclosed.&lt;ref name="Martin, SL 2007"/&gt;

==Motives==
Statistics for pregnancy as being a motivating factor in the murder of a pregnant woman are usually unavailable. Motives may vary, with a woman's pregnancy at the time of death sometimes being coincidental.

{{Contains Indic text}}
'''Om''' ({{audio|Om pro.ogg|listen}}, [[IAST]]: ''Oṃ'', [[Devanagari]]: {{script|Deva|ॐ}}) is a sacred sound and a spiritual symbol in [[Hinduism]], that signifies the essence of the ultimate reality, consciousness or [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]].&lt;ref name=james482&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Om", ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism'', Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0823931804}}, page 482&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holdrege1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara A.

''Merriam-Webster'' (2013), Pronounced: \ˈōm\&lt;/ref&gt; It is a syllable that is chanted either independently or before a mantra in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Gonda]] (1963), ''The Indian Mantra'', Oriens, Vol. 16, pp. 244–297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lipner&gt;[[Julius Lipner]] (2010), ''Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415456760}}, pp. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt;

Om is part of the iconography found in ancient and medieval era manuscripts, temples, monasteries and spiritual retreats in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;T. A.

The syllable ''Om'' is first mentioned in the [[Upanishads]], the mystical texts associated with  the [[Vedanta]] philosophy.
It has variously been associated with concepts of  "cosmic sound" or "mystical syllable" or "affirmation to something divine", or as symbolism for abstract spiritual concepts in the Upanishads.&lt;ref name=annette /&gt;
In the [[Aranyaka]] and the [[Brahmana]] layers of Vedic texts, the syllable is so widespread and linked to knowledge, that it stands for the "whole of Veda".&lt;ref name=annette /&gt;
The etymological foundations of ''Om'' are repeatedly discussed in the oldest layers of the Vedantic texts (the early Upanishads).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, page 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Grimes (1995), Ganapati: The Song of Self, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791424391}}, pages 78-80 and 201 footnote 34&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aitareya Brahmana]] of Rig Veda, in section 5.32, for example suggests that the three phonetic components of ''Om'' (pronounced ''AUM'') correspond to the three stages of cosmic creation, and when it is read or said, it celebrates the creative powers of the universe.&lt;ref name=annette /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/vedas/aitereya/the_aitareya_brahmanam_of_the_rigveda__s.pdf Aitareya Brahmana 5.32], Rig Veda, pages 139-140 (Sanskrit); for English translation: See {{cite book|author=Arthur Berriedale Keith|title=The Aitareya and Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇas of the Rigveda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSgYAAAAYAAJ |year=1920|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brahmana layer of Vedic texts equate ''Om'' with ''Bhur-bhuvah-Svah'', the latter symbolizing "the whole Veda". They offer various shades of meaning to ''Om'', such as it being "the universe beyond the sun", or that which is "mysterious and inexhaustible", or "the infinite language, the infinite knowledge", or "essence of breath, life, everything that exists", or that "with which one is liberated".&lt;ref name=annette /&gt; The [[Samaveda|Sama Veda]], the poetical Veda, orthographically maps ''Om'' to the audible, the musical truths in its numerous variations (''Oum'', ''Aum'', ''Ovā Ovā Ovā Um'', etc.) and then attempts to extract musical meters from it.&lt;ref name=annette /&gt;

The syllable ''Om'' evolves to mean many abstract ideas in the earliest Upanishads. [[Max Müller]] and other scholars state that these philosophical texts recommend ''Om'' as a "tool for meditation", explain various meanings that the syllable may be in the mind of one meditating, ranging from "artificial and senseless" to "highest concepts such as the cause of the Universe, essence of life, Brahman, Atman, and Self-knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/n111/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], Oxford University Press, pages 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deussenmeaningofom&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 67-85, 227, 284, 308, 318, 361-366, 468, 600-601, 667, 772&lt;/ref&gt;

== Written representation ==
[[Phonological]]ly, the syllable ओम्  represents {{IPA|/aum/}}, which is regularly [[monophthong]]ised to {{IPA|[õː]}} in [[Sanskrit phonology]]. When occurring within spoken Sanskrit, the syllable is subject to the normal rules of [[sandhi]] in [[Sanskrit grammar]], however with the additional peculiarity that after preceding ''a'' or ''ā'', the ''au'' of ''aum''  does not form [[vriddhi]] (''au'') but [[guna]] (''o'') per [[Pāṇini]] 6.1.95 (i.e. 'om').
It is sometimes  also written ओ३म् (''ō̄m'' {{IPA-sa|õːːm|}}), notably by [[Arya Samaj]], where ३ (i.e., the digit "3") is ''[[Pluti|pluta]]'' ("three times as long"), [[pluti|indicating a length]] of three [[morae]] (that is, the time it takes to say three syllables) — an [[vowel length|overlong]] [[nasalised]] [[close-mid back rounded vowel]].

The ''Om'' symbol [[File:Aum.svg|20px]]  is a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] in [[Devanagari]], combining ओ (''{{IAST|au}}'') and [[chandrabindu]] ([[ँ]], ''{{IAST|ṃ}}''). In  [[Unicode]], the symbol is encoded at {{unichar|0950|Devanagari OM}} and at {{unichar|1f549|OM Symbol}} ("generic symbol independent of Devanagari font").

The ''Om'' or ''Aum'' symbol is found on ancient coins, in regional scripts. In [[Sri Lanka]], [[Anuradhapura Kingdom|Anuradhapura era]] coins (dated from the 1st to 4th centuries) are embossed with ''Aum'' along with other symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Parker, ''Ancient Ceylon''  (1909), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=Nk8xpkY0bqEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA490 p. 490].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Nagari]] or [[Devanagari]] representations are found epigraphically on medieval sculpture, such as   the [[dancing Shiva]] (ca. 10th to 12th century); [[Joseph Campbell]] (1949) even argued that the dance posture itself can be taken to  represent ''AUM'' as a symbol  of the entirety of "consciousness, universe" and "the message that God is within a person and without".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell (1949), ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', 108f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Om'' symbol, with [[epigraphic]]al variations, is also found in many [[southeast Asia]]n countries. For example, it is called ''Unalom'' or ''Aum'' in [[Thailand]] and has been a part of various flags and official emblems such as in the [[Royal Standard of Thailand#Fourth reign|Thong Chom Klao]] of [[Mongkut|King Rama IV]] (r. 1851–1868).&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Wong (2001), ''Sounding the Center: History and Aesthetics in Thai Buddhist Performance'', [[University of Chicago Press]], {{ISBN|978-0226905853}}, page 292&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Cambodia]]n official seal has similarly incorporated the ''Aum'' symbol.&lt;ref&gt;James Minahan (2009), ''The Complete Guide to National Symbols and Emblems'', {{ISBN|978-0313344961}}, pages 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[traditional Chinese characters]], it is written as [[:wikt:唵|唵]] ([[pinyin]] – ǎn), and as [[:wikt:嗡|嗡]] (pinyin – wēng) in [[simplified Chinese characters]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

There have been proposals that the ''Om'' syllable may already have had written representations in [[Brahmi script]], dating to before the Common Era. A proposal by Deb (1848) held that the ''[[swastika]]'' is "a [[monogram]]matic representation of the syllable Om, wherein two Brahmi /o/ characters ({{unichar|11011|Brahmi letter O}}) were superposed crosswise and the 'm' was represented by dot".&lt;ref&gt;HK Deb, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, Volume XVII, Number 3, page 137&lt;/ref&gt; A commentary in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' considers this theory questionable and unproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|1bMzAQAAMAAJ|The Swastika|page=PA365}}, Nature, Vol. 110, No. 2758, page 365&lt;/ref&gt;
Roy (2011) proposed  that ''Om'' was represented using the Brahmi symbols for "A", "U" and "M" (&amp;#x11005;&amp;thinsp;&amp;#x11009;&amp;thinsp;&amp;#x1102b;), and that this may have influenced the unusual [[epigraphic]]al features of the symbol {{large|ॐ}} for ''Om''.&lt;ref&gt;Ankita Roy (2011), ''[http://www.mrane.com/images/bramhi.pdf Rediscovering the Brahmi Script]''.

[[File:Om Symbol at Kanaka Durga Temple.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Om Symbol at Kanaka Durga Temple, Vijayawada]]
''Om'' came to be used as a standard utterance at the beginning of [[mantra]]s, chants or citations taken from the  [[Veda]]s. For example, the  [[Gayatri mantra]], which consists of a verse from the [[Rigveda]] Samhita ([[Mandala 3|RV 3]].62.10), is prefixed not just by ''Om'' but by ''Om'' followed by the formula '' bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ''.&lt;ref name=mmwpage17&gt;Monier Monier-Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom, Luzac &amp; Co., London, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; Such recitations continue to be in use in Hinduism, with many major incantations and ceremonial functions beginning and ending with ''Om''.&lt;ref name=lipner /&gt;
[[Swami Maheshwarananda|Maheshwarananda]] (2002) suggests that the Om reflects the cosmological beliefs in Hinduism, as the primordial sound associated with the creation of universe from nothing.&lt;ref name=Mahesh&gt;Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda, ''The hidden power in humans'', Ibera Verlag (2002), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Upanishads ===
The syllable "Om" is described with various meanings in  the [[Upanishads]]. Descriptions include "the sacred sound, the Yes!, the Vedas, the ''Udgitha'' (song of the universe), the infinite, the all encompassing, the whole world, the truth, the ultimate reality, the finest essence, the cause of the Universe, the essence of life, the [[Brahman]], the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], the vehicle of deepest knowledge, and Self-knowledge".&lt;ref name=deussenmeaningofom /&gt;

The [[Chandogya Upanishad]] is one of the oldest Upanishads of Hinduism. It opens with the recommendation that "let a man meditate on Om".&lt;ref name=maxmuller11&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/n111/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part I, Oxford University Press, pages 1-3 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; It calls the syllable Om as ''udgitha'' (उद्गीथ, song, chant), and asserts that the significance of the syllable is thus: the essence of all beings is earth, the essence of earth is water, the essence of water are the plants, the essence of plants is man, the essence of man is speech, the essence of speech is the [[Rig Veda]], the essence of the Rig Veda is the Sama Veda, and the essence of Sama Veda is the ''udgitha'' (song, ''Om'').&lt;ref name=pauldeussen11 /&gt;

''Rik'' (ऋच्, Ṛc) is speech, states the text, and ''Sāman'' (सामन्) is breath; they are pairs, and because they have love for each other, speech and breath find themselves together and mate to produce a song.&lt;ref name=maxmuller11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pauldeussen11 /&gt; The highest song is Om, asserts section 1.1 of Chandogya Upanishad. It is the symbol of awe, of reverence, of threefold knowledge because ''Adhvaryu'' invokes it, the ''Hotr'' recites it, and ''Udgatr'' sings it.&lt;ref name=pauldeussen11&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 68-70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Patrick Olivelle 2014 page 171-185"&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2014), The Early Upanishads, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195124354}}, page 171-185&lt;/ref&gt;

The second volume of the first chapter continues its discussion of syllable ''Om'', explaining its use as a struggle between ''Devas'' (gods) and ''Asuras'' (demons).&lt;ref name=pauldeussen12&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 70-71 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; Max Muller states that this struggle between gods and demons is considered allegorical by ancient [[Indian people|Indian]] scholars, as good and evil inclinations within man, respectively.&lt;ref name=maxmuller12&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/n111/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part I, Oxford University Press, pages 4-6 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; The legend in section 1.2 of Chandogya Upanishad states that gods took the ''Udgitha'' (song of ''Om'') unto themselves, thinking, "with this ''song'' we shall overcome the demons".&lt;ref name=hume12&gt;Robert Hume, [https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n199/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 178-180&lt;/ref&gt; The syllable ''Om'' is thus implied as that which inspires the good inclinations within each person.&lt;ref name=maxmuller12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=hume12 /&gt;

Chandogya Upanishad's exposition of syllable ''Om'' in its opening chapter combines etymological speculations, symbolism, metric structure and philosophical themes.&lt;ref name="Patrick Olivelle 2014 page 171-185" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/n111/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part I, Oxford University Press, pages 4-19 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; In the second chapter of the Chandogya Upanishad, the meaning and significance of ''Om'' evolves into a philosophical discourse, such as in section 2.10 where ''Om'' is linked to the Highest Self,&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/n139/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part I, Oxford University Press, page 28 with footnote 1&lt;/ref&gt; and section 2.23 where the text asserts ''Om'' is the essence of three forms of knowledge, ''Om'' is [[Brahman]] and "Om is all this [observed world]".&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/34/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part I, Oxford University Press, page 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Katho Upanishad ====
The Katho Upanishad is the legendary story of a little boy, [[Nachiketa]] – the son of sage Vajasravasa – who meets [[Yama]], the Indian deity of death.

The three roots of the syllable, states the Maitri Upanishad, are ''A'' + ''U'' + ''M''.&lt;ref name=maxmuller64&gt;Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 2, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/306/mode/2up Maitrayana-Brahmana Upanishad], Oxford University Press, pages 307-308&lt;/ref&gt; The sound is the body of Soul, and it repeatedly manifests in three: as gender-endowed body – feminine, masculine, neuter; as light-endowed body – [[Agni]], [[Vayu]] and [[Aditya]]; as deity-endowed body – Brahma, Rudra{{efn|later called as Shiva}} and Vishnu; as mouth-endowed body – Garhapatya, Dakshinagni and Ahavaniya;&lt;ref&gt;this is a reference to the three major Vedic fire rituals&lt;/ref&gt; as knowledge-endowed body – Rig, Saman and Yajur;&lt;ref&gt;this is a reference to the three major [[Vedas]]&lt;/ref&gt; as world-endowed body – Bhūr, Bhuvaḥ and Svaḥ; as time-endowed body – Past, Present and Future; as heat-endowed body – Breath, Fire and Sun; as growth-endowed body – Food, Water and Moon; as thought-endowed body – intellect, mind and psyche.&lt;ref name=maxmuller64 /&gt;&lt;ref name=cowell64&gt;[https://www.shemtaia.com/SKT/PDF/Upanishads/cowellmaitriskt.pdf Maitri Upanishad – Sanskrit Text with English Translation]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} EB Cowell (Translator), Cambridge University, Bibliotheca Indica, page 258-260&lt;/ref&gt; Brahman exists in two forms – the material form, and the immaterial formless.&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 2, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/306/mode/2up Maitrayana-Brahmana Upanishad], Oxford University Press, pages 306-307 verse 6.3&lt;/ref&gt; The material form is changing, unreal.

The world is Om, its light is Sun, and the Sun is also the light of the syllable ''Om'', asserts the Upanishad. Meditating on Om, is acknowledging and meditating on the Brahman-Atman (Soul, Self).&lt;ref name=maxmuller64 /&gt;

==== Mundaka Upanishad ====
The [[Mundaka Upanishad]] in the second ''Mundakam'' (part), suggests the means to knowing the Self and the Brahman to be meditation, self-reflection and introspection, that can be aided by the symbol ''Om''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]] (Translator), Sixty Upanisads of the Veda, Vol 2, Motilal Banarsidass (2010 Reprint), {{ISBN|978-8120814691}}, pages 580-581&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Roer, [https://www.shemtaia.com/SKT/PDF/Upanishads/roermundakaeng.pdf Mundaka Upanishad]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. XV, No. 41 and 50, Asiatic Society of Bengal, page 144&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mandukya Upanishad ====
The [[Mandukya Upanishad]] opens by declaring, "Om!, this syllable is this whole world".&lt;ref name=pauldeussenfull /&gt; Thereafter it presents various explanations and theories on what it means and signifies.&lt;ref name=humefull /&gt; This discussion is built on a structure of "four fourths" or "fourfold", derived from ''A'' + ''U'' + ''M'' + "silence" (or without an element).&lt;ref name=pauldeussenfull&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814691}}, pages 605-637&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=humefull&gt;{{citation|first=Robert Ernest|last=Hume|url=https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n411/mode/2up|title=The Thirteen Principal Upanishads|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1921|pages=391–393}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Aum as all states of time'''
:In verse 1, the Upanishad states that time is threefold: the past, the present and the future, that these three are "Aum". The four fourth of time is that which transcends time, that too is "Aum" expressed.&lt;ref name=humefull /&gt;
:'''Aum as all states of Atman'''
:In verse 2, states the Upanishad, everything is Brahman, but Brahman is Atman (the Soul, Self), and that the Atman is fourfold.&lt;ref name=pauldeussenfull /&gt; Johnston summarizes these four states of Self, respectively, as seeking the physical, seeking inner thought, seeking the causes and spiritual consciousness, and the fourth state is realizing oneness with the Self, the Eternal.&lt;ref name=johnston&gt;Charles Johnston, [http://www.universaltheosophy.com/pdf-library/Mandukya%20Upanishad_Johnston.pdf The Measures of the Eternal – Mandukya Upanishad] Theosophical Quarterly, October, 1923, pages 158-162&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Aum as all states of consciousness'''
:In verses 3 to 6, the Mandukya Upanishad enumerates four states of consciousness: wakeful, dream, deep sleep and the state of ''ekatma'' (being one with Self, the oneness of Self).&lt;ref name=humefull /&gt; These four are ''A'' + ''U'' + ''M'' + "without an element" respectively.&lt;ref name=humefull /&gt;
:'''Aum as all of knowledge'''
:In verses 9 to 12, the Mandukya Upanishad enumerates fourfold etymological roots of the syllable "Aum". It states that the first element of "Aum" is ''A'', which is from ''Apti'' (obtaining, reaching) or from ''Adimatva'' (being first).&lt;ref name=pauldeussenfull /&gt; The second element is ''U'', which is from ''Utkarsa'' (exaltation) or from ''Ubhayatva'' (intermediateness).&lt;ref name=humefull /&gt; The third element is ''M'', from ''Miti'' (erecting, constructing) or from ''Mi Minati, or apīti'' (annihilation).&lt;ref name=pauldeussenfull /&gt; The fourth is without an element, without development, beyond the expanse of universe. In this way, states the Upanishad, the syllable Om is indeed the Atman (the self).&lt;ref name=pauldeussenfull /&gt;&lt;ref name=humefull /&gt;

==== Shvetashvatara Upanishad ====
The [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]], in verses 1.14 to 1.16, suggests meditating with the help of syllable ''Om'', where one's perishable body is like one fuel-stick and the syllable ''Om'' is the second fuel-stick, which with discipline and diligent rubbing of the sticks unleashes the concealed fire of thought and awareness within. Such knowledge, asserts the Upanishad, is the goal of Upanishads.&lt;ref name=pauldeussen116&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/236/mode/2up Shvetashvatara Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part II, Oxford University Press, page 237&lt;/ref&gt; The text asserts that ''Om'' is a tool of meditation empowering one to know the God within oneself, to realize one's Atman (Soul, Self).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hume (1921), [https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n417/mode/2up Shvetashvatara Upanishad 1.14 – 1.16], The Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 396-397 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aitareya Aranyaka]] in verse 23.6,{{clarify|date=September 2016}}&lt;!--AA has six books. You need to cite book, chapter and verse--&gt; explains ''Om'' as "an acknowledgment, melodic confirmation, something that gives momentum and energy to a hymn".&lt;ref name=wilke435 /&gt;

=== Bhagavad Gita ===
The [[Bhagavad Gita]], in the Epic [[Mahabharata]], mentions the meaning and significance of ''Om'' in several verses. For example, Fowler notes that verse 9.17 of the Bhagavad Gita synthesizes the competing dualistic and monist streams of thought in Hinduism, by using "''Om'' which is the symbol for the indescribable, impersonal [[Brahman]]".&lt;ref name=jfowler164 /&gt;
{{Quote|

The significance of the sacred syllable in the Hindu traditions, is similarly highlighted in various of its verses, such as verse 17.24 where the importance of ''Om'' during prayers, charity and meditative practices is explained as follows,&lt;ref name=jfowler271 /&gt;
{{Quote|

[[Charles Johnston (Theosophist)|Johnston]] states this verse highlights the importance of ''Om'' in the meditative practice of Yoga, where it symbolizes three worlds in the Soul; the three times – past, present and future eternity, the three divine powers – creation, preservation and transformation in one Being; and three essences in one Spirit – immortality, omniscience and joy. It is, asserts Johnston, a symbol for the perfected Spiritual Man (his emphasis).&lt;ref name=charlesj /&gt;

=== Puranas ===
[[File:Ganesha-aum.jpg|thumb|upright|The Hindu deity [[Ganesha]] is sometimes linked to the symbol ''Om'' and as the symbol for [[Upanishad]]ic concept of Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John A Grimes |title=Ganapati: Song of the Self |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aoqB4n95pSoC |year=1995 |publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-2439-1 |pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Alter (2004), Elephas Maximus, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0143031741}}, page 95&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The medieval era texts of Hinduism, such as the [[Puranas]] adopt and expand the concept of ''Om'' in their own ways, and to their own theistic sects. According to the [[Vayu Purana]], ''Om'' is the representation of the Hindu [[Trimurti]], and represents the union of the three gods, viz. ''A'' for [[Brahma]], ''U'' for [[Vishnu]] and ''M'' for [[Shiva]]. The three sounds also symbolise the three [[Vedas]], namely ([[Rigveda]], [[Samaveda]], [[Yajurveda]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The [[Shiva Purana]] highlights the relation between deity [[Shiva]] and the ''Pranava'' or ''Om''. Shiva is declared to be ''Om'', and that ''Om'' is Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Beck (1995), Sonic Theology: Hinduism and Sacred Sound, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812611}}, page 154&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jainism ==
In [[Jainism]], om is considered a condensed form of reference to the [[Pañca-Parameṣṭhi]], by their initials ''A+A+A+U+M'' (''{{IAST|o[[pluti|3]]}}{{IAST|m}}''). The [[Dravyasamgraha]] quotes a [[Prakrit]] line:{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1999|pp=410-411}}
:{{lang|sa|ओम एकाक्षर पञ्चपरमेष्ठिनामादिपम्  तत्कथमिति चेत  "अरिहंता असरीरा आयरिया तह उवज्झाया मुणियां"}}{{efn|''{{IAST|oma ekākṣara pañca-parameṣṭhi-nāmā-dipam tatkathamiti cheta "arihatā asarīrā āyariyā taha uvajjhāyā muṇiyā"}}''}}

:''AAAUM'' (or just "Om") is one syllable short form of the initials of the five parameshthis: "[[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]], [[Ashiri]], [[Acharya]], [[Upajjhaya]], [[Jain monasticism|Muni]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/om.html Om – significance in Jainism], Languages and Scripts of India, Colorado State University&lt;/ref&gt;
{{lang|sa|ओं नमः}} ''({{IAST|Oṃ namaḥ}}) Siddhanam'' (6 syllables), ''Om Nhi'' (2 syllables) and just ''Om'' (1 syllable) are the short forms of the Paramesthi-Mantra, also called Namokar Mantra or [[Namokar Mantra|Navkar Mantra]] in Jainism.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1999|pp=410-411}}

In [[Chinese Buddhism]], ''Om'' is often [[Transliteration|transliterated]] as the [[Chinese character]] {{script|Hant|[[:zh:唵|唵]]}} ([[pinyin]] ''{{lang|pny|ǎn}}'') or {{script|Hant|[[:wikt:嗡|嗡]]}} ([[pinyin]] ''{{lang|pny|wēng}}'').

=== Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayana) ===
In Tibetan [[Buddhism]], ''Om'' is often placed at the beginning of [[mantra]]s and [[dharani]]s. Probably the most well known mantra is "[[Om mani padme hum]]", the six syllable mantra of the [[Bodhisattva]] of compassion, [[Avalokiteśvara]]. This mantra is particularly associated with the four-armed Shadakshari form of Avalokiteśvara. Moreover, as a seed syllable (''[[Bīja|bija]] [[mantra]]''), ''Aum'' is considered sacred and holy in [[Esoteric Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiancentury.com/om.htm|title="OM" - THE SYMBOL OF THE ABSOLUTE|accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars interpret the first word of the mantra ''oṃ maṇipadme hūṃ'' to be ''auṃ'', with a meaning similar to Hinduism – the totality of sound, existence and consciousness.&lt;ref name="carlolsenb"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Different Paths of Buddhism: A Narrative-Historical Introduction|last=Olsen|first=Carl|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2014|ISBN=978-0-8135-3778-8|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gods of Northern Buddhism: Their History and Iconography|last=Getty|first=Alice|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1988|ISBN=978-0-486-25575-0|pages=29, 191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Oṃ'' has been described by the 14th Dalai Lama as "composed of three pure letters, A, U, and M.

Onkar is, states Wazir Singh, a "variation of Om (Aum) of the ancient Indian scriptures (with a slight change in its orthography), implying the seed-force that evolves as the universe".&lt;ref&gt;Wazir Singh (1969), Guru Nanak's philosophy, Journal of Religious Studies, Vol. 1, Issue 1, page 56&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ik Onkar'' is part of the "Mul Mantra" in Sikh teachings and represents "One God", explains Gulati, where "Ik" means One, and Onkar is "equivalent of the Hindu "Om" (Aum)".&lt;ref name=gulati285&gt;Mahinder Gulati (2008), Comparative Religious And Philosophies : Anthropomorphlsm And Divinity, Atlantic, {{ISBN|978-8126909025}}, pages 284-285; Quote: "While Ek literally means One, Onkar is the equivalent of the Hindu "Om" (Aum), the one syllable sound representing the holy trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva - the God in His entirety."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guru Nanak]] wrote a poem entitled Oankar in which, states Doniger, he "attributed the origin and sense of speech to the Divinity, who is thus the Om-maker".&lt;ref name="M-W Ik Onkar"/&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
''Oankar'' ('the Primal Sound') created [[Brahma]], ''Oankar'' fashioned the consciousness,
From ''Oankar'' came mountains and ages, ''Oankar'' produced the [[Vedas]],
By the grace of ''Oankar'', people were saved through the divine word,
By the grace of ''Oankar'', they were liberated through the teachings of the Guru.

''Ik Aumkara'' appears at the start of ''Mul Mantra'', states Kohli, and it occurs as "Aum" in the ''Upanishads'' and in ''Gurbani''.&lt;ref name=sskohli39&gt;SS Kohli (1993), The Sikh and Sikhism, Atlantic, {{ISBN|81-71563368}}, page 35, Quote: "Ik Aumkara is a significant name in Guru Granth Sahib and appears in the very beginning of Mul Mantra. It occurs as Aum in the Upanishads and in Gurbani, the Onam Akshara (the letter Aum) has been considered as the abstract of three worlds (p. 930). According to Brihadaranyaka Upanishad "Aum" connotes both the transcendent and immanent Brahman.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the meaning of ''Oankar'' in the Sikh tradition, states Pashaura Singh, is quite different in certain respects than those in other Indian philosophical traditions.&lt;ref name=pashaura227/&gt;

The Brahmic script ''om''-ligature has become widely recognised in Western [[counterculture]] since the 1960s, mostly in its standard [[Devanagari]] form (ॐ), but the [[Tibetan alphabet]] ''om'' (ༀ) has also gained limited currency in popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Messerle|first=Ulrich|title=Graphics of the Sacred Symbol OM|url=http://om.pinkproton.org/pictures/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4255">In [[behavioral finance]], the '''ostrich effect''' is the attempt made by investors to avoid negative financial information. The name comes from the common (but false) legend that [[ostrich]]es bury their heads in the sand to avoid danger.

Originally the term was coined by {{harvtxt|Galai|Sade|2006}}, and was defined as "the avoidance of apparently risky financial situations by pretending they do not exist", but since {{harvtxt|Karlsson|Loewenstein|Seppi|2009}} it took the slightly broader meaning of "avoiding to expose oneself to [financial] information that one fear may cause psychological discomfort". For example, in the event of a market downturn, people may choose to avoid monitoring their investments or seeking out further financial news.

==Research==
{{harvtxt|Galai|Sade|2006}} explain differences in returns in the [[fixed income]] market by using a psychological explanation, which they name the "ostrich effect," attributing this anomalous behavior to an aversion to receiving information on potential interim losses. They also provide evidence that the entrance to a leading financial portal in Israel is positively related to the equity market. Later, research by {{harvtxt|Karlsson|Loewenstein|Seppi|2009}} determined that people in [[Scandinavia]] looked up the value of their investments 50% to 80% less often during bad markets.

{{harvtxt|Galai|Sade|2006}} also found that investors prefer financial investments where the risk is unreported over those with a similar risk-return profile and frequently reported risks, saying that investors are willing to pay a premium for "the bliss of ignorance".

==Criticism==
A study by {{harvtxt|Gherzi et al.|2014}} showed no perceivable attempt by investors to ignore or avoid negative information, but instead found that "investors increase their portfolio monitoring following both positive and daily negative market returns, behaving more like hyper-vigilant meerkats than head-in-the-sand ostriches". They dubbed this phenomenon "[[meerkat]] effect".

In [[aeronautical engineering]], '''overall pressure ratio''', or '''overall compression ratio''', is the ratio of the [[stagnation pressure]] as measured at the front and rear of the compressor of a [[gas turbine]] engine. The terms ''compression ratio'' and ''pressure ratio'' are used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;"The aircraft Gas Turbine Engine and its operation" P&amp;W Oper.Instr.200, United Technologies Pratt &amp; whitney December, 1982, p.49&lt;/ref&gt; '''Overall compression ratio''' also means the ''overall cycle pressure ratio'' which includes intake ram.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/tocs/210525592.pdf p.695&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of overall pressure ratios==
Early jet engines had limited pressure ratios due to construction inaccuracies of the compressors and various material limits. For instance, the [[Junkers Jumo 004]] from [[World War II]] had an overall pressure ratio 3.14:1.  The immediate post-war [[Snecma Atar]] improved this marginally to 5.2:1. Improvements in materials, compressor blades, and especially the introduction of multi-spool engines with several different rotational speeds, led to the much higher pressure ratios common today.

Modern civilian engines generally operate between 40 and 55:1. The highest in-service is the [[General Electric GEnx]]-1B/75 with an OPR of 58 at the end of the [[Climb (aeronautics)|climb]] to cruise altitude (Top of Climb) and 47 for [[takeoff]] at [[sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://leehamnews.com/2016/10/28/bjorns-corner-turbofan-engine-challenges-part-1/ |title= Bjorn’s Corner: Turbofan engine challenges, Part 1 |author= Bjorn Fehrm |date= October 28, 2016 |work= Leeham News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages of high overall pressure ratios==
Generally speaking, a higher overall pressure ratio implies higher efficiency, but the engine will usually weigh more, so there is a compromise.
A high overall pressure ratio permits a larger area ratio nozzle to be fitted on the jet engine. This means that more of the heat energy is converted to jet speed, and energetic efficiency improves.  This is reflected in improvements in the engine's [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]].

==Disadvantages of high overall pressure ratios==
One of the primary limiting factors on pressure ratio in modern designs is that the air heats up as it is compressed. As the air travels through the compressor stages it can reach temperatures that pose a material failure risk for the compressor blades. This is especially true for the last compressor stage, and the outlet temperature from this stage is a common [[figure of merit]] for engine designs.

Military engines are often forced to work under conditions that maximize the heating load. For instance, the [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark]] was required to operate at speeds of Mach 1.1 at [[sea level]]. As a side-effect of these wide operating conditions, and generally older technology in most cases, military engines typically have lower overall pressure ratios. The [[Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30]] used on the F-111 had a pressure ratio of about 20:1, while newer engines like the [[General Electric F110]] and [[Pratt &amp; Whitney F135]] have improved this to about 30:1.

An additional concern is weight. A higher compression ratio implies a heavier engine, which in turn costs fuel to carry around. Thus, for a particular construction technology and set of flight plans an optimal overall pressure ratio can be determined.

The contribution of intake to the overall pressure ratio, defined as the ratio of the stagnation pressure as measured at the front and rear of the intake is negative in supersonic flight, and approximately non-existent in subsonic flight. Therefore with the definition given in the first sentence in this article, the overall effective pressure ratio of Concorde taking intake into account is less than without it. In other words less than 15.5:1 as in the table.
Information from the source given above obviously uses a different definition for overall pressure ratio, comparing static pressures instead of stagnation pressures, and is misleading given the definition in this article as it is.
{{notelist}}

==Differences from other similar terms==
The term should not be confused with the more familiar term [[compression ratio]] applied to [[reciprocating engine]]s. Compression ratio is a ratio of volumes.  In the case of the [[Otto cycle]] reciprocating engine, the maximum expansion of the charge is limited by the mechanical movement of the pistons (or rotor), and so the compression can be measured by simply comparing the volume of the cylinder with the piston at the top and bottom of its motion. The same is not true of the "open ended" gas turbine, where operational and structural considerations are the limiting factors. Nevertheless, the two terms are similar in that they both offer a quick way of determining overall efficiency relative to other engines of the same class.

The broadly equivalent measure of [[rocket engine]] efficiency is chamber pressure/exit pressure, and this ratio can be over 2000 for the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]].

==Compression ratio versus overall pressure ratio==
[[File:Compression ratio versus pressure ratio.png|thumb|Compression ratio versus pressure ratio]]

Compression ratio and overall pressure ratio would be interrelated as follows, if the first sentence in this article would be incorrect, given as it is, what follows is valid only for static pressures, but not overall pressure ratios, as compresson while slowing down flow without doing work is not changing stagnation pressure at all, and in supersonic flow with shock waves stagnation pressure will be less than 1 with &gt; 1 compression ratio:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Compression ratio
|| 2:1  || 3:1 || 5:1 || 10:1 || 15:1 || 20:1 || 25:1 || 35:1
|-
! Pressure ratio
|| 2.64:1 || 4.66:1 ||9.52:1 || 25.12:1 || 44.31:1 || 66.29:1 || 90.60:1 || 145.11:1
|}

The reason for this difference is that compression ratio is defined via the volume reduction:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{CR}=\frac{V_1}{V_2}&lt;/math&gt;,
while pressure ratio is defined as the [[pressure]] increase:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{PR}=\frac{P_2}{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;.
In calculating the pressure ratio, we assume that an [[adiabatic compression]] is carried out (i.e. that no heat energy is supplied to the gas being compressed, and that any temperature rise is solely due to the compression). We also assume that air is a perfect gas. With these two assumptions, we can define the relationship between change of volume and change of pressure as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;P_1 V_1^\gamma = P_2 V_2^\gamma \Rightarrow
\frac{P_2}{P_1}= \left( \frac{V_1}{V_2} \right)^\gamma &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[ratio of specific heats]] (air: approximately 1.4).
The values in the table above are derived using this formula. Note that in reality the ratio of specific heats changes with temperature and that significant deviations from adiabatic behavior will occur.

[[File:PersecutionAndTheArtOfWriting.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
'''''Persecution and the Art of Writing''''', published in 1952 by the [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]], is a book of collected articles written by [[Leo Strauss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eugene Sheppard|title=Leo Strauss and the Politics of Exile: The Making of a Political Philosopher|chapter=4|date=7 October 2014|publisher=Brandeis University Press|isbn=978-1-61168-769-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book contains five previously published essays, many of which were significantly altered by Strauss from their original publication. The general theme of the book is the relationship between [[politics]] and [[philosophy]]. The thesis of the book is that many ancient and early modern political philosophers, in order to avoid persecution, hid their most [[heterodoxy|heterodox]] ideas within their texts.

==Overview==
Strauss's general argument—rearticulated throughout his subsequent writings (most notably in ''The City and Man'' – 1964)—is that prior to the 19th century, Western scholars commonly understood that philosophical writing is not at home in any polity, no matter how liberal.  Insofar as it questions conventional wisdom at its roots, philosophy must guard itself especially against those readers who believe themselves authoritative, wise, and liberal defenders of the status quo.  In questioning established opinions, or in investigating the principles of morality, philosophers of old found it necessary to convey their messages in an oblique manner.  Their "art of writing" was the art of ''exoteric'' communication.  This is all the more apparent in medieval times, when heterodox political thinkers wrote under the threat of the Inquisition or comparably intransigent tribunals.

Strauss's argument is not that the medieval writers he studies reserved one exoteric meaning for the many (''hoi polloi'') and an esoteric or hidden one for the few (''hoi aristoi'', literally "the best") but rather that their writings' respective core meanings extended beyond and were irreducible to their texts' literal and/or historical dimension.

Explicitly following [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s lead, Strauss indicates that medieval political philosophers, no less than their ancient counterparts, in writing, carefully adapted their wording to the dominant moral views of their time, lest their writings be condemned as heretical or unjust, not by "the many" (who did not read), but by those "few" whom the many regarded as the most righteous guardians of morality: precisely those few righteous personalities would be most inclined to persecute or ostracize anyone who is in the business of exposing the [[Noble lie|"noble" or "great lie"]] upon which stands or falls the authority of the few over the many.

The Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001, is a statute passed by the Victorian Parliament during the Premiership of [[Steve Bracks]]. The Act makes behavior that incites or encourages hatred, serious contempt, revulsion or severe ridicule against another person or group of people because of their race and/or religion unlawful in Victoria

The Act criminalises racist graffiti, racist posters, racist stickers, racist comments made in a publication, including the Internet and email, statements at a meeting or at a public rally. The Act explicitly criminalises public behavior – not personal beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2001 |title=The Racial and Religious Tolerance Act  |url=https://www.humanrightscommission.vic.gov.au/home/the-law/racial-and-religious-tolerance-act |website=Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission |location=Melbourne |access-date=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catch the Fire Ministries - Vilification of Muslims lawsuit==

In a landmark ruling on 17 December 2004, a VCAT tribunal ruled that [[Danny Nalliah]], [[Daniel Scot]] and Catch the Fire Ministries had breached the law. The pair stood accused of making fun of Muslim beliefs and conduct that was "hostile, demeaning and derogatory of all Muslim people, their god, Allah, the prophet Muhammad and in general Muslim religious beliefs and practices". Nalliah publicly condemned the verdict and declared his intention to continue fighting the case, potentially as far as the [[High Court of Australia]]. ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper quoted him as stating, "We may have lost the battle, but the war is not over. The law has to be removed, there is no question."&lt;ref name="TheAgeHistoric"&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Historic-win-in-religious-hatred-case/2004/12/17/1102787271940.html Historic win in religious hatred case] [[The Age]], 18 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The matter was eventually resolved without a VCAT hearing after mediation between the two parties. On 22 June 2007 VCAT published a statement agreed to by both parties which affirmed everyone's rights to "robustly debate religion including the right to criticise the religious belief of another, in a free, open and democratic society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hosen |first1=Nadirsyah |last2=Mohr |first2=Richard |date=2011 |title=Law and religion in public life: The contemporary debate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21963547-1702,00.html |title=Church and Islamic council bury hatchet |last=Turnbull |first=Jeff |date=25 June 2007 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625063604/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21963547-1702,00.html |archivedate=25 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Patriots Front - Inciting Serious Contempt of Muslims==
In September 2017 three prominent members of the far-right [[United Patriots Front]]; Blair Cottrell, Neil Erikson and Chris Shortis, were charged with serious religious vilification, among other offenses. In September that same year they were convicted for inciting serious contempt of Muslims, each were fined $2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-05/three-men-found-guilty-of-inciting-serious-contempt-for-muslims/8874804|title=Far-right nationalists found guilty of inciting serious contempt for Muslims|date=2017-09-05|work=ABC News|access-date=2017-09-06|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Former state shadow [[Attorney general]] [[Andrew McIntosh (Australian politician)|Andrew McIntosh]] announced prior to the 2006 election that the [[Liberal Party of Australia (Victorian Division)|Liberal Party]] would repeal the religious section of the "fundamentally flawed" Act.&lt;ref name="The Age2"&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/libs-coy-over-hatred-laws/2006/08/09/1154802962877.html "libs coy over hatred laws"] 9 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2006, nineteen Christian leaders from Melbourne's largest churches wrote to the Premier requesting the removal of the civil provisions in the act, claiming that aspects of the religious vilification law undermines multiculturalism. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/religious-vilification-law-undermines-multiculturalism/2006/04/30/1146335604488.html "religious vilification law undermines multiculturalism"] [[The Age]] 30 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent MP [[Russell Savage]], whose support helped Bracks form Government in 1999, described the act as "the worst legislation he had ever seen passed".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/speaking-freely-is-risky-business-rally-told/2006/08/08/1154802889839.html "speaking freely is risky business"] [[The Age]] 8 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5137">'''Red Sea rig''', sometimes known as '''gulf rig''' or '''schooner rig''', is a [[dress code]] for [[semi-formal]] evening events, which in general consists of [[black tie]] attire with the jacket removed, a red [[bow tie]] and red [[cummerbund]], although there are local variations.

==History==
Red Sea rig was originally a [[Royal Navy]] concept appearing during the nineteenth century. Historically, it was felt that Royal Navy officers, like their British Army counterparts, should wear the full appropriate uniform for all formal events, whatever the temperature. The sole exception was in the [[Red Sea]], where the heat and humidity often made this physically impossible. Here, officers were permitted to remove their jackets in the [[wardroom]], provided they added a cummerbund to temper the somewhat informal look. Royal Air Force officers serving on Navy ships follow the naval tradition wearing a Red Sea rig version of their own [[mess dress]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafcms/mediafiles/9649A8EB_F8E2_CD83_3BEF4E3778E75CF3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In his reminiscences ''For King and Country'', [[Nelson Albert Tomalin]] describes a rather home-made version of Red Sea rig worn on board the whaler Southern Sea in 1943 as  "...white shirt with epaulettes and long blue trousers with a black scarf as a cummerbund...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://samilitaryhistory.org/diaries/nat5.html For King and Country &amp;ndash; Nelson Albert Tomalin]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its obvious practicality, Red Sea rig was adopted into civilian life, first by British diplomats in the [[Red Sea]] town of [[Jeddah]], and later by the local [[British business group|British Business Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbg-jed.org/dress_code.htm BBG Jeddah Dress code]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now widely worn by many military and civilian organisations and is often the dress code of choice for dinner parties in British expatriate communities in the [[Middle East]] and [[Far East]].&lt;ref&gt;Speech by David Lyman,[http://www.amchamthailand.com/asp/view_doc.asp?DocCID=1219 "Yesteryear – Bangkok 1956 What Life Was Like When AMCHAM Thailand Was Born"], reproduced in ''Thai-American Business'', March–April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Red Sea rig originated prior to [[air conditioning]] as a purely practical measure, but has now become a dress-style in its own right, even if the party or function is held in an air conditioned venue.

[[British and Commonwealth orders and decorations|Decorations]], even in miniature, are not normally worn with Red Sea rig, although [[medal]] miniature ribbons are.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irfc-nausena.nic.in/irfc/ezine/Trans2Trimph/chapters/21_personnel-1.htm Example from Indian Navy regulations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221043103/http://www.irfc-nausena.nic.in/irfc/ezine/Trans2Trimph/chapters/21_personnel-1.htm |date=2009-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
There are many military and civilian variations of Red Sea rig:

*'''Original Navy:''' Short-sleeved white shirt (open neck), formal dress trousers and black cummerbund&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readyayeready.com/jackspeak/alphabetic.php?alpha=R&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''P&amp;O Cruises &amp; Princess Cruises officers:''' Short-sleeved white shirt (open neck) with shoulder boards, formal dress trousers and black cummerbund; however a black belt is being substituted for the cummerbund more often than not.
*'''[[British business group|BBG]] / British Diplomatic:''' Long-sleeved white dress shirt, red bow tie, formal dress trousers and red cummerbund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbg-jed.org/dress_code.htm |accessdate=June 25, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''American diplomatic''' (also known as Gulf Rig): Simply black-tie attire, minus the jacket, although cummerbunds are often worn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/protocol/dressing.htm Dressing] on eDiplomat.com, adapted from material published by the Overseas Briefing Center of the U.S. Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Royal Marines]] band''': White long-sleeved dress shirt, black bowtie, normal uniform trousers with red side stripes, red cummerbund.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Marines [http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/Uniforms/Unf_MusnRedsearig.htm Fact Sheets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701214943/http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/Uniforms/Unf_MusnRedsearig.htm |date=2007-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Scottish Highland''': The military version consists of a long sleeved white dress shirt, black bow tie, [[tartan]] [[trews]] and a silk cummerbund in the regimental tartan (unless this is the very dark [[Clan Campbell#Tartans|Campbell tartan]], in which case a red, green or blue cummerbund may be substituted). The civilian version is usually a long sleeved white dress shirt, black or red bow tie  and [[kilt]].&lt;ref&gt;Clan Campbell Society North America,  [http://www.ccsna.org/jsep46.htm Scottish Highland Dress]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''reverse vending machine''' is a device that accepts used (empty) [[beverage containers]] and returns money to the user. The machines are popular in places that have mandatory [[recycling]] laws or [[container deposit legislation]]. In some places, bottlers paid funds into a centralized pool to be disbursed to people who recycled the containers.  Any excess funds were to be used for general environmental cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bottlebill.com/ |title=Bottle Bill Resource Guide |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=bottlebill.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other places, such as [[Norway]], the state mandated that a vendor pay for recycled bottles, but left the system in the hands of private industry.

==Operation==
[[File:Pantemaskin.webm|thumb|Video clip showing a reverse vending machine in Norway.]]
The recycler places the empty bottle or can into the receiving aperture; the horizontal in-feed system allows the user to insert containers one at a time. (An alternative system, found in many older machines, is one in which the user opens a door by hand and places the empty container in a pan. When the door is released and closed, the process continues.) The bottle or can is then automatically rotated; the bottle/can is then scanned by an omnidirectional [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] scanner, which scans the beverage container's [[Universal Product Code|UPC]].		
 	
Once a container is scanned, identified (matched to database) and determined to be a participating container, it is processed and typically crushed (for one-time-use containers) to reduce its size, to avoid spillages of liquid and to increase storage capacity. Refillable containers are collected and sorted by hand to be brought back to the bottling company.  The machines can use [[material recognition]] instead of/as well as a [[bar code scanner]] when needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reversevending.co.uk Description of use of a reverse vending machine from reVend, UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first patent for a "Bottle Return and Handling Machine" was filed in the United States in 1920.&lt;ref name="ReverseVending_About"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reversevending.co.uk/About_Reverse_Vending.html |title=About Reverse Vending Machines |publisher=Reverse Vending |accessdate=2014-09-12 |quote=The first patent for a “Empty Container Return and Handling Machine” with a coin return mechanism was filed in America on 13th September 1920 by Elmer M Jones and Sue Walker Vance. [...] The First working Bottle Return Machine was invented and manufactured by "Wicanders" from Sweden used in the late 1950's.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6419">The '''right to petition government for redress of grievances''' is the [[human rights|right]] to make a complaint to, or seek the assistance of, one's [[government]], without fear of punishment or reprisals, ensured by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (1791). Article 44 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] ensures the right to petition to the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights  of the European Union (2000)]], Article 44&lt;/ref&gt;  
The right can be traced back to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]], Article 17&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], the [[Petition of Right|Petition of Right  (1628)]], and [[Magna Carta|Magna Carta (1215)]].

==Jurisdictions==
===United States===
{{Main|Right to petition in the United States}}
The prohibition of abridgment of the "right to [[petition]]" originally referred only to the [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the [[US federal courts]]. The [[incorporation doctrine]] later expanded the protection of the right to its current scope, over all state and federal courts and legislatures, and the executive branches of the state&lt;ref name="ifac1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illinoisfirstamendmentcenter.com/petition.php |publisher=Illinois First Amendment Center |title=The Right to Petition |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411172748/http://www.illinoisfirstamendmentcenter.com/petition.php |archivedate=April 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and federal governments.

The right to petition includes, under its umbrella, the petition. For example, in January 2006, the US Senate considered S. 2180,&lt;ref name="s.2180"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/s2180|publisher=govtrack.us|title=Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; an omnibus "ethics reform" bill. This bill contained a provision (Section 204)&lt;ref name="section204"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/s2180/text/is#link=II_204_a_2_~Q1_18_~T1&amp;nearest=idDA833CD0144B4F8A95945AEBE61D69F8:|title=Section 204|publisher=govtrack.us}}{{citation broken|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to establish federal regulation, for the first time, of certain efforts to encourage "grassroots [[lobbying]]". The bill said that "'grassroots lobbying' means the voluntary efforts of members of the general public to communicate their own views on an issue to Federal officials or to encourage other members of the general public to do the same".

This provision was opposed by a broad array of organizations, including the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], the [[National Right to Life Committee]], and the [[National Rifle Association]].{{Citation needed|reason=source?|date=December 2011}} On January 18, 2007, the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] voted 55-43 to strike Section 221 from the bill.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

There are ongoing conflicts between organizations that wish to impose greater restrictions on citizen's attempts to influence or "lobby" policymakers.&lt;ref name="facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/petition/topic.aspx?topic=sue |publisher=First Amendment Center |first=Adam |last=Newton |title=Petition - Right to sue |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324191941/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/petition/topic.aspx?topic=sue |archivedate=March 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the right of individuals, groups, and corporations (via [[corporate personhood]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}), to [[lobbying|lobby]]&lt;ref name="ifac1"/&gt; the government.

Another controversial bill, the [[Executive Branch Reform Act (2007)|Executive Branch Reform Act]], H.R. 984, would require over 8,000 Executive Branch officials to report into a public database nearly any "significant contact" from any "private party", a term that the bill defines to include almost all persons other than government officials. The bill defines "significant contact" to be any "oral or written communication (including electronic communication) . . . in which the private party seeks to influence official action by any officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States." This covers all forms of [[communication]], one way or two ways, including [[Letter (message)|letters]], [[fax]]es, [[e-mail]]s, phone messages, and petitions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2619">In [[mathematics]], a '''shelling''' of a [[simplicial complex]] is a way of gluing it together from its maximal simplices (simplices that are not a face of another simplex) in a well-behaved way. A complex admitting a shelling is called '''shellable'''.

==Definition==
A ''d''-dimensional simplicial complex is called '''pure''' if its maximal simplices all have dimension ''d''. Let &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; be a finite or countably infinite simplicial complex. An ordering &lt;math&gt;C_1,C_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of the maximal simplices of &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is a '''shelling''' if the complex &lt;math&gt;B_k:=\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{k-1}C_i\right)\cap C_k&lt;/math&gt; is pure and &lt;math&gt;(\dim C_k-1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional for all &lt;math&gt;k=2,3,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the "new" simplex &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt; meets the previous simplices along some union &lt;math&gt;B_k&lt;/math&gt; of top-dimensional simplices of the boundary of &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;B_k&lt;/math&gt; is the entire boundary of &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt; is called '''spanning'''.

For &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; not necessarily countable, one can define a shelling as a well-ordering of the maximal simplices of &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; having analogous properties.

==Properties==
* A shellable complex is [[homotopy|homotopy equivalent]] to a [[wedge sum]] of [[n-sphere|spheres]], one for each spanning simplex and of corresponding dimension.
* A shellable complex may admit many different shellings, but the number of spanning simplices, and their dimensions, do not depend on the choice of shelling. This follows from the previous property.

==Examples==
* Every [[Coxeter complex]], and more generally every [[building (mathematics)|building]], is shellable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[File:Lar7 cogniet 001z.jpg|thumb|300px|The White flag of the [[Ancien Régime|French monarchy]] transformed into the Tricolore as a result of the [[July Revolution]], painting by [[Léon Cogniet]] (1830).]]

A '''tricolour''' or '''tricolor''' is a type of [[flag]] or [[banner]] design with a [[Triband (flag)|triband]] design which originated in the 16th century as a symbol of [[classical republicanism|republicanism]], [[liberty]] or indeed [[revolution]].  The [[Flag of France|flags of France]], [[Flag of Italy|Italy]], [[Flag of Romania|Romania]], [[Flag of Mexico|Mexico]], and [[Flag of Ireland|Ireland]] were all first adopted with the formation of an independent [[republic]] in the period of the [[French Revolution]] to the [[Revolutions of 1848]], with the exception of the Irish tricolour, which dates from 1848 but was not popularised until the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916 and adopted in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/tricolor|title=tricolor - definition of tricolor in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first association of the tricolour with republicanism is the orange-white-blue design of the [[Prince's Flag]] (''Prinsenvlag'', predecessor of the flags [[flag of the Netherlands|of the Netherlands]] and [[flag of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]]), used from 1579 by [[William I of Orange-Nassau]] in the [[Eighty Years' War]], establishing the independence of the [[Dutch Republic]] from the [[Spanish Empire]].
 
Though not the first tricolour flag, one of the most famous, known as ''Le Tricolore'', is the blue, white and red (whence also called ''Le Bleu-Blanc-Rouge'') [[flag of France]] adopted in the [[French Revolution]].

With the formation of [[French client republic]]s after 1795, the revolutionary tricolour was exported and adopted more widely in Europe, by 
the [[Republic of Alba]] 1796 (red-blue-yellow),
the [[Cisalpine Republic]] 1797    ([[Transpadane Republic]], green-white-red),
the [[Cisrhenian Republic]] 1797 (green-white-red),
the [[Anconine Republic]] 1797  (blue-yellow-red),
the [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] 1798 (black-white-red),
the [[Helvetic Republic]] 1798 (green-yellow-red; [[canton of Neuchatel]] 1848), 
the [[Parthenopean Republic]] 1799 (blue-yellow-red), 
the [[Principality of Lucca and Piombino]] 1805 (blue-white-red). Thus providing the format for most of modern Europe's national flags, from the [[flag of Italy]], to the [[flag of Germany]], [[flag of Ireland]], [[flag of Belgium]], [[flag of Romania]], [[flag of Bulgaria]], [[flag of Moldova]], and others around the World such as the [[flag of Cameroon]], [[flag of Chad]], [[flag of Ivory Coast]], [[flag of Gabon]], [[flag of Guinea]], [[flag of Mali]], and [[flag of Nigeria]].

The green-white-red tricolour remained a symbol of republicanism throughout the 19th century and was adopted as [[national flag]] by a number of states following the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. It was also adopted by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (inherited by the [[Kingdom of Italy]] 1861).

The [[flag of Germany]] (black-red-gold) originated as the flag of the revolutionary, anti-monarchist [[Freikorps]] of the 1830s and was later adopted by the republicanist bourgeoisie, at the time known as ''Dreifarb'', a German calque of ''Tricolore''. This flag was a symbol of opposition against the German ''[[Kleinstaaterei]]'' and the desire for [[German Unification]]. It was at first illegal in the [[German Confederation]], but was adopted as the national flag at the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] of 1848/9. The [[flag of Belgium]] was introduced in a similar context, in 1831, its colours taken from the flag used in the [[Brabant Revolution]] of 1789.
The first national flag of the [[New World]] inspired by this symbolism was the [[flag of Mexico]], adopted when the [[First Mexican Empire]] gained [[Mexican War of Independence|independence from Spain]] in 1821.

After 1848, the young republican [[nation state]]s continued to pick triband designs, but now more prevalently expressing the sentiment of [[nationalism]] or [[ethnic identity]] than anti-monarchism, the [[flag of Hungary]] (1848),&lt;!--hard to argue the Hungarian revolution was anti-monarchist as they chose the colours of the old Hungarian royal coat of arms. It was nationalist because they wanted to get rid of the *foreign* (Austrian) monarchs, but their own monarchy was sufficiently removed not to clash with the republican sentiment. Sources needed.--&gt;
the [[flag of Romania]] (1848), &lt;!--apparently also royal colours, of [[Michael the Brave]]--&gt;
the [[Flag of Ireland]] (1848),
the [[flag of Estonia]] (1880s),
the [[flag of Lithuania]] (1905),
and the [[flag of Armenia]] (1918). &lt;!--although this was based on a royal design, of the [[Rubenid Dynasty]]--&gt;
By contrast, the [[flag of Russia]] was adopted by the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in the late 17th century and while it may or may not have been inspired by the Dutch tricolour, it never had any republican implications.

The political ideology of the unification of an ethnic [[nation state]] associated with tricolour flags since the 19th century has resulted in the design of new "tricolours" expressing specific [[nationalism]]s in the 20th century, 
the [[Pan-African colours]] adopted in the 1920s for [[Pan-Africanism]], chosen in numerous African flags during [[Decolonization|decolonisation]] (green-yellow-red, taken from the triband design used by the [[Solomonic dynasty]] for the [[Ethiopian Empire]] since 1897). The [[Pan-Arab colors|Pan-Arab colours]] adopted in [[Arab nationalism]] 1916 are a comparable concept, even though they combine four, not three, colours.
Also in the 20th century, [[Pan-Iranian colours]] for [[Iranian nationalism]] and [[Pan-Slavic colors|Pan-Slavic colours]] for [[Pan-Slavism|Slavic nationalism]] were adopted based on the triband design of the flags used during the 19th century by the [[Qajar dynasty]] and the [[Russian Empire]], respectively.

The [[Indian independence movement]] in 1931 also adopted a tricolour (loan-translated as Hindi, तिरंगा ''Tiraṅgā'') in the traditional symbolism of "national unification" and republican "self-rule" ([[Purna Swaraj]]), adopted as the [[Flag of India|flag of the Indian Republic]] in 1947.

In 1999, a red, green, and blue tricolour was proposed as the [[Flag of Mars]]. The design symbolizes [[liberty]], and also the [[terraforming of Mars]] by [[human]]ity from a red planet to a green one, and eventually an Earth-like blue one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2392">In [[mathematics]], a '''trivial semigroup''' (a  '''semigroup with one element''') is a [[semigroup]] for which the [[cardinality]] of the [[underlying set]] is [[one]]. The number of [[Distinct (mathematics)|distinct]] [[isomorphic|nonisomorphic]] semigroups with one element is one. If ''S'' = { ''a'' } is a semigroup with one element then the [[Cayley table]] of ''S'' is as given below:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! 
! ''a''
|-
|&amp;nbsp; ''' ''a'' '''&amp;nbsp; 
|&amp;nbsp; ''a'' &amp;nbsp;  
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The only element in ''S'' is the [[Absorbing element|zero element]] 0 of ''S'' and is also the [[identity element]] 1 of ''S''.&lt;ref&gt;A H Clifford, G B Preston (1964). ''The Algebraic Theory of Semigroups Vol. I'' (Second Edition). [[American Mathematical Society]].  {{ISBN|978-0-8218-0272-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However not all semigroup theorists consider the unique element in a semigroup with one element as the zero element of the semigroup. They define zero elements only in semigroups having at least two elements.&lt;ref&gt;
P A Grillet (1995). ''Semigroups''. [[CRC Press]].  {{ISBN|978-0-8247-9662-4}} pp.3-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J M Howie|title=An Introduction to Semigroup Theory|publisher=Academic Press|year=1976|series=L.M.S.Monographs|volume=7}} pp.2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of its extreme triviality, the semigroup with one element is important in many situations. It is the starting point for understanding the [[structure]] of semigroups. It serves as a [[counterexample]] in illuminating many situations. For example, the semigroup with one element is the only semigroup in which 0 = 1, that is, the zero element and the identity element are equal. 
Further, if ''S'' is a semigroup with one element, the semigroup obtained by adjoining an identity element to ''S'' is isomorphic to the semigroup obtained by adjoining a zero element to ''S''.

The semigroup with one element is also a [[group (mathematics)|group]].

In the language of [[category theory]], any semigroup with one element is a [[Initial and terminal objects|terminal object]] in the category of semigroups.

An '''unrestricted algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] for the computation of a mathematical function that puts no restrictions on the range of the argument or on the precision that may be demanded in the result.&lt;ref name="Clenshaw"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=C.W. Clenshaw and F. W. J. Olver|title=An unrestricted algorithm for the exponential function|journal=SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis|date=April 1980|volume= 17|issue=2|pages=310–331|jstor=2156615}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of such an algorithm was put forward by C. W. Clenshaw and F. W. J. Olver in a paper published in 1980.&lt;ref name=Clenshaw/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brent"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richard P Brent|chapter=Unrestricted algorithms for elementary and special functions|title=Information Processing |volume=80  |editor=S. H. Lavington |publisher=North-Holland, Amsterdam|date=1980|pages=613–619|arxiv=1004.3621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the problem of developing algorithms for computing the values of a real-valued function of a real variable, say ''g''(''x''), in "restricted" algorithms, the error that can be tolerated in the result is specified in advance. An interval on the real line would also be specified for values where in the values of function are to be evaluated. Different algorithms may have to applied for evaluating functions outside the interval. An unrestricted algorithm envisages a situation in which a user may stipulate the value of ''x'' and also the precision required in ''g''(''x''), quite arbitrarily. The algorithm should then produce an acceptable result without failure.&lt;ref name = Clenshaw/&gt;

==In practice==

In one study,&lt;ref&gt;Dhebar, B. B., &amp; Stokes, B. (2008). A nonprofit manager's guide to online volunteering. Nonprofit Management and Leadership, 18 (4), 497–506.&lt;/ref&gt; over 70 per cent of online volunteers chose assignments requiring one to five hours a week and nearly half chose assignments lasting 12 weeks or less.  Some organizations offer online volunteering opportunities which last from ten minutes to an hour. A unique feature of online volunteering is that it can be done from a distance. People with restricted mobility or other special needs participate in ways that might not be possible in traditional face-to-face volunteering. Likewise, online volunteering may allow people to overcome social inhibitions and [[social anxiety]], particularly if they would normally experience disability-related labeling or stereotyping. This empowers people who might not otherwise volunteer. It can build [[self-confidence]] and [[self-esteem]] while enhancing skills and extending networks and social ties.  Online volunteering also allows participants to adapt their program of volunteer work to their unique skills and passions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;State of the World's Volunteerism Report 2011: Universal Values for Global Well-being, United Nations Volunteers, {{ISBN|978-9211012460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People engaged in virtual volunteering undertake a variety of activities from locations remote to the organization or people they are assisting, via a computer or other Internet-connected device, such as:

* researching subjects (e.g. for [[Wikia]] projects)
* writing software (see [[open-source software]] which is often made by volunteers)
* fixing software (e.g. [[Community patch]]es)
* creating [[web page]]s
* editing or writing proposals, press releases, newsletter articles, etc.
* translating documents (e.g. [[Fan translation]]s)
* developing material for a curriculum
* designing a [[database]]
* designing [[graphics]]
* scanning documents
* providing legal, business, medical, agricultural or any other expertise
* counseling people
* [[Online tutoring|tutoring]] or [[E-mentoring|mentoring]] students
* moderating [[online discussion]] groups
* writing songs
* creating a [[podcast]]
* editing a video
* monitoring the news
* [[Internet Pastoral care]]
* answering questions
* [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]] photos and files
* managing other online volunteers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aidsvolunteers.ca/vvfacts/general.html#examples |title=What are examples of virtual volunteering? |accessdate=5 October 2009 |publisher=AIDSvolunteers.ca |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701081617/http://www.aidsvolunteers.ca/vvfacts/general.html#examples |archive-date=1 July 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.serviceleader.org/old/vv/examples.html |title=examples of virtual volunteering |accessdate=5 October 2009 |publisher=University of Texas at Austin |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519041848/http://www.serviceleader.org/old/vv/examples.html |archivedate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theextraordinaries.org/2008/11/make-a-difference-from-home-be-a-virtual-volunteer.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903075911/http://www.theextraordinaries.org/2008/11/make-a-difference-from-home-be-a-virtual-volunteer.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 September 2009 |title=Make a Difference From Home: Be a Virtual Volunteer |accessdate=5 October 2009 |publisher=theextraordinaries.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the developing world, innovative synergies between volunteerism and technology typically focus on [[mobile communication]] technologies rather than the Internet. Around 26 per cent of people worldwide had Internet access in 2009. However, Internet penetration in low-income countries was only 18 per cent, compared to over 64 per cent in developed countries. While the costs of fixed broadband Internet are falling, access still remains unaffordable to many.&lt;ref&gt;International Telecommunication Union (ITU). (2010). Measuring the information society . Geneva, Switzerland: ITU&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, online volunteering is developing rapidly. Online volunteers are "people who commit their time and skills over the Internet, freely and without financial considerations, for the benefit of society."&lt;ref&gt;Dhebar &amp; Stokes, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Online volunteering has eliminated the need for volunteerism to be tied to specific times and locations. Thus, it greatly increases the freedom and flexibility of volunteer engagement and complements the outreach and impact of volunteers serving in situ. Most online volunteers engage in operational and managerial activities such as fundraising, technological support, communications, marketing and consulting. Increasingly, they also engage in activities such as research and
writing and leading e-mail discussion groups.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Online ''[[micro-volunteering]]'' is also an example of virtual volunteering and [[crowdsourcing]], where volunteers undertake assignments via their [[PDA]]s or [[smartphones]]. These volunteers either aren't required to undergo any screening or training by the nonprofit for such tasks, and do not have to make any other commitment when a micro-task is completed, or, have already undergone screening or training by the nonprofit, and are therefore approved to take on micro-tasks as their availability and interests allow. Online micro-volunteering was originally called "byte-sized volunteering" by the Virtual Volunteering Project, and has always been a part of the more than 30-year-old practice of online volunteering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nonprofit.about.com/od/volunteers/a/microvol.htm |title=Volunteering - Get the Most From Volunteer Experience |publisher=Nonprofit.about.com |date=2014-05-14 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early example of both micro-volunteering and crowdsourcing is [[ClickWorkers]], a small NASA project begun in 2001 that engaged online volunteers in scientific-related tasks that required just a person's perception and common sense, but not scientific training, such as identifying craters on Mars in photos the project posted online; volunteers were not trained or screened before participating. The phrase "micro-volunteering" is usually credited to a San Francisco-based nonprofit called The Extraordinaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weeks |first=Linton |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106118736 |title=The Extraordinaries: Will Microvolunteering Work? |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Amy Farnsworth |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Responsible-Tech/2009/0804/smart-phone-app-lets-you-do-good-deeds-in-your-spare-time |title=Smart-phone app lets you do good deeds in your spare time |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/assignment_7&amp;id=7162300 |title=San Francisco-based website offers micro-volunteering platform &amp;#124; abc7news.com |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=2009-12-09 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==

The practice of virtual volunteering to benefit nonprofit initiatives dates back to at least the early 1970s, when [[Project Gutenberg]] began involving online volunteers to provide electronic versions of works in the public domain.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, a new [[nonprofit organization]] called [[Impact Online]] (now called [[VolunteerMatch]]), based in Palo Alto, California, began promoting the idea of "virtual volunteers".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Impact Online received a grant from the [[James Irvine Foundation]] to launch an initiative to research the practice of virtual volunteering and to promote the practice to nonprofit organizations in the US. This new initiative was dubbed the [[Virtual Volunteering Project]], and the web site was launched in early 1997.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; After one year of operations, the Virtual Volunteering Project moved to the Charles A. Dana Center at [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]]. In 2002, the Virtual Volunteering Project moved within the university to the [[Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs]]. The first two years of the Virtual Volunteer Project were spent reviewing and adapting [[telecommuting]] manuals&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and existing volunteer management guidelines with regarding to virtual volunteering, as well as identifying organizations that were involving online volunteers. By April 1999, almost 100 organizations had been identified by the Virtual Volunteering Project as involving online volunteers and were listed on the web site.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the growing numbers of nonprofit organizations, schools, government programs and other not-for-profit entities involving online volunteers, the Virtual Volunteering Project stopped listing every such organization involving online volunteers on its web site in 2000, and focused its efforts on promoting the practice, profiling organizations with large or unique online volunteering programs, and creating guidelines for the involvement of online volunteers. Until January 2001, the Virtual Volunteering Project listed all telementoring and teletutoring programs in the USA (programs where online volunteers mentor or tutor others, through a nonprofit organization or school). At that time, 40 were identified.&lt;ref&gt;

In August 1999, the [[NetAid|NetAid.org]] initiative was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative included an online volunteering component, today known as the [[United Nations Volunteers#Online Volunteering|UN Online Volunteering service]]. It went live in 2000 and has been managed by [[United Nations Volunteers]] since its inception. It quickly attracted a high number of people ready to support organizations working for development. In 2003, several thousand people already contributed to the UN's Online Volunteering service – volunteers with very diverse backgrounds, including university graduates, private sector employees, and retirees.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; While the UN's Online Volunteering service became independent, NetAid continued as a joint project of [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] and Cisco Systems. It aimed "to utilize the unique networking capabilities of the Internet to promote development and alleviate extreme poverty across the world".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current state==

Online volunteering has been adopted by thousands of nonprofit organizations and other initiatives.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; There is no organization currently tracking best practices in online volunteering in the USA or worldwide, how many people are engaged in online volunteering, or how many organizations utilize online volunteers, and studies regarding volunteering, such as reports on volunteering trends in the USA, rarely include information about online volunteering (for example, a search of the term ''virtual volunteering'' on the [[Corporation for National Service]]'s "Volunteering in America" yields no results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Volunteering and Civic Life in America |url=http://www.volunteeringinamerica.gov/ |title=volunteeringinamerica.gov. Retrieved 24 September 2009 |publisher=Volunteeringinamerica.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On IVCO's Forum Discussion Paper 2015&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivco2015.org/conference/document/1005_Global_indicators_to_measure_volunteer_impact(Megan,%20Peter).pdf Megan Haddock &amp; Peter Devereux, Forum Discussion Paper 2015: Documenting the Contribution of Volunteering to the SDGs]&lt;/ref&gt; it is recommended that a collective measurement tool developed as part of a global measurement framework should also capture online volunteering.

The [[United Nations Volunteers#Online Volunteering|UN's Online Volunteering service]] connects organizations working in or for the developing world with online volunteers. It does have statistics available regarding numbers of online volunteers and involving organizations (i.e. NGOs, other civil society organizations, a government or other public institutions, United Nations agencies or other intergovernmental institutions) that collaborate online via their platform. In 2013, all 17,370 online volunteering assignments offered by development organizations through the Online Volunteering service attracted applications from numerous qualified volunteers. About 58 percent of the 11,037 online volunteers were women, and 60 percent came from developing countries; on average, they were 30 years of age. More than 94 percent of organizations and online volunteers rated their collaboration as good or excellent in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;About the UNV Online Volunteering service, Statistics: https://onlinevolunteering.org/en/org/about/statistics.html&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Non-governmental organization|civil society organizations]] with limited resources in particular, the impact of online volunteer engagement is significant: 41% involve UN Online Volunteers for technical expertise that is not available internally. According to the same impact evaluation carried out in 2014, in many instances, organizations without access to online volunteers would have difficulties achieving their own peace and development outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unv.org/annual-report-2014/pdf/Chapter_6.pdf UNV Annual Report 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, UNV unveiled a redesigned website and launched two additional services: The 1-click query to allow organizations to reach out to half a million people to provide real-time data for their projects, and its new employee online volunteering solution for global companies. Inclusive multi-stakeholder partnerships emerged as a necessity to achieve the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs), and the first private sector partner of the Online Volunteering service is based in Brazil ([[Samsung Electronics]] Latin American Office).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unv.org/news/samsung-and-unv-announce-innovative-partnership-promote-volunteerism-achieving-sustainable|title=Samsung and UNV announce an innovative partnership to promote volunteerism for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - UNV|work=unv.org|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other matching services, such as [[VolunteerMatch]] and [[Idealist (organization)|Idealist]], also offer virtual volunteering positions with nonprofit organizations in addition to traditional, on-site volunteering opportunities. VolunteerMatch currently reports that about 5 percent of its active volunteer listings are virtual in nature. As of June 2010, its directory included more than 2,770 such listings including roles in interactive marketing, fundraising, accounting, social media, and business mentoring. The percentage of virtual listings has dropped since 2006, when it peaked at close to 8 percent of overall volunteer opportunities in the VolunteerMatch system.

[[Wikipedia]] and other [[Wikimedia Foundation]] endeavors are examples of online volunteering, in the form of crowdsourcing or micro-volunteering; the majority of Wikipedia contributing volunteers aren't required to undergo any screening or training by the nonprofit for their role as researchers, writers or editors, and do not have to make a specific time commitment to the organization in order to contribute service.

Many organizations involved in virtual volunteering might never mention the term, or the words "online volunteer," on their web sites or in organizational literature. For example, the nonprofit organization Business Council for Peace ([[Bpeace]]) recruits business professionals to donate their time mentoring entrepreneurs in conflict-affected countries, including [[Afghanistan]] and [[Rwanda]], but the majority of these volunteers interact with Bpeace staff and entrepreneurs online rather than face-to-face; yet, the term virtual volunteering is not mentioned on the web site. Bpeace also engages in online micro-volunteering, asking for information leads from its supporters, such as where to find online communities of particular professionals in the USA, but the organization never mentions the term micro-volunteering on its web site.  Another example is the [[Electronic Emissary]], one of the first K-12 online mentoring programs, launched in 1992; the web site does not use the phrase virtual volunteering and prefers to call online volunteers online [[subject matter expert]]s.

Evolving forms of volunteerism will enhance opportunities for people to volunteer. The spread of technology connects ever more rural and isolated areas. NGOs and governments are beginning to realise the value of South-to-South international volunteerism, as well as diaspora volunteering, and are dedicating resources to these schemes. Corporations are responding to the "social marketplace" by supporting [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] initiatives that include volunteerism. New opportunities for engaging in volunteerism are opening up with the result that more people are becoming involved and those already participating can expand their commitment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A phenomenon that is still quite new, but growing rapidly, is the formal integration of online employee volunteering programmes into the infrastructure and business plan of companies.
