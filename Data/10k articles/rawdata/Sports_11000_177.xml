The '''1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games''' were held in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada, from 30 July to 7 August 1954. These were the first games since the name change from [[British Empire Games]] took effect in 1952.

It was at these games that the "Miracle Mile" took place between [[Roger Bannister]] and [[John Landy]] at [[Empire Stadium (Vancouver)|Empire Stadium]]. This was the first time these two (and at that time the only two) sub-[[four-minute mile]] runners appeared in the same race, and also the first time two runners broke four minutes in the same race. On the same afternoon, [[James Peters (athlete)|Jim Peters]], the holder of the world best time for the marathon, entered the stadium 17 minutes ahead of his nearest rival, but collapsed on his final lap, and never completed the race.

The games were attended by 24 nations and 662 competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecgf.com/games/intro.asp?yr=1954|title=Commonwealth Games Federation - 1954 Commonwealth Games - Introduction|last=|first=|date=|website=www.thecgf.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615095819/http://thecgf.com/games/intro.asp?yr=1954|archive-date=15 June 2017|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-05-06|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2010 Honda Indy Edmonton''' was an [[INDYCAR|IndyCar]] motor race held on July 25, 2010 at the [[Edmonton City Centre (Blatchford Field) Airport|Edmonton City Centre Airport]], [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada. It was the eleventh round of the [[2010 IndyCar Series season]], the third annual edition of the [[Edmonton Indy]] in the IndyCar Series, and the sixth anniversary running of the race (including three years on the [[Champ Car|Champ Car World Series]] (CCWS) schedule). The 95-lap race was won by [[Chip Ganassi Racing]] driver [[Scott Dixon]], who started from the third position. [[Will Power]] finished second for [[Team Penske]] and Dixon's teammate [[Dario Franchitti]] came in third.

Power, the defending champion of the Honda Indy Edmonton, won the [[pole position]] by posting the fastest lap in qualifying. In the race, Power maintained the first position throughout most of the event but was passed by teammate [[Hélio Castroneves]] with eighteen laps remaining. On the race's final restart on lap 92, Power attempted to reclaim the lead from Castroneves but the latter defended his position and was issued with a drive-through penalty. He chose not to take it and was demoted to tenth and the victory was awarded to Dixon.

There were four cautions and four lead changes among three different drivers during the race. It was Dixon's second win of the season, and the twenty-third of his career. The result meant Power extended his lead in the Drivers' Championship to 50 points over Franchitti, and 71 in front of Dixon, with six races of the season remaining.

The Honda Indy Edmonton was confirmed as a part of the [[Indy Racing League]]'s (IRL) 2010 schedule for the IndyCar Series in December 2009 after [[Edmonton City Council]] voted to keep the race on the calendar despite incurring losses of $9.2 million over the previous two seasons.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/city-to-go-ahead-with-2010-indy-1.811518|title=City to go ahead with 2010 Indy|date=December 7, 2009|website=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC Edmonton]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525064916/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/city-to-go-ahead-with-2010-indy-1.811518|archive-date=May 25, 2016|access-date=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be the third consecutive year the race was held in the series, and the sixth Edmonton Indy counting the period from 2005 to 2007 when it was a [[Champ Car|Champ Car World Series]] (CCWS) event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flagworld.com/news/2010/07/23/honda-indy-edmonton-preview/|title=Honda Indy Edmonton preview|date=July 23, 2010|website=Flag World|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915190247/http://www.flagworld.com/news/2010/07/23/honda-indy-edmonton-preview/|archive-date=September 15, 2015|access-date=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be the second consecutive round held in Canada, following the [[2010 Honda Indy Toronto|Honda Indy Toronto]] the previous week.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/motor-sports/indycar-series-announces-2010-schedule|title=IndyCar Series announces 2010 schedule|date=July 31, 2009|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525044218/http://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/motor-sports/indycar-series-announces-2010-schedule|archive-date=May 25, 2016|access-date=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tire supplier [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] brought three types to tire to the race: two dry compounds (black-sidewall "Primary" and red-banded "Alternate") and grooved rain tires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/edmonton-firestone-racing-preview-2010-07-22/?s=1|title=Edmonton: Firestone Racing preview|date=July 22, 2010|website=[[motorsport.com]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604072251/http://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/edmonton-firestone-racing-preview-2010-07-22/?s=1|archive-date=June 4, 2016|access-date=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The race began at 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time,&lt;ref name=schedule/&gt; and was televised live in the United States on [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]].

On lap two, Tracy made contact with Matos' rear-end in turn two who was sent spinning into the infield grass and Matos drove cautiously to the pit lane with a flat left-rear tire. Scheckter's front wing was damaged on lap 10 for which he made a [[pit stop]] for a replacement nose cone.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; After starting fifteenth, Tracy drove aggressively and moved up into tenth position by the 20th lap.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[File:Scott Dixon - 2011 Baltimore Grand Prix.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Scott Dixon ''(pictured in 2011)'' won the race after [[Hélio Castroneves]] was demoted for blocking Will Power.]]

Briscoe passed the Chip Ganassi Racing drivers after they were held up by slower cars to move into second place on lap 29. [[Racing flags#Green flag|Green-flag]] pit stops began four laps later. Wilson spun at the end of the backstretch while braking for turn ten on the 36th lap after his right-rear shock absorber failed and drove slowly to his pit box to repair damage to his vehicle. [[Danica Patrick]] attempted to pass Baugette around the [[Racing line|inside]] on lap 39, but lost control of her car and ran wide into the infield grass section and rejoined the track in 17th without damaging her [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]]. Andretti's front wing came apart on lap 46 while holding up four cars, and Scheckter ran wide as the four cars passed Andretti. The first full course caution of the event was necessitated on the following lap when [[Alex Lloyd (racing driver)|Alex Lloyd]] spun into the grass and [[Stall (engine)|stalled]] his engine. Andretti made a pit stop for a replacement front wing during the caution. Racing resumed at the start of lap 51 with Power leading Castroneves, Briscoe and Dixon. Shortly afterward, de Silvestro was hit from behind by Viso who overheated his brakes, and went into the turn one tyre barrier, causing the second caution. Viso avoided making contact with teammate Tracy (who took avoiding action) on the same lap.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Viso was issued with a drive-through penalty and rejoined in tenth position. The race resumed on lap 54 with Power retaining his lead. The race's third caution was issued shortly after the restart when Kanaan made light contact with the side of Tagilani who spun. [[Mario Romancini]] was blinded by smoke that came from the incident and was hit by the recovering Tagilani. Both cars sustained heavy damage and retired but Kanaan was able to continue without apparent damage. Power led the field back up to speed at the lap-58 [[Rolling start|restart]]. Briscoe fell behind the two Chip Ganassi Racing drivers, while Tracy moved past Hunter-Reay for sixth place. The second (and final) round of green-flag pit stops started on the 63rd lap; Tracy and Hunter-Reay made their pit stops over the next five laps in the hope a caution flag would be shown that would allow the pair to lead the race.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; After the pit stops, Power remained in the first position,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and had the Alternate tires fitted on his car.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crash.net/indycar/race-report/163382/2/helio-fumes-as-penalty-hands-win-to-dixon.html|title=Scott Dixon wins in Edmonton|date=July 25, 2010|website=crash.net|page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525134206/http://www.crash.net/indycar/race-report/163382/2/helio-fumes-as-penalty-hands-win-to-dixon.html|archive-date=May 25, 2016|access-date=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ahead of Castroneves and Dixon.&lt;ref name="Lapchart" /&gt;

On the 77th lap, Power and teammate Castroneves (on the Primary tires) encountered slower cars, and the latter took advantage of the situation which allowed him to overtake Power for the lead. Castroneves began to pull away from Power. Ten laps later, de Silvestro's car ran out of fuel and pulled over to the side of the track onto the infield grass to retire from the race which prompted the fourth (and final) caution. Racing resumed when the [[Safety|pace car]] drove into the pit lane at the start of lap 92. Power went onto the outside lane at the entrance of the first turn, and Castroneves drove left as a blocking manoeuvre. Castroneves accelerated out of the corner's exit which caused Power to run wide. Dixon took advantage of the situation and passed Power around the outside to take over second place.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The move was immediately reviewed by the IndyCar chief steward and competition president [[Brian Barnhart]], which led to Castroneves being shown a black-flag a minute later as he was deemed as having blocked Power.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; Castroneves was informed that he was issued with a drive-through penalty, but opted to remain on the track for the final two laps and crossed the start-finish line first on the road.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/racing/racing/indycar/columns/story?id=5410635&amp;columnist=oreovicz_john|title=IndyCar Series gripped by controversy|last=Oreovicz|first=John|date=July 27, 2010|website=[[ESPN]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525125555/http://espn.go.com/racing/racing/indycar/columns/story?id=5410635&amp;columnist=oreovicz_john|archive-date=May 25, 2016|access-date=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Castroneves had not taken his penalty, the victory was awarded to Dixon,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; with Power in second and Franchitti third. Briscoe was fourth, and Hunter-Reay held off Tracy to claim fifth.

Castroneves was upset about the penalty and leapt from his car and yelled in anger at the flagman (looking for an explanation) and grabbed the Head of Security Charles Burns as he sought an answer. He argued that he did not change his line: "I actually gave him room outside. When you go side by side like that with your teammate and the guy [Barnhart] has just swept ... literally, literally just takes it away from you ... it's just absurd."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Castroneves was fined $60,000 by the IRL for "unsportsmanlike conduct" and was placed on probation for the rest of the season.

[[Image:Western Australian Coat of Arms.svg|thumb|right|200px|Western Australian coat-of-arms]]
The [[black swan]] (''Cygnus atratus'') is widely referenced in [[Australia]]n culture, although the character of that importance historically diverges between the prosaic in the East and the symbolic in West. The black swan is also of spiritual significance in the traditional histories of many [[Indigenous Australians|Australian Aboriginal peoples]] across southern Australia. Metaphoric references to black [[swan]]s have appeared in [[Europe]]an culture since long before the real-life discovery of ''Cygnus atratus'' in Australia in the 18th century.

The black swan is the official state [[emblem]] of [[Western Australia]] and is depicted on the [[flag of Western Australia]], as well as being depicted on the [[:Image:Western Australia coa.png|Western Australian coat-of-arms]]. The symbol is used in other emblems, [[coin]]s, [[logo]]s, [[mascot]]s and in the naming of [[sport]]s teams.

== Aboriginal history and lore ==
[[File:Tommy McRae After swans.jpg|thumb|Aboriginal hunters and black swan, by [[Tommy McRae]], v. 1865]]
[[Daisy Bates (Australia)|Daisy Bates]] recorded a nyoongar man called Woolberr  "last of the black swan group" of the [[Noongar|Nyungar]] people of south-western Australia in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, D.M.
'Woolberr: the last of the black swan group', in the ''Australasian'', 3 May 1927. Totemic ceremony of the black swan of the Bibbulmun group; the life story of native who was born during an initiation ceremony (AIATSIS)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://coombs.anu.edu.au/WWWVLPages/AborigPages/LANG/WA/contents.htm#contents Aboriginal Pages]&lt;/ref&gt; The website of the Premier of Western Australia refers to Nyungar lore of how the ancestors of the Nyungar people were once black swans who became men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpc.wa.gov.au/index.cfm?event=symbolsWaSwan Western Australian Government] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213944/http://www.dpc.wa.gov.au/index.cfm?event=symbolsWaSwan |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dreamtime]] story of the black swans tells how two brothers were turned into white swans so they could help an attack party during a raid for weapons. It is said that [[Wurrunna]] used a large [[gubbera]], or crystal stone, to transform the men. After the raid, eaglehawks attacked the white swans and tore feathers from the birds. Crows who were enemies of the eaglehawks came to the aid of the brothers and gave the black swans their own black feathers. The black swan's red beak is said to be the blood of the attacked brothers, which stayed there forever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.didgeridoos.net.au/dreamtime%20stories/swans.html THE BLACK SWANS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214154539/http://www.didgeridoos.net.au/dreamtime%20stories/swans.html |date=14 February 2008 }} (extracted from Australian Legendary Tales, by [[K Langloh Parker]]). Retrieved 2007-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The moral code embedded in Aboriginal lore is evident in a story from an unspecified locality in eastern Australia (probably in New South Wales) published in 1943. An Aboriginal man, fishing in a lagoon, caught a baby bunyip. Instead of returning the baby to the water, he wanted to take the bunyip back to the camp to boast of his fishing prowess, against the urging of his friends. Before he could do anything, the mother [[bunyip]] rose from the water, flooding swirling water around them, and took back her baby. As the water receded, the men found that they had been changed into black swans. As punishment for the fisherman's vanity, they never regained their human form, but could be heard at night talking in human voices as a reminder to their human relatives of the perils of pride and arrogance.&lt;ref&gt;Hurley, P.J., ''In Search of Australia'', Dymocks Book Arcade Ltd., Sydney 1943: 131&lt;/ref&gt;

== European myth and metaphor ==
The Roman satirist [[Juvenal]] wrote in AD 82 of ''rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno'' ("a rare bird in the lands, and very like a black swan").&lt;ref&gt;Morris, E.E. (Ed), ''Austral English'', Melbourne 1898; facsimile as ''Morris’s Dictionary of Australian Words'', John Currey O’Neil Publishers, Adelaide 1982: 451&lt;/ref&gt; He meant something whose rarity would compare with that of a black swan, or in other words, as a black swan did not exist, neither did the supposed characteristics of the "rare bird" with which it was being compared. The phrase passed into several European languages as a popular [[proverb]], including English, in which the first four words ("a rare bird in the land") are often used ironically. For some 1500 years, the black swan existed in the European imagination as a [[metaphor]] for that which could not exist.

The Dutch explorer [[Willem de Vlamingh]] made the first European record of sighting a black swan in 1697, when he sailed into, and named, the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] on the western coast of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. The sighting was significant in Europe, where "all swans are white" had long been used as a standard example of a well-known truth. In 1726, two birds were captured near [[Dirk Hartog Island]], {{convert|850|km}} north of the Swan River, and taken to Batavia (now [[Jakarta]]) as proof of their existence.&lt;ref name="Morris_1898"&gt;{{cite book  |publisher= Viking |title=Morris's Dictionary of Australian Words, Names and Phrases |last=Morris |first=Edward E. |date=1898|isbn=0670900370}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|451}}

[[Arthur Phillip|Governor Phillip]], soon after establishing the [[Convictism in Australia|convict settlement]] some sixty years later and {{convert|3000|km}} away at [[Botany Bay]] on the east coast, wrote in 1789 that "A black swan, which species, though proverbially rare in other parts of the world, is here by no means uncommon ... a very noble bird, larger than the common swan, and equally beautiful in form ... its wings were edged with white: the bill was tinged with red."&lt;ref name="Morris_1898" /&gt; A contemporary, [[John White (surgeon)|Surgeon-General John White]], observed in 1790, "We found nine birds, that, whilst swimming, most perfectly resembled the rara avis of the ancients, a black swan."&lt;ref name="Morris_1898" /&gt;

The taking of black swans to Europe in the 18th and early 19th centuries brought the birds into contact with another aspect of European mythology: the attribution of sinister relationships between the devil and black-coloured animals, such as a [[black cat]]. Black swans were considered to be a witch's [[familiar spirit|familiar]] and often chased away or killed by superstitious folk. This may explain why black swans have never established a sizeable presence as feral animals in Europe or North America.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Sir Peter (Ed), ''The World Atlas of Birds'', Colporteur Press, Balmain 1982: 200&lt;/ref&gt;

While the European encounter with the black swan along Australia's west coast in the late 17th and early 18th centuries led to the shattering of an age-old metaphor, their contact on the east coast in the late 18th and early 19th centuries merely confirmed the new post-proverbial view, before turning to account for the black swan as just one more [[curiosity]] in the South to be utilised in developing the colonies.

In [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Swan Lake]]'', the sinister and seductive black swan, Odile, is contrasted with the innocent white swan, Odette.

== Western Australia ==

=== Heraldry ===
The [[coat of arms of Western Australia]] includes a black swan as the principal charge on the shield. A black swan on a gold plate or disk has been the official badge of the state since 1876, and is shown on the [[flag of Western Australia]].  The [[coat of arms of Australia]] (1912 version) shows, in its fifth quarter, the black swan on a gold field, representing the state as one of the original states in the federation.
[[Image:WA-1955-unofficial-cygnis.jpg|thumb|280px|Image from a Western Australia Planning Commission document; the motto refers to black swans.]]

Although the [[Coat of arms of Western Australia|State Arms]] were granted in 1969, municipal heraldry had already been using the black swan symbolism since 1926, when the [[coat of arms of Perth]] were granted with a black swan as a charge in the first quarter and black swan supporters. This was followed by [[Northam, Western Australia|Northam]] (1953, black swan crest) and [[City of Bunbury|Bunbury]] (1959, black swan crest). Following the grant of the State Arms, municipal arms continued this tradition: [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] (1971, charge), [[City of Gosnells|Gosnells]] (1978, charge), [[City of Melville|Melville]] (1981, supporters) and [[City of Subiaco|Subiaco]] (1984, crest). All of the municipal arms granted by the [[Monarchy in Australia|Crown]] have included a representation of a black swan, presumably acknowledging the allegiance of each municipality to the state.

In the history of the [[Western Australian Government Railways]] - the black swan emblem occurred between the 1920s to the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;Rob Clark ''The History of the 'Mucky Duck' ''pp.7 - 21, issue 263, 2009/10 -{{Citation | author1=Australian Railway Historical Society. Western Australian Division | title=The Westland | publication-date=1985 | publisher=The Division | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/19203023 | accessdate=27 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several state authorities have also been granted arms showing a black swan: St George's College at the [[University of Western Australia]] (1964, charges), Fremantle Port Authority (1965, crest), and the University of Western Australia (1972, charges). The university had used an assumed version of these arms since 1913, and the university's [[University of Western Australia Student Guild|student guild]] reaffirmed its assumption and use of a differenced version of the University Arms in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;''Annual Report 1991'', Guild of Undergraduates, University of Western Australia, Crawley 1992: 6&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities with assumed arms showing a black swan include [[Royal Perth Hospital]] (1936, charge), and the University of Western Australia residential colleges of St Thomas More (charge), Currie Hall (charge) and St Catherines (charge).

Religious authorities have also used representations of the black swan in their heraldic emblems. Of the two largest denominations in the state, there are the Anglican dioceses of Kalgoorlie (1956, charge) and [[Anglican Diocese of North West Australia|North-West Australia]] (1956, charge); and the [[Catholic bishops and archbishops of Perth, Western Australia|Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Perth]] (charge).

=== Philately ===
[[File:Australianstamp 1623.jpg|thumb|upright|1954 Australian stamp commemorating the first Western Australian stamp which featured the black swan]]
The [[History of Western Australia|Colony of Western Australia]] produced its first postage stamps in 1854, and in contrast to the usual practice within the [[British Empire]], they featured, not a portrait of [[Queen Victoria]], but an image of the black swan. The design of the stamp underwent several modifications over the next 48 years, until 1902, when the last design was produced, although the swan stamps continued in use until 1913, when Australian stamps superseded the colonial/state issues. The most famous of the series was the four-penny Blue [[Inverted Swan]] produced in 1855, in which the central image was printed upside down. The stamp is now an acknowledged philatelic rarity, with only fifteen known to have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Eastick, M., ''Comprehensive Colour Catalogue of Australian Stamps'', Victoria Stamp Traders, Malvern 2003: WA1-WA4&lt;/ref&gt; Stamp issues in all of the other British colonies in Australasia, such as [[Postage stamps and postal history of New South Wales|New South Wales]], featured royal portraits rather than local symbols, apart from some one-off commemorative issues.

=== Decorative arts ===
Black swans feature as emblems and decorations on most important public buildings in Western Australia. An example is the tower of the [[Fremantle Town Hall]].

The Wembley Ware range of "fancy ware" was produced between 1945 and 1961 by HL Brisbane and [[Wunderlich Ltd]]/Bristile in [[Subiaco, Western Australia|Subiaco]]. The Wembley Ware range typified the spirit of post-war buoyancy in Western Australia during the 1950s, with art ceramics specifically for a local market using emblems of local Westralian identity. The majority of the works were decorative rather than functional to escape high taxes on purely decorative ceramics at this time and exploited highly coloured glazes and overtly Australian content in their designs. The majority of Wembley Ware was created with an apparent intended purpose such as vases, ashtrays or lamps, but these were usually superfluous to the designs. Some of the most sought-after and eccentric designs included the open-mouthed [[dhufish]] vase and black swan ashtray. A variety of swan-shaped ashtrays and vases were produced in a range of sizes, colours and glazes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/wa/content/2005/s1518221.htm Stateline — Western Australia — Australian Broadcasting Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===
Explorers' journals, as a literary [[genre]], often provide descriptions of black swans. For example, in December 1836, Lieutenant Bunbury of the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers|21st Fusiliers]] was the first European to travel overland from [[Pinjarra]] to the [[Vasse, Western Australia|Vasse]], describing the mudflats of the [[Leschenault Estuary]] at sunset covered by "...immense flocks of brown ducks and teal, while the water was equally covered with swans and pelicans."&lt;ref&gt;Bunbury, Lt. Col. W. St Pierre and Morrell, W.P. (Eds), ''Early Days in Western Australia: being the letters and journal of Lieut. H. W. Bunbury, 21st Fusiliers'', Oxford University Press, London 1930: 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The early colonist [[George Fletcher Moore]] included in his 1831 ballad "So Western Australia for Me" the lines:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:No lions or tigers are we dread to meet,
:Our innocent quadrupeds hop on two feet;
:No tithes and no taxes, we here have to pay,
:And our geese are all swans, as some witty folk say.&lt;ref&gt;Durack, M., quoting Moore in 'The Governor's Ball', in Bennett, B., &amp; Grono, W., ''Wide Domain: Western Australian themes and images'', Angus &amp; Robertson, Sydney 1979: 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The final line recalls an old English saying: "All his swans are turned to geese", meaning all his expectations end in nothing; all his boasting ends in smoke, like a person who fancies he sees a swan on a river but finds it to be only a goose. The phrase is sometimes reversed (as Moore has done): "All his geese are swans", which was commonly applied to people who think too much of the beauty and talent of their children and derived from [[Aesop]]'s fable "The Eagle and the Owl".&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, E. Cobham, ''Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'', 1898. http://www.bartleby.com/81/7059.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Gaito Gazdanov]]'s short story ''Black Swans'' (1930) the protagonist commits suicide because he has no opportunity of moving to Australia, which he imagines to be an idealised paradise of graceful black swans. [[D. H. Lawrence]] wrote in the 1925 short story "The Heritage":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Jack looked out at the road, but was much more enchanted by the full, soft river of heavenly blue water, on whose surface he looked eagerly for the black swans. He didn't see any.
:"Oh yes! Oh, yes! You'll find em wild in their native state a little way up," said Mr Swallow.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, D. H., 'The Heritage', in Bennet and Grono, ''Wide Domain: Western Australian themes and images'': 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Mollie Skinner]], Lawrence's co-author of ''[[The Boy in the Bush]]'' also wrote the novel ''Black Swans'', published in 1925 by Jonathan Cape in London.  She uses [[Juvenal]]'s phrase "''rara avis in terris, nigroque simillima cygno''" ("a rare bird in the lands, and very like a black swan") as its subtitle.  It alludes to her heroine, Letty Granville.

The potency of the image of the black swan as a signifier of Westralian nationalism can be seen in this passage from [[Randolph Stow]]'s "[[The Merry-Go-Round in the Sea]]", published in 1965:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Perth was ancient ... And it was a very special city, cut off from other cities by sea and desert, so that there was not another city for two thousand miles. Among all Australian cities it had proved itself the most special, by a romantic act called the [[Secessionism in Western Australia|Secession]], which the other cities had stuffily ignored.
:Cinderella State, he thought, feeling indignant. That was the reason for the Secession. Because they had ignored his poor Cinderella State, all one million square miles of it.
:Maybe after this war there'd be another war. Western Australia against the world, Black Swan flying.
:'We shouldn't have gone to Parliament House,' his mother had remarked, 'it seems to have made you political.' ...
:'When will Western Australia be free?' he wondered.
:'I don't know,' said his mother. 'Perhaps when Bonnie Prince Charlie comes over.'
:'Aww.' He grew disgusted at her flippancy.&lt;ref&gt;Stow, R., ''The Merry-go-Round in the Sea'', Penguin Books, Ringwood 1985: 135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Place names ===

==== Aboriginal languages ====
The black swan is likely to be well represented in the [[toponymy]] of the south-west. (Toponymy is the scientific study of place names.)  One example is Kurrabup (Nyungar language), or "black swan place", being the local Aboriginal name for the Wilson Inlet upon which the town of [[Denmark, Western Australia|Denmark]] is situated in the [[South West (Western Australia)|South West]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carmelcharlton.com/Songs_Of_The_West.htm Songs of the West]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== English language ====
The English-language place name "Black Swan" only occurs as a descriptive toponym once: the Black Swan Mine in the arid interior of the state near [[Laverton, Western Australia|Laverton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ga.gov.au/map/names/ Map Names of the State's interior], however see the naming of the Swan River in 1780 as the Black Swan River in {{Citation | author1=Harmer, T. (17..-18 | author2=graveur). Graveur | title=Plan of the island Rottenest lying off the west coast of New Holland ; Black Swan river on New Holland opposite Rottenest island / from Vankeulen ; writing by T. Harmar | publication-date=1780 | publisher=A. Dalrymple | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/84349 | accessdate=27 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more generic toponym "Swan", invariably referring to black swans, has at least 34 examples in Western Australia, almost entirely in the state's south-west.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ga.gov.au/map/names/ Map Names of the State's south-west]&lt;/ref&gt; These range from rural locations, such as [[List of lakes in Western Australia|Jebarjup Swan Lake]] in the [[Great Southern (Western Australia)|Great Southern region]], to the iconic [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]]. The Swan River is the source of at least eight shift names, forming the largest ''swan'' place-name cluster in Australia: Upper Swan, Middle Swan, [[Swan Valley (Western Australia)|Swan Valley]], Swan View, West Swan, Swan Estuary, Swan District, and the [[City of Swan|City (formerly Shire) of Swan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ga.gov.au/map/names/ Map Names of the State (Swan River region)]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swan Land District]] is the major [[Cadastre|cadastral]] unit of the state, underlying much of the name cluster. There are at least twenty "Swan" street names in the Perth metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;''Streetsmart Perth 1993 Street Directory'', Dept of Land Administration, Perth 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no "White Swan" toponyms in the state, and the toponymist Reed lists only the Swan River as a "Swan" toponym in the state.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, A.W., ''Place Names of Australia'', Reed Books Pty Ltd., Frenchs Forest 1973: 203-204&lt;/ref&gt;

The rarer form of ''Cygnet'' ("young swan") only occurs in three places, all along the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] coast, where they commemorate the passage of [[William Dampier]] and the mutineers on the Cygnet in 1688.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Reed, ''Place Names of Australia'': 76&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shipwrecks ===
With one-third of Australia's continental coastline within Western Australia, the cultural associations reflected in the scattering of shipwrecks named "Black Swan" is surprisingly small. A lone [[Cutter (ship)|cutter]] was wrecked in May 1851 in the [[Peel-Harvey Estuary]] near [[Mandurah, Western Australia|Mandurah]]. The large estuaries of the south-west of the state are strongly associated with black swans. There are six records for the more generic shipwreck name "Swan" between 1869 and 1972 on the north-west and west coasts, three times more than any other state,&lt;ref name="National Shipwreck Database"&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/heritage/nsd/nsd_list.pl National Shipwreck Database] {{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090709074141/http://environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/heritage/nsd/nsd_list.pl |date=9 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the destroyer escort [[HMAS Swan (DE 50)|HMAS ''Swan'']], which was scuttled in [[Geographe Bay]] in 1997 as an [[artificial reef]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capedive.com/swan.htm HMS Swan (reef)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eastern Australia ==
[[Image:Cygnus atratus "Mulgo" (cropped).jpeg|thumb|Drawing published in 1792. Entitled ''Black Swan, native name "Mulgo"'', it is attributed to the [[Port Jackson Painter]].]]

=== Heraldry ===
The [[coat of arms of Canberra]], granted in 1928, includes swans as supporters. One swan is the black Australian kind, and the other white (similar to a European [[mute swan]]), said to be symbolising the Aboriginal and European people of Australia. A different version of this appear in the [[flag of the Australian Capital Territory]]. No other state or territory arms in eastern Australia include a black swan.

Some 77 municipalities across eastern Australia have received grants of arms from the [[Monarchy in Australia|Crown]] since 1908, but only four include a black swan: [[City of Lake Macquarie|Lake Macquarie]] (1970, supporter) and [[Queanbeyan, New South Wales|Queanbeyan]] (1980, supporter) in [[New South Wales]], and [[Springvale, Victoria|Springvale]] (1976, supporter) and [[Sale, Victoria|Sale]] (1985, supporters) in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. These all indicate the presence of black swans in the municipal area. [[Campbelltown, New South Wales]], has a white swan in the crest of its arms (1969), alluding to the arms of its namesake Campbell family.

There are three grants of arms to corporations that include a black swan. In 1931, the Bank of New South Wales (now [[Westpac]]) was granted arms with a black swan supporter alluding to the Bank's acquisition of the [[Timeline of banking in Western Australia|Western Australian Bank]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Low, C., ''A Roll of Australian arms: corporate and personal, borne by lawful authority'', Rigby, Sydney 1971: 11&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the [[Royal Australasian College of Surgeons]] was granted arms with a black swan in the first and fourth quarters, apparently derived from the Australian Arms.&lt;ref&gt;Low, ''A Roll of Australian arms'': 6&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the [[Australian Academy of Science]] was granted arms with a black swan as a crest, alluding to the Academy's "Australianness" and its location in Canberra.&lt;ref&gt;Low, ''A Roll of Australian arms'': 5&lt;/ref&gt; The black swan has not been used in the arms of any university or residential college in eastern Australia.

Two religious authorities in eastern Victoria, the [[Anglican Diocese of Gippsland]] and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sale]], have a black swan as a charge on their diocesan arms.

=== Philately ===
The transfer of postage-stamp production from the states to the Commonwealth in 1913 has resulted in four issues being produced featuring a black swan design, three commemorating a Western Australian anniversary. In 1929, a stamp designed by Perth architect George Pitt Morrison, featuring a black swan taken from one of the colonial stamp designs, marked the state's centenary. In 1954, the centenary of the first Western Australian stamp was marked by a commemorative issue in a similar style to the original one-penny Black Swan. In 1979, the state's [[WAY 1979|150th anniversary]] was marked with an issue featuring the anniversary logo, a stylised black swan. A 1991 series of waterbirds included a 43-cent stamp showing a pair of black swans nesting with cygnets. This is the only philatelic recognition of the black swan's cultural values in eastern Australia as an emblem of estuarine and riverine environments characteristic of south-eastern Australia.

Incidental philatelic illustrations of the black swan include the [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]] (held in Perth) stamp issue bearing the Arms of the City of Perth with black swan supporters and charge, a 1963 commemorative of Canberra's founding featuring the city's arms, with black swan supporter, and the 1990 series of rare colonial stamps that included a reproduction of the colonial 4d Blue [[Inverted Swan]]. The black swan appears in stamp issues illustrating the Australian Arms (as one of the charges on the shield) in 1948, 1951, 1975 and 1999; and in a 1981 [[Queen's Official Birthday|Queen’s Birthday]] commemorative illustrating [[Queen's Personal Australian Flag|Her Majesty’s personal flag]] (which is banner of the shield in the Australian Arms).&lt;ref&gt;Eastick, M., ''Comprehensive Colour Catalogue of Australian Stamps'', Victoria Stamp Traders, Malvern 2003: 11-183&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decorative arts ===
Images of the black swan played only a minor role in the development of Australian decorative arts between the 1890s and World War One. This was a period when Australian flora and fauna decorative motifs were widely used for the first time. Images of [[lyrebird]]s, [[seahorses|sea horses]], [[waratah]]s, [[Actinotus helianthi|flannel flowers]], firewheels, [[cockatoo]]s and palm leaves feature prominently in the work of Lucien Henry, but the only known example of his work with a black swan is in a design for a fountain.&lt;ref&gt;’Detail of Public Park Fountain’, in Stephen, Ann (Ed), ''Visions of a Republic: the work of Lucien Henry, Paris, Noumea, Sydney'', Powerhouse Publishing, Sydney 2001: 220-221&lt;/ref&gt; A fountain in the central courtyard of [[Sydney Hospital]] reminiscent of Henry's design includes several black swans. Australian motifs were popular in the [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne Revival]] or [[Australian architectural styles|Federation architectural style]] of the period, but the black swan is rarely seen among the [[kookaburra]]s, [[Eucalyptus|eucalyptus leaves]] and [[Rising Sun (badge)|rising suns]].&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, H., and Joyce., R., ''The Federation House: Australia’s own style'', Lansdowne, The Rocks 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, the sculptor [[William Priestly MacIntosh]] carved a "coat of arms" for each state on the pilaster capitals of the façade of the new [[Commonwealth Bank]] headquarters on Pitt Street, Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;Earnshaw, Beverley, ''An Australian sculptor : William Priestly Macintosh'', Kogarah Historical Society, Kogarah 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He included a black swan on a shield for Western Australia, 56 years before the state was granted a coat of arms of a similar design. The Sydney Hospital fountain and the Commonwealth Bank façade are two uncommon examples of the use of the black swan in decorative arts in eastern Australia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

=== Literature ===
''Black Swan'' occurs rarely in literary titles. The [[State Library of New South Wales]] catalogue lists only ten fiction titles, one of which is an English-language translation of [[Thomas Mann]]'s 1954 work ''The Black Swan'' (''Die Betrogene'' in German&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Die Betrogene|''Die Betrogene'']] (in the German Wikipedia){{Better source|date=November 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Humphrey McQueen]]’s book, ''The Black Swans of Trespass: The Emergence of Modernist Painting in Australia 1918-1944'', takes its title from the final line of the poem "Durer: Innsbruck, 1495": 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:In its ignorance the vision of others. I am still
:The black swan of trespass on alien waters.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This poem, the first by [[Ern Malley]] to be published in ''[[Angry Penguins]]'' (1943), became a celebrated literary event.&lt;ref&gt;McQueen, H., ''The Black Swans of Trespass: The Emergence of Modernist Painting in Australia 1918-1944'', Alternative Publishing, Sydney 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Place names ===

==== Aboriginal languages ====
The black swan is represented in the toponymy of eastern Australia. Several [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] versions of local Aboriginal-language place names referring to black swans are known. Examples include [[Dunedoo, New South Wales|Dunedoo]] ([[Wiradjuri]] language) on the [[Talbragar River]],&lt;ref&gt;Reed, ''Place Names of Australia'': 86&lt;/ref&gt; [[Berrima, New South Wales|Berrima]] ([[Tharawal language|Tharawal]] or [[Gandangara people|Gundungurra]] language) in the Southern Highlands,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nswrail.net/library/station_names.php Station names — New South Wales Rail]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mulgoa, New South Wales|Mulgoa]] (Gundungurra language) on the [[Nepean River]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penrithcity.nsw.gov.au/index.asp?id=191 Penrith, New South Wales]&lt;/ref&gt; all in New South Wales; and [[Maroochydore, Queensland|Maroochydore]] on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast (Yuggera language: ''Muru-kutchi'' — meaning "red bill", the name of the black swan). Maroochydore is from Murukutchi-dha, the place of the black swan. This name was given by [[Andrew Petrie]] in 1842, who had two [[Brisbane River]] (Yuggera) Aboriginal men with him from whom he presumably heard the words. The local name for the swan is Kuluin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maroochy.qld.gov.au Maroochy, Queensland]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barwon Heads, Victoria|Barwon Heads]], Victoria, is near [[Lake Connewarre]], through which the [[Barwon River (Victoria)|Barwon River]] flows on its way to the sea. The name ''Connewarre'' is the local aboriginal name for the black swan, which was found in large numbers on the lake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barwonheads.net/TOWN/ABOUT.HTM Baron Heads, Victoria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006091053/http://www.barwonheads.net/TOWN/ABOUT.HTM |date=6 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also instances of such names being newly applied today; for example, [[Hydro Tasmania]] has adopted Aboriginal names for some parts of its hydro-electric developments, such as [[Catagunya Power Station|Catagunya]], meaning black swan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydro.com.au Hydro-Electric development, Tasmania]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== English language ====
The English-language place name "Black Swan" occurs as a descriptive toponym in four states, usually as a "name cluster". Queensland has a Black Swan Creek near [[Gladstone, Queensland|Gladstone]], together with nearby Black Swan Island and a Black Swan Rock further south near [[Shoalwater Bay]]; another Black Swan Creek near [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]]; and a Black Swan Lagoon inland on the [[Darling Downs]] near [[Warwick, Queensland|Warwick]]. New South Wales has a Black Swan Anabranch adjoining a Black Swan Lagoon on the north side of the [[Murray River]] in the [[Corowa Shire Council|Corowa Shire]]. In South Australia's arid north, there is a Black Swan Swamp just north of [[Roxby Downs, South Australia|Roxby Downs]] and a Black Swan Waterhole further north of the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line|old Overland Telegraph line]]. Tasmania has a Black Swan Island near the wild [[South West Cape (Tasmania)|South West Cape]]. Given the broad sweep of the black swan's natural habitat, the presence of only nine distinctive place names or name clusters within that range indicates the rarity of "Black Swan" as a toponym. New Zealand also has a Black Swan Stream in the [[South Auckland]] district.&lt;ref&gt;{{LINZ|40500|Black Swan Stream|24 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more generic toponym "Swan" invariably refers to black swans. The ''Gazetteer of Australia''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ga.gov.au/map/names/ Map names of New South Wales]&lt;/ref&gt; lists 57 examples in New South Wales, 32 in Tasmania, 20 in Queensland, 19 in Victoria, 10 in South Australia, 5 in the Northern Territory, and none in the other territories. Some idiosyncratic examples are Swan Hole (NSW), Swan Spit (Vic) and Swan Nook (Tas). The Gazetter also lists two "White Swan" toponyms: a mine and reservoir near [[Saint Arnaud, Victoria|St Arnaud]], on the Victorian goldfields. A clear concentration is evident in New South Wales and Tasmania. By contrast, the toponymist Reed lists only three examples: [[Swan Hill, Victoria|Swan Hill]] and Swan Pond in Victoria, and Swan Point in Tasmania (all named by explorers after sighting black swans in large numbers).&lt;ref&gt;Reed, ''Place Names of Australia'': 203-204&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sydney, there are thirteen "Swan" street names and one "Black Swan" street name,&lt;ref&gt;''2003 Sydney &amp; Blue Mountains Street Directory'', 39th edition, UBD, Macquarie Park 2003&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to a lone "Swan" street name in Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;''Darwin, includes Katherine &amp; Nhulunbuy, 2004/2005 Phone Directory &amp; Street Directory'', PDC Directories, Darwin 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The rarer form of ''Cygnet'' ("young swan") occasionally occurs. The ''Gazetteer of Australia'' records eleven in Tasmania (the densest concentration), five in South Australia and one in Victoria, but Reed's only example is [[Cygnet, Tasmania|Cygnet]], Tasmania, anglicised from Port des Cygnes, so-named by the French explorer [[Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] in 1793 because of the large number of swans he observed there.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

=== Shipwrecks ===
Another cultural association is reflected in the scattering of shipwrecks named "Black Swan". Tasmania has a wrecked [[schooner]] (1830) off [[Prime Seal Island]] in the [[Bass Strait]] and a wrecked fishing boat (1950) off [[Swansea, Tasmania|Swansea]] on the east coast. New South Wales has two wrecks off its northern coast: a cutter near [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] (1852) and a [[paddle steamer]] (1868) near the [[Manning River]]. The name "Black Swan" probably refers to the aquatic characteristics of black swans such as buoyancy and a graceful style, even though the shipwreck record suggests the hope in the name association was not always well founded. There are five records for the more generic "Swan" between 1836 and 1934: one in Tasmania, and two each in Victoria and New South Wales, including torpedo-boat destroyer [[HMAS Swan (D61)|HMAS ''Swan'']], scuttled in 1934.&lt;ref name="National Shipwreck Database"/&gt;

=== Australian rules football ===
[[Image:Western Australian team in the 1995 State of Origin matches colours.png|thumb|right|200px|West Australian [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football#State of origin|State of Origin]] guernsey]]
In [[Australian rules football]], the symbol of the black swan has been used prominently by the West Australian interstate teams since the state debuted in 1904.  The black swan symbol has featured in the [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football#State of origin|State of Origin]] series between 1977-1998 on the various guernsey designs (with some variations contrasting the swan depicted in the colours of the state emblem in reverse – as yellow on a black background and others with a yellow outline).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bomberblitz.com/~rmered/wa.htm Western Australian Jumpers] Retrieved 2007-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1978 variation of the WA jumper was used one-off by the [[West Coast Eagles]] in the [[Australian Football League]] Heritage Round in July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westcoasteagles.com.au/Default.aspx?tabid=7155&amp;newsId=46694 Heritage guernseys up for auction] 2007-07-05. Retrieved 2007-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The names of two [[Australian rules football]] clubs illustrate a contemporary variation of the ways in which cultural references to the black swan have changed and been transformed over time.

The [[Swan Districts Football Club]] was established in 1932 at [[Bassendean, Western Australia|Bassendean]], near the industrial and railway hub of the Swan District and a large community of [[expatriate]] Victorians. The name associated the club with the place, as did its emblem of a black swan. The club has since played in the [[West Australian Football League]].

The [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne Football Club]] was established in 1874 and was one of the founding clubs in the [[VFL/AFL]]. During the 1920s and 1930s, an influx of players from Western Australia led to the team becoming known as the "swans" within the VFL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sydneyswans.com.au/Swans/TheClub/History/tabid/7210/Default.aspx Sydney Swans - A Brief History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901004841/http://sydneyswans.com.au/Swans/TheClub/History/tabid/7210/Default.aspx |date=1 September 2007 }} Retrieved 2007-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, South Melbourne transferred to Sydney, dropping its old place name but retaining its nickname as the Sydney Swans. The swan, however, is no longer a black swan but a white swan, derived from existing red and white colours of South Melbourne and the lake-bound white swans of [[Albert Park, Victoria|Albert Park]] near its original home ground. The white swan is often combined with, or replaced by, a white Sydney Opera House-style logo.

This is an apparently rare example of Western Australian swan symbolism being transferred eastward, then transformed to symbolise something else, retaining only an echo of its formerly symbolic values. None of the current AFL teams have taken a black swan emblem in allusion to any natural qualities of the bird, and its sole representation in the symbology of the league refers to the largely unresearched phenomenon of late 19th-mid 20th century migration between Western Australia and Victoria - now borne by a club that has emigrated to New South Wales. It is an ironic transformation in the symbolism of a bird that that was for so long thought to be non-migratory.

=== America's Cup ===

== Modern philosophy ==

[[John Stuart Mill]] in the chapter "Of The Ground Of Induction" in his [[A System of Logic]] (1843) cited the example of "all swans are white" as a case of incorrect induction based on genuine experiences with erroneous conclusions. "As there were black swans, though civilized people had existed for three thousand years on the earth without meeting with them...The uniform experience, therefore, of the inhabitants of the known world, agreeing in a common result, without one known instance of deviation from that result, is not always sufficient to establish a general conclusion."&lt;ref name="Hume_Logic"&gt;{{cite book |last = Mill | first = John Stuart|title = [[A System of Logic|A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive]] (Classic Reprint)|publisher = Forgotten Books|date= 2011|isbn =978-1440090820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] cited the case of the 'black swan' in his chapter "On Induction" in his 1912 publication [[The Problems of Philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Russell_Black_Swan_1912"&gt;{{cite book |first=Bertrand |last=Russell |series=The Problems of Philosophy |title=On Induction |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/5827/pg5827.txt |accessdate=20 January 2016 |date=1912 |publisher=London: Williams and Norgate |isbn=9781605200255}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|"For example, a man who had seen a great many white swans might argue, by our principle, that on the data it was probable that all swans were white, and this might be a perfectly sound argument. The argument is not disproved by the fact that some swans are black, because a thing may very well happen in spite of the fact that some data render it improbable. In the case of the swans, a man might know that colour is a very variable characteristic in many species of animals, and that, therefore, an induction as to colour is peculiarly liable to error. But this knowledge would be a fresh datum, by no means proving that the probability relatively to our previous data had been wrongly estimated. The fact, therefore, that things often fail to fulfill our expectations is no evidence that our expectations will not probably be fulfilled in a given case or a given class of cases. Thus our inductive principle is at any rate not capable of being disproved by an appeal to experience. The inductive principle, however, is equally incapable of being proved by an appeal to experience."|Bertrand Russell. 1912. "On Induction" ''The Problems of Philosophy''}}

[[Karl Popper]] used the black swan example in his argument on [[falsifiability]] in ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' invoking [[David Hume]].&lt;ref name="Popper_black_swan"&gt;{{citation |title=The Logic of Scientific Discovery| first       = Karl |last=Popper  |date=2002 |origyear = 1059 |publisher=Routledge| pages = 513 | isbn= 3-16-148410-X | oclc= 62448100 }} ''Logik der Forschung'' 1934 [http://dieoff.org/page126.htm The Problem of Induction]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The answer to this problem is: as implied by Hume, we certainly are not justified in reasoning from an instance to the truth of the corresponding law. But to this negative result a second result, equally negative, may be added: we are justified in reasoning from a counterinstance to the falsity of the corresponding universal law (that is, of any law of which it is a counterinstance). Or in other words, from a purely logical point of view, the acceptance of one counterinstance to 'All swans are white' implies the falsity of the law 'All swans are white' - that law, that is, whose counterinstance we accepted. Induction is logically invalid; but refutation or falsification is a logically valid way of arguing from a single counterinstance to - or, rather, against - the corresponding law.This shows that I continue to agree with Hume's negative logical result; but I extend it.This logical situation is completely independent of any question of whether we would, in practice, accept a single counterinstance - for example, a solitary black swan - in refutation of a so far highly successful law. I do not suggest that we would necessarily be so easily satisfied; we might well suspect that the black specimen before us was not a swan."|Karl Popper [http://dieoff.org/page126.htm "The Problem of Induction"] ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery''}}

''[[The Black Swan (Taleb book)|The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable]]'' is the title of an influential 2007 book by [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] thinker [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]]. The book expounds Taleb's theory that rare, unexpected, highly [[:wikt:anomaly|anomalous]] events are both more common and more momentous than previously imagined. This theory has since become known as the [[black swan theory]].

Retrieved 23 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It was established by the [[National Clarion Cycling Club]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] activists and trade unionists. The BWSF had branches across the country, but it was strongest in [[London]], [[Manchester]], [[South Wales]] and the industrial areas of [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=Nauright&gt;Nauright, John &amp; Parrish, Charles: ''Sports around the World: History, Culture, and Practice'', p. 216.

In 1925 the BWSF participated in the first [[International Workers' Olympiads]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]], and in 1927 the London Group of the BWSF sent a British workers' football team to play a series of matches in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://contentdm.warwick.ac.uk/cdm/ref/collection/russian/id/1673 The Workers' Sports Movement (including an account of the experiences of the first British Workers' football team in Soviet Russia)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44073931 The story of the 1927 British Workers tour of Russia], BBC News, 30 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1928 BWSF was essentially a wing of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]]. As a result, moderate Labour Party members and unionists left the association. The BWSF soon joined the [[Comintern]]-led [[Red Sport International]] and participated in the [[1928 Moscow Spartakiad]]. In 1930, the Labour Party and the [[Trades Union Congress]] founded the [[National Workers' Sports Association]] as a counterweight to the BWSF.&lt;ref name=Nauright/&gt;

Unfortunately for Colón River in 2005 it was forced to abandon the [[2005 ANAPROF|2005]] season after only one match missing for the ''Apertura'' to finish&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panamaamerica.com.pa/content/hoy-la-anaprof-define-si-desafilian-al-col%C3%B3n-river Hoy la ANAPROF define si desafilian al Colón River]&amp;nbsp;– Panamá América {{es|icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore it ceased to exist.

'''Francis Booker''' (8 October 1746 – 13 November 1806) was an English [[first-class cricket]]er who was born in the village of [[Eynsford]], which is about eight miles north of [[Sevenoaks]], in [[Kent]]. He lived his whole life there and kept the ''Soho Inn''. His known career was from 1773 to 1790 and he is mentioned by sources in connection with a total of 53 top-class matches (48 first-class and five [[single wicket cricket|single wicket]]). 

Booker was a left-handed [[batting (cricket)|batsman]] who was noted as a fine hitter of the ball and a very good [[Fielding (cricket)|outfielder]]. He mostly played for [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent teams]] and was rated a good single wicket player.&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph S. Darling Memorial Stadium''', located in [[Hampton, Virginia]], serves primarily as a [[high school football]] stadium, and also hosts various [[track-and-field]] meets, as well as [[marching band]] competitions. The 8,000-seat brick facility opened in 1989. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hampton.gov/bbgf/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527181414/http://www.hampton.gov/bbgf/history.html |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, the Darling Estate donated land on Hampton's Victoria Road, exclusively for the use of athletic facilities. The original stadium lasted until 1987, two years before the current stadium opened. The city's four high schools -[[Bethel High School (Hampton, Virginia)|Bethel]], [[Hampton High School (Hampton, Virginia)|Hampton]], [[Kecoughtan High School|Kecoughtan]], and [[Phoebus High School|Phoebus]]- each use Darling Stadium for their home football games.

{{refimprove|date=January 2018}}
[[Image:SplitLeap.gif|thumb|A [[split leap]] executed by an [[acro dance]]r. This is one of several types of leaps found in [[dance]].]]

'''Jumping''' or '''leaping''' is a form of locomotion or movement in which an [[organism]] or non-living (e.g., [[robotics|robotic]]) mechanical system propels itself through the air along a ballistic trajectory. Jumping can be distinguished from running, galloping and other [[gait]]s where the entire body is temporarily airborne, by the relatively long duration of the aerial phase and high angle of initial launch.

Some animals, such as the [[kangaroo]], employ jumping (commonly called ''hopping'' in this instance) as their primary form of [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]], while others, such as [[frog]]s, use it only as a means to escape predators. Jumping is also a key feature of various activities and sports, including the [[long jump]], [[high jump]] and [[show jumping]].

==Physics==

[[File:Bottlenose Dolphin KSC04pd0178.jpg|thumb|Jumping [[bottlenose dolphin]]]]

All jumping involves the application of force against a substrate, which in turn generates a reactive force that propels the jumper away from the substrate. Any solid or liquid capable of producing an opposing force can serve as a substrate, including ground or water. Examples of the latter include dolphins performing traveling jumps, and Indian skitter frogs executing standing jumps from water.

Jumping organisms are rarely subject to significant aerodynamic forces and, as a result, their jumps are governed by the basic physical laws of [[Trajectory of a projectile|ballistic trajectories]]. Consequently, while a bird may jump into the air to initiate flight, no movement it performs once airborne is considered jumping, as the initial jump conditions no longer dictate its flight path. &lt;!--Similarly, it is impossible to jump underwater, as hydrodynamic forces would greatly exceed gravitational forces. (This is an error. Various sea creatures can propel themselves off the bottom. Human swimmers also can. --&gt;

Following the moment of launch (i.e., initial loss of contact with the substrate), a jumper will traverse a parabolic path. The launch angle and initial launch velocity determine the travel distance, duration, and height of the jump. The maximum possible horizontal travel distance occurs at a launch angle of 45 degrees, but any launch angle between 35 and 55 degrees will result in ninety percent of the maximum possible distance.

Muscles (or other [[actuator]]s in non-living systems) do physical work, adding [[kinetic energy]] to the jumper's body over the course of a jump's propulsive phase. This results in a [[kinetic energy]] at launch that is proportional to the square of the jumper's speed. The more work the muscles do, the greater the launch velocity and thus the greater the acceleration and the shorter the time interval of the jump's propulsive phase.

[[File:Jumping dog.JPG|thumb|A [[dog]] jumping from a stationary position]]

Mechanical [[Power (physics)|power]] (work per unit time) and the distance over which that power is applied (e.g., leg length) are the key determinants of jump distance and height. As a result, many jumping animals have long legs and muscles that are optimized for maximal power according to the [[Muscle contraction#Force-length and force-velocity relationships|force-velocity relationship of muscles]]. The maximum power output of muscles is limited, however. To circumvent this limitation, many jumping species slowly pre-stretch elastic elements, such as [[tendon]]s or [[apodeme]]s, to store work as strain energy. Such elastic elements can release energy at a much higher rate (higher power) than equivalent muscle mass, thus increasing launch energy to levels beyond what muscle alone is capable of.

A jumper may be either stationary or moving when initiating a jump. In a jump from stationary (i.e., a ''standing jump''), all of the work required to accelerate the body through launch is done in a single movement. In a ''moving jump'' or ''running jump'', the jumper introduces additional vertical velocity at launch while conserving as much horizontal momentum as possible. Unlike stationary jumps, in which the jumper's kinetic energy at launch is solely due to the jump movement, moving jumps have a higher energy that results from the inclusion of the horizontal velocity preceding the jump. Consequently, jumpers are able to jump greater distances when starting from a run.

==Anatomy==

[[Image:Frog_limbs.jpg|thumb|right|A [[American bullfrog|bullfrog]] skeleton, showing elongate limb bones and extra joints.  Red marks indicate bones substantially elongated in frogs, and joints that have become mobile.  Blue indicates joints and bones that have not been modified, or are only somewhat elongated.]]

Animals use a wide variety of anatomical adaptations for jumping. These adaptations are exclusively concerned with the launch, as any post-launch method of extending range or controlling the jump must use aerodynamic forces, and thus is considered [[gliding]] or [[parachuting]].

Aquatic species rarely display any particular specializations for jumping. Those that are good jumpers usually are primarily adapted for speed, and execute moving jumps by simply swimming to the surface at a high velocity. A few primarily aquatic species that can jump while on land, such as [[mud skipper]]s, do so via a flick of the tail.

===Limb morphology===

In terrestrial animals, the primary propulsive structure is the legs, though a few species use their tails.  Typical characteristics of jumping species include long legs, large leg muscles, and additional limb elements.

Long legs increase the time and distance over which a jumping animal can push against the substrate, thus allowing more power and faster, farther jumps. Large leg muscles can generate greater force, resulting in improved jumping performance. In addition to elongated leg elements, many jumping animals have modified foot and ankle bones that are elongated and possess additional joints, effectively adding more segments to the limb and even more length.

Frogs are an excellent example of all three trends: frog legs can be nearly twice the body length, leg muscles may account for up to twenty percent of body weight, and they have not only lengthened the foot, shin and thigh, but extended the ankle bones into another limb joint and similarly extended the hip bones and gained mobility at the sacrum for a second 'extra joint'. As a result, frogs are the undisputed champion jumpers of vertebrates, leaping over fifty body lengths, a distance of more than eight feet.&lt;ref&gt;

  | date = 1978 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power amplification through stored energy===
[[Grasshopper]]s use elastic energy storage to increase jumping distance. Although power output is a principal determinant of jump distance (as noted above), physiological constraints limit muscle power to approximately 375 Watts per kilogram of muscle.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
  | last = Marsh, R. L.
  | date = 1994
  | title = Jumping ability of anuran amphibians. Advances in Veterinary Science and Comparative Medicine 38, 51-111 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; To overcome this limitation, grasshoppers anchor their legs via an internal "catch mechanism" while their muscles stretch an elastic [[apodeme]] (similar to a vertebrate [[tendon]]). When the catch is released, the apodeme rapidly releases its energy. Because the apodeme releases energy more quickly than muscle, its power output exceeds that of the muscle that produced the energy.

This is analogous to a human throwing an arrow by hand versus using a bow; the use of elastic storage (the bow) allows the muscles to operate closer to isometric on the [[Muscle contraction#Force-length and force-velocity relationships|force-velocity curve]]. This enables the muscles to do work over a longer time and thus produce more energy than they otherwise could, while the elastic element releases that work faster than the muscles can. The use of elastic energy storage has been found in jumping mammals as well as in frogs, with commensurate increases in power ranging from two to seven times that of equivalent muscle mass.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==

One way to classify jumping is by the manner of foot transfer.&lt;ref&gt;''Study Guide for Elementary [[Labanotation]]'' by Peggy Hackney, Sarah Manno (Editor), Muriel Topaz (Editor)&lt;/ref&gt; In this classification system, five basic jump forms are distinguished:
* '''Jump''' — jumping from and landing on two feet
* '''Hop''' — jumping from one foot and landing on the same foot
* '''Leap''' — jumping from one foot and landing on the other foot
* '''Assemble''' — jumping from one foot and landing on two feet
* '''Sissonne''' — jumping from two feet and landing on one foot

Leaping gaits, which are distinct from [[running]] gaits (see [[animal locomotion|Locomotion]]), include [[canter]]ing, [[Horse gaits#Gallop|galloping]], and [[stotting|pronging]].&lt;ref name="Roberts1995"&gt;Tristan David Martin Roberts (1995) ''Understanding Balance: The Mechanics of Posture and Locomotion'', Nelson Thornes, {{ISBN|0-412-60160-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Height-enhancing devices and techniques==
[[File:Hometrampoline.jpg|thumb|right|Person jumping on a trampoline]]

The height of a jump may be increased by using a [[trampoline]] or by converting horizontal velocity into vertical velocity with the aid of a device such as a [[half pipe]].

Various exercises can be used to increase an athlete's vertical jumping height. One category of such exercises—[[plyometrics]]—employs repetition of discrete jumping-related movements to increase speed, agility, and power.

It has been shown in research that children who are more physically active display more proficient jumping (along with other basic motor skill) patterns. &lt;ref name="Raudsepp"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raudsepp|first1=Lennart|last2=Päll|first2=Peep|title=The Relationship between Fundamental Motor Skills and Outside-School Physical Activity of Elementary School Children|journal=Pediatric Exercise Science|date=November 2006|volume=18|issue=4|pages=426–435|doi=10.1123/pes.18.4.426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also noted that jumping development in children has a direct relationship with age. As children grow older, it is seen that their jumping abilities in all forms also increase. Jumping development is more easily identifiable in children rather than adults due to the fact that there are less physical differences at a younger age. Adults of the same age may be vastly different in terms of physicality and athleticism making it difficult to see how age affects jumping ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Utesch|first=T.|last2=Dreiskämper|first2=D.|last3=Strauss|first3=B.|last4=Naul|first4=R.|date=2018-01-01|title=The development of the physical fitness construct across childhood|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sms.12889/abstract|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=212–219|doi=10.1111/sms.12889|issn=1600-0838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laos Football Club''' is a professional Filipino [[association football club]] based in [[Tacloban]], [[Leyte]]. The team played in the [[United Football League (Philippines)|United Football League]], the highest level of club football in the Philippines at the time the league was extant.

==History==
===Global as "Laos F.C."===
The club's roots can be traced back in March 2000 when a group of football enthusiasts from [[Tacloban]] organized a weekly football practice as their leisure activity.&lt;ref name="global"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalfc.ph/club|title=About Global F.C. (new)|author=|publisher=Global Football Club (new website)|accessdate=31 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111183500/http://globalfc.ph/club|archivedate=11 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group which included [[Dan Palami]] and some of his employees at his company played their first weekly football games behind the [[Quezon City]] hall, and later moving to the [[University of the Philippines Diliman#Sunken Garden|Sunken Garden football field]] inside the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]].&lt;ref name=hanson2&gt;{{Cite episode | first =f Hans | last = Smit | first2 = Jing| last2 = Jamlang | first3 = Palami | last3 = Dan | date = 31 October 2013 | title = What Dan Palami Has Done for Philippine Football | trans-title = | medium = Podcast | language = English, Filipino | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4erzNXPDO4E&amp;index=41&amp;list=PL5DScDrnjFIFAq3uVi-zewmp_bPuw996z | access-date = 17 June 2016 | series = Hans On| format =  | time =5:15–6:25 | location = | publisher = New Media Factory TV |season=1 |number=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then they began to participate in minor tournaments around [[Manila]], under the name "Laos F.C." with the name of the team derived from the term "laos" which means "has beens".&lt;ref name="global"/&gt;

===Establishment and participation in the UFL===
With the renaming of the club to "[[Global F.C.|Global Football Club]]" in 2009, club owner Dan Palami chose to form a separate team which carried the "Laos Football Club" name. The team shares its history with Global, and is considered its sister team.

Laos had their first major success in the [[United Football League (Philippines)|United Football League]] (UFL) in the [[2015 United Football League (Philippines)|2015]] season, when they won the [[UFL Division 2]] Championship with an unbeaten record. The championship earned them promotion to the first division, allowing them to play in the Philippines' top flight for the first time in their history. But promotion and relegation system was discontinued for the 2016 season which meant that Laos competed in the only division of the 2016 season.

===Weekend Football League===

'''Looptworks''' is a Portland, Oregon business that [[upcycle]]s or re-purposes abandoned, [[pre-consumer]] and post-consumer materials into limited-edition products.&lt;ref name="tp-waste" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fc-upcycles" /&gt; By re-using the world’s pre-consumer excess, the U.S.-based company aims to "break the cycle of waste".&lt;ref name="lw site-about" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gl-cycle" /&gt; The products created by Looptworks primarily focus on bags, accessories and clothing.&lt;ref name="fc-upcycles" /&gt;

It is estimated that a single garment factory can create up to 60,000 pounds (27 metric tons) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120513174301/http://www.looptworks.com/blog/2011/09/entrepreneur-magazine-the-innovators/ Entrepreneur Magazine video] of textile waste, which normally goes to landfills.&lt;ref name="wm-wearable waste" /&gt; Looptworks intends to use that waste to make new garments.&lt;ref name="wm-wearable waste" /&gt;
"Our intent is to follow the waste stream. We as western society have gone over [to Asia] and asked a lot of people to do favors for us but haven’t considered what the implications are. We have to clean up our mess", according to Scott Hamlin, Looptworks's Co-Founder.&lt;ref name="wm-wearable waste" /&gt; Looptworks intends to call attention to excess and waste, and encourage "thoughtful consumption."&lt;ref name="wm-wearable waste" /&gt;
  
Looptworks's designs will change frequently, as sources of supply vary, making each design effectively a "limited edition".&lt;ref name="tp-waste" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fc-upcycles" /&gt; This will add to the attraction for some consumers.&lt;ref name="tp-waste" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wm-wearable waste" /&gt;

Looptworks will have a much quicker design cycle than most apparel makers with an estimated 9 weeks as opposed to 54.&lt;ref name="wm-wearable waste" /&gt;

Looptworks has introduced "laptop sleeves" constructed from a wetsuit factory's scrap neoprene.&lt;ref name="th-sleeves" /&gt;

According to Ariel Schwartz of ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'': "Looptworks isn't the first company to manufacture upcycled goods-but it is the first clothing line to exclusively use textile waste that would otherwise end up in the garbage."&lt;ref name="fc-upcycles" /&gt;

==Sponsorships==
Looptworks is the official supplier and sponsor of numerous [[association football]] teams, players and associations, including:

'''Riverside Golf Course''' is a [[municipal]] public [[golf]] course owned by the city of [[Portland, Maine|Portland]], [[Maine]], United States. It is located on the banks of the [[Presumpscot River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressherald.com/news/city-weighs-new-management-for-sports-sites-running-in-red_2011-02-05.html City weighs new management for sports sites running in red] ''[[Portland Press Herald]]'', February 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

Built in 1932, it was expanded to an 18-hole course in 1937 through funding from the [[Works Progress Administration]].  In 1969, the 9-hole South Course opened featuring a par 35 playing at 2,941 yards. In 2007 the 3-hole practice course was built for the use for junior programming. Throughout the winter the course is used for many winter activities, including cross country skiing, sledding, snowboarding, outdoor ice rink and snowshoeing.&lt;ref name="Billings"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pressherald.com/news/golfers-take-a-shot-at-course-of-action_2012-12-12.html|title=Golfers don't want Portland course privatized|last=Billings|first=Randy|date=December 12, 2012|work=[[The Portland Press Herald]]|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''St Ann's Ground''' was a [[cricket]] ground at [[Barnes, London|Barnes]], Surrey (now in the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]]).  In 1889 the Lyric Club played the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] in a non first-class match.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/292_misc.html Other matches played on St Ann's Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;  The only [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match held at the ground came in 1890 when the Lyric Club played the touring [[Australia national cricket team|Australians]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/292_f.html First-Class Matches played on St Ann's Ground]&lt;/ref&gt; which the Lyric Club won by 96 runs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3614.html Lyric Club v Australians, 1890]&lt;/ref&gt;  The final important match at the ground, in 1892, was between the Lyric Club and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]].  The ground was located within the grounds of St Ann's House, which in the early 1900s it was built over.  The approximate location of the house today would be near Lyric Road and St Ann's Road, which are near the [[River Thames]].

'''''The Legend of Bagger Vance''''' is a 2000 [[Sports film|sports]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Robert Redford]], and stars [[Will Smith]], [[Matt Damon]] and [[Charlize Theron]]. The screenplay by [[Jeremy Leven]] is based on the 1995 book ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance (novel)|The Legend of Bagger Vance: A Novel of Golf and the Game of Life]]'' by [[Steven Pressfield]]. It takes place in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1931. The film served as the final roles of [[Jack Lemmon]] before his death the following year and [[Lane Smith]] before his death five years later.

On release, the film was a [[box office bomb]], grossing almost $40 million worldwide, and received mixed to negative reviews; criticism was targeted by several [[African American]] commentators and reviewers for employing the "[[magical negro]]" stereotype.&lt;ref name="Farley"&gt;{{cite news|title=That Old Black Magic |date=2000-05-27 |first=Christopher John |last=Farley |authorlink=Christopher John Farley |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,998604,00.html |accessdate=2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
As an old man having his sixth heart attack while playing golf, Hardy Greaves ([[Jack Lemmon]]) contemplates how his wife used to ask him (before her passing) why he insisted on playing "a game that seems destined to kill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/l/legend-of-bagger-vance-script.html|title=Legend Of Bagger Vance Script – transcript from the screenplay and/or Matt Damon and Will Smith golf movie|publisher=script-o-rama.com|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;" him. Explaining his love for the game, he begins the story of his childhood idol: Rannulph Junuh ([[Matt Damon]]).

Junuh is the favorite son of [[Savannah, Georgia]]: a noteworthy golfer from a wealthy family, he and his beautiful girlfriend named Adele Invergordon ([[Charlize Theron]]) seem to have it all. While serving as a captain in the US Army during [[World War I]], Junuh is traumatized when his entire company is wiped out in battle. Though he earns the [[Medal of Honor]], he disappears after the war, returning to Georgia years later as a broken-down [[alcoholic]].

At the start of the [[Great Depression]] (circa 1930&lt;ref&gt;Jones actually retired from golf in 1930, but a theater playing [[The Public Enemy|''The Public Enemy'' (1931)]] is seen.&lt;/ref&gt;), Adele is trying to recover her family's lost fortune by holding a four-round, two-day [[exhibition match]] between  [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]] ([[Joel Gretsch]]) and [[Walter Hagen]] ([[Bruce McGill]]), the best golfers of the era, with a grand prize of $10,000, at a golf resort her father opened as the Depression struck. However, she needs a local participant to generate local interest. The young Greaves ([[imdbname:0597670|J. Michael Moncrief]]) speaks up for his hero, Junuh, prompting Adele to ask her estranged lover to play.

Junuh is approached by a mysterious traveler carrying a suitcase, who appears while Junuh is trying to hit golf balls into the dark void of night. The man identifies himself as Bagger Vance ([[Will Smith]]) and says he will be Junuh's [[caddie]]. With Greaves as assistant caddie, Bagger helps Junuh come to grips with his personal demons and play golf again.

When the match starts, Jones and Hagen each play well in their distinctive ways, but the disengaged Junuh plays poorly and is far behind after the first round. With Bagger caddying for him and giving advice, Junuh rediscovers his "authentic swing" in the second round and makes up some ground. In the third round, he closes the gap even more, hitting a hole in one in the process. Meanwhile, Junuh and Adele rekindle their romance.

Late in the final round, Junuh disregards Bagger's advice at a crucial point and after that plays poorly. He hits a ball into a forest, where he has a traumatic World War I flashback, but Bagger's words help him to focus on the game. Junuh pulls back to a tie with Jones and Hagen, then has a chance to win on the final hole, but has the integrity to call a penalty on himself when his ball moves after he tries to remove a loose impediment.

Seeing Junuh has grown and matured, Bagger decides his golfer doesn't need him any more. With the 18th hole left unfinished, Bagger gives the position of caddie to Greaves, and leaves Junuh as mysteriously as he came.

Though losing a chance to win because of the penalty, Junuh sinks an improbable putt and the match ends in a gentlemanly three-way tie. The three golfers shake hands with all of Savannah cheering. Junuh and Adele get back together.

The old Greaves wakes up and sees an unaged Bagger Vance beckoning him from a distance. Hardy follows, presumably to the afterlife.

== Production notes {{anchor|Writing}} ==

=== Similarities to the Hindu epic ''Mahabharata'' ===
The plot is loosely based on the [[Hindu]] sacred text the [[Bhagavad Gita]], where the Warrior/Hero [[Arjuna]] (R. Junuh) refuses to fight.  The god [[Krishna]] appears as [[Bhagavan]] (Bagger Vance) to help him to follow his path as the warrior and hero that he was meant to be. This relationship was fully explained by [[Steven J. Rosen]] in his book ''Gita on the Green'', for which Steven Pressfield wrote the foreword.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ONDYJTXf8loC|title=Gita on the Green: The Mystical Tradition Behind Bagger Vance|first=Steven|last=Rosen|date=30 May 2002|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|via=Google Books|isbn=9780826413659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filming ===
Portions of the exhibition match were set at the [[Kiawah Island Golf Resort]] in [[South Carolina]], United States, considered one of the toughest in the country. The scene in which Greaves has a heart attack was shot on No. 11 of the resort's Cougar Point golf course.  The final hole in the film was temporary, so the filming did not interfere with the club activities, and cost US $200,000 to build.  However, most of the golf scenes were filmed at Colleton River Plantation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colletonriverclub.com/|title=Colleton River Club&amp;nbsp;Homepage|website=www.colletonriverclub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; just off [[Hilton Head Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2000-11-12/travel/0011090370_1_bagger-vance-pressfield-19th-hole|title=The Bagger Vance Hole: Watch For That Alligator Hazard|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain segments of this film were also filmed in Savannah and [[Jekyll Island]], Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146984/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt IMDb ''The Legend of Bagger Vance'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Critical response  {{anchor|Critics}} ===
Reaction from the movie critics was mixed. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 43% based on 129 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Despite the talent involved in ''The Legend of Bagger Vance'', performances are hindered by an inadequate screenplay full of flat characters and bad dialogue. Also, not much happens, and some critics are offended by how the film glosses over issues of racism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/legend_of_bagger_vance/|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-legend-of-bagger-vance |title=The Legend of Bagger Vance Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher = [[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]], who gave it 3½ stars, said,  "It handles a sports movie the way [[Billie Holiday]] handled a trashy song, by finding the love and pain beneath the story. Redford and his writer, Jeremy Leven, starting from a novel by Steven Pressfield, are very clear in their minds about what they want to do. They want to explain why it is possible to devote your life to the love of golf, and they want to hint that golf and life may have a lot in common".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=November 3, 2000|author=[[Roger Ebert]] |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20001103/REVIEWS/11030302/1023|title=Roger Ebert: The Legend Of Bagger Vance|work=[[Chicago Sun Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]]'s George Perry called it a  "sumptuously photographed film" but added that "in spite of being lovely to look at, it is pretentious piffle, although Will Smith shows skill and subtlety in his ludicrous role".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=George Perry|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/02/14/the_legend_of_bagger_vance_2001_review.shtml
|title=The Legend of Bagger Vance (2001)|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=February 22, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' called it one of the most "embarrassing" films of recent years for its treatment of African Americans and the use of a "Magical African-American Friend".&lt;ref name="Farley" /&gt;

=== Box office ===
''The Legend of Bagger Vance'' opened at #3 at the U.S. box office, grossing $11,516,712 from 2,061 theaters.&lt;ref name="BoxOfficeMojo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=legendofbaggervance.htm|title=The Legend of Bagger Vance|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Internet Movie Database]], the film's total gross came to $30,695,227, far short of its estimated $80 million budget.&lt;ref name="IMDB Box Office/Business"&gt; {{cite web |title=Box Office |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146984/business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Chess Championship 2006''' was a match between Classical [[World Chess Championship|World Chess Champion]] [[Vladimir Kramnik]], and [[FIDE]] World Chess Champion [[Veselin Topalov]]. The title of World Chess Champion had been split for 13 years. This match, played between September 23 and October 13, 2006, in [[Elista]], [[Kalmykia]], [[Russia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fide.com/news.asp?id=1081|title=FIDE Online: Regulations of the Match Topalov–Kramnik|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820194721/http://www.fide.com/news.asp?id=1081|archivedate=2006-08-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was to reunite the two World Chess Champion titles and produce an undisputed World Champion.

Kramnik won the first two games, establishing a commanding lead. However, after Topalov's camp alleged that Kramnik was [[#Bathroom controversy|using computer assistance]], Kramnik forfeited Game 5. He eventually agreed to play again under protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3392|title=Kramnik agrees to play (under protest)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topalov won games 8 and 9, taking the lead for the first time, but Kramnik struck back with a win in game 10. The remaining games were drawn, sending the match to a tiebreak. After a draw in the first game and a win apiece in the second and third games, Kramnik won the fourth game after Topalov blundered, to win the tiebreak and the match, becoming the 14th undisputed World Chess Champion.

==Background==
After [[Garry Kasparov]] split from FIDE in 1993, there were two world chess champions. There was the 'Classical' world champion, the title that only passes on to a player when he defeats the previous world champion. This was held by Kasparov, until he was defeated by Kramnik in the [[Classical World Chess Championship 2000]]. There was also the 'Official' FIDE world champion, determined by various tournament formats, held since the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2005]] by Topalov.

From 1993 to 2006, no match was ever held between the various classical and official champions. This match brought the two titleholders together to unify the World Chess Championship for the first time since the 1993 split.

==Negotiations==
[[Image:Chess2006.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Match logo]]
Kramnik was invited to the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2005]] in [[San Luis, Argentina|San Luis]], [[Argentina]]. As "Classical" World Champion, he refused to play, but indicated his willingness to play the winner in a match to unify the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chesscenter.com/twic/kramfide.html|title=Kramnik Statement on FIDE 2005 Championship}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations for a match began soon after Topalov won in San Luis, but broke down after the two camps were unable to overcome substantial differences of opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=2742 "Veselin Topalov: only under the auspices of FIDE"], Chessbase.com&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in April 2006, FIDE announced that Kramnik would play current FIDE Champion Veselin Topalov in a world championship match to unify the "Classical" champion line with the FIDE championship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3291 Kirsan, Putin and the world championship match], [[Chessbase]], August 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The prize fund of $1 million would be evenly divided between the players – regardless of the outcome of the match.

==Head to head==
In past encounters, Kramnik had defeated Topalov 10 times, lost 5 games, with 24 draws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3324 "Who will win the Topalov–Kramnik world championship?"], Chessbase.com&lt;/ref&gt; (This becomes +19 −9 =34 if rapid and blindfold games are included.) In classical time control games since the beginning of 2004, the score was 2 wins each, with 3 draws.

==Match conditions==
The match was a best of 12 games. Players scored 1 point for a win and half a point for a draw. If, after 12 games, the score was tied at 6 points each, then a tie-break would be held. As it turned out, the first round of tie-breaks (rapid games) was indeed required, and was held on October 13, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fide.com/news.asp?id=1140|title=FIDE.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018162441/http://www.fide.com/news.asp?id=1140|archivedate=2006-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time control===
From the match conditions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The primary [[time control]] for each game shall be: 40 moves in the first 120 minutes, and if that is met, then a secondary time control of 20 moves in 60 minutes, and if that is also met, then the rest of the game shall be played out in 15 minutes, with an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 61.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Tie-break method===
*The tie break is only used if the match is tied at 6 points apiece after the 12 regular games.
*In the event of the tie-break, the players play four "rapid" games (each with a time limit of 25 minutes, plus 10 seconds per move).
*If the score is still tied, this is followed by two "blitz" games (each with a time limit of 5 minutes, plus 10 seconds per move).
*If the score is still tied, this is followed by a sudden death game: white has 6 minutes and needs to win, black has five minutes and needs to draw or win.

==Schedule and results==
Colors were determined for the regular games by the drawing of lots at the opening ceremony on 21 September 2006. The colors reversed between games 6 and 7. The colors for the first tie-break game were decided by drawing lots again. All regular games, and the first tie-break game, began at 3:00 p.m. local time, which corresponds to 1100 [[UTC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/tru.html |title=Time Zones of Russia |publisher=Statoids.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
Kramnik won the first round of this match in a 75-move game that lasted six and a half hours. Topalov, whose style is more tactical than positional, blundered when he played a risky move late in the game. Topalov had a drawn position throughout most of the game and made a fatal miscalculation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3360 Elista 2006: Kramnik wins game one], Chessbase.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Kramnik won the second game of the match after 63 moves, taking a 2–0 lead. Topalov missed winning continuations at move 32 and 36. Some inaccuracies later in the game cost him the draw.

| '''Game 8:''' Kramnik played 41. Kxg3?, worsening his position.
}}
Game 8 lasted 4½ hours, and resulted in Topalov's first win over the board in the match, tying the score at 4–4. It featured the strategically unbalanced Meran Variation [[Semi-Slav Defense]]. Topalov's 15...Qa5 was a theoretical novelty. After 21 moves, the players reached a sharp, complicated, queenless middlegame with Topalov having two knights for Kramnik's rook and pawn. Topalov spun a mating web with his knights and rook, aided by Kramnik's mistakes on moves 32 and 41.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://susanpolgar.blogspot.com/2006/10/game-8-live-commentary-topalov-scores.html|title= Game 8 Analysis – Topalov scores 1st win on the board|author=Susan Polgar|date=2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| '''Game 9:''' position after 34 moves. The following attack by Topalov forced Kramnik to resign.
}}
Game 9 was a 3-hour tussle featuring a [[Slav Defense]]. Topalov's 6.Nh4 and 7.Nxg6 is a standard idea gaining White the advantage of the [[Chess terminology#B|bishop pair]]. Topalov followed up in unusual fashion, however, with a3, g3, and f4 on the next three moves, leading Susan Polgar to observe that, "Topalov made way too many Pawn moves in the opening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://susanpolgar.blogspot.com/2006/10/game-9-analysis-topalov-1-0-kramnik.html|title= Game 9 Analysis – Topalov 1–0 Kramnik|author=Susan Polgar|date=2006-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kramnik was unable to find an effective response and eventually ended up in a middlegame position where his two knights were outmatched by Topalov's powerful bishops. Topalov steadily improved his position, seizing space and launching an attack on the king-side. A strong tactical blow by Topalov on move 38 won the game for him. Kramnik, who had struggled with a steadily deteriorating position in [[chess terminology#T|time trouble]], resigned following Topalov's 39th move. Topalov took the lead for the first time in the match, with the score now 5–4.

| '''Game 10:''' Topalov played 24... f6??, sealing his doom.
}}
Kramnik played the solid [[Catalan System]]. At move 17, Topalov, playing Black, offered Kramnik the opportunity to win a pawn if he was willing to give up his fianchettoed king's bishop for a knight (and thus weaken his king position). Kramnik accepted the offer. Susan Polgar wrote that Topalov's "compensation is his Bishop pair, good Knight on e4 and the White Knight is pinned on b5."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://susanpolgar.blogspot.com/2006/10/game-10-live-commentary-kramnik-vs.html|title= Game 10 LIVE Commentary! Kramnik-Topalov|author=Susan Polgar|date=2006-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Topalov blundered on move 24, allowing Kramnik to win a second pawn. Topalov then gave up his rook for a knight and two pawns. That left Kramnik ahead a rook for a knight and, after forcing the trade of queens, he won the endgame easily. The match was now level 5–5.

The eleventh game ended in a draw after 66 moves, leaving the match level at 5½–5½. Towards the end, Kramnik was pressing hard for the full point, a pawn ahead in a rook and bishop endgame, but was unable to convert his advantage.

===Game 12, Kramnik–Topalov, ½–½ ===
This game featured the same variation of the Slav Defense (6.Nh4 Bg6 7.Nxg6 hxg6) as in games 9 (a Topalov win) and 11 (a draw), but for the first time Kramnik played the White side of this line. In a queen and rook endgame, with both kings open, Topalov forced a draw by perpetual check. This left the score tied 6–6 at the end of regular time-control play (Kramnik 6 – Topalov 5 in played games, plus the game 5 forfeit in favor of Topalov). Tie-breaker games were now played to determine the outcome of the match.

Just like in the second tiebreak game, Kramnik displayed his skill in positions where the queens have been exchanged. Topalov's small inaccuracy on move 20 was punished by a precise sequence of moves from Kramnik, which eventually won him a pawn. In an extremely difficult position, Topalov made one final [[blunder (chess)|blunder]], and the match was over.

===Allegations and forfeit===
On September 28, 2006, the rest day between games 4 and 5, Topalov's manager [[Silvio Danailov]] complained to the match organizers and the press about Kramnik's repeated visits to the bathroom. He noted that the bathrooms are the only place not under audio or video surveillance, and called the frequency of the breaks "strange, if not suspicious". Danailov suggested that Topalov would abandon the match if the concerns were not addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3370|title=Topalov threatens to abandon the World Championship Match|accessdate=2006-09-29|date=2006-09-28|publisher=[[ChessBase]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, 2006, the Appeals Committee, which consisted of Georgios Makropoulos, Jorge Vega, and [[Zurab Azmaiparashvili]], determined that, although the frequency of Kramnik's visits to the toilet had been exaggerated, the private bathrooms would be closed and a common toilet opened for both players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3372|title=Chessbase: FIDE decides: common toilet for both players|accessdate=2006-09-29|date=2006-09-29|publisher=[[ChessBase]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Kramnik's manager Carsten Hensel issued a public statement insisting that the original match conditions be adhered to – defending Kramnik's actions by saying, "The restroom is small and Mr Kramnik likes to walk and therefore uses the space of the bathroom as well...It should also be mentioned that Mr Kramnik has to drink a lot of water during the games." Otherwise, "Mr Kramnik will stop playing this match as long as FIDE is not ready to respect Mr Kramnik's rights, in this case to use the toilet of his own restroom whenever he wishes to do so." Hensel also declared his lack of confidence in the Appeals Committee and demanded that its members be changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3374|title=Chessbase: Kramnik may stop playing the match|accessdate=2006-09-29|date=2006-09-29|publisher=[[ChessBase]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awaiting a reversal of the Appeal Committee's decision, Kramnik refused to play Game 5. At 5:00 p.m. local time, the Chief Arbiter declared that Kramnik had forfeited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3375|title=Elista Express: Game five abandoned}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIDE President [[Kirsan Ilyumzhinov]] told Kramnik "...I hereby inform you of my full trust in the members of the Match Appeals Committee and their latest decision taken in respect of the appeal of Topalov's team dated 28 September 2006. I am also asking you in good faith to continue your participation in this match..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fide.com/news/download/KNI_to_Kramnik_ENG1.jpg Open letter to Vladimir Kramnik] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017213832/http://www.fide.com/news/download/KNI_to_Kramnik_ENG1.jpg |date=2006-10-17 }}, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, FIDE, 29 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, it emerged that Kramnik's team made a procedural blunder by not filing their protest before he defaulted the fifth game.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/10/03/result061003.xml "Loos open for business"], Malcolm Pein, Daily Telegraph, October 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The players were invited for a meeting by Ilyumzhinov "to discuss the actual situation of the match and to solve the problems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldchess2006.com/main.asp?id=1011|title=FIDE President's decision to postpone Game of 30 September of the Match|accessdate=2006-09-30|date=2006-09-30|publisher=FIDE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ilyumzhinov stated that cancelling the forfeit was possible, but that if no compromise was reached by noon on 1 October, the match would not continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldchess2006.com/main.asp?id=1014|title=You are playing for the entire chess world|accessdate=2006-09-30|date=2006-09-30|author=Kirsan Ilyumzhinov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012131135/http://www.worldchess2006.com/main.asp?id=1014|archivedate=2006-10-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2006, FIDE announced that agreement had been reached that the original bathroom arrangements would be reinstated and that the Appeals Committee had resigned and would be replaced.

Later that day, FIDE announced that Game 6 would be played on October 2, with the forfeit standing and the score Kramnik 3 – Topalov 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fide.com/news.asp?id=1136 Press Release 7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904060130/http://www.fide.com/news.asp?id=1136 |date=2007-09-04 }}, FIDE, October 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Kramnik replied that he was "ready to proceed playing the match by reserving all my rights. My further participation will be subject to the condition to clarify my rights regarding game five at later stage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3392|title=Elista 2006: Kramnik agrees to play (under protest)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 2006, the new Appeals Committee responded to Kramnik's appeal against the Game 5 forfeit saying that they had no powers to vary the decisions of the original Appeals Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fide.com/news.asp?id=1141 "Appeal of Vladimir Kramnik. Decision of the Appeals Committee"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018142657/http://www.fide.com/news.asp?id=1141 |date=2006-10-18 }}, FIDE, October 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, Kramnik had said that if his appeal fails, "the only thing I know for sure is that in this case I will sue FIDE."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061002/ap_on_re_eu/russia_chess|title="Chess match resumes after dispute", Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kramnik's manager expressed concern that a member of Topalov's team might attempt to plant an electronic device in Kramnik's bathroom to foster suspicion that Kramnik is cheating. He suggested several measures relating to the inspection of the bathroom and Kramnik's person meant to forestall this possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3403|title=Hensel: 'They may try to plant a device in Kramnik's room'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions===

On October 2, 2006, more than 30 [[International Grandmaster|GMs]], [[Woman Grandmaster|WGMs]], and [[International Master|IMs]] expressed open support for Kramnik's position&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3397|title=GMs support Vladimir Kramnik}}&lt;/ref&gt; – including former World Champions [[Anatoly Karpov]] and [[Boris Spassky]], and multiple-time challenger [[Viktor Korchnoi]]. Spassky and Korchnoi had been involved in controversial World Chess Championship matches ([[World Chess Championship 1972]] and [[World Chess Championship 1978]] respectively). Spassky felt that [[Bobby Fischer|Fischer]] had only disputed against the organizers, not his opponent's conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3412|title=Boris Spassky recovering from minor stroke|publisher=Chessbase|date=10 September 2006|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korchnoi, in an interview, stated that he would simply have walked out of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://en.chessbase.com/post/korchnoi-i-would-have-walked-out-|title=Korchnoi: 'I would have walked out!'|publisher=Chessbase|date=10 July 2006|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kramnik protests===

On October 10, 2006, in a press release Team Kramnik said: "Should the decision of FIDE regarding the fifth game have any influence on the awarding of the World Championship title, with Mr. Topalov receiving the title after being granted a free point for the unplayed game, Mr Kramnik declares unequivocally: "I will not recognize Mr Topalov as World Champion under these conditions, and I will take legal action against FIDE at the end of the World Championship."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3416 "Vladimir Kramnik: We will sue FIDE!"], Chessbase, October 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Kramnik won the match, this situation did not eventuate.

===Later allegations===
On October 4, Topalov's manager, Silvio Danailov, issued a press release that identified what it labeled "coincidence statistics" showing the percentage of times that Kramnik played a move that would be recommended by Chessbase's [[Fritz (chess)|Fritz 9]] chessplaying software in that position (about 78% on average).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3401|title=Silvio Danailov accuses Kramnik of using Fritz 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GM [[Susan Polgar]] – who did not believe Kramnik was using computer assistance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://susanpolgar.blogspot.com/2006/10/danailov-makes-stunning-statement.html|title="Danailov makes a stunning statement!", Susan Polgar Chess Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; – characterized this as "another black eye for Danailov and chess. Even if he believes that it is true, he should complain to the committee and not through a press release. This is unprofessional and unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://susanpolgar.blogspot.com/2006/10/game-7-live-commentary.html|title="Game 7 LIVE Commentary", Susan Polgar Chess Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the press conference following Game 7, Kramnik commented on the second game where the Fritz analysis had shown a match with 87% of Kramnik's moves. Kramnik said, "A proper analysis must take into consideration that in the second game we both blundered a mate in three! First of all, this 87% is total nonsense – everything depends on the time allotted to the engine for analyzing a given position. Secondly, Topalov's percentages in [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2005|San Luis]], for example, were even higher."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3405 "Elista Express: Topalov wins game eight with black"], Chessbase, October 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the Spanish daily ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'' published on 14 December 2006, Topalov alleged that Kramnik had cheated with computer help during the match, that network cables had been found in the bathroom ceiling, that threats were issued, and that he felt physically unsafe during the match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3553 Topalov: Kramnik will never admit that he cheated...] ''ChessBase News'', 19 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Kramnik, as the winner of the match, earned the FIDE World Champion slot in the [[World Chess Championship 2007]], an eight-player, double [[round-robin tournament]]. The loser of the match, Topalov, was eliminated from the 2007 World Championship cycle. Despite this, Topalov's manager was quoted after the match as saying "FIDE regulations allow every world champion that has lost the title to challenge the title holder. The total prize fund is 1.5 million dollars. We will find this money and will request the game to take place in Sofia. We will offer an exact date, 3rd of March 2007."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veselintopalov.net/article/match-kramnik-topalov-in-march-2007 "Match Kramnik Topalov in March 2007?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104120919/http://www.veselintopalov.net/article/match-kramnik-topalov-in-march-2007 |date=2006-11-04 }}, Unofficial Topalove website, October 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; When FIDE announced plans for the 2007–2009 World Championship cycle, it was confirmed that Topalov was excluded from the 2007 tournament, but he (along with Kramnik) was given special privileges for the 2008 and 2009 cycle.

The allegations of cheating seriously damaged relations between Kramnik and Topalov. Nine years after the match, in 2015, Kramnik stated in an interview that he does not respect Topalov as a person and will not shake hands with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://chess-news.ru/en/node/20322|title=Vladimir Kramnik: "To Put It Mildly, I Have Not a Bit of Respect For Topalov"|date=23 October 2015|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, Kramnik and Topalov still refuse to shake hands in their encounters. Their rival scores after 2006 was tied in classical chess (+3, -3, =3 as of April 2017), and despite their rivalry, their games are still in very high quality. Notable games include Topalov's brilliant sacrifice 12. Nxf7 in Corus 2008 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1482320&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Yacht racing''' is a form of [[Sailing (sport)|sport]] involving sailing [[yacht]]s and larger [[sailboat]]s, as distinguished from [[dinghy racing]]. It is composed of multiple yachts, in direct competition, racing around a course marked by [[buoy]]s or other fixed navigational devices or racing longer distances across open water from point-to-point. It can involve a series of races when buoy racing or multiple legs when point-to-point racing.
 
==History==
[[File:Yacht Racing Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|left|Yacht Racing]]
[[Yachting]], that is, recreational boating, is very old, as exemplified in the ancient poem [[Catullus 4]]:
[[File:Bermudian sail racing boats by Lady Brassey 1885.jpg|thumb|right|1883 description of the racing of Bermudian boats, by [[Anna Brassey, Baroness Brassey|Lady Brassey]], with illustrations showing the [[Bermuda rig]]. Initially, working vessels were rented for weekend racing in Bermuda, but affluent competitors of the [[Royal Bermuda Yacht Club]] soon purpose-built racers]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The yacht you see there, friends, 
says that she's been
The fastest piece of timber ever seen;
She swears that once she could have overhauled
All rival boats, whether the challenge called
For racing under canvas or with oars.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
(trans. James Michie)

"Yacht" is referred to as deriving from either Norwegian ("jagt"), Middle Low German ("jaght") or from the Dutch word jacht, which means "a swift light vessel of war, commerce or pleasure. The sporting element in the word lies in the derivation of jaght from the root jaghen, which means to hunt, chase or pursue…."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips-Birt|first=Douglas|title=The History of Yachting|year=1974|publisher=Stein and Day|location=New York|isbn=0812817044|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/yacht Free Dictionary: definition and derivation of "yacht"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal racing of boats is believed to have started with sailboats in the [[Netherlands]] some time in the 17th century. Soon, in [[England]], custom-built racing "yachts" began to emerge and the [[Royal Yacht Squadron]] was established in 1815. In 1661 [[John Evelyn]] recorded a competition between ''Katherine'' and ''Anne'', two large royal sailing vessels both of English design, "…the wager 100-1; the race from Greenwich to Gravesend and back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips-Birt|first=Douglas|title=The History of Yachting|year=1974|publisher=Stein and Day|location=New York|isbn=0812817044|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the vessels was owned, and sometimes steered, by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], the King of England. The king lost.

In 1782 the [[Cumberland Fleet]], a class of sailing vessel known for its ability to sail close to the wind, were painted racing up the [[Thames River]] with spectators viewing from a bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips-Birt|first=Douglas|title=The History of Yachting|year=1974|publisher=Stein and Day|location=New York|isbn=0812817044|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much like today, this obsession with sailing close to the wind with speed and efficiency fueled the racing community.

In the nineteenth century most yacht races were started by allotting starting positions to the competitors. Buoys were laid in a straight line, to which the competitors attached their yachts by means of spring ropes. The yachts were required to keep all the sails forward of the main mast on deck until the starting signal was given.&lt;ref&gt;Athlone Yacht Club, 'notice of race' for Lough Ree Regatta 1835 in Athlone Sentinel, 31 July 1835&lt;/ref&gt;      
The Yacht Racing Association was founded in 1875 by Prince Batthyany-Strattman, Captain J. W. Hughes, and Mr. Dixon Kemp.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon Kemp's manual of Yacht &amp; Boat sailing and Architecture, 11th edition of 1913&lt;/ref&gt; The Y.R.A. wrote standardised yacht racing rules which included the 'Flying Start' used today.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon Kemp's manual of Yacht &amp; Boat sailing and Architecture, 11th edition of 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

Bringing yacht racing to the forefront of public life, the [[America's Cup]] was first raced in 1851 between the [[New York Yacht Club]] and the [[Royal Yacht Squadron]]. Not ruled or regulated by measurement criteria as today, it is the second-place finisher was Aurora, "and but for the fact that time allowance had been waived for the race she would have been the winner by a handsome margin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips-Birt|first=Douglas|title=The History of Yachting|year=1974|publisher=Stein and Day|location=New York|isbn=0812817044|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, the Cup races were conducted, usually every 3–4 years, based on a challenge issued by one club to the current Cup holder, which till 1983 was the NYYC.

As at 2017,  the  La Ciotat Based Yacht [[Partridge 1885]] is documented as being the world's oldest, still fully operational classic racing yacht.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yachtingworld.com/blogs/andrew-brays-blog/the-worlds-oldest-racing-yacht-12231 |title=The world’s oldest racing yacht? |publisher=Yachting World |author= |date=22 October 2008 |website=www.yachtingworld.com |format= |quote= |access-date=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/419960733986831222/|title= he bowman gets a good dousing on "Partridge", one of the oldest yachts ..... |publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.regatesroyales.com/en/home-uk/historic |title=Cannes &amp; the Régates Royales |publisher=Société des Régates de Cannes |author= |date= |website=www.regatesroyales.com |format= |quote= |access-date=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules and ratings==
[[File:Yacht race photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|left|A yacht race at the finish line]]
[[File:Santa Cruz 70 Retro off Newport Beach California photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|left|Santa Cruz 70 Retro 2013 Ahmanson Cup regatta, [[Newport Beach, California]].]]
As yacht racing became more prevalent, and yacht design more diverse, it was necessary to establish systems of measurements and time allowances due to the differences in boat design. Longer yachts are inherently faster than shorter ones; therefore, in the interests of fairness, in the 1820s a “primitive system of time allowance was introduced on the [[Solent]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips-Birt|first=Douglas|title=The History of Yachting|year=1974|publisher=Stein and Day|location=New York|isbn=0812817044|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger yachts were handicapped; but owners with the biggest vessels had a problem with the allowance system, for they preferred that crossing the finish line first, much as in foot and horse races, should suffice to win the contest. As a result, both ratings and “[[one-design]]” competition were developed.

Ratings systems rely upon some formulaic analysis of usually very specific yacht-design parameters such as length, [[sail area]], [[displacement (ship)|displacement]], and hull shape. During the 1920s and through the 1970s the [[Cruising Club of America]] established a formula by which most racing/cruising boats were designed during that period. After its descendant, the mathematically complex [[International Offshore Rule]] (IOR) of the 1970s, contributed to much decreased seaworthiness (and even speed), the simpler [[Performance Handicap Racing Fleet]] (PHRF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Sailing.|url=http://offshore.ussailing.org/Page1130.aspx|access-date=2012-06-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310012408/http://offshore.ussailing.org/Page1130.aspx|archive-date=2012-03-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; system was adopted. The PHRF uses only proven performance characteristics, especially theoretical sailing speed, as a means to allow dissimilar yachts—typically crewed by friends and families at clubs rather than by professional crews—to race together. Most popular family-oriented cruising sailboats will have a rating filed with a local chapter of the PHRF.

The most prevalent handicap rating systems today are the [[Offshore Racing Congress|ORC]], [http://offshore.ussailing.org/ORR.htm ORR], [[IRC (sailing)|IRC]], and the [[PHRF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Offshore Home|url=http://offshore.ussailing.org/Offshore_Home.htm|access-date=2012-04-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324144937/http://offshore.ussailing.org/Offshore_Home.htm|archive-date=2012-03-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many countries organise their own handicap systems which do not take into account the size, weight, or sail area of the yacht, but performance is measured on the basis of previous race results. The Irish E.C.H.O. system is such a handicap system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sailing.ie/Racing/Handicapping |title=ECHO and IRC Handicapping |publisher=Irish Sailing Administrator |author= |date= |website=www.sailing.ie |format= |quote= |access-date=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[One-design]] racing was invented by Thomas (Ben) Middleton in 1886 in Killiney Bay close to Dublin City, Republic of Ireland. Middleton was concerned that winning a yacht race was more reliant on having an expensive new yacht, than it was on the skill of the yachtsman.&lt;ref&gt;The water Wags 1887-2012 by Alfred and Vincent Delany&lt;/ref&gt; One design yacht racing  is conducted with classes of similar boats, all built—often via mass-production—to the same design, with the same sail area and rig, and the same number of crew, so that crew ability and tactical expertise are more likely to decide a race than boat type, or age, or even weather. Popular racing boats such as The Water Wag, Laser, the [[J/22]] and [[J/24]], the [[Etchells]], and the Star and New York 30 of [[Nathanael Herreshoff]] are examples of one-design boats.

In general, modern yacht-racing contests are conducted according to the [[Racing Rules of Sailing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISAF : About The Racing Rules of Sailing.|url=http://www.sailing.org/documents/rrs-background.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; first established in 1928.&lt;ref name="The Racing Rules of Sailing"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rushall|first=Mark|title=The Racing Rules of Sailing|url=http://www.rushall.net/images/stories/pdf/the_racing_rules_of_sailing.pdf|publisher=Rushall Partnership|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though complex, the RRS are intended primarily simply ensure fairness and safety. The Rules are revised and updated every four years by the body now known as [[World Sailing]].

==Notable races==
The major races of today can be classified as offshore, ocean, around the world, and inshore racing all adhering to one set of rule, but diverse handicapping standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steward|first=Sue &amp; Anthony|title=Top Yacht Races of the World|year=2000|publisher=New Holland|location=London|isbn=1859743943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offshore races===

* [[Marblehead to Halifax Ocean Race|Marblehead to Halifax race]] – founded in 1905, the race runs from Marblehead, Massachusetts to Halifax, Nova Scotia covering over 360 miles of racing.
* [[Coastal Classic]] – starting in 1982 this race is New Zealand’s premiere fleet race. Covering about 125 miles, it is shorter than most offshore races and runs north from Auckland to Russell, which is at the northern tip of New Zealand’s North Island.
* [http://www.rhkyc.org.hk/sanfernandorace.htm San Fernando] – this race, started in 1975 with six yachts, runs a distance of 500 miles between Hong Kong and the Philippines.
* [http://www.governorscup.co.za The Governor's Cup] – this race, started in 1996 with 15 yachts, runs a distance of 1700 miles between Simon's Town in South Africa and St. Helena Island in the South Atlantic.
* [[Regata del Sol al Sol]] - established in 1968, this race runs from the St. Petersburg Yacht Club in St. Petersburg, Florida to Isla Mujeres, Mexico, a small island 8 miles Northeast of Cancún in the Caribbean Sea. This race runs a distance of 500 nautical miles. Typically, two dozen or more boats from all over the Gulf of Mexico compete in this regatta, with LOA ranging from 35 to 80 feet.

===Ocean classics===
* [[Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race|Ostar]] – first held in 1960, organised by the Royal Western Yacht Club, the Ostar runs from Plymouth to Newport (in 1960 the finish line was in New York). It is a single-handed race, against the prevailing wind and current in the North Atlantic. The race is held every 4 years but has become an amateur race in the early 21st century. Originally, the Ostar was the main race for offshore sailors, but has meanwhile lost its status to the Route du Rhum. The race covers about 3,000 miles.

===Around-the-world races===
* [[Volvo Ocean Race]] – formerly known as the [[Whitbread Round the World Race]], it started in 1973/74. This race is one of the pinnacles of yacht racing, mostly professionally crewed. Originally a four leg race constituting 27,930 miles, it is now a nine leg race.
* [[VELUX 5 Oceans Race]] – formerly known as the BOC Challenge and later the Around Alone, this race started in 1982 with 17 entries. It is a single-handed race around the world, originally with 4 legs but now with 3.
* [[Global Challenge]] – this race was established in 1992/93 by Scottish sailing icon Sir Chay Blythe, the first person to sail around the world alone against the prevailing winds and currents. This is what makes this race unique, participants “beat” their way against the sea which makes for very uncomfortable, but safer, sailing conditions than sailing downwind. The race is sailed in one-design boats that are designed and built specifically for the race. The crews cannot be professional, and are made up of novice sailors who pay for a berth.
* [[Vendée Globe]] – this race, known as the ''Everest of the Seas'' for its difficulty&lt;ref name="Eastaugh"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eastaugh|first1=Sophie|title=Vendee Globe: 66-year-old solo sailor takes on 'Everest of the Seas'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/04/sport/rich-wilson-vendee-globe-sailing/index.html|website=[[CNN]]|accessdate=15 November 2017|date=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, started November 26, 1989 with 13 entries. It is a single handed, non-stop, without assistance race. The first race took 120 days, and only 7 finished.
* [[Jules Verne Trophy]] – established in 1993 the race was designed to be a race against the clock, not other boats. Participants can start any time, have any design, any number of crew, and the only two rules are: 1)start and finish at the Ile d’Ouessant, and 2) complete the journey under 80 days.
* [[Clipper Round the World Yacht Race]] - established by [[Robin Knox-Johnston|Sir Robin Knox-Johnston]], the first man to perform a single-handed non-stop circumnavigation of the globe, the first Clipper race took place in 1996. The race is sailed in a fleet of 12 one-design boats that are designed and built specifically for the race. Each yacht is crewed by a professional skipper and paying novice sailors. It is the longest yacht race, with multiple stopovers and taking 11 months to complete the circumnavigation.
* [[Barcelona World Race]] – double-handed (two-crew) non-stop sailing around the world on [[International Monohull Open Classes Association|IMOCA Open 60]] yachts and organized by [[Fundació Navegació Oceànica Barcelona]].

===Inshore races===
* [[Admiral's Cup|The Admirals Cup]] – created in 1957 by the Admiral of the Royal Ocean Racing Club, it is raced every two years. This is a competition between countries who are allowed to send one team and three boats of a chosen one design class. It appears that due to international disagreements that this event no longer takes place.
* The [[America's Cup]] – established in 1851, this is the oldest, and arguably the most prestigious, exclusive event in yacht racing. Participants are restricted to a measurement formula for the boats, and the rules concerning the same have been controversial since the very beginning. The English, who were the challengers for the first 132 years of the race, commented "England rules the waves, but America waives the rules." This race was not traditionally an inshore race, due to the requirement that the British boat would sail to the racing area, which involved sailing trans-Atlantically.
*[[The Heather Cup]] - Contested annually as part of the [[Auckland Anniversary Regatta]], itself founded in 1840, and contested on over 170 yearly occasions since establishment (halted briefly during the Boer/South African War).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2478">'''Zimmerman Field''' was a [[stadium]] located in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].  It opened in 1938 and hosted the [[University of New Mexico]] [[Lobo (New Mexico mascot)|Lobos]] [[New Mexico Lobos football|football]] team until they moved to [[University Stadium, Albuquerque|University Stadium]] in 1960.  The stadium continued in use for intramural sports until 1969, when it was demolished to make way for new academic facilities.

The stadium held 16,000 people at its peak and was located on the central campus just south of Zimmerman Library, where Ortega Hall, the Humanities building and Woodward Hall currently stand.  It featured a three-story [[Pueblo Revival]]-style grandstand designed by [[John Gaw Meem]] on the west side of the field, located where the CERIA building currently stands. The stadium was constructed using [[Public Works Administration]] funds on the site of University Field, which had been in use by the football team since 1892.

The stadium was variously known as University Stadium, Hilltop Stadium, and Lobo Stadium until November 1946 when the athletic field was renamed Zimmerman Field in honor of James F. Zimmerman, who was president of the University from 1927 to 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wernette Dedicates Football Field To Memory of Late Dr. Zimmerman|newspaper=Albuquerque Journal|date=November 17, 1946|page=1|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25694064/wernette_dedicates_football_field_to/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was also briefly the first home of the [[University of New Mexico School of Law]], which occupied four rooms of the second floor of the grandstand from 1947 to 1952, when it moved to the first Bratton Hall, now the Economics building next to the University House.
