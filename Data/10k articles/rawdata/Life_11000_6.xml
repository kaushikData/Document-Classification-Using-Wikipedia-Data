The '''2011 Stepping Hill Hospital poisoning incident''' refers to a  series of deaths at the [[Stepping Hill Hospital]] in [[Stockport]], Greater Manchester, which began in July 2011.

==Background and investigation==
They used to specialise in Tonsil removal. The investigation was sparked by a nurse on a ward at the hospital, who noticed that several patients on the ward had unexpected low [[blood sugar]] levels. An investigation suggested that a number of [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] [[ampoule]]s and [[saline drip]]s had been [[contamination|contaminated]] with [[insulin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-14166920 |title=BBC News – Police investigate three deaths at Stepping Hill Hospital |publisher=BBC  |date=15 July 2011 |accessdate=23 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110722051417/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-14166920| archivedate= 22 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this was believed to have lowered the blood sugar levels in the patients.

[[Insulin]] is a hormone produced by the [[pancreas]] to allow the uptake of [[glucose]] in the blood to be used by the muscles and cells of the body for energy. The brain requires a constant supply of glucose in order to be able to function properly. As insulin lowers the level of glucose in the blood, if too much of it is present in the circulation this can quickly lead to lowered blood glucose levels, commonly known as low blood sugar (or [[hypoglycemia]]); which as a consequence  negatively affects the functioning of the brain and central nervous system. This can be rapidly and irreversibly fatal if not recognised and treated early enough. At Stepping Hill it was suspected that, due to the increased levels of insulin in the patients' [[bloodstream]]s, they quickly became hypoglycemic and three confirmed fatalities occurred. A number of other patients are also believed by police to have been poisoned in this way, though most did not suffer fatal consequences. Two further deaths in the A1 and A3 wards were added to the investigation on 21 July.&lt;ref name="menmedia1"/&gt;

Three patients' deaths – two elderly males, George Keep, 84 and Arnold Lancaster, 71, and a female – Tracey Arden, 44 – were attributed to the alleged contamination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-14199024 |title=Stepping Hill Hospital deaths: Suspect 'may be on site' |publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=19 July 2011 |accessdate=23 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110722051410/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-14199024| archivedate= 22 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it was also reported that each of the patients also had underlying medical conditions that made them weaker. On 21 July 2011, it was confirmed that two more patients' deaths were being linked to the investigation, bringing the death count to five.&lt;ref name="menmedia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1441840_breaking-five-deaths-at-stepping-hill-hospital-now-being-investigated-in-saline-sabotage-case |title=Tributes to 5th patient to die in Stepping Hill saline sabotage probe as police ar e given more time to question nurse &amp;#124; Manchester Evening News |publisher=menmedia.co.uk |date=11 July 2011 |accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Stepping-Hill-Hospital-Five-Patients-Dead-After-Saline-Sabotage-As-Nurse-Rebecca-Leighton-Held/Article/201107316034887?lpos=UK_News_Carousel_Region_0&amp;lid=ARTICLE_16034887_Stepping_Hill_Hospital%3A_Five_Patients_Dead_After_Saline_Sabotage_As_Nurse_Rebecca_Leighton_Held |title=Stepping Hill Hospital: Nurse Rebecca Leighton Held For More Time After Five People Have Now Died &amp;#124; UK News &amp;#124; Sky    |publisher=News.sky.com |accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greater Manchester Police]] (GMP) announced that the inquiry into how saline solutions had been contaminated with insulin would form the basis of a murder [[inquiry]]. During the investigation, 60 detectives were involved in determining how and when the saline solutions were contaminated. Meanwhile, a number of [[armed police]] guards were stationed at the hospital, and staff were made to work in pairs when administering medication to patients.

==Rebecca Leighton==
On 20 July 2011, GMP confirmed that they had arrested a 27-year-old female nurse – Rebecca Jane Leighton, who worked at the hospital on ward A1 and A3 – in connection with the murder inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14214375 |title=BBC News – Stepping Hill Hospital: Nurse arrested in murder probe |publisher=BBC  |date= 20 July 2011|accessdate=23 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110721190831/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14214375| archivedate= 21 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] opened a fitness to practice investigation after the arrest of Leighton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nursing regulator opens fitness to practise proceedings in Stepping Hill case|url=http://www.nmc-uk.org/Press-and-media/Latest-news/Nursing-regulator-opens-fitness-to-practise-proceedings-in-Stepping-Hill-case/|publisher=Nursing and Midwifery Council|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ford|first=Steve|title=Registered nurse arrested over Stepping Hill deaths named|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/legal/registered-nurse-arrested-over-stepping-hill-deaths-named/5032828.article|accessdate=20 July 2011|newspaper=Health Service Journal|date=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 July, Leighton appeared at Manchester City Magistrates' court. She was charged with three counts of [[Criminal damage in English law#Aggravated criminal damage|criminal damage with intent to endanger life]], three counts of criminal damage being reckless as to whether life was being endangered, and one charge of theft. She was [[Remand (detention)|remanded in custody]] to next appear at Manchester Crown Court on 1 August.&lt;ref name=Court1&gt;{{cite news|title=Stepping Hill Hospital: Rebecca Leighton remanded in custody|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-14259202|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=23 July 2011|date=23 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723171048/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-14259202| archivedate= 23 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charges against Leighton were dropped on 2 September 2011. The Crown Prosecution Service said it was "no longer appropriate" to continue the case against her. Evidence that was expected to appear in support of the charges had not become available. [[Nazir Afzal]], Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North West, said Leighton had been charged on the basis there was "reasonable suspicion she had committed the offences and there were reasonable grounds for believing the continuing investigation would provide further evidence within a reasonable amount of time".
&lt;ref name=Dropped&gt;{{cite news|title=Stepping Hill saline deaths: Nurse Rebecca Leighton charges dropped|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-14769486|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 September 2011|date=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently hired celebrity publicist [[Max Clifford]] to help clear her name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-14817456 | work=BBC News | title=Rebecca Leighton: Nurse seeks help from Max Clifford | date=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 2011, it was reported that Leighton had been dismissed from her job as a nurse at Stepping Hill Hospital. She had been suspended ever since the allegations were first made nearly five months earlier.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-16009023 | work=BBC News | title=Nurse Rebecca Leighton dismissed from Stepping Hill | date=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An appeal hearing, presided over by Stockport NHS Foundation Trust, against her sacking was held on Thursday 2 February 2012 but the appeal was dismissed. The Trust said it was unable to comment because of confidentiality issues and there was no response from Leighton's lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-16878821 | work=BBC News | title=Stepping Hill nurse Rebecca Leighton loses sack appeal | date=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also revealed on that day that police were now investigating a total of 19 deaths at the hospital as possible victims of saline poisoning.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

==Victorino Chua==
On 5 January 2012 it was revealed that a death that had taken place on 31 December 2011 – i.e. after Leighton had been dismissed – was now being linked to the investigation. 46-year-old Victorino Chua, a nurse at the hospital, had been arrested amid claims that forms had been altered and a patient given extra medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-16425566 | work=BBC News | title=Stepping Hill Hospital saline inquiry: Nurse arrested | date=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later also questioned on the earlier deaths.&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/08/stepping-hill-nurse-questioning | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Helen | last=Carter | title=Stepping Hill hospital nurse bailed | date=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not charged with any offence and was placed on police bail.&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt; By July 2012, the Greater Manchester Police stated that they were making good progress in the investigation, that twenty-two people had been poisoned and that seven deaths had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stepping Hill probe making good progress|url=http://www.gmp.police.uk/content/WebsitePages/39B75DCED2569ADF80257A3800290443?OpenDocument|publisher=Greater Manchester Police|accessdate=30 September 2012  |date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March 2014 Victorino Chua was charged with the murders of Tracey Arden, Arnold Lancaster and Alfred Derek Weaver, and 31 other offences including [[Grievous bodily harm|GBH]] and attempted poisoning. He was remanded in custody to appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-26795910 | work=BBC News | title= Stepping Hill deaths: Nurse Victorino Chua charged with murder | date=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 May 2015 Victorino Chua was convicted on two counts of murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-32782153 | work=BBC News | title= Stepping Hill nurse Victorino Chua guilty of murdering patients | date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was found not guilty of murdering Arnold Lancaster, who had been suffering from terminal cancer, but was convicted of attempting to cause him and twenty other patients [[grievous bodily harm]] with intent by poisoning. He was also found guilty of eight offences of unlawfully administering or causing to be taken by another person any poison or destructive or noxious thing with intent to injure, aggrieve or annoy, or attempting to do so, after deliberately altering prescriptions. The jury at Manchester [[Crown Court]] had deliberated for eleven days.&lt;ref name="GMP"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nurse, Victorino Chua, found guilty|url=http://www.gmp.police.uk/live/Nhoodv3.nsf/WebsitePages/8F1E494100468EED80257E49004316C2?OpenDocument|accessdate=18 May 2015|work=Greater Manchester Police|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Belfast"&gt;{{cite news|title='Evil angel' nurse guilty of murder|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/evil-angel-nurse-guilty-of-murder-31231264.html|accessdate=18 May 2015|work=Belfast Telegraph|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fallowfield|first1=Carl|title=Nurse guilty of murdering patients|url=http://www.cumbriacrack.com/2015/05/18/nurse-guilty-of-murdering-patients/|accessdate=18 May 2015|work=Cumbria Crack|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chua received 25 life sentences and was told that he would spend a minimum of 35 years in jail before he would be eligible for parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-32795255| title=Stepping Hill nurse Victorino Chua jailed for life| work=BBC News| date=19 May 2015| accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She contributed to the study of [[galaxies]] with her co-authorship of ''A Survey of the External Galaxies Brighter Than the Thirteenth Magnitude'', which was later known as the [[Shapley-Ames Catalog|Shapley-Ames catalog]].&lt;ref name="news"&gt;''Research Astronomer Lost by Drowning.''

([http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1932PA.....40..448. online])&lt;/ref&gt; Ames was a member of the [[American Astronomical Society]]. She was a contemporary of [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]] and her closest friend at the observatory.&lt;ref name="news2"&gt;Barbara L. Welther: ''Adelaide Ames and the Shapley-Ames Catalogue''.

==Biography==
Ames attended [[Vassar College]] until 1922 and then studied at [[Radcliffe College]], where there was a recently created graduate program in astronomy. Ames graduated in 1924 as the first woman with an [[Master of Arts|M.A]] in Astronomy at Radcliffe.&lt;ref name="Payne-Gaposchkin1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin|title=Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin: An Autobiography and Other Recollections|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LYh6hZaMqZcC&amp;pg=PA30|date=21 March 1996|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-48390-2|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally she had planned to become a journalist, but she found no work in the area and instead accepted a job as a research assistant at the [[Harvard College Observatory]] (HCO), a position she held until her death.&lt;ref name="news" /&gt; The focus of her work was the cataloging of galaxies in the constellations [[Coma Cluster|Coma]] and Virgo. In 1931, the finished catalog included nearly 2800 objects. This work earned her membership in the IAU Commission 28 on Nebulae and Star Clusters.

On June 26, 1932, while vacationing on Squam Lake, Ames was taking a canoe tour with a friend on the lake when it capsized. She was presumed to have drowned and her body was found after a ten-day search on July 5, 1932.&lt;ref name="news" /&gt; She died at the age of 32.

==Research at Harvard==
In 1921, [[Harlow Shapley]] became director of HCO, and soon afterward hired Ames as an assistant.&lt;ref name="news2" /&gt; Ames was Shapley's first graduate student and Ames went on to supervise her own graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sobel|first1=Dava|title=The Glass Universe: How the Ladies of the Harvard Observatory Took the Measure of the Stars|date=2016|publisher=Viking|location=New York|isbn=978-0670016952}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her early work at Harvard focused on the identification of [[New General Catalogue|NGC/IC object]]s. In 1926, she and Shapley published several articles on the shapes, colors, and diameters of 103 NGC galaxies.&lt;ref name="Prakash2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nirmala Prakash|title=Dark Matter, Neutrinos, and Our Solar System|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yD3vsVcx81IC&amp;pg=PA6|year=2013|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|isbn=978-981-4304-53-5|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, she published ''A catalog of 2778 nebulae including the Coma-Virgo group'', which identified 214 NGC and 342 IC objects in the area of the [[Virgo cluster]].&lt;ref name="Steinicke"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steinicke|title=Observing and Cataloguing Nebulae and Star Clusters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wyWjVWYWoO8C&amp;pg=PA467|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49010-8|pages=467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shapley-Ames Catalog===
During her tenure at the Harvard College Observatory, she worked together with Harlow Shapley on the Shapley-Ames catalog, which lists galaxies beyond the 13th magnitude. From their observations of approximately 1250 galaxies, they found evidence of clustering near the north pole of the Milky Way that differs from the south pole.&lt;ref name="Dick2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven J.

'''Al-Abbas ibn al-Ma'mun''' (died 838 CE) was an [[Abbasid]] prince and general, the son of the [[Abbasid Caliph]] [[al-Ma'mun]] ({{reign|813|833}}). A distinguished military leader in the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]], he was passed over in the succession in favour of his uncle [[al-Mu'tasim]] ({{reign|833|842}}). In 838, he was arrested for his involvement in a failed [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] against al-Mu'tasim, and died in [[prison]].

==Biography==
Abbas was the son of al-Ma'mun by the [[concubine]] Sundus.{{sfn|Turner|2013}} In 828–829, al-Ma'mun appointed him as governor of [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Al-Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia)]] and the Mesopotamian military frontier zone (''[[thughur]]'') with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Abbas distinguished himself in the expeditions against Byzantium for his bravery.{{sfn|Turner|2013}}{{sfn|Zetterstéen|1960|pp=11–12}} In the summer of 830, Abbas led an expedition against the [[Khurramite]] rebels of [[Babak Khorramdin]] in [[Azerbaijan]]. The campaign was accompanied by a contingent of Byzantine captives under the renegade general [[Manuel the Armenian]], who, given Abbas's relative inexperience, may have been the actual commander of the army.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=272}}. Abbas's force met with some success against the Khurramites, and began its return. As it passed near the Byzantine frontier at [[Hadath]], Manuel, having earned the confidence of Abbas and his Arab officers, persuaded Abbas to cross the nearby passes and raid Byzantine territory. Once there, Manuel took advantage of a hunt to disarm Abbas and his entourage and defect back to the Empire, along with some of the other Byzantine captives. Abbas with his men were left behind and after rejoining their army, they retreated back over the mountains into the Caliphate.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=273}}

[[File:Asia Minor ca 842 AD.svg|thumb|right|275px|Map of Byzantine Asia Minor and the Byzantine-Arab frontier region in the middle of the 9th century.]]
In the next year, Abbas accompanied his father and uncle in a major expedition into Byzantine [[Anatolia]]. After the Arab army crossed the [[Cilician Gates]] and took [[Heraclea Cybistra]] in early July, it divided in three corps, headed by the Caliph, al-Mu'tasim and Abbas, and proceeded to raid across [[Cappadocia]]. The other two forces achieved little of consequence in the already repeatedly devastated area, but Abbas met with more success: he forced the town of [[Tyana]] to capitulate and razed it, and met and defeated the Byzantine army under the emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] ({{reign|829|842}}) in a minor skirmish.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=275–276, 279}} Al-Ma'mun kept up the pressure on Byzantium in 832, with his army capturing the strategically important fortress of [[Loulon]], and in late 832 the Caliph began gathering a huge army and announced that he intended to conquer and colonize Anatolia step by step, and finally subjugate the Empire by capturing [[Constantinople]] itself. Consequently, on 25 May 833, Abbas with the advance force marched into Byzantine territory and began creating a military base at the site of Tyana. The site had been fortified and awaited the arrival of the Caliph's army, which in early July crossed into Anatolia. At this juncture al-Ma'mun fell ill and died, although some modern scholars speculate that his death may have been the result of a coup.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=279–281}}{{sfn|Gordon|2001|p=47}}

On receiving news of the Caliph's illness, Abbas abandoned his army and sped to his father's encampment, where he joined his uncle al-Mu'tasim at al-Ma'mun's deathbed.{{sfn|Turner|2013}} As al-Ma'mun's son, and given his prominent role in his father's last campaigns, Abbas was considered a contender for the succession, although it is unclear if he was ever formally appointed heir apparent, as [[al-Dinawari]] claims.{{sfn|Turner|2013}} His main rival was his uncle al-Mu'tasim, who according to the account of [[al-Tabari]] was named heir by al-Ma'mun on his deathbed.{{sfn|Turner|2013}} Whatever the true events, al-Mu'tasim was ascendant, as demonstrated by the fact that he performed the funerary prayer for his brother.{{sfn|Turner|2013}} Abbas swiftly and publicly swore allegiance to al-Mu'tasim, thereby moving to assuage the troops, many of whom were displeased at Abbas being passed over, and wanting to proclaim him caliph instead.{{sfn|Zetterstéen|1960|pp=11–12}}{{sfn|Gordon|2001|pp=47–48}}

Nevertheless, al-Mu'tasim's hold on the throne was still shaky, and he abandoned Ma'mun's campaign; the new base at Tyana was razed, and the still restive army returned to the Caliphate.{{sfn|Zetterstéen|1960|pp=11–12}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=281}} Despite his acceptance of his uncle's succession, Abbas was removed from his governorship of the frontier lands, but retained the support of several leading figures in the Abbasid court.{{sfn|Turner|2013}} He soon became the focus of the factions opposed to al-Mu'tasim, and in particular his increasing reliance on, and favour shown to, his [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] slave-soldiers (''[[ghilman]]''). This discontent resulted in an alleged conspiracy led by the general [['Ujayf ibn 'Anbasa]] which aimed to kill Mu'tasim and place Abbas on the throne. The plot was reportedly uncovered while al-Mu'tasim was campaigning against the Byzantines, with the Caliph informed of it just after the celebrated [[Sack of Amorium]]. The resulting investigation, headed by Mu'tasim's trusted Turkish general [[Ashinas]], resulted in the execution of most conspirators. This was broadened into a virtual purge of the army, in which the hitherto dominant [[Khurasan|Khurasani]] element was replaced with al-Mu'tasim's favoured Turks.{{sfn|Gordon|2001|pp=48–49, 76–78}} According to al-Tabari, Abbas confessed to knowing of the plot while drunk. He was imprisoned at [[Manbij]] by another of al-Mu'tasim's lieutenants, [[al-Afshin]], who executed him by a slow and torturous way: Abbas was fed very salty food, denied water, and exposed to the sun wrapped in a felt blanket, until he died.{{sfn|Turner|2013}}{{sfn|Zetterstéen|1960|pp=11–12}} His four brothers by Sundus were imprisoned by [[Itakh]] in his basement, and were never seen again.{{sfn|Turner|2013}} while Abbas'  male descendants were imprisoned and executed by Ashinas.{{sfn|Gordon|2001|p=77}}

'''Antti Juhani Ahokas''' (born 24 January 1985) is a [[Finland|Finnish]] professional [[golf]]er.

Ahokas was born in [[Lappeenranta]]. After winning the Finnish Amateur Stroke Play Championship in 2005, he moved to the [[United States]] to attend the [[University of Minnesota]], but left after just three months to return to Europe and further his ambitions as a [[professional golfer|professional]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mndaily.com/2009/02/22/struggling-gophers-look-turn-season-around |title=Struggling Gophers look to turn season around |publisher=[[Minnesota Daily]] |date=24 March 2006 |accessdate=2009-04-16}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Ahokas won the Irish Amateur Open Stroke Play Championship beating future world number 1 and major winner [[Rory McIlroy]] in a playoff.

Having turned professional in 2006, Ahokas just failed to come through the [[PGA European Tour|European Tour]] final [[qualifying school]], and joined the second tier [[Challenge Tour]] for the 2007 season. In 2008, he won for the first time at the [[Argentine Open|Abierto VISA de la Republica]], becoming the first left-hander to take that title. Later in the season he won again at the [[ECCO Tour Championship]], and gained promotion the elite European Tour by ending the season ranked 19th on the money list.

'''Bloody Sunday''' or '''Red Sunday'''&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Modern Europe 1789–1968'' by Herbert L. Peacock m.a.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-rus|Крова́вое воскресе́нье|r=Krovávoye voskresén'e|p=krɐˈvavəɪ vəskrʲɪˈsʲenʲjɪ}}) is the name given to the events of Sunday, {{OldStyleDate|22 January|1905|9 January}} in [[Saint Petersburg|St Petersburg]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], when unarmed demonstrators led by Father [[Georgy Gapon]] were fired upon by soldiers of the [[Leib Guard|Imperial Guard]] as they marched towards the [[Winter Palace]] to present a petition to [[Emperor of All Russia|Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia]].

Bloody Sunday caused grave consequences for the [[Tsarist autocracy]] governing Imperial Russia: the events in St. Petersburg provoked public outrage and a series of massive strikes that spread quickly to the industrial centres of the Russian Empire. The massacre on Bloody Sunday is considered to be the start of the active phase of the [[Revolution of 1905]]. In addition to beginning the 1905 Revolution, historians such as [[Lionel Kochan]] in his book ''Russia in Revolution 1890–1918'' view the events of Bloody Sunday to be one of the key events which led to the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917.

==Background==
After the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|emancipation of the serfs]] in 1861 by Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]], there emerged a new [[peasant]] [[working class]] in Russia’s industrializing cities.  Prior to emancipation, no working class could be established because serfs working in the cities to supplement their incomes retained their ties to the land and their masters.  Although the working conditions in the cities were horrific, they were only employed for short periods of time and returned to their village when their work was complete or it was time to resume agricultural work.&lt;ref&gt;, Walter Sablinsky, ''The Road to Bloody Sunday: Father Gapon and the St. Petersburg Massacre of 1905'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1976), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emancipation of the serfs resulted in the establishment of a permanent working class in urban areas, which created a strain on traditional Russian society.  Peasants “were confronted by unfamiliar social relationships, a frustrating regime of factory discipline, and the distressing conditions of urban life.”&lt;ref&gt;Sablinsky, The Road to Bloody Sunday, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This new group of peasant workers made up the majority of workers in urban areas.  Generally unskilled, these peasants received low wages, were employed in unsafe working environments, and worked up to fifteen hours a day.  Although some workers still had a paternalistic relationship with their employer, factory employers were more present and active than the noble landowners that previously had ownership of the serfs.  Under serfdom, peasants had little, if any, contact with their landowner.  In the new urban setting, however, factory employers often used their absolute authority in abusive and arbitrary manners.  Their abuse of power, made evident by the long [[working time|working hours]], low [[wage]]s, and lack of safety precautions, led to [[strike action|strikes]] in Russia.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Early strikes===
“The Russian term for strike, ''stachka'', was derived from an old colloquial term, ''stakat’sia''- to conspire for a criminal act.”&lt;ref&gt;Sablinsky, The Road to Bloody Sunday, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, Russian laws viewed strikes as criminal acts of conspiracy and potential catalysts for rebellion.  The governmental response to strikes, however, supported the efforts of the workers and promoted strikes as an effective tool that could be used by the workers to help improve their working conditions.  Tsarist authorities usually intervened with harsh punishment, especially for the leaders and spokesmen of the strike, but often the complaints of the strikers were reviewed and seen as justified and the employers were required to correct the abuses about which the strikers protested.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

These corrections did not address a grossly unbalanced system that clearly favoured the employers.  This caused the continuation of strikes and the first major industrial strike in Russia, which occurred in the year 1870 in St. Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;Sablinsky, ''The Road to Bloody Sunday'', 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  This new phenomenon was a catalyst to many more strikes in Russia, which increased until they reached a peak between 1884 and 1885 when 4,000 workers went on strike at Morozov's cotton mill.&lt;ref&gt;Sablinsky, ''The Road to Bloody Sunday'', 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  This large strike prompted officials to consider regulations that would restrain the abuses of employers and ensure safety in the workplace.  A new law was passed in 1886 that required employers to specify working conditions in their factories in writing.  This included the treatment of the workers, the workers' hours, and the safety precautions that were taken by the employer.  This new law also created factory inspectors who were charged with preserving industrial peace.  Despite these changes, strike activity again reached high proportions during the 1890s, resulting in the restriction of the workday to eleven and a half hours in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Sablinsky, ''The Road to Bloody Sunday'', 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Father Gapon===
[[File:Батька Гапон.jpg|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Father [[Georgy Gapon]], a Russian Orthodox priest, led the workers' procession to present a petition to the Tsar on {{OldStyleDate|January 22|1905|January 9}}, known as Bloody Sunday&lt;/center&gt;]]

A leading role in these events was played by a priest Father [[Georgy Gapon]].&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Ascher, ''The Revolution of 1905: A Short History'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2004), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Fr. Gapon was a charismatic speaker and effective organiser, who took an interest in the [[working class|working]] and [[Underclass|lower classes]] of the Russian cities.

The "Assembly of the Russian Factory and Mill Workers of the City of St. Petersburg", otherwise known as “the Assembly”, had been headed by Fr. Gapon since 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Ascher, The Revolution of 1905, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly was patronized by the Department of the Police and the St. Petersburg [[Okhrana]] (secret police); during 1904 the membership of the association had grown rapidly, although more radical groups saw it as being a "police union" – under government influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Black Night White Snow | author=Salisbury, Harrison E. | publisher=Da Capo Press | year=1981 | ISBN=0-306-80154-X | pages=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly's objectives were to defend workers' rights and to elevate their moral and religious status. In the words of Fr. Gapon, this organization served as:

{{quote|…a noble endeavor, under the guidance of truly Russian educated laymen and clergy, to foster among the workers a sober, Christian view of life and to instill the principle of mutual aid, thereby helping to improve the lives and working conditions of laborers without violent disruption of law and order in their relations with employers and the government.|G.A. Gapon|quoted in Sablinsky, The Road to Bloody Sunday, 89}}

The Assembly served as a type of union for the workers of St. Petersburg.  Depicted as strictly conservative in its support of the autocracy, the Assembly was a means of preventing revolutionary influences and appeasing the workers by striving for better conditions, hours, and pay.  The Assembly would act as one of the catalysts for what would later be known as Bloody Sunday.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

== Prelude ==
===Putilov incident===
In December 1904, four workers at the [[Kirov Plant|Putilov Ironworks]] in St Petersburg were fired because of their membership of the Assembly, although the plant manager asserted that they were fired for unrelated reasons. Virtually the entire workforce of the Putilov Ironworks went on strike when the plant manager refused to accede to their requests that the workers be rehired.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Harcave, ''First Blood: The Russian Revolution of 1905'' (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1964), 68-71.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sympathy strikes in other parts of the city raised the number of strikers up to 150,000 workers in 382 factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Black Night White Snow | author=Salisbury, Harrison E. | publisher=Da Capo Press | year=1981 | ISBN=0-306-80154-X | page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; By {{OldStyleDate|21 January|1905|8 January}}, the city had no electricity and no newspapers whatsoever and all public areas were declared closed.

===Petition and preparation for the March===
The decision to prepare and present a petition was made in the course of discussions during the evening of {{OldStyleDate|19 January|1905|6 January}}, at the headquarters of Father Gapon's movement—the "Gapon Hall" on the Shlisselburg Trakt in Saint Petersburg. The petition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://academic.shu.edu/russianhistory/index.php/Workers%27_Petition,_January_9th,_1905_(Bloody_Sunday) Petition Prepared for Presentation to Nicholas II], Documents in Russian History.&lt;/ref&gt; as drafted in respectful terms by Gapon himself, made clear the problems and opinions of the workers and called for improved working conditions, fairer wages, and a reduction in the working day to eight hours. Other demands included an end to the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and the introduction of [[universal suffrage]]. The idea of a petition resonated with the traditionally minded working masses.  From the 15th to the early 18th centuries individual or collective petitions were an established means of bringing grievances to the attention of the Tsar's administration.  They could be submitted to the Petitions [[Prikaz]] (office) in Moscow, or directly to the Tsar or his courtiers when the tsar was making an appearance outside the palace.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The march on the [[Winter Palace]] was not a revolutionary or rebellious act. Political groups, such as the [[Bolsheviks]], [[Mensheviks]], and the [[Social Revolutionary Party|Social Revolutionaries]] disapproved of the procession due to its lack of political demands.&lt;ref&gt;Ascher, The Revolution of 1905 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fr. Gapon even encouraged his followers to tear up leaflets that supported revolutionary aims.&lt;ref&gt;Harcave, First Blood, 73.&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority of Russian workers retained their traditional conservative values of Orthodoxy, faith in the autocracy, and indifference to political life.&lt;ref&gt;Sablinsky, The Road to Bloody Sunday, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  The workers of St. Petersburg wished to receive fair treatment and better working conditions; they decided, therefore, to petition the tsar in hopes he would act on it.  In their eyes, the tsar was their representative who would help them if he was made aware of their situation.  God appointed the tsar, therefore the tsar had an obligation to protect the people and do what was best for them. Their petition was written in subservient terms and ended with a reminder to the tsar of his obligation to the people of Russia and their resolve to do what it took to ensure their pleas were met.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Blom, The Vertigo Years: Europe (New York: Basic Books, 2008), 140.&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded: "And if Thou dost not so order and dost not respond to our pleas we will die here in this square before Thy palace". Gapon, who had an ambiguous relationship with the Tsarist authorities, sent a copy of the petition to the Minister of the Interior together with a notification of his intention to lead a procession of members of his workers' movement to the Winter Palace on the following Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Black Night White Snow | author=Salisbury, Harrison E. | publisher=Da Capo Press | year=1981 | ISBN=0-306-80154-X | pages=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Troops had been deployed around the Winter Palace and at other key points. Despite the urging of various members of the imperial family to stay in St. Petersburg, the Tsar left on Saturday {{OldStyleDate|21 January|1905|8 January}} for [[Tsarskoye Selo]]. A cabinet meeting, held without any particular sense of urgency that same evening, concluded that the police would publicize his absence and that the workers would accordingly probably abandon their plans for a march.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Black Night White Snow | author=Salisbury, Harrison E. | publisher=Da Capo Press | year=1981 | ISBN=0-306-80154-X | page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events of Sunday 22 January==
===Beginning of march===
[[Image:BloodySunday1905.jpg|thumb|250px|right|&lt;center&gt;Still from the Soviet movie ''Devyatoe Yanvarya'' ("9th of January") (1925) showing a line of armed soldiers facing demonstrators at the approaches to the [[Winter Palace]] in [[Saint Petersburg|St Petersburg]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
In the pre-dawn winter darkness of the morning of Sunday, {{OldStyleDate|22 January|1905|9 January}}, striking workers and their families began to gather at six points in the industrial outskirts of St Petersburg. Holding religious [[icon]]s and singing hymns and patriotic songs (particularly "[[God Save the Tsar!]]"), a crowd of "more than 3,000"&lt;ref&gt;Gapon, Address to the Tsar, February 1905, in Ascher, ''The Revolution of 1905'', Vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt; proceeded without police interference towards the [[Winter Palace]], the Tsar's official residence. The crowd, whose mood was quiet, did not know that the Tsar was not in residence. Insofar as there was firm planning, the intention was for the various columns of marchers to converge in front of the palace at about 2 pm. Estimates of the total numbers involved range wildly from police figures of 3,000 to organizers' claims of 50,000. Initially, it was intended that women, children and elderly workers should lead, to emphasize the united nature of the demonstration. [[Vera Karelina]], who was one of Gapon's inner circle, had encouraged women to take part and she expected that there would be casualties. On reflection, younger men moved to the front to make up the leading ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Black Night White Snow | author=Salisbury, Harrison E. | publisher=Da Capo Press | year=1981 | ISBN=0-306-80154-X | page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government measures===
[[Image:BloodySunday1905b.jpg|thumb|left|250px|&lt;center&gt;Soviet painting of the Bloody Sunday massacre in St Petersburg&lt;/center&gt;]]
A report had been made to the Tsar at Tsarskoe Selo on Saturday night on the measures being taken to contain the marchers. Substantial military forces were deployed in and around the environs of the Winter Palace. These comprised units of the Imperial Guard, who provided the permanent garrison of Saint Peterburg and [[Cossack]]s, plus infantry regiments brought in by rail in the early morning of 9 January from Revel and Pskov. The troops, who now numbered about 10,000, had been ordered to halt the columns of marchers before they reached the palace square but the reaction of government forces was inconsistent and confused. Individual policemen saluted the religious banners and portraits of the Tsar carried by the crowd or joined the procession. Army officers variously told the marchers that they could proceed in smaller groups, called on them to disperse or ordered their troops to fire into the marchers without warning. When the crowds continued to press forward, Cossacks and regular cavalry made charges using their sabres or trampling the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Black Night White Snow | author=Salisbury, Harrison E. | publisher=Da Capo Press | year=1981 | ISBN=0-306-80154-X | pages=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shootings===
The first instance of shooting occurred between 10 and 11 am. There was no single encounter directly before the Winter Palace, as often portrayed, but rather a series of separate collisions at the bridges or other entry points to the central city. The column led by Gapon was fired upon near the [[Narva Gate]]. Around forty people were killed or wounded there, although Gapon himself was not injured.&lt;ref&gt;Ascher, Abraham. ''The Revolution of 1905''. Stanford, Calif.: Stanford UP, 1988. p. 91. Print&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As late as 2 pm large family groups were promenading on the [[Nevsky Prospekt]] as was customary on Sunday afternoons, mostly unaware of the extent of the violence elsewhere in the city. Amongst them were parties of workers still making their way to the Winter Palace as originally intended by Gapon. A detachment of the Preobrazhensky Guards previously stationed in the Palace Square where about 2,300 soldiers were being held in reserve, now made its way onto the Nevsky and formed two ranks opposite the Alexander Gardens. Following a single shouted warning a bugle sounded and four volleys were fired into the panicked crowd, many of whom had not been participants in the organized marches.&lt;ref name="Salisbury, Harrison E. 1981 125"&gt;{{cite book | title=Black Night White Snow | author=Salisbury, Harrison E. | publisher=Da Capo Press | year=1981 | ISBN=0-306-80154-X | page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casualties===

[[File:Nas ruas de S. Petersburgo — Cossacos e mais forças do Czar matando e chicoteando homens, mulheres e crianças.jpg|thumb|300px|Bloody Sunday ([[Angelo Agostini]], ''[[O Malho]]'', [[1905]]).]]

The total number killed in the day's clashes is uncertain but the Tsar's officials recorded 96 dead and 333 injured; anti-government sources claimed more than 4,000 dead; moderate estimates still average around 1,000 killed or wounded, both from shots and trampled during the panic.&lt;ref name="Salisbury, Harrison E. 1981 125"/&gt; Another source noted that the official estimate was 132 people killed.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas V. Riasanovsky, ''A History of Russia'', 4th edition, Oxford University Press, 1984, {{ISBN|0-19-503361-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Leon Trotsky]] did not put forward a precise figure but claimed that hundreds were killed and that many casualties were secretly buried by the authorities. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1907/1905/ch06.htm Trotsky, Leon ''1905'' Chapter 6, ''Ninth January''&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas II described the day as "painful and sad".&lt;ref&gt;Kurth, Peter. ''Tsar: the Lost World of Nicholas and Alexandra''. Boston: Back Bay, 1998. p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; As reports spread across the city, disorder and [[looting]] broke out. Gapon's Assembly was closed down that day, and Gapon quickly left [[Russia]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Reactions===
Although the Tsar was not at the Winter Palace and did not give the order for the troops to fire, he was widely blamed for the inefficiency and callousness with which the crisis had been handled. While it was unrealistic for the marchers to expect Nicholas to ride out into the Palace Square to meet them, his absence from the city, against at least some advice, reflects a lack of imagination and perception that he was to show on other occasions. The killing of people, many of whom had seen the Tsar as their "Little Father", resulted in a surge of bitterness towards Nicholas and his autocratic rule. A widely quoted reaction was "we no longer have a Tsar".

This event was seen by the British ambassador as inflaming revolutionary activities in Russia and contributing to the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|Revolution of 1905]]. Media commentary in Britain and the United States was overwhelmingly negative towards the actions of an already unpopular regime. The writer [[Leo Tolstoy]] was emotionally impacted by the event,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=[[s:Life of Tolstoy|Life of Tolstoy]] |last=Rolland |first=Romain |year=1911 |publisher=T. Fisher Unwin |location=London |isbn= |page=212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the revulsion of liberal, socialist and intellectual opinion within Russia itself.

==Consequences==
{{Main|Revolution of 1905}}
The immediate consequence of Bloody Sunday was a strike movement that spread throughout the country.  Strikes began to erupt outside of St. Petersburg in places such as Moscow, Riga, Warsaw, Vilna, Kovno, Tiflis, Baku, Batum, and the Baltic region.  In all, about 414,000 people participated in the work stoppage during January 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Ascher, The Revolution of 1905, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tsar Nicholas II attempted to appease the people with a Duma; however, the autocracy eventually resorted to brute force near the end of 1905 in order to curtail the burgeoning strike movement that continued to spread.  It is estimated that between October 1905 and April 1906, 15,000 peasants and workers were hanged or shot, 20,000 injured, and 45,000 sent into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Blom, The Vertigo Years, 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most significant effect of Bloody Sunday was the drastic change in the attitude of the Russian peasants and workers.  Previously the tsar had been seen as the champion of the people: in dire situations, the masses would appeal to the tsar, traditionally through a petition, and the tsar would respond to his people promising to set things right.  The lower classes placed their faith in the tsar. Any problems that the lower classes faced were associated with the [[boyar]]s of Russia; however, after Bloody Sunday the tsar was no longer distinguished from the bureaucrats and was held personally responsible for the tragedy that occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Sablinsky, The Road to Bloody Sunday, 274.&lt;/ref&gt;  The social contract between the tsar and the people was broken, which delegitimized the position of the tsar and his divine right to rule.  Although Bloody Sunday was not initiated as a revolutionary or rebellious movement, the repercussions of the government’s reaction laid the foundations for revolution by bringing into question autocracy and the legitimacy of the tsar.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

'''Charles of France, Duke of Berry,''' (31 July 1686 – 5 May 1714) was a grandson of [[Louis XIV of France]]. Although he was only a grandson of Louis XIV, Berry held the rank of ''[[fils de France]]'' ("son of France"), rather than ''petit-fils de France'' ("grandson of France"), as the son of the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]], heir apparent to the throne. The Duke of Berry was for seven years [[heir presumptive]] to the throne of Spain (1700–1707), till his brother Philip V fathered a son in 1707.

==Biography==
Born at the [[Palace of Versailles]], Charles was the youngest son of [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1661–1711)|Louis, Dauphin of France]], "''le Grand Dauphin''," and of [[Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria]]. He was raised under the supervision of the royal governess [[Louise de Prie]].

One of three children, he was the uncle of the future [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], who was the son of his brother, [[Louis of France, Duke of Burgundy|Louis, Duke of Burgundy]]. Charles' other brother, Philip, Duke of Anjou, was the future [[Philip V of Spain]]. Charles was styled Duke of Berry (''duc de Berry'') at his birth, but never actually possessed that Duchy.  In 1710, he was invested with his [[apanage]], consisting in the duchies of [[Duke of Alençon|Alençon]], of [[Duke of Angoulême|Angoulême]], county of [[Count of Ponthieu|Ponthieu]] and other minor fiefs.&lt;ref&gt;See the Letters patent: ''Louis, par la grâce de Dieu, roy de France et de Navarre, à tous présens et à venir, SALUT. (…) Notre très-cher et très-amé petit-fils Charles, fils de France, a dignement répondu à nos espérance (…) Pour ces causes et autres à ce Nous mouvans, de l’avis de notre conseil, Nous avons donné, octroyé et délaissé, et par ces présentes signées de notre main, donnons, octroyons et delaissons à notredit petit-fils Charles, fils de France, et à ses enfans mâles descendans de lui en loyal mariage, pour leur appanage et entretenement, selon la nature des appanages de la Maison de France et les lois de notre royaume, les duchés d’Alençon et d’Angoulême, le comté de Ponthieu et les châtellenies de Coignac et de Merpins, réunis à notre couronne par le décès de notre cousine Elisabeth d’Orléans, duchesse de Guise, ensemble les terres et seigneuries de Noyelles, Hiermont, Coutteville et le Mesnil, par Nous acquises par contrat passé entre les commissaires par Nous nommez, et Marie d’Orléans, duchesse de Nemours, le 16 Decembre 1706, en échange de la baronie, terre et seigneuries de Parthenay (…)''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ponthieu was exchanged some month later for other domains. By a special brevet, his grandfather permitted him to keep the title "Duke of Berry", which he held until his death.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.

As the third son of the Dauphin, Berry was not expected to inherit the throne; and at his father's death in 1711, his oldest brother [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1682-1712)|Louis, Duke of Burgundy]] became Dauphin.

However, in agreement with the testament of Charles II, king of Spain, the Duke of Berry was heir presumptive to the Spanish throne from November 1700 until 25 August 1707 (birth of his nephew [[Louis I of Spain|Louis, Prince of Asturias]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chivalricorders.org/royalty/bourbon/france/success/d1tstch2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613023623/http://chivalricorders.org/royalty/bourbon/france/success/d1tstch2.htm |archivedate=13 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}: ''We do declare, with reference to the stipulations made above, that, if the said Duke of Anjou should die before We are Ourselves called to God, or should He accede to the Throne of France and prefer to wear that Crown rather than that of these Our Realms, then the said Crown shall pass to the Duke of Berry, His brother, and the third son of the said Dauphin, and that all the conditions set out above shall pertain in this eventuality''.&lt;/ref&gt; He renounced all his rights to the Spanish succession on 24 November 1712, in application of the [[treaties of Utrecht]].

As a result of the prestige of his birth, cadet branches of the royal family saw in him a splendid match for their daughters.  One of his aunts, [[Louise-Françoise de Bourbon|Louise-Françoise de Bourbon, ''princesse de Condé'']], a legitimised daughter of Louis XIV and [[Françoise-Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan|Madame de Montespan]], proposed her beautiful daughter, [[Louise Élisabeth de Bourbon]], but the marriage proposal came to naught, much to the annoyance of the [[Princes of Condé|House of Bourbon-Condé]].

The Princess de Condé's sister, [[Françoise-Marie de Bourbon|Françoise-Marie de Bourbon, ''duchesse d'Orléans'']], then suggested a union with her eldest daughter, [[Marie Louise Élisabeth d'Orléans]]. The marriage with Marie Louise Élisabeth, daughter of [[Philip II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans]], the future [[Regent]] of France, took place on 6 July 1710. A [[miscarriage]] ended the first pregnancy of Marie Louise Élisabeth. Two years later, she gave birth to a premature boy who lived just a few weeks. She was again pregnant at the time of her husband's death but miscarried a girl one month, later. The Duchess was notoriously unfaithful to her husband and even thought of running away with her lover La Haye.

[[Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate|Elizabeth Charlotte]], Duchess Dowager of Orléans, (known as ''Madame Palatine'' or ''La Palatine''), and the grandmother of Berry's wife, nicknamed him "''Berry Bon Cœur''" ("Berry Good Heart") and later wrote on the marriage between him and her granddaughter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
At first he was passionately fond of his wife; but at the end of three months he fell in love with a little, ugly, ''[[Maid|femme de chambre]]''. The [[Duchess]], who had sufficient penetration, was not slow in discovering this, and told her husband immediately that, if he continued to live upon good terms with her, as he had done at first, she would say nothing about it, and act as if she were not acquainted with it; but if he behaved ill, she would tell the whole affair to the King, and have the ''femme de chambre'' sent away, so that he should never hear of her again. By this threat she held the [[Duke]], who was a very simple man, so completely in check, that he lived very well with her up to his death, leaving her to do as she pleased, and dying himself as fond as ever of the ''femme de chambre''. A year before his death he had her married, but on the condition that the husband should not exercise his marital rights. He left her pregnant as well as his wife, both of whom lay-in after his decease. Madame de Berry, who was not jealous, retained this woman, and took care of her and her child. One month later, the Duchess gave birth prematurely to a girl who died the next day. During the regency of her father, the young widow became known as a Messalina, ill-reputed for the debauched life she led in her [[Luxembourg Palace]]. Her health rapidly undermined by gluttony, alcoholism and a series of clandestine pregnancies, Madame de Berry died on 21 July 1719. The autopsy revealed that the princess was again with child although she had almost died at the end of March 1719, when giving birth to a still-born child allegedly fathered by her captain of the guards.&lt;ref&gt;Soulié, Dussieux et Feuillet de Conches (éds.) ''Journal du Marquis de Dangeau avec les additions du duc de Saint-Simon'', Paris, Firmin Didot 1860, vol 18, 1719-1720, p.89&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1712, Berry's eldest brother, [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1682-1712)|Louis, Duke of Burgundy, Dauphin of France]], and the latter's elder son, Louis, Duke of Brittany died. It was foreseeable that Berry would serve as Regent for his brother's younger son, [[Louis XV of France|Louis, Duke of Anjou]]. But, on 5 May 1714, he died from internal injuries sustained in a hunting accident. His death rendered the details of the [[Régence|Regency]] less straightforward than before.

The '''Duke''' and the '''Duchess of Berry''' had three children, none of whom survived infancy. As [[Fils de France|Grandchildren of France]], they needed a surname. However, since their father was Duke of Berry only by name, their surname was not "de Berry" but "d'Alençon", taken from his first substantial duchy.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal du Marquis de [[Philippe de Dangeau|Dangeau]]'' (on 3 January 1712): ''J'appris que les enfants de monseigneur le duc de Berry ne porteront point le nom de Berry, mais celui d'Alençon; comme les enfants de Monsieur portoient le nom d'Orléans, ceux-là porteront celui d'Alençon.

'''Cytoplasmic male sterility''' is total or partial male sterility in [[plants]] as the result of specific [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] and [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Gómez-Campo C | title=Biology of Brassica Coenospecies|publisher=Elsevier|year=1999|pages=186–189|isbn=978-0-444-50278-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male sterility is the failure of plants to produce functional [[anther]]s, [[pollen]], or male [[gametes]].

==Background==
[[Joseph Gottlieb Kölreuter]] was the first to document male sterility in plants.  He reported anther abortion within species and specific hybrids. 

[[Cytoplasm|Cytoplasmic]] male sterility (CMS) has now been identified in over 150 plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schnable P, Wise RP | title = The molecular basis of cytoplasmic male sterility and fertility restoration|journal=Trends in Plant Science | date=May 1998 | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 175–180 | doi = 10.1016/S1360-1385(98)01235-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Male sterility is more prevalent than female sterility.   This could be because the male [[sporophyte]] and [[gametophyte]] are less protected from the environment than the [[ovule]] and [[embryo]] sac, or because male sterility results from natural selection on mitochondrial genes which are maternally inherited and are thus not involved in pollen production. Male-sterile plants can propagate, since they can set seed.  Female-sterile plants develop no seeds. 

Male sterility can arise spontaneously via mutations in [[nuclear gene]]s and/or cytoplasmic genes.  Male sterility is easy to detect because a large number of pollen grains are produced and can be easily studied. Male sterility can be assayed through staining techniques ([[carmine]], [[lactophenol]] or [[iodine]]). 


Male sterility can be either cytoplasmic or cytoplasmic&amp;ndash;genetic. CMS is caused by the [[extranuclear genome]] ([[mitochondria]] or [[chloroplast]]) and shows maternal inheritance. Manifestation of male sterility in CMS may be controlled either entirely by cytoplasmic factors or by interaction between cytoplasmic and nuclear factors.

==Cytoplasmic male sterility==
Cytoplasmic male sterility, as the name indicates, is under extranuclear genetic control (under control of the mitochondrial or plastid genomes). It shows [[Non-Mendelian inheritance|non-Mendelian inheritance]]
, with male sterility inherited maternally. In general, there are two types of cytoplasm: N (normal) and aberrant S (sterile) cytoplasms. These types exhibit reciprocal differences.

==Cytoplasmic-genetic male sterility==
While CMS is controlled by an extranuclear genome, nuclear genes may have the capability to restore fertility. When nuclear restoration of fertility genes ("Rf") is available for a CMS system in any crop, it is cytoplasmic&amp;ndash;genetic male sterility; the sterility is manifested by the influence of both nuclear (with Mendelian inheritance) and cytoplasmic (maternally inherited) genes. There are also restorers of fertility (''Rf'') genes that are distinct from genetic male sterility genes. The ''Rf'' genes have no expression of their own unless the sterile cytoplasm is present. ''Rf'' genes are required to restore fertility in S cytoplasm that causes sterility. Thus plants with N cytoplasm are fertile and S cytoplasm with genotype ''Rf''- leads to fertiles while S cytoplasm with ''rfrf'' produces only male steriles. Another feature of these systems is that ''Rf'' mutations (''i.e.'', mutations to ''rf'' or no fertility restoration) are frequent, so that N cytoplasm with ''Rfrf'' is best for stable fertility.

Cytoplasmic&amp;ndash;genetic male sterility systems are widely exploited in crop plants for hybrid breeding due to the convenience of controlling sterility expression by manipulating the gene&amp;ndash;cytoplasm combinations in any selected [[genotype]].  Incorporation of these systems for male sterility evades the need for emasculation in cross-pollinated species, thus encouraging cross breeding producing only hybrid seeds under natural conditions.

==In hybrid breeding==
Hybrid production requires a female plant in which no viable male gametes are borne. [[Emasculation]] is done to prevent a plant from producing pollen so that it serves only as a female parent. Another simple way to establish a female line for hybrid seed production is to identify or create a line that is unable to produce viable pollen. Since this male-sterile line cannot self-pollinate, seed formation is dependent upon pollen from the male line. Cytoplasmic male sterility is used in hybrid seed production. In this case, the sterility is transmitted only through the female and all progeny will be sterile. This is not a problem for crops such as onions or carrots where the commodity harvested from the [[F1 generation]] is produced during vegetative growth. These CMS lines must be maintained by repeated crossing to a sister line (known as the maintainer line) that is genetically identical except that it possesses normal cytoplasm and is therefore male-fertile. In cytoplasmic&amp;ndash;genetic male sterility restoration of fertility is done using restorer lines carrying nuclear genes. The male-sterile line is maintained by crossing with a maintainer line carrying the same nuclear genome as the MS line but with normal fertile cytoplasm.

===In hybrid maize breeding===
Cytoplasmic male sterility is an important part of hybrid [[maize]] production. The first commercial cytoplasmic male sterile, discovered in Texas, is known as CMS-T. The use of CMS-T, starting in the 1950s, eliminated the need for [[detasseling]]. In the early 1970s plants containing CMS-T genetics were susceptible to [[southern corn leaf blight]] and suffered from widespread loss of yield. Since then, CMS types C and S are used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weider|first1=Christophe|last2=Stamp|first2=Peter|last3=Christov|first3=Nikolai|last4=Hüsken|first4=Alexandra|last5=Foueillassar|first5=Xavier|last6=Camp|first6=Karl-Heinz|last7=Munsch|first7=Magali | name-list-format = vanc | title=Stability of Cytoplasmic Male Sterility in Maize under Different Environmental Conditions|journal=Crop Science|date=2009|volume=49|issue=1|pages=77|doi=10.2135/cropsci2007.12.0694}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately these types are prone to environmentally induced fertility restoration and must be carefully monitored in the field. Environmentally induced, in contrast to genetic, restoration occurs when certain environmental stimuli signal the plant to bypass sterility restrictions and produce pollen anyway.

Genome sequencing of mitochondrial genomes of crop plants has facilitated the identification of promising candidates for CMS-related mitochondrial rearrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuteja R, Saxena RK, Davila J, Shah T, Chen W, Xiao YL, Fan G, Saxena KB, Alverson AJ, Spillane C, Town C, Varshney RK | title = Cytoplasmic male sterility-associated chimeric open reading frames identified by mitochondrial genome sequencing of four Cajanus genotypes | journal = DNA Research | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 485–95 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23792890 | pmc = 3789559 | doi = 10.1093/dnares/dst025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The systematic sequencing of new plant species in recent years has also uncovered the existence of several novel RF genes and their encoded proteins. A unified nomenclature for the RF defines protein families across all plant species and facilitates comparative functional genomics. This nomenclature accommodates functional RF genes and [[pseudogene]]s, and offers the flexibility needed to incorporate additional RFs as they become available in future.&lt;ref name="pmid21203394"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kotchoni SO, Jimenez-Lopez JC, Gachomo EW, Seufferheld MJ | title = A new and unified nomenclature for male fertility restorer (RF) proteins in higher plants | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = e15906 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21203394 | pmc = 3011004 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0015906 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deathbed phenomena''' refers to a range of [[paranormal]] experiences claimed by people who are [[Death|dying]]. There are many examples of deathbed phenomena in both non-fiction and fictional literature, which suggests that these occurrences have been noted by cultures around the world for centuries, although scientific study of them is relatively recent. In scientific literature such experiences have been referred to as death-related sensory experiences (DRSE).&lt;ref name="Ethier2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ethier | first1 = A | year = 2005 | title = Death-related sensory experiences | url = | journal = Journal of Pediatric Oncology Nursing | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 104–111 | doi=10.1177/1043454204273735| pmid = 15695352 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dying patients have reported to staff working in [[hospice]]s they have experienced comforting visions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brayne | first1 = S | last2 = Farnham | first2 = C | last3 = Fenwick | first3 = P | year = 2006 | title = Deathbed phenomena and their effect on a palliative care team: a pilot study | url = | journal = American Journal of Hospice and Palliative Medicine | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 17–24 | pmid = 16450659 | doi=10.1177/104990910602300104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lawrence | first1 = M | last2 = Repede | first2 = E | year = 2013 | title = The incidence of deathbed communications and their impact on the dying process | url = | journal = American Journal of Hospice and Palliative Care | volume = 30 | issue = 7| pages = 632–639 | pmid = 23236088 | doi=10.1177/1049909112467529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scientists consider deathbed phenomena and visions to be [[hallucination]]s.&lt;ref name="Siegel 1980"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Siegel | first1 = Ronald | authorlink = Ronald K.

Prometheus Books. p. 102. {{ISBN|978-1573929790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deathbed visions ==

[[wikt: deathbed|Deathbed]] visions have been described since ancient times, however the first systematic study was not conducted until the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Blom2009"&gt;Blom, Jan. (2009). ''A Dictionary of Hallucinations''. Springer. pp. 131-132. {{ISBN|978-1441912220}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been referred to as veridical hallucinations, visions of the dying and predeath visions.&lt;ref name="Ethier2005"/&gt; The physician [[William F. Barrett|William Barrett]], author of the book ''Death-Bed Visions'' (1926), collected anecdotes of people who had claimed to have experienced visions of deceased friends and relatives, the sound of music and other deathbed phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[[William F. Barrett|Barrett, William]]. (1926). ''Death-Bed Visions''. Methuen &amp; Company Limited. {{ISBN|978-0850305203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrett was a Christian [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] and believed the visions were evidence for [[spirit]] communication.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim, Janet. (1985). ''The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914''. Cambridge University Press. p. 365. {{ISBN|978-0521265058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted between 1959 and 1973 by the parapsychologists [[Karlis Osis]] and [[Erlendur Haraldsson]], they reported that 50% of the tens of thousands of individuals they studied in the [[United States]] and [[India]] had experienced deathbed visions.&lt;ref name="Blom2009"/&gt; Osis and Haraldsson and other parapsychologists such as [[Raymond Moody]] have interpreted the reports as evidence for an [[afterlife]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Moody|Moody, Raymond]]. (1975). ''[[Life After Life (book)|Life After Life]]''. Mockingbird Books. {{ISBN|978-0553122206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Osis, K. and Haraldsson, E. (1977). ''At The Hour of Death''. Avon. {{ISBN|978-0380018024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neurologist [[Terence Hines]] has written that the proponents of the afterlife interpretation grossly underestimate the variability among the reports. Hines also criticized their methodology of collecting the reports:

{{quote|The way in which the reports are collected poses another serious problem for those who want to take them seriously as evidence of an afterlife. Osis and Haraldsson’s (1977) study was based on replies received from ten thousand questionnaires sent to doctors and nurses in the United States and India. Only 6.4 percent were returned. Since it was the doctors and nurses who were giving the reports, not the patients who had, presumably, actually had the experience, the reports were secondhand. This means they had passed through two highly fallible and constructive human memory systems (the doctor’s or nurse’s and the actual patient’s) before reaching Osis and Haraldsson. In other cases (i.e., Moody 1977) the reports were given by the patients themselves, months and years after the event. Such reports are hardly sufficient to argue for the reality of an afterlife.&lt;ref name="Hines2003"/&gt;}}

The skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] has written deathbed visions (DBVs) are based on anecdotal accounts that are unreliable. In not reviewing the entire context of accounts he believed he had discovered contradictions and inconsistencies in various DBVs reported by the paranormal author Carla Wills-Brandon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (2002). [http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/visitations_after-death_contacts/ ''"Visitations": After-Death Contacts'']. ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''.the Volume 12. Retrieved November 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research within the Hospice &amp; Palliative Care fields have studied the impact of deathbed phenomena on the dying, their families, and palliative staff. In 2009, a questionnaire was distributed to 111 staff in an Irish hospice program asking if they had encountered staff or patients who had experienced DBP. The majority of respondents that they had been informed of a deathbed vision by a patient or the patient's family. They reported that the content of these visions often seemed to be comforting to the patient and their family.&lt;ref&gt;MacConville U, McQuillan, R. Surveying deathbed phenomena. Irish Medical Times. 2010, May 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that DBPs are commonly associated with peaceful death and are generally under-reported by patients and families due to fear of embarrassment and disbelief from medical staff.&lt;ref&gt;Fenwick P, Lovelace H, Brayne S. Comfort for the dying: five year retrospective and one year prospective studies of end of life experiences. Arch of Gerontology &amp; Geriatrics. 2010;51:173-179.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this qualitative data, there is a growing movement within the palliative care field that emphasizes "compassionate understanding and respect from those who provide end of life care" in regards to DBPs.&lt;ref&gt;Fenwick P, Brayne S. End-of-life experiences: Reaching out for compassion, communication, and connection – meaning of deathbed visions and coincidences. Am J of Hospice &amp; Pall Med. 2011;28(1):7-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific evaluation ==

According to [[Ronald K. Siegel]], noted American psychopharmacologist and researcher, there is a high degree of similarity between deathbed visions and [[Hallucinogen|drug-induced hallucinations]]. Hallucinations caused by drugs frequently contain images of otherworldly beings and deceased friends and relatives.&lt;ref name="Siegel 1980"/&gt; Some scientists who have studied cases of deathbed phenomena have described the visual, auditory, and sensed presences of deceased relatives or angelic beings during the dying process as hallucinations. These hallucinations are theorized to occur due to a number of explanations including but not limited to [[cerebral hypoxia]], confusion, [[delirium]], body systems failures (e.g., renal, hepatic, pulmonary), and a mental reaction to stress.&lt;ref&gt;Brayne S, Lovelace H, Fenwick P. End-of-life experiences and the dying process in a Gloucestershire nursing home as reported by nurses and care assistants. Am J of Hospice &amp; Pall Med. 2008;25(3):195-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the body is injured, or if the heart stops, even if only for a short period, the brain is deprived of oxygen. A short period of cerebral hypoxia can result in the impairment of neuronal function. It is theorized that this neuronal impairment accounts for deathbed visions.&lt;ref&gt;Brierley, J. and D. Graham. (1984). ''Hypoxia and Vascular Disorders of the Central Nervous System''. In ''Greenfield’s Neuropathology'' edited by J. Adams, J. Corsellis, and L. Duchen. 4th edition.

'''''Edward II''''' is a 1991 British [[historical film|historical]] [[drama film|tragedy]] film directed by [[Derek Jarman]] and starring [[Steven Waddington]], [[Tilda Swinton]] and [[Andrew Tiernan]]. It is based on the [[Edward II (play)|play of the same name]] by [[Christopher Marlowe]]. The plot revolves around [[Edward II of England]]'s infatuation with [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Piers Gaveston]], which proves to be the downfall of both of them, thanks to the machinations of [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]].

The film is staged in a [[postmodern]] style, using a mixture of contemporary and [[medieval]] props, sets and clothing. (The date "1991" appears on a royal proclamation at one point.) The gay content of the play is also brought to the fore by Jarman, notably by adding a homosexual sex scene and by depicting Edward's army as [[gay rights]] protesters.

==Plot==
Once installed as king, Edward II summons his friend and lover, [[Piers Gaveston]], to his side and showers him with gifts, titles and abiding love. Their relationship is fiery and passionate, but it is the focus of gossip and derision throughout the kingdom. Upon his return, Gaveston takes revenge on the Bishop of Winchester, who had been responsible for his banishment from England during the previous reign, by personally [[torture|torturing]] him. Kent, Edward's brother, is the first to protest Gaveston's return. Many others feel the same way, including the Bishop of Winchester and [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Lord Mortimer]], who is in charge of the kingdom's army forces. Nevertheless, Edward defends his lover from his mounting enemies.

A pleasure-seeker, Edward is quite distracted from affairs of state, much to the distress and anger of the court (sombre men and women in business suits). [[Isabella of France|Queen Isabella]], Edward's French wife, vainly tries everything to win him back from his lover, but she is mercilessly rejected by her husband. Love-starved, Isabella turns to Gaveston, who inflames Isabella's desire by whispering obscenities in her ear, and then mocks her responsiveness.

The handsome, hedonistic and opportunistic Gaveston repels everyone except the King. His enemies join forces and threaten Edward with dethronment and exile; Edward is forced to comply with their wishes and sends Gaveston away. The lovers' separation is serenaded by [[Annie Lennox]]’s rendition of [[Cole Porter]]'s "[[Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye]]".

The queen hopes that once Gaveston is away she could reconcile with her husband, but he rejects her once again. In a last effort to regain her husband's affection, she allows Gaveston to return. The king and his lover resume their relationship, but their enemies are ready to strike back.

Isabella and Mortimer, who has become her lover, plan to rule the realm through Edward and Isabella's young son, the future [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. When Kent tries to save his brother, he is murdered by Isabella. The nobles are soon plotting to get rid not only of Gaveston but also the king. Mortimer, their leader, is a military man and practising [[sadomasochism|sadomasochist]] who takes a grim pleasure in personally torturing Gaveston and the lovers' friend Spencer, who he addresses as "girl boy." Their torture takes place while there is a clash between the police and members of the British gay rights organisation Outrage.

After Gaveston and Spencer's assassinations, Edward, who has been thrown in a dungeon, is executed by impalement on a red-hot poker. This hideous fate is presented as a nightmare from which the imprisoned king awakens. The executioner, when he does arrive, tosses away his lethal weapon and kisses the man he was sent to kill.

Back in the castle, Mortimer and Isabella enjoy their triumph just briefly. The king's young son, Edward III, who all along has been neglected by both parents and who has witnessed their quarrels, has donned his mother's earrings and lipstick and, while listening to classical music on his [[Walkman]], walks atop a cage that imprisons his mother and Mortimer.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[intelligent agent]] that interacts with the environment through a physical body within that environment.  Agents that are represented graphically with a body, for example a human or a cartoon animal, are also called embodied agents, although they have only virtual, not physical, embodiment. A branch of artificial intelligence focuses on empowering such agents to interact autonomously with [[human being]]s and the environment. [[Mobile robot]]s are one example of physically embodied agents; [[Ananova]] and [[Microsoft Agent]] are examples of graphically embodied agents. '''Embodied conversational agents''' are embodied agents (usually with a graphical front-end as opposed to a robotic body) that are capable of engaging in conversation with one another and with humans employing the same verbal and nonverbal means that humans do (such as gesture, facial expression, and so forth).

==Advantages==
Face-to-face communication allows communication protocols that give a much richer communication channel than other means of communicating. It enables pragmatic communication acts such as conversational [[turn-taking]], facial expression of [[emotion]]s, information structure and emphasis, visualisation and iconic gestures, and orientation in a three-dimensional environment.  This communication takes place through both verbal and non-verbal channels such as [[gaze]], [[gesture]], spoken intonation and body posture.

Research has found that users prefer a non-verbal visual indication of an embodied system's internal state to a verbal indication,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

One example result from a recent study indicates the power of a character when moderating search inquiries. When a character asked people to type search requests into a window, people used, on average, three more words in their requests (averaging about 7 words per inquiry) compared to identical requests made without a character. Character suggest that a conversational style is appropriate, resulting in higher liking for the
interaction on the part of the user, and better accuracy for the engine generating the required results.&lt;ref name="The Benefits of Interactive Online Characters"&gt;{{cite web

===Applications===
[[File:Sgt Star FOIA.png|thumb|upright|Sgt. Star, the U.S. Army's online assistant.]]

This rich style of communication that characterises human [[conversation]] makes conversational interaction with embodied [[conversational agents]] ideal for many non-traditional interaction tasks. A familiar application of graphically embodied agents is [[computer games]]; embodied agents are ideal for this setting because the richer communication style makes interacting with the agent enjoyable.  Embodied conversational agents have also been used in [[E-Learning|virtual training environments]], portable personal navigation guides, interactive fiction and [[storytelling]] systems, [[interactive online character]]s and automated presenters and commentators.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

[[File:Frank Francisco on April 5, 2012.jpg|thumb|Francisco with the New York Mets]]
'''Franklin Thomas Francisco''' (born September 11, 1979) is a [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] former professional [[baseball]] [[pitcher]]. He played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], [[Toronto Blue Jays]], [[New York Mets]] and [[Chicago White Sox]].

==Baseball career==
Francisco was originally signed as an amateur [[free agent]] by the [[Boston Red Sox]]. He was traded by the Red Sox to the [[Chicago White Sox]] on July 31, {{mlby|2002}}, along with Byeong Hak An, in exchange for reliever [[Bob Howry]]. On July 1, {{mlby|2003}}, the White Sox acquired [[Carl Everett]] from the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] in exchange for three players to be named later.

===Texas Rangers===
On July 25, 2003, Francisco, [[Josh Rupe]], and minor leaguer Anthony Webster were sent to the Rangers to complete the trade.

Francisco is best known for participating in a notable incident involving [[List of violent spectator incidents in sports|fan violence]]. On September 13, {{mlby|2004}}, he threw a folding chair into the crowd during a game against the [[Oakland Athletics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsline.com/mlb/story/7680194 Rangers' Francisco arrested for hitting fans with thrown chair] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217215057/http://www.sportsline.com/mlb/story/7680194 |date=2004-12-17 }}, [[CBS]]. Published September 14, 2004. Retrieved October 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The incident initially escalated when Rangers pitcher [[Doug Brocail]] confronted a fan. Francisco, who was in the dugout when all this was happening in the bullpen, ran from the dugout to the bullpen and threw a folding chair into the crowd, hitting a female fan in the face, breaking her nose and causing a cut which required stitches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=esterbook|first1=john|title=Chair-Throwing Pitcher Suspended|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/chair-throwing-pitcher-suspended/|website=cbs news|accessdate=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francisco was arrested and on June 30, 2005, he pleaded [[nolo contendere|no contest]] to the charges. He was sentenced to anger management classes and a work program. A civil suit brought by the woman who had been struck by the chair was settled on January 12, 2007. Terms of the settlement included an undisclosed payment and a public apology.

Francisco was suspended for the balance of the 2004 season, and missed the entire {{mlby|2005}} season after undergoing [[Tommy John surgery]]. Francisco rejoined the club on September 8, {{mlby|2006}}.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, T.R. [http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060908&amp;content_id=1652541&amp;vkey=news_tex&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=tex Notes: Francisco excited to be back], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. Published September 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a poor [[spring training]], Francisco started {{mlby|2007}} with the Rangers' Triple-A affiliate, the [[Oklahoma RedHawks]]. Following an injury to [[Éric Gagné]] in mid-April, Francisco was recalled to the majors. Francisco spent time in {{mlby|2008}} as the Rangers' [[Closer (baseball)|closer]] after an injury to regular closer [[C. J. Wilson (baseball)|C. J. Wilson]].

Francisco again began {{mlby|2009}} as the closer. He began with seven scoreless innings, allowing three hits and one walk, while garnering two saves.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, David. [http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090421&amp;content_id=4357152&amp;vkey=news_tex&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=tex Francisco solidifying role as closer], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. Published April 22, 2009. Retrieved April 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the end of April, Francisco maintained a 0.00 ERA with one walk and nine strikeouts, as well as six saves.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, T.R. [http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090428&amp;content_id=4467092&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=tex Francisco seals Rangers' scrappy win], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. Published April 29, 2009. Retrieved May 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He allowed his first run of 2009 on an upper-deck home run by Oakland Athletics' second baseman, [[Adam Kennedy]].

Francisco and the Rangers agreed to a one-year contract of $3.265 million, thereby avoiding arbitration for the 2010 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trsullivan.mlblogs.com/archives/2010/01/francisco_agrees_to_contract.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130201949/http://trsullivan.mlblogs.com/archives/2010/01/francisco_agrees_to_contract.html |archivedate=2010-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francisco lost the closer's role after blowing saves in his first two chances of the [[2010 Texas Rangers season|2010 baseball season]].

===Toronto Blue Jays===
On January 25, 2011, Francisco was traded to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] in exchange for catcher [[Mike Napoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110125&amp;content_id=16499196&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=tw_article_16499196|title=Napoli dealt to Rangers for Francisco|accessdate=2011-01-25|last=Stephens|first=Bailey|date=2011-01-25|publisher=[[MLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, Francisco agreed to terms with the Blue Jays on a one-year contract. After a stint on the disabled list, Francisco made his debut as a Blue Jay on April 20. On his first pitch as a Blue Jay, Francisco gave up a home run to the Yankees' [[Curtis Granderson]].

===New York Mets===
On December 6, 2011, Francisco agreed to a two-year contract worth $12 million with the [[New York Mets]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/22297882/33737135&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Francisco made his Mets debut on April 5, 2012 against the [[Atlanta Braves]], and was named the Mets' closer for the 2012 season.

On May 13, 2012, Francisco was ejected from a game against the [[Miami Marlins]] at [[Marlins Park]] after an outburst towards the home plate umpire.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/ny-mets-bullpen-implodes-8-4-loss-miami-marlins-giancarlo-stanton-hits-grand-slam-9th-inning-article-1.1077411&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, 2012, after a save against the [[New York Yankees]], Francisco was placed on the 15-day disabled list after feeling soreness in his oblique muscle. Before he began a rehabilitation assignment to come off the DL, Francisco aggravated his injury. On August 22, 2012, Francisco showed frustration by hurling a cooler in the dugout after giving up two runs in the top of the ninth inning. On December 18, 2012, Francisco had surgery to remove a bone spur from his right elbow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=[[The Newark Star Ledger]] December 19, 2012. pg. 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 30, 2013, Francisco was moved to the 60-day disabled list to make room on the 40-man roster for [[shortstop]] [[Omar Quintanilla]].

===Chicago White Sox===
On April 14, 2014, the White Sox signed Francisco to a minor league contract, and assigned him to the Triple-A [[Charlotte Knights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Padilla|first=Doug|title=White Sox pick up Frank Francisco|url=http://espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/story/_/id/10782631/chicago-white-sox-sign-right-hander-frank-francisco|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=April 14, 2014|date=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 17, when [[Frank De Los Santos]] was transferred from the [[Birmingham Barons]], Francisco was transferred to the Rookie [[Pioneer League (baseball)|Pioneer League]] team, the [[Great Falls Voyagers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knights|first=Charlotte|url=http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20140417&amp;content_id=72415714&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;vkey=news_t494&amp;sid=t494|accessdate=April 17, 2014|date=April 17, 2014 |title=Putnam to Chicago, De Los Santos to Charlotte}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 10, the White Sox purchased his contract from Charlotte and brought him up to the major leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theprovince.com/sports/White+bring+Frank+Francisco/9827324/story.html |title=White Sox bring up Frank Francisco |date=May 10, 2014 |accessdate=May 11, 2014 |work=The Province}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was designated for assignment on May 22, 2014.  He cleared waivers and was assigned outright to Charlotte on May 24. Francisco refused the assignment and became a free agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2014/05/frank-francisco-elects-free-agency.html |title=Frank Francisco Elects Free Agency |first=Zach |last=Links |date=May 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 25, 2014 |work=MLB Trade Rumors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Stint with Toronto===
Francisco signed a minor league deal in late June with Toronto but was released on July 14, 2014, after not appearing in a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2014/07/minor-moves-francisco-gimenez.html|title=Minor Moves: Francisco, Gimenez|last=Polishuk|first=Mark|work=mlbtraderumors.com|date=July 14, 2014|accessdate=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gantz'' tells the story of Kei Kurono and Masaru Kato, both of whom died in a train accident and become part of a semi-posthumous "game" in which they and several other recently deceased people are forced to hunt down and kill [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]s armed with a handful of futuristic items, equipment, and weaponry. Both the manga and anime are noted for their heavy violence and sexual content.

The ''Gantz'' [[anime]] adaptation, directed by [[Ichiro Itano]] and animated by [[Gonzo (studio)|Gonzo]], contains 26 episodes divided into two seasons. A series of two [[live action]] movies based on the manga were produced and released in January and April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Gantz, Maria-sama, Mori no Asagao Promos Streamed| url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-10-02/gantz-maria-sama-mori-no-asagao-promos-streamed | work=[[Anime News Network]] | date=October 2, 2010 | accessdate=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A CGI anime film, ''[[Gantz: O]]'', was released in 2016.

==Plot==
{{See also|List of Gantz characters}}
A pair of high school students, [[Kei Kurono]] and [[List_of_Gantz_characters#Masaru_Kato|Masaru Kato]], are hit by a subway train in an attempt to save the life of a drunk homeless man who had fallen onto the tracks.  Following their deaths, Kurono and Kato find themselves transported to the interior of an unfurnished [[Tokyo]] apartment, where they meet Joichiro Nishi, a Gantz veteran, and other clueless participants. The pair soon realizes that they are not allowed to leave the apartment.  At one end of the room there is a large black sphere known as "Gantz".

After some time in the room, the Gantz sphere opens up, revealing a bald naked man with a breathing mask and wires attached to his head, and various weapons for them to use. These include the custom fitting black suits which give them super-human strength, speed, stamina and damage resistance, a controller which acts as a radar and stealth unit, X-gun, X-Shotgun, Y-Gun. Later on the series the Gantz sword, Gantz Bike are made available as well as much more powerful weapons are awarded in the 100 point menu.

When the Gantz sphere opens, green text appears on its surface, informing those present that their "lives have ended and now belong to him".  A picture and brief information is shown of some of the [[List of Gantz characters#Aliens|Gantz' targets]]; Gantz orders them to go and kill them. Except for a single mission, all the targets are aliens living on Earth, which take on a wide variety of forms. During the mission, normal people cannot see the players or the aliens. Gantz transports them to the area of the mission, and they cannot leave or return until all the enemies have been killed, or the time limit has run out. If they survive a successful mission, each individual is awarded points for the aliens they have killed. Once a participant has scored 100 points, a "100 point menu" will appear. The menu offers three options:
*'''Option 1''': The participant can return to their normal life, never having to be summoned by Gantz again. As a price, their memories of Gantz and the missions will be erased.
*'''Option 2''': The participant obtains a unique and extremely-powerful weapon.
*'''Option 3''': The participant can revive someone who has died during a mission from Gantz' memory. This option appeared halfway through the series.

After a mission has been completed, points are tallied up, the participants are allowed to leave and do as they see fit until their next mission, with the exception of talking about Gantz which would lead to their heads exploding. During Kurono and Kato's third mission, all the participants including Kato are killed, however Kato kills the last boss giving Kurono a chance to survive. Kurono survives the third mission bleeding on the floor with his limbs cut apart. After the third mission Kurono starts to change inside adopting a hero, leader complex similar to Kato. As the series continues, Kurono participates with the objective of reviving his deceased friends with the 100 point reward option. A new team of Gantz players is assembled, which Kurono leads, as the most experienced veteran and one of the best fighters. In the Oni mission it is shown that with Kurono's "will to live" he becomes the most ferocious Gantz hunter in the team. Through his interactions with the other members of the team and his life or death battles, Kurono gradually grows into a responsible leader. After the Oni mission Kato is revived by Kurono, and soon after Kurono meets his demise against the vampires.  As the series goes on, the rules of the missions change; they can now be seen by regular people, the aliens they encounter are increasingly more powerful and dangerous, and they participate in a mission with another Gantz team from Osaka. Kato becomes the center of attention in the manga and his quest to revive Kurono. In a desperate attempt to revive his best friend, Kato fights the one hundred point alien Nurarihyon which obliterates both Osaka and Kurono's team. At the end of the mission, similar to the first time Kato died, he defeats arguably the strongest alien in the series and is laid bleeding on the floor. The series depicts both the missions and Kurono's regular life, as well as the daily lives of other Gantz players (to a lesser extent).

After several missions, an old participant named Nishi, who knows more than the others about how Gantz works, shows them a "catastrophe countdown" on the Gantz sphere which the other players were unaware of. The countdown reveals that there is one week left until some unknown "catastrophe." At the end of that week, a massive alien force invades the Earth and begins exterminating the human race, while Kurono and his companions try their best to make use of Gantz' advanced technology and weaponry in defense. At the end, Nishi and Kurono are depicted to be similar, both of whom were despised by their family and were sinister; however, unlike Nishi, Kurono has a reason to live. Nishi, in the chapter "The Great Escape", is left for dead by Kurono, vowing vengeance against him and crying out for Gantz and mother for help. It is hinted that Nishi died, but his death seems to be unclear. The Japanese also learn of the existence of Gantz teams all around the world. After a long battle, the humans manage to stop the alien invasion and soon after, it is revealed that it was another, highly advanced alien species that provided mankind with the means to defend itself against the invaders, for reasons they refuse to reveal and calls it a whim. In a desperate last effort, the leader of the alien forces, Eeva, challenges the whole human race, promising to exterminate every inhabitant by himself by crashing their mother ship, killing both races if Kurono does not come to their mother ship to fight him. Prior to this announcement Eeva completely dominates all Gantz teams in his vicinity by killing all the hunters, giving the human race a sense of their mortality. The world calls on Kurono, which is broadcast to the entire world, and, with a revived Kato's help, Kurono bets all his chance of winning and saving the human race on himself. Kurono manages to defeat Eeva, thus preventing the alien mothership from destroying Earth. The series ends with Kurono and Kato returning safely to Earth and being greeted as heroes.

==Production==
Hiroya Oku first thought of ''Gantz''{{'}}s story when he was in high school. He was inspired by the [[Jidaigeki]] program Hissatsu, and the [[Robert Sheckley]] novel [[Immortality, Inc.|Time Murderer]]. However, he did not decide to make ''Gantz'' until after writing the manga ''Zero One''; ''Zero One'' had a similar setting, but Oku ended the series, noting it was not very entertaining and that it was too expensive to develop.&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;{{cite book |author=Oku, Hiroya|title=Gantz Manual|year=2004 |publisher=Shueisha |pages=227–247|isbn=4-08-876735-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When creating the chapters for the manga, Oku starts with a thumbnail of the pages. He then creates 3D models of the characters and backgrounds on his computer. Once done, Oku prints the characters and backgrounds he made in 3D, adds tone and color to the pages, and finishes with sound effects and dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Oku, Hiroya|title=Gantz, Volume 1|year=2008 |publisher=Dark Horse Comics |pages=216–219|isbn=978-1-59307-949-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style was already used in ''Zero One'', but for that title, there was little work in hand drawing; Oku decided to add more hand drawing to give ''Gantz'' a more realistic tone as well as reduce the budget. However, he still notes that such a method is time-consuming and that he has to work quickly in order to finish the chapters on time.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;

Oku tries to incorporate realism into ''Gantz'' and adds that some of the events occurring in the story are based on his opinions regarding the world. During violent or erotic scenes, Oku makes sure to not make them very long to avoid reducing the series' realism. However, he has mentioned that he does not autocensor and that all the drawings he has ever illustrated have been published in the manga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edicionesglenat.es/asp/reportaje.asp?pid=541 |date=June 17, 2009 |title=Hiroya vs. Migoya |author=Migoya, Hernan |language=Spanish |publisher=[[Glénat (publisher)|Glénat]] |accessdate=August 5, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621224537/http://edicionesglenat.es/noticia.aspx?pId=541 |archivedate=21 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[plot twist]]s are meant to go against common events that happen in several manga such as the deaths of the major characters like Kei Kishimoto and Masaru Kato. Before the series started serialization, Oku told his assistants that with Kurono's exception, all the major characters from the series would die.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;

===Novel===
In July 2009, ''[[Weekly Young Jump]]'', the [[seinen]] manga magazine, began publishing a novel from the series named ''Gantz/Minus''. It is written by Masatoshi Kusakabe and illustrated by [[Yusuke Kozaki]]. The stories take place before the start of the manga, with the focus being on the characters Shion Izumi and Joichiro Nishi, who participate in Gantz's missions. On the cover of each ''Gantz/Minus'' issue, it describes itself as a "hyper solid action novel".

''Gantz/EXA'' is the second ''Gantz'' novel published. It was first serialized in Jump magazine, then printed as a complete collection in January 2011.

===Live action films===
{{main|Gantz (film)}}

DVD sales of ''Gantz'' have been particularly strong. According to [[Anime News Network]], Gantz volume three surpassed DVD sales of its predecessor, volume one, by a significant margin.

'''George Fleming Davis''' (March 23, 1911 – January 6, 1945) was a [[United States Navy]] officer and a recipient of America's highest military decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]], for actions during [[World War II]].

==Early life==
George F. Davis was born in [[Metro Manila|Manila]], [[Philippines]], on March 23, 1911.

==Navy career==
Davis was appointed to the [[United States Naval Academy]] from the [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]] in 1930 and graduated in May 1934. Ensign Davis' first duty station was the new heavy cruiser {{USS|Tuscaloosa|CA-37}}. While in that ship he served as an aircraft gunnery observer with her embarked aviation units. From 1939 to 1941 Lieutenant (Junior Grade) Davis served as an officer of the destroyer {{USS|Broome|DD-210}} and fast minesweeper {{USS|Hopkins|DD-249}}.

===Outbreak of World War II===
Following promotion to the rank of lieutenant in mid-1941 he was assigned to the battleship {{USS|Oklahoma|BB-37}}, which was sunk on December 7, 1941 when [[Japan]]'s surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] opened the [[Pacific War]].

In January 1942, Lieutenant Davis was transferred to the light cruiser {{USS|Honolulu|CL-48}}, in which he participated in operations in the [[Aleutian Islands]], the hard fighting over [[Guadalcanal]] and the [[Central Province (Solomon Islands)|Central Solomons]], and the campaign to recover [[Guam]]. He was promoted to lieutenant commander and commander while serving in ''Honolulu'', which he left in mid-1944. Following training in advanced surface warfare techniques, he was given command of the destroyer {{USS|Walke|DD-723}} in late November 1944. On 6 January 1945 his ship was covering minesweeping operations in advance of the Lingayen Gulf invasion when she was attacked by four Japanese [[Kamikaze]]s. Though ''Walke'' shot down two, the third plane struck the ship, enveloping her bridge area in burning gasoline. Though horribly burned, Commander Davis remained on his feet, conned the ship, directed damage control efforts and saw to the destruction of the fourth suicide plane. Only when ''Walke'''s survival was assured did he relinquish his post to be taken below, where he died a short time later.

For his conduct, Commander George F. Davis was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. His body was buried at sea.

==Medal of Honor citation==
Commander George F. Davis' official Medal of Honor citation is as follows:

[[File:Moh right.gif|left|70px]]

{{quote|For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as Commanding Officer of the U.S.S. ''Walke'' engaged in a detached mission in support of minesweeping operations to clear the waters for entry of our heavy surface and amphibious forces preparatory to the invasion of Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, Philippine Islands, 6 January 1945. Operating without gun support of other surface ships when four Japanese [[Kamikaze|suicide planes]] were detected flying low overland to attack simultaneously, Commander Davis boldly took his position in the exposed wings of the bridge and directed control to pick up the leading plane and open fire. Alert and fearless as the ''Walke'''s deadly fire sent the first target crashing into the water and caught the second as it passed close over the bridge to plunge into the sea off portside, he remained steadfast in the path of the third plane plunging swiftly to crash the after end of the bridge structure. Seriously wounded when the plane struck, drenched with gasoline and immediately enveloped in flames, he conned the ''Walke'' in the midst of the wreckage; he rallied his command to heroic efforts; he exhorted his officers and men to save the ship and, still on his feet, saw the barrage from his guns destroy the fourth suicide bomber. With the fires under control and the safety of the ship assured, he consented to be carried below. Succumbing several hours later, Commander Davis, by his example of valor and his unhesitating self-sacrifice, steeled the fighting spirit of his command into unyielding purpose in completing a vital mission. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.}}

==Legacy==
The destroyer {{USS|Davis|DD-937}}, 1957–1994, was named in his honor.

[[File:A Magician by Edward Kelly.jpg|right|thumb|[[John Dee]] and [[Edward Kelley]] invoking the spirit of a deceased person (engraving from the ''Astrology'' by [[Ebenezer Sibly]], 1806).]]
There is widespread belief in '''ghosts in English-speaking cultures''', where [[ghost]]s are manifestations of the spirits of the dead. The beliefs may date back to [[animism]] or [[ancestor worship]] before [[Christianization]]. The concept is a perennial theme in the literature and arts of English-speaking countries.

{{off topic|date=August 2016}}

The English word ''[[:wikt:ghost|ghost]]'' continues [[Old English]] ''[[:wikt:gast#Old English|gást]]'', from a hypothetical [[Common Germanic]] ''*gaistaz''. It is common to [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]], but lacking in [[North Germanic languages|North]] and [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]] (the equivalent word in [[Gothic language|Gothic]] is ''ahma'', [[Old Norse]] has ''andi'' m., ''önd'' f.).
The pre-Germanic form was ''{{PIE|*ghoisdo-s}}'', apparently from a root denoting "fury, anger" reflected in Old Norse ''geisa'' "to rage." The Germanic word is recorded as masculine only, but likely continues a neuter ''s''-stem. The original meaning of the Germanic word would thus have been an animating principle of the [[mind]], in particular capable of excitation and fury (compare ''[[óðr]]''). In [[Germanic paganism]], "[[Germanic Mercury]]," and the later [[Odin]], was at the same time the [[conductor of the dead]] and the "lord of fury" leading the [[Wild Hunt]].

Besides denoting the human spirit or soul, both of the living and the deceased, the Old English word is used as a synonym of Latin ''[[spirit]]us'' also in the meaning of "breath, blast" from the earliest attestations (9th century). It could also denote any good or evil spirit, i.e. angels and demons; the [[Anglo-Saxon]] gospel refers to the [[demonic possession]] of Matthew 12:43 as ''se unclæna gast''. Also from the Old English period, the word could denote the spirit of God, viz. the "[[Holy Ghost]]."{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}
The now prevailing sense of "the soul of a deceased person, spoken of as appearing in a visible form" only emerges in [[Middle English]] (14th century).
The modern noun does, however, retain a wider field of application, extending on one hand to soul, spirit," [[vital principle]], [[mind]] or [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]], the seat of feeling, thought and moral judgement; on the other hand used figuratively of any shadowy outline, fuzzy or unsubstantial image, in optics, photography and cinematography especially a flare, secondary image or spurious signal.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The synonym ''[[:wikt:spook|spook]]'' is a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] loanword, akin to [[Low German]] ''spôk'' (of uncertain etymology); it entered the English language via the [[American English|United States]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/spook?view=get Askoxford.com]. Retrieved 2009-05-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mencken, H. L. (1936, repr. 1980). The American Language: An Inquiry into the Development of English in the United States (4th edition). New York: Knopf, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Third New International Dictionary'', Merriam-Webster, ''spook''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World College Dictionary'' (4th edition), Wiley, ''spook''.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative words in modern usage include ''spectre'' (from Latin ''spectrum''), the Scottish ''wraith'' (of obscure origin), ''phantom'' (via French ultimately from Greek ''phantasma'', compare ''[[:wikt:fantasy|fantasy]]'') and ''apparition''. The term ''[[shade (mythology)|shade]]'' in [[classical mythology]] translates Greek σκιά,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=ou(=tos Liddell &amp; Scott entry]&lt;/ref&gt; or Latin ''umbra'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=umbra&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%253Atext%253A1999.04.0059 Lewis &amp; Short]&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the notion of spirits in the [[Greek underworld]]. "Haint" is a synonym for ghost used in regional English of the southern United States,&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of American Regional English'', Belknap Press, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and the "haint tale" is a common feature of southern oral and literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph M. Flora, Lucinda Hardwick MacKethan, Todd W. Taylor, ''The Companion to Southern Literature'', [[Louisiana State University Press]], 2001, pg. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[poltergeist]]'' is a German word, literally a "noisy ghost," for a spirit said to manifest itself by invisibly moving and influencing objects.&lt;ref name="Cohen1984"&gt;{{cite book

''[[:wikt:wraith|Wraith]]'' is a [[Scots language|Scots]] word for "ghost, spectre, apparition." It came to be used in Scottish Romanticist literature, and acquired the more general or figurative sense of "portent, [[omen]]."  In 18th- to 19th-century Scottish literature, it was also applied to aquatic spirits. The word has no commonly accepted etymology; [[OED]] notes "of obscure origin" only.
An association with the verb ''[[:wikt:writhe|writhe]]'' was the etymology favored by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenmanreview.com/book/book_shippey_tolkien.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021029060046/http://www.greenmanreview.com/book/book_shippey_tolkien.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 29, 2002 |title=Tom Shippey, J.R.R.

Bogey&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bogey Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[:wikt:bogie|bogy/bogie]]'' is a term for a ghost, and appears in Scottish poet [[John Mayne]]'s ''Hallowe'en'' in 1780.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Chambers [https://books.google.com/books?id=sdVkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=halloween+poem+(burns)&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YaX2TI2CH4uwhQfP_8GKCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=halloween%20poem%20(burns)&amp;f=false The life and works of Robert Burns, Volume 1] Lippincott, Grambo &amp; co., 1854&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ulsterscots/words/bogie Ulster Scots – Words and Phrases:"Bogie"] ''[[BBC]]'' Retrieved December 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Revenant (folklore)|''revenant'']] is a deceased person returning from the dead to haunt the living, either as a disembodied ghost or alternatively as an animated ("[[undead]]") corpse. Also related is the concept of a [[Fetch (folklore)|fetch]], the visible ghost or spirit of a person yet alive.

==Ghosts in English tradition==

===  Middle Ages===
[[File:Henry Fuseli rendering of Hamlet and his father's Ghost.JPG|thumb|250px|"[[Hamlet]] and his father's ghost" by [[Henry Fuseli]] (1780s drawing). The ghost is wearing stylized [[plate armour]] in 17th century style, including a [[morion (helmet)|morion]] type helmet and [[tassets]]. Depicting ghosts as wearing armour, to suggest a sense of antiquity, was common in [[Elizabethan theater]].]]

Medieval ghosts in England were more substantial than ghosts described in the [[Victorian era|Victorian age]], and there are accounts of ghosts being wrestled with and physically restrained until a priest could arrive to hear its confession. Some were less solid, and could move through walls. Often they were described as paler and sadder versions of the person they had been while alive, and dressed in tattered gray rags. The vast majority of reported sightings were male.&lt;ref&gt;Finucane, pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were some reported cases of ghostly armies, fighting battles at night in the forest, or in the remains of an [[Iron Age]] hillfort, as at [[Wandlebury]], near Cambridge, England. Living knights were sometimes challenged to single combat by phantom knights, which vanished when defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Finucane, pg. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tudor period===

[[File:Scrooges third visitor-John Leech,1843.jpg|right|thumb|19th century [[etching]] by [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]] of the [[Ghost of Christmas Present]] as depicted in [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'']]

One of the more recognizable ghosts in [[English literature]] is the [[King Hamlet|shade of Hamlet's murdered father]] in Shakespeare's ''The Tragical History of [[Hamlet, Prince of Denmark]].''  In ''Hamlet'', it is the ghost who demands that [[Prince Hamlet]] investigate his "murder most foul" and seek revenge upon his usurping uncle, [[King Claudius]]. In Shakespeare's ''[[Macbeth]]'', the murdered [[Banquo]] returns as a ghost to the dismay of the title character.

In [[English Renaissance theater]], ghosts were often depicted in the garb of the living and even in armor, as with the ghost of Hamlet's father. Armor, being out of date by the time of the Renaissance, gave the stage ghost a sense of antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Jones &amp; Peter Stallybrass, ''Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory'', Cambridge University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; But the sheeted ghost began to gain ground on stage in the 19th century because an armored ghost could not satisfactorily convey the requisite spookiness: it clanked and creaked, and had to be moved about by complicated pulley systems or elevators. These clanking ghosts being hoisted about the stage became objects of ridicule as they became clichéd stage elements. Ann Jones and Peter Stallybrass, in ''Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory'', point out, “In fact, it is as laughter increasingly threatens the Ghost that he starts to be staged not in armor but in some form of 'spirit drapery'.” An interesting observation by Jones and Stallybrass is that
{{quote|...at the historical point at which ghosts themselves become increasingly implausible, at least to an educated elite, to believe in them at all it seems to be necessary to assert their immateriality, their invisibility. ... The drapery of ghosts must now, indeed, be as spiritual as the ghosts themselves. This is a striking departure both from the ghosts of the Renaissance stage and from the Greek and Roman theatrical ghosts upon which that stage drew. The most prominent feature of Renaissance ghosts is precisely their gross materiality. They appear to us conspicuously clothed.}}

===Stuart and Georgian periods===
Ghosts figured prominently in traditional British ballads of the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly the “[[Border ballads]]” of the turbulent [[border country]] between England and Scotland. Ballads of this type include ''[[The Unquiet Grave]]'', ''[[The Wife of Usher's Well]]'', and ''[[Sweet William's Ghost]]'', which feature the recurring theme of returning dead lovers or children. In the ballad ''[[King Henry (song)|King Henry]]'', a particularly ravenous ghost devours the king's horse and hounds before forcing the king into bed. The king then awakens to find the ghost transformed into a beautiful woman.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Child Sargent &amp; George Lyman Kittredge, ''English and Scottish Popular Ballads edited from the Collection by Francis James Child'', Houghton Mifflin: New York, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key early appearances by ghosts in a gothic tale was ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' by Horace Walpole in 1764.&lt;ref name="Newman, pg. 135"&gt;Newman, pg. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Washington Irving]]'s short story ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1820), based on an earlier German folktale, features a [[Headless Horseman]]. It has been adapted for film and television many times, such as ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', a successful 1999 feature film.&lt;ref name="sleepyhollow"&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=sleepyhollow.htm Sleepy Hollow] at [[Box Office Mojo]]. Retrieved January 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victorian and Edwardian periods (1840 to 1920)===
[[File:Pyle pirates ghost.jpg|thumb|The ghost of a pirate, from [[Howard Pyle]]'s ''Book of Pirates'' (1903).]]
The "classic" ghost story arose during the Victorian period, and included authors such as [[M. R. James]], [[Sheridan Le Fanu]], [[Violet Hunt]], and [[Henry James]]. Classic ghost stories were influenced by the [[gothic fiction]] tradition, and contain elements of folklore and psychology. M. R. James summed up the essential elements of a ghost story as, “Malevolence and terror, the glare of evil faces, ‘the stony grin of unearthly malice', pursuing forms in darkness, and 'long-drawn, distant screams', are all in place, and so is a modicum of blood, shed with deliberation and carefully husbanded...”&lt;ref&gt;M. R. James. "Some Remarks on Ghost Stories," The Bookman, December 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous literary apparitions from this period are the ghosts of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', in which [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] is helped to see the error of his ways by the ghost of his former colleague [[Jacob Marley]], and the ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Present and Christmas Yet to Come.

[[Oscar Wilde]]'s comedy ''[[The Canterville Ghost]]'' has been adapted for film and television on several occasions. Henry James's ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'' has also appeared in a number of adaptations, notably the film ''[[The Innocents (1961 film)|The Innocents]]'' and [[Benjamin Britten]]'s opera ''[[The Turn of the Screw (opera)|The Turn of the Screw]]''.

[[Oscar Telgmann]]'s opera ''[[Leo, the Royal Cadet]]'' (1885) includes ''Judge's Song'' about a ghost at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;Leo, the Royal cadet, [https://archive.org/details/cihm_06551 Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, prior to and during the First World War, folklorists [[Olive Dame Campbell]] and [[Cecil Sharp]] collected ballads from the people of the Appalachian Mountains, which included ghostly themes such as ''[[The Wife of Usher's Well]]'', ''[[The Suffolk Miracle]]'', ''[[The Unquiet Grave]]'', and ''[[The Cruel Ship's Carpenter]]''. The theme of these ballads was often the return of a dead lover. These songs were variants of traditional Anglo-Scottish ballads handed down by generations of mountaineers descended from the people of the Anglo-Scottish border region.&lt;ref&gt;Olive Dame Campbell &amp; Cecil James Sharp, ''English Folk Songs From The Southern Appalachians'', G. Putnam's Sons: New York, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Child ballad]] ''[[Sweet William's Ghost]]'' (1868) recounts the story of a ghost returning to beg a woman to free him from his promise to marry her, as he obviously cannot being dead. Her refusal would mean his damnation. This reflects a popular British belief that the dead haunted their lovers if they took up with a new love without some formal release.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis James Child]], ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 2, p 227, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Unquiet Grave]]'' expresses a belief found in various locations over Europe:  ghosts can stem from the excessive grief of the living, whose mourning interferes with the dead's peaceful rest.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 2, p 234, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern views on ghosts==
{{off topic|date=August 2016}}
{{duplication|date=May 2013}}

===Modern Era (1920 to 1970)===

Professional parapsychologists and "ghosts hunters", such as [[Harry Price]], active in the 1920s and 1930s, and [[Peter Underwood (parapsychologist)|Peter Underwood]], active in the 1940s and 1950s, published accounts of their experiences with ostensibly true ghost stories such as Price's ''[[Borley Rectory|The Most Haunted House in England]]'', and Underwood's ''[[Borley Rectory|Ghosts of Borley]]''.

Children's benevolent ghost stories became popular, such as [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]], created in the 1930s and appearing in comics, [[animated cartoon]]s, and eventually a [[Casper (film)|1995 feature film]].

[[Noël Coward]]'s play ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'', later made into a [[Blithe Spirit (film)|film]], places a more humorous slant on the phenomenon of haunting of individuals and specific locations.

With the advent of motion pictures and television, [[List of ghost films|screen depictions of ghosts]] became common, and spanned a variety of genres; the works of Shakespeare, Dickens and Wilde have all been made into cinematic versions. Novel-length tales have been difficult to adapt to cinema, although that of ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]'' to ''[[The Haunting (1963 film)|The Haunting]]'' in 1963 is an exception.&lt;ref name="Newman, pg. 135"/&gt;

Sentimental depictions during this period were more popular in cinema than horror, and include the 1947 film ''[[The Ghost and Mrs. Muir]]'', which was later adapted to television with a successful 1968–70 [[The Ghost &amp; Mrs. Muir (TV series)|TV series]].&lt;ref name="Newman, pg. 135"&gt;Newman, pg. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Genuine [[psychological horror]] films from this period include 1944's ''[[The Uninvited (1944 film)|The Uninvited]]'', and 1945's ''[[Dead of Night]]''.

===Post-modern (1970–present)===
The 1970s saw English-language screen depictions of ghosts diverge into distinct genres of the romantic and horror. A common theme in the romantic genre from this period is the ghost as a benign guide or messenger, often with unfinished business, such as 1989's ''[[Field of Dreams]]'', the 1990 film ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', and the 1993 comedy ''[[Heart and Souls]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE3DE1339F93BA3575BC0A965958260|title=FILM; When It Comes to the Hereafter, Romance and Sentiment Rule|last=Chanko|first=Kenneth M.|date=August 8, 1993|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the horror genre, 1980's ''[[The Fog]]'', and the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' series of films from the 1980s and 1990s are notable examples of the trend for the merging of ghost stories with scenes of physical violence.&lt;ref name="Newman, pg. 135"/&gt;

Popularised in such films as the 1984 comedy ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', [[ghost hunting]] became a hobby for many who formed ghost hunting societies to explore reportedly haunted places. The ghost hunting theme has been featured in [[Reality television|reality television series]], such as ''[[Ghost Adventures]]'', ''[[Ghost Hunters (TV series)|Ghost Hunters]]'', ''[[Ghost Hunters International]]'', ''[[Ghost Lab]]'', ''[[Most Haunted]]'' and ''[[A Haunting]]''. It is also represented in children's television by such programs as ''[[The Ghost Hunter (TV series)|The Ghost Hunter]]'' and ''[[Ghost Trackers]]''. Ghost hunting also gave rise to multiple guidebooks to haunted locations, and ghost hunting "how-to" manuals.

The 1990s saw a return to classic "gothic" ghosts, whose dangers were more psychological than physical. Examples of films from this period include 1999's ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' and 2001's ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]]''.

According to the Gallup Poll News Service, belief in haunted houses, ghosts, communication with the dead, and witches had an especially steep increase over the 1990s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Newport F, Strausberg M. 2001. "Americans' belief in psychic and paranormal phenomena is up over last decade," Gallup Poll News Service. June 8&lt;!--year?--&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind04/c7/c7s2.htm#c7s2l5 "Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding-Public Knowledge About S&amp;T: Belief in Pseudoscience"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412093007/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind04/c7/c7s2.htm#c7s2l5 |date=April 12, 2010 }}, Chapter 7 of ''Science and Engineering Indicators 2004'', National Science Board, National Science Foundation; ''Science and Engineering Indicators 2006'', National Science Board, National Science Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 Gallup poll found that about 32 percent of Americans believe in ghosts.&lt;ref name=gallup&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/17275/onethird-americans-believe-dearly-may-departed.aspx |title=One-Third of Americans Believe Dearly May Not Have Departed |accessdate=2010-11-28 |last=Lyons |first=Linda |date=July 12, 2005 |publisher=[[The Gallup Organization#Gallup Poll|''Gallup Polls'']]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Godzilla'''|ゴジラ|Gojira|lead=yes}} ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|ɒ|d|ˈ|z|ɪ|l|ə}}; {{IPA-ja|ɡoꜜdʑiɾa||Ja-Godzilla.oga}}) is a monster originating from a series of [[Godzilla (franchise)|Japanese films of the same name]]. The character first appeared in [[Ishirō Honda]]'s 1954 film ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' and became a worldwide pop culture icon, appearing in various media, including 32 films produced by [[Toho]], [[Godzilla (franchise)#American productions|three Hollywood films]] and numerous [[Godzilla video games|video games]], novels, [[Godzilla (comics)|comic books]] and [[Godzilla (franchise)#Television|television shows]]. It is often dubbed "the King of the Monsters", a phrase first used in ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!]]'', the Americanized version of the original film.

Godzilla is depicted as an enormous, destructive, prehistoric sea monster awakened and empowered by [[Radioactive decay|nuclear radiation]]. With the [[nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and the ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru|Lucky Dragon 5]]'' incident still fresh in the Japanese consciousness, Godzilla was conceived as a metaphor for [[nuclear weapon]]s.{{sfn|Brothers|2009|p=}} As the film series expanded, some stories took on less serious undertones, portraying Godzilla as an [[antihero]], or a lesser threat who defends humanity. With the end of the [[Cold War]], several post-1984 ''Godzilla'' films shifted the character's portrayal to themes including Japan's forgetfulness over its imperial past,{{sfn|Barr|2016|p=83}} [[natural disaster]]s and the [[human condition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Robbie Collin |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10820543/Gareth-Edwards-interview-I-wanted-Godzilla-to-reflect-the-questions-raised-by-Fukushima.html |title=Gareth Edwards interview: 'I wanted Godzilla to reflect the questions raised by Fukushima' |publisher=The Telegraph |date=May 13, 2014 |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Godzilla has been featured alongside many supporting characters. It has faced human opponents such as the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|JSDF]], or other monsters, including [[King Ghidorah]], [[Gigan]] and [[Mechagodzilla]]. Godzilla sometimes has allies, such as [[Mothra]], [[Rodan]] and [[Anguirus]], and offspring, such as [[Minilla]] and [[Godzilla Junior]]. Godzilla has also fought characters from other franchises in [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] media, such as [[RKO Pictures]]/[[Universal Studios]] movie monster [[King Kong]] and [[American comic books]] publisher [[Marvel Comics]] characters [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]],&lt;ref&gt;''Godzilla'' #1 (vol. 1) (Marvel Comics, 1977)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Fantastic Four]]&lt;ref&gt;''Godzilla'' #20 (vol. 1) (Marvel Comics, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Godzilla'' #23 (vol. 1) (Marvel Comics, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

===Name===
{{nihongo|''Gojira''|ゴジラ}} is a [[portmanteau]] of the Japanese words: {{nihongo3|"[[gorilla]]"|ゴリラ|gorira}} and {{nihongo3|"[[whale]]"|{{ruby|鯨|クジラ}}|kujira}}, which is fitting because in one planning stage, Godzilla was described as "a cross between a gorilla and a whale",{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=22}} alluding to its size, power and aquatic origin. One popular story is that "Gojira" was actually the nickname of a corpulent stagehand at Toho Studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.godzillaondvd.com/mediapageloads/still05.html |title=Gojira Media |work=Godzila Gojimm |publisher=Toho Co., Ltd. |accessdate=November 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711103915/http://www.godzillaondvd.com/mediapageloads/still05.html |archivedate=July 11, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimi Honda, the widow of the director, dismissed this in a 1998 BBC documentary devoted to Godzilla, "The backstage boys at Toho loved to joke around with tall stories".{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=23}}

Godzilla's name was written in [[ateji]] as {{nihongo3||呉爾羅|Gojira}}, where the [[kanji]] are used for phonetic value and not for meaning.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The Japanese pronunciation of the name is {{IPA-ja|ɡoꜜdʑiɾa||Ja-Godzilla.oga}}; the Anglicized form is {{IPAc-en|ɡ|ɒ|d|ˈ|z|ɪ|l|ə}}, with the first syllable pronounced like the word "god" and the rest rhyming with "gorilla". In the [[Hepburn romanization]] system, Godzilla's name is rendered as "Gojira", whereas in the [[Kunrei romanization]] system it is rendered as "Gozira".{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

During the development of the American version of ''[[Godzilla Raids Again]]'' (1955), Godzilla's name was changed to "Gigantis", a move initiated by producer Paul Schreibman, who wanted to create a character distinct from Godzilla.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=74}}

In the original film, the fins were added for purely aesthetic purposes, in order to further differentiate Godzilla from any other living or extinct creature.

Godzilla's signature weapon is its "atomic breath," a nuclear blast that it generates inside of its body and unleashes from its jaws in the form of a blue or red radioactive heat ray.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;An Anatomical Guide to Monsters, Shoji Otomo, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Toho's special effects department has used various techniques to render the breath, from physical gas-powered flames&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=Interview with Haruo Nakajima|work=Godzilla - Criterion Collection 2012 Blu-ray/DVD Release|date=|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to hand-drawn or computer-generated fire. Godzilla is shown to possess immense physical strength and muscularity. Haruo Nakajima, the actor who played Godzilla in the original films, was a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in Judo and used his expertise to choreograph the battle sequences.&lt;ref&gt;''The Art of Suit Acting'' - Classic Media [[Godzilla Raids Again]] DVD featurette&lt;/ref&gt; Godzilla can breathe underwater,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and is described in the original film by the character Dr. Yamane as a [[transitional form]] between a marine and a terrestrial reptile.

===Roar===
Godzilla has a distinctive disyllabic roar (transcribed in several comics as ''Skreeeonk!''),&lt;ref&gt;Stradley, R., Adams, A., et al.

''Godzilla: Past, Present, Future'' (March 5, 1998), Dark Horse; Gph edition. {{ISBN|1569712786}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was created by composer [[Akira Ifukube]], who produced the sound by rubbing a pine-tar-resin-coated glove along the string of a [[Double bass|contrabass]] and then slowing down the playback.&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt; In the American version of ''Godzilla Raids Again'' (1955) entitled ''Gigantis the Fire Monster'', Godzilla's iconic roar was substituted with that of the monster [[Anguirus]].{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=74}} From ''[[The Return of Godzilla]]'' (1984) to ''[[Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah]]'' (1991), Godzilla was given a deeper and more threatening-sounding roar than in previous films, though this change was reverted from ''[[Godzilla vs. Mothra]]'' (1992) onwards.&lt;ref&gt;David Milner, [http://www.davmil.org/www.kaijuconversations.com/okawar.htm "Takao Okawara Interview I"], ''Kaiju Conversations'' (December 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2014 American film, sound editors Ethan Van der Ryn and Erik Aadahl refused to disclose the source of the sounds used for their Godzilla's roar.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web|last1=NPR Staff|title=What's In A Roar?

===Special effects details===
[[File:Godzilla Raids Again (1955) Behind the scenes.gif|thumb|Suit fitting on the set of ''[[Godzilla Raids Again]]'' (1955), with [[Haruo Nakajima]] portraying Godzilla on the left.]]
Godzilla's appearance has traditionally been portrayed in the films by [[Suitmation|an actor wearing a latex costume]], though the character has also been rendered in [[Animatronics|animatronic]], [[stop-motion]] and [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/22234-special-effects-in-godzilla-movies-history|title=The History of Godzilla Is the History of Special Effects|last=Failes|first=Ian|work=Inverse|date=October 14, 2016|accessdate=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nippon.com/en/views/b04001/|title=Godzilla’s Analog Mayhem and the Japanese Special Effects Tradition|last=Ryūsuke|first=Hikawa|work=Nippon.com|date=June 26, 2014|accessdate=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking inspiration from ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', special effects artist [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] had initially wanted Godzilla to be portrayed via stop-motion, but prohibitive deadlines and a lack of experienced animators in Japan at the time made suitmation more practical. The first suit consisted of a body cavity made of thin wires and bamboo wrapped in chicken wire for support and covered in fabric and cushions, which were then coated in latex. The first suit was held together by small hooks on the back, though subsequent Godzilla suits incorporated a zipper. Its weight was in excess of {{convert|100|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="godziszewski"/&gt; Prior to 1984, most Godzilla suits were made from scratch, thus resulting in slight design changes in each film appearance.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=36}} The most notable changes during the 1960s-70s were the reduction in Godzilla's number of toes and the removal of the character's external ears and prominent fangs, features which would later be reincorporated in the Godzilla designs from ''The Return of Godzilla'' (1984) onward.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=160}} The most consistent Godzilla design was maintained from ''[[Godzilla vs. Biollante]]'' (1989) to ''[[Godzilla vs. Destoroyah]]'' (1995), when the suit was given a cat-like face and double rows of teeth.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=254-257}} Several suit actors had difficulties in performing as Godzilla, due to the suits' weight, lack of ventilation and diminished visibility.&lt;ref name="godziszewski"/&gt; [[Kenpachiro Satsuma]] in particular, who portrayed Godzilla from 1984 to 1995, described how the Godzilla suits he wore were even heavier and hotter than their predecessors, because of the incorporation of animatronics.&lt;ref name="clements2010"&gt;Clements, J. (2010), ''Schoolgirl Milky Crisis: Adventures in the Anime and Manga Trade'', A-Net Digital LLC, pp. 117-118, {{ISBN|0984593748}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satsuma himself suffered numerous medical issues during his tenure, including [[oxygen deprivation]], near drowning, concussions, electric shocks and lacerations to the legs from the suits' steel wire reinforcements wearing through the rubber padding.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=258}} The ventilation problem was partially solved in the suit used in 1994's ''[[Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla]]'', which was the first to include an air duct, which allowed suit actors to last longer during performances.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=298}} In ''The Return of Godzilla'' (1984), some scenes made use of a 16-foot high robotic Godzilla (dubbed the "Cybot Godzilla") for use in close-up shots of the creature's head. The Cybot Godzilla consisted of a [[hydraulics|hydraulically-powered]] mechanical endoskeleton covered in [[Polyurethane|urethane]] skin containing 3,000 computer operated parts which permitted it to tilt its head and move its lips and arms.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=232}}

In ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1998), special effects artist [[Patrick Tatopoulos]] was instructed to redesign [[Zilla (TriStar Godzilla)|Godzilla]] as an incredibly fast runner.&lt;ref name=Rickett2006&gt;{{cite book |title=Designing Movie Creatures and Characters: Behind the Scenes With the Movie Masters |last=Rickitt |first=Richard |year=2006 |publisher=Focal Press |location= |isbn=0-240-80846-0 |pages=74–76 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, it was planned to use [[motion capture]] from a human to create the movements of the computer-generated Godzilla, but it ended up looking too much like a human in a suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Rickitt| first = Richard| title = Special Effects: The History and Technique| publisher = Billboard Books| year = 2000| isbn = 0-8230-7733-0| page = 174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tatopoulos subsequently reimagined the creature as a lean, [[digitigrade]] bipedal iguana that stood with its back and tail parallel to the ground, rendered via [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/jun98/godzilla/art1/pg1.htm |title=Godzilla Lives! - page 1 |publisher=Theasc.com |date= |accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several scenes had the monster portrayed by stuntmen in suits. The suits were similar to those used in the Toho films, with the actors' heads being located in the monster's neck region, and the facial movements controlled via animatronics. However, because of the creature's horizontal posture, the stuntmen had to wear metal leg extenders, which allowed them to stand {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on|sp=us}} off the ground with their feet bent forward. The film's special effects crew also built a {{frac|1|6}} scale animatronic Godzilla for close-up scenes, whose size outmatched that of [[Stan Winston]]'s ''T. rex'' in ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=337-339}} Kurt Carley performed the suitmation sequences for the adult Godzilla.&lt;ref name="kc"/&gt;

In ''[[Godzilla (2014 film)|Godzilla]]'' (2014), the character was portrayed entirely via CGI. Godzilla's design in the reboot was intended to stay true to that of the original series, though the film's special effects team strove to make the monster "more dynamic than a guy in a big rubber suit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/entertainment/dudek.html?tag=Rygiel |title=Oscar winner &amp; Kenosha native Jim Rygiel gets UWM award |first=Duane |last=Dudek |date=November 8, 2013 |accessdate=December 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213114405/http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/entertainment/dudek.html?tag=Rygiel |archivedate=December 13, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To create a CG version of Godzilla, the Moving Picture Company (MPC) studied various animals such as [[bear]]s, [[Komodo dragon]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[lion]]s and [[Wolf|gray wolves]] which helped the visual effects artists visualize Godzilla's body structure like that of its underlying bone, fat and muscle structure as well as the thickness and texture of its scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://m.hollywoodreporter.com/entry/view/id/887324 | title = Oscars: 'Interstellar,' 'Hobbit' Visual Effects Artists Reveal How They Did It | author = Carolyn Giardina | publisher = ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' | date = December 25, 2014 | accessdate = December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motion capture was also used for some of Godzilla's movements. [[T.J. Storm]] provided the performance capture for Godzilla by wearing sensors in front of a green screen.&lt;ref name="tj"/&gt;

In ''[[Shin Godzilla]]'', a majority of the character was portrayed via CGI, with [[Mansai Nomura]] portraying Godzilla through motion capture.&lt;ref name="shinmc"/&gt;

In 1967, the Keukdong Entertainment Company of South Korea, with production assistance from [[Toei Company]], produced ''[[Yongary, Monster from the Deep]]'', a reptilian monster who invades South Korea to consume oil. The film and character has often been branded as a knock-off of Godzilla.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=92}}&lt;ref name="yongary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aytiws.com/2010/06/yongary-monster-from-the-deep-1967/|title=Yongary, Monster from the Deep|last=Demoss|first=David|work=And You Thought It Was...Safe(?)|date=June 18, 2010|accessdate=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Godzilla has been considered a filmographic [[metaphor]] for the United States, as well as an allegory of [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] weapons in general. The earlier ''Godzilla'' films, especially the original, portrayed Godzilla as a frightening nuclear-spawned monster. Godzilla represented the fears that many Japanese held about the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and the possibility of recurrence.&lt;ref&gt;Rafferty, T., [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/popcult/handouts/metaphor/godzilla/godzilla.html The Monster That Morphed Into a Metaphor], ''NYTimes'' (May 2, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; As the series progressed, so did Godzilla, changing into a less destructive and more heroic character as the films became geared more towards children. Since then, the character has fallen somewhere in the middle, sometimes portrayed as a protector of the world from external threats and other times as a bringer of destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kevin-lankes/godzillas-secret-history_b_5192284.html|title=Godzilla’s Secret History|last=Lankes|first=Kevin|work=Huffington Post|date=June 22, 2014|accessdate=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/a-comprehensive-history-of-tohos-original-kaiju-and-atomic-allegory-godzilla|title=A Comprehensive History of Toho’s Original Kaiju (and Atomic Allegory) Godzilla|last=Goldstein|first=Rich|work=Daily Beast|date=May 18, 2014|accessdate=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Godzilla's fame and saurian appearance has influenced the scientific community. ''[[Gojirasaurus]]'' is a [[Nomen dubium|dubious genus]] of [[Coelophysidae|coelophysid]] dinosaur, named by [[paleontologist]] and admitted Godzilla fan [[Kenneth Carpenter]].&lt;ref name=carp97&gt;K. Carpenter, 1997, "A giant coelophysoid (Ceratosauria) theropod from the Upper Triassic of New Mexico, USA", ''Neues Jahrbuch für Geologie und Paläontologie, Abhandlungen'' '''205'''(#2): 189-208&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dakosaurus]]'' is an extinct [[Thalattosuchia|marine crocodile]] of the [[Jurassic|Jurassic Period]], which researchers informally [[nickname]]d "Godzilla".&lt;ref name="Gasparini''et al.'', 2006"&gt;Gasparini Z, Pol D, Spalletti LA. 2006.

Godzilla's ubiquity in pop-culture has led to the mistaken assumption that the character is in the [[public domain]], resulting in litigation by Toho to protect their corporate asset from becoming a [[generic trademark]]. In April 2008, [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] depicted a giant monster in a commercial for their Five Dollar Footlong sandwich promotion. Toho filed a lawsuit against Subway for using the character without permission, demanding $150,000 in compensation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2008/04/18/news/toho-sues-subway-over-unauthorized-godzilla-ads/ Toho sues Subway over unauthorized Godzilla ads], ''The Japan Times'' (April 18, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, Toho sued [[Honda]] for depicting a fire-breathing monster in a commercial for the [[Honda Odyssey]]. The monster was never mentioned by name, being seen briefly on a video screen inside the minivan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tokyohive.com/article/2011/02/toho-suing-honda-over-godzilla/ Toho suing Honda over Godzilla], ''TokyoHive'' (February 12, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] christened a vessel ''Gojira''. Its purpose is to target and harass Japanese whalers in defense of whales in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. The ''Gojira'' was renamed {{MV|Brigitte Bardot}} in May 2011 due to legal pressure from [[Toho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/2011/05/25/the-beast-transforms-into-a-beauty-as-godzilla-becomes-the-brigitte-bardot-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403063406/http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/2011/05/25/the-beast-transforms-into-a-beauty-as-godzilla-becomes-the-brigitte-bardot-13 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 3, 2012 |title=Sea Shepherd Conservation Society :: The Beast Transforms into a Beauty as Godzilla Becomes the Brigitte Bardot |publisher=Seashepherd.org |date=May 25, 2011 |accessdate=September 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gojira (band)|Gojira]] is the name of a French [[Technical Death Metal|death metal]] band, formerly known as Godzilla; legal problems forced the band to change their name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegauntlet.com/bio/1611/Gojira.html Gojira htm Biography and Band at the Gauntlet], ''The Gauntlet''&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Toho launched a lawsuit against [[Voltage Pictures]] over [[Colossal (film)|a planned picture]] starring [[Anne Hathaway]].

The main-belt asteroid [[101781 Gojira]], discovered by American astronomer [[Roy Tucker]] at the [[Goodricke-Pigott Observatory]] in 1999, was named in honor of the Japanese fantasy creature.&lt;ref name="Asteroid-Gojira" /&gt; The official naming citation was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 11 July 2018 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 110635}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

===Cultural ambassador===
To encourage tourism in April 2015 the central [[Shinjuku]] ward of Tokyo named Godzilla an official cultural ambassador. During an unveiling of a giant Godzilla bust at Toho headquarters, Shinjuku mayor [[Kenichi Yoshizumi]] stated "Godzilla is a character that is the pride of Japan." The mayor extended a residency certificate to an actor in a rubber suit representing Godzilla, but as the suit's hands were not designed for grasping it was accepted on Godzilla's behalf by a Toho executive. Reporters noted that Shinjuku ward has been flattened by Godzilla in three Toho movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Guardian|title=Godzilla recruited as tourism ambassador for Tokyo|date=April 9, 2015|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/09/godzilla-recruited-as-tourism-ambassador-for-tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Post|title=Godzilla is Tokyo's newest resident and ambassador|url=https://nypost.com/2015/04/09/godzilla-is-tokyos-newest-resident-and-ambassador/|date=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time it was notoriously known as the 'husband's stitch', the 'husband's knot', or the 'vaginal tuck', and doctors discreetly referred to this procedure as 'improving a woman's well-being'."&lt;ref name=Dobbeleir&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dobbeleir|first1=Julie M.

==Medical perspective==
While repair of the perineum may be medically necessary, an ''extra'' stitch is not, and may cause discomfort or pain.&lt;ref name="Vinopal"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vinopal |first1=Lauren |title=Who’s Afraid of the ‘Husband Stitch’?

Cupples was called upon to explain the 'Husband Stitch,' which he did as follows: He said that when he was stitching up a ruptured perineum, of a married lady, the husband was an anxious and interested observer, and when he had taken all the stitches necessary, the husband peeped over his shoulders and said, 'Dr., can't you take another stitch?' and he did, and called it the 'Husband Stitch'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transactions of the Texas State Medical Association|volume=Seventeenth Annual Session|year=21–23 April 1885|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mZ0RAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22husband%20stitch%22&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q=%22husband%20stitch%22&amp;f=false|publisher=Texas State Medical Association|location=Houston, Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} There is also a reference to it in ''What Women Want to Know'' (1958), a book co-written by an American gynaecologist.{{efn|"Such a problem confronted a colleague of mine, whose pregnant patient asked him before delivery if he would please put in what she referred to as 'her husband's stitch'. It turned out that she wanted him to tighten up her vagina somewhat, so that it would revert to its original state. The doctor took her at her word and, following delivery of her fourth baby, performed a [[Perineoplasty|perineorrhaphy]]. This operation has the effect of tightening the sphincter and rendering the introitus somewhat smaller.{{pb}}"Unhappily, the patient and her husband decided that the 'stitch' had been made too tight, was unsatisfactory, and sued the doctor for malpractice, asking something in the neighborhood of a hundred thousand dollars. The doctor won his case, though not without difficulty, and it was a genuine legal battle despite the humorous implications of the issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Imerman|first1=Harold M.|last2=Dewey|first2=Thomas Blanchard|title=What Women Want to Know: A Noted Gynecologist's Guide to the Personal Problems of Women's Health|date=1958|publisher=Crown|location=New York|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It appears that no studies exist to determine whether the procedure occurs and how many women have been affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=Carrie|title=The Husband Stitch Isn’t Just a Horrifying Childbirth Myth|url=https://www.healthline.com/health-news/husband-stitch-is-not-just-myth#3|work=Healthline|date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some medical practitioners view reports about the procedure as an [[urban legend]]. One writer suggests that it might be a joke made by men to relieve tension after their partners have given birth.&lt;ref name="Vinopal"/&gt;

==Popular culture==
A [[short story]] by [[Carmen Maria Machado]], "The Husband Stitch", first published in 2014 by ''[[Granta]]'', describes a woman undergoing the procedure.&lt;ref name="Machado"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Machado |first1=Carmen Maria |authorlink1=Carmen Maria Machado |title=The Husband Stitch |url=https://granta.com/the-husband-stitch/ |website=[[Granta]]|date=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Japanese seaplane tender Chiyoda 1938.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese seaplane tender ''Chiyoda'' in 1938]]
{{nihongo|'''''Chiyoda'''''|千代田|"Thousandth-Generation Field"}} was a [[light aircraft carrier]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during [[World War II]]. Originally constructed as the second vessel of the {{sclass-|Chitose|aircraft carrier|0}} [[seaplane tender]]s in 1934, she continued to operate in that capacity during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the early stages of the [[Pacific War]] until her conversion into a light aircraft carrier after the [[Battle of Midway]]. She was sunk during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] by a combination of naval bombers, cruiser shellfire and destroyer-launched torpedoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jentsura  | first = Hansgeorg  | year = 1976 | title = Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1869-1945  | publisher = Naval Institute Press  | isbn = 0-87021-893-X }} page 57&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The ''Chitose''-class seaplane tenders were procured by the Imperial Japanese Navy under the [[2nd Naval Armaments Supplement Programme]] of 1934 as purpose-built ships, whereas their predecessors were all conversions of merchant or auxiliary ship designs. During the 1930s, the Imperial Japanese Navy made increasing use of [[naval aviation]] as scouts for its cruiser and destroyer squadrons. Due to restrictions imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and [[London Naval Treaty]], the number of aircraft carriers was strictly regulated; however, there was no limitation as to seaplane tenders.

==Design==
''Chiyoda'' was designed from the start on the premise that the design from the waterline upwards could be modified to suit a variety of missions. The hull and engine design was based on a high speed oiler, with a maximum speed of {{convert|20|kn|lk=in}}, but the ship was completed as a seaplane tender, with four aircraft [[Aircraft catapult#Interwar and World War II|catapult]]s for launching seaplanes, and cranes for recovering landed aircraft on her aft deck.
As designed, ''Chiyoda'' carried a complement of [[Kawanishi E7K]] Type 94 "Alf" and [[Nakajima E8N]] Type 95 "Dave" [[floatplane]]s. Her armament consisted of four [[12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval gun]]s and twelve [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|Type 96 25 mm AA guns]].

Propulsion was of four boilers, which operated two geared [[steam turbine]]s providing {{convert|56,800|hp|kW|lk=in}} and two propellers. With two additional diesel engines operating ''Chiyoda'' could attain {{convert|28.5|kn}}.

With the loss of four large aircraft carriers at the [[Battle of Midway]], the Imperial Japanese Navy rushed a project to convert the ''Chitose''-class into light aircraft carriers as partial compensation. A wooden {{convert|180|x|23|m|ft}} flight deck was installed, with two elevators. The bridge was moved to the front end of the new hangar deck, and the boiler exhaust gases was discharged through pipes to the starboard side below the flight deck, and the diesel engines had smaller, separate smokestacks also on the starboard side. As converted, the ship could carry 30 aircraft.

==Operational history==

===As a seaplane tender===
''Chiyoda'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 14 December 1936 and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 19 November 1937 at [[Kure Naval Arsenal]] and was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 15 December 1938. On completion, she was assigned directly to the [[Combined Fleet]] under the command of Captain [[Tomeo Kaku]] and was dispatched to the front lines in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] paired with the seaplane tender {{ship|Japanese seaplane tender|Kamoi||2}}. She remained engaged in combat operations in China until May 1940.&lt;ref name="Combined"&gt;[http://www.combinedfleet.com/Chiyoda_t.htm IJN Seaplane/Midget Submarine Carrier CHIYODA: Tabular Record of Movement]&lt;/ref&gt;
On returning to Kure Naval Arsenal on 23 May 1940, ''Chiyoda'' underwent her first major modification, with her aircraft capacity reduced from 24 to 12 aircraft, and the space used to store 12 [[Type A Kō-hyōteki-class submarine]]s. This rebuild was completed on 23 June, and ''Chiyoda'' was assigned to the [[4th Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|4th Fleet]] based at [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] in September. Captain [[Kaku Harada]] was appointed captain in August. ''Chiyoda'' returned to participate in a [[naval review]] held on 11 October in [[Yokohama]] to celebrate the 2600th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Empire. Afterwards, she was reassigned back to the Combined Fleet and began training operations on the use of her midget submarines through September, developing tactics for attacking other vessels (using ''Chitose'' as a target) and penetrating enemy naval bases. At the time of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], ''Chiyoda'' was docked at Kure and continued training operations to 20 March 1942, when she was assigned to Vice Admiral [[Teruhisa Komatsu]]’s [[6th Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|6th Fleet]] together with the submarine tender {{ship|Japanese seaplane tender|Nisshin||2}} and ''[[Aikoku Maru]]''.&lt;ref name="Combined"/&gt;

During the [[Battle of Midway]], ''Chiyoda'' was part of Main Body of the Japanese fleet. For this operation, she carried eight Type A Kō-hyōteki-class submarines, which were intended to be stationed at [[Kure Atoll]], which was to be seized as a seaplane base for operations against [[Midway Atoll]]. The operation was cancelled on the loss of the Japanese aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway, and ''Chiyoda'' returned to [[Hashirajima]] with her submarines on 14 June without having seen combat.&lt;ref name="Combined"/&gt;

During June, ''Chiyoda'' was refit for operations in northern waters, and departed Yokosuka Naval District on 28 June, arriving at Japanese-occupied [[Kiska]] in the [[Aleutian islands]] on 5 July with a construction team to build a seaplane base. She was attacked by aircraft from the [[United States Army Air Force]]{{'s}} [[11th Air Force]] on the same day, without damage and arrived back at Hashirajima on 19 July.&lt;ref name="Combined"/&gt;

On 25 September, ''Chiyoda'' was reassigned to the [[Guadalcanal]] area in the [[Solomon Islands]] and delivered eight Type A Kō-hyōteki-class submarines to [[Shortland Island]] on 14 October. She was attacked by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] aircraft on 29 October and 31 October, but suffered no damage, and on 6 November, after her return to Truk, she was attacked by the submarine {{USS|Grayling|SS-209|6}}, which fired three torpedoes at ''Chiyoda,'' all of which missed. ''Chiyoda'' returned to Yokosuka on 8 January 1943 and was converted from a seaplane tender to a light aircraft carrier at the [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]] beginning 16 January, with the work completed on 21 December 1943.&lt;ref name="Combined"/&gt;

===Conversion===
After conversion, ''Chiyoda'' was assigned to the [[Third Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|3rd Fleet]] and departed Yokosuka for [[Saipan]], [[Guam]] and [[Palau]], [[Balikpapan]] and [[Davao City|Davao]] on 1 March as part of emergency reinforcements following the fall of [[Kwajalein]] to the US, returning to Kure on 10 April. On 11 May, she departed for [[Tawitawi]] with Air Group 653 as part of Operation A-Go, for the defense of the [[Mariana Islands]]. She was accompanied by the carriers ''Chitose'', {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuihō||2}}, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Jun'yō||2}}, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiyō||2}},  {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Ryūhō||2}} and by the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}}. During the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] on 19 June, she was part of the Van Force with carriers ''Chitose'', ''Zuihō'', battleships {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}}, ''Musashi'', {{ship|Japanese battleship|Kongō||2}}, {{ship|Japanese battleship|Haruna||2}} and cruisers {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Atago||2}}, {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Takao|1930|2}}, {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Maya||2}} and {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Chōkai||2}}. She was hit by a bomb on 20 June on her aft flight deck, which killed 20 crewmen, wounded 30 more and destroyed two aircraft. She was withdrawn for repairs on 22 June. She remained at Kure through the end of July.&lt;ref name="Movements"&gt;[http://www.combinedfleet.com/Chiyoda.htm IJN Chiyoda: Tabular Record of Movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final battle===
[[File:Japanese light carrier Chiyoda sinks during the Battle of Cape Engaño, 25 October 1944.jpg|thumb|''Chiyoda'' burning, under fire from U.S. cruisers, 25 October 1944.]]
On 20 October 1944 ''Chiyoda'' departed Oita as part of Admiral [[Jisaburō Ozawa]]’s Decoy Force intended to lure the American fleet away from the landing beaches in the Philippines in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]. This force included ''Zuikaku'', ''Zuihō'', ''Chitose'' and ''Chiyoda'', all divested of aircraft and accompanied by converted hybrid battleship-carriers {{ship|Japanese battleship|Hyūga||2}} and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Ise||2}} and cruisers {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Oyodo||2}}, {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Tama||2}}, {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Isuzu||2}}. On 25 October, both ''Chiyoda'' and ''Chitose'' were sunk by a combination of naval bombers, cruiser shellfire and destroyer-launched torpedoes during the [[Battle of Cape Engano]].&lt;ref name="Movements"/&gt;

''Chiyoda'' was crippled by four bombs dropped by aircraft from the carriers {{USS|Franklin|CV-13|6}} and {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|6}} that left her dead in the water. The converted hybrid battleship-carrier ''Hyūga'' attempted to take her in tow, but was prevented by a third attack. The cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Isuzu||2}} was ordered to remove ''Chiyoda''{{'}}s crew, but this was also frustrated due to continuing danger from air and surface attack. After three attempts, ''Isuzu'' was forced to retreat with U.S. surface forces in sight and ''Chiyoda'' under naval gunfire.&lt;ref name="Movements"/&gt; She was finished off by gunfire from four cruisers {{USS|Santa Fe|CL-60|6}}, {{USS|Mobile|CL-63|2}}, {{USS|Wichita|CA-45|2}} and {{USS|New Orleans|CA-32|2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://usssantafe.net/docs/the_leyte_operation.htm |title=The Leyte Operation |access-date=2013-01-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724154409/http://usssantafe.net/Docs/the_leyte_operation.htm |archive-date=2012-07-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with nine destroyers, all under the command of [[Rear Admiral]] Laurence DuBose.&lt;ref name="Movements"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morison, Samuel Eliot (2007).

'''I-41''' was a Japanese [[Type B2 submarine#Type-B Mod.1 .28I-40 class.29|B2 type submarine]].  She was completed at [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure Navy Yard]] on 18 September 1943, whereupon she entered into service with the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] Yokosuka Naval District, SubRon 11, and sailed to Yokosuka for final trials under the command of Lt. Commander Tamori Yoshimatsu.  This was completed by 15 December 1943 and command was transferred to Lt. Commander Itakura Mitsuma.  ''I-41'' was reassigned to the Sixth Fleet in SubRon 1's Sub Division 15.

==World War II service==

===Supply submarine===
On 29 December 1943 the new submarine departed Tokosuka for [[Truk Lagoon|Truk]]. Arriving at Truk on New Years Day 1944, her deck gun and all of her torpedoes were taken on shore to prepare the sub for a supply mission. Nine days later ''I-41'' was designated as the flagship of SubDiv 15. On 15 January 1943 ''I-41'' sailed from Truk for [[Rabaul]]. While en route, SubRon1 was disbanded and the submarine was attached directly to the Sixth Fleet Headquarters. She docked at Rabaul on 19 January 1944, loaded supplies, and left four days later on her first supply run to Sarmi, [[New Guinea]]. ''I-41'' arrived at Sarmi on 25 January and unloaded, departing immediately to return to Rabaul. She arrived there on 27 January. Heading to sea again on 31 January the submarine made for [[Bougainville Island]]. After evading minefields and enemy patrols she arrived at [[Buin, Papua New Guinea|Buin]], unloaded on 4 February, and returned to Rabaul on 7 February. Between 12 February and 24 February she made another supply run to Buin, tying up at Rabaul once again before setting out for Truk on 27 February carrying 98 naval pilots and staff officers as passengers, including the commanding officer of the 501st Naval Air Group. She arrived safely at Truk on 2 March and discharged her passengers. She sailed on 7 March toward Rabaul, but was recalled to Truk on the 9th.

After a week's respite ''I-41'' sailed for Rabaul once again on 15 March. While en route, on March 19, ''I-41'' was running surfaced north of Rabaul when she was attacked by two torpedoes from an unknown enemy submarine. The lookouts saw the "fish" in time and Lt. Commander Itakura was able to evade the attack by turning sharply to port; the nearest torpedo passed 55 yards ahead of the submarine. Upon arrival at Rabaul the next day she was reassigned to SubRon 7.

[[FRUMEL|USN Fleet Radio Unit Melbourne (FRUMEL)]] intercepted and decoded a message the same day indicating that ''I-41'' was expected to leave Rabaul at 0300 on 21st, pass through 3-08S, 149-21E at 0200 on 23rd, and arrive Truk at 1330 on 25th. This was accurate information. The sub left at the appointed time transporting 98 passengers including the CO of SubRon 7, Rear Admiral Owada Noboru, his staff, and a number of airmen. While she was en route FRUMEL intercepted another message reading, "Expect submarine I-41 to arrive South Channel about 0900 tomorrow 25th." This was also accurate. Despite this, the submarine was not attacked and arrived safely at Truk on 25 March. She was escorted in through the south channel by ''[[Kinpo Maru No. 1]]''.

===Operation Tatsumaki===
In April 1944, ''I-41'' was selected as one of several submarines to participate in an amphibious assault on [[Majuro]] in the [[Marshall Islands]]. She was ordered to train with ''[[Japanese Submarine I-36|I-36]]'', ''[[Japanese Submarine I-38|I-38]]'', ''[[Japanese Submarine I-44|I-44]]'', and ''[[Japanese Submarine I-53|I-53]]'' for this attack, which called for the submarines to carry amphibious tanks armed with torpedoes from Kure to Majuro. Once there they would be put ashore, make their way overland, and enter the water again to attack ships in harbor there. The plan was cancelled before it could be realized, however.

===Return to supply duty===
With the cancellation of Operation Tatsumaki, ''I-41'' returned to her previous duties as a supply sub. She left Truk on 1 April 1944, making her third run to Buin with 50 tons of food. She arrived on 7 April, unloaded, embarked 73 passengers, and returned to Truk. ''I-41'' docked at Truk on 13 April. Her deck gun was remounted during her layover in Truk Lagoon. For his successful supply runs, Lt. Commander Itakura is given a gift of cigarettes from Vice Admiral Takagi Takeo, the CINC of the Sixth Fleet. On 19 April the sub departed Truk for Yokosuka, where she arrived on the 25th. She was then transferred to Kure.

===First War patrol===
After needed upkeep, ''I-41'' departed Kure to patrol between the [[Admiralty Islands]] and [[Wewak]], [[New Guinea]], on 15 May 1944. No targets were sighted, but while still on patrol 13 June word was received by Admiral Toyoda Soemu, CINC, Combined Fleet, that the American anchorage at Marujo was empty. The admiral ordered Vice Admiral Takagi to redeploy his boats, ''I-41'' among them, toward the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]]. ''I-41'' received the order the next day, being dispatched to a region South of [[Guam]] at best possible speed.

On 15 June 1944 the American invasion of [[Saipan]] started. As a result, communication with Vice Admiral Takagi Takeo and Sixth Fleet Command was disrupted and command of sixth fleet submarines passed to Rear Admiral Owada Noboru of SubRon 7 at Truk. In his final message sent from the island, Takagi announced he and his staff were planning to join a [[banzai charge]] imminently. He was promoted to Admiral, posthumously. Following this, ''I-41'' was redirected to a patrol area southeast of the Marianas in the company of the submarines  ''[[Japanese Submarine RO-113|RO-113]]'', ''[[Japanese Submarine RO-114|RO-114]]'', ''[[Japanese Submarine RO-115|RO-115]]'', and ''[[Japanese Submarine RO-116|RO-116]]''.

On 22 June 1944, ''I-41'' was detached from her group and ordered to Guam to evacuate naval aviators stranded there. She arrived two days later and surveyed the island from periscope depth in search of a suitable embarkation point. After sunset she surfaced 1,100 yards offshore and contacted units on land. Two barges managed to transfer a total of 106 pilots (mostly from the 705th Naval Air Group) before an approaching patrol bomber (a [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]]) forced the submarine to dive. Further embarkation was aborted. The submarine and her passengers returned to [[Ōita, Ōita|Ōita]] on [[Kyushu]], landing there on 30 June 1944.

Beginning 1 July, the submarine arrived at Kure and commenced battle training. On 5 August command of the submarine was transferred to Lt. Commander Kondo Fumitake, the former CO of ''[[Japanese Submarine RO-112|RO-112]]''; training continued until 9 October, when ''I-41'' was transferred to the Otsujima [[Kaiten]] base in the [[Seto Inland Sea|Inland Sea]] to train human torpedo crews, returning to Kure thereafter.

===Second War patrol===
On 13 October Operation Sho-I-Go (Defense of the [[Philippines]]) was ordered. Six days later ''I-41'' departed Kure to patrol east of the Philippines. The next day an American fleet of 738 ships landed on [[Leyte]], precipitating an order to ''I-41'' to proceed at flank speed to a patrol area east of Leyte. There she operated in tandem with ''[[Japanese Submarine I-38|I-38]]''. ''I-41'' reported sinking an American transport on 27 October, but there is no corroborating loss on the American side.

On 30 October the submarine reported sighting a task force with three [[aircraft carrier]]s 220 miles east by northeast of [[Suluan|Suluan Island]] but was not able to engage. A few days later, on 3 November, ''I-41'''s looksouts sighted what they believed was an aircraft carrier near the [[San Bernardino Strait]], in the company of other ships. It is possible this was [[USS Lexington (CV-16)|USS Lexington]], which was in the area at the time. At 2330 hours Lt. Commander Kondo set up his shot and fired a salvo of torprdoes at the target. One of these hit the [[light cruiser]] [[USS Reno (CL-96)|USS Reno]] in the port side. Kondo reported sinking a carrier, but in fact no hits were scored on any carrier and ''Reno'' did not sink, later being towed to [[Ulithi]] by the tug [[USS Zuni (ATF-95)|USS Zuni]]. A [[Yokosuka P1Y|Yokosuka P1Y 'Frances']] attack bomber "confirmed" Lt. Commander Kondo's claim and he was awarded a special citation from [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]].

On 12 November 1944 Lt. Commander Kondo reported attacking another task force. This communication was the last word received from ''I-41''.

===Loss===
East of [[Samar]] on 18 November 1944 during an ASW patrol in the Philippine Sea, Task Group 30.7's ''[[USS Anzio (CVE-57)|USS Anzio]]'' was alerted to the presence of a Japanese submarine in her operating area by an "Ultra" signals-intelligence message. ''Anzio'''s aircraft conducted an ASW sweep. One of the aircraft reported a radar contact on a submarine on the surface. After a 14-hour hunt, ''[[USS Lawrence C. Taylor (DE-415)|USS Lawrence C.

'''John Ercel Fryer''', [[M.D.]] (November 7, 1937&lt;ref name=hsp /&gt; – February 21, 2003) was an [[United States|American]] [[psychiatrist]] and [[gay rights]] activist best known for his [[Anonymity|anonymous]] speech at the 1972 [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) annual conference where he appeared in disguise and under the name '''Dr. Henry Anonymous'''. This event has been cited as a key factor in the decision to de-list [[homosexuality]] as a [[mental illness]] from the APA's ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''. The APA's "John E. Fryer, M.D., Award" is named in his honor.&lt;ref name="moran2006"&gt;Moran, Mark (November 3, 2006) [https://web.archive.org/web/20070708160454/http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/41/21/17 "Activists Forced Psychiatrists To Look Behind Closet Door"] ''Psychiatric News''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Fryer was born in [[Winchester, Kentucky]] to Ercel Ray Fryer and Katherine Zempter Fryer.&lt;ref name=hsp /&gt;&lt;ref name=find /&gt; He was in the second grade of his elementary school at 5 years old,&lt;ref name=episode&gt;Scasta, David L. (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=k_aXd1lW3FsC&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;ots=CpgEz-5Jtw&amp;dq=%22john%20e.%20fryer%22%20oxymoron&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q=%22john%20e.%20fryer%22%20oxymoron&amp;f=false "John E.

(September 1, 2006) [http://www.behavioral.net/article/honoring-john-fryers-legacy "Honoring John Fryer's Legacy"] ''Behavioral Healthcare''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=episode /&gt; He began his psychiatric residency at the [[Menninger Foundation]] in [[Topeka, Kansas]], but left &amp;ndash; on the advice of a psychoanalyist &amp;ndash; due to the depression caused by having to hide his homosexuality; he later described Menninger as having "a lot of homophobia."&lt;ref name=episode /&gt;  He moved to [[Philadelphia]], where he held a residency at the [[University of Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref name=hsp2 /&gt; but was forced to leave because of his homosexuality; he completed his residency in 1967 at [[Norristown State Hospital]].&lt;ref name=endow&gt;Staff (December 18, 2013) [http://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.pn.2013.12b15 "American Psychiatric Foundation Helps Endow Fryer Award"] ''Psychiatric News''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=episode /&gt;

Around the mid-1960s, Fryer began to receive referrals from Alfred A. Gross,&lt;ref name=gross&gt;[http://www.lgbtran.org/Profile.aspx?ID=204 "Profile: Dr Alfred A. Gross"] ''Religious Archives Network''&lt;/ref&gt; the Executive Secretary of the George W. Henry Foundation &amp;ndash; co-founded by Gross and Henry in 1948&lt;ref name=gross /&gt; to help those "who by reason of sexual deviation are in trouble with themselves, the law or society"&lt;ref name=hsp2 /&gt; &amp;ndash; to treat homosexual men who had run afoul of the law, and to testify on their behalf in court cases.&lt;ref name=gross /&gt;

Fryer joined the medical faculty of Philadelphia's [[Temple University]] in 1967. As of January 1969, he was an instructor in psychiatry there.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, Marion (producer) (January 26, 1969) [https://archive.org/details/MARIONSTOKESINPUT18 "Input - #18 - ''The Anatomy of Life'' - Part 5 - 'Puppet or Person?'" (video)] WCAU-TV Philadelphia&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in the community health center in [[North Philadelphia]], and became active in the Health Care and Human Values Task Force, using a $5,000 grant to that organization to create a group he called "Ars Moriendi" to deal with matter concerning the professional reaction to death and dying.  This later became the International Work Group on Death, Dying, and Bereavement.&lt;ref name=episode /&gt;

==1972 speech==

At a time when homosexuality was still listed as a mental illness, a sociopathic personality disturbance according to second edition of the APA's ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-II), published in 1968,&lt;ref name=beast /&gt; Fryer was the first gay American psychiatrist to speak publicly about his sexuality.  In 1970, a protest at an APA event in San Francisco on [[aversion therapy]], the message of which, according to lesbian activist [[Barbara Gittings]], was "Stop talking about us and starting talking with us",&lt;ref name=beast /&gt; earned gay and lesbian activists a voice in the association.  The next year at the 1971 convention in Washington, Gittings organized a panel discussion on "Lifestyles of Non-patient Homosexuals",&lt;ref name=pgn /&gt; which was chaired by gay [[Harvard University]] astronomer Dr. [[Franklin E. Kameny]], who had previously lost a job with the federal government due to his homosexuality.

In a planned protest, members of the APA's Gay Liberation and the Radical Caucus seized the microphone. Kameny denounced the APA's "oppression" of homosexuals by psychiatry, calling it "the enemy incarnate".&lt;ref name=beast /&gt; This was part of Kameny's long-standing protest about the diagnosis of homosexuality, a fight that he had been waging since at least 1964, when he appeared on television to declare that being gay was "not a disease, a pathology, a sickness, a malfunction or a disorder of any sort."  Kameny wrote in ''Psychiatric News'' that "[W]e object to the sickness theory of homosexuality tenaciously held with utter disregard for the disastrous consequences of this theory to the homosexual, based as it is on poor science."&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;&lt;ref name=psychnews&gt;Levin, Aaron (April 28, 2016) [http://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.pn.2016.5a22 "Masked Man Challenged Psychiatrists’ Views on Homosexuality"] ''Psychiatric News''&lt;/ref&gt;

This protest led to a session the next year, at the association's 1972 annual meeting, on homosexuality and mental illness. Entitled "Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to the Homosexual?; A Dialogue" it included Kameny and Gittings on the panel. Gittings' partner, Kay Lahusen, had noted that the panel had on it homosexuals who were not psychiatrists, and psychiatrists who were not homosexuals, but no homosexual psychiatrists, so Gittings set out to find one who would be willing to be a panel member. After numerous contacts, she was unable to find a gay psychiatrist who would speak, so she decided that she would read letters from gay psychiatrists without revealing their names.&lt;ref name= episode /&gt;  She then contacted Fryer, and convinced him to appear.&lt;ref name=bmj&gt;Lenzer, Jeanna (March 22, 2003) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1125557/ "John Fryer"] ''[[British Medical Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=episode /&gt; Fryer later said that the recent death of his father was one factor that caused him to accept the invitation, but his experiences at losing positions because of his homosexuality meant that he did so only after Gittings suggested that he could be disguised.&lt;ref name=episode /&gt;

[[File:Barbara Gittings, Frank Kameny, and John Fryer in disguise as "Dr. H. Anonymous".jpg|thumb|left|325px|[[Barbara Gittings]], [[Franklin Kameny]] and John E. Fryer as "Dr. Henry Anonymous" at a 1972 dialogue discussing [[psychiatry]] and [[homosexuality]].]]

Listed only as "Dr. H. Anonymous", later expanded to "Dr. Henry Anonymous", Fryer appeared on stage wearing a rubber joke shop face mask &amp;ndash; which was sometimes described as a mask of [[Richard M. Nixon]], but which was probably altered from its original state&lt;ref name=hsp2 /&gt; &amp;ndash; a [[Wig (hair)|wig]], and a baggy [[tuxedo (clothing)|tuxedo]] and spoke through a microphone which distorted his voice.{{refn|group=Notes|Fryer was assisted in creating his disguise by his then-boyfriend, who was a drama major.&lt;ref name=episode /&gt;&lt;ref name=beast&gt;Ambrosino, Brandon (December 26, 2015) [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/12/26/the-nixon-masked-man-who-helped-end-homosexuality-as-a-disease.html "The Nixon-Masked Man Who Helped End Homosexuality as a Disease"] ''[[The Daily Beast]]''&lt;/ref&gt; It was not only fear of repercussion which led to the theatricality of Fryer's disguised appearance: he would later chair a meeting of the International Work Group on Death, Dying, and Bereavement in 1974 wearing loudly patterned dashikis and a using ceramic cow bell to keep order; he had a propensity for theatricality.&lt;ref name=bmj /&gt;}} In 2002, Dr. Jack Drescher, then the head of the APA's Committee on Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual Issues pointed out "The irony ... that an openly homosexual psychiatrist had to wear a mask to protect his career. So the fact that someone would get up on stage, even in disguise, at the risk of professional denunciation or loss of job, it was not a small thing. Even in disguise, it was a very, very brave thing to do."&lt;ref name=pgn /&gt;

At the time of his speaking, Fryer was on the faculty of [[Temple University]] in Philadelphia, but did not have the security of [[tenure]], so was in real danger of losing his position if he had been identified &amp;ndash; he had already lost a residency at the [[University of Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref name=bmj /&gt;&lt;ref name=psychnews /&gt; and was later forced to leave a position on the staff of [[Friends Hospital]] because of his flamboyance; ironically the administrator who told him "If you were gay and not flamboyant, we would keep you. If you were flamboyant and not gay we would keep you. But since you are both gay and flamboyant, we cannot keep you" was, according to Fryer, in the front row at his 1972 appearance as Dr. Anonymous, never realizing that Anonymous was Fryer.&lt;ref name=episode /&gt;&lt;ref name=honor /&gt;&lt;ref name=beast /&gt;

Dr. Fryer's speech began "I am a homosexual. I am a psychiatrist",&lt;ref&gt;Fryer, John E. (May 2, 1972) [http://digitalhistory.hsp.org/pafrm/doc/speech-dr-henry-anonymous-john-fryer-american-psychiatric-association-125th-annual-meeting "Speech of "Dr. Henry Anonymous" &lt;nowiki&gt;[John Fryer]&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the American Psychiatric Association 125th Annual Meeting, May 2, 1972"] [[Historical Society of Pennsylvania]] website&lt;/ref&gt; and continued on to describe the lives of the many gay psychiatrists among the APA who had to hide their sexuality from their colleagues for fear of discrimination, and from fellow homosexuals owing to the disdain in which the psychiatric profession was held among the gay community. Fryer's speech also suggested ways in which gay psychiatrists could subtly and "creatively" challenge prejudice in their profession without disclosing their sexuality, and help gay patients adjust to a society that considered their sexual preferences a sign of [[psychopathology]].  There were reportedly more than 100 gay psychiatrists at the convention.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;&lt;ref name=episode /&gt;{{refn|group=Notes|There are some discrepancies between Fryer's handwritten manuscript for the speech, which is in the Fryer collection at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania,&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitallibrary.hsp.org/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/7254 "Item: Speech of "Dr. Henry Anonymous" &amp;#91;John Fryer&amp;#93; at the American Psychiatric Association 125th Annual Meeting"] [[Historical Society of Pennsylvania]] website&lt;/ref&gt; and the text as it has been published in various places.&lt;ref name=episode /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fryer, John E. (May 2, 1972) ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080314224843/http://www.aglp.org/pages/VolumeXXVIII%283%29.html "Dr. H. Anonymous speaks"] ''AGLP Newsletter'' (August 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the manuscript, Fryer writes that there are over 200 gay psychiatrists registered for the APA convention, while the published text claims only 100.  Similarly, the manuscript says "[W]e should have clearly in our minds our own particular understanding of what it is to be a healthy homosexual in a world which sees that appellation as an impossible anachronism", while the published version corrects "anachronism" to "oxymoron".  It is unclear if these changes were made in the process of converting the manuscript to the typescript Fryer read from at the 1972 meeting, or if they were the result of post-event editing of the text before it was published.}}

At least one other panelist agreed with Fryer and Kameny that the stance of the psychiatric establishment toward homosexuality was wrong.  The APA's Vice President at the time, Dr. [[Judd Marmor]] &amp;ndash; who would later become the association's president &amp;ndash; said "I must concede that psychiatry is prejudiced as has been charged. Psychiatric mores reflect the predominant social mores of the culture."  He later wrote "In a democratic society we recognize the rights of such individuals to have widely divergent religious preferences, as long as they do not attempt to force their beliefs on others who do not share them. Our attitudes toward divergent sexual preferences, however, are quite different, obviously because moral values &amp;ndash; couched in 'medical' and 'scientific' rationalizations &amp;ndash; are involved."&lt;ref name=psychnews /&gt;

Also appearing on the panel were Dr. Kent Robinson, from Shepherd Pratt Psychiatric Hospital, and Robert Seidenberg.&lt;ref name=episode /&gt;

After the panel discussion, Fryer appeared for two hours on a local radio talk show as Dr. Anonymous with his voice disguised, broadcast, Fryer later said, from one of the gay bars in the area.&lt;ref name=episode /&gt; Although some of his colleagues knew who he was, at the time of his speech and later,  Fryer did not formally acknowledge having been Dr. Anonymous until the APA's 1994 convention in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;&lt;ref name=hsp2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=psychnews /&gt;

Homosexuality was removed from the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual'' in 1973, a year after Fryer's speech &amp;ndash; leading the now-defunct ''[[Philadelphia Bulletin]]'' to print the headline "Homosexuals gain instant cure"&lt;ref name=bmj /&gt;&lt;ref name=pgn /&gt; &amp;ndash; and Fryer's speech has been cited as a key factor in persuading the psychiatric community to reach this decision.&lt;ref name="scatsa2002"&gt;Scasta D. L. (2003) "John E. Fryer, MD, and the Dr. H. Anonymous Episode" ''Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Psychotherapy'' Volume:6 Issue:4 pp.73–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Gittings later said of it: "His speech shook up psychiatry. He was the right person at the right time."&lt;ref name=bmj /&gt;  Fryer himself later wrote in 1985, in the newsletter of the [[Association of Gay and Lesbian Psychiatrists]], that it was "something that had to be done" and "the central event in my career." "I had been thrown out of a residency because I was gay. I lost a job because I was gay. ... It had to be said, but I couldn't do it as me. ... I was not yet full time on the [Temple] faculty. I am now tenured, and tenured by a chairman who knows I'm gay. That's how things have changed."&lt;ref name=inqobit&gt;Pray, Rusty (February 26, 2003) [http://articles.philly.com/2003-02-26/news/25451384_1_gay-rights-barbara-gittings-lesbian-psychiatrists "John E. Fryer, 65, psychiatrist" (obituary)] ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pgn /&gt;

Ironically, since the removal of homosexuality from the ''DSM'', APA meetings have been disrupted by "ex-gay" activists seeking to have homosexuality classified as a mental disorder again. According to Drescher: "Every year, we get a group of people who ... ask for homosexuality to be put back in the manual. ... They're, interestingly, the only group who does it. Every other group wants their diagnoses taken out; they want theirs back in."&lt;ref name=pgn /&gt;

== Later life and death ==
Fryer became a [[professor]] at Temple, both of psychiatry, and of family and community medicine.  He specialized in the treatment of drug and alcohol addiction as well as in death and bereavement.&lt;ref name=pgn&gt;DiGiacomo, Robert (2002) "Dr. H. Anonymous; 'Instant cure' recalled; Being gay was an illness 30 years ago" ''[[Philadelphia Gay News]]''; reprinted in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080314224843/http://www.aglp.org/pages/VolumeXXVIII%283%29.html ''AGLP Newsletter''] (August 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=beast /&gt; Sometime after 1973, he began treating gay men with [[AIDS]] who were dying, seeing them in his home office rather than in his practice at Temple, for reasons of patient confidentiality.&lt;ref name=hsp2 /&gt; He was involved in setting up Physicians in Transition, Temple's Family Life Development Center, the APA's International Work Group on Death, Dying, and Bereavement and the Philadelphia AIDS Task Force. In 1980, at the behest of Dame [[Cicely Saunders]], founder of London's [[St Christopher's Hospice]], he took a sabbatical from Temple and helped to restructure the hospice's education department.&lt;ref name=bmj /&gt;  He retired from Temple in 2000.&lt;ref name=inqobit /&gt;

In 2002, it was reported that Fryer had accepted a position at a hospital in the [[Northern Territory]] of [[Australia]],&lt;ref name=pgn /&gt; but he never took up that post.

Fryer was also a musician, playing the organ. For 30 years was the choirmaster of [[St. Peter's Church, Philadelphia|St. Peter's Church]] in the [[Germantown, Philadelphia|Germantown]] neighborhood of Philadelphia where he lived;&lt;ref name=find&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/49661173 "Dr John Ercel Fryer"] at [[Find-a-Grave]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inqobit /&gt; he also played the organ for Temple University graduations.&lt;ref name=hsp2 /&gt;

Fryer was being treated for [[diabetes]] and [[pulmonary sarcoidosis]], and eventually died from [[gastrointestinal bleeding]] and aspiration [[pneumonia]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="latobit"&gt;Staff (March 08, 2003) [http://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/08/local/me-passings8.4 "Dr. John E.

==Awards and honors==
Fryer received a "Distinguished Alumnus" aware from Vanderbilt University in 2002, and in that same year was awarded a Distinguished Service Award from the [[Association of Gay and Lesbian Psychiatrists]] (AGLP), now the Association of LGBTQ Psychiatrists.&lt;ref name=inqobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=pgn /&gt; After his death, the AGLP, along with the American Psychiatric Association, endowed the APA's "John E.

In May 2016, a play by [[Ain Gordon]], ''217 Boxes of Dr. Henry Anonymous'' &amp;ndash; based on Gordon's research as an "embedded artist" at the [[Historical Society of Pennsylvania]] (HSP), where Fryer's papers are archived &amp;ndash; premiered at the [[Painted Bride Art Center]] in Philadelphia.  The play explores Fryer and the circumstances around his 1972 appearance at the APA convention through monologues by three people who knew him: Alfred A. Gross, the Executive Director of the New York City-based George W. Henry Foundation, a social charity which helped homosexual men who had gotten into trouble with the law; Katherine M.

There are two notable allegations of '''lampshades made from human skin'''. After [[World War II]] it was alleged that [[Nazi]]s had made lampshades from murdered concentration camp inmates. In the 1950s, murderer [[Ed Gein]], possibly influenced by the stories about the Nazis, made a lampshade from the skin of one of his victims.

==History of anthropodermia==
The display of the flayed skin of defeated enemies has a long history. In ancient [[Assyria]], the flaying of defeated enemies and dissidents was common practice. The Assyrians would leave the skin to tan on their city walls.&lt;ref name=HLR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hlrecord.org/?p=12516 |title=Books Bound in Human Skin; Lampshade Myth? &amp;#124; The Record |publisher=[[Harvard Law Record]] |date=11 November 2005 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several claims that the binding of some ancient and medieval books may be made of human skin. Allegedly, a 13th-century bible and a text of the Decretals were bound in human skin. Along with this hearsay, there are reports of copies of the [[French Constitution of 1793|1793 French Constitution]] being written on human skin and 19th-century anatomy textbooks being symbolically bound in skin.&lt;ref name=HLR/&gt;

==Nazi era==

After the defeat of Nazi Germany, claims circulated that [[Ilse Koch]], wife of the commandant of [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], had possessed lampshades made of human skin, and had specifically tattooed prisoners killed in order to use their skin for this purpose.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ilse Koch is given life term |work=[[Gettysburg Times]] |date=15 January 1951 |page=2 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0IElAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3fQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4254%2C5369899 |accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her conviction for war crimes, General [[Lucius D. Clay]], the interim military governor of the [[American Zone]] in Germany, reduced her sentence to four years' prison on the grounds "there was no convincing evidence that she had selected [[Nazi concentration camp]] inmates for extermination in order to secure tattooed skins, or that she possessed any articles made of human skin".&lt;ref name="Time_1950-12-25"&gt;{{cite journal |title=GERMANY: Very Special Present |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,859084,00.html#ixzz1JwxlL7xG |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=25 December 1950}} {{subscription required |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Edward Smith]] in his biography, ''Lucius D. Clay, an American Life'', reported that the general had maintained that the leather lamp shades were really made out of [[Goatskin (material)|goat skin]]. The book quotes a statement made by General Clay years later:

:There was absolutely no evidence in the trial transcript, other than she was a rather loathsome creature, that would support the death sentence. I suppose I received more abuse for that than for anything else I did in Germany. Some reporter had called her the "Bitch of Buchenwald", had written that she had lamp shades made of human skin in her house. And that was introduced in court, where it was absolutely proven that the lamp shades were made out of goat skin.&lt;ref name="GoatSkin"&gt;{{cite book | title=Lucius D. Clay: An American Life | publisher=Macmillan | author=Smith, Jean Edward | year=1990 | pages=301 | isbn=9780805009996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charges were made once more when she was rearrested, but again were found to be groundless.&lt;ref name="Time_1950-12-25"/&gt; Journalist Mark Jacobson claims to be in possession of this lampshade, but those claims are disputed.&lt;ref name="SANTORO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Santoro|first1=Gene|title=A Human Skin Lampshade Sparks a Journey into the Heart of the Holocaust {{!}} HistoryNet|url=http://www.historynet.com/a-human-skin-lampshade-sparks-a-journey-into-the-heart-of-the-holocaust.htm|website=www.historynet.com|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacobson|first1=Mark|title=The Lampshade: A Holocaust Detective Story from Buchenwald to New Orleans|date=2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781416566304|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ay4YLEhc_rUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Lampshade:+A+Holocaust+Detective+Story&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT_qiC5PrXAhVCE7wKHb1TA6gQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Lampshade%3A%20A%20Holocaust%20Detective%20Story&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ed Gein==
[[Ed Gein]] was a killer and body snatcher, active in the 1950s, who made trophies from corpses he stole from a local graveyard. When he was finally arrested, a search of the premises revealed, among other disturbing artifacts, a lampshade made out of human skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chloe Castleden|title=Ed Gein: The Psycho Cannibal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C3_Wx5nIt_UC&amp;pg=PP11|date=18 August 2011|publisher=Constable &amp; Robinson Limited|isbn=978-1-78033-341-0|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gein appears to have been influenced by the then-current stories about the Nazis collecting body parts in order to make lampshades and other items.&lt;ref&gt;Gelbin, Cathy, "Metaphors of Genocide", in Duttinger et al (ed), ''Performance and Performativity in German Cultural Studies'', Peter Lang, 2003, p.233.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{In popular culture|date=December 2017}}
In a 1970 episode of the first series of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' sketch "Mr. Hitler and the Minehead by-election", [[Adolf Hitler]] (played by [[John Cleese]]) says, "If he opens his big mouth again ... it's lampshade time!"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibras.dk/montypython/episode12.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1973 [[London Weekend Television]] drama ''[[The Death of Adolf Hitler]]'', Doctor [[Karl Gebhardt]] (played by [[Ray McAnally]]) claims to Hitler ([[Frank Finlay]]) that the lampshade in his office in the [[Führerbunker]] is made of human skin. Hitler is disgusted and flies into a rage, violently throwing the lamp away, showing Hitler's cognitive dissonance between his personal morality and the twisted inhumanity of his orders.

In 1995, [[August Kreis III]] was ejected from the set of ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' after telling the host "Your relatives – weren't they all turned into [[soap made from human corpses|soap]] or lampshades?... I've got your mom in the trunk of my car".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2011/12/15/neo-nazi-leader-august-kreis-sentenced-for-fraud/ |title=Neo-Nazi Leader August Kreis Sentenced for Fraud |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |date=15 December 2011 |accessdate=11 May 2015 |author=Lenz, Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "Skinned" from the 1995 [[Blind Melon]] album ''[[Soup (Blind Melon album)|Soup]]'' is about Ed Gein and contains the lyrics "I'll make a lampshade of durable skin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/Blind-melon-skinned-lyrics|title=Skinned|last=|first=|date=|website=genius.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A human lampshade appears in [[Ken Russell]]'s 2007 short satire ''[[A Kitten for Hitler]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller |author2=Nayeri, Farah |first=Ian |title=U.K. Provocateur Ken Russell, Director of ‘Tommy,’ Dies at 84 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-11/u-k-provocateur-ken-russell-director-of-tommy-dies-at-84.html |accessdate=22 December 2012 |newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=11 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016185113/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-11/u-k-provocateur-ken-russell-director-of-tommy-dies-at-84.html |archivedate=16 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Lenny, an American Jewish boy, who has a [[Nazi symbolism|swastika]]-shaped [[birthmark]], tries to soften Hitler's heart by giving him a kitten, but when Hitler sees the birthmark, he has [[Eva Braun]] kill Lenny to make him into a lampshade for their bedside table lamp. Near the end of the film, in what appears to be [[miracle#Judaism|an act of God]], the swastika transforms into the [[Star of David]].

In 2010 author [[Mark Jacobson]] published ''[[The Lampshade: A Holocaust Detective Story from Buchenwald to New Orleans]]''. In it he described how after [[Hurricane Katrina]] he uncovered a lamp which he believed to be made of human skin, and which may have come from a Nazi [[concentration camp]]. Initial flawed DNA testing appeared to show this was the case,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Santoro |first=Gene |url=http://www.historynet.com/a-human-skin-lampshade-sparks-a-journey-into-the-heart-of-the-holocaust.htm |title=A Human Skin Lampshade Sparks a Journey into the Heart of the Holocaust |publisher=Historynet.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later more sophisticated testing proved it was cow skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Human Lampshade: A Holocaust Mystery|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNb1MZbqalk&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=2294|language=en|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colonel Leslie MacDill''' was a [[United States Army Air Corps]] officer. [[MacDill Air Force Base]] near Tampa, Florida is named in his honor.  Colonel MacDill was one of aviation’s early pioneers.

==Biography==
Colonel MacDill was born at [[Monmouth, Illinois]] on 18 February 1889. Following his graduation in 1909 from [[Hanover College]] with an A.B. degree, and from the [[University of Indiana]] in 1911 with an A.M. degree, he was commissioned from civilian life as a Second Lieutenant, Coast Artillery Corps on 13 April 1912.

He served with the 6th Company, Coast Artillery Corps from 10 December 1912, until his detail in 1914 in the Aviation Section, Signal Corps. Upon completion of his flying training at the Signal Corps Aviation School at [[San Diego]], California, he was rated a Junior Military Aviator on 2 July 1915, which automatically advanced him to the rank of First Lieutenant. He was promoted to Captain on 15 May 1917; to Major 1 July 1920; to Lieutenant Colonel 1 August 1935; and to Colonel on 26 August 1936.

===Death===
Colonel MacDill died as the result of an airplane crash on the morning of 9 November 1938, in Washington D.C. The accident occurred several minutes after his take off from [[Bolling Field]] in a BC-1 aircraft.

Accounts pieced together from numerous eyewitnesses indicated that something went wrong with the motor. Colonel MacDill first tried to get back to Bolling Field, and then with death staring him in the face, aimed his plane for a narrow space between two houses. The descending plane cut down telephone and power wires, knocked down a pole, clipped off tree limbs, plunged to the ground and burst into flames. Colonel MacDill and his passenger Private Joseph G. Gloxner were killed instantly.

==1970s==
* ''[[Metallic K.O.]]'' is an infamous live recording by [[The Stooges]]. During much of the performance, [[Iggy Pop]] sings while pieces of ice, eggs, beer bottles and jelly beans, among other things, are thrown at him in response to his audience-baiting. In the essay "Iggy Pop: Blowtorch in Bondage" critic [[Lester Bangs]] calls the album a "documentation of the Iggy holocaust at its most nihilistically out of control." He describes the Stooges concert he attended that immediately preceded the ''Metallic K.O.'' performances:
{{cquote|''The audience, which consisted largely of bikers, was unusually hostile, and Iggy, as usual, fed on that hostility, soaked it up and gave it back and absorbed it all over again in an eerie, frightening symbiosis. "All right," he finally said, stopping a song in the middle, "you assholes wanta hear 'Louie, Louie,' we'll give you 'Louie, Louie.'" So the Stooges played a forty-five-minute version of "Louie Louie," including new lyrics improvised by the Pop on the spot consisting of "You can suck my ass / You biker faggot sissies," etc.

''By now the hatred in the room is one huge livid wave, and Iggy singles out one heckler who has been particularly abusive: "Listen, asshole, you heckle me one more time and I'm gonna come down there and kick your ass." "Fuck you, you little punk," responds the biker. So Iggy jumps off the stage, runs through the middle of the crowd, and the guy beats the shit out of him, ending the evening's musical festivities by sending the lead singer back to his motel room and a doctor. I walk into the dressing room, where I encounter the manager of the club offering to punch out anybody in the band who will take him on. The next day the bike gang, who call themselves the Scorpions, will phone WABX-FM and promise to kill Iggy and the Stooges if they play the Michigan Palace on Thursday night. They do (play, that is), and nobody gets killed, but ''Metallic K.O.'' is the only rock album I know where you can actually hear hurled beer bottles breaking against guitar strings.''}}

* On June 3, 1977, restless fans threw rocks and bottles at [[Led Zeppelin]] when a concert in [[Tampa, Florida]] ended early due to a thunderstorm, even though the tickets said "rain or shine", resulting in a small riot that left over 100 injured due to [[crowd crushing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=June 3, 1977|url=http://www.ledzeppelin.com/node/789/257|website=Led Zeppelin official site|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marco Enrico Bossi''' (April 25, 1861 in [[Salò]] – February 20, 1925) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[organist]], [[composer]], [[improviser]] and [[pedagogue]] ({{See LMST|Marco Enrico|Bossi}}).

==Life==
Bossi was born in [[Salò]], a town in the [[province of Brescia]], [[Lombardy]], into a family of musicians. His father, Pietro, was organist at Salò Cathedral, which has a one-manual organ built by [[Fratelli Serassi]] from 1865 (opus 684), which was restored in 2000/2001. He had two brothers, [[Costante Adolfo Bossi]] and Pietro Bossi.

He received his musical training at the [[Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini|Liceo Musicale]] in [[Bologna]] and the [[Milan Conservatory]], where his teachers included Francesco Sangalli (piano), [[Amilcare Ponchielli]] (composition) and [[Polibio Fumagalli]] (organ).

In 1881, Bossi became director of music and organist at [[Como]] Cathedral. Nine years later, he was appointed as professor of organ and harmony at [[Naples]] Conservatory. In addition, he held directorships at conservatories in [[Venice]] (1895–1901), [[Bologna]] (1902–1911) and [[Rome]] (1916–1923), where he established and implemented the standards of organ studies that are still used in Italy today. His notable pupils included [[Giulio Bas]], [[Giacomo Benvenuti]], [[Giorgio Federico Ghedini]], and [[Gian Francesco Malipiero]]. Throughout his career, Bossi made numerous international organ recital tours, which brought him in contact with well-known colleagues such as [[César Franck]], [[Marcel Dupré]], [[Alexandre Guilmant]], [[Joseph Bonnet]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns]], Charles M. Courboin, and [[Karl Straube]].

In November 1924, Bossi embarked on a recital tour to New York and Philadelphia, where he made important appearances at [[Wanamaker's]] department stores in New York and in Philadelphia, where he played the [[Wanamaker Organ]], the world's largest pipe organ. Bossi died unexpectedly at sea while returning from the United States on February 20, 1925, and was interred at Como.

==Compositions==
Marco Enrico Bossi wrote more than 150 works for various genres (orchestra, five operas, oratorios, choral and chamber music, as well as pieces for piano and organ). His catalog of compositions is still largely unknown, except for his organ works.
Andrea Macinanti is recording Marco Enrico Bossi's complete organ works for Tactus label.

'''Megaspores''', also called '''macrospores''', are a type of [[spore]] that is present in [[heterosporous]] [[plant]]s. These plants have two spore types, megaspores and [[microspore]]s. Generally speaking, the megaspore, or large spore, germinates into a female [[gametophyte]], which produces [[egg cell]]s. These are fertilized by [[sperm]] produced by the male gametophyte developing from the microspore. Heterosporous plants include the following:

* seed plants ([[gymnosperm]]s and [[flowering plant]]s)
* water ferns ([[Salviniales]])
* spikemosses ([[Selaginellaceae]])

==Megasporogenesis==
In gymnosperms and flowering plants, the megaspore is produced inside the nucleus of the [[ovule]].  During megasporogenesis, a diploid precursor cell, the '''megasporocyte''' or megaspore mother cell, undergoes [[meiosis]] to produce initially four haploid cells ('''the megaspores''').&lt;ref name="Estrada-Lun"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Beyond Promiscuity: From Sexuality to Apomixis in Flowering Plants | journal = [[In Vitro Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology – Plant]] | date = Mar–Apr 2002 | first = A.

The monosporic pattern occurs most frequently (&gt;70% of angiosperms) and is found in many economically and biologically important groups such as Brassicaceae (e.g., ''Arabidopsis'', ''Capsella'', ''Brassica''), Gramineae (e.g., maize, rice, wheat), Malvaceae (e.g., cotton), Leguminoseae (e.g., beans, soybean), and Solanaceae (e.g., pepper, tobacco, tomato, potato, petunia).&lt;ref name="YadegariaDrews"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Female Gametophyte Development | journal = The Plant Cell | date = 2004-04-09 | first = Ramin | last = Yadegaria |author2=Gary N. Drewsb | volume = 16 | issue = Suppl | pages = S133–S141, Supplement | url = http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/16/suppl_1/S133 | accessdate = 2010-11-28 | doi=10.1105/tpc.018192| pmc = 2643389 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This pattern is characterized by cell plate formation after [[meiosis]] 1 &amp; 2, which results in four one-nucleate megaspores, of which three degenerate.  The bisporic pattern is characterized by cell plate formation only after meiosis 1, and results in two two-nucleate megaspores, of which one degenerates. The tetrasporic pattern is characterized by cell plates failing to form after either meiosis 1 or 2, and results in one four-nucleate megaspore.  Therefore, each pattern gives rise to a single functional megaspore which contains one, two, or four meiotic nuclei, respectively.&lt;ref name="YadegariaDrews" /&gt; The megaspore then undergoes megagametogenesis to give rise to the female [[gametophyte]].

==Megagametogenesis==
[[Image:Ovule-Gymno-Angio-en.svg|thumb|300px|Plant ovules with megasporocytes before meiosis: Gymnosperm ovule on left, angiosperm ovule (inside ovary) on right]]
After megasporogenesis, the megaspore develops into the female [[gametophyte]] (the embryo sac) in a process called megagametogenesis.  The process of megagametogenesis varies depending on which pattern of megasporogenesis occurred.  Some species, such as ''Tridax trilobata'', ''Ehretia laevis'', and ''Alectra thomsoni'', can undergo different patterns of megasporogenesis and therefore different patterns of megagametogenesis.    
If the monosporic pattern occurred, the single [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] undergoes [[mitosis]] three times, producing an eight-nucleate cell.  These eight nuclei are arranged into two groups of four. These groups both send a nucleus to the center of the cell; these become the polar nuclei.  Depending on the species, these nuclei fuse together before or upon fertilization of the central cell. The three nuclei at the end of the cell near the micropylar become the egg apparatus, with an egg cell in the center and two synergids. At the other end of the cell, a cell wall forms around the nuclei and forms the antipodals. Therefore, the resulting embryo sac is a seven-celled structure consisting of one central cell, one egg cell, two synergid cells, and three antipodal cells.&lt;ref name="YadegariaDrews" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Raven | first1 = Peter H. | last2 = Evert | first2 = Ray Franklin. | last3 = Eichhorn | first3 = Susan E. | title = Biology of Plants | year = 2005 | publisher = W.H. Freeman | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-7167-1007-2 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The bisporic and tetrasporic patterns undergo varying processes and result in varying embryo sacs as well.  In ''Lilium'' which has a tetrasporic pattern, the central cell of the embryo sac is 4N.  Therefore, upon fertilization the endosperm will be 5N rather than the typical 3N.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Recent work on the results of fertilization in angiosperms | journal = Annals of Botany | year = 1900 | first = E. | last = Sargent | volume = 14 | pages = 689–712 | url = http://images.iasprr.org/lily/female.shtml | accessdate = 2010-11-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101210182228/http://images.iasprr.org/lily/female.shtml | archivedate = 2010-12-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, a '''multibrot set''' is the set of values in the [[complex plane]] whose absolute value remains below some finite value throughout iterations by a member of the general [[Monic polynomial|monic univariate polynomial]] family of [[recursion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mrob.com/pub/muency/multibrotset.html |title = Definition of multibrots |accessdate = 2008-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://yu.jason.googlepages.com/themandelbrotset7 |title = Multibrots |accessdate = 2008-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://sylvester.bth.rwth-aachen.de/dissertationen/2002/110/02_110.pdf |title = Homeomorphisms on Edges of the Mandelbrot Set |author = Wolf Jung |page = 23 |quote = The Multibrot set Md is the connectedness locus of the family of unicritical polynomials ''z''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''c'', ''d''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is a [[portmanteau]] of multiple and [[Mandelbrot set]].

:&lt;math&gt; z \mapsto z^d + c . \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''d''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2.  The exponent ''d'' may be further generalized to negative and fractional values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=multibrot+set%2C+d%3D6 |title = WolframAlpha Computation Knowledge Engine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several graphics are available but, as far as can be verified, none of these have been taken a step further to display a 3-D stack of the various stages so that the evolution of the general shape can be seen from other than vertically above.

The case of

: &lt;math&gt; d = 2\,&lt;/math&gt;

is the classic [[Mandelbrot set]] from which the name is derived.

The sets for other values of ''d'' also show fractal images&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM5chKSP_6s&amp;feature=related |title = Animated morph of multibrots ''d''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;7 to 7 |accessdate = 2008-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when they are plotted on the complex plane.

Each of the examples of various powers ''d'' shown below is plotted to the same scale. Values of ''c'' belonging to the set are black. Values of ''c'' that have unbounded value under recursion, and thus do not belong in the set, are plotted in different colours, that show as contours, depending on the number of recursions that caused a value to exceed a fixed magnitude in the Escape Time algorithm.

===Positive powers===
The example {{nowrap|''d'' {{=}} 2}} is the original Mandelbrot set. The examples for {{nowrap|''d'' &gt; 2}} are often called ''multibrot sets''. These sets include the origin and have fractal perimeters, with {{nowrap|(''d'' &amp;minus; 1)-fold}} rotational symmetry.

|}

===Negative powers===
When ''d'' is negative the set surrounds but does not include the origin. There is interesting complex behaviour in the contours between the set and the origin, in a star-shaped area with {{nowrap|(1 &amp;minus; ''d'')-fold}} rotational symmetry. The sets appear to have a circular perimeter, however this is just an artifact of the fixed maximum radius allowed by the Escape Time algorithm, and is not a limit of the sets that actually extend in all directions to infinity.

|}

===Fractional powers===
[[File:Multibrots -2 to 2.gif]]
===Rendering along the exponent===
An alternative method is to render the exponent along the vertical axis. This requires either fixing the real or the imaginary value, and rendering the remaining value along the horizontal axis. The resulting set rises vertically from the origin in a narrow column to infinity. Magnification reveals increasing complexity. The first prominent bump or spike is seen at an exponent of 2, the location of the traditional Mandelbrot set at its cross-section. The third image here renders on a plane that is fixed at a 45-degree angle between the real and imaginary axes.

==Rendering images==
All the above images are rendered using an Escape Time algorithm that identifies points outside the set in a simple way. Much greater fractal detail is revealed by plotting the [[Lyapunov exponent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Computers &amp; Graphics |volume = 17 |issue = 5 |date = Sep 1993 |pages = 603–607 |url = http://www.righto.com/papers/frac3.ps |title = An Investigation of Fractals Generated by ''z''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;1/''z''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''c'' |author = Ken Shirriff |accessdate = 2008-09-28 |doi = 10.1016/0097-8493(93)90012-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; as shown by the example below. The Lyapunov exponent is the error growth-rate of a given sequence. First calculate the iteration sequence with ''N'' iterations, then calculate the exponent as

: &lt;math&gt; \lambda = \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{N} \ln | \mathbf{z}| &lt;/math&gt;

and if the exponent is negative the sequence is stable. The white pixels in the picture are the parameters ''c'' for which the exponent is positive aka unstable. The colours show the periods of the cycles which the orbits are attracted to. All points colored dark-blue (outside) are attracted by a fixed point, all points in the middle (lighter blue) are attracted by a period 2 cycle and so on.
[[Image:Power-2pe.png|thumb|200px|Enlarged first quadrant of the multibrot set for the iteration ''z'' {{mapsto}} {{nowrap|''z''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''c''}} rendered with the Escape Time algorithm.]]

Periodicity checking was used to colour the set according to the period of the cycles of the orbits.]]

===Pseudocode===
&lt;source lang="rst"&gt;
ESCAPE TIME ALGORITHM
=====================

    For each pixel on the screen do:
    {
      x = x0 = x co-ordinate of pixel
      y = y0 = y co-ordinate of pixel
    
      iteration = 0
      max_iteration = 1000
    
      while ( x*x + y*y &lt;= (2*2) AND iteration &lt; max_iteration )
      {
        /* INSERT CODE(S)FOR Z^d FROM TABLE BELOW */
    
        iteration = iteration + 1
      }
    
      if ( iteration == max_iteration )
      then
        colour = black
      else
        colour = iteration
    
      plot(x0,y0,colour)
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Kori JoAnne Lamaster''' was a formerly unidentified [[Americans|American]] murder victim who was found on January 29, 1994. She was reburied in an unmarked grave at Soquel Cemetery. Lamaster's [[unidentified decedent|body remained unidentified]] for nineteen years until the comparison of familial DNA and a finger print card revealed her identity. Until then, she was referred to as '''Pogonip Jane''' by investigators and media.&lt;ref name=victim&gt;{{cite news|title='Pogonip Jane' murder mystery solved by Santa Cruz police|url=http://www.ksbw.com/news/central-california/santa-cruz/pogonip-jane-mystery-solved-by-santa-cruz-police/23295552|work=KSBW|agency=|date=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=victim2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kava|first1=Brad|title=Two Decade Old 'Pogonip Jane' Cold Case Solved by Santa Cruz Police|url=http://patch.com/california/santacruz/two-decade-old-pogonip-jane-cold-case-solved-by-santa-cruz-police|accessdate=October 19, 2015|work=Santa Cruz Patch|publisher=|date=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical characteristics and clothing==
The decomposed remains of a white female were found in a shallow grave near a [[homeless]] campsite on January 19, 1994 in Pogonip Park in [[Santa Cruz, California]]. It was discovered by two hikers looking for mushrooms.&lt;ref name=preid&gt;{{cite news|title=Detectives search for leads in death, identity of 'Pogonip Jane' 16 years after her body was found|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/general-news/20100110/detectives-search-for-leads-in-death-identity-of-pogonip-jane-16-years-after-her-body-was-found|work=Santa Cruz Sentinel|agency=|date=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victim was identified as being in her late teens with brown hair cut short and pink fingernails. Her death was estimated to have occurred a couple of weeks prior to the discovery; the cause of death was ruled to be [[blunt trauma|bludgeoning]] with a metal object most likely a pipe that had crushed her [[skull]]. Due to advanced [[decomposition]], it was hard to ascertain her facial features. A tiny heart was discovered tattooed between her left thumb and index finger. Her teeth had a few cavities that had been filled in with porcelain. Isotopic hair analysis revealed she had traveled between Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz (she lived in Pacifica) prior to her death.&lt;ref name=preid/&gt;

==Investigation==
[[File:Kori Lamaster reconstruction.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Clay reconstruction of the victim]]

The Santa Cruz Police Department got a fresh impetus to investigate the case when its original investigator Butch Baker was murdered in an unrelated crime. They decided to work towards solving the case in Baker's honor.&lt;ref name=Butch&gt;{{cite news|title=Santa Cruz ‘Pogonip Jane’ cold case murder takes ironic twist|url=http://www.kcba.com/2013/12/05/santa-cruz-pogonip-jane-cold-case-murder-takes-ironic-twist/|work=KCBA News|agency=|date=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategies taken subsequently in an attempt to arrive at an identification included the creation of a clay model [[forensic facial reconstruction|reconstruction]] based on the skull of the victim.&lt;ref name=Butch/&gt;

==Identification==
Lamaster's family didn't file a [[missing person]] report for her until 2007. The reason for the delay in filing a report was not revealed due to privacy reasons.&lt;ref name=GettingWarmer&gt;{{cite news|title=Getting Warmer|url=http://www.gtweekly.com/index.php/santa-cruz-news/santa-cruz-local-news/5288-getting-warmer.html|work=Good Times|agency=|date=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A DNA sample from her biological mother was submitted and the State Department of Justice lab announced a familial match in October 2013 with [[DNA]] taken from the victim's body that had been entered into their system earlier.&lt;ref name=Butch/&gt;

Contact with Lamaster's sister in the state of Washington provided a fingerprint card taken when Lamaster was young which was then used to match prints taken during her autopsy.&lt;ref name=Butch/&gt; A father and son who had been seen travelling with Lamaster have been identified as persons of interest. The son has since died, while the father, Wayne White, resided in eastern Tennessee&lt;ref name=GettingWarmer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;korilamaster17.com&lt;/ref&gt;  for a period but has since also passed away.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

'''Neural computation''' is the hypothetical information processing performed by networks of [[neuron]]s. Neural computation is affiliated with the philosophical tradition known as [[Computational Theory of Mind]], also referred to as computationalism, which advances the thesis that neural computation explains cognition. The first persons to propose an account of neural activity as being computational was [[Warren Sturgis McCulloch|Warren McCullock]] and [[Walter Pitts]] in their seminal 1943 paper, A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity. There are three general branches of computationalism, including classicism, [[connectionism]], and [[computational neuroscience]]. All three branches agree that cognition is computation, however they disagree on what sorts of computations constitute cognition. The classicism tradition believes that computation in the brain is digital, analogous with digital computing. Both connectionism and computational neuroscience do not require that the computations which realize cognition are necessarily digital computations. However, the two branches greatly disagree upon which sorts of experimental data should be used to construct explanatory models of cognitive phenomena. Connectionists rely upon behavioral evidence to construct models to explain cognitive phenomenon, whereas computational neuroscience leverages neuroanatomical and neurophysiological information to construct mathematical models which explain cognition.

When comparing the three main traditions of the computational theory of mind, as well as the different possible forms of computation in the brain, it is helpful to define what we mean by computation in a general sense. Computation is the processing of vehicles, otherwise known as variables or entities, according to a set of rules. A rule in this sense is simply an instruction for executing a manipulation on the current state of the variable, in order to produce an specified output. In other words, a rule dictates which output to produce given a certain input to the computing system. A computing system is a mechanism whose components must be functionally organized to process the vehicles in accordance with the established set of rules. The types of vehicles processed by a computing system determines which type of computations it performs. Traditionally, in cognitive science there have been two proposed types of computation related to neural activity - [[Digital computer|digital]] and [[Analog computer|analog]], with the vast majority of theoretical work incorporating a digital understanding of cognition. Computing systems which perform digital computation are functionally organized to execute operations on strings of digits with respect to the type and location of the digit on the string. It has been argued that neural spike train signaling implements some form of digital computation, since [[Action potential|neural spikes]] may be considered as discrete units or digits, like 0 or 1 - the neuron either fires an action potential or it does not. Accordingly, neural spike trains could be seen as strings of digits. Alternatively, analog computing systems perform manipulations on non-discrete, irreducibly continuous variables, that is, entities which vary continuously as a function of time. These sorts of operations are characterized by systems of differential equations.

Neural computation can be studied for example by building [[models of neural computation]].

There is a scientific journal dedicated to this subject, ''[[Neural Computation (journal)|Neural Computation]]''.

[[Artificial neural network]]s (ANN) is subfield of the research area [[machine learning]]. Work on ANNs has been somewhat inspired by knowledge of neural computation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5386">[[File:Robert Cochrane and the Earl of Angus.jpg|thumb|A 1906 illustration depicting Robert Cochrane (right) being arrested by the Earl of Angus in 1482]]
'''Robert Cochrane''' (possibly died 1482) is said to have been an [[architect]] or [[masonry|mason]] who lived in the reign of King [[James III of Scotland]] and who became a royal [[favourite]]. His influence over the king is said to have incurred the wrath of the aristocracy, culminating in a ''coup'' in which he was killed.

There exists a good deal of controversy about the accuracy of the received story of his influence on the king, linked to broader issues about the reign of James III. These issues concern the theme of a king taking advice from low-born favourites rather than from established noble councillors.

==Story==
The traditional view is that James was a cultured man in the context of his time, but otherwise had some serious character flaws, a weak king and a dilettante who surrounded himself with a group of talented but low-born favourites.  Cochrane was the most important of these favourites. He is said to have designed the Great Hall at Stirling Castle, and perhaps that at Falkland.&lt;ref name = "his"&gt;Fiona Somerset Fry &amp; Peter Somerset Fry, ''The History of Scotland'', Routledge, London, 1992, p.111.&lt;/ref&gt; To some extent he governed the country during the 1470s. He is said to have advised the king to debase the coinage in order to raise cash. He was opposed by the king's younger brothers, [[Alexander Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany]] and [[John Stewart, Earl of Mar (d. 1479)|John Stewart, Earl of Mar]].  Mar was arrested and imprisoned, dying shortly thereafter; Albany escaped and gathered support in England.&lt;ref name = "his"/&gt; The king is said to have given Cochrane the title of Earl of Mar after his brother's death, though no record of this survives.&lt;ref&gt;N. A. T. Macdougall, ‘“It is I, the earle of Mar”: in search of Thomas Cochrane’, R. Mason and N. A. T. Macdougall (eds.), People and Power in Scotland: Essays in Honour of T. C. Smout (Edinburgh, 1992), 28–49, 42–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Cochrane's  downfall came during an [[capture of Berwick (1482)|invasion by an English army]] led by the king's younger brother, the [[Alexander Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany|Duke of Albany]], and the Duke of Gloucester, the future King [[Richard III of England]]. Albany had promised to give part of Scotland to England in exchange for being placed on the throne. A cabal of aristocrats, led by [[Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus]], decided that they must get rid of Cochrane and the other favourites in order to secure the Scottish crown. Angus chose to "[[bell the cat]]", as he put it.  Cochrane and the king's other favourites were with the king's army at [[Lauder]] Bridge when a group of nobles refused to continue south to meet the enemy. Angus led the way by arresting Cochrane. The group then detained the king himself and hanged all the favourites from a bridge.&lt;ref name = "his"/&gt;

==Doubts about the story==
In the late 20th century much of this came to be questioned.  Some historians have been more sympathetic to James III, seeing him as a cultured man in the relatively crude atmosphere of the Scottish nobility at that time, and defended him against some criticisms.  The leading Scottish historian [[Norman Macdougall]] published a revisionist biography of James III in which he argues that, far from being a weak king, he was actually something of a tyrant. Macdougall dismissed the "favourites of low birth" as the invention of chroniclers in the next century whose knowledge of the facts was poor.  He argues that all we can say for sure is that James had some dealings with an architect or mason called Cochrane, and the rest is later invention. Macdougall found two records of a Thomas Cochrane; one reference suggests that Cochrane was an usher of the king's chamber door, and the other that a Thomas Cochrane had forfeited the lands of [[Cousland]] near [[Dalkeith]]. Cochrane of Cousland, Macdougall concludes, may have been the usher and met his end at Lauder Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;Macdougall, (1982), 163-165 (Cousland was a source of building lime)&lt;/ref&gt; Macdougall also follows the development of the story in later writers and points particularly to [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]]'s ''History of the 5 Jameses'' for setting the final elaboration of the story. Macdougall argues that Hawthornden increased the status of Cochrane to that of an architect in order to rescue the king's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Macdougall, (1982), 288-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

This view is not universally accepted by historians. This pattern of events, a [[royal favourite]] being assassinated by jealous nobles, occurred several times in late mediaeval and early modern Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2132">'''Rudolf Sanzin''' (4 June 1874 – 2 June 1922) was an [[Austria]]n engineer and locomotive designer.

== Life ==
Rudolf Sanzin was born in [[Mürzzuschlag]], in the province of [[Styria]], Austria on 4 June 1874. His father was an official with the [[Austrian Southern Railway]] or ''Südbahn''. After completing his A levels (''[[Matura]]'') he studied at the [[Graz University of Technology]] until 1900. The following year he was himself given a job with the ''Südbahn'', but did his doctorate in 1904 at Graz (with a dissertation entitled ''Investigations into the performance of a locomotive and confirmation of the optimum loading of the same'').

His subsequent publications caught the attention of the railway ministry, with the result that [[Karl Gölsdorf]] recruited him to the ministry, where he worked as a [[design engineer]]. Later on, he became the head of the department for the design of [[electric locomotive]]s in the then ''Electrification Office''.

He obtained post-doctoral qualifications at [[Graz]] in 1906 and at the [[Vienna University of Technology]] in 1909, where he was appointed as a reader in 1919.

In addition to his career work, he was also an avid artist and produced numerous drawings and [[Watercolor painting|water colour]]s. This activity led however to his death: whilst on holiday in [[Trieste]] he died as a result of poisoning from one of his paints on 2 June 1922.

He rests in a grave in Vienna's central cemetery, no. 16B-9-25. In 1942 the Sanzingasse street in Vienna's [[Favoriten]] district was named in his honour.

'''SRT1720''' is an experimental drug that was studied by [[Sirtris Pharmaceuticals]] intended as a [[small-molecule]] [[sirtuin activator|activator]] of the [[sirtuin]] subtype [[SIRT1]].  The compound has been studied in animals, but safety and [[efficacy]] in humans have not been established.

==Animal research==
In animal models of obesity and diabetes SRT1720 was found to improve [[insulin sensitivity]] and lower [[plasma glucose]] levels in fat, muscle and liver tissue, and increase [[mitochondrial]] and [[metabolism|metabolic function]].&lt;ref name="pmid18046409"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Milne JC |author2=Lambert PD |author3=Schenk S |author4=Carney DP |author5=Smith JJ |author6=Gagne DJ |author7=Jin L |author8=Boss O |author9=Perni RB |author10=Vu CB |author11=Bemis JE |author12=Xie R |author13=Disch JS |author14=Ng PY |author15=Nunes JJ |author16=Lynch AV |author17=Yang H |author18=Galonek H |author19=Israelian K |author20=Choy W |author21=Iffland A |author22=Lavu S |author23=Medvedik O |author24=Sinclair DA |author25=Olefsky JM |author26=Jirousek MR |author27=Elliott PJ |author28=Westphal CH | title = Small molecule activators of SIRT1 as therapeutics for the treatment of type 2 diabetes | journal = Nature | volume = 450 | issue = 7170 | pages = 712–6 |date=November 2007 | pmid = 18046409 | pmc = 2753457 | doi = 10.1038/nature06261 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In mice rendered obese and diabetic by feeding a high-fat, high-sugar diet, a study performed at the National Institute of Aging found that feeding chow infused with the highest dose of SRT1720 beginning at one year of age increased mean lifespan by 18%, and maximum lifespan by 5%, as compared to other short-lived obese, diabetic mice; however, treated animals still lived substantially shorter lives than normal-weight mice fed normal chow with no drug.&lt;ref name=Minor2011&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Minor RK|author2=Baur JA|author3=Gomes AP|author4=Ward TM|author5=Csiszar A|author6=Mercken EM|author7=Abdelmohsen K|author8=Shin YK|author9=Canto C|author10=Scheibye-Knudsen M|author11=Krawczyk M|author12=Irusta PM|author13=Martín-Montalvo A|author14=Hubbard BP|author15=Zhang Y|author16=Lehrmann E|author17=White AA|author18=Price NL|author19=Swindell WR|author20=Pearson KJ|author21=Becker KG|author22=Bohr VA|author23=Gorospe M|author24=Egan JM|author25=Talan MI|author26=Auwerx J|author27=Westphal CH|author28=Ellis JL|author29=Ungvari Z|author30=Vlasuk GP|author31=Elliott PJ|author32=Sinclair DA|author33=de Cabo R|title=SRT1720 improves survival and healthspan of obese mice|journal=Scientific Reports|date=Aug 2011  |volume=1|issue=70|doi=10.1038/srep00070|pmid=22355589|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2011/110818/srep00070/full/srep00070.html|accessdate=1 March 2014|pages=70|pmc=3216557}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later study, SRT1720 increased mean lifespan of obese, diabetic mice by 21.7%, similar to the earlier study, but there was no effect on maximum lifespan in this study.&lt;ref name=Mitchell2014&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mitchell SJ |author2=Martin-Montalvo A |author3=Mercken EM |title=The SIRT1 Activator SRT1720 Extends Lifespan and Improves Health of Mice Fed a Standard Diet|journal=Cell Reports|date= Feb 2014|volume=6|issue=4|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2014.01.031|url=http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247%2814%2900065-5?script=true|accessdate=1 March 2014|pmid=24582957|pages=836–43|display-authors=etal |pmc=4010117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In normal-weight mice fed a standard rodent diet, SRT1720 increased mean lifespan by just 8.8%, and again had no effect on maximum lifespan.&lt;ref name=Mitchell2014 /&gt;

'''Sarah Lincoln Grigsby''' (February 10, 1807&amp;nbsp;– January 20, 1828) was the older sister of the [[Abraham Lincoln|16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln]], and cared for him when they were young.&lt;ref name="NPS.gov"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/libo/historyculture/sarah-lincoln-grigsby.htm National Park Service]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
Sarah Lincoln was born in [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]], to [[Thomas Lincoln]] and [[Nancy Lincoln]] in 1807. After their mother's death in 1818, Sarah was in charge of taking care of the house, her brother Abe and their cousin Dennis Hanks, who was living with them. Thomas married [[Sarah Lincoln|Sarah Bush Johnston]] in 1819, and brought her home to be a stepmother to his children.

==Marriage and family==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2018}}
In August 1826, Sarah Lincoln married [[Aaron Grigsby]] (1801–1831).  She died on January 20, 1828, while giving [[childbirth|birth]] to a [[stillbirth|stillborn]] boy, subsequently named George.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Her brother Abraham blamed the death of his sister on the failure of Grigsby to send for a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Donald | first=David Herbert | title=Lincoln | location=New York | publisher=Touchstone | year=1995 | page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried in a small cemetery next to the Little Pigeon Baptist Church, a [[Primitive Baptist Church]] attended by the Lincoln family and where her father Thomas was a [[trustee]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4795">{{distinguish|Dexter and sinister}}
'''Sinistral''' and '''dextral''', in some scientific fields, are the two types of [[chirality]] ("[[handedness]]") or [[relative direction]].

The terms are derived from the [[Latin]] words for "left" (''sinister'') and "right" (''dexter'').

Other disciplines have different terms (such as [[Dextrorotary|dextro-]] and [[Laevorotary|laevo-rotary]], in [[Chirality (chemistry)|chemistry]], or [[Clockwise#Usage|clockwise]] and [[anticlockwise]] in [[Chirality (electromagnetism)|physics]]) or simply use left and right (as in [[Anatomical terms of location#Directional terms|anatomy]]).

Relative direction and chirality are distinct concepts. Relative direction is from the point of view of the observer. A completely symmetrical object has a left and a right side, from the observer's point of view, if the top and bottom and direction of observation are defined. Chirality, however, is observer-independent: no matter how one looks at a right-hand screw thread, it remains different from a left-hand screw thread. Therefore, a symmetrical object has sinistral and dextral directions arbitrarily defined by the position of the observer, while an object that has chirality can have sinistral and dextral directions defined by characteristics of the object, no matter the position of the observer.

{{main|Fault (geology)}}  
[[Image:strike slip fault.png|thumb|218px|right|Schematic illustration of the two strike-slip fault types. The view is of the Earth's surface from above.]]
In geology the terms '''sinistral''' and '''dextral''' refer to the horizontal component of movement of blocks on either side of a [[Fault (geology)|fault]] or the sense of movement within a [[shear zone]]. These are terms of relative direction, as the movement of the blocks are described relative to each other when viewed from above. 
Movement is sinistral (left-handed) if the block on the other side of the fault moves to the left, or if straddling the fault the left side moves toward the observer.
Movement is dextral (right-handed) if the block on the other side of the fault moves to the right, or if straddling the fault the right side moves toward the observer.&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;

[[File:Pseudopleuronectes americanus.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Flatfish are asymmetrical, with both eyes lying on the same side of the head]]

===Gastropods===
{{main|Gastropod shell}}

Because the coiled shells of gastropods are asymmetrical, they possess a quality called [[chirality]], the "handedness" of an asymmetrical structure.

Over 90%
&lt;ref&gt;Schilthuizen M. &amp; Davison A. (2005). "The convoluted evolution of snail chirality". ''[[Naturwissenschaften]]'' '''92'''(11): 504–515. {{DOI|10.1007/s00114-005-0045-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
of gastropod species have '''dextral''' (right-handed) shells in their coiling.  A small minority of species and genera are almost always '''sinistral''' (left-handed).  A very few species show an even mixture of dextral and sinistral individuals (for example, ''[[Amphidromus perversus]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaxshells.org/052ddr.htm ''Amphidromus perversus'' (Linnaeus, 1758)]&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Flatfish===
{{main|Flatfish}}

The most obvious characteristic of flatfish, other than their flatness, is asymmetry because both eyes are on the same side of the head in the adult fish. In some families of flatfish, the eyes are always on the right side of the body ('''dextral''' or right-eyed flatfish), and in others, they are always on the left ('''sinistral''' or left-eyed flatfish). Primitive [[spiny turbot]]s include equal numbers of right- and left-sided individuals, and are generally more symmetrical than other families.&lt;ref name=EoF&gt;{{cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R. |editor2=Eschmeyer, W.N.|author1=Chapleau, Francois  |author2=Amaoka, Kunio |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= xxx|isbn= 0-12-547665-5 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sipho Jele''' was a member of the banned Swazi political party [[People's United Democratic Movement]] (Pudemo) as well as the Swaziland Agricultural and Plantations Workers Union (SAPWU), part of the [[Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions]] (SFTU). He died in police custody in [[Swaziland]], after having been arrested on 1 May 2010, at the SFTU [[May Day]] celebrations, for having worn a T-shirt with a Pudemo logo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuc.org.uk/international-issues/countries/human-rights/union-rights/tuc-protests-suspicious-death-swazi-trade TUC protests at suspicious death of Swazi trade unionist Sipho Jele], ´Tuc.org.uk'', 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arbejderen.dk"&gt;{{cite web |author=/af |url=http://www.arbejderen.dk/artikel/2010-05-10/dr-bt-p-grund-af-en-t-shirt |title=DrĂŚbt pĂĽ grund af en T-shirt |publisher=Arbejderen.dk |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930163532/http://www.arbejderen.dk/artikel/2010-05-10/dr-bt-p-grund-af-en-t-shirt |archivedate=30 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sowetan.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=1139058], ''Sowetan.co.sz'' {{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sipho Jele was found hanging from the rafters of a toilet at the Sidvwashini Correctional facility where he was being held on 4 May.

==Murder case==
Sipho Jele was a former employee at Swaziland's only [[pulp mill]], and was studying engineering at the time of his death. He had been charged with [[high treason]] in a high-profile trial in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4570004.stm |title=Treason charges for Swazi attacks |publisher=BBC News  |date=30 December 2005 |accessdate=7 April 2018}}{{Notinsourcegiven|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78760.htm |title=Swaziland |publisher=State.gov |date=6 March 2007 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}{{Notinsourcegiven|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; accused of taking part in a bombing campaign, but was acquitted along with all the other accused.

According to Sipho Jele's aunt, who had previously worked as a nurse for 30 years and who saw the body, there were several indications that he had not committed suicide as claimed by the Swazi police, including a swollen face, blood having come out of his nostrils, and the fact that he hadn't soiled himself – as is commonly the case with those who have hanged themselves. The police officers in whose custody Jele was claimed they didn't kill him, although they admitted to have broken protocol on several accounts when arresting and detaining Jele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.observer.org.sz/index.php?news=13408 |title=The Swazi Observer |publisher=Observer.org.sz |date=19 May 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swazi regime has been much criticised in relation to Jele's death especially by Swazi democracy organisations, foreign unions such as [[Cosatu]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosatu.org.za/show.php?include=docs/pr/2010/pr0506a.html&amp;ID=3283&amp;cat=COSATU%20Today] {{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and South African,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2010-05-14-international-outcry-over-swazi-activists-death-in-detention |title=International outcry over Swazi activist's death in detention – News – Mail &amp; Guardian Online |publisher=Mg.co.za |date=14 May 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; American&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Clottey |url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Swaziland-Opposition-Demands-Supporters-Death-Inquiry--94000439.html |title=Swaziland Opposition Demands Supporter’s Death Inquiry |publisher=Voanews.com |date=17 May 2010 |accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Danish newspapers&lt;ref name="arbejderen.dk"/&gt; and websites, as well as NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ituc-csi.org/swaziland-trade-unionist-dies-in.html |title=Swaziland: Trade Unionist Dies in Custody|publisher=Ituc-csi.org |date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/36080 |title=afrol News – Swazi trade unionist "killed" in custody |publisher=Afrol.com |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent investigation into the cause of the death was promised on 7 May by the [[Prime Minister of Swaziland]].&lt;ref name="times.co.sz"&gt;[http://www.times.co.sz/index.php?news=16388 Corruption is the key to success in SD], ''Times.co.sz'', 25 June 2010  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714182928/http://www.times.co.sz/index.php?news=16388 |date=14 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to evidence given by Manzini-based police officers at this inquest, Sipho Jele was taken out of his cell to be interrogated for hours, although the evidence given by police officers and jailers was conflicting on several points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.times.co.sz/index.php?news=16708 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180431/http://www.times.co.sz/index.php?news=16708 |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}  &lt;/ref&gt; The director of public prosecutions, [[Mumcy Dlamini]], testified at the same trial that Jele had told him he feared being «tubed», i.e. assaulted and suffocated, by police and therefore had asked Dlamini to be transferred to Sidvwashini.

==Funerals==
Sipho Jele's funeral was disrupted by around 500 heavily armed police. The police destroyed several pictures of Jele, as well as removing a Pudemo flag from the coffin, and then arrested and detain several of the mourners. The funeral was subsequently called off by Jele's family for fear of further arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afrika.dk/swazi-police-disrupt-funeral-sipho-jele |title=Swazi police disrupt funeral of Sipho Jele |publisher=Afrika.dk |date=14 May 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806233314/http://www.afrika.dk/swazi-police-disrupt-funeral-sipho-jele |archivedate=6 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral finally took place on 22 May, this time with a strict dress code banning any politically motivated attire or political speeches, although some of those attending disregarded this.

{{Psychology sidebar}}

The '''Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R)''' is a psychological [[self-report]] [[questionnaire]] designed to identify risk factors for [[suicide]] in children and adolescents between ages 13 and 18. The four-question test is filled out by the child and takes approximately five minutes to complete. The questionnaire has been found to be [[Reliability (psychometrics)|reliable]] and [[Test validity|valid]] in recent studies.&lt;ref name=OsmanEtAl2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Range&amp;Antonelli1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=CottonEtAl1995/&gt; One study demonstrated that the SBQ-R had high [[internal consistency]] with a sample of university students.&lt;ref name=OsmanEtAl2001/&gt; However, another body of research, which evaluated some of the most commonly used tools for assessing suicidal thoughts and behaviors in college-aged students, found that the SBQ-R and suicide assessment tools in general have very little overlap between them.&lt;ref name=Range&amp;Antonelli1990/&gt; One of the greatest strengths of the SBQ-R is that, unlike some other tools commonly used for suicidality assessment, it asks about future anticipation of suicidal thoughts or behaviors as well as past and present ones and includes a question about lifetime suicidal ideation, plans to commit suicide, and actual attempts.&lt;ref name=Range1993/&gt;

== Question breakdown, scoring, and interpretation ==

Each of the four questions addresses a specific risk factor: the first concerns presence of suicidal thoughts and attempts, the second concerns frequency of suicidal thoughts, the third concerns the threat level of suicidal attempts, and the fourth concerns likelihood of future suicidal attempts. The first item has often been used on its own in order to assign individuals to a suicidal and a non-suicidal control group for studies.&lt;ref name=OsmanEtAl2001/&gt; Each question has an individual scale, and each response corresponds to a certain point value.

=== Domain breakdown ===
A maximum score of 18 is possible on the SBQ-R, and the following responses to the 4 questions correspond to the following point values:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! Point value !! Question 1 response !! Question 2 response !! Question 3 response !! Question 4 response
|-
|{{rh|align=center}}| 0 || {{sdash}} || {{sdash}} || {{sdash}} || "never"
|-
|{{rh|align=center}}| 1 || 1 || "never" || 1 || "no chance at all"
|-
|{{rh|align=center}}| 2 || 2, 3a, or 3b || "rarely" || 2a or 2b || "rather unlikely"
|-
|{{rh|align=center}}| 3 || {{sdash}} || "sometimes" || 3a or 3b || "unlikely"
|-
|{{rh|align=center}}| 4 || 4a or 4b || "often" || {{sdash}} || "likely"
|-
|{{rh|align=center}}| 5 || {{sdash}} || "very often" || {{sdash}} || "rather likely"
|-
|{{rh|align=center}}| 6 || {{sdash}} || {{sdash}} || {{sdash}} || "very likely"
|}

=== Interpretation of subscale scores===

A total score of 7 and higher in the general population and a total score of 8 and higher in patients with psychiatric disorders indicates significant risk of suicidal behavior.&lt;ref name=ShakeriEtAl2015/&gt;

'''TL 9000''' is a quality management practice designed by the '''QuEST Forum''' in 1998.  It was created to focus on [[supply chain]] directives throughout the international [[telecommunications industry]], including the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = TL 9000 | publisher = QuEST Forum | url = http://www.tl9000.org/ | accessdate = 2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with [[ISO/TS 16949]] for the automotive industry and [[AS9000]] for the aerospace industry, TL 9000 specializes the generic [[ISO 9001]] to meet the needs of one industrial sector, which for TL 9000 is the [[information and communications technology]] (ICT)—extending from [[service provider]]s through ICT equipment manufacturers through the [[Distributor (business)|supplier]]s and [[General contractor|contractor]]s and [[subcontractor]]s that provide [[electronic component]]s and [[software component]]s to those ICT equipment manufacturers.

TL 9000 is defined by two documents:
* TL 9000 Requirements Handbook, at release 5.5, which includes the full text of ISO 9001:2008
* TL 9000 Measurements Handbook, at release 5.0
Reports on defect tracking and other measurements at various levels of granularity are accumulated by TL 9000 compliant facilities of certified organizations by the [[University of Texas at Dallas]], which is the official TL 9000 administrator.  These reports are provided at no additional charge to TL 9000 member companies and for an additional fee to TL 9000 Liaison members and non-members.  Generally, these measurement data permit a service provider to compare the defect rates among various equipment manufacturers and against each other.

"'''The Greatest Story Ever Told'''" is the [[series finale]] of the animated television series ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' (under the alternative title, ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force Forever''). It is the ninth episode of the [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force Forever|eleventh season]] and the 139th episode of the series overall. In the episode [[Frylock]] and [[Carl Brutananadilewski|Carl]] become [[Immortality|immortal]] after using  special "Ceaseless" [[shampoo]], while [[Master Shake]] and [[Meatwad]] seek immortality through [[religion]].

Series creators were not made aware of the cancellation of the series until half way through the final season –  regardless, they were still able to make a finale that they felt "does justice" to the show. The episode immediately preceding this one, "The Last One Forever and Ever (For Real This Time) (We Fucking Mean It)", was falsely promoted as the series finale and aired on August 23, 2015. "The Greatest Story Ever Told" was then quietly released online on August 26, 2015 as a hidden [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] on the [[Adult Swim]] website. It later made its television debut in the United States on [[Cartoon Network|Cartoon Network's]] late night programming block Adult Swim on August 30, 2015, with very little promotion and was listed as a rerun of "[[Rabbot]]" on most television listings. This episode has received positive reception and its television debut was the second highest-rated episode from the season. This episode has been made available for digital purchase.

==Plot==
[[Master Shake]] and [[Meatwad]] are watching a video of Shake photobombing clams from the previous weekend on television. Shake turns off the television and announces that he is, in fact, [[Immortality|immortal]]. He then proceeds to pull out a book called "The Bibble" which he refers to as the [[Bible]]. Shake becomes angered when Meatwad corrects him on his error and demands he kneel down and pray to the "Almighty Jimmy", as part of his [[religion]]. [[Frylock]] enters the room and questions Shake's religion, which promises immortality. Shake states that Frylock isn't eligible for his religion or immortality, before leaving the house with Meatwad. Frylock denounces immortality, before cutting to him washing his fries in [[Carl Brutananadilewski|Carl's]] pool with a bottle of "Ceaseless" [[shampoo]].

While Frylock is in the pool Carl comes to question him. Carl picks up the shampoo bottle and reads the label explaining that it gives the user immortality. Carl steals the bottle from Frylock and washes his own hair in his house against Frylock's wishes. Soon after [[Christopher Lambert]] abruptly enters Carl's house and explains that Frylock, Carl, and himself are all immortal. To prove this Lambert allows Carl to [[Decapitation|decapitate]] him on video. After Lambert successfully [[Resurrection|comes back to life]] after decapitation the three of them decide to make a [[Viral video|viral internet video]] of themselves repeatedly committing [[suicide]] in different ways.

Meanwhile, Shake and Meatwad are seen in a church [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters|alongside eleven other characters from the series]], in an homage to ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]''. Shake is dressed up as [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] and is severing [[Blessed Sacrament|his organs and blood for consumption]]. Frylock, Carl, and Lambert have entered the church and show their video to Meatwad, explaining to him that it is real. Shake in a paranoid state commands everyone in the church to shoot at Frylock, Carl and Lambert. Everyone in the church complies but are not successful due to the fact that the three of them being immortal. Two policemen enter the church and begin shooting several patrons to death, including Shake.

After the shooting Frylock and Carl take Lambert to see a magic show by Unbelievable Ron, to help alleviate his boredom, which he had been expressing throughout the episode. During Ron's performance he accidentally kills his assistant by [[Sawing a woman in half|cutting her in half]]. Ron uses his powers to turn witnesses in the audience into birds, including Lambert. During the commotion the two police officers return and arrest Frylock and Carl for the murder of Lambert. 35 years in the future Meatwad is visiting Frylock in prison. Frylock explains that Meatwad needs to track down Lambert (in the form of five white birds) to get him and Carl [[Exoneration|exonerated]]. Meatwad responds by pulling out a bucket of fried chicken, which annoys Frylock. As the on-screen [[closing credits]] start, Frylock explains that Meatwad can use the remaining shampoo to become immortal himself. Meatwad asks if they would be on TV forever and Frylock confidently answers yes, before the screen abruptly cuts to the [[Williams Street]] production card.

The [[fourth wall]] is broken in the [[post-credits scene]] were the Aqua Teens are seen in their living room with Carl watching the episode itself on television. Shake, Carl and Frylock each express disappointment in the episode. Meatwad optimistically suggests doing another joke in the show's final seconds, before the screen abruptly cuts to a message stating the episode was made in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (which was used throughout the eleventh season and regularly in other productions made in Georgia), ending the series.

==Production==
"The Greatest Story Ever Told" was written and directed by series creators [[Dave Willis]] and [[Matt Maiellaro]] who wrote and directed every episode of the series.&lt;ref name=Credits&gt;Credits found at the end of ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force Forever'' episode "The Greatest Story Ever Told".&lt;/ref&gt; This is the [[Series finale|final episode]] of ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force''.

In 2015, the series was cancelled by Adult Swim after 15 years, against the wishes of Willis and Maiellaro, who would have preferred to have the series continue. Willis and Maiellaro were first told about the cancellation by people from the animation studio.&lt;ref name=Paste&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Garrett|title=The Life and Death of Aqua Teen Hunger Force|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/06/aqua-teen-hunger-force-forever.html|publisher=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time they were told about the cancellation they were already done producing about half of the episodes from the final season. Regardless of the timing of the news Wills stated they were still able to produce this finale, that Willis says "does justice to the series" and is "worthy of the show".&lt;ref name=Vice&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butler|first1=Blake|title=‘Aqua Teen Hunger Force Forever’ Is the End of an Era, but Its Creators Didn't Want It to End|url=https://www.vice.com/read/aqua-teen-hunger-force-forever-is-the-end-of-an-era-111|publisher=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Adult Swim was asked why they don't make more episodes, to which they responded "we might" with a bump.&lt;ref name="2017bump"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schwarz |first1=John |title=Is Adult Swim Teasing An "Aqua Teen" Revival? |url=https://www.bubbleblabber.com/is-adult-swim-teasing-an-aqua-teen-revival/ |publisher=Bubble Babbler |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willis also expressed interest in doing a [[Kickstarter]] to fund ''Death Fighter'', a scrapped sequel to ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3a3itv/i_am_dave_willis_cocreator_of_aqua_teen_hunger/cs913g9#cs913g9 Statement made by Dave Willis on June 16, 2015] on [[Reddit]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Johnson of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' said that the episode was "fairly funny" and was disappointed that Master Shake died in the shootout.

'''''The Story of My Experiments with Truth''''' is the autobiography of [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas K. Gandhi]], covering his life from early childhood through to 1921. It was written in weekly instalments and published in his journal ''Navjivan'' from 1925 to 1929. Its English translation also appeared in installments in his other journal ''[[Young India]]''.&lt;ref name="Richard" /&gt; It was initiated at the insistence of [[Swami Anand]] and other close co-workers of Gandhi, who encouraged him to explain the background of his public campaigns. In 1999, the book was designated as one of the "100 Best Spiritual Books of the 20th Century" by a committee of global spiritual and religious authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/enter/books/book372.htm |title=Spiritual books of the century | work=USA Today | date=2 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==

=== Translator's preface ===
This section is written by [[Mahadev Desai]] who translated the book from [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] to English in 1940. In this preface Desai notes that the book was originally published in two volumes, the first in 1927 and second in 1929. He also mentions that the original was priced at {{INRConvert|1}} and had a run of five editions by the time of the writing of his preface. 50,000 copies had been sold in Gujarati but since the English edition was expensive it prevented Indians from purchasing it. Desai notes the need to bring out a cheaper English version. He also mentions that the translation has been revised by an English scholar who did not want his name to be published. Chapters XXIX-XLIII of Part V were translated by Desai's friend and colleague Pyarelal.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|last=Desai|first=M. K. Gandhi.

=== Introduction ===
The introduction is written by Gandhi himself mentioning how he has resumed writing his autobiography at the insistence of Jeramdas, a fellow prisoner in [[Yerwada Central Jail]] with him. He mulls over the question a friend asked him about writing an autobiography, deeming it a Western practice, something "nobody does in the east".&lt;ref name=Richard&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=edited by Richard L.|title=Gandhi's experiments with truth : essential writings by and about Mahatma Gandhi|year=2006|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-7391-1143-7|pages=388|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dRQcKsx-YgQC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi himself agrees that his thoughts might change later in life  but the purpose of his story is just to narrate his experiments with truth in life.&lt;ref name=book /&gt; He also says that through this book he wishes to narrate his spiritual and moral experiments rather than political.

=== Part I ===
The first part narrates incidents of Gandhi's childhood, his experiments with eating meat, smoking, drinking, stealing and subsequent atonement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Men of Turmoil – Biographies by Leading Authorities of the Dominating Personalities of Our Day|year=2007|publisher=Hesperides Press|isbn=1-4067-3625-2|pages=384|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MT8pbR2r4rAC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two texts that had a lasting influence on Gandhi, both of which he read in childhood. He records the profound impact of the play ''[[Harishchandra]]'' and says,"I read it with intense interest...It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Post|first=Pitirim A.

Gandhi got married at the age of 13.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; In his words, "It is my painful duty to have to record here my marriage at the age of thirteen...I can see no moral argument in support of such a preposterously early marriage." Another important event documented in this part is the demise of Gandhi's father Karamchand Gandhi. Gandhi wrote the book to deal with his experiment for truth. His disdain for physical training at school, particularly gymnastics has also been written about in this part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudolph|first=Susanne Hoeber|title=Gandhi : the traditional roots of charisma|year=1983|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-73136-0|pages=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3Ac_HEZkcMC&amp;dq=|edition=[Pbk. ed.].|author2=R, Lloyd I. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part II ===
After a long history of antagonism, the British and the Dutch shared power in South Africa, with Britain ruling the regions of Natal and Cape Colony, while the Dutch settlers known as the Boers taking charge in the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, two independent republics. The white settler and the independent Boer states continued to engage in volatile interactions with the British, so a threat of violent eruptions always loomed large. In order to placate both the Boer and other white settlers, the British adopted a number of racist policies, and while the Indians, most of them working on sugar and coffee plantations, did not suffer as much as the black population, they clearly experienced a treatment as second-class citizens. The initial story of Gandhi’s travails in South Africa and of his systematic struggle against oppression is well known. Gandhi repeatedly experienced the sting of humiliation during his long African sojourn. The incident at Maritzburg, where Gandhi was thrown off the train has become justly famous. When Gandhi, as a matter of principle, refused to leave the first class compartment, he was thrown off the train.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nujslawreview.org/pdf/articles/2013_2/04_arvind_narrain.pdf"|title = ""MY EXPERIMENTS WITH LAW": GANDHI’S EXPLORATION OF LAW’S POTENTIAL|last = Narrain|first = Arvind|date = April 1, 2013|journal = NUJS Law Review|access-date = January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Gandhi also had difficulty being admitted to hotels, and saw that his fellow-Indians, who were mostly manual laborers, experienced even more unjust treatment.

Very soon after his arrival, Gandhi's initial bafflement and indignation at racist policies turned into a growing sense of outrage and propelled him into assuming a position as a public figure at the assembly of Transvaal Indians, where he delivered his first speech urging Indians not to accept inequality but instead to unite, work hard, learn English and observe clean living habits. Although Gandhi's legal work soon start to keep him busy, he found time to read some of Tolstoy's work, which greatly influenced his understanding of peace and justice and eventually inspired him to write to Tolstoy, setting the beginning of a prolific correspondence. Both Tolstoy and Gandhi shared a philosophy of non-violence and Tolstoy's harsh critique of human society resonated with Gandhi's outrage at racism in South Africa.

Both Tolstoy and Gandhi considered themselves followers of the [[Sermon on the Mount]] from the New Testament, in which Jesus Christ expressed the idea of complete self-denial for the sake of his fellow men. Gandhi also continued to seek moral guidance in the Bhagavad-Gita, which inspired him to view his work not as self-denial at all, but as a higher form of self-fulfillment. Adopting a philosophy of selflessness even as a public man, Gandhi refused to accept any payment for his work on behalf of the Indian population, preferring to support himself with his law practice alone.

But Gandhi's personal quest to define his own philosophy with respect to religion did not rely solely on sacred texts. At the time, he also engaged in active correspondence with a highly educated and spiritual Jain from Bombay, his friend Raychandra, who was deeply religious, yet well versed in a number of topics, from Hinduism to Christianity. The more Gandhi communicated with Raychandra, the more deeply he began to appreciate Hinduism as a non violent faith and its related scriptures. Yet, such deep appreciation also gave birth to a desire to seek inner purity and illumination, without solely relying on external sources, or on the dogma within every faith. Thus, although Gandhi sought God within his own tradition, he espoused the idea that other faiths remained worthy of study and contained their own truths.

Not surprisingly, even after his work assignment concluded, Gandhi soon found a reason to remain in South Africa. This pivotal reason involved the "Indian Franchise Bill", with which the Natal legislature intended to deprive Indians of the right to vote. No opposition existed against this bill, except among some of Gandhi's friends who asked him to stay in South Africa and work with them against this new injustice against Indians, who white South Africans disparagingly called "coolies." He found that racist attitudes had become deeply entrenched, especially in the Dutch-ruled regions, where they lived in the worst urban slums and could not own property or manage agricultural land. Even in Natal, where Indians had more influence, they were not allowed to go out after 9 p.m. without a pass, while in Cape Colony, another British territory, they were not allowed to walk on the sidewalk. The new bill which prohibited Indians from voting in Natal only codified existing injustice in writing.

Although a last-minute petition drive failed to the Indian Franchise Bill from passing, Gandhi remained active and organized a much larger petition, which he sent to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in London, and distributed to the press in South Africa, Britain and India. The petition raised awareness of the plight of Indians and generating discussions in all three continents to the point where both the Times of London and the Times of India published editorials in support of the Indian right to the vote. Gandhi also formed a new political organization called the Natal Indian Congress (a clear reference to the Indian National Congress), which held regular meetings and soon, after some struggles with financing, started its own library and debating society. They also issued two major pamphlets, An Appeal to Every Briton in South Africa, and The Indian Franchise–An Appeal, which offered a logical argument against racial discrimination. He was also thrown of the Train when he didn't agree to move from his first class seat which he paid for.

Though, at first, Gandhi intended to remain in South Africa for a month, or a year at most, he ended up working in South Africa for about twenty years. After his initial assignment was over, he succeeded in growing his own practice to about twenty Indian merchants who contracted manage their affairs. This work allowed him to both earn a living while also finding time to devote to his mission as a public figure. During his struggle against inequality and racial discrimination in South Africa, Gandhi became known among Indians all around the world as "Mahatma," or "Great Soul."

In South Africa with the Family, the Boer War, Bombay and South Africa Again.

In 1896, Gandhi made a brief return to India and returned with his wife and children. In India, he published another pamphlet, known as the Green Pamphlet, on the plight of Indians in South Africa. For the first time, Gandhi realized that Indians had come to admire his work greatly and experienced a taste of his own popularity among the people, when he visited Madras, an Indian province, where most manual laborers had originated. Although his fellow-Indians greeted him in large crowds with applause and adulation, he sailed back to South Africa with his family in December 1896.

Gandhi had become very well known in South Africa as well, to the point where a crowd of rioters awaited him at Port Natal, determined that he should not be allowed to enter. Many of them also mistakenly believed that all the dark-skinned passenger on the ship that took Gandhi to Natal were poor Indian immigrants he had decided to bring along with him, when, in reality, these passengers were mostly returning Indian residents of Natal. Fortunately, Gandhi was able to establish a friendly relationship with the British in South Africa so the Natal port's police superintendent and his wife escorted him to safety. After this incident, local white residents began to actually regard him with greater respect.

As Gandhi resumed his work at the Natal Indian Congress, his loyalty to the British guided him to assist them in the Boer War, which started three years later. Because Gandhi remained a passionate pacifist, he wanted to participate in the Boer War without actually engaging in violence so he organized and led an Indian Medical Corps which served the British in a number of battles, including the important battle of '''Spion Kop in January 1900.'''

At the time, Gandhi believed that the British Empire shared the values of liberty and equality that he himself embraced and that, by virtue of defending those principles, the British constitution deserved the loyalty of all British subjects, including Indians. He viewed racist policy in South Africa as a temporary characteristic aberration, rather than a permanent tendency. With respect to the British in India, at this point in his life, Gandhi considered their rule beneficial and benevolent.

The armed conflict between the British and Dutch raged on for over three years of often brutal fighting with the British conquering the Transvaal and Orange Free state territories. Gandhi expected that the British victory would establish justice in South Africa and present him with an opportunity to return to India. He wanted to attend the 1901 meeting of the Indian National Congress, whose mission was to provide a social and political forum for the Indian upper class. Founded in 1885 by the British, the Congress had no real political power and expressed pro-British positions. Gandhi wanted to attend its meeting nevertheless, as he was hoping to pass a resolution in support of the Indian population in South Africa. Before he left for Bombay, Gandhi promised the Natal Indian Congress that he would return to support their efforts, should they need his help.

As Gandhi attended the 1901 Indian National Congress, his hopes came true. G.K. Gokhale, one of the most prominent Indian politicians of the time, supported the resolution for the rights of Indians in South Africa and the resolution passed. Through Gokhale, in whose house Gandhi stayed for a month, Gandhi met many political connections that would serve him later in life.

However, his promise to always aid his friends in Natal soon prompted him to return to South Africa, when he received an urgent telegram informing him that the British and Boers had now formed a peaceful relationship and often acted together to the detriment of the Indian population, as Britain was planning to live local white individuals in power in South Africa, much like it had done in Canada and Australia.

Gandhi travelled back to South Africa immediately and met with Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the Colonies, and presented him with a paper on the injustice against the Indian population but Chamberlain indicated that the Indians would have to obey the new rulers of South Africa, now called the "Afrikaners," which included both Dutch and British local settlers.

Gandhi began to organize a fast response to this new South African political configuration. Instead of working in Natal, he now established a camp in the newly conquered Transvaal region and began helping Indians who had escaped from the war in that region, and now had to purchase overly expensive re-entry passes. He also represented poor Indians whose dwellings in a shantytown the authorities had dispossessed. Gandhi also started a new magazine, Indian Opinion, that advocated for political liberty and equal rights in South Africa. The magazine, which initially included several young women from Europe, expanded its staff around the country, increasing both Gandhi's popularity and the public support for his ideas.

At round same time, Gandhi read John Ruskin's book ''[[Unto This Last]]'', which maintained that the life of manual labor was superior to all other ways of living. As he adopted this belief, Gandhi chose to abandon Western dress and habits, and he moved his family and staff to a Transvaal farm called the Phoenix, where he even gave renounced the use of an oil-powered engine and printed ''[[Indian Opinion]]'' by hand-wheel, and performed agriculture labor using old, manual farming equipment. He began to conceive of his public work as a mission to restore old Indian virtue and civilization, rather than fall prey to modern Western influence, which included electricity and technology.

Between 1901 and 1906, he also changed another aspect of his personal life by achieving Brahmacharya, or the voluntary abstention from sexual relations. He made this choice as part of his philosophy of selflessness and self-restraint. Finally, he also formulated his own philosophy of political protest, called Satyagraha, which literally meant "truth-force" in Sanskrit. In practice, this practice meant protesting injustice steadfastly, but in a non-violent manner.

He put this theory into practice on September 8, 1906, when, at a large gathering of the Indian community in Transvaal, he asked the whole community to take a vow of disobedience to the law, as the Transvaal government had started an effort to register every Indian child over the age of eight, which would make them an official part of the South African population.

Setting a personal example, Gandhi became the first Indian to appear before a magistrate for his refusal to register, and he was sentenced to two months in prison. He actually asked for a heavier sentence, a request, consistent with his philosophy of self-denial. After his release, Gandhi continued his campaign and thousands of Indians burned their registration cards, crossing the Transvaal-Natal border without passes. Many went to jail, including Gandhi, who went to jail again in 1908.

Gandhi did not waiver when a South African General by the name of Jan Christiaan Smuts promised to eliminate the registration law, but broke his word. Gandhi went all the way to London in 1909 and gathered enough support among the British to convince Smuts to eliminate the law in 1913. Yet, the Transvaal Prime Minister continued to regard Indians as second-class citizens while the Cape Colony government passed another discriminatory law making all non-Christian marriages illegal, which meant that all Indian children would be considered born out of wedlock. In addition, the government in Natal continued to impose crippling poll tax for entering Natal only upon Indians.

In response to these strikingly unjust rules, Gandhi organized a large-scale satyagraha, which involved women crossing the Natal-Transvaal border illegally. When they were arrested, five thousand Indian coal miners also went on strike and Gandhi himself led them across the Natalese border, where they expected arrest.

Although Smuts and Gandhi did not agree on many points, they had respect for each other. In 1913, Smuts relented due to the sheer number of Indians involved in protest and negotiated a settlement which provided for the legality of Indian marriages and abolished the poll tax. Further, the import of indentured laborers from India was to be phased out by 1920. In July 1914, Gandhi sailed for Britain, now admired as "Mahatma," and known throughout the world for the success of satyagraha.

=== Part IV ===
Part IV. Mahatma in the Midst of World Turmoil

Gandhi was in England when World War I started and he immediately began organizing a medical corps similar to the force he had led in the Boer War, but he also faced health problems that caused him to return to India, where he met the applauding crowds with enthusiasm once again. Indians continued to refer to him as "Mahatma" or "Great Soul," an appellation reserved only for the holiest men of Hinduism. While Gandhi accepted the love and admiration of the crowds, he also insisted that all souls were equal and did not accept the implication of religious sacredness that his new name carried.

In order to retreat into a life of humility and restraint, as his personal principles mandated, he decided to withdraw from public life for a while spending his first year in India focusing on his personal quest for purity and healing. He also lived in a communal space with untouchables, a choice which many of his financial supporters resented, because they believed that the very presence of untouchables defiled higher-caste Indians. Gandhi even considered moving to a district in Ahmedabad inhabited entirely by the untouchables when a generous Muslim merchant donated enough money to keep up his current living space for another year. By that time, Gandhi's communal life with the untouchables had become more acceptable.

Although Gandhi had withdrawn from public life, he briefly met with the British Governor of Bombay (and future Viceroy of India), Lord Willington, whom Gandhi promised to consult before he launched any political campaigns. Gandhi also felt the impact of another event, the passing of G.K. Gokhale, who had become his supporter and political mentor. He stayed away from the political trend of Indian nationalism, which many of the members of the Indian National Congress embraced. Instead, he stayed busy resettling his family and the inhabitants of the [[Phoenix Settlement]] in South Africa, as well as the Tolstoy Settlement he had founded near Johannesburg. For this purpose, on May 25, 1915, he created a new settlement, which came to be known as the Satyagraha ashram ( derive from Sanskrit word "Satya" means "truth" ) near the town of Ahmedabad and close to his place of birth in the western Indian province of Gujarati. All the inhabitants of the ashram, which included one family of untouchables, swore to poverty and chastity.

After a while, Gandhi became influenced by the idea of Indian independence from the British, but he dreaded the possibility that a westernized Indian elite would replace the British government. He developed a strong conviction that Indian independence should take place as a large-scale sociopolitical reform, which would remove the old plagues of extreme poverty and caste restrictions. In fact, he believed that Indians could not become worthy of self-government unless they all shared a concern for the poor.

As Gandhi resumed his public life in India in 1916, he delivered a speech at the opening of the new Hindu University in the city of Benares, where he discussed his understanding of independence and reform. He also provided specific examples of the abhorrent living conditions of the lower classes that he had observed during his travels around India and focused specifically on sanitation.

Although the Indians of the higher-castes did not readily embrace the ideas in the speech, Gandhi had now returned to public life and he felt ready to convert these ideas to actions. Facing the possibility of arrest, just like he always did in South Africa, Gandhi first spoke for the rights of impoverished indigo-cultivators in the Champaran district. His efforts eventually led to the appointment of a government commission to investigate abuses by the indigo planters.

He also interefered whenever he saw violence. When a group of Ahmedabad mill workers went on strike and became violent, he resolved to fast until they returned to peace. Though some political commentators condemned Gandhi's behavior as a form of blackmail, the fast only lasted three days before the workers and their employers negotiated an agreement. Through this situation, Gandhi discovered the fast as one of his most effective weapons in late years and set a precedent for later action as part of satyagraha.

As the First World War continued, Gandhi also became involved in recruiting men for the British Army, an involvement which his followers had a difficult time accepting, after listening to his passionate speeches about resisting injustice in a non-violent manner. Not surprisingly, at this point, although Gandhi still remained loyal to Britain and enamored with the ideals of the British constitution, his desire to support and independent home rule became stronger. As time passed, Gandhi became exhausted from his long journey around the country and fell ill with dysentery. He refused conventional treatment and chose to practice his own healing methods, relying on diet and spending a long time bedridden, while in recovery in his ashram.

In the meantime, India’s unrest was overwhelming at the prospect of the British destroying the world's only Muslim power, the Ottoman Empire. While the British alleged that they fought to protect the rights of small states and independent peoples from tyranny, in India, an increasing number of people found this alleged commitment less than genuine.

After the end of the war, the British government decided to follow the recommendations of the Rowlatt Committee, which advocated the retention of various wartime restrictions in India, including curfews and measures to suppress free speech. Gandhi was still sick when these events took place and, although he could not protest actively, he felt his loyalty to the British Empire weaken significantly.

Later, when the Rowlatt Act actually became law, Gandhi proposed that the entire country observe a day of prayer, fasting, and abstention from physical labor as a peaceful protest against the injustice of the oppressive law. Gandhi's plea generated an overwhelming response as millions of Indians did not go to work on April 6, 1919.

As the entire country stood still, the British arrested Gandhi, which provoked angry crowds to fill the streets of India's cities and, much to Gandhi's dislike, violence erupted everywhere. Gandhi could not tolerate violence so he called off his campaign and asked that everyone return to their homes. He acted in accordance with his firm belief that if satyagraha could not be carried out without violence, it should not take place at all.

Unfortunately, not all protesters shared Gandhi's conviction as ardently. In Amritsar, capital of the region known as the Punjab, where the alarmed British authorities had deported the local Hindu and Muslim members of the Congress, the street mobs became very violent and the British summoned Brigadier-General Reginald E.H. Dyer to restore order. Dyer prohibited all public meetings and instituted public whippings for Indians who approached British policemen. Despite these new regulations, a crowd of over ten thousand protesters gathered in the center of Armitsar, and Dyer responded with bringing his troops there and opening fire without warning. Tightly packed together, the protesters had nowhere to run from the fire, even when they threw themselves down on the ground the fire was then directed on the ground, ceasing only when the British troops no longer had ammunition. Hundreds died and many more were wounded.

This unfortunate occurrence became known as the Amritsar Massacre, it outraged the British public almost as much as Indian society. The authorities in London eventually condemned Dyer's conduct, forcing him to resign in disgrace. The effect the massacre had on Indian society became even more profound as more moderate politicians, like Gandhi, now began to wholeheartedly support the idea of Indian independence, creating an intense climate of mutual hostility. After the massacre, Gandhi eventually obtained permission to travel to Amritsar and conduct his own investigation. He produced a report months later and his work on the report motivated him to contact a number of Indian politicians, who advocated for the idea of independence from British rule.

After Amritsar, Gandhi attended the Muslim Conference being held in Delhi, where Indian Muslims discussed their fears that the British would suppress Caliphs of Turkey. Muslims considered the Caliphs as heirs of Mohammed and spiritual heads of Islam. While the British considered such suppression a necessary effort to restore order after World War I, the Muslim populations viewed it as slap in the face. Gandhi urged them not to accept the actions of the British. He proposed a boycott of British goods, and stated that if the British continued to insist on the elimination of the Caliphate, Indian Muslims should take even more drastic measures of non-cooperation, involving areas such as government employment and taxes.

During the months that followed, Gandhi continued to advocate for peace and caution, however, since Britain and Turkey were still negotiating their peace terms. Unlike more nationalistic politicians, he also supported the [[Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms|Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms]] for India, as they laid the foundation for constitutional self-government. Eventually, other politicians who thought the reforms did not go far enough had to agree with Gandhi simply because his popularity and influence had become so great that the Congress could accomplish little without him.

As the British remained determined to put an end to the Muslim Caliphate, they enforced the [[Rowlatt Act]] resolutely. Even Gandhi became less tolerant towards British practices and in April 1920, he urged all Indians, Muslim and Hindu, to begin a "non-cooperation" protest against the British rule by giving up their Western clothing and British jobs. As a personal example, on August 1, he returned the kasar-i-hind medal that he had received for providing medical service to the Boer War's wounded British army  in South Africa. He also became the first president of the Home Rule League, a largely symbolic position which confirmed his position as an advocate for Indian Independence.

In September 1920, Gandhi also passed an official constitution for the Congress, which created a system of two national committees and numerous local units, all working to mobilize a spirit of non-cooperation across India. Gandhi and other volunteers traveled around India further establishing this new grass roots organization, which achieved great success. The new British Viceory in India, Lord Reading, did not dare to interfere because of Gandhi's immense popularity.

By 1922, Gandhi decided that the initiative of non-cooperation had to transform into open civil disobedience, but in March 1922, Lord Reading finally ordered Gandhi's arrest after a crowd in the city of Chauri Chaura attacked and killed the local representatives of British authority. Gandhi, who had never encouraged or sanctioned this type of conduct, condemned the actions of the violent crowds and retreated into a period of fasting and prayer as a response to this violent outburst. However, the British saw the event as a trigger point and a reason for his arrest.

=== Part V ===
The British authorities placed Gandhi on trial for sedition and sentenced him to six years in prison, marking the first time that he faced prosecution in India. Because of Gandhi's fame, the judge, C.N. Broomfield, hesitated to impose a harsher punishment. He considered Gandhi clearly guilty as charged, despite the fact that Gandhi admitted his guilt and even went as far as requesting the heaviest possible sentence. Such willingness to accept imprisonment conformed to his philosophy of satyagraha, so Gandhi felt that his time in prison only furthered his commitment and goals. The authorities allowed him to use a spinning wheel and receive reading materials while in prison, so he felt content. He also wrote most of his autobiography while serving his sentence.

However, in Gandhi's absence, Indians returned to their British jobs and their every day routines. Even worse, the unity between Muslims and Hindu, which Gandhi advocated so passionately, had already begun to fall apart to the point where the threat of violence loomed large over many communities with mixed population. The fight for Indian independence could not continue while Indians themselves suffered disunity and conflict, all the more difficult to overcome in a huge country like India, which had always suffered religious divisions, as well as divisions by language, and even caste.

Gandhi realized that Independence and that the British had lost the will and power to sustain their empire, but he always acknowledged that Indians could not rely simply on the weakening of Britain in order to achieve independence. He believed that Indians had to become morally ready for Independence. He planned to contribute to such readiness through his speeches and writing, advocating humility, restraint, good sanitation, as well as an end to child marriages. He acknowledged that he had changed his position on many issues, like child marriages, and that he had not always managed to discern the most moral course of action in his life.

After his imprisonment ended, he resumed his personal quest for purification and truth. He ends his autobiography by admitting that he continues to experience and fight with "the dormant passion" that lie within his own soul. He felt ready to continue the long and difficult path of taming those passions and putting himself last among his fellow human beings, the only way to achieve salvation, according to him.

"That is why the worlds' praise fails to move me; indeed it very often stings me. To conquer the subtle passions is far harder than the physical conquest of the world by the force of arms,"

Gandhi writes in his "Farewell" to the readers, a suitable conclusion for an autobiography that he never intended to be an autobiography, but a tale of experiments with life, and with truth.

After its initiation, ''The Story of My Experiments with Truth'' remained in the making for 4–5 years (including the time while Gandhi was imprisoned at [[Yerwada Central Jail]] near [[Pune]], [[Maharashtra]]), and then it first appeared as a series in the weekly Gujarati magazine ''Navjivan'' during 1925–1928, which was published from Ahmedabad, India.

''The Story of My Experiments with Truth'' was first published in the United States in 1948 by Public Affairs Press of Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| title = Books and Authors| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-12-02| date = 1948-04-21| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1948/04/21/archives/books-and-authors.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0190-8286| title = BOOK PUBLISHER MORRIS SCHNAPPER DIES AT AGE 86| work = Washington Post| accessdate = 2018-12-02| date = 1999-02-07| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1999/02/07/book-publisher-morris-schnapper-dies-at-age-86/185925ba-2fcd-46ec-98ef-031ff9566331/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signal-peptide-containing proteins==
These proteins contain a specific signal-peptide sequence, which is to be translated into the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], but are, however, able to reach the cell surface unconventionally. They can be packed into a COPII-coated vesicle and directly fuse with plasma membrane or can fuse with endosomal or lysosomal compartment. Alternatively, they can be packed into non-COPII-coated vesicle as well and fuse with Golgi (before reaching plasma membrane) or directly delivered to the plasma membrane.&lt;ref name="bla1"/&gt;

==Cytoplasmatic/nuclear secretory proteins==
Soluble proteins can reach the surface of the cell both by non-vesicular and vesicular mechanisms. Non-vesicular mechanisms use a carrier to get proteins into extracellular space (for example phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate). Vesicular mechanisms can  use the [[lysosome-dependent pathway]], [[microvesicle shedding]] or biogenesis of [[multivesicular bodies]].&lt;ref name="bla1"/&gt;

'''Victor Mancha''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character appeared in the award-winning series, ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]''. Like the original Runaways, Victor has a supervillain for a parent; his is the classic [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] villain [[Ultron]], an evil robot bent on world domination. Victor, however, is a [[cyborg]], with human flesh and natural tissue cloned from his human mother which completely conceals his metal parts and circuitry.

==Publication history==
Victor Mancha was created by author [[Brian K. Vaughan]] and artist Adrian Alphona and debuted in ''Runaways'' vol. 2, #1 ([[2005 in comics|April 2005]]).

==Fictional character biography==
When [[Ultron]] encountered a woman named Marianella Mancha who is unable to have a child due to a drug that was put in her, Ultron took some of her DNA and cloned it while combining some of his advanced nano-technology to create for her a son named Victor Mancha.

The Runaways first heard of Victor Mancha as a boy who would grow up to become the villain "Victorious", a man who would rule the world after dismantling the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].  Due to his prophesied betrayal, Victor was kept under close surveillance when he first joined the team, but has since been accepted as a full-fledged member. He is the team's only [[Latino]] member and one of two members who can pilot the [[Leapfrog (comics)|Leapfrog]], the Runaways' mode of transportation.

===True Believers===
Victor is first introduced as the son of [[Mexicans|Mexican]] single mother Marianella Mancha, supposed widow of a [[United States Marine Corps]] member who was [[killed in action]].&lt;ref name="debut"&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian K. Vaughan]] | Penciller =  [[Adrian Alphona]] | Inker = Christina Strain | Story = True Believers | Title = Runaways | Volume = 2 | Issue = 1 | Date = April 2005 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an older version of [[Gertrude Yorkes]] arrives in the present, she informs the Runaways of a villain in her time named "Victorious", and how they must stop him right now while he is still a teen. It is at this point she dies, but the Runaways decide to comply with her wish.&lt;ref name="debut"/&gt; After the Runaways track Victor down at his school, the sight of [[Karolina Dean]] activates Victor's electromagnetic superpowers - it would later be revealed that Victor's powers would manifest only when he came in contact with another superhero, hence Karolina.&lt;ref name="runawaysvol2#6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runaways.mergingminds.org/showarticle.asp?section=10&amp;fldAuto=333|title=Runaways (2nd series) #6|first=Fantomex|date=2008-07-31|publisher=Merging Minds|accessdate=2009-03-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008004313/http://runaways.mergingminds.org/showarticle.asp?section=10&amp;fldAuto=333|archivedate=2008-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remembering how future-Gert mentioned that Victorious's father was the "greatest evil in all the universe", the Runaways sift through possibilities such as [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], [[Red Skull]], [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], and [[Galactus (comics)|Galactus]].&lt;ref name="runawaysvol2#4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runaways.mergingminds.org/showarticle.asp?section=10&amp;fldAuto=331|title=Runaways (2nd series) #4|first=Fantomex|date=2008-07-29|publisher=Merging Minds|accessdate=2009-03-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008004255/http://runaways.mergingminds.org/showarticle.asp?section=10&amp;fldAuto=331|archivedate=2008-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Doctor Doom]] calls Victor proclaiming he is his father, it turns out that it is merely a Doombot created by Ultron. Victor discovers that his actual "father" is Ultron who created Victor as a [[sleeper agent]] for the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Victor was meant to grow up, travel to New York and meet the Avengers. After years of loyal service, he would have access to their most guarded secrets, and then Ultron would have taken over and destroyed every hero on the planet. The Runaways foiled this plan, but Victor still fears this future may come true.&lt;ref name="runawaysvol2#6"/&gt; Ultron kills Marianella and overrides Victor's circuits, forcing him to attack the Runaways. With help from [[Loners (comics)|Excelsior]], the Runaways and Victor defeat Ultron, but they take Victor in after realizing that Victor is in the same boat as they are.&lt;ref name="runawaysvol2#6"/&gt;

===Runaways===
Over the next few months, Victor proves himself to the team, particularly to [[Chase Stein]], in battle to make up for his alternate future self. He falls out of grace for a short while after [[Nico Minoru]] discovers that the second [[Pride (comics)|Pride]] has tapped into Victor's circuits and was using him to spy on the team.

After the Runaways' fight with the new 
Pride, Victor begins a physical relationship with Nico; he confesses to have initiated it because he harbors romantic feelings for her, but Nico claims to have participated as a way to escape her [[survivor guilt|survivor's guilt]] regarding the death of [[Gertrude Yorkes]]. However, Victor still attempts a rescue when he discovers Chase has Nico hostage, but is easily shut down when Chase asks him a rhetorical question designed to overload Victor's circuits.  Victor recovers with help from [[Molly Hayes]] (vicariously by [[Alex Wilder]]) and saves Nico from becoming an innocent sacrifice to the [[Gibborim (comics)|Gibborim]]. At this point, Victor and Nico begin a romantic relationship, but their moment of bliss is interrupted when the team is forced to run from [[Iron Man]] and the pro-registration forces of Marvel's [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;''Runaways (vol.2)'' #24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War===
During a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] operation to capture the Runaways, Victor uses his powers to shield the [[Leapfrog (comics)|Leapfrog]] from a barrage of missiles.  The second wave of missiles are coated with [[Teflon]], so they are unaffected by Victor's magnetic powers and hit him.  He suffers grievous damage and the team returns with him to the Hostel.  Victor then experiences intense seizures when the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] arrives with the [[Young Avengers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Runaways are initially mistrustful of the Young Avengers, [[Cassandra Lang|Stature]] is able to pull the Vision away from Victor. The Vision explains that he and Victor were experiencing a form of feedback caused by their shared programming because both of them were created by [[Ultron]].&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

Nico and Victor also initiate a relationship.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Victor's assortment of humorous nicknames is a sort of [[running gag]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} in the series' second volume, with such names as "Static Cling Lad", "[[Mr. Roboto]]", "Victron", "Calculator Kid", "Señor Cyborg", "[[Man of La Mancha]]", RoboPinnochio, and Magnet Man."

===Dead-End Kids===
After escaping [[Iron Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], Nico makes a decision to make a deal with [[Kingpin (comics)|the Kingpin]], which disgusts Victor.&lt;ref name="runv2#25"&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Joss Whedon]] | Penciller =  [[Michael Ryan (artist)|Michael Ryan]] | Inker = [[Christina Strain]] | Story = Dead-End Kids | Title = Runaways | Volume = 2 | Issue = 25 | Date = April 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a twisted turn of events, the Runaways end up time-displaced in 1907 New York.&lt;ref name="deadendkids"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runaways.mergingminds.org/showarticle.asp?section=10&amp;fldAuto=440|title=Dead End Kids|first=Fantomex|publisher=Merging Minds|accessdate=2009-04-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518084321/http://runaways.mergingminds.org/showarticle.asp?section=10&amp;fldAuto=440|archivedate=2009-05-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is during this period where Victor meets Lillie "the Spieler" McGurty, a girl who can fly to the sound of music. While separated from Nico, Victor bonds with Lillie's carefree spirit. A short time later, he has a dream of kissing Lillie. Nico, understanding her relationship with Victor is deteriorating, backs off allowing Victor to initiate a relationship with Lillie, who agreed to return to the present with the Runaways. Right before the Runaways boarded the time machine taking them home, Lillie changes her mind and decides to stay instead, due to fear of jumping into the future. [[Klara Prast]] takes her place instead, arriving with the Runaways in the present. Although the Runaways do not know, Lillie is still alive, regretting her decision.&lt;ref name="deadendkids"/&gt;
 
The Runaways come under attack when a group of Majesdaneans arrive on Earth to capture Karolina.&lt;ref&gt;''Runaways'': Vol. 3, #2&lt;/ref&gt; In the end the team is overpowered but Xavin shapeshifts into Karolina's form and takes her place as a prisoner of the Majesdaneans.&lt;ref&gt;''Runaways'': Vol. 3, #5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avengers A.I.===
Following the ''[[Age of Ultron]]'' storyline, Victor Mancha joins up with [[Henry Pym]]'s [[Avengers A.I.]] alongside Monica Chang, [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] (his older "brother"), and a reprogrammed [[Doombot]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers A.I.'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; During one mission he sacrifices himself to save a server containing an A.I. civilization.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers A.I.'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; They team later discovers he is alive inside a server called The Diamond when he sends [[Morse code]] to Pym that says "[[Fruit Loops]]", a cereal he hates, which Pym interprets as he is still alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers A.I.'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; Victor finds allies against the rogue A.I.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers A.I.'' #8&lt;/ref&gt; He and the Avengers are saved when Monica Chang cuts off the virus by preventing the execution of a rogue LMD.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers A.I.'' #12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vision===
Some time later, Victor moves in with Vision after getting an internship in [[Washington, D.C.]] It is later revealed that Victor is actually acting as an undercover agent for the Avengers, with orders to spy on Vision and his family due to their increasingly erratic behavior.&lt;ref&gt;''Vision'' #8&lt;/ref&gt; It is revealed via flashbacks that during his time with the Runaways, Victor had secretly developed an addiction to [[Vibranium]], which for him acts similar to narcotics used by humans. After using the Vibranium in a special piano given to Vision by [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], Victor misjudges the strength of his powers and accidentally kills Vision's son, Vin.&lt;ref&gt;''Vision'' #9&lt;/ref&gt; Captain America arrests him, but Vision defeats the Avengers to reach his cell. Vision is unable to kill Victor, but Victor's cybernetic heart was ripped out of his body by Vision's wife Virginia—killing him. With his final thoughts, he is at peace, knowing that he "will never be Victorious."&lt;ref&gt;''Vision'' #11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Becoming Victorious===
When [[Chase Stein]] attempts to revive Victor's head, the "Victorious" program begins.&lt;ref&gt;''Runaways'' Vol. 4 #3&lt;/ref&gt; It is revealed that Victor is conscious when [[Chase Stein]], [[Nico Minoru]], [[Gertrude Yorkes]], and [[Old Lace (comics)|Old Lace]] visits [[Molly Hayes]] to see if she is interested in reforming the Runaways again. During this visit, Molly is the only one to figure out that he is conscious and happy that Victor is still alive in a sense. Victor asks Molly to keep this a secret as he figures out whether or not he wants to rejoin Chase and the others. But unknown to the Runaways, Molly's grandmother plucked a strand of hair from Victor's head with unclear intentions. &lt;ref&gt;''Runaways'' Vol. 4 #4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Victor Mancha is a [[cyborg]], created from the [[DNA]] of Marianella Mancha and the technology of Ultron. Victor was constructed using advanced [[Nanorobotics|nanite]] technology that will evolve and mature with Victor into adulthood so that his robotic innards will transform into artificial human organs, indistinguishable from real ones.  Ultron created Victor with several computer-related abilities, including a high level of intelligence, vast amounts of [[hard drive]] memory (which Victor refers to as [[photographic memory]]), and the ability to communicate with other machines directly.  Victor also possesses some level of superhuman strength, incredible speed, a powerful jumping ability, and an automated self-repair function.

In combat, Victor primarily employs his electromagnetic abilities; he is capable of directing high voltage electrical energy from his hands and manipulating magnetic fields to reshape and bend metallic objects.  Much like [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], Victor can use Earth's natural magnetic lines of force to levitate and fly.

Despite his array of powers, Victor has four known weaknesses, many of which stem from his mechanical roots.  At his current age, Victor's nanites have not yet fully transformed into human organs, so his entire body will set off metal detectors, potentially drawing him unwanted attention.  Second, Victor's mainframe can be [[Hacker (computer security)|hacked]] and controlled remotely; "Hunter" (of the second Pride) (Victor removed it with an internal firewall) and Ultron are the only two that have successfully hacked Victor thus far.  Victor discovered his third weakness during the Runaways' first encounter with the [[Young Avengers]], when he and the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] both short-circuited upon getting too close to each other.  The Runaways and Young Avengers eventually discovered that when any two of Ultron's creations come within a close vicinity, both create a devastating feedback, harming both machines. This weakness has apparently since been removed, as Victor has been shown interacting with the Vision's new family without any harm to either.

While decoding The Abstract, Chase discovered Victor's last and most potent weakness: three questions designed specifically to overload Victor's circuits and lock him into a never ending loop of meaningless [[binary numeral system|binary]], which Nico refers to as "[[blue screen of death|the blue screen of death]]."  Chase used the first phrase against Victor after the cyborg discovered Nico in chains: "[[Omnipotence paradox|Could God make a sandwich so big that even He couldn't finish it?]]"  The only way for Victor to recover from his shutdown mode is by hearing the question's answer from someone else.  Once Victor's mainframe becomes functional again, he cannot be affected by that specific phrase ever again.  The two other phrases are unrevealed as yet, and are known only to Chase and Nico.

==Other versions==
===What If?===
In ''What If the Runaways became the Young Avengers?'', Victor is first contacted by his future self of Victorious after Victorious traveled back from the future with [[Iron Lad]], who accidentally landed in Victorious's time while attempting to escape [[Kang the Conqueror]]. Victor and Victorious steal the Iron Lad armor and Victor pretends to be Iron Lad. He then recruits the Runaways forcing them to be an actual superhero team with costumes, but intends to kill them. When Kang appears to rescue his younger self, the subsequent fight results in Iron Lad being killed and Kang being erased from history while Victor destroys his future self rejecting his evil ways. Having averted his destiny, Victor then departs via Kang's time-belt to find his own way, leaving the Runaways to continue as Young Avengers with Chase now using parts of the Iron Lad armor.&lt;ref&gt;What if the Runaways became the Young Avengers?&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age of Ultron===
During the ''[[Age of Ultron]]'' storyline, Victor Mancha was bringing some children to one of the Runaways' old bases in Los Angeles. Victor is having a hard time because he believes that if he uses his machine abilities, he will just help Ultron’s victory. He does not tell any of his new found friends about his background because he is afraid they will not accept him. In a flashback, it is shown that his Runaways teammates were all killed by Ultron and that Victor had stored digital versions of them in his memory banks, but these files seem to be corrupted since they seem to telling him that he needs to become more machine and less human. The Ultron Sentinels find the hideout and start killing some of the kids that Victor had saved. Victor decides to fight the Ultron Sentinels while determining that if this is the end, he will go down fighting.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultron'' #1AU&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avengers A.I.===
In one alternate future, [[List of Marvel Comics characters: A#Alexis The Protector|Alexis]] has a vision of 12,000 A.D. in which rogue A.I. Dimitrios wiped out humanity, the Kree, the Skrulls, and the Inhumans and traps all mutants in a pocket dimension. Only the Avengers A.I. survive, led by Alexis. Victor in this future wields [[Ultimate Thor|Ultimate Thor's]] hammer and joins the surviving Avengers in attacking Dimitrios, who created a spaceship out of [[Galactus]]'s carcass. He is killed by Dimitrios and [[Doombot]] then sacrifices himself, since Victor was the only person he considered a "Pal".&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers A.I. Issue 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual origins==
On colorist Christina Strain's Live Journal, she revealed that Victor's eyes are green with a golden center, which was modeled after [[Gael García Bernal]].&lt;ref name="dearworld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://color-me-sleepy.livejournal.com/125355.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121205215254/http://color-me-sleepy.livejournal.com/125355.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-05 |title=Dear World. |last=Strain |first=Christina |date=2008-08-08 |publisher=LiveJournal |accessdate=2009-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yi Ui-min''' ([[Hangul]]: 이의민, [[Hanja]]: 李義旼, (died 7 May 1196) was a military general who dominated the [[Goryeo]] government prior to the [[Mongol]] Invasions. When his rival, Commander [[Gyeong Dae-seung]], died, Yi Ui-min rose to power in the supreme military council, Jungbang. His tyranny came to and end in 1196 on the 8th day of the 4th lunar month when he was assassinated by General [[Choe Chung-heon]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Ki-baek. "A New History of Korea", Ilchokak, Seoul, 1984. {{ISBN|0-674-61576-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Background===
Yi Ui-min was born of slave status,&lt;ref&gt;Lee, pg.141&lt;/ref&gt; and his father Yi Seon (이선, 李善) was a salt trader and his mother a temple servant. According to the ''History of Goryeo'', he was as tall as 1m 90&amp;nbsp;cm and possessed remarkable physical strength. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Military===
Yi entered the capital defense command (경군, 京軍), where his outstanding [[Subak]] technique was noticed by the [[Uijong of Goryeo|King Uijong]] and he was promoted to the ''byeoljang'' (별장, 別將). In 1170, he got a position of the ''jungrangjang'' (중랑장, 中郎將) by the reward of joining the Goryeo warrior rebellion (무신정변). {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In 1173, [[Kim Bo-dang]] had attempted to reinstate Uijong who had been dethroned against the grasping political power of [[Jeong Jung-bu]]. As a result, Yi had been ordered to return Uijong from his place of exile, [[Geoje]], by rebel forces, only to kill him on his way back in Kyungju. Yi killed Uijong by snapping off his spine with his bare hands. He was said to have burst into a big laughter upon hearing the sound of Uijong's spine breaking. He then rolled up the dead body of Uijong in a blanket and dumped it in a lake. Afterwards, Yi Ui-min was promoted to general (장군, 將軍) in recognition for killing Uijong. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

He then made it to the top post, chief captain (상장군, 上將軍), for the credit of putting down the Revolt of [[Jo Wi-chong|Jo Wi-chong, Governor of Pyongyang]] in 1174. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

At 1179, when [[Gyeong Dae-seung]], who had an opposite political position against Jeong Jung-bu took the government and pushed away Jeong's people, Yi's power in the government significantly decreased, and his past murder of Uijong became the pretext that Gyeong would use to eliminate him. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}} 
 
Yi had been in fear of an assassination attempt by Gyeong, thus he had placed guards everywhere in around his house. One day, he heard a pleasing rumor that Gyeong was killed. This rumor proved to be wrong though as in fact it had been [[Heo Seung]], a close friend of Gyeong, who had died, not Gyeong himself. As a result of aware of it, Gyeong gave warning of Yi still more, Yi who was seized with fear, run away to [[Gyeongju]] on the pretext of illness. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Dictator===
When Gyeong died by disease in 1183, [[Myeongjong of Goryeo|King Myeongjong]] called Yi in to the [[Gaegyeong]]. Not believing the death of Gyeong, Yi refused the king's request several times, but finally came to the Gaegyeong after realizing Gyeong's death.

Yi who was commissioned as a ''susagongjwabokya'' (수사공좌복야, 守司空左僕射) by Myeongjong had gotten a position of a ''dongjungseomunhapyeongjangsa panbyeongbusa'' (동중서문하평장사 판병부사, 同中書門下平章事判兵部事) in 1190 additionally.

Yi who seized the political power, not only took bribes but also extorted private houses and lands. His family also committed many evil deeds. Especially his two sons, Yi Ji-young and Yi Ji-gwang who were called as "ssangdoja" (쌍도자, 雙刀子; meaning 'twin swordsmans') by repute.

Yi Jiyoung committed all sorts of brutality, killing whomever displaying contumacy to his authority and raping the pretty women, regardless of their marital statues. He even kidnapped and raped a royal concubine. Similarly, Mrs. Choe, Yi's wife, also had a tremendous sexual appetite, which eventually led to her demise after getting kicked out by Yi who had caught her red handed carrying on an adultery with one of their house servants. Yi's daughter was equally as infamously arrogant and lecherous as to disregard her husband, take up a separate residency and fool around with countless men.

===Death and family's downfall===
In 1196, having his pigeon snatched away by Ji-young, Yi's son, [[Choe Chung-soo]] went to his brother [[Choe Chung-heon]] to seek help. The Choe Chung-soo persuaded the Choe Chung-heon to carry out a plot to kill Yi together, to which he agreed after a momentary hesitation.

Yi turns down King Myeongjong's request to accompany him to a Bojesa temple (보제사, 普濟寺) by making an excuse about his ill physical condition and sneaks out to a [[Mita Mountain]] cottage. Hearing it, the Choe brothers make their way to the cottage and stakes out the place. They eventually kill Yi, ambushing him when he comes out of the cottage and is about to climb on a horse.

Having successfully carried out the assassination, the Choe brothers immediately head to the Gaegyeong, where they decapitated and exposed head of Yi on the street and call up troops with help from general Baek Jon-yoo. Hearing the news, the Myeongjong at the Bojesa temple hurries his way back to the Gaegyeong.

Yi's sons Ji-sun and Ji-gwang battle against the Choe brothers only to run away in the end after having struggled on the defensive.

As they flee, the Choe brothers lead their troops to the palace to ask the Myeongjong to allow them to put down the remaining insurgents loyal to Yi. With their authority granted by the Myeongjong, the choe brothers close up the castle gates to deter fleeing and went on to detain Yi's followers one by one. Meanwhile, they have general Han Hu capture and kill Yi Ji-young amid his frolick with [[Kisaeng]]s.

Hearing the news that Yi Ji-yeong had died, many people were said to be comforted and cheered. After then, Choe Chungheon killed all families and relatives of Yi Ui-min, and even sent people to every regions of the nation, wiping out all followers and slaves of Yi's. The survived two sons of Yi Ui-min, Yi Ji-sun and Yi Ji-Gwang,  returned to Choe Chung-heon to beg for mercy and their pardon, but Choe heedlessly killed both of them, eradicating the last of Yi's clan.
