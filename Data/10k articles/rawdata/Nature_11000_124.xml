      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4967">A '''biaxial nematic''' is a spatially homogeneous [[liquid crystal]] with three distinct optical axes. This is to be contrasted to a simple [[nematic]], which has a single preferred axis, around which the system is rotationally symmetric. The [[symmetry group]] of a biaxial nematic is &lt;math&gt;D_{2h}&lt;/math&gt; i.e. that of a rectangular right parallelepiped, having 3 orthogonal &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; axes and three orthogonal mirror planes. In a frame co-aligned with optical axes the second rank [[order parameter]] [[tensor]] of a biaxial nematic has the form 
:&lt;math&gt;
Q=
\begin{pmatrix}
-\frac{1}{2}S+T &amp; 0 &amp;0 \\
0 &amp;-\frac{1}{2}S-T &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0&amp; S\\
\end{pmatrix} 
&lt;/math&gt;

where 

&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the standard nematic scalar order parameter

&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; a measure of the biaxiality. 

The first report of a thermotropic biaxial nematic appeared in 2004&lt;ref&gt;

The transition is a [[Phase transition|second order transition]] with low energy content and therefore not observed in [[differential scanning calorimetry]]. The positional order parameter for the uniaxial nematic phase is 0.75 to 1.5 times the mesogen length and for the biaxial nematic phase 2 to 3.3 times the mesogen length.

Another strategy towards biaxial nematics is the use of mixtures of classical rodlike mesogens and disklike [[discotic]] mesogens.  The biaxial nematic phase is expected to be located below the minimum in the rod-disk phase diagram. In one study&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15426">'''Charles Green''' (baptised 26 December 1734 &amp;ndash; 29 January 1771) was a British [[astronomer]], noted for his assignment by the [[Royal Society]] in 1768 to the expedition sent to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in order to observe the [[transit of Venus]] aboard [[James Cook]]'s ''[[HM Bark Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.

==Early life and education==
Born sometime in December 1734, Green was the youngest son of Joshua Green, a prosperous farmer who lived near [[Swinton, South Yorkshire|Swinton]] in [[Yorkshire]]. His education, according to his future brother-in-law [[William Wales (astronomer)|William Wales]], was chiefly at a school near [[Denmark Street]] in [[Soho]], [[London]]. This school was run by his eldest brother, the clergyman Rev. John Green, and the younger Green went on to become an assistant teacher there,&lt;ref name="wendywales"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Researching Charles Green After Kippis|work=Cook's Log|page=32|volume=31|number=1|year=2008|first=Wendy|last=Wales|publisher=Captain Cook Society|url=http://www.captaincooksociety.com/ccsu41154.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; continuing his studies in astronomy until he joined the staff of the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Greenwich Observatory]] in 1760.&lt;ref name="lifeofcook"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_805AAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=The%20Life%20of%20Captain%20James%20Cook&amp;pg=PA209#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Andrew|last=Kippis|year=1789|title=The Life Of Captain James Cook, Volume 1|pages=209–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career in astronomy ==
Green was appointed as Assistant&lt;!-- A job title, so capital "A" --&gt; to the [[Astronomer Royal]], [[James Bradley]], succeeding the astronomer [[Charles Mason]] who left to join the expedition to the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to observe the 1761 [[transit of Venus]]. Following Bradley's death in 1762, Green continued in the role of assistant for Bradley's successor [[Nathaniel Bliss]]. Due to the ill-health of Bliss, much of the work of practical observational astronomy devolved upon Green at this time.

In 1763, Green, along with the astronomer [[Nevil Maskelyne]], was instructed by the [[Board of Longitude]] to make the voyage to Barbados to act as monitors of the test of [[John Harrison]]'s H4 chronometer, which was in the running for the [[Longitude prize|Longitude Prize]], the prize offered by the British Government for the devisor of an accurate method of determining the [[longitude]] of a ship at sea. Their duties, after they arrived in Barbados and were awaiting the chronometer's arrival on another ship, involved observation of the [[Galilean moons]] of Jupiter [[History of longitude#Proposed methods of determining time|to determine the local longitude]],&lt;ref name="instruments"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5D4OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA85|title=Instruments, Travel and Science: Itineraries of Precision from the Seventeenth to the Twentieth Century|chapter=Travels and trials of Harrison's timepiece|pages=84–86|editor1-first=Marie-Noëlle|editor1-last=Bourguet|editor2-first=Christian|editor2-last=Licoppe|editor3-first=Heinz Otto|editor3-last=Sibum|year=2002|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=0-415-27295-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after the arrival of the mechanism which was in the care of Harrison's son William, the comparison of the results of the chronometer with their astronomical observations to judge the mechanism's accuracy. On the voyage to Barbados, the pair were also using their observations to determine the accuracy of the [[Lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance method]],&lt;ref name="lifeofcook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Royalmuseum"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.rmg.co.uk/ontheline/2010/09/03/charles_green_royal_observator/|title=Charles Green, Royal Observatory Greenwich Assistant and stand-in Astronomer Royal|author=Rebekah Higgitt|publisher=Royal Museums Greenwich|year=2011|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maskelyne's own method of calculating the longitude of a ship at sea. An argument ensued between Maskelyne and William Harrison, which dragged in Green, as Harrison was of the opinion that Maskelyne was not an impartial observer and was a rival of his father in the pursuit of the Longitude Prize. A compromise was reached in which the monitoring of the Harrison mechanism was undertaken by Maskelyne and Green on alternate days.&lt;ref name="instruments" /&gt;

Green's return to England in the autumn of 1764 coincided with the death of Nathaniel Bliss; Green returned to Greenwich to continue Bliss' work until the appointment of a new Astronomer Royal.&lt;ref name="Royalmuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manwithout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.captaincooksociety.com/ccsu4143.htm|publisher=Captain Cook Society|title=Man Without A Face - Charles Green|author=Margaret Morris|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Astronomer Royal proved to be Nevil Maskelyne. Green briefly served under him as assistant, but left Greenwich after a disagreement with his new superior. Wales' account says that Green was involved in a survey to determine the feasibility of transporting water from the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|River Colne]] to provide water to Marylebone in London, although Green's survey confirmed the fears of mill owners downstream that the canal would result in a failure of the water supply needed for their operations and led to the scheme being dropped.&lt;ref name="lifeofcook" /&gt; Although this is unmentioned in Wales's short biography, Green is recorded as being the [[purser]] on the [[HMS Aurora (1766)|HMS ''Aurora'']] in 1768. In that same year, the [[Royal Society]] appointed him to accompany [[James Cook]]'s voyage to observe the 1769 [[transit of Venus]];&lt;ref name="Manwithout" /&gt; despite their earlier disagreement, Maskelyne who was serving on the Society's ''Transit of Venus Committee'' recommended his former assistant for the post.

== Voyage of the Endeavour and the Transit of Venus ==
[[File:Venus Drawing.jpg|thumb|right|Sketchings of the 1769 Venus Transit by Captain James Cook and Charles Green, showing the [[black drop effect]].]]
Green joined [[First voyage of James Cook|Cook's first voyage of circumnavigation]] in 1768, accompanied by a servant. Green was one of two official astronomers appointed by the Royal Society to observe the transit; the other was Cook himself, who was a capable observer in his own right.&lt;ref name="Orchiston"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1743921305001262|title=James Cook’s 1769 transit of Venus expedition to Tahiti|author=Wayne Orchiston|publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]]|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green was to receive 200 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] from the Society for the appointment. (Cook was to receive 100 guineas for his role in making the observations.)&lt;ref name="HistRoyalSoc"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of the Royal Society, with Memoirs of the Presidents, Volume 2|first=Charles Richard|last=Weld|year=1848|publisher=John W, Parker|pages=23–44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h8IwAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society provided instruments for the expedition, including two [[Reflecting telescope|reflector telescopes]] built by [[James Short (mathematician)|James Short]], two clocks and an [[Quadrant (instrument)|astronomical quadrant]]; these were supplemented by a telescope in the possession of [[Daniel Solander]] and another provided by the Navy.&lt;ref name="Orchiston" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HistRoyalSoc" /&gt;

The expedition arrived at [[Tahiti]], the chosen site for the observation of the transit, on 11 April 1769, anchoring in [[Matavai Bay]] on the north-western coast of the island two days later. A camp (Fort Venus) was established and the astronomical equipment was in place by the start of May. Of paramount importance for Green was the calculation of an accurate position of the location, which he calculated using the lunar distance method and by observation of the moons of Jupiter.&lt;ref name="Orchiston" /&gt; The removal of the quadrant from the camp - either by the local Tahitians or by members of the expedition who traded it to the Tahitians&lt;ref name="lifeofcook" /&gt; - threatened to derail the enterprise, but it was soon recovered, albeit disassembled into pieces and with some damage, by the expedition botanist [[Joseph Banks]], accompanied by Green.

The day of the transit, June 3, was a clear day and the transit was visible in its entirety. Although Cook had taken the precaution of sending two groups to outlying islands, the principal observation party remained at Fort Venus, where Green, Cook and (independently) Solander recorded the times of the transit. Cook noted in his log that the times recorded by the three observers for the times of [[Astronomical transit#Contacts|contact]] differed significantly;&lt;ref name="Orchiston" /&gt; this anomaly, now generally attributed to the ''[[black drop effect]]'', would cast significant doubt, in the eyes of the Royal Society and Nevil Maskelyne, on the usefulness and value of the observations later.

=== Criticism of Green and his observations ===
Due to Green's death on the homeward voyage, the work of collating and analysing his results fell first to Cook, and ultimately to Nevil Maskelyne. Cook admitted that Green's papers were in a disorganised state, when he inspected them after Green's death, and  that some of the timings were inconsistently recorded in various of the astronomer's papers.&lt;ref name="Orchiston" /&gt; The Astronomer Royal was critical of Green's work, especially of the observations Green made to calculate the latitude and longitude of Fort Venus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, from Their Commencement, in 1665, to the Year 1800: 1770-1776|year=1809|pages=173–178|publisher=C. and R.

(N Maskelyne)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been noted that although the times for the contacts given by the three observers (Green, Cook and Solander) present at Fort Venus vary, they show no pattern of inconsistency attributable to one observer alone.&lt;ref name="Orchiston" /&gt;

== Subsequent voyage of the Endeavour and the death of Green ==
Following the departure from Tahiti, the ''Endeavour'' continued south-westwards as Cook carried out his orders to further explore the Southern Ocean. The expedition reached New Zealand in October 1769, giving Green an opportunity to observe the [[transit of Mercury]] from land. A landing was made at an inlet that would be subsequently called [[Mercury Bay]] on  3 November; the transit was successfully observed by Green on November 9.&lt;ref name="beaglehole"&gt;{{cite book|last=Beaglehole|first=John Cawte|title=The Life of Captain James Cook| authorlink=John Cawte Beaglehole|pages=204–205|publisher=[[A &amp; C Black]]|year=1974|isbn=0-7136-1382-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On reaching Australia, and during Cook's voyage along the coast, he named an island, [[Green Island (Queensland)|Green Island]], after the astronomer in June 1770.&lt;ref name="Manwithout" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/queensland/green-island/2005/02/17/1108500203364.html|title=Green Island|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=8 February 2004|accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green, by this time had contracted scurvy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From Cook to Convicts: A Voyage of Adventure, Mayhem and Discovery|first=John|last= Darkin|publisher=Exisle Publishing|page=55|chapter=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KTsgKZtYylsC&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=scurvy%20%22Charles%20green%22&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage|isbn=978-1877437083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Endeavour'' was forced to make for  [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (present-day [[Jakarta]]) for repairs.  Disease were rife in the Dutch-controlled city, including malaria and [[dysentery]]; Green contracted the latter, dying on 29 January 1771, twelve days after the ship's departure from the port.&lt;ref name="Manwithout" /&gt; Cook, in recording Green's death in his log, went on to add that Green had been in ill-health for some time and his lifestyle had contributed to his early death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southseas.nla.gov.au/journals/cook/17710129.html|title=Cook's Journal: Daily Entries 29 January 1771|accessdate=10 June 2012|quote=Very variable weather, some times squally with rain, other times Little wind and Calms.

'''Cyrille Pierre Théodore Laplace''' (7 November 1793 – 24 January 1875) was a French [[navigator]] famous for his [[circumnavigation]] of the globe on board ''La Favorite''.  He was pivotal in the opening of French trade in the Pacific and was instrumental in the establishment of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu|Hawaiian Catholic Church]].  He achieved the rank of [[Captain (naval)|captain]].

==Early life==
Laplace was born at sea on 7 November 1793.&lt;ref name=Whitmore&gt;{{cite news|first=Robbie|last=Whitmore|title=Cyrille-Pierre Théodore Laplace|accessdate=10 December 2008|url=http://history-nz.org/discovery6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[French Navy]] and fought in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and Atlantic Oceans, along with battles in the [[West Indies]]. He was promoted from [[Aspirant]] to [[Ship-of-the-Line Lieutenant]] in 1823, and to [[Frigate Captain]] in 1828. He had been awarded he [[Cross of Saint-Louis]] in 1825.&lt;ref name=Dunmore3&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunmore|1965|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; He, at some point, was in command of a [[schooner]] in [[Gorée]], [[Senegal]].

==Voyage of ''La Favorite''==
As British, American and Dutch voyages began solidifying their interests in Australia, [[Hawaii]] and [[New Guinea]], the French government sought to secure the religious freedoms and rights of French residents in the South Pacific.&lt;ref name=Dunmore1&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunmore|1965|pp=228–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voyages such as that of [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] in the 1820s had already collected vast amounts of knowledge of the area, and the French government were hoping to secure its economic opportunities. Having sent out two voyages already, that of the ''Astrolabe'' and the ''Bayonnaise'', the French began drawing plans for a third expedition.&lt;ref name=Dunmore2&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunmore|1965|pp=234–238}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original route planned was designed to complement that of [[Hyacinthe de Bougainville]], re-establishing French influence on the [[Indo-China]] area.&lt;ref name=Dunmore2/&gt; Laplace's prime objective was to re-establish French influence in Indo-China, to "show the flag" in the area.&lt;ref name=Orient&gt;{{Harvnb|Laplace|Earman|Foreman|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also asked to gather information that may be of use to merchants, such as customs, harbour regulations, conditions of entry and market information. On 30 December 1829, Laplace departed [[Toulon]] with a crew of 177 aboard ''La Favorite''.&lt;ref name=Dunmore2/&gt;

[[File:View of Malate Church in 1831.jpg|thumb|''View of Malate Church in 1831''.]]
Laplace reached [[Gibraltar]] in one week, and decided to set sail for [[Gorée]],&lt;ref name=Dunmore2/&gt; where he spent a week. The ship then made its way south, crossing the Equator on the 4 February, and sighting the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 6 March.&lt;ref name=Dunmore2/&gt; Being forced to skip the scheduled stop in [[Cape Town]] due to poor weather, Laplace attempted to continue on to [[Réunion|Île Bourbon]]. Forced south by winds, ''La Favorie'' was hit by a [[hurricane]] on 28 March.&lt;ref name=Dunmore2/&gt; The hurricane reached Bourbon on 1 April, ravaging the island, and was closely followed by another, forcing Laplace to hurriedly set sail for [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref name=Dunmore2/&gt; Upon returning to [[Saint-Denis, Réunion|St. Denis]], a shark killed one of his crew members who was attempting to [[desert]], and Laplace was unable to recover an [[anchor]] he had lost near the island.&lt;ref name=Dunmore2/&gt;

On 1 May 1830, Laplace sailed towards India.&lt;ref name=Dunmore4&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunmore|1965|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the completion of one of his hydrological assignments, he continued on to [[Mahé, Seychelles]]. Six days later the crew had made their way past the [[Maldives]] and Ceylon (now known as [[Sri Lanka]]), before making landfall at [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]] on 9 June.&lt;ref name=Dunmore4/&gt; In Madras (now known as [[Chennai]]), Laplace was able to purchase new anchors and cables, and left on 28 June. On the night of the 29th, ''La Favorite'' became grounded on a mudbank.&lt;ref name=Dunmore4/&gt; The initial attempt to save the ship failed, but it was freed thanks to the help of nearby Indians. Laplace continued on to [[Yanam, French India|Yanaon]] before leaving the Indian coast on 2 August.

Laplace arrived in [[Singapore]] on 17 August, the first of a long series of [[South East Asia]]n cities.&lt;ref name=Dunmore5&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunmore|1965|pp=239–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Manila]], many of his crew grew sick; [[cholera]] was diagnosed on the land and the crew were reporting having [[Common Cold|cold]]s and [[fever]]s. On 28 September, ''La Favorite'' recorded its only cholera fatality; the [[epidemic]] cleared up before long.&lt;ref name=Dunmore5/&gt; After travelling via [[Macao]], Laplace arrived in Canton (today [[Guangzhou]]), with the intent of discussing the difficulties of French traders with the Chinese authorities. Laplace managed to secure France as the [[most favoured nation]] of China.&lt;ref name=Dunmore5/&gt; Setting sail on 18 December, Laplace arrived at Tourane (today [[Da Nang]]) on 21 December. There, he came across the ''S. Michel'' wrecked off the coast and the crew sick. Laplace attempted to allow the crew on board, but many died from their illnesses.&lt;ref name=Dunmore5/&gt; In Tourane, Laplace was met with hostility, as the authorities were paranoid of his intentions in the area. It was suspected that ''La Favorite'' had a large army concealed in the hold, and Chinese soldiers were brought into the city to oversee Laplace's actions.&lt;ref name=Dunmore6&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunmore|1965|pp=243–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laplace left the area in frustration of [[Emperor]] [[Minh Mạng]]'s isolationist policies, the diplomatic mission having failed.&lt;ref name=Dunmore6/&gt;

On 5 March, Laplace sailed south towards the [[Natuna Islands]], charting the area as they moved.&lt;ref name=Dunmore6/&gt; In particular, Laplace attempted to complement Bougainville's earlier workaround around the [[Anambas]], not finishing his work until 4 April.&lt;ref name=Dunmore6/&gt; He then set sail for [[Surabaya]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. There he was informed of the events of the [[July Revolution]], and that a war was expected.&lt;ref name=Dunmore6/&gt; After [[dysentery]] struck the ship, Laplace moved on to [[Banyuwangi]]. During the trip, several men died, while morale decreased.&lt;ref name=Dunmore7&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunmore|1965|pp=250–258}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Laplace&gt;{{Harvnb|Laplace|1833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laplace attributed the ships poor health to the decrease of wine rations.&lt;ref name=Dunmore7/&gt;

Laplace set sail for [[Hobart]], and sighted [[Mewstone]] on 6 July.&lt;ref name=Dunmore7/&gt; Two more men were buried on [[Bruny Island]], before ''La Favorite'' was allowed to anchor at Hobart on 11 July. The sick men were sent to hospital, although three men were to die there.&lt;ref name=Dunmore7/&gt; Laplace left Hobart on 7 August, and set sail for [[Sydney]], arriving on 16 August.&lt;ref name=Dunmore7/&gt; In Sydney the crew went to numerous social events, left to a twenty-one gun salute on 21 September 1831.&lt;ref name=Dunmore7/&gt; Laplace proposed a short break in New Zealand, and anchored in the [[Bay of Islands]] on 2 October. There the crew gave gifts of guns to the [[Māori people|Māori]] chieftains, who in turn greeted them with the [[haka]]. Laplace and his crew were 'disgusted' by the display, considering the Māori to be 'savages'.&lt;ref name=Laplace/&gt; On 11 October, the crew took a number of detailed observations of New Zealand, including the [[Kawakawa, New Zealand|Kawakawa River]]. These observations were taken to be an attempt to claim New Zealand for France, causing excitement in Sydney and even led to the British Government requesting clarification from the French.&lt;ref name=Dunmore7/&gt; This concern, nonetheless, hurried the development of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].&lt;ref name=Whitmore/&gt;

After his stay in New Zealand, Laplace headed east, arriving in [[Valparaíso]] on 14 November. He continued south past [[Cape Horn]] and reached [[Rio de Janeiro]] on 23 January 1832. After being farewelled by the crew of a British warship, Laplace set sail for France. After reaching [[Gibraltar]] on 11 April, ''La Favorite'' anchored in Toulon harbour on 21 April.&lt;ref name=Dunmore7/&gt; Laplace's voyage was generally successful, despite the setback in China. His account of the voyage, ''Voyage autour du Monde par les Mers de l'Inde et de la Chine'', was published by the French government in 1833.&lt;ref name=Dunmore7/&gt;

==Voyage of the ''Artémise''==
[[File:La frégate L'Artémise entrant à Tanoa, après son échouage.jpg|thumb|200px|''La frégate L'Artémise entrant à Tanoa, après son échouage'']]
In 1837, Laplace once again undertook a voyage, this time as captain of the ''Artémise''. The aim of this voyage was primarily political; Laplace delivered a manifesto on the treatment of [[Catholic]]s in the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] in July 1839 which came to be known as the [[Laplace Affair]].&lt;ref name=Dodge&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodge|1971|pp=275–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daragang Magayon''' ({{lang-en|Beautiful Maiden}}) is the [[heroine]] that appears in the legend of [[Mt. Mayon]] in [[Albay]], [[Philippines]].

== Basic legend ==
Magayon was the only daughter of Makusog (strong), the tribal chief of Rawis, whose mother was named Dawani ([[fairy]]), who died shortly after giving birth to her. She grew up to be a very beautiful and sweet woman that struck the swains from faraway tribes who vied for her attention. However, none of these young men could captivated the heart of Magayon, not even the handsome but haughty Pagtuga ([[eruption]]), a hunter and the chief of the Iriga tribe. He gave fabulous gifts to Magayon, yet it was not enough to capture her attention.

One day, Daragang Magayon was bathing in the Yawa river when she slipped on the rocks. Unfortunately, she did not know how to swim. Panganoron was passing by and saw what was happening to Daragang Magayon, so he saved her from the river. He began to court her, and after some time Magayon accepted his proposal and he received her father's blessings. 

However, when Pagtuga knew about the relationship between Panganoron and Magayon, Pagtuga kidnapped Magayon's father and asked Magayon to be his wife in exchange for her father's freedom.

Panganoron knew about the situation so he asked his warriors to join him in the war with Pagtuga in the mountains. The war was fierce and breathtaking. The people and Magayon watched the war between the two of them. In the end, Panganoron killed Pagtuga. Upon his victory, Magayon ran to embrace her lover.

As Magayon ran toward her lover, an arrow shot by one of Pagtuga's warriors struck Panganoron, killing him. Magayon held Panganoron as he died in her arms. 

Pagtuga's warriors surrounded the lovers as Magayon took the knife from Panganoron's side and shouted Panganoron's name before stabbing herself. Her father and tribesmen witnessed how Magayon died with her lover. 

Her father buried them together. As time went on, they noticed something about the place where Makusog buried the lovers: It started to form into a volcano, and when the people saw it, Makusog named it Mt. Mayon, after his daughter's name. Mt. Mayon is as beautiful as Daragang Magayon.

Some people said that it's a curse because she took her own life, but myths and legends said Magayon is the volcano and Panganoron is the clouds that surround the beautiful volcano.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2383">A '''dredge-up''' is a period in the evolution of a [[star]] where a surface [[convection zone]] extends down to the layers where material has undergone [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|nuclear fusion]]. As a result, the fusion products are mixed into the outer layers of the stellar atmosphere where they can appear in the [[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectrum]] of the star.

The first dredge-up occurs when a [[main sequence|main-sequence]] star enters the [[red giant|red-giant branch]]. As a result of the convective mixing, the outer atmosphere will display the spectral signature of [[hydrogen]] fusion: the [[Carbon-12|&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C]]/[[Carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] and [[carbon|C]]/[[nitrogen|N]] ratios are lowered, and the surface abundances of [[lithium]] and [[beryllium]] may be reduced.

The second dredge-up occurs in stars with 4–8 [[solar mass]]es. When [[helium]] fusion comes to an end at the core, convection mixes the products of the [[CNO cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | first=D. L. | last=Lambert

 | title=Elements and the Cosmos
 | editors=Mike G. Edmunds and Roberto J. Terlevich
 | publisher=[[University of Cambridge]] | year=1992
 | isbn=0-521-41475-X | pages=92&amp;ndash;109
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This second dredge-up results in an increase in the surface abundance of &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N, whereas the amount of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O decreases.&lt;ref name="kwok"&gt;{{cite book

 | title=The origin and evolution of planetary nebulae
 | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | page=199
 | isbn=0-521-62313-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third dredge-up occurs after a star enters the [[asymptotic giant branch]] and a [[shell helium flash|flash]] occurs along a helium-burning shell. This dredge-up causes helium, [[carbon]] and the [[s-process|''s''-process]] products to be brought to the surface. The result is an increase in the abundance of carbon relative to oxygen, which can create a [[carbon star]].&lt;ref name="kwok" /&gt;

The names of the dredge-ups are set by the evolutionary and structural state of the star in which each occurs, not by the sequence experienced by the star.  As a result, lower-mass stars experience the first and third dredge-ups in their evolution but not the second.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9174">'''Emotional Selection''' is a [[psychological]] theory of [[dream]]ing that describes dreams as modifiers and tests of [[Schema (psychology)|mental schemas]] to better meet waking [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|human needs]]. It was introduced by Richard Coutts in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coutts|first=Richard|date=2008|title=Dreams as modifiers and tests of mental schemas: an emotional selection hypothesis|url=http://prx.sagepub.com/content/102/2/561.abstract|journal=Psychological Reports|doi=10.2466/pr0.102.2.561-574|pmid=18567225|access-date=|volume=102|pages=561–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refined by him in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coutts|first=Richard|date=2010|title=A Pilot Study for the Analysis of Dream Reports Using Maslow's Need Categories: An Extension to the Emotional Selection Hypothesis|url=http://prx.sagepub.com/content/107/2/659.abstract|journal=Psychological Reports|doi=10.2466/09.PR0.107.5.659-673|pmid=21117494|access-date=|volume=107|pages=659–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to emotional selection, during [[non-REM sleep]], the mind processes [[dream]]s with content intended to improve the ability of [[Schema (psychology)|mental schemas]]. For example, individuals struggling with self-perceptions of incompetence may process dreams in which they successfully navigate complex situations, those who struggle to meet belongingness needs may have dreams of entering a partner relationship, and so forth. Regardless, the theme of the non-REM dream is tentatively [[accommodation (psychology)|accommodated]] by [[Schema (psychology)|mental schemas]]. Because [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] coexist as a [[wikt:network|network]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The construction of reality|author1=Arbib, M.A |author2= Hesse, M.B. |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[accommodation (psychology)|accommodations]] can introduce accidental, maladaptive conflicts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The equilibration of cognitive structures: the central problem of intellectual development|last=Piaget|first=J.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1975|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore are ideally tested prior to full integration. Therefore, during subsequent [[REM sleep]], a second set of [[dream]]s is executed in the form of [[scenario testing|test scenarios]]. If [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] [[accommodation (psychology)|accommodations]] performed during prior [[non-REM]] [[dream]]s alleviate anxiety, frustration, sadness, or in other ways appear [[emotions|emotionally]] adaptive during [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] dream tests, they would be [[Selection (biology)|selected]] for retention. Those [[accommodation (psychology)|accommodations]] that compare negatively to existing, unchanged [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] would be abandoned or further modified and tested.

REM dreams are often described in the academic literature as having bizarre themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Revonsuo, A. |author2= Salmivalli, C. |last-author-amp=yes |date=1995|title=A content analysis of bizarre elements in dreams|url=|journal=Dreaming|doi=10.1037/h0094433|pmid=|access-date= |volume=5 |pages=169–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Coutts, this description fits neatly in emotional selection. During the development of complex systems, engineers often test with rigorous, outwardly bizarre scenarios, such as intentionally crashing expensive automobiles, dropping functioning electronics onto hard surfaces, or vibrating scale models of buildings on shake tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Flying buttresses, entropy, and o-rings: the world of an engineer|last=Adams|first=J. L.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1991|isbn=9780674306899|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such extreme, costly tests assure that designs meet specifications. The themes of REM dreams are often likewise extreme and bizarre, such as being chase down an alley by a monster, finding oneself naked in the presence of a crowd of people, or realizing that one's teeth or hair are falling out. When such themes are reviewed as tests of the ability of [[Schema (psychology)|mental schemas]] to cope with extreme stress, they appear rational.

According to emotional selection, pleasant  dreams, such as having sex, finding riches, or suddenly being able to fly, are tests that evaluate a person's ability to cope with success. This concept may appear to be an oxymoron. However, the challenges of coping with success are often poignantly depicted by people with self-destructive behaviors, such as substance abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cognitive therapy: the basics and beyond|last=Beck|first=Aaron|publisher=The Guilford Press|year=1995|isbn=978-1609185046|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Success thrust upon those with a poor self-image can cause such people to reject the notion that they are worthy of good fortune, which is why related [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] must be modified and tested with dreams. From Coutts' 2008 paper, "People strive for independence, yet find solace in the company of others; they place a high priority on our personal safety, yet quickly jeopardize it to help [[Abraham Maslow|those]] in need; they are sexually attracted to many people, yet seek loving, [[monogamous]] relationships. [[Schema (psychology)|Schemas]] help strike the balances necessary for navigating the complex, often contradictory landscape that comprises life."&lt;ref name="Abstracts A-D"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coutts|first=Richard|title=Richard Coutts, Abstracts A-D|url=http://www.asdreams.org/2008/abstracts/abstractsA-D.html|accessdate=August 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] targeted by emotional selection are those essential for meeting [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|human needs]], such as those define by [[Abraham Maslow]] and [[Henry Murray]]. Consequently, emotional selection theory agrees with [[evolution]]ary forces by describing a role for [[dream]]s as adaptively enhancing [[Schema (psychology)|mental schemas]].

That dreams facilitate the selection of adaptive mental schemas supports the survival value description of emotional communication in general. The German philosopher [[Ferdinand Fellmann]] proposed in 2009 emotional selection as a third form of evolutionary selection besides natural and sexual selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fellmann|first=Ferdinand|date=2009|title=Das Paar als Quelle des Selbst. Zu den soziobiologischen Grundlagen der philosophischen Anthropologie|url=|journal=Deutsche Zeitschrift für Philosophie |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=745–56|doi=10.1524/dzph.2009.0062|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loving, monogamous [[pair bond|pair-bonding]] seems to be the favored field where sexual selection is being transformed in emotional selection specific for human courtship and mating.

The concept of emotional selection fits the recent trend of evolutionary psychology which suggests that individual differences are more than the raw material upon which natural selection operates as a homogenizing force. Instead, personality and individual differences are created by “psychosocial selection”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evolution: The Modern Synthesis|last=Huxley|first=Julian|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1942|isbn=9780262513661|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the more intense forms of pair-bonding in primate sociality. Pair-bonds are based on detecting and supporting emotional complexity in partners with whom we maintain long-term intimate intercourse.

'''[[Italy]]''' consumed about 185 [[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]] of [[primary energy]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Petroleum|BP]] data [http://www.bp.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This came mostly from [[fossil fuels]]. Among the most used resources are [[petroleum]] (mostly used for the transport sector), [[natural gas]] (used for electric energy production and heating), [[coal]] and [[Renewable energy in Italy|renewables]].

An important share of electricity comes from import, mainly from [[Switzerland]] and [[France]]. The share of primary energy dedicated to electricity production is above 35%,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terna.it data from Terna - Italian electric grid]&lt;/ref&gt; and grew steadily since the 1970s.

Electricity is produced mainly from natural gas, which accounts for the source of more than half of the total final electric energy produced. Another important source is [[Hydroelectricity in Italy|hydroelectric power]], which was practically the only source of electricity until 1960. Wind and solar power grew rapidly between 2010 and 2013 thanks to high incentives.

Italy has few energy resources, and most of supplies are imported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity==
{{Main | Electricity sector in Italy}}
{{see also | Renewable energy in Italy#Electricity sector}}
In 2014 Italy consumed 291.083 TWh (4790 kWh/person) in electricity, consumption in household were 1057 kWh/person.&lt;ref name="Terna data"&gt;[http://www.terna.it/default/home_en/electric_system/statistical_data.aspx TERNA statistics data]&lt;/ref&gt;
Italy is a net importer of electricity: the country imported 46,747.5 GWh and exported 3,031.1 GWh in 2014. Gross production in 2014 was 279.8 TWh. The main power sources are natural gas and hydroelectricity.&lt;ref name="Terna data" /&gt;

Italy has no nuclear power since it was banished [[Italian referendums, 1987|in 1987 by referendum]].
In Tuscany was built the first geothermal power station. In 2014 the geothermal production was 5.92 TWh. All active Italian geothermal power stations are now in [[Tuscany]].&lt;ref name="Terna data" /&gt;

==Emissions==
According to Energy Information Administration, the 2009 Italian CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from energy consumption were 408 Mt, slightly below  [[Energy in Indonesia|Indonesia]] 413 mt. worldwide, Italy was ranked 17th in 2009 according to this list. The Italian emissions decline of 9% in 2008–2009 was rather influenced by the European economic recession 2008–2009 than large sustainable changes in energy consumption. From 2008 to 2009 change was at a 6.9% decline in Europe and at a 7.5 increase in Asia &amp; Oceania.&lt;ref name=Guardianlist&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jan/31/world-carbon-dioxide-emissions-country-data-co2 World carbon dioxide emissions data by country: China speeds ahead of the rest] Guardian 31 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Emissions of consumption could be a more significant indicator rather than national greenhouse production: many European companies have moved production from Europe to Asia the last ten years, which does not necessarily change the overall emissions of the world or the company. According to ''[[the Guardian]]'', the most widely cited international dataset for consumption emissions is from year 2001 including the consumption emissions per capita of all greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name=Guardian2010&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/21/countries-responsible-climate-change?intcmp=122 Which nations are most responsible for climate change?] Guardian 21 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Italy’s footprint in 2001 was 12 ton CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per person (rank no 21)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbonfootprintofnations.com/content/ranking/ Carbon foot print of nations]&lt;/ref&gt; Italy’s domestic share of greenhouse gas emissions was 62%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbonfootprintofnations.com/images/pdf_icon.png Carbon Footprint of Nations: A Global, Trade-Linked Analysis] Environ.

'''Evansburg State Park''' is a {{convert|3349|acre|adj=on}} [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state park]] in [[Lower Providence Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Lower Providence]], [[Lower Salford Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Lower Salford]], [[Skippack Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Skippack]], [[Towamencin Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Towamencin]], and [[Worcester Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Worcester]] Townships in [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]], [[Pennsylvania]] in the United States. The park has a variety of [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] including [[forest]]s, [[meadow]]s, old fields, and farmland. The park offers a variety of recreational opportunities including picnicking, [[golf]], ball fields, biking, [[hiking]], [[hunting]], [[horseback riding]], and [[fishing]]. Evansburg State Park is near [[Collegeville, Pennsylvania|Collegeville]] and [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]] just off [[Pennsylvania Route 363]].

==History==
The land on which Evansburg State Park is located was originally part of a massive tract of land purchased from the [[Lenape]] (Delaware) by [[William Penn]] in 1684. The land was quickly settled according to Willam Penn's planned "Holy Experiment". The first settlers were [[Mennonites]]. They fled religious persecution in Europe for the [[religious freedom]], promised by William Penn in his colony. The Mennonites cleared the land of its [[old-growth forest]]s and built [[farm]]s, stores and mills that were powered by the waters of Skippack Creek. The area developed very rapidly and the [[Skippack Pike]] was constructed in 1714 to provide access to the markets of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]].

The area in and surrounding Evansburg State Park remained largely [[rural]] until [[World War II]]. The growth of [[suburbs]] and industry forever changed the landscape of the Skippack Valley. Evansburg State Park was established in 1979 to protect the rural qualities of the area and to provide outdoor recreational opportunities for the people of southeastern Pennsylvania. The original plan was for the construction of a high dam and lake for recreation, but this was met by local opposition, and the plan was scaled back.&lt;ref name="esp"&gt;{{cite web

The [[Warren Z. Cole House|Indenhofen Farm]] is operated by the Skippack Historical Society and open to the public. [[Kuster Mill]] is also located in the park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skippack.org/index.htm Skippack Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recreation==
===Fishing and hunting===
[[Skippack Creek]] is [[fish stocking|stocked]] with [[brown trout]] and [[rainbow trout]]; other fish in the creek include [[smallmouth bass]], [[catfish]], [[Catostomidae|sucker]], [[carp]], [[panfish]], and [[Anguillidae|freshwater eel]]. All fishers are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the [[Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission]].&lt;ref name="esp"/&gt;

About {{convert|1000|acre}} of Evansburg State Park are open to hunting. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the [[Pennsylvania Game Commission]]. The common game species are [[eastern gray squirrel|squirrels]], [[common pheasant|pheasant]], [[eastern cottontail|rabbits]] and [[white-tailed deer]]. The hunting of [[groundhog]]s is prohibited.&lt;ref name="esp"/&gt;

===Golf===
The [[golf course]] at Evansburg State Park is known as Skippack Golf Club. It is an 18-hole {{convert|6007|yd}}, [[Par (golf scoring format)|par]] 70 golf course. It was designed by Herris &amp; Benahia, and opened in 1950. The course is managed by Skippack Golf Club, LLC under contract with the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Trails===
Evansburg State Park has {{convert|26|mi}} of trails that are open to [[hiking]], [[Equestrianism|horseback riding]], [[cross-country skiing]], and [[mountain biking]]. The {{convert|6|mi}} of hiking trails are all rated as easy trails and pass through a variety of habitats. A mountain bike trail ({{convert|5|mi}}) is open at the south end of the park. Bikers are prohibited from using the hiking and equestrian trails. They are permitted to ride on the park roads. Fifteen miles of horseback riding trails are open at Evansburg State Park. Riders are also permitted to use the shoulders of the roads of the park.&lt;ref name="esp"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7358">'''Feminist biology''' is an approach to [[biology]] that is concerned with the influence of gender values, the removal of gender bias, and the understanding of the overall role of social values in biological research and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Carla, "Feminist Philosophy of Biology", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist Biology, was founded by, among others, Dr. Ruth Bleier of the University of Wisconsin-Madison (who authored the 1984 work “Science and Gender: A Critique of Biology and Its Theories on Women” and inspired the university’s endowed fellowship for feminist biology),&lt;ref&gt;David, Tenembaum. "First in the Nation: UW-Madison Establishes Post-doc in Feminist Biology." University of Wisconsin-Madison News. University of Wisconsin-Madison, 17 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; it aims to enhance biology by incorporating feminist critique in matters varying from the mechanisms of cell biology and sex selection to the [[sex and gender distinction|assessment of the meaning of words such as “gender” and “sex.”]]
Overall, the field is broadly defined and pertains itself to philosophies behind both biological and feminist practice. These considerations make feminist biology debatable and conflictive with itself, particularly when concerning matters of [[biological determinism]], whereby descriptive sex terms of male and female are intrinsically confining, or extreme post-modernism, whereby the body is viewed more as a social construct.&lt;ref&gt;Dominguez, Johnna. "A Fine Line: Feminism and Biology." Club Antro: UA Anthropology Blog Network. University of Alabama, 27 Aug. 2012. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite opinions ranging from determinist to postmodernist, however, biologists, feminists, and feminist biologists of varying labels alike have made claims to the utility of applying feminist ideology to biological practice and procedure.

==Contributions==
[[Donna J. Haraway]], a biologist and primatologist hailing from the University of California, put forth male bias criticisms in 1989 concerning the study of human evolution and culture via primatology by denoting a prominent lack of focus in female primates.&lt;ref&gt;Haraway, Donna Jeanne. Primate visions: Gender, race, and nature in the world of 
modern science. Psychology Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Haraway contributed to a large discovery of behaviors in primate groups regarding mate selection, and female-female interactions derived from observing female primates, citing feminist influences as she studied the female primates in their own merit.

Similarly, feminist cell biologists of The Biology and Gender Study Group have criticized androcentrism in the study of behavior between sexes and “come to look at feminist critique as [they] would any experimental control.”&lt;ref&gt;Biology and Gender Study Group, et al. "The Importance of Feminist Critique for Contemporary Cell Biology." Hypatia (1988): 61-76.&lt;/ref&gt; They cite a general trend of “active” biological description associated with the sperm gamete and “passive” description to the ovum, comparing such description to an archetypal hero facing many challenges before it finding its static, female home. The group criticized the diction employed by biological readings and textbooks, stating that the more active and risk-associated traits of the ovum (such as its own survival from the whittling of 2&amp;nbsp;million oocytes) are dismissed for the sake of a patterned narrative.

[[Anne Fausto-Sterling]], a professor of Biology and Gender Studies at Brown University, assesses the complexity of defining sex through a dichotomous lens in a variety of her works such as Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality as well as in an article piece she wrote titled “The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough.” She addresses the existence of intersex individuals and the lack of acknowledgment of their state of being in the context of a dichotomously defined world of sexes – even, if not especially, by medical professionals and surgeons who understand intersex anatomy to a point to where they can surgically alter it to one of the sexes. She states: “Ironically, a more sophisticated knowledge of the complexity of sexual systems has led to the repression of such intricacy.”&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne. "The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough." The Sciences Mar/Apr. 1993: 20-24. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Fausto-Sterling continues by advocating the reevaluation of what is considered urgent medical intervention in light of the influence she believes social stigma has had on standard medical procedure – which in turn could help open up the possible directions that science could take.

==Motivation==
The motivations of advocating feminist biology are diverse. One of the most common motivations is to challenge the gender biases originated from science, by discerning a more objective, scientific truth from culturally influenced practices.&lt;ref&gt;Schiebinger, Londa. 1999. Has Feminism Changed Science? Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many individuals argue the emergence and development of modern science involved the domination of a female world and the exclusion of women. [[Reductionism]], for instance, is a view that all matters in the universe are arranged hierarchically, and that causation only occurs at the lower levels of this hierarchy&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Carla, "Mechanism without Reductionism", NWSA Journal, 16(1), 136-156.&lt;/ref&gt;. A tight link exists between reductive mechanistic science and [[biological determinism]], contributing to the argument that biological causes are the only causes, or the most important cause, of 'feminine' behavior. This link is due to the reductive assumption that causation acts in an upward direction from lower levels of organization to higher levels of organization&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Carla, "Mechanism without Reductionism", NWSA Journal, 16(1), 136-156.&lt;/ref&gt;. Many feminist biologists focus on dispelling such stigmatic prejudices that influential figures have accepted as scientifically true. 

==Controversy==
There is an ongoing debate on whether a feminist critique should be incorporated in the sciences, especially biology. Some argue that feminist biology is a form of politicization of science, calling to question the legitimacy of feminist biology altogether. On another level, there is debate even within the feminist community on how to deal with biological sex differences. Some account on the importance of accepting biological sex differences to reach gender equality, while others contend that there sex differences are overly emphasized in society, contributing to gender stereotypes&lt;ref&gt;Londa Schiebinger, "Introduction," Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society 28, no. 3 (Spring 2003): 859-866.&lt;/ref&gt;. Individuals such as [[Carla Fehr]] offer constructive criticism for the future of feminist philosophy in the field of biology; she proposes feminist biologists to consider novel questions pertaining to subjects such as the research of genomics in relation to gender.&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Carla, "Feminist Philosophy of Biology", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2166">The '''Grasshopper''' was a project by the [[United States Air Force]] and US Navy to develop portable robot [[weather station]] deployed by parachute from long range aircraft in the early 1950s. The Grasshopper was designed to be deployed by [[parachute]] into enemy territory and [[Radio transmission|radio]] back basic [[Weather forecasting|weather information]] for [[air strikes]].

With the USAF ''Grasshopper'' after being parachuted down from a long range [[aircraft]], a small [[explosive charge]] disconnects the parachute upon impact with the ground. After a selected preset time, a second explosive charge would deploy the legs of the unit while setting it upright on the ground. Finally, a third explosive charge would extend the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] and make the unit ready to begin taking [[Weather forecasting|weather measurement]]s, broadcasting them back three times a day at selected timed-intervals (so other aircraft can pick up the short range signal). Reports also stated that the Grasshopper could be used to guide in strike aircraft with the internal clock set for the approximate time the [[strike aircraft]] would arrive near the target.

'''Heat transfer''' is a discipline of [[thermal engineering]] that concerns the generation, use, conversion, and exchange of [[thermal energy]] ([[heat]]) between physical systems. Heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms, such as [[thermal conduction]], [[convective heat transfer|thermal convection]], [[thermal radiation]], and transfer of energy by [[phase changes]]. Engineers also consider the transfer of mass of differing chemical species, either cold or hot, to achieve heat transfer. While these mechanisms have distinct characteristics, they often occur simultaneously in the same system.

Heat conduction, also called diffusion, is the direct microscopic exchange of kinetic energy of particles through the boundary between two systems. When an object is at a different [[temperature]] from another body or its surroundings, [[heat]] flows so that the body and the surroundings reach the same temperature, at which point they are in [[thermal equilibrium]]. Such spontaneous heat transfer always occurs from a region of high temperature to another region of lower temperature, as described in the [[second law of thermodynamics]].

Heat convection occurs when bulk flow of a fluid (gas or liquid) carries heat along with the flow of matter in the fluid. The flow of fluid may be forced by external processes, or sometimes (in gravitational fields) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid (for example in a fire plume), thus influencing its own transfer. The latter process is often called "natural convection". All convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion, as well. Another form of convection is forced convection. In this case the fluid is forced to flow by use of a pump, fan or other mechanical means.

Thermal radiation occurs through a [[vacuum]] or any [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] [[Optical medium|medium]] ([[solid]] or [[fluid]] or [[gas]]). It is the transfer of energy by means of [[photons]] in [[electromagnetic waves]] governed by the same laws.&lt;ref name=Geankoplis&gt;{{cite book |last=Geankoplis |first=Christie John |year=2003 |title=Transport Processes and Separation Principles |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-101367-X |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; K is thermal conductivity. T1-T2 is the temperature difference between the two ends.A is the area of cross section.If the area of cross section is not uniform the equation can only be applied to thin layer

==Overview==
{{See also |Heat transfer physics}}
[[File:Erbe.gif|thumb|300px|Earth's long wave thermal [[Earth's energy budget#Outgoing energy|radiation]] intensity, from clouds, atmosphere and surface.]]
[[Heat]] is defined in physics as the transfer of [[thermal energy]] across a well-defined boundary around a [[thermodynamic system]]. The [[thermodynamic free energy]] is the amount of work that a thermodynamic system can perform. [[Enthalpy]] is a [[thermodynamic potential]], designated by the letter "H", that is the sum of the [[internal energy]] of the system (U) plus the product of [[pressure]] (P) and [[volume]] (V). [[Joule]] is a unit to quantify [[energy]], work, or the amount of heat.

Heat transfer is a [[process function]] (or path function), as opposed to [[functions of state]]; therefore, the amount of heat transferred in a [[thermodynamic process]] that changes the [[thermodynamic state|state]] of a [[thermodynamic system|system]] depends on how that process occurs, not only the net difference between the initial and final states of the process.

Thermodynamic and [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]] heat transfer is calculated with the [[heat transfer coefficient]], the [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] between the [[heat flux]] and the thermodynamic driving force for the flow of heat. Heat flux is a quantitative, vectorial representation of heat-flow through a surface.&lt;ref name=NJIT&gt;{{cite web |publisher=New Jersey Institute of Technology, Chemical Engineering Departement |title=B.S. Chemical Engineering |url=http://catalog.njit.edu/undergraduate/programs/chemicalengineering.php |accessdate=9 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210121252/http://catalog.njit.edu/undergraduate/programs/chemicalengineering.php |archivedate=10 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In engineering contexts, the term ''heat'' is taken as synonymous to thermal energy. This usage has its origin in the [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot#The second law of thermodynamics|historical interpretation]] of heat as a fluid (''Caloric'') that can be transferred by various causes,&lt;ref name=lienhard&gt;

[[Thermal engineering]] concerns the generation, use, conversion, and exchange of heat transfer. As such, heat transfer is involved in almost every sector of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=R. A. |year=2012 |title=Socioeconomic impacts of heat transfer research |journal=International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer |volume=39 |issue=10 |pages=1467–1473 |doi=10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2012.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms, such as [[thermal conduction]], [[convective heat transfer|thermal convection]], [[thermal radiation]], and transfer of energy by [[phase changes]].

==Mechanisms==
The fundamental modes of heat transfer are:

;[[Advection]]
: Advection is the transport mechanism of a [[fluid]] from one location to another, and is dependent on [[Motion (physics)|motion]] and [[momentum]] of that fluid.
;[[Thermal conduction|Conduction]] or [[Heat conduction|diffusion]] 
: The transfer of energy between objects that are in physical contact. [[Thermal conductivity]] is the property of a material to conduct heat and evaluated primarily in terms of [[Heat conduction#Fourier.27s law|Fourier's Law]] for heat conduction.
;[[Convective heat transfer|Convection]]
: The transfer of energy between an object and its environment, due to fluid motion. The average temperature is a reference for evaluating properties related to convective heat transfer.
;[[Thermal radiation|Radiation]]
: The transfer of energy by the emission of [[electromagnetic radiation]].

===Advection===
By transferring matter, energy—including thermal energy—is moved by the physical transfer of a hot or cold object from one place to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mass transfer |url=https://www.thermalfluidscentral.org/encyclopedia/index.php/Mass_Transfer |work=Thermal-FluidsPedia |publisher=Thermal Fluids Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be as simple as placing hot water in a bottle and heating a bed, or the movement of an iceberg in changing ocean currents. A practical example is [[thermal hydraulics]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} This can be described by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;Q=v \rho c_p \Delta T&lt;/math&gt;

where 
*Q is heat flux (W/m²), 
*ρ is density (kg/m³), 
*&lt;math&gt;c_p&lt;/math&gt; is heat capacity at constant pressure (J/kg·K), 
*ΔT is the change in temperature (K), 
*&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is velocity (m/s).

===Conduction===
{{main|Thermal conduction}}
On a microscopic scale, heat conduction occurs as hot, rapidly moving or vibrating atoms and molecules interact with neighboring atoms and molecules, transferring some of their energy (heat) to these neighboring particles. In other words, heat is transferred by conduction when adjacent atoms vibrate against one another, or as electrons move from one atom to another. Conduction is the most significant means of heat transfer within a solid or between solid objects in [[thermal contact]]. Fluids—especially gases—are less conductive. [[Thermal contact conductance]] is the study of heat conduction between solid bodies in contact.&lt;ref name=Abbott&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=J.M. |last2=Smith |first2=H.C. |last3=Van Ness |first3=M.M. |title=Introduction to Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=Boston, Montreal |isbn=0-07-310445-0 |edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of heat transfer from one place to another place without the movement of particles is called conduction. Example: Heat transfer through Metal rods.{{clarify|date=December 2016}} ''Steady state conduction'' (see [[Fourier's law]]) is a form of conduction that happens when the temperature difference driving the conduction is constant, so that after an equilibration time, the spatial distribution of temperatures in the conducting object does not change any further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Heat conduction |url=https://www.thermalfluidscentral.org/encyclopedia/index.php/Heat_Conduction |work=Thermal-FluidsPedia |publisher=Thermal Fluids Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; In steady state conduction, the amount of heat entering a section is equal to amount of heat coming out.&lt;ref name="Abbott"/&gt;

''Transient conduction'' (see [[Heat equation]]) occurs when the temperature within an object changes as a function of time. Analysis of transient systems is more complex and often calls for the application of approximation theories or numerical analysis by computer.&lt;ref name="Abbott"/&gt;

===Convection===
{{main|Convection}}
The flow of fluid may be forced by external processes, or sometimes (in gravitational fields) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid (for example in a fire plume), thus influencing its own transfer. The latter process is often called "natural convection". All convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion, as well. Another form of convection is forced convection. In this case the fluid is forced to flow by using a pump, fan or other mechanical means.

[[Convective heat transfer]], or convection, is the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of [[fluids]], a process that is essentially the transfer of heat via [[mass transfer]]. Bulk motion of fluid enhances heat transfer in many physical situations, such as (for example) between a solid surface and the fluid.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convection is usually the dominant form of heat transfer in liquids and gases. Although sometimes discussed as a third method of heat transfer, convection is usually used to describe the combined effects of heat conduction within the fluid (diffusion) and heat transference by bulk fluid flow streaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Convective heat transfer |url=https://www.thermalfluidscentral.org/encyclopedia/index.php/Convective_Heat_Transfer |work=Thermal-FluidsPedia |publisher=Thermal Fluids Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of transport by fluid streaming is known as advection, but pure advection is a term that is generally associated only with mass transport in fluids, such as advection of pebbles in a river. In the case of heat transfer in fluids, where transport by advection in a fluid is always also accompanied by transport via heat diffusion (also known as heat conduction) the process of heat convection is understood to refer to the sum of heat transport by advection and diffusion/conduction.

Free, or natural, convection occurs when bulk fluid motions (streams and currents) are caused by buoyancy forces that result from density variations due to variations of temperature in the fluid. ''Forced'' convection is a term used when the streams and currents in the fluid are induced by external means—such as fans, stirrers, and pumps—creating an artificially induced convection current.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Convection-cooling====
{{See also |Nusselt number}}
Convective cooling is sometimes described as [[Convective heat transfer#Newton's law of cooling|Newton's law of cooling]]: 
{{Quotation|''The rate of heat loss of a body is proportional to the temperature difference between the body and its surroundings''.}} However, by definition, the validity of Newton's law of Cooling requires that the rate of heat loss from convection be a linear function of ("proportional to") the temperature difference that drives heat transfer, and in convective cooling this is sometimes not the case. In general, convection is not linearly dependent on temperature gradients, and in some cases is strongly nonlinear. In these cases, Newton's law does not apply.

===Convection vs. conduction===
In a body of fluid that is heated from underneath its container, conduction and convection can be considered to compete for dominance. If heat conduction is too great, fluid moving down by convection is heated by conduction so fast that its downward movement will be stopped due to its [[buoyancy]], while fluid moving up by convection is cooled by conduction so fast that its driving buoyancy will diminish. On the other hand, if heat conduction is very low, a large temperature gradient may be formed and convection might be very strong.

The [[Rayleigh number]] (&lt;math&gt;\rm Ra &lt;/math&gt;) is the product of the Grashof (&lt;math&gt;\rm Gr &lt;/math&gt;) and Prandtl (&lt;math&gt;\rm Pr &lt;/math&gt;) numbers. It is a measure which determines the relative strength of conduction and convection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Incropera |first1=Frank P. |display-authors=etal |date=2012 |title=Fundamentals of heat and mass transfer |page=603 |edition=7th |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-64615-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Ra}=\mathrm{Gr}\cdot\mathrm{Pr}=\frac{g \Delta \rho L^3} {\mu \alpha}=\frac{g \beta \Delta T L^3} {\nu \alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

where
*''g'' is acceleration due to gravity,
*ρ is the density with &lt;math&gt;\Delta \rho&lt;/math&gt; being the density difference between the lower and upper ends,
*μ is the [[dynamic viscosity]],
*α is the [[Thermal diffusivity]],
*β is the volume [[thermal expansivity]] (sometimes denoted ''α'' elsewhere),
*''T'' is the temperature, 
*ν is the [[kinematic viscosity]], and
*''L'' is characteristic length.

The Rayleigh number can be understood as the ratio between the rate of heat transfer by convection to the rate of heat transfer by conduction; or, equivalently, the ratio between the corresponding timescales (i.e. conduction timescale divided by convection timescale), up to a numerical factor. This can be seen as follows, where all calculations are up to numerical factors depending on the geometry of the system.

The buoyancy force driving the convection is roughly &lt;math&gt;g \Delta \rho L^3&lt;/math&gt;, so the corresponding pressure is roughly &lt;math&gt;g \Delta \rho L &lt;/math&gt;. In [[steady state]], this is canceled by the shear stress due to viscosity, and therefore roughly equals &lt;math&gt;\mu V/L=\mu /T_{\rm conv} &lt;/math&gt;, where ''V'' is the typical fluid velocity due to convection and &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm conv}&lt;/math&gt; the order of its timescale.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The conduction timescale, on the other hand, is of the order of &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm cond}=L^2/ \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

Convection occurs when the Rayleigh number is above 1,000–2,000.

===Radiation===
[[File:Hot metalwork.jpg|thumb|left|Red-hot iron object, transferring heat to the surrounding environment through thermal radiation]]
[[Thermal radiation]] occurs through a [[vacuum]] or any [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] [[Optical medium|medium]] ([[solid]] or [[fluid]] or [[gas]]). It is the transfer of energy by means of [[photons]] in [[electromagnetic waves]] governed by the same laws.&lt;ref name=Geankoplis /&gt;

[[Thermal radiation]] is energy emitted by matter as electromagnetic waves, due to the pool of [[thermal energy]] in all matter with a temperature above [[absolute zero]]. Thermal radiation propagates without the presence of matter through the [[vacuum]] of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radiation |url=https://www.thermalfluidscentral.org/encyclopedia/index.php/Radiation |work=Thermal-FluidsPedia |publisher=Thermal Fluids Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal radiation is a direct result of the random movements of atoms and molecules in matter. Since these atoms and molecules are composed of charged particles ([[proton]]s and [[electron]]s), their movement results in the emission of [[electromagnetic radiation]], which carries energy away from the surface.

The [[Stefan-Boltzmann equation]], which describes the rate of transfer of radiant energy, is as follows for an object in a vacuum :

:&lt;math&gt; Q=\epsilon \sigma T^4. &lt;/math&gt;

For radiative transfer between two objects, the equation is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; Q=\epsilon \sigma (T_a^4 - T_b^4), &lt;/math&gt;

where 
*''Q'' is the heat flux, 
*ε is the [[emissivity]] (unity for a [[black body]]), 
*σ is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]], and 
*''T'' is the absolute temperature (in [[kelvin]]s or [[degrees Rankine]]).
Radiation is typically only important for very hot objects, or for objects with a large temperature difference.

Radiation from the sun, or solar radiation, can be harvested for heat and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mojiri |first1=A |year=2013 |title=Spectral beam splitting for efficient conversion of solar energy—A review |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=28 |issue=|pages=654–663 |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2013.08.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike conductive and convective forms of heat transfer, thermal radiation can be concentrated in a small spot by using reflecting mirrors, which is exploited in [[concentrating solar power]] generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=Robert A. |last2=Phelan |first2=Patrick E. |last3=Otanicar |first3=Todd P. |last4=Walker |first4=Chad A. |last5=Nguyen |first5=Monica |last6=Trimble |first6=Steven |last7=Prasher |first7=Ravi |title=Applicability of nanofluids in high flux solar collectors |url=http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&amp;context=mech_fac |journal=Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy |date=March 2011 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=023104 |doi=10.1063/1.3571565}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the sunlight reflected from mirrors heats the [[PS10 solar power tower]] and during the day it can heat water to {{convert|285|°C|°F}}.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Phase transition==
[[Image:Lightning in Arlington.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Lightning]] is a highly visible form of [[energy]] transfer and is an example of plasma present at Earth's surface. Typically, lightning discharges 30,000 amperes at up to 100 million volts, and emits light, radio waves, X-rays and even gamma rays.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/rhessi_tgf.html Flashes in the Sky: Earth's Gamma-Ray Bursts Triggered by Lightning]&lt;/ref&gt; Plasma temperatures in lightning can approach 28,000 kelvins (27,726.85 °C) (49,940.33 °F) and electron densities may exceed 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.]]
[[Phase transition]] or phase change, takes place in a [[thermodynamic system]] from one phase or [[state of matter]] to another one by heat transfer. Phase change examples are the melting of ice or the boiling of water.
The [[Mason equation]] explains the growth of a water droplet based on the effects of heat transport on [[evaporation]] and condensation.

Phase transitions involve the [[State of matter#The four fundamental states|four fundamental states of matter]]:
*[[Solid]] – Deposition, freezing and solid to solid transformation.
*[[Gas]] – Boiling / evaporation, [[Plasma recombination|recombination ]]/ [[deionization]], and [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]].
*[[Liquid]] – Condensation and [[Melting|melting / fusion]].
*[[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] – [[Ionization]].

===Boiling===
[[Image:Kochendes wasser02.jpg|thumb|left|Nucleate boiling of water.]]
The [[boiling point]] of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=David.E. Goldberg |title=3,000 Solved Problems in Chemistry |edition=1st |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1988 |isbn=0-07-023684-4 |at=Section 17.43, page 321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Louis Theodore, R. Ryan Dupont and Kumar Ganesan (Editors) |title=Pollution Prevention: The Waste Management Approach to the 21st Century |publisher=CRC Press |year=1999 |isbn=1-56670-495-2 |at=Section 27, page 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the liquid [[Evaporation|evaporates]] resulting in an abrupt change in vapor volume.

Saturation temperature means boiling point. The saturation temperature is the temperature for a corresponding saturation pressure at which a liquid boils into its vapor phase. The liquid can be said to be saturated with thermal energy. Any addition of thermal energy results in a phase transition.

At standard atmospheric pressure and '''low temperatures''', no boiling occurs and the heat transfer rate is controlled by the usual single-phase mechanisms. As the surface temperature is increased, local boiling occurs and vapor bubbles nucleate, grow into the surrounding cooler fluid, and collapse. This is ''sub-cooled nucleate boiling'', and is a very efficient heat transfer mechanism. At high bubble generation rates, the bubbles begin to interfere and the heat flux no longer increases rapidly with surface temperature (this is the [[Nucleate boiling#Departure from nucleate boiling|departure from nucleate boiling]], or DNB).

At similar standard atmospheric pressure and '''high temperatures''', the hydrodynamically-quieter regime of [[Boiling#Film|film boiling]] is reached. Heat fluxes across the stable vapor layers are low, but rise slowly with temperature. Any contact between fluid and the surface that may be seen probably leads to the extremely rapid nucleation of a fresh vapor layer ("spontaneous [[nucleation]]"). At higher temperatures still, a maximum in the heat flux is reached (the [[critical heat flux]], or CHF).

The [[Leidenfrost Effect]] demonstrates how nucleate boiling slows heat transfer due to gas bubbles on the heater's surface. As mentioned, gas-phase thermal conductivity is much lower than liquid-phase thermal conductivity, so the outcome is a kind of "gas thermal barrier".

===Condensation===
[[Condensation]] occurs when a vapor is cooled and changes its phase to a liquid. During condensation, the [[latent heat of vaporization]] must be released. The amount of the heat is the same as that absorbed during vaporization at the same fluid pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Tro |first=Nivaldo |year=2008 |title=Chemistry: A Molecular Approach |publisher=Prentice Hall |pages=479 |isbn=|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |quote=When a substance condenses from a gas to a liquid, the same amount of heat is involved, but the heat is emitted rather than absorbed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several types of condensation:
* Homogeneous condensation, as during a formation of fog.
* Condensation in direct contact with subcooled liquid.
* Condensation on direct contact with a cooling wall of a heat exchanger: This is the most common mode used in industry:
** Filmwise condensation is when a liquid film is formed on the subcooled surface, and usually occurs when the liquid wets the surface.
** Dropwise condensation is when liquid drops are formed on the subcooled surface, and usually occurs when the liquid does not wet the surface.
:Dropwise condensation is difficult to sustain reliably; therefore, industrial equipment is normally designed to operate in filmwise condensation mode.

===Melting===
[[File:Melting icecubes.gif|thumb|Ice melting]]
[[Melting]] is a thermal process that results in the phase transition of a substance from a [[solid]] to a [[liquid]]. The [[internal energy]] of a substance is increased, typically with heat or pressure, resulting in a rise of its temperature to the [[melting point]], at which the ordering of ionic or molecular entities in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state and the solid liquefies. Molten substances generally have reduced viscosity with elevated temperature; an exception to this maxim is the element [[sulfur]], whose viscosity increases to a point due to [[polymerization]] and then decreases with higher temperatures in its molten state.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan (2011) ''Sulfur'', Encyclopedia of Earth, eds. A. Jorgensen and C. J. Cleveland, National Council for Science and the environment, Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modeling approaches==
Heat transfer can be modeled in the following ways.

===Climate models===
[[Climate models]] study the [[Thermal radiation|radiant heat transfer]] by using quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice.

===Heat equation===
The [[heat equation]] is an important [[partial differential equation]] that describes the distribution of heat (or variation in temperature) in a given region over time. In some cases, exact solutions of the equation are available;&lt;ref name="Wendl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wendl |first=M. C. |date=2012 |title=Theoretical Foundations of Conduction and Convection Heat Transfer |url=http://wendl.weebly.com/textbook.html |location=|publisher=Wendl Foundation |page=|isbn=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other cases the equation must be solved numerically using [[Computational fluid dynamics|computational methods]].

===Lumped system analysis===
Lumped system analysis often reduces the complexity of the equations to one first-order linear differential equation, in which case heating and cooling are described by a simple exponential solution, often referred to as [[Newton's law of cooling]].

System analysis by the [[lumped capacitance model]] is a common approximation in transient conduction that may be used whenever heat conduction within an object is much faster than heat conduction across the boundary of the object. This is a method of approximation that reduces one aspect of the transient conduction system—that within the object—to an equivalent steady state system. That is, the method assumes that the temperature within the object is completely uniform, although its value may be changing in time.

In this method, the ratio of the conductive heat resistance within the object to the convective heat transfer resistance across the object's boundary, known as the ''[[Biot number]]'', is calculated. For small Biot numbers, the approximation of ''spatially uniform temperature within the object'' can be used: it can be presumed that heat transferred into the object has time to uniformly distribute itself, due to the lower resistance to doing so, as compared with the resistance to heat entering the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to simplify for small Biot numbers |url=http://www.pirobloc.com/en/blog-en/how-to-simplify-for-small-biot-numbers |accessdate=December 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engineering==
[[File:Nelson tulsa test.jpg|thumb|right|Heat exposure as part of a fire test for firestop products]]
Heat transfer has broad application to the functioning of numerous devices and systems. Heat-transfer principles may be used to preserve, increase, or decrease temperature in a wide variety of circumstances.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Heat transfer methods are used in numerous disciplines, such as [[automotive engineering]], [[thermal management of electronic devices and systems]], [[HVAC|climate control]], [[thermal insulation|insulation]], [[process (engineering)|materials processing]], and [[power station]] engineering.

===Insulation, radiance and resistance===
[[Thermal insulation|Thermal insulators]] are materials specifically designed to reduce the flow of heat by limiting conduction, convection, or both. [[Thermal resistance]] is a heat property and the measurement by which an object or material resists to heat flow (heat per time unit or thermal resistance) to temperature difference.

[[Radiance]] or spectral radiance are measures of the quantity of radiation that passes through or is emitted. [[Radiant barrier]]s are materials that [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]] radiation, and therefore reduce the flow of heat from radiation sources. Good insulators are not necessarily good radiant barriers, and vice versa. Metal, for instance, is an excellent reflector and a poor insulator.

The effectiveness of a radiant barrier is indicated by its '''reflectivity''', which is the fraction of radiation reflected. A material with a high reflectivity (at a given wavelength) has a low emissivity (at that same wavelength), and vice versa. At any specific wavelength, reflectivity=1 - emissivity. An ideal radiant barrier would have a reflectivity of 1, and would therefore reflect 100 percent of incoming radiation. [[Vacuum flasks]], or Dewars, are [[silvered]] to approach this ideal. In the vacuum of space, satellites use [[multi-layer insulation]], which consists of many layers of aluminized (shiny) [[Mylar]] to greatly reduce radiation heat transfer and control satellite temperature.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Devices===
[[Image:heat engine.png|300px|thumb|right|Schematic flow of energy in a heat engine.]]
A [[heat engine]] is a system that performs the conversion of a flow of [[thermal energy]] (heat) to [[mechanical energy]] to perform [[mechanical work]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamentals of Classical Thermodynamics'', 3rd ed. p. 159, (1985) by G. J. Van Wylen and R. E. Sonntag: "A heat engine may be defined as a device that operates in a thermodynamic cycle and does a certain amount of net positive work as a result of heat transfer from a high-temperature body and to a low-temperature body. Often the term heat engine is used in a broader sense to include all devices that produce work, either through heat transfer or combustion, even though the device does not operate in a thermodynamic cycle. The internal-combustion engine and the gas turbine are examples of such devices, and calling these heat engines is an acceptable use of the term."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mechanical efficiency of heat engines'', p. 1 (2007) by James R. Senf: "Heat engines are made to provide mechanical energy from thermal energy."&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[thermocouple]] is a temperature-measuring device and widely used type of temperature sensor for measurement and control, and can also be used to convert heat into electric power.

A [[thermoelectric cooler]] is a solid state electronic device that pumps (transfers) heat from one side of the device to the other when electric current is passed through it. It is based on the [[Peltier effect]].

A [[thermal diode]] or [[thermal rectifier]] is a device that causes heat to flow preferentially in one direction.

====Heat exchangers====
A [[heat exchanger]] is used for more efficient heat transfer or to dissipate heat. Heat exchangers are widely used in [[refrigeration]], [[air conditioning]], [[space heating]], [[power generation]], and chemical processing. One common example of a heat exchanger is a car's radiator, in which the hot [[coolant|coolant fluid]] is cooled by the flow of air over the radiator's surface.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Common types of heat exchanger flows include parallel flow, counter flow, and cross flow. In parallel flow, both fluids move in the same direction while transferring heat; in counter flow, the fluids move in opposite directions; and in cross flow, the fluids move at [[right angle]]s to each other. Common constructions for heat exchanger include shell and tube, [[Heat exchanger#Double pipe heat exchanger|double pipe]], extruded finned pipe, spiral fin pipe, u-tube, and stacked plate.{{Elucidate|date=November 2010}}

A [[heat sink]] is a component that transfers heat generated within a solid material to a fluid medium, such as air or a liquid. Examples of heat sinks are the heat exchangers used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems or the radiator in a car. A [[heat pipe]] is another heat-transfer device that combines thermal conductivity and phase transition to efficiently transfer heat between two solid interfaces.

==Applications==

===Architecture===
[[Efficient energy use]] is the goal to reduce the amount of energy required in heating or cooling. In architecture, condensation and [[air current]]s can cause cosmetic or structural damage. An [[energy audit]] can help to assess the implementation of recommended corrective procedures. For instance, insulation improvements, air sealing of structural leaks or the addition of energy-efficient windows and doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EnergySavers: Tips on Saving Money &amp; Energy at Home |url=http://www.energysavers.gov/pdfs/energy_savers.pdf |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |accessdate=March 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Smart meter]] is a device that records electric energy consumption in intervals. 
* [[Thermal transmittance]] is the rate of transfer of heat through a structure divided by the difference in temperature across the structure. It is expressed in watts per square meter per kelvin, or W/(m²K). Well-insulated parts of a building have a low thermal transmittance, whereas poorly-insulated parts of a building have a high thermal transmittance.
* [[Thermostat]] is a device to monitor and control temperature.

===Climate engineering===
{{See also |Anthropogenic heat}}
[[File:Biochar.jpg|thumb|300px|An example application in climate engineering includes the creation of [[Biochar]] through the [[pyrolysis]] process. Thus, storing greenhouse gases in carbon reduces the radiative forcing capacity in the atmosphere, causing more long-wave ([[infrared]]) radiation out to Space.]]
[[Climate engineering]] consists of [[carbon dioxide removal]] and [[solar radiation management]]. Since the amount of [[carbon dioxide]] determines the [[radiative balance]] of Earth atmosphere, carbon dioxide removal techniques can be applied to reduce the [[radiative forcing]]. Solar radiation management is the attempt to absorb less solar radiation to offset the effects of [[greenhouse gases]].

===Greenhouse effect===
[[File:The green house effect.svg|300px|thumb|A representation of the exchanges of energy between the source (the [[Sun]]), the Earth's surface, the [[Earth's atmosphere]], and the ultimate sink [[outer space]]. The ability of the atmosphere to capture and recycle energy emitted by the Earth surface is the defining characteristic of the greenhouse effect.]]
The [[greenhouse effect]] is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary surface is absorbed by atmospheric greenhouse gases, and is re-radiated in all directions. Since part of this re-radiation is back towards the surface and the lower atmosphere, it results in an elevation of the average surface temperature above what it would be in the absence of the gases.

===Heat transfer in the human body===
{{See also |Wet-bulb temperature}}
The principles of heat transfer in engineering systems can be applied to the human body in order to determine how the body transfers heat. Heat is produced in the body by the continuous metabolism of nutrients which provides energy for the systems of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, Carl; Bibb, Lewis. (1913). "The Human Body and Its Enemies". World Book Co., p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; The human body must maintain a consistent internal temperature in order to maintain healthy bodily functions. Therefore, excess heat must be dissipated from the body to keep it from overheating. When a person engages in elevated levels of physical activity, the body requires additional fuel which increases the metabolic rate and the rate of heat production. The body must then use additional methods to remove the additional heat produced in order to keep the internal temperature at a healthy level.

[[Convective heat transfer|Heat transfer by convection]] is driven by the movement of fluids over the surface of the body. This convective fluid can be either a liquid or a gas. For heat transfer from the outer surface of the body, the convection mechanism is dependent on the surface area of the body, the velocity of the air, and the temperature gradient between the surface of the skin and the ambient air.&lt;ref name="Cengel, Yunus A 2010"&gt;Cengel, Yunus A. and Ghajar, Afshin J. "Heat and Mass Transfer: Fundamentals and Applications", McGraw-Hill, 4th Edition, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The normal temperature of the body is approximately 37&amp;nbsp;°C. Heat transfer occurs more readily when the temperature of the surroundings is significantly less than the normal body temperature. This concept explains why a person feels “cold” when not enough covering is worn when exposed to a cold environment. Clothing can be considered an insulator which provides thermal resistance to heat flow over the covered portion of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Tao, Xiaoming. "Smart fibres, fabrics, and clothing", Woodhead Publishing, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; This thermal resistance causes the temperature on the surface of the clothing to be less than the temperature on the surface of the skin. This smaller temperature gradient between the surface temperature and the ambient temperature will cause a lower rate of heat transfer than if the skin were not covered.

In order to ensure that one portion of the body is not significantly hotter than another portion, heat must be distributed evenly through the bodily tissues. Blood flowing through blood vessels acts as a convective fluid and helps to prevent any buildup of excess heat inside the tissues of the body. This flow of blood through the vessels can be modeled as pipe flow in an engineering system. The heat carried by the blood is determined by the temperature of the surrounding tissue, the diameter of the blood vessel, the [[Viscosity|thickness of the fluid]], velocity of the flow, and the heat transfer coefficient of the blood. The velocity, blood vessel diameter, and the fluid thickness can all be related with the [[Reynolds Number]], a dimensionless number used in fluid mechanics to characterize the flow of fluids.

[[Latent heat]] loss, also known as evaporative heat loss, accounts for a large fraction of heat loss from the body. When the core temperature of the body increases, the body triggers sweat glands in the skin to bring additional moisture to the surface of the skin. The liquid is then transformed into vapor which removes heat from the surface of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilmore|first1=Jack H.|last2=Costill|first2=David L.|last3=Kenney|first3=Larry|title=Physiology of Sport and Exercise|date=2008|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=9781450477673|page=256|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of evaporation heat loss is directly related to the vapor pressure at the skin surface and the amount of moisture present on the skin.&lt;ref name="Cengel, Yunus A 2010"/&gt; Therefore, the maximum of heat transfer will occur when the skin is completely wet. The body continuously loses water by evaporation but the most significant amount of heat loss occurs during periods of increased physical activity.

===Cooling techniques===

====Evaporative cooling====
[[File:Air cooler.jpg|right|thumbnail|A traditional air cooler in [[Mirzapur]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]]]
[[Evaporative cooling]] happens when water vapor is added to the surrounding air. The energy needed to evaporate the water is taken from the air in the form of sensible heat and converted into latent heat, while the air remains at a constant [[enthalpy]]. Latent heat describes the amount of heat that is needed to evaporate the liquid; this heat comes from the liquid itself and the surrounding gas and surfaces. The greater the difference between the two temperatures, the greater the evaporative cooling effect. When the temperatures are the same, no net evaporation of water in air occurs; thus, there is no cooling effect.

====Laser cooling====
In [[quantum physics]], [[laser cooling]] is used to achieve temperatures of near [[absolute zero]] (−273.15&amp;nbsp;°C, −459.67&amp;nbsp;°F) of atomic and molecular samples to observe unique [[quantum effects]] that can only occur at this heat level.

* [[Doppler cooling]] is the most common method of laser cooling. 
* [[Sympathetic cooling]] is a process in which particles of one type cool particles of another type. Typically, atomic ions that can be directly laser-cooled are used to cool nearby ions or atoms. This technique allows cooling of ions and atoms that cannot be laser cooled directly.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

====Magnetic cooling====
{{main|Magnetic refrigeration|Magnetic evaporative cooling}}
[[Magnetic evaporative cooling]] is a process for lowering the temperature of a group of atoms, after pre-cooled by methods such as laser cooling. Magnetic refrigeration cools below 0.3K, by making use of the [[Magnetic refrigeration#The magnetocaloric effect|magnetocaloric effect]].

====Radiative cooling====
[[Radiative cooling]] is the process by which a body loses heat by radiation. [[Earth's energy budget#Outgoing energy|Outgoing]] energy is an important effect in the [[Earth's energy budget#Outgoing energy|Earth's energy budget]]. In the case of the Earth-atmosphere system, it refers to the process by which long-wave (infrared) radiation is emitted to balance the absorption of short-wave (visible) energy from the Sun. Convective transport of heat and evaporative transport of latent heat both remove heat from the surface and redistribute it in the atmosphere.

===Thermal energy storage===
[[Thermal energy storage]] includes technologies for collecting and [[Energy storage|storing energy]] for later use. It may be employed to balance energy demand between day and nighttime. The thermal reservoir may be maintained at a temperature above or below that of the ambient environment. Applications include space heating, domestic or process hot water systems, or generating electricity.

'''Horatio Emmons Hale''' (May 3, 1817 – December 28, 1896) was an American-Canadian [[ethnologist]], [[philologist]] and businessman who studied language as a key for classifying ancient peoples and being able to trace their migrations.  He was the first to discover that the [[Tutelo language]] of [[Virginia]] belonged to the [[Sioux|Siouan]] family, and to identify the [[Cherokee language]] as a member of the [[Iroquois|Iroquoian]] family of languages. In addition, he published a work ''Iroquois Book of Rites'' (1883), based on interpreting the Iroquois [[wampum belt]]s, as well as his studies with tribal leaders.

After his marriage to a Canadian woman in 1855, Hale moved to Ontario.  He continued to publish articles in American scholarly journals, while living in Canada for the rest of his life.

==Early life and education==
Horatio was born on 3 May 1817, at [[Newport, New Hampshire]], in the United States, was the son of David Hale, a lawyer, and of [[Sarah Josepha Hale|Sarah Josepha]], who, after the death of her husband, turned to writing and became a prominent magazine editor. 
Entering [[Harvard College]] in 1833, Hale showed a marked faculty for languages. 
His first essay in original work appeared the next year, and attracted the attention of the college authorities. 
It consisted of an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Algonkin vocabulary]], which he gathered from a band of Indians who had camped on the college grounds. 
Three years later, when the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] to little-known portions of the globe was organised under [[Charles Wilkes]], Hale was recommended, while yet an undergraduate, for the post of ethnologist and philologist, and obtained the appointment. 
From 1838 to 1842, he was employed in the work of the expedition, visiting [[South America]], [[Australasia]], [[Polynesia]], and North-western America, then known as [[Oregon]]. 
From this point he returned overland. 
The [[Hale Passage]]s of [[Puget Sound]] were named in recognition of his service to the expedition.&lt;ref name=majors&gt;{{Citation| last = Majors | first = Harry M. | title = Exploring Washington | publisher = Van Winkle Publishing Co | year = 1975 | pages = 20, 81 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CoWrPQAACAAJ| isbn = 978-0-918664-00-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition went on to Polynesia.  Of the reports of that expedition, Hale prepared the sixth volume, ''Ethnography and Philology'' (1846), which is said to have laid the foundations of the ethnography of [[Polynesia]]. He continued to travel and study abroad.{{sfn|Browning|1901}}
 
Having taken his degree of M. A., Hale made a short tour of Europe, and, on his return, studied law. 
He was admitted to the Chicago bar in 1855. 
In 1856, the Hales moved to [[Clinton, Ontario]], Canada, where he administered the estate of his father-in-law.  He began to involve himself locally in [[real estate development]] and other business and educational endeavours.&lt;ref name=DCBO&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=6139|editor=William N. Fenton|chapter=Hale, Horatio Emmons|title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|volume=12|publisher=University of Toronto/Université Laval|date=2003– }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He continued to reside in Clinton till his death, devoting much attention to the development of the Ontario school system. 
He was influential in introducing co-education of the sexes in high schools and collegiate institutes, in increasing the grants to these institutions, in establishing the normal school system, and in improving the methods of examination.{{sfn|Browning|1901}}
 
The vicinity of the Canadian reserves on the banks of the Thames and Grand River gave Hale ample opportunity for further investigation into American-Indian questions. 
He discovered, and in 1883 published, under the title, ''The Iroquois Book of Rites,'' two Indian manuscripts, dating between 1714 and 1735, which is the only literary American-Indian work extant. 
His judicious introductions, careful translation and editing add much to the value of the work.{{sfn|Browning|1901}}
 
In 1884, at its Montreal meeting, he reorganised the section of anthropology as an independent department of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]]. 
He had already done a like service for the American Association. At the request of the British committee, he undertook the supervision of the anthropological section's work in the Canadian North-west and British Columbia. 
The reports, which are very elaborate, appeared in the published 'Proceedings' from 1885 to 1897. 
Continuing a member of the committee, he was asked to accept the position of vice-president at the association's meeting in Toronto (1896), but declined on the ground of ill-health.{{sfn|Browning|1901}}
 
Among other learned bodies Hale was an honorary fellow of the [[Anthropological Institute]] of Great Britain, to which he contributed his latest papers.{{sfn|Browning|1901}}

He died on 29 December 1896 at Clinton, Ontario.{{sfn|Browning|1901}}

==Family==
In 1854, at Jersey city in the state of New Jersey, he married Margaret, daughter of William Pugh, formerly justice of the peace for the township of Goderich in the county of Huron, Canada West.

==Native American studies==
Hale returned to his study of First Nations and Native Americans.  
He was mentored by the [[Iroquois]] chiefs [[George Henry Martin Johnson]] and John Fraser, whom he met while visiting the [[Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation]].  
In addition he traveled to the United States to consult with other native informants. Hale documented the oral history and rituals of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]].  
He was assisted in interpreting the group's [[Wampum|wampum belts]], which recounted their history.&lt;ref name="DCBO"/&gt; His work resulted in his publishing ''Iroquois Book of Rites'' (1883). He also studied the Iroquois languages, determining that Mohawk was the oldest and that the [[Laurentian language|Laurentian]] languages were also [[Iroquoian]].&lt;ref name=DCBO/&gt;

Hale made many valuable contributions to the science of ethnology, attracting attention particularly by his theory of the origin of the diversities of [[human language]]s and [[dialect]]s—a theory suggested by his study of child-languages, or the languages invented by little children. He also emphasized the importance of languages as tests of mental capacity, demonstrating that Native American languages were complex and had a high capacity for classification.

He used language as a criterion for the classification of human groups. He was the first to discover that the [[Tutelo language]] of [[Virginia]] belonged to the [[Sioux|Siouan]] family, as well as the first to identify the [[Cherokee language]] as a member of the [[Iroquois|Iroquoian]] family of languages.

Besides writing numerous magazine articles, Hale read a number of valuable papers before learned societies. These include:
* ''Hiawatha and the Iroquois Confederacy'' (1881) (available at Project Gutenberg)
* ''Indian Migrations as Evidenced by Language'' (1882)
* ''The Origin of Languages and the Antiquity of Speaking Man'' (1886)
* ''The Development of Language'' (1888)
* ''Language as a Test of Mental Capacity: Being an Attempt to Demonstrate the True Basis of Anthropology'' (1891)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27602">A '''hydrogen-like ion''' is any [[atomic nucleus]] which has one [[electron]] and thus is [[isoelectronic]] with [[hydrogen]]. These ions carry the positive charge &lt;math&gt;e(Z-1)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is the [[atomic number]] of the atom. Examples of hydrogen-like ions are [[Helium|He&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Lithium|Li&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Beryllium|Be&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[Boron|B&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;]]. Because hydrogen-like ions are two-particle systems with an interaction depending only on the distance between the two particles, their (non-relativistic) [[Schrödinger equation]] can be solved in analytic form, as can the (relativistic) [[Dirac equation]]. The solutions are one-electron functions and are referred to as ''hydrogen-like atomic orbitals''.&lt;ref&gt;In quantum chemistry an orbital is synonymous with "a one-electron function", a square integrable function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other systems may also be referred to as "hydrogen-like atoms", such as [[muonium]] (an electron orbiting a [[muon]]), [[positronium]] (an electron and a positron), certain [[exotic atom]]s (formed with other particles), or [[Rydberg atom]]s (in which one electron is in such a high energy state that it sees the rest of the atom practically as a [[point charge]]).

==Schrödinger solution==
In the solution to the Schrödinger equation, which is non-relativistic, hydrogen-like atomic orbitals are [[eigenfunction]]s of the one-electron angular momentum operator '''''L''''' and its ''z'' component ''L''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;. A hydrogen-like atomic orbital is uniquely identified by the values of the [[principal quantum number]] ''n'', the [[Azimuthal quantum number|angular momentum quantum number]] ''l'', and the [[magnetic quantum number]] ''m''. The energy eigenvalues do not depend on ''l'' or ''m'', but solely on ''n''. To these must be added the two-valued [[spin quantum number]] ''m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ±½, setting the stage for the [[Aufbau principle]]. This principle restricts the allowed values of the four quantum numbers in [[electron configuration]]s of more-electron atoms. In hydrogen-like atoms all degenerate orbitals of fixed ''n'' and ''l'', ''m'' and ''s'' varying between certain values (see below) form an [[electron shell|atomic shell]].

The Schrödinger equation of atoms or atomic ions with more than one electron has not been solved analytically, because of the computational difficulty imposed by the Coulomb interaction between the electrons. Numerical methods must be applied in order to obtain (approximate) wavefunctions or other properties from quantum mechanical calculations. Due to the spherical symmetry (of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]), the total angular momentum '''''J''''' of an atom is a conserved quantity. Many numerical procedures start from products of atomic orbitals that are eigenfunctions of the one-electron operators '''''L''''' and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;. The radial parts of these atomic orbitals are sometimes numerical tables or are sometimes [[Slater orbitals]]. By [[angular momentum coupling]] many-electron eigenfunctions of '''''J'''''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (and possibly '''''S'''''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) are constructed.

In quantum chemical calculations hydrogen-like atomic orbitals cannot serve as an expansion basis, because they are not complete. The non-square-integrable continuum (E &gt; 0) states must be included to obtain a complete set, i.e., to span all of one-electron Hilbert space.&lt;ref&gt;This was observed as early as 1928 by E. A. Hylleraas, ''Z. f. Physik'' vol. '''48''', p. 469 (1928). English translation in H. Hettema, ''Quantum Chemistry, Classic Scientific Papers'', p. 81, World Scientific, Singapore (2000). Later it was pointed out again by H. Shull and P.-O. Löwdin, ''J. Chem. Phys.'' vol. '''23''', p. 1362 (1955).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the simplest model, the atomic orbitals of hydrogen-like ions are solutions to the [[particle in a spherically symmetric potential|Schrödinger equation in a spherically symmetric potential]]. In this case, the [[potential]] term is the potential given by [[Coulomb's law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;V(r) = -\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{Ze^2}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Permittivity#Vacuum permittivity|permittivity]] of the vacuum,
* ''Z'' is the [[atomic number]] (number of protons in the nucleus),
* ''e'' is the [[elementary charge]] (charge of an electron),
* ''r'' is the distance of the electron from the nucleus.

After writing the wave function as a product of functions:
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(r, \theta, \phi) = R_{nl}(r)Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)\,&lt;/math&gt;
(in [[spherical coordinates]]), where &lt;math&gt;Y_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; are [[spherical harmonics]], we arrive at the following Schrödinger equation:
:&lt;math&gt;
- \frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \left[{1 \over r^2}{\partial \over \partial r}\left(r^2 {\partial R(r)\over \partial r}\right) - {l(l+1)R(r)\over r^2} \right] + V(r)R(r) = E R(r),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is, approximately, the [[mass]] of the [[electron]] (more accurately, it is the [[reduced mass]] of the system consisting of the electron and the nucleus), and &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced [[Planck constant]].

Different values of ''l'' give solutions with different [[angular momentum]], where ''l'' (a non-negative integer) is the [[quantum number]] of the orbital [[angular momentum]]. The [[magnetic quantum number]] ''m'' (satisfying &lt;math&gt;-l\le m\le l&lt;/math&gt;) is the (quantized) projection of the orbital angular momentum on the ''z''-axis. See [[Particle in a spherically symmetric potential#Hydrogen-like atoms|here]] for the steps leading to the solution of this equation.

===Non-relativistic wavefunction and energy===

[[File:Atomic orbitals n1234 m-eigenstates.png|thumb|300px|right|All &lt;math&gt;\psi_{nlm}&lt;/math&gt; eigenfunctions up to ''n''=4. The solid orbitals enclose the volume above a certain probability density threshold. The colors depict the complex phase.]]

In addition to ''l'' and ''m'', a third integer ''n'' &gt; 0, emerges from the boundary conditions placed on ''R''. The functions ''R'' and ''Y'' that solve the equations above depend on the values of these integers, called ''[[quantum number]]s''. It is customary to subscript the wave functions with the values of the quantum numbers they depend on. The final expression for the normalized wave function is:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_{nlm} = R_{nl}(r)\, Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R_{nl} (r) = \sqrt {{\left ( \frac{2 Z}{n a_{\mu}} \right ) }^3\frac{(n-l-1)!}{2n[(n+l)!]} } e^{- Z r / {n a_{\mu}}} \left ( \frac{2 Z r}{n a_{\mu}} \right )^{l} L_{n-l-1}^{2l+1} \left ( \frac{2 Z r}{n a_{\mu}} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;L_{n-l-1}^{2l+1}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Laguerre polynomials|generalized Laguerre polynomials]] in the definition given [[Laguerre polynomials|here]].
* &lt;math&gt;a_{\mu} = {{4\pi\varepsilon_0\hbar^2}\over{\mu e^2}} = \frac{\hbar c}{\alpha\mu c^2} ={{m_{\mathrm{e}}}\over{\mu}} a_0&lt;/math&gt;
:where α is the [[fine structure constant]]. Here, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced mass of the nucleus-electron system, that is, &lt;math&gt;\mu = {{m_{\mathrm{N}} m_{\mathrm{e}}}\over{m_{\mathrm{N}}+m_{\mathrm{e}}}}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m_{\mathrm{N}}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the nucleus.  Typically, the nucleus is much more massive than the electron, so &lt;math&gt;\mu \approx m_{\mathrm{e}}.&lt;/math&gt; (But for [[positronium]] &lt;math&gt;\mu=m_{\mathrm{e}}/2.&lt;/math&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt; E_{n} = -\left(\frac{Z^2 \mu e^4}{32 \pi^2\epsilon_0^2\hbar^2}\right)\frac{1}{n^2} = -\left(\frac{Z^2\hbar^2}{2\mu a_{\mu}^2}\right)\frac{1}{n^2} = -\frac{\mu c^2Z^2\alpha^2}{2n^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Y_{lm} (\theta,\phi)\,&lt;/math&gt; function is a [[spherical harmonic]].
parity due to angular wave function is &lt;math&gt;{\left ( {-1} \right ) }^l&lt;/math&gt;.

===Quantum numbers===

The quantum numbers ''n'', ''l'' and ''m'' are integers and can have the following values:
:&lt;math&gt;n=1,2,3,4, \dots\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;l=0,1,2,\dots,n-1\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;m=-l,-l+1,\ldots,0,\ldots,l-1,l\,&lt;/math&gt;

For a group-theoretical interpretation of these quantum numbers, see [[Runge–Lenz#Quantum mechanics of the hydrogen atom|this article]]. Among other things, this article gives group-theoretical reasons why &lt;math&gt;l &lt; n\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-l \le m \le \,l &lt;/math&gt;.

===Angular momentum===

Each atomic orbital is associated with an [[angular momentum]] '''L'''. It is a [[Vector (geometric)|vector operator]], and the eigenvalues of its square ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ L&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + L&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + L&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;L^2 Y_{lm} = \hbar^2 l(l+1) Y_{lm} &lt;/math&gt;

The projection of this vector onto an arbitrary direction is [[quantization (physics)|quantized]]. If the arbitrary direction is called ''z'', the quantization is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;L_{\mathrm{z}} Y_{lm} = \hbar m Y_{lm}, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is restricted as described above. Note that ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; commute and have a common eigenstate, which is in accordance with Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]]. Since ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; do not commute with ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, it is not possible to find a state that is an eigenstate of all three components simultaneously. Hence the values of the ''x'' and ''y'' components are not sharp, but are given by a probability function of finite width. The fact that the ''x'' and ''y'' components are not well-determined, implies that the direction of the angular momentum vector is not well determined either, although its component along the ''z''-axis is sharp.

These relations do not give the total angular momentum of the electron. For that, electron [[spin (physics)|spin]] must be included.

This quantization of angular momentum closely parallels that proposed by [[Niels Bohr]] (see [[Bohr model]]) in 1913, with no knowledge of wavefunctions.

===Including spin-orbit interaction===
{{details|Angular momentum coupling}}
In a real atom, the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of a moving electron can interact with the [[electric field]] of the nucleus through relativistic effects, a phenomenon known as [[spin-orbit interaction]]. When one takes this coupling into account, the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] and the [[Angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]] are no longer [[Angular momentum#Conservation of angular momentum|conserved]], which can be pictured by the [[electron]] [[precess]]ing. Therefore, one has to replace the quantum numbers ''l'', ''m'' and the projection of the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] ''m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' by quantum numbers that represent the total angular momentum (including [[Spin (physics)|spin]]), ''j'' and ''m&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', as well as the [[quantum number]] of [[Parity (physics)|parity]].

See the next section on the Dirac equation for a solution that includes the coupling.

==Solution to Dirac equation==
In 1928 in England [[Paul Dirac]] found [[Dirac equation|an equation]] that was fully compatible with [[Special Relativity]]. The equation was solved for hydrogen-like atoms the same year (assuming a simple Coulomb potential around a point charge) by the German [[Walter Gordon (physicist)|Walter Gordon]]. Instead of a single (possibly complex) function as in the Schrödinger equation, one must find four complex functions that make up a [[bispinor]]. The first and second functions (or components of the spinor) correspond (in the usual basis) to spin "up" and spin "down" states, as do the third and fourth components.

The terms "spin up" and "spin down" are relative to a chosen direction, conventionally the z direction. An electron may be in a superposition of spin up and spin down, which corresponds to the spin axis pointing in some other direction. The spin state may depend on location.

An electron in the vicinity of a nucleus necessarily has non-zero amplitudes for the third and fourth components. Far from the nucleus these may be small, but near the nucleus they become large.

The [[eigenfunction]]s of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], which means functions with a definite energy (and which therefore do not evolve except for a phase shift), have energies characterized not by the quantum number ''n'' only (as for the Schrödinger equation), but by ''n'' and a quantum number ''j'', the [[total angular momentum quantum number]]. The quantum number ''j'' determines the sum of the squares of the three angular momenta to be ''j''(''j''+1) (times ''ħ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, see [[Planck constant]]). These angular momenta include both orbital angular momentum (having to do with the angular dependence of ψ) and spin angular momentum (having to do with the spin state). The splitting of the energies of states of the same [[principal quantum number]] ''n'' due to differences in ''j'' is called [[fine structure]]. The total angular momentum quantum number ''j'' ranges from 1/2 to ''n''−1/2.

The orbitals for a given state can be written using two radial functions and two angle functions. The radial functions depend on both the principal quantum number ''n'' and an integer ''k'', defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;k = \begin{cases}
-j-\tfrac 1 2 &amp; \text{if }j=\ell+\tfrac 1 2 \\
j+\tfrac 1 2 &amp; \text{if }j=\ell-\tfrac 1 2
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where ℓ is the [[azimuthal quantum number]] that ranges from 0 to ''n''−1. The angle functions depend on ''k'' and on a quantum number ''m'' which ranges from −''j'' to ''j'' by steps of 1. The states are labeled using the letters S, P, D, F et cetera to stand for states with ℓ equal to 0, 1, 2, 3 et cetera (see [[azimuthal quantum number]]), with a subscript giving ''j''. For instance, the states for ''n''=4 are given in the following table (these would be prefaced by ''n'', for example 4S&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;):

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"

! !! ''m'' = −7/2 !! ''m'' = −5/2!! ''m'' = −3/2!!''m'' = −1/2!!''m'' = 1/2!!''m'' = 3/2!!''m'' = 5/2!!''m'' = 7/2

|}

These can be additionally labeled with a subscript giving ''m''. There are 2''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; states with principal quantum number ''n'', 4''j''+2 of them with any allowed ''j'' except the highest (''j''=''n''−1/2) for which there are only 2''j''+1. Since the orbitals having given values of ''n'' and ''j'' have the same energy according to the Dirac equation, they form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for the space of functions having that energy.

The energy, as a function of ''n'' and |''k''| (equal to ''j''+1/2), is:

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl} E_{n\,j} &amp; = \mu c^2\left(1+\left[\dfrac{Z\alpha}{n-|k|+\sqrt{k^2-Z^2\alpha^2}}\right]^2\right)^{-1/2}\\ &amp;\\&amp; \approx \mu c^2\left\{1-\dfrac{Z^2\alpha^2}{2n^2} \left[1 + \dfrac{Z^2\alpha^2}n\left(\dfrac 1{|k|} - \dfrac 3{4n} \right) \right]\right\} \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

(The energy of course depends on the zero-point used.) Note that if {{mvar|Z}} were able to be more than 137 (higher than any known element) then we would have a negative value inside the square root for the S&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals, which means they would not exist. The Schrödinger solution corresponds to replacing the inner bracket in the second expression by 1. The accuracy of the energy difference between the lowest two hydrogen states calculated from the Schrödinger solution is about 9 [[Parts per million|ppm]] (90 μ[[Electron volt|eV]] too low, out of around 10 eV), whereas the accuracy of the Dirac equation for the same energy difference is about 3 ppm (too high). The Schrödinger solution always puts the states at slightly higher energies than the more accurate Dirac equation. The Dirac equation gives some levels of hydrogen quite accurately (for instance the 4P&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; state is given an energy only about {{val|2|e=-10}} eV too high), others less so (for instance, the 2S&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; level is about {{val|4|e=-6}} eV too low).&lt;ref&gt;Calculated from Table 4.1 in {{cite web|title=The Quantum Theory of the Hydrogen Atom|url=http://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~brezinsk/data/Hydrogenatom.pdf|accessdate=Oct 20, 2013|author=Felix Nendzig|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020180828/http://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~brezinsk/data/Hydrogenatom.pdf|archivedate=Oct 20, 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modifications of the energy due to using the Dirac equation rather than the Schrödinger solution is of the order of α&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and for this reason α is called the [[fine structure constant]].

The solution to the Dirac equation for quantum numbers ''n'', ''k'', and ''m'', is:

&lt;math&gt;\Psi=\begin{pmatrix}
g_{n,k}(r)r^{-1}\Omega_{k,m}(\theta,\phi)\\
if_{n,k}(r)r^{-1}\Omega_{-k,m}(\theta,\phi)
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}
g_{n,k}(r)r^{-1}\sqrt{(k+\tfrac 1 2 -m)/(2k+1)}Y_{k,m-1/2}(\theta,\phi)\\
-g_{n,k}(r)r^{-1}\sgn k\sqrt{(k+\tfrac 1 2 +m)/(2k+1)}Y_{k,m+1/2}(\theta,\phi)\\
if_{n,k}(r)r^{-1}\sqrt{(-k+\tfrac 1 2 -m)/(-2k+1)}Y_{-k,m-1/2}(\theta,\phi)\\
-if_{n,k}(r)r^{-1}\sgn k\sqrt{(-k+\tfrac 1 2 -m)/(-2k+1)}Y_{-k,m+1/2}(\theta,\phi)
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where the Ωs are columns of the two [[spherical harmonics]] functions shown to the right. &lt;math&gt;Y_{a,b}(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; signifies a spherical harmonic function:

:&lt;math&gt;Y_{a,b}(\theta,\phi)= \begin{cases}
(-1)^b\sqrt{\frac{2a+1}{4\pi}\frac{(a-b)!}{(a+b)!}}P_a^b(\cos\theta)e^{ib\phi} &amp; \text{if }a&gt;0\\
Y_{-a-1,b}(\theta,\phi)&amp; \text{if }a&lt;0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;P_a^b&lt;/math&gt; is an [[associated Legendre polynomial]]. (Note that the definition of Ω may involve a spherical harmonic that doesn't exist, like &lt;math&gt;Y_{0,1}&lt;/math&gt;, but the coefficient on it will be zero.)

Here is the behavior of some of these angular functions. The normalization factor is left out to simplify the expressions.

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_{-1,-1/2}\propto\binom 0 1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_{-1,1/2}\propto\binom 1 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_{1,-1/2}\propto\binom{(x-iy)/r}{z/r}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_{1,1/2}\propto\binom{z/r}{(x+iy)/r}&lt;/math&gt;

From these we see that in the S&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; orbital (''k'' = −1), the top two components of Ψ have zero orbital angular momentum like Schrödinger S orbitals, but the bottom two components are orbitals like the Schrödinger P orbitals. In the P&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; solution (''k'' = 1), the situation is reversed. In both cases, the spin of each component compensates for its orbital angular momentum around the ''z'' axis to give the right value for the total angular momentum around the ''z'' axis.

The two Ω spinors obey the relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_{k,m}=\begin{pmatrix}
z/r &amp; (x-iy)/r\\
(x+iy)/r &amp; -z/r
\end{pmatrix}\Omega_{-k,m}&lt;/math&gt;

To write the functions &lt;math&gt;g_{n,k}(r)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_{n,k}(r)&lt;/math&gt; let us define a scaled radius ρ:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho\equiv 2Cr&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{\sqrt{\mu^2c^4-E^2}}{\hbar c}&lt;/math&gt;

where E is the energy (&lt;math&gt;E_{n\,j}&lt;/math&gt;) given above. We also define γ as:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma\equiv\sqrt{k^2-Z^2\alpha^2}&lt;/math&gt;

When ''k'' = −''n'' (which corresponds to the highest ''j'' possible for a given ''n'', such as 1S&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;, 2P&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt;, 3D&lt;sub&gt;5/2&lt;/sub&gt;...), then &lt;math&gt;g_{n,k}(r)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_{n,k}(r)&lt;/math&gt; are:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{n,-n}(r)=A(n+\gamma)\rho^\gamma e^{-\rho/2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f_{n,-n}(r)=AZ\alpha\rho^\gamma e^{-\rho/2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is a normalization constant involving the [[Gamma function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;A=\frac 1{\sqrt{2n(n+\gamma)}}\sqrt\frac C{\gamma\Gamma(2\gamma)}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that because of the factor Zα, ''f''(''r)'' is small compared to ''g''(''r''). Also notice that in this case, the energy is given by

:&lt;math&gt;E_{n,n-1/2}=\frac\gamma n\mu c^2=\sqrt{1-\frac{Z^2\alpha^2}{n^2}}\,\mu c^2&lt;/math&gt;

and the radial decay constant ''C'' by

:&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{Z\alpha}n\frac{\mu c^2}{\hbar c}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the general case (when ''k'' is not −''n''), &lt;math&gt;g_{n,k}(r)\text{ and }f_{n,k}(r)&lt;/math&gt; are based on two [[generalized Laguerre polynomial]]s of order &lt;math&gt;n-|k|-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n-|k|&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{n,k}(r)=A\rho^\gamma e^{-\rho/2}\left(Z\alpha\rho L_{n-|k|-1}^{2\gamma+1}(\rho)+(\gamma-k)\frac{\gamma\mu c^2-kE}{\hbar cC}L_{n-|k|}^{2\gamma-1}(\rho)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f_{n,k}(r)=A\rho^\gamma e^{-\rho/2}\left((\gamma-k)\rho L_{n-|k|-1}^{2\gamma+1}(\rho)+Z\alpha\frac{\gamma\mu c^2-kE}{\hbar cC}L_{n-|k|}^{2\gamma-1}(\rho)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

with ''A'' now defined as

:&lt;math&gt;A=\frac 1{\sqrt{2k(k-\gamma)}}\sqrt{\frac C{n-|k|+\gamma}\frac{(n-|k|-1)!}{\Gamma(n-|k|+2\gamma+1)}\frac 1 2\left(\left(\frac{Ek}{\gamma\mu c^2}\right)^2+\frac{Ek}{\gamma\mu c^2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Again ''f'' is small compared to ''g'' (except at very small ''r'') because when ''k'' is positive the first terms dominate, and α is big compared to γ−''k'', whereas when ''k'' is negative the second terms dominate and α is small compared to γ−''k''. Note that the dominant term is quite similar to corresponding the Schrödinger solution&amp;nbsp;– the upper index on the Laguerre polynomial is slightly less (2γ+1 or 2γ−1 rather than 2ℓ+1, which is the nearest integer), as is the power of ρ (γ or γ−1 instead of ℓ, the nearest integer). The exponential decay is slightly faster than in the Schrödinger solution.

The normalization factor makes the integral over all space of the square of the absolute value equal to 1.

===1S orbital===
Here is the 1S&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; orbital, spin up, without normalization:
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi\propto\begin{pmatrix}
(1+\gamma)r^{\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}\\
0\\
iZ\alpha r^{\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}z/r\\
iZ\alpha r^{\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}(x+iy)/r
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that γ is a little less than 1, so the top function is similar to an exponentially decreasing function of ''r'' except that at very small ''r'' it theoretically goes to infinity. But the value of the &lt;math&gt;r^{\gamma-1}&lt;/math&gt; only surpasses 10 at a value of ''r'' smaller than &lt;math&gt;10^{1/(\gamma-1)},&lt;/math&gt; which is a very small number (much less than the radius of a proton) unless {{mvar|Z}} is very large.

The 1S&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; orbital, spin down, without normalization, comes out as:
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi\propto\begin{pmatrix}
0\\
(1+\gamma)r^{\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}\\
iZ\alpha r^{\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}(x-iy)/r\\
-iZ\alpha r^{\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}z/r
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

We can mix these in order to obtain orbitals with the spin oriented in some other direction, such as:
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi\propto\begin{pmatrix}
(1+\gamma)r^{\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}\\
(1+\gamma)r^{\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}\\
iZ\alpha r^{\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}(x-iy+z)/r\\
iZ\alpha r^{\gamma-1}e^{-Cr}(x+iy-z)/r
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which corresponds to the spin and angular momentum axis pointing in the x direction. Adding ''i'' times the "down" spin to the "up" spin gives an orbital oriented in the y direction.

===2P&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; and 2S&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals===

To give another example, the 2P&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; orbital, spin up, is proportional to:

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi\propto\begin{pmatrix}
\rho^{\gamma-1} e^{-\rho/2}\left(Z\alpha\rho+(\gamma-1)\frac{\gamma\mu c^2-E}{\hbar cC}(-\rho+2\gamma)\right)z/r\\
\rho^{\gamma-1} e^{-\rho/2}\left(Z\alpha\rho+(\gamma-1)\frac{\gamma\mu c^2-E}{\hbar cC}(-\rho+2\gamma)\right)(x+iy)/r\\
i\rho^{\gamma-1}e^{-\rho/2}\left((\gamma-1)\rho+Z\alpha\frac{\gamma\mu c^2-E}{\hbar cC}(-\rho+2\gamma)\right)\\
0
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

(Remember that &lt;math&gt;\rho=2rC&lt;/math&gt;. ''C'' is about half what it is for the 1S orbital, but γ is still the same.)

Notice that when ρ is small compared to α (or ''r'' is small compared to &lt;math&gt;\hbar c/(\mu c^2)&lt;/math&gt;) the "S" type orbital dominates (the third component of the bispinor).

For the 2S&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; spin up orbital, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi\propto\begin{pmatrix}
\rho^{\gamma-1} e^{-\rho/2}\left(Z\alpha\rho+(\gamma+1)\frac{\gamma\mu c^2+E}{\hbar cC}(-\rho+2\gamma)\right)\\
0\\
i\rho^{\gamma-1}e^{-\rho/2}\left((\gamma+1)\rho+Z\alpha\frac{\gamma\mu c^2+E}{\hbar cC}(-\rho+2\gamma)\right)z/r\\
i\rho^{\gamma-1}e^{-\rho/2}\left((\gamma+1)\rho+Z\alpha\frac{\gamma\mu c^2+E}{\hbar cC}(-\rho+2\gamma)\right)(x+iy)/r
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Now the first component is S-like and there is a radius near ρ = 2 where it goes to zero, whereas the bottom two-component part is P-like.

===Negative-energy solutions===
In addition to bound states, in which the energy is less than that of an electron infinitely separated from the nucleus, there are solutions to the Dirac equation at higher energy, corresponding to an unbound electron interacting with the nucleus. These solutions are not normalizable, but solutions can be found which tend toward zero as {{mvar|r}} goes to infinity (which is not possible when &lt;math&gt;|E|&lt;\mu c^2&lt;/math&gt; except at the above-mentioned bound-state values of {{mvar|E}}). There are similar solutions with &lt;math&gt;E&lt;-\mu c^2.&lt;/math&gt; These negative-energy solutions are just like positive-energy solutions having the opposite energy but for a case in which the nucleus repels the electron instead of attracting it, except that the solutions for the top two components switch places with those for the bottom two.

Negative-energy solutions to Dirac's equation exist even in the absence of a Coulomb force exerted by a nucleus. Dirac hypothesized that we can consider almost all of these states to be already filled. If one of these negative-energy states is not filled, this manifests itself as though there is an electron which is ''repelled'' by a positively-charged nucleus. This prompted Dirac to hypothesize the existence of positively-charged electrons, and his prediction was confirmed with the discovery of the [[positron]].

==Beyond Gordon's solution to the Dirac equation==
The Dirac equation with a simple Coulomb potential generated by a point-like non-magnetic nucleus was not the last word, and its predictions differ from experimental results as mentioned earlier. More accurate results include the [[Lamb shift]] (radiative corrections arising from [[quantum electrodynamics]])&lt;ref&gt;For the radiative correction, see Nendzig, opus citatum.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hyperfine structure]].

{{Distinguish|Kerosene}}

'''Kerogen''' is a solid [[organic matter]] in [[sedimentary rock]]s. Consisting of an estimated 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; tons of carbon, it is the most abundant source of organic compounds on earth, exceeding the total organic content of living matter by 10,000 fold.  It is insoluble in normal [[organic solvent]]s and it does not have a specific [[chemical formula]]. Upon heating, kerogen converts in part to liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons. [[Petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] form from kerogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kerogen origin, evolution and structure |author= M. Vandenbroucke, C. Largeau |journal= Organic Geochemistry |volume=38 |year=2007 |pages= 719-833 |doi= 10.1016/j.orggeochem.2007.01.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on its origin, kerogen may be classified as [[algae|algal]], mixed [[Terrestrial plant|terrestrial]] and [[marine life|marine]].&lt;ref name=glossary/&gt;

==History==
The name "kerogen" was introduced by the Scottish [[organic chemistry|organic chemist]] [[Alexander Crum Brown]] in 1906.&lt;ref name=ox&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' 3rd Ed. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=elsevier&gt;{{Cite book| editor-last = Teh Fu Yen| editor2-last = Chilingar | editor2-first = George V.| title = Oil Shale | last = Cane | first = R.F. | chapter = The origin and formation of oil shale | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | location = Amsterdam| page = 27| year = 1976| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qkU7OcVkwaIC&amp;pg=PA27| isbn = 978-0-444-41408-3| accessdate =31 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hutton&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Hutton | first = Adrian C.| last2 = Bharati | first2 = Sunil| last3 = Robl | first3 = Thomas| title = Chemical and Petrographic Classification of Kerogen/Macerals| journal = Energy Fuels| publisher = Elsevier Science| volume = 8| issue = 6| pages = 1478–1488| year = 1994| doi = 10.1021/ef00048a038}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. R. Steuart in H. M. Cadell et al. ''Oil-Shales of Lothians'' iii. 142 (1906)  "We are indebted to Professor Crum Brown, F.R.S., for suggesting the term Kerogen to express the carbonaceous matter in shale that gives rise to crude oil in distillation."&lt;/ref&gt;  It means in Greek "wax birth" (Greek: κηρός "wax" and -gen, γένεση "birth").

==Composition==
Kerogen is a mixture of [[organic chemical compound]]s that make up a portion of the organic matter in [[sedimentary rock]]s.&lt;ref name=glossary&gt;{{Cite web | title = Kerogen | work = Oilfield Glossary | publisher = [[Schlumberger]] | accessdate = 2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As kerogen is a mixture of organic material, rather than a specific chemical, it cannot be given a chemical formula. Its chemical composition can vary distinctively from sample to sample. For example, kerogen from the [[Green River Formation]] oil shale deposit of western [[North America]] contains elements in the proportions [[carbon]] 215 : [[hydrogen]] 330 : [[oxygen]] 12 : [[nitrogen]] 5 : [[sulfur]] 1.&lt;ref name=TehFu&gt;{{Cite book| editor-last = Teh Fu Yen| editor2-last = Chilingar | editor2-first = George V.| title = Oil Shale | last = Robinson | first = W.E. | chapter = Origin and characteristics of Green River oil shale | pages = 61–80 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | location = Amsterdam| year = 1976 | isbn = 978-0-444-41408-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerogen is insoluble in normal organic solvents because of the high [[molecular mass|molecular weight]] (upwards of 1,000&amp;nbsp;[[Atomic mass unit|daltons]] or 1000 Da; 1 Da = 1 [[atomic mass unit]]) of its component compounds. The soluble portion is known as [[Asphalt|bitumen]]. When heated to the right temperatures in the [[crust (geology)|Earth's crust]], (''oil window'' c.&amp;nbsp;50–150&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius scale|°C]], ''gas window'' c.&amp;nbsp;150–200&amp;nbsp;°C, both depending on how quickly the source rock is heated) some types of kerogen release [[crude oil]] or [[natural gas]], collectively known as [[hydrocarbon]]s ([[fossil fuel]]s). When such kerogens are present in high concentration in rocks such as [[shale]], they form possible [[source rock]]s. Shales rich in kerogens that have not been heated to a warmer temperature to release their hydrocarbons may form [[oil shale]] deposits.

==Formation==
Kerogen arises from the degradation of living matter, such as [[diatoms]], [[plankton]]s, [[spores]] and [[pollens]]. In this break-down process, large [[biopolymers]] from [[proteins]] and [[carbohydrates]] dismantle partially or completely.  (This break-down process can be viewed as the reverse of [[photosynthesis]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Tucker M.E.]] (1988) ''Sedimentary Petrology, An Introduction'', Blackwell, London. p197. {{ISBN|0-632-00074-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;). These dismantled components are units that can then [[Condensation reaction|polycondense]] to form [[polymers]]. This polymerization usually happens alongside the formation of a mineral component ([[geopolymer]]) resulting in a sedimentary rock like [[kerogen shale]].

The formation of polymers in this way accounts for the large [[molecular weight]]s and diverse chemical compositions associated with kerogen. The smallest units are the [[Fulvic acid|fulvic]] acids, the medium units are the [[Humic acid|humic]], and the largest units are the [[humins]]. When organic matter is contemporaneously deposited with geologic material, subsequent [[sedimentation]] and progressive [[burial]] or [[overburden]] provide significant pressure and a temperature gradient. When these humic precursors are subjected to sufficient [[geothermal]] pressures for sufficient [[geologic time]], they begin to undergo certain specific changes to become kerogen. Such changes are indicative of the maturity stage of a particular kerogen. These changes include loss of [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[sulfur]], which leads to loss of other [[functional groups]] that further promote [[isomerization]] and [[aromatization]] which are associated with increasing depth or burial. Aromatization then allows for neat molecular [[Stacking (chemistry)|stacking]] in sheets, which in turn increases molecular density and ''[[vitrinite]] reflectance'' properties, as well as changes in spore coloration, characteristically from yellow to orange to brown to black with increasing depth.

Kerogen breaks down in the subsurface to generate oil and gas, which form the source of hydrocarbons in conventional reservoirs. In [[unconventional resources]], many of which are referred to as shale, the produced hydrocarbons have not been expelled from the source rock, but instead are stored and transported within the shale. Most kerogens of relevance to the oil and gas industry are marine ([[Kerogen#type II: Planktonic|type II]]). Much of the porosity in shale is hosted within kerogen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Loucks |first1=Robert |title=Morphology, genesis, and distribution of nanometer-scale pores in siliceous mudstones of the Mississippian Barnett Shale |journal=Journal of Sedimentary Research |volume=79 |pages=848-861 |doi=10.2110/jsr.2009.092}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the recent development of economic shale resources has led to increased research into the composition of kerogen. Studies using [[NMR spectroscopy]] have found that carbon in kerogen can range from almost entirely [[aliphatic]] ([[orbital hybridization#sp3|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized]]) to almost entirely [[aromatic]] ([[orbital hybridization#sp2|sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kelemen |first1=Simon |title=Direct characterization of kerogen by X-ray and solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance methods |journal=Energy Fuels |volume=21 |pages=1548-1561 |doi=10.1021/ef060321h}}&lt;/ref&gt; with kerogens of higher type and/or higher [[thermal maturity]] typically having higher abundance of aromatic carbon.

==Types==
''[[Labile]]'' kerogen breaks down to form heavy [[hydrocarbon]]s (i.e., [[oil]]s), ''[[refractory]]'' kerogen breaks down to form light hydrocarbons (i.e., gases), and ''[[Chemically inert|inert]]'' kerogen forms [[graphite]].

A [[Van Krevelen diagram]] is one example of classifying kerogens, where they tend to form groups when the ratios of hydrogen to carbon and oxygen to carbon are compared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchanddiscovery.net/documents/rice/images/fig04.htm Example of a Van Krevelen diagram]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Type I: Sapropelic===
Type 1 oil shales yield larger amount of volatile or extractable compounds than other types upon [[pyrolysis]]. Hence, from the theoretical view, Type&amp;nbsp;1 kerogen oil shales provide the highest yield of oil and are the most promising deposits in terms of conventional oil retorting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tissot|first=Bernard P.|last2=Welte|first2=Dietrich H.|date=1984|title=Petroleum Formation and Occurrence|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-87813-8|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-87813-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* containing [[alginite]], amorphous organic matter, [[cyanobacteria]], [[freshwater]] [[algae]], and land plant [[resin]]s
* [[Hydrogen]]:[[carbon]] ratio &gt; 1.25
* [[Oxygen]]:carbon ratio &lt; 0.15
* Shows great tendency to readily produce [[liquid]] hydrocarbons.
* It derives principally from [[Wiktionary:lacustrine|lacustrine]] [[alga]]e and forms only in [[Anoxic sea water|anoxic]] lakes and several other unusual marine environments
* Has few [[Cycloalkane|cyclic]] or [[aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatic]] structures
* Formed mainly from [[protein]]s and [[lipid]]s

===Type II: Planktonic===
Type II kerogen is common in many oil shale deposits. It is based on marine organic materials, which are formed in reducing environments. Sulfur is found in substantial amounts in the associated bitumen and generally higher than the sulfur content of Type&amp;nbsp;I or III. Although pyrolysis of Type&amp;nbsp;II kerogen yields less oil than Type&amp;nbsp;I, the amount acquired is still sufficient to consider Type&amp;nbsp;II bearing rocks as potential oil sources  
* Plankton (marine)
* Hydrogen:carbon ratio &lt; 1.25
* Oxygen:carbon ratio 0.03 to 0.18
* Tend to produce a mix of gas and oil.
* Several types:
** [[Sporinite]]: formed from the casings of [[pollen]] and [[spore]]s
** [[Cutinite]]: formed from terrestrial [[plant cuticle]]
** [[Resinite]]: formed from terrestrial plant resins and animal decomposition resins
** [[Liptinite]]: formed from terrestrial plant [[lipid]]s ([[hydrophobic]] molecules that are soluble in organic solvents) and marine algae

They all have great tendencies to produce petroleum and are all formed from lipids deposited under [[redox|reducing]] conditions.

===Type II: Sulfurous===
Similar to Type II but high in [[sulfur]].

===Type III: Humic===
* Land plants (coastal)
* Hydrogen:carbon ratio &lt; 1
* Oxygen:carbon ratio 0.03 to 0.3
* Material is thick, resembling [[wood]] or [[coal]].
* Tends to produce coal and gas (Recent research has shown that Type III kerogens can actually produce oil under extreme conditions) &lt;ref&gt;Krause FF, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* Has very low hydrogen because of the extensive ring and aromatic systems

Kerogen Type III is formed from terrestrial plant matter that is lacking in [[lipid]]s or waxy matter. It forms from [[cellulose]], the [[carbohydrate]] [[polymer]] that forms the rigid structure of terrestrial plants, [[lignin]], a non-carbohydrate polymer formed from phenyl-propane units that binds the strings of cellulose together, and [[terpene]]s and [[phenol]]ic compounds in the plant. Type&amp;nbsp;III kerogen involving rocks are found to be the least productive upon pyrolysis and probably the least favorable deposits for oil generation

===Type IV: Residue===
Hydrogen: carbon ratio &lt; 0.5

Type IV kerogen contains mostly decomposed organic matter in the form of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s. They have no potential to produce hydrocarbons.&lt;ref&gt;Weber G., Green J., ‘‘Guide to oil shale’’. NationalConference of State Legislatures. Washington D.C. USA.p. 21, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of the [[Areas of Special Scientific Interest]] (ASSIs) in [[County Antrim]]''' in [[Northern Ireland]], [[United Kingdom]].

In Northern Ireland the body responsible for designating ASSIs is the [[Northern Ireland Environment Agency]] – a division of the [[Department of the Environment (Northern Ireland)|Department of Environment (DoE)]].

Unlike the SSSIs, ASSIs include both natural environments ''and'' man-made structures. As with SSSIs, these sites are designated if they have criteria based on [[fauna]], [[plant|flora]], [[geology|geological]] or physiographical features. On top of this, structures are also covered, such as the Whitespots mines in [[Conlig]], according to several criterion including rarity, recorded history and intrinsic appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ehsni.gov.uk/biodiversity/designated-areas/area_interest/science_survey.htm Environment and Heritage Service]&lt;/ref&gt; 

For other sites in the rest of the United Kingdom, see [[List of SSSIs by Area of Search]].

The data in the table is taken from the Northern Ireland Environment Agency's website in the form of citation sheets for each ASSI.&lt;ref name="data"&gt;''Environment Agency'' citation sheets for each ASSI. Retrieved on 2011-12-01. ([[PDF]] files).

==Scientific research==
The invention of [[climate research]] through the use of [[satellite]] remote [[telemetry]] began in the 1960s through development of space probes to study other planets. During the U.S. economic decline in 1977, with much of [[NASA]]'s money going toward the [[Space Shuttle|Shuttle]] program, the Reagan Administration proposed to reduce spending on planetary exploration. During this time, new scientific evidence emerged from ice and sediment cores that Earth's climate had experienced rapid changes in temperature, running contrary to the previously held belief that the climate changed on a geological time scale.  These changes increased political interest in gathering remote-sensing data on the Earth itself and stimulated the science of [[climatology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/NasaRole/ |title=Climate Change: NASA's Role |first=Randal |last=Jackson |year=2007 |publisher=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory\California Institute of Technology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724230304/https://climate.nasa.gov/NasaRole/ |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs) are designated by [[Natural England]], a [[non-departmental public body]] which is responsible for protecting England's natural environment. Designation as an SSSI gives legal protection to the most important wildlife and geological sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sites-of-special-scientific-interest-designation |publisher=Natural England |title=Sites of Special Scientific Interest: Designation |accessdate=19 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306231551/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sites-of-special-scientific-interest-designation |archivedate=6 March 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2017, there are 19 SSSIs in the county.&lt;ref name=nlist&gt;{{cite web|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteList.aspx?siteName=&amp;countyCode=35&amp;responsiblePerson=|title=Designated Sites View: Rutland|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen are designated for their biological importance, one for its geological importance and two under both criteria.  

The largest site is [[Rutland Water]] at {{convert|   1,555.3  |ha|acre |abbr=off}}. It is the largest man-made reservoir in Europe, a [[Ramsar site|Ramsar]] internationally important wetland site and a [[Special Protection Area]] under the [[European Union]] [[Birds Directive|Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds]].&lt;ref name=oha/&gt;&lt;ref name=dsvrut/&gt; The smallest is [[Tolethorpe Road Verges]] at {{convert|   1.0  |ha|acre |abbr=off}}, which has several regionally uncommon plants on [[Jurassic]] limestone.&lt;ref name=citetole/&gt;

This page contains a '''list of fountains in Kansas City''' metropolitan area. It is primarily composed of [[fountain]]s in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] officially recognized by the City of Fountains Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcfountains.org/news/index.html City of Fountains | News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but also includes fountains throughout the [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area]].

In 1992, the city added "City of Fountains" to its official corporate seal.&lt;ref name="ordinance"&gt;[http://cityclerk.kcmo.org/liveweb/Documents/Document.aspx?q=xM%2blSxLerCNiQrj6QKGv5YDbX73DmbugafyFKfnWxR15N%2bcusJphzeai9HojEx1K 1992 ordinance enacting new logo]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Fountains form part of the Kansas City's core identity and culture, and it even used a graphic design of a stylized fountain in its official logo.&lt;ref name="ordinance" /&gt; 
Interest in fountains arose during the [[City Beautiful movement]] in the 1890s. In 1898, [[George Kessler]], a landscape architect and urban planner, designed the first fountain built by the city of Kansas City, Missouri at 15th and [[The Paseo]]. Although it was destroyed in 1941, another fountain that he designed the same year still exists and remains the oldest in the city. Now known as '''''The Women's Leadership Fountain''''', it is located at 9th Street and The Paseo. The design originally included an oval, cut limestone basin with water spraying upwards from nozzles in the center of the its pool surrounded by a raised sidewalk, a flower garden, gas lamps, and a balustrade above to the south.&lt;ref name="kcfountains.org"&gt;[http://www.kcfountains.org/education/history.htm City of Fountains Foundation (KCFountains.org), ''Education: Brief History of Kansas City Fountains''], downloaded 3 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The fountain was rebuilt in 1970 and 1990 and began its third major restoration in January 2008 planned for completion in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;The Kansas City Star, ''KC's oldest fountain is undergoing renovation'', 10 March 2009, p. F4&lt;/ref&gt; Kessler went on to include numerous plans for fountains in his urban designs of the park and boulevard system.

Typically, most of the first fountains in Kansas City served practical rather than decorative purposes. In 1904, the Humane Society of Kansas City (Kansas) – established to prevent cruelty to women, children and animals – built a characteristic fountain near the west end of Minnesota Avenue at North 3rd Street. Water poured out of spigots in lions' mouths so that people could get clean water in their cups. This water fell into a granite basin at a height for horses to drink. The overflow from the basin went into four small pools at street level for dogs to drink. A street light was on top; in 1967, the fountain was given to the Wyandotte County Museum. The Humane Society went on to mount more than 100 fountains, including ones made of bronze created for people alone for sanitary purposes.&lt;ref name="kcfountains.org"/&gt;

Fountain building and the use of decorative statuary exploded in the 1920s after developer [[J.C. Nichols]] used them extensively in the development of [[Country Club Plaza]]. The most famous fountain in Kansas City is appropriately named '''''J.C. Nichols Memorial Fountain'''''. The figures were originally created by French sculptor [[Henri-Léon Gréber]] in 1910 for "Harbor Hill," the estate of [[Clarence Mackay]] in [[Roslyn, New York]]. The four allegorical [[equestrianism|equestrian]] figures reportedly represent four great rivers of the world — the [[Mississippi River]], [[Volga River]], [[Seine River]], and [[Rhine River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mackayhistory.com/JCNicholsFountain.html  MacKayHistory.com, ''Mackay Fountain, 1910 to c.1949''], downloaded 21 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The work is enlivened by sculptures of little children riding dolphins in the pool surrounding the main figures.

The ''William Volker Memorial Fountain'' includes the last sculptures by Swedish artist [[Carl Milles]]. The five-piece ensemble of bronze statuary shows [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin of Tours]], [[patron saint]] of [[France]], on horseback, giving his clothes to a [[beggar]] surrounded by two [[angel]]s (one amusingly wearing a [[wristwatch]]) and a curious little [[demon]] in hiding. The sculptures rest between two pools of water with jet sprays along Volker Boulevard, and sits above a dramatic three-tier, {{convert|28|ft|m|abbr=on}} waterfall into a basin on Brush Creek.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcfountains.org/find_fountain/displayfountain.asp?FID=25 City of Fountains Foundation (KCFountains.org), ''Volker Memorial Fountain''], downloaded 3 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Eagle Scout Memorial Fountain'' was originally part of the [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] clock created by [[Adolph Alexander Weinman|A.A. Weinman]] for the [[Pennsylvania Station (1910–1963)|Pennsylvania Station]] in [[New York City]].  When the station was torn down, Kansas City petitioned to obtain the clock sculpture and replaced its face with an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] tribute.

The "Waterworks Spectacular" has been dousing the outfield during [[baseball]] games at [[Kauffman Stadium]] for over 30 years.

The '''glaciers and ice caps of [[Iceland]]''' cover 11.1% of the land area of the country (about 11,400&amp;nbsp;km² out of the total area of 103,125&amp;nbsp;km²) and have a considerable impact on its landscape and meteorology. An [[ice cap]] is a mass of glacial ice that covers less than 50,000&amp;nbsp;km² of land area covering a highland area and they feed [[outlet glacier]]s. Glaciers are also contributing to the Icelandic economy, with tourists flocking to the country to see glaciers on snowmobiles and on glacier hiking tours.

Many Icelandic ice caps and [[glacier]]s lie above [[Volcanism in Iceland|volcanoes]], such as [[Grímsvötn]] and [[Bárðarbunga]], which lie under the largest ice cap, [[Vatnajökull]]. The [[caldera]] of Grímsvötn is 100&amp;nbsp;km² in area, and Bárðarbunga is 60&amp;nbsp;km².

When [[volcanic activity]] occurs under the glacier, the resulting meltwater can lead to a sudden [[glacial lake outburst flood]], known in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] as [[jökulhlaup]], but jökulhlaups are most often caused by accumulation of meltwater due to geothermal activity underneath the glacier. Such jökulhlaups have occasionally triggered volcanic eruptions through the sudden release of pressure. 

Iceland is losing ice due to [[climate change]]. Okjökull glacier in Borgarfjörður, West Iceland, has lost its glacier title and is now simply known as “Ok”. In order to fit the criteria glaciers need to be thick enough to sink and move under their own weight, which Okjökull is not. Okjökull is the first Icelandic glacier to lose its title.&lt;ref name="okjokull loses status"&gt;{{cite news|first1=STAFF|title=Okjökull glacier loses its glacier title due to its declining size|url=http://www.icelandmag.com/article/okjokull-glacier-loses-its-glacier-title-due-its-declining-size|accessdate=24 September 2014|work=Iceland Magazine|agency=Iceland Magazine|date=22 September 2014|ref=okjokull}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jökullinn Ok er ekki lengur jökull"&gt;{{cite news|title="Jökullinn" Ok er ekki lengur jökull|url=http://www.ruv.is/frett/jokullinn-ok-er-ekki-lengur-jokull|website=http://www.ruv.is/|publisher=RÚV|accessdate=24 September 2014|ref=ok-er-ekki-lengur-jokull}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] word for ''glacier'' is ''[[wikt:jökull#Icelandic|jökull]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1231">There are no rivers in the Bahamas. In March 2018 waves breaking over cliffs near the Glass Window Bridge in Eleuthera caused a flow of water across the island that washed out the Queens Highway, and was temporarily called a new river. There are also many [[creek (tidal)|tidal creeks]], which resemble rivers.

The map highlights the [[Gila River]] extending eastward across southern Arizona to the southwestern corner of Arizona and its input into the [[Colorado River]], from its origins about 400 miles east in the southwestern corner of the state of [[New Mexico]].  The highlighted river north and adjacent is the [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]] which has the [[Verde River]] connected just prior to its drainage into the Gila River. The Verde and Salt rivers effectively drain the western and central portion of the [[Mogollon Rim]], NW to SE across the state, and the White Mountain region of the Mogollon Rim, in east-central, and east Arizona.

The Verde River drainage into the Salt River, at its very northwestern drainages, east of [[Kingman, Arizona]], even drains the [[South Rim]], of the [[Grand Canyon]]. Thus, the '''''Gila River watershed''''', may cover more than sixty (60) percent of the state.

==The 3-north-south drainages + [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt-Verde Watershed]]==
From west&amp;ndash;to&amp;ndash;east the [[Hassayampa River|Hassayampa River's]] final destination is the dry desert, and groundwater.  The second drainage, the [[Agua Fria River]] enters the Gila in western Phoenix, but not as a flowing river.  The Agua Fria puts most of its winter drainage, or snowmelt/rain floodwaters into [[Lake Pleasant Regional Park]].  The largest of the ''three'' north/south rivers, the [[Verde River]](plus the East Verde), goes through [[Horseshoe Reservoir]] and [[Bartlett Reservoir]] before joining the [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]].  (The Salt River enters the Gila, 40 miles downstream, through central Phoenix, and five miles before the [[Agua Fria River]] tributary.  The Hassayampa River is 35 miles farther downstream, and just prior to the tributary of [[Centennial Wash]].)

The [[Verde River]] drainage extends north and northwest of the Agua Fria River, and Hassayampa River drainages, and continues to the [[South Rim]] of the [[Grand Canyon]].  The combined: '''''Salt River&amp;ndash;Verde River Drainage''''' would be the major, (and central), component of the [[Mogollon Rim]] drainages of central Arizona.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18075">A '''water deity''' is a [[deity]] in [[mythology]] associated with water or various [[Body of water|bodies of water]]. Water deities are common in mythology and were usually more important among civilizations in which the sea or ocean, or a great river was more important. Another important focus of worship of water deities has been springs or [[holy well]]s.

As a form of [[animal worship]], [[whale]]s and [[snake]]s (hence [[dragon]]s) have been regarded as godly deities throughout the world (other animals are such as [[turtle]]s, fish, crabs, and [[shark]]s). In Asian lore, whales and dragons sometimes have connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=謝婧, 下園知弥, 宮崎克則|year=2015|title=明清時代の中国における鯨資源の利用|url=http://www.seinan-gu.ac.jp/museum/wp-content/uploads/2015/publish/kiyou3.pdf|journal=西南学院大  学博物館研究紀要 第3号|pages=9–14|publisher=[[Seinan Gakuin University]]|format=pdf|accessdate=2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Serpent (symbolism)|Serpents are also common as a symbol]] or [[Snake worship|as serpentine deities]], sharing many similarities with dragons.

'''''Marid''''' ({{lang-ar|مارد}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|mārid}}'') is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word meaning ''rebellious'', which is sometimes applied to supernatural beings.

==In Arabic sources ==

The word ''mārid'' is an [[Participle|active participle]] of the root ''m-r-d'' (مرد), whose primary meaning is ''recalcitrant, rebellious''. ''Lisān al-`arab'', the encyclopedic dictionary of classical Arabic compiled by [[Ibn Manzur]], reports only forms of this general meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alwaraq.net/Core/AlwaraqSrv/bookpage?book=89&amp;fkey=2&amp;page=5376&amp;option=1 |author=Ibn Manzur |title=Lisan al-`arab (entry for m-r-d) |page=5376}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found as an attribute of evil spirits in the [[Quran|Qur'an]] (aṣ-Ṣāffāt, 37:7), which speaks of a "safeguard against every rebellious devil" (شَيْطَانٍ مَارِدٍ, ''shaitān mārid'').

The [[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic|Wehr-Cowan dictionary]] of modern written Arabic also gives secondary meanings of ''demon'' and ''giant''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |first1=Hans |last1=Wehr |first2=J.M. |last2=Cowan |title=A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic |edition=3rd |location=Ithaca, N.Y. |publisher=Spoken Language Services |page=903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lane's ''[[Arabic-English Lexicon]]'' cites a source where it "''is said to be applied to an evil jinnee of the most powerful class''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tyndalearchive.com/tabs/lane/ |title=An Arabic-English Lexicon: Derived from the best and the most copious Eastern sources |first=Edward William |last=Lane |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408021742/http://www.tyndalearchive.com/tabs/lane/ |archivedate=2015-04-08 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this distinction is not universal. For example, in the standard MacNaghten edition of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' one finds the words ''marid'' and ''[[ifrit]]'' used interchangeably (e.g., in ''The Story of the Fisherman'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/aliflailaorbook03unkngoog |title=Alif Laila |editor-first=Sir William Hay |editor-last=Mac Naghten |location=Calcutta |publisher=W. Thacker and Co |year=1839 |volume=1 |page=20 |language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mārid is explicitly mentioned in [[Sirat Sayf ibn Dhi-Yazan]]. Accordingly [[Sayf ibn Dhi-Yazan|Sayf]] demands from the marid to lead him to [[Solomon in Islam|Solomon]]s hoard. But following his nature, the demon does the exact oppisite of that he was commanded. Later he learned from [[Khidr]], he must command the opposite of that he desires him to do.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam Walter'' de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 100 (German) &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3412">'''Natural frequency''' is the [[frequency]] at which a system tends to [[Oscillation|oscillate]] in the absence of any driving or [[damping]] force.{{sfn|College|2012|p=569}}

The motion pattern of a system oscillating at its natural frequency is called the [[normal mode]] (if all parts of the system move sinusoidally with that same frequency).

If the oscillating system is driven by an external force at the frequency at which the amplitude of its motion is greatest (close to a natural frequency of the system), this frequency is called [[resonant frequency]].

==Overview==
Free vibrations of an [[elastic body]] are called ''natural vibrations'' and occur at a frequency called the natural frequency. Natural vibrations are different from forced vibrations which happen at frequency of applied force (forced frequency). If forced frequency is equal to the natural frequency, the amplitude of vibration increases manifold. This phenomenon is known as [[resonance]].{{sfn|Bhatt|p=122}}

In a [[Simple_harmonic_motion#Mass_on_a_spring|mass-spring system]], with mass ''m'' and spring stiffness ''k'', the natural frequency can be calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega _0 =\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

In [[electrical circuits]], ''s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a natural frequency of variable ''x'' if the zero-input response of ''x'' includes the term &lt;math&gt;K_1 e^{-s_1t}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;K_1 \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; is a constant dependent on initial state of the circuit, [[network topology]], and element values.{{sfn|Desoer|1969|pp=583-584}} In a [[Electrical network|network]], ''s&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a natural frequency of the network if it is a natural frequency of some [[voltage]] or [[Electric current|current]] in the network.{{sfn|Desoer|1969|p=600}} Natural frequencies depend ''only'' on network topology and element values but not the input.{{sfn|Desoer|1969|p=633}} It can be shown that the set of natural frequencies in a network can be obtained by calculating the poles of all impedance and admittance functions of the network.{{sfn|Desoer|1969|p=635}} All poles of the network [[transfer function]] are also natural frequencies of the corresponding response variable; however there may exist some natural frequencies that are not a pole of the network function. These frequencies happen at some special initial states.{{sfn|Desoer|1969|p=643}}

In [[LC circuit|LC]] and [[RLC circuits]], the natural frequency of a circuit can be calculated as:{{sfn|Basic Physics|2009|p=366}}
:&lt;math&gt;\omega _0 =\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Northern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic''' is a forest and savanna [[ecoregion]] of central Africa, part of the belt of transitional [[forest-savanna mosaic]] that lie between Africa's equatorial forests and the tropical dry forests, savannas, and grasslands that lie to the north and south. The Northern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic lies between the equatorial [[Congolian forests]] to the south and the drier [[East Sudanian savanna]] to the north. It extends from the [[Cameroon Highlands]] in the west, across central [[Cameroon]] and the southern [[Central African Republic]] to southwestern [[South Sudan]] and northeastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], where it is bounded on the east by flooded grasslands of the [[Sudd]], the eastern block of the East Sudanian savanna, and the [[Albertine Rift montane forests]].

'''Radiative levitation''' is the name given to a phenomenon that causes the spectroscopically-derived abundance of heavy elements in the [[photosphere|photospheres]] of hot stars to be very much higher than solar abundance or than the expected bulk abundance; for example, the spectrum of the star [[Feige 86]] has gold and platinum abundances three to ten thousand times higher than solar &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bonifacio | last2=Castelli |last3=Hack |title=The field horizontal-branch B-type star Feige 86 |date=2001-05-01 |pages=441-468 |volume=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The mechanism is that heavier elements have large [[photon]] absorption cross-sections when partially ionized (see [[opacity (nuclear physics)|opacity]]), so efficiently absorb photons from the radiation coming from the core of the star, and some of the energy of the photons gets converted to outward momentum, effectively 'kicking' the heavy atom towards the photosphere.  The effect is strong enough that very hot white dwarfs are significantly less bright in the EUV and X-ray bands than would be expected from a black-body model. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Steven D. Kawaler |title=Stellar Remnants: Saas-Fee Advanced Course 25 Lecture Notes |date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The countervailing process is '''gravitational settling''', where, in very high gravitational fields, the effects of diffusion even in a hot atmosphere are cancelled out to the point that the heavier elements will sink unobservably to the bottom and lighter elements settle on the top.

'''Red supergiants''' are [[star]]s with a [[supergiant]] luminosity class ([[Stellar classification#Yerkes spectral classification|Yerkes class]] '''I''') of [[spectral classification|spectral type]] K or M.&lt;ref name="LamersCassinelli1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henny J. G. L. M. Lamers|author2=Joseph P. Cassinelli|title=Introduction to Stellar Winds|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJuDvniBNokC&amp;pg=PA53|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=17 June 1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-59565-0|pages=53–}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the [[List of largest stars|largest stars]] in the universe in terms of [[volume]], although they are not the most [[mass]]ive or [[Luminosity#Stellar_luminosity|luminous]]. [[Betelgeuse]] and [[Antares]] are the brightest and best known red supergiants (RSGs), indeed the only first [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] '''red supergiant stars'''.

==Classification==
Stars are classified as supergiants on the basis of their spectral [[luminosity class]].  This system uses certain diagnostic spectral lines to estimate the [[surface gravity]] of a star, hence determining its size relative to its mass.  Larger stars are more luminous at a given temperature and can now be grouped into bands of differing luminosity.&lt;ref name=geisler&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1984PASP...96..723G|title=Luminosity classification with the Washington system|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|volume=96|pages=723|author1=Geisler|first1=D.|year=1984|doi=10.1086/131411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The luminosity differences between stars is most apparent at low temperatures, where giant stars are much brighter than main-sequence stars.  Supergiant have the lowest surface gravities and hence are the largest and brightest at a particular temperature.

The ''Yerkes'' or ''Morgan-Keenan'' (MK) classification system&lt;ref name=mk&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1973ARA&amp;A..11...29M|title=Spectral Classification|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=11|pages=29–50|author1=Morgan|first1=W. W.|last2=Keenan|first2=P. C.|year=1973|doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.11.090173.000333}}&lt;/ref&gt; is almost universal.  It groups stars into five main luminosity groups designated by [[roman numerals]]:
* I [[supergiant]];
* II [[bright giant]];
* III [[Giant (star)|giant]];
* IV [[subgiant]];
* V [[Dwarf (star)|dwarf]] ([[main sequence]]).

Specific to supergiants, the luminosity class is further divided into normal supergiants of class Ib and bright supergiants of class Ia.  The intermediate class Iab is also used.  Exceptionally bright, low surface gravity, stars with strong indications of mass loss may be designated by luminosity class 0 (zero) although this is rarely seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1992A&amp;A...263..123P|title=Photometry of yellow semiregular variables - HR 8752 (= V509 Cassiopeiae)|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=263|pages=123|author1=Percy|first1=J. R.|last2=Zsoldos|first2=E.|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More often the designation Ia-0 will be used,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1992A&amp;A...259..600A|title=A photometric study of the G0-4 Ia(+) hypergiant HD 96918 (V382 Carinae)|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=259|pages=600|author1=Achmad|first1=L.|last2=Lamers|first2=H.

The "red" part of "red supergiant" refers to the cool temperature. Red supergiants are the coolest supergiants, M-type and at least some K-type stars although there is no precise cutoff. K-type supergiants are uncommon compared to M-type, because they are a short-lived transition stage and somewhat unstable. The K-type stars, especially early or hotter K types, are sometimes described as orange supergiants (e.g. [[Zeta Cephei]]), or even as yellow (e.g. [[yellow hypergiant]] [[HR 5171]]A).&lt;ref name=levesque/&gt;

==Properties==
Red supergiants are cool and large.  They have spectral types of K and M, hence temperatures below 4,100&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]].&lt;ref name=levesque&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/430901|title=The Effective Temperature Scale of Galactic Red Supergiants: Cool, but Not as Cool as We Thought|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=628|issue=2|pages=973–985|year=2005|author1-link=Emily Levesque|last1=Levesque|first1=Emily M.|last2=Massey|first2=Philip|last3=Olsen|first3=K. A. G.|last4=Plez|first4=Bertrand|last5=Josselin|first5=Eric|last6=Maeder|first6=Andre|last7=Meynet|first7=Georges|bibcode=2005ApJ...628..973L|arxiv = astro-ph/0504337 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are typically several hundred to over a thousand times the radius of the Sun,&lt;ref name=levesque/&gt; although size is not the primary factor in a star being designated as a supergiant.  A bright cool giant star can easily be larger than a hotter supergiant.  For example, [[Alpha Herculis]] is classified as a giant star with a radius of {{solar radius|between 264 to 303}} while [[Epsilon Pegasi]] is a K2 supergiant of only {{solar radius|185}}.

Although red supergiants are much cooler than the Sun, they are so much larger that they are highly luminous, typically {{solar luminosity|tens or hundreds of thousands}}.&lt;ref name=levesque/&gt;  There is an upper limit to the luminosity of a red supergiant at around {{solar luminosity|half a million}}.  Stars above this luminosity would be too unstable and simply don't form.

Red supergiants have masses between about {{solar mass|10}} and {{solar mass|40}}. Main-sequence stars more massive than about {{solar mass|40}} do not expand and cool to become red supergiants.  Red supergiants at the upper end of the possible mass and luminosity range are the largest known.  Their low surface gravities and high luminosities cause extreme mass loss, millions of times higher than the Sun, producing observable nebulae surrounding the star.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/318748|title=The Asymmetric Nebula Surrounding the Extreme Red Supergiant Vy Canis Majoris|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=121|issue=2|pages=1111–1125|year=2001|last1=Smith|first1=Nathan|last2=Humphreys|first2=Roberta M.|last3=Davidson|first3=Kris|last4=Gehrz|first4=Robert D.|last5=Schuster|first5=M. T.|last6=Krautter|first6=Joachim|bibcode=2001AJ....121.1111S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of their lives red supergiants may have lost a substantial fraction of their initial mass.  The more massive supergiants lose mass much more rapidly and all red supergiants appear to reach a similar mass of the order of {{solar mass|10}} by the time their cores collapse.  The exact value depends on the initial chemical makeup of the star and its rotation rate.&lt;ref name=ekstrom/&gt;

Most red supergiants show some degree of visual [[variable star|variability]], but only rarely with a well-defined period or amplitude.  Therefore, they are usually classified as [[Irregular variable|irregular]] or [[Semiregular variable star|semiregular]] variables.  They even  have their own sub-classes, SRC and LC for slow semi-regular and [[Slow irregular variable|slow irregular]] supergiant variables respectively.  Variations are typically slow and of small amplitude, but amplitudes up to four magnitudes are known.&lt;ref name=kiss&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2006.10973.x|title=Variability in red supergiant stars: Pulsations, long secondary periods and convection noise|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=372|issue=4|pages=1721–1734|year=2006|last1=Kiss|first1=L. L.|last2=Szabo|first2=G. M.|last3=Bedding|first3=T. R.|bibcode=2006MNRAS.372.1721K|arxiv = astro-ph/0608438 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistical analysis of many known variable red supergiants shows a number of likely causes for variation: just a few stars show large amplitudes and strong noise indicating variability at many frequencies, thought to indicate powerful [[stellar wind]]s that occur towards the end of the life of a red supergiant; more common are simultaneous radial mode variations over a few hundred days and probably non-radial mode variations over a few thousand days; only a few stars appear to be truly irregular, with small amplitudes, likely due to photospheric granulation.  Red supergiant photospheres contain a relatively small number of very large convection cells compared to stars like the [[Sun]].  This causes variations in surface brightness that can lead to visible [[variable star|brightness variations]] as the star rotates.&lt;ref name=Schwarzschild&gt;

The spectra of red supergiants are similar to other cool stars, dominated by a forest of absorption lines of metals and molecular bands.  Some of these features are used to determine the luminosity class, for example certain near-infrared [[cyanogen]] band strengths and the [[Ca II triplet]].&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1978ApJ...222..209W|title=Photoelectric two-dimensional spectral classification of M supergiants|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=222|pages=209|author1=White|first1=N.

Surface abundances of red supergiants are dominated by hydrogen even though hydrogen at the core has been completely consumed.  In the latest stages of mass loss before a star explodes, surface helium may become enriched to levels comparable with hydrogen.  In theoretical extreme mass loss models, sufficient hydrogen may be lost that helium becomes the most abundant element at the surface.  When pre-red supergiant stars leave the main sequence, oxygen is more abundant than carbon at the surface, and nitrogen is less abundant than either, reflecting abundances from the formation of the star.  Carbon and oxygen are quickly depleted and nitrogen enhanced as a result of the dredge-up of CNO-processed material from the fusion layers.&lt;ref name=georgy&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201118372|title=Yellow supergiants as supernova progenitors: An indication of strong mass loss for red supergiants?|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|volume=538|pages=L8|year=2012|last1=Georgy|first1=C.|bibcode=2012A&amp;A...538L...8G|arxiv = 1111.7003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red supergiants are observed to rotate slowly or very slowly.  Models indicate that even rapidly rotating main-sequence stars should be braked by their mass loss so that red supergiants hardly rotate at all.  Those red supergiants such as [[Betelgeuse]] that do have modest rates of rotation may have acquired it after reaching the red supergiant stage, perhaps though binary interaction.  The cores of red supergiants are still rotating and the differential rotation rate can be very large.&lt;ref name=meynet/&gt;

Supergiant luminosity classes are easy to determine and apply to large numbers of stars, but they group a number of very different types of star into a single category.  An evolutionary definition restricts the term supergiant to those massive stars which start core helium fusion without developing a degenerate helium core and without undergoing a helium flash.  They will universally go on to burn heavier elements and undergo core collapse resulting in a [[supernova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2005A&amp;A...438..273V|title=An empirical formula for the mass-loss rates of dust-enshrouded red supergiants and oxygen-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch stars|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=438|pages=273–289|author1=Van Loon|first1=J.

Less massive stars may develop a supergiant spectral luminosity class at relatively low luminosity, around {{solar luminosity|1,000}}, when they are on the [[asymptotic giant branch]] (AGB) undergoing helium shell burning.  Researchers now prefer to categorise these as AGB stars distinct from supergiants because they are less massive, have different chemical compositions at the surface, undergo different types of pulsation and variability, and will evolve in a different way, usually producing a planetary nebula and white dwarf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2009A&amp;A...506.1277G|title=Luminosities and mass-loss rates of SMC and LMC AGB stars and red supergiants|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=506|issue=3|pages=1277–1296|author1=Groenewegen|first1=M.

Red supergiants develop from main-sequence stars with masses between about {{solar mass|10}} and {{solar mass|30}}.  Higher-mass stars never cool sufficiently to become red supergiants.  Lower-mass stars develop a degenerate helium core during a red giant phase, undergo a helium flash before fusing helium on the [[horizontal branch]], evolve along the AGB while burning helium in a shell around a degenerate carbon-oxygen core, then rapidly lose their outer layers to become a white dwarf with a planetary nebula.&lt;ref name=ekstrom&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2012A&amp;A...537A.146E|title=Grids of stellar models with rotation.

Main-sequence stars, burning hydrogen in their cores, with masses between {{solar mass|10 and 30}} will have temperatures between about 25,000K and 32,000K and spectral types of early B, possibly very late O.  They are already very luminous stars of {{solar luminosity|10,000-100,000}} due to rapid [[CNO cycle]] fusion of hydrogen and they have fully convective cores.  In contrast to the Sun, the outer layers of these hot main-sequence stars are not convective.&lt;ref name=ekstrom/&gt;

These pre-red supergiant main-sequence stars exhaust the hydrogen in their cores after 5-20 million years.  They then start to burn a shell of hydrogen around the now-predominantly helium core, and this causes them to expand and cool into supergiants.  Their luminosity increases by a factor of about three.  The surface abundance of helium is now up to 40% but there is little enrichment of heavier elements.&lt;ref name=ekstrom/&gt;

The supergiants continue to cool and most will rapidly pass through the [[Cepheid instability strip]], although the most massive will spend a brief period as [[yellow hypergiant]]s.  They will reach late K or M class and become a red supergiant.  Helium fusion in the core begins smoothly either while the star is expanding or once it is already a red supergiant, but this produces little immediate change at the surface.  Red supergiants develop deep convection zones reaching from the surface over halfway to the core and these cause strong enrichment of [[nitrogen]] at the surface, with some enrichment of heavier elements.&lt;ref name=heger&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/308158|title=Presupernova Evolution of Rotating Massive Stars.

E.|bibcode=2000ApJ...528..368H|arxiv = astro-ph/9904132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some red supergiants undergo ''blue loops'' where they temporarily increase in temperature before returning to the red supergiant state.  This depends on the mass, rate of rotation, and chemical makeup of the star. While many red supergiants will not experience a blue loop, some can have several.  Temperatures can reach 10,000K at the peak of the blue loop.  The exact reasons for blue loops vary in different stars, but they are always related to the helium core increasing as a proportion of the mass of the star and forcing higher mass loss rates from the outer layers.&lt;ref name=meynet&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201424671|title=Impact of mass-loss on the evolution and pre-supernova properties of red supergiants|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|volume=575|pages=A60|year=2015|last1=Meynet|first1=G.|last2=Chomienne|first2=V.|last3=Ekström|first3=S.|last4=Georgy|first4=C.|last5=Granada|first5=A.|last6=Groh|first6=J.|last7=Maeder|first7=A.|last8=Eggenberger|first8=P.|last9=Levesque|first9=E.|last10=Massey|first10=P.|bibcode=2015A&amp;A...575A..60M|arxiv = 1410.8721 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All red supergiants will exhaust the helium in their cores within one or two million years and then start to burn carbon.  This continues with fusion of heavier elements until an iron core builds up, which then inevitably collapses to produce a supernova.  The time from the onset of carbon fusion until core collapse is no more than a few thousand years.  In most cases, core collapse occurs while the star is still a red supergiant, the large remaining hydrogen-rich atmosphere is ejected, and this produces a [[type II supernova]] spectrum.  The [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] of this ejected hydrogen decreases as it cools and this causes an extended delay to the drop in brightness after the initial supernova peak, the characteristic of a type II-P supernova.&lt;ref name=ekstrom/&gt;&lt;ref name=heger/&gt;

The most luminous red supergiants, at near solar [[metallicity]], are expected to lose most of their outer layers before their cores collapse, hence they evolve back to yellow hypergiants and luminous blue variables.  Such stars can explode as type II-L supernovae, still with hydrogen in their spectra but not with sufficient hydrogen to cause an extended brightness plateau in their light curves.  Stars with even less hydrogen remaining may produce the uncommon type IIb supernova, where there is so little hydrogen remaining that the hydrogen lines in the initial type II spectrum fade to the appearance of a type Ib supernova.&lt;ref name=woosley&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.74.1015|title=The evolution and explosion of massive stars|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=74|issue=4|pages=1015–1071|year=2002|last1=Woosley|first1=S. E.|last2=Heger|first2=A.|last3=Weaver|first3=T. A.|bibcode=2002RvMP...74.1015W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The observed progenitors of type II-P supernovae all have temperatures between 3,500K and 4,400K and luminosities between {{solar luminosity|20,000}} and {{solar luminosity|200,000}}.  This matches the expected parameters of lower mass red supergiants.  A small number of progenitors of type II-L and type IIb supernovae have been observed, all having luminosities around {{solar luminosity|100,000}} and somewhat higher temperatures up to 6,000K.  These are a good match for slightly higher mass red supergiants with high mass loss rates.  There are no known supernova progenitors corresponding to the most luminous red supergiants, and it is expected that these evolve to [[Wolf Rayet stars]] before exploding.&lt;ref name=meynet/&gt;

==Clusters==
[[File:Ssc2006-03a.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[RSGC1]], the first of several massive clusters found to contain multiple red supergiants.]]
Red supergiants are necessarily no more than about 25 million years old and such massive stars are expected to form only in relatively large [[star cluster|clusters of stars]], so they are expected to be found mostly near prominent clusters.  However they are fairly short-lived compared to other phases in the life of a star and only form from relatively uncommon massive stars, so there will generally only be small numbers of red supergiants in each cluster at any one time.  For example, in the substantial [[Double Cluster]]s in [[Perseus]] there is just a single red supergiant, [[S Persei]], while the massive [[Hodge 301]] cluster in the [[Tarantula Nebula]] contains three.&lt;ref name=slesnick&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2002ApJ...576..880S|title=The Star Formation History and Mass Function of the Double Cluster h and χ Persei|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=576|issue=2|pages=880–893|author1=Slesnick|first1=Catherine L.|last2=Hillenbrand|first2=Lynne A.|last3=Massey|first3=Philip|year=2002|doi=10.1086/341865|arxiv = astro-ph/0205130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until the 21st century the largest number of red supergiants known in a single cluster was five in [[NGC 7419]].&lt;ref name=caron&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/377314|title=The Lack of Blue Supergiants in NGC 7419, a Red Supergiant-rich Galactic Open Cluster with Rapidly Rotating Stars|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=126|issue=3|pages=1415–1422|year=2003|last1=Caron|first1=Genevive|last2=Moffat|first2=Anthony F.

Since 2006, a series of massive clusters have been identified near the base of the [[Crux-Scutum Arm]] of the galaxy, each containing multiple red supergiants.  [[RSGC1]] contains at least 12 red supergiants, RSGC2 (also known as [[Stephenson 2]]) contains at least 26, [[RSGC3]] contains at least 8, and RSGC4 (also known as [[Alicante 8]]) contains at least 8.  A total of 80 confirmed red supergiants have been identified within a small area of the sky in the direction of these clusters.  These four clusters appear to be part of a massive burst of star formation 10-20 million years ago at the near end of the bar at the centre of the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=  2012A&amp;A...547A..15N|doi= 10.1051/0004-6361/201219540|title= Red supergiants around the obscured open cluster Stephenson&amp;nbsp;2|journal= Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|volume= 547|pages= A15|year= 2012|last1= Negueruela|first1= I.|last2= Marco|first2= A.|last3= González-Fernández|first3= C.|last4= Jiménez-Esteban|first4= F.|last5= Clark|first5= J.

==Examples==
[[File:Orion Head to Toe.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] region showing the red supergiant [[Betelgeuse]]]]
Red supergiants are rare stars, but they are visible at great distance and are often variable so there are a number of well-known naked-eye examples:
* [[Alpha Herculis]] (=Rasalgethi)
* [[Psi1 Aurigae]]
* [[119 Tauri]]
* [[Antares]]
* [[Betelgeuse]]

Other examples have become known on account of their enormous size, more than {{solar radius|1,000}}:
* [[KW Sagittarii]]
* [[PZ Cassiopeiae]]
* [[VX Sagittarii]]
* [[KY Cygni]]
* [[V354 Cephei]]

Shi was born in [[Yangzhong]], [[Jiangsu]] province, [[China]]. His identical twin brother is Chen Henglong, who is also a tycoon. He finished his undergraduate study at [[Changchun University of Science and Technology]] in [[Changchun]], and obtained his [[Master's degree]] from [[Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/officerProfile?symbol=STP&amp;officerId=710789 |agency = Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, Shi went to the [[University of New South Wales]]'s [[School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering]] where he obtained his doctorate degree on solar power technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pv.unsw.edu.au/ School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering]&lt;/ref&gt;

He acquired [[Australia]]n citizenship&lt;ref name="forbes2008"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/10/billionaires08_Shi-Zhengrong_EP46.html |title = #396 Shi Zhengrong |work = The World's Billionaires |publisher = [[Forbes]] |date = 2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to China in 2001 to set up his solar power company - [[Suntech Power]]. According to Hurun Report's China Rich List 2013, he had a personal net worth of US$330 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://hurun.net/EN/HuList.aspx |title = China Rich List 2013 |accessdate = 4 September 2014 |publisher = Hurun Report |deadurl=yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140831000018/http://hurun.net/EN/HuList.aspx |archivedate = 2014-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shi was elected Fellow of the [[Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering]] in 2009.

Amid fierce price competition on its products, on 20 March 2013, the Suntech board declared bankruptcy in the wake of defaulting on US$541 million-worth of bonds, Shi had been demoted from chairman to director earlier that month. The ''[[Financial Times]]'', quoting the ''[[Shanghai Securities News]]'', reported at the time that Shi's movements were being restricted and that he was not allowed to leave China pending an investigation into his role at Suntech.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times, [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4d5528ec-d412-11e2-8639-00144feab7de.html#ixzz2WRMKTCpI Dark times for Suntech's solar star].&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2016, he was living in Shanghai and frequently visiting Australia.&lt;ref&gt;The Australian, [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/shi-zhengrong-the-sun-kings-new-dawn/news-story/7be9f33c0d9f3fe56a78f929584e86a6 Shi Zhengrong: the Sun King's new dawn].&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017 and 2018, Dr. Shi Zhengrong had been seen actively giving key note speeches at solar conferences and promoting the use of solar technologies in both China and overseas.&lt;ref name="PGO China"&gt;[http://www.pgo-china.com/en/index.php?ac=article&amp;at=read&amp;did=12427 Thousands of photovoltaic elites gather in Shanghai to discuss jointly the ways of innovation and development of the industry] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129110607/http://www.pgo-china.com/en/index.php?ac=article&amp;at=read&amp;did=12427 |date=2018-11-29 }}, ''[[PGO China]]'', September 12, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Xinhua&gt;[http://en.silkroad.news.cn/2017/0916/51244.shtml Shi Zhengrong: vast room exists for development, innovation and application of PV products] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129110841/http://en.silkroad.news.cn/2017/0916/51244.shtml |date=2018-11-29 }}, ''[[Xinhua]]'', September 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University of New England"&gt;[https://www.une.edu.au/connect/news/2017/10/investment-in-solar-a-sure-bet-says-chinese-pioneer Investment in solar a sure bet says Chinese pioneer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129105652/https://www.une.edu.au/connect/news/2017/10/investment-in-solar-a-sure-bet-says-chinese-pioneer |date=2018-11-29 }}, ''[[University of New England]]'', Published 17 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''storage ring''' is a type of circular [[particle accelerator]] in which a continuous or pulsed [[particle beam]] may be kept circulating typically for many hours. Storage of a particular [[Elementary particle|particle]] depends upon the [[mass]], [[momentum]] and usually the [[charge (physics)|charge]] of the particle to be stored.  Storage rings most commonly store [[electron]]s, [[positron]]s, or [[proton]]s. 

Storage rings are most often used to store electrons that radiate [[synchrotron radiation]]. Over 50 facilities based on electron storage rings exist and are used for a variety of studies in chemistry and biology. Storage rings can also be used to produce polarized high-energy electron beams through the [[Sokolov-Ternov effect]]. The best-known application of storage rings is their use in [[particle accelerator]]s and in [[collider|particle colliders]], where two counter-rotating beams of stored particles are brought into collision at discrete locations. The resulting [[subatomic]] interactions are then studied in a surrounding [[particle detector]]. Examples of such facilities are [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]], [[LEP]], [[PEP-II]], [[KEKB_(accelerator)|KEKB]], [[RHIC]], [[Tevatron]] and [[HERA]].

A storage ring is a type of [[synchrotron]]. While a conventional synchrotron serves to accelerate particles from a low to a high energy state with the aid of radio-frequency accelerating cavities, a storage ring keeps particles stored at a constant energy and radio-frequency cavities are only used to replace energy lost through synchrotron radiation and other processes.

[[Gerard K. O'Neill]] proposed the use of storage rings as building blocks for a [[collider]] in 1956.  A key benefit of storage rings in this context is that the storage ring can accumulate a high beam flux from an injection accelerator that achieves a much lower flux.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard K. O'Neill, Storage-Ring Synchrotron:  Device for High-Energy Physics Research, [http://www.feynman.princeton.edu/mumu/physics/oneill_pr_102_1418_56.pdf Physical Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306163409/http://www.feynman.princeton.edu/mumu/physics/oneill_pr_102_1418_56.pdf |date=2012-03-06 }}, Vol. 102 (1956); pages 1418-1419.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Important considerations for particle-beam storage ==
===Magnets===
[[Image:Aust.-Synchrotron,-Storage-Ring-Magnets,-14.06.2007.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Different types of [[magnet]]s used in the storage ring of the [[Australian Synchrotron]]. The larger yellow one is a [[dipole magnet]] used to bend the electron beam and produce the [[synchrotron radiation]]. The green one is a [[sextupole magnet]] and the red one (behind the dipole) is a [[quadrupole magnet]] which are used for focusing and to maintain chromaticity respectively.]]
A force must be applied to particles in such a way that they are constrained to move approximately in a circular path. This may be accomplished using either dipole electrostatic or dipole magnetic fields, but because most storage rings store [[special relativity|relativistic]] charged particles it turns out that it is most practical to utilise magnetic fields produced by [[dipole magnet]]s. However, electrostatic accelerators have been built to store very low energy particles, and quadrupole fields may be used to store (uncharged) [[neutron]]s; these are comparatively rare, however.

Dipole magnets alone only provide what is called [[weak focusing]], and a storage ring composed of only these sorts of magnetic elements results in the particles having a relatively large beam size. Interleaving dipole magnets with an appropriate arrangement of [[quadrupole magnet|quadrupole]] and [[sextupole magnet]]s can give a suitable [[strong focusing]] system that can give a much smaller beam size. The [[FODO]] and [[Chasman-Green lattice]] structures are simple examples of strong focusing systems, but there are many others.

Dipole and quadrupole magnets deflect different particle energies by differing amounts, a property called [[chromaticity]] by analogy with physical [[optics]]. The spread of energies that is inherently present in any practical stored particle beam will therefore give rise to a spread of transverse and longitudinal focusing, as well as contributing to various particle beam instabilities. [[Sextupole magnet]]s (and higher order magnets) are used to correct for this phenomenon, but this in turn gives rise to [[nonlinear]] motion that is one of the main problems facing designers of storage rings.

=== Vacuum===

As the bunches will travel many millions of kilometers (considering that they will be moving at near the speed of light for many hours), any residual gas in the beam pipe will result in many, many collisions.  This will have the effect of increasing the size of the bunch, and increasing the energy spread.  Therefore, a better [[vacuum]] yields better beam dynamics. Also, single large-angle scattering events from either the residual gas, or from other particles in the bunch ([[Touschek effect]]), can eject particles far enough that they are lost on the walls of the accelerator vacuum vessel. This gradual loss of particles is called beam lifetime, and means that storage rings must be periodically injected with a new complement of particles.

===Particle injection and timing===

Injection of particles into a storage ring may be accomplished in a number of ways, depending on the application of the storage ring. The simplest method uses one or more pulsed deflecting dipole magnets ([[injection kicker magnets]]) to steer an incoming train of particles onto the stored beam path; the kicker magnets are turned off before the stored train returns to the injection point, thus resulting in a stored beam. This method is sometimes called single-turn injection.

Multi-turn injection allows accumulation of many incoming trains of particles, for example if a large stored current is required. For particles such as protons where there is no significant beam damping, each injected pulse is placed onto a particular point in the stored beam transverse or longitudinal [[phase space]], taking care not to eject previously-injected trains by using a careful arrangement of beam deflection and coherent oscillations in the stored beam. If there is significant beam damping, for example [[radiation damping]] of electrons due to [[synchrotron radiation]], then an injected pulse may be placed on the edge of phase space and then left to damp in transverse phase space into the stored beam before injecting a further pulse. Typical damping times from synchrotron radiation are tens of milliseconds, allowing many pulses per second to be accumulated.

If extraction of particles is required (for example in a chain of accelerators), then single-turn extraction may be performed analogously to injection. Resonant extraction may also be employed.

=== Beam dynamics ===

The particles must be stored for very large numbers of turns potentially larger than 10 billion.  This long term stability is challenging, and one must combine the magnet design with tracking codes.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g., [https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/atcollab/index.php?title=Main_Page Accelerator Toolbox] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203063433/http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/atcollab/index.php?title=Main_Page |date=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and analytical tools in order to understand and optimize the long term stability.

In the case of electron storage rings, radiation damping eases the stability problem by providing a non-Hamiltonian motion returning the electrons to the design orbit on the order of the thousands of turns.  Together with diffusion from the fluccuations in the radiated photon energies, an equilibrium beam distribution is reached.  One may look at &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sla,c.stanford.edu/pubs/slacreports/slac-r-121.html{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} The Physics of Electron Storage Rings: An Introduction by Matt Sands&lt;/ref&gt; for further details on some of these topics.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carbon isotopes==
Carbon has three naturally occurring [[isotopes]]. About 99% of carbon on Earth is [[carbon]]-12 ([[Carbon-12|&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C]]), about 1% is carbon-13 ([[Carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]]), and a trace amount is carbon-14 ([[Carbon-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]]). The  &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C and  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C isotopes are stable, while &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C decays radioactively to [[nitrogen]]-14 ([[Nitrogen-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N]]) with a [[half life]] of 5730 years. &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C on Earth is produced nearly exclusively by the interaction of cosmic radiation with the upper atmosphere. A &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C atom is created when a [[Neutron temperature|thermal neutron]] displaces a [[proton]] in &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N. Minuscule amounts of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C are produced by other radioactive processes, and a significant amount was released into the atmosphere during nuclear testing before the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]]. Natural &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C production and hence atmospheric concentration varies only slightly over time.

Plants take up &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C by fixing atmospheric carbon through [[photosynthesis]]. Animals then take &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C into their bodies when they consume plants (or consume other animals that consume plants). Thus, living plants and animals have the same ratio of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C to &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C as the atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Once organisms die they stop exchanging carbon with the atmosphere, and thus no longer take up new &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C. Radioactive decay then gradually depletes the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C in the organism. This effect is the basis of [[radiocarbon dating]].

[[Photosynthesis|Photosynthetically]] fixed carbon in terrestrial plants is depleted in &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C compared to atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Farquhar |first1=G. D. |last2=Ehleringer |first2=J. R. |last3=Hubick |first3=K. T. |title=Carbon Isotope Discrimination and Photosynthesis |journal=Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. |doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.40.060189.002443 |volume=40 |pages=503–537}}&lt;/ref&gt; This depletion is slight in [[C4 carbon fixation|C4]] plants but much greater in [[C3 carbon fixation|C3]] plants which form the bulk of terrestrial biomass worldwide. Depletion in [[Crassulacean acid metabolism|CAM]] plants vary between the values observed for C3 and C4 plants. In addition, most fossil fuels originate from C3 biological material produced tens to hundreds of millions of years ago. C4 plants did not become common until about 6 to 8 million years ago, and although CAM photosynthesis is present in [[Isoetes|modern relatives]] of the [[Lepidodendron|Lepidodendrales]] of the [[Carboniferous]] lowland forests, even if these plants also had CAM photosynthesis they were not a major component of the total biomass.

Fossil fuels such as [[coal]] and [[petroleum|oil]] are made primarily of plant material that was deposited millions of years ago. This period of time equates to thousands of half-lives of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C, so essentially all of the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C in fossil fuels has decayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bozhinova |first1=D. |last2=van der Molen |first2=M.

Therefore, the carbon from fossil fuels that is returned to the atmosphere through combustion is depleted in both &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C compared to atmospheric carbon dioxide.

[[Image:Tepeyollotl.jpg|thumb|right|Tepeyollotl in the [[Codex Telleriano-Remensis]].]]
In [[Aztec mythology]], '''Tepēyōllōtl''' {{IPA-nah|tepeːˈju˕ːɬːu˕ːtɬ}} ("heart of the mountains"; also '''Tepeyollotli''') was the god of [[earthquake]]s, [[echo (phenomenon)|echoes]] and [[jaguar]]s.  He is the god of the Eighth Hour of the Night, and is depicted as a jaguar leaping towards the sun. In the calendar, Tepeyollotl rules over both the third day, Calli (house), and the third trecena, 1-Mazatl (deer). He is the eighth Lord of the Night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.azteccalendar.com/god/Tepeyollotl.html|title=Tepeyollotl, the Heart of the Mountain|website=www.azteccalendar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is derived as a compound of the [[Nahuatl]] words ''{{Lang|nci|tepētl}}'' ("mountain"), and ''{{Lang|nci|yōllōtl}}'' ("heart" or "interior"). Tepeyollotl is usually depicted as cross-eyed holding the typical white staff with green feathers. Sometimes Tezcatlipoca wore Tepeyollotl for an animal skin or disguise to trick other gods into not knowing who he was.

A '''tetrode''' is a [[vacuum tube]] (called ''valve'' in British English) having four active [[electrode]]s.  The four electrodes in order from the centre are: a [[thermionic cathode]], first and second grids and a [[plate electrode|plate]] (called ''anode'' in British English).   There are several varieties of tetrodes, the most common being the '''screen-grid tube''' and the [[beam tetrode]]. In screen-grid tubes and beam tetrodes, the first grid is the [[control grid]] and the second grid is the '''screen grid'''.&lt;ref&gt;L.W. Turner, (ed), ''Electronics Engineer's Reference Book'', 4th ed. London: [[Newnes-Butterworth]] 1976 {{ISBN|0408001682}} pages 7-19&lt;/ref&gt; In other tetrodes one of the grids is a control grid, while the other may have a variety of functions.

The tetrode was developed in the 1920s by adding an additional grid to the first amplifying vacuum tube, the [[triode]], to correct limitations of the triode. During the period 1913 to 1927, three distinct types of tetrode valves appeared.  All had a normal control grid whose function was to act as a primary control for current passing through the tube, but they differed according to the intended function of the other grid. In order of historical appearance these are: the '''space-charge grid tube''', the '''bi-grid valve''', and the '''screen-grid tube'''. The last of these appeared in two distinct variants with different areas of application: the screen-grid valve proper, which was used for medium-frequency, small signal amplification, and the beam tetrode which appeared later, and was used for audio or radio-frequency power amplification.  The former was quickly superseded by the rf [[pentode]], while the latter was initially developed as an alternative to the pentode as an audio power amplifying device.  The beam tetrode was also developed as a high power radio transmitting tube.

Tetrodes were widely used in many consumer electronic devices such as radios, televisions, and audio systems until [[transistor]]s replaced valves in the 1960s and 70s. Beam tetrodes have remained in use until quite recently in power applications such as audio amplifiers and radio transmitters.

==How it works==
[[Image:4-1000A linear RF deck build by K5LAD.jpg|thumb|4-1000A 1 KW power tetrode in an amateur radio transmitter]]
The tetrode functions in a similar way to the [[triode]], from which it was developed.  A current through the heater or filament heats the [[cathode]], which causes it to emit electrons by [[thermionic emission]].  A positive voltage is applied between the plate and cathode, causing a flow of electrons from the cathode to plate through the two grids.  A varying voltage applied to the [[control grid]] can control this current, causing variations in the plate current.  With a resistive or other load in the plate circuit, the varying current will result in a varying voltage at the plate.  With proper [[biasing]], this voltage will be an amplified (but inverted) version of the AC voltage applied to the control grid, thus the tetrode can provide voltage [[Gain (electronics)|gain]]. In the tetrode, the function of the other grid varies according to the type of tetrode; this is discussed below.

==Space charge grid tube==
The space charge grid tube was the first type of tetrode to appear.  In the course of his research into the action of the "[[audion]]" triode tube of [[Lee de Forest]], [[Irving Langmuir]] found that the action of the heated [[thermionic cathode]] was to create a [[space charge]], or cloud of electrons, around the [[cathode]].  This cloud acted as a virtual cathode.  With low applied anode voltage, many of the electrons in the [[space charge]] returned to the cathode, and did not contribute to the anode current; only those at its outer limit would be affected by the [[electric field]] due to the anode, and would be accelerated towards it.  However, if a grid bearing a low positive applied potential (about 10V) were inserted between the cathode and the control grid, the space charge could be made to extend further away from the cathode.  This had two advantageous effects, both related to the influence of the electric fields of the other electrodes (anode and control grid) on the electrons of the space charge.  Firstly, a significant increase in anode current could be achieved with low anode voltage; the valve could be made to work well with lower applied anode voltage.  Secondly the [[transconductance]] (rate of change of anode current with respect to control grid voltage) of the tube was increased. The latter effect was particularly important since it increased the voltage gain available from the valve.

Space-charge valves remained useful devices throughout the valve era, and were used in applications such as car radios operating directly from a 12V supply, where only a low anode voltage was available.   The same principle was applied to other types of multi-grid tubes such as [[pentode]]s.  As an example, the Sylvania 12K5 is described as "a tetrode designed for space-charge operation.  It is intended for service as a power amplifier driver where the potentials are obtained directly from a 12V automobile battery."  The space-charge grid was operated at +12V, the same as the anode supply voltage.

Another important application of the space-charge tetrode was as an [[electrometer]] tube for detecting and measuring extremely small currents.  For example, the General Electric FP54 was described as a "space-charge grid tube ... designed to have a very high input impedance and a very low grid current.  It is designed particularly for amplification of direct currents smaller than about 10{{su|p=−9}} amperes, and has been found capable of measuring currents as small as 5 x 10{{su|p=−18}} amperes.  It has a current amplification factor of 250,000, and operates with an anode voltage of 12v, and space-charge grid voltage of +4V."

Note that when a space-charge grid is added to a [[triode]], the first grid in the resulting tetrode is the space-charge grid, and the second grid is the [[control grid]].

==Bi-grid valve==
In the bi-grid type of tetrode, both grids are intended to carry electrical signals, so both are control grids.  The first example to appear in Britain was the Marconi-Osram FE1, which was designed by H.J. Round, and became available in 1920.&lt;ref name="Thrower"/&gt; The tube was intended to be used in a [[reflex receiver|reflex]] circuit (for example the single-valve ship receiver Type 91&lt;ref name="Scott-Taggart"&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Bigrid transmitter.jpg|thumb|right|Circuit using bi-grid tetrode [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]] as AM transmitter]]
One application is shown in the illustration.  This is recognisable as an AM telephony transmitter in which the second grid and the anode form a power [[oscillator]], and the first grid acts as a modulating electrode. The anode current in the valve, and hence the RF output amplitude, is modulated by the voltage on G1, which is derived from a carbon microphone.

A tube of this type could also be used as a direct conversion CW receiver. Here the valve oscillates as a consequence of coupling between the first grid and the anode, while the second grid is coupled to the antenna.  The AF beat frequency is audible in the headphones.  The valve acts as a self-oscillating [[product detector]].&lt;ref name="Scott-Taggart 1919"&gt;{{cite book

Another, very similar application of the bi-grid valve was as a self oscillating [[frequency mixer]] in early superhet receivers&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite book

One control grid carried the incoming rf signal, while the other was connected into an [[oscillator]] circuit which generated the local oscillation within the same valve.  Since the anode current of the bi-grid valve was proportional both to the signal on the first grid, and also to the oscillator voltage on the second grid, the required multiplication of the two signals was achieved, and the intermediate frequency signal appeared in an appropriately [[tuned circuit]] connected to the anode.  In all of the applications mentioned, the bi-grid tetrode acted as an analogue multiplier ([[analog multiplier]]) which multiplied together the signals applied to the two grids.

The super-sonic [[heterodyne]] ([[superhet]]) receiver principle was invented in France by Lucien Levy in 1917&lt;ref&gt;&lt;Thrower&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (p 66), though credit is usually also given to [[Edwin Armstrong]]. The original reason for the invention of the superhet was that before the appearance of the screen-grid valve, there was no type of valve which could give good gain at radio frequencies (i.e. frequencies much above 100&amp;nbsp;kHz), so a technique was applied whereby the incoming rf signal was "mixed" (i.e. multiplied) with a locally generated oscillatory voltage (the [[local oscillator]]) so as to produce a [[beat frequency]] at the significantly lower frequency of about 30&amp;nbsp;kHz.  This represented the incoming signal in all important respects, but at a lower frequency, at which it could be successfully amplified by a [[multistage amplifiers|multistage]] tuned triode amplifier before being applied to the detector.&lt;ref name="Admiralty"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a complicated technique.  It went out of use when screen-grid valves appeared which could act as satisfactory rf amplifiers capable of amplifying the incoming signal without lowering its frequency (see Screen grid valve, below). [[Superhet]] receivers reappeared in the early 1930s when, because of the proliferation of transmitting stations, their greater selectivity became an important advantage; almost all receivers operate on this principle today, albeit with a higher if frequency.

==Screen grid valve==
[[File:S23 screen grid valves in music magnet.jpg|thumb|right|Two S23 screen-grid valves in a 1929 Osram Music Magnet receiver]]
[[File:S23 sg valve.JPG|thumb|right|View of the interior of an Osram S23 screen grid valve.  In this valve the anode is in the form of two flat plates. The wires of the screen grid can also be seen. The anode connection is at the top of the envelope to minimise anode-grid capacitance]]
[[Image:S625 screen grid tube.png|thumb|The Marconi-Osram S625, the first commercially produced screen grid tube which came out 1926.  The screen is a cylinder with a metal gauze face that completely surrounds the plate, and the tube is double-ended, with the plate terminal at one end and the grid at the other, to improve isolation between the electrodes.]]
In the screen grid class of tetrode, the main function of the second grid is to act as an [[electrostatic screen]] between the anode and the control grid (i.e. the first grid) in order to reduce the internal [[capacitance]] between control grid and anode.  The first true screen-grid valve, with a screen grid designed for this purpose, was patented by Hiroshi Ando in 1919, and the first practical versions were built by N. H. Williams and [[Albert Hull]] at [[General Electric]]  and [[Bernard Tellegen]] at Phillips in 1926.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book

This type of tetrode was developed to correct deficiencies in the [[triode]] tube which became apparent when attempts were made to use triodes as small-signal radio-frequency [[amplifiers]].  In the triode, the control grid was next to the plate.  Capacitance between these two electrodes caused instability and oscillation when both anode and grid were connected into tuned resonant circuits, as was the case in early radios, or in any application where the anode circuit presented an inductive reactive load to the valve.&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;{{cite book

A second advantage of the tetrode, which also arose from reduced anode-grid capacitance, was that, when the anode voltage was in a certain range, changing its value had much less effect on the anode current than was the case with triodes. This corresponds to an increased anode slope resistance, and allowed much higher voltage gain by permitting a larger external load resistance.  At the time of the introduction of screen-grid valves (around 1927) a typical small triode used for small-signal amplification had an anode slope resistance of 20kOhms or less, and a grid-anode capacitance of 1 to 5[[farad|pF]], while the corresponding figures for a typical screen grid valve were 1MOhm and 0.004[[farad|pF]] - in some cases much less capacitance.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1976, page 7-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Screen-grid valves were capable of greater [[voltage gain]] and higher [[frequency]] capability than triodes, and permitted the development of the first true RF amplifiers in the MF and HF frequency ranges in radio equipment.  They were commonly used as the first stage of radio-frequency amplification in domestic radio receivers in the period 1927 to 1930, after which they were superseded in this application by RF pentodes. Triodes were ill-suited to this type of application on account of their relatively high anode-grid capacitance and low anode resistance.

In normal operation the screen grid is connected to a positive DC voltage slightly less than the plate voltage, and bypassed to the cathode with a [[capacitor]], so it was at AC ground.  To take full advantage of the very low internal grid-anode capacitance, the valve must be used in circuits in which the shielding between anode and grid is continued externally.  In the case illustrated (S625), the valve was intended to be inserted into a hole in an external, grounded, sheet-metal shield aligned to correspond with the position of the internal screen-grid.  The input, or control-grid circuit was on one side of the shield, while the anode, or output circuit was on the other.  In the case of the Osram Music Magnet, each entire stage of the 2-stage rf amplifier, as well as the tuned detector stage, was enclosed in an individual large aluminium screening box.  These boxes have been removed in the illustration, but the up-turned edges of the bases of the boxes can be seen.

==Anode characteristic of screen-grid valves==
The reason for the limited applicability of the screen-grid valve, and its rapid replacement by the RF [[pentode]] (introduced around 1930) was the peculiar anode characteristic (i.e. variation of anode current with respect to anode voltage) of the former type of tube.
[[File:RCA 24-A Screen Grid tube anode characteristics.jpg|thumb|right|At certain values of plate voltage and current, the tetrode characteristic curves are kinked due to [[secondary emission]] from the anode.  In the normal range of anode voltages, the anode current is substantially constant with respect to anode voltage.  Both features are quite unlike the corresponding curves for a triode, for which anode current increases continuously with increasing slope throughout.]]
In normal applications, the anode voltage was about 150V, while that of the screen-grid was about 60V (Thrower p 183).&lt;ref name="Thrower" /&gt;  As the screen grid is positive with respect to the cathode, it collects a certain fraction (perhaps a quarter) of the electrons which would otherwise pass from the grid region to the anode.  This causes current to flow in the screen grid circuit.  Usually, the screen current due to this cause is small, and of little interest.  However, if the anode voltage should be below that of the screen, the screen grid can also collect [[secondary emission|secondary electrons]] ejected from the anode by the impact of the energetic primary electrons.  Both effects tend to reduce the anode current. If the anode voltage is increased from a low value, with the screen grid at its normal operating voltage (60V, say) the anode current initially increases rapidly because more of those electrons which pass through the screen-grid are collected by the anode rather than passing back to the screen grid.  This part of the tetrode anode characteristic resembles the corresponding part of that of a [[triode]] or [[pentode]].  However, when the anode voltage is increased further, the electrons arriving at the anode have sufficient energy to cause copious secondary emission, and many of these secondary electrons will be captured by the screen, which is at a higher positive voltage than the anode. This causes the anode current to fall rather than increase when the anode voltage is increased.  In some cases the anode current can actually become negative (current flows out of the anode); this is possible since each primary electron may produce more than one secondary. Falling positive anode current accompanied by rising anode voltage gives the anode characteristic a region of negative slope, and this corresponds to a [[negative resistance]] which can cause instability in certain circuits.  In a higher range of anode voltage, the anode voltage sufficiently exceeds that of the screen for an increasing proportion of the secondary electrons to be attracted back to the anode, so the anode current increases once more, and the slope of the anode characteristic becomes positive again.  In a yet higher range of anode voltages, the anode current becomes substantially constant, since all of the secondary electrons now return to the anode, and the main control of current through the tube is the voltage of the control grid. This is the normal operating mode of the tube.&lt;ref name="Terman"&gt;{{cite book

The anode characteristic of a screen-grid valve is thus quite unlike that of a [[triode]].  It includes a range of anode voltages, where the anode voltage is less than that of the screen grid, in which there is a distinctive [[negative resistance]] characteristic, sometimes called "tetrode kink".  This is usually undesirable, although it can be exploited as in the [[dynatron oscillator]] (Eastman, p 431).&lt;ref name="Eastman" /&gt; The approximately constant-current region of low slope at high anode voltage is also a distinctive characteristic of the tetrode.  This is highly desirable, since it corresponds to a high [[source resistance]] in the anode circuit, and greatly enhances the voltage gain which the device can produce. Early screen-grid valves had amplification factors (i.e. the product of [[transconductance]] and anode slope resistance) ten times that of comparable small-signal triodes.&lt;ref name="RCA"&gt;{{cite book

[[File:6J7 pentode anode characteristics.jpg|thumb|right|Typical pentode anode characteristic.  There is a wide range of anode voltages in which the characteristic has a small positive slope. In a screen-grid tube this region is restricted to a much narrower range at high anode voltages.]]
In practice the negative-resistance kink of the anode characteristic limits the usefulness of the screen-grid valve to applications where only small signals are amplified, so that the variations in anode voltage are also correspondingly small, and the operating conditions never depart from the region of high positive impedance (low positive slope) at large anode voltage. The [[secondary emission]] can be prevented from contributing to the screen current (and thus detracting from the anode current) by adding a [[suppressor grid]], making a  [[pentode]], or [[beam tetrode|beam plates]] to make a [[beam tetrode]]/kinkless tetrode, which can be used in power amplifiers where the variations of anode voltage, due to the presence of a large signal voltage, are much greater. The anode characteristics of these tubes are very similar to [[pentode]]s.  In both cases the anode current rises rapidly to an approximately constant value when the anode voltage rises to as little as a few tens of volts, and the region of high positive anode resistance (low slope) extends from this low value up to the maximum anode voltage which could be several hundred volts or more.

The negative resistance operating region of the tetrode is exploited in the [[dynatron oscillator]], which is an example of a negative resistance oscillator.  (Eastman, p431)&lt;ref name="Eastman" /&gt;

The high value of the anode slope resistance of tetrodes (mentioned above) makes them capable of high voltage and power gain, and is also potentially a cause of high anode efficiency which, if it could be exploited, would make tetrodes superior to [[triode]]s as power amplifying devices in applications such as audio power amplifiers, and the output stages of radio transmitters. For a triode power amplifier working with a transformer or inductive load in Class A, the maximum theoretical efficiency is 25%.  This low figure is in part a consequence of the low anode slope impedance (Ra) of this type of tube; the low value of a triode Ra is almost always much less than the optimal anode load impedance in a power amplifier.  For a pentode or tetrode, however, Ra is usually sufficiently high for the optimal load impedance to be achieved, and under these circumstances the maximum theoretical efficiency rises to 50%.&lt;ref name="Gavin &amp; Houldin"&gt;{{cite book

However, the tetrode kink limits the permissible variation of anode voltage, and restricts the use of screen-grid valves to small-signal applications.  The [[suppressor grid]] of the [[pentode]] eliminates the kink in the anode characteristic by preventing secondary electrons, which originate in the anode, from reaching the screen grid, and thus permits a wider excursion of anode voltage, as is required for power amplification.  The same effect can be produced in the case of a tetrode by introducing two modifications. Firstly, the wires of the screen grid are aligned with those of the control grid so that the former lie in the electron 'shadow' created by the latter. This reduces the screen grid current, thereby giving greater efficiency, and also concentrates the electrons into dense beams in the space between the screen grid and the anode.  The intense negative [[space charge]] of these beams prevents [[secondary electrons]] from the anode from reaching the screen grid, thus eliminated the tetrode kink. Secondly, in small valves whose electrode structure is supported in the conventional way with vertical wire rods and mica spacers, it was found to be necessary to introduce sheet-metal beam-forming electrodes between the screen grid and the anode.  The purpose of these beam-plates is to constrain the electron beams into parts of the electrode system which are sections of a cylinder.&lt;ref name="Shade"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See sectional view, right).   Successful creation of the electron beam between screen grid and anode required for a kinkless anode characteristic depends on the details of the geometry of the electrode structure of the beam tetrode. In the cases where the electrodes have complete cylindrical symmetry, a kinkless characteristic can be achieved without the need for beam-plates, alignment of the screen grid wires with those of the control grid being sufficient. This form of construction is usually adopted in the larger tubes with an anode power rating of 100W or more.  The Eimac 4CX250B (rated at 250W anode dissipation) is an example of this class of beam tetrode. Note that a radically different approach is taken to the design of the support system for the electrodes in these types (see illustration).  The 4CX250B is described by its manufacturer as a 'radial beam tetrode', drawing attention to the symmetry of its electrode system.

The overall effect of the original developments was to produce a highly effective power amplifier tube, whose anode characteristic is very much like that of a [[pentode]], but which has greater efficiency as a result of reduced screen current.  A further bonus was that third [[harmonic distortion]] was much reduced relative to a comparable [[pentode]] (Terman pp 198–9).&lt;ref name="Terman" /&gt; [[Beam tetrode]] audio power output valves were introduced in 1937, and quickly replaced conventional pentodes in this application.  Later developments produced beam power tubes which were capable of high-power output at frequencies extending into the UHF region.

The beam tetrode was invented in Britain by two EMI engineers, Cabot Bull and Sidney Rodda, as an attempt to circumvent the power pentode, whose patent was owned by Philips.  It was patented in 1933.&lt;ref name="Bull &amp; Rodda"&gt;{{cite book

Although the beam-plates (when present) could be counted as a fifth electrode (as in a pentode), this type of tube is nevertheless classified as a tetrode, perhaps to underline the difference in principle from that employed in true pentodes, which rely upon the effect of a suppressor grid. Beam tetrodes were widely used as audio power amplifying tubes in consumer and industrial electronic equipment such as radios and televisions until the 1960s when they were replaced by [[transistor]]s.  Their main use now is in high power industrial applications such as radio transmitters.  Low power consumer beam tetrodes are still used in a few legacy and specialty vacuum tube audio power amplifier devices such as tube [[guitar amplifier]]s; the [[KT66]] and [[KT88]] are popular examples in audio equipment, while QY4-400 is an example having 400W anode dissipation, capable of applications in radio transmitters up to 100&amp;nbsp;MHz.  The 4CX250B, mentioned above can be operated at full 250W anode dissipation up to 500&amp;nbsp;MHz.  Many other types abound.

==Critical-distance tetrode==
An alternative approach to the problem of eliminating the tetrode kink was introduced by Hivac in 1935.  It was found by J.H Owen Harries that if the separation of the anode from the screen grid were varied, a critical separation could be found (about 3&amp;nbsp;cm) where the kink in the tetrode's anode characteristic disappeared, and the amplification of the valve became particularly distortion-free.&lt;ref name="Harries"&gt;{{cite book

A range of tetrodes of this type were introduced, aimed at the domestic receiver market, some having 2V directly heated filaments, intended for low-power battery-operated sets, others with 4V or higher, indirectly heated cathodes for mains operation.  Output powers ranged from 0.5W to 11.5W .  Confusingly, several of these new valves bore the same type number as existing pentodes with almost identical characteristics. Examples include Y220 (0.5W, 2V filament), AC/Y (3W, 4V heater), AC/Q (11.5W, 4V heater), etc.&lt;ref name="Harries" /&gt;

[[File:VAMTOX.jpg|thumb|right]]
'''Ventilation air methane thermal oxidizers '''(or '''VAMTOX''') are a type of processing equipment used for [[greenhouse gas]] abatement related to [[underground mining]] operations that destroys gaseous [[methane]] at a high temperature.

==Principle==

Ventilation Air Methane Thermal Oxidizers are used to destroy methane in the exhaust air of underground [[coal mine]] shafts. Methane is a greenhouse gas that burns to form [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and water vapour. Carbon dioxide is 25 times less potent than methane when emitted into the atmosphere with regards to [[global warming]]. Concentrations of methane in ventilation exhaust air of coal and [[trona]] mines are very dilute; typically below 1% and often below 0.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://rto.american-environmental.us/VAMTOX.html|title= Ventilation air methane thermal oxidizer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flow rates are so high that ventilation air methane constitutes the largest source of [[methane emissions]] at most mines. This methane emission wastes energy and contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

==Operation==

[[Thermal oxidizer|Thermal oxidation]] is the most widely accepted air pollution control technologies used in industrial applications. Ventilation Air Methane Thermal Oxidizers are commonly referred to as a VAMTOX. They are very specific and extremely efficient – energy recovery efficiency can reach 95%. This is achieved through the storage of heat in dense ceramic stoneware. Ventilation Air Methane Thermal Oxidizers are used for the very low methane concentrations operate continuously. These systems can destroy 95-98+% methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) that would otherwise be emitted. Ventilation Air Methane Thermal Oxidizers can be designed with hot gas bypass systems, re-circulation heat exchangers that convert heat into energy, and oxygen monitoring to reduce any possible carbon monoxide and/or nitrous oxide production. Methane streams allow the VAMTOX to operate at reduced or zero fuel usage, which makes these systems ideal for mine shaft ventilation operations.

VAMTOX systems have a system of valves and dampers that direct the methane flow across the ceramic bed. On system start up,  the system preheats and raises the temperature of the heat exchange material in the oxidizer bed to or above the auto-oxidation temperature of methane (1,000&amp;nbsp;°C or 1,832&amp;nbsp;°F). Then the preheating system is turned off and mine exhaust air is introduced. When the methane-filled air reaches the preheated bed, it oxidizes and releases heat. This heat is transferred to the bed, thereby maintaining its temperature to support continued operation. The oxidation process is flameless. Once the bed is preheated, the process needs no auxiliary energy so long as adequate inflow methane concentrations are maintained. The VAMTOX system exhaust gases can be used to raise steam, which can provide electrical power through a turbine generator.

A '''wind turbine''', or alternatively referred to as a '''wind energy converter''', is a device that [[wind power|converts]] the wind's [[kinetic energy]] into [[electrical energy]].

Wind turbines are manufactured  in a wide range of vertical and horizontal axis. The smallest turbines are used for applications such as [[battery charging]] for auxiliary power for boats or [[Travel trailer|caravans]] or to power traffic warning signs. Slightly larger turbines can be used for making contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the [[electrical grid]]. Arrays of [[List of most powerful wind turbines|large turbines]], known as [[wind farm]]s, are becoming an increasingly important source of intermittent  [[renewable energy]] and are used by many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on [[fossil fuel]]s. One assessment claimed that, {{asof|lc=y|2009}}, wind had the "lowest relative greenhouse gas emissions, the least water consumption demands and... the most favourable social impacts" compared to photovoltaic, hydro, geothermal, coal and gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Evans |first=Annette |last2=Strezov |first2=Vladimir |last3=Evans |first3=Tim |date=June 2009 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032108000555?via%3Dihub |title=Assessment of sustainability indicators for renewable energy technologies |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2008.03.008 |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=1082–1088 |via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of wind power}}
[[File:James Blyth's 1891 windmill.jpg|thumb|left|James Blyth's electricity-generating wind turbine, photographed in 1891]]
The windwheel of [[Hero of Alexandria]] (10 AD – 70 AD) marks one of the first recorded instances of wind powering a machine in history.&lt;ref name="Drachmann"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Drachmann | first1 = A.G. | year = 1961 | title = Heron's Windmill | url = | journal = Centaurus | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 145–151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lohrmann 10f."&gt;Dietrich Lohrmann, "Von der östlichen zur westlichen Windmühle", ''Archiv für Kulturgeschichte'', Vol. 77, Issue 1 (1995), pp. 1–30 (10f.)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first known practical wind power plants were built in [[Sistan]], an Eastern province of [[Persia]] (now Iran), from the 7th century. These "[[Panemone windmill|Panemone]]" were vertical axle windmills, which had long vertical [[drive shaft]]s with rectangular blades.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ahmad Y Hassan]], [[Donald Routledge Hill]] (1986). ''Islamic Technology: An illustrated history'', p. 54. [[Cambridge University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-521-42239-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Made of six to twelve [[Windmill sail|sails]] covered in reed matting or cloth material, these windmills were used to grind grain or draw up water, and were used in the [[gristmill]]ing and sugarcane industries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]], "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''Scientific American'', May 1991, p. 64-69. ([[cf.]] [[Donald Routledge Hill]], [http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm Mechanical Engineering])&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind power first appeared in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]. The first historical records of their use in England date to the 11th or 12th centuries and there are reports of German [[crusades|crusaders]] taking their windmill-making skills to Syria around 1190.&lt;ref name="Morthorst"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Morthorst, Poul Erik |author2=Redlinger, Robert Y. |author3=Andersen, Per |title=Wind energy in the 21st century: economics, policy, technology and the changing electricity industry |publisher=Palgrave/UNEP |location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-333-79248-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 14th century, Dutch windmills were in use to drain areas of the [[Rhine]] delta. Advanced wind turbines were described by Croatian inventor [[Fausto Veranzio]]. In his book Machinae Novae (1595) he described [[vertical axis wind turbine]]s with curved or V-shaped blades.

The first electricity-generating wind turbine was a battery charging machine installed in July 1887 by Scottish academic [[James Blyth (engineer)|James Blyth]] to light his holiday home in [[Marykirk]], Scotland.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB |last=Price |first=Trevor J. |id=100957 |title=Blyth, James (1839–1906) |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some months later American inventor [[Charles F. Brush]] was able to build the first automatically operated wind turbine after consulting local University professors and colleagues [[Jacob S. Gibbs]] and [[Brinsley Coleberd]] and successfully getting the blueprints peer-reviewed for electricity production in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; Although Blyth's turbine was considered uneconomical in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; electricity generation by wind turbines was more cost effective in countries with widely scattered populations.&lt;ref name="Morthorst" /&gt;

[[File:Wind turbine 1888 Charles Brush.jpg|thumb|The first automatically operated wind turbine, built in Cleveland in 1887 by Charles F. Brush. It was {{convert|60|ft|m|sp=us}} tall, weighed 4 tons (3.6 metric tonnes) and powered a 12 [[Kilowatt|kW]] generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.windpower.org/en/pictures/brush.htm |title=A Wind Energy Pioneer: Charles F.

In Denmark by 1900, there were about 2500 windmills for mechanical loads such as pumps and mills, producing an estimated combined peak power of about 30 ([[megawatt|MW]]). The largest machines were on {{convert|24|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} towers with four-bladed {{convert|23|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} diameter rotors. By 1908 there were 72 wind-driven electric generators operating in the United States from 5 [[Kilowatt|kW]] to 25 [[Kilowatt|kW]]. Around the time of World War I, American windmill makers were producing 100,000 farm windmills each year, mostly for water-pumping.&lt;ref name="Aermotor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/weather/weatherwise/stories/MYSA092407.01A.State_windmills.3430a27.html |title=Quirky old-style contraptions make water from wind on the mesas of West Texas |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203053651/http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/weather/weatherwise/stories/MYSA092407.01A.State_windmills.3430a27.html |archive-date=3 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, wind generators for electricity were common on farms, mostly in the United States where distribution systems had not yet been installed. In this period, high-tensile steel was cheap, and the generators were placed atop prefabricated open steel lattice towers.

A forerunner of modern horizontal-axis wind generators was in service at [[Yalta]], USSR in 1931. This was a 100 [[Kilowatt|kW]] generator on a {{convert|30|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} tower, connected to the local 6.3&amp;nbsp;kV distribution system. It was reported to have an annual [[capacity factor]] of 32 percent, not much different from current wind machines.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Wyatt: ''Electric Power: Challenges and Choices''. Book Press Ltd., Toronto 1986, {{ISBN|0-920650-00-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.en.wind-turbine-models.com/turbines/1035-krasnovsky-wime-d-30|title=Bauer, Lucas.

In the autumn of 1941, the first megawatt-class wind turbine was synchronized to a utility grid in [[Vermont]]. The [[Smith-Putnam wind turbine]] only ran for 1,100 hours before suffering a critical failure. The unit was not repaired, because of a shortage of materials during the war.

The first utility grid-connected wind turbine to operate in the UK was built by [[John Brown &amp; Company]] in 1951 in the [[Orkney|Orkney Islands]].&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orkneywind.co.uk/costa.html |title=Costa Head Experimental Wind Turbine |last=Anon |website=Orkney Sustainable Energy Website |publisher=Orkney Sustainable Energy Ltd |accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these diverse developments, developments in fossil fuel systems almost entirely eliminated any wind turbine systems larger than supermicro size.  In the early 1970s, however, anti-nuclear protests in Denmark spurred artisan mechanics to develop microturbines of 22 [[Kilowatt|kW]].  Organizing owners into associations and co-operatives lead to the lobbying of the government and utilities and provided incentives for larger turbines throughout the 1980s and later.  Local activists in Germany, nascent turbine manufacturers in Spain, and large investors in the United States in the early 1990s then lobbied for policies that stimulated the industry in those countries.

{{Main|Wind power}}

[[Wind#Wind power density|Wind Power Density]] (WPD) is a quantitative measure of  wind energy available at any location. It is the mean annual power available per square meter of swept area of a turbine, and is calculated for different heights above ground. Calculation of [[wind profile power law#Wind power density|wind power density]] includes the effect of wind velocity and air density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrel.gov/gis/wind.html |title=NREL: Dynamic Maps, GIS Data, and Analysis Tools&amp;nbsp;– Wind Maps |publisher=Nrel.gov |date=3 September 2013 |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind turbines are classified by the wind speed they are designed for, from class I to class III, with A to C referring to the turbulence intensity of the wind. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Appendix II IEC Classification of Wind Turbines |pages=269–270 |publisher=Wind Resource Assessment and Micro-siting, Science and Engineering |doi=10.1002/9781118900116.app2 |chapter=Appendix II: IEC Classification of Wind Turbines |year=2015 |isbn=9781118900116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efficiency ==
[[Conservation of mass]] requires that the amount of air entering and exiting a turbine must be equal. Accordingly, [[Betz's law]] gives the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine as 16/27 (59.3%) of the total kinetic energy of the air flowing through the turbine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/library/digitalcommons/assets/pacp_7.pdf |title=The Physics of Wind Turbines Kira Grogg Carleton College, 2005, p.8 |format=PDF |access-date=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maximum theoretical power output of a wind machine is thus 16/27 times the kinetic energy of the air passing through the effective disk area of the machine. If the effective area of the disk is A, and the wind velocity v, the maximum theoretical power output P is:

:&lt;math&gt;
P=\frac{16}{27}\frac{1}{2}\rho v^3 A = \frac{8}{27}\rho v^3 A
&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''ρ'' is the [[air density]].

Wind-to-rotor efficiency (including rotor blade [[friction]] and [[drag (physics)|drag]]) are among the factors impacting the final [[price]] of wind power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://windeis.anl.gov/guide/basics/ |title=Wind Energy Basics |publisher=[[Bureau of Land Management]] |access-date=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further inefficiencies, such as [[gearbox]] losses, generator and converter losses, reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine. To protect components from undue wear, extracted power is held constant above the rated operating speed as theoretical power [[Cube (algebra)|increases at the cube]] of wind speed, further reducing theoretical efficiency. In 2001, commercial utility-connected turbines deliver 75% to 80% of the Betz limit of power extractable from the wind, at rated operating speed.&lt;ref name=Enercon&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.enercon.de/p/downloads/EN_Productoverview_0710.pdf |title=Enercon E-family, 330 Kw to 7.5 MW, Wind Turbine Specification |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516022444/http://www.enercon.de/p/downloads/EN_Productoverview_0710.pdf |archive-date=16 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tony Burton et al., (ed), ''Wind Energy Handbook'', John Wiley and Sons 2001 {{ISBN|0471489972}} page 65&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=April 2016}}

Efficiency can decrease slightly over time, one of the main reasons being dust and insect carcasses on the blades which alters the aerodynamic profile and essentially reduces the [[Lift-to-drag ratio|lift to drag ratio]] of the [[airfoil]]. Analysis of 3128 wind turbines older than 10 years in Denmark showed that half of the turbines had no decrease, while the other half saw a production decrease of 1.2% per year.&lt;ref&gt;Sanne Wittrup.

Retrieved 2 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ice accretion on turbine blades has also been found to greatly reduce the efficiency of wind turbines, which is a common challenge in cold climates where [[Atmospheric icing|in-cloud icing and freezing rain]] events occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barber|first=S.|last2=Wang|first2=Y.|last3=Jafari|first3=S.|last4=Chokani|first4=N.|last5=Abhari|first5=R.

Large three-bladed horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWT), with the blades upwind of the tower produce the overwhelming majority of windpower in the world today. These turbines have the main [[rotor (turbine)|rotor]] shaft and [[electrical generator]] at the top of a tower, and must be pointed into the wind. Small turbines are pointed by a simple [[wind vane]], while large turbines generally use a wind sensor coupled with a yaw system. Most have a gearbox, which turns the slow rotation of the blades into a quicker rotation that is more suitable to drive an electrical generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.windpower.org/en/tour/wtrb/comp/index.htm |title=Wind Turbine Components |publisher=Danish Wind Industry Association |date=10 May 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607001802/http://www.windpower.org/en/tour/wtrb/comp/index.htm |archive-date=7 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some turbines use a different type of generator suited to slower rotational speed input. These don't need a gearbox, and are called direct-drive, meaning they couple the rotor directly to the generator with no gearbox in between. While [[Permanent magnet synchronous generator|permanent magnet]] [[Direct drive mechanism|direct-drive]] generators can be more costly due to the rare earth materials required, these [[Gearless Wind turbine|gearless]] turbines are sometimes preferred over gearbox generators because they "eliminate the gear-speed increaser, which is susceptible to significant accumulated fatigue torque loading, related reliability issues, and maintenance costs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author1=G.

Most horizontal axis turbines have their rotors upwind of its supporting tower. Downwind machines have been built, because they don't need an additional mechanism for keeping them in line with the wind. In high winds, the blades can also be allowed to bend which reduces their swept area and thus their wind resistance. Despite these advantages, upwind designs are preferred, because the change in loading from the wind as each blade passes behind the supporting tower can cause damage to the turbine.

Turbines used in [[wind farm]]s for commercial production of electric power are usually three-bladed. These have low [[torque ripple]], which contributes to good reliability. The blades are usually colored white for daytime visibility by aircraft and range in length from {{convert|20|to|80|m|ft|sp=us}}. The size and height of turbines increase year by year. Offshore wind turbines are built up to 8([[megawatt|MW]]) today and have a blade length up to {{convert|80|m|ft|sp=us}}. Usual tubular steel towers of multi megawatt turbines have a height of 70{{Spaces}}m to 120{{Spaces}}m and in extremes up to 160{{Spaces}}m.

=== Vertical axis ===
[[File:Twisted Savonius wind turbine in operation@60rpm.gif|thumb|left|upright|A vertical axis Twisted Savonius type turbine.]]
[[Vertical-axis wind turbine]]s (or VAWTs) have the main rotor shaft arranged vertically. One advantage of this arrangement is that the turbine does not need to be pointed into the wind to be effective, which is an advantage on a site where the wind direction is highly variable. It is also an advantage when the turbine is integrated into a building because it is inherently less steerable.  Also, the generator and gearbox can be placed near the ground, using a direct drive from the rotor assembly to the ground-based gearbox, improving accessibility for maintenance. However, these designs produce much less energy averaged over time, which is a major drawback.&lt;ref name="wind-works.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cleantechnica.com/2014/04/07/vertical-axis-wind-turbines-great-1890-also-rans-2014/ |website=CleanTechnica|title=Vertical Axis Wind Turbines: Great In 1890, Also-rans In 2014 |date=7 April 2014 |author=Michael Barnard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key disadvantages include the relatively low rotational speed with the consequential higher [[torque]] and hence higher cost of the drive train, the inherently lower [[Wind turbine aerodynamics|power coefficient]], the 360-degree rotation of the aerofoil within the wind flow during each cycle and hence the highly dynamic loading on the blade, the pulsating torque generated by some rotor designs on the drive train, and the difficulty of modelling the wind flow accurately and hence the challenges of analysing and designing the rotor prior to fabricating a prototype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awsopenwind.org/downloads/documentation/ModelingUncertaintyPublic.pdf |title=Wind Flow Modeling Uncertainty |date=May 2010 |publisher=AWS Truepower |author1=Michael C Brower |author2=Nicholas M Robinson |author3=Erik Hale |dead-url=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502230520/http://www.awsopenwind.org/downloads/documentation/ModelingUncertaintyPublic.pdf |archive-date=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a turbine is mounted on a rooftop the building generally redirects wind over the roof and this can double the wind speed at the turbine. If the height of a rooftop mounted turbine tower is approximately 50% of the building height it is near the optimum for maximum wind energy and minimum wind turbulence. While wind speeds within the built environment are generally much lower than at exposed rural sites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hugh Piggott |url=http://www.scoraigwind.com/citywinds |title=Windspeed in the city&amp;nbsp;– reality versus the DTI database |publisher=Scoraigwind.com |date=6 January 2007 |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Urban Wind Turbines |url=http://www.urbanwind.net/pdf/technological_analysis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; noise may be a concern and an existing structure may not adequately resist the additional stress.

Subtypes of the vertical axis design include:

====[[Darrieus wind turbine]]====
"Eggbeater" turbines, or Darrieus turbines, were named after the French inventor, Georges Darrieus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.symscape.com/blog/vertical_axis_wind_turbine |title=Vertical-Axis Wind Turbines |publisher=Symscape |date=7 July 2008 |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have good efficiency, but produce large [[torque ripple]] and cyclical stress on the tower, which contributes to poor reliability. They also generally require some external power source, or an additional Savonius rotor to start turning, because the starting torque is very low. The torque ripple is reduced by using three or more blades which results in greater solidity of the rotor. Solidity is measured by blade area divided by the rotor area. Newer Darrieus type turbines are not held up by [[guy-wire]]s but have an external superstructure connected to the top bearing.&lt;ref&gt;Exploit Nature-Renewable Energy Technologies by Gurmit Singh, Aditya Books, pp 378&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Giromill]]====
A subtype of Darrieus turbine with straight, as opposed to curved, blades. The cycloturbine variety has variable pitch to reduce the torque pulsation and is self-starting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awea.org/faq/vawt.html |title=What Are Vertical-Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs)? |author1=Eric Eggleston |last-author-amp=yes |author2=AWEA Staff |publisher=American Wind Energy Association |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403101826/http://www.awea.org/faq/vawt.html |archive-date=3 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantages of variable pitch are: high starting torque; a wide, relatively flat torque curve; a higher coefficient of performance; more efficient operation in turbulent winds; and a lower blade speed ratio which lowers blade bending stresses. Straight, V, or curved blades may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Marloff, R.H. |url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/Y703547454T51180.pdf |title=Stresses in turbine-blade tenons subjected to bending |journal=Experimental Mechanics |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=19–24 |date=January 1978 |doi=10.1007/BF02326553 |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Savonius wind turbine]]====
These are drag-type devices with two (or more) scoops that are used in anemometers, ''Flettner'' vents (commonly seen on bus and van roofs), and in some high-reliability low-efficiency power turbines. They are always self-starting if there are at least three scoops.

Twisted Savonius is a modified savonius, with long helical scoops to provide smooth torque. This is often used as a rooftop windturbine and has even been [[Hornblower Hybrid|adapted for ships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rob Varnon |url=http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Derecktor-converting-boat-into-hybrid-passenger-851170.php |title=Derecktor converting boat into hybrid passenger ferry |website=Connecticut Post |date=2 December 2010 |access-date=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parallel====
The parallel turbine is similar to the crossflow fan or centrifugal fan. It uses the [[ground effect (aircraft)|ground effect]]. Vertical axis turbines of this type have been tried for many years: a unit producing 10 [[Kilowatt|kW]] was built by Israeli wind pioneer Bruce Brill in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6481957.html |title=Modular wind energy device&amp;nbsp;– Brill, Bruce I |publisher=Freepatentsonline.com |date=19 November 2002 |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=October 2013}}

Wind turbines convert wind energy to electrical energy for distribution. Conventional horizontal axis turbines can be divided into three components:

* The rotor, which is approximately 20% of the wind turbine cost, includes the blades for converting wind energy to low speed rotational energy.
* The generator, which is approximately 34% of the wind turbine cost, includes the [[electrical generator]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=International Journal of Dynamics and Control |title=A Review on the Development of the Wind Turbine Generators across the World |author=Navid Goudarzi |date=June 2013 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=192–202 |doi=10.1007/s40435-013-0016-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=ASME 2012 International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition |title=A Review of the Development of Wind Turbine Generators Across the World |author1=Navid Goudarzi |author2=Weidong Zhu |date=November 2012 |volume=4 – Paper No: IMECE2012-88615 |pages=1257–1265 |url=http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1750788}}&lt;/ref&gt; the control electronics, and most likely a [[gear box]] (e.g. [[epicyclic gearing|planetary gear box]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hansentransmissions.com/en/hansen_w4.html |title=Hansen W4 series |publisher=Hansentransmissions.com |accessdate=6 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315160450/http://www.hansentransmissions.com/en/hansen_w4.html |archivedate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[adjustable-speed drive]] or [[continuously variable transmission]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://coen.boisestate.edu/windenergy/files/2011/10/Active-Drivetrain-Control-to-Improve-Energy-Capture-of-Wind-Turbines.pdf |title=Active Drivetrain Control to Improve Energy Capture of Wind Turbines |author1=John Gardner |author2=Nathaniel Haro |author3=Todd Haynes |lastauthoramp=yes |date=October 2011 |publisher=Boise State University |accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; component for converting the low-speed incoming rotation to high-speed rotation suitable for generating electricity.

=== Turbine monitoring and diagnostics ===
{{see also|Wind turbine prognostics}}
Due to data transmission problems, [[structural health monitoring]] of wind turbines is usually performed using several accelerometers and strain gages attached to the nacelle to monitor the gearbox and equipments. Currently, digital image correlation and stereophotogrammetry are used to measure dynamics of wind turbine blades. These methods usually measure displacement and strain to identify location of defects. Dynamic characteristics of non-rotating wind turbines have been measured using digital image correlation and photogrammetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888327015001478 | doi=10.1016/j.ymssp.2015.03.021 | volume=62–63 | title=Full-field dynamic strain prediction on a wind turbine using displacements of optical targets measured by stereophotogrammetry | year=2015 | journal=Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing | pages=284–295 | last1 = Baqersad | first1 = Javad | last2 = Niezrecki | first2 = Christopher | last3 = Avitabile | first3 = Peter| bibcode=2015MSSP...62..284B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three dimensional point tracking has also been used to measure rotating dynamics of wind turbines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-2419-2_26 Using Stereophotogrammetry to Measure Vibrations of a Rotating Wind Turbine]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Materials and recent developments ==
Materials that are typically used for the rotor blades in wind turbines are composites, as they tend to have a high stiffness, high strength, high fatigue resistance, and low weight.&lt;ref name="citeseerx.ist.psu.edu"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ancona|first1=Dan |last2=Jim|first2=McVeigh |title=Wind Turbine – Materials and Manufacturing Fact Sheet|citeseerx=10.1.1.464.5842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical resins used for these composites include polyester and epoxy, while glass and carbon fibers have been used for the reinforcing material.&lt;ref name=WS2010&gt;{{cite web |last1=Watson |first1=James |last2=Serrano |first2=Juan |title=Composite Materials for Wind Blades |url=http://www.windsystemsmag.com/article/detail/149/composite-materials-for-wind-blades |website=Wind Systems |date=September 2010 |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction may use manual layup techniques or composite resin injection molding. As the price of glass fibers is only about one tenth the price of carbon fiber, [[glass fiber]] is still dominant.

=== New designs ===
As competition in the wind market increases, companies are seeking ways to draw greater efficiency from their designs. One of the predominant ways wind turbines have gained performance is by increasing rotor diameters, and thus blade length. Retrofitting current turbines with larger blades mitigates the need and risks associated with a system-level redesign. As the size of the blade increases, its tendency to deflect also increases. Thus, from a materials perspective, the stiffness-to-weight is of major importance. As the blades need to function over a 100 million load cycles over a period of 20–25 years, the fatigue life of the blade materials is also of utmost importance. By incorporating carbon fiber into parts of existing blade systems, manufacturers may increase the length of the blades without increasing their overall weight. For instance, the spar cap, a structural element of a turbine blade, commonly experiences high tensile loading, making it an ideal candidate to utilize the enhanced tensile properties of carbon fiber in comparison to glass fiber.&lt;ref name=WS2010/&gt; Higher stiffness and lower density translates to thinner, lighter blades offering equivalent performance.  In a 10 ([[megawatt|MW]]) turbine—which will become more common in offshore systems by 2021—blades may reach over 100&amp;nbsp;m in length and weigh up to 50&amp;nbsp;metric tons when fabricated out of glass fiber. A switch to carbon fiber in the structural spar of the blade yields weight savings of 20 to 30 percent, or approximately 15 metric tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.compositesworld.com/articles/wind-turbine-blades-glass-vs-carbon-fiber |title=Wind turbine blades: Glass vs. carbon fiber |website=www.compositesworld.com |access-date=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Materials for blades ===
Some of the most common materials which are being used for turbine blades now and will be in the future are summarized below:

==== Glass and carbon fibers ====
The stiffness of composites is determined by the stiffness of fibers and their volume content. Typically, E-glass fibers are used as main reinforcement in the composites. Typically, the glass/epoxy composites for wind blades contain up to 75 weight % glass. This increases the stiffness, tensile and compression strength. A promising source of the composite materials in the future is glass fibers with modified compositions like S-glass, R-glass etc. Some other special glasses developed by Owens Corning are ECRGLAS, Advantex and most recently WindStrand glass fibers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://windpower.sandia.gov/other/AIAA-092449C.pdf |title=Materials and Innovations for Large Blade Structures: Research Opportunities in Wind Energy Technology|website=windpower.sandia.gov |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hybrid reinforcements ====
These include E-glass/carbon, E-glass/aramid and they present an exciting alternative to pure glass or carbon reinforcements. that the full replacement would lead to 80% weight savings, and cost increase by 150%, while a partial (30%) replacement would lead to only 90% cost increase and 50% weight reduction for 8 m turbine. The world currently longest wind turbine rotor blade, the 88.4 m long blade from LM Wind Power is made of carbon/glass hybrid composites. However, additional investigations are required for the optimal composition of the materials &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1419306/turbines-year-rotor-blades |title=Wind Power Monthly Webpage|website= |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nano-engineered polymers and composites ====
Additions of small amount (0.5 weight %) of nanoreinforcement (carbon nanotubes or nanoclay in the polymer matrix of composites, fiber sizing or interlaminar layers can allow to increase the fatigue resistance, shear or compressive strength as well as fracture toughness of the composites by 30–80%. Research has also shown that the incorporation of small amount of carbon nanotubes/CNT can increase the lifetime up to 1500%.

=== Costs ===
While the material cost is significantly higher for all-glass fiber blades than for hybrid glass/carbon fiber blades, there is a potential for tremendous savings in manufacturing costs when labor price is considered.  Utilizing carbon fiber enables for simpler designs that use less raw material.  The chief manufacturing process in blade fabrication is the layering of plies.  By reducing the number of layers of plies, as is enabled by thinner blade design, the cost of labor may be decreased, and in some cases, equate to the cost of labor for glass fiber blades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://energy.sandia.gov/wp-content/gallery/uploads/SAND2000-0478.pdf |title=The Use of Carbon Fibers in Wind Turbine Blade Design |last=Ong |last2=Tsai |first=Cheng-Huat |first2=Stephen W. |last-author-amp=yes |date=2000 |website=energy.sandia.gov |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other materials ===
Materials for wind turbine parts other than the rotor blades (including the rotor hub, gearbox, frame, and tower) are largely composed of steel. Modern turbines [[Copper in renewable energy#Wind|use a couple of tons of copper]] for generators, cables, and such.&lt;ref&gt;Frost and Sullivan, 2009, cited in Wind Generator Technology, by Eclareon S.L., Madrid, May 2012; www.eclareon.com; Available at Leonardo Energy – Ask an Expert; {{cite web |url=http://www.leonardo-energy.org/ask-expert |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126131037/http://www.leonardo-energy.org/ask-expert |archivedate=26 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller wind turbines have begun incorporating more aluminum based alloys into these components in an effort to make the turbines lighter and more efficient, and may continue to be used increasingly if fatigue and strength properties can be improved. Prestressed concrete has been increasingly used for the material of the tower, but still requires much reinforcing steel to meet the strength requirement of the turbine. Additionally, step-up gearboxes are being increasingly replaced with variable speed generators, increasing the demand for magnetic materials in wind turbines.&lt;ref name="citeseerx.ist.psu.edu" /&gt; In particular, this would require an increased supply of the rare earth metal [[neodymium]].

=== Recycling ===
Interest in recycling blades varies in different markets and depends on the waste legislation and local economics. A challenge in recycling blades is related to the composite material, which is made of a thermosetting matrix and glass fibers or a combination of glass and carbon fibers. Thermosetting matrix cannot be remolded to form new composites. So the options are either to reuse the blade and the composite material elements as they are found in the blade or to transform the composite material into a new source of material. 
In Germany, wind turbine blades are commercially recycled as part of an alternative fuel mix for a cement factory.

=== Supply ===
A study of the material consumption trends and requirements for wind energy in Europe found that bigger turbines have a higher consumption of precious metals but lower material input per [[Kilowatt|kW]] generated. The current material consumption and stock was compared to input materials for various onshore system sizes. In all EU countries the estimates for 2020 exceeded and doubled the values consumed in 2009. These countries would need to expand their resources to be able to meet the estimated demand for 2020. For example, currently the EU has 3% of world supply of fluorspar and it requires 14% by 2020. Globally, the main exporting countries are South Africa, Mexico and China.  This is similar with other critical and valuable materials required for energy systems such as magnesium, silver and indium. In addition, the levels of recycling of these materials is very low and focusing on that could alleviate issues with supply in the future. It is important to note that since most of these valuable materials are also used  in other emerging technologies, like [[Light emitting diode|LED]]s, [[Photo voltaics|PV]]s and [[Liquid Crystal Display|LCD]]s, it is projected that demand for them will continue to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-02-01|title=Critical and precious materials consumption and requirement in wind energy system in the EU 27|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261914011519|journal=Applied Energy|language=en|volume=139|pages=327–334|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.11.003|issn=0306-2619 | last1 = Kim | first1 = Junbeum | last2 = Guillaume | first2 = Bertrand | last3 = Chung | first3 = Jinwook | last4 = Hwang | first4 = Yongwoo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by the United States Geological Survey estimated the projected materials requirement in order to fulfill the US commitment to supplying 20% of its electricity from wind power by 2030. They did not address requirements for small turbines or offshore turbines since those were not widely deployed in 2008, when the study was created. They found that there are increases in common materials such as cast iron, steel and concrete that represent 2–3% of the material consumption in 2008. Between 110,000 and 115,000 metric tons of fiber glass would be required annually, equivalent to 14% of consumption in 2008. They did not see a high increase in demand for rare metals compared to available supply, however rare metals that are also being used for other technologies such as batteries which are increasing its global demand need to be taken into account. Land, whbich might not be considered a material, is an important resource in deploying wind technologies. Reaching the 2030 goal would require 50,000 square kilometers of onshore land area and 11,000 square kilometers of offshore. This is not considered a problem in the US due to its vast area and the ability to use land for farming and grazing. A greater limitation for the technology would be the variability and transmission infrastructure to areas of higher demand.&lt;ref&gt;Wilburn, D.R.—Wind Energy in the United States and Materials Required for the Land-Based Turbine Industry From 2010 Through 2030—SIR 2011–5036&lt;/ref&gt;

Permanent magnets for wind turbine generators contain rare earth metals such as [[Neodymium|Nd]], [[Praseodymium|Pr]], [[Terbium|Tb]], and [[Dysprosium|Dy]]. Systems that use magnetic direct drive turbines require higher amounts of rare metals. Therefore, an increase in wind production would increase the demand for these resources. It is estimated that the additional demand for Nd in 2035 may be 4,000 to 18,000 tons and  Dy could see an increase of  200 to 1200 tons. These values represent a quarter to half of current production levels. However, since technologies are developing rapidly, driven by supply and price of materials these estimated levels are extremely uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buchholz|first=Peter|last2=Brandenburg|first2=Torsten|date=2018-01-01|title=Demand, Supply, and Price Trends for Mineral Raw Materials Relevant to the Renewable Energy Transition Wind Energy, Solar Photovoltaic Energy, and Energy Storage|journal=Chemie Ingenieur Technik|language=en|volume=90|issue=1–2|pages=141–153|doi=10.1002/cite.201700098|issn=1522-2640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reliance on rare earth minerals for components has risked expense and price volatility as China has been main producer of rare earth minerals (96% in 2009) and had been reducing its export quotas of these materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2011/5036/sir2011-5036.pdf|title=Wind Energy in the United States and Materials Required for the Land-Based Wind Turbine Industry From 2010 Through 2030|last1=Wilburn|first1=David|publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, however, other producers have increased production of [[Rare-earth mineral|rare earth minerals]] and China has removed its reduced export quota on rare earths leading to an increased supply and decreased cost of rare earth minerals, increasing the viability of the implementation of variable speed generators in wind turbines on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-ends-rare-earth-minerals-export-quotas-1420441285|title=China Ends Rare-Earth Minerals Export Quotas|last1=Yap|first1=Chui-Wei|website=wsg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to increased technology and wide implementation, the global glass fiber market might reach US$17.4 billion by 2024, compared to US$8.5 billion in 2014. Since it is the most widely used material for reinforcement in composites around the globe, the expansion of end use applications such as construction, transportation and wind turbines has fueled its popularity. Asia Pacific held the major share of the global market in 2014 with more than 45% volume share. However China is currently the largest producer. The industry receives subsidies from the Chinese government allowing them to export it cheaper to the US and Europe. However, due to the higher demand in the near future some price wars have started to developed to implement anti dumping strategies such as tariffs on Chinese glass fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-07-01|title=Glass fiber market to reach to US$17 billion by 2024|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034361716301849|journal=Reinforced Plastics|language=en|volume=60|issue=4|pages=188–189|doi=10.1016/j.repl.2016.07.006|issn=0034-3617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few localities have exploited the attention-getting nature of wind turbines by placing them on public display, either with visitor centers around their bases, or with viewing areas farther away.&lt;ref name="wind_farm_tourism"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/business/story.html?id=63a5438a-ae99-4b76-9629-b7b59d238932 |title=Canada wind farms blow away turbine tourists |website=[[Edmonton Journal]] |accessdate=6 September 2008 |last=Young |date=3 August 2007 |first=Kathryn |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425064111/http://www2.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/business/story.html?id=63a5438a-ae99-4b76-9629-b7b59d238932 |archivedate=25 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The wind turbines are generally of conventional horizontal-axis, three-bladed design, and generate power to feed electrical grids, but they also serve the unconventional roles of technology demonstration, public relations, and education.

== Small wind turbines ==
{{Main|Small wind turbine}}
[[File:Quietrevolution Bristol 3513051949.jpg|thumb|upright|A small [[Quietrevolution wind turbine|Quietrevolution QR5]] [[Gorlov helical turbine|Gorlov type]] vertical axis wind turbine in Bristol, England. Measuring 3&amp;nbsp;m in diameter and 5&amp;nbsp;m high, it has a nameplate rating of 6.5&amp;nbsp;kW to the grid.]]

Small wind turbines may be used for a variety of applications including on- or off-grid residences, telecom towers, offshore platforms, rural schools and clinics, remote monitoring and other purposes that require energy where there is no electric grid, or where the grid is unstable. Small wind turbines may be as small as a fifty-watt generator for boat or [[Travel trailer|caravan]] use. Hybrid solar and wind powered units are increasingly being used for traffic signage, particularly in rural locations, as they avoid the need to lay long cables from the nearest mains connection point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solar-wind.co.uk/solar_powered_sign_lights.html |title=Solar &amp; Wind Powered Sign Lighting |last=Anon |publisher=Energy Development Cooperative Ltd |accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory|U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL) defines small wind turbines as those smaller than or equal to 100 kilowatts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/wind/smallwind/ Small Wind], U.S. Department of Energy National Renewable Energy Laboratory website&lt;/ref&gt; Small units often have direct drive generators, [[direct current]] output, aeroelastic blades, lifetime bearings and use a vane to point into the wind.

Larger, more costly turbines generally have geared power trains, alternating current output, flaps and are actively pointed into the wind. Direct drive generators and aeroelastic blades for large wind turbines are being researched.

== Wind turbine spacing ==
On most horizontal wind turbine farms, a spacing of about 6–10 times the rotor diameter is often upheld. However, for large wind farms distances of about 15 rotor diameters should be more economical, taking into account typical wind turbine and land costs. This conclusion has been reached by research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/we.469 |volume=15 |issue=2 |title=Optimal turbine spacing in fully developed wind farm boundary layers |year=2011 |journal=Wind Energy |pages=305–317 |last1=Meyers |first1=Johan| bibcode=2012WiEn...15..305M }}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by [[Charles Meneveau]] of the Johns Hopkins University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New study yields better turbine spacing for large wind farms |url=http://gazette.jhu.edu/2011/01/18/new-study-yields-better-turbine-spacing-for-large-wind-farms/ |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |date=18 January 2011 |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Johan Meyers of Leuven University in Belgium, based on computer simulations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M.

Recent research by John Dabiri of Caltech suggests that vertical wind turbines may be placed much more closely together so long as an alternating pattern of rotation is created allowing blades of neighbouring turbines to move in the same direction as they approach one another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jrse/3/4/10.1063/1.3608170 Dabiri, J.

== Operability ==

=== Maintenance ===
Wind turbines need regular [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] to stay [[Reliability engineering|reliable]] and [[Availability factor|available]], in the best case turbines are available to generate energy 98% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;G.J.W. van Bussel, PhD; M.B.

Modern turbines usually have a small onboard [[Crane (machine)|crane]] for hoisting maintenance tools and minor components. However, large heavy components like generator, gearbox, blades and so on are rarely replaced and a [[Mobile crane|heavy lift external crane]] is needed in those cases. If the turbine has a difficult access road, a [[Liftra|containerized crane]] can be lifted up by the internal crane to provide heavier lifting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ing.dk/artikel/dansk-firma-saetter-prisbelonnet-selvhejsende-kran-i-serieproduktion-184423 |title=Dansk firma sætter prisbelønnet selvhejsende kran i serieproduktion |author=Morten Lund |website=[[Ingeniøren]] |date=30 May 2016 |accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Repowering ===
{{main|Repowering}}
Installation of new wind turbines can be controversial. An alternative is repowering, where existing wind turbines are replaced with bigger, more powerful ones, sometimes in smaller numbers while keeping or increasing capacity.

=== Demolition ===
Older turbines were in some early cases not required to be removed when reaching the end of their life. Some still stand, waiting to be [[recycling|recycled]] or repowered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/abandoned-dreams-of-wind-and-light |title=Abandoned Dreams of Wind and Light |author=Jeremy Fugleberg |date=8 May 2014 |website=Atlas Obscura |accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aweablog.org/fact-check-about-those-abandoned-turbines/ |title=Fact check: About those 'abandoned' turbines … |author=Tom Gray |publisher=[[American Wind Energy Association]] |date=11 March 2013 |accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[demolition]] industry develops to recycle offshore turbines at a cost of DKK 2–4 million per ([[megawatt|MW]]), to be guaranteed by the owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ing.dk/artikel/aldrende-havmolleparker-abner-marked-klog-nedrivning-182308 |title=Aldrende havmølleparker åbner marked for klog nedrivning |website=Ingeniøren |accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with fossil-fuel turbines ==
=== Advantages ===
Wind turbines are generally inexpensive.  They will produce electricity at  between two and six cents per kilowatt hour, which is one of the lowest-priced renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.clean-energy-ideas.com/wind/wind-energy/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-wind-energy|title=Advantages and Disadvantages of Wind Energy – Clean Energy Ideas|date=2013-06-19|work=Clean Energy Ideas|access-date=2017-05-10|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; And as technology needed for wind turbines continues to improve, the prices will decrease as well. In addition, there is no competitive market for wind energy, as it does not cost money to get ahold of wind.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The main cost of wind turbines are the installation process. The average cost is between $48,000 and $65,000 to install. However, the energy harvested from the turbine will offset the installation cost, as well as provide virtually free energy for years after.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bergey.com/wind-school/residential-wind-energy-systems|title=Residential Wind Energy Systems – Bergey Wind PowerBergey Wind Power|website=bergey.com|language=English|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind turbines provide a clean energy source, emitting no greenhouse gases and no waste product.  Over 1,500 tons of carbon dioxide per year can be eliminated by using a one megawatt turbine instead of one megawatt of energy from a fossil fuel.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pawindenergynow.org/wind/facts.html|title=About Wind Energy: Factsheets and Statistics|website=www.pawindenergynow.org|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being environmentally friendly and green is a large advantage of wind turbines.

=== Disadvantages ===
Wind turbines can be very large, reaching over {{convert|140|m|ft}} tall and with blades {{convert|55|m|yd}} long,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://windmonitor.iwes.fraunhofer.de/windmonitor_en/3_Onshore/2_technik/4_anlagengroesse |title=Turbine Size |website=Fraunhofer Wind Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; and people have often complained about their visual impact.

[[Environmental impact of wind power]] includes effect on wildlife, but can be mitigated if proper monitoring and mitigation strategies are implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parisé | first1 = J. | last2 = Walker | first2 = T. R. | year = 2017 | title = Industrial wind turbine post-construction bird and bat monitoring: A policy framework for Canada | url = | journal = Journal of Environmental Management | volume = 201 | issue = | pages = 252–259 | doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.06.052| pmid = 28672197 | bibcode = 2013JEnvM.127..300K }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thousands of birds, including rare species, have been killed by the blades of wind turbines,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hosansky|first=David|date=April 1, 2011|title=Wind Power: Is wind energy good for the environment?|url=|journal=CQ Researcher|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though wind turbines contribute relatively insignificantly to anthropogenic avian mortality. For every bird killed by a wind turbine in the US, nearly 500,000 are killed by each of feral cats and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sovacool | first1 = B. K. | year = 2013 | title = The avian benefits of wind energy: A 2009 update | url = | journal = Renewable Energy | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 19–24 | doi=10.1016/j.renene.2012.01.074}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, conventional coal fired generators contribute significantly more to bird mortality, by incineration when caught in updrafts of smoke stacks and by poisoning with emissions byproducts (including particulates and heavy metals downwind of flue gases). Further, marine life is affected by water intakes of steam turbine cooling towers (heat exchangers) for nuclear and fossil fuel generators, by coal dust deposits in marine ecosystems (e.g. damaging Australia's Great Barrier Reef) and by water acidification from combustion monoxides.

Energy harnessed by wind turbines is intermittent, and is not a "dispatchable" source of power; its availability is based on whether the wind is blowing, not whether electricity is needed. Turbines can be placed on ridges or bluffs to maximize the access of wind they have, but this also limits the locations where they can be placed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this way, wind energy is not a particularly reliable source of energy. However, it can form part of the [[energy mix]], which also includes power from other sources. Notably, the relative available output from wind and solar sources is often inversely proportional (balancing){{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Technology is also being developed to store excess energy, which can then make up for any deficits in supplies.
