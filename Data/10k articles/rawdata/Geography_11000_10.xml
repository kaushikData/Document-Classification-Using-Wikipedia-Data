'''350.org''' is an international [[environmental organization]] addressing [[climate change]] with the goal of reducing atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]]   to 350[[Parts per million|ppm]] from the current level of 400 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/ |title=The Keeling Curve |publisher=Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego  |date=29 April 2015 |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thompson ([[Climate Central]]) |first=Andrea |date=May 19, 2016 |title=Atmospheric CO2 May Have Topped 400 PPM Permanently |url=https://insideclimatenews.org/news/18052016/atmospheric-co2-carbon-dioxide-400-ppm-climate-change-keeling-curve |newspaper=[[InsideClimate News]] |location= |access-date=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by author [[Bill McKibben]] with the goal of building a global [[grassroots]] movement to raise awareness about [[human impact on the environment|human-driven]] climate change, to confront [[climate change denial]], and to cut emissions of [[carbon dioxide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plass |first=Gilbert N. |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=carbon-dioxide-and-climate |title=''Carbon Dioxide and Climate'' |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |date= |accessdate=November 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.350.org/story |title=Our Team's History|publisher=www.350.org |accessdate=October 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to slow the rate of [[global warming]]. 350.org takes its name from the research of [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]] scientist [[James E. Hansen]], who posited in a 2007 paper that 350 [[Parts per million|ppm]] of [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere]] is a safe upper limit to avoid a climate [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]].&lt;ref&gt;“[http://unfccc.int/files/press/backgrounders/application/pdf/press_factsh_mitigation.pdf Fact sheet: The need for mitigation.]" ''[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]]''.

==Origins==
[[Image:Bill McKibben at RIT-3.jpg|thumb|The founder of 350.org, Bill McKibben, speaking at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] in 2008.]]

350.org was founded by author Bill McKibben&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/daily/movies/2009/09/no_impact_man_and_the_idiotocr.html |title=No Impact Man and the Idiotocracy – The Projectionist |publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=September 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a group of students from Middlebury College. McKibben is an American environmentalist and writer who wrote one of the first books on global warming for the general public, and frequently writes about climate change, [[alternative energy]], and the need for more [[Local economies|localized economies]].

&lt;!-- This [[Template:Anchor|Anchor]] is being used, please don't remove --&gt;{{anchor|350safe}}The organizing effort drew its name from [[NASA]] climate scientist James Hansen's contention that any atmospheric concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; above 350 parts per million was unsafe. James Hansen opined that "if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on [[Earth]] is [[adapted]], paleoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at most 350 ppm, but likely less than that."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Hansen|Hansen, J.]], et al. "[http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abstracts/2008/Hansen_etal.html Target atmospheric CO2: Where should humanity aim?]" ''Open Atmospheric Science Journal'', 2, 217–231, 2008. ''(Retrieved i2009-09-01.)''&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon dioxide, the main [[greenhouse gas]], rose by 2.6 parts per million to 396 ppm in 2013 from the previous year (annual global averages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/|title=ESRL Global Monitoring Division - Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, Earth System Research|last=Laboratory|website=www.esrl.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; It already crossed 400 ppm in May 2012 on monitors in the industrialized [[Northern Hemisphere]]'s [[Arctic]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/weather/climate/globalwarming/story/2012-05-31/carbon-dioxide-greehouse-gas-level-climate-change-global-warming/55312242/1 Scientists: Carbon dioxode at highest level in 800,000 years] May 31, 2012 (Seth Borenstein, Associated Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

McKibben first started to organize against climate change with a walk across [[Vermont]], his home state. His "[[Step It Up 2007|Step It Up]]" campaign in 2007 involved 1,400 demonstrations at famous sites across the United States. McKibben credits these activities with making [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] change their [[Energy policy of the United States|energy policies]] during the presidential campaign. Starting in 2008, 350.org built upon the "Step It Up" campaign and made it into a global organization.

[[Rajendra Pachauri]], the UN's "top climate scientist" and leader of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) has come out, [[Climate change mitigation scenarios#350 ppm|as have others]], in favor of reducing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide to 350 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/aug/26/pachauri-350ppm-breakthrough-climate |title=Pachauri's call for 350ppm is breakthrough moment for climate movement |publisher=guardian.co.uk |accessdate=September 15, 2009 | location=London | date=August 26, 2009 |first=Bill |last=McKibben}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/environmentalcapital/2009/08/25/climate-debate-ipcc-head-pachauri-joins-the-350-club/ |title=Climate Debate: IPCC Head Pachauri Joins the 350 Club |publisher=blogs.[[wsj.com]] |accessdate=September 15, 2009 |first=Keith |last=Johnson |date=August 25, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029113927/https://blogs.wsj.com/environmentalcapital/2009/08/25/climate-debate-ipcc-head-pachauri-joins-the-350-club/ |archivedate=October 29, 2009 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hacayDuUcngLmhNkplHB5VtG5GNw |title=AFP: Top UN climate scientist backs ambitious CO2 cuts |publisher=www.google.com | work=[[Agence France-Presse]] |accessdate=September 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McKibben called news of Pachauri's embrace of the 350ppm target "amazing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2009/08/pachauri_endorses_350ppm_co2_t.html |title=The Great Beyond: Pachauri endorses 350ppm CO2 target |publisher=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |accessdate=September 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some media have indicated that Pachauri's endorsement of the 350 ppm target was a victory for 350.org's activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailygreen.com/environmental-news/latest/350-global-warming-47082505 |title=UN Scientist Rajendra Pachauri - Colbert Bump for 350.org - thedailygreen.com |publisher=thedailygreen.com |accessdate=September 17, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005180325/http://www.thedailygreen.com/environmental-news/latest/350-global-warming-47082505 |archivedate=October 5, 2009 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.triplepundit.com/2009/08/un-scientist-claims-350-ppm-is-new-magic-number/ |title=UN Scientist Claims 350 PPM Is New Magic Number &amp;#124; Triple Pundit |publisher=www.triplepundit.com |accessdate=September 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the organization was presented with the 2012 [[Katerva]] Award for [[Behavioural change theories|Behavioural Change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Finalists|url=http://katerva.org|accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
The 350.org movement considers the atmospheric concentration 350ppm of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a safe upper limit. This limit was the focus a 2009 [[COP15]] international treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.cop15.dk/ |title=Home – COP15 United Nations Climate Change Conference Copenhagen 2009 |publisher=[[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] |accessdate=September 15, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918051433/http://en.cop15.dk/ |archivedate=September 18, 2009 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 350.org's goal is to have governments adopt policies to lower carbon dioxide emissions. In spite of this goal, "[i]n 2013, CO2 levels surpassed 400 ppm for the first time in recorded history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Graphic: The relentless rise of carbon dioxide |url=https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/24/ |website=NASA.gov |accessdate = 2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 350.org reports: "This March [2015], global levels of CO2 passed 400 parts per million."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 400 ppm CO2: What It Means|url = http://400.350.org/|website = 400 ppm CO2: What It Means|accessdate = 2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

350.org aims to build a global, grassroots movement to take on the [[fossil fuel]] industry and solve the climate crisis. Through online campaigns, grassroots organizing, and mass public actions, 350.org has mobilized thousands of volunteer organizers in over 188 countries. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Climate safety and climate justice for people across the globe is a critical part of 350.org's mission. By working with local community groups, 350.org aims to hold corporations and world leaders accountable to the realities of science and the principles of social justice.

==Science of 350==
350 parts per million is what scientists{{who|date=August 2018}}, climate experts{{who|date=August 2018}}, and progressive national governments{{who|date=August 2018}} are now saying is the safe upper limit for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in our atmosphere. In May 2013, two independent teams of scientists measuring CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; near the summit of [[Mauna Loa]] in Hawaii recorded that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million, probably for the first time in more than 3 million years of Earth history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2013/05/130510-earth-co2-milestone-400-ppm/|title=Climate Milestone: Earth’s CO2 Level Passes 400 ppm|date=May 12, 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere is continuing to rise at about 2 ppm every year.

{{convert|2|C-change|F-change|1}} was agreed upon during the 2009 [[Copenhagen Accord]] as a limit for global temperature rise. The accord formally recognized "the scientific view that the increase in global temperature should be below two degrees Celsius."&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/cop15/eng/11a01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The next paragraph declared that "we agree that deep cuts in global emissions are required... so as to hold the increase in global temperature below two degrees Celsius." In order to stay below a 2 degree increase, scientists have estimated that humans can pour roughly 565 more gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. At present emission rates, (31 gigatons globally in 2011 and rising) 565 gigatons will be reached by 2028.&lt;ref name="rollingstone.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/global-warmings-terrifying-new-math-20120719|title=Global Warming's Terrifying New Math|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fossil-fuel companies currently have about 2,795 gigatons of carbon already contained in their proven coal and oil and gas reserves, and is the amount of fossil fuels they are currently planning to burn. 2,795 gigatons is five times higher than the limit of 565 gigatons that would keep Earth under a global temperature increase of 2 degrees Celsius.&lt;ref name="rollingstone.com"/&gt;

==Campaigns and projects==

===Keystone XL pipeline===
350.org has named the [[Keystone XL pipeline]] as a critical issue and turning point for the environmental movement, as well as for President Obama's legacy. NASA climatologist James Hansen labeled the Keystone XL pipeline as "game over" for the planet, and called the amount of carbon stored in Canadian bitumen sands a "fuse to the largest carbon bomb on the planet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/29/idUS257590805720110829 | work=Reuters | title=NASA's Hansen Explains Decision to Join Keystone Pipeline Protests | date=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

350.org cites oil spills along the proposed pipeline route, which would pass near Texas' Carrizo-Wilcox Aquifer, which supplies drinking water to more than 12 million people. It could also pose danger to the Ogallala Aquifer, the largest aquifer in western North America that supplies drinking water and irrigation to millions of people and agricultural businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insideclimatenews.org/news/20120426/keystone-xl-nebraska-sandhills-ogallala+aquifer-heineman-transcanada|title=News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 350.org has opposed the economic argument that has been made by proponents of the pipeline, arguing that Keystone XL would create only a few thousand temporary jobs during construction. The State Department estimated that ultimately the pipeline will create 35 permanent jobs.&lt;ref&gt;http://keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/documents/organization/205612.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to oil industry claims, the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) has said that the Keystone XL pipeline will increase gas prices instead of lowering them. The NRDC's study also refutes the claim that the pipeline will lead to energy independence, because the pipeline will carry tar sands from Canada to Texas which will then be sold on the global market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nrdc.org/energy/keystone-pipeline/files/Keystone-Oil-Prices-Report.pdf |title=Link }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly due to efforts from 350.org and other organizations, President Obama officially rejected the building of Keystone XL on November 6, 2015.&lt;ref name="Davenport"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Citing Climate Change, Obama Rejects Construction of Keystone XL Oil Pipeline|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/07/us/obama-expected-to-reject-construction-of-keystone-xl-oil-pipeline.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-11-06|access-date = 2015-11-07|issn = 0362-4331|first = Coral|last = Davenport}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the end of a seven-year review on the pipeline. Speaking on the decision, Bill McKibben said, “President Obama is the first world leader to reject a project because of its effect on the climate. That gives him new stature as an environmental leader, and it eloquently confirms the five years and millions of hours of work that people of every kind put into this fight.”&lt;ref name="Davenport"/&gt;

===Fossil fuel divestment===
{{Main|Fossil fuel divestment}}
{{See also|Fossil fuel phase-out}}

350.org launched their "Go Fossil Free: Divest from Fossil Fuels!" campaign in 2012 with Bill McKibben's "Do The Math" speaking tour around the country. The campaign calls for colleges and universities, as well as cities, religious institutions, and pension funds to withdraw their investments from fossil fuel companies. 350.org explains that the reasoning behind this campaign is simple: "If it is wrong to wreck the climate, then it is wrong to profit from that wreckage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gofossilfree.org/about/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114164835/http://gofossilfree.org/about/ |archivedate=November 14, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 350.org states their demand as the following "We want institutions to immediately freeze any new investment in fossil fuel companies, and divest from direct ownership and any commingled funds that include fossil fuel public equities and corporate bonds within 5 years."

There are currently fossil fuel divestment campaigns at 308 colleges and universities, 105 cities and states, and 6 religious institutions.

===''Do The Math'' movie===
The ''Do The Math'' movie is a 42-minute documentary film about the rising movement to change the terrifying math of the climate crisis and challenge the fossil fuel industry. The math revolves around these three numbers:  to stay below 2 degrees Celsius of global warming we can emit only 565 more gigatons of carbon dioxide versus the 2,795 gigatons held in proven reserves by fossil fuel corporations.  This warming rise was agreed to in the 2009 [[Copenhagen Summit]] as a limit.  NASA scientist [[James Hansen]] says "2 degrees of warming is actually a prescription for long-term disaster."&lt;ref&gt;Bill McKibben (2013). "Oil and Honey". Henry Holt and Company. p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global Power Shift ===
Phase 1 of Global Power Shift was a convergence in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] in June 2013 of about five-hundred climate organizers from 135 countries. Stated objectives include sharing and developing skills to organize movements, building upon existing plans to organize in-country Power Shift events after the kickoff event in Turkey, building political alignment and a clear [[theory of change]], sharing experiences from different countries, formulating strategies to overcome challenges, and building relationships to strengthen regional and international cooperation and collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalpowershift.org/|title=Global Power Shift|website=globalpowershift.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase 2 of Global Power Shift involves the organizers who were in Turkey in June 2013 to bring home what they learned to organize summits, events, and mobilizations.

===Summer Heat===
350.org launched the Summer Heat campaign in the Summer of 2013, and was a wave of mass mobilizations across the country. Summer Heat actions took place at eleven locations: Richmond, CA; Vancouver, WA; Green River, UT; Albuquerque, NM; Houston, TX; [[St. Ignace, Michigan|St. Ignace, MI]]; Warren, OH; Washington, D.C.; Camp David, MD; Somerset, MA; and Sebago Lake, ME. Participants included grassroots organizers, labor unions, farmers, ranchers, environmental justice groups, and others. The slogan that was used for the Summer Heat campaign was: ''As The Temperature Rises, So Do We.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joinsummerheat.org/|title=Summer Heat|website=joinsummerheat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christoph Daniel Ebeling''' (20 November 1741 near [[Hildesheim]], [[Hanover]] – 30 June 1817 in [[Hamburg]]) was a scholar of Germany who studied the geography and history of North America.

==Biography==
Ebeling studied theology at [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], but devoted himself to geographical studies, and for 33 years taught history and Greek in the Hamburg [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. He was also superintendent of the Hamburg library, and collected about 10,000 maps and nearly 4,000 books relating to America. Ebeling's [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] was a ''Geography and History of North America'' (5 vols., Hamburg, 1796–1816), forming a continuation of [[Büsching]]'s ''General Geography''. He received a vote of thanks from the [[United States Congress]] for this work.{{sfn|Wilson &amp; Fiske|1900}}

He was noted for his extensive knowledge of oriental languages, of classic and foreign literature, and of history and geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Ebeling, Christoph Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebeling's collection was purchased by [[Israel Thorndike]] in the year after Ebeling's death, and given by him to [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. As a result, Harvard's library collections grew massively, virtually overnight. Through Thorndike, Ebeling's maps became the founding gift that created the Harvard Map Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.harvard.edu/map|title="About" {{!}} Harvard Map Collection {{!}} Harvard Library|last=|first=|date=|website=library.harvard.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ebeling was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberliste American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edgar Aubert de la Rüe''' (1901–1991) was a [[France|French]] [[geographer]], [[geologist]], traveller and photographer who was primarily devoted to the islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], [[Kerguelen Islands|Kerguelen]], and [[Vanuatu]]. [[Mount Aubert de la Rue]] on [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands|Heard Island]] is named after him.

==Biography&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academieoutremer.fr/academiciens/fiche.php?aId=572 Academy of Sciences of Outre Mer] {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
Edgar Aubert de la Rüe was born on 7 October 1901 in [[Geneva]] (Switzerland) and died on 24 February 1991 in [[Lausanne]].

He took on the duties of an engineer-geologist from the [[Nancy-Université|University of Nancy]] and a scientific adviser for the [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]]. He was also a Doctor of [[Natural Science]] from the [[University of Paris]].

He dedicated himself to the islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] (1932, 1935, 1937, 1941 to 1943, 1948, and 1970), [[Kerguelen Islands|Kerguelen]] (1928, 1929, 1931, and from 1949 to 1953), and [[Vanuatu]], and from November 1937 to May 1938 he stayed in [[French Somaliland]].

As an Associate of the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|National Museum of Natural History]] in Paris, his geological activities led him to difficult surveys all around the French Union: [[French protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Republic of the Congo|Middle Congo]], [[French Madagascar|Madagascar]], [[Réunion]], [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Syria - Lebanon]], and [[French Polynesia]].

Edgar Aubert de la Rüe was elected as a corresponding member of the ''Académie des sciences d’outre-mer'' on 7 December 1951.

He was Professor of higher studies of Latin America from 1965 to 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.bnf.fr/servlet/autorite?ID=12117281&amp;idNoeud=1.3&amp;host=catalogue BnF catalogue] {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Summary of his Travels
*[[Kerguelen Islands|Kerguelen Archipelago]]: 12 November 1928 to 25 February 1929, 25 January to 27 March 1931, 11 December 1949 to 16 January 1950, 12 December 1951 to 6 January 1953;
*[[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]: 7 journeys (1932, 1935, 1937, 1939, 1941 to 1943, 1948, 1970) totalling three years;
*[[French Somaliland]]: November 1937 to May 1938, accompanied by his wife.
*Numerous other journeys - always with his wife - notably [[Patagonia]], [[Brazil]], and Vanuatu.

==Kerguelen Islands&lt;ref name=Kerguelen&gt;[http://www.kerguelen-voyages.com/c/95/p/d380801a66d0628dde0328650b93c643/iles-kerguelen-edgar-aubert-de-la-rue.html Kerguelen Voyages] {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
Edgar Aubert de la rue made six journeys to the [[Kerguelen Islands]] ranging from six weeks to over a year. He spent in total more than two years in the islands - mostly with his wife Andrée. He made a significant contribution to the geology and biology of the area including two maps published in 1932 and 1952.

His first visit was from 12 November 1928 to 25 February 1929 when he stayed at Port-Couvreux and Port-Jeanne d’Arc and explored the coasts and the islands aboard whaling vessels. From 24 January to the end of March 1931, he was commissioned to undertake a geological expedition for the Ministry of Colonies. From these two journeys came, in 1932, a thesis which was a sum of his unique knowledge of the Kerguelens at that time. Edgar Aubert de la Rüe returned to the Kerguelens from 11 December 1949 to 16 January 1950 and again from 12 December 1951 to January 1953 as a geologist and scientific adviser. He assisted in the first years of creation of the current database.

The many place names that he assigned during his expedition scan be classified into different categories:
- Descriptive names for the majority of his place names.
- Names of professors and colleagues - e.g. Gandillot, Léon, Lu-taud, Jérémine...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6316">[[Micronation]]s are ephemeral, self-proclaimed entities that claim to be independent sovereign states, but which are not acknowledged as such by any recognised sovereign state, or by any supranational organisation.

This article documents the designated [[national flag]]s of micronations whose existence is verifiable in multiple, non-trivial third party reference sources, which have been cited in the linked Wikipedia articles for those entities.

In 2003 the institute received part of a $4.2 million [[National Science Foundation]] grant for a study of pollution in the [[Hudson River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Researchers to track Hudson River pollution into Atlantic |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/science/2003-05-12-hudson-pollute_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |date=2003-12-05 |accessdate=2008-03-07 | first1=Todd B. | last1=Bates | first2=Asbury | last2=Park}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Fall of 2006, FERI spun off a for profit project focused on the development of an online mapping portal called [[WeoGeo]].

'''[[Geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS)''' are becoming an increasingly important component of business, healthcare, security, government, trade, media, transportation and tourism industries and operations in '''[[China]]''' and [[geographic information system|GIS software]] are playing an increasing role in the way [[list of companies of China|Chinese companies]] analyze and manage [[business operations]].

==History==
When GIS first became widely available in the 1980s and 1990s, the only source of geographic data for China was paper maps. Several universities elected to undertake the huge task of [[digitization|digitizing]] this information so that other researchers could use it.

The two earliest projects were conducted by The Australian Consortium for the Asian Spatial Information and Analysis Network ([http://www.asian.gu.edu.au ACASIAN]) at [[Griffith University]] and the [http://chinadatacenter.org China Data Center] at the [[University of Michigan at Ann Arbor]]. ACASIAN specialized solely in spatial coverages while the China Data Center included GIS coverages as a supplemented to their primary mission of providing Chinese statistical and census data.

There is a great deal of high quality GIS data being produced in China by both government organizations and private companies. Today, China's National Spatial Data Infrastructure Project, uses the [[WGS84]] standard.

In 1991, China's first color Map Editing and Publication System, MapCAD.

In 1995, China's first National Advanced GIS Software, Computer based GIS, [[MapGIS]].

In 2005, The fourth generation of large scale distributed structure GIS, MapGIS 7.0

In 2009, China's GIS new ero—MapGIS K9.

==Geographic Names Information System==
China in the early 1980s began studies for the establishment of its [[Geographic Names Information System]] (地名信息系统), Geographic Names Information System Research Laboratory and the establishment of the National Atlas of geographical names database research.

==Education==
The [[China Association for Geographic Information System]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cagis.org.cn/ 中国地理信息产业协会] {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{zh|s=中国地理信息产业协会|t=中國地理信息產業協會|p=zhōng guó dì lǐ xìn xī chǎn yè xié huì}}), [[Peking University]] and other institutes jointly sponsored the first "Innovation and Development, 2006 College GIS Forum", in [[Beijing]]. More than 300 experts and scholars attended the forum. Sessions involved China's geographic information system (GIS) research in multi-disciplinary fields, personnel training, and technology. China has now more than 500 institutions of higher learning training GIS-related professionals, of which more than 200 universities and colleges have established a GIS lab.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdst.gov.cn/ReadNews.asp?NewsID=4969 我国200多所高校建立地理信息系统实验室] {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry==
The GIS industry in China is worth 400 billion yuan per annum as of November 2007. More than 300,000 people were involved in either building or using these systems, according to Zondy Cyber Group president Wu Xincai, who is also the president of the China Association for Geographic Information System. Almost 20,000 enterprises are estimated to have engaged in the industry. The biggest vendor of GIS in China is Zondy Cyber Group, followed by SuperMap. Around 2000 of these have GIS as a core discipline or function. The industry's rapid expansion is attributed to the country's [[economic development]], which has led to an increase in capital input, from both government and businesses. Between 2001 and 2005 the [[Ministry of Information Industry]] allocated more than 20 million yuan to fund the development and application of GIS. GIS has been put to use in many spheres, including [[topographic surveying and mapping|land survey]], mineral exploitation, [[water conservancy]] and [[environmental protection]]. It also has applications in [[power generation]], [[map]]ping, [[telecommunication]], and the [[management]] of [[public administration]] and [[public services]].

With a land area of 93,030 square km, '''[[Hungary]]''' is a [[landlocked]] country in [[Central Europe]]. It measures about 250&amp;nbsp;km from north to south and 524&amp;nbsp;km from east to west. It has 2,106&amp;nbsp;km of boundaries, shared with [[Austria]] to the west, [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]] to the south and southwest, [[Romania]] to the southeast, [[Ukraine]] to the northeast, and [[Slovakia]] to the north.

Hungary's modern borders were first established after [[World War I]] when, by the terms of the [[Treaty of Trianon]] in 1920, it lost more than 71% of what had formerly been the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], 58.5% of its population, and 32% of the Hungarians. The country secured some boundary revisions from 1938 to 1941: In 1938 the [[First Vienna Award]] gave back territory from [[Czechoslovakia]], in 1939 Hungary occupied [[Carpatho-Ukraine]]. In 1940 the [[Second Vienna Award]] gave back [[Northern Transylvania]] and finally Hungary occupied the [[Bačka|Bácska]] and [[Međimurje County|Muraköz]] regions during the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia]]. However, Hungary lost these territories again with its defeat in [[World War II]]. After World War II, the Trianon boundaries were restored with a small revision that benefited Czechoslovakia.

Most of the country has an elevation of less than 200 m. Although Hungary has several moderately high ranges of mountains, those reaching heights of 300 m or more cover less than 2% of the country. The highest point in the country is [[Kékes]] (1,014 m) in the [[Mátra|Mátra Mountains]] northeast of [[Budapest]]. The lowest spot is 77.6 m above sea level, located in the south of Hungary, near [[Szeged]].

The major rivers in the country are the [[Danube]] and [[Tisza]]. The Danube is navigable within Hungary for 418 kilometers. The Tisza River is navigable for 444&amp;nbsp;km in the country. Less important rivers include the [[Drava]] along the Croatian border, the [[Rába]], the [[Someș (river)|Szamos]], the [[Sió]], and the [[Ipeľ|Ipoly]] along the Slovakian border. Hungary has three major lakes. [[Lake Balaton]], the largest, is 78&amp;nbsp;km long and from 3 to 14&amp;nbsp;km wide, with an area of 600 square km &lt;ref&gt;http://www.kdtvizig.hu/hu/53ab9177-7e15-44eb-a7f3-c004010c2277&lt;/ref&gt;. Hungarians often refer to it as the ''Hungarian Sea''. It is Central Europe's largest [[freshwater]] lake and an important recreation area. Its shallow waters offer good summer swimming, and in winter its frozen surface provides excellent opportunities for winter sports. Smaller bodies of water are [[Lake Velence]] (26 square km) in Fejér County and Lake Fertő ([[Neusiedler See]]—about 82 square km within Hungary), and the artificial [[Lake Tisza]].

Hungary has three major geographic regions (which are subdivided to seven smaller ones): the [[Great Alföld]], lying east of the Danube River; the [[Transdanubia]], a hilly region lying west of the Danube and extending to the Austrian foothills of the [[Alps]]; and the [[North Hungarian Mountains]], which is a mountainous and hilly country beyond the northern boundary of the Great Hungarian Plain.

The country's best natural resource is fertile land, although soil quality varies greatly. About 70% of the country's total territory is suitable for agriculture; of this portion, 72% is arable land. Hungary lacks extensive domestic sources of energy and raw materials needed for industrial development.

==Plains and hills==

:: ''Main articles: [[Little Hungarian Plain]], [[Transdanubia]], [[Great Alföld]].''

[[File:Hortobágy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hortobágy National Park]] on the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] with [[Racka]] sheep]]
The Little Alföld or Little Hungarian Plain is a plain (tectonic basin) of approximately 8,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in northwestern Hungary, southwestern Slovakia and eastern Austria, along the lower course of the [[Rába]] River, with high quality fertile soils.

The Transdanubia region lies in the western part of the country, bounded by the Danube River, the Drava River, and the remainder of the country's border with Slovenia and Croatia. It lies south and west of the course of the Danube. It contains Lake Fertő and Lake Balaton. The region consists mostly of rolling hills. Transdanubia is primarily an agricultural area, with flourishing crops, livestock, and viticulture. Mineral deposits and oil are found in [[Zala County|Zala county]] close to the border of Croatia.

The Great Alföld contains the basin of the Tisza River and its branches. It encompasses more than half of the country's territory. Bordered by mountains on all sides, it has a variety of terrains, including regions of fertile soil, sandy areas, wastelands, and swampy areas. Hungarians have inhabited the Great Plain for at least a millennium. Here is found the [[puszta]], a long, and uncultivated expanse (the most famous such area still in existence is the [[Hortobágy National Park]]), with which much Hungarian folklore is associated. In earlier centuries, the Great Plain was unsuitable for farming because of frequent flooding. Instead, it was the home of massive herds of cattle and horses. In the last half of the 19th century, the government sponsored programs to control the riverways and expedite inland drainage in the Great Plain. With the danger of recurrent flooding largely eliminated, much of the land was placed under cultivation, and herding ceased to be a major contributor to the area's economy.

==Mountains==
:: ''Main articles: [[Alpokalja]], [[Transdanubian Mountains]], [[Mecsek]], [[North Hungarian Mountains]].''

Although the majority of the country has an elevation lesser than 300 m, Hungary has several moderately high ranges of mountains. They can be classified to four geographic regions, from west to east: [[Alpokalja]], [[Transdanubian Mountains]], [[Mecsek]] and [[North Hungarian Mountains]]. Alpokalja (literally ''the foothills of the [[Alps]]'') is located along the [[Austria]]n border; its highest point is [[Írott-kő]] with an elevation of 882 metres. The Transdanubian Mountains stretch from the west part of [[Lake Balaton]] to the [[Danube Bend]] near [[Budapest]], where it meets the North Hungarian Mountains. Its tallest peak is the 757 m high [[Pilis]]. [[Mecsek]] is the southernmost Hungarian mountain range, located north from [[Pécs]] - Its highest point is the [[Zengő]] with 682 metres.

The North Hungarian Mountains lie north of Budapest and run in a northeasterly direction south of the border with Slovakia. The higher ridges, which are mostly forested, have rich coal and iron deposits. Minerals are a major resource of the area and have long been the basis of the industrial economies of cities in the region. Viticulture is also important, producing the famous [[Tokaji]] wine. The highest peak of it is the [[Kékes]], located in the [[Mátra]] mountain range.

[[File:Hungary map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Hungary map of Köppen climate classification.]]
Hungary has a mainly [[continental climate]], with cold winters and warm to hot summers. The average annual temperature is about {{convert|10|°C|°F|abbr=on|lk=on}}, in summer {{convert|27|to|35|C|F}}, and in winter {{convert|0|to|-15|C|F}}, with extremes ranging from about {{convert|42|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in summer to {{convert|-35|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in winter. Average yearly rainfall is about {{convert|600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. Distribution and frequency of rainfall are unpredictable. The western part of the country usually receives more rain than the eastern part, where severe droughts may occur in summertime. Weather conditions in the Great Plain can be especially harsh, with hot summers, cold winters, and scant rainfall.

By the 1980s, the countryside was beginning to show the effects of pollution, both from herbicides used in agriculture and from industrial pollutants. Most noticeable was the gradual contamination of the country's bodies of water, endangering fish and wildlife. Although concern was mounting over these disturbing threats to the environment, no major steps had yet been taken to arrest them.

==Agriculture==
[[File:Corn, Hungary.jpg|right|thumb|Wheat field, Hungary]]
Hungary, with its plains and hilly regions, is highly suitable for agriculture.

===Arable land===
Doubtless, one of Hungary's most important natural resources is [[arable land]]. It covers about 48.57% of the country, which is outstanding in the world (see the related [[:File:Arable land percent world.png|map]]). The mass majority of the [[fertile soil]] has a good quality.

The most important agricultural zones are the [[Little Hungarian Plain]] (it has the highest quality fertile soil in average), [[Transdanubia]], and the [[Great Hungarian Plain]]. The last covers more than half of the country (52,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in number), whereas soil quality varies extremely; the territory even contains a small, grassy [[semi-desert]], the so-called [[puszta]] (steppe in English). Puszta is exploited by [[sheep]] and [[cattle]] raising.

The most important Hungarian agricultural products include [[maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[oat]], [[sunflower]], [[poppy]],&lt;!-- [[just poppy seed, or poppyseed oil or opium too? --&gt; [[potato]], [[millet]], [[beet|sugar-beet]], [[flax]], and many other plants. There are also some newly naturalized plants too, for example [[amaranth]]. [[Poppy seed]] is part of the traditional [[Hungarian cuisine]].

[[File:Paprikahungarian.jpg|right|thumb|A greengrocer's in Hungary]] The country is well known for producing high quality [[Capsicum annuum|peppers]], which are often made into [[paprika]]. There are numerous fruits reared, including many subspecies of [[apple]], [[pear]], [[peach]], [[grape]], [[apricot]], [[watermelon]], [[cantaloupe]], etc.

Hungary does not grow any [[Genetically modified organism|GMO]] products, thus these products are mainly imported from the [[United States]]. They cannot, however, be distributed without a mark on the wrapping.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Viticulture===
Wine production has a long history in Hungary. There are two languages in [[Europe]] in which the word for "wine" does not derive from the [[Latin language|Latin]], being [[Greek language|Greek]] &amp;ndash; and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. The Hungarian word is ''bor''.

Viticulture has been recorded in the territory of today's Hungary since the Roman times, who were responsible for the introduction of the cultivation of wines. The arriving Hungarians took over the practice and have maintained it ever since.

Today, there are numerous wine regions in Hungary, producing quality and inexpensive wines as well, comparable to Western European ones. The majority of the country's wine regions are located in the mountains or in the hills, such as [[Transdanubian Mountains]], [[North Hungarian Mountains]], [[Villány Mountains]], and so on. Important ones include the regions of [[Eger]], [[Hajós]], [[Somló]], [[Sopron]], [[Villány]], [[Szekszárd]], and [[Tokaj-Hegyalja]].

===Forestry===
19% of the country is covered by [[forest]]s. These are mainly mountainous areas, such as the North Hungarian and the Transdanubian Mountains, and the [[Alpokalja]]. The composition of forests is various, with trees like [[fir]], [[beech]], [[oak]], [[willow]], [[acacia]], [[Platanus|plane]], etc. {{See also|Honey production in Hungary}}

==Political geography==
{{Further|Counties of Hungary|NUTS of Hungary}}

Hungary's current [[Counties of Hungary|counties]] are largely based on the country's historic regions. The counties are subdivided into ''[[Districts of Hungary|district]]s'' (''járás''), and these are further divided into ''[[municipality|municipalities]]'' (''település''). Hungary has 19 counties, 174 districts + 23 [[List of districts in Budapest|districts in Budapest]] and 2,722 ''municipality''.

[[File:Gjoea.jpg|thumb|upright|''Gjøa'' at the [[Norsk Sjøfartsmuseum|Norwegian Maritime Museum]] in [[Oslo]]]]
'''''Gjøa''''' was the first vessel to transit the [[Northwest Passage]]. With a crew of six, [[Roald Amundsen]] traversed the passage in a three-year journey, finishing in 1906.&lt;ref name = polarskute&gt;[http://www.snl.no/Gj%C3%B8a/norsk_polarskute ''Gjøa – norsk polarskute'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Gjøa.jpg|right|thumb|''Gjøa'', the first ship to sail through the [[Northwest Passage]]]]
[[File:Gjøa i 1903.jpg|thumb|upright|''Gjøa'' in 1903, at the time of the Northwest passage expedition]]

=== Construction ===
The {{convert|70|by|20|ft|abbr=on}} square-sterned [[sloop]] of 45 [[net register tonnage]] ({{Convert|4500|cuft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) was built by Knut Johannesson Skaale in [[Rosendal, Norway|Rosendal]], [[Norway]] in 1872, the same year Amundsen was born.&lt;ref name = polarskute/&gt; She was named ''Gjøa'' after her then owner's wife. (''Gjøa'' is a modern form of the [[Norse language|Norse]] name ''Gyða'' - this again is a compressed form of ''Guðfríðr'', a compound of ''guð'' 'god' and ''fríðr'' 'beautiful'.) For the next 28 years the vessel served as a [[herring]] fishing boat.

=== Purchase by Amundsen ===
On March 28, 1901, Amundsen bought her from Asbjørn Sexe of [[Ullensvang]], Norway, for his forthcoming expedition to the [[Arctic Ocean]]. ''Gjøa'' was much smaller than vessels used by other [[List of Arctic expeditions|Arctic expeditions]], but Amundsen intended to live off the limited resources of the land and sea through which he was to travel, and reasoned that the land could sustain only a tiny crew (this had been the cause of the catastrophic failure of [[John Franklin]]'s expedition fifty years previously). Her shallow draught would help her traverse the shoals of the [[Arctic]] straits. Perhaps most importantly, the aging ship was all that Amundsen (who was financing his expedition largely by spending his inheritance) could afford.{{citation needed|date = May 2012}}

Amundsen had little experience of Arctic sailing, and so decided to undertake a training expedition before braving the Arctic ice. He engaged Hans Christian Johannsen, her previous owner, and a small crew, and sailed from [[Tromsø]] in April 1901. The next five months were spent sealing on the pack ice of the [[Barents Sea]]. Following their return to Tromsø in September, Amundsen set about remedying the deficiencies in ''Gjøa'' that the trip had exposed. He had a 13 [[horsepower]] single-screw marine [[Kerosene|paraffin]] motor installed (she had hitherto been propelled only by [[sail]], and had proved to be sluggish). Much of the winter was spent upgrading her ice sheathing; Amundsen knew she would spend several winters iced-in.{{citation needed|date = May 2012}}

=== Journey through the Northwest passage ===
In the spring of 1902, her refit complete, Amundsen sailed her to [[Oslo|Christiania]] (later called Oslo), the capital of Norway. At this time Norway was still in an (increasingly unhappy) union with [[Sweden]], and Amundsen hoped the nationalistic spirit which was sweeping the country would attract sponsors willing to underwrite the expedition's burgeoning costs. After much wrangling, and a donation from [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar]], he succeeded. By the time Amundsen returned, Norway had gained its independence and he and his crew were among the new country's first national heroes.{{citation needed|date = May 2012}}

Amundsen was to serve as the expedition leader and ''Gjøa's'' master. His crew were [[Godfred Hansen]], a [[Denmark|Danish]] naval lieutenant and ''Gjøa'''s first officer; [[Helmer Hanssen]], second officer, an experienced ice pilot who would accompany Amundsen on many of his subsequent expeditions; [[Anton Lund]], an experienced sealing captain; [[Peder Ristvedt]] (1873-1955), chief engineer; [[Gustav Juel Wiik]], second engineer, a gunner in the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]]; and [[Adolf Lindstrøm|Adolf Henrik Lindstrøm]] (1866-1939), cook.&lt;ref&gt;''Et liv i isen: Polarkokken Adolf H. Lindstrøm'' (by Jan Ove Ekeberg, 2000. Kagge. {{ISBN|978-82-489-0075-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gjøa'' left the [[Oslofjord]] on June 16, 1903, and made for the [[Labrador Sea]] west of [[Greenland]]. From there she crossed [[Baffin Bay]] and navigated the narrow, icy straits of the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|Arctic Archipelago]]. By late September ''Gjøa'' was west of the [[Boothia Peninsula]] and began to encounter worsening weather and sea ice. Amundsen put her into a natural harbour on the south shore of [[King William Island]]; by October 3 she was iced in.&lt;ref&gt;Kieran Mulvaneu, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1_T7JZveHkAC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;lpg=PA179&amp;dq=Gj%C3%B8a+3+october+ice&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z58QO_ls-l&amp;sig=92yyNi3cDJ_aBOzY-VEdetlxXQ0&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=T9w7VNuvMZHpaK-RgMgC&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Gj%C3%B8a%203%20october%20ice&amp;f=false At the Ends of the Earth: A History Of The Polar Regions]'', Island Press, 2001, p. 179, {{ISBN|1559639083}}, {{ISBN|9781559639088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There she remained for nearly two years, with her crew undertaking sledge journeys to make measurements to determine the location of the [[North Magnetic Pole]], and learning from the local [[Inuit]] people. The harbour, known as Uqsuqtuuq ("lots of fat") in [[Inuktitut]], has become the only settlement on the island - [[Gjoa Haven]], [[Nunavut]]&lt;!-- sic: o not ø --&gt; has a population of over a thousand people (1,279 at the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 census]]).&lt;ref name="havencensus2011"&gt;Statistics Canada. 2012.

Statistics Canada Catalogue no. 98-316-XWE. Ottawa. Released October 24, 2012 (accessed May 20, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nome-1906-roald-amundsen.jpg|thumb|right|''Gjøa'' arrives in Nome, August 1906]]

''Gjøa'' left Gjoa Haven on August 13, 1905, and motored through the treacherous straits south of [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]], and from there west into the [[Beaufort Sea]]. By October ''Gjøa'' was again iced-in, this time near [[Herschel Island]] in the [[Yukon]]. Amundsen left his men on board and spent much of the winter skiing 500 miles south to [[Eagle, Alaska|Eagle]], [[Alaska]] to telegraph news of the expedition's success. He returned in March, but ''Gjøa'' remained icebound until July 11. ''Gjøa'' reached [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] on August 31, 1906. She sailed on to [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|earthquake ravaged]] [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]], where the expedition was met with a hero's welcome on October 19.{{citation needed|date = May 2012}}

=== San Francisco: deterioration and restoration ===
Rather than sail her round [[Cape Horn]] and back to Norway, the [[Norwegian American]] community in San Francisco prevailed on Amundsen to sell her to them. The ship was donated to the city of San Francisco and the ship was dragged up the beach&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=21336 Roald Amundsen Marker -Historical Marker Database]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outsidelands.org/gjoa.php The Gjoa - Western Neighborhoods Project - San Francisco History - The Roald Amundsen Monument - Or The Ship That Isn't There]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norway.org/ARCHIVE/sanfrancisco/Events/amundsen/ 100 years since "Gjøa" arrived in San Francisco - Norwegian Consulate General San Francisco]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o2o6jRFjsMMC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=bauta%7C%22memorial+pillar%22+Gj%C3%B8a+%22San+Francisco%22%7C%22Golden+Gate+Park%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=21eU2Zv-OP&amp;sig=hU0GhfSsdhmwREmY7BPE7PcoGdA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VAeMUfyDGbGujAKzroG4CA&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBA San Francisco's Golden Gate Park - Chris Pollock]&lt;/ref&gt; to the northwest corner of [[Golden Gate Park]], surrounded by low fence and put on display. Amundsen knew that the notoriety that his exploits aboard ''Gjøa'' had earned him would allow him access to [[Fridtjof Nansen|Nansen]]'s ship ''[[Fram]]'', which had been custom-made for ice work and was owned by the Norwegian state. Amundsen and his crew traveled back to Norway by commercial ship. Of the expedition members, only Wiik did not return to Norway; he had died of illness during the third Arctic winter.

Over the following decades ''Gjøa'' slowly deteriorated, and by 1939 she was in poor condition. Refurbishment was delayed by [[World War II]], and repairs were not completed until 1949. Being displayed outdoors and having faced 66 years of high winds, ocean salt and sand, the boat once again suffered deterioration, until in 1972, with the help of Erik Krag, a Danish American shipping company owner of San Francisco, ''Gjøa'' was returned to Norway. Erik Krag was knighted by the King of Norway for his efforts in shipping home ''Gjøa''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norway.org/ARCHIVE/sanfrancisco/Events/amundsen/ ''100 years since "Gjøa" arrived in San Francisco'' (Norwegian Consulate General San Francisco - norway.org)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Gjøa'' was displayed in the [[Norsk Sjøfartsmuseum|Norwegian Maritime Museum]]  (Norwegian: ''Norsk Maritimt Museum'') in [[Bygdøy]], Oslo. In May 2009 the Norwegian Maritime Museum and the [[Fram Museum]]  (Norwegian: ''Frammuseet'') signed an agreement for the Fram Museum of Bygdøy to take over the exhibition of the ''Gjøa''.  It is currently displayed in a separate building at Fram Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.frammuseum.no/Polar-Expedition/The-Northwest-Passage-%281903-1906%29.aspx?lang=nn-NO|title=  Gjøa-Ekspedisjonen (1903-1906)|publisher=  The Fram Museum|accessdate=  December 1,  2016|deadurl=  yes|archiveurl=  https://web.archive.org/web/20150906070030/http://www.frammuseum.no/Polar-Expedition/The-Northwest-Passage-%281903-1906%29.aspx?lang=nn-NO|archivedate=  2015-09-06|df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''bauta'' (memorial pillar) now stands near ''Gjøa'''s former home in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gjoa-monument Gjoa Monument | Atlas Obscura]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gjøa'' was also featured as a filming location in the 2005 documentary,'' [[The Search for the Northwest Passage]]'', in which [[Kåre Conradi]] played Amundsen.

== History ==

=== Background ===

[[File:Thorvald Stoltenberg 2007.jpg|thumb|left|145px|[[Thorvald Stoltenberg]] witness of UN on signing of [[Erdut Agreement]]]]
During the [[Croatian War of Independence]], a self-proclaimed [[Serb Autonomous Regions|Serb Autonomous Region]] [[SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia]] was formed. SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia was [[ethnically cleansed]] of its non-Serb population and became part of the self-declared [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]], which committed numerous war crimes against Croats, [[Hungarians of Croatia|Hungarians]], [[Pannonian Rusyns|Ruthenians]] and other non-Serbs. Several Serb military and political officials, including Milošević, were later indicted and in some cases jailed for war crimes committed during and after occupation Eastern Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= UNTAES: A Success Story in the Former Yugoslavia |url=http://fas.org/irp/agency/army/tradoc/usaic/mipb/1998-1/JONESfnl.htm |title=UN Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium|publisher=[[UNTAES]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Novilist The trial of Goran Hadzic |url=http://www.novilist.hr/Vijesti/Svijet/Svjedok-na-sudenju-Hadzicu-o-mucenju-u-Dalju-Cigaretom-sam-palio-tetovazu-da-mi-ne-odsjeku-ruku|title=International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|publisher=[[Novi list]]|date=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Croatian army took control of the rest of the Republic of Serbian Krajina, the only area of Croatia that remained under Serb control was Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia.&lt;ref name="Thorny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecmi.de/fileadmin/downloads/publications/JEMIE/2003/nr3/Focus3-2003_Caspersen.pdf|title=The Thorny Issue of Ethnic Autonomy in Croatia:  Serb Leaders and Proposals for Autonomy |first=Nina |last=Caspersen|publisher=London School of Economics |format=PDF |year=2003 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local Serbs therefore concluded that without an agreement, they would face the same fate as those in the western part of [[Republic of Serbian Krajina|Krajina]]. Meanwhile, [[Slobodan Milošević]] and [[Franjo Tuđman]] reached a consensus via the [[Dayton Agreement]] and on 12 November, the [[Erdut Agreement]] ended the war in eastern [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name="Thorny"/&gt; There was established transition period in which region was reintegrated with help of [[United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium]].

The Erdut agreement guarantees the Serbs "the highest level of internationally recognised human rights and fundamental freedoms". The Serb community was given the right to "appoint a joint Council of Municipalities".&lt;ref name="Thorny"/&gt; The Council was established in 1997&lt;ref name="radio-borovo.hr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hr.wikisource.org/wiki/Erdutski_sporazum |title=Erdutski sporazum – Wikizvor |language=hr |publisher=Hr.wikisource.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council is one of the organisations that comprise the [[Serb National Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snv.hr/snv/o-nama/ |title=SNV – Srpsko narodno vijeće |publisher=Snv.hr }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/469cbf8f0.pdf |title=Minorities in Croatia |publisher=[[UNHCR]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation ===

The founding Charter was signed on 15 July 1997 at [[Osijek Airport]] in the presence of [[UNTAES]] Head [[Jacques Paul Klein]]. In early August the president of Committee for Civic, Human and Minority Rights, Branko Jurišić, complained to representatives of the European Union Monitoring Mission that the Council had not been registered in [[Zagreb]] although it had already begun to carry out most of the powers on the ground. This condition would last until the end of [[UNTAES]] mission in 1998.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;C:\Users\Nikola\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5\70VL778E\SS11_393_454_Baric.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Erdut Agreement established the Council as a legal entity, its function was not clearly defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novossti.com/2011/08/usud-srpskog-narodnog-vijeca/ |title=Usud Srpskog narodnog vijeća |publisher=Novossti.com |date=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the end of the war until 2010 the Council functioned as an association of municipalities. In this period, the Government was required to fund its work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/3b00f14f30.pdf |title=Refworld &amp;#124; Statement by the President of the Security Council [on "The situation in Croatia"&amp;#93; |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=13 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/3b00f26a20.pdf |title=Refworld &amp;#124; Statement by the President of the Security Council [on "The situation in Croatia"&amp;#93; |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=2 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Council's legal position was below the level anticipated by the [[Croatian Government]].&lt;ref&gt;Odluka Vlade Republike Hrvatske o osnivanju zajedničkog vijeća općina, 15. listopad 1998., Zagreb&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[Croatian parliament]] amended to the [[Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities in the Republic of Croatia|Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities]].&lt;ref name="sabor.hr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?art=34144 |title=Hrvatski sabor |publisher=Sabor.hr }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the proposal, the Council was to become a special administrative unit of Croatia that would be located in the territory of two counties.&lt;ref name="snv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snv.hr/tjednik-novosti/549/erdutski-sporazum-ne-mora-biti-dobar-temelj-za-mirnodopsku-drzavu/ |title=Erdutski sporazum ne mora biti dobar temelj za mirnodopsku državu |publisher=Snv.hr }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed article of the constitutional law was

This decision provoked a heated Parliamentary debate. Opponents argued that this created a kind of local government with no parallel in the rest of the country. [[Milorad Pupovac]], MP of the Serbian national minority condemned the MPs who were willing to recognise the full independence of [[Kosovo]], while objecting to the autonomy of the local Serbian community.&lt;ref name="vecernji.hr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/sabor-potporu-vecine-izglasovao-ustavne-promjene-clanak-156373 |title=Sabor uz potporu većine izglasovao ustavne promjene – Aktualno – hrvatska – Večernji list |publisher=Vecernji.hr }}&lt;/ref&gt; President of the [[Independent Democratic Serbian Party]] [[Vojislav Stanimirović (politician)|Vojislav Stanimirović]] attacked MP [[Vesna Pusić]] (then-President of the National Committee for Monitoring Accession Negotiations with EU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Srijeda 24. travnja 2013. 08:07h |url=http://dalje.com/hr-hrvatska/sdss-osudio-govor-vesne-pusic-u-saboru--to-je-tragedija/310406 |title=SDSS osudio govor Vesne Pusić u Saboru: To je tragedija – Sabor – Politika – Hrvatska |publisher=Dalje.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

International guarantees of JCM took effect in 1996, following [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1037]]. Over the years, JCM officials had formal meetings with foreign officials, including with former [[President of Serbia]] [[Boris Tadić]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/tadic-se-sastao-predstavnicima-srpske-manjine-regije-clanak-359675 |title=Tadić se sastao s predstavnicima srpske manjine iz regije – Aktualno – svijet – Večernji list |publisher=Vecernji.hr }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Ambassador to Croatia|US Ambassador in Zagreb]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zagreb.usembassy.gov/programs_and_events/2010_february.html |title=Programs and Events &amp;#124; Embassy of the United States Zagreb, Croatia |publisher=Zagreb.usembassy.gov |access-date=2 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218051812/http://zagreb.usembassy.gov/programs_and_events/2010_february.html# |archive-date=18 February 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and President of the [[President of the Government of Vojvodina|Government]] of [[Vojvodina]], [[Bojan Pajtić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vojvodina.gov.rs/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5972&amp;day=04&amp;Itemid=1&amp;month=11&amp;year=2011&amp;lday=04&amp;lmonth=2&amp;lyear=2012 |title=Vlada Autonomne Pokrajine Vojvodine |publisher=Vojvodina.gov.rs }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any municipality or town in these two counties where Serbs constitute a certain percentage of the population automatically participate in its work. However, no authority of municipalities was formally transferred to the Council. The municipalities also co-operate outside the Council in matters that are not within Council jurisdiction, such as joint appearances at fairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=doxikus |url=http://www.slideshare.net/doxikus/zajedniki-nastup-opiina-na-novosadskom-sajmu |title=Zajednički nastup Općina na Novosadskom sajmu |publisher=Slideshare.net }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://porc.opcina-erdut.hr/trenutni-projekti/predstavljanje-opcina-novi-sad.html |title=Kratak Izvještaj O Ostvarenoj Prezentaciji Općina Mikroregije, Borovo, Erdut, Jagodnjak, Markušica, Negoslavci I Trpinja |publisher=Porc.opcina-erdut.hr }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==

[[File:Srednja škola Dalj.jpg|thumb|[[High School Dalj]]]]

On the territory of JCM members, in most public schools classes are given in separate Serbian and [[Croatian language]] classes. This practice is followed in [[Vukovar]], [[Beli Manastir]] and villages inhabited by minority communities that are located outside member municipalities. No private schools operate in the area. Secondary schools are located in [[Dalj]] ([[High School Dalj]]) and [[Borovo, Croatia|Borovo]] (part of Vukovar high school). No institutions of higher education operate there. The majority of students attend [[University of Novi Sad]], [[University of Osijek]], [[University of Belgrade]], [[University of Zagreb]] and [[University of Banja Luka]]. The [[Cultural and Scientific Center "Milutin Milanković"]] is located in Dalj. Committee for Education, Culture and Sport of Joint Council of Municipalities conducts activities aimed at fostering the [[Serbian language]] and [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]], through preservation of memories of important individuals and events from the past of [[Serbian state]] and [[Serbs|ethnic group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zvo.hr/ododbor%20za%20obrazovanje.htm |title=Zajednicko vece opština Vukovar |publisher=Zvo.hr }}&lt;/ref&gt; Joint Council of Municipalities supports the registration of Serbian language public schools in which classes.

== Culture ==

[[File:Rodna kuća Milutina Milankovića.jpg|thumb|right|145px|A large number of events is organised in the native home of scientist [[Milutin Milanković]]]]

JCM organises multiple cultural events: ''"Selu u pohode"'' ''(English: "Village Revisited")'', ''"Međunarodni festival dečijeg folklora"'' ''(English: "International Festival of Child Folklore")'', ''"Horsko duhovno veče"'' ''(English: "Choir Spiritual Night")'' and ''"Izložba likovnog stvaralaštva"'' ''(English: "The exhibition of fine art")''.

On 23 May 2011, JCM celebrated the "Day of the Joint Council of Municipalities". The day began by laying flowers on the grave of the first President of Council, Miloš Vojnović at a New cemetery in [[Vukovar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novossti.com/2011/06/pokrajine-59/ |title=Pokrajine |publisher=Novossti.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=LogIT Internet Usluge – www.logit.hr – tel: 01/3773-062, 01/3773-063, 042/207-507 |url=http://www.radio-borovo.hr/index.php/index.php?SID=&amp;NID=2103 |title=:.: Radio Borovo :.: |publisher=Radio-borovo.hr |date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, in the hotel "Lav", a ceremony took place. Council President Dragan Crnogorac stated:

{{quote|''From this important date (i.e. the date of the establishment), Joint Council of Municipalities, as an internationally recognised institution in Croatia, works on preserving of rights and interests of the Serbs, their cultural and educational autonomy, Serbian traditions, customs, language and Cyrillic alphabet, but also works on reconstruction, development, and improvement of the entire life of all citizens and because of this it is respected and stable partner of the government and of all entities that are committed to these values.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snv.hr/vijesti/medjunarodno-priznata-institucija/ |title=Snv – Vijesti – Međunarodno Priznata Institucija |publisher=Snv.hr }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''João de Sá''', [[knight]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1497 – 1514) was a [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Portuguese explorer]], who accompanied [[Vasco da Gama]] on the voyage of the first ships to sail directly from Europe to [[India]].

== Biography ==
[[File:Vascodagama.JPG|thumb|upright|Vasco da Gama lands at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], 20 May 1498.]]
Sá was a [[scrivener]] on the first Portuguese voyage to India, traveling on the [[carrack]] ''São Rafael'' which was captained by Vasco da Gama's younger brother, [[Paulo da Gama]]. Sá was also a member of the group who accompanied Gama on his first trip into [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] on 20 May 1498.

On the return voyage the ''São Rafael'' was scuttled off the East African coast, and the crew re-distributed to the remaining two ships, the ''[[São Gabriel (ship)|São Gabriel]]'' and the ''Berrio'', as by this point there were not enough crewmen left standing to manage all three ships. This was due to the loss of almost half the crew during the voyage across the Indian Ocean, and to [[scurvy]] being rife amongst the survivors. João de Sá transferred to the ''São Gabriel''. Later on, after having sailed around Africa, Sá was given command of the ship because Vasco da Gama decided to remain at [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]] island with his brother Paulo, who had fallen seriously ill.&lt;ref name=Radulet/&gt; The ''S. Gabriel'' under Sá arrived in Lisbon sometime in late July or early August. Although Paulo was later able to travel on with his brother towards Portugal, he died whilst en route and was buried at the monastery of São Francisco in [[Angra do Heroismo]].

João de Sá is one of the purported authors of the anonymous ''Journal of Vasco Da Gama's trip of 1497'' (the other being [[Álvaro Velho]]).&lt;ref name=Radulet&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = Academia de Marinha| isbn = 972-781-015-2| conference = II Simpósio de História Marítima| pages = 89–100| last = Radulet| first = Carmen| title = Acerda da autoria do "Diário da navegaçao de Vasco da Gama" (1497-1499)| booktitle = Os descobrimentos portugueses no século XV| location = Lisboa| date = 1994-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work survives in a single manuscript copy preserved at the Biblioteca Pública Municipal of Porto and first published in [[Porto]] in 1838. In 1945, historian [[Franz Hümmerich]] identified the author of this manuscript with an Álvaro Velho who had spent eight years in [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]] and provided information about the [[Gambia]] region to [[Valentim Fernandes]]. However, more recent studies by Carmen Radulet have exposed weaknesses in this theory and attributed the ''Journal'' with more certainty to scrivener João de Sá.&lt;ref name=Radulet/&gt;

Like Vasco da Gama, João de Sá appears to have been closely associated with the Almeida family. It is believed that he spent some time at [[Safi, Morocco|Safi]] (North Africa) after his return from [[India]], possibly at the same time as being ''criado'' to the [[Bishop of Coimbra]], D. [[Jorge de Almeida]].

Between February 1511 and April 1514, de Sá, who was a trained [[scrivener]], was the ''treasurer of spices'' in the [[Casa da Índia]]. He had also become a cavalier by [[John II of Portugal|royal letter]] in January 1512.

'''Karl W. Butzer'''  (August 19, 1934 – May 4, 2016) was a German-born American geographer, ecologist, and archaeologist. While he was still a child, his family emigrated, first to England, and then to Canada.  He obtained a master's degree in Meteorology and Geography from [[McGill University]] and a doctorate in physical geography from the [[University of Bonn]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="UT Karl W. Butzer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Karl W. Butzer|url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/geography/faculty/profile.php?id=butzerkw|publisher=University of Texas|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1959 through 1966 he taught at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].  This was followed by a stint at the ETH in Zurich, Switzerland.  Next, he taught at the [[University of Chicago]] until 1984.  After that, he went to the [[Department of Geography and the Environment at University of Texas at Austin]].

==Life==
Butzer was born in 1934 in [[Mülheim]] to a Catholic Family.  In 1937 as a young child his family fled{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Germany for England and later during World War II, they moved to Canada.

He received two degrees at [[McGill University]], Montreal: the B.Sc. (hons) in Mathematics in 1954 and later his master's degree in Meteorology and Geography. Afterwards in the 1950s he returned to Germany to the University of Bonn to obtain a doctorate in physical geography.

Butzer died on May 4, 2016 in [[Austin, Texas]] at the age of 81.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aag.org/cs/membership/tributes_memorials/af/butzer_karl|title=Butzer, Karl - AAG|work=aag.org|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major Areas of International Fieldwork==
* Egypt and Nubia, including dissertation fieldwork (1956); archaeological survey for the German Archaeological Institute (1958); Quaternary studies and geoarchaeology for Yale University (1962–63); and geoarchaeology of the ‘Lost City of the Pyramids’ (Ancient Egypt Research Associates) (2001–02).

==Courses Developed and Students==
At the University of Wisconsin (1960-66), Butzer regularly offered a course on Pleistocene environments, including what is now called geoarchaeology, in addition to introductory physical geography, and graduate seminars in climatology and coastal geomorphology.
At the University of Chicago (1966-84), he taught advanced courses in physical geography, applied geomorphology, and environmental archaeology, as well as graduate seminars in [[settlement archaeology]] and geography.
At the ETH-Zurich (1981-82), he introduced a new program in human geography, which continued to be implemented after his departure.
At the University of Texas (since 1984), he offered graduate courses in geoarchaeology and environmental history; cultural ecology; historical geography; and landscape, society, and meaning.
In 2005 he received an Outstanding Graduate Teaching Award of the University of Texas.  He has had 30 Ph.D.’s (9 of them women) and 16 M.A.’s (7 women), at Wisconsin, Chicago, and Texas.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Men Behaving Badly'' episodes}}
''[[Men Behaving Badly]]'' is a [[British sitcom]] that was created and written by [[Simon Nye]].  It was first broadcast on [[ITV Network|ITV]] from 1992, moving to [[BBC One]] from 1994 to 1998.  A total of six series were made along with a Christmas special and three final episodes that make up the feature-length "last orders".

Each episode follows the lives of flatmates Gary Strang ([[Martin Clunes]]) and Tony Smart ([[Neil Morrissey]]) - except series 1, in which Dermot Povey ([[Harry Enfield]]) is Gary's flatmate. The other major characters are Gary's girlfriend Dorothy Bishop ([[Caroline Quentin]]) and the occupant of the flat above, later Tony's girlfriend, Deborah Burton ([[Leslie Ash]]).

 |ShortSummary=The episode begins with Tony and Deborah sitting watching a drama programme, in which Deborah is engrossed while Tony is finding it tediously boring. After he fails to divert Deborah's attention away from the TV and onto himself, she loses patience and firmly states that although she finds him attractive, Tony's selfishness and immaturity will always prevent them being a couple. Gary meanwhile is starting to grow suspicions that Dorothy could be having an affair after reading an article in a magazine that bears striking resemblance to the couple's relationship (such as receiving guilt inspired presents and giving lame excuses to avoid seeing each other). The evidence prompts Gary to ask Dorothy outright upon her arrival at the flat, to which she simply replies 'that it's for you to find out'.

Gary decides to play detective in order to find out Dorothy's whereabouts and begins by hiring a disguise (a Mexican hat) and a red Nissan Micra which he sits in outside Dorothy's parents' house to keep watch on any suspicious visitors. Tony meanwhile joins the Happy Companion Scheme at the local old people's home, in the hope that it will prove to Deborah that he is capable of caring about people other than himself.

This is a '''list of rulers of Iceland''', ruling from 1262 to 1944.

Iceland was settled in the late 9th and early 10th centuries, principally by people of [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] and other [[Scandinavia]]n origin. In 930, the ruling chiefs established a republican [[constitution]] and an assembly called the [[Althing]]—the oldest parliament in the world. [[Icelandic Commonwealth|Iceland remained independent]] until 1262, when it entered into a [[Old Covenant (Iceland)|treaty which established a union]] with the [[Monarchy of Norway|Norwegian monarchy]]. In the late 14th century [[Hereditary Kingdom of Norway|Norway]] and [[Denmark]] entered into a union. The union between Denmark and Norway, ignoring some shorter periods, lasted until 1814, when Norway briefly [[Norway in 1814|gained independence]], and Iceland became an integral part of Denmark until 1918, when Iceland was recognised as a fully [[Kingdom of Iceland|sovereign state]] united with Denmark under a [[Personal union|common monarch]], on 1 December that same year.

Following a [[Icelandic constitutional referendum, 1944|constitutional referendum]] between 20 and 23 May 1944, Iceland formally became an [[Founding of the Republic of Iceland|independent republic]] on 17 June 1944. Since Denmark was still occupied by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], many Danes felt offended that the step should have been taken at the time. Still, the King of Denmark, [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]], sent a message of congratulations to the Icelandic people.

'''Mount Nyangani''' (formerly Mount Inyangani) is the highest mountain in [[Zimbabwe]] at 2,592 m (8,504&amp;nbsp;ft). The mountain is located within [[Nyanga National Park]] in [[Nyanga District]], is about {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}} north west [[Mutare]]. The summit lies atop a small outcrop of rock around 40m above the surrounding area. The remainder of the peak is a broad moor of mainly rolling hills and plateau with an area of about 8&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The edges of this plateau then fall steeply to the east and west sides. The mountain vegetation is largely composed of heath around the summit plateau with evergreen forest along the wetter eastern slopes and grassland to the western side. Annual rainfall totals are high (around 2200&amp;nbsp;mm) but long spells of dry weather occur during the winter period of May to August. Due to its relatively low altitude and tropical location, snow falls very rarely, last recorded in August 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldclimate.com/sources.htm GHCN] Climate data, Temperature and Precipitation profiles, Inyanga and Inyanga Downs, 1902-1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
The mountain is composed of an upper [[Sill (geology)|sill]] of [[dolerite]] and [[sandstone]], with the harder dolerite forming cliffs and ridges.  The dolerite sill and the sediments underlying it are probably part of the Umkondo Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Love, D.|date=February 2002|title=The geology of Nyangani Mountain: a preliminary report |publisher=[[University of Zimbabwe]] Earth Science Research Seminar Series |url=http://www.uz.ac.zw/science/geology/davidlove/Nyangani-prelim%20abs.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224746/http://www.uz.ac.zw/science/geology/davidlove/Nyangani-prelim%20abs.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-26 |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Umkondo Group dolerite sill north of Nyangani, on the Kwaraguza Road, has been [[Radiometric dating|dated]] at 1099 Ma &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wingate, M.T.D.|year=2001|title=SHRIMP baddeleyite and zircon ages for an Umkondo dolerite sill, Nyanga Mountains, eastern Zimbabwe|journal=[[South African Journal of Geology]]|volume=104|pages=13–22|url=http://sajg.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/104/1/13|accessdate=2009-02-06|doi=10.2113/104.1.13|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==
The mountain can be accessed from four base points within [[Nyanga National Park]]:

(1) The official car park, at the base of the Tourist Route. This is reached from Circular Drive.

(2) The Mountain Club of Zimbabwe hut, on the Kwaraguza Road, accessed via Circular Drive.

(3) Nyazengun Substation of Nyanga National Park, accessed via a road which goes south from just before the official car park.

(4) Gleneagles Substation of Nyanga National Park, accessed via the Circular Drive, Kwaraguza Road and the Gleneagles road or from [[Troutbeck, Manicaland|Troutbeck]] via [[Nyafaru]].

==Mountain Hikes==
[[Image:nyangani from nyamuziwa source.jpg|400px|thumb|left|Mount Nyangani from the west. The falls in the middle ground are on the upper Nyamuziwa River and the Tourist Path ascends to their right. The start of the Tourist Path is in the lower right of the picture. The route from the Mountain Club of Zimbabwe hut is on the far side of the skyline ridge on the left of the picture.]]The peak can be reached within 1–3 hours by anyone of average fitness. This ascent brings the hiker to an altitude of about 2200m and the remainder is mostly walking across the gentler gradients of the summit plateau. The hazards here are produced by bewilderingly fast weather changes that can switch from sunny skies to thick fog, and under these conditions several fatalities have occurred due to hikers losing their way and falling down ravines. There are three ascents that follow paths:

* The main access to the mountain is a Tourist Path from the west. This ascends along the edge of the upper Nyamuziwa river and crosses onto the main plateau north of the summit. From there it heads south across the plateau to the summit.
* A second path runs from the Mountain Club of Zimbabwe hut. This paths follows the east side of the northern ridge, before joining the Tourist Path on the main plateau .
* A third path runs from Nyazengu, southwest of the mountain on the old road to the [[Pungwe River]] causeway (Pungwe Drift). It branches from the Nyazengu Trail and ascends to the base of Tucker's Gap, which has views of the montane rainforest to the southeast of the mountain (on the few days when the cloud does not cover the Gap). It is possible to ascend the north side of the gap (marked path) and then walk northwards across a boulder field to the main plateau, approaching the summit from the south. However, this last stretch has no path or markings.

The mountain can also be ascended using the following routes which do not have paths or markings:

* The north-eastern ridge, between the Nyama and Kairezi Rivers. This route starts from the Gleneages Road, between the Nyama and Kairezi causeways, and follows a ridge up to the main plateau, northeast of the summit and east of the Tourist Path.
* Via Little Nyangani. This route starts from Gleneagles Substation, and ascends the heavily vegetated slope of Little Nyangani mountain, which lies to the east of the main plateau. From Little Nyangani, one can descend west to a rainforest-covered saddle, then ascend west onto the main plateau via Kairezi Falls, reaching the main plateau east of the summit.

The above are all walks or scrambles, without rock climbing involved. However, caution is advised, especially on unmarked routes, as the weather may change very rapidly: descent of cloud can result in visibility of less than 50 m. This may well be the cause for a number of disappearances on the mountain, such as that of two teenage children of the then Minister of Finance, Tichaendepi Masaya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mount Nyangani|url=http://www.mauya.co.zw/index.php?view=article&amp;id=60:magazine&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=67|accessdate=2009-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rivers and Waterfalls==
[[Image:nyama falls.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Nyama Falls.]]
Three rivers have their sources on Mount Nyangani: the Nyamuziwa River, the Kairezi (Gairezi) River and the [[Pungwe River]]. The first two are tributaries of the Mazowe River, which is itself a tributary of the [[Zambezi River]].

The Nyama River, a tributary of the Kayirezi, falls off the main plateau in a waterfall on the northeast of the mountain and the Kairezi Falls are located on the east edge of the main plateau.

==Fauna==
The fauna of the area is described under [[Nyanga National Park]]. Additional information:

* The clawless [[otter]] is common in the upper Kairezi River, near the mountain &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Butler, J.R.A.  |author2=Marshall, B. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1996|title=Resource Use Within the Crab-Eating Guild of the Upper Kairezi River, Zimbabwe|volume=12|pages=475–490|issn=0266-4674|issue=4|doi=10.1017/S0266467400009718|journal=Journal of Tropical Ecology|jstor=2560302}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Inyangani River Frog]] is an endangered amphibian named for the mountain. It can be found in rocky, fast-flowing streams in the montane grassland.&lt;ref&gt;Amietia inyangae {{IUCNlink|58187|IUCN 2008 Red List}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==

Iron Age ruins have been found on Little Nyangani and on a hill west of the summit, the latter better-preserved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Garlake, P.S.|year=1965|title=A guide to the antiquities of Inyanga|publisher=Historical Monuments Commission of Rhodesia|asin=B0007JZPWM}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not on the summit plateau itself.

==Nyangani in Popular Culture==
The film ''Mysteries of Mount Inyangani'' looks at some of the mysteries and myths about the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video| people = Ingrid Sinclair, Joel Phiri| title = Mysteries of Mount Inyangani| url = http://www.africanmedia.msu.edu/php/showfilm.php?id=24181| medium = | publisher = | location = Zimbabwe| date = 1999| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720004955/http://www.africanmedia.msu.edu/php/showfilm.php?id=24181| archivedate = 2011-07-20| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Values close to zero (-0.1 to 0.1) generally correspond to barren areas of rock, sand, or snow.

The '''normalized difference vegetation index''' ('''NDVI''') is a simple graphical indicator that can be used to analyze [[remote sensing]] measurements, typically, but not necessarily, from a [[artificial satellite|space platform]], and assess whether the target being observed contains live green vegetation or not.

The exploration of outer space started in earnest with the launch of [[Sputnik 1]] by the [[Soviet Union]] on 4 October 1957. This was the first man-made [[satellite]] orbiting the [[Earth]]. Subsequent successful launches, both in the Soviet Union (e.g., the Sputnik and [[Cosmos (satellite)|Cosmos]] programs), and in the U.S. (e.g., the [[Explorer program]]), quickly led to the design and operation of dedicated [[Weather satellite|meteorological satellites]]. These are orbiting platforms embarking instruments specially designed to observe the Earth's atmosphere and surface with a view to improve [[weather forecasting]]. Starting in 1960, the [[TIROS]] series of satellites embarked television cameras and radiometers. This was later (1964 onwards) followed by the [[Nimbus program|Nimbus]] satellites and the family of [[Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer]] instruments on board the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) platforms. The latter measures the reflectance of the planet in red and near-infrared bands, as well as in the thermal infrared. In parallel, NASA developed the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS), which became the precursor to the [[Landsat program]]. These early sensors had minimal spectral resolution, but tended to include bands in the red and near-infrared, which are useful to distinguish vegetation and clouds, amongst other targets.

With the launch of the first ERTS satellite – which was soon to be renamed [[Landsat 1]] – on July 23, 1972 with its MultiSpectral Scanner (MSS) NASA funded a number of investigations to determine its capabilities for Earth remote sensing.  One of those early studies was directed toward examining the spring vegetation green-up and subsequent summer and fall dry-down (the so-called “vernal advancement and retrogradation”) throughout the north to south expanse of the [[Great Plains]] region of the central U.S.  This region covered a wide range of latitudes from the southern tip of [[Texas]] to the U.S.-Canada border, which resulted in a wide range of solar zenith angles at the time of the satellite observations.

The researchers for this Great Plains study (PhD student Donald Deering and his advisor Dr. Robert Hass) found that their ability to correlate, or quantify, the biophysical characteristics of the rangeland vegetation of this region from the satellite spectral signals was confounded by these differences in solar zenith angle across this strong latitudinal gradient.  With the assistance of a resident mathematician (Dr. John Schell), they studied solutions to this dilemma and subsequently developed the ratio of the difference of the red and infrared radiances over their sum as a means to adjust for or “normalize” the effects of the solar zenith angle.  Originally, they called this ratio the “Vegetation Index” (and another variant, the square-root transformation of the difference-sum ratio, the “Transformed Vegetation Index”); but as several other remote sensing researchers were identifying the simple red/infrared ratio and other spectral ratios as the “vegetation index,” they eventually began to identify the difference/sum ratio formulation as the normalized difference vegetation index.  The earliest reported use of NDVI in the Great Plains study was in 1973 by Rouse et al.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, J.W, Haas, R.H., Scheel, J.A., and Deering, D.W. (1974) 'Monitoring Vegetation Systems in the Great Plains with ERTS.' ''Proceedings, 3rd Earth Resource Technology Satellite (ERTS) Symposium'', vol. 1, p. 48-62. https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19740022592.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (Dr. John Rouse was the Director of the Remote Sensing Center of [[Texas A&amp;M University]] where the Great Plains study was conducted).  However, they were preceded in formulating a normalized difference spectral index by Kriegler et al. in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Kriegler, F.J., Malila, W.A., Nalepka, R.F., and Richardson, W. (1969) 'Preprocessing transformations and their effects on multispectral recognition.' ''Proceedings of the Sixth International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment,'' p. 97-131.&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after the launch of ERTS-1 (Landsat-1), Compton Tucker of NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] produced a series of early scientific journal articles describing uses of the NDVI.

Thus, NDVI was one of the most successful of many attempts to simply and quickly identify vegetated areas and their "condition," and it remains the most well-known and used index to detect live green plant canopies in multispectral remote sensing data. Once the feasibility to detect vegetation had been demonstrated, users tended to also use the NDVI to quantify the photosynthetic capacity of plant canopies. This, however, can be a rather more complex undertaking if not done properly, as is discussed below.

==Rationale==
[[Image:Par action spectrum.gif|thumb|Typical PAR action spectrum, shown beside absorption spectra for chlorophyll-A, chlorophyll-B, and carotenoids]]
Live green plants absorb solar radiation in the [[photosynthetically active radiation]] (PAR) spectral region, which they use as a source of energy in the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Leaf cells have also evolved to re-emit solar radiation in the near-infrared spectral region (which carries approximately half of the total incoming solar energy), because the photon energy at wavelengths longer than about 700 nanometers is too large to synthesize organic molecules. A strong absorption at these wavelengths would only result in overheating the plant and possibly damaging the tissues. Hence, live green plants appear relatively dark in the PAR and relatively bright in the near-infrared.&lt;ref&gt;Gates, David M. (1980) ''Biophysical Ecology'', Springer-Verlag, New York, 611 p.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, clouds and snow tend to be rather bright in the red (as well as other visible wavelengths) and quite dark in the near-infrared.
The pigment in plant leaves, chlorophyll, strongly absorbs visible light (from 0.4 to 0.7&amp;nbsp;µm) for use in photosynthesis. The cell structure of the leaves, on the other hand, strongly reflects near-infrared light (from 0.7 to 1.1&amp;nbsp;µm). The more leaves a plant has, the more these wavelengths of light are affected, respectively.
Since early instruments of Earth Observation, such as [[NASA]]'s ERTS and [[NOAA]]'s AVHRR, acquired data in visible and near-infrared, it was natural to exploit the strong differences in plant reflectance to determine their spatial distribution in these satellite images.

The NDVI is calculated from these individual measurements as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{NDVI}=\frac{(\mbox{NIR}-\mbox{Red})}{(\mbox{NIR}+\mbox{Red})}&lt;/math&gt;

where red and NIR stand for the spectral reflectance measurements acquired in the red (visible) and near-infrared regions, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_2.php|publisher=NASA Earth Observatory|title=Measuring Vegetation}}&lt;/ref&gt; These spectral reflectances are themselves ratios of the reflected over the incoming radiation in each spectral band individually, hence they take on values between 0.0 and 1.0. By design, the NDVI itself thus varies between -1.0 and +1.0.  It should be noted that NDVI is functionally, but not linearly, equivalent to the simple infrared/red ratio (NIR/VIS).  The advantage of NDVI over a simple infrared/red ratio is therefore generally limited to any possible linearity of its functional relationship with vegetation properties (e.g. biomass).  The simple ratio (unlike NDVI) is always positive, which may have practical advantages, but it also has a mathematically infinite range (0 to infinity), which can be a practical disadvantage as compared to NDVI.  Also in this regard, note that the VIS term in the numerator of NDVI only scales the result, thereby creating negative values. NDVI is functionally ''and linearly'' equivalent to the ratio NIR / (NIR+VIS), which ranges from 0 to 1 and is thus never negative nor limitless in range.&lt;ref&gt;Crippen, R.E. (1990)  'Calculating the vegetation index faster,'  ''Remote Sensing of Environment'', '''34''',  71-73.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the most important concept in the understanding of the NDVI algebraic formula is that, despite its name, it is a transformation of a spectral ratio (NIR/VIS), and it has no functional relationship to a spectral difference (NIR-VIS).

In general, if there is much more reflected radiation in near-infrared wavelengths than in visible wavelengths, then the vegetation in that pixel is likely to be dense and may contain some type of forest. Subsequent work has shown that the NDVI is directly related to the photosynthetic capacity and hence energy absorption of plant canopies.&lt;ref&gt;Sellers, P. J. (1985) 'Canopy reflectance, photosynthesis, and transpiration',  ''International Journal of Remote Sensing'', '''6''', 1335-1372.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myneni, R. B., F. G. Hall, P.J. Sellers, and A.L. Marshak (1995) 'The interpretation of spectral vegetation indexes', ''IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing'', '''33''', 481-486.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the index admits to go from -1 to 1, even in more densely populated [[Urban area|urban areas]] the value of normal NDVI is positive, although closer to zero. Negative values are more likely to be disturbed in the atmosphere and some specific [[Material|materials]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sistemas.uepg.br/producao/pro-reitorias/propesp/pesquisa/pibic/arquivos/bolsista/relatorio_final/relatorio/16005703@uepg.br/2017/relatorio_final.pdf|title=Urban Climate: surface temperature and NDVI an analysis of influences in Ponta Grossa-PR|last=Kubaski|first=Kauan Mateus|date=|website=|publisher=[[State University of Ponta Grossa|UEPG]] (Pro-rector of Research and Post-graduation-PROPESP)|language=pt-br|archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/72Kk9SpH6|archive-date=September 10, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=September 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance and limitations==
[[File:NDVI 2017-09-10.png|left|thumb|The surrounding fields and water bodies like the dam to the northeast help to mask with high values in [[Ponta Grossa]], [[southern Brazil]]]]
It can be seen from its mathematical definition that the NDVI of an area containing a dense vegetation canopy will tend to positive values (say 0.3 to 0.8) while clouds and snow fields will be characterized by negative values of this index. Other targets on Earth visible from space include

* free standing water (e.g., oceans, seas, lakes and rivers) which have a rather low reflectance in both spectral bands (at least away from shores) and thus result in very low positive or even slightly negative NDVI values,
* soils which generally exhibit a near-infrared spectral reflectance somewhat larger than the red, and thus tend to also generate rather small positive NDVI values (say 0.1 to 0.2).

In addition to the simplicity of the algorithm and its capacity to broadly distinguish vegetated areas from other surface types, the NDVI also has the advantage of compressing the size of the data to be manipulated by a factor 2 (or more), since it replaces the two spectral bands by a single new field (eventually coded on 8 bits instead of the 10 or more bits of the original data).

The NDVI has been widely used in applications for which it was not originally designed. Using the NDVI for quantitative assessments (as opposed to qualitative surveys as indicated above) raises a number of issues that may seriously limit the actual usefulness of this index if they are not properly addressed.{{cn|date=July 2016}} The following subsections review some of these issues.

* Mathematically, the sum and the difference of the two spectral channels contain the same information as the original data, but the difference alone (or the normalized difference) carries only part of the initial information. Whether the missing information is relevant or valuable is for the user to judge, but it is important to understand that an NDVI product carries only a fraction of the information available in the original spectral reflectance data.
*[[File:NDVI.jpg|thumb|Generated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the satellite images]]Users of NDVI have tended to estimate a large number of vegetation properties from the value of this index. Typical examples include the [[Leaf Area Index]], [[biomass]], chlorophyll concentration in leaves, plant productivity, fractional vegetation cover, accumulated rainfall, etc. Such relations are often derived by correlating space-derived NDVI values with ground-measured values of these variables. This approach raises further issues related to the spatial scale associated with the measurements, as satellite sensors always measure radiation quantities for areas substantially larger than those sampled by field instruments. Furthermore, it is of course illogical to claim that all these relations hold at once, because that would imply that all of these environmental properties would be directly and unequivocally related between themselves.
* The reflectance measurements should be relative to the same area and be acquired simultaneously. This may not be easy to achieve with instruments that acquire different spectral channels through different cameras or focal planes. Mis-registration of the spectral images may lead to substantial errors and unusable results.

Also, the calculation of the NDVI value turns out to be sensitive to a number of perturbing factors including

* Atmospheric effects: The actual composition of the atmosphere (in particular with respect to water vapor and aerosols) can significantly affect the measurements made in space. Hence, the latter may be misinterpreted if these effects are not properly taken into account (as is the case when the NDVI is calculated directly on the basis of raw measurements).
* Clouds: Deep (optically thick) clouds may be quite noticeable in satellite imagery and yield characteristic NDVI values that ease their screening. However, thin clouds (such as the ubiquitous cirrus), or small clouds with typical linear dimensions smaller than the diameter of the area actually sampled by the sensors, can significantly contaminate the measurements. Similarly, cloud shadows in areas that appear clear can affect NDVI values and lead to misinterpretations.  These considerations are minimized by forming composite images from daily or near-daily images.&lt;ref&gt;Holben, B. N. (1986)'Characteristics of Maximum-Value Composite Images from Temporal AVHRR Data','' International Journal of Remote Sensing'', '''7(11)''',  1417-1434.&lt;/ref&gt;  Composite NDVI images have led to a large number of new vegetation applications where the NDVI or photosynthetic capacity varies over time.
* Soil effects: Soils tend to darken when wet, so that their reflectance is a direct function of water content. If the spectral response to moistening is not exactly the same in the two spectral bands, the NDVI of an area can appear to change as a result of soil moisture changes (precipitation or evaporation) and not because of vegetation changes.
* Anisotropic effects: All surfaces (whether natural or man-made) reflect light differently in different directions, and this form of anisotropy is generally spectrally dependent, even if the general tendency may be similar in these two spectral bands. As a result, the value of NDVI may depend on the particular anisotropy of the target and on the angular geometry of illumination and observation at the time of the measurements, and hence on the position of the target of interest within the swath of the instrument or the time of passage of the satellite over the site. This is particularly crucial in analyzing AVHRR data since the orbit of the NOAA platforms tended to drift in time. At the same time, the use of composite NDVI images minimizes these considerations and has led to global time series NDVI data sets spanning more than 25 years.
* Spectral effects: Since each sensor has its own characteristics and performances, in particular with respect to the position, width and shape of the spectral bands, a single formula like NDVI yields different results when applied to the measurements acquired by different instruments.

For these reasons, the NDVI should be used with great caution. In any quantitative application that necessitates a given level of accuracy, all the perturbing factors that could result in errors or uncertainties of that order of magnitude should be explicitly taken into account; this may require extensive processing based on ancillary data and other sources of information.  More recent versions of NDVI datasets have attempted to account for these complicating factors through processing.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

A number of derivatives and alternatives to NDVI have been proposed in the scientific literature to address these limitations, including the Perpendicular Vegetation Index,&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, A. J. and C. L. Wiegand (1977) 'Distinguishing vegetation from soil background information', ''Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing'', '''43''', 1541-1552.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index]],&lt;ref&gt;Huete, A. R. (1988)'A soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI)', ''Remote Sensing of Environment'', '''25''', 53-70.&lt;/ref&gt; the Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Y. J. and D. Tanre (1992) 'Atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI) for EOS-MODIS', in  'Proc. IEEE Int. Geosci. and Remote Sensing Symp. '92'', IEEE, New York, 261-270.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Global Environment Monitoring Index.&lt;ref&gt;Pinty, B. and M. M. Verstraete (1992) 'GEMI: A non-linear index to monitor global vegetation from satellites', ''Vegetatio'', '''101''', 15-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these attempted to include intrinsic correction(s) for one or more perturbing factors. It is not until the mid-1990s, however, that a new generation of algorithms were proposed to estimate directly the biogeophysical variables of interest (e.g., the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation or [[FAPAR]]), taking advantage of the enhanced performance and characteristics of modern sensors (in particular their multispectral and multiangular capabilities) to take all the perturbing factors into account.  In spite of many possible perturbing factors upon the NDVI, it remains a valuable quantitative vegetation monitoring tool when the photosynthetic capacity of the land surface needs to be studied at the appropriate spatial scale for various phenomena.

The '''Pale of Calais''' ({{lang-fr|le Calaisis}}) was a historical region in [[France]] that was controlled by the [[List of English monarchs|monarchs of England]] following the [[Battle of Crécy]] in 1346 and the subsequent [[Siege of Calais (1346-47)|siege]]. ''Pale'' is an archaic English term for "area, jurisdiction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Oxford American Dictionary |chapter = Pale (noun) | edition=3rd |date=2013}}&lt;br&gt;See also: The [[English Pale]] in Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt; The capture by the English is the subject of [[Auguste Rodin]]'s 1889 sculpture ''[[The Burghers of Calais]]''. In 1558, the expanding Kingdom of France took the Pale of Calais in the aftermath of the [[Siege of Calais (1558)|Siege of Calais]].

The region was represented in the [[Parliament of England]] by two members sitting for the [[Calais (constituency)| Calais constituency]].

==History==
[[File:Quart de noble d'or sous Édouard III frappé à Calais.jpg|thumb|left|Gold quarter [[Noble (English coin)|noble]] of Edward III minted in Calais between 1361 and 1369.]]

Calais fell after the [[Battle of Crécy]] in 1346 to [[Edward III of England]] following a [[Siege of Calais (1346-47)|desperate siege]]. Its seizure gave him a defensible outpost where his army could regroup, and the city's position on the [[English Channel]] meant that, once it was taken, it could be resupplied easily by sea. Its retention was confirmed under the [[Treaty of Brétigny]], signed on 8 May 1360, when Edward [[English claims to the French throne|renounced the throne of France]], in return for substantial lands in France, namely [[Aquitaine]] and the area around Calais.&lt;ref name="HALFisher"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fisher |first=H.A.L. | authorlink = H. A. L. Fisher | title=A History of Europe |publisher=Edward Arnold &amp; Co |year=1936 |location=Great Britain |pages=322 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1453, at the end of the [[Hundred Years' War]], it was the only part of mainland France to remain in English hands. It was used as a base for English expeditions operating against France such as in 1492 when [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] oversaw an attempt to [[Siege of Boulogne (1492)|capture Boulogne]].

While it was possible to resupply and defend Calais easily by sea, in the absence of any natural defence it depended on fortifications built up and maintained at some expense. However, its main defence had been that both the French and the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundians]] coveted the city, but each preferred to see it under the English rather than their rival. Changing political circumstances with the division of [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian interests in the Low Countries]] between France and Spain meant that, in 1550 when England surrendered the area around [[Boulogne]],&lt;ref name="Sandeman"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sandeman |first=George Amelius Crawshay |title=Calais under English Rule |pages=114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tgrJjQlYYc0C&amp;pg=PA114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] had [[Sieges of Boulogne (1544–1546)|taken in 1544]], the approaches to Calais were opened.

The Pale of Calais remained controlled by England until lost by [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] to France in 1558 when, following secret preparations, 30,000 French troops, led by [[Francis, Duke of Guise]], [[Siege of Calais (1558)|took the town of Calais]]. Its loss was recognised under the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis (1559). In England there was shock and disbelief at the loss of this final Continental territory.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The chronicler [[Raphael Holinshead]] reported that a few months later Mary, on her death bed, told her family: "When I am dead and opened, you shall find 'Calais' lying in my heart".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bentley |first1=James |year=1991 |title=The Gateway to France |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JH4iAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22shall+find+calais+lying+in+my+heart%22+holinshead&amp;dq=%22shall+find+calais+lying+in+my+heart%22+holinshead&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y |location=London |publisher=Viking |page=10 |isbn=0670832065 |access-date=26 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the loss of the Pale of Calais was not as severe on the English economy as might have been expected, as by this time England was focusing its trade on the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hunt |first=Jocelyn |title=The Renaissance |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |location=New York |pages=97 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lI8G8i3rJLIC&amp;pg=PA97 |isbn=0-203-98177-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the English rule, the people of the Pale of Calais retained their identity as [[French language|French]] and [[Flemish language|Flemish]] speakers.&lt;ref name="Dumitrescu"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dumitrescu |first=Theodor |title=The early Tudor court and international musical relations |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited |year=2007 |location=England |pages=53 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fKu21vh_bWkC&amp;pg=PA53 |isbn=978-0-7546-5542-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The area of the Pale of Calais comprised the communes of [[Andres, Pas-de-Calais|Andres]], [[Balinghem]], [[Bonningues-lès-Calais]], [[Calais]], [[Campagne-lès-Guines]], [[Coquelles]], [[Coulogne]], [[Fréthun]], [[Guemps]], [[Guînes]], [[Hames-Boucres]], [[Hervelinghen]], [[Marck, Pas-de-Calais|Marck]], [[Nielles-lès-Calais]], [[Nouvelle-Église]], [[Offekerque]], [[Oye-Plage]], [[Peuplingues]], [[Pihen-lès-Guînes]], [[Sangatte]], Saint-Pierre (Calais absorbed Saint-Pierre-lès-Calais inhabited with {{val|33290}} inhabitants in 1885, now southern part of Calais), [[Saint-Tricat]], and [[Vieille-Église]].

The area of the Pale of Calais is difficult to define because the boundaries were not clearly defined, due to swampy land and artificial waterways,&lt;ref name="Darian-Smith"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Darian-Smith |first=Eve |title=Bridging divides: the Channel Tunnel and English legal identity in the new Europe |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |pages=77 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOSetgkNhzMC&amp;pg=PA77 |isbn=0-520-21610-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were constantly changing, but extended from [[Gravelines]] almost to [[Wissant]] and covered about {{convert|20|sqmi|km2}}.&lt;ref name="Sandeman"/&gt; Furthermore, the French were continually reclaiming small pieces of the territory, particularly in the southwest.&lt;ref name="Sandeman"/&gt;

Much of the area of the Pale consisted of wetlands, and the territory was roughly divided into highlands in the west and lower country in the east.&lt;ref name="Sandeman"/&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Outremont, Quebec]] (now part of [[Montreal]]), he received a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture (B.Sc.A.) in 1936 and a Ph.D. in Science in 1939 from the [[University of Geneva]]. From 1939 until 1942 he worked at the [[Jardin botanique de Montréal|Montreal Botanical Garden]]. From 1943 until 1950 he taught at the [[Université de Montréal]]. From 1950 until 1955 he worked at the [[University of Michigan]] Botanical Gardens. From 1955 until 1961 he worked in the Faculty of Science and as the director of the Botanical Institute at the Université de Montréal. In 1961 he returned to the [[United States]] as the assistant director of the [[New York Botanical Garden]] and as a professor of botany and geography at the [[Columbia University]]. From 1972 until 1976 he was the Director of the Research Centre for Sciences and the Environment at the [[Université du Québec à Montréal]] (UQAM). In 1988 he was made a Professor Emeritus at UQAM, but he still worked there after mandatory retirement (in 1976, at 65 years old) to year 2004, aged 93.

He was the subject of a 2001 documentary ''An Ecology of Hope'' by his cousin, Quebec filmmaker [[Fernand Dansereau]].&lt;ref name="NFB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/An_Ecology_of_Hope|title=An Ecology of Hope|last=Dansereau|first=Fernand|year=2001|work=NFB.ca |publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, 2011, Pierre Dansereau died, one week before his 100th birthday, after 76 years of marriage, and three months after his wife (a painter) became a centenarian — they had no children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://necrologie.cyberpresse.ca/resultatrecherche.php?nodef=2710570 |title=Dansereau, Pierre (obituary notice) |publisher=La Presse (Montréal) |date=October 1, 2011 |accessdate=October 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205113432/http://necrologie.cyberpresse.ca/resultatrecherche.php?nodef=2710570 |archivedate=December 5, 2011 |df= }} (French)&lt;/ref&gt;

UQAM's Complexe des sciences Pierre-Dansereau was named for him.

'''Plesetsk Cosmodrome''' ({{lang-rus|Космодро́м «Плесе́цк»|r=Kosmodróm "Plesétsk"|p=kəsmɐˈdrom plʲɪˈsʲet͡sk}}) is a Russian [[spaceport]] located in [[Mirny, Arkhangelsk Oblast]], about 800&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Moscow]] and approximately 200&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Arkhangelsk]], dates from 1957. Originally developed as an [[ICBM]] site for the [[R-7 (missile)|R-7]] missile, it also served for numerous [[satellite]] launches using the R-7 and other rockets. Its high [[latitude]] makes it useful only for certain types of launches, especially the [[Molniya orbit]]s, so for much of the site's history it functioned as a secondary location, with most orbital launches taking place from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome|Baikonur]], in the [[Kazakh SSR|Kazakh]] [[Soviet Socialist Republic|SSR]]. With the [[fall of the Soviet Union|end of the Soviet Union]], Baikonur became foreign territory, and Kazakhstan charged $115 million usage fees annually. Consequently, Plesetsk has seen considerably more activity since the 2000s.

== Overview ==

Plesetsk ({{Coord|62|55|32.32|N|40|34|40.36|E||display=}}) is used especially for [[military satellite]]s placed into high inclination and polar orbits since the range for falling debris is clear to the north which is largely uninhabited Arctic and polar terrain. It is situated in a region of [[taiga]], or flat terrain with boreal pine forests.

The [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz rocket]], [[Cosmos-3M]], [[Rockot]], [[Tsyklon]], and [[Angara (rocket family)|Angara]]&lt;ref name=sfn-20140709 /&gt; are launched from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. The heavy [[Proton rocket|Proton]] and [[Zenit rocket|Zenit]] rockets can only be land-launched from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome|Baikonur]] (Zenit may also be launched at sea).

== History ==

[[Image:ZATO Mirniy Kosmodrom Plesetsk location.png|thumb|ZATO Mirny, Arkhangelsk Oblast]]

Plesetsk Cosmodrome was originally developed by the [[Soviet Union]] as a launch site for [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s under the leadership and supervision of lieutenant general [[Galaktion Alpaidze]]. On 11 January 1957 the [[USSR|Soviet]] government passed the resolution about the foundation of special military object with secret name "Angara". This secret object had to be situated in [[Plesetsky District|Plesetsk District]], Arkhangelsk Oblast. It was named after the town of [[Plesetsk]]. The first Soviet Combat formation of intercontinental ballistic missiles [[R-7 (missile)|R-7]] of general designer [[Sergei Korolev]] had to be located in that place, in thick northern [[taiga]] to the south of Arkhangelsk. The official birthday of the proving ground was 15 July 1957. That day Colonel Gregorjev assumed his post as the missile unit commander. By 15 July 1961, four missile complexes for R-7 ICBMs were at combat status.

In January 1963, a joint decision of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the [[USSR Council of Ministers]] created the "Research Proving Ground missile and space weapons USSR Ministry of Defense" near the Ilez railway station, [[Belsky District]] of Arkhangelsk Oblast. In the summer of 1963, the leadership of the state is decided on the use of launch facilities in Plesetsk for launching spacecraft. In September 1963 the Council of Ministers of the USSR 3rd ALM and NIIP converted to "53 minutes Research Proving Ground." Three test management, employees of combat duty, tests of rocket and space complexes, holding and processing of telemetry and trajectory measurements. And from 1964 on the basis of rocket connection started the establishment of research proving ground missiles and space weapons. Such conversion were the favorable geographical location and a significant number of systems already deployed by the end of 1964 were on duty, four launchers R-7A, seven PU P-16U and three PU R-9A. Since then, the landfill has developed in two directions: rocket and space.

[[Image:Plesetsk satellite assembling facilities.JPG|thumb|[[Orbiter]] processing facilities near [[Mirny, Arkhangelsk Oblast|Mirny]]]]
17 March 1966 was the space birthday of Plesetsk. That day was the first missile launching of the rocket booster [[Vostok (rocket family)|Vostok]] with space vehicle [[Kosmos 112|Cosmos 112]]. Since that time the rocket base "Angara" has become cosmodrome Plesetsk. Construction started in 1957 and it was declared operational for [[R-7 rocket]]s in December 1959. The urban-type settlement of [[Plesetsk]] in Arkhangelsk Oblast had a railway station, essential for the transport of missile components. A new town for the support of the facility was named [[Mirny, Arkhangelsk Oblast|Mirny]], Russian for "peaceful". By 1997, more than 1,500 launches to space had been made from the site, more than for any other launch facility, although the usage has declined significantly since the breakup of the Soviet Union.

Because Plesetsk was used primarily for military launches, especially Zenit photoreconnaissance satellites, which were launched in large numbers during the 1970s-80s, the USSR did not admit to its existence, but it was discovered by British physics teacher [[Geoffrey Perry]] and his students at [[Kettering Grammar School]], who carefully analyzed the orbit of the Cosmos 112 satellite in 1966 and deduced it had not been launched from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]]. [[Meteor (satellite)|Meteor 1-2]] satellite launch from Plesetsk on 6 October 1969 was one of the earliest launches observed and photographed from [[Finland]]. After the end of the [[Cold War]] it was learned that the [[CIA]] had begun to suspect the existence of an [[ICBM]] launch site at Plesetsk in the late 1950s. The Soviet Union did not officially admit the existence of Plesetsk Cosmodrome until 1983.

The use of the cosmodrome will likely increase in the future since there are concerns with security in operating the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in now-independent [[Kazakhstan]], which also demands rent for its continued use. Plesetsk is not ideally suited for low inclination or geostationary launches because of its high latitude of 62 degrees north (as compared to the [[Guiana Space Centre]] at 5° north or the [[Kennedy Space Center]] at 28° 31′ north). In addition, the high latitude means that lift capacity for boosters launched from Plesetsk is slightly lower than Baikonur launches. By the 2000s, Russia had completely phased out military launches from Baikonur.

The new all-Russian [[Angara (rocket)|Angara]] rocket was designed to be launched primarily from Plesetsk (and also eventually from the [[Vostochny Cosmodrome]]).&lt;ref name=sfn-20140709&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1407/09angara/ |title=First Angara rocket launched on suborbital test flight |author=Stephen Clark |publisher=Spaceflight Now |date=9 July 2014 |accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, a new ICBM, called the [[RS-24 (ICBM)|RS-24]] has been tested and launched there, and is seen as eventually replacing the aging RS-18/[[UR-100N]]s (SS-19 Stiletto) and RS-20/[[R-36M]]s (SS-18 Satan) that are the backbone of Russia's missile forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,276014,00.html|title=Russia Test-Launches New Intercontinental Ballistic Missile|publisher=Fox | date=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, [[Russian Aerospace Defence Forces|Space Forces]] spokesman Colonel Alexei Zolotukhin said Russia will spend over 5 billion rubles ($170m) on the development and expansion of the cosmodrome in 2011. This includes the reconstruction of a local motorway and modernizing the energy supply system. New facilities will be built, including a dormitory and hospital.&lt;ref name=rn-20110907&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20110907/166507393.html |title=Russia to sink $170 mln into Plesetsk space center |newspaper=RIA Novosti |date=7 September 2011 |accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6640">'''Resection''' is a method for determining an unknown position (position finding) measuring angles with respect to known positions. Measurements can be made with a [[compass]] and [[topographic map]] (or [[nautical chart]]),&lt;ref&gt;Mooers Jr., Robert L., ''Finding Your Way In The Outdoors'', Outdoor Life Press (1972), {{ISBN|0-943822-41-6}}, pp. 129&amp;ndash;134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kals, W.S., ''Practical Navigation'', New York: Doubleday &amp; Co. (1972), {{ISBN|0-385-00246-7}}, pp. 43&amp;ndash;49&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodolite]] or with a [[total station]] using known points of a [[Geodetic network]] or landmarks of a map.

==Resection versus intersection==
Resection and its related method, ''intersection'', are used in [[surveying]] as well as in general land navigation (including inshore marine navigation using shore-based landmarks). Both methods involve taking [[azimuth]]s or [[bearing (navigation)|bearings]] to two or more objects, then drawing ''lines of position'' along those recorded bearings or azimuths.

When intersecting lines of position are used to fix the position of an unmapped feature or point by fixing its position relative to two (or more) mapped or known points, the method is known as ''intersection''.&lt;ref&gt;Mooers, pp. 129&amp;ndash;132&lt;/ref&gt; At each known point (hill, lighthouse, etc.), the navigator measures the bearing to the same unmapped target, drawing a line on the map from each known position to the target. The target is located where the lines intersect on the map. In earlier times, the ''intersection'' method was used by forest agencies and others using specialized [[Osborne Fire Finder|alidades]] to plot the (unknown) location of an observed forest fire from two or more mapped (known) locations, such as forest fire observer towers.&lt;ref&gt;Mooers, pp. 130&amp;ndash;131&lt;/ref&gt;

The reverse of the ''intersection'' technique is appropriately termed ''resection''. Resection simply reverses the intersection process by using ''crossed back bearings'', where the navigator's position is the unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Mooers, p. 132&amp;ndash;133&lt;/ref&gt; Two or more bearings to mapped, known points are taken; their resultant lines of position drawn from those points to where they intersect will reveal the navigator's location.&lt;ref&gt;Mooers, p. 132&amp;ndash;133&lt;/ref&gt;

==In navigation==
{{broader|Position fixing}}
When resecting or fixing a position, the geometric strength (angular disparity) of the mapped points affects the precision and accuracy of the outcome. Accuracy increases as the angle between the two position lines approaches 90 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Seidman, David, and Cleveland, Paul, ''The Essential Wilderness Navigator'', Ragged Mountain Press (2001), {{ISBN|0-07-136110-3}}, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetic bearings are observed on the ground from the point under location to two or more features shown on a map of the area.&lt;ref&gt;Mooers, pp. 129&amp;ndash;134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kals, pp. 43&amp;ndash;49&lt;/ref&gt; Lines of reverse bearings, or ''lines of position'', are then drawn on the map from the known features; two and more lines provide the resection point (the navigator's location).&lt;ref&gt;Mooers, pp. 129&amp;ndash;134&lt;/ref&gt; When three or more lines of position are utilized, the method is often popularly (though erroneously) referred to as [[triangulation]] (in precise terms, using three or more lines of position is still correctly called ''resection'', as angular [[law of tangents]] ([[cotangent|cot]]) calculations are not performed).&lt;ref&gt;Touche, Fred, ''Wilderness Navigation Handbook'', Fred Touche (2004), {{ISBN|978-0-9732527-0-5}}, {{ISBN|0-9732527-0-7}}, pp. 60&amp;ndash;67&lt;/ref&gt; When using a map and compass to perform resection, it is important to allow for the difference between the magnetic bearings observed and grid north (or true north) bearings ([[magnetic north|magnetic declination]]) of the map or chart.&lt;ref&gt;Mooers, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Resection continues to be employed in land and inshore navigation today, as it is a simple and quick method requiring only an inexpensive magnetic compass and map/chart.&lt;ref&gt;Mooers, pp. 129&amp;ndash;134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kals, pp. 43&amp;ndash;49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Touche, pp. 60&amp;ndash;67&lt;/ref&gt;

==In surveying==
{{distinguish-redirect|Resection (surveying)|Free stationing}}
{{see also|Triangulation (surveying)}}

In surveying work,&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of the Mapping Sciences, American Society of Civil Engineers, page 451. [https://books.google.com.br/books?id=jPVxSDzVRP0C&amp;lpg=PA451&amp;ots=n6eSezdwrn&amp;dq=Cassini's%20resection&amp;pg=PA450#v=onepage&amp;q=resection&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; the most common methods of computing the [[coordinate]]s of a point by (angular) resection are [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Cassini's]] Method and the [[Tienstra formula]], though the first known solution was given by [[Willebrord Snellius]] (see [[Snellius–Pothenot problem]]). For the type of precision work involved in surveying, the unmapped point is located by measuring the angles subtended by lines of sight from it to a minimum of three mapped (coordinated) points. In [[geodesy|geodetic]] operations the observations are adjusted for [[spherical excess]] and [[projection variation]]s. Precise angular measurements between lines from the point under location using [[theodolite]]s provides more accurate results, with trig beacons erected on high points and hills to enable quick and unambiguous sights to known points.
When planning to perform a resection, the surveyor must first plot the locations of the known points along with the approximate unknown point of observation. If all points, including the unknown point, lie close to a circle that can be placed on all four points, then there is no solution or the high risk of an erroneous solution. This is known as observing on the "danger circle". The poor solution stems from the property of a chord subtending equal angles to any other point on the circle.

[[Image:Sønderjylland.png|thumb|right|Southern Jutland today]]

'''Southern Jutland''' ({{lang-da|Sønderjylland}}) is the name for the region south of the [[Kongeå]] in [[Jutland]], [[Denmark]] and north of the [[Eider (river)]] in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Germany]]. The region north of the Kongeå is called [[Nørrejylland]] (''Northern Jutland''). Both territories had their own [[Thing (assembly)|ting]] assemblies in the [[Middle Ages]] (in [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] and [[Urnehoved]]). Southern Jutland is mentioned for the first time in the [[Knýtlinga saga]]. 

In the 13th century South Jutland became a [[duchy]]. The first [[duke]] was [[Canute Lavard]] (''Knud Lavard''). In the late 14th century it took the name of the [[Duchy of Schleswig]]. The duchy was named after the city of [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]] (''Slesvig''). The dukes of Schleswig also became kings of Denmark.

With the demise of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the 19th century, the term "Sønderjylland" was revived by Denmark and became the subject of a [[Geographical renaming#Naming disputes|naming dispute]] between Danes and Germans (the latter continuing the centuries-old "[[Schleswig]]") - part of the struggle over possession of the territory itself, which came to war in [[First Schleswig War|1848]] and again in [[Second Schleswig War| 1864]]. 

Following the [[Schleswig Plebiscites]] in 1920, South Jutland was divided into [[Northern Schleswig|Northern]] and [[Southern Schleswig]]. Northern Schleswig was also known as [[South Jutland County]] (1970–2006) and is now part of the [[Region of Southern Denmark]]. Southern Schleswig is a part of the German [[States of Germany|federal state]] [[Schleswig-Holstein]].

Both parts cooperate today as a [[Euroregion]] called [[Region_Sønderjylland–Schleswig|Sønderjylland–Schleswig]], which covers most of Southern Jutland.

The '''Strait of Bonifacio''' ({{lang-lat|Fretum Gallicum}}, {{lang-fr|Bouches de Bonifacio}}, {{lang-it|Bocche di Bonifacio}}, {{lang-co|Bucchi di Bunifaziu}}, [[Gallurese language|Gallurese]]: ''Bocchi di Bunifaciu'', {{lang-sc|Buccas de Bonifatziu}}, {{lang-lij|Bocche de Bunifazziu}}) is the [[strait]] between [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]], named after the Corsican town [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio]]. It is {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}}  wide &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.esa.int/esaEO/SEM7FTZ57NG_index_0.html |title= European Space Agency  Observing the Earth |work=web page |publisher= European Space Agency |accessdate =4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and divides the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] from the western [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The strait is notorious among [[sailor]]s for its [[weather]], [[ocean current|currents]], [[shoal]]s, and other obstacles.

The most famous disaster in the Strait of Bonifacio was that of the [[France|French]] [[frigate]] ''[[French frigate Sémillante (1841)|Sémillante]]'' on February 15, 1855. ''Sémillante'' had left the port of [[Toulon]] the day before on its way into the [[Black Sea]] to supply the [[Crimean War]] with troops. A storm caused it to hit a reef; the ship sank and none of the 750 soldiers on board survived.

After a [[tanker (ship)|tanker]] disaster in 1993, the passage through the Strait of Bonifacio has been prohibited for French and Italian flag ships with [[dangerous goods]]. Passage for ships with dangerous goods sailing under other flags is strongly discouraged and subject to mandatory piloting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iucn.org/about/union/secretariat/offices/iucnmed/iucn_med_programme/marine_programme/governance/glossary/?11352 |title=The Strait of Bonifacio: a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) |accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imo.org/blast/blastDataHelper.asp?data_id=23312&amp;filename=A766(18).pdf |title=IMO Resolution A.666(18) Navigation in the Strait of Bonifacio |accessdate=18 June 2013 |work=PDF document}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1139">[[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] have a very varied [[toponymy]] due the different settlement patterns, political and linguistic histories. In addition to the old and modern varieties of English, Scottish and Irish Gaelic and Welsh, many other languages and cultures have influenced geographical names including Anglo-Normans, Anglo Saxons, Romans and Vikings. Ultimately, most of the toponyms derive from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[North Germanic languages|North]] and [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] and [[Italic languages|Italic]] (including [[Romance languages|Romance]]) branches of the [[Indo-European language family]], although there is evidence of some [[Pre-Indo-European languages]].

The different toponymy in different parts of the United Kingdom and Ireland are discussed in the following articles:

* [[English toponymy]]
* [[Irish toponymy]] covers the whole island of Ireland as the two political entities have only been separate since 1921.
* [[Scottish toponymy]]

The '''Wutach Gorge''' ({{lang-de|Wutachschlucht}}) is a narrow, steep-sided valley in southern [[Germany]] through in the upper reaches of the [[River Wutach]] with three [[gorge]]-like sections, the lowest of which is also called the ''Wutachflühen''. The gorge cuts through the southern part of the [[Baar region]] from the eastern side of the [[High Black Forest]] heading eastwards to the ''[[Albtrauf|Trauf]]'' the steep, northwestern flank of the [[Swabian Jura]], which transitions to the [[Randen mountains]] here.

The 60- to 170-metre-deep gorges stretch for over 33 river kilometres (excluding side gorges) and are notable for many reasons. Their geologically young, [[Prototype theory|prototypical]] and actively continuing development results in a great variety of [[geotope]]s and [[biotope]]s that support a correspondingly rich range of flora and fauna. The gorges are very popular with tourists and played an important role in the establishment of [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]] consciousness in southwestern Germany. The Wutach Gorge is part of the [[Southern Black Forest Nature Park]].

== Course and character ==
[[File:Wutach w-o-GeoSchnitt.jpg|thumb|500px|Section of the South German Scarplands along the Wutach]]
The ravines start in the valley of the ''Gutach'' (the upper reaches of the Wutach) below [[Titisee-Neustadt|Neustadt]] and in the valley of the ''Haslach'' below [[Lenzkirch]]. After they merge to form the ''Wutach'' they run, with small changes of direction, initially generally eastward and end at the village of Grimmelshofen in the municipality of [[Stühlingen]] after the Wutach turns sharply southwards in the area of the former mining town of [[Blumberg]] on meeting the steep slopes of the ''Baaralb''. Initially, the gorge is bordered by the wooded plateaus of the eastern slopes of the Black Forest. Later, its northern border is formed by the historical ''Bertholdsbaar'' with the population centre of [[Löffingen]] and the village of [[Rötenbach (Friedenweiler)|Rötenbach]]. To the south is a similar [[muschelkalk]] plateau with the settlements of [[Bonndorf]] and [[Wutach (municipality)|Wutach]].

Over a [[straight-line distance]] of barely 20 kilometres, the Wutach and several of its tributaries have cut a natural profile section through almost all of the strata of [[South German Scarplands]], which fan out a further 200 kilometres to the north, but surface here in close succession. The [[Mesozoic]] rock layers were clearly inclined more steeply than usual here (on average 7%) by the uplifting of the southern Black Forest and have been cut through here in succession by the Wutach. Because the Wutach "only" descends through a gradient of around 1% as it flows eastward, increasingly younger rocks are encountered, each overlaid over its predecessor, as one progresses down the gorge. This has created a continuous sequence of rock outcrops from the [[basement (geology)|basement]] (here mostly [[granite]]) through the [[Triassic]] to the [[Jurassic]]. As these rocks each produce their own peculiar and very different landforms when they are cut by [[erosion (geology)|vertical erosion]], one of the most diversified and most interesting gorge landscapes in Central Europe has resulted. The gorges often transition seamlessly into wide valleys where it is hard to imagine that steep ravines are so nearby.

Not only do the gorges themselves form their own [[natural region]]s, but the plateaux across which they cut have also been given the status of independent natural regional units. So the Central Wutach Region (''Mittlere Wutachgebiet'') lies between the natural regions of the [[Baar region|Baar]] to the north and the Klettgau Hills (''Klettgauer Hügelland'') to the south, both of which are similar in terms of their bedrock. The region is also a bridge between the mountains of the [[Black Forest]] and the [[Swabian Jura]].

== Gorge system of the Wutach and its tributaries ==

=== Upper gorge in the basement rock ===
[[File:Wutach fg1.jpg|thumb|Trackless section of the Upper Gorge in the basement rock]]
[[File:Rinnsal1b.jpg|thumb|Waterfall in the lower Lotenbach Gorge]]
At the exit of the wide bottomed valleys of the Gutach and the Haslach from the eastern Black Forest, which were heavily shaped by the [[ice age]], the streams often cut through narrow gorges as the gradient increases suddenly. In the granite that initially dominates, dark, trackless ravines alternate with short sections where the valley broadens out. The rocky sides of the valley also have naturally high proportion of conifers. Downstream, in the area of the less resistant beds of bunter sandstone, spectacular gorge scenery is absent. The side gorges of this upper section of the main gorge are narrow; several would be impassible without man-made paths being laid through them.

The gorge of the main headstream, the Gutach, begins with a noticeably increased gradient just above the Gutach Bridge (built 1900) on the [[Höllental Railway (Black Forest)|Höllental Railway]], whose stone arches support a span of 64 metres, then the longest in Germany. The deepest point of the Haslach Gorge, which joins from the right, is the ''Rechenfelsen'', a short [[ravine]] that is a good 20 metres deep. The Rötenbach Gorge, which merges from the left soon thereafter, culminates in a waterfall with two cascades and a total height of 6 metres. Below the few remains of [[Stallegg Castle]] the Wutach is quietened by a small reservoir belonging to the Stallegg Electricity Works and built in 1895. Shortly afterwards the stream passes the covered, wooden Stallegg Bridge, on the old path between the Fürstenberg estates on either side of the gorge. At point where it is joined by the Reichenbach Gorge the river forces itself through the granite ''[[schrofen]]'' of the trackless Stallegg Gorge (''Stallegger Schlucht''). It ends at the ''Räuberschlössle'' rocks with their ruined castle, the [[New Blumberg Castle|New Blumberg]] (also ''New Blumegg''). The rocks lie north of the Wutach and are quartz [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] formation up to 80 metres high that are also called the ''Nägelefels'' due to the presence of [[Cheddar Pink]]s. Near the mill of [[Schattenmühle]] and the road crossing the Lotenbach Gorge (''Lotenbachklamm'') joins from the right, a granite gorge with four waterfalls up to 8 metres high, as well as a tributary stream that plunges 20 metres into the river.

=== Valley from Dietfurt and Bad Boll ===
[[File:Wutachschlucht.jpg|thumb|left|The Wutach Gorge near Reiselfingen. Here: a wide V-shaped valley]]
As the river enters the Lower and Middle [[Muschelkalk]] rock, the typical Black Forest landscape ends. The limestones, which have been heavily deformed and made slippery by the [[leaching (pedology)|leaching]] of [[gypsum]] deposits, have given rise to a slightly wider [[V-shaped valley]] with a great diversity of habitats and constantly changing local relief. For example, extensive [[tufa]] formations rise above the footpath on the sunny slopes of the ''Schelmenhalde'' with its wide, plunging waterfall, whilst, opposite, a Muschelkalk formation called the ''Drei Zinnen'' ("Three Battlements"), which was once perforated by cavities and has now collapsed, slips downstream on slippery masses of Middle Muschelkalk towards the Wutach. Deciduous forest communities now dominate, although occasional meadows interrupt the [[riparian woodland]].

Further down the valley, initially on the upper slopes, elongated rock faces made of Upper Muschelkalk strata are typical, especially the roughly one-kilometre-long ''Rappenfelsen'' on the left above the subsiding subsoil. This is where the ''Gaisloch'', which has collapsed to create an open gorge, joins the main valley. Below it, the oldest and very steep gorge crossing led over the river by the former mill at the Dietfurt; there was a bridge in here in 1614-1632. The centre of the valley was the historic ''Badhof'' near the Fritz Hockenjos Footbridge; an avenue and the remains of the park have survived.. On a rocky spur above it, [[New Tannegg Castle]] (built by about 1200) had to be abandoned before 1500, because it had partially collapsed down the precipitous cliff. Immediately below the Boller Waterfall cascades for 40 metres in two stages into the Wutach from the right. This is the highest waterfall in the Wutach Gorge and was, when [[Bad Boll (Bonndorf)|Bad Boll]] was still a [[spa resort]], lit up at night. Today it is almost impossible to get to. At the ''Felsenweiher'', an old [[backwater (river)|backwater]] below a rock face of the Upper Muschelkalk, the Tannegg Waterfall (named after the ruins of Old Tannegg Castle) tumbles 15 metres over a bizarre tufa formation. Roughly opposite is the ''Münzloch'', the longest cave of the Wutach Gorge, 84 metres in length.

=== Middle gorge in main Muschelkalk ===
[[File:Wutachschlucht (mittl).jpg|thumb|[[Muschelkalk]] rock face (the ''Amselfelsen'') in the central gorge]]
Further downstream, as soon as the Muschelkalk rock faces reach the valley bottom, the [[canyon]]-like second gorge section begins. It was the earliest part of the gorge to be developed and remains the most interesting part of the gorge for tourists today. Here the Wutach swings from one rock face to another on its broad gravel bed, sometimes undercutting the rock, which is left overhanging and is up to about 80&amp;nbsp;metres high.

The Ludwig Neumann Way (''Ludwig-Neumann-Weg'') is one of the most elaborate trail systems maintained by the [[Black Forest Club]] and, after almost all the bridges in the original network were destroyed by floods, is exposed but protected by the rock faces. At the very beginning it crosses the ''Amselfels'' rock, nearly 70&amp;nbsp;metres high, with views of the ''Großer Kanzelfels'' ("Great Pulpit Rock") to the north. Parts of its right-hand pulpit collapsed in 1983 about 80&amp;nbsp;metres into the Wutach. The following long, partly overhanging, rock refuge, ''Engländerfels'' was named in memory of an Englishman who fell to his death here in 1906. The ''Forellenfelsen'' also recalls the early English fashion of travelling to the Black Forest for "fishing holidays" in the Wutach Gorge. The central rest stop in the middle gorge is in a spot where the valley widens and is called the Schurhammer Hut. In the following section, the Wutach sinks largely into crevices in the muschelkalk rocks and re-emerges after 1.3 kilometres at the foot of an overhanging section of the rock face. In 1953, the cavern-like Old Wutach [[Ponor|portal]] by the old ''Rümmelesteg'' footbridge collapsed; leaving half the suspension bridge anchored to the rock. The ''Josefsfelsen'' rocks with their crowning rock pinnacle and the ''Josefssteg'' footbridge commemorate another victim of a fall in 1907. The end of the middle gorge is marked by the covered Canadian Bridge (''Kanadiersteg''), which was built in 1976 by Canadian engineers. It runs from mouth of the Gauchach to the high mountain spur on the southern side with its old [[spur castle]], the [[Hörnle Castle|Hörnle]].

=== Achdorf valley in the Keuper and Lower Jurassic ===
After the Gauchach Gorge joins the main artery from the north, the valley widens again and is open, accessible and populated. At the first road bridge is the ''Wutachmühle'' with its sawmill and kiosk. The almost undeveloped valley sides with their rugged, sometimes bizarre relief, leave one to conjecture at the almost continual slip and creep processes of the few remaining solid formations of [[Keuper]] rock. Four of the nine villages that once existed in this so-called ''Achdorfer Tal'' (Achdorf Valley ) have fallen victim to the unstable subsoil and been [[abandoned village|abandoned]]. Clearly visible are three large landslides: the Eschach Slip (''Eschacher Bergsturz'') on the eastern precipice of the ''Scheffheu'' (1880, 1940 and 1966), the 1966 landslide at Eichberg with its resulting waterfall and the 1976 landslide on repeatedly closed ''Wellblechsträßle'' at the foot of the ''Buchberg''. The larger villages of Aselfingen and Achdorf lie at the mouths of the Aubach valley (with its Mundelfingen Waterfall and ruins of ''Hardegg'') and Krottenbach valley. To the east, prominent mountain landforms of the ''Eichberg'' (913.6&amp;nbsp;metres) and the ''Buchberg'' (879.9 metres) tower above the valley; between them the upper Aitrach valley ends 170 metres above the Wutach valley seemingly in mid-air, forming the Blumberg Gate (''Blumberger Pforte''). Below the former castle of Blumberg the Schleifebach Falls cascade into the valley (4, 9 and 5 metres high).

=== Lower Gorge (''Wutachflühen'') in the Main Muschelkalk ===
[[File:GrimFluehen Tafelberg.JPG|thumb|left|The left gorge face of the ''Flühen'']]
After turning sharply at the prominent Wutach Knee (''Wutachknie'') the Wutach crosses and important [[fault (geology)|fault line]], south of which the Upper Muschelkalk, which descends deeply, accompanies the upper valley slopes once more in the form of rock faces. In this third gorge, the ''Flühen'' ([[Alemannic dialects|Alemannic]]: rock faces), the dimensions of the gorge and its rock faces reach their greatest extent. Here lies the heavily fissured Swabian Jura with its highest precipice, the ''Walenhalde''(350&amp;nbsp;m). The ''Flühen'' are, however, exhibit less variety and were did not become a tourist attraction until the opening of the [[Wutach Valley Railway]], which crosses over them.

The narrow valley begins with the little Letterngraben Waterfall on the right hand side of the valley and with waterfalls in the ''Sackpfeiferdobel'' and ''Sturzdobel'' (15&amp;nbsp;metres, tufa crags) on the left hand side. The actual ''Wutachflühen'' are a 3-kilometre-long, up to 85-metre-high rock wall in the left hand side; it is the greatest outcropping of the Upper Muschelkalk in Germany. Rock pinnacles such as the ''Lunzistein'' (also ''Brautfluh'', about 15&amp;nbsp;metres high) or the ''Mannheimer Felsen'' break out of the jagged rocks. Opposite, on a free-standing, 30-metre-high rock plateau, are the ruins of Blumegg Castle. The counterpart of the Gutach Bridge at the start of the Lower Gorge is the viaduct of the Wutach Valley Railway, which marks the lower end of the Wutach gorges.

=== Gauchach Gorge ===
[[File:Wutach fg3.jpg|thumb|[[Butterbur]] drifts in the Gauchach Gorge]]
The most important side gorge, the Gauchach Gorge, which contains the [[Gauchach]] stream, is characterised by its narrowness and its cascade-like stream bed formed in the beds of the Upper Muschelkalk. Roughly in the middle of the gorge it is joined near the old mill of ''Bergmühle'' by the rather straight, rugged ravine known as the ''Engeschlucht'' through which the ''Tränkebach'' stream runs. Together with the Gauchach and Wutach Gorge it forms the Bachheim Gorge Rectangle (''Bachheimer Schluchtenviereck''). Here, too, at low water it drains away underground to the Wutach.

After the valley broadens out below the [[Gauchach Viaduct, Döggingen|Gauchach Viaduct]] (which carries the [[Bundesstraße 31]]) the first narrow section begins near the restored and functional mill of ''Guggenmühle''. The actual gorge begins near the castle ruins of the ''Grünburg'' (wall remains measuring 15&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;12&amp;nbsp;m) and the ''Lochmühle'' mill, which was destroyed in a flood. Opposite stands the ''Grünburg Chapel'' with a [[votive offering|votive picture]] of a flood in 1804 and again in 1895. Below the ruins of the ''Neuenburg'', which is barely recognisable following a landslip, the ''Burgmühle'' Hiking Hostel run by the [[Friends of Nature]] acts as a tourist base. In the lowest part of the gorge an [[educational path]] leads past impressive [[tufa]]s and communities of [[Equisetum telmateia|giant horsetail]].

'''Yang Shoujing''' ({{zh|t=楊守敬|w='''''Yang Shou-ching'''''|hp=Yáng Shǒujìng}}; 1839 – 9 January 1915) was a late-[[Qing dynasty]] [[historical geographer]], calligrapher, [[antiquarian]], [[bibliophile]], and diplomat. He is best known for the [[historical atlas]] of China ''Lidai yudi tu'', commonly called the ''Yangtu'' ("Yang's atlas"), the most complete and scholarly historical atlas of China produced during the Qing dynasty. He devoted most of his life to the annotation of the 6th-century geographic work ''[[Shui jing zhu]]'', which was completed by his disciple [[Xiong Huizhen]] and published as the ''Shui jing zhu shu''.

As a Qing diplomat posted in Japan, Yang purchased tens of thousands of ancient Chinese books from Japanese libraries and archives, many of which had become rare or lost in China. After his death, the government of the Republic of China purchased his collection and preserved most of the books in the [[National Palace Museum]].

Yang was an accomplished calligrapher of the Stele School and became highly influential in Japan. The introduction of his art was said to have "offered virtually an unprecedented aesthetic style" to Japan and "revolutionized" [[Japanese calligraphy]]. Yang's former residence and tomb in [[Yidu]], [[Hubei]] are now protected as a [[List of Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Hubei|Major National Historical and Cultural Site]] of China.

==Biography==
[[File:楊守敬像傳.jpg|thumb|Yang Shoujing's portrait in ''Illustrated Biographies of Qing Dynasty Scholars'' ([[:zh:清代學者象傳|清代學者象傳]], 1928)]]
Yang was born in 1839, during the [[Qing dynasty]], in Lucheng Town, [[Yidu]] County, [[Hubei]] Province. His [[courtesy name]] was Xingwu (惺吾). After passing the provincial examination and earning the ''[[juren]]'' degree in 1862 (first year of the [[Tongzhi reign]]),&lt;ref name=guoxue&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guoxue.com/master/yangshoujing/yangshoujing.htm |title=Yang Shoujing |work=Guoxue |date=19 November 2005 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; he lived for ten years in [[Beijing]] trying to pass the [[imperial examination]] for the highest ''[[jinshi]]'' degree, without success.{{sfnp|Brown|2012|p=72}} Although he failed the examinations, he became friends with the prominent officials [[Pan Zuyin]] and [[Zhang Zhidong]], who shared his passion for antiques. He attended Pan's lavish parties and shopped for antiques in Beijing's [[Liulichang]] with Zhang.{{sfnp|Brown|2012|p=72}}

From a young age Yang was interested in [[geography]], and spent much of his life annotating [[Li Daoyuan]]'s 6th-century work ''[[Commentary on the Water Classic]]'' (''Shui Jing Zhu'').{{sfnp|Brown|2012|p=73}} His knowledge in geography earned him a diplomatic post to Japan, despite his repeated examination failure.{{sfnp|Brown|2012|p=72}} In Tokyo he worked under the career diplomat Li Shuchang, an abrasive superior who nevertheless appreciated Yang's knowledge in antiques.{{sfnp|Brown|2012|p=73}} As Japan was quickly westernizing during the [[Meiji Restoration]], traditional Chinese publications fell out of fashion and were sold cheaply.{{sfnp|Brown|2012|p=74–75}} Working with Li as well as Japanese antiquarians, Yang purchased tens of thousands of old Chinese books preserved in Japanese collections, many of which had become rare or even lost in China.{{sfnp|Brown|2012|p=73}} They were later published as ''Guyi congshu'' (古逸丛书).{{sfnp|Brown|2012|p=73}} After Yang's death, the Republic of China government purchased his collection and preserved most of his books in the [[National Palace Museum]].{{sfnp|National Palace Museum|1966|p=98}}

Yang was posted in Japan from 1880 to 1884. After returning to China, he taught at the {{ill|Lianghu Academy|zh|两湖书院}} in [[Wuchang]] and then became dean of the Qincheng School (勤成学堂), later renamed as Cungu School (存古学堂). In 1909 he served as an advisory official of the [[Ministry of Rites]]. He died in Beijing on 9 January 1915, and was buried in his hometown Yidu.&lt;ref name=guoxue/&gt;

==Annotation of the ''Commentary on the Water Classic''==
Yang devoted most of his lifetime to the annotation of the ''[[Commentary on the Water Classic]]'' (''Shui jing zhu''). He wrote 40 volumes of annotation but died before completing the work. His disciple [[Xiong Huizhen]] carried on the project and wrote another 40 volumes of annotation. It was published in the 1950s as the ''Shui jing zhu shu'' (水經註疏).{{sfnp|Yeh|2000|p=35}} The influential historian [[Gu Jiegang]] remarked that the work "brought to a point of culmination the textual research of ''The Classic of Waterways'' of the previous three centuries." He greatly admired the authors' "single-minded devotion" to the task, and Xiong's devotion to his master.{{sfnp|Yeh|2000|p=35}}

==Historical atlas of China==
Another of Yang's important works is the ''Lidai yudi tu'' (歷代輿地圖), his historical atlas of China which is often simply called the ''Yangtu'' (Yang's atlas). Yang began the work in 1866 with the assistance of Deng Yongxiu, and was joined by Rao Dunzhi in the late 1870s. They plotted historical geographical data on a Qing dynasty map,  but left out non-Han Chinese kingdoms such as [[Nanzhao]] and [[Dali Kingdom|Dali]]. Published between 1906 and 1911, it was the most complete and scholarly historical atlas of China produced during the Qing dynasty.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2015|p=246}} Based on Yang's atlas, historian [[Tan Qixiang]] compiled ''[[The Historical Atlas of China]]'', which was published in the 1980s and is considered the most authoritative atlas of Chinese history ever published.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2015|p=245}}

==Calligraphy==
[[File:Yang Shoujing calligraphy 鎸勒.jpg|thumb|upright|Yang Shoujing's calligraphy (1903)]]
With the encouragement of [[Pan Zuyin]], Yang became an accomplished calligrapher of the Stele School of [[Chinese calligraphy]].{{sfnp|Brown|2012|p=82}} When he went to Japan, he introduced the style to Japanese calligraphers, offering them "virtually an unprecedented aesthetic style" and revolutionizing [[Japanese calligraphy]].{{sfnp|Brown|2012|p=82}} He was considered a talented artist by famous Japanese calligraphers such as Miyajima Seiichiro, Kusakabe Meikaku, Iwaya Osamu, and Matsuda Sekka. {{ill|Iwaya Osamu|ja|巌谷一六}} and others bought hundreds of sheets of Yang's works.{{sfnp|Brown|2012|p=81}} Yang wrote many essays on the Stele School of calligraphy, which were published by Japanese scholars in two volumes, ''Ping bei ji'' (評碑記, "Record of stelae criticism") and ''Ping tie ji'' (評帖記, "Record of model-letters criticism").{{sfnp|Brown|2012|p=82}}

==Memorials==
In September 1986, the government of Yidu city repaired Yang Shoujing's tomb and former residence, which was turned into the Yang Shoujing Museum. His residence and tomb are now protected as a [[List of Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Hubei|Major National Historical and Cultural Site]] of China (designation 6-995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guoxue.com/master/yangshoujing/ysj03.htm |title=在宜都追忆学者杨守敬 |work=Hubei Daily |language=zh |date=14 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
