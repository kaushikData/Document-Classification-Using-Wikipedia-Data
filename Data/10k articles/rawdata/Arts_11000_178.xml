'''Alexander Demetrius Goltz''' (25 January 1857, [[Püspökladány]] - 14 May 1944, [[Vienna]]) was a Hungarian-born Austrian painter, illustrator and scenic designer.

== Biography ==
He was the son of a railway engineer and, after the age of two, grew up in Vienna. From 1874 to 1875, he studied with [[Otto Seitz]] at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]]. Then, for the next two years, he was a student of [[Anselm Feuerbach]] at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna]].&lt;ref name="O"&gt;{{ÖBL|2|29||Goltz Alexander Demetrius|}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first exhibition was in 1876 and he became a member of the [[Vienna Künstlerhaus]].

This was followed by several study trips, a stay in Munich from 1884 to 1888, and studies with [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]] in Paris. He finally returned to Vienna in 1892.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;Reinhard Müller: [http://agso.uni-graz.at/marienthal/biografien/goltz_alexander_demetrius.htm ''Alexander Demetrius Goltz'']. In: ''Die Arbeitslosen von Marienthal'', Juni 2008; retrieved, 18 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning as a history painter, he later turned to landscapes and portraits. From 1904 to 1907, he was in charge of the scenic equipment at the [[Burgtheater]], then held the same position at the [[Vienna State Opera]] from 1909 to 1910.&lt;ref name="O" /&gt; During this time, he painted the portraits of numerous performers; notably [[Josef Kainz]].

He was a member of the [[Hagenbund]] from 1900 to 1911 and served as its President for the year 1906/07. During the First World War, he served as a [[battle painter]] for the Imperial {{ill|Kriegspressequartier|de|k.u.k. Kriegspressequartier}} and worked at the fronts in Belgium, Russia, Italy, Serbia and Turkey. Most of these paintings are now on display at the [[Museum of Military History, Vienna|Museum of Military History]].

From 1925 to 1929, he was President of the Artists' Cooperative at the Künstlerhaus. He was married twice. His second wife (who he married in 1909) was the actress Mary Mell (1885-1954), sister of the writer, {{ill|Max Mell|de}}. In 1927, he became a citizen of Vienna and is buried at the [[Zentralfriedhof]].&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

'''Artur Grottger''' (11 November 1837 – 13 December 1867) was a [[Poles|Polish]] [[Romanticism in Poland|Romantic painter]] and [[graphic artist]], one of the most prominent artists of the mid 19th century under the [[History of Poland (1795–1918)|foreign partitions of Poland]], despite a life cut short by incurable illness.&lt;ref name="pinakoteka-bio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pinakoteka.zascianek.pl/Grottger/Grottger_bio.htm | title=Artur Grottger.

==Biography==
Grottger was born in Ottyniowice, [[Eastern Galicia]] (now Otynevychi, Ukraine) to Jan Józef Grottger, a Polish officer commanding the [[Uhlan|Uhlans' Regiment]] called ''Warszawskie Dzieci'' (the Warsaw Children) during the failed [[November Uprising]] against the Russians (1831); an amateur artist himself, with many areas of passion.&lt;ref name="lwow" /&gt; 
[[File:Artur Grottger, Portret własny.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Self-portrait, 1867]]

At age 11, Artur Grottger was sent from a quiet estate to study painting in [[Lwów]] under the apprenticeship of [[Jan Maszkowski|Jan Kanty Maszkowski]] (1848–1852), (together with [[Stanisław Tarnowski (Biały)|Stanisław Tarnowski]])&lt;ref&gt;„Polski Słownik Biograficzny”, Vol. XX (Maria Józefa – Mathy Ignacy), ed. Polska Akademia Nauk, print. Zakład Narodowy im. Ossolińskich, Wroclaw-Warsaw-Cracow-Danzig, 1975, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; and (briefly) [[Juliusz Kossak]]. In 1852 he embarked on a journey to [[Kraków]] (then in the [[Austrian Partition]]) to attend classes at the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts]]. He studied under [[Władysław Łuszczkiewicz]] and [[Wojciech Stattler|Wojciech Kornel Stattler]]. In 1855–1858 he went to the Academy in [[Vienna]] and studied under [[Karl von Blaas]] and [[Christian Ruben]]. While in Austria, he travelled to Munich, Venice and to Hungary, where he met his biggest future sponsor and benefactor, Count [[Aleksander Pappenheim]]. He returned to Poland in 1865 upon the collapse of the [[January Uprising]].&lt;ref name="pinakoteka-bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lwow"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lwow.home.pl/naszdziennik/grottger.html | title=Artur Grottger - wielki polski artysta (Artur Grottger - a great Polish artist) | publisher=''Nasz Dziennik'', Lwow.pl | work=Wielcy zapomniani | accessdate=October 21, 2012 | author=Piotr Czartoryski-Sziler | language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time, Grottger moved between the estates of Polish art lovers in [[Podolia]], among others in Manor House of [[Stanisław Tarnowski (Biały)|Stanisław Tarnowski]] in Śniatynka, there he painted numerous paintings for the cycle ''Lithuania''. &lt;ref&gt;Zofia Gołubiew, Anna Król „Artur Grottger (1837-1867)”, (Wystawa przygotowana przez Muzeum Narodowego w Krakowie w Pałacu Sztuki Towarzystwa Przyjaciół Sztuk Pięknych w Krakowie marzec – maj 1988, pod patronatem Ministra Kultury i Sztuki Prof. Aleksandra Krawczuka) Muzeum Narodowe w Krakowie, Cracow, 1988, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866 he met his fiancée Wanda Monné, a young Polish patriot; and spent a lot of time at her house. However, he also developed tuberculosis. In 1867 he went to Paris hoping to make more money; visited [[Hôtel Lambert]], and met with [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]. His illness was getting worse and worse. He went to a sanatorium at [[Amélie-les-Bains-Palalda]] in the [[Pyrénées]], where he died on 13 December 1867. His body was brought back to Poland by his fiancée and buried at the [[Lychakiv Cemetery|Lwów Cemetery]] on 4 July 1868.&lt;ref name="lwow" /&gt;

==Artistic career==
Grottger painted mostly epic battle scenes, portraits, and horses. He produced some of his most famous paintings while in Vienna. During his stay in occupied Poland, he poured all of his talent and energy into depicting the hopes and horrors of the failed Polish insurrections in several series of black-and-while pannels including ''Warszawa'', ''Polonia'', ''Lithuania'' and ''Wojna'' (1863–1867) which brought him no income. The series titled "Polonia" included eight boards, depicting the grim realities of everyday life and struggle under Russian occupation. "Polonia" was a response to the failed insurrection of 1863–65. His last painting was his self-portrait.

In 1908, [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], whose own father had been caught up in the insurrection and had been arrested, completed his ''magnum opus'', the [[Symphony in B minor (Paderewski)|Symphony in B minor "Polonia]], which was inspired by Grottger's series of paintings.

'''Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance''', also referred to as '''BAAD!''', is a New York performing and visual art workshop space and performance venue located in [[The Bronx]].&lt;ref name="spacefinder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyc.spacefinder.org/organizations/4107|title=BAAD ! the Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance - SpaceFinder NYC|publisher=nyc.spacefinder.org|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy is home to the Arthur Aviles Typical Theatre and The Bronx Dance Coalition.

== History ==
The Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance was co-founded in 1998 by [[Arthur Aviles]], dancer and choreographer who performed with the [[Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company]], and Charles Rice-Gonzales, a writer, activist, and publicist.&lt;ref name="nycartscoalition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nycartscoalition.org/|title=NYC Arts Coalition|publisher=nycartscoalition.org|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nydailynews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/dominican-dance-traditions-alive-special-performance-hostos-community-college-article-1.952236|title=Hostos features Dominican traditional dance - NY Daily News|publisher=nydailynews.com|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy was first located in a community center before renting space in the historic [[American Bank Note Company Printing Plant]] in the [[Hunts Point, Bronx|Hunts Point]] neighborhood of the [[South Bronx]] and was home to the Arthur Aviles Typical Theatre, a contemporary dance company focusing on works exploring the margins of Latino and LGBTQ cultures.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/28/nyregion/in-new-home-bronx-dance-academy-seeks-to-step-up-its-presence.html?_r=2&lt;/ref&gt; The programs at BAAD! were made up of dancers, LGBTQ visual artists, women, and artists of color.&lt;ref name="baadbronx"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baadbronx.org/about.html|title=About|publisher=baadbronx.org|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists began presenting work in the space and hosting annual arts festivals such as ''BAAD! Ass Women'', ''Out Like That!'', ''The BlakTino Performance Series'', ''The Boogie Down Dance Series'', and the holiday play ''Los Nutcrackers: A Christmas Carajo''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/arts-festival-hunts-point-celebrates-women-film-dance-poetry-theater-self-defense-workshop-article-1.1037673&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a film event series, titled ''Get Tough! Get BAAD!'' focusing on gay-bashings in New York City, was added.&lt;ref name="baadbronx"/&gt; ''Out Like That!'' is the Bronx's only festival celebrating works by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender artists.&lt;ref name="nyc-arts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc-arts.org/organizations/2181/bronx-academy-of-arts-and-dance|title=Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance - NYC-ARTS|publisher=nyc-arts.org|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the Bronx Dance Coalition, which supports professional Bronx dance and published the ''Bronx Dance Magazine'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pepatian.org/public_html/pdf/back_issue_05.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was formed at the Academy. Later the Muse/Artist in Residency Project was started.

After 14 years in the American Bank Note Company Building, the Academy was forced to leave due to increasing rent. In October 2013, the Academy relocated to a gothic revivalist chapel in the cemetery on the grounds of the historic [[St. Peter's Church, Chapel and Cemetery Complex|St. Peter's Episcopal Church]] in [[Westchester Square, Bronx|Westchester Square]].&lt;ref name="cuny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brie.hunter.cuny.edu/hpe/2013/10/28/legendary-dance-group-gone-from-banknote/|title=Hunts Point Express &amp;#8211; Legendary dance group gone from BankNote|publisher=brie.hunter.cuny.edu|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapel that houses the Academy was made a [[List of New York City Designated Landmarks in The Bronx|New York City Landmark]] in 1976 and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://npgallery.nps.gov/nrhp/Download?path=/natreg/docs/All_Data.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 [[The New York Times]] crowned BAAD! "a funky and welcoming performance space" and Theater Journal said, "they have created a space for art in an environment that seems antithetical to that act. The Academy received the Mayor's Art and Culture Award.&lt;ref name="harlemonestop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harlemonestop.com/organization/1385/bronx-academy-of-arts-dance-baad|title=Bronx Academy of Arts &amp; Dance (BAAD!), Other - Harlem One Stop|publisher=harlemonestop.com|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 they were one of 12 grantees to receive a grant from the Lincoln Center Cultural Innovation Fund and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] in order to &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lincolncenterculturalinnovationfund.org/|title=Lincoln Center Cultural Innovation Fund|website=Lincoln Center Cultural Innovation Fund|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "increase arts access and participation in the diverse neighborhoods of the [[South Bronx]] and [[Central Brooklyn]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thebronxchronicle.com/2017/06/28/recipients-from-central-brooklyn-and-south-bronx-receive-support-for-innovative-community-based-cultural-programs/|title=Recipients From Central Brooklyn and South Bronx Receive Support For Innovative Community-Based Cultural Programs - The Bronx Chronicle|date=2017-06-28|work=The Bronx Chronicle|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 60K grant will be used for the Transvisionaries:Live Performance Series, a monthly free performance series featuring trans and [[gender non-conforming]] artists or color, hosted at local cafes in the South Bronx. The goal being to increase access to performance outside the theater while bringing visibility to [[Transgender|trans people]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Chanson réaliste'' was a musical style that was mainly performed by women;&lt;ref name=POPULAR/&gt;&lt;ref name=CHANTEUSE&gt;Conway, Kelly (2004). ''Chanteuse in the City: The Realist Singer in French Film''. University of California Press. p. 6. {{ISBN|0-520-24407-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt; some of the more commonly known performers of the genre include [[Édith Piaf]] and [[Fréhel]].

==Origins and influences==

''Chanson réaliste'' grew out of the [[Café-chantant|''cafés-concerts'']] and [[cabarets]] of the [[Montmartre]] district of [[Paris]] during the 1880s.&lt;ref name=VICTORY/&gt;&lt;ref name="SPHINX"/&gt;  Home to such theatrical landmarks as the [[Moulin Rouge]], and [[Le Chat Noir]], Montmartre became a centre for [[hedonism|hedonistic]] and brazen entertainment from the late 19th century to the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=MUDD&gt;Gendron, Bernard (2002). ''Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-garde'', University of Chicago Press. pp. 36 &amp; 53. {{ISBN|0-226-28735-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''chanson réaliste'' was a musical genre dominated by female vocalists, one of its earliest performers—and credited by some as "the creator" or "the father" of genre&lt;ref name=CHANTEUSE/&gt;&lt;ref name=SATIE&gt;Moore Whiting, Steven (1999). ''Satie the Bohemian: From Cabaret to Concert Hall'', Oxford University Press. p. 20. {{ISBN|0-19-816458-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GERMANY&gt;Robb, David (2007). ''Protest Song in East and West Germany Since the 1960s'', Boydell &amp; Brewer. p. 36. {{ISBN|1-57113-281-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;—was cabaret singer and comedian [[Aristide Bruant]].  Bruant began a career at [[Le Chat Noir]] in 1885 and his [[Vaudeville (song)|vaudeville]]-inspired mix of song, satire and entertainment became very popular with the [[bourgeoisie]] [[slum tourism|slumming]] in the poorer Montmartre district.&lt;ref name=THEATRE/&gt;&lt;ref name=GERMANY/&gt;&lt;ref name=BOHEMIANS&gt;Wilson, Elizabeth (2003). ''Bohemians: The Glamorous Outcasts'', Tauris Parke Paperbacks. p 224. {{ISBN|1-86064-782-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  His compositions were also different in that they included the everyday language and slang used by the commoners.&lt;ref name=VICTORY/&gt;

Borrowing elements of the ''[[comédie en vaudeville]]'', the ''chanteuses réalistes'' (realist singers [female]) often wore black dresses, red lipstick and white face makeup—their faces highlighted with stark lighting, set against a modest, almost bare backdrop—all done to draw audiences' attention to the singers' emotive facial expressions.&lt;ref name=POPULAR/&gt;

In contrast to the picturesque ''[[Chanson#Chansons today|chanson]]'' which was popular in [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|post-World War II France]]—with its songs of love, cobbled Parisian streets, and the sound of the accordion—the ''chanteuses réalistes'' sang songs of loss, hopelessness and abandonment;&lt;ref name=POPULAR/&gt; their songs dealt with life in the poorer Parisian [[faubourgs]], and the thugs, [[pimp]]s, [[prostitute]]s, and [[orphan]]s who called them home;&lt;ref name=VICTORY/&gt;&lt;ref name=POPULAR/&gt; its themes of [[poverty]] and the [[Organized crime|criminal underworld]], as well as its sociopolitical commentary, were influenced by the works of such [[Literary realism|literary realists]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalist]] writers as [[Émile Zola]], [[Jean Richepin]] and [[Paul Bourget]].&lt;ref name=THEATRE/&gt;&lt;ref name=BOHEMIANS/&gt;

==The performers==

The ''chanson réaliste'' sentimentalised the plight of poor and dispossessed women, such as prostitutes, waitresses, failed singers in cheap bars, orphans, single mothers and the like. Some of the performers of the genre were also known to have lived the part—both Édith Piaf and Fréhel sang in the streets as children, were teenage mothers and lost their children very young—and many shortened their lives with [[Drug abuse|drugs]], [[Alcohol abuse|alcohol]] and [[illness]]: [[Yvonne George]] lived an excessive lifestyle and died at the age of 34; Fréhel became an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] at an early age, attempted [[suicide]] at 19 and eventually died in poverty; Piaf suffered from [[Substance dependence|addictions]] to [[morphine]] and alcohol and died of [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=POPULAR/&gt;&lt;ref name=SPHINX/&gt;

However, given the dramatic and melancholy aspects of ''chanson réaliste'', the withered and diseased aspect of their appearance became an integral part of the show.&lt;ref name=POPULAR/&gt;  Piaf, for example, was known for her [[waif]]-like stage presence and became tightly identified with her role;&lt;ref name=TECHNO&gt;Cannon, Steve &amp; Dauncey, Hugh (2003).

{{Quote|I don't like realist songs...For me they're vulgar tunes with blokes wearing cloth caps and girls plying their trade on the streets.  I hate that.  I like flowers and simple love stories, health, ''[[joie de vivre]]'' and Paris.|Édith Piaf|}}

Another common theme of the ''chanson réaliste'' was [[motherhood]], particularly the mother-son relationship; such songs were a speciality of the singer Berthe Sylva, whose songs dealt with such topics as dying mothers, mothers worrying about their sons at war, sons placing flowers on a mother's grave, and songs about the mundane experiences of a bored [[homemaker|housewife]].&lt;ref name=POPULAR/&gt;

Other women known for performing in the ''chanson réaliste'' style include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25051">'''Craftivism''' is a form of [[activism]], typically incorporating elements of [[anti-capitalism]], [[environmentalism]], solidarity, or [[third-wave feminism]], that is centered on practices of [[craft]] - or what can traditionally be referred to as "domestic arts". Craftivism includes, but is not limited to, various forms of needlework including yarn-bombing or cross-stitch. Craftivism is a social process of collective empowerment, action, expression and negotiation. In craftivism, engaging in the social, performative and critical discourse around the work is central to its production and dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, Ele. "Activist Tendencies in Craft". http://research.gold.ac.uk/3109/, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners are known as '''craftivists'''.

== Background ==
The term '''craftivism''' was coined in 2003 by writer Betsy Greer in order to join the separate spheres of craft and activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greer|2008|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Craftivism, Arnolfini, Bristol |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/craftivism-arnolfini-bristol-1855855.html |first=Charles |last=Darwent |date=3 January 2010 |location=London |work=The Independent}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Her favorite self-created definition of the term states, "craftivism is a way of looking at life where voicing opinions through creativity makes your voice stronger, your compassion deeper &amp; your quest for justice more infinite"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Crafting a Green World. What is Craftivism? Division over the Definition Explodes Etsy Team |url=http://craftingagreenworld.com/2009/04/04/what-is-craftivism-division-over-the-definition-explodes-an-etsy-team/ |work=Crafting a Green World |first=Julie |last=Finn |date=April 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term craftivism is a recent addition to crafting lexicon, the use of craft as a subversive tactic can be found throughout history. First, the word craft is often associated with trickery. To call someone crafty is to identify them as clever and cunning &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratich|2006|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek, one would say to "spin" a plot. Similarly, the French word for trick is tricoter, which means to tie or knot together.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratich|2006|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', the character [[Madame Defarge]], a worker for the [[French Revolution]], secretly encodes the names of those soon to be executed in her knitting.

=== Feminism ===
Craftivism identifies strongly with feminist movements. Craftivism is often interpreted as having emerged from [[third-wave feminism]] but feminist activism and craft were unified beforehand.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bratich|first1=Jack|last2=Bush|first2=Heidi|title=Fabricating Activism: Craft Work, Popular Culture, Gender|journal=Project Muse|date=2011|volume=22|issue=2|url=https://www.academia.edu/1117424/Fabricating_Activism_Craft-Work_Popular_Culture_Gender|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practices of craft or "domestic arts" have traditionally existed and been organized spatially within the private sphere. Therefore, the labor and production of craft was generally interpreted as unproductive female labor in the home, as it was never integrated into profit-making systems. Rather, it was [[marginalized]] and undervalued.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratich|2006|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, women's significant and creative work in the private sphere—clothing the family, knitting blankets, weaving the loom—did not receive the same respect as male-dominated activity in the public realm. Furthermore, the patriarchy has been successful in claiming these domestic values for women and using it as a way to keep women in subservient roles.&lt;ref name="Sabella"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sabella |first=Jennifer |date=May 12, 2008 |title= Craftivism: Is crafting the new activism? |work=The Columbia Chronicle |location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of consumer-friendly crafts, including kits, transfers and readymade designs, has further diminished the status of craft and women's amateur practices.&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Hackley, "Quiet Activism and the New Amateur," Design and Culture, 5:2 (2013): 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Women and craft have been excluded from the fine art world and as a result many women put their creativity towards craft practices. Craft was "a universal female art from transcending race, class, and national borders. Needlework is the one art in which women controlled the education of their daughters and the production of art, and were also the critics and audience."&lt;ref name="Packer 2010"/&gt; Although practices of craft were spatially organized within the private sphere, women occasionally would organize groups to engage in these practices collectively. In these craft circles or meet ups women would not only share patterns and skills but also engage in conversation about their lives in the private sphere. These groups of women would discuss their lives and personal struggles encountered as women. This type of group discussion is a form of activism rooted in [[Consciousness raising]] that was key to [[Second-wave feminism]]&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; as it helped to raise awareness about the types of oppression women were experiencing in their everyday lives.

The Anti Capitalist, Anti Sweatshop and DIY movements popularized practices of craft for activism. These movements influenced third-wave feminists to adopt a craftivism ethos. Most forms of craftivism identify strongly with [[third-wave feminism]]. Third-wave feminist crafters are attempting to subvert the association of craft with domesticity by embracing domestic arts while identifying as feminists who are making the choice to embrace this new domesticity. Third-wave feminists are reclaiming knitting, sewing, and other crafting activities traditionally feminized and associated with the private sphere. Through this reclamation, contemporary women aim to reconnect with the female-dominated art forms, to legitimatize the importance of undervalued craft, and to show that 21st century women have the privilege to express themselves through craft, with fewer constraints exercised by the patriarchy. This act of resistance and shattering of the public/private binary is expressed physically through public knitting and craft circles who take a private-sphere activity and insert themselves in the male-dominated spaces of the city&lt;ref name="Robertson, Kirsty 2006"&gt;Robertson, Kirsty. 30 March 2006. How to Knit an Academic Paper. Queen's University.&lt;/ref&gt; One example would be the [[Anarchist Knitting Mob]] who held a "Massive Knit" event in Washington Square Park to honour the death of activist and urbanist [[Jane Jacobs]].&lt;ref&gt;http://massiveknit.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Knitters decorated the trees, benches, and light posts with colourful yarn and unique patterns.

Retrieved 28 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism====
Women’s craft has often been undervalued or ignored in the art world. Women’s craft is considered belonging to a lesser cultural sphere and categorized under such terms as ‘applied’, ‘decorative’ or ‘lesser’ than other art forms such as painting or sculpture.&lt;ref name="Packer 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Packer|first1=Carolyn|title=The Evolution of Craft In Contemporary Feminist Art|journal=Scholarship Claremont|date=2010|url=http://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&amp;context=scripps_theses|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This critique of women’s craft and craftivism as a ‘lesser’ art form has been contested within the discourse of feminism. Some Feminist Art discourse excludes craftivism. This feminist intervention into the art world perpetuates a hierarchy of art where craft is a lower art form. Some feminists deem craftivism as reinforcing domesticity and consider it a retrogression of the feminist cause rather than a subversive tactic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raven|first1=Charlotte|title=How the 'New Feminism' Went Wrong|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/06/charlotte-raven-feminism-madonna-price|website=www.theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmentalism ===
Craftivism is also centered on ideas of environmentalism and sustainability. When buying new materials, many craftivists choose organic fabrics and fairly traded products such as home-spun yarns. Yet, even more popular within the movement is the utilization of vintage, thrifted and repurposed goods in order to minimize waste and promote reuse. This display of resourcefulness acknowledges the finite resources on Earth, and the valorization of quality over quantity. Craftivist, Betsy Greer, is quoted saying, "While I think that crafting has become something fairly elite and cliquish in some areas, at its heart, it is very much made for individuals who value both their time and their money".&lt;ref name="Sabella"/&gt;

=== Anti-capitalism ===
Historically, craft was the pre-capitalist form of production, where each created item possessed a "use-value," a term comparing the usefulness of an item to the exchange equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Vivienne |last=Brown |year=2009 |editor=Stephanie Taylor |editor2=Steve Hinchliffe |editor3=John Clarke |editor4=Simon Bromley |chapter=Rubbish society: affluence, waste and values |title=Making Social Lives |location=Milton Keynes |publisher=The Open University |page=122 |isbn=0749216417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now within a capitalist system of mass production, craft has become a commodity to be bought and sold for money, where it is now referred to as having an "exchange-value".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratich|2006|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this movement from use-value to exchange-value, there is less emphasis on the time and skill expended to create an object, and more importance on making it available to the masses as inexpensively as possible. Traditionally associated with a strong community so vital to the creation and distribution of craft, crafting has since lost its use-value and has been "captured by capital".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratich|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular way to resist the commoditization of craft is through the Do-It-Yourself or DIY movement. Popularized through "zines" of the 1990s, DIY inspires people to be self-sufficient and to rely less on the market for basic necessities that can easily be created on one's own. DIY is a resistance to both the capitalist nature of the fashion industry and pressures to conform and buy a style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Higgins |first= Charlotte |date=January 31, 2005 |title=Political protest turns to the radical art of knitting |work= The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jan/31/arts.artsnews1 |accessdate=2 November 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the Counterfeit Crochet Project, which seeks to "debase and defile designer items one step at a time".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Counterfeit Crochet Project by Stephanie Syjuco http://www.counterfeitcrochet.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Crafters have also subverted the market through the use of open source patterns and information sharing on the internet. Sites like [[Burdastyle]] allow crafters to upload and download sewing projects at no charge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.burdastyle.com&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Cat Mazza's online software [[KnitPro]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microrevolt.org/knitPro.htm&lt;/ref&gt; allows users to download images into detailed knitting patterns at no charge.

====Anti-sweatshop====
Efforts within the craftivist movement against capitalism focus primarily on the international issue of [[sweatshops]]. Some craftivists believe that either sewing one's own clothing or buying only hand-made is the best way to protest unfair labor practices around the globe. Other craftivists take the issue even further, using the act of crafting as a protest against sweatshops. Artist and activist [[Cat Mazza]] created a campaign against the inhumane labor practices of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] through the creation of a giant blanket depicting Nike's trademark swoosh. From 2003-2008, international crafters were asked to mail in 4x4 inch stitched squares to border the blanket and to sign a petition against Nike.&lt;ref&gt;Microrevolt Blanket. http://www.microrevolt.org/web/blanket.htm April 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Mazza also created a second web-based software called [[Knitoscope]] that transforms video into animated knitted stitches.&lt;ref name="turbulence.org"&gt;http://www.turbulence.org/Works/microRevolt/testimonies.html&lt;/ref&gt; Each video has a corresponding testimony featuring various professionals who work against sweatshop labor.&lt;ref name="turbulence.org"/&gt;

Artist and Activist Kirsty Robertson feels that the subversive efforts of craftivists against capitalism are limited by their dependency on the internet and new communication. She points out that for this reason, global justice knitters are not completely removed from the economy themselves &lt;ref name="Robertson, Kirsty 2006"/&gt;

===Anti-war===
Some craftivists see their art form as a protest against war and violence. Anti-war craftivists choose to make their statement by juxtaposing a colorful, soft, and fuzzy yarn with cold and dangerous weapons. In 2006, Danish artist Marianne Jorgensen stitched a giant pink "tank blanket" and placed it over a M24 Chafee combat tank to protest the Iraq war.&lt;ref name="marianneart.dk"&gt;Pink M.24 Chafee. http://www.marianneart.dk/ April 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; She has been making these blankets since Denmark entered the Iraq War, and doesn't plan to stop until it is over. She writes on her website that, "Unsimilar to a war, knitting signals home, care, closeness and time for reflection...When [the tank] is covered in pink, it becomes completely unarmed and it loses its authority".&lt;ref name="marianneart.dk"/&gt; Much like Jorgensen, Canadian artist [[Barb Hunt]] works to question the acceptance of military logic in society by creating knitted antipersonnel land mines out of wool.&lt;ref name="Robertson, Kirsty 2006"/&gt;

Similar to her campaign against Nike, Cat Mazza started an anti-war effort entitled "Stitch for Senate" on the fourth anniversary of the Iraq War. She enlisted two people from each state to knit a soldier's helmet liner which would be sent on to every senator. Unlike the apolitical Operation Home Front efforts that knitted gear for soldiers, Mazza wanted "to start a dialogue about the war and to get politicians to keep the promises they made during the midterm elections".&lt;ref name="Gohil, Neha Singh 2007"&gt;Gohil, Neha Singh. March 13, 2007. Activists use knitting needles to make their point. Columbia News Service&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Viral Knitting Project]] is an anti-war effort that translates the 0/1 binary code of the dangerous Code Red computer virus into a knitting pattern of knit/purl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirstyrobertson.com/viral%20knitting/viral%20knitting.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713153258/http://www.kirstyrobertson.com/viral%20knitting/viral%20knitting.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The color and code relate to the anti-terrorism alerts of post 9/11 United States. The project is attempting to "draw together links between technology, culture, capitalism and war".&lt;ref name="Robertson, Kirsty 2006"/&gt;

===Social justice issues===
The Craftivist Collective, founded by Sarah Corbett, is an activist social enterprise which uses craftivism to engage people in social justice issues and solidarity movements.&lt;ref name="ohcomely"&gt;Charlotte Humphery, ''We'll change the world stitch by stitch'', ''Oh Comely'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/158988814/resistance|title=Resistance by Crafterdark|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a manifesto and a checklist of goals for the work of the group which includes being welcoming,&lt;ref name="satreview"&gt;Ruth Lewy, ''I get frustrated knitting socks. I want to make a difference.'', ''The Times Saturday Review'', 10 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; encouraging and positive,&lt;ref name="positive2"&gt;Rin Simpson, ''Getting crafty: a creative approach to activism'', ''Positive News'', Winter 2012&lt;/ref&gt; creative and non-threatening,&lt;ref name="house"&gt;Holly Howe, ''Sarah Corbett'', ''House'', Autumn 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and focusing on global poverty and human rights injustices.&lt;ref name="bigissuenorth"&gt;Jameela Oberman, ''Stitch in time'', ''Big Issue in the North'', 10–16 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Craftivist Collective's key achievements was to convince the [[M&amp;S]] board to pay their 50,000 employees the living wage in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Alexi Duggins, [https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2017/sep/18/why-craftivists-are-hiding-notes-in-pockets-during-london-fashion-week ''Is there a protest message in your new jacket's pocket? You've been shop-dropped''], theguardian.com, 18 September 2017, retrieved 28 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;.
This campaign was awarded with the Economic Justice Campaigner of the year 2017 by [[Sheila McKechnie Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://smk.org.uk/oxy_testimonial/sarah-corbett-craftivism-economic-justice-award-winner-2017/ ''Sarah Corbett, Craftivism, Economic Justice Award winner 2017''], smk.org.uk, 18 August 2017, retrieved 30 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;, and was nominated for the 2017 [[Care2]] UK Impact Award. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.care2services.com/2017-uk-impact-award ''Vote now for the 2017 UK Impact Award finalists!''] care2services.com, retrieved 28 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

On the back of this award, Sarah Corbett continues to work with large charities to deliver strategic craftivism projects and teach them in the art of gentle protest.&lt;ref&gt;Kirstie Brewer [https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-42181743 ''Why I leave hidden messages in High Street clothes''], bbc.com, 1 December 2017, retrieved 30 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guerrilla Kindness ===
Australian artist Sayraphim Lothian uses craftivism to "make people's day brighter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/christchurch-life/art-and-stage/9834934/Kakapo-sculptures-hidden-in-Christchurch |title=Kakapo sculptures hidden in Christchurch |website=Stuff.co.nz |date=17 March 2014 |author=Will Harve |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She leaves small handcrafted works of art on the streets for people to find and take home  “aimed at creating tiny bubbles of joy in the lives of passersby, tiny surreal moments that might make people do a double take.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/alannaokun/people-who-use-crafting-for-activism |title=10 People Who Use Crafting For Activism |website=buzzfeed.com |date=22 April 2014 |author=Alanna Okun |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protest models ==
When craftivists take to the street, they utilize various protest models.

A popular form of protest is the "knit-in," where knitters infiltrate a public space and knit. They might ride a subway, occupy a civic building, or sit in a park. They use the knit-in to draw attention to their issue of concern. The [[Revolutionary Knitting Circle]] of Calgary, Canada stage a knit-in in front of Calgary's financial office buildings during the summit of the G-8 nations in 2002.&lt;ref name="Gohil, Neha Singh 2007"/&gt; The Knit-in not only provides an opportunity to protest against injustice, but also allows for a running discussion about social issues between the stationary knitters. Jack Bratich of [[Rutgers University]] argues that, "Knitting in public also creates a gendered question of space. It rips open the enclosure of the domestic space to public consumption, exposing productive work that has contributed to women's invisible and unpaid labor".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratich|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women are, thereby, able to gain power from an activity that previously symbolized their repression.

Craftivist [[Carrie Reichardt]] has covered her home, car and studio with mosaics which utilizes  ceramics, screen-printing and transfers to highlight "plight of inmates on death row, the Black Panthers, and the spirituality of the planet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/07/homes |title=Interiors |newspaper=The Guardian |date=6 February 2010 |author=Kate Makhail |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of craft-themed activism is guerilla art. The Texas-based group [[Knitta]] places street art such as street pole cozies and antenna warmers in cities throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Knitta homepage|url=http://www.knittaplease.com/Home.html|website=knittaplease.com|accessdate=20 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306151047/http://www.knittaplease.com/Home.html|archivedate=6 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a blogger in England, Sarah Corbett, "creates textile art with political messages in public spaces first by herself at a blog called 'a lonely craftivist' and then as the head of the worldwide Craftivist Collective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alonelycraftivist.blogspot.com/ |title=a lonely craftivist |website=alonelycraftivist.blogspot.com |date=4 October 2009 |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volunteers for [[Postcards To Voters]] often create their own hand-decorated postcards to send to potential voters ahead of elections in hopes of increasing turnout. The work can be done solo, but is often done at "postcarding parties" at a volunteer's home or a cafe.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Writing Postcards Brings Voters Back From the Edge: ‘It’s Sharpie Therapy’ |date=November 1, 2018 |last1=Tackett |first1=Michael |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/us/politics/postcards-democrats-midterm-elections.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In transition==
In the spring of 2009, an online debate began over the definition of craftivism. The debate spread after the self-titled Craftivism team on [[Etsy]] had an inner-group argument about the political affiliation of its members, causing some members to leave the group. 
The original description of the group states, "The Etsy Craftivism Team is a team of progressive Etsyans who believe that craft and art can change the world. Some of us use our work to carry messages of protest and political activism. Others believe that the act of making craft can be an act of resistance. Still others see that by buying and selling directly from the maker we are challenging the all pervasive corporate culture that promotes profit over people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://craftingagreenworld.com/2009/04/04/what-is-craftivism-division-over-the-definition-explodes-an-etsy-team/ |title=What is Craftivism? Division over the Definition Explodes an Etsy Team - Crafting a Green World |website=Craftingagreenworld.com |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conservative members accused the group of assuming a liberal agenda, and argued that politics should not be involved. Some members of the group felt that the mere act of crafting itself was political, while others felt that the act must also be attached to a political message. Rayna Fahey from Radical Cross Stitch replied to a thread stating "Personally if a John McCain supporter joined this group and told me that my latest piece in support of indigenous sovereignty was a well-made piece that serves the purpose for which it was designed well, I'd think that was awesome and I'd have hope for the future of this world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Whose Craftivism?|url=http://radicalcrossstitch.com/2009/04/06/whose-craftivism/|website=radicalcrossstitch.com|accessdate=20 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408031802/http://radicalcrossstitch.com/2009/04/06/whose-craftivism/|archivedate=8 April 2009|date=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, craftivist Betsy Greer believes that "the personal is political," and that you cannot separate the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greer|2008|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eassie Stone''' is a Class II [[Pictish stone]] of about the mid 8th century AD in the [[village]] of [[Eassie]], [[Angus, Scotland]]. The stone was found in Eassie [[burn (topography)|burn]] in the late 18th century and now resides in a purpose-built perspex building in the ruined Eassie church.

==Location==
The cross slab is housed in a purpose-built shelter with see-through walls within the roofless shell of the old Eassie parish church, {{gbmapping|NO35264745}} on the north side [[A94 road]] some {{convert|4|km|mi}} west of [[Glamis]] and {{convert|6|km|mi}} east of [[Meigle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Description ==
The stone is a cross-slab {{convert|2.04|m|ftin}} high and {{convert|1.02|m|ftin}} wide, tapering to {{convert|0.84|m|ftin}} at the top, and is {{convert|23|cm|in}} thick.&lt;ref name="Canmore"/&gt; The slab is carved on both faces in [[relief]] and, as it bears Pictish symbols, it falls into [[John Romilly Allen]] and Joseph Anderson's classification system as a class II stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The upper quadrants held a pair of angels, but have suffered some damage, the right-hand figure being almost completely lost.

The rear face of the slab bears a mixture of figural representations and Pictish symbols. At the top of the face is a damaged [[Pictish beast]] over a [[Double disc (Pictish symbol)|double disc and Z-rod]].

==History==
[[File:Eassie Stone back.JPG|thumb|right|Rear of stone, showing sculpted figures and symbols]]
The cross-slab was found in the bed of the Eassie Burn, near Eassie Church by Rev. Cordiner, c. 1786.&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt; From there it was moved to the churchyard,&lt;ref name="Warden"&gt;

  | accessdate = November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church itself was probably built in the 16th century on the site of an earlier building that was dedicated in 1246 by Bishop David of St Andrews. In 1309 it was granted to [[Newbattle Abbey]]. Although there are elements of the original, much of it seems to have been rebuilt in the late 1500s. In 1600 the parish of Eassie was combined with a neighbouring parish.  The windows and doors were altered in the 18th century. In 1835 the two churches of the parish were replaced by a single larger one serving. Since then Eassie Old Parish Church has stood derelict.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/glamis/eassiechurchstone/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Relationship with other stones==
The Eassie stone belongs to the Aberlemno School of Pictish sculpture as extended by Lloyd Laing from Ross Trench Jellicoe's original proposed list. In addition to the Eassie stone, stones in the Aberlemno School include [[Aberlemno Sculptured Stones#Aberlemno 2|Aberlemno 2]] (the Kirkyard Stone), [[Aberlemno Sculptured Stones#Aberlemno 3|Aberlemno 3]], Menmuir 1, Kirriemuir 1, [[Monifieth Sculptured Stones#Monifieth 2|Monifieth 2]], Rossie Priory, Glamis 1 and Glamis 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Eugeniu Voinescu''' (commonly '''Eugen'''; 26 May 1842, [[Iași]] &amp;ndash; 6 May 1909, [[Bucharest]]) was a Romanian diplomat and painter, who specialized in maritime scenes.

==Biography==
Following the wishes of his family, he originally studied law and literature. After spending some time studying in Athens, he went to Paris where he befriended the French artist, [[Gustave Courbet]], who stimulated his interest in painting directly from nature.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://artindex.ro/2012/05/16/voinescu-eugen-cean/ Brief biography and paintings] @ ArtIndex.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869, he was awarded a prize at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]].

As a result of his legal studies, he also served as Romanian [[consul general]] in Budapest (1879), Istanbul (1882), and [[Odessa]] (1883-1888). While in Odessa, he became acquainted with [[Ivan Aivazovsky]], who helped him develop his interest in [[Marine art|marine painting]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; In 1889, he held his first major exhibition at a salon held in the new [[Romanian Athenaeum]].

Although he was lauded as Romania's best maritime artist by [[Nicolae Iorga]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ziarulevenimentul.ro/stiri-2/Casa%20si%20gradina/eugeniu-voinescu-pictor--376715.html Biographical notes] @ Evenimentul.&lt;/ref&gt; he also painted portraits and [[Genre art|genre]] works, as well as historical and biblical scenes. An important aspect of his career is that he was financially independent, so his painting always remained a hobby, even when he participated in decorating churches, such as the Cathedral of [[Saint Charalambos]] in [[Turnu Măgurele]] and the Church of Saint Nicholas in Bucharest. He was also one of the founders of the School of Decorative Arts at the [[Bucharest National University of Arts]].

In 2011, [[Poșta Română]] issued a series of four [[commemorative stamp]]s honoring Romanian artists, and one of Voinescu's paintings was chosen for the 2.10 [[Romanian Leu|Lei]] denomination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://romfilatelia.ro/marci/colectia.php?ContentID=547&amp;Year=2011 Commemorative issue] @ Romfilatelia.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Firooz Bahram High School''' (دبیرستان فیروز بهرام) is one of [[Tehran]]'s oldest high schools still in operation.

==History==
Built in 1932, it was constructed on the property of [[Zoroastrian]]s such as ''Ardeshir Kiamanesh''. The school was named after an Iranian Zoroastrian that died in the Mediterranean in [[World War I]]. The school's establishment was supported by the then Zoroastrian representative in the [[Majles]] Keikhosro Shahrokh (کيخسرو شاهرخ).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/seventhday/story/2006/10/061020_me_firoozbahram.shtml |title=BBCPersian.com |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was not the first Zoroastrian high school in Tehran however. That credit is given to ''Jamshid Jam'' (جمشيد جم) High School built in 1906.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[Kamaloddin Jenab]], one of Iran's pioneers of [[nuclear physics]] was director of the school for a while.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharghnewspaper.com/850612/html/dannesh.htm |title=de beste bron van informatie over sh argh newspaper.

==Architecture==
The architecture of the building is clearly that of the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] era of [[Iran]].

The school is a historical landmark and cultural heritage of Tehran today.

==Origin==
Flower Power originated in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]], as a symbolic action of protest against the Vietnam War. In a November 1965 essay titled ''How to Make a March/Spectacle'', Ginsberg advocated that protesters should be provided with "masses of flowers" to hand out to policemen, press, politicians and spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg, Allen, "Demonstration or Spectacle as Example, As Communication, or How to Make a March/Spectacle", ''Berkeley Barb'', November 19, 1965, republished in ''The Portable Sixties Reader'', Ann Charles (Ed.), Penguin Classic, 2002, p.208-212 {{ISBN|978-0-14-200194-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of props like flowers, toys, flags, candy and music were meant to turn anti-war rallies into a form of [[street theater]] thereby reducing the fear, anger and threat that is inherent within protests.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Shepard,[http://www.journalofaestheticsandprotest.org/1/BenShepard/shepard2.html "Absurd Responses vs. Earnest Politics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703163847/http://www.journalofaestheticsandprotest.org/1/BenShepard/shepard2.html |date=2008-07-03 }}, ''Journal of Aesthetics and Protest'', Volume 1, Issue 2, January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, Ginsberg wanted to counter the "specter" of the [[Hells Angels]] motorcycle gang who supported the war, equated war protesters with communists and had threatened to violently disrupt planned anti-war demonstrations at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Lewis |last=Hyde | title=On the poetry of Allen Ginsberg | publisher=University of Michigan Press | date=January 1, 1985 | page=264 | ISBN=0-472-06353-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Allen | last=Ginsberg | title=Family Business: Selected Letters Between a Father and Son | chapter= |page=241 | publisher=Bloomsbury | date=September 7, 2002 | ISBN=1-58234-216-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Barry | last=Miles | title=Hippie | page=50 | publisher=Sterling  | date=August 28, 2005 | ISBN=1-4027-2873-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using Ginsberg's methods, the protest received positive attention and the use of "flower power" became an integral symbol in the counterculture movement.&lt;ref&gt;William Lawlor, ''Beat culture: lifestyles, icons, and impact'', ABC-CLIO (2005), p.126  {{ISBN|1-85109-400-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
By late 1966, the Flower Power method of [[guerilla theater]] had spread from California to other parts of the United States. The [[Bread and Puppet Theater]] in New York City staged numerous protests which included handing out balloons and flowers with their anti-war literature.&lt;ref name="Jezer"&gt;{{cite book | first=Marty | last=Jezer | title=Abbie Hoffman: American Rebel | publisher=Rutgers University Press | ISBN=978-0813520179 | page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Workshop in Nonviolence'' (WIN), a magazine published by New York activists, encouraged the use of Flower Power. In May 1967, [[Abbie Hoffman]] organized the Flower Brigade as an official contingent of a New York City parade honoring the soldiers in Vietnam. News coverage captured Flower Brigade participants, who carried flowers, flags and pink posters imprinted with LOVE, being attacked and beaten by bystanders.&lt;ref name="Jezer"/&gt; In response to the violence, Hoffman wrote in WIN magazine, "Plans are being made to mine the East River with daffodils. Dandelion chains are being wrapped around induction centers.... The cry of 'Flower Power' echoes through the land. We shall not wilt."&lt;ref name="Jezer"/&gt;

On the following Sunday in May 1967, WIN activists declared the [[Armed Forces Day]] as "Flower Power Day" and held a rally in [[Central Park]] to counter the traditional parade. Turnout was low and, according to Hoffman, the rally was ineffective because guerilla theater needed to be more confrontational.&lt;ref name="Jezer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Freid, ''The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!: Pageantry and Patriotism in Cold-War America'', Oxford University Press, (1999), p. 141, {{ISBN|0-19-513417-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1967, Hoffman and [[Jerry Rubin]] helped organize the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|March on the Pentagon]] using Flower Power concepts to create a theatrical spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;James J. Farrell, ''The Spirit of the Sixties: The Making of Postwar Radicalism'', Routledge, 1997, p.223&lt;/ref&gt; The idea included a call for marchers to attempt to levitate the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]]. When the marchers faced off against more than 2500 Army national guard troops forming a human barricade in front of the Pentagon, demonstrators held flowers and some placed flowers in the soldier's [[rifle barrel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Carlito Rivera, "The 1967 March on the Pentagon and lessons for today" , ''Socialism and Liberation Magazine'', March 2007, retrieved 26-09-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Photographs of flower-wielding protesters at the Pentagon March became seminal images of the 1960s anti-war protests. [[The Ultimate Confrontation: The Flower and the Bayonet|An image]] by French photojournalist [[Marc Riboud]] that was printed throughout the world was of seventeen-year-old high school student [[Jan Rose Kasmir]] clasping a daisy and gazing at bayonet-wielding soldiers. [[Smithsonian Magazine]] later called it "a gauzy juxtaposition of armed force and flower child innocence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Andrew | last=Curry | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Flower_Child.html | title=Flower Child | journal=[[Smithsonian Magazine]] |date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural legacy==
The iconic center of the Flower Power movement was the [[Haight-Ashbury]] district in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Ashbolt, [http://www.anzasa.arts.usyd.edu.au/a.j.a.s/Articles/2_07/Ashbolt.pdf "Go Ask Alice: Remembering the Summer of Love"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913113150/http://www.anzasa.arts.usyd.edu.au/a.j.a.s/Articles/2_07/Ashbolt.pdf |date=2009-09-13 }}, ''Australasian Journal of American Studies'', December 2007, p.35-47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;Mandalit del Barco, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11650213 "Haight-Ashbury a Flower-Power Holdover"], ''Morning Edition'', National Public Radio, July 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1960s, the area, marked by the intersection of Haight and Ashbury streets, had become a focal point for psychedelic rock music.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Perry, ''The Haight Ashbury: A History'', Wenner Books; Reprint edition (30 Mar 2007), 320pp , {{ISBN|1-932958-55-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musicians and bands like [[Jefferson Airplane]], the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[Janis Joplin]] all lived a short distance from the famous intersection. During the 1967 [[Summer of Love]], thousands of hippies gathered there, popularized by [[chart hit|hit]] songs such as "[[San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)]]". A July 7, 1967, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover story on "The Hippies: Philosophy of a Subculture" and an August [[CBS News]] television report on "The Hippie Temptation",&lt;ref&gt;Harry Reasoner, [http://www.sfsu.edu/~avitv/avcatalog/88444.htm "The Hippie Temptation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319070344/http://www.sfsu.edu/~avitv/avcatalog/88444.htm |date=2006-03-19 }}, ''CBS News'', August 22, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other major media interest, exposed the hippie subculture to national attention and popularized the Flower Power movement across the country and around the world. That same summer, [[the Beatles]]' hit single "[[All You Need Is Love]]" served as an anthem for the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiener|first=Jon|authorlink=Jon Wiener|title=Come Together: John Lennon in His Time|year=1991|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana, Ill.|isbn=978-0-252-06131-8|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June, the Beatles performed the song on the ''[[Our World (TV special)|Our World]]'' international satellite broadcast, ensuring that the pacifist message reached an audience estimated at 400 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-beatles-make-history-with-all-you-need-is-love-a-minute-by-minute-breakdown-20140828 |title=The Beatles Make History With 'All You Need Is Love': A Minute-by-Minute Breakdown |last=Edwards |first=Gavin|date=28 August 2014|publisher=[[Rolling Stone|rollingstone.com]]|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[avant-garde]] art of [[Milton Glaser]], [[Heinz Edelmann]], and [[Peter Max]] became synonymous with the flower power generation. Edelman's illustration style was best known in his art designs for the Beatles' 1968 animated film ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]''. Glaser, the founder of [[Push Pin Studios]], also developed the loose psychedelic graphic design, seen for example in his seminal 1966 poster illustration of [[Bob Dylan]] with paisley hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cooperhewitt.org/NDA/WINNERS/2004/LIFETIMEACHIEVEMENT/index.shtml | title=2004 Lifetime Achievement Award | series=National Design Awards | work=Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum | accessdate=2011-03-17 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215182403/http://cooperhewitt.org/NDA/WINNERS/2004/LIFETIMEACHIEVEMENT/index.shtml | archivedate=2010-12-15 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the posters by pop artist [[Peter Max]], with their vivid fluid designs painted in [[Day-Glo]] colors, which became visual icons of flower power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Arts &amp; Entertainment Fads | first1=Frank W. | last1=Hoffman | first2=William G. | last2=Bailey | pages= 163–164 | publisher=Haworth Press |date=August 1990 | ISBN=0-86656-881-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Max's cover story in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine (September 1969) as well as appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', further established "flower power" style art into mainstream culture.&lt;ref name='ArtofPeterMax'&gt;{{cite book | last = Riley II | first = Charles A. | coauthors = | title = The Art of Peter Max | publisher = Abrams, New York | year = 2002 |edition= 1st | location = | pages = 228–235 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8109-3270-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1784">The term '''Formalesque''' was coined in 1994 by Australian art historian [[Bernard William Smith|Bernard Smith]] to replace 
[[Modernism]] as the name of the [[Art styles, periods and movements|artistic style]] of the period from around 1890 to 1960, now that this is no longer "modern".

''[[Modernism]]'' had emerged as a generic term to replace ''[[Post-Impressionism]]'' for the paintings of [[Manet]], [[Cézanne]], [[van Gogh]], and [[Gauguin]]. According to Smith, the key emphasis in such work is the importance of ''form'' and ''flatness''. The term was soon applied also in architecture (e.g. [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Walter Gropius]]) and sculpture (e.g. [[Jacob Epstein|Epstein]] and [[Brâncuși]]).

After 1960, Modernism was displaced by [[Postmodern art|Postmodernism]], and then by the art still at present referred to as "[[contemporary art]]". Since [[Modernism]] is no longer "modern", Smith argues that it requires a more appropriate [[Art styles, periods and movements|period style]] name to distinguish it: hence his introduction of '''Formalesque'''. Like "romanesque" and "arabesque", the name is intended to indicate a style that arose by the development of a basic interest in form (but without the specific connotations of the term [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]]).

'''''Goodbye Uncle Tom''''' ({{lang-it|'''Addio Zio Tom'''}}) is a 1971 Italian [[mondo film]] [[documentary film]] co-directed and co-written by [[Gualtiero Jacopetti]] and [[Franco Prosperi]] with music by [[Riz Ortolani]]. The film is [[List of films based on actual events|based on true events]] in which the filmmakers explore antebellum America, using period documents to examine in graphic detail the racist ideology and degrading conditions faced by [[Africans]] under [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]].  Because of the use of published documents and materials from the public record, the film labels itself a documentary, though all footage is re-staged using actors.&lt;ref name=Corliss&gt;[http://entertainment.time.com/2011/08/21/gualtiero-jacopetti-the-man-behind-the-mondo-movies/ Provocateur Gualtiero Jacopetti Dead at 91: Honoring the Man Behind the Mondo Movies.] Richard Corliss, August 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==

The film was shot primarily in [[Haiti]], where directors Jacopetti and Prosperi were treated as guests of Haitian dictator [[Papa Doc Duvalier]]. Duvalier supported the filmmakers by giving them diplomatic cars, clearance to film anywhere on the island, as many [[extra (acting)|extra]]s as they required, and even a nightly dinner with Duvalier himself.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt; Hundreds of Haitian extras participated in the film's various depictions of the cruel treatment of slaves, as well as white actors portraying historical characters (including [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]).

== Release ==
The film was confiscated in Italy and re-released the following year, 1972, in a cut version bearing the different title ''Zio Tom''.{{sfn|Giusti|1999|p=5}}

In Frande, the film was released as ''Les negrières'', in Germany as ''Addio, Onkel Tom!''{{sfn|Giusti|1999|p=5}}

==Alternate versions==
{{Slavery}}
The directors' cut of ''Addio Zio Tom'' draws parallels between the horrors of slavery and the rise of the [[Black Power Movement]], represented by [[Eldridge Cleaver]], [[LeRoi Jones]], [[Stokely Carmichael]], and a few others.  The film ends with an unidentified man's fantasy re-enactment of [[William Styron]]'s ''[[The Confessions of Nat Turner]].'' This man imagines [[Nat Turner]]'s revolt in the present, including the brutal murder of the whites around him, who replace the figures Turner talks about in Styron's novel as the unidentified reader speculates about Turner's motivations and ultimate efficacy in changing the conditions he rebelled against.  American distributors felt that such scenes were too incendiary, and forced Jacopetti and Prosperi to remove more than thirteen minutes of footage explicitly concerned with racial politics for American and other Anglophone audiences.

== Reception and criticism ==

The film has frequently been criticized as [[racist]], despite directors Jacopetti and Prosperi's claims to the contrary. In [[Roger Ebert]]'s 1972 review of the shorter American version, he asserts that the directors have "Made the most disgusting, contemptuous insult to decency ever to masquerade as a documentary."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/farewell-uncle-tom-1972 Farewell Uncle Tom] Roger Ebert, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to call the film "Cruel [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]]", suggesting that the directors degraded the black actors playing slaves by having them enact the extremely dehumanizing situations the film depicts. Critic [[Pauline Kael]] called the film "the most specific and rabid incitement to race war",&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Kael, "The Current Cinema: Notes on Black Movies", ''New Yorker'', December 2, 1972, 163.&lt;/ref&gt; a view shared by [[white nationalist]] and former [[Ku Klux Klan]] leader [[David Duke]], who claimed the film was a [[Jewish conspiracy]] to incite blacks to violence against whites.&lt;ref&gt;David Duke, My Awakening: A Path to Racial Understanding (Mandeville: Free Spech Press, 1999), 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

The directors denied charges of racism; in the 2003 documentary ''Godfathers of Mondo'' they specifically note that one of their intentions in making ''Addio Zio Tom'' was to "make a new film that would be clearly anti-racist" in response to criticism by Ebert and others over perceived racism in their previous film ''[[Africa Addio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Godfathers of Mondo.'' Dir. David Gregory. Blue Underground, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was considered to have been a critical and commercial failure.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt;

Italian film critic Marco Giusti calls it "not bad" and remembers that the numerous scenes in the nude "made a certain effect back then".{{sfn|Giusti|1999|p=5}}

== Soundtrack ==

The film was scored by Italian composer [[Riz Ortolani]]{{sfn|Giusti|1999|p=5}} and is notable for the theme "Oh My Love" sung by [[Katyna Ranieri]],{{sfn|Giusti|1999|p=5}} which would later be used in the soundtrack to the 2011 film ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]''. Ortolani also collaborated with directors Jacopetti and Prosperi on their previous films, ''[[Mondo Cane]]'', and ''[[Africa Addio]]''.

'''Gus Green Van Sant Jr.'''&lt;ref name="filmr"/&gt; (born July 24, 1952) is an American film director, screenwriter, painter, photographer, musician, and author who has earned acclaim as both an [[independent film|independent]] and [[mainstream media|mainstream]] filmmaker. His films typically deal with themes of marginalized subcultures, in particular homosexuality; as such, Van Sant is considered one of the most prominent [[auteur]]s of the [[New Queer Cinema]] movement.

Van Sant's early career was devoted to directing television commercials in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. He made his feature-length cinematic directorial debut with ''[[Mala Noche]]'' (1985). His second feature ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'' (1989) was highly acclaimed, and earned Van Sant screenwriting awards from the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] and [[New York Film Critics Circle]] and the award for Best Director from the [[National Society of Film Critics]]. His following film, ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' (1991), was similarly praised, as was the [[black comedy]] ''[[To Die For]]'' (1995), the drama ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'' (1997), and the biographical film ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'' (2008); for the latter two, Van Sant was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] and both films received [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] nominations.

In 2003, Van Sant's film about the [[Columbine High School massacre]], ''[[Elephant (2003 film)|Elephant]]'', won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]]. Van Sant also received the festival's [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director Award]] that same year, making him one of only two filmmakers—the other being [[Coen brothers|Joel Coen]]—to win both accolades at the festival in the same year.&lt;ref name="cannes-2003.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4071982/year/2003.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Elephant |accessdate=2009-11-05|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though most of Van Sant's other films received favourable reviews, such as ''[[Finding Forrester]]'' (2000) and ''[[Paranoid Park (film)|Paranoid Park]]'' (2007), some of his efforts, such as the [[art film|art house production]] ''[[Last Days (2005 film)|Last Days]]'' (2005) and the environmental drama ''[[Promised Land (2012 film)|Promised Land]]'' (2012), have received more mixed reviews from critics, while his [[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (film)|adaptation]] of [[Tom Robbins]]'s ''[[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (novel)|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues]]'' (1994), his [[Psycho (1998 film)|1998 remake]] of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', and ''[[The Sea of Trees]]'' (2015), were critical and commercial failures.

In addition to directing, Van Sant has written the screenplays for several of his earlier works, and is the author of a novel entitled [[Pink (Van Sant Novel)|''Pink'']].&lt;ref&gt;Gus Van Sant, ''Pink'', Faber &amp; Faber, 1998, {{ISBN|0-385-49353-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book of his photography, called ''108 Portraits'',&lt;ref&gt;Gus Van Sant, ''108 Portraits'', Twin Palms Pub., 1993, {{ISBN|0-944092-22-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; has also been published, and he has released two musical albums. He is openly gay and currently lives in [[Los Feliz, CA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://gaylife.about.com/cs/gaythemedmovies/a/gusvansant.htm|title = Interview with Openly Gay Filmmaker Gus Van Sant|website = [[About.com]]|date = November 11, 2015|last = Brandao|first = Rodrigo|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160813164931/http://gaylife.about.com/cs/gaythemedmovies/a/gusvansant.htm|archivedate = August 13, 2016|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Van Sant was born and raised in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], the son of Betty (née Seay) and Gus Green Van Sant Sr; Gus's father was a clothing manufacturer and traveling salesman,&lt;ref name="filmr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gus Van Sant Biography (1952?-)|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/20/Gus-Van-Sant.html|work=film reference|publisher=Advameg, Inc|accessdate=August 15, 2012|author=film reference|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who rapidly worked his way into middle class prosperity, holding executive marketing positions that included being president of the [[White Stag (clothing)|White Stag Manufacturing Company]]'s Apparel Operation.&lt;ref name=changes-white-stag&gt;{{cite news|title=Changes in Management Disclosed by White Stag|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|date=December 5, 1969|location=Portland, Oregon|at=Section 1, p. 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his father's job, the family moved continually during Van Sant's childhood.

His paternal family is of partial Dutch origin; the name "Van Sant" is derived from the Dutch name "Van Zandt". The earliest Van Zandt arrived in the [[New Netherland]] area in the early 17th century, around what is now New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/dutch_americans/gus-green-van-sant-jr/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Sant is an alumnus of [[Darien High School]] in [[Darien, Connecticut]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Darien High School|url=http://www.publicschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/15519|work=Public School Review|publisher=Public School Review|accessdate=September 24, 2012|year=2003–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Catlin Gabel School]] in [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gus Van Sant- Biography|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/person/gus-van-sant/biography.html|work=Yahoo! Movies|publisher=Yahoo!, Inc|accessdate=September 24, 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One constant in the director's early years was his interest in visual arts (namely, painting and [[Super-8]] filmmaking); while still in school he began making semi-autobiographical shorts costing between 30 and 50 dollars. Van Sant's artistic leanings took him to the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] in 1970, where his introduction to various avant-garde directors inspired him to change his major from painting to cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marx|first1=Rebecca Flint|title=Gus van Sant Biography|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/1548269/Gus-van-Sant/biography|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1982–1989: Early career===
After spending time in Europe, Van Sant went to Los Angeles in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/1548269/Gus-van-Sant/biography | work=The New York Times | title=Gus van Sant}}&lt;/ref&gt; He secured a job as a production assistant to filmmaker [[Ken Shapiro]], with whom he developed a few ideas, none of which came to fruition. In 1981, Van Sant made ''Alice in Hollywood'', a film about a naïve young actress who goes to Hollywood and abandons her ideals. It was never released. During this period, Van Sant began to spend time observing the denizens of the more down-and-out sections of [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. He became fascinated by the existence of this marginalized section of L.A.'s population, especially in context with the more ordinary, prosperous world that surrounded them. Van Sant would repeatedly focus his work on those existing on society's fringes, making his feature film [[directorial debut]] ''[[Mala Noche]]''.

It was made two years after Van Sant went to New York to work in an advertising agency. He saved $20,000 during his tenure there, enabling him to finance the majority of his tale of doomed love between a gay liquor store clerk and a Mexican immigrant. The film, which was taken from Portland street writer [[Walt Curtis]]' semi-autobiographical novella, featured some of the director's hallmarks, notably an unfulfilled romanticism, a dry sense of the absurd, and the refusal to treat homosexuality as something deserving of judgment. Unlike many gay filmmakers, Van Sant—who had long been openly gay—declined to use same-sex relationships as fodder for overtly political statements, although such relationships would frequently appear in his films.

Shot in black-and-white, the film earned Van Sant almost overnight acclaim on the festival circuit, with the ''Los Angeles Times'' naming it the year's best [[independent film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/gus-van-sant-411096 |title=Gus Van Sant : Biography |publisher=Biography.com |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's success attracted Hollywood interest, and Van Sant was briefly courted by [[Universal Studios|Universal]]; the courtship ended after Van Sant pitched a series of project ideas (including what would later become ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'' and ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'') that the studio declined to take interest in.

Van Sant moved back to [[Portland, Oregon]], where he set up house and began giving life to the ideas rejected by Universal. He directed ''Drugstore Cowboy'' about four drug addicts robbing pharmacies to support their habit. The film met with great critical success and revived the career of [[Matt Dillon]].

===1990–1995: Indie and arthouse success===
''Drugstore Cowboy'''s exploration of the lives of those living on society's outer fringes, as well as its [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] setting, were mirrored in Van Sant's next effort, the similarly acclaimed ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' (1991). Only with the success of ''Cowboy'' was Van Sant now given license to make ''Idaho'' (a film he had originally pitched but was knocked back several times as the script was deemed 'too risky' by studios). Now [[New Line Cinema]] had given Van Sant the green light, he was on a mission to get the ''Idaho'' script to his first choices for his two young leads. After months of struggle with agents and managers over the content of the script, Van Sant finally secured [[River Phoenix]] and [[Keanu Reeves]] in the roles of Mike Waters and Scott Favor. Centering around the dealings of two male hustlers (played by Phoenix and Reeves), the film was a compelling examination of unrequited love, alienation, and the concept of family (a concept Van Sant repeatedly explores in his films). The film won him an [[Independent Spirit Award]] for his screenplay (he had won the same award for his ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'' screenplay), as well as greater prestige. The film also gained River Phoenix best actor honors at the [[Venice Film Festival]] among others. In addition, it helped Reeves—previously best known for his work in the ''[[Bill and Ted]]'' movies—to get the critical respect that had previously eluded him.

Van Sant's next film, a 1993 [[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (film)|adaptation]] of [[Tom Robbins]]' ''[[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (novel)|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues]]'', was an excessive flop, both commercially and critically. Featuring an unusually large budget (for Van Sant, at least) of $8.5&amp;nbsp;million and a large, eclectic cast including [[Uma Thurman]], [[John Hurt]], Keanu Reeves and a newcomer in the form of River Phoenix's younger sister [[Rain Phoenix|Rain]] (at Phoenix's suggestion), the film was worked and then reworked, but the finished product nonetheless resulted in something approaching a significant disaster.

Van Sant's 1995 film ''[[To Die For]]'' helped to restore his luster. An adaptation of [[Joyce Maynard]]'s novel, the [[black comedy]] starred [[Nicole Kidman]] as a murderously ambitious weather girl; it also stars [[Matt Dillon]] as her hapless husband and, the third Phoenix sibling in as many projects, [[Joaquin Phoenix]], as her equally hapless lover (River had died from a drug overdose a year and half earlier). It was Van Sant's first effort for a major studio ([[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]]), and its success paved the way for further projects of the director's choosing. The same year, he served as executive producer for [[Larry Clark]]'s ''[[Kids (film)|Kids]]''; it was a fitting assignment, due to both the film's subject matter and the fact that Clark's photographs of junkies had served as reference points for Van Sant's ''Drugstore Cowboy''.

===1997–2003: Mainstream breakout===
In 1997, Van Sant gained mainstream recognition and critical acclaim thanks to ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', which starred and was written by [[Matt Damon]] and [[Ben Affleck]]. The film—about a troubled, blue-collar mathematical genius—was a huge critical and commercial success. It was nominated for nine [[Academy Award]]s, including Best Director for Van Sant. It also won two, including Best Screenplay for Damon and Affleck, and Best Supporting Actor Oscar for [[Robin Williams]], who, in his acceptance speech, referred to Van Sant as "the mellowest man in Hollywood." Van Sant, Damon and Affleck parodied themselves and the film's success in [[Kevin Smith]]'s'' [[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]''.

The success of ''Good Will Hunting'' afforded Van Sant the opportunity to [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] classic ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. As opposed to reinterpreting the 1960 film, Van Sant opted to recreate the film shot-for-shot, in color, with a cast of young Hollywood A-listers. His decision was met with equal parts curiosity, skepticism, and derision from industry insiders and outsiders alike, and the finished result met with a similar reception. It starred [[Anne Heche]], [[Vince Vaughn]] and [[Julianne Moore]], and met with a negative critical reception and did poorly at the box office.

In 2000, Van Sant directed ''[[Finding Forrester]]'', about a high-school student ([[Rob Brown (actor)|Rob Brown]]) from [[the Bronx]] unlikely becoming a friend of a crusty, reclusive author ([[Sean Connery]]). Critical response was generally positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/finding_forrester/|title=Finding Forrester|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to directing, he devoted considerable energy to releasing two albums and publishing a novel, ''[[Pink (novel)|Pink]]'', which was a thinly veiled exploration of his grief over River Phoenix's death.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===2003–present: Return to arthouse cinema===
[[File:Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot - Press Conference.jpg|thumb|Gus Van Sant and Joaquin Phoenix at the press conference of ''[[Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot]]''. Berlinale 2018.|left]]
Van Sant traveled to the deserts of [[Argentina]], [[Utah]], and [[Death Valley]] for the production of 2002's ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', a loosely devised, largely improvised feature in which stars Matt Damon and [[Casey Affleck]]—both playing characters named Gerry—wander through the desert, discussing ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', video games, and nothing in particular. The film premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].

It took ''Gerry'' over a year to make it to theaters, in which time Van Sant began production on his next film, ''[[Elephant (2003 film)|Elephant]]''. Approached by [[HBO]] and producer [[Diane Keaton]] to craft a fictional film based on the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]], the director chose to shoot in his hometown of Portland, employing dozens of untrained, teen actors. As well as melding improvisational long takes like those in ''Gerry'' with [[Harris Savides]]' fluid camerawork, the film was also influenced by Alan Clarke's 1989 film of the same name (see ''[[Elephant (1989 film)|Elephant]]''). The finished film provoked strong reactions from audiences at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]]. At the [[Cannes]] festival, the jury awarded ''Elephant'' with their top prize, the [[Palme d'Or]], and Van Sant with his first Best Director statue from the festival.&lt;ref name="cannes-2003.com" /&gt; The success of ''Elephant'' led Van Sant to show the U.S. premiere of ''Elephant'' as a fundraiser for [[Outside In (organization)|Outside In]], an organization working to help youth living on the streets of [[Portland, Oregon]].

{{Anchor|Death Trilogy}}In 2005, Van Sant released ''[[Last Days (film)|Last Days]]'', the final component of what he refers to as his "Death Trilogy," (the other parts being ''Gerry'' and ''Elephant''). It is a fictionalized account of what happened to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]] in the days leading up to his death. In 2006, Van Sant began work on ''[[Paranoid Park (film)|Paranoid Park]]'' based on the book by [[Blake Nelson]], about a skateboarding teenager who accidentally causes someone's death. The film was released in Europe in February 2008. He also directed the "Le Marais" segment of the omnibus film ''[[Paris, je t'aime]]''.

Released in 2008, Van Sant's ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'' is a biopic of [[openly gay]] San Francisco politician [[Harvey Milk]], who was assassinated in 1978 and is played by [[Sean Penn]] in the movie. The film received eight [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations at the [[81st Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], winning two for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] for Penn and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for writer [[Dustin Lance Black]]. Van Sant was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milk Picks Up Two Big Oscars as Slumdog Dominates Academy Awards|url=http://www.towleroad.com/2009/02/slumdog-millionaire-took-the-best-picture-last-night-at-the-academy-awards-along-with-7-other-trophies-but-it-was-the-s.html|work=Towleroad|publisher=Towleroad|accessdate=August 15, 2012|author=Andy Towle|date=February 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Milk" gets EIGHT Academy Award nominations....|url=http://www.insidesocal.com/outinhollywood/2009/01/milk-gets-eight-academy-award.html|accessdate=August 15, 2012|newspaper=Out in Hollywood with Greg Hernandez|date=January 22, 2009|author=Greg Hernandez|agency=Los Angeles Newspaper group|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305215853/http://www.insidesocal.com/outinhollywood/2009/01/milk-gets-eight-academy-award.html|archivedate=March 5, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Sant later stated that his experience with Sean Penn on the film was "amazing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MADONNA|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/madonna/#_|work=interviewmagazine.com|publisher=Interview, Inc|accessdate=August 15, 2012|author=Gus Van Sant|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''Promised Land'', Van Sant directed a film titled ''[[Sea of Trees (film)|Sea of Trees]]'', which starred [[Matthew McConaughey]] and [[Ken Watanabe]]. The film tells the story of a man who travels to the infamous [[suicide forest]] in Japan to kill himself, only to encounter another man wishing to kill himself as well, with whom he then embarks on a "spiritual journey."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kit|first=Boris|title=Matthew McConaughey to Star in Gus Van Sant's 'Sea of Trees'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/matthew-mcconaughey-star-gus-van-677201|work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=TheHollywoodReporter.com|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was selected to compete for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2015 Cannes Film Festival]] but was met with harsh critical reception at the Cannes, being booed and laughed at.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gus Van Sant's 'Sea of Trees' Booed at Cannes Premiere|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/gus-van-sants-sea-of-trees-booed-at-cannes-premiere-1201497795/|accessdate=December 28, 2015|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reinstein|first1=Mara|title=Matthew McConaughey's Film The Sea of Trees Booed, Laughed at During Cannes Film Festival|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/matthew-mcconaugheys-the-sea-of-trees-booed-at-cannes-film-festival-2015165|publisher=usmagazine.com|accessdate=May 15, 2015|date=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hammer Prints Limited''' was a company founded in 1954 by [[Nigel Henderson (artist)|Nigel Henderson]] and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]].

== History ==

Founded on 5 August 1954, Hammer Prints Ltd was established: "To purchase, sell, manufacture, hire or act as agents for the sale of textiles, wallpaper, statuary, ceramics, furniture and photographic equipment and materials". Henderson and Paolozzi were registered as the company directors along with Judith Henderson who acted as secretary. Working from a studio at Henderson's home at [[Landermere Wharf]] near [[Thorpe-le-Soken]] in [[Essex]], they developed over eleven designs that were screen printed onto wallpapers, textiles and readymade ceramic products. 

Hammer Prints coincided with the artists’ involvement in the [[Independent Group]], a contingent of artists, architects and writers who celebrated popular culture and mass production. Paolozzi's notes stated ‘it is the object of Hammer Prints Ltd that an attack be made on the craft field using the silk-screen as the media to be exploited.’&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Cotton,  'Nigel Henderson &amp; Eduardo Paolozzi: Hammer Prints Ltd 1954-74', firstsite, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Hammer Prints wallpapers were manufactured by Cole &amp; Son from 1955, and their textile designs were produced by the Lancashire firm [[Hull Traders]] from 1958. ''Coalface'', ''Cowcumber'', ''Hessian'' and ''Sgraffito'' were the first to
become available from January 1955. ''Barkcloth'', ''Big Drawings'', ''Newsprint'', ''Portobello'' and ''Townscape'' followed whilst ''Sea Beasts'' and ''Toys'' were developed for a range of ceramic tiles, lampstands, bowls, trays and furniture. 

A letter from Paolozzi to Peter Hatch at the Council of Industrial Design, (latterly known as the [[Design Council]]) introduced their work:

:"[The wallpapers] are printed in black on white and white on black. The same screens have been employed in different colours according to customers requirements, we also provide the same designs printed on various fabrics by the Helzarin colour process... The origin of the designs of the wallpapers is the outcome of the application of design ideas employed by Nigel Henderson, Head of Creative Photography at the Central School of Arts and Crafts and Eduardo Paolozzi design instructor at the same school.'' 

:'''Sgraffito''' is built up round several photo prints of an inked impression of an engraved block of plaster. 
:'''Hessian''' is a demonstration of a monotype principal, pieces of inked canvas arranged and rearranged to form a multi-evocative pattern. 
:'''Coalface''', lid of a tea chest engraved and worked upon with red-hot wires to form a design which would evoke the world of geological stratifications and form a background to modern living.
:'''Cowcumber''', photo-enlargement of a seventeenth century herbal wood-cut with adjustments made to fit scale of screen and repeat."&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo Paolozzi to Peter Hatch 22 August, 1955, Tate Archive, reproduced in full in Robin Spencer, ''Eduardo Paolozzi: Writings and Interviews'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2000) p.77-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Some promotional material on their designs described two later patterns:
:'''Newsprint''' which was originally called 'Paris Walls', has its origin in a large number of photographs of hoardings, wall drawings, and so forth taken during a visit to that city.
:'''Barkcloth''' has an affinity with the semi-abstract designs of some primitive peoples, in which man's own products are rendered into their simplest forms and incorporated as elements in a geometrical design.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer Prints promotional material quoted in Victoria Walsh ''Parallel of Life and Art'' (Thames and Hudson, London 2001) p.137-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammer Prints exhibitions were held at the Studio Club on Swallow Street in December 1955 and from 10 December 1956 to 4 January 1957. The Castle Bookshop on Museum Street in Colchester also held 'an exhibition and sale of bowls, tiles, scarves, textiles and wallpapers from 21 April to 5 May, 1956. &lt;ref&gt; Judith Collins, ''Eduardo Paolozzi: Artificial Horizons and Eccentric Ladders, Works on Paper 1946-1995'' (The British Council, London 1996) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The collaboration between the artists lasted only a few years with Henderson working on designs alone until 1962. The artists continued to receive royalties on their design work from Cole &amp; Son and Hull Traders until the company was dissolved in 1975.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5295">'''InterAccess''' is a Canadian [[artist-run centre]] and electronic media production facility in [[Toronto]]. Founded in 1982 as Toronto Community Videotex, InterAccess is [[Ontario|Ontario's]] only exhibition space devoted exclusively to technological [[media arts]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interaccess.org/about/history.php&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre for Contemporary Canadian Art places the founding of InterAccess as a key moment in both the history of Canadian electronic art but also within a timeline of developments in international art, science, technology and culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccca.ca/circuit4/timeline.html?languagePref=fr&amp; Centre for Contemporary Canadian Art "Timeline of Digital Art"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1983, InterAccess was incorporated as a not-for-profit, [[Not-for-profit arts organization|artist-run access centre]], under the name [[Videotex|Toronto Community Videotex (TCV)]]. It provided artists access to the [[Telidon]] system, a precursor of the [[World Wide Web]]. The early conception of electronic art placed the organization within the production cooperative system in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, "Cultural Democracy and Institutional Difference", p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; TCV's members created artworks which fell within the more [[systems art|systems-based]] notions of art production, rather than the [[Fine arts|beaux-arts]]&lt;ref&gt;Dowler, "Interstitial Aesthetics and the Politics of Video at the Canada Council", pp. 35-6&lt;/ref&gt; aesthetic of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Hough, "Beyond the Gallery (Electronic Mail Art)", p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  The name change to InterAccess in 1987 reflected a new focus on [[Macintosh]] graphics, [[multimedia]] production and a dial-up artists’ network (much like a [[Bulletin Board System]], or BBS) known as Matrix.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, "The Matrix Artists' Network: An Electronic Community", pp. 230-31&lt;/ref&gt;

InterAccess moved to a larger facility in 1995 allowing InterAccess to offer a gallery and production space that expanded its activities beyond simply access to multimedia production. The exhibitions began to emphasize the finished production and there was a particular focus on establishing an international presence for the centre.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, "Radio Art in a Gallery?", p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition ''Pandoras Box'', a collaboration between InterAccess and Fylkingen New Music and Intermedia Art in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] in 2000, was billed as "the first international interactive encounter with art using remotely controlled robots."&lt;ref&gt;Herst, "The Disembodied Eye", p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, InterAccess moved to a renovated two-floor, three thousand square feet stand-alone building, allowing for more production space, a surround sound studio and a machine shop for constructing large-scale physical computing projects and installation.

The exhibition ''This must be the place: Vera Frenkel, [[David Rokeby]], [[Nell Tenhaaf]] and [[Norman White]]'' was a reconsideration of the centre and as well the place of electronic art within art history.&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, ''This must be the place'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The four featured artists are pioneers in electronic and interactive art and have a history with InterAccess as both members and exhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, ''This must be the place'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, InterAccess received a [[Canada Council]] Media Arts Commissioning Grant for ''The Networked City'', a series of five outdoor interactive installations on [[Yonge Street]] in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interaccess.org/exhibitions/index.php?id=55 The Networked City&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jennifer Chambers Lynch''' is an American film director and screenwriter. She is the daughter of filmmaker [[David Lynch]]. She is also known as the author of the book ''[[The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer]]''.

==Early life==
Lynch was born in [[Philadelphia]]. She is the daughter of artist and filmmaker [[David Lynch]], who is responsible for her Finnish ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DAVID LYNCH: "DEN HÄR VÄRLDEN ÄR FULL AV HAT OCH ÅNGEST"|url=http://nojesguiden.se/artiklar/david-lynch-%E2%80%9Dden-haer-vaerlden-aer-full-av-hat-och-angest%E2%80%9D|work=Nöjesguiden|publisher=REDAKTION|accessdate=May 26, 2013|language=Swedish|date=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and painter Peggy Reavey. She began practicing [[Transcendental Meditation]] at the age of six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Out on a limb|first=JAMES|last=MOTTRAM|work=The Independent on Sunday|location=London (UK)|date=February 22, 2009|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch graduated from the [[Interlochen Center for the Arts|Interlochen Art Academy]] where she studied visual arts and creative writing.

==Career==
===Film===
Lynch was educated in Los Angeles and [[Michigan]] at [[Interlochen Arts Academy]]. Together with her mother, Lynch made a brief appearance in her father's debut feature film ''[[Eraserhead]]'', but her appearance was not included in the final cut. Lynch subsequently worked as a [[production assistant]] on ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986), also directed by her father.

====''Boxing Helena''====
Lynch's commissioned screenplay for ''[[Boxing Helena]]'', which she would later go on to direct, attracted many actresses, including [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318779,00.html|title=Boxed Lynch|author=Casey Davidson | work=Entertainment Weekly|date=December 7, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sherilyn Fenn]], one of the stars in her father's television series ''Twin Peaks'' and the film ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'', was ultimately cast as leading character Helena. [[Kim Basinger]] was also attached and was famously sued after resigning from the project. The controversy surrounding that case, as well as [[feminist]] outcry over ''Helena'''s sadistic subject matter and accusations of [[nepotism]], accompanied the movie's critical drubbing upon its release in 1993.

In a 2009 interview with [[The Hollywood Interview]], Lynch mentions her reactions to the critical reception of ''[[Boxing Helena]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I would love to know why people were so mad at me for telling a crazy fairy tale. I'm the first to say I didn't know what I was doing. I did the best I could at 19, and all these crazy things happened. The idea that the film was faulted when everyone involved worked so fucking hard and believed in me, and there were these adults believing in me, who was essentially a child…when the National Organization of Women slammed me, that was sort of the final straw. It was no wonder I put my legs behind my ears and got pregnant. (laughs) Not that I didn't love sex before then, but seriously.

====2008 onwards====
Following a lengthy hiatus, Lynch returned to the public arena with the film ''[[Surveillance (2008 film)|Surveillance]]'' and, in October 2008, ''Surveillance'' won the top prize at the [[Festival de Cine de Sitges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Complete List of Sitges Winners Announced!|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2008/10/complete-list-of-sitges-winners-announced.html|work=twitchfilm.com|publisher=IndieClick Film Network|accessdate=October 6, 2012|author=Todd Brown|date=October 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, Lynch became the first woman to receive the [[New York City Horror Film Festival]]'s Best Director award.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite web|title=Summer Guide: Surveillance, Jennifer Lynch's First in 16 Years|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-05-13/film/summer-guide-surveillance-jennifer-lynch-s-first-in-16-years/|work=Village Voice|publisher=Village Voice, LLC|accessdate=June 10, 2013|author=Aaron Hillis|date=May 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynch was announced as director of the film ''[[Nagin (2009 film)|Nagin]]'' (the film is also known as ''Hisss'') that featured Bollywood actress [[Mallika Sherawat]], but the film that was released was not Lynch's work, even though the producers attached her name to the final product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surveillance Director Transforms into a Snake Woman|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/12528|work=Bloody Disgusting|publisher=Bloody Disgusting, LLC|accessdate=October 6, 2012|last=Miska|first=Brad|date=June 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wyatt"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Q&amp;A with A Fall from Grace Director Jennifer Lynch|url=http://www.stlmag.com/St-Louis-Magazine/October-2012/A-Q-A-with-A-Fall-From-Grace-Director-Jennifer-Lynch/|work=St Louis Magazine|publisher=St Louis Magazine|accessdate=June 10, 2013|author=Andrew Wyatt|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch explained in a 2012 interview:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Well, ultimately, I didn't get to make that film. I put my director's cut together, and the producers decided it was not what they wanted.  They took it back to India. I never did any scoring or cutting or color-timing or any of the things you do to make the movie. They took the footage and changed it into what they wanted it to be. So it's not my film. I went to India and shot some footage, but I have nothing to do with the movie they made."&lt;ref name="Wyatt" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lynch was scheduled to film ''Visibility'' for the [[Motion Picture Corporation of America]] in 2011, but, as of June 2013, this project is not completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118026338.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1|title=Lynch latches on to Loeb's 'Visibility' | work=Variety | first=Pamela|last=McClintock|date=October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch then directed and co-wrote the 2012 horror film ''[[Chained (2012 film)|Chained]]'', in which [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] stars as a cab-driving serial killer.

{{As of|June 2013}}, Lynch is filming ''[[A Fall from Grace]]''. The film stars [[Tim Roth]] as a St. Louis detective investigating the murder of young girls by a mysterious assailant and is scheduled for release late in 2015. A trailer for ''A Fall from Grace'' was published on March 7, 2013 by Apothecary Films producer David Michaels, who worked with the director on ''Surveillance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A FALL FROM GRACE {{!}} a JENNIFER LYNCH film – Teaser Trailer – Narrated by Bill Pullman|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buciWexsLuA|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=June 10, 2013|author=David Michaels|format=Video upload|date=March 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-written by producer Eric Wilkinson, the film is set and filmed in [[St. Louis]], U.S. and is inspired by the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge.&lt;ref name="Wyatt" /&gt;

===Television===
Lynch authored ''[[The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer]]'' to accompany the television show ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' which was created by her father [[David Lynch]] and [[Mark Frost]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/28/books/are-the-owls-what-they-seem.html|title=Are the Owls What They Seem?|author=Stanley, Alessandra|date=October 28, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynch also directed episodes of many television series such as ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'', ''[[Finding Carter]]'', ''[[Psych]]'', ''[[Quantico (TV series)|Quantico]]'', ''[[Teen Wolf (2011 TV series)|Teen Wolf]]'', ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'', ''[[The Last Ship (TV series)|The Last Ship]]'', ''[[Wayward Pines]]'', ''[[American Horror Story]]'', ''[[The Strain]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20141220/PC1201/141229956|title=Demons in action: On the set of WE tv's new series 'South of Hell'|last=Parker|first=Adam|work=[[The Post and Courier]]|date=December 20, 2014|accessdate=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'',  ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' and ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''

===Other projects===
In 1993, Lynch directed the music video "Living in the Rose" by the British rock band [[New Model Army (band)|New Model Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Production Notes|agency=Billboard|issue=24|date=12 June 1993|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 21, 2010, Lynch was a judge at the International Surrealist Film Festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2010 International Surrealist Film Festival|url=http://www.downtownindependent.com/events/the-2010-international|work=Downtown Independent|publisher=Downtown Independent|accessdate=October 6, 2012|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she worked as producer for the Corey Brandenstein natural horror film ''The Compound''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Lynch and Corey Brandenstein Throw Us to the Dogs in The Compound|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37672/jennifer-lynch-and-corey-brandenstein-throw-us-dogs-the-compound|work=Dread Central|publisher=Dread Central Media, LLC|accessdate=October 6, 2012|last=Barton|first=Steve|date=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Australian documentary titled ''Despite the Gods'', which chronicles Lynch's struggle to make the film ''[[Hisss]]'', was released in 2012. The documentary was shown at the Canadian International Documentary Festival and the program described the film: "Out of her depth shooting on location with an Indian crew and two top Bollywood stars, Lynch turns her production into a vehicle for her own self-actualization, paying no regard to timeline, budget or reality. As the story in front of the camera derails, the story behind the camera explodes.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Despite The Gods |url=http://www.hotdocs.ca/film/title/despite_the_gods |work=Hot Docs |publisher=Hot Docs |accessdate=June 10, 2013 |date=April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530174629/http://www.hotdocs.ca/film/title/despite_the_gods |archivedate=May 30, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She eventually disowned the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hiss|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/hisss-director-jennifer-lynch-disowns-film/702189/|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=October 25, 2010|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, she is also a member of the board of advisers for the [[Hollywood Horror Museum]].

'''Khmer sculpture''' refers to the stone sculpture of the [[Khmer Empire]], which ruled a territory based on modern [[Cambodia]], but rather larger, from the 9th to the 13th century. The most celebrated examples are found in [[Angkor]], which served as the seat of the empire. 

==Styles==
There are several recognisable specific art styles of the Angkorian period:&lt;ref name = "National Museum"&gt;{{cite web |title = Khmer Art History |publisher = [[National Museum of Cambodia]] | url= http://www.cambodiamuseum.info/en_khmer_art_history.html | accessdate = 13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Phnom Kulen|Kulen]] style (c.825-75)
# [[Koh Ker]] style (941-944)
# [[Baphuon]] style (1010-1080)
# [[Angkor Wat]] style (1100-1175)
# [[Bayon]] style (late 12th to early 13th century)

==Movement away from Indian models==
[[File:005 Apsaras at Angkor Wat, Cambodia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Apsara]] carving at [[Angkor Wat]].]]
Earlier Khmer art were influenced by Indian influences of Hindu themes. By the 7th century, Khmer sculpture begins to drift away from its Hindu influences – pre-Gupta for the Buddhist figures, Pallava for the Hindu figures – and through constant stylistic evolution, it comes to develop its own originality, which by the 10th century can be considered complete and absolute. An example of Khmer style that totally departed from Indian sculpture tradition is the wholeness of its figure, which bears similarities to the ancient Egyptian sculpture. Unlike almost all of Indian and Javanese Hindu-Buddhist stone sculptures, which were carved in [[high relief]]s, slabs or supported by [[stelae]] on the figure's back, Khmer sculpture is carved wholly in the round. Khmer stone sculpture did not employ any stelae on the back of the figure to support it, as the result broken arms, hands or ankles vividly attested to the vulnerability of this format. Nevertheless, Khmer sculptors seems to wish their works to be seen from all sides in the garbagriha in the center of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Gardner's Art through the Ages: Backpack Edition, Book C: Non-Western Art to 1300 | first =Fred | last =Kleiner |publisher = Cengage Learning, 2015 | page = 456 | url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=P4fCBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=id#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | isbn = 9781305544918 | accessdate = 13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khmers attempted to make free-standing statues, supported by an arch or by an attribute of the divinity such as a piece of clothing or a hand-held object.

Khmer sculpture soon goes beyond religious representation, which becomes almost a pretext in order to portray court figures in the guise of gods and goddesses. But furthermore, it also comes to constitute a means and end in itself for the execution of stylistic refinement, like a kind of testing ground. We have already seen how the social context of the Khmer kingdom provides a second key to understanding this art. But we can also imagine that on a more exclusive level, small groups of intellectuals and artists were at work, competing among themselves in mastery and refinement as they pursued a hypothetical perfection of style.

The gods we find in Khmer sculpture are those of the two great religions of India, [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. Priests supervised the execution of the works, attested to in the high iconographic precision of the sculptures. Nonetheless, unlike those Hindu images which repeat an idealized stereotype, these images are treated with great realism and originality because they depict living models: the king and his court. The true social function of Khmer art was, in fact, the glorification of the [[aristocracy]] through these images of the gods embodied in the princes. In fact, the cult of the “deva-raja” required the development of an eminently aristocratic art in which the people were supposed to see the tangible proof of the sovereign’s divinity, while the aristocracy took pleasure in seeing itself – if, it’s true, in idealized form – immortalized in the splendour of intricate adornments, elegant dresses and extravagant jewelry.
[[File:Fronton Cambodge Musée Guimet 9971.jpg|thumb|Relief from Angkor]]

The sculptures are images of gods, royal and imposing presences with feminine sensuality, giving impressions of figures at the courts with considerable power.  The sculptures represent the chosen divinity in the orthodox manner and succeeds in portraying, with great skill and expertise, high figures of the courts in all of their splendour, in the attire, adornments and jewelry of a sophisticated beauty.

But if we go beyond this initial impression, we can pause to observe some of the details of the sculptures, such as the double arc drawn by the eyebrows on the foreheads, evoked below by the wisely sketched curve of the noses and further down, by the double arc which masterfully outlines the lips and the double chin. Following a hypothetical vertical line down still further, we find another double arc outlining the breasts, and then, continuing down from the waist all along the skirts and ending in the ankles, we find almost at the bottom, a twisted double arc intended to represent the other side of the skirts. This detail serves, above all, to eliminate a certain hieratic fixedness, which was relatively common in the Khmer statues of lesser quality.

Ever since 1864, when [[France]] established a Protectorate in Cambodia, Western travellers have been amazed by the impressive ruins of Angkor. Not long after, once the [[École française d'Extrême-Orient]] began to study and catalogue the findings made at the excavations, the growing number of scholars from all around the world, art lovers and admirers of this [[sculpture]], became fervent proponents of Khmer Art.

“Khmer Art, captivating in its civility, refinement and delight, open to all forms of life, is made in the image of the country and its inhabitants. Nevertheless, among the arts of the Far East, few are as accessible to the Western temperament. Its profound beauty impresses itself upon the spirit and sensibility without requiring prior study. Its sobriety, its horror of excess and its sense of balance and harmony allow it to attain universal value.” Thus wrote [[Madeleine Giteau]], the distinguished member of the École française d’Extrême-Orient, in the introduction to her book Les Khmers in 1965. 

Currently, the largest museums of the West dedicate entire halls to Khmer sculpture, not to mention the enormous exhibition which took place first at the Galeries Nationales du [[Grand Palais]] in Paris and later at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington in 1997.

The '''Lewis chessmen''' ({{lang-no|Lewisbrikkene}}; {{lang-gd|Fir-Tàilisg}}; {{lang-sco|Lewis chesmen}}) or '''Uig chessmen''', named after the [[Uig, Lewis|bay]] where they were found,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceuig.co.uk/uig-chessmen/ |title=Uig Chessmen &amp;#124; Comann Eachdraidh Uig |publisher=Ceuig.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a group of distinctive [[12th-century]] [[chess]] pieces, along with other game pieces, most of which are carved from [[walrus ivory]]. Discovered in 1831 on [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]], Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=6665 |title=The enigma of the Lewis chessmen |publisher=Chessbase |date=9 November 2010 |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; they may constitute some of the few complete, surviving [[medieval]] [[chess set]]s, although it is not clear if a set as originally made can be assembled from the pieces. When found, the hoard contained 93 artifacts: 78 chess pieces, 14 [[Tables (board game)|tablemen]] and one belt buckle. Today, 82 pieces are owned and usually exhibited by the [[British Museum]] in [[London]], and the remaining 11 are at the [[National Museum of Scotland]] in [[Edinburgh]].

== Origin ==
[[File:Beserker, Lewis Chessmen, British Museum.jpg|thumb|upright|"[[Berserker]]" warder (rook), in the British Museum]]
The British Museum claims the chessmen were probably made in [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]], in the 12th century,&lt;ref name="British Museum"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/news_and_press_releases/statements/the_lewis_chessmen.aspx |title=The Lewis Chessmen |publisher=British Museum |date= |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some scholars have suggested other Nordic countries.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
During that period, the [[Outer Hebrides]], along with other major groups of [[Scottish islands]], were ruled by Norway.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

According to Dr. Alex Woolf, director of the [[University of St Andrews]] Institute for Medieval Studies, there are reasons for believing the pieces came from Trondheim:
*A broken queen piece in a similar style was found in an excavation of the archbishop's palace &amp;ndash; it appeared the piece was broken as it was being made.
*The presence of wealthy people in Trondheim able to pay craftsmen for high-quality chess pieces.
*Similar carving in [[Nidaros Cathedral]] in Trondheim.
*The excavation in Trondheim of a kite-shaped shield similar to shields on some of the pieces and a king piece of similar design found on [[Hitra (island)|Hitra]] Island, near the mouth of [[Trondheim Fjord]]. Woolf has said that the armour worn by the chess figures includes "perfect" reproductions of armour worn at the time in Norway.&lt;ref name=dlmnyt&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/arts/09lewis.html |title=Reopening History of Storied Norse Chessmen |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=14 September 2010 |date=8 September 2010 |last=McClain, Dylan Loeb}} (appeared 9 September 2010 in the newspaper, page C2, ''New York Times'')&lt;/ref&gt;

Icelanders Gudmundur Thorarinsson and Einar Einarsson have proposed that the chessmen originated in Iceland, since only in Iceland were the [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]]s called that at that time, while in other countries they used a name unassociated with the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.leit.is/lewis/ |title=Are the Isle of Lewis chessmen Icelandic? |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They further claim that the pieces were carved by an artist known as [[Margret the Adroit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Nancy Marie |title=Ivory Vikings: the Mystery of the most Famous Chessmen in the World and the Woman who Made Them |date=2015 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=9781137279378}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McClain |first1=Dylan Loeb |title=Reopening History of Storied Ivory Chessmen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/arts/09lewis.html?_r=0 |accessdate=5 March 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21662487-bones-contention |title=Bones of Contention |date=29 August 2015 |accessdate=5 March 2016 |newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is disputed by Woolf, who stated that the use of bishops originated in England,&lt;ref name=dlmnyt/&gt; and by Norwegian chess historian and member of the Ken Whyld Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Membership and Members |url=http://www.kwabc.org/index.php/membership-members |accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morten Lilleøren.&lt;ref name="The Lewis Chessmen on a Fantasy Iceland"&gt;Lilleøren, Morten, [http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=7695 The Lewis Chessmen on a Fantasy Iceland] (ChessBase News, 2 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians believe that the Lewis chessmen were hidden (or lost) after some mishap occurred during their carriage from Norway to wealthy Norse towns on the east coast of Ireland, such as [[Dublin]]. The large number of pieces and their lack of wear may suggest that they were the stock of a trader or dealer.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; Along with the chess pieces, there were 14 plain round tablemen for the game of [[Tables (board game)|tables]] and one belt buckle, all made of ivory, making a total of 93 artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Robinson|2004|pp=5, 36, 54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Almost all of the pieces in the collection are carved from walrus ivory, with a few made instead from [[Toothed whales|whale teeth]]. The 78&lt;ref&gt;93 per BM now&lt;/ref&gt; pieces consist of eight [[king (chess)|king]]s, eight [[queen (chess)|queen]]s, 16 [[bishop (chess)|bishop]]s, 15 [[knight (chess)|knight]]s, 12 [[rook (chess)|rook]]s and 19 [[pawn (chess)|pawn]]s.  The heights of the pawns range from 3.5 to 5.8&amp;nbsp;cm, while the other pieces are between 7 and 10.2&amp;nbsp;cm. Although there are 19 pawns (a complete set requires 16), they have the greatest range of sizes of all the pieces, which has suggested that the 78 pieces might belong to at least five sets.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; All the pieces are sculptures of human figures, with the exception of the pawns, which are smaller, geometric shapes.  The knights are mounted on rather diminutive horses and are shown holding spears and shields.  The rooks are standing soldiers or warders holding shields and swords; four of the rooks are shown as wild-eyed [[berserker]]s biting their shields with battle fury.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Some pieces bore traces of red stain when found, indicating that red and white were used to distinguish the two sides, rather than the black and white used in modern chess.&lt;ref name=dlmnyt/&gt;
[[Image:lewis-chessmen08.jpg|thumb|left|The Lewis chessmen in the British Museum]]

Scholars have observed that, to the modern eye, the figural pieces, with their bulging eyes and glum expressions, have a distinct comical character.&lt;ref name="Robinson, pp. 37-41"&gt;Robinson, pp. 37–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Stratford, ''The Lewis chessmen and the enigma of the hoard'' (The British Museum Press, 1997), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true of the single rook with a worried, sideways glance (front right of first image below, next to queen) and the berserkers biting their shields, which have been called "irresistibly comic to a modern audience".&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed, however, that the comic or sad expressions were not intended or perceived as such by the makers, to whom these images instead displayed strength, ferocity or, in the case of the queens who hold their heads with a hand and seemingly pensive expression, "contemplation, repose and possibly wisdom".&lt;ref name="Robinson, pp. 37-41"/&gt;

== Modern discovery ==
The chessmen were discovered in early 1831 in a sand bank at the head of [[Camas Uig]] on the west coast of the Isle of Lewis, in the [[Outer Hebrides]] of Scotland.  There are various local stories concerning their arrival and modern discovery on Lewis.

Malcolm "Sprot" MacLeod ({{lang-gd|Calum an Sprot}}) from the nearby [[Ardroil|township of Pennydonald]] discovered the trove in a small stone [[cist|kist]] in a dune, exhibited them briefly in his [[barn|byre]] and sold them on to Captain Roderick Ryrie.&lt;ref name=burn/&gt;  One reported detail, that it was a cow that actually unearthed the stash, is generally discounted in [[Uig, Lewis|Uig]] as fabrication.  After the Isle of Lewis was purchased by Sir [[James Matheson]] in 1844, Malcolm Macleod and his family [[Highland Clearances|were evicted]] and the district was transformed into sheep farms.

== Exhibition and ownership ==
[[File:Lewis chessmen 23.JPG|thumb|A queen and a warder (rook) in the joint exhibition in [[Edinburgh]], 2010]]
They were exhibited by Ryrie at a meeting of the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]], on 11 April 1831. The chessmen were soon after split up, with 10 being purchased by [[Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe]] and the others (67 chessmen and 14 [[tables (board game)|tablemen]]) purchased on behalf of the [[British Museum]] in [[London]].

Kirkpatrick Sharpe later found another bishop to take his collection up to eleven, all of which were later sold to [[Albert Denison, 1st Baron Londesborough|Lord Londesborough]]. In 1888, they were again sold, but this time the purchaser was the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]], who donated the pieces to the Royal Scottish Museum in [[Edinburgh]].  The eleven are now on display in the [[National Museum of Scotland]].

Of the pieces given to the British Museum, most can be found in Room 40, with the registration numbers M&amp;ME 1831, 11–1.78–159.  Others have been lent to Scottish museums and temporary exhibitions.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; A range of wooden or plastic replicas are popular items in the Museum shops.

The chessmen were number 5 in the list of British archaeological finds selected by experts at the [[British Museum]] for the 2003 BBC Television documentary ''[[Our Top Ten Treasures]]'', presented by [[Adam Hart-Davis]].  They feature in the 2010 BBC Radio 4 series ''[[A History of the World in 100 Objects]]'' as number 61, in the "Status Symbols" section.

An exhibition entitled "The Lewis Chessmen: Unmasked", which includes chesspieces from both the National Museum of Scotland and British Museum collections, along with other relevant objects, toured Scotland in 2010–2011. The exhibition opened in Edinburgh on 21 May 2010 and proceeded to Aberdeen, [[Shetland]], and the Museum nan Eilean in [[Stornoway]], opening there on 15 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-13085170 "Lewis Chessman exhibition opens in Stornoway museum"]. BBC. Retrieved 15 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exhibition entitled "The Game of Kings: Medieval Ivory Chessmen from the Isle of Lewis" at [[The Cloisters]] in New York City included 34 of the chess pieces, all on loan from the British Museum. The exhibit ended on 22 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/18/arts/design/the-game-of-kings-medieval-ivory-chessmen-from-the-isle-of-lewis-at-the-cloisters.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=cloisters&amp;st=cse |title=Ken Johnson, "Medieval Foes With Whimsey," New York Times, Nov. 18, 2011 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=18 November 2011 |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 April 2013, £1.8 million from the European Regional Development Fund was granted to transform [[Lews Castle]], on the Isle of Lewis, into a Museum for the Western Isles. Around £14 million in total is to be spent on restoring and converting the property, which has been shut for almost twenty-five years.  When completed the permanent displays will include six of the Lewis Chessmen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2013/04/investment-in-museum-03042013 "New funding announced for Lews Castle Museum"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dispute over location ==
[[Image:Chess01.jpg|thumb|Lewis chessmen in the [[National Museum of Scotland]]]]
In 2007–2008 a dispute arose regarding the most appropriate place to display the pieces. The issue first arose&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/7159656.stm|title=Moves to unite historic chessmen|date=2007-12-24|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; late in 2007 with calls from [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) politicians in the Western Isles (notably Councillor Annie Macdonald, MSP [[Alasdair Allan]] and MP [[Angus MacNeil]]) for the return of the pieces to the place they were found. [[Linda Fabiani]], the Scottish [[Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture]], stated that "it is unacceptable that only 11 Lewis Chessmen rest at the [[National Museum of Scotland]] while the other 67 (as well as the 14 tablemen) remain in the British Museum in London."

[[Richard Oram]], Professor of Medieval and Environmental History at the [[University of Stirling]], agreed, arguing that there was no reason for there to be more than "a sample" of the collection in London.  Both points of view have been dismissed by [[Margaret Hodge]], the UK [[Minister of State]] in the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], writing "It's a lot of nonsense, isn't it?"&lt;ref name=burn&gt;Burnett, Allan (3 February 2008) "Stalemate". Glasgow. ''The Sunday Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The local historical society in Uig, ''Comann Eachdraidh Uig'', which operates a registered museum near the find site featuring detailed information about the chessmen and Norse occupation in Lewis, has indicated publicly that it has no intention of pursuing any claim to the ownership of the pieces and does not support demands for them to be sent to Edinburgh, but would welcome short-term loans.&lt;ref&gt;Uig News, February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, twenty-four of the pieces from London and six from Edinburgh began a 16-month tour of various locations in Scotland. The tour was partly funded by the [[Scottish Government]], and [[Michael Russell (politician)|Mike Russell]], the [[Minister for Culture and External Affairs]], stated that the Government and the British Museum had "agreed to disagree" on their eventual fate. [[Bonnie Greer]], the museum's deputy chairman, said that she "absolutely" believed the main collection should remain in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cornwell |first=Tim |date=2 October 2009 |title=Chessmen 'will never come home' |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/chessmen-will-never-come-home-1-778018 |work=The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lotte Lehmann Foundation''', named for the German soprano [[Lotte Lehmann]], was founded in 1999,&lt;ref name=afterlife/&gt; and served to preserve and perpetuate her legacy, and to honor her dream of bringing [[art song]] into the lives of as many people as possible. The organization was founded by Gary Hickling, a musician and expert on Lehmann. Hickling was also the founder of the Lotte Lehmann League, which currently exists as a website.&lt;ref name=league&gt;[http://www.lottelehmannleague.org Lotte Lehman League], a website which includes material on Lehmann's career&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inception and history==
Founder Gary Hickling had met [[Lotte Lehmann]] in the early 1960s when he was a [[double bass]] player at university, observing the private voice lessons Lehmann gave at Orplid, her home in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]. He later observed her [[master classes]] at the [[Music Academy of the West]], which she had helped found in 1947.

Hickling became a noted expert on Lehmann's career and work, compiling a Lehmann discography in 1987.  He continued to compile and collect material and memorabilia relating to her career, which now forms a significant part of the Lotte Lehmann Archive in Santa Barbara.  The foundation's precursor, the Lotte Lehmann League, published a newsletter from 1989 to 1994; the league was later re-established as a website in 2011.&lt;ref name=league/&gt;

Hickling founded the Lotte Lehmann Foundation in 1999.&lt;ref name=afterlife/&gt; In the early years of its existence, he was solely responsible for maintaining it.

Operations of the foundation were transferred from Hawaii, where Hickling lived, to New York City in 2003.  The composer [[Daron Hagen]] was chosen as the newly configured foundation's president, and an entirely new board of directors was chosen at that time. Mezzo soprano Linn Maxwell was elected president in 2007. Larry Smith was president beginning in 2010. Hickling retired from the foundation in 2005 and became an emeritus member of the Board of Directors.

As of 2016, the foundation is in hiatus.&lt;ref name=afterlife&gt;lottelehmannleague.org. [http://lottelehmannleague.org/about-lotte-lehmann/ll-afterlife/ Lotte Lehmann “Afterlife”]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1988, Hickling has hosted a weekly program on [[art song]]s on [[Hawaii Public Radio]], initially titled ''Great Songs'', and from 2011 titled ''Singing and Other Sins''. Information and listenable archives of the program are hosted on the Lotte Lehmann League website.

==Activities==
The Lehmann Foundation was a respected non-profit musical foundation in the United States.  Its activities included two competitions, the first of which, the internet-based CyberSing vocal competition occurred every two years and solicited recordings from singers the world over.&lt;ref&gt;lottelehmann.org. [http://www.lottelehmann.org/llf/programs/cybersing/about.html About Cybersing]&lt;/ref&gt;  Entrants submitted recordings of appropriate literature, including a song written expressly for the competition by a distinguished composer.  These songs were commissioned from composers such as [[Ned Rorem]], [[Libby Larsen]] and [[Dan Welcher]].  Winners were chosen solely on the basis of their recorded submissions.  Laureates of the 2006 competition included sopranos Debra Stanley and Danielle Talamantes and baritone Andrew Garland.

The [[ASCAP]]/Lotte Lehmann Foundation Song Cycle Competition, which occurred in alternating years with CyberSing, solicited compositions by young composers resident in or native of the United States; winners received commissions to compose individual songs or, in the case of the First Prize recipient, a song cycle.&lt;ref&gt;lottelehmann.org. [http://www.lottelehmann.org/llf/programs/ascapllf Programs]&lt;/ref&gt;  Winners of the 2005 competition included Scott Gendel and Mark Buntag.  Gendel's prize-winning commission, the [[song cycle]] ''The Space Between'' was published by E. C. Schirmer and premiered by soprano Martha Guth and pianist Bradley Moore on 24 February 2007 at the Bruno Walter Auditorium in New York under the auspices of the Joy in Singing Foundation.

VoxNova Media was another aspect of the foundation's activities.&lt;ref&gt;lottelehmann.org. [http://lottelehmann.org/llf/about/ About the Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;  The mission of this division was to produce media in a variety of forms, including audio recordings, video recordings, printed materials. VNM plan was to reissue historical audio recordings by Lehmann and her colleagues, present new recordings of contemporary vocal repertoire and of the vocal art of contemporary interpreters.

In addition to these programs and activities, the foundation presented an annual World of Song Award which alternated among composers, singers, and collaborative pianists and served to recognize those who have devoted their creative lives to this enriching form of music.&lt;ref&gt;lottelehmann.org.[http://www.lottelehmann.org/llf/programs/worldofsong "World of Song"]&lt;/ref&gt; Recipients include pianist and educator John Wustman, composers [[Dominick Argento]] and [[Ned Rorem]], pianists [[Dalton Baldwin]] and [[Graham Johnson (musician)|Graham Johnson]], tenor [[Hugues Cuénod]], mezzo soprano [[Janet Baker]], and baritone [[Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau]]. The foundation also published ''SongScape'', a biannual newsletter edited by board member Craig Urquhart and featuring news of the foundation's activities.

'''Lumi''' is a [[Los Angeles]]-based company founded by Jesse Genet and Stephan Ango that manufactures [[packaging]] and [[brand]]ed supplies. The company got its start developing '''Inkodye''', a photo-reactive [[vat dye]] that develops its color through exposure to UV or sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Photochemical compositions and processes utilizing salts of para-amino triphenylacetonitriles|date=10 May 1960|url=http://www.google.com.au/patents/US2936276|inventor-last=Lyman|inventor-first=Chalkley|issue=US2936276 A|accessdate=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Jesse Genet began experimenting with different printing techniques as a teenager in 2004, attempting to print photographs on cotton T-shirts.&lt;ref name="Fleishman"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2013/03/solar-dye | title=Here comes the sun | first=Glenn | last=Fleishman | date=2013-03-02 | accessdate = 2013-06-04 | publisher = [[The Economist]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsatisfied with the results of [[screen printing]] and [[dye-sublimation]] she pursued her research and found what became a precursor to Inkodye, a chemical formula from the 1950s owned by a retired engineer.&lt;ref name="Fleishman" /&gt; After meeting Stephan Ango while studying at [[Art Center College of Design]], the pair acquired the chemical formula and began modernizing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.good.is/posts/wearable-instagram-can-two-designers-revolutionize-photo-printing/ | title=Wearable Instagram: Can Two Designers Revolutionize Photo Printing? | first=Zak | last=Stone | date=2012-08-13 | accessdate = 2013-06-04 | publisher = [[Good Worldwide|GOOD]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lumi launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign in December 2009&lt;ref name="kickstarter"&gt;{{cite web|author=Launched: Dec. 23, 2009 |url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lumi/lumi-co-a-new-textile-printing-technology |title=Lumi Co. – A NEW TEXTILE PRINTING TECHNOLOGY&amp;nbsp;— Kickstarter |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date=2009-12-23 |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; to fund [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] of the technology. The company raised $13,597 and rewarded its backers with wallets, bags and other products printed using the process. The project was an early success for the Kickstarter platform&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/10100885 | title=Cash-strapped entrepreneurs get creative | first=Claire | last=Prentice | date=2010-05-12 | accessdate = 2016-10-05 | publisher = [[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleishman" /&gt; and went on to win Kickstarter's Best Design Project of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/best-design-project | title = Best Design Project » The Kickstarter Blog — Kickstarter | date=2011-01-12 | accessdate = 2013-06-04 | publisher = [[Kickstarter]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, Lumi launched a second Kickstarter campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Launched: Jun. 30, 2012 |url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lumi/print-on-fabric-using-sunlight-the-lumi-process |title=Print on Fabric Using Sunlight: The Lumi Process by Lumi — Kickstarter |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date=2012-06-30 |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an initial fundraising target of $50,000 to commercialize its printing process, Inkodye. The project was successfully funded, reaching over 500% of the initial target and raising a total of $268,437. Rewards included Inkodye printing kits allowing users to create personalized photographic prints on cotton and other natural materials. In February 2015, Lumi appeared on ABC's [[Shark Tank]] and received 2 offers, but Genet did not accept either of the offers.

In March 2015, Lumi announced its new software platform, [https://www.lumi.com Lumi.com], for designing and ordering custom-made [[packaging]] and [[brand]]ing tools such as [[rubber stamp]]s. The service was funded by seed capital firm [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]].&lt;ref name="ycombinator"&gt;{{cite web|author=Launched: Mar. 5, 2015 |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/05/yc-backed-lumi-will-help-you-customize-anything-literally-anything-on-the-cheap/ |title=YC-Backed Lumi Will Help You Customize Anything  |publisher=Techcrunch.com |date=2015-03-05 |accessdate=2015-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lumi's platform was inspired by the challenges the company had faced in producing packaging for Inkodye.&lt;ref name="shopfronts"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.fastcompany.com/3063332/meet-lumi-the-company-thats-making-mailers-the-new-shopfronts | title=Meet Lumi, The Company That's Making Mailers The New Shopfronts | first=Elizabeth | last=Segran | date=2016-09-26 | accessdate = 2016-10-05 | publisher = [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform was compared to other services such as ''Blackbox'' by [[Cards Against Humanity]] and ''Make That Thing!'' by [[TopatoCo]], provided by companies that also found success via Kickstarter and looked to simplify fulfillment and manufacturing for others.&lt;ref name="warehouse"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.fastcompany.com/3063809/startup-report/warehouse-on-demand | title=Warehouse On Demand | first=Glenn | last=Fleishman | date=2016-09-26 | accessdate = 2016-10-05 | publisher = [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inkodye Process==
{{Alternative photography}}
The process of printing with Inkodye resembles that of other [[Alternative process|alternative photographic processes]] though its chemistry is related to [[vat dye]]s such as [[indigo]] rather than iron or silver-based chemicals used in [[cyanotype]] or [[Van Dyke brown (printing)|Van dyke brown]] which have higher toxicity. Inkodye is available in several colors (red, orange, copper, blue, navy, magenta, plum, sepia and black) which can be mixed together and diluted with water.

A monochromatic [[Digital negative (transparency)|digital negative]] is first printed on transparency film generally using an inkjet printer with black ink only. The negative is made to be the same size as the final print. Inkodye is then applied to the desired T-shirt or fabric in its undeveloped state. The negative is placed on top of the sensitized fabric and exposed to sunlight or UV light. Exposure times vary from 3 to 15 minutes depending on the desired color and intensity of light.&lt;ref name="Ray Laury"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Imagery on Fabric: A Complete Surface Design Handbook|first=Jean|last=Ray Laury|publisher=C&amp;T Publishing|year=2010|isbn=1-57120-034-7|pages=122–123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TZexEXQM_sIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Imagery+on+Fabric&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0BIxTumIJoXUiAKosqGiBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exposure to sunlight develops the dye's color and binds it to the fabric. The final step is to wash out the unexposed dye using a [[washing machine]] and [[laundry detergent]].&lt;ref name="Lhotka"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Last Layer: New methods in digital printing for photography, fine art, and mixed media|first=Bonny Pierce|last=Lhotka|publisher=New Riders|year=2013|isbn=978-0321905406|pages=185–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lüqiu Luwei''' ({{zh|c=闾丘露薇|p=Lǘqiū Lùwēi}}, born 19 September 1969), also known as '''Rose Luqiu''', is a Chinese television journalist and the executive news editor for [[Phoenix Television]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profile/roseluqiuluwei|title=Rose Luqiu Luwei|publisher=[[The Guardian]] | location=London|date=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first female reporter to cover the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 Afghan war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://net3.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppww/eng/schedule.php|title=Program schedule|publisher=Pulitzer Prize Winners Workshop|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reportsitem.aspx?id=100296|title=Blogging News in China|publisher=[[Nieman Foundation for Journalism]]|author=Luqiu Luwei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Lüqiu was born into an ordinary worker's family in [[Shanghai]] on September 19, 1969. Her father Lüqiu Zhiyi ({{lang|zh|闾丘志毅}}) is a veteran. Her parents divorced when she was four years old. Her mother went to [[Shenzhen]] and she lived with her paternal grandparents.  
Lüqiu entered into No. 2 High School of [[East China Normal University]] in 1982, where she worked on the Shanghai Middle school students press corps and later became the head. In 1988, Lüqiu was admitted to [[Fudan University]]. On graduation from university, she taught herself accounting and was hired by an accounting company [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]. In 1995, she moved to [[Hong Kong]] with her husband and became an interpreter at a television station named Chinese Television Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=A Ping ({{lang|zh|阿平}})|author2=Cao Yaqi ({{lang|zh|曹亚旗}})|author3=Wang Zhaohui ({{lang|zh|王肇辉}}) |date=2008 |script-title=zh:《青年文摘》 |trans-title=Youth Literary Digest |language=zh |pages=198–204 |script-chapter=zh:《闾丘露薇：硝烟中的战地玫瑰》 |chapter=Lüqiu Luwei: Rose in the Battlefield|location=Beijing |publisher=China Youth Press |isbn=978-7-5006-6472-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, she joined Phoenix Television and became one of its first reporters. At Phoenix satellite TV, she interviewed statesmen, such as President [[Hu Jintao]], Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] and many foreign leaders in different countries and broadcast on events both at home and abroad. She has been to Europe, America and Asia and interviewed of President [[Jiang Zemin]], Premier [[Zhu Rongji]] and [[George W. Bush]], the former US President.

In 2001, she was the first woman-journalist who headed to [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]] to broadcast on the events there following the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States. In February 2002 and end of the year, she had been to Afghanistan for two times. She became the only Chinese woman-journalist who had been to Afghanistan for three times. In 2003, the [[Iraq War of 2003]] broke out. She was the only one woman journalist broadcasting live from the center of [[Baghdad]] where the US army bombed.

In 2007 Lüqiu was awarded a [[Nieman Fellowship]] by the [[Nieman Foundation for Journalism]], at [[Harvard University]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/NiemanFoundation/NiemanFellowships/MeetTheFellows/AlumniFellows.aspx#2007|title=Alumni Fellows|publisher=[[Nieman Foundation for Journalism]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She has written several books, such as ''Rose in the Journey'' and ''Not Telling East and West''. In these books, she expresses her attitude towards life and abundant experiences.

'''Mannerism''', also known as '''Late Renaissance''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=IFMohetegAcC&amp;pg=PT330&amp;dq=mannerism+late+renaissance&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR39KL6P_XAhVXOMAKHTUJAc0Q6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=mannerism%20late%20renaissance&amp;f=false A World history of architecture] and [https://books.google.it/books?id=nHzqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=mannerism+late+renaissance&amp;dq=mannerism+late+renaissance&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR39KL6P_XAhVXOMAKHTUJAc0Q6AEIJDAA Mannerism: the painting and style of the Late Renaissance]&lt;/ref&gt; is a style in [[European art]] that emerged in the later years of the Italian [[High Renaissance]] around 1520, spreading by about 1530 and lasting until about the end of the 16th century in Italy, when the [[Baroque]] style largely replaced it. [[Northern Mannerism]] continued into the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg 1971, 483.&lt;!--If this statement can be found in the third edition of 1993, it would be preferable to cite from that edition, which is cited elsewhere in this same article.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Painting style|Stylistically]], Mannerism encompasses a variety of approaches influenced by, and reacting to, the harmonious ideals associated with artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]], and early [[Michelangelo]]. Where High Renaissance art emphasizes proportion, balance, and ideal beauty, Mannerism exaggerates such qualities, often resulting in compositions that are asymmetrical or unnaturally elegant.&lt;ref name= "ReferenceC "&gt;Gombrich 1995, {{Page needed|date=April 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The style is notable for its intellectual sophistication as well as its artificial (as opposed to naturalistic) qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/zino/hd_zino.htm |title=Mannerism: Bronzino (1503–1572) and his Contemporaries|publisher= Metropolitan Museum of Art|date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It favors compositional tension and instability rather than the balance and clarity of earlier Renaissance painting. Mannerism in literature and music is notable for its highly florid style and intellectual sophistication.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Art and Illusion, E. H. Gombrich, {{ISBN|9780691070001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of Mannerism and the phases within it continue to be a subject of debate among art historians. For example, some scholars have applied the label to certain early modern forms of literature (especially poetry) and music of the 16th and 17th centuries. The term is also used to refer to some late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] painters working in northern Europe from about 1500 to 1530, especially the [[Antwerp Mannerism|Antwerp Mannerists]]—a group unrelated to the Italian movement. Mannerism has also been applied by analogy to the [[Classical Latin|Silver Age of Latin literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsconnected.org/resource/93691/the-mannerist-style-and-the-lamentation|title=the-mannerist-style |publisher=www.artsconnected.org|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
[[File:Laocoon Pio-Clementino Inv1059-1064-1067.jpg|thumb|230px|Mannerism role-model: ''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]'', an ancient sculpture, rediscovered in 1506; now in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. The artists of Mannerism greatly admired this piece of sculpture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;]]

The word ''mannerism'' derives from the Italian ''maniera'', meaning "style" or "manner". Like the English word "style", ''maniera'' can either indicate a specific type of style (a beautiful style, an abrasive style) or indicate an absolute that needs no qualification (someone "has style").&lt;ref&gt;
John Shearman, “Maniera as an Aesthetic Ideal”, in Cheney 2004, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second edition of his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'' (1568), [[Giorgio Vasari]] used ''maniera'' in three different contexts:  to discuss an artist's manner or method of working; to describe a personal or group style, such as the term ''maniera greca'' to refer to the Byzantine style or simply to the ''maniera'' of Michelangelo; and to affirm a positive judgment of artistic quality.&lt;ref&gt;Cheney 1997, 17.&lt;!--The pagination may be different in the 1997 edition from the 2004 one found as the main entry in the reference list. Be sure the right one is being cited. Ideally, only one edition should be cited unless there is information in the earlier missing in the later edition.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Vasari was also a Mannerist artist, and he described the period in which he worked as "la maniera moderna", or the "modern style".&lt;ref&gt;Briganti 1961, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; James V. Mirollo describes how "bella maniera" poets attempted to surpass in virtuosity the sonnets of Petrarch.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mirollo 1984, {{Page needed|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion of "bella maniera" suggests that artists who were thus inspired looked to copying and bettering their predecessors, rather than confronting nature directly. In essence, "bella maniera" utilized the best from a number of source materials, synthesizing it into something new.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

As a stylistic label, "Mannerism" is not easily defined. It was used by Swiss historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] and popularized by German [[Art history|art historians]] in the early 20th century to categorize the seemingly uncategorizable art of the Italian 16th century — art that was no longer found to exhibit the harmonious and rational approaches associated with the High Renaissance. “High Renaissance” connoted a period distinguished by harmony, grandeur and the revival of classical antiquity. The term Mannerist was redefined in 1967 by [[John Shearman]]&lt;ref&gt;Shearman 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; following the exhibition of Mannerist paintings organised by [[Fritz Grossmann]] at [[Manchester Art Gallery|Manchester City Art Gallery]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Grossmann 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The label “Mannerism” was used during the 16th century to comment on social behaviour and to convey a refined virtuoso quality or to signify a certain technique.
However, for later writers, such as the 17th-century Gian Pietro Bellori, "la maniera" was a derogatory term for the perceived decline of art after Raphael, especially in the 1530s and 1540s.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth 1962, 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 19th century on, art historians have commonly used the term to describe art that follows Renaissance classicism and precedes the Baroque.

Yet historians differ as to whether Mannerism is a style, a movement, or a period; and while the term remains controversial it is still commonly used to identify European art and culture of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;

==Origin and development==
[[File:Dividing water from Heaven.jpg|thumb|230px|Collected figures, ignudi, from Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling]]

By the end of the High Renaissance, young artists experienced a crisis:&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; it seemed that everything that could be achieved was already achieved. No more difficulties, technical or otherwise, remained to be solved. The detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, physiognomy and the way in which humans register emotion in expression and gesture, the innovative use of the human form in figurative composition, the use of the subtle gradation of tone, all had reached near perfection. The young artists needed to find a new goal, and they sought new approaches.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} At this point Mannerism started to emerge.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The new style developed between 1510 and 1520 either in Florence,&lt;ref name="friedlaender"&gt;Friedländer 1965,{{Page needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in Rome, or in both cities simultaneously.&lt;ref name="freedberg175"&gt;Freedberg 1993, 175–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins and role models===
This period has been described as a "natural extension"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; of the art of [[Andrea del Sarto]], Michelangelo, and Raphael. Michelangelo developed his own style at an early age, a deeply original one which was greatly admired at first, then often copied and imitated by other artists of the era.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; One of the qualities most admired by his contemporaries was his ''terribilità'', a sense of awe-inspiring grandeur, and subsequent artists attempted to imitate it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Other artists learned Michelangelo's impassioned and highly personal style by copying the works of the master, a standard way that students learned to paint and sculpt. His [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] provided examples for them to follow, in particular his representation of collected figures often called ''[[ignudi]]'' and of the [[Libyan Sibyl]], his [[vestibule (Architecture)|vestibule]] to the [[Laurentian Library]], the figures on his [[Medici]] tombs, and above all his ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|Last Judgment]]''. The later Michelangelo was one of the great role models of Mannerism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Young artists broke in to his house and stole drawings from him.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Giorgio Vasari, Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects'', Giorgio Vasari noted that Michelangelo stated once: "Those who are followers can never pass by whom they follow".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

====The competitive spirit====

The competitive spirit was cultivated by patrons who encouraged sponsored artists to emphasize virtuosic technique and to compete with one another for commissions. It drove artists to look for new approaches and dramatically illuminated scenes, elaborate clothes and compositions, elongated proportions, highly stylized poses, and a lack of clear perspective. Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were each given a commission by Gonfaloniere [[Piero Soderini]] to decorate a wall in the Hall of Five Hundred in Florence. These two artists were set to paint side by side and compete against each other, fueling the incentive to be as innovative as possible.

===Early mannerism===
[[File:Jacopo Pontormo 004.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Jacopo Pontormo]], ''Entombment'', 1528; Santa Felicità, Florence]]
The early Mannerists in Florence—especially the students of [[Andrea del Sarto]] such as [[Jacopo da Pontormo]] and [[Rosso Fiorentino]] who are notable for elongated forms, precariously balanced poses, a collapsed perspective, irrational settings, and theatrical lighting. [[Parmigianino]] (a student of [[Antonio da Correggio|Correggio]]) and [[Giulio Romano]] (Raphael’s head assistant) were moving in similarly stylized aesthetic directions in Rome.  These artists had matured under the influence of the High Renaissance, and their style has been characterized as a reaction to or exaggerated extension of it. Instead of studying nature directly, younger artists began studying Hellenistic sculpture and paintings of masters past. Therefore, this style is often identified as "anti-classical”,&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer 1965,{{Page needed|date=September 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; yet at the time it was considered a natural progression from the High Renaissance. The earliest experimental phase of Mannerism, known for its "anti-classical" forms, lasted until about 1540 or 1550.&lt;ref name="freedberg175" /&gt; Marcia B. Hall, professor of art history at Temple University, notes in her book ''After Raphael'' that Raphael's premature death marked the beginning of Mannerism in Rome.

In past analyses, it has been noted that mannerism arose in the early 16th century contemporaneously with a number of other social, scientific, religious and political movements such as the [[Heliocentrism|Copernican model]], the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]], and the [[Protestant Reformation]]'s increasing challenge to the power of the Catholic Church. Because of this, the style's elongated forms and distorted forms were once interpreted as a reaction to the idealized compositions prevalent in High Renaissance art.&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;Manfred Wundram, "Mannerism," Grove Art Online. Oxford University Press, [accessed 23 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation for the radical stylistic shift c. 1520 has fallen out of scholarly favor, though early Mannerist art is still sharply contrasted with High Renaissance conventions; the accessibility and balance achieved by Raphael's ''[[The School of Athens|School of Athens]]'' no longer seemed to interest young artists.

===High maniera===
The second period of Mannerism is commonly differentiated{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} from the earlier, so-called "anti-classical" phase.
Subsequent mannerists stressed intellectual conceits and artistic virtuosity, features that have led later critics to accuse them of working in an unnatural and affected "manner" (''maniera''). Maniera artists looked to their older contemporary Michelangelo as their principal model; theirs was an art imitating art, rather than an art imitating nature. Art historian [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]] argues that the intellectualizing aspect of maniera art involves expecting its audience to notice and appreciate this visual reference—a familiar figure in an unfamiliar setting enclosed between "unseen, but felt, quotation marks".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The height of artifice is the Maniera painter's penchant for deliberately misappropriating a quotation. [[Agnolo Bronzino]] and [[Giorgio Vasari]] exemplify this strain of Maniera that lasted from about 1530 to 1580. Based largely at courts and in intellectual circles around Europe, Maniera art couples exaggerated elegance with exquisite attention to surface and detail: porcelain-skinned figures recline in an even, tempered light, acknowledging the viewer with a cool glance, if they make eye contact at all. The Maniera subject rarely displays much emotion, and for this reason works exemplifying this trend are often called 'cold' or 'aloof.' This is typical of the so-called "stylish style" or ''Maniera'' in its maturity.&lt;ref&gt;
Shearman 1967, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread of mannerism==
[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Surrey 1546.jpg|thumb|230px|English Mannerism: [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]], 1546, a rare English Mannerist portrait by a Flemish immigrant]]

The cities Rome, Florence, and Mantua were Mannerist centers in Italy. Venetian painting pursued a different course, represented by [[Titian]] in his long career.  A number of the earliest Mannerist artists who had been working in Rome during the 1520s fled the city after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527. As they spread out across the continent in search of employment, their style was disseminated throughout Italy and Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Briganti 1961, 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the first international artistic style since the [[Gothic art|Gothic]].&lt;ref&gt;Briganti 1961, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Other parts of Northern Europe did not have the advantage of such direct contact with Italian artists, but the Mannerist style made its presence felt through prints and illustrated books. European rulers, among others, purchased Italian works, while northern European artists continued to travel to Italy, helping to spread the Mannerist style. Individual Italian artists working in the North gave birth to a movement known as the [[Northern Mannerism]]. [[Francis I of France]], for example, was presented with [[Bronzino]]'s ''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]''. The style waned in Italy after 1580, as a new generation of artists, including the [[Accademia degli Incamminati|Carracci]] brothers, [[Caravaggio]] and [[Cigoli]], revived naturalism. [[Walter Friedlaender]] identified this period as "anti-mannerism", just as the early mannerists were "anti-classical" in their reaction away from the aesthetic values of the High Renaissance&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer 1957, {{Page needed|date=September 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and today the Carracci brothers and Caravaggio are agreed to have begun the transition to Baroque-style painting which was dominant by 1600.

Outside of Italy, however, Mannerism continued into the 17th century. In France, where Rosso traveled to work for the court at [[School of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]], it is known as the "[[Henry II style]]" and had a particular impact on architecture. Other important continental centers of [[Northern Mannerism]] include the court of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] in [[Prague]], as well as [[Haarlem]] and [[Antwerp]]. Mannerism as a stylistic category is less frequently applied to [[England|English]] visual and decorative arts, where native labels such as "[[Elizabethan]]" and "[[Jacobean era|Jacobean]]" are more commonly applied. Seventeenth-century Artisan Mannerism is one exception, applied to architecture that relies on pattern books rather than on existing precedents in Continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson 1983, 157–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular note is the Flemish influence at Fontainebleau that combined the eroticism of the French style with an early version of the vanitas tradition that would dominate seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish painting. Prevalent at this time was the "pittore vago," a description of painters from the north who entered the workshops in France and Italy to create a truly international style.

==Sculpture==
As in painting, early Italian Mannerist sculpture was very largely an attempt to find an original style that would top the achievement of the [[High Renaissance]], which in sculpture essentially meant Michelangelo, and much of the struggle to achieve this was played out in commissions to fill other places in the [[Piazza della Signoria]] in Florence, next to [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]''. [[Baccio Bandinelli]] took over the project of ''[[Hercules and Cacus]]'' from the master himself, but it was little more popular then than it is now, and maliciously compared by [[Benvenuto Cellini]] to "a sack of melons", though it had a long-lasting effect in apparently introducing relief panels on the [[pedestal]] of statues.  Like other works of his and other Mannerists it removes far more of the original block than Michelangelo would have done.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 179–182&lt;/ref&gt;  Cellini's bronze ''[[Perseus with the head of Medusa]]'' is certainly a masterpiece, designed with eight angles of view, another Mannerist characteristic, and artificially stylized in comparison with the ''David''s of Michelangelo and Donatello.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 183–187&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a goldsmith, his famous gold and enamel [[Cellini Salt Cellar|Salt Cellar]] (1543) was his first sculpture, and shows his talent at its best.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;

Small bronze figures for collector's [[Cabinet (room)|cabinets]], often mythological subjects with nudes, were a popular Renaissance form at which [[Giambologna]], originally [[Flemish]] but based in Florence, excelled in the later part of the century. He also created life-size sculptures, of which two entered the collection in the Piazza della Signoria. He and his followers devised elegant elongated examples of the ''[[figura serpentinata]]'', often of two intertwined figures, that were interesting from all angles.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 194–202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early theorists==
[[File:Pietro Francavilla - Apollo Victorious over the Python - Walters 27302.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Pietro Francavilla]], ''Apollo Victorious over the Python'', 1591. [[The Walters Art Museum]]]]

===Giorgio Vasari===
[[Giorgio Vasari]]'s opinions about the art of painting emerge in the praise he bestows on fellow artists in his multi-volume ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'': he believed that excellence in painting demanded refinement, richness of invention (''invenzione''), expressed through virtuoso technique (''maniera''), and wit and study that appeared in the finished work, all criteria that emphasized the artist's intellect and the patron's sensibility. The artist was now no longer just a trained member of a local Guild of St Luke. Now he took his place at court alongside scholars, poets, and humanists, in a climate that fostered an appreciation for elegance and complexity. The coat-of-arms of Vasari's [[Medici]] patrons appears at the top of his portrait, quite as if it were the artist's own. The framing of the woodcut image of [[Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'' would be called "[[Jacobean era|Jacobean]]" in an English-speaking milieu. In it, Michelangelo's Medici tombs inspire the anti-architectural "architectural" features at the top, the papery pierced frame, the satyr nudes at the base. As a mere frame it is extravagant: Mannerist, in short.

===Gian Paolo Lomazzo===
Another literary figure from the period is [[Gian Paolo Lomazzo]], who produced two works—one practical and one metaphysical—that helped define the Mannerist artist's self-conscious relation to his art. His ''Trattato dell'arte della pittura, scoltura et architettura'' (Milan, 1584) is in part a guide to contemporary concepts of [[decorum]], which the Renaissance inherited in part from Antiquity but Mannerism elaborated upon. Lomazzo's systematic codification of aesthetics, which typifies the more formalized and academic approaches typical of the later 16th century, emphasized a consonance between the functions of interiors and the kinds of painted and sculpted decors that would be suitable. Iconography, often convoluted and abstruse, is a more prominent element in the Mannerist styles. His less practical and more metaphysical ''Idea del tempio della pittura'' (''The ideal temple of painting'', Milan, 1590) offers a description along the lines of the "four temperaments" theory of human nature and personality, defining the role of individuality in judgment and artistic invention.

==Some Mannerist artists==
[[File:Angelo Bronzino - Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time - National Gallery, London.jpg|thumb|230px|High Mannerism: ''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]'' by [[Bronzino]], c. 1545; [[National Gallery|National Gallery, London]].]]

The Dragon seems of sino-oriental influence.]]

===Jacopo da Pontormo===
[[Pontormo|Jacopo da Pontormo]]'s ''Joseph in Egypt'' features what would in the Renaissance have been considered incongruous colors and an incoherent handling of time and space.

===Rosso Fiorentino and the School of Fontainebleau===
[[Rosso Fiorentino]], who had been a fellow pupil of Pontormo in the studio of [[Andrea del Sarto]], in 1530 brought Florentine mannerism to [[Fontainebleau]], where he became one of the founders of French 16th-century Mannerism, popularly known as the "[[School of Fontainebleau]]".

The examples of a rich and hectic decorative style at Fontainebleau further disseminated the Italian style through the medium of [[engraving]]s, to [[Antwerp]] and from there throughout Northern Europe from London to Poland. Mannerist design was extended to luxury goods like silver and carved furniture. A sense of tense, controlled emotion expressed in elaborate symbolism and [[allegory]], and an ideal of female beauty characterized by elongated proportions are features of this style.

===Agnolo Bronzino===
Mannerist portraits by [[Bronzino|Agnolo Bronzino]] are distinguished by a serene elegance and meticulous attention to detail. As a result, Bronzino's sitters have been said to project an aloofness and marked emotional distance from the viewer. There is also a virtuosic concentration on capturing the precise pattern and sheen of rich textiles.

===Alessandro Allori===
[[Alessandro Allori]]'s (1535–1607) ''Susanna and the Elders'' (''below'') is distinguished by latent eroticism and consciously brilliant still life detail, in a crowded, contorted composition.

===Tintoretto===
[[Tintoretto]]'s ''Last Supper'' (below) focuses on light and motion, bringing the image to dramatic life.  Unlike more traditional views of the Last Supper, Tintoretto depicts Heaven opening up into the room, and the [[angel]]s looking on in awe, in line with the old Catholic maxim that "If the angels were capable of envy, they would envy the Eucharist."

===El Greco===
[[El Greco]] attempted to express [[religious]] emotion with exaggerated traits. After the realistic depiction of the human form and the mastery of perspective achieved in high Renaissance Classicism, some artists started to deliberately distort proportions in disjointed, irrational space for emotional and artistic effect. El Greco still is a deeply original artist. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  Key aspects of Mannerism in El Greco include the jarring "acid" palette, elongated and tortured anatomy, irrational perspective and light, and obscure and troubling iconography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg29/gg29-over1.html |title=National Gallery of Art – El Greco |publisher=Nga.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/grec/hd_grec.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art El Greco (Domenikos Theotokopoulos) (1541–1614) |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benvenuto Cellini===

[[Benvenuto Cellini]] created the [[Cellini Salt Cellar]] of gold and enamel in 1540 featuring [[Poseidon]] and [[Amphitrite]] (water and earth) placed in uncomfortable positions and with elongated proportions. It is considered a masterpiece of Mannerist sculpture.

===Joachim Wtewael===
[[Joachim Wtewael]] (1566–1638) continued to paint in a Northern Mannerist style until the end of his life, ignoring the arrival of the Baroque, and making him perhaps the last significant Mannerist artist still to be working.  His subjects included large scenes with still life in the manner of [[Pieter Aertsen]], and mythological scenes, many small [[cabinet painting]]s beautifully executed on copper, and most featuring nudity.

===Giuseppe Arcimboldo===
[[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]] (also spelled ''Arcimboldi'') is known for his portraits contrived from a [[still life]] composition

==Mannerist architecture==
Mannerist architecture was characterized by visual trickery and unexpected elements that challenged the renaissance norms.&lt;ref name=vanda&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/style-guide-mannerism/ |title=Style Guide: Mannerism  |date= |website= |publisher=Victoria and Albert |access-date=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flemish artists, many of whom had traveled to Italy and were influenced by Mannerist developments there, were responsible for the spread of Mannerist trends into Europe north of the Alps, including into the realm of architecture. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Art|last=Wundram|first=Manfred|publisher=Grove|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period, architects experimented with using architectural forms to emphasize solid and spatial relationships. The Renaissance ideal of harmony gave way to freer and more imaginative rhythms. The best known architect associated with the Mannerist style, and a pioneer at the [[Laurentian Library]], was [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vSfOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT2&amp;dq=michelangelo+pioneered+mannerist+style#v=onepage&amp;q=michelangelo%20pioneered%20mannerist%20style&amp;f=false|page=Foreward|nopp=true|title=Michelangelo: 240 Colour Plates|isbn=9788892577916|last1=Peitcheva|first1=Maria|date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is credited with inventing the [[giant order]], a large pilaster that stretches from the bottom to the top of a façade.&lt;ref&gt;{{verify source|date=July 2014}}{{Citation | title= Pilaster Play|author= [[Mark Jarzombek]]| journal=  Thresholds | url= http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/thresholds28.pdf | volume= 28 (Winter 2005)|  pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used this in his design for the [[Campidoglio]] in Rome.

Prior to the 20th century, the term ''Mannerism'' had negative connotations, but it is now used to describe the historical period in more general non-judgmental terms.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Hauser. ''Mannerism: The Crisis of the Renaissance and the Origins of Modern Art''. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,1965).&lt;/ref&gt;  Mannerist architecture has also been used to describe a trend in the 1960s and 1970s that involved breaking the norms of modernist architecture while at the same time recognizing their existence.&lt;ref name=venturi/&gt; Defining mannerist in this context, architect and author [[Robert Venturi]] wrote "Mannerism for architecture of our time that acknowledges conventional order rather than original expression but breaks the conventional order to accommodate complexity and contradiction and thereby engages ambiguity unambiguously." &lt;ref name=venturi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://designtheory.fiu.edu/readings/venturi_architecture_as_signs.pdf |title=Architecture as Signs and Systems |last1=Venturi |first1=Robert |access-date=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance examples===

An example of mannerist architecture is the [[Villa Farnese]] at [[Caprarola]].&lt;ref&gt;Coffin David, ''The Villa in the Life of Renaissance Rome'', Princeton University Press, 1979: 281–85&lt;/ref&gt; in the rugged country side outside of [[Rome]]. The proliferation of engravers during the 16th century spread Mannerist styles more quickly than any previous styles.

Dense with ornament of "Roman" detailing, the display doorway at Colditz Castle exemplifies this northern style, characteristically applied as an isolated "set piece" against unpretentious vernacular walling.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

From the late 1560s onwards, many buildings in [[Valletta]], the new capital city of [[Malta]], were designed by the architect [[Girolamo Cassar]] in the Mannerist style. Such buildings include [[St. John's Co-Cathedral]], the [[Grandmaster's Palace (Valletta)|Grandmaster's Palace]] and the seven original [[Langue (Knights Hospitaller)#Valletta|auberges]]. Many of Cassar's buildings were modified over the years, especially in the [[Baroque]] period. However, a few buildings, such as [[Auberge d'Aragon]] and the exterior of St. John's Co-Cathedral, still retain most of Cassar's original Mannerist design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellul |first1=Michael |title=In search of Girolamo Cassar: An unpublished manuscript at the State Archives of Lucca |journal=Melita Historica |date=2004 |volume=XIV |issue=1 |page=37 |url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.14(2004-07)/MH.14(2004)1/02.pdf |issn=1021-6952 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313191703/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.14%282004-07%29/MH.14%282004%291/02.pdf |archivedate=13 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mannerism in literature and music==

{{See also|Metaphysical poets}}
In English literature, Mannerism is commonly identified with the qualities of the "Metaphysical" poets of whom the most famous is [[John Donne]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The witty sally of a Baroque writer, [[John Dryden]], against the verse of Donne in the previous generation, affords a concise contrast between Baroque and Mannerist aims in the arts:

{{quote|He affects the metaphysics, not only in his satires but in his amorous verses, ''where nature only'' should reign; and ''perplexes the minds'' of the fair sex with ''nice''&lt;ref&gt;'Nice' in the sense of 'finely reasoned.'&lt;/ref&gt; ''speculations'' of philosophy when he should ''engage their hearts'' and entertain them with the softnesses of love.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1957"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gardner, Helen |title=Metaphysical Poets |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zS_EXPFEtKwC&amp;q=dryden#v=snippet&amp;q=dryden&amp;f=false |publisher=Oxford University Press, London |year=1957 |accessdate=2014-08-15|isbn=9780140420388 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} (italics added)}}

The rich musical possibilities in the poetry of the late 16th and early 17th centuries provided an attractive basis for the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], which quickly rose to prominence as the pre-eminent musical form in Italian musical culture, as discussed by [[Tim Carter (musicologist)|Tim Carter]]:

{{quote|The madrigal, particularly in its aristocratic guise, was obviously a vehicle for the ‘stylish style’ of Mannerism, with poets and musicians revelling in witty conceits and other visual, verbal and musical tricks to delight the connoisseur.&lt;ref&gt;Carter 1991, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The word Mannerism has also been used to describe the style of highly florid and [[counterpoint|contrapuntally]] complex [[polyphonic]] music made in France in the late 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1946–47, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This period is now usually referred to as the ''[[ars subtilior]]''.

===Mannerism and theatre===
''The Early Commedia dell'Arte (1550–1621): The Mannerist Context'' by Paul Castagno discusses Mannerism's effect on the contemporary professional theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Castagno 1992,{{Page needed|date=June 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Castagno's was the first study to define a theatrical form as Mannerist, employing the vocabulary of Mannerism and maniera to discuss the typification, exaggerated, and effetto meraviglioso of the comici dell'arte. See Part II of the above book for a full discussion of Mannerist characteristics in the commedia dell'arte. The study is largely iconographic, presenting a pictorial evidence that many of the artists who painted or printed commedia images were in fact, coming from the workshops of the day, heavily ensconced in the maniera tradition.

The preciosity in [[Jacques Callot]]'s minute engravings seem to belie a much larger scale of action. Callot's ''Balli di Sfessania'' (literally, dance of the buttocks) celebrates the commedia's blatant eroticism, with protruding phalli, spears posed with the anticipation of a comic ream, and grossly exaggerated masks that mix the bestial with human. The eroticism of the innamorate (lovers) including the baring of breasts, or excessive veiling, was quite in vogue in the paintings and engravings from the second school at Fontainebleau, particularly those that detect a Franco-Flemish influence. Castagno demonstrates iconographic linkages between genre painting and the figures of the commedia dell'arte that demonstrate how this theatrical form was embedded within the cultural traditions of the late cinquecento.&lt;ref&gt;Castagno 1994, {{Page needed|date=June 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Commedia dell'arte, ''disegno interno'', and the ''discordia concors''====
Important corollaries exist between the ''disegno interno'', which substituted for the ''disegno esterno'' (external design) in mannerist painting. This notion of projecting a deeply subjective view as superseding nature or established principles (perspective, for example), in essence, the emphasis away from the object to its subject, now emphasizing execution, displays of virtuosity, or unique techniques. This inner vision is at the heart of commedia performance. For example, in the moment of improvisation the actor expresses his virtuosity without heed to formal boundaries, decorum, unity, or text. Arlecchino became emblematic of the mannerist ''discordia concors'' (the union of opposites), at one moment he would be gentle and kind, then, on a dime, become a thief violently acting out with his batte. Arlecchino could be graceful in movement, only in the next beat, to clumsily trip over his feet. Freed from the external rules, the actor celebrated the evanescence of the moment; much the way Cellini would dazzle his patrons by draping his sculptures, unveiling them with lighting effects and a sense of the marvelous. The presentation of the object became as important as the object itself.

=== Neo-Mannerism ===
According to art critic [[Jerry Saltz]], "Neo-Mannerism" (new Mannerism) is among several clichés that are "squeezing the life out of the art world".&lt;ref name="saltz"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Jerry Saltz on Art’s Insidious New Cliché: Neo-Mannerism |last=Saltz |first=Jerry |authorlink=Jerry Saltz |url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/jerry-saltz-on-arts-insidious-new-clich.html |publisher=Vulture |date=10 October 2013 |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neo-Mannerism describes art of the 21st century that is turned out by students whose academic teachers "have scared [them] into being pleasingly meek, imitative, and ordinary".&lt;ref name="saltz" /&gt;

===Television===
Giedroyc appeared in one episode of ''[[Gimme Gimme Gimme (TV series)|Gimme Gimme Gimme]]'', playing a receptionist at a hotel. She was also a presenter on Channel 4's ''[[RI:SE]]''.

Giedroyc was in one episode of ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]''.

Giedroyc is best known for comedy and presenting work with [[Sue Perkins]]. The two women met while students at the [[University of Cambridge]] and were members of the [[Footlights]] comedy club. [[Mel and Sue]], the duo were short-listed for the ''[[Daily Express]]'' Best Newcomers Award at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] in 1993. Their first presenting roles saw them host a lunchtime show on [[Channel 4]] called ''[[Light Lunch]]'' (and the early evening version, ''Late Lunch'').

Giedroyc was the sixth student to be voted out of ''[[Comic Relief Does Fame Academy]]'' and was a celebrity judge on the 2007 edition of ''[[Making Your Mind Up (TV series)|Making Your Mind Up]]'' along with [[John Barrowman]]. She starred as one of the presenters in the show ''Eurobeat: Almost Eurovision!'' at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] and subsequently in the West End at the [[Novello Theatre]].

The '''Opera Awards''' is an singing competition, for professional Australian opera singers. It was established in 1986 with the purpose of assisting and developing professional Australian opera singers. This is achieved through programs of study with selected international educational institutions, engagements with professional opera companies, as well as through introduction, networking and educational opportunities with prominent members of the international operatic community.

The Opera Awards consists of a group of awards, including the YMF Australia Award and the Armstrong-Martin Scholarship, amongst others.  Major sponsors and supporters of the Awards have included YMF Australia, the Armstrong-Martin Estate, Haas Foundation, The [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera]] (UK), the [[Royal Over-Seas League]] (UK) and the [[Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust]].

== History ==
In 1986/87, [[Music &amp; Opera Singers Trust|Music &amp; Opera Singers Trust Limited]] (MOST®) created the 'Opera Awards' as a competition within the [[Australian Singing Competition|Australian SInging Competition]], and then as a separate, stand-alone competition in 2001.

The competition provides cash prizes, scholarships and career opportunities to professional Australian opera singers, enabling the study of grand opera and related music overseas.

Since 2007, the primary award within the Opera Awards is the YMF Australia Award, sponsored by YMF Australia. The recipient of the 'Opera Awards' actually receives a group of awards, scholarships and opportunities which include the YMF Australia Award, the Armstrong-Martin Scholarship, the Haas Foundation Award and the Editorial Resources Prize.

'Runners up'  receive prizes and opportunities which include (in 2011) The Royal Over-Seas League (UK) Music Bursary, the Britten-Pears Young Artists Programme, the Glyndebourne Festival Prize, and the 4MBS Classic FM Award.

The recipient of the Opera Awards (Australia) is acknowledged and invited to perform at the Finals Concert of the [[Australian Singing Competition]].

'''Padraic Colum''' (8 December 1881 – 11 January 1972) was an Irish poet, novelist, dramatist, biographer, playwright, children's author and [[folklore|collector of folklore]]. He was one of the leading figures of the [[Irish Literary Revival]].

==Early life==
[[File:Padraic Colum in the 1900s.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Portrait drawing of Colum by [[John Butler Yeats|John B. Yeats]], 1900s]]

Colum was born '''Patrick Columb''' in a [[County Longford]] workhouse, where his father worked. He was the first of eight children born to Patrick and Susan Columb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=30 April 2012 4:17:03 AM #.26# |url=http://www.poemhunter.com/padraic-colum |title=Biodata |publisher=Poemhunter.com |accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the father lost his job in 1889, he moved to the United States to participate in the [[Colorado gold rush]]. Padraic and his mother and siblings remained in Ireland. When the father returned in 1892, the family moved to [[Glasthule]], near [[Dublin]], where his father was employed as Assistant Manager at [[Sandycove and Glasthule railway station]]. His son attended the local [[National school (Ireland)|national school]].

When Susan Columb died in 1897, the family was temporarily split up. Padraic (as he would be known) and one brother remained in Dublin, while their father and remaining children moved back to Longford. Colum finished school the following year and at the age of seventeen, he passed an exam for and was awarded a clerkship in the [[Irish Railway Clearing House]]. He stayed in this job until 1903.

During this period, Colum started to write and met a number of the leading Irish writers of the time, including [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Lady Gregory]] and [[George William Russell|Æ]]. He also joined the [[Gaelic League]] and was a member of the first board of the [[Abbey Theatre]]. He became a regular user of the [[National Library of Ireland]], where he met [[James Joyce]] and the two became lifelong friends. During the riots caused by the Abbey Theatre's production of ''[[The Playboy of the Western World]]'', Padraic Colum's father, Patrick Columb, was one of the protestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/synge-s-opening-night-to-remember-1.1291816|title=Synge's opening night to remember|newspaper=The Irish Times|access-date=2017-02-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Padraic himself was not engaged in the protests, although he did pay his father's fine afterwards.

He collected Irish folk songs, and sometimes rewrote them almost in their entirety, including the famous ''[[She Moved Through the Fair]]''. Colum based his poem on one surviving line, while his collaborator, the musicologist [[Herbert Hughes (musicologist)|Herbert Hughes]] noted the tune.&lt;ref&gt;"SHE MOVED THROUGH THE FAIR". (9 April 1970). ''The Irish Times''&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a five-year scholarship by a wealthy American benefactor, Thomas Hughes Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bc.edu/libraries/newsletter/2014spring/colum.html|title=Boston College Libraries Newsletter - Spring 2014|last=chrishp|website=www.bc.edu|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used it to read, study and write. He did not attend University College Dublin, or any other University as a student.

==Early poetry and plays==
He was awarded a prize by [[Cumann na nGaedheal (1900)|Cumann na nGaedheal]] for his anti-enlistment play, ''The Saxon Shillin'''. Through his plays he became involved with the National Theatre Society and became involved in the founding of the [[Abbey Theatre]], writing several of its early productions. His first play, ''Broken Soil'' (revised as The Fiddler's House) (1903) was performed by [[W. G. Fay's Irish National Dramatic Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Fay: The Fays of the Abbey Theatre. 1935. p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Land'' (1905), was one of that theatre's first great public successes. He wrote another important play for the Abbey named ''Thomas Muskerry'' (1910).

His earliest published poems appeared in ''The United Irishman'', a paper edited by [[Arthur Griffith]]. His first book, ''Wild Earth'' (1907) collected many of these poems and was dedicated to Æ. He published several poems in [[Arthur Griffith]]'s paper, ''[[The United Irishman]]'' this time, with ''The Poor Scholar'' bringing him to the attention of [[William Butler Yeats|WB Yeats]]. He became a friend of Yeats and [[Augusta, Lady Gregory|Lady Gregory]].  In 1908, he wrote an introduction to the [[Everyman's Library]] edition of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]''.

In 1911, with [[Mary Colum|Mary Gunning Maguire]], a student from UCD, and David Houston and [[Thomas MacDonagh]], he founded the short-lived literary journal ''The Irish Review'', which published work by Yeats, [[George A. Moore|George Moore]], [[Oliver St John Gogarty]], and many other leading Revival figures.

In 1912 he married Maguire. Padraic taught at [[Pádraig Pearse]]'s experimental school, [[St. Enda's School|Scoil Éanna]] in Rathfarnham, County Dublin and Mary Maguire taught at the girls' school, Scoil Íde or St. Ita's, which was set up in Cullenswood House, Ranelagh, Dublin, once Scoil Éanna had moved to Rathfarnham.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://limerick100.wordpress.com/2014/10/16/i-care-not-if-my-life-has-only-the-span-of-a-night-and-a-day-if-my-deeds-be-spoken-of-by-the-men-of-ireland-padraic-colums-thoughts-on-pearse-and-macdonagh-1916/|title=Spotlight: Padraic Colum’s thoughts on Pearse and MacDonagh (1916)|last=@Limerick1914 in Art, Education, Politics, Religion, Spotlight|first=|date=16 October 2014|website=History is what we choose to remember Researching Limerick 100 years ago, Slavery, Memory, Power|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first the couple lived in the Dublin suburb of [[Donnybrook, Dublin|Donnybrook]], where they held a regular Tuesday literary salon. They then moved to [[Howth]], a small fishing village just to the north of the capital. In 1914, they travelled to the US for what was intended to be a visit of a few months but lasted most the rest of their lives.

==Later life and work==
In America, Colum took up children's writing and published a number of collections of stories for children, beginning with ''[[The King of Ireland's Son]]'' (1916). This book came about when Colum started translating an Irish folk tale from [[Irish language|Gaelic]] because he did not want to forget the language. After it was published in the [[New York Tribune]], Hungarian Illustrator [[Willy Pogany]] suggested the possibility of a book collaboration, so Colum wove the folktale into a long, epic story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Critical History of Children's Literature |last=Viguers |first=Ruth Hill |authorlink= |author2=Cornelia Meigs (ed.) |year=1969 |publisher=Macmillan Publishing co. |location= |isbn=0-02-583900-4 |page=426 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of his books for children were awarded retrospective citations for the [[Newbery Honor]]. A contract for children's literature with [[Macmillan Publishers]] made him financially secure for the rest of his life. Some other books he wrote are ''The Adventure of Odysseus'' (1918) and ''The Children of Odin'' (1920). These works are important for bringing classical literature to children.

In 1922 he was commissioned to write versions of Hawaiian folklore for young people. This resulted in the publication of three volumes of his versions of tales from the islands. At the suggestion of Dr Pádraic Whyte (School of English, Trinity College Dublin) a first edition of the first volume (''At the Gateways of the Day'') was presented to US president Barack Obama by Taoiseach Enda Kenny on the occasion of his visit to Dublin, Ireland on 23 May 2011.&lt;ref name="IT28May2011"&gt;{{cite web

The Colums spent the years from 1930 to 1933 living in Paris and [[Nice]], where Padraic renewed his friendship with [[James Joyce]] and became involved in the transcription of ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.

After their time in France, the couple moved to New York City, where they did some teaching at [[Columbia University]] and [[CCNY]]. Colum was a prolific author and published a total of 61 books, not counting his plays. He adopted the form of [[Noh]] drama in his later plays.

While in New York, he wrote the screenplay for the 1954 stop-motion animated film [[Hansel and Gretel: An Opera Fantasy|Hansel and Gretel]].  It was his only screenplay. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0173365/&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary died in 1957 and Padraic finished ''Our Friend James Joyce'', which they had worked on together. It was published in 1958. Colum divided his later years between the United States and Ireland. In 1961 the Catholic Library Association awarded him the [[Regina Medal]]. He died in [[Enfield, Connecticut]], age 90, and was buried in [[St. Fintan's Cemetery, Sutton]].

In 1965, Colum sold the notebooks, manuscripts, galley proofs, and letters that were in his apartments in New York and Dublin to the [[Binghamton University|Binghamton University Libraries]].  He wished to make whatever resources he could available to scholars of Irish literature and history.&lt;ref&gt;http://slipknot.binghamton.edu/?p=collections/findingaid&amp;id=5746&amp;q=&amp;rootcontentid=38960&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked how to say his name, he told ''The [[Literary Digest]]'' the last name was the same as the word ''column''. "In my first name, the first ''a'' has the sound of ''au''.  The ordinary pronunciation in Irish is ''pau'drig''."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Earle Funk]], ''What's the Name, Please?'', Funk &amp; Wagnalls, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The application was developed by two former [[GMW Architects|GMW Computers]] employees who had been involved with  Sonata. After Sonata had "disappeared in a mysterious, corporate black hole, somewhere in eastern Canada in 1992,"&lt;ref name=Crotty71&gt;Crotty, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Ingram and colleague Gerard Gartside then went on to develop Reflex, bought for $30 million by Parametric Technology Corporation ([[PTC (software company)|PTC]]) in July 1996.&lt;ref name=Crotty71 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Parametric+Technology+Corporation+acquires+object-oriented+software...-a018490068 Parametric Technology Corporation acquires object-oriented software technology for project modeling and management] PTC news release dated 11 July 1996 (archived at FreeLibrary.com). Retrieved: 17 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

PTC had identified the architecture, engineering and construction market as a target for its parametric modelling solutions, and bought Reflex to expand into the sector. However, the fit between Reflex and PTC's existing solutions was poor, and PTC's Pro/Reflex gained little market traction; PTC then sold the product to another US company, [[The Beck Group|Beck Construction]], in 1997,&lt;ref name=Crotty72&gt;Crotty, p.72&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Some accounts of the date of this transaction vary: Beck Technology, originally an internal group within Beck Construction, says it acquired the intellectual property rights to Reflex from PTC in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beck-technology.com/about_us.html Beck Technology: About us], Beck Technology. Accessed: 17 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}} where it formed the kernel of a parametric estimating package called DESTINI.&lt;ref name=Weisberg /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobilitytechzone.com/news/2006/12/19/2179097.htm BIM software integrates RSMeans for project costing], ''Mobility Techzone'', December 19, 2006. Retrieved: 17 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, several people from PTC set up a new company, Charles River Software (renamed [[Autodesk Revit|Revit]] Technology Corporation in 2000, later (2002) bought by [[Autodesk]]).&lt;ref name=Crotty72 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weisberg&gt;Weisberg, David (2008), ''The Engineering Design Revolution: The People, Companies and Computer Systems That Changed Forever the Practice of Engineering''. Chapter 16. Available [http://cadhistory.net/ online].

A '''riding coat''' or '''jacket''' is a garment originally designed as outerwear for [[Equestrianism|horseback riding]]. It protects the wearer's upper clothes from dirt and wear and in some cases provide additional protection in the case of falls.

==History==
===East Asia===
{{main|Magua (clothing)|label 1=Magua}}
The [[Manchu people|Manchu]] "[[magua (clothing)|horse jacket]]" (''magua'') was a dark blue riding coat worn by [[Manchuria]]n horsemen before becoming a staple item of [[menswear]] across the [[Qing Empire]]. It subsequently developed into the [[Burmese clothing|Burmese]] [[taikpon]] and the [[Chinese clothing|Chinese]] [[tangzhuang]].

===Britain===

{{main article|Mackintosh}}
Original waterproof designs – similar to a [[mackintosh]] – generally comprised a full-length coat with wide skirt and leg straps to keep it in place. Other typical features included a belted waist, large patch pockets with protective flap, [[raglan sleeve]]s with tab and wind cuff, fly front, throat tab and a broad collar.

In 1823 [[Charles Macintosh]] (1766–1843) patented his invention for waterproof rubberised cloth, pressing together two sheets of cotton material with dissolved India-rubber sandwiched in between. It was a brilliant idea for making any fabric weatherproof, and the very first macintosh coats were made at the family's dyestuffs factory, Charles Macintosh and Co of Glasgow.

The rubber processing pioneer [[Thomas Hancock (inventor)|Thomas Hancock]] (1786–1865) was aware of Macintosh’s work and in 1825 he took out a licence to manufacture the patented "waterproof double textures". For historical background, refer to the hardback "The Hancocks of Marlborough"&lt;ref&gt;"The Hancocks of Marlborough" by John Loadman &amp; Francis James, Oxford University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and website "Bouncing Balls", author John Loadman&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bouncing-balls.com/timeline/people/nr_hancock.htm Bouncing-Balls.com, author John Loadman]&lt;/ref&gt;

Using masticated scrap rubber instead, Hancock's solutions had a higher rubber content than those of Macintosh and so could more readily give a uniform film on the cloth, minimising water penetration and odour.

Eventually the two men co-operated, so that in 1831 Hancock became a partner in Charles Macintosh &amp; Co and their two companies merged. One feature of the co-operation was the construction of an automated spreading machine to replace Macintosh’s original paint brushes. In 1834 Hancock's London factory burned down and Macintosh had already closed the Glasgow factory, hence all the work transferred to Manchester. See the "Virtual Encyclopedia of Greater Manchester"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/celebs/scientists4.html Papillon Graphics' Virtual Encyclopedia of Greater Manchester]&lt;/ref&gt;

From then on, the manufacturing of "proper" raincoats or macs impervious to all weathers – constructed of two layers of rubber-coated cotton fabric or "double textured" – was concentrated, with all necessary expertise and experience, in Manchester or the Lancastrian cotton towns. There such rubber or rubberised products amounted to a "cottage industry", as confirmed by the abundance of company records in the National Archives at Kew, Surrey.

Classic, belted, double-textured trench coats in off-white or fawn for riding or walking were fashionable prior to World War 2 until the end of the century as a specifically British fashion, flattering the human form and enhancing its magnetism. To see typical wartime usage, a good reference is [[Danger UXB]] ([[Anthony Andrews]]), Thames Television's acclaimed drama series first broadcast in the late 1970s, or the 1976 movie [[The Eagle Has Landed (film)]] ([[Donald Sutherland]]). The military flavour of rubberised raincoats continued with the 1997 programme [[Bodyguards (TV series)]] (as sported by [[John Shrapnel]] playing Commander MacIntyre of the elite protection team).

A model pictured in the December 1944 issue of [[Vogue (magazine)]] showed the attractiveness and practicality of these macs for the fashion-conscious, whilst they appeared in favourite 1950s and 1960s feature films such as [[Genevieve (film)]] (1953) (worn by [[Dinah Sheridan]]), [[Me and the Colonel]] (1958) ([[Nicole Maurey]]) and [[Twice Round the Daffodils]] (1962) ([[Sheila Hancock]]), always sharp, clean, rustling and making a bold statement.

Meanwhile, traditional gentlemen's outfitters such as Cordings, [[Hackett London|Hackett]] and [[Gieves &amp; Hawkes]] continued to sell plenty of smart walking coats in thick rubberised cotton, very popular at the time. Common in Britain around 1960 were neat zipper jackets for young and old, frequently with pinched waist, and hooded anoraks in the same materials - the latter in dark green for scouting, hiking, climbing, canoeing and yet more of the great outdoors.

Developing on from that, double-textured "gangster" macs were the must-have, trendy outerwear for girls with chutzpah around 1970, having originated with the Valstar "Gangster" brand designed by Maurice Attwood.

Featuring a signature yoke front and back, a belt and peplum, and wriststraps with buckles, these styles were sold in a range of colours, different lengths, and either cotton or viscose, at major high street stores like Debenhams (under their Debroyal brand) and C&amp;A (Vivienne style) at prices from £10 to £20. The snazzy yoked design was all the rage among the younger set, even appearing in suitably small sizes for daughters proud to copy their mums.

This or a similar style of rainwear graced the foremost actors and actresses of the time. Cinema films included [[Country Dance (film)]] (1970) ([[Susannah York]]), [[Hoffman (film)]] (1970) ([[Sinéad Cusack]]), No Blade of Grass (1970) ([[Nigel Davenport]], [[Jean Wallace]], [[Lynne Frederick]]), The Ragman's Daughter (1972) ([[Victoria Tennant]]) and [[All Creatures Great and Small (film)]] (1974) ([[Lisa Harrow]], [[Simon Ward]]). Examples of the many TV series in that period containing Valstar “Gangster” type double-textured rainwear were [[Take Three Girls]] ([[Liza Goddard]]), [[The Lotus Eaters (TV series)]] ([[Wanda Ventham]]) and [[Man About the House]] ([[Paula Wilcox]]).

Since they provided effective insulation against the cold, the garments were later called “winter macs” by females, who would wear them buttoned, with upturned short collar and - to complete the look - a neckerchief giving a bright, contrasting slash of colour.

The retro "gangster" style has been revived as the "Chorlton" in a choice of five colours by Lakeland Elements of Lancaster, since Chorlton-upon-Medlock, now part of Greater Manchester, was the location of one of the early macintosh factories.

Other design initiatives and variants over the years included the introduction of “light double-textured” and “single-textured” rubberised macs, again in many hues. There were ponchos, military-style capes and more recently the short, navy blue [[Margaret Howell]] hoody. Then, on the Continent of Europe, you would see the green hooded anorak or slicker, with yellow rubber lining, as worn by Anne-Laure Meury in the classic French relationship movie [[The Aviator's Wife]] (1981) and the similarly unisex Friesennerz reversible hooded anorak in yellow rubber with blue (sometimes fawn) lining, sold on Germany’s high streets and sported by [[Glenda Jackson]] in her 1978 film The Class of Miss MacMichael. Certainly the latter mac was beloved by young tourists of German nationality making pilgrimage to the fashion mecca of the Swinging Sixties, Carnaby Street in London W1.

"'''Saga Africa'''" (subtitled "'''Ambiance Secousse'''" in smaller letters on the single cover) is a song recorded by the former professional tennis player [[Yannick Noah]], released in 1991 as the first [[Single (music)|single]] from his debut album, ''Black &amp; What''. The song is also available on the singer's album entitled ''Live'', released in 2002.

==Background, writing, music and lyrics==
The album ''Black &amp; What'' was a success (certified [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]]), and the single "Saga Africa", that mixes a special and sporty dance (a kind of African caterpillar), became one of the summer hits in France. Yannick Noah created the surprise performing the song on December 2, 1991, at the Palais des Sports of [[Stade de Gerland|Gerland]], [[Lyon]], during the honour tour of the [[Davis Cup]] just after the victory of the French team that he was the captain, accompanied by his team for the dance.&lt;ref&gt;Elia Habib, ''Muz hit. tubes'', p. 210 ({{ISBN|2-9518832-0-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Yannick Noah composed the lyrics himself, a mixture of French and [[Cameroon]]ian expressions, while the rest of the album ''Black &amp; What'' is mainly in English. He deliberately sings with a relatively pronounced accent. The lyrics include a tribute to the footballers of the [[Cameroon national football team]] named Les Lions Indomptables, especially [[Roger Milla]], [[François Omam-Biyik]] and [[Thomas Nkono]], whose names are mentioned in the words. He also refers to Paris and [[Yaoundé]], soukouss and [[makossa]]. The music uses a sample of a [[Snap!]]'s song, "[[Mary Had a Little Boy]]".

==Chart performances==
The single was charted in France. It went straight to #6 on the [[SNEP|SNEP Singles Chart]] on June 1, 1991. It reached #2 two weeks later and stayed there for four not consecutive weeks, and was unable to dislodge at #1 first [[Mylène Farmer]]'s "[[Désenchantée]]", then [[Les Inconnus]]' "[[Auteuil, Neuilly, Passy]]". It totaled 15 weeks in the top ten and 22 weeks on the chart (Top 50).&lt;ref name="Lescharts"&gt;"Saga Africa (ambiance secousse)", in French Singles Chart [http://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Yannick+Noah&amp;titel=Saga+Africa&amp;cat=s Lescharts.com] (Retrieved May 6, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The single achieved [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] status awarded by the SNEP for a minimum of 250,000 copies sold.&lt;ref name="FrenchC"&gt;Yannick Noah's certifications in France [http://www.chartsinfrance.net/certifications/artiste-631.htm Chartsinfrance.net] (Retrieved May 6, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Infodisc website, the song was sold about 318,000 copies, remaining the second most successful song of the singer, behind "La Voix des Sages".&lt;ref&gt;Yannick Noah singles sales in France [http://www.infodisc.fr/S_Certif.php Infodisc.fr] (Retrieved May 6, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sandu Florea''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈsandu ˈflore̯a}}; born 28 June 1946) is a [[Romanian-American]] [[comic book]] and [[comic strip]] [[Comic book creator|creator]], also known as an [[inker]] and [[Illustration|book illustrator]]. A trained architect and a presence on the [[science fiction]] scene during the 1970s, he became a professional in the [[comics]] genre with albums such as ''Galbar'', and was allegedly the only artist to have obtained a steady income in this way during the [[Communist Romania|communist period]]. A prolific contributor to Romanian children's magazines, Florea had his activity curbed by [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]] when he first publicized his intention of emigrating to the United States. He eventually left the country shortly after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]], and soon after began collaborating with [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], [[DC Comics]] and other leading enterprises in the field of comic book publishing. He became especially noted for his activities as an inker, with contributions on series such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[The Executioner (book series)|The Executioner]]'', ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'' and ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl]]''.

Florea has maintained enduring contacts with his native country, and has taken an initiative in popularizing the [[American comic book]] style in Romania. He has been described as one of the most successful among his colleagues, and claimed to be one of the most recognizable Romanians in his field.

==Biography==

===Early life and career in Romania===
[[File:Galbar Sandu Florea.jpg|thumb|left|Scene from ''Galbar'' (1973)]]
Born in [[Ghelari]], [[Hunedoara County]], Sandu Florea first became interested in comics while in fifth grade, his first contact with the medium being through a copy of the [[France|French]] youth magazine ''[[Pif gadget|Pif Vaillant]]''.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"&gt;{{ro icon}} Petrina Calabalic, [http://old.banateanul.ro/articol/ziar/timisoara/cartoon-man/4064/ "Cartoon Man"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008123647/http://old.banateanul.ro/articol/ziar/timisoara/cartoon-man/4064/ |date=2011-10-08 }}, in ''[[Bănăţeanul]]'', December 6, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This encounter, he recalled in a 2004 interview, left him with "an impression that cannot be erased", and "the wish that I myself could draw such appealing and interesting characters."&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;

Sandu Florea published his first comic strip in 1968, with ''Luminiţa'' children's magazine. It was a series centered on the anecdotal hero classic ''[[Păcală]]''.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.icr.ro/sandu_florea ''Artistul Sandu Florea la Salonul European de Bandă Desenată''], [[Romanian Cultural Institute]] release; retrieved November 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Florea graduated from [[Bucharest]]'s [[Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urbanism|Architectural College]], and subsequently worked for a building design institute in his adoptive city of [[Timişoara]].&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; Before graduation, he had also published his first work in the comics genre, inspired by the [[Folklore of Romania|folkloric tale]] of ''[[Păcală]]'', and featured in a 1968 issue of ''Luminiţa'' magazine.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;

After moving to Timişoara, he became a noted presence among the local [[science fiction]] fan base, joining the [[H. G. Wells]] Literary Club founded by writer Ovidiu Şurianu.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; Their collaboration produced the 1973 ''Galbar'', reportedly the first Romanian [[Science fiction comics|science fiction comic book]].&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfnemira"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://proscris.110mb.com/Ps13-14/florea13.htm "Florea, Sandu"], entry in [[Editura Nemira]]'s ''Dicţionar SF'', 1999 (republished by [http://proscris.110mb.com/ ''Pro-Scris''] [[webzine]]); retrieved August 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, he and Timişoara native Marcel Luca published what is thought to be the first-ever Romanian [[coloring book]] with a science fiction subject, ''Vreau să fiu cosmonaut'' ("I Want to be a [[Cosmonaut]]"), which reputedly sold 45,000 copies.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; By then, having received offers of collaboration from two publishing houses ([[Editura Ion Creangă]] and Editura Facla), Florea settled back in Bucharest and focused exclusively on his work in comics and illustration.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt; Said to have been the most prolific comic book author active during the communist period, he had his work featured in almost all of the children's periodicals in print at the time.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was creating and publishing comic books dedicated to popular legends, such as a retake on [[Ion Creangă]]'s [[Fantasy literature|fantasy story]] ''[[Harap Alb]]'', or recounting episodes in [[History of Romania|Romanian history]] (involving [[Dacia]]n rulers [[Burebista]] and [[Decebalus]], [[Roman Emperor]] [[Trajan]],&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cpbatman"&gt;{{ro icon}} Cosmin Popan, [http://www.cotidianul.ro/batman_omorat_in_complicitate_cu_un_roman-65685.html "Batman, omorât în complicitate cu un român"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', November 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wallachia]]n [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Michael the Brave]]).&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt; Several single-issue albums in this category were based on texts by [[historical fiction]] author [[Radu Theodoru]], forming part of the series ''Strămoşii'' ("The Ancestors").&lt;ref name="sflambiek"&gt;[http://lambiek.net/artists/f/florea_sandu.htm "Sandu Florea (Romania)"], entry in [[Lambiek]]'s [http://lambiek.net/artists/ ''Comiclopedia'']; retrieved August 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The full list includes: ''Cavalerul alb'' ("The White Knight"; Editura Facla, 1976), ''Călugăreni'' (referencing the [[Battle of Călugăreni]]; Editura Ion Creangă, 1977), ''Misiune de sacrificiu'' ("Suicidal Mission"; Editura Ion Creangă, 1979), ''În lumea lui Harap Alb'' ("Inside Harap Alb's World"; [[Editura Sport-Turism]], 1979), ''Burebista, regele dacilor'' ("Burebista, King of the Dacians"; Editura Sport-Turism, 1980), ''{{lang|ro|Decebal şi Traian}}'' ("Decebalus and Trajan"; Editura Sport-Turism, 1981), ''{{lang|ro|Carusel}}'' ("Carousel"; Editura Sport-Turism, 1982), ''Sarmizegetusa eroică'' ("Heroic [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]]"; Editura Sport-Turism, 1983).&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt; Florea was also involved in creating Romania's own [[Western comics]], adapted from stories by Nicolae Frînculescu.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt;

These works received critical attention, both in Romania and abroad. ''În lumea lui Harap Alb'' earned him the a [[Eurocon]] award (1980).&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sflambiek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mhpremiile"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Michael Hăulică]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/FANTASY-SCIENCE-FICTION.-Premiile-care-au-fost*articleID_14094-articles_details.html "Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction. Premiile care au fost"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 290, October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This, literary critic [[Michael Hăulică]] notes, made Florea one in a final wave of Romanian Eurocon laureates to have emerged under communism (also including writers [[Vladimir Colin]], [[Ion Hobana]] and [[Gheorghe Săsărman]]).&lt;ref name="mhpremiile"/&gt;

Florea also received attention from celebrated poet [[Nichita Stănescu]], who discovered in ''{{lang|ro|Carusel}}'' an unclassifiable and imaginative work. The writer argued: "[Florea] introduces mystery where we usually had happy-endings, imagination where there was lyricism and an indecisive epic where there was nothing. The book he calls ''{{lang|ro|Carusel}}'' [...] is without precedent, in Romania and everywhere else."&lt;ref name="poeziebd"&gt;{{ro icon}} D. S., [http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-cultura-9933749-poezie-proiect-nichita-stanescu-sandu-florea-prinde-viata-muzeul-benzii-desenate.htm "Poezie BD: un proiect Nichita Stănescu – Sandu Florea prinde viaţă la Muzeul Benzii Desenate"], [[Hotnews.ro]], August 26, 2011; retrieved November 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, Stănescu began working with him on the album ''Semne şi desemne'' ("Signs and Designs"). Florea printed the [[Lithography|lithographs]] to go with the poems, but the project was cut short when Stănescu died (December 1983).&lt;ref name="poeziebd"/&gt;

===In the United States===
The 1984-1989 interval was described by Florea as "one of the most difficult periods in my life."&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; Having unsuccessfully demanded from communist authorities the right of leaving for the United States, where two of his siblings had already settled, Florea was exposed to political persecution, and the [[Censorship in Communist Romania|censorship apparatus]] lifted his right to publish, prompting him to contribute several comic strips under various pseudonyms.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; He returned to public attention after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]], when he was briefly editor in chief of the new children's magazine ''{{lang|ro|Carusel}}''.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sflambiek"/&gt; With Frînculescu, he also founded another such publication, called ''Proteus''.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;

Sandu Florea, his wife and two children eventually left for the United States in 1991, moving to [[New York City]]&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; and afterward settling in [[Long Island]].&lt;ref name="dnnautil"&gt;{{ro icon}} Dodo Niţă, [http://www.nautilus.nemira.ro/bd/batman-rip/ "''Batman R.I.P.''"], in [[Editura Nemira]]'s ''Nautilus'', March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially discouraged by the competition among comic book artists, Florea recounts, he decided to contact Marvel [[recruiter]]s within three months of his arrival, submitting a sample of his take on ''[[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]''.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; According to his own statement, [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] proved compatible with his talents: "[he was] the only Marvel character who did not fly, did not breathe fire and did not use psychic waves to defeat his enemies, being instead armed with a giant sword and axe. Since I had been drawing many historical tales back in the old country, Conan was a character whom I could depict in drawing with relative ease."&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;

He was accepted by Marvel soon after this, specialized as an inker, and began working on several of its main releases, including, alongside ''Conan'', ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' and the various spin-offs of ''[[avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'', ''[[Blackwulf]]'', ''[[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]'', ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Mighty Thor]]'', ''[[Captain America]]'', ''[[Doctor Strange]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' and ''[[X-Men]]''.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sflambiek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; He also worked with [[DC Comics]] (on ''[[Superman (vol. 2)|Superman Second Series]]'',&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'',&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cpbatman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; ''[[Justice Society of America]]'', ''[[Nightwing]]'')&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; and [[Dark Horse Comics]],&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cpbatman"/&gt; signing additional collaborations with [[Innovation Publishing]], Vivid Comics (on ''[[The Executioner (book series)|The Executioner]]'')&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt; and [[Chaos! Comics]] (''[[Lady Death]]'', ''[[Undertaker (comics)|Undertaker]]'').&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; Among the significant miniseries to which he contributed as an inker are ''[[X-Men: The End]]'' (2004–2006),&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'' (2008),&lt;ref name="cpbatman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; and ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl]]'' (2009).&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; His work with Dark Horse included ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''&lt;ref name="sfnemira"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sflambiek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; and ''[[List of Angel comics|Angel]]''.&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt; His artistic production also touched other media: Florea created [[storyboard]]s and other graphics for the motion picture producers [[Full Moon Features|Full Moon]], as well as book illustrations for ''[[The Princeton Review]]''.&lt;ref name="dnnautil"/&gt;

===2000s initiatives===
[[File:10.15.11SanduFloreaByLuigiNovi2.jpg|thumb|Florea looking over an aspiring artist's portfolio at the 2011 New York Comic Con.]]
Florea was selected honorary president of the Romanian Association of Comic Book Fans in 2001.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt; Speaking in 2004, he expressed interest in relaunching the native comic book genre in his native country, and in publishing a new children's periodical with original content.&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; In 2006, he participated in the relaunch of ''{{lang|ro|Carusel}}'', in a version argued by Hăulică to have been "professional under any definition."&lt;ref name="mhahbd"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Michael Hăulică]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/FANTASY-SCIENCE-FICTION.-Ah-BD*articleID_15202-articles_details.html "Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction. Ah, BD!"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 315, April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication, which went out of print after only two issues due to distribution problems, included [[Romanian-language]] reprints of American comics such as ''Conan the Barbarian'' and ''[[Aliens (Dark Horse Comics publications)|Aliens]]'', alongside original collaborations between Florea and his Romanian colleagues: ''Două paloşe'' ("Two [[Backsword]]s", with Florea as artist and György Györfi-Deák as writer), ''Ultima frontieră'' ("The Final Frontier", text by Florea, Marian Mirescu and Eddie Pandele, drawings by Daniel Rizea and Cătălin Gospodin), ''Toxic'' (text by Florea, drawings by Tudor Popa), ''Leviathan'' (written by Cristian Lăzărescu, illustrated by Florea).&lt;ref name="mhahbd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mhbd"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Michael Hăulică]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/FANTASY-SCIENCE-FICTION.-BD*articleID_13366-articles_details.html "Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction. BD"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 273, June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine also featured ''Borderland'', a comic series conceived especially for a Romanian public by writer [[John Warner (comics)|John Warner]] and illustrated by Florea, depicting the confrontation between three worlds: of the Mortals, of Magic and of the Demons.&lt;ref name="mhbd"/&gt; Around the same time, Sandu Florea also began contributing to various Romanian [[webzine]]s, such as ''Pro-Scris'', ''Imagikon'' and ''Paradox''—the latter of which published his strip ''Fortăreaţa'', based on a short story by Ovidiu Bufnilă.&lt;ref name="mhbd"/&gt; Several aspects related to the artist's new Romanian ventures were however criticized by Michael Hăulică. He argued that ''Toxic'' in particular was "weak and obvious", and noted that, in its featured edition, the text of ''Borderland'' evidenced its translator's poor command of the Romanian language.&lt;ref name="mhbd"/&gt;

These initiatives helped cement the artist's reputation in Romania. Sandu Florea claims to be "The only Romanian professional graphic artist who has managed to make a living exclusively out of his drawings, in the old country as well as [...] in America."&lt;ref name="pccartoon"/&gt; Dodo Niţă, a historiographer of Romanian comics and Florea's colleague at ''{{lang|ro|Carusel}}'',&lt;ref name="mhbd"/&gt; placed ''În lumea lui Harap Alb'' as fifth among an all-time chart of original Romanian works in the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ioana Calen, [http://www.cotidianul.ro/cartarescu_e_tras_in_banda_provocarea_desenata-12202.html "Cărtărescu e tras în bandă - Provocarea desenată"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', June 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2008 piece in the Romanian daily ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', Florea shares the distinction of "best known Romanian comic book artist" with [[Mircea Arapu]], the latter being known for his contribution in [[Franco-Belgian comics|Francophone comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Adrian Grama, Vlad Stoicescu, [http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/810028/Rahan-si-Pif-scapati-de-comunism/ "Rahan şi Pif, scăpaţi de comunism"], in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', June 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

An annual Romanian comic book [[fan convention]] in [[Constanţa]] awards the Sandu Florea Prize to artists with a long contribution in their field.&lt;ref name="icrartistul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} George Onofrei, [http://www.supliment.polirom.ro/article.aspx?article=4171 "Lucian Amarii a cîştigat Premiul ''Sandu Florea'' pentru BD.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6799">[[File:Spintriae aus Pompeji.jpg|thumb|350px|Spintriae from [[Pompeii]]]]

A '''spintria''' ([[plural]], ''spintriae'') is a small bronze or brass [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Token coin|token]], possibly for use in [[Lupanar|brothels]], although none of the literature on the ''spintriae'' contains any evidence to support this assertion. The tokens usually depict on the obverse a motif of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|sexual acts or symbols]] and a numeral in the range I - XVI on the reverse.

==Name==
''[[wiktionary:Spintria|Spintria]]'' was used by Suetonius to refer to young male prostitutes,&lt;ref name="Fishburn"&gt;Fishburn, page 10, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt; from Greek  σφιγκτήρ (sphinktḗr, ''[[External anal sphincter|[anal] sphincter]]''). In the 16th century, the name passed from the ancient sense of the persons committing outrageous acts--in other words, sexual and/or sensual acts outside what was considered the norm--(or the place where outrageous acts occurred, such as [[Tiberius]]' gardens on the isle of [[Capri]]) to the tokens themselves. Bette Talvacchia identifies the first usage of the term ''spintriae'' to refer to the tokens as occurring in Sebastiano Errizo's 1559 treatise, ''Discourse Concerning Ancient Medals'' (''Sopra le Medaglie Antiche'', Venice, 1559).&lt;ref name="Talvacchia"&gt;Talvacchia, 1999, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Some scholars, following Friedlander's (1886) suggestion that the tokens were used "auf die man in Bordelle Einlass erheilt" ("to obtain entry to brothels") have argued that ''spintriae'' were used to pay [[prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitutes]], although none offer any supporting evidence. Buttrey is dismissive of the brothel token idea,  asserting "there is no evidence for any of this" (Buttrey 1973, p.&amp;nbsp;53). Currently, only Simonetta and Riva are supporters of the brothel token hypothesis,&lt;ref name="Simonetta and Riva"&gt;[[Simonetta and Riva|Simonetta, B. and Riva, R.]], 1981, ''Le Tessere erotiche romane (spintriae): Quando ed a che scopo sono state coniate'' Gaggini-Bizzozero. Lugano)&lt;/ref&gt; which is also popular with the media (see Duggan 2016); other scholars pursue alternate lines of enquiry (Buttrey; Campana; Duggan; Fishburn; etc.). Under [[Caracalla]], an [[equestrian order|equestrian]] was sentenced to death for bringing a coin with the emperor's likeness into a brothel; he was spared only by the emperor's own death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/78*.html#16 78.16.5.]&lt;/ref&gt; There is no direct ancient evidence, however, to support the theory that ''spintriae'' were created as tokens for exchange in place of official coinage.  [[Numismatist]] [[Theodore V. Buttrey, Jr.|Theodore V. Buttrey]] suggests that they were used as game pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. McGinn, ''The Economy of Prostitution in the Roman World'' (University of Michigan Press, 2004), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; although Duggan (2016) notes there are no archaeological finds to confirm the ''spintriae'' were gaming pieces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eddie Duggan]] (2017) [https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/bgs.2017.11.issue-1/bgs-2017-0005/bgs-2017-0005.xml?format=INT "Stranger Games: The Life and Times of the ''spintriae''"], ''Board Game Studies Journal'' 11 &lt;/ref&gt; Economist Geoffrey Fishburn, following Jacobelli, suggests they may have been used as locker tokens.

It is doubtful these tokens were used to gain entry to brothels or to pay for the services of prostitutes. Duggan concludes, after Fishburn and Jacobelli, that the most convincing explanation is that they functioned as locker tokens. They seem to have been produced for only a short period, mostly in the 1st century AD.

==Appearance==
[[File:Spintriae 003.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Spintriae]]
[[File:Thailener Spintria.png|thumb|350px|Spintriae, 2nd century]]
They were usually struck from [[brass]] or [[bronze]], and were little smaller than a [[Quarter (United States coin)|U.S. quarter]]. Some commentators suggest some of the tokens depicted homosexual acts between men, but this is not widely accepted in the literature, as some authors (Buttrey; Jacobelli; Talvacchia) assert the erotic scenes are exclusively heterosexual.

[[File:Caspar David Friedrich - Wanderer above the sea of fog.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Caspar David Friedrich]], ''[[Wanderer above the Sea of Fog]],'' 1817, [[Kunsthalle Hamburg]]. Romantic artists during the 19th century used the epic of nature as an expression of the sublime]]
In [[aesthetics]], the '''sublime''' (from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:sublimis#Latin|sublīmis]]'') is the quality of greatness, whether physical, moral, intellectual, metaphysical, [[aesthetic]], spiritual, or artistic. The term especially refers to a greatness beyond all possibility of calculation, measurement, or imitation.

==Ancient philosophy==

The first known study of the ''sublime'' is ascribed to [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]: Peri Hupsous/Hypsous or ''[[On the Sublime]]''. This is thought to have been written in the 1st century AD though its origin and authorship are uncertain. For Longinus, the sublime is an adjective that describes great, elevated, or lofty thought or language, particularly in the context of [[rhetoric]]. As such, the sublime inspires [[awe]] and veneration, with greater persuasive powers. Longinus' treatise is also notable for referring not only to Greek authors such as [[Homer]], but also to biblical sources such as [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].

This treatise was rediscovered in the 16th century, and its subsequent impact on aesthetics is usually attributed to its translation into French by linguist [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux]] in 1674. Later the treatise was translated into English by John Pultney in 1680, [[Leonard Welsted]] in 1712, and [[William Smith (scholar)|William Smith]] in 1739 whose translation had its fifth edition in 1800.

The development of the concept of the sublime as an aesthetic quality in nature distinct from beauty was first brought into prominence in the 18th century in the writings of [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley-Cooper, third earl of Shaftesbury]], and [[John Dennis (dramatist)|John Dennis]], in expressing an appreciation of the fearful and irregular forms of external nature, and [[Joseph Addison]]'s synthesis of  concepts of the sublime in his ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', and later the ''Pleasures of the Imagination''. All three Englishmen had, within the span of several years, made the journey across the [[Alps]] and commented in their writings of the horrors and harmony of the experience, expressing a contrast of aesthetic qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson, Marjorie Hope. ''Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory''. Ithaca, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;

John Dennis was the first to publish his comments in a journal letter published as ''Miscellanies'' in 1693, giving an account of crossing the Alps where, contrary to his prior feelings for the beauty of nature as a "delight that is consistent with reason", the experience of the journey was at once a pleasure to the eye as music is to the ear, but "mingled with Horrours, and sometimes almost with despair".&lt;ref name=Nicolson1974&gt;Nicolson, Marjorie Hope. "Sublime in External Nature". ''Dictionary of the History of Ideas''. New York, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Shaftesbury had made the journey two years prior to Dennis but did not publish his comments until 1709 in the ''Moralists''. His comments on the experience also reflected pleasure and repulsion, citing a "wasted mountain" that showed itself to the world as a "noble ruin" (Part III, Sec. 1, 390&amp;ndash;91), but his concept of the sublime in relation to beauty was one of degree rather than the sharp contradistinction that Dennis developed into a new form of literary criticism. Shaftesbury's writings reflect more of a regard for the awe of the infinity of space ("Space astonishes" referring to the Alps), where the sublime was not an aesthetic quality in opposition to beauty, but a quality of a grander and higher importance than beauty. In referring to the Earth as a "Mansion-Globe" and "Man-Container" Shaftsbury writes "How narrow then must it appear compar'd with the capacious System of its own Sun...tho animated with a sublime Celestial Spirit...." (Part III, sec. 1, 373).&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Anthony Ashley, Third Earl of Shaftesbury. ''The Moralists: A Philosophical Rhapsody''. 1709.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Addison embarked on the [[Grand Tour]] in 1699 and commented in ''Remarks on Several Parts of Italy etc.'' that "The Alps fill the mind with an agreeable kind of horror".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Addison, ''Remarks on Several Parts of Italy etc. in the years 1701, 1702, 1703''. 1773 edition, printed for T. Walker. Chapter on ‘Geneva and the Lake’: 261 Located on Google books, accessed 11.12.07&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of Addison's concept of the sublime is that the three pleasures of the imagination that he identified; greatness, uncommonness, and beauty, "arise from visible objects" (that is, from sight rather than from rhetoric). It is also notable that in writing on the "Sublime in external Nature", he does not use the term "sublime" but uses semi-synonymous terms: "unbounded", "unlimited", "spacious", "greatness", and on occasion terms denoting excess.&lt;ref name=Nicolson1974/&gt;

====Edmund Burke====

Addison's notion of greatness was integral to the concept of sublimity. An object of art could be beautiful yet it could not possess greatness. His ''Pleasures of the Imagination'', as well as [[Mark Akenside|Mark Akenside's]] ''[[Pleasures of the Imagination]]'' of 1744 and [[Edward Young|Edward Young's]] poem ''[[Night Thoughts (poem)|Night Thoughts]]'' of 1745 are generally considered the starting points for [[Edmund Burke|Edmund Burke's]] analysis of sublimity.

[[Edmund Burke]] developed his conception of sublimity in ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' of 1756.&lt;ref name=Nicolson1974/&gt; Burke was the first [[philosopher]] to argue that sublimity and beauty are ''mutually exclusive''. The dichotomy that Burke articulated is not as simple as Dennis' opposition, and is antithetical in the same degree as light and darkness. Light may accentuate beauty, but either great light or darkness, i. e., the absence of light, is sublime to the extent that it can annihilate vision of the object in question. What is "dark, uncertain, and confused"&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Burke]], ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'', Part 1, Section 7: "Whatever is fitted in any sort to excite the ideas of pain, and danger, that is to say, whatever is in any sort terrible, or is conversant about terrible objects, or operates in a manner analogous to terror, is a source of the ''sublime''; that is, it is productive of the strongest emotion which the mind is capable of feeling...." In Part 2, Section 2, Burke wrote that "terror is in all cases whatsoever, either more openly or latently, the ruling principle of the sublime."&lt;/ref&gt; moves the imagination to awe and a degree of horror. While the relationship of sublimity and beauty is one of mutual exclusivity, either can provide pleasure. Sublimity may evoke horror, but knowledge that the perception is a fiction is pleasureful.&lt;ref&gt;Monroe C. Beardsley, "History of Aesthetics", ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Volume 1, p. 27 (Macmillan, 1973). But [[Edmund Burke]] disagreed: "Nor is it, either in real or fictitious distresses, our immunity from them which produces our delight ... it is absolutely necessary that my life should be out of any imminent hazard, before I can take a delight in the sufferings of others, real or imaginary ... it is a sophism to argue from thence, that this immunity is the cause of my delight". (''[[A Philosophical Inquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'', Part 1, Section 15)&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke's concept of sublimity was an antithetical contrast to the classical conception of the aesthetic quality of beauty being the pleasurable experience that [[Plato]] described in several of his dialogues, e. g. ''[[Philebus]]'', ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', ''[[Hippias major|Hippias Major]]'', and ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', and suggested that ugliness is an aesthetic quality in its capacity to instill intense emotions, ultimately providing pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Stolnitz, "Ugliness", ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (McMillan, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Aristotle]], the function of artistic forms was to instill pleasure, and he first pondered the problem that an object of art representing ugliness produces "pain." Aristotle's detailed analysis of this problem involved his study of tragic literature and its paradoxical nature as both shocking and having poetic value.&lt;ref&gt;Monroe C. Beardsley, "History of Aesthetics", ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Volume 1, p. 20 (Macmillan, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; The classical notion of ugliness prior to Edmund Burke, most notably described in the works of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine of Hippo]], denoted it as the absence of form and therefore as a degree of non-existence. For St. Augustine, beauty is the result of the benevolence and goodness of God in His creation, and as a category it had no opposite. Because ugliness lacks any attributive value, it is formless due to the absence of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Stolnitz, "Ugliness", ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (McMillan, 1973). Also, Monroe C. Beardsley, "History of Aesthetics", ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Volume 1, p. 22 (Macmillan, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke's treatise is also notable for focusing on the [[Physiology|physiological]] effects of sublimity, in particular the dual emotional quality of fear and attraction that other authors noted. Burke described the sensation attributed to sublimity as a ''negative pain'', which he denominated "delight" and which is distinct from positive pleasure. "Delight" is thought to result from the removal of pain, caused by confronting a sublime object, and supposedly is more intense than positive pleasure. Though Burke's explanations for the physiological effects of sublimity, e. g. tension resulting from eye strain, were not seriously considered by later authors, his [[empiricism|empirical]] method of reporting his own psychological experience was more influential, especially in contrast to the analysis of [[Immanuel Kant]]. Burke is also distinguished from Kant in his emphasis on the subject's realization of his physical limitations rather than any supposed sense of moral or spiritual transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa L. Ryan, "The Physiological Sublime: Burke’s Critique of Reason", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Volume 62, Number 1 (April 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

===German philosophy===

====Immanuel Kant====
{{see also|Immanuel Kant#Aesthetic philosophy}}
[[File:St-peter's-viviano-codazzi-prado-1630.jpg|thumb|right|[[Viviano Codazzi]]: Rendition of [[St. Peter's Square]], Rome, dated 1630. Kant referred to St. Peter's as "splendid", a term he used for objects producing feeling for both the beautiful and the sublime.]]
[[Immanuel Kant]], in 1764, made an attempt to record his thoughts on the observing subject's mental state in ''[[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime]]''. He held that the sublime was of three kinds: the noble, the splendid, and the terrifying.

In his ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' (1790),&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel.  ''Critique of Judgment''. Trans. J.H. Bernard. Macmillan, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant officially says that there are two forms of the sublime, the mathematical and the dynamical, although some commentators hold that there is a third form, the moral sublime, a layover from the earlier "noble" sublime.&lt;ref&gt;Clewis, Robert. 2009. ''The Kantian Sublime and the Revelation of Freedom''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. http://www.cambridge.org/us/knowledge/isbn/item2326741/?site_locale=en_US&lt;/ref&gt; Kant claims, "We call that sublime which is absolutely great"(§ 25). He distinguishes between the "remarkable differences" of the Beautiful and the Sublime, noting that beauty "is connected with the form of the object", having "boundaries", while the sublime "is to be found in a formless object", represented by a "boundlessness" (§ 23). Kant evidently divides the sublime into the mathematical and the dynamical, where in the mathematical "aesthetical comprehension" is not a consciousness of a mere greater unit, but the notion of absolute greatness not inhibited with ideas of limitations (§ 27). The dynamically sublime is "nature considered in an aesthetic judgment as might that has no dominion over us", and an object can create a fearfulness "without being afraid ''of'' it" (§ 28). He considers both the beautiful and the sublime as "indefinite" concepts, but where beauty relates to the "Understanding", sublime is a concept belonging to "Reason", and "shows a faculty of the mind surpassing every standard of Sense" (§ 25). For Kant, one's inability to grasp the magnitude of a sublime event such as an earthquake demonstrates inadequacy of one's sensibility and imagination. Simultaneously, one's ability to subsequently identify such an event as singular and whole indicates the superiority of one's cognitive, supersensible powers. Ultimately, it is this "supersensible substrate," underlying both nature and thought, on which true sublimity is located.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel.  ''Critique of Judgment''. Trans. J.H. Bernard. Macmillan, 1951. Translator's introduction and notes to the ''Critique of Judgment'')&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arthur Schopenhauer====
To clarify the concept of the feeling of the sublime, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] listed examples of its transition from the beautiful to the most sublime. This can be found in the first volume of his ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', § 39.

For him, the feeling of the beautiful is in seeing an object that invites the observer to transcend individuality, and simply observe the idea underlying the object. The feeling of the sublime, however, is when the object does not invite such contemplation but instead is an overpowering or vast malignant object of great magnitude, one that could destroy the observer.

*''Feeling of Beauty'' &amp;ndash; Light is reflected off a flower. (Pleasure from a mere perception of an object that cannot hurt observer).
*''Weakest Feeling of Sublime'' &amp;ndash; Light reflected off stones. (Pleasure from beholding objects that pose no threat, objects devoid of life).
*''Weaker Feeling of Sublime'' &amp;ndash; Endless desert with no movement. (Pleasure from seeing objects that could not sustain the life of the observer).
*''Sublime'' &amp;ndash; Turbulent Nature. (Pleasure from perceiving objects that threaten to hurt or destroy observer).
*''Full Feeling of Sublime'' &amp;ndash; Overpowering turbulent Nature. (Pleasure from beholding very violent, destructive objects).
*''Fullest Feeling of Sublime'' &amp;ndash; Immensity of Universe's extent or duration. (Pleasure from knowledge of observer's nothingness and oneness with Nature).

====Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel====
[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] considered the sublime a marker of cultural difference and a characteristic feature of oriental art. His [[Teleology|teleological]] view of history meant that he considered "oriental" cultures as less developed, more [[autocracy|autocratic]] in terms of their political structures and more fearful of [[god|divine law]]. According to his reasoning, this meant that oriental artists were more inclined towards the aesthetic and the sublime: they could engage God only through [[Aufheben|"sublated"]] means. He believed that the excess of intricate detail that is characteristic of [[Chinese art]], or the dazzling metrical patterns characteristic of [[Islamic art]], were typical examples of the sublime and argued that the disembodiment and formlessness of these art forms inspired the viewer with an overwhelming aesthetic sense of awe.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, G.W.F. ''Aesthetics: Lectures on Fine Art.''  Translated by T.M. Know.  Oxford: Clarendon, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rudolf Otto====
[[Rudolf Otto]] compared the sublime with his newly coined concept of the [[numinous]]. The numinous comprises terror, ''Tremendum'', but also a strange fascination, ''Fascinans''.

==Contemporary philosophy==
===20th century===
[[File:SMSMS.JPG|thumb|right|220px| [[Maurizio Bolognini]], ''SMSMS (SMS Mediated Sublime''), 2000-2006, an interactive installation that aims to involve the audience in the experience of the manipulation and consumption of the ''technological sublime''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurizio Bolognini]], "The SMSMS Project: Collective Intelligence Machines in the Digital City", ''Leonardo'', [[MIT Press]], 37/2, 2004, pp. 147-149. See also [[Maurizio Bolognini]], "De l'interaction à la démocratie. Vers un art génératif post-digital" / [http://www.bolognini.org/lectures/amx.htm "From interactivity to democracy. Towards a post-digital generative art"], ''Artmedia X Proceedings''. Paris 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The last decades of the 19th century saw the rise of ''Kunstwissenschaft'', or the "science of art"—a movement to discern laws of aesthetic appreciation and arrive at a scientific approach to aesthetic experience.&lt;ref&gt;Stolnitz, Jerome. "Beauty". In ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Vol. 1, p. 266. Macmillan (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century [[Neo-Kantian]] German philosopher and theorist of aesthetics [[Max Dessoir]] founded the ''Zeitschrift für Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft'', which he edited for many years, and published the work ''Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft'' in which he formulated five primary aesthetic forms: the beautiful, the sublime, the tragic, the ugly, and the comic.&lt;ref&gt;Emery, Stephen A.. "Dessoir, Max". In ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Vol. 2, p. 355. Macmillan (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of the sublime involves a self-forgetfulness where personal fear is replaced by a sense of well-being and security when confronted with an object exhibiting superior might, and is similar to the experience of the tragic. The "tragic consciousness" is the capacity to gain an exalted state of consciousness from the realization of the unavoidable suffering destined for all men and that there are oppositions in life that can never be resolved, most notably that of the "forgiving generosity of deity" subsumed to "inexorable fate".&lt;ref&gt;Emery, Stephen A.. "Dessoir, Max". In ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Vol. 2, p. 356. Macmillan (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Weiskel re-examined Kant's aesthetics and the Romantic conception of the sublime through the prism of [[semiotics|semiotic theory]] and [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Weiskel, Thomas. ''The Romantic Sublime '' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;  He argued that Kant's "mathematical sublime" could be seen in semiotic terms as the presence of an excess of [[Sign (semiotics)|signifiers]], a monotonous infinity threatens to dissolve all oppositions and distinctions.  The "dynamic sublime", on the other hand, was an excess of signifieds: meaning was always [[Overdetermination|overdetermined]].

According to [[Jean-François Lyotard]], the sublime, as a theme in aesthetics, was the founding move of the [[Modernist]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-François. ''Lessons on the Analytic of the Sublime''. Trans. Elizabeth Rottenberg. Stanford University Press, 1994. Lyotard expresses his own elements of the sublime but recommends ''Kant's Critique of Judgment'', §23&amp;ndash;§29 as a preliminary reading requirement to understanding his analysis.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lyotard argued that the modernists attempted to replace the beautiful with the release of the perceiver from the constraints of the human condition.  For him, the sublime's significance is in the way it points to an ''[[aporia]]'' (impassable doubt) in human reason; it expresses the edge of our conceptual powers and reveals the multiplicity and instability of the [[Postmodernity|postmodern world]].

===21st century===
According to [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]], the concept of the sublime should be examined first of all in relation to the epochal novelty of digital technologies, and technological artistic production: [[new media art]], [[computer generated art|computer-based generative art]], networking, telecommunication art.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the new technologies are creating conditions for a new kind of sublime: the "technological  sublime". The traditional categories of aesthetics (beauty, meaning, expression, feeling) are being replaced by the notion of the sublime, which after being  "natural" in the 18th century, and "metropolitan-industrial" in the modern era, has now become technological.

There has also been some resurgence of interest in the sublime in [[analytic philosophy]] since the early 1990s, with occasional articles in ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'' and ''The British Journal of Aesthetics'', as well as monographs by writers such as Malcolm Budd, James Kirwan and Kirk Pillow. As in the postmodern or critical theory tradition, analytic philosophical studies often begin with accounts of Kant or other philosophers of the 18th or early 19th centuries. Noteworthy is a general theory of the sublime, in the tradition of Longinus, Burke and Kant, in which [[Tsang Lap Chuen]] takes the notion of limit-situations in human life as central to the experience.&lt;ref&gt;Tsang, Lap Chuen. ''The Sublime: Groundwork towards a Theory''. University of Rochester Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jadranka Skorin-Kapov]] in ''The Intertwining of Aesthetics and Ethics: Exceeding of Expectations, Ecstasy, Sublimity''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skorin-Kapov|first1=Jadranka|title=The Intertwining of Aesthetics and Ethics: Exceeding of Expectations, Ecstasy, Sublimity|date=2016|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-1-4985-2456-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues for sublimity as the common root to aesthetics and ethics, "The origin of surprise is the break (the pause, the rupture) between one's sensibility and one's powers of representation... The recuperation that follows the break between one's sensibility and one's representational capability leads to sublimity and the subsequent feelings of admiration and/or responsibility, allowing for the intertwining of aesthetics and ethics... The roles of aesthetics and ethics—that is, the roles of artistic and moral judgments, are very relevant to contemporary society and business practices, especially in light of the technological advances that have resulted in the explosion of visual culture and in the mixture of awe and apprehension as we consider the future of humanity."

'''Sunpendulum''' is an art, science and technology project&lt;ref name="Report"/&gt;  devised by [[Austria]]n [[New media art|media artist]] Kurt Hofstetter.&lt;ref name="Basis Wien"/&gt;

==Concept==
;''Watching the sky&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; "Inplusion" phase''
Twelve [[video camera]]s called "time-eyes" are connected to the [[internet]] in twelve locations in twelve [[time zone]]s around the [[Earth]], observing the sky twenty four hours per day, continuously creating a hypothetical "sun clock" which spans the planet.&lt;ref name="Inplusion"/&gt;

;''Viewing the results&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; "Explosion" phase''
→ '' &lt;small&gt;'''Note:'''&lt;/small&gt; This section describes "pavilions" which have not been constructed or installed.''

[[Image:stationphi.jpg|thumb|right|Scale model pavilion.]]
At a location to be determined within each time zone, twelve screens are intended to be arranged in a circle within a [[pavilion]]&lt;ref name="Pavilion"/&gt;  meant to remain open for visitors twenty four hours per day.  The screens, connected online with the time-eyes, transmit the images from the twelve time zones.&lt;ref name="Explosion"/&gt;  As the earth rotates, the images transmitted by the time-eyes move within a pavilion's circle of screens where day and night may be vicariously experienced in parallel. 
 
Each pavilion, a circular structure of twenty four pairs of half cylinders, each pair of which resembles in horizontal cross section the [[Hopi]] symbol '''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;''' '''&lt;sub&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''' for universal brotherhood,&lt;ref name="Symbol"/&gt; is intended to allow twenty four points of entry for visitors while preventing local light from reaching the screens.  An arrangement of rooftop [[solar cell]]s is hypothesized to produce the necessary energy.&lt;ref name="Explosion"/&gt;

==Kernel team==
The kernel team consists of scientists (chiefly from the Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms at the [[Vienna University of Technology]]) and artists.  Its primary tasks are ongoing technical developments which maintain the integrity of the project and its hardware and software.

==Collaboration partners==
The collaboration partners are scientific and academic institutions which host the time-eye cameras, hardware and servers and participate in the project's international [[cross-cultural]] cooperation.

'''''Tales of Zorro''''' is a 2008 [[anthology]] of Zorro stories and is the first collection of original short fiction featuring [[pulp hero]] [[Zorro]], edited by [[Richard Dean Starr]] and published by [[Moonstone Books]] in 2008.  A second [[anthology]], ''[[More Tales of Zorro]]'', was published in 2011.

==Book Notes==

The stories in ''Tales of Zorro'' incorporate elements from the original Zorro incarnation by [[Johnston McCulley]] in ''[[The Curse of Capistrano]]''. It also contains many references to other versions of Zorro including the 1998 film ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]'', Walt Disney's ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' (starring [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]]), and the [[Zorro (1990 TV series)|New World Television series]], as well as [[Isabel Allende]]'s ''[[Zorro: A Novel]]'', among others.

Some stories, such as Peter David's "Colors Seen by Candlelight" incorporate famous historical figures into the story while others contain suggestions of the supernatural or are told from unconventional viewpoints, such as [[A. C. Crispin]] and [[Kathleen O'Malley]]'s story, "Tornado Warning", which is told through the eyes of Zorro's famous [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]] stallion, [[Tornado (horse)|Tornado]].

The collection also includes a young adult story, "The Feathered Cape" by [[Jan Adkins]], author of ''Young Zorro: The Iron Brand''.  Adkins is a young adult author and illustrator who was also a technical advisor for Allende's 2005 ''[[Zorro (novel)|Zorro]]''.

Richard Dean Starr contributed a story to the book, "Winds of Change" and also collaborated on [[Max Allan Collins]]' story, "Zorro and the Fate Worse Than Death".

''Tales of Zorro'' contains three important essays including a [[Introduction (essay)|introduction]] by [[Guy Williams, Jr.]] (with [[Matthew Baugh]]), a [[foreword]] by [[Zorro Productions, Inc.]] Senior Vice-President [[Sandra Curtis]], and an [[Afterword]] by [[Isabel Allende]].

'''''The Coming Global Superstorm''''' ({{ISBN|0-671-04190-8}}) is a 1999 book by [[Art Bell]] and [[Whitley Strieber]], which warns that [[global warming]] might produce sudden and catastrophic [[climate|climatic]] effects.

* First, the [[Gulf Stream]] and [[North Atlantic drift]] would generate a cordon of warm water around the [[North Pole]], which in turn, holds in a frozen mass of Arctic air.
* Second, if the North Atlantic drift [[Shutdown of thermohaline circulation|were to shut down]], that barrier would fail, releasing a flood of frozen air into the [[Northern Hemisphere]], causing a sudden and drastic temperature shift.

The book discusses a possible cause of the failure of the Gulf Stream: the melting of the [[polar ice cap]]s could drastically affect the [[salinity]] of the North Atlantic drift by dumping a large quantity of freshwater into the world's oceans.

Bell and Strieber explain the possibility that such current destabilizations have occurred before, as well as seemingly impossible engineering feats by the ancients. Among their examples is the island city of [[Nan Madol]]. The book claims that its construction, with exacting tolerances and extremely heavy basalt materials, necessitates a high degree of technical competency. Since no such society exists in the modern record or even, in legend, the society must have been destroyed by dramatic means.

While other explanations beside a global [[meteorological event]] are possible, a correlating evidence set is presented in the woolly mammoth. Strieber and Bell assert that since mammoths have been found preserved with food still in their mouths and undigested in their stomachs, these animals must have been killed quickly, in otherwise normal conditions. They were preserved so well by quick freezing, which is taken as evidence of a rapid onset of a global blizzard or similar event.

Interspersed with the analytical parts of the book are a series of interlinked short fictional scenarios, written in italics, describing what might transpire today if a destabilization of the North Atlantic Current were to occur. The fictional accounts of "current events" as the meteorological situation deteriorates provided background and inspiration for the 2004 science fiction film ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''. Indeed, some events from the book are portrayed in the film with little modification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/05/0518_040518_dayafter.html|title=National Geographic News: Day After Tomorrow Movie: Could Ice Age Occur Overnight?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Hurricane!'''" is the second episode of the [[The Cleveland Show (season 3)|third season]] of the animated comedy series ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', an episode produced for season 2. It is the first part of the [[Night of the Hurricane|Night of the hurricane block]] with ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[American Dad!]]'', the first such event in the animated television line-up of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. The episode first aired on Fox in the United States on October 2, 2011.

[[Seth MacFarlane]] was initially approached by [[Kevin Reilly (executive)|Kevin Reilly]], the president of the entertainment division of Fox, with the idea of a crossover. The episode was first announced at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]].

When a hurricane hits Stoolbend, the Brown/Tubbs family tries to salvage what is left of their vacation despite the lack of any food in the house, and [[Cleveland Brown Jr.|Cleveland, Jr.]]. shocks everyone by revealing that he [[Nontheism|does not believe in God]], although he claims he is not an [[atheism|atheist]] either, which he calls "another religion", pointing out that some atheists, such as [[Brian Griffin]] have been just as condescending and judgmental as those they criticize. The family members attempt to persuade Cleveland, Jr. through reason, emotional appeal, and even a production number, but instead find their own senses of religion and faith tested.

As the storm worsens, a hungry [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] confronts his son over the possibility of having food stored in his room. Cleveland, Jr. explains he used a very scientific method to ration the food. When the family is still resistant to his non-religious lifestyle, accusing him of wanting the food all to himself, Cleveland, Jr. locks the food away in spite. Cleveland calls on God to smite Cleveland, Jr. for his actions, at which point a tree crashes through the house and pins him instead of his son. The family members are unable to lift the tree by hand and decide to pray to God for help. Cleveland, Jr. is able to rig together a pulley system and lifts the tree using his own weight. The family disagrees over whether God was involved in Cleveland, Jr.'s actions and the belief of Cleveland, Jr. is left unresolved as the hurricane [[Seahorse Seashell Party|heads for Quahog]].

The [[fictional crossover|crossover]] event was first announced in July 2010 by series creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con International]] in [[San Diego, California]].

He was also willing to do another crossover event if this one receives successful ratings.&lt;ref name="KR"/&gt;

In April 2011, the executives of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] officially announced that the episode would air on May 1 as part of the ''[[Night of the Hurricane]]'' crossover, alongside the ''Family Guy'' episode "[[Seahorse Seashell Party]]" and the ''American Dad!'' episode "[[Hurricane!

==Ratings==

==Production==

===Development===
[[File:Jim gaffigan in easton 2010.jpg|thumb|Comedian [[Jim Gaffigan]] co-writes, executive produces and stars in the semi-autobiographical series.]]
NBC first showed interest in the show, but eventually passed.&lt;ref name=hitflix&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/how-jim-gaffigan-learned-to-say-no-to-network-sitcoms|title=How Jim Gaffigan learned to say no to network sitcoms|date=July 14, 2015|author=ALAN SEPINWALL|access-date=July 14, 2016|publisher=Hitflix|quote=""The Jim Gaffigan Show" was originally developed at NBC, then filmed two different pilots at CBS, and tomorrow night at 10 debuts on TV Land."}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CBS]] previously tried twice to develop Jim Gaffigan's semi-autobiographical series.&lt;ref name=katz&gt;KATZ, BRIGIT (July 17, 2015), [http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/07/17/meet-jeannie-gaffigan-the-quiet-powerhouse-behind-the-jim-gaffigan-show/ Behind the Hot Pocket"]. ''Women in the World.'' The New York Times. Retrieved July 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; While still in talks with NBC, Jeannie would have played herself in the show, however CBS decided to cast someone—a decision she agreed with—and she joined in casting the role.&lt;ref name=interrobang&gt;Interrobang staff (July 10, 2015), [http://theinterrobang.com/jeannie-gaffigan-is-the-smart-one-and-jim-gaffigan-loves-breakfast-burritos/ "Jeannie Gaffigan is the Smart One…and Jim Gaffigan Loves Breakfast Burritos"]. ''Interrobang.com''. Retrieved July 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  The network ordered a pilot episode in January 2013, at which time [[Mira Sorvino]] was attached to play Gaffigan's wife, with Christian Barillas and [[Tongayi Chirisa]] in supporting roles. CBS passed on the series in May 2013 and instead planned to redevelop it for the 2014-15 television season. The series was recast with new cast members Williams, Goldberg and Black. CBS passed on the series in May 2014, and [[Sony Pictures Television]] began shopping it to other networks. It was announced in July 2014 that [[TV Land]] had ordered the series and, unlike previous networks, granted the Gaffigans full creative control.&lt;ref name=ophira/&gt; Jim Gaffigan said of the announcement: "I am thrilled that TV Land is giving us this opportunity to do this show that Peter, Jeannie and I have been fine-tuning for three years."&lt;ref name="Goldberg0729" /&gt; TV Land president Larry W. Jones said the series was perfect for its target audience of [[Generation X]]ers who are raising families. Jones said: "We love Jim Gaffigan's brand of humor. The second we saw this show we knew we wanted it on TV Land."&lt;ref name="Goldberg0729" /&gt;

===Writing===
The series is partially based on the real lives of Jim and Jeannie Gaffigan, who have five children and live in a two-bedroom apartment in New York City.&lt;ref name="Goldberg0729" /&gt; The age differences between the children were shortened for the television show, and Jeannie said, "The TV kids are sort of a snapshot of an earlier time in our lives when they were all younger".&lt;ref name="McGlynn0330" /&gt; Episodes are built around actual incidents they've experienced.&lt;ref name=ophira&gt;Eisenberg, Ophira (July 9, 2015), [https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=421350059 "According to Jim (Gaffigan)"]. ''Ask Me Another''. NPR. Retrieved August 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Other regular topics of Jim Gaffigan's stand-up comedy are part of the series, particularly his love of food. Jeannie said the list of props for the show is "almost 90 percent food ... which I thought was pretty funny".&lt;ref name="McGlynn0330" /&gt;

Although Jim will play a comedian, a conscious decision was made not to regularly intersperse the narrative with his stand-up comedy, like in such popular shows as ''[[Seinfeld (TV series)|Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]''. He said of this decision: "I want this to be more about what happens off the stage. ... 'Stand-up comedian' is an occupation and, like our pilot, we're evolving into a much more mature show."&lt;ref name="McGlynn0330" /&gt; Jim Gaffigan and Peter Tolan wrote the pilot together.&lt;ref name="Goldberg0729" /&gt;  The rest of the series is written by Jim and his wife Jeannie.

===Crew===
Jeff Lowell was the [[showrunner]] for Season 1 ''The Jim Gaffigan Show'', and served as an executive producer along with Jim and Jeannie Gaffigan, Jim's real-life wife, a fictional version of whom will also appear in the show. Jeannie took over the [[showrunner]] position for Season 2. Alex Murray and Sandy Wernick will also be executive producers.&lt;ref name="Futon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldberg0729"&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |title=CBS' Jim Gaffigan Comedy Moves to TV Land With Series Order |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=July 29, 2014 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cbs-jim-gaffigan-comedy-moves-718505 |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Production on the [[Single-camera setup|single-camera]] series began in 2015. Filming occurred at such New York City locations as [[Katz's Delicatessen]] and the [[Gotham Comedy Club]].&lt;ref name="Futon" /&gt;  The set is an exact replica of their former apartment, set on a soundstage.&lt;ref name=ophira/&gt;

==Broadcast==
[[Comedy Central]], a cable network owned by TV Land parent company [[Viacom]], will air episodes of the series one week after they debut.&lt;ref name="Goldberg0729" /&gt; New episodes are simulcast on [[Nick at Nite]]. Episodes are available on video on demand on cable outlets and for streaming on Hulu (with a paid subscription) three weeks after airing on TV Land.

In Canada, ''The Jim Gaffigan Show'' airs on [[The Comedy Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2015/11/30/jim-gaffigan-show-and-impastor-make-their-way-to-canada|title='Jim Gaffigan Show' and 'Impastor' make their way to Canada  |publisher=''[[Toronto Sun]]''|accessdate=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show debuted on the network on December 1, 2015.

'''The Theatre Chipping Norton''', sometimes '''The Theatre, Chipping Norton''', is a theatre, cinema, gallery and music venue in [[Chipping Norton]], [[Oxfordshire]], England.&lt;ref name="house"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Theatre, Chipping Norton|url=http://housetheatre.org.uk/venues/the-theatre-chipping-norton/|website=House|publisher=Farnham Maltings|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Us now|url=http://www.chippingnortontheatre.com/index.php?us_now|publisher=The Theatre Chipping Norton|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main auditorium was originally a [[The Salvation Army|Salvation Army]] citadel, built in 1888. After some years as a furniture warehouse it was rediscovered in 1968; fundraising began in 1973, the theatre was registered as a charity in 1974, and it opened as a theatre in 1975. It acquired adjoining properties to provide space for bar, gallery, green rooms, offices and rehearsal space, and underwent a major refurbishment in 1996 with [[Arts Council England]] assistance.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief history of the theatre|url=http://www.chippingnortontheatre.com/index.php?history|publisher=The Theatre Chipping Norton|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre produces original shows and hosts touring companies; in 2016 it co-produced with [[The Dukes (Lancaster)|The Dukes]] a 20th-anniversary touring production of ''[[Stones in His Pockets]]''. It prides itself on its annual "world-renowned traditional family [[pantomime]]".&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref name="cavendish"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cavendish|first1=Dominic|title=Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, The Theatre, Chipping Norton, review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/8990274/Ali-Baba-and-the-Forty-Thieves-The-Theatre-Chipping-Norton-review.html|accessdate=13 March 2016|work=The Telegraph|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dicks|first1=Matt|title=Robin Hood review at the Theatre, Chipping Norton – ‘artfully silly’|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/robin-hood-review-at-the-theatre-chipping-norton-artfully-silly/|accessdate=13 March 2016|work=[[The Stage]]|date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Translation criticism''' is  the systematic study, [[evaluation]], and [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of different aspects of translated works.&lt;ref name="whatis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sid.ir/en/ViewPaper.asp?ID=44700&amp;varStr=3.14159265358979;TAQIYEH%20M.H.;TRANSLATION%20STUDIES;Fall%202005;3;11;53;61|title=What is translation criticism?|accessdate=21 April 2013|publisher=Scientific Information Database|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227142628/http://www.sid.ir/en/ViewPaper.asp?ID=44700&amp;varStr=3.14159265358979;TAQIYEH%20M.H.;TRANSLATION%20STUDIES;Fall%202005;3;11;53;61|archivedate=27 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[interdisciplinary]] academic field closely related to [[literary criticism]] and [[translation theory]]. It includes marking of student translations, and reviews of published translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cw.routledge.com/textbooks/translationstudies/data/samples/9780415584890.pdf  |publisher=Routledge |title=Translation Studies |accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept itself of "translation criticism" has the following meanings:
# Quality assessment of the [[target text]], especially of its semantic and pragmatic equivalence regarding the [[source text]].
# Assessment of the proceeding followed by the translator in order to translate the text.
# Part of translation science dealing basically with:
* nature and aims of translation criticism,
* considering the problems of translation criticism,
* defining valid criteria and proceedings for criticizing translation regarding its aims.&lt;ref name="zierer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra/la-critica-de-la-traduccion/ |last=Zierer |first=Ernesto |title=Translation Criticism |publisher=[[Instituto Cervantes]] |year=2012|accessdate=20 August 2017}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
One of the goals of translation criticism is to raise awareness of the delicacy involved in translation and to explore whether the translator has achieved their goals or not. Whether or not translation criticism should be considered a separate field of inquiry from [[translation theory]] is a matter of some controversy.&lt;ref name="zierer"/&gt;

The translation professionals and laymen who engage in [[literary translation]] inevitably face the issue of translation quality. Translation criticism has several open issues, such as the name for the practice of evaluating translations, and the criteria for evaluation, each of which merits a detailed study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.nbuv.gov.ua/portal/natural/nvvnu/filolog_mov/2010_9/R4/Shpak.pdf|title=Toward Translation Criticism|author=Y. L. Shpak|accessdate=21 April 2013}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A literary text may be explored as a translation, not primarily to judge it, but to understand where the text stands in relation to its original by examining the interpretative potential that results from the translational choices that have been made. When comparing different translations from a same original text, the results of the analyses should be used to construct a hypothesis about each translation: criteria such as "divergent similarity", "relative divergence", "radical divergence" and "adaptation" are important for such an analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benjamins.com/#catalog/books/btl.95/main |title=An Approach to Translation Criticism|author=[[Lance Hewson]]|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very influential author in the field was [[Antoine Berman]], who claimed that there may be many different methods for translation criticism as there are many translation theories; therefore he entitled a model of his own as an analytical path, which can be modulated according to the specific objectives of each analyst and adapted to all standardized text types. He further insists that every translator shall develop first a [[translation project]], prior to the translation process itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/258112/EVALUATION_OF_THE_TRANSLATION_OF_VIRGINIA_WOOLFS_THE_DUCHESS_AND_THE_JEWELER_BY_ALEV_BULUT|title=Berman's approach to translation criticism in a given example|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a debatable subject it can be said that translation criticism is required. For instance, in Turkey, since the establishment of the Translation Bureau in 1940, the Turkish literary system has been extensively enriched by translations from various languages and the translation activity has been evaluated by writers, translators and critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hewlett-Clarke|first1=Daniel|title=Translation Criticism|url=https://dhctranslations.com/translation-articles/|website=dhctranslations.com|publisher=Daniel Hewlett-Clarke|accessdate=16 January 2015}} See [https://dhctranslations.com/translation-articles/systemic-translation-criticism "A Systemic Analysis of Two Turkish Translations of Hemingway's The Old man and the Sea"].&lt;/ref&gt;A methodology for descriptive translation studies was put forward by Gideon Toury. In it he suggests that translators should constantly take decisions during the translation process. In short, scholars working within this paradigm have claimed that translations should be described in accordance with the target norms that are valid at a specific time and place and compared with their original ones in order to produce an objective translation criticism supported by translation theories (Toury 1980: 73).

'''''Viy 3D''''' ({{lang-ru|Вий}}, internationally known as '''''Forbidden Empire''''', and in the UK as '''''The Forbidden Kingdom''''') is a 2014 [[dark fantasy]] film produced by Russian and Ukraine Film Group and Marins Group Entertainment and loosely based on the [[Nikolai Gogol]] story ''[[Viy (story)|Viy]]''. The film was released in cinemas in Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan on 30 January 2014, in the United States on 22 May 2015 and in the United Kingdom on 1 June 2015.
 
The film is directed by Oleg Stepchenko, based on the first manuscript of Nikolai Gogol. The film has been in production since December 2005 and stopped several times due to lack of funding. In October 2012, the filming was completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inter.ua/ru/news/2012/04/02/4778 Закончились съемки фильма "Вий" 3D], The filming of "Viy 3D" completed, Inter Channel, April 2012, {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Viy'' was a huge commercial success, even breaking a record for opening weekend in Russia, but was met with mixed reviews in media.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.kinofilms.ua/movie/7252_Viy/videos_filming/?video=8623 История создания.

==Plot==
Early-18th-century [[cartographer]] Jonathan Green undertakes a scientific voyage from Western Europe to the East. Having passed through [[Transylvania]] and crossed the [[Carpathian Mountains]], he finds himself in a small village lost in impassable woods of [[Ukraine]]. Nothing but chance and heavy fog could bring him to this cursed place. People who live here do not resemble any other people which the traveler saw before that. The villagers, having dug a deep moat to fend themselves from the rest of the world, share a naive belief that they could save themselves from evil, failing to understand that evil has made its nest in their souls and is waiting for an opportunity to gush out upon the world.

==Production==
In 2006, Russian producer Alexey Petrukhin and Russian director Oleg Stepchenko decided that they wanted to make a film based on the horror story of [[Viy (story)|''Viy'']] by [[Nikolai Gogol]]. By then, two other projects based on Gogol's tale were in production, such as ''[[Taras Bulba (2009 film)|Taras Bulba]]'' film from 2009 and ''The Witch'' from 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nasha-shumiha.ru/news/vij_v_meru_strashnyj_i_ochen_sovremennyj/2014-01-30-2764 «Вий»: в меру страшный и очень современный — 30 Января 2014 — Газета «Наша Шумиха»&lt;!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to secure the title, they needed without any further delay to release the information on the forthcoming project. In the course of three days, they filmed a teaser trailer where the role of Khoma Brutus was played by Petrukhin himself. Only after that did the active production of the film begin. When the teaser was shown in theaters, the script was not yet written and the actors were not cast. The story kept growing and changing until it turned from a simple screen version into a big-budget fantasy thriller.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvrain.ru/articles/mongajt_vij_v_3d_gogol_perevernetsja_v_grobu-361004/?autoplay=false Монгайт. «ВИЙ» В 3D: Гоголь перевернется в гробу.

Денис Корсаков&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors understood that the new times set new rules, so in 2011 they made a difficult but very important decision: they decided re-shoot the picture in 3D, even though half of the footage was already filmed. Conversion was out of the question. The decision to re-shoot was not just a PR trick. The re-shooting was taken seriously—the producers developed an innovative technology that had no parallels in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marinsgroup.ru/kino/651-lr-3d----23--2014-.html «Вий» выйдет в прокат 23 января 2014 года]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Viy'' is an intersection of two storylines. One is the narrative from [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s horror story. The writers used the first edition of the story still untouched by Belinskiy's proofs. The original version has quite different motifs and the whole narrative focuses on a different kind of drama. What's more important, this version abounds in secrets and riddles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itar-tass.com/ekonomika/952588|title=ФАС получила жалобу на скрытую рекламу водки в фильме «Вий»]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Gogol's immortal story will be screened without cuts. The second storyline is centered on a real person—[[Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan]] (1595–1685)—a French traveler and cartographer who was the first to study the Ukrainian territories and their people and culture. His research is included in the book ''From Transylvania to Muscovy''. The producers chose his figure because he was also the first to collect and systematize under one cover Slavic myths and legends. De Beauplan was a prototype of the film's main character—Jonathan Green.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.kinofilms.ua/movie/7252_Viy/videos_filming/?video=8623 История создания. Часть 1 Вий 3D&lt;!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming locations===
''Viy'' was shot in [[Prague]] at the [[Gatteo]], [[Barrandov]], and Letnyany studios.

The castle in England where Green sets out on his journey is doubled in the film by the Czech [[Sychrov Castle]]. Despite being a few hundred years old—it was built in 1693—it is the newest castle in the [[Czech Republic]]. The legend goes that somewhere in the dungeons of the castle is hidden a treasure guarded by a "Black Lady", a woman dressed in a black gown of mourning. In order to make her figure even scarier, some storytellers began calling the lady of the castle "the Black Widow".&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvrain.ru/articles/mongajt_vij_v_3d_gogol_perevernetsja_v_grobu-361004/?autoplay=false Монгайт. «ВИЙ» В 3D: Гоголь перевернется в гробу. Часть 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name became so popular that it turned into a cliché and is used every time a female ghost is depicted. It found its way into hundreds of legends around the world. But the locals take the story quite seriously. In order to not shock the tourists staying in the castle overnight, it is forbidden to move any furniture—by morning all of it will be in its original place. The castle guardians explain that "the lady of the house is putting things in order". Zamek Sychrov serves as a film location for the second time already: in 1972 it was the set for Three Wishes for Cinderella.

Most of filming sets were built in [[Czech Republic]].

===Design===
For the location shooting, a life-sized Cossack hamlet, with every historical detail thoroughly reproduced, was built. It included 21 households, a marketplace, a church, a tavern, a mill, a house of pray, and watch towers. Some props were even donated later to historical museums as they were so realistic. The church—the setting for the three notorious nights—was also built for the film from scratch. During the filming of the three nights, the decorators burned over twelve thousand wax candles manufactured according to a special historical design.

The carriage in which the protagonist travels was also designed and built at one of the most famous German automobile manufacturers. The vehicle was designed to be mechanically modern, while its outside appearance was that of a piece of transport from the 18th century. The carriage cost $75,000. A second carriage worth $23,000 was also constructed to double for the interior scenes.

Besides the carriage, the protagonist was equipped with other elaborate technical gadgets—cartographic tools, cryptographic equipment, and even a tablet computer. Costumes were designed by a legend in the Czech movie industry Yarmila Koneczna. She made almost 200 costumes. The main character alone owns six original suits, another seven were made for his doubles and stuntmen.

===Casting===
Several actors were cast for the lead role of Jonathan Green: [[Vincent Cassel]], [[Christian Slater]], [[Tim Roth]], [[Sean Bean]], [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], and [[Jason Statham]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.kinofilms.ua/movie/7252_Viy/videos_filming/?video=8623 История создания. Часть 1 Вий 3D&lt;!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The producers had official negotiations with each of the actors. It was Jason Statham who recommended his best friend Jason Flemyng for the lead. Flemyng was soon approved by the director and the producers. Christian Slater, after seeing the footage of the film, regretted that he did not appear in the film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://extranews.org/supermodel-natalya-vodyanova-ochen-xotela-sygrat-vedmu-v-filme-vij_110886.html Супермодель Наталья Водянова очень хотела сыграть ведьму в фильме «Вий»]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special effects===
All the stunts and fighting scenes were choreographed by Irzi Kuba.

There are three categories of monsters in the film: made-up artists, animatronics—puppet monsters animated by machines and stunt actors—and virtual 3D ogres. Special make-up artist Petr Gorshenin, who worked on ''Vysotskiy'': Thanks for living on... and other films, said that his work on ''Viy'' was the most complicated and important.

The film is shot in real 3D. Stereoscopic design of the film was done by the German company Stereotec.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russianfilmgroup.com/news83.htm Stereotec brought Viy to the New Level]&lt;/ref&gt; Special proprietary technology was developed for the film's 3D effects: rfg_BTS (Beyond The Screen), also called Touch3D.

The producer, Alexei Petrukhin, said that originally the film was supposed to be stereoscopic. The scenes that were filmed during the first shooting period (about 20 minutes) were filmed in 2D and postconverted to 3D (in particular, episodes of Pannochka's funeral in the church were filmed that way). In 2011 the production decided to cooperate with Stereotec&lt;ref&gt;[http://stereotec.com www.stereotec.com], Stereotec shooting "Viy 3D", January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; for the rest of the movie, a worldwide-operating, Munich-based 3D company. The rest of the picture (the remaining 2 hours) was shot &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tvbeurope.com/newsletter-3dmasters-content/full/florian-maier-on-viy-calls-for-3d-certification;jsessionid=06911F803BE595694AB947D21323019B |title=Interview with Florian Maier about 3D Certification and shooting the Russian 3D feature "Viy" |access-date=2012-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318190529/http://www.tvbeurope.com/newsletter-3dmasters-content/full/florian-maier-on-viy-calls-for-3d-certification;jsessionid=06911F803BE595694AB947D21323019B#.Ulp46hbDdY4 |archive-date=2012-03-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with special [[3D rig]]s from Stereotec and Cameras from [[ARRI]] in native 3D.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-village.ru/village/weekend/films/138333-filmy-nedeli-avgust-viy-9-mesyatsev-strogogo-rezhima Фильмы недели: «Август», «Вий», «9 месяцев строгого режима»].

==Release==
Initially, in order to show that the picture is in production, Alexey Petrukhin and Oleg Stepchenko filmed a teaser trailer, which took them 18 hours to make, where the role of Homa Brutus (character with a bald head) was played by Petrukhin himself. The teaser was shown in cinemas although the script was not yet written and the production of the film actually began a year later.

The announced release date was 12 March 2009 which was timed for the 200th anniversary of [[Nikolai Gogol]], but it was postponed indefinitely since then. After they finished shooting the first film of the trilogy, the producers decided to postpone the premiere until the work on the second film, ''Viy 2'' («Вий-2. Проклятое место»), is complete.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.kinofilms.ua/movie/7252_Viy/videos_filming/?video=8623 История создания.

On 16 June 2010, a sneak preview of some of the finished episodes was held. The show, held in 3D, was organised by the creators of the film for their American guests, who considered distributing the picture in 80 countries around the world.

In April 2012, according to the official website of the trilogy, a new estimated release date was set as 2013. On 15 May 2013, as part of the [[Cannes Film Festival]], RFG representatives has signed an agreement with [[Universal Pictures]], to take part in production as Distribution Company. The film finally appeared in theatres on 30 January 2014.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.kinofilms.ua/movie/7252_Viy/videos_filming/?video=8623 История создания.
