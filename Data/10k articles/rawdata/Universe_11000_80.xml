The '''''Aegean Sea'' tanker oil spill''' was a [[oil spill|spill]] that occurred on 3 December 1992 when the double-bottomed  Greek-flagged [[oil tanker]], ''Aegean Sea'', en route to the [[Repsol]] refinery in [[A Coruña]], Spain, suffered an accident off the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] coast.  The ship had successfully passed all required tests and revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cedre.fr/uk/spill/aegean_sea/aegean_sea.htm|title=Aegean Sea | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927031315/http://www.cedre.fr/uk/spill/aegean_sea/aegean_sea.htm| archivedate= 27 September 2007| deadurl= no|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accident occurred during extreme weather conditions and affected the Galician coast resulting in ecosystem damage, as well as damage to the fishing and tourist industries in A Coruña. The captain and pilot were found to be criminally liable and the shipowner took on much of the monetary liability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Incident==
After being anchored for a few days off the coast of [[A Coruña]] due to weather hazards, ''Aegean Sea'' was ordered into port by port authorities. Due to this, on 3 December 1992, the oil-ore Greek carrier ship ''Aegean Sea'', ran aground off the coast of Galicia at nearly 5&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref&gt;Press. (4 December 1992). The Post and Courier – Google News Archive Search. Google News. Retrieved 28 April 2013, from https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2482&amp;dat=19921204&amp;id=z1ZSAAAAIBAJ&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was on its route to A Coruña, Spain, from Sullom Voe, Scotland. Allegedly, a heavy storm managed to push the ship off course and cause her to run aground. A rescue team was sent immediately but failed to keep the ship from breaking in half. This caused the cargo of [[light crude oil]] to be spilled which affected sea life. A temporary evacuation of the city of A Coruña was implemented in order to protect the citizens from the hazards of the oil smoke. Out of the 79,000 tonnes of crude oil that the ship was carrying, 67,000 tonnes managed to be spilled and the remaining was salvaged. The salvaged oil was retained through the use of booms, skimmers, and pumps. Since half of the ship was still above water, the rescue team used pumps to drain the still intact tanks. Soon after, the ship caught on fire and continued to burn for a period of five days. The remaining oil drifted with the strong currents produced by the wind, and as much as 300&amp;nbsp;km of coast line were affected by the spill. As for the thirty-two-man crew, a rescue helicopter managed to save all of them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Aegean Sea. (n.d.). Cedre : Centre de documentation, de recherche et d'expérimentations sur les pollutions accidentelles des eaux. Retrieved 21 April 2013, from http://www.cedre.fr/en/spill/aegean_sea/ae&lt;/ref&gt;

As the vessel prepared to enter the docks of A Coruña, the wind speed was above {{convert|50|knots|abbr=on}}, and visibility was under {{convert|100|m|yd|abbr=on}}, causing her to lose her assigned course. ''Aegean Sea'' broke up and exploded with {{convert|50|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}} flames near the [[Tower of Hercules]], spilling more than 70,000 tons of oil into the ocean.

The two anchors of ''Aegean Sea'' were recovered, and are now on display at [[Aquarium Finisterrae]] in A Coruña, and at the Philippe Cousteau Museum at Salinas, [[Asturias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/hemeroteca/2004/10/23/3139480.shtml |title=El "Mar Egeo" y otros buques desmantelados |language=Spanish |accessdate=28 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208022411/http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/hemeroteca/2004/10/23/3139480.shtml |archivedate=8 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clean-up process==
Clean-up crews were immediately sent to the disaster site, both on and offshore. Oil booms were placed around the spill in order to contain the oil. The booms collected around 5,000 cubic meters of an oil/water mixture. On shore, 1,200 cubic meters of contaminated sand and debris were treated for oil. Since only the bow of ''Aegean Sea'' had sunk, pumps were placed in the stern that pumped out the remaining oil.&lt;ref name="tankers"&gt;Aegean Sea "Tankers, Big Oil and Pollution Liability." (n.d.). Tankers, Big Oil and Pollution Liability. Retrieved 21 April 2013, from {{cite web |url=http://www.oilpollutionliability.com/aegean-sea/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812210343/http://www.oilpollutionliability.com/aegean-sea/ |archivedate=12 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and investigation==
The Aegean Sea oil spill affected countless amounts of sea life. A Coruña's fishing industry received the hardest blow, with the ban of all fishing by the Fisheries Council. A claim for fishermens' assistance that totalled nearly 3.53 million dollars was implemented soon after the oil spill. Although the Fisheries Council aided the fishers with some reimbursements, these were nowhere close to fully compensating the fishermens' losses. A flood of claims from fishermen and the tourist industry came to the Spanish Court, totalling around 287 million dollars by 2001. Most of these claims were settled, but some claims remain litigious. The International Oil Pollution Compensation (IOPC), the Spanish Government, and the ship owner finally came to a settlement, with the last payment made in December 2003.&lt;ref name="tankers" /&gt; In addition to the monetary settlements, the captain, Constantine Stavrides, and the pilot were also found criminally liable for negligence and for failing to follow regulations.&lt;ref name="tankers" /&gt;

==Hydrocarbon study==
[[Hydrocarbon]]s, being a significant source of energy due to their strong chemical bonds, were a prime source for scientific study in the Aegean Sea oil spill. Chemical markers were placed in a sample of the crude oil spilled, with interesting data revealed. Alkanes and acyclic hydrocarbons, both having single bonds, appeared to have deteriorated in only six months, while triterpane and steranane were still present after years of weathering. Both triterpane and steranane have multiple bonds, which is the reason they were still present after so many years. Researchers concluded that chemical markers can be of effective use against oil spills. These markers can allow scientists to determine how long the oil has contaminated seawater, and how the seawater affects the oil collected with water. This can be helpful in the process where spilled oil is collected and processed for reuse. Chemical markers may now be placed in the oil to determine how much the oil must be cleaned to be satisfactory for use.&lt;ref name="Pastor 2001" /&gt;

==Ecosystem study==
The Galician coast was an extremely vital source of income for Spain's fishing industry. Crab and lobster harvesting, salmon farming, and the main profit industry of shellfish farming were all affected by the spill. Soon after the oil spill, Spain ordered a study of the ecosystem in order to evaluate the damage done to the benthic fauna in the region, and muddy sediments.&lt;ref name="Pastor 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pastor |first1=D. |last2=Sanchez |first2=J. |last3=Porte |first3=C. |last4=Albaiges |first4=J. |year=2001 |title=The Aegean Sea Oil Spill in the Galicia coast (NW Spain).

This affected sea life as well as subtidal sediments, but the surviving sea life developed defense mechanisms which allowed them to survive such a crisis. The sea life in A Coruña appeared to remain stable until the wreck of the ''Aegean Sea''. 

To determine the impact of the spill on sea life, a study was conducted to determine species richness, abundance, and biomass. Scientist analyzed changes from December 1992 to November 1996, and found that the [[Macrobenthos|macrobenthic]] communities living in the coast of the affected areas displayed a similar trend as the original organisms affected by the ''Urquiola''{{'}}s oil spill. [[Amphipoda|Amphipods]] seemed to be affected the worst by the oil spill, and experienced a high mortality rate and low abundance rate, up to the spring of 1995. Soon after, the species seemed to recover until the end of the study in 1996. Towards the end of the study, a trend was discovered in which resistant species dominated the ecosystem. 

A third oil spill occurred around the same area in A Coruña in November 2002, in which a tanker, [[Prestige oil spill|''Prestige'']], carrying 77,000 tons of oil split into two and spilled its cargo. About 10,000 tons of oil was spilled but the sunken hull of ''Prestige'' is still leaking oil from her tanks to this day{{when|date=January 2016}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gomez Gesteira |first1=J.L. |last2=Dauvin |first2=J.C. |year=2004 |title=Impact of the Aegean Sea oil spill on the subtidal fine sand macrobenthic community of the Ares-Betanzos Ria (Northwest Spain) |url=http://otvm.uvigo.es/investigacion/informes/documentos/archivos/aegeansea_gomezgesteira.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Marine Environmental Research |volume=60 |issue= |pages=289–316 |doi=10.1016/j.marenvres.2004.11.001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619210721/http://otvm.uvigo.es/investigacion/informes/documentos/archivos/aegeansea_gomezgesteira.pdf |archivedate=19 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition and standardization==
L-605 is composed primarily of [[cobalt]] (Co), with a specified mixture of [[chromium]] (Cr), [[tungsten]] (W), [[nickel]] (Ni), [[iron]] (Fe) and [[carbon]] (C), as well as small amounts of [[manganese]] (Mn), [[silicon]] (Si), and [[phosphorus]] (P).

'''Angus Stanley King Jr.''' (born March 31, 1944) is an American politician and attorney serving as the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|junior]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Maine]] since 2013.&lt;ref name=hsieu&gt;{{cite web |author=Angus S. King |url=http://digitalcommons.bowdoin.edu/mitchelloralhistory/105/ |title="Interview with Angus King by Andrea L’Hommedieu" by Angus S. King |publisher=Digitalcommons.bowdoin.edu |date= |accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Independent politician|political independent]] since 1993, he was the [[List of Governors of Maine|72nd]] [[Governor of Maine]] from 1995 to 2003.

King won Maine's [[United States Senate election in Maine, 2012|2012 Senate election]] to replace the retiring [[Republican Party of Maine|Republican]] [[Olympia Snowe]] and took office on January 3, 2013. He was reelected to his second term in [[United States Senate election in Maine, 2018|2018]], following the state's inaugural [[instant-runoff voting]] elections. For [[List of current United States Senate committees|committee]] assignment purposes, he [[Congressional caucus|caucuses]] with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. He is one of two independents currently serving in the Senate, the other being [[Bernie Sanders]] of [[Vermont]].

==Early life, education, and early career==
King was born in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], the son of Ellen Archer (née Ticer) and Angus Stanley King Sr., a lawyer.&lt;ref name=hsieu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://articles.dailypress.com/2006-05-25/news/0605250194_1_mrs-king-holy-cross-williamsburg-landing |title=Ellen Archer Ticer King – Daily Press |publisher=Articles.dailypress.com |date=May 25, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1966 with a B.A. and the [[University of Virginia School of Law]] in 1969 with a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] While a student at Dartmouth, King joined the [[Delta Upsilon]] social fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greeks in the 113th Congress |url=http://www.nicindy.org/blog/greeks-in-the-113th-congress/ |publisher=North-American Interfraternity Conference |accessdate=September 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327052229/http://www.nicindy.org/blog/greeks-in-the-113th-congress/ |archivedate=March 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after graduation from Virginia, King entered private law practice in [[Brunswick, Maine]]. He was a staff attorney for Pine Tree Legal Assistance in [[Skowhegan, Maine|Skowhegan]]. In 1972, he served as chief [[counsel]] to the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Alcoholism and Narcotics. King served as a legislative assistant to Democratic U.S. Senator [[William Hathaway]] in the 1970s. He was also well-known statewide as a television host on [[Maine Public Broadcasting Network|public television]].&lt;ref&gt;Nemitz, Bill, [http://www.pressherald.com/politics/king-passes-his-first-100-days-as-senator-eventfully_2013-04-14.html?pagenum=full "King’s first 100 days: ‘The hardest I’ve ever worked in my life’"], Portland ''Press Herald'', April 14, 2013. Retrieved April 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, when he was 29, King was diagnosed with an aggressive form of malignant [[melanoma]]. King has said he believes he survived cancer only because he had health insurance, and he has highlighted this experience when explaining his support for the [[Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=TAMC Communication and Development|title=Senator Angus King to present keynote address at May 9 County Cancer Conference|url=http://bangordailynews.com/community/senator-angus-king-to-present-keynote-address-at-may-9-county-cancer-conference/|website=Bangor Daily News|accessdate=November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pierce|first1=Charles|title="These Are People.

In 1975, King returned to Maine to practice with Smith, Loyd and King in Brunswick. In 1983, he was appointed vice president of Swift River/Hafslund Company, which developed alternative energy (hydro and biomass) projects in [[New England]]. In 1989, King founded Northeast Energy Management, Inc., a company that developed and operated electrical energy conservation projects. In 1994, he sold the company. In 2012, King's investments were valued at between $4.8 million and $22.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richardson|first1=John|title=King is wealthy, but not through wind projects|url=https://www.centralmaine.com/2012/06/28/king-files-report-detailing-his-wealth_2012-06-28/|accessdate=14 March 2018|publisher=Portland Press Herald|date=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governor of Maine==

===1994 election===
{{Main|Maine gubernatorial election, 1994}}
In May 1993, King announced he would run for [[governor of Maine]] as an independent, as incumbent Governor [[John McKernan]], a Republican, was term-limited and could not seek another term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Higgins|first=A. Jay|title=Lewiston mayor to make Blaine House bid|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|date=May 7, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; King abandoned his lifelong affiliation with the [[Maine Democratic Party]]. "The Democratic Party as an institution has become too much the party that is looking for something from government," King explained to the ''[[Bangor Daily News]]'' a few weeks after he announced he would be running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ripley|first=John|title=Candidate King maps course to Augusta|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|date=May 18, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maine Republican Party|Republican]] nominee was [[Susan Collins]], Commissioner of Professional and Financial Regulation under Governor [[John McKernan]] and a [[protégé]]e of U.S. Senator [[William Cohen]], and at the time relatively unknown to the electorate. The Democratic nominee was former Governor and U.S. Representative [[Joseph E. Brennan]]. It was Brennan's fifth campaign for governor.

The general election was a highly competitive four-way race between King, Collins, Brennan, and [[Green Party USA|Green Party]] nominee [[Jonathan Carter (politician)|Jonathan Carter]]. King decided to invest early in television advertising during Maine's unusually early June primary, allowing him to emerge from the primary season on an equal footing with his rivals. King positioned himself as a businessman and a pragmatic environmentalist focused on job creation and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AD DEPICTS KING AS USING NEW IDEAS TO ENCOURAGE JOBS|newspaper=Portland Press Herald|date=October 1, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Times]]'' described him as an idealist who "wants to slash regulations but preserve the environment; hold the line on taxes; impose work and education requirements on welfare recipients; experiment with public school choice and cut at least $60 million from the state budget."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Snow|first=Tony|title=Maine bellwether for voter discontent?|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=July 9, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; His opponents criticized him for flip-flopping. Collins argued King "presents different images, depending on who he is talking to. Angus has been a Democrat his whole life. In my opinion, he became an independent because he didn't think he could beat Joe Brennan in a primary. He's extremely smooth, articulate and bright, but he says different things to different groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hale|first=John|title=A King pursues top spot &gt; Former liberal now sees himself as `pragmatic'|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|date=October 4, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King narrowly won the November 8 election with 35% of the vote to Brennan's 34%, a margin of just 7,878 votes. (Collins received 23% of the vote and Carter 6%.) King won eight counties, Collins five and Brennan three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=29040|title=Our Campaigns - ME Governor Race - Nov 08, 1994|publisher=Ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; King's election as an independent was not unprecedented in Maine politics, as independent [[James B. Longley]] had been elected twenty years earlier.

===1998 election===
{{Main|Maine gubernatorial election, 1998}}
King won reelection to a second term in 1998 with 59% of the vote. He defeated Republican [[James B. Longley Jr.|Jim Longley Jr.]] (the son of the former governor) (19%) and Democrat [[Thomas J. Connolly|Thomas Connolly]] (12%). King's 59% was the highest a candidate had received since Brennan's [[Maine gubernatorial election, 1982|1982]] reelection with 62% of the vote. Brennan's 1982 victory was also the last time before 1998 that a gubernatorial candidate had won a majority of the vote, and King's 1998 reelection remains the last time in a Maine gubernatorial election that the winner got a majority.

===Tenure===
[[File:Russians presents their social project to Maine governor Angus King.jpg|thumb|right|King meets with a Russian delegation as Maine governor in October 2002.|260x260px]]
During his tenure, King was the only [[Governor (United States)|governor]] in the United States unaffiliated with any political party. He was also one of only two governors nationwide not affiliated with either of the two major parties, the other being [[Jesse Ventura]] of [[Minnesota]], who was elected in 1998 as a member of the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]]. The term of Connecticut's independent governor [[Lowell Weicker]] ended when King's began. In his book ''Independent Nation'' (2004), political analyst [[John Avlon]] describes all three governors as [[Radical center (politics)|radical centrist]] thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;Avlon, John (2004).  ''Independent Nation: How the Vital Center Is Changing American Politics''.  Harmony Books / Random House, pp. 177–93 ("Radical Centrists").  {{ISBN|978-1-4000-5023-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, King launched the [[Maine Learning Technology Initiative]] (MLTI) to provide laptops for every public middle-school student in the state, the first initiative of its kind in the nation.&lt;ref name="Waters36-8-35"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waters|first=John|title=Maine Ingredients|journal=T.H.E. Journal|year=2009|volume=36|issue=8|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; It met with considerable resistance due to its cost but was enacted by the [[Maine Legislature]]. On September 5, 2002, the state began the program with a four-year $37.2-million contract with [[Apple Inc.]] to equip all 7th- and 8th-grade students and teachers in the state with laptops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cousins|first1=Christopher|title=LePage eyes changing laptop program launched by Angus King|url=https://bangordailynews.com/2016/08/12/politics/state-house/lepage-eyes-changing-laptop-program-launched-by-angus-king/|accessdate=15 March 2018|publisher=Bangor Daily News|date=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herold|first1=Benjamin|last2=Kazi|first2=Jason|title=Maine 1-to-1 Computing Initiative Under Microscope|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2016/08/31/maine-1-to-1-computing-initiative-under-microscope.html|accessdate=15 March 2018|publisher=Education Week|date=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As governor, King signed legislation requiring that all school employees be fingerprinted and undergo [[background check]]s.&lt;ref&gt; Alan K. Ota, [http://public.cq.com/docs/news/news-000004172396.html 113th Congress: Angus King, I-Maine (Senate)], ''CQ Today'' (November 6, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-gubernatorial career (2003–2013)==
The day after he left office in 2003, King, his wife, Mary Herman, and their two children, who were 12 and 9 at the time, embarked on a road trip in a 40-foot motor home to see America. Over the next six months, the family traveled 15,000 miles and visited 33 states before returning home in June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2011/06/24/politics/angus-king-chronicles-rv-travels-in-new-book/ | title=Angus King chronicles RV travels in new book|date=June 24, 2011|accessdate=January 13, 2015|author=Canfield, Clarke|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his post-gubernatorial residency in Maine, he lectured at [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Brunswick, Maine|Brunswick]] and [[Bates College]] in [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]]. He was appointed a visiting lecturer at Bowdoin in 2004 and an endowed lecturer at Bates in 2009, teaching courses in [[Politics of the United States|American politics]] and [[Statecraft (political science)|political leadership]] at both institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bates.edu/news/2009/10/29/bates-to-host-political-forums/|title=Bates to host Maine political forums|last=|first=|date=October 29, 2009|work=Bates Magazine|access-date=November 10, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Angus King|url=https://dailysun.bowdoin.edu/angus-king/|accessdate=14 March 2018|publisher=Bowdoin Daily Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2007, King and Rob Gardiner, formerly of the [[Maine Public Broadcasting Network]], formed Independence Wind, a wind energy company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richardson|first1=John|title=Angus King defends his wind career|url=https://www.pressherald.com/2012/09/15/angus-king-defends-his-wind-career_2012-09-16/|accessdate=14 March 2018|publisher=Portland Press Herald|date=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, Independence Wind along with joint venture partner Wagner Forest Management won Maine DEP approval for construction of a proposed $120-million, 22-turbine, utility-scale wind power project along a prominent mountain ridge in [[Roxbury, Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainebiz.biz/news45086.html |title=DEP approves Record Hill wind farm &amp;#124; Mainebiz |publisher=Mainebiz.biz |date= |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, King sold his share of the company after entering the [[United States Senate election in Maine, 2012|2012 U.S. Senate election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2012/03/22/energy/panel-raises-questions-about-102m-loan-guarantee-for-wind-project/|title=Panel questions loan guarantee for wind project in which Angus King had stake|publisher=Bangor Daily News|date=March 22, 2012|accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the project, King has said, "People who say wind is only an intermittent resource are looking for a one-shot solution. And my experience is that there are rarely silver bullets, but there is often silver buckshot. Wind is an adjunct source of energy. Ten percent, 20% can be very significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Taylor|title=Running with the wind|url=http://www.mainebiz.biz/article/20071210/CURRENTEDITION/312109987|publisher=Mainbiz.biz|accessdate=October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5, 2012, King announced that he was running for the [[U.S. Senate]] seat being vacated by [[Olympia Snowe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2012/02/29/politics/mike-michaud-enters-senate-race/? |title=Michaud, Pingree and Baldacci may seek Olympia Snowe’s seat; King, Raye and Cutler also considering |publisher=Bangor Daily News |date= |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PressHerald03052012"&gt;{{cite web | last =Riskind | first =Jonathan | title = Source: King to run for Snowe's seat | url = http://www.pressherald.com/news/King-has-made-up-his-mind-Pingree-hasnt.html | publisher = The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram | date =March 5, 2012 | accessdate = March 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; King said "hogwash" to allegations by some Republicans that he had cut a deal with Democrats to keep U.S. Rep.

King's Senate campaign came under scrutiny for posting a heavily edited newspaper profile of him to the campaign website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shepherd|first1=Michael|title=King’s campaign altered newspaper article on website|url=http://www.pressherald.com/politics/King-alters-newspaper-article-on-website.html|accessdate=August 15, 2014|publisher=Portland Press Herald|date=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 2012, King won the Senate race with 53%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Election Center|url=http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/results/state/ME/senate|work=Senate: Maine|publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the vote, beating Democrat [[Cynthia Dill]] and Republican [[Charlie Summers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Angus King wins Senate bid|url=http://www.wcsh6.com/news/article/221223/2/Angus-King-wins-Senate-bid|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209045309/http://www.wcsh6.com/news/article/221223/2/Angus-King-wins-Senate-bid|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 9, 2013|newspaper=WCSH|date=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sharp|first=David|title=King wins Senate race; gay marriage OK'd in Maine|url=http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/King-wins-Senate-race-gay-marriage-OK-d-in-Maine-4017679.php|newspaper=Stamford Advocate, Associated Press|date=November 7, 2012}}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, King announced that he would caucus with Senate Democrats, explaining not only that it made more sense to affiliate with the party that had a clear majority, but that he would have been largely excluded from the committee process had he not caucused with a party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Kevin|title=King will caucus with Senate Democrats|url=http://www.kjonline.com/news/angus-king-caucus-senate-democrats.html|newspaper=Kennebec Journal|date=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Keefe|first=Ed|title=Angus King to caucus with Democrats in Senate|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/wp/2012/11/14/angus-king-to-caucus-with-democrats-in-senate/|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; King said he had not ruled out caucusing with the Republicans if they took control of the Senate in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Recio |first=Maria |title=McMorris Rodgers wins fight for spot in House GOP leadership |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2019683952_congress15.html |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=November 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427210916/http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2019683952_congress15.html |archivedate=April 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but when that happened, he remained in the Democratic caucus.&lt;ref name=remain/&gt;

King supports reform of the Senate [[filibuster]], noting that senators are no longer required to stand on the floor and speak during a filibuster. He also points out that the Constitution contains no 60-vote requirement to conduct business in the Senate.&lt;ref name="Angus2012" /&gt;{{primary source inline|date=March 2018}} Accordingly, in 2013 King voted in favor of the so-called [[Nuclear option (U.S. politics)|nuclear option]] to eliminate the [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]] for most presidential nominees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=King Statement on Vote to Alter Filibuster Rule| url= https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-statement-on-vote-to-alter-filibuster-rule| publisher= Office of Sen.

King opposes attempts by the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] to cut $40 billion from the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] over ten years, fearing that it "would affect people in a serious way" and drive more people to soup kitchens and food banks. He supports the more modest Senate efforts to save $4 billion over the same period by closing loopholes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Koeing|first=Seth|title=Angus King says $40 billion in proposed House cuts to food stamp program too much|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2013/10/24/politics/angus-king-says-40-billion-in-proposed-house-cuts-to-food-stamp-program-too-much/|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|date=October 24, 2013|accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Republicans gained the Senate majority in the [[United States Senate election, 2014|November 4, 2014 election]], King announced that he would continue to caucus with the Democrats. He cited his belief that it is good for a state to have a senator from each party, and that it is important to have a senator who caucuses with the same party as the President, saying, "In the end, who I caucus with is less important than who I work with." He further said, "It does not mean I have become a Democrat. It does not mean I have made a promise to anybody."&lt;ref name=remain&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcsh6.com/story/news/politics/2014/11/05/senator-king-caucus-democrats/18548955/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20141105223559/http://www.wcsh6.com/story/news/politics/2014/11/05/senator-king-caucus-democrats/18548955/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=November 5, 2014|title=Senator King to caucus with Democrats|work=WCSH-6 TV|date=November 5, 2014|accessdate=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, King underwent a successful surgery that removed a [[Prostate cancer|cancerous prostate]] that had been detected in a [[Prostate cancer screening|screening]] and [[biopsy]]. The surgery did not change King's plans to run for reelection in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2015/06/26/sen-angus-kings-prostate-surgery-is-a-success-his-wife-says/|title=Sen.

In 2017, King was a strong opponent of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|Republican tax bill]], criticizing its rushed passage on a party-line vote without hearings,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-sen-angus-king-on-face-the-nation-dec-3-2017/ Transcript: Sen.

In 2015, King gave his support to the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]], an international agreement with Iran.

King favors the [[Cuban thaw|normalization of U.S.–Cuba relations]]. He opposes the [[United States embargo against Cuba|U.S. embargo against Cuba]], calling it an "antiquated" relic of the [[Cold War]]; in 2015, King introduced legislation to lift the embargo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/06/14/senator-king-files-bill-restore-trade-with-cuba/c6V2Tt0VJuss9YCyqwgwUN/story.html Senator King files bill to restore trade with Cuba], Associated Press (June 14, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mario Moretto, [http://stateandcapitol.bangordailynews.com/2015/06/11/angus-king-introduces-bill-to-re-open-trade-with-cuba/ Angus King introduces bill to re-open trade with Cuba], ''Bangor Daily News'' (June 11, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

King opposes efforts in Maine to ban the baiting and trapping of bears, including an effort to [[Maine Question 1, 2014|put the question to voters in 2014]], calling such practices necessary to prevent interaction between bears and people, and stating the practices are based on science and the views of experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgesoutdoornews.bangordailynews.com/2014/04/05/maine-woods/senator-angus-king-defends-maines-bear-management/ |title=Senator Angus King defends Maine’s bear management |publisher=Bangor Daily News|date=April 6, 2014 |accessdate=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration===
King strongly criticized President [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Executive Order 13769]], which barred the admission of refugees to the U.S. and barred travel by nationals of several Muslim-majority countries to the country. King stated: "This is probably the worst foreign policy decision since the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. What it's done is played right into ISIS's hands. They want us to turn this into a war of the west against Islam. They have explicitly said they want to drive a wedge ... There are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world and we don't want a war with all of them. We don't need a war with all of them. We're not opposed to all of them."&lt;ref name="Savransky"&gt;Rebecca Savransky, [http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/317036-angus-king-trump-travel-bad-worst-foreign-policy-decision-since-iraq Angus King: Trump travel ban 'worst foreign policy decision' since Iraq war], ''The Hill''(January 31, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; King noted that U.S. forces fought alongside Muslim Iraqi troops, and that much valuable [[counterterrorism]] intelligence was shared with the U.S. by Muslim nations.&lt;ref name="Savransky"/&gt;

===Gun laws===
King supports expanding background checks to most firearms transactions, with exceptions for transfers between family members, calling such a position "the single most effective step" that can be taken to keep guns out of the wrong hands. He supports limiting the size of magazines to 10 rounds, and to make purchasing a gun for someone not legally allowed to have one a federal crime. He does not support a ban on assault weapons, believing it will not work and that such a ban is not based on the functionality of the weapons, which are not relevantly different from the many hunting rifles owned by Maine residents. He noted that the vast majority of gun crimes are committed with [[handgun]]s, not rifles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=Angus|title=Angus King presents his position on gun control|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2013/04/11/opinion/angus-king-presents-his-position-on-gun-control/|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|date=April 11, 2013|accessdate=April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King voted for the Manchin–Toomey amendment to expand background checks for gun purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Kevin Miller | title=Collins, King support gun law | url=http://www.kjonline.com/politics/collins-says-she-supports-gun-law_2013-04-14.html | newspaper=Kennebec Journal | date=April 14, 2013 | accessdate=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health issues===
King supports the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (ACA or Obamacare), but has expressed support for modest adjustments to the legislation if they can be done on a bipartisan basis.&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;Steve Collins, [http://bangordailynews.com/2017/01/12/news/nation/angus-king-susan-collins-split-on-repeal-of-obamacare/ Angus King, Susan Collins split on repeal of Obamacare], ''Sun Journal'' (January 12, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burgess Everett &amp; Jennifer Haberkorn, [http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/democrats-open-to-replacing-obamacare-232589 Democrats open to replacing Obamacare: A surprising number of lawmakers in the minority say they'd play ball if the changes aren't too far-reaching], ''Politico'' (December 15, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, King voted to restore funding for the ACA as part of an amendment to legislation that [[Continuing resolution|funded government operations]] for 45 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00208 | title=U.S. Senate: Legislation &amp; Records Home &gt; Votes &gt; S.Amdt.1974 | publisher=Senate.gov | date= |accessdate=September 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has said that those opposed to the ACA who are attempting to discourage people from purchasing health insurance are "guilty of murder" and that doing so was "one of the grossest violations of our humanity that I could think of."&lt;ref name="Guilty of Murder"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.salon.com/2013/09/30/senator_conservatives_encouraging_people_to_skip_obamacare_are_murderers/ | title=Right-wing extremists 'are guilty of murder', Sen. Angus King tells Salon  | publisher=Salon.com | date= |accessdate=September 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In making this comment, King noted a time in his life when he believed he would have died had he not just acquired health insurance.&lt;ref name="Guilty of Murder"/&gt;

In January 2017, King voted against the Republican Senate budget plan to accelerate repeal of the ACA and block repeal legislation from being filibustered; the measure passed on a party line 51-48 vote.&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt; He spoke out against the [[American Health Care Act|House Republican repeal legislation]], noting that the [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimated that 14 million Americans would lose health insurance if the legislation were enacted.&lt;ref&gt;David Lawder, [http://bangordailynews.com/2017/03/13/politics/gop-health-care-revision-would-reduce-insured-numbers-by-24-million/ Budget office says GOP health care plan would leave millions uninsured], Reuters (March 13, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; King stated that the House Republican bill, "If you were designing a bill to hammer my state, it would be this bill," saying that it would most adversely affect Maine residents between the ages of 50–65.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Bolton, [http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/323169-maine-senator-house-gop-healthcare-plan-hammers-my-state "Maine senator: House GOP healthcare plan hammers my state",] ''The Hill'' (March 9, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

King is a supporter of the [[Children's Health Insurance Program]] (CHIP) program.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pear, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/us/politics/chip-childrens-health-insurance-program-congress.html "With Children's Health Program Running Dry, Parents Beg Congress: 'Do the Right Thing{{'"}},] ''New York Times'' (December 19, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

King favors [[abortion rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Shepherd, [http://www.pressherald.com/2012/08/22/candidates-stand-firm-as-abortion-debates-swirl_2012-08-23/ Maine candidates stand firm on abortion beliefs], ''Kennebec Journal'' (August 22, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

King criticized Trump's 2017 budget proposal for its cuts to medical research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressherald.com/2017/03/16/maines-congressional-delegation-responds-to-trump-budget/ Maine's congressional delegation responds to Trump budget], ''Portland Press Herald'' (March 16, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, King voted with all Republicans except [[Rand Paul]] and six other Democrats to confirm [[Alex Azar]], Trump's nominee for Health Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/370511-senate-advances-trumps-health-secretary-nominee|title=Senate confirms Trump health secretary|last=Cohn|first=Alicia|date=2018-01-24|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/us/politics/alex-azar-health-and-human-services-secretary-confirmed-senate.html|title=Senate Confirms Trump Nominee Alex Azar as Health Secretary|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King has voted against Republican attempts to completely defund [[Planned Parenthood]], calling the proposals an "unfounded yet relentless assault" and "another example of misguided outrage that would only hurt those who need help the most."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sherperd, [http://stateandcapitol.bangordailynews.com/2015/12/04/collins-king-vote-against-senate-bid-to-defund-planned-parenthood/ Collins, King vote against Senate bid to defund Planned Parenthood], ''Bangor Daily News'' (December 4, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; No federal funds go to Planned Parenthood for abortions (federal dollars pay for other health care services provided by the group, such as [[contraception]] and screenings for cancer and [[sexually transmitted diseases]]), but Republicans have sought to completely defund the organization because it provides abortions with other funds.&lt;ref name="Thistle"&gt;Scott Thistle, [http://bangordailynews.com/2015/08/04/politics/collins-and-king-take-issue-with-bill-to-defund-planned-parenthood/ Collins and King take issue with bill to defund Planned Parenthood], ''Sun Journal'' (August 4, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; King stated that supporters of the bill were in effect voting to deprive low-income Americans of healthcare over an issue "that has nothing to do with the 97 percent of the services that Planned Parenthood provides," saying: "To me, this bill is like attacking Brazil after [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]."&lt;ref name="Thistle"/&gt;

===Same-sex marriage===
King supports [[Same-sex marriage in Maine|same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dolan|first1=Scott|title=Maine reacts to Supreme Court ruling affirming same-sex marriage in all states|url=https://www.pressherald.com/2015/06/26/maine-reacts-to-supreme-court-ruling-affirming-same-sex-marriage-in-all-states/|accessdate=14 March 2018|publisher=Portland Press Herald|date=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed an [[Amicus curiae|amicus brief]] to the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[United States v.

The '''Architectural Woodwork Institute''' (AWI), founded in 1953, is a [[Industry trade group|professional trade association]]. Member companies are the fabricators of fine finished [[woodwork]], [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]], and [[furniture]]. AWI has published a Standard of Care for woodworking since 1961, called the [[Quality Standards Illustrated]].

The association is built on the idea of sharing knowledge in many forms – formal programs, seminars and workshops, networking, committee involvement and publications.

AWI and its members is devoted to fostering professionalism throughout the industry. Each member firm today garners prestige through the AWI logo, Quality Standards, Quality Certification Program, Design Solutions and other important technical publications.

AWI Chapters are integral to networking opportunities, sharing of resources, and overall association operations. Chapters are the bedrock upon which the association operates. The chapter structure provides influence, information and a united front on local levels, bringing a common voice to the national organization on important industry issues. Chapters also provide the opportunity to conduct grassroots educational programs for woodworkers and the design community. They bring together woodworkers in a local area, giving them the opportunity to share ideas and information specific to their region.

Since its beginning as the ''Millwork Cost Bureau'', the Architectural Woodwork Institute has evolved into a respected organization. A small group gathered in [[Chicago]] on December 12, 1952 to determine if new life could be infused into the existing organization, or whether a new, more dynamic association should be formed to represent the expanding core of special millwork operators. Their first meeting set in motion a series of gatherings that would lead them down a new path. One month later, in January 1953, Charles Rinehimer, president of Rinehimer Bros. Mfg. Company, [[Elgin, Illinois]], met with Ormie Lance, manager of the National Woodwork Manufacturers Association representing the 31 stock millwork plants in the [[United States]]. The conversation drifted in the direction of conducting a national meeting of custom millworkers, with the suggestion of running the idea past a trade association management firm. On October 15, 1953, Chairman Rinehimer welcomed 176 representatives of 109 architectural woodwork companies from the United States and Canada, 10 suppliers, representatives from 11 interested trade associations and 9 guest speakers to the opening session of a two-day convention at the Congress Hotel in Chicago. Concluding the discussions and the recommendation of the Development Committee, a motion was unanimously affirmed, creating the Architectural Woodwork Institute. After the convention adjourned, the newly elected directors met to select the first slate of officers: Rinehimer as president, Claude Twiellenmeier as first vice president, Charles Fischer as second vice president, William Otis as third vice president, and Elmer Root as treasurer. After the officers were selected, Robert Hoe, Jr., the director from Poughkeepsie, handed the new treasurer his company check for the first year’s dues, and the Architectural Woodwork Institute was on its way. Shortly thereafter, AWI was incorporated as a non-profit organization under the laws of the state of [[Illinois]]. Articles of Incorporation were recorded on December 17, 1954.

Chairman Rinehimer helped to form regional chapters throughout the country. Membership in AWI increased as a result and a dual membership package for AWI and MCB was developed. [[cost book|Cost Book]] A was revised with plans set in motion to form an upgraded estimators correspondence course. AWI is a hands-on organization, governed by a member board, slate of officers and a set of bylaws. An industry association run by members, AWI programs and policies are developed and monitored by committees, and administered by an executive director and a national headquarters staff.

Elected officers are the primary governing body of the organization. The president accepts the gavel for a one-year term following several years of service in board and vice president slots.

In the late 1990s a [[management consulting]] group was enlisted to study the Institute’s governance structure. A member task force was appointed to work with the consulting team and together they studied and evaluated board design, nomination processes, committee structure and roles and responsibilities. At first the task force’s recommendations were rejected by the board, requiring further study and discussion, and then approved in the spring of 2001, reducing the size of the board to eleven members, eliminating the Executive Committee, and establishing a Development Council.

'''B205''' is the name of the [[Magnox]] [[nuclear reprocessing]] plant at [[Sellafield]] in northern England. This plant uses [[PUREX]] chemistry (based on [[tributyl phosphate]] (TBP)) to extract [[plutonium]] and [[uranium]] from [[used nuclear fuel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieer.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/1997/01/no-2.pdf|title=The International Civilian Reprocessing Business|work=Energy and Security|publisher=[[Institute for Energy and Environmental Research]]|first=Frans|last=Berkhout|year=1997|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant was originally constructed and operated by the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA), but in 1971 control was transferred to [[British Nuclear Fuels Limited]] (BNFL).

B205 was commissioned in 1964 as a replacement for the UK's first nuclear reprocessing plant, B204, which was converted into a pre-handling plant for B205 and recommissioned in 1969. In 1973, after both plants had been shut down for one year for repairs, a violent reaction in the B204 plant occurred which contaminated the entire plant and 34 workers with [[ruthenium]]-106. Following this event the B204 plant was permanently decommissioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellona.no/en/energy/nuclear/sellafield/wp_5-2001/21738.html |title=Reprocessing plant B204 |accessdate=January 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124164632/http://www.bellona.no/en/energy/nuclear/sellafield/wp_5-2001/21738.html |archivedate=November 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar [[Ruthenium tetroxide|ruthenium oxidation]] and sublimation reaction occurred in [[Airborne radioactivity increase in Europe in autumn 2017|2017 in the Mayak reprocessing facility]] in southern Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irsn.fr/EN/newsroom/News/Pages/20171109_Detection-of-Ruthenium-106-in-France-and-in-Europe-Results-of-IRSN-investigations.aspx Detection of Ruthenium 106 in France and in Europe: Results of IRSN’s investigations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/11/11/radioactive-cloud-that-covered-europe-might-be-from-russia-dont-worry-about-it-though/?noredirect=on Radioactive cloud that covered Europe might be from Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/r-russia-starts-cleaning-up-cold-war-era-nuclear-waste-2017-6?IR=T Russia starts cleaning up Cold War-era nuclear waste 2017. "from Andreyeva Bay, the spent fuel will be shipped on board a specially-equipped vessel to Russia's Arctic port of Murmansk, then on to its final destination, the Mayak nuclear reprocessing plant in Chelyabinsk, near the Ural Mountains."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over its lifetime, the B205 plant has handled over 35,000 tons of expended Magnox fuel, and returned over 15,000 tons of uranium to the fuel cycle. Now that the Magnox reactors have been retired from use, the final fuels are being processed, and the B205 plant is slated for decommissioning around 2020 after all fuel has been reprocessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellona.no/en/energy/nuclear/sellafield/wp_5-2001/21739.html |title=Magnox Reprocessing Plant (B205) |accessdate=March 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051128051748/http://www.bellona.no/en/energy/nuclear/sellafield/wp_5-2001/21739.html |archivedate=November 28, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
The process uses mixer settlers as the basis of the plant operation. The Magnox fuel is dissolved in nitric acid within the Dissolver Cell. The aqueous stream is conditioned to the correct temperature and acidity and then passes to the first mixer settler system where fission products are separated from the uranium (U) and plutonium (Pu) by extraction of the U/Pu into the solvent phase comprising tri-butyl-phosphate in odourless kerosene. This has the effect of reducing the radiation levels in subsequent stages of the process and the resulting degradation of the solvents.

The solvent stream of U, Pu and remaining fission products then passes to the critical mixer settler stages where the U and Pu are transferred into the aqueous phase and fission products remains in the aqueous phase. Separation of the U and Pu is achieved by adding a reductant, which causes the Pu, but not the U, to transfer into the solvent phase. Once separated, further removal of fission products is undertaken by more mixer settler units.

The U and Pu streams are then passed to evaporators to concentrate the U and PU before further processing in other plants.

'''Becquerelite''' is a [[uranium]] mineral with the chemical formula: Ca(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;·8(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). It is a secondary mineral which contains [[calcium]] and is a bright yellow colour. It has a [[Mohs hardness]] of about 2.

It was named after the French physicist [[Antoine Henri Becquerel]] (1852–1908), who discovered radioactivity in 1896. Becquerelite contains about 70% uranium by weight.

It is mainly mined in Kasolo of the former [[Zaire]], in the present day [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

In 2016, CRFA re-launched under the name '''Renewable Industries Canada''' (RICanada). The change reinforced the 32 year-old non-profit association's mission to promote the use of value-added products made from renewable resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/renewable-industries-canada-becomes-new-face-canadas-biofuels-bio-based-sectors-2128936.htm Renewable Industries Canada Becomes New Face of Canada's Bio Based Sectors]&lt;/ref&gt; RICanada represents the interests of over 30 member companies, and is Canada's leading voice in promoting the role of renewable fuels and value added products in reducing GHG emissions.

Its stated purpose is to "To promote the use of value-added products made from renewable resources through consumer awareness and government liaison activities."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricanada.org/about/background/] RICanada About&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
RICanada is currently led by an Executive Director and reports to a Board of Directors &lt;ref&gt;[http://ricanada.org/about/team/ RICanada Team]&lt;/ref&gt; after being previously led by a number of dedicated Presidents. Past Presidents include Andrea Kent (2014-2017),&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricanada.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/30-10-2014-andrea-kent-appointed-crfa-president.pdf] Andrea Kent Appointed CRFA President&lt;/ref&gt; W. Scott Thurlow (2012-2014), and Gordon Quaiattini (2007-2014).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricanada.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/070711-gordon-quaiattini-resignation.pdf] Gordon Quaiattini Announces Departure From CRFA&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2007, RICanada was led by [[Kory Teneycke]], a former activist with the [[Reform Party of Canada]], and a veteran of the [[Conservative Party of Canada]]'s war room for the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]]. At the time, one of the CRFA's registered lobbyists is Ken Boessenkool, a confidant of Conservative [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=bd9e5d7d-ffc1-4144-b20b-71ecf107ef0f&amp;k=80908 Bruce Cheadle, "Harper slammed as 'hypocrite' over lawyer lobbyist"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025083922/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=bd9e5d7d-ffc1-4144-b20b-71ecf107ef0f&amp;k=80908# |date=2012-10-25 }}, ''Canadian Press'', 8 March 2007, accessed 24 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy==

In 2017, RICanada launched a public awareness campaign on the environmental and economic benefits of biofuels mandates. Dubbed 'Facts Don't Lie', the campaign was designed to educate the public on the role of biofuels in reducing carbon emissions from transportation. The underlying message of the campaign  was a call to the federal government to increase mandates for renewable content in fuels. [https://www.canadianbiomassmagazine.ca/news/ricanada-launches-ad-campaign-to-promote-biofuels-6643 "RICanada Launches Ad Campaign to Promote Biofuels"] Facts included:

• Ethanol can reduce GHGs by 62 per cent compared to gasoline.

• Biodiesel can reduce GHGs by over 100 per cent compared to diesel.

• Canada's biofuels mandates reduce annual GHG emissions to the same extent as taking one million cars off the road.

• Each year, Canada's biofuels mandate removes as much C02 from the atmosphere as 21 million trees.

• Increasing the federal biofuels mandate could add 31,000 jobs and $5.6 billion to Canada's economy.

• Canada was once a world leader in implementing renewable fuel requirements. Today, over 40 countries require higher levels of biofuel blends in transportation fuels than Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricanada.org/facts-dont-lie/ RICanada Facts Don't Lie]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the CRFA ran television advertisements promoting a Conservative Party pledge on renewable fuels, and the 5% renewable fuel standard in all transportation fuels in Canada.  The advertisements featured images of Stephen Harper, as well as an interview with Conservative candidate [[Peter Kent]].  The policy itself has broad political support: the Liberal Party of Canada also supports a 5% renewable fuels standard, and former Saskatchewan NDP Premier Lorne Calvert promoted a 10% biofuels mandate.

In '''dropwise [[condensation]]''' the condensate [[liquid]] collects in the form of countless droplets of varying diameters on the condensing surface, instead of forming a continuous film, and does not wet the solid cooling surface. The droplets develop at points of surface imperfections (pit, scratch), called nucleation sites, and grow in size as more vapour condenses on its exposed surface. When the size of droplets is large there comes a time the droplet breakaway from the surface and knock off other droplets and carries it downstream. The moving droplet devours the droplets of smaller size. Dropwise condensation is one of the most effective mechanism of [[heat transfer]] and extremely large [[heat transfer coefficient]]s can be achieved with this mechanism. In dropwise condensation, there is no liquid film to resist heat transfer, and as a result heat transfer coefficients can be achieved more than 10 times larger than those associated with film condensation, although 3-5 times is more common. Heat transfer coefficients are large so designers can achieve a specified heat transfer rate with a smaller surface area and thus a smaller and less expensive condenser.

Dropwise condensation is achieved by adding a [[Promoter (catalysis)|promoter chemical]] into the vapor, and/or roughened surfaces and surface and surface coated with [[hydrophobic]] impurities like fatty acids and organic compounds, known as dropwise promoters. Dropwise condensation is provoked artificially with the help of silicons, [[teflon]]s, assortment of waxes, and fatty acids. These promoters are used to promote dropwise condensation but most promoters are highly unstable and lose their effectiveness with time due to oxidation, fouling and removal of the promoter from the surface. Dropwise condensation can be sustained for a long time by the combined effects of surface coating and periodic injection of the promoter into the vapor. When dropwise surfaces degrade, they convert to filmwise condensation. So most condensers are designed on the assumption that film condensation will take place on the surface eventually. Dropwise condensation is useful in powerplant heat exchangers, thermal desalination, self-cleaning surfaces, and heating and air conditioning. 

The total amount of heat transfer through a single droplet is a function of its radius and the size distribution over the condensation surface. The important factors which are involved in the mechanism of heat transfer through a single droplets are:

# [[Thermal conduction]] through a single droplet
# Thermal conduction in the substrate material
# Interphase matter transfer at the vapour liquid interface
# Curvature of the vapour-liquid interface

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1820">'''Electron wake''' is the disturbance left after a high-energy [[charged particle]] passes
through condensed matter or [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. [[Ions]] passing through can introduce periodic oscillations in the [[crystal lattice]] or [[plasma wave]] with the [[characteristic frequency]] of the [[crystal]] or [[plasma frequency]]. Interactions of the field created by these oscillations with the charged particle field alternate from [[constructive interference]] to [[destructive interference]], producing alternating waves of electric field and displacement. The frequency of the wake field is determined by the nature of the penetrated matter, and the period of the wake field is directly proportional to the speed of the incoming charged particle. The amplitude of the first wake wave is the most important, as it produces a braking force on the charged particle, eventually slowing it down. Wake fields also can capture and guide lightweight ions or positrons in the direction perpendicular to the wake. The larger the speed of the original charged particle, the larger the angle between the initial particle's velocity and the captured ion's velocity.

'''Fibre-reinforced plastic''' ('''FRP''') (also called '''fiber-reinforced polymer''', or '''fiber-reinforced plastic''') is a [[composite material]] made of a [[polymer]] matrix reinforced with [[fibre]]s. The fibres are usually [[glass fibre|glass]] (in [[fibreglass]]), [[Carbon fibers|carbon]] (in [[carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer]]), [[aramid]], or [[Basalt fibre|basalt]]. Rarely, other fibres such as paper, wood, or [[asbestos]] have been used. The polymer is usually an [[epoxy]], [[vinyl ester resin|vinylester]], or [[polyester]] [[thermosetting plastic]], though [[phenol formaldehyde resin]]s are still in use.

FRPs are commonly used in the aerospace, automotive, marine, and construction industries. They are commonly found in ballistic armor as well.

==Process definition==
A [[polymer]] is generally manufactured by [[step-growth polymerization]] or [[addition polymerization]]. When combined with various agents to enhance or in any way alter the material properties of polymers, the result is referred to as a [[plastic]]. [[Composite material|Composite plastics]] refers to those types of plastics that result from bonding two or more homogeneous materials with different material properties to derive a final product with certain desired material and mechanical properties. Fibre-reinforced plastics are a category of composite plastics that specifically use fibre materials to mechanically enhance the strength and [[Elastic modulus|elasticity]] of plastics.

The original plastic material without fibre reinforcement is known as the [[Composite material#Matrices|matrix]] or [[binder (material)|binding agent]]. The matrix is a tough but relatively weak plastic that is reinforced by stronger stiffer reinforcing filaments or fibres. The extent that strength and elasticity are enhanced in a fibre-reinforced plastic depends on the mechanical properties of both the fibre and matrix, their volume relative to one another, and the fibre length and orientation within the matrix.&lt;ref name="Smallman"&gt;Smallman, R. E., and R.J. Bishop. [https://books.google.com/books?id=S7zWcHBnMzAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Modern+Physical+Metallurgy+and+Materials+Engineering Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering]. 6th ed. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  Reinforcement of the matrix occurs by definition when the FRP material exhibits increased strength or elasticity relative to the strength and elasticity of the matrix alone.&lt;ref name="Gunter"&gt;Erhard, Gunter. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mesU4WbE5CIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Designing+with+Plastics Designing with Plastics]. Trans. Martin Thompson. Munich: Hanser Publishers, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Bakelite]] was the first fibre-reinforced plastic. [[Leo Baekeland]] had originally set out to find a replacement for [[shellac]] (made from the excretion of lac beetles). Chemists had begun to recognize that many natural resins and fibres were polymers, and Baekeland investigated the reactions of phenol and formaldehyde. He first produced a soluble phenol-formaldehyde shellac called "Novolak" that never became a market success, then turned to developing a binder for [[asbestos]] which, at that time, was moulded with rubber. By controlling the pressure and temperature applied to [[phenol]] and [[formaldehyde]], he found in 1905 he could produce his dreamed-of hard mouldable material (the world's first [[synthetic plastic]]): bakelite.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web | last = Amato | first = Ivan | authorlink = | title = Leo Baekeland | work = Time 100 | publisher = [[TIME]] | date = 29 March 1999 | url = http://www.time.com/time/time100/scientist/profile/baekeland.html | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web | last =  | first = | authorlink = | title = Leo Baekeland | work = Plastics | publisher = UK history site | date = 28 June 2000 | url = http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/plastic.htm | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He announced his invention at a meeting of the [[American Chemical Society]] on February 5, 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=New Chemical Substance | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 6, 1909 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/02/06/101025892.pdf | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of fibre-reinforced plastic for commercial use was being extensively researched in the 1930s. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], considerable research was undertaken by pioneers such as [[Norman de Bruyne]]. It was particularly of interest to the aviation industry.&lt;ref&gt;Synthetic Resin – Use in Aircraft Construction, The Times, London England, Monday 5 October 1936, page 14, Issue 47497&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass production of glass strands was discovered in 1932 when [[Games Slayter]], a researcher at [[Owens-Illinois]] accidentally directed a jet of compressed air at a stream of molten glass and produced fibres. A patent for this method of producing glass wool was first applied for in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=0EMBAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=%22G.+Slayter%22 US Patent Number 2133235: Method &amp; Apparatus for Making Glass Wool] First Slayter glass wool patent, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;
Owens joined with the Corning company in 1935 and the method was adapted by Owens Corning to produce its patented "fibreglas" (one "s") in 1936. Originally, fibreglas was a [[glass wool]] with fibres entrapping a great deal of gas, making it useful as an insulator, especially at high temperatures.

A suitable resin for combining the "fibreglas" with a plastic to produce a composite material, was developed in 1936 by [[du Pont]]. The first ancestor of modern polyester resins is [[Cyanamid]]'s resin of 1942. [[Peroxide]] curing systems were used by then.&lt;ref&gt;50 years of reinforced plastic boats, George Marsh, 8 October 2006, http://www.reinforcedplastics.com/view/1461/50-years-of-reinforced-plastic-boats-/&lt;/ref&gt; With the combination of fibreglas and resin the gas content of the material was replaced by plastic. This reduced the insulation properties to values typical of the plastic, but now for the first time the composite showed great strength and promise as a structural and building material. Confusingly, many glass fibre composites continued to be called "[[fibreglass]]" (as a generic name) and the name was also used for the low-density glass wool product containing gas instead of plastic.

Ray Greene of [[Owens Corning]] is credited with producing the first composite boat in 1937, but did not proceed further at the time due to the brittle nature of the plastic used.

[[Carbon fibre]] production began in the late 1950s and was used, though not widely, in British industry beginning in the early 1960s. Aramid fibres were being produced around this time also, appearing first under the trade name [[Nomex]] by [[DuPont]]. Today, each of these fibres is used widely in industry for any applications that require plastics with specific strength or elastic qualities. Glass fibres are the most common across all industries, although carbon-fibre and carbon-fibre-aramid composites are widely found in aerospace, automotive and sporting good applications.&lt;ref name="Gunter"/&gt; These three ([[glass]], carbon, and [[aramid]]) continue to be the important categories of fibre used in FRP.

Global polymer production on the scale present today began in the mid 20th century, when low material and productions costs, new production technologies and new product categories combined to make polymer production economical. The industry finally matured in the late 1970s when world polymer production surpassed that of [[steel]], making polymers the ubiquitous material that they are today. Fibre-reinforced plastics have been a significant aspect of this industry from the beginning.

==Process description==
FRP involves two distinct processes, the first is the process whereby the fibrous material is manufactured and formed, the second is the process whereby fibrous materials are bonded with the matrix during moulding.&lt;ref name="Gunter"/&gt;

===Fibre===

====Manufacture of fibre fabric====
Reinforcing Fibre is manufactured in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional orientations:
#Two-dimensional fibreglass-reinforced polymer is characterized by a laminated structure in which the fibers are only aligned along the plane in [[Cartesian coordinate system|x-direction, and y-direction]] of the material. This means that no fibers are aligned in the through-thickness or the [[Cartesian coordinate system|z-direction]], this lack of alignment in the through thickness can create a disadvantage in cost and processing. Costs and labor increase because conventional processing techniques used to fabricate composites, such as wet hand lay-up, autoclave and resin transfer molding, require a high amount of skilled labor to cut, stack and consolidate into a preformed component.
#Three-dimensional fiberglass-reinforced polymer composites are materials with three-dimensional fiber structures that incorporate fibers in the [[Cartesian coordinate system|x-direction, y-direction and z-direction]]. The development of three-dimensional orientations arose from industry's need to reduce fabrication costs, to increase through-thickness mechanical properties, and to improve impact damage tolerance; all were problems associated with two-dimensional fibre-reinforced polymers.

==== Manufacture of fibre preforms ====
Fibre preforms are how the fibres are manufactured before being bonded to the matrix. Fibre preforms are often manufactured in sheets, continuous mats, or as continuous filaments for spray applications. The four major ways to manufacture the fibre preform is through the textile processing techniques of [[weaving]], [[knitting]], [[braiding]] and [[Stitch (textile arts)|stitching]].

#Weaving can be done in a conventional manner to produce two-dimensional fibres as well in a multilayer weaving that can create three-dimensional fibres. However, multilayer weaving is required to have multiple layers of warp yarns to create fibres in the z- direction creating a few disadvantages in manufacturing,namely the time to set up all the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] yarns on the [[loom]]. Therefore, most multilayer weaving is currently used to produce relatively narrow width products, or high value products where the cost of the preform production is acceptable. Another one of the main problems facing the use of multilayer woven fabrics is the difficulty in producing a fabric that contains fibres oriented with angles other than 0" and 90" to each other respectively.
#The second major way of manufacturing fibre preforms is Braiding. Braiding is suited to the manufacture of narrow width flat or tubular fabric and is not as capable as weaving in the production of large volumes of wide fabrics. Braiding is done over top of mandrels that vary in cross-sectional shape or dimension along their length. Braiding is limited to objects about a brick in size. Unlike standard weaving, braiding can produce fabric that contains fibres at 45-degree angles to one another. Braiding three-dimensional fibres can be done using four step, two-step or Multilayer Interlock Braiding.Four step or row and column braiding utilizes a flat bed containing rows and columns of yarn carriers that form the shape of the desired preform. Additional carriers are added to the outside of the array, the precise location and quantity of which depends upon the exact preform shape and structure required. There are four separate sequences of row and column motion, which act to interlock the yarns and produce the braided preform. The yarns are mechanically forced into the structure between each step to consolidate the structure in a similar process to the use of a reed in weaving. Two-step braiding is unlike the four-step process because the two-step includes a large number of yarns fixed in the axial direction and a fewer number of braiding yarns. The process consists of two steps in which the braiding carriers move completely through the structure between the axial carriers. This relatively simple sequence of motions is capable of forming preforms of essentially any shape, including circular and hollow shapes. Unlike the four-step process, the two-step process does not require mechanical compaction the motions involved in the process allows the braid to be pulled tight by yarn tension alone. The last type of braiding is multi-layer interlocking braiding that consists of a number of standard circular braiders being joined together to form a cylindrical braiding frame. This frame has a number of parallel braiding tracks around the circumference of the cylinder but the mechanism allows the transfer of yarn carriers between adjacent tracks forming a multilayer braided fabric with yarns interlocking to adjacent layers. The multilayer interlock braid differs from both the four step and two-step braids in that the interlocking yarns are primarily in the plane of the structure and thus do not significantly reduce the in-plane properties of the preform. The four-step and two-step processes produce a greater degree of interlinking as the braiding yarns travel through the thickness of the preform, but therefore contribute less to the in-plane performance of the preform. A disadvantage of the multilayer interlock equipment is that due to the conventional sinusoidal movement of the yarn carriers to form the preform, the equipment is not able to have the density of yarn carriers that is possible with the two step and four step machines.
#Knitting fibre preforms can be done with the traditional methods of Warp and [Weft] Knitting, and the fabric produced is often regarded by many as two-dimensional fabric, but machines with two or more needle beds are capable of producing multilayer fabrics with yams that traverse between the layers. Developments in electronic controls for needle selection and knit loop transfer, and in the sophisticated mechanisms that allow specific areas of the fabric to be held and their movement controlled. This has allowed the fabric to form itself into the required three-dimensional preform shape with a minimum of material wastage.
#Stitching is arguably the simplest of the four main textile manufacturing techniques and one that can be performed with the smallest investment in specialized machinery. Basically stitching consists of inserting a needle, carrying the stitch thread, through a stack of fabric layers to form a 3D structure. The advantages of stitching are that it is possible to stitch both dry and prepreg fabric, although the tackiness of the prepreg makes the process difficult and generally creates more damage within the prepreg material than in the dry fabric. Stitching also utilizes the standard two-dimensional fabrics that are commonly in use within the composite industry therefore there is a sense of familiarity concerning the material systems. The use of standard fabric also allows a greater degree of flexibility in the fabric lay-up of the component than is possible with the other textile processes, which have restrictions on the fibre orientations that can be produced.&lt;ref&gt;Tong, L, A.P. Mouritz, and M.k. Bannister. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QWfsk0_vFWAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=3D+Fibre+Reinforced+Polymer+Composites 3D Fibre-Reinforced Polymer Composites]. Oxford: Elsevier, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forming processes===
A rigid structure is usually used to establish the shape of FRP components. Parts can be laid up on a flat surface referred to as a "caul plate" or on a cylindrical structure referred to as a "mandrel". However, most fibre-reinforced plastic parts are created with a mold or "tool." Molds can be concave female molds, male molds, or the mold can completely enclose the part with a top and bottom mold.

The [[Moulding (process)|moulding processes]] of FRP plastics begins by placing the fibre preform on or in the mold. The fibre preform can be dry fibre, or fibre that already contains a measured amount of resin called "prepreg". Dry fibres are "wetted" with resin either by hand or the resin is injected into a closed mold. The part is then cured, leaving the  matrix and fibres in the shape created by the mold. Heat and/or pressure are sometimes used to cure the resin and improve the quality of the final part.
The different methods of forming are listed below.

====Bladder moulding====
Individual sheets of prepreg material are laid up and placed in a female-style mould along with a balloon-like bladder. The mould is closed and placed in a heated press. Finally, the bladder is pressurized forcing the layers of material against the mould walls.

====Compression moulding====
When the raw material (plastic block,rubber block, plastic sheet, or granules) contains reinforcing fibres, a compression molded part qualifies as a fibre-reinforced plastic. More typically the plastic preform used in compression molding does not contain reinforcing fibres. In compression molding, a "preform" or "charge", of [[Sheet moulding compound|SMC]], BMC is placed into mould cavity. The mould is closed and the material is formed &amp; cured inside by pressure and heat. Compression moulding offers excellent detailing for geometric shapes ranging from pattern and relief detailing to complex curves and creative forms, to [[precision engineering]] all within a maximum curing time of 20 minutes.&lt;ref name="quatro"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215010801/http://www.quatrocomposites.com/comp101proc.htm|title=Quatro Composites Processes 101: Molding Carbon Composite Parts|author=|date=15 February 2008|website=archive.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Autoclave and vacuum bag====
Individual sheets of prepreg material are laid-up and placed in an open mold. The material is covered with release film, bleeder/breather material and a [[Composite material#Vacuum bag moulding|vacuum bag]]. A vacuum is pulled on part and the entire mould is placed into an autoclave (heated pressure vessel). The part is cured with a continuous vacuum to extract entrapped gasses from laminate. This is a very common process in the aerospace industry because it affords precise control over moulding due to a long, slow cure cycle that is anywhere from one to several hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dogan|first=Fatih|author2=Hadavinia, Homayoun |author3=Donchev, Todor |author4= Bhonge, Prasannakumar S. |title=Delamination of impacted composite structures by cohesive zone interface elements and tiebreak contact|journal=Central European Journal of Engineering|date=5 August 2012|volume=2|issue=4|pages=612–626|doi=10.2478/s13531-012-0018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This precise control creates the exact laminate geometric forms needed to ensure strength and safety in the aerospace industry, but it is also slow and labour-intensive, meaning costs often confine it to the aerospace industry.&lt;ref name="quatro"/&gt;

====Mandrel wrapping====
Sheets of prepreg material are wrapped around a steel or aluminium mandrel. The prepreg material is compacted by nylon or polypropylene cello tape. Parts are typically batch cured by vacuum bagging and hanging in an oven. After cure, the cello and mandrel are removed leaving a hollow carbon tube. This process creates strong and robust hollow carbon tubes.

====Wet layup====
Wet layup forming combines fibre reinforcement and the matrix as they are placed on the forming tool.&lt;ref name="Gunter"/&gt; Reinforcing Fibre layers are placed in an open mould and then saturated with a wet [[resin]] by pouring it over the fabric and working it into the fabric. The mould is then left so that the resin will cure, usually at room temperature, though heat is sometimes used to ensure a proper cure. Sometimes a vacuum bag is used to compress a wet layup. Glass fibres are most commonly used for this process, the results are widely known as [[fibreglass]], and is used to make common products like skis, canoes, kayaks and surf boards.&lt;ref name="quatro"/&gt;

====Chopper gun====
Continuous strands of fibreglass are pushed through a hand-held gun that both chops the strands and combines them with a catalysed resin such as polyester. The impregnated chopped glass is shot onto the mould surface in whatever thickness and design the human operator thinks is appropriate. This process is good for large production runs at economical cost, but produces geometric shapes with less strength than other moulding processes and has poor dimensional tolerance.&lt;ref name="quatro"/&gt;

====Filament winding====
[[Continuous filament winding machine|Machines]] pull fibre bundles through a wet bath of resin and wound over a rotating steel mandrel in specific orientations Parts are cured either room temperature or elevated temperatures. Mandrel is extracted, leaving a final geometric shape but can be left in some cases.&lt;ref name="quatro"/&gt;

====Pultrusion====
Fibre bundles and slit fabrics are pulled through a wet bath of resin and formed into the rough part shape. Saturated material is extruded from a heated closed die curing while being continuously pulled through die. Some of the end products of pultrusion are structural shapes, i.e. I beam, angle, channel and flat sheet. These materials can be used to create all sorts of fibreglass structures such as ladders, platforms, handrail systems tank, pipe and pump supports.&lt;ref name="quatro"/&gt;

====Resin transfer molding====
Also called '''resin infusion'''. Fabrics are placed into a mould into which wet resin is then injected. Resin is typically pressurized and forced into a cavity which is under vacuum in [[Out of autoclave composite manufacturing|resin transfer molding]]. Resin is entirely pulled into cavity under vacuum in vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding. This moulding process allows precise tolerances and detailed shaping, but can sometimes fail to fully saturate the fabric leading to weak spots in the final shape.&lt;ref name="quatro"/&gt;

==Advantages and limitations==
FRP allows the alignment of the glass fibres of thermoplastics to suit specific design programs. Specifying the orientation of reinforcing fibres can increase the strength and resistance to deformation of the polymer. Glass reinforced polymers are strongest and most resistive to deforming forces when the polymers fibres are parallel to the force being exerted, and are weakest when the fibres are perpendicular. Thus, this ability is at once both an advantage or a limitation depending on the context of use. Weak spots of perpendicular fibres can be used for natural hinges and connections, but can also lead to material failure when production processes fail to properly orient the fibres parallel to expected forces. When forces are exerted perpendicular to the orientation of fibres, the strength and elasticity of the polymer is less than the matrix alone. In cast resin components made of glass reinforced polymers such as UP and EP, the orientation of fibres can be oriented in two-dimensional and three-dimensional weaves. This means that when forces are possibly perpendicular to one orientation, they are parallel to another orientation; this eliminates the potential for weak spots in the polymer.

===Failure modes===
Structural failure can occur in FRP materials when:
*Tensile forces stretch the matrix more than the fibres, causing the material to shear at the interface between matrix and fibres.
*Tensile forces near the end of the fibres exceed the tolerances of the matrix, separating the fibres from the matrix.
*Tensile forces can also exceed the tolerances of the fibres causing the fibres themselves to fracture leading to material failure.&lt;ref name="Gunter"/&gt;

==Material requirements==
{{see also|Basalt fibre}}
A [[thermoset polymer matrix]] material, or engineering grade thermoplastic polymer matrix material, must meet certain requirements in order to first be suitable for FRPs and ensure a successful reinforcement of itself. The matrix must be able to properly saturate, and preferably bond chemically with the fibre reinforcement for maximum adhesion within a suitable curing period. The matrix must also completely envelop the fibres to protect them from cuts and notches that would reduce their strength, and to transfer forces to the fibres. The fibres must also be kept separate from each other so that if failure occurs it is localized as much as possible, and if failure occurs the matrix must also debond from the fibre for similar reasons. Finally, the matrix should be of a plastic that remains chemically and physically stable during and after the reinforcement and moulding processes. To be suitable as reinforcement material, fibre additives must increase the tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of the matrix and meet the following conditions; fibres must exceed critical fibre content; the strength and rigidity of fibres itself must exceed the strength and rigidity of the matrix alone; and there must be optimum bonding between fibres and matrix

===Glass fibre===
{{further|Fibreglass}}
"Fibreglass reinforced plastics" or FRPs (commonly referred to simply as [[fibreglass]]) use textile grade [[glass fibre]]s. These textile fibres are different from other forms of glass fibres used to deliberately trap air, for insulating applications (see [[glass wool]]). Textile glass fibres begin as varying combinations of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CaO, or MgO in powder form. These mixtures are then heated through direct melting to temperatures around 1300 degrees Celsius, after which dies are used to extrude filaments of glass fibre in diameter ranging from 9 to 17&amp;nbsp;µm. These filaments are then wound into larger threads and spun onto bobbins for transportation and further processing. Glass fibre is by far the most popular means to reinforce plastic and thus enjoys a wealth of production processes, some of which are applicable to aramid and carbon fibres as well owing to their shared fibrous qualities.

Roving is a process where filaments are spun into larger diameter threads. These threads are then commonly used for woven reinforcing glass fabrics and mats, and in spray applications.

Fibre fabrics are web-form fabric reinforcing material that has both warp and weft directions. Fibre mats are web-form non-woven mats of glass fibres. Mats are manufactured in cut dimensions with chopped fibres, or in continuous mats using continuous fibres. Chopped fibre glass is used in processes where lengths of glass threads are cut between 3 and 26&amp;nbsp;mm, threads are then used in plastics most commonly intended for moulding processes. Glass fibre short strands are short 0.2–0.3&amp;nbsp;mm strands of glass fibres that are used to reinforce thermoplastics most commonly for injection moulding.

===Carbon fibre===
{{main article|carbon (fibre)|l1=Carbon fibre}}

Carbon fibres are created when polyacrylonitrile fibres (PAN), Pitch resins, or Rayon are carbonized (through oxidation and thermal pyrolysis) at high temperatures. Through further processes of graphitizing or stretching, the fibres strength or elasticity can be enhanced respectively. Carbon fibres are manufactured in diameters analogous to glass fibres with diameters ranging from 4 to 17&amp;nbsp;µm. These fibres wound into larger threads for transportation and further production processes.&lt;ref name="Gunter"/&gt;  Further production processes include weaving or braiding into carbon fabrics, cloths and mats analogous to those described for glass that can then be used in actual reinforcements.&lt;ref name="Smallman"/&gt;

===Aramid fibre===
{{main article|Aramid|l1=Aramid}}
Aramid fibres are most commonly known as Kevlar, Nomex and Technora. Aramids are generally prepared by the reaction between an amine group and a carboxylic acid halide group (aramid);.&lt;ref name="Smallman"/&gt; Commonly, this occurs when an aromatic polyamide is spun from a liquid concentration of sulphuric acid into a crystallized fibre.&lt;ref name="Gunter"/&gt; Fibres are then spun into larger threads in order to weave into large ropes or woven fabrics (Aramid).&lt;ref name="Smallman"/&gt; Aramid fibres are manufactured with varying grades to based on varying qualities for strength and rigidity, so that the material can be somewhat tailored to specific design needs concerns, such as cutting the tough material during manufacture.&lt;ref name="Gunter"/&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Glass-aramid-hybrid-area used-for-reinforced-plastics.jpg|thumb|Glass-aramid-hybrid fabric (for high tension and compression)]]
Fibre-reinforced plastics are best suited for any design program that demands weight savings, precision engineering, finite tolerances, and the simplification of parts in both production and operation. A moulded polymer artefact is cheaper, faster, and easier to manufacture than cast aluminium or steel artefact, and maintains similar and sometimes better tolerances and material strengths.

=== Structural applications ===
FRP can be applied to strengthen the [[Beam (structure)|beams]], [[column]]s, and [[Concrete slab|slabs]] of buildings and bridges. It is possible to increase the strength of structural members even after they have been severely damaged due to [[Structural loads|loading]] conditions. In the case of damaged [[reinforced concrete]] members, this would first require the repair of the member by removing loose debris and filling in cavities and cracks with [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] or [[Epoxy|epoxy resin]]. Once the member is repaired, strengthening can be achieved through wet, hand lay-up of impregnating the [[Carbon (fibre)|fibre sheets]] with epoxy resin then applying them to the cleaned and prepared surfaces of the member.

Two techniques are typically adopted for the strengthening of beams, relating to the strength enhancement desired: [[flexural strength]]ening or [[shear strength]]ening. In many cases it may be necessary to provide both strength enhancements. For the flexural strengthening of a beam, FRP sheets or plates are applied to the tension face of the member (the bottom face for a simply supported member with applied top loading or gravity loading). Principal tensile fibres are oriented in the beam longitudinal axis, similar to its internal flexural steel reinforcement. This increases the beam strength and its [[stiffness]] ([[structural load|load]] required to cause unit deflection), however decreases the [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection capacity]] and ductility.

For the shear strengthening of a beam, the FRP is applied on the web (sides) of a member with fibres oriented transverse to the beam's longitudinal axis. Resisting of shear forces is achieved in a similar manner as [[rebar|internal steel stirrups]], by bridging shear cracks that form under applied loading. FRP can be applied in several configurations, depending on the exposed faces of the member and the degree of strengthening desired, this includes: side bonding, U-wraps (U-jackets), and closed wraps (complete wraps). Side bonding involves applying FRP to the sides of the beam only. It provides the least amount of shear strengthening due to failures caused by [[Adhesive#Failure of the adhesive joint|de-bonding]] from the concrete surface at the FRP free edges. For U-wraps, the FRP is applied continuously in a 'U' shape around the sides and bottom (tension) face of the beam. If all faces of a beam are accessible, the use of closed wraps is desirable as they provide the most strength enhancement. Closed wrapping involves applying FRP around the entire perimeter of the member, such that there are no free ends and the typical failure mode is [[fracture|rupture]] of the fibres. For all wrap configurations, the FRP can be applied along the length of the member as a continuous sheet or as discrete strips, having a predefined minimum width and spacing.

Slabs may be strengthened by applying FRP strips at their bottom (tension) face. This will result in better flexural performance, since the tensile resistance of the slabs is supplemented by the tensile strength of FRP. In the case of beams and slabs, the effectiveness of FRP strengthening depends on the performance of the resin chosen for bonding. This is particularly an issue for shear strengthening using side bonding or U-wraps. Columns are typically wrapped with FRP around their perimeter, as with closed or complete wrapping. This not only results in higher shear resistance, but more crucial for [[reinforced concrete column|column design]], it results in increased compressive strength under axial loading. The FRP wrap works by restraining the lateral expansion of the column, which can enhance confinement in a similar manner as spiral reinforcement does for the column core.

=== Elevator cable ===
In June 2013, KONE elevator company announced Ultrarope for use as a replacement for steel cables in elevators. It seals the carbon fibres in high-friction [[polymer]]. Unlike steel cable, Ultrarope was designed for buildings that require up to 1,000 meters of lift. Steel elevators top out at 500 meters. The company estimated that in a 500-meter-high building, an elevator would use 15 per cent less electrical power than a steel-cabled version. As of June 2013, the product had passed all European Union and US certification tests.&lt;ref name="phys"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-06-ultrarope-one-stop-tall.html |title=UltraRope announced to one-stop zoom up tall buildings |publisher=Phys.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design considerations==
FRP is used in designs that require a measure of strength or modulus of elasticity that non-reinforced plastics and other material choices are either ill-suited for mechanically or economically. This means that the primary design consideration for using FRP is to ensure that the material is used economically and in a manner that takes advantage of its structural enhancements specifically. This is however not always the case, the orientation of fibres also creates a material weakness perpendicular to the fibres. Thus the use of fibre reinforcement and their orientation affects the strength, rigidity, and elasticity of a final form and hence the operation of the final product itself. Orienting the direction of fibres either, unidirectional, 2-dimensionally, or 3-dimensionally during production affects the degree of strength, flexibility, and elasticity of the final product. Fibres oriented in the direction of forces display greater resistance to distortion from these forces and vice versa, thus areas of a product that must withstand forces will be reinforced with fibres in the same direction, and areas that require flexibility, such as natural hinges, will use fibres in a perpendicular direction to forces.

Using more dimensions avoids this either-or scenario and creates objects that seek to avoid any specific weak points due to the unidirectional orientation of fibres. The properties of strength, flexibility and elasticity can also be magnified or diminished through the geometric shape and design of the final product. These include such design consideration such as ensuring proper wall thickness and creating multifunctional geometric shapes that can be moulding as single pieces, creating shapes that have more material and structural integrity by reducing joints, connections, and hardware.&lt;ref name="Gunter"/&gt;

===Disposal and recycling concerns===
As a subset of plastic FR plastics are liable to a number of the issues and concerns in [[plastic pollution|plastic waste]] disposal and recycling. Plastics pose a particular challenge in recycling because they are derived from polymers and monomers that often cannot be separated and returned to their virgin states, for this reason not all plastics can be recycled for re-use, in fact some estimates claim only 20% to 30% of plastics can be recycled at all. Fibre-reinforced plastics and their matrices share these disposal and environmental concerns. Investigation of safe disposal methods has led to two main variations involving the application of intense heat: in one binding agents are burned off - in the process recapturing some of the sunk material cost in the form of heat - and incombustible elements captured by filtration; in the other the incombustible material is burned in a cement kiln, the fibres becoming an integral part of the resulting cast material.&lt;ref&gt;https://compositesuk.co.uk/system/files/documents/Composite%20Recycling.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to concerns regarding safe disposal  the fact that the fibres themselves are difficult to remove from the matrix and preserve for re-use means FRP's amplify these challenges. FRP's are inherently difficult to separate into base materials, that is into fibre and matrix, and the matrix is difficult to separate into usable plastics, polymers, and monomers. These are all concerns for environmentally-informed design today. Plastics do often offer savings in energy and economic savings in comparison to other materials. In addition, with the advent of new more environmentally friendly matrices such as [[bioplastic]]s and [[ultraviolet|UV]]-degradable plastics, FRP will gain environmental sensitivity.&lt;ref name="Smallman"/&gt;

The '''Ford Ranger''' is a [[pickup truck#compact|compact pickup truck]] that was manufactured and marketed by [[Ford Motor Company]] from 1983 to 2012 model years for North America. From 1997 to 2011, a version was also manufactured and sold in South America. Introduced to replace the [[Mazda B-Series#Ford Courier|Ford Courier]] produced in Japan by [[Mazda]], the Ranger had two distinct generations. While introduced a year after the [[Chevrolet S-10]], the Ranger would go on to become the best-selling compact truck in the United States from 1987 to 2004.&lt;ref name="American Ford Ranger"&gt;[http://www.carautoportal.com/ford/ford-ranger.php Ford Ranger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524113338/http://www.carautoportal.com/ford/ford-ranger.php |date=May 24, 2011 }} – Accessed March 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Over its production life, the chassis and suspension of the Ranger would be used for several compact Ford trucks and [[sport-utility vehicle]]s. During the 1990s and 2000s, Mazda adopted a badge-engineered version of the Ranger, for their B-Series nameplate (the reverse of the Ford Courier produced by Mazda).

Over its 29-year production run, Ford produced the Ranger at three different assembly plants in North America. The Ranger was produced at the [[Louisville Assembly Plant]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] from 1982 to 1999. From 1993 to 2004, production also was sourced from [[Edison Assembly]] in [[Edison, New Jersey]]. For its entire production run, the Ranger was produced at [[Twin Cities Assembly Plant]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]. The final 2012 Ford Ranger produced on December 16, 2011, ended 86 years of production at Twin Cities Assembly as well as the production of all compact pickups in the United States.

In 2017, Ford announced the return of the Ford Ranger to North America, commencing with the 2019 model year.  Derived from the [[Ford Ranger (T6)|Ranger T6]], the 2019 Ford Ranger will be manufactured in the United States.

== Development ==
[[File:1975 Ford Courier, right side view.jpg|left|thumb|1975 Ford Courier]]

=== Ford Courier (1972–1982) ===
For the 1972 model year, the Ford Courier was introduced as the first compact pickup truck sold by Ford.  Following the rise of the compact truck segment during the 1960s, Ford entered into a partnership with Mazda to market the [[Mazda B-Series#Ford Courier|Mazda B1800]] in North America; the Courier would become the first of several jointly manufactured vehicles between the two companies from the 1970s into the 2000s.  Along with minimizing the risk for Ford of developing a vehicle in an unfamiliar market segment, the partnership provided Mazda with critically needed funds.&lt;ref name="WC85y"&gt;{{Citation|last=Yamaguchi|first=Jack K.|title=Japan: Lucrative Contraction|journal=World Cars 1985|page=49|year=1985|editor-last=Lösch|editor-first=Annamaria|location=Pelham, NY|publisher=The Automobile Club of Italy/Herald Books|isbn=0-910714-17-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;        

While sharing the cab and chassis with its Mazda counterpart, to increase its sales potential in North America, the Courier adapted design elements of the [[Ford F-Series (fifth generation)|Ford F-Series]], with twin round headlamps, silver grille, and "FORD" lettering on the hood above the grille.  In 1977, the Courier and B1800 (later B2000) were redesigned with a larger cab, redesigned pickup bed, and tailgate.  While closer in appearance to its Mazda counterpart, the Courier was given signal/parking lamps inset in the grille (rather than the bumper); an optional 2.3L Ford engine was not available the Mazda pickups.            

From 1972 to 1982, the Ford Courier was manufactured alongside the Mazda B-Series in [[Hiroshima|Hiroshima, Japan]].  To avoid the 25% "[[Chicken tax]]" on imported trucks, both vehicles were imported as [[Chassis cab|cab-chassis trucks]] (taxed at 4% tariff).  Following their importation to United States, pickup-truck beds shipped separately from Japan were installed before shipment to dealers.      

=== Project Yuma: Ford Ranger development (1976–1982) ===
In 1976, Ford commenced development on "Project Yuma", intended to bring a domestically produced compact truck to production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.motortrend.com/news/1983-ford-ranger-feature-flashback/|title=Feature Flashback: 1983 Ford Ranger - Motor Trend|date=2017-07-24|work=Motor Trend|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Clark, Jim|date=December 1981|title=Development of the Ranger|url=http://www.therangerstation.com/resources/pdf_documents/ranger.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Mini-Truck|pages=26–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to develop a successor for the Courier, the $700 million project was driven in an effort to comply with fuel economy standards of the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;  At the beginning of Yuma, Ford predicted for that the company to properly comply with [[CAFE]] by 1985, nearly 50% of pickup trucks sold in the United States would require a 4-cylinder engine, leading from compact truck sales to expand from a 5% market share in 1976 to nearly 50% in 1985, with nearly a million sales per year.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;       

Project Yuma was centered around quality and fuel efficiency.&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;  At the beginning of the project, Ford researched additional elements that were valued by potential compact truck buyers.&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;  Along with the flexibility for both work and personal use,  Ford found that buyers desired additional interior room, including three-across seating, comfortable seats, and headroom and legroom for a six-foot tall driver; other minor details were discovered such as five-bolt wheels and a larger ashtray.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;      

During design, the body underwent extensive [[wind tunnel]] testing, to meet a planned 20 MPG fuel efficiency target (the standard front bumper spoiler added 1MPG on its own).&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;  To further improve fuel economy, the Ranger increased the use of high-strength steel other lightweight materials, including a magnesium clutch housing, aluminum [[transfer case]] for four-wheel drive versions, and a magnesium clutch/brake pedal bracket.&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;  To further save weight, the design of the front suspension was computer-optimized, rendering the front stabilizer bar optional.&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;  Though narrower than the F-Series and other full-size competitors, the cargo bed of the Ranger was designed to transport a four-foot wide sheet of material (considered an industry measure of space in pickup truck bed design) through the use of recesses to insert supports across the bed, allowing the Ranger to transport such material above the wheel wells.&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;  

The [[1979 oil crisis|1979 fuel crisis]] nearly doomed the Yuma/Ranger project, as it occurred between launch of the 1979 [[Ford LTD (Americas)|Ford LTD]] and 1980 [[Ford F-Series (seventh generation)|Ford F-Series]].  After selling nearly 1 million F-Series trucks in 1978, in 1980, Ford had yet to gain a profit from its redesign of the F-Series.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Ford President [[Donald Petersen|Don Petersen]] kept the compact truck project alive for several reasons.  By 1980, General Motors had its own compact truck in development, with the [[Chevrolet S-10]] providing close competition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Peterson also felt the compact truck could be priced similar to the F-100, as he felt buyers would pay as much for a compact truck as a full-size one, if equipped correctly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   

Around 1980, the Project Yuma truck became known as the Ford Ranger, adopting the name of the mid to upper-level trim used by the Ford F-Series and Bronco since 1965.   In anticipation of the compact truck line, 1981 marked the final use of the Ranger trim for the F-Series and Bronco (replaced by XLS for 1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.therangerstation.com/articles/ford-ranger-name-history/|title=Ford Ranger Name History  : The Ranger Station|website=www.therangerstation.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.therangerstation.com/articles/history-of-the-ford-ranger/|title=History of the Ford Ranger  : The Ranger Station|website=www.therangerstation.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Ranger rolled off the [[Louisville Assembly Plant|Louisville]] assembly line on January 18, 1982.&lt;ref name="Wards83"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1983|publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc|year=1983|editor=Stark, Harry A|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While initially slated for a traditional autumn release, to more closely compete with the introduction of the [[Chevrolet S-10]], Ford advanced the launch of the 1983 Ranger several months, with the first vehicles reaching showrooms in March 1982.&lt;ref name="Wards82"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1982|publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc|year=1982|editor=Stark, Harry A|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Initially sold along its Courier predecessor, the first 1983 Ranger was priced at $6,203 ($16,570 in 2018)&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.  While far smaller in exterior size than the F-Series, 4x4 Rangers offered a payload of 1,600 pounds&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edmunds.com/ford/ranger/history.html|title=Ford Ranger History|work=Edmunds|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;, matching or exceeding the F-100 in payload capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/FMC%20Trucks-Vans/1982%20Trucks/1982%20Ford%20Pickup%20Brochure/image11.html|title=1982 Ford Pickup Brochure|last=Ristic-Petrovic|first=Dusan|website=www.oldcarbrochures.com|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For 1984, the [[Ford Bronco II]] two-door SUV was introduced.  Similar in size to the 1966–1977 Bronco, the Bronco II used a shortened version of the Ranger chassis, along with much of its interior components.

For the 1989 model year, the Ranger underwent a major mid-cycle revision to improve its exterior aerodynamics and interior ergonomics.  For 1991, the [[Ford Explorer]] SUV was derived from the facelifted Ranger, sharing its front fascia, chassis, and interior components.      

=== Chassis specification ===
The first-generation Ranger uses a body-on-frame chassis design; while using a chassis developed specifically for the model line, the Ranger adopts many chassis design elements from the F-Series.&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;  Along with traditional leaf-spring rear suspension, the Ranger is fitted with [[Twin I-Beam]] independent front suspension.  To minimize [[Unsprung mass|unsprung weight]], the Twin I-Beams were constructed of stamped high-strength steel (rather than forged steel).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;

Rear-wheel drive was standard, with part-time four-wheel drive as an option (never offered in the Courier).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;   Dependent on configuration, the Ranger was produced in three wheelbases: 107.9 inches (6-foot bed), 113.9 inches (7-foot bed), and 125 inches (SuperCab, introduced in 1986).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  

For 1989, rear-wheel anti-lock brakes became standard.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Powertrain ====
From 1983 to 1992, the first-generation Ranger was powered by 2.0L and 2.3L versions of the Ford [[Ford Pinto engine|''Pinto'']] inline-4, the 2.8L, 2.9L, and 4.0L Ford [[Ford Cologne V6 engine|''Cologne V6'']], the 3.0L Ford [[Ford Vulcan engine|''Vulcan V6'']], and four-cylinder diesel engines sourced from Mazda (Perkins) and Mitsubishi.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dieselhub.com/rigs/ford-ranger-diesel.html|title=Ford Ranger Diesel History - 2.2L Perkins &amp; 2.3L Mitsubishi Diesels|website=www.dieselhub.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two long-running engines associated with the Ford light trucks made their debut in the first-generation Ranger; the twin spark-plug version (with distributorless ignition) of the Pinto engine was introduced in 1989, remaining in use through 2001.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bymodel/1988_Ford_Ranger_Pickup.shtml|title=1988 MPG ratings|accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990, the 4.0L Cologne V6 was introduced; in modified form, the engine was used through the 2012 model-year discontinuation of the Ranger in North America.  

A four-speed manual transmission was standard on all engines for 1983 and 1984, with a five-speed manual as an option; a three-speed automatic was offered on 2.3L and 2.8L engines.  For 1985, the five-speed manual became the standard transmission, with a four-speed automatic offered on non-diesel Rangers.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  For 1989, the Mazda [[Mazda M5OD transmission|M5OD-R1 transmission]] became the standard transmission

=== Body design ===
Slightly larger than the Courier, the first-generation Ranger was approximately 18 inches shorter and 11 inches narrower than an equivalently configured F-100/F-150.&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;  While proportioned similar to the Chevrolet S-10 and Japanese-sourced compact trucks, adopted exterior design elements from the F-Series, including its twin headlamps, chrome grille, tailgate lettering, taillamps, and cab proportions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  In line with the Courier, the Ranger was offered with two pickup bed sizes; a standard 6-foot length and an extended 7-foot length.  In 1986, a third configuration was introduced, as the Ranger SuperCab extended cab was introduced.  Stretched 17 inches behind the front doors for additional cab space, the SuperCab was offered with the 6-foot bed length; four-wheel drive SuperCabs were sold only with V6 engines.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  

During its production, the first-generation Ranger was offered with several seating configurations.  A three-passenger bench seat was standard, with various types of bucket seats offered (dependent on trim level).  As part of the 1989 mid-cycle update, a 40/60 split-bench seat was introduced.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The SuperCab was offered with a pair of center-facing jump seats, expanding capacity to five.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  

From 1983 to 1988, the interior saw few major revisions.  In 1986, the instrument cluster was revised, allowing the fitment of a tachometer.  To streamline production, the Ranger shared interior components with other Ford vehicles, sharing the steering column, door handles, and window controls from the Ford Escort, Ford F-Series, and Ford Bronco; nearly the entire driver's compartment of the Ford Bronco II was directly sourced from the Ranger.  

For 1989, the Ranger underwent a mid-cycle redesign with new front fenders, a restyled hood and grille, and flush-mounted composite headlamps (with larger marker lamps).  To further improve aerodynamics, the front bumper was redesigned and enlarged to fit more closely with the front fenders.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The interior was given a redesign, including new door panels, new seats, and an all-new dashboard (introducing a glovebox).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  To improve ergonomics, the instrument panel was redesigned for improved legibility, with automatic transmission Rangers receiving a column-mounted gearshift; manual-transmission versions saw the removal of the key-release button from the steering column.    &lt;gallery mode="packed" caption="1983–1992 Ford Ranger"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Trim ===
The first-generation Ranger was marketed in five trim levels: Ranger S, Ranger, Ranger XL, Ranger XLS, and Ranger XLT.  Intended largely for fleet sales, the Ranger S (introduced in 1984&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;) was offered with virtually no available options.  While still largely a work truck, the Ranger XL offered color-keyed trim, floor mats, and chrome bumpers.  The XLS was marketed as the sportiest version of the Ranger, offering bucket seats, blackout trim, and tape stripe packages (essentially the successor to the 1970s "''Free Wheeling''" trims) while the XLT was offered with two-tone exteriors, chrome exterior trim, and upgraded interior trim.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  

The Ranger STX was introduced in 1985 for Ranger 4x4s on the West Coast of the United States, becoming fully available for 1986.  Offering a "sport" suspension and larger tires, the STX was denoted by the offering of a bucket-seat interior and model-specific two-tone paint scheme.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  

==== Ranger GT ====
Following an initial late 1986 introduction in California, Ford marketed the Ranger GT option package from 1987 to 1989.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.therangerstation.com/articles/ford-ranger-gt-history/|title=Ford Ranger GT History  : The Ranger Station|website=www.therangerstation.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marketed as a "sport pickup", the Ranger GT was offered only for regular-cab two-wheel drive Rangers.  Powered by a 140 hp 2.9L V6 (paired with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission)&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;,  the Ranger GT was equipped with front and rear [[Anti-roll bar|anti-roll bars]], a limited-slip differential, and performance tires.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  Initially offered for short-bed Rangers, the Ranger GT package became available for long-bed two-wheel drive Rangers.  

The Ranger GT was available in either red, white, or blue paint colors; chrome trim was painted body color.  In 1988, the exterior was modified, with a ground effects package, including a redesigned body-color front bumper, allowing for integrated fog lamps.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;      

For 1990, the Ranger GT was discontinued; a one-off prototype was constructed in 1989 by the Ford Truck Public Affairs office, using a V6 from a [[Ford Taurus SHO]] and a 5-speed transmission from a Mustang GT.&lt;ref name="SHORanger"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=Frank|title=SHO Down: Have you stomped in a Ford lately?|journal=[[Minitruckin']]|issue=Spring 1990|pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SHORanger2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rockledge.home.comcast.net/~rockledge/RangerPictureGallery/SHO/SHORanger.pdf|title=SHO Ranger article copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723045856/http://rockledge.home.comcast.net/~rockledge/RangerPictureGallery/SHO/SHORanger.pdf|archivedate=July 23, 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=August 8, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The redesign in 1992 for 1993 featured mild restyling, flush-mounted door glass, wider doors, and slight fender flares. The 1989-style dashboard remained, but the seats and door panels were new. A six digit odometer was added for 1994. The 2.9-liter engine was discontinued. The engines offered were offered in displacements of 2.3, 3.0 and 4.0&amp;nbsp;liters. A new "Splash" model was introduced, which had a flare side bed, unique chrome wheels, {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=on}} lowered rear suspension and a {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=on}} lowered front suspension (on 4x2 models), and special vinyl "Splash" decals on the sides and the tailgate.

The 1993 Splash trim level was offered with regular cab in arctic white, gloss black, red orange, and sky blue. The Mazda B-Series became a re-badged Ranger for the 1994 model year, but the Mazda B-Series did not offer an equivalent to the Splash model. While 1993 Rangers used R-12 Freon, 1994 model year saw the transition to CFC-free air-conditioning systems in compliance with the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]. For the 1994 model year, the Splash trim had options which all included; a {{convert|1|in|mm|0|adj=on}} lowered rear suspension and {{convert|2|in|mm|0|adj=on}} lowered front suspension (on 4x2 models), flare side bed, an extended cab, and unique chrome wheels. The decals also underwent subtle changes. While the 1993–1994 models sported red, yellow and blue stripes, the 1995 to 1996 models had lime green stripes. Additionally, the available colors for the Splash model changed from the 1993–1994 models to the 1995–1997 models. The latter were offered in maroon, gloss black, white, and canary yellow.

Fall 1994 production (1995 model year) included a steering wheel modified to include a driver's side [[airbag]] and a redesigned dashboard which included a double DIN radio [[head unit]]. Also for 1995 (model year), SuperCab trucks could have a power driver's seat. The A4LD transmission was updated. 2.3- and 3.0-liter models got the ''4R44E'', while 4.0-liter trucks got the ''4R55E''. The front brakes were changed to use the same two-piston brake calipers as the second-generation [[Ford Explorer|Explorer]], and four-wheel anti-lock brakes were added as standard on 4x4 and 4.0-liter models. From October 1995 (1996 model year), an optional passenger airbag (the first compact truck to offer one) became available, with a key-operated cutoff switch that allowed the airbag to be turned off for smaller passengers riding in the front seat. In October 1996, the 1997 model year brought in the first ever five-speed automatic transmission to be used by an American manufacturer. The 4.0-liter models were equipped with the ''5R55E'', while the 3.0-liter was still mated to the ''4R44E''.

In 1997 for the 1998 model year, the Ranger got a major update to the same body design, by giving it a longer wheelbase and a {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} longer cab for the regular cab models (part of which provided more room in the interior). The 1995 to 1997 model year interior look was retained. The Twin I-Beam front suspension was replaced by the wishbone-style system found on the Explorer and the front half of the frame was of "boxed", rather than C-channel construction. Rack and pinion steering was also added. The four-cylinder engine was increased to a 2.5-liter [[SOHC]] I4, giving it a 6% increase in power over the old 2.3-liter. It produced {{convert|117|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|149|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Also, for the 2000 model year, amber rear turn signals were discontinued. 4x4 models were equipped with a PVH lockout system for the front axles. This system proved to be rather unreliable and was changed to a live axle setup in mid-2000.

The 2.5-liter engine was replaced by a new DOHC 2.3-liter [[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 23|Duratec]] inline-four in mid-2001. 2001 also saw the pushrod 4.0-liter V6 replaced by the SOHC version from the [[Ford Explorer|Explorer]], bringing with it a more durable ''[[Mazda M5OD transmission|M5OD-R1HD]]'' manual transmission. Also in 2001, the five-speed automatic transmission that was introduced in 1997 for the 4.0-liter V6, was now also available with the 2.3- and 3.0-liter units. The Ranger received a facelift, including a new grille, hood, and front bumper, as well as updated headlights and taillights. SLP produced a version of the Ranger, called "Thunderbolt". This model included different options, such as a unique front and rear bumper, air intake, exhaust and even a spoiler.

In 2004, the Ranger received minor updates to the grille, hood, and front bumper. New front bucket seats were also added in 2004 to meet the new U.S. Federal safety requirements. It retained the dashboard lines of the previous years trucks with an instrument cluster change. In 2006, the Ranger received more minor updates to the grille, front side markers and taillights, along with a bigger rear Ford logo that was now centered in the tailgate. It also received new larger mirrors similar to those found on other Ford trucks and SUVs.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The latest Ranger offered a {{convert|143|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.3-liter inline-four and a {{convert|207|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.0-liter [[V6]]. The 3.0-liter Vulcan V6 was discontinued as of the 2009 model year. Ford uses code "R10" through "R19" in the fifth, sixth, and seventh VIN positions for all Rangers; R10, R14, and R18 are all rear-wheel drive; regular cab, two-door SuperCab, and four-door SuperCab respectively. R11, R15, and R19 are four-wheel drive; regular cab, two-door SuperCab, four-door SuperCab respectively.

In December 2009, Ford announced that specially designed custom graphics would be applied to the Ranger, beginning with the 2010 models. The feature was exclusive to Ford Dealers and allowed customers to pick a design that they wanted customized for their Ranger trims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/12/19/fancy-a-camouflage-f-150-graphics-for-entire-ford-lineup-coming/ "Fancy a camouflage F-150? Graphics for entire Ford lineup coming soon" from Autoblog.com (December 18, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2011 and 2012 model year, the level trims were adjusted. The XL trim has the standard level, followed by the XLT and Sport trims. The latter two included [[Sirius XM Radio|Sirius]] radio as an optional feature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=2123&amp;item_id=5790&amp;press_section_id=2870 2011 Ford Ranger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007092408/http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=2123&amp;item_id=5790&amp;press_section_id=2870 |date=October 7, 2012 }} from media.ford.com (July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ford Ranger was the first small pickup to introduce dual airbags as safety features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/16/business/air-bags-in-ford-trucks.html |title=Air Bags in Ford Trucks |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 16, 1994 |accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received an "acceptable" frontal crash test rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety when they were first tested in 1998, while many of its competitors received "marginal" or "poor" ratings at that time. The exception was the [[Toyota Tacoma]], which also got an "acceptable" rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=97 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Ford Ranger regular cab |publisher=Iihs.org |date=November 18, 2009 |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/earliermodels.aspx?class=75 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Small pickups – Earlier Models |publisher=Iihs.org |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 model year brought the addition of front seat combination head and torso airbags to improve passenger safety in a side-impact collision and earned "good" rating through the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s side impact test. Also, [[electronic stability control]] was added for the 2010 models as standard equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=1236 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Ford Ranger extended cab |publisher=Iihs.org |date=February 4, 2010 |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Roof Strength Test conducted by [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]], the Ford Ranger earned an ''Acceptable'' rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/roof/detailsbyclass.aspx?75 |title=Roof strength evaluations: Small pickups |publisher=Iihs.org |accessdate=March 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407200204/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/roof/detailsbyclass.aspx?75 |archivedate=April 7, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;FX4 Level II
The FX4 Level II version comes with a special 31-spline {{convert|8.8|in|mm|1|adj=on}} [[Ford 8.8 axle|Ford 8.8 rear axle]] equipped with a [[Torsen|Zexel-Torsen]] [[limited-slip differential]], three [[skid plate]]s, upgraded tow hooks, 31" [[BFGoodrich]] [[All-terrain tyre|All Terrains]], 15-inch [[Forging|forged]] [[Alcoa]] wheels, and Bilstein [[Shock absorber|shocks]]. Inside, the Level II package added two-tone cloth seats, optional leather and rubber floors along with a six-CD MP3 headunit as standard options. The FX4 level II package was first available in 2003, though, in 2002 the very first "FX4" package, however, not the Level II, was available. The 2002 FX4 off-road package is identical to the 2003+ FX4 Level II package, since there wasn't a FX4 Level II package offered. The FX4 off-road package did differ from the FX4 Level II package after 2002. The 2002 FX4 off-road and 2003 FX4 Level II are often referred to be the "Holy Grail" of Rangers,{{By whom|date=July 2017}} since there were limited production of these trucks with both a manual transmission and manual 4x4. According to Ford, 17,971 Level IIs were built from 2002 through 2007 (including the 2002{{Clarify|date=July 2017}}), and 45,172 of the Off Roads were built from 2003 to 2009. The FX4 Off Road was available into 2009, but the Level II was stopped after 2007, though many Level II features could be ordered individually. In 2010 the Ranger discontinued the FX4 trim level for the U.S. market, but it remained available in the Canadian market.

In January 2018, one year after announcing the production return of the Ford Ranger to North America, Ford introduced the 2019 Ford Ranger at the 2018 [[North American International Auto Show#2018|North American International Auto Show]], marking the first Ford entry into the mid-size pickup truck segment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/ranger/2019/2019-ford-ranger-first-look-review/|title=2019 Ford Ranger First Look: Welcome Home|date=January 14, 2018|work=Motor Trend|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth-generation Ranger began production on October 29, 2018, and will go on sale by January 2019.&lt;ref name=2018production&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/10/22/ford-starts-making-ranger-week/1697681002/|title=Ford's product onslaught starts with Ranger return|last=Thibodeau|first=Ian|date=October 22, 2018|work=The Detroit News|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In place of commercial use, Ford seeks to market the Ranger to private buyers using the truck for recreation; creating a vehicle for those who seek a vehicle smaller than a full-size truck, along with F-Series owners seeking a vehicle with a smaller exterior footprint.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;      

=== Chassis ===
The 2019 Ford Ranger is derived from the Ford T6 global midsize truck architecture designed by [[Ford Australia|Ford of Australia]]. While already designed to accommodate [[Left hand drive|left-hand drive]] use, the T6 chassis underwent further modifications for use in North America.  To better accommodate American crash standards and increase its payload, the frame was revised to include fully boxed frame rails.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  All versions of the Ranger sold in North America have a 127-inch wheelbase, regardless of cab or drivetrain configuration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   

For North American production, the Ranger T6 is produced with a single powertrain.  Shared with the Ford Explorer and Ford Mustang, the Ranger is powered by a [[Ford EcoBoost engine#2.3 L|2.3L EcoBoost]] inline-4.  For the Ranger, the engine produces 270 hp and 310 lb-ft of torque (10 fewer horsepower than the Explorer).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/news/2018/10/09/a-few-looks-at-the-new-ford-ranger-photos.html|title=2019 Ford Ranger specs released - Orlando Business Journal|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bizjournals.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/news/seven-things-to-love-about-the-2019-ford-ranger/|title=Seven Things to Love About the 2019 Ford Ranger {{!}} Automobile Magazine|date=2018-01-17|work=Automobile Magazine|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The engine is paired to a 10-speed 10R80 automatic transmission; shared with the Mustang GT and F-150 with the EcoBoost V6 or V8 engine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

For 2019 production, no [[Ford Duratorq engine|Duratorq]] or [[EcoBlue]] diesel engines are announced for the North American version of the T6 Ranger nor are any alternative gasoline engines.

=== Body ===
[[File:NAIAS 2019 Ford Ranger XLT right front.jpg|left|thumb|2019 Ford Ranger XLT SuperCab FX4]]
The 2019 Ford Ranger will be sold in four-door SuperCab and four-door SuperCrew configurations (Ford has no plans to market a two-door Ranger in North America).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/auto/2019-ford-ranger/preview/|title=Ford's new 2019 Ranger to take on Toyota Tacoma, Chevy Colorado|work=Roadshow|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While externally similar to its global counterpart, the 2019 Ford Ranger features a number of exterior design changes.  Most visibly, the front fascia was redesigned with a frame-mounted steel bumper.  At the minor expense of frontal aerodynamics, the sturdier front bumper was designed to better comply with American crash standards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  To better market the vehicle towards private buyers in North America, the Ranger was given a distinct hood design and grilles related to trim level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Additional trim included color-contrasting fender molding and fender grilles (in line with the F-Series trucks).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The "RANGER"-embossed tailgate was modified; in the interest of aerodynamics, adding a spoiler (sharing the locking tailgate handle from the F-150).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The interior of the global Ranger was also revised slightly.  To comply with American safety mandates, a rearview safety camera is standard along with [[Collision avoidance system|automatic emergency braking]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Several sizes of interior touchscreens are offered, depending on trim packages ordered.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  To increase interior storage, waterproof storage compartments were added under the rear seats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As the global Ford Ranger was designed before the current [[Ford F-Series (thirteenth generation)|F-Series]], usage of aluminum in the body is minor, with only an aluminum hood and tailgate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Trim ===
The 2019 Ford Ranger shares the trim levels of the previous American Ford Ranger and the Ford F-Series: base XL, mid-level XLT, and top-trim Lariat.  To supplement each trim level, Chrome, Sport, and FX option packages are offered for all three trim levels.&lt;ref&gt;https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/01/14/an-american-favorite-reinvented--new-ford-ranger-brings-built-fo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ford in Macapá, Amapá, Brazil.jpg|thumb|2010–2012 Ford Ranger double cab (South America)]]

Starting in 1998, Ford began to phase out the Ford Courier name on its Mazda-produced compact pickups sold globally in favor of the Ranger nameplate (though the Courier remained in use in Australia). Consequently, exports of the North American-produced Ranger were primarily limited to South America, including Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.&lt;ref name="American Ford Ranger" /&gt;

In 1995 Ford began exports of the Ranger from the United States to [[Argentina]]; initial exports started with two-door SuperCab equipped with the 4.0-liter gasoline ''[[Ford Cologne V6 engine|Cologne]]'' V6. As demand increased, Ford made the decision to produce it locally in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina at the [[Ford Motor Company of Argentina|Ford General Pacheco Assembly Plant]] for the local market, [[Canada]] and subsequently for the rest of Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordperu.com/html/ford_ranger_peru.html Ford Ranger Latin America] (in Spanish) – Accessed March 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Rangers produced at General Pacheco were built in 1996 with a single cab, gasoline engine version. By November 1997, supply was increased with both diesel and gasoline engines, [[two-wheel drive|two-wheel]] and [[four-wheel drive]] and different levels of equipment.

After two years of local production in Argentina, in 1998, Ford of Argentina introduced a redesigned version of the Ford Ranger. Featuring the same updates as its counterpart in the United States, a new four-door [[crew cab|double cab]] body variant exclusive to South America made its debut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blogdecoches.com.ar/ford-f-100-la-pick-up-mas-vendida-en-la-historia-argentina/ Ford Pick up history in Argentina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706080721/http://www.blogdecoches.com.ar/ford-f-100-la-pick-up-mas-vendida-en-la-historia-argentina/ |date=July 6, 2011 }} (in Spanish) – Accessed March 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; As Ford was developing the functionally similar Ford Explorer Sport Trac at the time, the double-cab Ford Ranger was not produced or marketed in the United States or Canada.

To better match the needs of local buyers, Ford of Argentina offered three different turbodiesel powertrain options, including a 2.5-liter [[List of Ford engines#4 cylinder|turbocharged four-cylinder]] [[diesel engine|diesel]] with 115 hp (85 kW) starting in 1998, a 2.8-liter with 135 hp (99 kW) starting in 2002 and a 3.0-liter with {{convert|163|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|280|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque mated to an [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]] ''FSO-2405-A'' five-speed manual transmission starting in 2004.

The 2001 exterior facelift given to North American Rangers was not carried over to South American versions, with the 1998 front bodywork remaining until the 2003 model year. For 2004, both versions were given the same grille (though Argentine-produced versions were designed with projector-style headlamps).

Following a US$156.5 million upgrade to the General Pacheco factory in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.automotiveworld.com/WAM/content.asp?contentid=62775 Ford to invest US$156.5m in Pacheco facility]- Accessed March 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; several upgrades were made to the South American Ranger; a number of them would diverge the model from its US counterpart. For 2008, the Ranger received a makeover with a grill and headlights similar to the 2006 North American version; bed extenders became available for all boxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mundoautomotor.com.ar/web/2007/11/30/ford-ranger-2008/Ford Ranger 2008] (in Spanish) – Accessed March 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2010, the Ranger was given its largest facelift since 1992. To allow for a more aggressive stance, the hood, front fenders, and front bumper were replaced with a more aggressive and rounded design, including large wheel arches; on the doors, the handles were replaced by a pull-out design. For the first time, the Ranger wore the Ford corporate three-bar grille. Inside, the interior design introduced in 2008 remained, with both previous engine configurations.&lt;ref name="presentó la nueva Ford Ranger 2010"&gt;[http://www.iprofesional.com/notas/85309-Llega-a-la-Argentina-la-nueva-Ford-Ranger-2010.htmlFord presentó la nueva Ford Ranger 2010] (in Spanish) – Accessed March 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://espaciocoches.com/2009/06/ford-ranger-2010-mercosur-primeras-imgenes-y-datos.html Ford Ranger 2010 (Mercosur), primeras imágenes y datos](in Spanish) – Accessed March 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A new option (for Argentina and Brazil) included an engine powered by [[compressed natural gas]], making it the first pickup truck to offer a factory-built [[natural gas vehicle]] (NGV) commercially available in those countries.&lt;ref name="presentó la nueva Ford Ranger 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://espaciocoches.com/2009/06/ford-ranger-2010-mercosur-primeras-imgenes-y-datos.html Ford Ranger 2010 (Mercosur), primeras imágenes y datos] (in Spanish) – Accessed March 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Ford of Argentina replaced the US-derived Ranger with the larger [[Ford Ranger (T6)|Ranger T6]]. Designed by Ford of Australia, the Ranger T6 consolidated the Ford- and Mazda-based versions of the Ranger onto a single platform sold globally outside the United States and Canada.

== Discontinuation and revival ==

=== Discontinuation ===
In the summer of 2005, alongside the update for the 2006 model-year U.S. Ranger, the first information emerged about its intended replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecarconnection.com/Shoppers/Future_Cars/Ford.S283.A8367.html|title=Future Cars: Ford/PAG/Mazda|last=|first=|date=March 30, 2005|work=The CarConnection.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050702014612/http://www.thecarconnection.com/Shoppers/Future_Cars/Ford.S283.A8367.html|archive-date=July 2, 2005|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Designed under the P273 codename as a 2010 model-year vehicle, the new Ranger was designed as a global vehicle, intended to replace three versions of the Ranger: the related North American and Latin American versions, along with the rebadged version designed by Mazda sold through much of the rest of the world.  In 2007, the Thai market received a Ranger based on the 4Trac concept vehicle.  Designed by Ford Australia, the Ford Ranger T6 began production in 2011 in [[AutoAlliance Thailand|AutoAlliance]] in [[Rayong|Rayong, Thailand]].  While the Ranger T6 was initially released as a global vehicle, it was not sold in the United States or Canada, leaving the compact Ranger without a successor.  

In 2008, Ford made its first plans to end production of the Ranger in North America; although its high productivity spared it from [[The Way Forward]], Twin Cities Assembly (built in 1925) was the oldest Ford factory worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/for-st-paul-ford-plant-end-of-line-is-dec-19/132015583/|title=For St. Paul Ford plant, end of line is Dec. 19|work=Star Tribune|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ford later extended the closure date of the factory to 2011, but in June 2011, a final closure date was announced.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/business/132015583.html/|title=Report: For St. Paul Ford plant, end of line is Dec. 19|last=|first=|date=June 22, 2011|website=|publisher=Autoblog|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624175529/http://www.autoblog.com/2011/06/22/u-s-ford-ranger-production-ending-this-december/|archivedate=June 24, 2011|deadurl=|accessdate=June 23, 2011|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Twin Cities was the sole production location of the Ranger in North America (from 1982), its closure brought the production of the Ranger to an end after 29 model years.  The 2011 model year was the final model year for retail sales, with a shortened 2012 model year for fleet sales; the final North American-market Ranger (a white SuperCab Sport produced for pest-control company [[Orkin]]) was produced on December 16, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_19564573|title=St. Paul Ford plant sees final truck off the line|last=Williams|first=Chris|date=December 6, 2011|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63z8ZyYEn?url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_19564573|archivedate=December 16, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

While the global [[Ford Ranger (T6)|Ranger T6]] underwent development in the late 2000s, it was ultimately rejected for the North American market for several reasons.  Although compact pickup trucks had grown in size in the 2000s (notably the [[Nissan Frontier]] and [[Toyota Tacoma]]) in the early 2000s (in comparison to the Ranger and Chevrolet S10), the global Ranger was seen as dimensionally a mid-size truck.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/09/20/u-s-spec-ford-ranger-to-officially-end-production-in-2011-ford|title=U.S.-spec Ford Ranger to officially end production in 2011, Ford explains why|author=Bowman, Zach|date=September 20, 2010|work=Autoblog|accessdate=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While potentially offering Ford a competitor to the [[Dodge Dakota]] for the first time, Ford also felt a mid-size truck of its own would threaten sales of the [[Ford F-Series (twelfth generation)|Ford F-150]], the best-selling vehicle in the United States.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Another factor in its decision was the overall decline of the compact truck segment, from 8% of total market sales in 1994 to 2% in 2010.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  

According to its market research, toward the end of its production, Ford discovered that most Ford Ranger buyers were not buying the Ranger as a truck, but for its low price as a new vehicle.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Along with its plans to increase F-Series fuel economy, Ford sought to retain Ranger buyers with the [[Ford Fiesta]] and [[Ford Transit Connect]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  

=== Revival ===
In 2015, as part of contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers, leaked reports over the future of the [[Michigan Assembly Plant]] included the potential decision of replacing [[Ford Focus]] and [[Ford C-Max]] production with an American-market version of the global Ford Ranger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2015/08/25/ford-ranger/32373741/ "Ford plans to build Ranger at Michigan Assembly"] from [[Detroit News]] (August 25, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with the revival of the Ranger nameplate, the UAW negotiations also included a potential revival of the Ford Bronco SUV.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-26/ford-said-to-weigh-returning-bronco-ranger-production-to-u-s- "Ford Said to Weigh Return of Bronco, Ranger Output to U.S."] from Bloomberg News (August 26, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  

At the [[North American International Auto Show#2017|2017 North American International Auto Show]], Ford confirmed the return of the Ford Ranger and Ford Bronco, with the Ford Ranger as a 2019 model-year vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fordauthority.com/2017/01/ford-ranger-bronco-returning-to-north-america-ford-confirms/|title=Ford Ranger, Bronco Returning To North America, Ford Confirms|date=January 9, 2017|work=Aaron Brzozowski|publisher=Ford Authority|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The production 2019 Ford Ranger was unveiled one year later, at the [[North American International Auto Show#2018|2018 North American International Auto Show]].

The new 2019 Ford Ranger has a single powertrain package under its twin-power-dome hood: Ford's 2.3-litre EcoBoost four-cylinder engine, mated a 10-speed automatic transmission – an exclusive in the segment. The engine features direct fuel injection, a twin-scroll turbocharger and four valves per cylinder, for enhanced efficiency and capability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://autofile.ca/en-ca/car-reviews/first-look-ford-resurrects-the-ranger "FIRST LOOK: Ford resurrects the Ranger"] from AutoFile.ca (January 13, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants ==

=== Pickup trucks ===

==== Ford Ranger EV (1998-2002) ====
[[File:GSFRChargeDoorQuarter.jpg|thumb|Ford Ranger EV]]
The first [[battery electric vehicle]] produced by Ford in North America, the [[Ford Ranger EV]] was produced from 1998 to 2002.  Originally fitted with [[lead-acid batteries]], [[Nickel metal hydride battery|Nickel metal hydride (NiMH)]] batteries were introduced for 1999.  While using the frame of a 4x4 Ranger, the Ranger EV was rear-wheel drive with a rear-mounted driveline.  It is also the only rear-wheel drive American-produced Ford fitted with a [[de Dion tube|de Dion]] rear suspension.  Externally, the Ranger EV is primarly distinguished from a standard Ranger by its grille; the Ranger EV has a grille-mounted charging port on the right third of its grille.   

During its production, 1,500 Ranger EVs were produced; as with most electric vehicles of the 1990s, it was offered exclusively through lease.  While most fleet-leased Ranger EVs were returned to Ford after the end of the lease and dismantled, some Ranger EVs leased by indivduals were purchased and remain in use.  

==== Ford Explorer Sport Trac (2000-2005) ====
[[File:1st Ford Explorer Sport Trac -- 03-21-2012.JPG|thumb|Ford Explorer Sport Trac (2000-2005)]]
For the 2000 model year, Ford introduced the [[Ford Explorer Sport Trac]] as its first crew-cab compact pickup in North America.  While crew-cab Ford Rangers were sold in South America (and through rebadging, other markets worldwide), the Explorer Sport Trac was developed as a personal-use vehicle rather than a utility vehicle.  In its design, the Sport Trac was a combination of several vehicles:  the Ranger SuperCab chassis, Explorer Sport front fascia, a cab formed from the five-door Explorer, and an all-new composite pickup bed (sharing the tailgate with the F-150).  

Two generations of the Sport Trac were produced.  From 2000 to 2005, the Sport Trac was based on the 1991-2001 Explorer, powered solely by the 4.0L V6.  For 2006, the Sport Trac adopted the chassis of the fourth-generation Explorer (introducing a 4.6L V8 option), ending the production of the Ranger-based Explorer.  

After 2010, the Sport Trac was discontinued without a successor as part of "The Way Forward"; the 2019 Ranger SuperCrew is sized similar in width and wheelbase to the Sport Trac.

==== Mazda B-Series/Mazda Truck (1994-2010) ====
For 1994, [[Mazda North American Operations|Mazda North America]] ended imports of the B-series from Japan, entering into an agreement with Ford to market a rebadged version of the Ranger as the B-series in the United States and Canada.  For Mazda, whose 1986-1993 B-series had struggled in North America, the new B-series was a variant of one of the highest-selling compact trucks.  In addition, selling a truck produced in the United States allowed Mazda to entirely circumvent the 25% "chicken tax".   

While Mazda continued sales of the previous-generation B-series for global markets, for the United States and Canada, the B-series adapted the body configurations and powertrains as the Ranger; two-wheel drive and 4x4 versions were offered.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  As with previous generations, badging was related to engine displacement; versions with the 2.3L inline-four were the B2300, the 3.0L V6 as the B3000, and the 4.0L V6 as the B4000.  

To distinguish Ford and Mazda trucks from one another, stylists gave the B-series its own front fascia and pickup truck bed; the extended cab (Cab Plus) was styled with blacked-out and chrome window trim.  At its launch, Mazda sold the B-series in two trim lines, SE and LE (equivalent to Ranger XL and XLT, respectively).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  For 1997, the trim levels were revised, as the LE was dropped in favor of SE-5 and SE-5+; for 1998, SX became the base trim, with SE becoming the highest trim.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  For 2002, the B-series was renamed '''Mazda Truck''', though all fender badging denoting engine size remained.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  

During its production, the B-series/Truck largely followed the development of the Ranger in its body and chassis.  For 1997, Mazda dropped the B3000 (separately from Ford); the model returned for 1998.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  For 1998, the B-series underwent the same body and chassis redesign as the Ranger, with a new front fascia, redesigned pickup bed (with vestigial fenders), and a larger-displacement standard engine (creating the B2500).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  During 1998, rear-hinged doors were added to Cab Plus models, a first in the pickup truck segment (alongside SuperCabs of the Ford Ranger and F-Series).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  For 2001, the B2300 returned (with a Ford Duratec DOHC engine) and the B4000 received a SOHC 4.0L V6 engine.  

As the B-series became the Mazda Truck for 2002, it underwent its final exterior update, introducing a centered Mazda badge to the grille.  After 2007, the B3000 was discontinued (as production of the 3.0L Vulcan V6 ended within a year).  As Mazda North America began to shift away from pickup truck sales, the Mazda Truck was withdrawn from the United States after the 2009 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thecarconnection.com/marty-blog/1035480_b-series-b-seeing-you-mazda-leaves-u-s-pickup-market|title=B-Series, B-Seeing You: Mazda Leaves U.S. Pickup Market|author=Bengt Halvorson|date=September 21, 2009|publisher=The Car Connection|accessdate=October 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sold in Canada for 2010, the final Mazda Truck rolled off the Twin Cities Assembly Plant assembly line on December 11, 2009.  &lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

=== Other vehicles ===
[[File:Winnersh, UK (3761759037).jpg|thumb|Ford Aerostar (UK export)]]

==== Ford Aerostar ====
For the 1986 model year, the [[Ford Aerostar]] was launched as the first minivan from Ford Motor Company.  While built using a separate chassis architecture, the Aerostar sourced mechanical components from the Ranger, Bronco II, and Explorer, including engines and transmissions.  Other minor interior components were also shared between the Ranger and Aerostar (and other Ford vehicles).         

The Aerostar was sold through the 1997 model year, replaced by the front-wheel drive [[Ford Windstar]] and [[Mercury Villager]] (the former deriving components from the [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|Ford Taurus]]).      

==== Ford Bronco II ====
For the 1978 model year, the Ford Bronco transitioned in size from a compact SUV to a full-size SUV derived from the Ford F-100.  To re-enter the segment vacated by the Bronco, Ford developed a compact SUV alongside the Ranger.&lt;ref name="Mini-Truck" /&gt;  Introduced for the 1984 model year, the [[Ford Bronco II]] was slightly longer and wider than the first-generation Bronco, using a shortened 4x4 Ranger chassis.  

In sharp contrast to the spartan original, the Bronco II offered all of the convenience features available on the Ranger.  Unlike its larger namesake, the Bronco II was not designed with a removable roof, including large side windows which extended into the rear roofline.  From the B-pillars forward, the Bronco II shared its interior with the Ranger (with the exception of badging).  For 1989, the Bronco II shared the front fascia and interior of the facelifted Ranger.    

As part of a redesign, the Bronco II was enlarged for the 1991 model year, becoming the Ford Explorer Sport (alongside the four-door Ford Explorer).    &lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;
File:Ford Bronco II (2370203134).jpg|1984-1988 Ford Bronco II
File:'89-'90 Ford Bronco II.JPG|1989-1990 Ford Bronco II
&lt;/gallery&gt;    

==== Ford Explorer/Mazda Navajo/Mercury Mountaineer ====
For the 1991 model year, Ford redesigned the Bronco II, renaming it the [[Ford Explorer]].  To increase its utility as a family vehicle, the Explorer was introduced as a five-door SUV.  Again based on the Ranger chassis, both versions of the Explorer shared interior components with the Ranger and front bodywork forward of the windshield (though visible parts commonality was reduced over the Bronco II).  In 1995, as part of a body revision, the Ranger bodywork was removed from the Explorer; the model line also became the first Ford truck to end the use of Twin I-Beam front suspension.

To functionally replace the Bronco II, Ford created a three-door version of the Explorer.  To address the stability problems of the Bronco II, Ford lengthened the wheelbase of the three-door Explorer by 8 inches and it was nearly a foot longer in length over its predecessor.   In contrast to the glass-panel roofline of the Bronco II, the three-door Explorer wore a similar roofline to the five-door, with a raked "C-pillar" as an identifying feature.  For 1998, the three-door adopted the Explorer Sport name (the most commonly produced trim level for three-doors).  For 2001, to distinguish the three-door from the five-door, the Explorer Sport was styled with the same front fascia as the Sport Trac pickup truck.  As demand for three-door SUVs declined (in comparison to five-door SUVs), the Explorer Sport was discontinued after the 2003 model year.      

From 1991 to 1994, Mazda marketed the three-door Explorer as the [[Mazda Navajo]]. Equipped similar to the Explorer Sport and Explorer XLT three-door, the Navajo differed largely in exterior trim and wheels, with the interior differing only in the instrument panel lettering. Due to the slow sales of three-door SUVs, the Mazda Navajo was discontinued during the 1994 model year.  With the exception of steering-wheel badging, the Navajo used the same dashboard as the 1989-1994 Ranger.  

From 1997 to 2010, Mercury marketed the five-door Explorer as the [[Mercury Mountaineer]].  As part of the development of the 2002 third-generation Ford Explorer, Ford developed a dedicated mid-size SUV chassis for the Explorer and Mountaineer, ending their use of the Ranger chassis after the 2001 model year.&lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

[[Image:Green wood visual comparison.jpg|thumb|right|Green on left, seasoned on right]]
'''Green wood''' is [[wood]] that has been recently cut and therefore has not had an opportunity to [[wood drying|season]] (dry) by [[evaporation]] of the internal [[moisture]]. Green wood contains more moisture than seasoned wood, which has been dried through passage of time or by forced drying in [[kilns]]. Green wood is considered to have 100% [[water content|moisture content]] relative to air-dried or seasoned wood which is considered to be 20%. [[Energy density]] charts for [[wood fuel]]s tend to use air-dried wood as their reference, thus oven-dried or 0% moisture content can reflect 103.4% energy content.

==Combustion==
When green wood is used as fuel in appliances
, it releases less [[heat]] per unit of measure (usually cords&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/XL/438/438-3.htm Info at gencourt.state.nh.us]&lt;/ref&gt; or tons) because of the heat consumed to evaporate the moisture.&lt;ref&gt;NH Forest Market Report 1988, page 22&lt;/ref&gt; The lower [[temperature]]s that result can lead to more [[creosote#Build-up in chimneys|creosote]] being created which is later deposited in exhaust [[flue]]s. These deposits can later be [[combustion|ignited]] when sufficient heat and [[oxygen]] are present to cause a [[chimney fire]] which can be destructive and dangerous.

==Green lumber==
'''Green lumber''' presents its own characteristics as well. Some species of wood are better assembled green because wood splits less when [[nail (fastener)|nailed]] green. Other species shrink excessively, leaving voids between the individual pieces when allowed to dry. Often wood to be used for fine products such as [[furniture]] is kiln-dried to stabilize it and minimize the shrinkage of the finished product.

{{About|ion propelled aircraft|ion propelled spacecraft|Ion thruster}}

An '''ionocraft''' or '''ion-propelled aircraft''' (commonly known as a '''lifter''' or '''hexalifter''') is an [[aircraft]] that uses an electrical [[electrohydrodynamic]] (EHD) phenomenon to produce [[thrust]] in the air without requiring any [[combustion]] or [[moving parts]]. Current designs do not yet produce enough thrust for manned flight or heavy loads. 

The term "ionocraft" dates back to the 1960s, an era in which EHD experiments were at their peak. In its basic form, it consists of two [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] [[electrical conduction|conductive]] [[electrodes]], one in the form of a fine wire and another which may be formed out of wire grid, tubes or foil skirts with a smooth round surface. When such an arrangement is powered by high [[voltage]] (in the range of a few kilovolts), it [[Ionization|ionizes]] nitrogen molecules in the air and accelerates them from one electrode to the other; these ions collide with neutral air molecules and accelerate them, producing [[thrust]]. The ionocraft forms part of the [[EHD thruster]]&lt;!-- Just to aid comprehension for people thrown by this self-redirect: apparently that link originally pointed [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electrohydrodynamic_thruster&amp;oldid=464338641 here]. That was before the Deletionista showed up.--&gt; family, but is a special case in which the ionisation and accelerating stages are combined into a single stage.

Ionocrafts have been popular among [[anti-gravity]] or so-called "[[electrogravitics]]" proponents, due to the research of [[Thomas Townsend Brown]], who built these devices in the 1920s and incorrectly believed that he had found a way to modify gravity using electric fields.

The term "lifter" is an accurate description because it is not an anti-gravity device; rather, it produces lift using the same basic principle as a rocket, i.e. from the equal but opposite force upward generated by the driving force downward, specifically by driving the ionized air downward in the case of the ionocraft. Much like a rocket or a jet engine (it can actually be much more thrust efficient than a jet engine&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/04/130403122013.htm Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2013, April 3). Ionic thrusters generate efficient propulsion in air. ScienceDaily] Quote: "...In their experiments, they found that ionic wind produces 110 newtons of thrust per kilowatt, compared with a jet engine's 2 newtons per kilowatt..."&lt;/ref&gt;), the force that an ionocraft generates is consistently oriented along its own axis, regardless of the surrounding gravitational field. Claims of the device also working in a vacuum have been disproved.&lt;ref name="Brian Dunbar"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ion Propulsion|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20040171929_2004178266.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ionocraft require many safety precautions due to the high voltage required for their operation; nevertheless, a large subculture has grown up around this simple EHD thrusting device and its physics are now known to a much better extent. 

In 5 February 2002 Neil McPherson, USA, built the first electroaerodynamic propulsion plane (tethered to a power supply).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jnaudin.free.fr:80/html/bbracer.htm|title=The Biefeld-Brown Racer and the Lifter1 by Neil McPherson (USA)|last=|first=|date=5 February 2002|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213084407/http://jnaudin.free.fr/html/bbracer.htm|archive-date=2015-12-13|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2018 the first ion-propelled glider plane carrying its own batteries was flown over a distance of 60 meters by a team of scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It had a 5 meter wingspan and weighed 2.45 kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/21/first-ever-plane-with-no-moving-parts-takes-flight|title=First ever plane with no moving parts takes flight|last=Hern|first=Alex|date=2018-11-21|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
An ionocraft is a propulsion device based on [[ion (physics)|ionic]] [[air propulsion]] that works without moving parts, uses only [[electrical energy]], and is able to lift its own weight, not including its own [[power supply]]. The principle of [[ionic wind]] propulsion with [[corona discharge|corona]]-generated charged particles has been known from the earliest days of the discovery of electricity with references dating back to 1709 in a book titled ''Physico-Mechanical Experiments on Various Subjects'' by [[Francis Hauksbee]]. Its use for propulsion was given serious thought by Major [[Alexander Prokofieff de Seversky]] who contributed much to its basic physics and construction variations in 1960. In fact, it was Major de Seversky himself who in 1964 coined{{primary source inline|date=May 2014}} the term Ionocraft in his ({{US patent|3130945}}). There are also designs by the American experimenter Thomas Townsend Brown, such as his 1960 patents for "Elektrokinetic Apparatus". Brown spent most of his life trying to develop what he thought was an [[anti-gravity]] effect, which he named the [[Biefeld–Brown effect]]. Since Brown's devices produce thrust along their axis regardless of the direction of gravity and do not work in a vacuum, the effect he identified has been attributed to electrohydrodynamics instead of anti-gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Construction==
[[Image:Typicalionocraft.gif|thumb|Typical ionocraft construction]]
A simple ionocraft derivative, also known as a lifter, can be easily constructed by anyone with a minimal amount of technical knowledge. The model in its simplest form has the shape of an [[equilateral triangle]] with sides generally between 10 and 30&amp;nbsp;cm. They consist of three parts, the ''corona wire'' (or emitting wire), the ''air gap'' (or dielectric fluid), and the ''foil skirt'' (collector). The electrical polarities of the emitting and collecting electrodes can be reversed. All of this is usually supported by a lightweight [[balsa]]wood or other electrically isolating frame so that the corona wire is supported at a fixed distance above the foil skirt, generally at 1&amp;nbsp;mm per kilo-volt. The corona wire and foil should be as close as possible to achieve a saturated corona current condition which results in the highest production of thrust. However the corona wire should not be too close to the foil skirt as it will tend to [[spark gap|arc]] in a spectacular show of tiny [[lightning discharge|lightning bolts]] which has a twofold effect:
# It degrades the thrust as it is [[Short circuit|shorting]] the device and there is [[Current (electricity)|current]] flow through the arc instead of the [[ion (physics)|ions]] that do the lifting
# It can destroy the [[power supply]] or burn the balsa structure of the lifter.

===Components===

====Corona wire====
The corona wire is usually, but not necessarily, connected to the positive terminal of the high voltage power supply. In general, it is made from a small gauge bare [[conductive]] [[wire]]. While [[copper]] wire can be used, it does not work quite as well as [[stainless steel]]. Similarly, thinner wire such as 50 [[American Wire Gauge|gauge]] tends to work well compared to more common, larger sizes such as 30 gauge, as the stronger electric field around the smaller diameter wire results in better ionisation and a larger corona current.
44 gauge stainless steel wire is also known to work very well and has been used with great success by hobbyists.
Due to anomalies in construction adding supports made from 3D printed staggered mesh (to prevent surface arc-over) from SLS in resin can work if atmospheric humidity is low enough.

The corona wire is so called because of its tendency to emit a purple [[corona discharge|corona]]-like glow while in use. This is simply a side effect of ionization. Excessive corona is to be avoided, as too much means the electrodes are dangerously close and may arc at any moment, not to mention the associated health hazards due to excess inhalation of [[ozone]] and [[NOx]] produced by the corona.

====Air gap====
The air gap is simply that, a gap of free flowing [[air]] between the two electrodes that make up the structure of an ionocraft.

The air gap is a vital necessity to the functioning of this device as it is the [[dielectric]] used during operation. Best results have been observed with an air gap of 1&amp;nbsp;mm to every kV.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

====Collector====
The collector may take various shapes, as long as it results in a smooth equipotential surface underneath the corona wire. Variations of this include a wire mesh, parallel conductive tubes, or a foil skirt with a smooth round edge. The foil skirt collector is the most popular for small models, and is usually, but not necessarily, connected to the negative side of the power supply. It is usually conveniently made from cheap, lightweight [[aluminum foil]].

The foil skirt is named simply because it is shaped much like a [[skirt]], and is made from aluminum foil. It is by far the most fragile part, and must not be crumpled to work properly. Any sharp edges on the skirt will degrade the performance of the thruster, as this will generate ions of opposite polarity to those within the thrust mechanism.

Reversing the polarities of the corona wire with that of the foil does not alter the direction of motion. Thrust will be produced regardless of whether the ions are positive or negative. For positive corona polarity, nitrogen ions are the main [[charge carrier]]s, whilst for negative polarity, oxygen ions will be the main carriers and ozone production will be higher. The slight difference in their ion mobility, results in slightly higher thrust for the positive corona polarity case.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Use of conductive aquadag paint (eg carbon) has been explored but invariably it deteriorates in use unless supplemented by conductive foil underneath. The problem appears to be sputtering and further research is underway to determine if this can be resolved.

==Mechanism==
The generated thrust can be explained in terms of [[electrokinetic phenomena|electrokinetics]] or, in modern terms, [[electrohydrodynamics]] propulsion and can be derived through a modified use of the Child-Langmuir equation.&lt;ref name="Leon Tribe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrokinetic devices in air|url=http://rimstar.org/sdprop/lifter/ltcalcs/Electrokinetic_devices_in_air.pdf|accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A generalized one-dimensional treatment gives the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{Id}{k} &lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''F'' is the resulting force, measured in [[dimensional analysis| dimensional units]] [[mass|M]]&amp;nbsp;[[length|L]]&amp;nbsp;[[time|T]]&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. (In [[International System of Units|SI]] units, this is measured in [[Newton (unit)|Newton]]s.)
* ''I'' is the current flow of electric current, measured in dimension [[electric current|I]]. ([[Ampere|Amperes]] in SI units.)
* ''d'' is the air gap distance, measured in dimension L ([[metre|meters]] in SI units)
* ''k'' is the ion mobility coefficient of air,&lt;ref&gt;H Tammett, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1029/97JD01429/asset/jgrd5470.pdf "Reduction of Air Ion Mobility to Standard Conditions"], ''J. Geophys Res., Vol 103,'', D 12, pp. 13933-13939, June 27, 1988 (Accessed 1 March 2018). &lt;/ref&gt; measured in dimension M&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;I (amp-sec&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/kg in SI units). (Nominal value for air is 2·10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;V&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In its basic form, the ionocraft is able to produce forces great enough to lift about a gram of payload per [[watt]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benreuven.com/lifter-efficency Lifter efficiency relation to ion velocity] "J L Naudin’s Lifter-3 pulsed HV 1.13g/Watt" {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808044901/http://www.benreuven.com/lifter-efficency |date=2014-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so its use is restricted to a tethered model. Ionocraft capable of payloads in the order of a few grams usually need to be powered by power sources and high voltage converters weighing a few kilograms, so although its simplistic design makes it an excellent way to experiment with this technology, it is unlikely that a fully autonomous ionocraft will be made with the present construction methods. Further study in electrohydrodynamics, however, show that different classes and construction methods of [[EHD thrusters]] and hybrid technology (mixture with [[aerostat|lighter-than-air]] techniques), can achieve much higher payload or thrust-to-power ratios than those achieved with the simple lifter design. Practical limits can be worked out using well defined theory and calculations.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blazelabs.com/ionocraftdesign.pdf Full analysis &amp; design solutions for EHD Thrusters at saturated corona current conditions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Granados|first=Victor H.|author2=Pinheiro, Mario J.|author3=Sa, Paulo A.|title=Electrostatic propulsion device for aerodynamics applications|journal=Physics of Plasmas|date=July 2016|url=http://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4958815|accessdate=27 April 2017|doi=10.1063/1.4958815|bibcode=2016PhPl...23g3514G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a fully autonomous EHD thruster is theoretically possible.

When the ionocraft is turned on, the corona wire becomes charged with [[high voltage]], usually between 20 and 50 [[kilovolt|kV]]. The user must be extremely careful not to touch the device at this point, as it can give a nasty shock. At extremely high current, well over the amount usually used for a small model, contact could be fatal. When the corona wire is at approximately 30 kV, it causes the air molecules nearby to become [[ion]]ised by stripping the [[electrons]] away from them. As this happens, the ions are strongly repelled away from the anode but are also strongly attracted towards the collector, causing the majority of the ions to begin accelerating in the direction of the collector. These ions travel at a constant average velocity termed the [[drift velocity]]. Such velocity depends on the [[mean free path]] between collisions, the external electric field, and on the mass of ions and neutral air molecules.

The fact that the current is carried by a [[corona discharge]] (and not a tightly-confined [[electric arc|arc]]) means that the moving particles are diffusely spread out into an expanding ion cloud, and collide frequently with neutral air molecules. It is these collisions that create a net movement. The momentum of the ion cloud is partially imparted onto the neutral air molecules that it collides with, which, being neutral, do not eventually migrate back to the second electrode. Instead they continue to travel in the same direction, creating a neutral wind. As these neutral molecules are ejected from the ionocraft, there are, in agreement with [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's third law|Newton's Third Law of Motion]], equal and opposite forces, so the ionocraft moves in the opposite direction with an equal force. There are hundreds of thousands of molecules per second ejected from the device, so the force exerted is comparable to a gentle breeze. Still, this is enough to make a light balsa model lift its own weight. The resulting thrust also depends on other external factors including air pressure and temperature, gas composition, voltage, humidity, and air gap distance.

The air gap is very important for the function of this device. Between the [[electrode]]s there is a mass of air, consisting of neutral air molecules, which gets in the way of the moving ions. This air mass is impacted repeatedly by excited particles moving at high [[drift velocity]]. This creates resistance, which must be overcome. The barrage of ions will eventually either push the whole mass of air out of the way, or break through to the collector where electrons will be reattached, making it neutral again. The end result of the neutral air caught in the process is to effectively cause an exchange in momentum and thus generate thrust. The heavier and denser the gas, the higher the resulting thrust.

Recent research suggests electrohydrodynamic propulsion is more energy efficient ([[thrust]] per unit [[power (physics)|power]]) than other means of propulsion, generating up to 100N of thrust per kilowatt of power, compared to 2 N/kW for jet engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barrett|first=Steven R.H.|author2=Masuyama, Kento|title=On the performance of electrohydrodynamic propulsion|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society|date=5 March 2013|url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/469/2154/20120623.abstract?sid=9494059d-0ba7-4d99-b219-73ca7fe837be|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is mainly due to the much lower air speed of an ionocraft vs a jet engine, as power requirement per unit mass of payload drops with air velocity. However this also means the ionocraft needs a much wider surface area to lift the same payload.

A variant may enable for the first time a self-contained unit that uses a working gas; this is the subject of a patent application but is believed to be similar to ESA's air-breathing ion engine with the notable exception of size.
In this case a specific combination of electrodes with very low work function enables radically higher efficiency and as such can be recharged easily with a simple arrangement of gas canisters.

A '''landau''' is a [[coachbuilding]] term for a type of four-wheeled, convertible [[carriage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metaglossary.com/meanings/366766 MetaGlossary.com: Landau] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607165758/http://www.metaglossary.com/meanings/366766/ |date=2008-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a city carriage of luxury type. The low shell of the landau made for maximum visibility of the occupants and their clothing, a feature that makes a landau still a popular choice for the [[Lord Mayor|Lords Mayor]]s of certain cities in the United Kingdom on ceremonial occasions.

==History of landau carriages==
[[File:Jean-Gabriel Eynard (Swiss - Carriage with Figures - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|1849 [[daguerreotype]] of a landau carriage ready for a family outing.]]
A landau is lightweight and suspended on [[elliptical spring]]s. It was invented in the 18th century; ''landau'' in this sense is first noted in English in 1743.&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'', "landau".&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after the German city of [[Landau]] in the [[Palatinate region|Rhenish Palatinate]] where they were first produced. Lord, Hopkinson, coachmakers of [[Holborn]], London, produced the first English landaus in the 1830s.

==Description and development==
[[Image:Wien Stefansdom fiaker DSC02643.JPG|thumb|right|In Vienna, landaus are called ''[[Fiacre (carriage)|fiacre]]s'' because they can be rented to carry tourists around the old city.]]
[[File:Landau Carriage.JPG|thumb|right|A five-glass landau carriage in [[Geraz do Lima Carriage museum]] ]]
A landau, drawn by a pair or [[Four-in-hand (carriage)|four-in-hand]], is one of several kinds of [[Vis-à-vis (carriage)|vis-à-vis]], a social carriage with facing seats over a dropped footwell (''illustration''), which was perfected by the mid-19th century in the form of a swept base that flowed in a single curve. The soft folding top is divided into two sections, front and rear, latched at the center. These usually lie perfectly flat, but the back section can be let down or thrown back while the front section can be removed or left stationary. When fully opened, the top can completely cover the passengers, with some loss of the graceful line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotlandforvisitors.co.uk/horsecarriage.php The Horse-drawn Carriage Pictures] Images of Scotland; [http://www.caaonline.com/caa_content.asp?PageType=Dept&amp;Key=15&amp;MCat=4 CAAOnline: Carriage Tour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806191808/http://caaonline.com/caa_content.asp?PageType=Dept&amp;Key=15&amp;MCat=4 |date=2007-08-06 }}. Carriage Association of America&lt;/ref&gt;

The landau's center section might contain a fixed full-height glazed door, or more usually a low half-door. There would usually be a separate raised open coachman's upholstered bench-seat, but a landau could be [[postilion]]-driven, and there was usually a separate groom's seat, sprung above and behind the rear axle, saving the groom from having to stand on a running board.

A five-glass landau was fitted with a front glass windscreen and two windows on each side (including retractable windows on the doors).

The landau reached its full development by the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10420437&amp;wwwflag=&amp;imagepos=5 George A. Hooper design of a landau, 1856]&lt;/ref&gt; It was purely a city carriage of luxury type. The low shell of the landau made for maximum visibility of the occupants and their clothing, a feature that makes a landau still a popular choice for [[Lord Mayor|Lords Mayor]] on ceremonial occasions.

== Landaulet ==
{{main|Landaulet (carriage)}}
A landaulet carriage is a cut-down ([[Coupé#History|coupé]]) version of a landau carriage. The landaulet retained the rear half of the landau's two-part folding top.{{Sfn| Merriam-Webster | 1991 | p=358 }}

== Royal use in Britain ==
[[File:State Opening of Parliament State Landau.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A State Landau being used to convey the [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Royal]] and other senior members of the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]] back to [[Buckingham Palace]] after the 2008 [[State Opening of Parliament]].]]

The [[Royal Mews]] contains several different types of landau: seven State Landaus are in regular use (dating from between 1838 &amp; 1872), plus five Semi-state Landaus.&lt;ref&gt;'The Royal Mews', Pitkin, 1973 &amp; 1990&lt;/ref&gt; As well as being slightly plainer in ornamentation, the Semi-state Landaus are distinguished from the State Landaus in that they are [[postilion]]-driven, rather than driven from the [[Coach (carriage)|box]].{{cn|date=May 2018}} &lt;!--(It may be noted that a [[coachman]] on a box-seat rather obscures the passengers in a landau from public view. For this reason, even when others are riding in State Landaus, The Queen tends to ride in one of the Semi-state versions so as to be clearly seen.) {{cn}} twisted logic - postilions much grander than a single coachman.--&gt;
[[File:Lord Mayor's Show, London 2006 (295489240).jpg|250px|thumb|right|Semi-state Postilion Landau (on loan for the [[Lord Mayor's Show]]).]]

The [[1902 State Landau]] was built for the coronation of Edward VII in 1902. Unlike the earlier State Landaus, it is postilion-driven. So too are the five Ascot Landaus, smaller and lighter carriages with basket-work sides, which are used each year (as their name suggests) at [[Royal Ascot]]. The Royal Mews also retains a miniature landau made for the children of [[George V]] and designed to be pulled by ponies.

Landaus make for a striking display as long as the weather is fine, and they are used on occasions ranging from State Visits and the Opening of Parliament, to Royal Weddings, Jubilees and other celebrations. They also play a regular part in the welcoming of new ambassadors to the [[Court of St James's]]: soon after arriving in [[London]], foreign [[ambassador]]s have an audience with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] in which they present their [[Letters of Credence]] or Letters of High Commission to Her Majesty. The ambassadors are collected from the embassy or residence by a State landau from the [[Royal Mews]] for this purpose, and escorted by the [[Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps]], who is based at [[St. James's Palace]]. The ambassador's suite follows in another State landau.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/Audiences/Ambassadorscredentials.aspx Ambassador's credentials] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309035640/http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/Audiences/Ambassadorscredentials.aspx |date=2009-03-09 }}, Official Website of The British Monarchy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
The [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch of Canada]] has a [[Royal and viceroyal transport in Canada#Carriage and automobile|state landau]] at his or her disposal in [[Ottawa]] for ceremonial processions from [[Rideau Hall]] to [[Parliament Hill]]. The State Landau was given to Canada in 1911 and was formerly used by the [[Governor General of Australia]].

For the [[Queen's Plate]] in [[Toronto]], the monarch and the royal family have a private landau owned by the [[Ontario Jockey Club]] and gift from [[E.P. Taylor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3899">The '''Light Up the World Organization (LUTW)''' is a non-profit humanitarian organization dedicated to providing lighting to poor people in remote areas who currently rely on [[kerosene lamp]]s or even wood [[fire]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lutw.org/illum_globalchallenge.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515064755/http://lutw.org/illum_globalchallenge.html |archivedate=2006-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from improved night-time lighting this gives health benefits and financial benefits.

LUTW is affiliated with the [[University of Calgary]], [[Canada]].

== Programs ==

To date, lighting has been provided to more than 14,000 homes in 26 countries,[https://web.archive.org/web/20061007063535/http://www.lutw.org/about.htm] such as Sri Lanka and South Africa.

== Technology ==

LUTW uses a combination of white [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] (WLED) lights or [[LED lamp]]s and a source of [[renewable energy]], typically [[solar cell]]s but alternatively person powered pedal [[Electrical generator|generator]]s, [[micro hydro]] or small [[wind turbine]]s. The solar cells are suitable for providing electricity in remote areas, while the LED lights are chosen for their efficiency, durability, and relatively low cost. The efficiency of the lights means that relatively small solar panels are needed, reducing the capital cost.
There is currently a movement towards the implementation of CFLs (compact fluorescent lighting) as it has been determined to be far more efficient than white LEDs (WLEDs) with recent technology advances. LUTW has recently been discussing the benefits of biogas and is looking into the future of it.

== Benefits ==

Although the lighting system is somewhat expensive for the villagers (approximately US$75)[https://web.archive.org/web/20060418063452/http://www.earthsky.org/shows/show.php?date=20060411] in the long term the cost of kerosene for lamps is eliminated. The elimination of kerosene smoke is a health benefit, and the light is also brighter than a kerosene lamp.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060515064755/http://lutw.org/illum_globalchallenge.html]

The LUTW website cites a [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]] paper, which argues that replacing kerosene lamps with [[LED lamp|LED Lamps]] helps reduce [[greenhouse gas]]es. The paper says:

{{quote|The single-greatest way to reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions associated with lighting energy use is to replace kerosene lamps with white-LED electric lighting systems in developing countries; this can be accomplished even while dramatically increasing currently deficient lighting service levels|Mills, 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eetd.lbl.gov/emills/PUBS/Global_Lighting_Potential.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315204338/http://eetd.lbl.gov/emills/PUBS/Global_Lighting_Potential.html |archivedate=2007-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Manjil, Harzvil, Siahpoush and Rudbar Wind Farms''' are [[wind farms]] located in [[Gilan]], Iran. In 1995 the Iranian governors decided to use renewable energies in Iran and started to develop wind farms in Manjil area. They start with installing a Nord Tank NTK-500/37 wind turbine. They added other products of Nordtank such as NTK-300/35 and NTK-550/42. The developer was Iran Renewable energies organization (SUNA) as representative of TAVANIR, and they chose Saba-Niroo as Iranian manufacturer to produce wind turbines in Iran. Saba-Niroo signed a joint venture agreement with Vestas to produce V47-660/45 in Iran. Moshanir power engineering consultants were the consultants of the project.
Finally, the project finished in February 2015.
Due to the privatization policy, TAVANIR established Manjil green power production company and transferred all of his ownership on the mentioned power plant to this company. 
The company transferred to Omid Taban Hour Energy Management company on February 22, 2018.
The total installed wind turbines in this project are as below:
* Roudbar wind farm 4 units WTG with total capacity 2.15&amp;nbsp;MW
* Harzevil wind farm 25 units WTG with total capacity 12.18&amp;nbsp;MW
* Manjil wind farm 52 units WTG with total capacity 27.47&amp;nbsp;MW
* Siahpoosh wind farm 69 units WTG with total capacity 45.54&amp;nbsp;MW
Totally 150 units with total capacity of 87.34&amp;nbsp;MW

A '''matryoshka doll''' ({{lang-rus|матрёшка|p=mɐˈtrʲɵʂkə|a=Ru-матрёшка.ogg}}), also known as a '''Russian nesting doll''', '''stacking dolls''', or '''Russian doll''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/russian-doll russian doll]. (n.d.). ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'' Complete &amp; Unabridged 10th Edition. Retrieved April 14, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; is a set of wooden [[doll]]s of decreasing size placed one inside another.  The name "matryoshka" (матрёшка), literally "little matron", is a [[diminutive]] form of Russian female first name "Matryona" (Матрёна) or "Matriosha".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/ Oxford English Dictionary Online]. Accessed 2011-03-25.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=May 2018}}[[File:Matroschkas.jpg|left|thumb|Matryoshkas are a popular souvenir for tourists in Russia]]A set of matryoshkas consists of a wooden figure, which separates, top from bottom, to reveal a smaller figure of the same sort inside, which has, in turn, another figure inside of it, and so on.

The first Russian nested doll set was made in 1890 by [[Vasily Zvyozdochkin]] from a design by [[Sergey Malyutin]], who was a folk crafts painter at [[Abramtsevo Colony|Abramtsevo]]. Traditionally the outer layer is a woman, dressed in a [[sarafan]], a long and shapeless traditional Russian peasant [[jumper dress]]. The figures inside may be of either gender; the smallest, innermost doll is typically a baby turned from a single piece of wood. Much of the artistry is in the painting of each doll, which can be very elaborate. The dolls often follow a theme; the themes may vary, from [[fairy tale]] characters to [[Soviet leaders]]. In the west, Matryoshka dolls are often erroneously&lt;ref&gt;[https://russianlegacy.com/matryoshka-nesting-dolls.htm Russian Legacy]. Accessed 2018-03-06.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to as "'''babushka dolls'''", ''babushka'' meaning "grandmother" or "old woman".

== History ==
[[File:First matryoshka museum doll open.jpg|thumb|The original matryoshka set by [[Vasily Zvyozdochkin|Zvyozdochkin]] and [[Sergey Malyutin|Malyutin]], 1892]]
The first Russian nested doll set was carved in 1890 by [[Vasily Zvyozdochkin]] and designed by [[Sergey Malyutin]], who was a folk crafts painter in the [[Abramtsevo Colony|Abramtsevo]] estate of [[Savva Mamontov]], a Russian industrialist and patron of arts.&lt;ref name="russianlife"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianlife.com/article.cfm?Number=196 |title=Matryoshka - Soul of Russia |work=[[Russian Life]] |date= |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Billington"&gt;{{cite book |title=Russia in search of itself |first=James H. |last=Billington |publisher=Woodrow Wilson Center Press |year=2004 |ISBN=978-0-8018-7976-0 |page=148,208 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zRVi2XpqJuIC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=Japanese+Matryoshka&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xHL8TcyYA9HFtAbb-LTxDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEUQuwUwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Japanese%20Matryoshka&amp;f=false |accessdate=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doll set was painted by Malyutin. Malyutin's doll set consisted of eight dolls—the outermost was a girl in a traditional dress holding a [[rooster]]. The inner dolls were girls and a boy, and the innermost a baby.&lt;ref name="russianlife" /&gt;

The origin of the inspiration for matroshka dolls is not clear. It is believed that Zvyozdochkin and Malyutin were inspired by eastern Asian culture, for example the doll [[Honshu]], named after the main island of [[Japan]], however the Honshu figures cannot be placed one inside another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rbth.com/arts/2015/08/08/the_secrets_of_the_russian_matryoshka_48375.html|title=More than just a pretty face: The secrets of the Russian matryoshka|last=Kostomárova|first=Elena|date=2015-08-08|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources differ in descriptions of the doll, describing it as either a round, hollow [[daruma doll]], portraying a bald old [[Buddhist]] monk,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.vokrugsveta.ru/vs/article/1660/ Три матрешки]" (Three Matryoshkas), ''[[Vokrug sveta]]'', July 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[Seven Lucky Gods]] nesting doll.&lt;ref name="russianlife" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Billington" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eastern roots of the most famous Russian toy |date=2011-03-24 |publisher=Russian Geographical Society |url=http://int.rgo.ru/news/eastern-roots-of-the-most-famous-russian-toy/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301205606/http://int.rgo.ru/news/eastern-roots-of-the-most-famous-russian-toy/ |archivedate=March 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savva Mamontov's wife presented the dolls at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris, where the toy earned a bronze medal. Soon after, matryoshka dolls were being made in several places in Russia and shipped around the world.

== Themes in dolls ==
[[File:Poupées russes.JPG|thumb|[[Alsace|Alsacian]] matryoshka dolls]]
Matryoshka dolls&lt;ref name="FromRussia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fromrussia.com/russian-dolls/nesting-dolls-matryoshkas |title=Matryoshka dolls |work=[[FromRussia]] |date= |accessdate=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; are often designed to follow a particular theme; for instance, peasant girls in traditional dress. Originally, themes were often drawn from tradition or [[fairy tale]] characters, in keeping with the craft tradition—but since the late 20th century, they have embraced a larger range, including Russian leaders.

Common themes of Matryoshkas are floral and relate to nature. Often Christmas, Easter and religion are used as themes for the doll. Modern artists create many new styles of the nesting dolls, mostly as an alternative purchase option for tourism. These includes animal collections, portraits and [[caricatures]] of famous politicians, musicians, athletes, astronauts, "robots," and popular movie stars. Today, some Russian artists specialize in painting themed matryoshka dolls that feature specific categories of subjects, people or nature. Areas with notable matryoshka styles include [[Sergiyev Posad]], Semionovo (now the town of [[Semyonov (town)|Semyonov]]),&lt;ref&gt;"[http://rbth.com/articles/2011/07/15/the_hardworking_women_behind_the_matryoshkas_hope_for_an_olympic_boo_13151.html The hardworking women behind the matryoshkas hope for an Olympic boost]". July 18, 2011, Natalya Radulova, ''[[Ogonyok]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polkhovsky Maidan]], and [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Kirov]].

===Political Matryoshka===
[[File:Matryoshka Russian politicians.jpg|thumb|Russian leaders in matryoshka form|left]]
In the late 1980s and early 1990s during [[Perestroika]], freedom of expression allowed the [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|leaders of the Soviet Union]] to become a common theme of matryoshka, with the largest doll featuring then-current leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. These became very popular at the time, affectionately earning the nickname of a "Gorby", namesake of Gorbachev. With the periodic succession of Russian leadership after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], newer versions would start to feature [[List of presidents of Russia|Russian presidents]] [[Boris Yeltsin]], [[Vladimir Putin]], and [[Dmitry Medvedev]].

Most sets feature the current leader as the largest doll, with the predecessors decreasing in size. The remaining smaller dolls may feature other former leaders such as [[Leonid Brezhnev]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]], [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], and sometimes several historically significant [[List of Russian rulers|Tsars]] such as [[Nicholas II]] and [[Peter the Great]]. [[Yuri Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]] almost never appear due to the short length of their respective terms. However, some less common sets may feature the current leader as the smallest doll, with the predecessors increasing in size, usually with Stalin or Lenin as the largest doll.

Some sets that include Yeltsin preceding Gorbachev were made during the brief period between the [[Russian presidential referendum, 1991|establishment of President of the RSFSR]] and the collapse of the Soviet Union, as both Yeltsin and Gorbachev were concurrently in prominent government positions. During Medvedev's presidency, Medvedev and Putin may both share the largest doll due to Putin still having a prominent role in the government as [[Prime Minister of Russia]]. As of Putin's re-election as the 4th President of Russia, Medvedev will usually succeed Yeltsin and preceded Putin in stacking order, due to Putin's role solely as the largest doll.

Political matryoshka usually range between 5 and 10 dolls per set.

== World record ==
The largest set of matryoshka dolls in the world is a 51-piece set hand-painted by Youlia Bereznitskaia of Russia, completed in 2003. The tallest doll in the set measures {{convert|53.97|cm|in}}; the smallest, {{convert|0.31|cm|in}}. Arranged side-by-side, the dolls span {{convert|3.41|m|ftin|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-russian-nesting-doll-(matryoshka)/|title=Largest Russian nesting doll (matryoshka)|work=guinnessworldrecords.com|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As metaphor ==
[[File:Matryoshka transparent.png|left|thumb|The concept of the Russian dolls is used as a visual example in various topics]]
Matryoshka is often seen as a symbol of the feminine side of Russian culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29539185|title=Mother Russia : the feminine myth in Russian culture|page=19|last=1939-|first=Hubbs, Joanna,|date=1993, ©1988|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0253208424|edition=  1st Midland Book |location=Bloomington|oclc=29539185}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Matryoshka is associated in Russia with family and fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rbth.com/arts/2015/08/08/the_secrets_of_the_russian_matryoshka_48375.html|title=More than just a pretty face: The secrets of the Russian matryoshka|last=Kostomárova|pages=8–12|first=Elena|date=2015-08-08|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Matryoshka dolls are a traditional representation of the mother carrying a child within her and can be seen as a representation of a chain of mother's carrying on the family legacy through the child in their womb. Furthermore, Matryoshka dolls are used to illustrate the unity of body, soul, mind, heart and spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/767566167|title=Writing--the sacred art : beyond the page to spiritual practice|page=137|last=M.|first=Shapiro, Rami|date=2012|publisher=SkyLight Paths Pub|others=Shapiro, Aaron.|isbn=9781594733727|edition=  Quality paperback |location=Woodstock, Vt.|oclc=767566167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/934717840|title=Downloading spirit : babushka.|last=Janet.|first=Baljeu,|date=2012|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=1469157640|oclc=934717840}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70836680|title=Power of the soul : inside wisdom for an outside world|page=3|last=1961-|first=Holland, John,|date=2007|publisher=Hay House|isbn=9781401910853|edition=  1st|location=Carlsbad, Calif.|oclc=70836680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matryoshkas are also used [[metaphor]]ically, as a [[design paradigm]], known as the “[[matryoshka principle]]” or “nested doll principle”. It denotes a recognizable relationship of “object-within-similar-object” that appears in the design of many other natural and crafted objects. Examples of this use include the [[matrioshka brain]], the [[Matroska]] media-container format, and the Russian Doll model of [[carbon nanotube#Multi-walled|multi-walled carbon nanotubes]].

The [[onion model|onion metaphor]] is of similar character. If the outer layer is peeled off an onion, a similar onion exists within. This structure is employed by designers in applications such as the layering of clothes or the design of tables, where a smaller table nests within a larger table, and a smaller one within that.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2848">'''Off-center [[ion]]s''' in [[crystal]]s are [[Crystallographic defect|substitutional impurity ions]] whose equilibrium position is shifted away from the regular [[crystal structure|lattice]] site.  The magnitude of the shift typically ranges from 0.2 to 1.0 Å. There are two possible mechanisms that can cause impurity ion displacement. If the impurity ion is smaller than the regular ion (by 10% or more), the displacement arises because the repulsive forces between the impurity ion and its nearest neighbors stabilizing the ion at the regular site are strongly weakened.&lt;ref&gt;Smoluchowski R. Magnetic resonance and radiofrequency spectroscopy (Proc. XV Colloque AMPERE). Amsterdam-London, 1969, p.120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Narayanamurti V., Pohl R.O. Rev. Mod. Phys., 42, 201 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glinchuk M.D. In “Modern problems in condensed matter sciences”, v.7 – The dynamical Jahn-Teller effect in localized systems, ed. by Yu. Perlin, M.Wagner.

Conf. on Defects in Insulating Materials, Nordkirchen, Germany, August 16–22, 1992, ed. by O.Kanert and J.-M.Spaeth, World Scientific Publ. Co, 1993, p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; If the impurity ion is bigger than the regular ion, the displacement arises because of different covalency of the chemical bonds with the nearest neighbors for the impurity and regular ions.&lt;ref&gt;A.I. Lebedev and I.A. Sluchinskaya, Ferroelectrics 143, 91 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.I. Lebedev, I.A. Sluchinskaya, A. Erko, A.A. Veligzhanin, A.A. Chernyshov. Physics of the Solid State 51, 991 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Off-center position of [[crystallographic defect|substitutional ions]] was first discovered in lithium-doped [[Potassium chloride|KCl]] by two groups of American  physicists in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Sack H.S., Moriarty M. C. Solid State Commun., 3, 93 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo G., Pohl R.O. Phys. Rev. Lett., 15, 291 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; Since these pioneer works crystals with off-center impurity ions have attracted continuous attention. The cause of such interest is that these crystals can be used as good model objects for the investigation of such key phenomena in [[solid state physics]] as [[quantum tunnelling]] of atomic particles in solid state, cooperative properties of the system of local centers with internal degrees of freedom, and [[ferroelectricity]].

'''Operation Chough''' ({{lang-kw|An Ragdres Palores}}) is a conservationist project which aims to create a viable population of [[red-billed chough]] (''Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax'') in [[Cornwall]]. This bird is widely considered a symbol of the county and [[Cornish people|its people]] and was once commonly seen throughout Cornish landscapes. In spite of this close association, the chough population experienced a severe decline in Cornwall through the 20th century, and had not been seen in the county since the early 1970s. In 2001, however, up to five birds were seen on [[The Lizard]], thought to have come from Ireland. This pioneer population rapidly grew, with their offspring reaching nearly twenty birds. Since then, the Operation has made several efforts to keep this population viable by monitoring the nesting areas, promoting awareness of the cultural and environmental importance of the species to Cornwall and by releasing birds to further enlarge the genetic pool of the pioneer communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paradisepark.org.uk/conservation/operation-chough/ |title=Operation Chough|accessdate=12 August 2016|website = Paradise Park Wildlife Sanctuary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''panemone windmill''' is a type of [[vertical axis wind turbine]]. It has a rotating axis positioned vertically, while the wind-catching blades move parallel to the wind. By contrast, the shaft of a [[Wind turbine#Horizontal axis|horizontal axis wind turbine]] (HAWT) points into the wind while its blades move at right-angles to the wind's thrust. That is, a panemone primarily uses [[Drag (physics)|drag]] whereas the blades of a HAWT use [[Lift (force)|lift]].&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;

Historically the earliest known wind machine was made by the Persians and it was the panemone design, consisting of a wall, with slits, surrounding a vertical axle containing four to eight fabric [[sails]]. As the [[wind]] blew, the sails would turn the [[axle]], which was in turn connected to grain grinders or some form of water [[transportation]] device (though little is known of the actual details of such methods).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/windmill|title=How is a windmill made?|accessdate=2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of wind power}}
[[Image:Panemone bladed rotor WECS (Turks&amp;Caicos).JPG|thumb|right|150px|The panemone design used by the Turks &amp; Caicos islanders]]
No one knows when or where people first built windmills to do work. The first instance may have been in China more than 2,000 years ago, but archaeologists have found no definite record of their use there before 1219 AD. The earliest recorded windmill design found was [[Iran|Persian]] in origin, and was invented around 500&amp;ndash;900 AD. Other sources date it to as early as 200 to 250 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eldridge|first1=Frank|title=Wind Machines|date=1980|publisher=Litton Educational Publishing, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-442-26134-9|page=15|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shepherd|first1=William|title=Electricity Generation Using Wind Power|date=2011|publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.|location=Singapore|isbn=978-981-4304-13-9|page=4|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design was the panemone, with vertical lightweight wooden sails attached by horizontal struts to a central vertical shaft. It was first built to pump water, and subsequently modified to grind [[grain]] as well.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

Before becoming a slave to Calif Umar, '''Pīrūz Nahāvandi''' used to design and build windmills. In the 9th. century AD., Pīrūz brought a complaint to Umar about the high tax charged to him by his master Mughirah. Umar wrote to Mughirah and inquired about the tax; Mughirah's reply was satisfactory, but Umar held that the tax charged from Abu Lulu was reasonable, owing to his daily income. Umar then is reported to have asked Abu Lulu to design a windmill for him, in which Pīrūz replies, " By God, I will build this [wind]mill of which the World will talk".&lt;ref&gt;RJ Forbes. Studies in ancient technology. Vol. 9. Brill, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
[[Image:Panemone bladed rotor wind energy harvester.JPG|thumb|right|150px|A panemone WEH with 8 airfoils]]
The vanes of a panemone are moved by the wind in a circle to turn the drive shaft. To accomplish this they must move with the wind only while on one side of the circle, and move against the wind on the other side. To prevent the vanes moving upwind from being blown back by the wind, one half of the panemone may be shielded, or else the vanes may be attached so that they can turn edge-on to the wind when the wheel is moving them upwind.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;

==Efficiency==
[[Image:Panemone WEH setups.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Adding a windbarrier to one side increases efficiency]]
Wind-harnessing devices which rely on drag reach their maximum efficiency if the collector is pushed away from the wind. Because the wind panels do no [[work (physics)|work]] while returning to the upwind side of the device, the rotor in the Persian panemone design can only take energy from wind striking half the collection area (see diagram).

The panemone is one of the least efficient types of [[wind turbine]]. Despite this it is also one of the most commonly re-invented and patented forms.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telosnet.com/wind/early.html|title=Part 1 &amp;mdash; Early History Through 1875 |accessdate=2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/albie/projects/panemone.htm|title=A Panemone (Drag-Type Windmill)|accessdate=2008-07-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025025613/http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/albie/projects/panemone.htm|archivedate=2008-10-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Paper recycling in Ponte a Serraglio.JPG|thumb|400px|Waste paper collected for recycling in Italy]]
[[File:Deutsche Bahn Mülltrennung - Papier.jpg|thumb|Bin to collect paper for recycling in a German train station]]
The recycling of paper is the process by which waste paper is turned into new paper products. It has a number of important benefits besides saving trees from being cut down. It is less energy and water intensive than paper made from wood pulp. It saves waste paper from occupying landfill and producing methane as it breaks down. Around two thirds of all paper products in the US are now recovered and recycled, although it does not all become new paper. After repeated processing the fibers become too short for the production of new paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Paper Recycling Facts, Figures and Information Sources |url=https://www.thebalancesmb.com/paper-recycling-facts-figures-and-information-sources-2877868 |website=Small Business |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three categories of paper that can be used as feedstocks for making ''recycled paper'': mill broke, pre-consumer waste, and [[post-consumer waste]].&lt;ref name="debunking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Debunking the Myths of Recycled Paper|url=http://recyclingpoint.com.sg/Articles/feb1992myth_of_recycledpaper.htm|publisher=Recycling Point Dot Com|accessdate=4 February 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006094659/http://www.recyclingpoint.com.sg/Articles/feb1992myth_of_recycledpaper.htm |archivedate = 6 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mill broke'' is paper trimmings and other paper scrap from the manufacture of paper, and is recycled in a [[paper mill]]. ''Pre-consumer waste'' is a material which left the paper mill but was discarded before it was ready for consumer use. ''Post-consumer'' waste is material discarded after consumer use, such as old corrugated containers (OCC), old magazines, and newspapers.&lt;ref name=debunking/&gt; Paper suitable for recycling is called "scrap paper", often used to produce [[moulded pulp]] packaging. The industrial process of removing [[printing ink]] from paper fibres of recycled paper to make [[deinked pulp]] is called [[deinking]], an invention of the German jurist [[Justus Claproth]].

==Process==
The process of waste paper recycling most often involves mixing used/old paper with water and chemicals to break it down. It is then chopped up and heated, which breaks it down further into strands of cellulose, a type of organic plant material; this resulting mixture is called pulp, or slurry. It is strained through [[Sieve|screens]], which remove any glue or [[plastic]] (especially from 
[[plastic-coated paper]]) that may still be in the mixture then cleaned, de-inked, bleached, and mixed with water. Then it can be made into new recycled paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How is Paper Recycled |url=http://www.tappi.org/paperu/all_about_paper/earth_answers/earthanswers_recycle.pdf |publisher=TAPPI |accessdate=28 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130061422/http://www.tappi.org/paperu/all_about_paper/earth_answers/EarthAnswers_Recycle.pdf |archivedate=30 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The share of ink in a wastepaper stock is up to about 2% of the total weight.&lt;ref&gt;R. McKinney: Technology of Paper Recycling, 1995, p. 351. {{ISBN|9780751400175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale for recycling==
Industrialized paper making has an effect on the environment both upstream (where raw materials are acquired and processed) and downstream (waste-disposal impacts).&lt;ref&gt;Hershkowitz, A. (2002). ''Bronx ecology.'' Washington DC: Island Press. p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, 40% of paper pulp is created from wood (in most modern mills only 9-16% of pulp is made from pulp logs; the rest comes from waste wood that was traditionally burnt). Paper production accounts for about 35% of felled trees,&lt;ref name="chase"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecology.com/features/paperchase/index.html|title=Paper Chase|accessdate=21 September 2007|last=Martin|first=Sam|year=2004|publisher=Ecology Communications, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and represents 1.2% of the world's total economic output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/ad493e/ad493e03.htm|title=Trends and Current Status of the Contribution of the Forestry Sector to National Economies|accessdate=21 September 2007|year=2004|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recycling one ton of [[newsprint]] saves about 1 ton of wood while recycling 1 ton of printing or copier paper saves slightly more than 2 tons of wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpressinitiative.org/documents/recycledfiberfactsheet-EPN.pdf|title=Environmental Paper Network|accessdate=23 October 2011|year=2007|publisher=Green Press Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because [[Kraft process|kraft pulping]] requires twice as much wood since it removes [[lignin]] to produce higher quality fibres than mechanical pulping processes. Relating tons of paper recycled to the number of trees not cut is meaningless, since tree size varies tremendously and is the major factor in how much paper can be made from how many trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiritone.com/~brucem/savetree.htm|title=How Many Recycled Newspapers Does It Take to Save A Tree?|accessdate=22 September 2007|last=Marcot|first=Bruce G.|year=1992|publisher=The Ecology Plexus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trees raised specifically for pulp production account for 16% of world pulp production, old growth forests 9% and second- and third- and more generation forests account for the balance.&lt;ref name="chase"/&gt; Most pulp mill operators practice [[reforestation]] to ensure a continuing supply of trees.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification]] (PEFC) and the [[Forest Stewardship Council|Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)]] certify paper made from trees harvested according to guidelines meant to ensure good forestry practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fsccanada.org/certification.htm|title=Certification Tracking products from the forest to the shelf!|accessdate=21 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that recycling half the world’s paper would avoid the harvesting of 20 million acres (81,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of forestland.&lt;ref&gt;EarthWorks Group. 1990. "The Recycler’s Handbook". Berkeley, CA: The EarthWorks Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy===

Energy consumption is reduced by recycling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Case history: The truth about recycling|url=http://www.economist.com/node/9249262?story_id=9249262|work=The Economist|accessdate=19 Apr 2012|date=9 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is debate concerning the actual energy savings realized. The [[Energy Information Administration]] claims a 40% reduction in energy when paper is recycled versus paper made with unrecycled pulp,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

About 35% of municipal solid waste (before recycling) in the United States by weight is paper and paper products. 42.4% of that is recycled.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/muncpl/pubs/ex-sum05.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912025805/http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/muncpl/pubs/ex-sum05.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 September 2007|title=Executive Summary: Municipal Solid Waste in the United States: 2005 Facts and Figures|accessdate=23 October 2007|year=200|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|format=PDF }}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water and air pollution===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has found that recycling causes 35% less water pollution and 74% less air pollution than making virgin paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/osw/conserve/onthego/info/index.htm|title=Recyc2007|accessdate=30 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pulp mill]]s can be sources of both air and water pollution, especially if they are producing [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleached]] pulp. Modern mills produce considerably less pollution than those of a few decades ago. Recycling paper decreases the demand for virgin pulp, thus reducing the overall amount of air and water pollution associated with paper manufacture. Recycled pulp can be bleached with the same chemicals used to bleach virgin pulp, but [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[sodium hydrosulfite]] are the most common bleaching agents. Recycled pulp, or paper made from it, is known as PCF (process chlorine free) if no chlorine-containing compounds were used in the recycling process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pneac.org/sheets/all/paper.cfm|title=Facts About Paper|accessdate=30 October 2007|last=MacFadden|first=Todd|author2=Michael P. Vogel|date=June 1996|publisher=Printers' National Environmental Assistance Center, Montana State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recycling mills may have polluting by-products like sludge. De-inking at Cross Pointe's Miami, Ohio mill results in sludge weighing 22% of the weight of wastepaper recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/energyfacts/saving/recycling/solidwaste/paperandglass.html|title=Recycling Paper and Glass|date=September 2006|publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=30 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recycling facts and figures==
In the mid-19th century, there was an increased demand for books and writing material. Up to that time, paper manufacturers had used discarded linen rags for paper, but supply could not keep up with the increased demand. Books were bought at auctions for the purpose of recycling fiber content into new paper, at least in the United Kingdom, by the beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Howsam|first=Leslie|title=Cheap Bibles: Nineteenth Century Publishing and the British and Foreign Bible Society|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521522129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally, about half of all recovered paper comes from converting losses (pre-consumer recycling), such as shavings and unsold periodicals; approximately one third comes from household or post-consumer waste.&lt;ref name="BIR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Recovered Paper|work=Bureau of International Recycling|url=http://www.bir.org/aboutrecycling/paper.asp|accessdate =20 May 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070406125712/http://www.bir.org/aboutrecycling/paper.asp |archivedate = 6 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some statistics on paper consumption:

==By region==

===European Union===
Paper recycling in Europe has a long history. The industry self-initiative [http://www.paperforrecycling.eu European Recovered Paper Council](ERPC) was set up in 2000 to monitor progress towards meeting the paper recycling targets set out in the 2000 European Declaration on Paper Recycling. Since then, the commitments in the Declaration have been renewed every five years. In 2011, the ERPC committed itself to meeting and maintaining both a voluntary recycling rate target of 70% in the then E-27 plus Switzerland and Norway by 2015 as well as qualitative targets in areas such as waste prevention, ecodesign and research and development. In 2014 the paper recycling rate in Europe was 71.7%, as stated in the [http://www.paperrecovery.org/uploads/Modules/Publications/Final_MonitoringReport2014.pdf 2014 Monitoring Report].

===Japan===
Municipal collections of paper for recycling are in place. However, according to the ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'', in 2008, eight paper manufacturers in Japan have admitted to intentionally mislabeling recycled paper products, exaggerating the amount of recycled paper used.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

===United States===
Recycling has long been practiced in the [[Recycling in America|United States]]. In 2012, paper and paperboard accounted for 68 million tons of municipal solid waste generated in the U.S., down from more than 87 million tons in 2000, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;ref name=AL&gt;[http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2014/12/how_textbooks_become_toilet_pa.html How textbooks become toilet paper: A Birmingham recycling center moves beyond newsprint and cans], AL.com, Jon Reed, December 01, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; While paper is the most commonly recycled material—64.6 percent was recovered in 2012—it is being used less overall than at the turn of the century.&lt;ref name=AL/&gt; Paper accounts for more than a half of all recyclables collected in the US, by weight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/paper/faqs.htm Wastes - Resource Conservation - Common Wastes &amp; Materials - Paper Recycling Frequent Questions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of paper recycling has several dates of importance:
* In 1690: The first paper mill to use recycled linen was established by the Rittenhouse family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipst.gatech.edu/amp/collection/museum_pm_usa.htm|title=Papermaking Moves to the United States|accessdate=20 October 2007|publisher=Robert C. Williams Paper Museum, Georgia Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1896: The first major recycling center was started by the Benedetto family in New York City, where they collected rags, newspaper, and trash with a pushcart.
* In 1993: The first year when more paper was recycled than was buried in landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipst.gatech.edu/amp/collection/museum_recycling.htm|title=Recycling in the Paper Industry|accessdate=20 October 2007|publisher=Robert C. Williams Paper Museum, Georgia Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, over half of all paper used in the United States is collected and recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Paper University – All About Paper |url=http://www.tappi.org/paperu/all_about_paper/faq.htm |accessdate=20 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510055250/http://www.tappi.org/paperu/all_about_paper/faq.htm |archivedate=10 May 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paper products are still the largest component of [[municipal solid waste]], making up more than 40% of the composition of [[landfill]]s{{When|date=March 2016}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Municipal Solid Waste – FAQ|work=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|url=http://www.epa.gov/msw/faq.htm|accessdate=28 April 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927081802/http://www.epa.gov/msw/faq.htm|archivedate=27 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="baird"&gt;Baird, Colin (2004) ''Environmental Chemistry'' (3rd ed.) p. 512.

The US paper industry set a goal of recovering 55 percent of all paper used in the US by 2012. Paper products used by the packaging industry were responsible for about 77% of packaging materials recycled, with more than 24 million pounds recovered in 2005.&lt;ref name="data"&gt;[http://stats.paperrecycles.org/index.php?graph=corrcont&amp;x=37&amp;y=9 Data on Paper Recovery]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1998, some 9,000 curbside recycling programs and 12,000 recyclable drop-off centers existed nationwide. As of 1999, 480 [[materials recovery facilities]] had been established to process the collected materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Municipal Solid Waste – Recycling|work=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|url=http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/muncpl/recycle.htm|accessdate=2 April 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060308134427/http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/muncpl/recycle.htm |archivedate = 8 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, junk mail has become a larger part of the overall recycling stream, compared to newspapers or personal letters. However, the increase in junk mail is still smaller compared to the declining use of paper from those sources.&lt;ref name=AL/&gt;

In 2008, the global financial crisis caused the price of old newspapers to drop in the U.S. from $130 to $40 per short ton ($140/t to $45/t) in October.&lt;ref&gt;Page, Candace, Waste district raises recycling fees, ''Burlington Free Press'', 12 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The environmental impact due to excessive use of paper has negative effects on trees and forest.  Paper production utilizes nearly 40% of world’s commercially cut timber. Millions of acres of forests are destroyed leading to deforestation disturbing the ecological balance. Many initiatives are being taken in India for recycling paper and reducing the hazards associated with it. Shree Aniruddha Upasana Foundation (Mumbai, India) is one such organization which undertakes used paper recycling projects. The foundation encourages using paper bags instead of plastic ones which again are a serious hazard to environment. They accept old newspapers, notebooks and so on and recycle the same into paper bags, teaching aids and toys for children.
 
The foundation also makes eco-friendly Lord Ganesh (a Hindu Deity) idols from paper pulp which are worshiped in Indian homes every year during Ganesh Chaturthi Festival (a Hindu Festival celebrated on birthday of Lord Ganesh). These paper recycling activities are carried out throughout the year by the volunteers of the foundation converting waste paper into “No Waste”

===Mexico===
In Mexico, recycled paper, rather than wood pulp, is the principal feedstock in papermills accounting for about 75% of raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Business News Americas staff reporters|title=Paper, cardboard recycling industry ranked 4th in world, Mexico, Water &amp; Waste, news|url=http://www.bnamericas.com/news/waterandwaste/Paper,_cardboard_recycling_industry_ranked_4th_in_world|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--

I split this out from the [[recycling]] article. It may be of some use here.
===Newsprint===
There are upper limits on the percentage of the world’s [[newsprint]] that can be manufactured from recycled fiber. The most obvious upper limit is imposed by the nature of recycling itself. Some of the fiber that enters any recycled pulp mill is lost in pulping, due to inefficiencies inherent in the process. According to the web site of the U.K. chapter of Friends of the Earth&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/briefings/paper_recycling.html Friends of the Earth]&lt;/ref&gt; wood fiber can normally only be recycled up to five times due to damage experienced to the fiber. Thus, unless the quantity of newsprint used each year worldwide declines to reflect the lost fiber, a certain amount of new (virgin) fiber is required each year globally, even if the individual newsprint mill may continue to use 100% recycled fiber.

Additionally, some old newspapers never make it to a recycling plant, being used for a variety of household and industrial applications or simply ending up in landfill. Recycle rates (the percentage of annual newsprint consumption which is then recycled) vary from country to country and, within countries, from city to rural areas as well as from city to city. The American Forest &amp; Paper Association estimates that more than 72% of newsprint produced in North America in 2006 was recovered for re-use or export, with about 58% of that going back to a paper or paperboard mill for re-use, 16% being used by molded pulp mills (to make products such as egg cartons) and the balance being shipped offshore. Of the percentage that is re-used by a North American paper or paperboard mill, AFPA estimates that about a third goes back into newsprint manufacture.
Recycle rates can also vary over time with the price paid by the market for old newspapers, which can be quite volatile. As an example, in recent years, with [[the PRC|China]] growing as a manufacturer of various kinds of paper and packaging – using significant quantities of recycled fiber imported from the U.S. and elsewhere – its demand for old newspapers has at times been strong enough to influence recycled fiber prices worldwide. While high recycled fiber prices are good news for the goal of reducing landfill quantities, they can affect the profitability of newsprint mills using recycled fibers.

An important consideration in fiber selection by newsprint mills aside from cost is the high speeds of both modern newsprint machines and modern newspaper printing presses. There are newsprint machines in the U.S. operating at speeds approaching 1,400 meters per minute, according to industry information group RISI Inc., while the newest machines in the world (including some recently installed in China) can have speeds topping 1,800 meters per minute. Modern newspaper presses can run at speeds of up to 90,000 copies per hour (according to publishing industry association IFRA), with a few approaching 100,000 cph.

Such high speeds place severe demands on the strength of the sheet, both on the paper machine during the manufacturing process and on the press during printing. A number of newsprint mills around the world manufacture commercially acceptable qualities of newsprint using 100% recycled fiber. However, such mill operators must be very selective about the purity of the waste stream, making sure they employ a minimum of contaminants and include as much long-fibered old newsprint as possible. Virgin newsprint is made from long-fibered (softwood) trees such as [[spruce]], [[fir tree|fir]], [[balsam fir|balsam]] and [[pine]], while some paper and paperboard products are manufactured from shorter-fibered hardwood species. [[Newsprint]] mills prefer to use old newspapers, or a mix of old newspapers and old magazines, rather than recycling other paper grades. As U.S. municipalities have recently moved toward "single stream" recycling – collecting various waste products in a single compartment of a vehicle – mills have been forced to spend more money to procure a clean, appropriate waste stream for pulping purposes.

== Limitations and impacts ==
Along with fibres, paper can contain a variety of inorganic and organic constituents, including up to 10,000 different chemicals, which can potentially contaminate the newly manufactured paper products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Waste paper for recycling: Overview and identification of potentially critical substances|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X15001312|journal = Waste Management|doi = 10.1016/j.wasman.2015.02.028|first = Kostyantyn|last = Pivnenko|first2 = Eva|last2 = Eriksson|first3 = Thomas F.|last3 = Astrup|volume=45|pages=134–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, [[bisphenol A]] (a chemical commonly found in [[thermal paper]]) has been verified as a contaminant in a variety of paper products resulting from paper recycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bisphenol A and its structural analogues in household waste paper|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X15300349|journal = Waste Management|date = 2015-10-01|pages = 39–47|volume = 44|doi = 10.1016/j.wasman.2015.07.017|first = K.|last = Pivnenko|first2 = G.

'''''Piper aduncum''''', the '''spiked pepper''', '''matico''' or '''higuillo de hoja menuda''',&lt;ref&gt;{{PLANTS|id=PIAD|taxon=Piper aduncum|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a flowering plant in the family [[Piperaceae]]. Like many [[species]] in the [[Family (biology)|family]], the matico tree has a peppery odor.

==Use==
The fruits are used as a condiment and for flavoring [[Hot chocolate|cocoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Seidemann | first=Johannes | title=World Spice Plants: Economic Usage, Botany, Taxonomy | publisher=Springer | year=2005 | isbn = 3-540-22279-0 | pages = 289}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes used as a substitute for [[long pepper]].

==Traditional medicine==
In the [[Amazon Rainforest]], many of the native tribes use matico leaves as an [[antiseptic]]. In [[Peru]], it was used for stopping [[hemorrhage]]s and treating [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]]s, and in European practice in the treatment of diseases of the genitals and [[Urinary system|urinary organs]], such as those for which [[cubeb]] was often prescribed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Dispensatory of the United States of America | url = http://www.henriettesherbal.com/eclectic/usdisp/piper-angu.html | first = Joseph P. (Ed) | last= Remington |author2=Horatio C. Wood  | year = 1918 | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Matico is a tropical, [[evergreen]], [[shrubby]] tree that grows to the height of 6 to 7 meter (20 to 23&amp;nbsp;ft) with [[lance]]-shaped leaves that are 12 to 20 centimeter (5 to 8 in) long.

==Etymology==
According to legends, the plant was discovered by a wounded Spanish soldier named Matico.&lt;ref name=taylor/&gt; He learned, presumably from the local tribes, that applying the leaves to his wounds stopped bleeding, and it began to be called "Matico" or "soldier's herb". It was introduced into the profession of medicine in the United States and Europe by a [[Liverpool]] physician in 1839 as a [[styptic]] and [[astringent]] for wounds.&lt;ref name=taylor/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=August 2014}}

A '''pre-main-sequence star''' (also known as a '''PMS star''' and '''PMS object''') is a [[star]] in the stage when it has not yet reached the [[main sequence]]. Earlier in its life, the object is a [[protostar]] that grows by acquiring mass from its surrounding envelope of interstellar dust and gas. After the [[protostar]] blows away this envelope, it is optically visible, and appears on the [[stellar birthline]] in the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram|Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]]. At this point, the star has acquired nearly all of its mass but has not yet started [[hydrogen burning]] (i.e. [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen). The star then contracts, its internal temperature rising until it begins hydrogen burning on the [[zero age main sequence]]. This period of contraction is the pre-main sequence stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~reipurth/reviews/larson.pdf|title=The physics of star formation|author=Richard B. Larson|date=10 September 2003|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|volume=66|number=10|pages= 1669–73|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/66/10/r03 |arxiv = astro-ph/0306595 |bibcode = 2003RPPh...66.1651L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Discovering the Universe|author=Neil F.

W.  |author2=Palla, F. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = [[Wiley-VCH]]|year = 2004|isbn = 3-527-40559-3|location = Weinheim}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An observed PMS object can either be a [[T Tauri star]], if it has fewer than 2 [[solar mass]]es ({{Solar mass|link=y}}), or else a [[Herbig Ae/Be star]], if it has 2 to 8 {{Solar mass|link=y}}. Yet more massive stars have no pre-main-sequence stage because they contract too quickly as protostars. By the time they become visible, the hydrogen in their centers is already fusing and they are [[Main sequence|main-sequence]] objects.

The energy source of PMS objects is [[Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism|gravitational contraction]], as opposed to [[Proton-proton chain reaction|hydrogen burning]] in main-sequence stars. In the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]], pre-main-sequence stars with more than 0.5 {{Solar mass}} first move vertically downward along [[Hayashi track]]s, then leftward and horizontally along [[Henyey track]]s, until they finally halt at the [[main sequence]]. Pre-main-sequence stars with less than 0.5 {{Solar mass}} contract vertically along the [[Hayashi track]] for their entire evolution.

PMS stars can be differentiated empirically from main-sequence stars by using stellar spectra to measure their surface gravity.  A PMS object has a larger radius than a main-sequence star with the same [[stellar mass]] and thus has a lower surface gravity. Although they are optically visible, PMS objects are rare relative to those on the [[main sequence]], because their contraction lasts for only 1 percent of the time required for [[hydrogen fusion]]. During the early portion of the PMS stage, most stars have [[circumstellar disk]]s, which are the sites of [[planet formation]].

'''Rumenic acid''', also known as '''bovinic acid''', is a [[conjugated linoleic acid]] (CLA) found in the fat of [[ruminant]]s and in [[dairy product]]s.  It is an [[Essential fatty acid#Nomenclature and terminology|omega-7]] [[trans fat]]. Its lipid shorthand name is cis-9, trans-11 18:2 acid.
The name was proposed by Kramer ''et al.'' in 1998.&lt;ref name=Kramer&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kramer J, Parodi P, Jensen R, Mossoba M, Yurawecz M, Adlof R |title=Rumenic acid: a proposed common name for the major conjugated linoleic acid isomer found in natural products |journal=Lipids |volume=33 |issue=8 |page=835 |year=1998 |pmid=9727617 |doi=10.1007/s11745-998-0279-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is  formed along with [[vaccenic acid]] by biohydrogenation of dietary [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s in the [[rumen]].&lt;ref name=Destaillats&gt;{{cite journal

'''Spider silk''' is a [[protein]] [[fibre]] spun by [[spider]]s. Spiders use their [[silk]] to make [[Spider web|web]]s or other structures, which function as sticky nets to catch other animals, or as nests or cocoons to protect their offspring, or to wrap up prey. They can also use their silk to suspend themselves, to float through the air, or to glide away from predators. Most spiders vary the thickness and stickiness of their silk for different uses.

In some cases, spiders may even use silk as a source of food.&lt;ref name="DoiSMissing"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0952836903004540 |title=Silk feeding as an alternative foraging tactic in a kleptoparasitic spider under seasonally changing environments |date=2004 |last1=Miyashita |first1=Tadashi |last2=Maezono |first2=Yasunori |last3=Shimazaki |first3=Aya |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=262 |issue=3 |pages=225–229|url=http://frank.itlab.us/photo_essays/papers/Argyrodes_kleptoparasite_spider.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; While methods have been developed to collect silk from a spider by force,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Robert W. |last1=Work |first2=Paul D. |last2=Emerson |date=1982 |title=An Apparatus and Technique for the Forcible Silking of Spiders |journal=Journal of Arachnology |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |jstor=3705113}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to gather silk from many spiders in a small space, in contrast to [[Sericulture|silkworm]] "farms".

==Biodiversity==

===Uses===
All spiders produce silks, and a single spider can produce up to seven different types of silk for different uses.&lt;ref name="Foelix 96"&gt;{{cite book|author=Foelix, R. F. |title= Biology of Spiders |date= 1996 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford, N.Y |page= 330 |editor= Series Editor}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to insect silks, where an individual usually only produces one type of silk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19728833 |date=2010 |last1=Sutherland |first1=TD |last2=Young |first2=JH |last3=Weisman |first3=S |last4=Hayashi |first4=CY |last5=Merritt |first5=DJ |title=Insect silk: One name, many materials |volume=55 |pages=171–88 |doi=10.1146/annurev-ento-112408-085401 |journal=Annual Review of Entomology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spider silks may be used in many different ecological ways, each with properties to match the silk's function. As spiders have evolved, so has their silks' complexity and diverse uses, for example from primitive tube webs 300–400 million years ago to complex orb webs 110 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Hillyard 07"&gt;{{cite book|author= Hillyard, P. |title= The Private Life of Spiders |date= 2007 |publisher= New Holland |location= London |isbn= 978-1-84537-690-1 |page= 160 |editor= Series Editor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Nest lining and nest construction
| Tube webs used by "primitive" spiders such as the European tube web spider (''[[Segestria florentina]]''). Threads radiate out of nest to provide a sensory link to the outside. Silk is a component of the lids of spiders that use "trapdoors", such as members of the family [[Ctenizidae]], and the "water" or "diving bell" spider ''[[Argyroneta aquatica]]'' builds its diving bell of silk.

|- valign="top"
|Drop lines and anchor lines
| Many spiders, such as the [[Salticidae]], that venture from shelter and leave a trail of silk, use that as an emergency line in case of falling from inverted or vertical surfaces. Many others, even web dwellers, will deliberately drop from a web when alarmed, using a silken thread as a drop line by which they can return in due course. Some, such as species of ''Paramystaria'', also will hang from a drop line when feeding.
| &lt;ref name="ISBN 978-0-7993-4689-3"/&gt;
|- valign="top"
|Alarm lines
| Some spiders that do not spin actual trap webs do lay out alarm webs that the feet of their prey (such as ants) can disturb, cueing the spider to rush out and secure the meal if it is small enough, or to avoid contact if the intruder seems too formidable.
| &lt;ref name="ISBN 978-0-7993-4689-3"/&gt;
|- valign="top"
|Pheromonal trails
| Some wandering spiders will leave a largely continuous trail of silk impregnated with pheromones that the opposite sex can follow to find a mate.
| &lt;ref name="ISBN 978-0-7993-4689-3"/&gt;
|}

===Types===
Meeting the specification for all these ecological uses requires different types of silk suited to different broad properties, as either a fibre, a structure of fibres, or a silk-globule. These types include glues and fibres. Some types of fibres are used for structural support, others for constructing protective structures. Some can absorb energy effectively, whereas others transmit vibration efficiently. In a spider, these silk types are produced in different glands; so the silk from a particular gland can be linked to its use by the spider.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Gland
! Silk Use
|-
| Ampullate (major)
| Dragline silk—used for the web's outer rim and spokes, also for the lifeline and for ballooning.
|-
| Ampullate (minor)
|Used for temporary scaffolding during web construction.
|-
| Flagelliform
| Capture-spiral silk—used for the capturing lines of the web.
|-
| Tubuliform
| Egg cocoon silk—used for protective egg sacs.
|-
| Aciniform
| Used to wrap and secure freshly captured prey; used in the male sperm webs; used in stabilimenta.
|-
| Aggregate
| A silk glue of sticky globules.
|-
| Piriform
| Used to form bonds between separate threads for attachment points.

==Properties==

===Mechanical properties===
Each spider and each type of silk has a set of mechanical properties optimised for their biological function.

Most silks, in particular dragline silk, have exceptional mechanical properties. They exhibit a unique combination of high [[tensile strength]] and extensibility ([[ductility]]). This enables a silk fibre to absorb a large amount of energy before breaking ([[toughness]], the [[Integral|area under]] a stress-strain curve).

[[File:Wikipedia Kevlar Silk Comparison.jpg|right|thumb|280px| An illustration of the differences between toughness, stiffness and strength]]
A frequent mistake made in the mainstream media is to confuse strength and toughness, when comparing silk to other materials.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Weight for weight, silk is stronger than steel, but not as strong as [[Kevlar]]. Silk is, however, tougher than either.

The variability of mechanical properties of spider silk fibres may be important and it is related to their degree of molecular alignment.&lt;ref name="guinea 05"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Guinea, G.V.|author2= Elices, M.|author3= Pérez-Rigueiro, J.|author4= Plaza, G.R.|last-author-amp= yes |date= 2005 |title= Stretching of supercontracted fibers: a link between spinning and the variability of spider silk |journal= [[Journal of Experimental Biology]] |volume= 208 |pages= 25–30 |doi=10.1242/jeb.01344 |issue= 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical properties depend strongly on the ambient conditions, i.e. humidity and temperature.&lt;ref name="plaza 06"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2006JPoSB..44..994P |title=Thermo-hygro-mechanical behavior of spider dragline silk: Glassy and rubbery states |last1=Plaza |first1=Gustavo R. |last4=Elices |volume=44 |date=2006 |pages=994–999 |journal=Journal of Polymer Science Part B: Polymer Physics |doi=10.1002/polb.20751 |first2=Gustavo V. |first3=José |first4=Manuel |issue=6 |last2=Guinea |last3=Pérez-Rigueiro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dragline silk's [[tensile strength]] is comparable to that of high-grade alloy [[steel]] (450−2000 MPa),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00551703 |title=The strength of spider silk |date=1980 |last1=Griffiths |first1=J.

====Density====
Consisting of mainly protein, silks are about a sixth of the density of steel (1.3 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). As a result, a strand long enough to circle the Earth would weigh less than {{convert|500|g}}. (Spider dragline silk has a tensile strength of roughly 1.3&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|GPa]]. The tensile strength listed for steel might be slightly higher—e.g. 1.65&amp;nbsp;GPa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/pganio/materials.html |title=Material Tensile Strength Comparison |last1=Ganio Mego |first1=Paolo |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026041350/http://geocities.com/pganio/materials.html|archivedate=26 October 2009 |date=c. 2002|accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2002Natur.418..741S |title=Materials: Surprising strength of silkworm silk |last1=Shao |first1=Zhengzhong |last2=Vollrath |volume=418 |date=2002 |pages=741 |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/418741a |pmid=12181556 |first2=F |issue=6899}}&lt;/ref&gt; but spider silk is a much less dense material, so that a given weight of spider silk is five times as strong as the same weight of steel.)

=====Energy density=====

The [[energy density]] of dragline spider silk is roughly {{val|1.2|e=8|u=J/m3}}.&lt;ref name="Vollrath 01"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2005EPJE...16..199P |title=Predicting the mechanical properties of spider silk as a model nanostructured polymer |last1=Porter |first1=D. |last3=Shao |volume=16 |date=2005 |pages=199–206 |journal=European Physical Journal E |doi=10.1140/epje/e2005-00021-2 |first2=F. |first3=Z. |issue=2 |last2=Vollrath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Extensibility====
Silks are also extremely [[ductile]], with some able to stretch up to five times their relaxed length without breaking.

====Toughness====
The combination of strength and ductility gives dragline silks a very high [[toughness]] (or work to fracture), which "equals that of commercial [[polyaramid]] ([[aromatic nylon]]) filaments, which themselves are benchmarks of modern polymer fibre technology".&lt;ref name="Vollrath 410" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/spider/page2.htm |title=Spider Silk |publisher=www.chm.bris.ac.uk |accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Temperature====
While unlikely to be relevant in nature, dragline silks can hold their strength below −40&amp;nbsp;°C (−40&amp;nbsp;°F) and up to 220&amp;nbsp;°C (428&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/adma.200400344 |title=Toughness of Spider Silk at High and Low Temperatures |date=2005 |last1=Yang |first1=Y. |last2=Chen |first2=X. |last3=Shao |first3=Z. |last4=Zhou |first4=P. |last5=Porter |first5=D. |last6=Knight |first6=D. P. |last7=Vollrath |first7=F. |journal=Advanced Materials |volume=17 |pages=84–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; As occurs in many materials, spider silk fibres undergo a [[glass transition]]. The glass-transition temperature depends on the humidity, as water is a [[plasticiser]] for the silk.&lt;ref name="plaza 06"/&gt;

====Supercontraction====
When exposed to water, dragline silks undergo supercontraction, shrinking up to 50% in length and behaving like a weak rubber under tension.&lt;ref name="plaza 06"/&gt; Many hypotheses have been suggested as to its use in nature, with the most popular being to automatically tension webs built in the night using the morning dew.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

====Highest-performance====
The toughest known spider silk is produced by the species [[Darwin's bark spider]] (''Caerostris darwini''): "The toughness of forcibly silked fibers averages 350 [[Toughness#Unit of toughness|MJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]], with some samples reaching 520 MJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, ''C. darwini'' silk is more than twice as tough as any previously described silk, and over 10 times tougher than Kevlar".&lt;ref name="Agnarsson 10"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2010PLoSO...511234A |title=Bioprospecting Finds the Toughest Biological Material: Extraordinary Silk from a Giant Riverine Orb Spider |last1=Agnarsson |first1=Ingi |last2=Kuntner |last3=Blackledge |volume=5 |date=2010 |pages=11234 |journal=PLoS ONE |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0011234 |editor1-last=Lalueza-Fox |editor1-first=Carles |first2=Matjaž |first3=Todd A. |issue=9 |pmid=20856804 |pmc=2939878}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adhesive properties===

Silk fibre is a two-compound [[wikt:pyriform|pyriform]] secretion, spun into patterns (called "attachment discs") that are employed to adhere silk threads to various surfaces using a minimum of silk substrate.&lt;ref name="wolff"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=25672841|year=2015|author1=Wolff|first1=J.

A.|last4=Dhinojwala|first4=A|doi=10.1038/ncomms2099|bibcode=2012NatCo...3E1106S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some adhesive properties of the silk resemble [[glue]], consisting of [[microfibrils]] and [[lipid]] enclosures.&lt;ref name=wolff/&gt;

===Types of silk===
Many species of spider have different [[spinneret (spider)|glands]] to produce silk with different properties for different purposes, including housing, [[spider web|web]] construction, defence, capturing and detaining [[prey]], egg protection, and mobility (gossamer for [[Ballooning (spider)|ballooning]], or for a strand allowing the spider to drop down as silk is extruded). Different specialised silks have evolved with properties suitable for different uses. For example, ''[[Argiope argentata]]'' has five different types of silk, each used for a different purpose:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/scin.2007.5591711509 |title=Taken for a spin: Scientists look to spiders for the goods on silk |date=2009 |last1=Cunningham |first1=Aimee |journal=Science News |volume=171 |issue=15 |pages=231–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16788028 |date=2006 |last1=Blackledge |first1=TA |last2=Hayashi |first2=CY |title=Silken toolkits: Biomechanics of silk fibers spun by the orb web spider Argiope argentata (Fabricius 1775) |volume=209 |issue=Pt 13 |pages=2452–61 |doi=10.1242/jeb.02275 |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural==

===Macroscopic structure down to protein hierarchy===
[[File:Structure of spider silk thread Modified.svg|thumb|right|280px| Structure of spider silk. Inside a typical fibre there are crystalline regions separated by amorphous linkages. The crystals are beta-sheets that have assembled together.]]

Silks, like many other biomaterials, have a hierarchical structure. The [[primary structure]] is its [[amino acid]] sequence, mainly consisting of highly repetitive glycine and alanine blocks,&lt;ref name="Hinman 92"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hinman, M.

On a secondary structure level, the short side chained alanine is mainly found in the crystalline domains ([[beta sheet]]s) of the nanofibril, glycine is mostly found in the so-called amorphous matrix consisting of helical and beta turn structures.&lt;ref name="Simmons 96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="van Beek 02"&gt;{{cite journal |author= van Beek, J.

[[Pyrrolidine]] has hygroscopic properties which keeps the silk moist while also warding off ant invasion. It occurs in especially high concentration in glue threads. [[Potassium]] [[hydrogen phosphate]] releases [[proton]]s in aqueous solution, resulting in a [[pH]] of about 4, making the silk [[acid]]ic and thus protecting it from [[fungi]] and [[bacteria]] that would otherwise digest the protein. [[Potassium nitrate]] is believed to prevent the protein from denaturing in the acidic milieu.&lt;ref name=Heimer&gt;Heimer, S. (1988). Wunderbare Welt der Spinnen. ''Urania''. p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been possible to relate microstructural information and macroscopic mechanical properties of the fibres.&lt;ref name="plaza 12"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Plaza, G.R.|author2= Pérez-Rigueiro, J.|author3= Riekel, C.|author4= Perea, G.B.|author5= Agulló-Rueda, F.|author6= Burghammer, M.|author7=  Guinea, G.V.|author8= Elices, M.|date= 2012 |title= Relationship between microstructure and mechanical properties in spider silk fibers: identification of two regimes in the microstructural changes |journal= Soft Matter |volume=8 |pages= 6015–6026 |doi= 10.1039/C2SM25446H |issue= 22|bibcode= 2012SMat....8.6015P}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results show that ordered regions (i) mainly reorient by deformation for low-stretched fibres and (ii) the fraction of ordered regions increases progressively for higher stretching of the fibres.

The red lines represent the dragline, radial line, and frame lines, the blue lines represent the spiral line, and the centre of the orb web is called the “hub”.  Sticky balls drawn in blue are made at equal intervals on the spiral line with viscous material secreted from the aggregate gland.  Attachment cement secreted from the piriform gland is used to connect and fix different lines.  Microscopically, the spider silk secondary structure is formed of fibroin and is said to have the structure shown on the right side. In the dragline and radial line, a crystalline β-sheet and an amorphous helical structure are interwoven.  The large amount of β-spiral structure gives elastic properties to the capture part of the orb web.  In the structural modules diagram, a microscopic structure of dragline and radial lines is shown, composed mainly of two proteins of MaSp1 and MaSp2, as shown in the upper central part.  In the spiral line, there is no crystalline β-sheet region.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Non-protein composition===
Various compounds other than protein are found in spider silks, such as sugars, lipids, ions, and pigments that might affect the aggregation behaviour and act as a protection layer in the final fibre.&lt;ref name="Vollrath 01"/&gt;

==Biosynthesis and fibre spinning==

The production of silks, including spider silk, differs in an important aspect from the production of most other fibrous biological materials: rather than being continuously grown as keratin in hair, cellulose in the cell walls of plants, or even the fibres formed from the compacted faecal matter of beetles;&lt;ref name="Vollrath 01"/&gt; it is "spun" on demand from liquid silk precursor out of specialised glands.&lt;ref name="ander"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=27517908|pmc=5000687|year=2016|author1=Andersson|first1=M|title=Silk Spinning in Silkworms and Spiders|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=17|issue=8|pages=1290|last2=Johansson|first2=J|last3=Rising|first3=A|doi=10.3390/ijms17081290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spinning process occurs when a fibre is pulled away from the body of a spider, whether by the spider's legs, by the spider's falling under its own weight, or by any other method including being pulled by humans. The term "spinning" is misleading because no rotation of any component occurs, but rather comes from analogy to the textile [[spinning wheel]]s. Silk production is a [[pultrusion]],&lt;ref name="Wilson69"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Wilson, R. S. |date= 1969 |title= control of drag-line spinning in certain spiders |journal= Am. Zool. |volume= 9 |pages= 103–&amp; |doi=10.1093/icb/9.1.103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to extrusion, with the subtlety that the force is induced by pulling at the finished fibre rather than being squeezed out of a reservoir. The unspun silk fibre is pulled through silk [[gland]]s of which there may be both numerous duplicates and different types of gland on any one spider species.&lt;ref name=ander/&gt;

===Silk gland===
The gland's visible, or external, part is termed the [[spinneret (spider)|spinneret]]. Depending on the complexity of the species, spiders will have two to eight spinnerets, usually in pairs. There exist highly different specialised glands in different spiders, ranging from simply a sac with an opening at one end, to the complex, multiple-section major ampullate glands of the [[golden silk orb-weaver]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Dicko, C.|author2= Porter, D.|author3= Bond, J.|author4= Kenney, J. M.|author5= Vollratht, F.|last-author-amp= yes |date= 2008 |title= Structural disorder in silk proteins reveals the emergence of elastomericity |journal= Biomacromolecules |volume= 9 |pages= 216–221 |doi= 10.1021/bm701069y |pmid= 18078324 |issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind each spinneret visible on the surface of the spider lies a gland, a generalised form of which is shown in the figure to the right, "Schematic of a generalised gland".

Gland characteristics

# The first section of the gland labelled 1 on Figure 1 is the secretory or tail section of the gland. The walls of this section are lined with cells that secrete proteins Spidroin I and Spidroin II, the main components of this spider's dragline. These proteins are found in the form of droplets that gradually elongate to form long channels along the length of the final fibre, hypothesised to assist in preventing crack formation or even self-healing of the fibre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Heinhorst, S.|author2= Cannon, G. |date= 2002 |title= Nature: Self-Healing Polymers and Other Improved Materials |journal=J. Chem. Educ. |volume= 79 |page= 10 |doi=10.1021/ed079p10|bibcode = 2002JChEd..79...10H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The second section is the storage sac. This stores and maintains the gel-like unspun silk dope until it is required by the spider. In addition to storing the unspun silk gel, it secretes proteins that coat the surface of the final fibre.&lt;ref name="Vollrath 410"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vollrath, F.|author2=Knight, D.

# The funnel rapidly reduces the large diameter of the storage sac to the small diameter of the tapering duct.
# The final length is the tapering duct, the site of most of the fibre formation. This consists of a tapering tube with several tight about turns, a valve almost at the end (mentioned in detail at point No. 5 below) ending in a spigot from which the solid silk fibre emerges. The tube here tapers hyperbolically, therefore the unspun silk is under constant elongational shear stress, which is an important factor in fibre formation. This section of the duct is lined with cells that exchange ions, reduce the dope pH from neutral to acidic, and remove water from the fibre.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knight|first=D.

The spigot at the end has lips that clamp around the fibre, controlling fibre diameter and further retaining water.

==Artificial synthesis==
[[File:Artificial Spider Silk Strand.JPG|thumb|Single strand of artificial spider silk produced under laboratory conditions.]]In order to artificially synthesise spider silk into fibres, there are two broad areas that must be covered. These are synthesis of the feedstock (the unspun silk dope in spiders), and synthesis of the spinning conditions (the funnel, valve, tapering duct, and spigot). There have been a number of different approaches.

===Feedstock===
The molecular structure of unspun silk is both complex and extremely long. Though this endows the silk fibres with their desirable properties, it also makes replication of the fibre somewhat of a challenge. Various organisms have been used as a basis for attempts to replicate some components or all of some or all of the proteins involved. These proteins must then be extracted, purified and then spun before their properties can be tested.

|}

===Geometry===
Spider silks with comparatively simple molecular structure need complex ducts to be able to spin an effective fibre. There have been a number of methods used to produce fibres, of which the main types are briefly discussed below.

====Syringe and needle====
Feedstock is simply forced through a hollow needle using a syringe. This method has been shown to make fibres successfully on multiple occasions.&lt;ref name="Lazaris 02"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Lazaris, A.|date= 2002 |title= Spider silk fibers spun from soluble recombinant silk produced in mammalian cells |journal= Science |volume= 295 |pages= 472–476. |doi=10.1126/science.1065780 |pmid=11799236|bibcode = 2002Sci...295..472L |issue= 5554 |first2= S |first3= Y |first4= JF |first5= F |first6= N |first7= EA |first8= JW |first9= CN  |author2= Arcidiacono, S |author3= Huang, Y |author4= Zhou, J. F. |author5= Duguay, F |author6= Chretien, N |author7= Welsh, E. A. |author8= Soares, J. W. |author9= Karatzas, C. N. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seidel 00"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Seidel, A.|date= 2000 |title= Regenerated spider silk: Processing, properties, and structure |journal= Macromolecules |volume= 33 |pages= 775–780 |doi=10.1021/ma990893j |bibcode = 2000MaMol..33..775S |first2= Oskar |last3= Calve |first3= Sarah |last4= Adaska |first4= Jason |last5= Ji |first5= Gending |last6= Yang |first6= Zhitong |last7= Grubb |first7= David |last8= Zax |first8= David B. |last9= Jelinski |first9= Lynn W. |issue= 3 |last2= Liivak  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although very cheap and easy to assemble, the shape and conditions of the gland are very loosely approximated. Fibres created using this method may need encouragement to change from liquid to solid by removing the water from the fibre with such chemicals as the environmentally undesirable [[methanol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Arcidiacono, S.|date= 2002 |title= Aqueous processing and fiber spinning of recombinant spider silks |journal= Macromolecules |volume= 35 |pages= 1262–1266 |doi=10.1021/ma011471o |bibcode = 2002MaMol..35.1262A |first2= Charlene M. |last3= Butler |first3= Michelle |last4= Welsh |first4= Elizabeth |last5= Soares |first5= Jason W. |last6= Allen |first6= Alfred |last7= Ziegler |first7= David |last8= Laue |first8= Thomas |last9= Chase |first9= Susan |issue= 4 |last2= Mello  }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[acetone]],&lt;ref name="Seidel 00"/&gt; and also may require post-stretching of the fibre to attain fibres with desirable properties.&lt;ref name="Xia 10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lazaris 02"/&gt;

====Microfluidics====
As the field of [[microfluidics]] matures, it is likely that more attempts to spin fibres will be made using microfluidics. These have the advantage of being very controllable and able to test spin very small volumes of unspun fibre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kinahan, M. E.|date= 2011 |title= Tunable Silk: Using Microfluidics to Fabricate Silk Fibers with Controllable Properties |journal= Biomacromolecules |volume= 12 |pages= 1504–1511 |doi= 10.1021/bm1014624 |issue= 5 |pmid= 21438624 |pmc= 3305786|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Rammensee, S.|author2= Slotta, U.|author3= Scheibel, T.|author4= Bausch, A.

A patent has been granted in this area for spinning fibres in a method mimicking the process found in nature, and fibres are successfully being continuously spun by a commercial company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spintec-engineering.de/spintec-engineering.de/Home.html Spintec Engineering GmbH] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electrospinning====
[[Electrospinning]] is a very old technique whereby a fluid is held in a container in a manner such that it is able to flow out through capillary action. A conducting substrate is positioned below, and a large difference in electrical potential is applied between the fluid and the substrate. The fluid is attracted to the substrate, and tiny fibres jump almost instantly from their point of emission, the [[Taylor cone]], to the substrate, drying as they travel. This method has been shown to create nano-scale fibres from both silk dissected from organisms and [[regenerated silk fibroin]].

===Other artificial shapes formed from silk===
Silk can be formed into other shapes and sizes such as spherical capsules for drug delivery, cell scaffolds and wound healing, textiles, cosmetics, coatings, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Eisoldt, L.|author2= Smith, A.|author3= Scheibel, T.|last-author-amp= yes |date= 2011 |title= Decoding the secrets of spider silk |journal= Mater.

==Attempts at producing synthetic spider silk==
Replicating the complex conditions required to produce fibres that are comparable to spider silk has proven difficult in research and early-stage manufacturing. Through [[genetic engineering]], ''Escherichia coli'' bacteria, yeasts, plants, silkworms, and animals have been used to produce spider silk proteins, which have different, simpler characteristics than those from a spider.&lt;ref name=service/&gt; Artificial spider silks have fewer and simpler proteins than natural dragline silk, and are consequently half the diameter, strength, and flexibility of natural dragline silk.&lt;ref name=service/&gt;

* One approach is to extract the spider silk [[gene]] and use other organisms to produce the spider silk. Working under the trademark [[BioSteel]], Canadian [[biotechnology]] company Nexia successfully produced spider silk protein in [[transgenic]] [[goat]]s that carried the gene for it; the milk produced by the goats contained significant quantities of the protein, 1–2&amp;nbsp;grams of silk proteins per litre of milk. Attempts to spin the protein into a fibre similar to natural spider silk resulted in fibres with tenacities of 2–3&amp;nbsp;grams per [[Denier (measure)|denier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kluge |first1=Jonathan A. |last2=Rabotyagova |first2=Olena |last3=Leisk |first3=Gary G. |last4=Kaplan |first4=David L. |date=May 2008 |title=Spider silks and their applications |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Biotechnology]] |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=244–251 |doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2008.02.006 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167779908000796 |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nexia used wet spinning and squeezed the silk protein solution through small extrusion holes in order to simulate the behavior of the spinneret, but this procedure was not sufficient to replicate the stronger properties of native spider silk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Scheibel |first1=Thomas |date=November 2004 |title=Spider silks: recombinant synthesis, assembly, spinning, and engineering of synthetic proteins |journal=Microbial Cell Factories |volume=3 |page=14 |doi=10.1186/1475-2859-3-14 |pmid=15546497 |pmc=534800 |url=http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/3/1/14 |accessdate=3 January 2012 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Extrusion of protein fibres in an aqueous environment is known as "wet-spinning". This process has so far produced silk fibres of diameters ranging from 10 to 60&amp;nbsp;μm, compared to diameters of 2.5–4&amp;nbsp;μm for natural spider silk.
* In March 2010, researchers from the [[Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology]] succeeded in making spider silk directly using the bacteria ''E. coli'', modified with certain genes of the spider [[Nephila clavipes]]. This approach eliminates the need to milk spiders and allows the manufacture the spider silk in a more cost-effective manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2010PNAS..10714059X |first1=Xiao-Xia |last1=Xia |first2=Zhi-Gang |last2=Qian |first3=Chang Seok |last3=Ki |first4=Young Hwan |last4=Park |first5=David L. |last5=Kaplan |first6=Sang Yup |last6=Lee |title=Native-sized recombinant spider silk protein produced in metabolically engineered ''Escherichia coli'' results in a strong fiber |jstor=25708855 |volume=107 |date=2010 |pages=14059–14063 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |doi=10.1073/pnas.1003366107 |issue=32 |pmid=20660779 |pmc=2922564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ozone and temperature ==

The mechanism describing the formation of the ozone layer was described by British mathematician [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] in 1930. Molecular oxygen absorbs high energy sunlight in the UV-C region, at wavelengths shorter than about 240&amp;nbsp;nm. Radicals produced from the homolytically split oxygen molecules combine with molecular oxygen to form ozone. Ozone in turn is photolysed much more rapidly than molecular oxygen as it has a stronger absorption that occurs at longer wavelengths, where the solar emission is more intense. Ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) photolysis produces O and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The oxygen atom product combines with atmospheric molecular oxygen to reform O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, releasing heat. The rapid photolysis and reformation of ozone heats the stratosphere resulting in a temperature inversion. This increase of temperature with altitude is characteristic of the stratosphere; its resistance to vertical mixing means that it is stratified. Within the stratosphere temperatures increase with  altitude ''(see [[temperature inversion]])''; the top of the stratosphere has a temperature of about 270 [[Kelvin|K]] (−3[[°C]] or 26.6[[°F]]).&lt;ref&gt;Seinfeld, J. H., and S. N.(2006), Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics: From Air Pollution to Climate Change 2nd ed, Wiley, New Jersey&lt;/ref&gt; This vertical [[Atmospheric stratification|stratification]], with warmer layers above and cooler layers below, makes the stratosphere dynamically stable: there is no regular [[convection]] and associated [[turbulence]] in this part of the atmosphere. However, exceptionally energetic convection processes, such as volcanic [[eruption column]]s and [[overshooting top]]s in severe [[Supercell|supercell thunderstorms]], may carry convection into the stratosphere on a very local and temporary basis. Overall the attenuation of solar UV at wavelengths that damage DNA by the ozone layer allows life to exist on the surface of the planet outside of the ocean. All air entering the stratosphere must pass through the tropopause, the temperature minimum that divides the troposphere and stratosphere. The rising air is literally freeze dried; the stratosphere is a very dry place. The top of the stratosphere is called the [[stratopause]], above which the temperature decreases with height.

Sydney Chapman gave a correct description of the source of stratospheric ozone and its ability to generate heat within the stratosphere; he also wrote that ozone may be destroyed by reacting with atomic oxygen, making two molecules of molecular oxygen. We now know that there are additional ozone loss mechanisms, and that these mechanisms are catalytic meaning that a small amount of the catalyst can destroy a great number of ozone molecules. The first is due to the reaction of hydroxyl radicals OH'''·''' with ozone. OH is formed by the reaction of electronically excited oxygen atoms produced by ozone photolysis, with water vapor. While the stratosphere is dry, additional water vapor is produced in situ by the photochemical oxidation of [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; radical produced by the reaction of OH with O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is recycled to OH by reaction with oxygen atoms or ozone. In addition, solar proton events can significantly affect ozone levels via [[radiolysis]] with the subsequent formation of OH . Laughing gas or [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is produced by biological activity at the surface and is oxidised to NO in the stratosphere; the so-called NOx radical cycles also deplete stratospheric ozone. Finally, [[chlorofluorocarbon]] molecules are photolysed in the stratosphere releasing chlorine atoms that react with ozone giving ClO and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The chlorine atoms are recycled when ClO reacts with O in the upper stratosphere, or when ClO reacts with itself in the chemistry of the Antarctic ozone hole.

Paul J. Crutzen, Mario J. Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1995 for their work describing the formation and decomposition of stratospheric ozone.

== Aircraft flight ==

Commercial [[airliner]]s typically cruise at altitudes of {{convert|9|–|12|km|ft|abbr=on}} which is in the lower reaches of the stratosphere in temperate latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/DanielCheng.shtml |title=Altitude of a Commercial Jet |publisher=Hypertextbook.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031180259/http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/DanielCheng.shtml |archivedate=2011-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This optimizes [[fuel efficiency]], mostly due to the low temperatures encountered near the tropopause and low air density, reducing [[parasitic drag]] on the [[airframe]]. Stated another way, it allows the airliner to fly faster while maintaining lift equal to the weight of the plane. (The fuel consumption depends on the drag, which is related to the lift by the [[lift-to-drag ratio]].) It also allows the airplane to stay above the [[turbulence|turbulent]] weather of the troposphere.

The [[Concorde]] aircraft cruised at mach 2 at about {{convert|18000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the [[SR-71]] cruised at mach 3 at {{convert|26000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, all within the stratosphere.

Because the temperature in the tropopause and lower stratosphere is largely constant with increasing altitude, very little convection and its resultant turbulence occurs there. Most turbulence at this altitude is caused by variations in the [[jet stream]] and other local wind shears, although areas of significant convective activity ([[thunderstorm]]s) in the troposphere below may produce turbulence as a result of  [[convective overshoot]].

On October 24, 2014, [[Alan Eustace]] became the record holder for reaching the altitude record for a manned balloon at {{convert|135,890|ft|sigfig=5|abbr=on}}. Dr Eustace also broke the world records for vertical speed skydiving, reached with a peak velocity of 1,321&amp;nbsp;km/h (822&amp;nbsp;mph) and total freefall distance of {{convert|123,414|ft|sigfig=5|abbr=on}} – lasting four minutes and 27 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29766189|title=Google's Alan Eustace beats Baumgartner's skydiving record|work=BBC News|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025121736/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29766189|archivedate=2014-10-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Circulation and mixing ==
The stratosphere is a region of intense interactions among radiative, [[dynamical]], and chemical processes, in which the horizontal mixing of gaseous components proceeds much more rapidly than does vertical mixing. The overall circulation of the stratosphere is termed as [[Brewer-Dobson circulation]], which is a single celled circulation, spanning from the tropics up to the poles, consisting of the tropical upwelling of air from the tropical troposphere and the extra-tropical downwelling of air. Stratospheric Circulation is a pre-dominantly wave-driven circulation in that the tropical upwelling is induced by the wave force by the westward propagating [[Rossby Waves]], in a phenomenon called Rossby-Wave pumping.

An interesting feature of stratospheric circulation is the [[quasi-biennial oscillation|QBO]] in the tropical latitudes, which is driven by [[gravity wave]]s that are convectively generated in the [[troposphere]]. The QBO induces a [[secondary circulation]] that is important for the global stratospheric transport of tracers, such as [[ozone]]&lt;ref&gt;N.Butchart, A.A. Scaife, J. Austin, S.H.E. Hare, J.R. Knight. ''[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2002JD003004/abstract Quasi-biennial oscillation in ozone in a coupled chemistry-climate model] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518230712/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2002JD003004/abstract |date=2014-05-18 }}'', Journal of Geophysical Research.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[water vapor]].

Another large-scale feature that significantly influences Stratospheric Circulation is the breaking planetary waves&lt;ref&gt;M.E. McIntyre, T.N. Palmer. ''[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v305/n5935/abs/305593a0.html Breaking planetary waves in the stratosphere] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317055813/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v305/n5935/abs/305593a0.html |date=2017-03-17 }}'', Nature.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in intense quasi-horizontal mixing in the midlatitudes. This breaking is much more pronounced in the winter hemisphere where this region is called the surf zone. This breaking is caused due to a highly non-linear interaction between the vertically propagating planetary waves and the isolated high [[potential vorticity]] region known as Polar Vortex. The resultant breaking causes large scale mixing of air and other trace gases throughout the midlatitude surf zone. The timescale of this rapid mixing is much smaller than the much slower timescales of upwelling in the tropics and downwelling in the extratropics.

During northern hemispheric winters, [[sudden stratospheric warmings]], caused by the absorption of [[Rossby wave]]s in the stratosphere, can be observed in approximately half of winters when easterly winds develop in the stratosphere. These events often precede unusual winter weather &lt;ref&gt;M.P. Baldwin and T.J. Dunkerton. '[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/294/5542/581.short Stratospheric Harbingers of Anomalous Weather Regimes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112084150/http://www.sciencemag.org/content/294/5542/581.short |date=2014-01-12 }}'', Science Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; and may even be responsible for the cold European winters of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;A.A. Scaife, J.R. Knight, G.K. Vallis, C.K. Folland. ''[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2005GL023226/abstract A stratospheric influence on the winter NAO and North Atlantic surface climate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518230707/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2005GL023226/abstract |date=2014-05-18 }}'', Geophysical Research Letters.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stratospheric warming of the [[polar vortex]] results in its weakening. When the vortex is strong, it keeps the cold, high pressure air masses ''contained'' in the [[arctic]]; when the vortex weakens, air masses move equatorward, and results in rapid changes of weather in the mid latitudes.

== Discovery ==
In 1902 [[Léon Teisserenc de Bort]] from France and [[Richard Assmann]] from Germany, in separate but coordinated publications and following years of observations, published the discovery of an isothermal layer at around 11–14&amp;nbsp;km, which is the base of the lower stratosphere. This was based on temperature profiles from mostly unmanned and a few manned instrumented balloons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Steinhagen |first=Hans |title=Der Wettermann - Leben und Werk Richard Aßmanns |place=Neuenhagen, Germany |publisher=Findling |year=2005 |isbn=3-933603-33-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8520">In an [[alternating current]] electric power system, '''synchronization''' is the process of matching the speed and frequency of a generator or other source to a running network. An AC generator cannot deliver power to an electrical grid unless it is running at the same [[Utility frequency|frequency]] as the network.  If two segments of a grid are disconnected, they cannot exchange AC power again until they are brought back into exact synchronization.

A [[Direct Current|direct current]] (DC) generator can be connected to a power network by adjusting its open-circuit terminal voltage to match the network voltage, by either adjusting its speed or its field excitation. The exact engine speed is not critical. However, an AC generator must match both the amplitude and the timing of the network voltage, which requires both speed and excitation to be systematically controlled for synchronization. This extra complexity was one of the arguments against AC operation during the [[War of Currents]] in the 1880s. In modern grids, synchronization of generators is carried out by automatic systems.

==Conditions==
There are five conditions that must be met before the synchronization process takes place. The source (generator or sub-network) must have equal [[voltage|line voltage]], [[Utility frequency|frequency]], [[phase sequence]], [[phase (waves)|phase angle]], and [[waveform]] to that of the system to which it is being synchronized.&lt;ref name="soft"&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6175812 Soft synchronization of dispersed generators to micro grids for smart grid applications]&lt;/ref&gt;

Waveform and phase sequence are fixed by the construction of the generator and its connections to the system. During installation of a generator, careful checks are made to ensure the generator terminals and all control wiring is correct so that the order of phases (phase sequence) matches the system. Connecting a generator with the wrong phase sequence will result in a short circuit as the system voltages are opposite to those of the generator terminal voltages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terrell Croft]] and Wilford Summers (ed), ''American Electricans' Handbook, Eleventh Edition'', McGraw Hill, New York (1987) {{ISBN|0-07-013932-6}} pages 7-45 through 7-49&lt;/ref&gt;

The voltage, frequency and phase angle must be controlled each time a generator is to be connected to a grid.&lt;ref name="soft" /&gt;

Generating units for connection to a power grid have an inherent [[droop speed control]] that allows them to share load proportional to their rating. Some generator units, especially in isolated systems, operate with isochronous frequency control, maintaining constant system frequency independent of load.

==Process==

The sequence of events is similar for manual or automatic synchronization.  The generator is brought up to approximate synchronous speed by supplying more energy to its shaft - for example, opening the valves on a [[steam turbine]], opening the gates on a [[hydraulic turbine]], or increasing the [[fuel rack]] setting on a [[diesel engine]]. The field of the generator is energized and the voltage at the terminals of the generator is observed and compared with the system. The voltage magnitude must be the same as the system voltage.

If one machine is slightly out of phase it will pull into step with the others but, if the phase difference is large, there will be heavy cross-currents which can cause voltage fluctuations and, in extreme cases, damage to the machines.
[[File:Synchronoscope stack.jpg|thumb|upright| From top to bottom: [[synchroscope]], voltmeter, frequency meter. When the two systems are synchronized, the pointer on the synchrosope is stationary and points straight up. ]]

===Synchronizing lamps===
Formerly, three [[light bulb]]s were connected between the generator terminals and the system terminals (or more generally, to the terminals of instrument [[transformer]]s connected to generator and system). As the generator speed changes, the lights will flicker at the [[beat frequency]] proportional to the difference between generator frequency and system frequency. When the voltage at the generator is opposite to the system voltage (either ahead or behind in [[Phase (waves)|phase]]), the lamps will be bright. When the voltage at the generator matches the system voltage, the lights will be dark. At that instant, the [[circuit breaker]] connecting the generator to the system may be closed and the generator will then stay in synchronism with the system.&lt;ref&gt;Donald G. Fink and H. Wayne Beaty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition'', McGraw-Hill, New York, 1978, {{ISBN|0-07-020974-X}} pp. 3-64,3-65&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative technique used a similar scheme to the above except that the connections of two of the lamps were swapped either at the generator terminals or the system terminals.  In this scheme, when the generator was in synchronism with the system, one lamp would be dark, but the two with the swapped connections would be of equal brightness.  Synchronizing on "dark" lamps was preferred over "bright" lamps because it was easier to discern the minimum brightness.  However, a lamp burnout could give a false-positive for successful synchronization.

===Synchroscope===
{{main|Synchroscope}}
Another manual method of synchronization relies on observing an instrument called a "synchroscope", which displays the relative frequencies of system and generator. The pointer of the synchroscope will indicate "fast" or "slow" speed of the generator with respect to the system. To minimize the transient current when the generator circuit breaker is closed, usual practice is to initiate the close as the needle slowly approaches the in-phase point.  An error of a few electrical degrees between system and generator will result in a momentary inrush and abrupt speed change of the generator.

===Synchronizing relays===
Synchronizing [[relay]]s allow unattended synchronization of a machine with a system. Today these are digital microprocessor instruments, but in the past electromechanical relay systems were applied. A synchronizing relay is useful to remove human reaction time from the process, or when a human is not available such as at a remote controlled generating plant. Synchroscopes or lamps are sometimes installed as a supplement to automatic relays, for possible manual use or for monitoring the generating unit.

Sometimes as a precaution against out-of-step connection of a machine to a system, a "synchro check" relay is installed that prevents closing the generator [[circuit breaker]] unless the machine is within a few electrical degrees of being in-phase with the system. Synchro check relays are also applied in places where several sources of supply may be connected and where it is important that out-of-step sources are not accidentally paralleled.

==Synchronous operation==

While the generator is synchronized, the frequency of the system will change depending on load and the average characteristics of all the generating units connected to the grid.&lt;ref name="soft" /&gt; Large changes in system frequency can cause the generator to fall out of synchronism with the system. Protective devices on the generator will operate to disconnect it automatically.

==Synchronous speeds==

Synchronous speeds for synchronous motors and alternators depend on the number of poles on the machine and the frequency of the supply.

The relationship between the supply frequency, ''f'', the number of poles, ''p'', and the synchronous speed (speed of rotating field), ''n&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{pn_s}{120\ }&lt;/math&gt;.

In the following table, frequencies are shown in [[hertz]] (Hz) and rotational speeds in revolutions per minute (rpm):

}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus, it is also  known as '''Tolman's paradox'''.

A device capable of "telegraphing into the past" was later also called a "tachyonic antitelephone" by [[Gregory Benford]] et al. According to the current understanding of physics, no such faster-than-light transfer of information is actually possible.  For instance, the hypothetical [[tachyon]] particles which give the device its name do not exist even theoretically in the [[standard model of particle physics]], due to [[tachyon condensation]], and there is no experimental evidence that suggests that they might exist. The problem of detecting tachyons via causal contradictions was treated but without scientific verification.{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref name=ben&gt;

==One-way example==
[[File:Ehrenfest Starr3.png|300px|thumb|This was illustrated in 1911 by [[Paul Ehrenfest]] using a [[Minkowski diagram]]. Signals are sent in frame B1 into the opposite directions ''OP'' and ''ON'' with a velocity approaching infinity. Here, event ''O'' happens before ''N''. However, in another frame B2, event ''N'' happens before ''O''.&lt;ref name=Ehren&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ehrenfest, P. | title= Zu Herrn v. Ignatowskys Behandlung der Bornschen Starrheitsdefinition II|trans-title=[[s:Translation:On v. Ignatowsky's Treatment of Born's Definition of Rigidity II|On v. Ignatowsky's Treatment of Born's Definition of Rigidity II]]| journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift | year=1911 | volume=12 | pages=412–413}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Tolman used the following variation of Einstein's thought experiment:&lt;ref name=Einst /&gt;&lt;ref name=tol /&gt; Imagine a distance with endpoints &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Let a signal be sent from A propagating with velocity &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; towards B. All of this is measured in an inertial frame where the endpoints are at rest. The arrival at B is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t=t_{1}-t_{0}=\frac{B-A}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the event at A is the cause of the event at B. However, in the inertial frame moving with relative velocity ''v'', the time of arrival at B is given according to the [[Lorentz transformation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Delta t' &amp; =t'_{1}-t'_{0}=\frac{t_{1}-vB/c^{2}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}-\frac{t_{0}-vA/c^{2}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}\\
 &amp; =\frac{1-av/c^{2}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}\Delta t.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

It can be easily shown that if ''a &gt; c'', then certain values of ''v'' can make ''&amp;Delta;t' '' negative. In other words, the effect arises before the cause in this frame. Einstein (and similarly Tolman) concluded that this result contains in their view no logical contradiction; he said, however, it contradicts the totality of our experience so that the impossibility of ''a &gt; c'' seems to be sufficiently proven.&lt;ref name=Einst /&gt;

==Two-way example==
A more common variation of this thought experiment is to send back the signal to the sender (a similar one was given by [[David Bohm]]&lt;ref&gt;David Bohm, ''The Special Theory of Relativity'', New York: W.A. Benjamin., 1965&lt;/ref&gt;). Suppose [[Alice and Bob|Alice]] (A) is on a [[spacecraft]] moving away from the Earth in the positive x-direction with a speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, and she wants to communicate with Bob (B) back home.  Assume both of them have a device that is capable of transmitting and receiving faster-than-light signals at a speed of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;[[Speed of light|&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;]] with &lt;math&gt;a &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.  Alice uses this device to send a message to Bob, who sends a reply back.  Let us choose the origin of the coordinates of Bob's reference frame, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, to coincide with the reception of Alice's message to him. If Bob immediately sends a message back to Alice, then in his rest frame the coordinates of the reply signal (in [[natural units]] so that ''c''=1) are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;(t,x) = (t,at)&lt;/math&gt;

To find out when the reply is received by Alice, we perform a [[Lorentz transformation#Lorentz transformation for frames in standard configuration|Lorentz transformation]] to Alice's frame &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; moving in the positive x-direction with velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the Earth. In this frame Alice is at rest at position &lt;math&gt;x' = L&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the distance that the signal Alice sent to Earth traversed in her rest frame. The coordinates of the reply signal are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;t' = \gamma \left(1 - av\right) t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x' = \gamma \left(a -  v\right) t&lt;/math&gt;

The reply is received by Alice when &lt;math&gt;x' = L&lt;/math&gt;. This means that &lt;math&gt;t = \tfrac{L}{\gamma(a - v)}&lt;/math&gt; and thus:

:&lt;math&gt;t' = \frac{1 - av}{a - v}L&lt;/math&gt;

Since the message Alice sent to Bob took a time of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{L}{a}&lt;/math&gt; to reach him, the message she receives back from him will reach her at time:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{L}{a} + t' = \left(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1 - av}{a - v}\right)L&lt;/math&gt;

later than she sent her message. However, if &lt;math&gt;v &gt; \tfrac{2a}{1 + a^2}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;T &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and Alice will receive the message back from Bob before she sends her message to him in the first place.

==Numerical example with two-way communication==
As an example, imagine that Alice and Bob are aboard spaceships moving inertially with a relative speed of 0.8''c''. At some point they pass right next to each other, and Alice defines the position and time of their passing to be at position ''x'' = 0, time ''t'' = 0 in her frame, while Bob defines it to be at position ''x′'' = 0 and time ''t′'' = 0 in his frame (note that this is different from the convention used in the previous section, where the origin of the coordinates was the event of Bob receiving a tachyon signal from Alice). In Alice's frame she remains at rest at position ''x'' = 0, while Bob is moving in the positive ''x'' direction at 0.8''c''; in Bob's frame he remains at rest at position ''x′'' = 0, and Alice is moving in the negative ''x′'' direction at 0.8''c''. Each one also has a tachyon transmitter aboard their ship, which sends out signals that move at 2.4''c'' in the ship's own frame.

When Alice's clock shows that 300 days have elapsed since she passed next to Bob (''t'' = 300 days in her frame), she uses the tachyon transmitter to send a message to Bob, saying "Ugh, I just ate some bad shrimp". At ''t'' = 450 days in Alice's frame, she calculates that since the tachyon signal has been traveling away from her at 2.4''c'' for 150 days, it should now be at position x = 2.4×150 = 360 [[light-day]]s in her frame, and since Bob has been traveling away from her at 0.8''c'' for 450 days, he should now be at position ''x'' = 0.8×450 = 360 light-days in her frame as well, meaning that this is the moment the signal catches up with Bob. So, in her frame Bob receives Alice's message at ''x'' = 360, ''t'' = 450. Due to the effects of [[time dilation]], in her frame Bob is aging more slowly than she is by a factor of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{ \gamma} =  \sqrt{1 - { (v/c)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;, in this case 0.6, so Bob's clock only shows that 0.6×450 = 270 days have elapsed when he receives the message, meaning that in his frame he receives it at ''x′'' = 0, ''t′'' = 270.

When Bob receives Alice's message, he immediately uses his own tachyon transmitter to send a message back to Alice saying "Don't eat the shrimp!". 135 days later in his frame, at ''t′'' = 270 + 135 = 405, he calculates that since the tachyon signal has been traveling away from him at 2.4''c'' in the −''x′'' direction for 135 days, it should now be at position ''x′'' = −2.4×135 = −324 light-days in his frame, and since Alice has been traveling at 0.8''c'' in the −''x'' direction for 405 days, she should now be at position ''x′'' = −0.8×405 = −324 light-days as well. So, in his frame Alice receives his reply at ''x′'' = −324, ''t′'' = 405. Time dilation for inertial observers is symmetrical, so in Bob's frame Alice is aging more slowly than he is, by the same factor of 0.6, so Alice's clock should only show that 0.6×405 = 243 days have elapsed when she receives his reply. This means that she receives a message from Bob saying "Don't eat the shrimp!" only 243 days after she passed Bob, while she wasn't supposed to send the message saying "Ugh, I just ate some bad shrimp" until 300 days elapsed since she passed Bob, so Bob's reply constitutes a warning about her own future.

These numbers can be double-checked using the [[Lorentz transformation]]. The Lorentz transformation says that if we know the coordinates ''x'', ''t'' of some event in Alice's frame, the same event must have the following ''x′'', ''t′'' coordinates in Bob's frame:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
t' &amp;= \gamma \left( t - \frac{vx}{c^2} \right)  \\ 
x' &amp;= \gamma \left( x - v t \right)\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''v'' is Bob's speed along the ''x''-axis in Alice's frame, c is the speed of light (we are using units of days for time and light-days for distance, so in these units ''c'' = 1), and  &lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{1}{ \sqrt{1 - { (v/c)^2}}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lorentz factor]]. In this case ''v''=0.8''c'', and &lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{1}{0.6}&lt;/math&gt;. In Alice's frame, the event of Alice sending the message happens at ''x'' = 0, ''t'' = 300, and the event of Bob receiving Alice's message happens at ''x'' = 360, ''t'' = 450. Using the Lorentz transformation, we find that in Bob's frame the event of Alice sending the message happens at position ''x′'' = (1/0.6)×(0 − 0.8×300) = −400 light-days, and time ''t′'' = (1/0.6)×(300 − 0.8×0) = 500 days. Likewise, in Bob's frame the event of Bob receiving Alice's message happens at position ''x′'' = (1/0.6)×(360 − 0.8×450) = 0 light-days, and time ''t′'' = (1/0.6)×(450 − 0.8×360) = 270 days, which are the same coordinates for Bob's frame that were found in the earlier paragraph.

Comparing the coordinates in each frame, we see that in Alice's frame her tachyon signal moves forwards in time (she sent it at an earlier time than Bob received it), and between being sent and received we have (difference in position)/(difference in time) = 360/150 = 2.4''c''. In Bob's frame, Alice's signal moves back in time (he received it at ''t′'' = 270, but it was sent at ''t′'' = 500), and it has a (difference in position)/(difference in time) of 400/230, about 1.739''c''. The fact that the two frames disagree about the order of the events of the signal being sent and received is an example of the [[relativity of simultaneity]], a feature of relativity which has no analogue in classical physics, and which is key to understanding why in relativity FTL communication must necessarily lead to causality violation.

Bob is assumed to have sent his reply almost instantaneously after receiving Alice's message, so the coordinates of his sending the reply can be assumed to be the same: ''x'' = 360, ''t'' = 450 in Alice's frame, and ''x′'' = 0, ''t′'' = 270 in Bob's frame. If the event of Alice receiving Bob's reply happens at ''x′'' = 0, ''t′'' = 243 in her frame (as in the earlier paragraph), then according to the Lorentz transformation, in Bob's frame Alice receives his reply at position ''x′''' = (1/0.6)×(0 − 0.8×243) = −324 light-days, and at time ''t′'' = (1/0.6)×(243 − 0.8×0) = 405 days. So evidently Bob's reply does move forward in time in his own frame, since the time it was sent was ''t′'' = 270 and the time it was received was ''t′'' = 405. And in his frame (difference in position)/(difference in time) for his signal is 324/135 = 2.4''c'', exactly the same as the speed of Alice's original signal in her own frame. Likewise, in Alice's frame Bob's signal moves backwards in time (she received it before he sent it), and it has a (difference in position)/(difference in time) of 360/207, about 1.739''c''.

Thus the times of sending and receiving in each frame, as calculated using the Lorentz transformation, match up with the times given in earlier paragraphs, before we made explicit use of the Lorentz transformation. And by using the Lorentz transformation we can see that the two tachyon signals behave symmetrically in each observer's frame: the observer who sends a given signal measures it to move forward in time at 2.4''c'', the observer who receives it measures it to move back in time at 1.739''c''. This sort of possibility for symmetric tachyon signals is necessary if tachyons are to respect the first of the two [[postulates of special relativity]], which says that all laws of physics must work exactly the same in all inertial frames. This implies that if it's possible to send a signal at 2.4''c'' in one frame, it must be possible in any other frame as well, and likewise if one frame can observe a signal that moves backwards in time, any other frame must be able to observe such a phenomenon as well. This is another key idea in understanding why FTL communication leads to causality violation in relativity; if tachyons were allowed to have a "preferred frame" in violation of the first postulate of relativity, in that case it could theoretically be possible to avoid causality violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kowalczyński |first=Jerzy |date=January 1984 |title=Critical comments on the discussion about tachyonic causal paradoxes and on the concept of superluminal reference frame |journal=[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]] |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=27–60 |doi=10.1007/BF02080670 |bibcode = 1984IJTP...23...27K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paradoxes==
Benford et al.&lt;ref name=ben /&gt; wrote about such paradoxes in general, offering a scenario in which two parties are able to send a message two hours into the past:

{{Quote|The paradoxes of backward-in-time communication are well known. Suppose A and B enter into the following agreement: A will send a message at three o'clock if and only if he does ''not'' receive one at one o'clock. B sends a message to reach A at one o'clock immediately on receiving one from A at three o'clock. Then the exchange of messages will take place if and only if it does not take place. This is a genuine paradox, a causal contradiction.}}

They concluded that superluminal particles such as [[tachyon]]s are therefore not allowed to convey signals.

In recent decades, there have been various proposed ways{{By whom|date=January 2015}} to possibly remove such paradoxes, either by invoking the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]] or through the idea of branching timelines in the context of the [[many-worlds interpretation]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
