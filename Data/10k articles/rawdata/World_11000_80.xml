      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1774">The '''19th Infantry Division''' was a military formation of the [[Korean People's Army]].

It defended the Kumchon area north of [[Kaesong]] with the [[27th Division (North Korea)|27th Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/kw-unoff/unoff.htm |title=The Korean War: The UN Offensive |first=Stephen L.Y. |last=Gammons |id=CMH Pub 19-7 |publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115120025/http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/kw-unoff/unoff.htm |archivedate=2010-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] began attacking on October 9, 1950, along the main highway from Kaesong to Kumchon. The US [[8th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|8th Cavalry]] had to stop repeatedly and wait for engineer troops to clear mines from the road. Halfway to Kumchon on the twelfth the 8th Cavalry was halted by a North Korean strongpoint, defended by tanks, self-propelled guns, and antiaircraft weapons. In spite of a sixteen-plane air strike and a 155-mm howitzer barrage, the strongpoint held.

The US [[5th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|5th Cavalry]]'s 1st Battalion encountered the 19th and 27th Division's defenses on October 11 as they were holding a long ridge with several knobs — Hills 179, 175, and 174 — that dominated a pass fifteen miles northeast of Kaesong. The 5th Cavalry finally drove the defenders from the ridge during the afternoon of the twelfth, after much fierce fighting.

'''Albanian Screen'''  is a defunct television station with satellite frequency from [[Tirana]], [[Albania]]. It broadcast in Europe via EUTELSAT Satellite by covering the whole territory of Europe. Albanian Screen Television broadcasts terrestrially in all the territory of Albania, and via digital terrestrial signal in the city of Tirana. The General Director of Albanian Screen Television was oil mogul Mr. [[Rezart Taçi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rezart Taci Companies|url=http://rezarttaci.com/companies/|publisher=RezartTaci.com|accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 2003 by businessman and head of VEVE Group Vehbi Veliu, AS was the first privately owned satellite channel in Albania. After becoming a property of Taci Oil International Group in 2010 it was rebranded to Albanian Screen. Its program line up has undergone a fundamental change, by passing from an informative structure into a [[generalist channel|generalist television]], which is totally oriented toward information, education and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albanian Screen TV About US|url=http://www.albanianscreen.tv/pages/rreth_nesh/ALB|publisher=Albanian Screen|accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Alba TV===
The UHF channel of ASTV on the Tirana dial was originally occupied by Alba TV which was launched around 1998 by Italian businessmen. The local channel established successfully itself mainly in the Tirana area until around 2003 when it was bought by VEVE Group.

The '''Bahnar''' (also spelled '''Ba Na''') are an ethnic group of [[Vietnam]] living primarily in the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highland]] provinces of [[Gia Lai Province|Gia Lai]] and [[Kon Tum Province|Kon Tum]], as well as the coastal provinces of [[Bình Định Province|Bình Định]] and [[Phú Yên Province|Phú Yên]]. They speak the [[Bahnar language]] that belongs to the [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]] language family.
[[File:Người Ba Na.jpg|thumb|Bahnar women dancing]]
[[Image:BahnarRong.jpg|thumb|left|200 px| A Bahnar ''rong'' (communal house) in the village of [[Kon Kotu]].]]

== Music ==
Like many of the other ethnic groups of Vietnam's Central Highlands, the Bahnar play a great number of traditional musical instruments, including ensembles of pitched [[gong]]s and string instruments made from [[bamboo]]. These instruments are sometimes played in concert for special occasions, which may also involve ceremonial [[Rượu cần]] ([[rice wine]]) drinking and group dancing.

== Literature ==

=== Epic ===

Epics (Bahnar language: h'amon) such as [[Dam Noi]] represent centuries-old aspirations of Banar people.

==Notable Bahnar==
*[[Dinh Nup]], a hero who led villagers to carry out a war of resistance against the French colonial regime. He became the main character of a famous novel entitled ''Đất nước đứng lên'' ("Country rising up"), written by [[Nguyên Ngọc]]
*[[Ja Dok]], a heroine, the wife of [[Nguyễn Nhạc]]&lt;!--heroine for doing what?--&gt;
*[[Siu Black]], popular singer

== Festival ==
*[[Koh Kpo]] (or Groong Kpo Tonơi): a festival to express gratitude toward [[Yang (god)|Yang]] (the god) with the main activity being the stabbing of a [[domestic buffalo|water buffalo]]. A possible Chamic reconstruction of this name would be 'Gleng Ka Ppo Tanguei' 'Dedication to the God of the Corn.' Contemporary Bahnar refer to this ceremony as the even more truncated 'Gong Kpo.'

'''''Basmat Watan''''' ({{lang-ar|ب س م ا ت و ط ن}}) is a political satire and slapstick programme that airs via the [[Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation]], a privately owned television station in [[Lebanon]]. The writer of the show, Charbel Khalil, began work on the program in 1995 and in 2007 was leading its timeslot with 26 percent of the audience. The title of the programme is a [[pun]], as in [[Lebanese Arabic]] the title can either refer to either "death" or "smiles" of a nation.&lt;ref name="Lebanon Wire"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.lebanonwire.com/0704MLN/07041008AF.asp | title=Lebanon smiles at death of a nation | accessdate=2011-02-10 | author=Yassine, Salim | date=2007-04-10 | publisher=Lebanon Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Basmat Watan'' is the longest-running political satire program in Lebanon.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/07/world/middleeast/07khalil.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=world | title=A Lebanese Political Satirist With Hezbollah Among His Targets | accessdate=2011-02-10 | author=Worth, Robert F. | date=2009-02-06 | publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
In 1995, ''Basmat Watan'' started by lampooning Lebanese political figures, including the then Prime Minister of Lebanon [[Rafic Hariri]].&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt;

== Politics ==
Khalil, who is also the producer of the show, says the show does not favor any political party in Lebanon and that "the key is to take on absolutely everyone". One sketch on the show depicted a journalist with a swollen face after an interview with the allegedly quick-tempered [[Michel Aoun]], leader of the [[Free Patriotic Movement]].&lt;ref name="Lebanon Wire" /&gt; In an interview with ''The New York Times'', Khalil responded to suggestions that he targeted the [[Hezbollah]] ruling party more, saying "I criticize them more because they are the majority in Parliament", adding "if they lose, I will criticize the other side more."&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt;

'''Blackened death metal''' (also known as '''black death metal''') is an [[extreme metal|extreme]] subgenre of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] that fuses elements of [[black metal]] and [[death metal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/ninewinged-serpent-mw0000780983 |title=Ninewinged Serpent - Devian |last=Henderson |first=Alex |work=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/reviews/gr/hacavitz.htm |title=Hacavitz - Venganza Review |last=Bowar |first=Chad |work=[[About.com]] |accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre emerged in early 1990s when black metal bands began incorporating elements of death metal, and vice-versa. The genre typically employs death growls, tremolo picking, [[blast beat]]s, and [[Satanism|Satanic]] lyrics and imagery. Bands of the genre typically employ [[corpse paint]], which was adapted from black metal.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Behemoth 2009 0004.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tomasz Wróblewski|Orion]], bassist of Behemoth performing 2009.]]
The genre is commonly death metal that incorporates musical, lyrical or ideological elements of black metal, such as an increased use of [[alternate picking|tremolo picking]], anti-[[Christian]] or [[Satanism|Satanic]] lyrical themes and chord progressions similar to those used in black metal.&lt;ref name="Sound, Symbol, Sociality" /&gt; Blackened death metal bands are also more likely to wear corpse paint and suits of armour, than bands from other styles of death metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gardner |first1=Robert Owen |title=Studies in Symbolic Interaction |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower range guitar tunings, [[death growl]]s and abrupt [[tempo]] changes are common in the genre.&lt;ref name="Banger"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=[[Sam Dunn|Dunn]] |first1=[[Sam Dunn|Sam]] |last2=Deaville |first2=Jason |title=Blackened Death Metal |date=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some blackened death metal bands, such as [[Goatwhore]] and [[Angelcorpse]], even take significant influence from [[thrash metal]].&lt;ref name="Banger" /&gt;

==History==
Both black metal and death metal evolved out of the same crop of early extreme metal bands such as [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]], [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]], [[Kreator]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Celtic Frost]] and [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mudrian |first1=Albert |title=Precious Metal: Decibel Presents the Stories Behind 25 Extreme Metal Masterpieces |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McIver |first1=Joel |title=Extreme Metal II}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kahn-Harris |first1=Keith |title=Extreme Metal: Music and Culture on the Edge}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to common elements between the genres being in place, early death metal groups with some elements common in black metal include early-[[Sepultura]], [[Morbid Angel]] and [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]]. Along with this, John McEntee, guitarist and vocalist of death metal band [[Incantation (band)|Incantation]], has noted that he and his band draw influence from black metal.&lt;ref name="Banger" /&gt; Seminal black metal band [[Darkthrone]] began playing death metal, before moving into the style they became primarily known for.&lt;ref name="20 of the best black metal albums from the 1990s" /&gt;

[[Blasphemy (band)|Blasphemy]] crossed death metal and black metal on their debut album ''[[Fallen Angel of Doom]]'', giving way to the development of war metal.&lt;ref name="20 of the best black metal albums from the 1990s

The year 1998 saw the release of [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]]'s album ''[[Pandemonic Incantations]]'', striking a stylistic change in the sound of the band's output from a traditional black metal style with generally pagan lyrical themes into a more death metal influenced sound with lyrics about the occult and Satan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Behemoth |url=https://culture.pl/en/artist/behemoth |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After continuing this style, their 2000 album ''[[Thelema.6]]'' peaked at number 31 on the [[OLiS|Polish Albums Charts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=sales in the period  November 13, 2000 - November 26, 2000 |url=http://olis.onyx.pl/listy/index.asp?idlisty=6&amp;lang=pl |website=[[OLiS]] |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Behemoth's subsequent albums would continue to chart, with [[Demigod (album)|Demigod]] peaking at number 15,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://olis.onyx.pl/listy/index.asp?idlisty=227&amp;lang=en|title=OLiS - sales for the period  11.10.2004 - 17.10.2004|publisher=olis.onyx.pl|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Apostasy]] at number 9&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=sales for the period 02.07.2007 - 08.07.2007 |url=http://olis.onyx.pl/listy/index.asp?idlisty=406&amp;lang=en |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Evangelion (album)|Evangelion]]'' and ''[[The Satanist (album)|The Satanist]]'' both at number one,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=sales for the period 10.08.2009 - 16.08.2009 |url=http://olis.onyx.pl/listy/index.asp?idlisty=528&amp;lang=en |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=sales for the period 03.02.2014 - 09.02.2014 |url=http://olis.onyx.pl/listy/index.asp?idlisty=850&amp;lang=en |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with multiple albums charting worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BEHEMOTH - EVANGELION (ALBUM) |url=https://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Behemoth&amp;titel=Evangelion&amp;cat=a |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BEHEMOTH - EVANGELION |url=https://austriancharts.at/showitem.asp?interpret=Behemoth&amp;titel=Evangelion&amp;cat=a |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Official Rock &amp; Metal Albums Chart Top 40 |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/rock-and-metal-albums-chart/20140209/112/ |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chart History |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/Behemoth/chart-history/billboard-200 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; American band [[Skeletonwitch]]'s [[Breathing the Fire|third]], [[Forever Abomination|fourth]] and [[Serpents Unleashed|fifth]] albums peaked at numbers 151, 153 and 62, respectively, on the [[Billboard 200]] charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/Skeletonwitch/chart-history/billboard-200 |title=Chart History |publisher=[[Billboard 200]] |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thy Art Is Murder]], a band who previously played [[deathcore]], moved into a style more similar to blackened death metal on their fourth album ''[[Dear Desolation]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Senior |first1=Nicholas |title=Album Review: Thy Art Is Murder – Dear Desolation |url=https://newnoisemagazine.com/review-thy-art-murder-dear-desolation/ |accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Redmond |first1=Josh |title=REVIEWSREVIEW: Thy Art Is Murder – "Dear Desolation" |url=http://www.itdjents.com/reviews-2/review-thy-art-murder-dear-desolation/ |accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; charting in eight different territories, including a peak at  number five on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Albums Charts]] and number seven on the [[Recorded Music NZ|New Zealand Heatseekers Albums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THY ART IS MURDER - DEAR DESOLATION (ALBUM) |url=https://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Thy+Art+Is+Murder&amp;titel=Dear+Desolation&amp;cat=a |accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OFFICIAL TOP 40 ALBUMS |url=https://nztop40.co.nz/index.php/chart/albums?chart=4390 |accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as New Jersey's [[Lorna Shore]] also beginning to tread similarly into the grounds of blackened death metal on their sophomore album "Flesh Coffin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=KENNELTY |first1=GREG |title=LORNA SHORE Gets Blackened And Technical On Its New Song, "Denounce The Light" |url=http://www.metalinjection.net/av/lorna-shore-gets-blackened-and-technical-on-its-new-song-denounce-the-light |website=[[Metal Injection]] |accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden's Dissection evolved alongside melodic death metal bands such as [[At the Gates]] and [[In Flames]], by building upon the musical foundation laid by death metal and incorporating guitar melodies and harmonies amongst the standard brutality of the genre. However, unlike the other bands, Dissection began incorporating influences from black metal into their music,&lt;ref name="Swedish Death Metal" /&gt; which lead to their debut album ''[[The Somberlain]]'' influencing a plethora of subsequent bands and ''[[Metal Injection]]'' dubbing them "one of the most important extreme metal bands of all time".&lt;ref name="Blackened Melodic Death Metal: A History Lesson" /&gt; Sacramentum's debut and sophomore albums ''[[Far Away from the Sun]]'' and ''The Coming of Chaos'' would then continue Dissection's style of black metal-infused melodic death metal, based around middle of the neck guitar riffing and howling vocals, while Vinterland would lean even more upon their black metal predecessors like Norway's [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]].&lt;ref name="Blackened Melodic Death Metal: A History Lesson" /&gt; [[Naglfar (band)|Naglfar]] would base their sound primarily within that of [[Gothenburg metal]] bands like In Flames and [[Dark Tranquility]], by taking a brighter and thrashier take on the style.&lt;ref name="Blackened Melodic Death Metal: A History Lesson" /&gt;

'''Cesarea in Mauretania''' (Latin: ''Caesarea Mauretaniae'', meaning "Cesarea of [[Mauretania]]") was a Roman colony in Roman-Berber North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[https://jahiliyyah.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/afrique-du-nord-romanisation-de-la-numidie1.jpg Detailed map of Roman Berber Africa, showing the location of Iol-Caesarea on the Mediterranean coast]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the capital of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedieberbere.revues.org/1899 Ph. Leveau: Caesarea Mauretaniae (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt; and is now called [[Cherchell]], in modern [[Algeria]].

== Ecclesiastical history ==

Apart from some bishops who may have been of the church in Caesarea and whose names are engraved in inscriptions that have been unearthed, the first bishop whose name is preserved in extant written documents is Fortunatus, who took part in the [[Council of Arles]] of 314, which condemned [[Donatism]]  as [[heresy]]. A letter of Symmachus mentions a bishop named Clemens in about 371/372 or 380. 

The town became a Donatist centre and at the joint [[Conference of Carthage]] in 411, was represented both by the Donatist Emeritus and by the Catholic Deuterius. [[Augustine of Hippo]] has left an account of his public confrontation with Emeritus at Caesarea in the autumn of 418, after which Emeritus was exiled. 

The last bishop of Caesarea whose name is known from written documents was Apocorius, one of Catholic bishops whom [[Huneric]] summoned to Carthage in 484 and then sent into exile. An early 8th-century ''[[Notitia Episcopatuum]]'' still included this see.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Mesnage, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1096329/f462.image ''L'Afrique chrétienne''], Paris 1912, pp.&amp;nbsp;447–450&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Courtois, ''v. Césarée de Maurétanie'',  in [https://archive.org/stream/dictionnairedhis12baud#page/106/mode/2up ''Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de Géographie ecclésiastiques''], vol.

The '''Cathedral of Saint Mother Teresa in Pristina''' ({{lang-sq|Katedralja e së Shën Nënë Tereza në Prishtinë}}, {{lang-sr|italic=yes|Katedrala Majke Tereze u Prištini}} / Катедрала Мајке Терезе у Приштини) is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[cathedral]] being constructed in [[Pristina]], Kosovo. In 2007, the [[Government of Kosovo]] approved plans for the building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eni.ch/featured/article.php?id=730 Kosovo Catholics plan cathedral to honour Mother Teresa]&lt;/ref&gt; The cathedral is dedicated to the [[Albanians in Macedonia|Albanian]]-[[India]]n [[Roman Catholic]] nun and missionary, [[Mother Teresa|Saint Teresa of Calcutta]].

==History==
The foundation was ceremonially laid by former [[President of Kosovo]], [[Ibrahim Rugova]], himself a [[Muslim]].&lt;ref name="BIRN"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Cathedral Symbolises Catholic Rebirth in Kosovo|url=http://kosovo.birn.eu.com/en/1/70/4101|website=BIRN Kosovo|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211070113/http://kosovo.birn.eu.com/en/1/70/4101|archivedate=11 December 2011|date=6 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was inaugurated on 26 August 2010, the hundredth anniversary of her birthday, before construction was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kosovo: Neue Mutter-Teresa-Kirche eingeweiht|url=http://diepresse.com/home/panorama/religion/592509/Kosovo_Neue-MutterTeresaKirche-eingeweiht|accessdate=22 March 2015|work=DiePresse.com|date=6 September 2010|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its construction, begun in 2011, sparked controversy in Muslim circles where it was seen as outsized considering the small number of Catholics in the area.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/kosovo-row-over-mother-teresa-statue|title=Kosovo Muslims Resent New Mother Teresa Statue|last=|first=|date=26 May 2011|website=|publisher=Balkan Insight|access-date=|author=Petrit Collaku|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the cathedral's completion, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Prizren-Priština]] will move from [[Prizren]] to Pristina.&lt;ref name = "BIRN"/&gt; The cathedral will be one of Pristina's tallest buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rtv.rtrlondon.co.uk/2008-09-05/3f71d290.html In Pristina's old Ottoman mosque, Muslims gather for prayers]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6550">The '''Chamber of Local Authorities''' is one of the two Chambers of the [[Congress of the Council of Europe|Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe]]. The Chamber is the voice of local authorities (cities and municipalities) in the Council of Europe. It consists of 324 representatives from the Council’s 47 member states, who either hold a general local authority mandate from direct elections or are politically accountable to a directly elected assembly. The Chamber provides an opportunity for local officials to discuss common concerns, share their experiences and develop relevant policies.

According to the new Charter of the Congress adopted on 2 May 2007 by the Committee of Ministers, the Chamber’s membership is based on the principles of balanced geographical distribution, equitable representation of the various types of local authorities and their political groups, as well as of equitable representation of women and men. The Chamber drafts reports, recommendations, resolutions and opinions on the issues of its concern and presents them to the Standing Committee of the Congress for adoption.

==History==
Prior to the creation of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe in 1994, the Conference of Local and Regional Authorities was in place. The first existence and idea of a body addressing with the issue local government was proposed in 1957 but the standing conference was not created until 1961. This standing conference had existed since 1961. This institutionalisation in 1994 demonstrated the progress and importance of local governance and regional control in the development of Europe. The behavior and actions of the chamber (along with the [[Chamber of Regions]]) are based in the [[European Charter of Local Self-Government]] which was opened for signature and ratification in 1985.

==Committees==
In October 2010, the Congress laid out its priorities for 2011-2012 as part of the reform process which included a modification of its committee structure from four statutory committees to three. The four prior existing committees were the Institutional Committee, the Culture and Education Committee, the Committee on Social Cohesion and the Committee on Sustainable Development. The three newly created committees are the Monitoring Committee, the Governance Committee and the Current Affairs Committee. This change was approved in December 2010.

According to the Congress' official website:

=== Monitoring Committee ===
"The Committee on the Honouring of Obligations and Commitments by member states of the European Charter of Local Self-Government - Monitoring Committee - is responsible, in particular, for monitoring the application of the Charter as well as institutional developments in Europe’s regions, for preparing reports on the situation of local and regional democracy in Europe and for monitoring specific questions related to local and regional democracy in the member states."

=== Governance Committee ===
"The Governance Committee is responsible for affairs falling within the scope of the Congress' statutory mandate such as governance, public finance, cross-border and interregional co-operation and e-democracy as well as co-operation with intergovernmental bodies."

=== Current Affairs Committee ===
"The Current Affairs Committee is responsible for studying the role of local and regional authorities with regard to the major challenges of our society and preparing work on thematic issues such as social cohesion, education, culture and sustainable development from the point of view of the Council of Europe's core values."

==The Bureau==
The Chamber elects its President among its members for two years, and appoints the Bureau composed of the President (currently [[Jean-Claude Frécon]] of France) and seven Vice-Presidents respecting as far as possible a fair geographic distribution among the member states. At the moment the Bureau is composed of (in order of protocol):

*[[Anders Knape]], Sweden (President)
*[[Barbara Toce]], Italy (Vice President)
*[[Jolanta Barska]], Poland (Vice President)
*[[Jaroslav Hlinka]], Slovak Republic (Vice President)
*[[Gaye Doganoglu]], Turkey (Vice President)
*[[Mary Hegarty]], Ireland (Vice President)
*[[John Warmisham]], United Kingdom (Vice President)
*[[Juliana Hoxha]], Albania (Vice President)

==The Secretariat==
The Chamber has a permanent Secretariat located at the ''[[Palace of Europe]]'' in [[Strasbourg]], which is headed by its Executive Secretary, currently [[Jean-Philippe Bozouls]], appointed by the [[Secretary General of the Council of Europe]].

==List of Members==
The Chamber consists of 324 statutory members (representatives and substitutes) from:

*[[Albania]] (4)
*[[Andorra]] (2)
*[[Armenia]] (4)
*[[Austria]] (6)

'''Civitas Tropaensium''' was a Roman [[castrum]] situated in [[Scythia Minor]] in modern [[Constanţa County]], [[Romania]]. Its site is now the modern settlement of [[Adamclisi]]. It was colonized with Roman veterans of the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]], was the largest Roman city of Scythia Minor{{fact|date=December 2011}} and became a [[municipium]] around 200[[AD]].

In 109 AD, a monument named [[Tropaeum Traiani]] was built to commemorate the [[Roman Empire]]'s victories over the [[Dacians]].
[[File:TropeumTraiani 14.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A smaller Trophy found at Adamclisi, a smaller copy of the original monument which was installed at the eastern city gates during Constantine and Licinius.]]
The city was destroyed by the [[Goths]], but it was rebuilt during [[Constantine the Great]]'s rule with improved defensive walls. Civitas Tropaensium survived until the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] sacked it in 587, after which it ceased to be an important city of [[Dobruja]] and was no longer mentioned for seven hundred years.

'''Dando's Dogs''' also known as the '''Devil's Dandy Dogs''', are [[mythical]] creatures in [[English folklore]].  They are hounds that take part in the [[Wild Hunt]]. They are associated with [[Black dog (ghost)|Black Dogs]], as a generic term for canine apparitions.

The [[legend]] involves a sinful [[priest]] named Dando, who was a capable huntsman. After a Sunday hunt, Dando drinks all the alcohol that his companions give him. Dando calls for more. He exclaims that if the drink he wants cannot be found on Earth, they should go to [[Hell]] to get it. A strange huntsman comes forward and offers Dando a drink, but seizes some of Dando's game from the hunt. A drunken Dando tries to stop the huntsman, shouting, "I'll go to Hell after them, but I'll get them from thee."
 
In another version, a strange huntsman offers Dando a flask.  Dando drinks it, but wants more and says that "I'll gallop to Hell for more".

In both versions, the huntsman whisks Dando away to Hell, while Dando's dogs give futile chase. It is said that on early Sunday mornings, "Dando's Dogs" can be heard, either pursuing game or searching for Dando.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hunt, Popular Romances of the West of England, 1st series, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannia.com/history/legend/collection/legcol01.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David of Sassoun''' ({{lang-hy|Սասունցի Դավիթ}} ''Sasuntsi Davit'') is the main hero of Armenia's [[national epic]] ''[[Daredevils of Sassoun]]'', who drove Arab invaders out of [[Armenia]].

The ''Daredevils of Sassoun'' (also known as after its main hero ''David of Sassoun'') is an Armenian [[national epic]] poem recounting David's exploits. As an [[oral history]], it dates from the 8th century, and was first put in written form in 1873 by [[Garegin Srvandztiants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haroutyunian|first1=S.

David of Sassoun is the name of only one of the four acts, but due to the popularity of the character, the entire epic is known to the public as David of Sasun. The epic's full name is ''Sasna Tsrer'' (The Daredevils of Sasun).

In 1902 the prominent Armenian poet and writer [[Hovhannes Tumanyan]] penned a poem of the same name retelling the story of the David of Sasun in a more modern language.

[[File:Tekst op gedenksteen Rozenoord Amsterdam.JPG|thumb|The memorial plaque]]

'''Fusilladeplaats Rozenoord''' is a World War II memorial in the Dutch city of Amsterdam.

'Fusilladeplaats' might be translated into English as 'firing squad place'. 'Rozenoord' was originally a rose garden, whose name was adopted during the 1930s by a [[teahouse]] by the {{ill|Amsteldijk|nl|Amsteldijk (Amsterdam)}}, a [[levee|dyke]] in Amsterdam.

Between 18 January and 14 April 1945, German occupation forces shot dead more than 100 Dutch civilians at Fusilladeplaats Rozenoord (at least that many have been identified, several of them resistance fighters). Those events are commemorated 4 May every year.&lt;ref name=Wesselink&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geheugenvanplanzuid.nl/archief/tijdtijn/Rozenoord.htm |title=Wie zijn er gefusisillierd bij Rozenoord? |first=Pauline |last=Wesselink |website=geheugenvanplanzuid.nl |language=Dutch |accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that no-one ever faced trial for those crimes.

The inscription on the memorial plaque reads:{{quote|Op deze plaats werden in de&lt;br&gt;laatste maanden van de&lt;br&gt;Tweede Wereldoorlog meer dan&lt;br&gt;100 Nederlanders door de Duitse&lt;br&gt;bezetter gefusilleerd}}

An English translation:{{quote|At this place, during the last months of the Second World War, the German occupiers shot dead more than 100 Dutch people.}}

In 2014, Dutch artist and sculptor {{ill|Ram Katzir|nl}} designed another memorial for Fusilladeplaats Rozenoord. It consists of an arrangement of empty chairs.

The '''Grand Poubara Dam''' is a [[gravity dam]] on the [[Ogooué River]], about {{Convert|15|km}} south of [[Franceville]] in [[Gabon]]. The primary purpose of the dam is [[hydroelectric]] power generation and it supports a {{convert|160|MW}} power station. Construction on the project began in November 2008, the river was diverted in November 2010, and the power station was commissioned on 5 August 2013. The dam diverts the river around the [[Poubara Falls]] where four {{convert|40|MW|adj=on}} [[Francis turbine]]-generators are powered. The majority of the dam and power station was funded by the Chinese government and the project was constructed by [[Sinohydro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydroelectric Power Plants in West Africa|url=http://www.industcards.com/hydro-africa-w.htm|publisher=IndustCards|accessdate=25 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090719000622/http%3A//www.industcards.com/hydro%2Dafrica%2Dw.htm|archivedate=19 July 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gabon, Grand Poubara Hydropower Station |url=http://eng.sinohydro.com/index.php?m=content&amp;c=index&amp;a=show&amp;catid=42&amp;id=131 |publisher=Sinohydro |accessdate=25 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325205839/http://eng.sinohydro.com/index.php?m=content&amp;c=index&amp;a=show&amp;catid=42&amp;id=131 |archivedate=25 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gabon's 160-MW Grand Poubara hydroelectric plant enters full operation| url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2013/09/gabon-s-160-mw-grand-poubara-enters-full-operation.html |publisher=Hydro World |accessdate=25 March 2014|date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''hr-skyline''' was a German, public [[radio station]] owned and operated by the [[Hessischer Rundfunk]] (HR).

==History==
The main focus of the program was on economic reporting. To underline this focus, the broadcasting studio of ''hr-skyline'' was located in Frankfurt's [[Bankenviertel]] on the 54th floor of the [[Main Tower]]. The follow-up program [[hr-info]] has taken over this focus in part, but is increasingly aimed at sports and culture lovers.

'''Mreža''' ("net" in Croatian) was the first private [[Croatia]]n [[television network]].  It was founded in 1997. From its [[Zagreb]] studios, it produced original programs that were later aired on various local and regional stations.

The arrival of Mreža was quite a notable event in Croatian media history, because it was the first time the media monopoly of state-owned [[Croatian Radiotelevision]] (HRT) was significantly challenged. Mreža produced original programs in the form of its own news, as well as lavishly produced shows. Mreža also poached some important talent from HRT, including [[Denis Latin]] and his popular ''[[Latinica (TV show)|Latinica]]'' talk show.

One of the owners of Mreža was the controversial tycoon [[Miroslav Kutle]], and his activities caused the network to fail. Burdened with debts and financial mismanagement, Mreža disappeared from the Croatian airwaves in 1998, taking a few of the local affiliates with it, including [[TV Marjan]] from [[Split (city)|Split]].

'''Obbi''' was an ancient [[civitas|city]] and former [[diocese]] in [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa Proconsulare]]. It is now a [[Roman Catholic]] [[titular see]].

== History ==
'''Obbi''' was among the numerous towns in the [[Roman province]] of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]] which were important enough to become a [[suffragan bishopric]], yet faded completely, even its location in modern [[Algeria]] hasn't been identified.

Its only recorded incumbent, Eusabius, attended the [[Council of Carthage (484)|Council of Carthage of 484]], called by the king [[Huneric]], as one of his [[Vandal Kingdom]]'s Catholic bishops, like most of those afterwards banished, unlike the schismatic adherents of the heresy [[Donatism]].

== Titular see ==
The diocese was nominally restored in 1933 as Latin [[titular bishopric]] of Obbi (Latin = Curiate Italian) / Obbitan(us) (Latin adjective).

It has had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank:

* Franz von Streng (1967.11.03 – death 1970.08.07) as emeritate; previously Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Basel und Lugano|Basel und Lugano]] (Switzerland) ([1936.11.17] 1936.11.30 – 1967.11.03)
* Henri-François-Marie-Pierre Derouet (1970.10.21 – 1971.07.24) as [[Coadjutor Bishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Séez|Séez]] (France) (1970.10.21 – succession 1971.07.24); next Bishop of Séez (1971.07.24 – 1985.10.10), Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Arras|Arras]] (northern France) (1985.10.10 – retired 1998.08.12), died 2004
* Guy Alexis Herbulot (1974.06.20 – 1978.05.12) as Auxiliary Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Reims|Archdiocese of Reims]] (northern France) (1974.06.20 – 1978.05.12); later last Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Corbeil|Corbeil]] (France) (1978.05.12 – 1988.06.11), restyled first Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Évry-Corbeil-Essonnes|Évry-Corbeil-Essonnes]] (France) (1988.06.11 – retired 2000.04.15)

* Albert Jean-Marie Rouet (1986.06.21 – 1993.12.16) as Auxiliary Bishop of Paris (France) (1986.06.21 – 1993.12.16); later [[Coadjutor Bishop]] of Poitiers (France) (1993.12.16 – succession 1994.06.12), last suffragan Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Poitiers|Poitiers]] (France) (1994.06.12 – 2002.12.08), promoted first Metropolitan Archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Poitiers|Archdiocese of Poitiers]] (France) (2002.12.08 – retired 2011.02.12)

'''TRT Avaz''' is a channel broadcast by the [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation]] with focusing on Turkey and Balkans. It was launched in Turkey on March 21, 2009 and broadcasts throughout the Balkans, Turkic Central Asia, the Middle East, and the Caucasus.

Programs are televised in [[Azeri language|Azeri]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], and [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] with Turkish-language subtitles, and include documentaries, talk shows, culture and music programs as well as region-specific films and soap operas. Audiences also have the opportunity to learn Turkish through tutorials. 

The channel has the potential to reach an audience of 250 million people in 27 countries and 13 autonomous regions across [[Eastern Europe]], [[Western Asia|Western]], and [[Central Asia]], spanning [[Bulgaria]] to [[Afghanistan]]. However the channel is blocked in [[China]] due to concerns about Turkic separatism within the [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]].{{says who|date=November 2012}}

The channel's name was announced by President [[Abdullah Gül]] as "AVAZ", a word that means "voice" in many Central Asian languages.

'''TV8''' is a digital-terrestrial free-to-air Italian general entertainment TV channel owned by [[Sky Italia]] through its subsidiary company "Nuova Società Televisiva Italiana S.r.l". The channel is allocated at number 8 of the Italian [[virtual channel]] list.

==History==
On 31 July 2015 Sky Italia took over ownership of the free-to-air MTV Italy.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/31/viacom-sky-mtvitalia-idUSI6N10900A20150731&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 September 2015, [[MTV Italy]] was rebranded as MTV8 by Sky Italia.

On the same day, Viacom launched a new MTV-channel for Italy, MTV Next (now MTV), and is now only available as a subscription service on Sky. This ended an era where MTV Italy was available to the majority of homes across Italy free-to-air.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4lC2UpGWjw&lt;/ref&gt; The Music-station of Viacom in Italy, [[MTV Music (Italy)|MTV Music]] remained available free to air until 1 July 2016, when it moved to Sky Italia.

On 8 January 2016, Sky introduced a new on air graphic for MTV8 focussing on the number 8 and launched the channel's website.

On 18 February 2016, Sky changed the channel name into TV8.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.primaonline.it/2016/02/18/228671/nuovo-nome-per-lex-canale-mtv-che-da-oggi-diventa-tv8/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
TV8's programming consists of reruns of comedy shows, crime shows, [[UEFA Europa League]] matches, [[Moto GP]], [[Formula One|Formula 1]] and movies.

'''The Bad Mexican''' is a 2017 Ugandan comedy short film written and directed by Loukman Ali.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hayti.org/2018-film-list/|title=2018 Film List - Hayti Heritage Center|date=2018-01-24|work=Hayti Heritage Center|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film opens with the caption: 'Unfortunately this is a true story...' plus skylines of [[Kampala]] City. It stars Adnan Senkumba who plays Kenneth Senkumba, a man with a dream to submit his award-worthy script entitled ''The Bad Mexican'' to an influential producer at the Masters Music office so that he can make loads of money. He dreams that it will be more than enough to refund Moses (played by [[Joel Okuyo Atiku]]) in full and also enjoy himself at the beach with girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ziff.or.tz/2018/06/09/the-bad-mexican/|title=The Bad Mexican|last=|first=|date=|website=Zanzibar International Film Festival|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite paying the 'thug' for the past eight months, the money keeps accumulating. Ken owes him $300 and he always collects. While driving himself to deliver the script, Kenneth parks after his friend tells him on phone that Moses wants him and he had given him Ken's number; he would rather kill himself than let Moses torture him. Ken's stomach starts grumbling because of the bad Mexican food he had eaten as recommended by the friend. He shits in his pants and has to change them in time for the presentation, his friend (advised by Jess - a girlfriend sitted on a sofa and watching TV) tries telling him to contact a company called Trendz that delivers clothes by GPS but because of bugs in their app; a motorcycle courier instead delivers a grey French cap (''nkofira'') worth 20,000 UgX. Disappointed, Ken is forced to pay the young lad (he had earlier splashed water on from a pothole puddle in Industrial Area) for his multi-coloured 'ugly trousers'. The boy walks away happy in his boxers with some cash in hand. After submitting his script in a khaki envelope, a lady gives him a number and tells him not to call it but rather they would use it to call him if he is selected. The following day, Moses holding a bat and his three goons start looking for Ken at his apartment block. The film features dialogue in English, [[Luganda language|Luganda]] and [[Lugbara language|Lugbara]] though captioned. 

==Reception==
''The Bad Mexican'' has been screened at various film festivals including the Zanzibar International Film Festival (ZIFF) and Ngalabi Short Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://goethezentrumkampala.org/culture/film/ngalabi-short-film-festival-2018/|title=Ngalabi Short Film Festival 2018|work=Goethe Zentrum Kampala|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jude Zambarakji commented, "The editing was excellent!" Dorothy Lewa Bende and Shifah Musisi thought the film was "amazing". Scene transitions caught people's attention and the CGI of the helicopter was very photorealistic basing on the fact that Loukman is a creative motion graphics designer and sketch artist.

'''USA-126''', also known as '''GPS IIA-17''', '''GPS II-26''' and '''GPS SVN-40''', is an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] which forms part of the [[Global Positioning System]]. It was the seventeenth of nineteen [[GPS Block IIA|Block IIA]] GPS satellites to be launched.

USA-126 was launched at 00:50:00 UTC on 16 July 1996, atop a [[Delta II]] carrier rocket, flight number D237, flying in the 7925-9.5 configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Launch Complex 17A]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-126 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into [[medium Earth orbit]] using a [[Star-37XFP]] [[apogee motor]].&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar-2a.htm|title=GPS-2A (Navstar-2A)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 August 1996, USA-126 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|20134|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20227|km}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 717.9 minutes, and 55 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It broadcasts the PRN 10 signal, and operates in slot 3 of plane E of the GPS constellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/project/navstar.htm|title=Navstar|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|first=Mark|last=Wade|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite has a mass of {{convert|1816|kg}}. It had a design life of 7.5 years,&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; however, it was kept in service for over 18 years before finally decommissioned from service on July 16, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?Do=gpsShowNanu&amp;num=2015069|title=NOTICE ADVISORY TO NAVSTAR USERS (NANU) 2015069|publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]]|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following decommissioning, it was subsequently placed in a disposal orbit approximately 1000&amp;nbsp;km above the operational constellation on March 11, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schriever.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/734896/50-sw-to-dispose-of-two-gps-satellites|title=50 SW to dispose of two GPS satellites|publisher=[[United States Air Force]]|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
