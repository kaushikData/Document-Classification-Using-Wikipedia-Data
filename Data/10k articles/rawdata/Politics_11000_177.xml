The '''2010 Karachi riots''' started on August 3, 2010, after the assassination of [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament member]] [[Raza Haider]],  a member of the [[Muttahida Qaumi Movement]] political party, on the night of August 2, 2010, in [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="guardian20100803"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/03/karachi-riots-deaths-pakistan|title=Karachi riots leave 45 dead after MP assassinated|last=Walsh|first=Declan|date=3 August 2010|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=4 August 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) represents the [[Urdu language|Urdu]]-speaking [[Muhajir people|Muhajir]] and is a political rival of the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]]s who have migrated to the city from northwest Pakistan. Haider, a [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Muslim]], was killed as he attended a funeral at a mosque.&lt;ref name="bb20100804"/&gt;

By August 6 at least 10 Pashtuns were killed and more than 100 people injured in widespread violence that engulfed the city.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2010/08/06/karachi-violence.html|title=Karachi death toll tops 90|date=6 August 2010|publisher=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Economic losses over two days of riots were estimated to be about {{Nowrap|17 billion}} [[Pakistani rupee]]s (Approx. 200 million [[USD]]).&lt;ref name="bb20100804"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-04/karachi-erupts-in-violence-for-second-night-after-lawmaker-s-assassination.html|title=Karachi Streets Grow Calmer After 63 Gunned Down Over Two Nights of Riots|last=Anis|first=Khurrum|date=4 August 2010|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P]]|accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Karachi]] has a history of political bloodshed stretching back to the late 1980s when the city was regularly rocked by political and ethnic shootings that killed dozens every week. Analysts say the city is again in the grip of a political turf war.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk20100803"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/03/karachi-riots-deaths-pakistan |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Declan |last=Walsh |title=Karachi riots leave 45 dead after MP assassinated |date=3 August 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806170125/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/03/karachi-riots-deaths-pakistan |archivedate=6 August 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karachi]], which is provincial Capital of [[Sindh]] and Pakistan's commercial capital and largest city, has a population of {{Nowrap|18 million}} and contributes about 70% of the country's tax income.&lt;ref name="bb20100804"/&gt; The city has seen a wave of political killings in 2010 which have deepened ethnic tensions.

==Violence==
Most of those killed and injured in the reprisal shootings came from the smaller [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]]s, The MQM, which ruled Karachi until earlier 2010, represents the city's [[Muhajir people|Muhajir]] community. Most of the injured were [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]]s, with a few [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]]s and [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]]s among the victims, said one source.
Jan Sardar, a 35-year-old [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]], was shot seven times. "When they fired the first shot, I jumped in a sewer to save myself, but they came after me and fired more bullets," he said from his hospital bed. The gunman was carrying an [[MQM]] flag, he added.
Clothes trader Ahmed Shah, who was shot in the leg, was travelling in a bus with 50 passengers when it came under fire.
"I didn't see who it was; it was dark," he said. A cousin said he saw seven dead bodies at the site.
Iqbal Hussain, a teenager from [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]], said he was left for dead after a gunman burst into his house in north [[Karachi]], opening fire. A less fortunate friend was killed.

&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk20100803"/&gt;
Several buildings were set on fire and vehicles destroyed after angry mobs went through the city streets seeking revenge.  Most of those killed were Pashtuns.&lt;ref name="bbc20100803"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-10859706|title=Karachi death toll rises after Raza Haider killing|date=3 August 2010|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the injured had been shot point blank and were targeted for their ethnicity.&lt;ref name="guardian20100803"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dawn20100803"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/local/19-karachi-burns-in-wave-of-violence-mqm-blames-anp-for-mpas-killing-380-hh-02|title=Karachi burns in wave of violence|date=3 August 2010|publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the neighboring city of [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] gunmen attacked a train going to [[Lahore]], injuring the driver and destroying the locomotive.&lt;ref name="bbc20100803"/&gt;

==Reactions==
MQM declared three days of mourning after the assassination. Business activities in the city virtually shut down. The local police arrested 40 people including 20 Islamist hardliners.&lt;ref name="bbc20100804x"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-10863646|title=Haider murder: Karachi police arrest 'hardliners'|date=4 August 2010|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interior minister [[Rehman Malik]] blamed [[Sipah-e-Sahaba]] of fomenting violence against the minority Shia community in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="bb20100804"/&gt; [[President of Pakistan]], [[Asif Ali Zardari]], ordered an immediate investigation into the violence.  The [[Karachi Stock Exchange]] saw very slow activity in the aftermath of the riots and the [[Pakistani rupee|rupee]] hit a record low of 85.80 to a [[United States dollar]].&lt;ref name="tni20100804"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=254567|title=Rupee hits another record low of 85.80|date=4 August 2010|publisher=[[The News International]]|accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lots of students of Karachi University have organized a peace walk to condemn these riots and for calling peace in the city.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The '''industrial plans for Germany''' were designs the Allies considered imposing on Germany in the aftermath of [[World War II]] to reduce and manage Germany's industrial capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/germany-1945-1949-a-case-study-in-post-conflict-reconstruction|title=Germany 1945-1949: a case study in post-conflict reconstruction|last=Knowles|first=Chris|date=29 January 2014|website=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|access-date=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
At the [[Potsdam conference]] (July–August 1945), with the US operating under influence of the [[Morgenthau plan]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal 
|last= Gareau |first= Frederick H. |year= 1961 
|title= Morgenthau's Plan for Industrial Disarmament in Germany 
|journal= Western Political Quarterly 
|volume= 14 |issue= 2 |pages= 517–534
|jstor= 443604|doi= 10.2307/443604 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the victorious [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] decided to abolish the [[Wehrmacht|German armed forces]] as well as all munitions factories and civilian industries that could support them. This included the destruction of all ship- and aircraft-manufacturing capability. Further, the victors decided that civilian industries that might have military potential were to be restricted. The restriction of the latter was calibrated with Germany's "approved peacetime needs", which were defined based on the average European standard. In order to achieve this, each type of industry was subsequently reviewed{{by whom|date=January 2018}} to see how many factories Germany required under these minimum level-of-industry requirements.

==Level of industry plans==
[[File:Industry Allocation.jpg|thumb|Allocation policy for "surplus" German heavy industry.]] The first "level of industry" plan, signed by the Allies on March 29, 1946, stated that German heavy industry was to be lowered to 50% of its 1938 levels by the destruction of 1,500 listed manufacturing plants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry C. Wallich]]. ''Mainsprings of the German Revival'' (1955) pg. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1946 the [[Allied Control Council]] set the foundation of the future German economy by putting a cap on German steel production capacity: the maximum allowed was set at about 5,800,000 tons of steel a year, equivalent to 25% of the prewar production level.&lt;ref name="Cornerstone of Steel"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,934360,00.html "Cornerstone of Steel"], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', January 21, 1946&lt;/ref&gt; The UK, in whose occupation zone most of the steel production was located, had argued for a less-limited reduction of 12 million tons of steel per year, but had to submit to the will of the US, France, and the Soviet Union (which had argued for a 3 million ton limit). Steel plants thus made redundant were to be dismantled. Germany was to be reduced to the standard of life it had known at the height of the [[Great Depression]] (1932).&lt;ref name="Cost of Defeat"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,852764,00.html Cost of Defeat], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', April 8, 1946&lt;/ref&gt; Car production was set to 10% of prewar levels, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/marshall/large/documents/index.php?pagenumber=10&amp;documentid=22&amp;documentdate=1947-03-24&amp;studycollectionid=mp&amp;nav=OK The President's Economic Mission to Germany and Austria, Report 3] [[Herbert Hoover]], March, 1947 pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 1946, a dispatch from Berlin reported:

{{quote|Some progress has been made in converting Germany to an agricultural and light industry economy, said Brigadier General [[William Henry Draper Jr.]], chief of the American Economics Division, who emphasized that there was general agreement on that plan.

He explained that Germany’s future industrial and economic pattern was being drawn for a population of 66,500,000. On that basis, he said, the nation will need large imports of food and raw materials to maintain a minimum [[standard of living]].

General agreement, he continued, had been reached on the types of German exports&amp;nbsp;— [[coal]], [[coke (fuel)|coke]], electrical equipment, [[leather]] goods, [[beer]], [[wine]]s, spirits, toys, musical instruments, textiles and [[apparel]]&amp;nbsp;— to take the place of the heavy industrial products which formed most of Germany's pre-war exports.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Stewart Martin (military)|James Stewart Martin]]. ''All Honorable Men'' (1950) pg. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Timber exports from the US occupation zone were particularly heavy. Sources in the US government admitted that the purpose of this was the "ultimate destruction of the war potential of German forests." Extensive deforestation due to clear-felling resulted in a situation which could "be replaced only by long forestry development over perhaps a century.".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Balabkins, "Germany Under Direct Controls; Economic Aspects Of Industrial Disarmament 1945-1948, Rutgers University Press, 1964. p. 119. The two quotes used by Balabkins are referenced to respectively; US office of Military Government, ''A Year of Potsdam: The German Economy Since the Surrender'' (1946), p.70; and US Office of Military Government, ''The German Forest Resources Survey'' (1948), p. II. For similar observations see G.W. Harmssen, ''Reparationen, Sozialproduct, Lebensstandard'' (Bremen: F. Trujen Verlag, 1948), I, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first plan was subsequently followed by a number of new ones, the last signed in 1949. By 1950, after the virtual completion of the by-then much watered-down "level of industry" plans, equipment had been removed from 706 manufacturing plants in the west and steel production capacity had been reduced by 6,700,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick H. Gareau "Morgenthau's Plan for Industrial Disarmament in Germany" The Western Political Quarterly, Vol. 14, No. 2 (Jun., 1961), pp. 517-534&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moderation of policy==
Beginning in mid-1946 American and British policy towards the German economy began to change, illustrated by Byrnes's September speech [[restatement of policy on Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;Dennis L. Bark and [[David R. Gress]]. ''A history of West Germany vol 1: from shadow to substance'' (Oxford 1989) p178&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as the "Stuttgart speech" or "Speech of hope"). According to Dennis L. Bark and [[David R. Gress]] in ''A History of West Germany'' the [[Morgenthau Plan]] came to be seen as inflicting undue hardship, and so the approach was shifted, over time, to one encouraging German economic expansion.  As part of this, the allowed levels of industrial capacity were raised.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis L. Bark and [[David R. Gress]]. ''A History of West Germany vol 1: from shadow to substance'' (Oxford 1989) p179&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Vladimir Nikolayevich Petrov|Vladimir Petrov]] in ''Money and conquest: allied occupation currencies in World War II'' the reason for the change in US occupation policy was almost exclusively based on economic considerations. Although a large part of the occupation costs were placed on the German economy, the US and the UK were increasingly forced to supply food imports to prevent mass starvation.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Petrov, ''Money and conquest; allied occupation currencies in World War II.'' Baltimore, Johns Hopkins Press (1967) p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;  According to some historians the US government abandoned the Morgenthau Plan as policy in September 1946 with [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[James F. Byrnes]]' speech [[Restatement of Policy on Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gimbel |first1=John |author-link=John Gimbel|title=On the Implementation of the Potsdam Agreement: An Essay on U.S. Postwar German Policy |journal=[[Political Science Quarterly]] |date=1972 |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=242–269 |doi=10.2307/2147827 |jstor=2147827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that credit should be given to former US President [[Herbert Hoover]] who in one of [[The President's Economic Mission to Germany and Austria|his reports from Germany]] in 1947 argued for a change in occupation policy, amongst other things stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is the illusion that the New Germany left after the annexations can be reduced to a "pastoral state". It cannot be done unless we exterminate or move 25,000,000 people out of it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erik Reinert]], [[Jomo K.S.]] [https://www.un.org/Pubs/chronicle/2008/webarticles/080103_marshallplan.html The Marshall Plan at 60: The General's Successful War On Poverty] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414103548/http://www.un.org/Pubs/chronicle/2008/webarticles/080103_marshallplan.html |date=April 14, 2008 }}, [[UN Chronicle]] (accessed 2008-05-20)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Worries about the sluggish recovery of the European economy (which before the war was driven by the German industrial base) and growing Soviet influence amongst a German population subject to food shortages and economic misery, caused the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and Generals [[Lucius D. Clay|Clay]] and [[George Marshall|Marshall]] to start lobbying the [[Truman administration]] for a change of policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usip.org/pubs/peaceworks/pwks49.pdf Ray Salvatore Jennings "The Road Ahead: Lessons in Nation Building from Japan, Germany, and Afghanistan for Postwar Iraq] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514021020/http://www.usip.org/pubs/peaceworks/pwks49.pdf |date=May 14, 2008 }} May 2003,  Peaceworks No. 49  pp 14,15&lt;/ref&gt; General Clay commissioned several expert studies about necessary changes in German economy&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Lewis H. Brown]], [[A Report on Germany|A Report on Germany (New York, 1947)]]&lt;/ref&gt; and stated
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no choice between being a communist on 1,500 calories a day and a believer in democracy on a thousand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In July 1947, President [[Harry S. Truman]] rescinded on "national security grounds"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usip.org/pubs/peaceworks/pwks49.pdf Ray Salvatore Jennings "The Road Ahead: Lessons in Nation Building from Japan, Germany, and Afghanistan for Postwar Iraq] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514021020/http://www.usip.org/pubs/peaceworks/pwks49.pdf |date=May 14, 2008 }} May 2003, Peaceworks No. 49  pg.15&lt;/ref&gt; the punitive occupation directive JCS 1067, which had directed the US forces of occupation in Germany to "take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany [or] designed to maintain or strengthen the German economy." It was replaced by [[JCS 1779]], which instead noted that "[a]n orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887417,00.html Pas de Pagaille!] [[Time Magazine]] July 28, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, General Clay needed over two months to overcome continued resistance among his staff to the new directive, but on July 10, 1947, it was finally approved at a meeting of the [[SWNCC]]. The final version of the document "was purged of the most important elements of the Morgenthau Plan."&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Petrov, ''Money and conquest; allied occupation currencies in World War II.'' Baltimore, Johns Hopkins Press (1967) p. 236 (Petrov footnotes Hammond, American Civil-Military Decisions, p. 443)&lt;/ref&gt;

The restrictions placed on German heavy industry production were thus partly ameliorated, as permitted steel production levels were raised from 25% of pre-war capacity&lt;ref name="Cornerstone of Steel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cost of Defeat"/&gt; to a new limit placed at 50% of pre-war capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887417,00.html Pas de Pagaille!] ''[[Time Magazine]]'', Jul. 28, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic consequences==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B0527-0001-753, Krefeld, Hungerwinter, Demonstration.jpg|thumb|The hunger-winter of 1947, thousands protest against the disastrous food situation (March 31, 1947).]]

The reduction in steel production that resulted from the first and the second ''level of industry'' plans meant that a steel production bottleneck ensued which forced other parts of the German industry to fall below their own permitted production levels. The economy of the [[Bizone]] finally hit rock bottom early in 1948 as a consequence of this.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Balabkins, "Germany Under Direct Controls; Economic Aspects Of Industrial Disarmament 1945-1948, Rutgers University Press, 1964. p. 128-128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounding the problems in the steel industry and their effects on the German economy as a whole was the prohibition against importing high-grade Swedish iron ore. Until that was lifted in 1948, German steel plants had to rely on low quality local ore which required almost twice the amount of coal to process. Moreover, the Germans were also forced to sell their steel at wartime prices until April 1, 1948, which meant large losses for the industry.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Balabkins, "Germany Under Direct Controls; Economic Aspects Of Industrial Disarmament 1945-1948, Rutgers University Press, 1964. p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, attempts to "decartelize" the German steel industry also contributed to the low output.

The [[Allied Control Council]] set the price for German coal at half what it cost to produce it.&lt;ref name="Nicholas Balabkins 1948, p. 124"&gt;Nicholas Balabkins, "Germany Under Direct Controls; Economic Aspects Of Industrial Disarmament 1945-1948, Rutgers University Press, 1964. p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; From May 1945 until September 1947 the US, UK, and France exported German coal for $10.50/tonne, while the world price hovered closer to $25–$30 per tonne. During this period the Allies thus took roughly $200,000,000 out of the German economy from this source alone. In September 1947 the export price was raised but remained set at $5–$7 below world-market prices.&lt;ref name="Nicholas Balabkins 1948, p. 124"/&gt;

In Germany the shortage of food was an acute problem. According to the [[UNRRA]] in 1946–47 the average [[kilocalorie]] intake per day was estimated to be 1,080,&lt;ref&gt;Alan S. Milward, ''The Reconstruction of Western Europe''. Table p.14&lt;/ref&gt; which according to Alan S. Milward was an amount insufficient for long-term health.&lt;ref&gt;Alan S. Milward, ''The Reconstruction of Western Europe''. p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources state that the kilocalorie intake in those years varied between as low as 1,000 and 1,500. [[William L. Clayton]] reported to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] that "millions of people are slowly starving."&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A. Fossedal, ''Our Finest Hour''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany received many offers from Western European nations to trade food for desperately needed coal and steel. Neither the Italians nor the Dutch could sell the vegetables that they had previously sold in Germany, with the consequence that the Dutch had to destroy considerable proportions of their crop. Denmark offered 150 tons of [[lard]] a month; Turkey offered hazelnuts; Norway offered fish and fish oil; Sweden offered considerable amounts of fats. However, the Allies disallowed the Germans to trade.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Balabkins, ''"Germany Under Direct Controls: Economic Aspects of Industrial Disarmament 1945 - 1948"'', Rutgers University Press, 1964 p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNRRA charter allowed it to operate in Germany to assist non-ethnic German displaced persons, but did not permit it to assist ethnic Germans. In 1948, after three years of occupation, the combined US and UK expenditure on relief food in Germany through [[GARIOA]] and other means stood at a total of close to $1.5 billion (that were charged to the Germans). Still, according to Nicholas Balabkins, German food rations were deficient in composition and remained far below recommended minimum nutrition levels.&lt;ref name="Nicholas Balabkins p. 107"&gt;Nicholas Balabkins, ''"Germany Under Direct Controls: Economic Aspects of Industrial Disarmament 1945 - 1948"'', Rutgers University  Press, 1964 p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Officials in authority admitted that the distributed rations "represented a fairly rapid starvation level".&lt;ref name="Nicholas Balabkins p. 107"/&gt; (see also [[American food policy in occupied Germany]]).

==Reparations and exploitation==
{{Further|German reparations for World War II}}

The Allies  confiscated large amounts of German intellectual property ([[patent]]s and [[copyright]]s, but also [[trademark]]s).&lt;ref&gt;C. Lester Walker [http://www.scientistsandfriends.com/files/secrets.doc ''"Secrets By The Thousands"''], [[Harper's Magazine]]. October 1946&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning immediately after the German surrender and continuing for the next two years the US pursued a vigorous program to harvest all technological and scientific know-how as well as all patents in Germany. John Gimbel comes to the conclusion, in his book "''Science Technology and Reparations: Exploitation and Plunder in Postwar Germany''", that the "intellectual reparations" taken by the US (and the UK) amounted to close to $10 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman M. Naimark]] The Russians in Germany pg. 206. (Naimark refers to Gimbels book)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The $10 billion compares to the US annual GDP of $258 billion in 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The $10 billion compares to the total Marshall plan expenditure (1948-1952) of $13 billion, of which Germany received $1.4 billion (partly as loans).&lt;/ref&gt; The US competitors of German firms were encouraged by the occupation authorities to access all records and facilities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;John Gimbel "Science Technology and Reparations: Exploitation and Plunder in Postwar Germany"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947 the director of the US Commerce Department's Office of Technical Services stated before congress: "The fundamental justification of this activity is that we won the war and the Germans did not. If the Germans had won the war, they would be over here in Schenectady and Chicago and Detroit and Pittsburgh, doing the same things."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  A German report from May 1, 1949 stated that many entrepreneurs preferred not to do research under the current regulations (Allied Control Council Law No. 25) for fear of the research directly profiting their competitors. The law required detailed reporting to the Allies of all research results.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The patents, drawings and physical equipment taken in Germany included such items (or drawings for) as [[electron microscopes]], [[cosmetics]], textile machinery, [[tape recorders]], insecticides, a unique chocolate-wrapping machine, a continuous butter-making machine, a manure spreader, ice skate grinders, paper napkin machines, "and other technologies&amp;nbsp;— almost all of which were either new to American industry or 'far superior' to anything in use in the United States."&lt;ref name="JEAN EDWARD SMITH Pages 135 - 142"&gt;JEAN EDWARD SMITH, "FEATURE REVIEW American Exploitation of Postwar Germany", Diplomatic History, Volume 17 Issue 1, Pages 135 - 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The British took commercial secrets too, by abducting German scientists and technicians, or simply by interning German businessmen if they refused to reveal trade secrets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/aug/29/sciencenews.secondworldwar How T-Force abducted Germany's best brains for Britain] Secret papers reveal post-war campaign to loot military and commercial assets, Ian Cobain, [[The Guardian]], August 29, 2007 (accessed 2008-05-20)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Konrad Adenauer]] stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to a statement made by an American expert, the patents formerly belonging to [[IG Farben]] have given the American chemical industry a lead of at least 10 years. The damage thus caused to the German economy is huge and cannot be assessed in figures. It is extraordinarily regrettable that the new German inventions cannot be protected either, because Germany is not a member of the Patent Union. Britain has declared that it will respect German inventions regardless of what the peace treaty may say. But America has refused to issue such a declaration. German inventors are therefore not in a position to exploit their own inventions. This puts a considerable brake on German economic development.&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Adenauer, "Memoirs", Volume 1, p.148 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[JCS 1067]] there were provisions allowing German scientists be detained for intelligence purposes as required. Although the original focus on the exploitation was towards military means, much of the information collected by [[Operation Paperclip#Related operations|FIAT]] was quickly adapted commercially to the degree that the office of the Assistant Secretary of State for Occupied Areas requested that the peace treaty with Germany be redacted to protect US industry from lawsuits.&lt;ref name=Beyerchen&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beyerchen |first1=Alan |title=German Scientists and Research Institutions in Allied Occupation Policy |journal=History of Education Quarterly |date=1982 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=289–299 |doi=10.2307/367770 |jstor=367770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US made no attempt to evaluate the value of what was taken from Germany, and in the contracts that led to sovereignty for West Germany in 1955 the West Germans had to formally renounce all claims to possible compensation for all types of assets taken, including scientific and technical know-how. Gimbel notes that this made a later accounting practically impossible.&lt;ref name="JEAN EDWARD SMITH Pages 135 - 142"/&gt;

The property taken in Germany was without regard to the rules of the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]], which prohibits the seizure of enemy private property "unless it is susceptible of direct military use",&lt;ref name="JEAN EDWARD SMITH Pages 135 - 142"/&gt; but there are legal arguments that the Allied occupation of Germany was not bound by Hague Conventions, because if the German state no longer existed (see ''[[debellatio]]''), and the convention only applied to the occupation of territory belonging to one of the Contracting Powers then it did not cover the territories of Germany post war.&lt;ref&gt;Eyal Benvenisti, ''The international law of occupation'', Princeton University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-691-12130-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lcVOlb0wefwC&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=hague%20conventions%20occupation%20of%20Germany%20Debellatio&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q=Most%20of%20the%20authorities%20link&amp;f=false p. 93]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Patterson (2006), [http://www.harvardilj.org/attach.php?id=51 Who’s Got the Title? or, The Remnants of Debellatio in Post-Invasion Iraq] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707113110/http://www.harvardilj.org/attach.php?id=51 |date=July 7, 2010 }}, ''Harvard International Law Journal'', Vol. 47, No. 2,  p. 457&lt;/ref&gt; The [[legal status of Germany]] under occupation is however unclear, particularly as ''debellatio'' in general involves the complete dissolution and [[annexation]] of the defeated state, which did not take place and indeed in the [[Berlin Declaration (1945)]] it was categorically denied that Germany was annexed. However, the [[Former eastern territories of Germany|eastern quarter of Germany]] ''was'' later annexed and [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|its German inhabitants expelled]]).

==Marshall plan==
With the Western Allies eventually becoming concerned about the deteriorating economic situation in their "[[Trizone]]"; the US [[Marshall Plan]] of economic aid to Europe was extended also to Western Germany in 1948 and a currency reform, which had been prohibited under the occupation directive JCS 1067, introduced the [[Deutsche Mark]] and halted rampant inflation.

==The Ruhr==
[[The Ruhr Agreement]] was imposed on the Germans as a condition for permitting them to establish the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beyerchen |first1=Alan |title=German Scientists and Research Institutions in Allied Occupation Policy |journal=History of Education Quarterly |date=1982 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=289–299 |doi=10.2307/367770 |jstor=367770}}&lt;/ref&gt; By controlling the production and distribution of coal and steel (i.e. how much coal and steel the Germans themselves would get), the International Authority for the Ruhr in effect controlled the entire West German economy, much to the dismay of the Germans. They were however permitted to send their delegations to the authority after the [[Petersberg agreement]]. With the West German agreement to join the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] in order to lift the restrictions imposed by the IAR,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geschichte.nrw.de/artikel.php?artikel%5Bid%5D=50&amp;lkz=en|title=1949 - No more guns from the Ruhr!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus also ensuring French security by perpetuating French access to Ruhr coal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showpdf.cgi?path=18409996001629 France Restored: Cold War Diplomacy and the Quest for Leadership in Europe, 1944-1954] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918140339/http://h-net.org/reviews/showpdf.cgi?path=18409996001629 |date=2007-09-18 }} H-Net Reviews June 2001&lt;/ref&gt; the role of the IAR was taken over by the ECSC.

==The Saar==
With US permission, as for example given in the Stuttgart speech, France expanded the borders of the [[Saar (protectorate)|Saarland]], after the Ruhr Germany's largest remaining source of coal, by adding parts of the Rhineland and thereafter detached it as a protectorate in 1947. The area was integrated into the French economy, and although nominally politically independent its security and foreign policies were decided in Paris, which also maintained a High Commissioner with wide-ranging powers in the protectorate.

==The Soviet Union==
In accordance with the agreements with the USSR shipment of dismantled German industrial installations from the west began on March 31, 1946. By August 1947 11,100 tons of equipment had been shipped east as reparations to the Soviet Union.

Under the terms of the agreement the Soviet Union would in return ship raw materials such as food and timber to the western zones. In view of the Soviet failure to do so the US temporarily halted shipments east (although they were never resumed). However, it was later shown that although the shipments stop was utilized for cold war propaganda reasons, the main reason for halting shipments east was not the behavior of the USSR but rather the recusant behavior of France.&lt;ref&gt;John Gimbel, "The American Reparations Stop in Germany: An Essay on the Political Uses of History"&lt;/ref&gt;

Material sent to the U.S.S.R. included equipment from the [[Kugelfischer]] ball-bearing plant at [[Schweinfurt]], the [[Daimler-Benz]] underground aircraft-engine plant at [[Obrigheim]], the [[Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau AG|Deschimag shipyards]] at [[Bremen]], and the Gendorf powerplant.,&lt;ref&gt;http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/docpage.cfm?docpage_id=3403&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://images.library.wisc.edu/History/EFacs/GerRecon/omg1946n039/reference/history.omg1946n039.i0007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of dismantling==
The dismantling of German industry continued, and in 1949 [[Konrad Adenauer]] wrote to the Allies requesting that it end, citing the inherent contradiction between encouraging industrial growth and removing factories and also the unpopularity of the policy.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis L. Bark and [[David R. Gress]]. ''A history of West Germany vol 1: from shadow to substance'' (Oxford 1989) p259&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [http://www.cvce.eu/obj/letter_from_konrad_adenauer_to_robert_schuman_26_july_1949-en-a03f485c-0eeb-4401-8c54-8816008a7579.html Adenauers original letter to Schuman], [http://www.cvce.eu/obj/message_for_monsieur_schuman_from_mr_bevin-en-0fc42bca-95ef-4f07-bf54-2c23d3e015a2.html Ernest Bevins letter to Robert Schuman urging a reconsideration of the dismantling policy].)
Support for dismantling was by this time coming predominantly from the French, and the [[Petersberg Agreement]] of November 1949 reduced the levels vastly, though dismantling of minor factories continued until 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis L. Bark and David R. Gress. ''A history of West Germany vol 1: from shadow to substance'' (Oxford 1989) p260&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 West Germany agreed to join the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) the following year. This meant that some of the economic restrictions on production capacity and on actual production that were imposed by the [[International Authority for the Ruhr]] were lifted, and that its role was taken over by the ECSC.&lt;ref&gt;Information bulletin Frankfurt, Germany: Office of the US High Commissioner for Germany Office of Public Affairs, Public Relations Division, APO 757, US Army, January 1952 ''"Plans for terminating international authority for the Ruhr"'' ,  pp. 61-62] ([http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/History.omg1952Jan main URL])&lt;/ref&gt;

The final limitations on German industrial levels were lifted after the European Coal and Steel Community entered into force in 1952, though arms manufacture remained prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis L. Bark and David R. Gress. ''A history of West Germany vol 1: from shadow to substance'' (Oxford 1989) pp270-71&lt;/ref&gt; The Allied efforts to "de-concentrate and reorganize" the German coal, iron and steel industry were also continued.&lt;ref&gt;Information bulletin Frankfurt, Germany: Office of the US High Commissioner for Germany Office of Public Affairs, Public Relations Division, APO 757, US Army, January 1952 ''"Plans for terminating international authority for the Ruhr"'' ,  pp. 61-62 ([http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/History.omg1952Jan main URL])&lt;/ref&gt;

Although dismantling of West German industry ended in 1951, "industrial disarmament" lingered in restrictions on actual German steel production, and production capacity, as well as on restriction on key industries. All remaining restrictions were only lifted when the Allied occupation of West Germany ended on May 5, 1955. According to [[Frederick H. Gareau]], noting that although US policy had changed well before that; "the last act of the Morgenthau drama occurred on that date (May 5, 1955) or when the [[Saar (protectorate)|Saar]] was returned to Germany (January 1, 1957)."&lt;ref&gt;Frederick H. Gareau "Morgenthau's Plan for Industrial Disarmament in Germany". ''[[The Western Political Quarterly]]'', Vol. 14, No. 2 (Jun., 1961), pp. 520&lt;/ref&gt;

Vladimir Petrov concludes that the Allies "delayed by several years the economic reconstruction of the wartorn continent, a reconstruction which subsequently cost the United States billions of dollars."&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Petrov, ''Money and conquest; allied occupation currencies in World War II.'' Baltimore, Johns Hopkins Press (1967) p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Marshall Plan]])

'''Birsa Munda''' {{audio|Birsa Munda.ogg|pronunciation}} (1875–1900) was an [[India]]n tribal freedom fighter, [[tribal religions of India|religious leader]], and folk hero who belonged to the [[Munda people|Munda]] tribe. He spearheaded an Indian tribal religious [[Millenarianism|Millenarian]] movement that arose in the [[India tribal belt|tribal belt]] of modern-day [[Bihar]] and [[Jharkhand]] in the late 19th century, during the [[British Raj]], thereby making him an important figure in the history of the [[Indian independence movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Awaaz |first=Aapki |title=बिरसा मुंडा : शक्ति और साहस के परिचायक |trans-title=Birsa Munda: represents strength and courage |url=http://days.jagranjunction.com/2011/06/09/birsa-munda-life-and-history/ |date=9 June 2015 |language=Hindi |accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His achievements are even more remarkable for having been accomplished before the age of 25.

His portrait hangs in the Indian [[Parliament Museum]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Birsa Munda |url=https://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/picture_gallery/b_munda_5.asp |website=Parliament of India: Rajya Sabha – Council of States |access-date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he is the only tribal leader to have been so honored. &lt;ref&gt;K S Singh, Birsa Munda and His Movement 1872-1901, 1983, 2002, Seagull Publication&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Birsa Munda was born on 15 November 1875, at Ulihatu (उली हातु) in [[Bengal Presidency]], now in the [[Khunti district]] of [[Jharkhand]], on a Thursday, and hence named after that day, according to the then prevalent [[Munda people|Munda]] custom.&lt;ref name=stamp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Villages in Erki (tamar Ii) Tehsil, Ranchi, Jharkhand|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/villages/jharkhand/ranchi/erki-%28tamar-ii%29/|website=MapsofIndia.com|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=neeraj/&gt; The folk songs reflect popular confusion and refer to both Ulihatu and Chalkad (चलकड) as his birthplace. Ulihatu was the birthplace of Sugana Munda, father of Birsa. The claim of Ulihatu rests on Birsa's elder brother Komta Munda living in the village, where his house still exists albeit in a dilapidated condition.

Birsa's father, mother Karmi Hatu,&lt;ref name=stamp&gt;[http://www.indianpost.com/viewstamp.php/Alpha/B/BIRSA%20MUNDA Birsa Mumda commemorative postage stamp and biography][[India Post]], 15 November 1988''.&lt;/ref&gt; and younger brother, Pasna Munda, left Ulihatu and proceeded to Kurumbda, near Birbanki, in search of employment as labourers (sajhedari) or crop-sharers (ryots). At Kurmbda, Birsa's elder brother, Komta, and his sister, Daskir, were born. From there the family moved to Bamba where Birsa's elder sister Champa was born followed by Birsa himself.

Birsa's early years were spent with his parents at Chalkad.
His early life could not have been very different from that of an average Munda child. Folklore refers to his rolling and playing in sand and dust with his friends, and his growing up strong and handsome in looks; he grazed sheep in the forest of Bohonda. When he grew up, he shared an interest in playing the flute, in which he became expert. He went round with the tuila, the one-stringed instrument made from the pumpkin, in the hand and the flute strung to his waist. Exciting moments of his childhood were spent on the [[akhara]] (the village wrestling ground). One of his ideal contemporaries and who went out with him, however, heard him speak of strange things.

Driven by poverty Birsa was taken to Ayubhatu, his maternal uncle's village.&lt;ref name=neeraj&gt;{{cite book|last=Neeraj|title=Birsa Munda|publisher=Ocean Books P Ltd 4/19 Asif Ali Road|location=New Delhi-110 002|isbn=9788188322930|pages=3–10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZLBO_lOsnsC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=birsa+munda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ytNTU8L4GIr7rAeu-IAg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=birsa%20munda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Komta Munda, his eldest brother, who was ten years of age, went to Kundi Bartoli, entered the service of a Munda, married and lived there for eight years, and then joined his father and younger brother at Chalkad. At Ayubhatu Birsa lived for two years. He went to school at Salga, run by one Jaipal Nag. He accompanied his mother's younger sister, Joni, who was fond of him, when she was married, to Khatanga, her new home. He came in contact with a Christian missionary who visited a few families in the village which had been converted to Christianity and attacked the old Munda order.

As he was sharp in studies, Jaipal Nag recommended him to join German Mission School but, converting to Christianity was compulsory to join the school and Birsa was thus forced to convert as a Christian and renamed as Birsa David, which later became as Birsa Daud.&lt;ref name=neeraj/&gt; After studying for few years, he left German Mission School.

== Formative period (1886–1894)==
Birsa's long stay at Chaibasa from 1886 to 1890 constituted a formative period of his life. The influence of Christianity shaped his own religion.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} This period was marked by the German and Roman Catholic Christian agitation. Chaibasa was not far for the centre of the [[Vallabhbhai Patel|Sardars]]' activities influenced Sugana Munda in withdrawing his son from the school. The sardars' agitation in which Birsa was thus caught up put the stamp of its anti-missionary and anti-Government character on his mind.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Soon after leaving Chaibasa in 1890 Birsa and his family gave up their membership of the German mission in line with the Sardar's [[Quit India Movement]] against it, ceased to be Christian and reverted to his original traditional tribal religious system.

He left Corbera in the wake of the mounting Sardar agitation. He participated in the agitation stemming from popular disaffection at the restrictions imposed upon the traditional rights of the Mundas in the protected forest, under the leadership of Gidiun of Piring in the Porhat area. During 1893–94 all waste lands in villages, the ownership of which was vested in the Government, were constituted into protected forests under the Indian Forest Act VII of 1882. In Singhbhum as in Palamau and Manbhum the forest settlement operations were launched and measures were taken to determine the rights of the forest-dwelling communities. Villages in forests were marked off in blocks of convenient size consisting not only of village sites but also cultivable and waste lands sufficient of the needs of villages. In 1894, Birsa had grown up into a strong young man, shrewd and intelligent and undertook the work of repairing the Dombari tank at Gorbera damaged by rains.

While on a sojourn in the neighbourhood of village Sankara in Singhbhum, he found suitable companion, presented her parents with jewels and explained to her his idea of marriage. Later, on his return from jail he did not find her faithful to him and left her. Another woman who served him at Chalkad was the sister of Mathias Munda. On his release from prison, the daughter of Mathura Muda of Koensar who was kept by Kali Munda, and the wife of Jaga Munda of Jiuri insisted on becoming wives of Birsa. He rebuked them and referred the wife of Jaga Munda to her husband. Another rather well-known woman who stayed with Birsa was Sali of Burudih.

Birsa stressed monogamy at a later stage in his life. Birsa rose from the lowest ranks of the peasants, the ryots, who unlike their namesakes elsewhere enjoyed far fewer rights in the Mundari khuntkatti system; while all privileges were monopolized by the members of the founding lineage, the ryots were no better than crop-sharers. Birsa's own experience as a young boy, driven from place to place in search of employment, given him an insight into the agrarian question and forest matters; he was no passive spectator but an active participant in the movement going on in the neighbourhood.

== New religion ==
Birsa's claim to be a messenger of God and the founder of a new religion sounded preposterous to the missionaries. There were also within his sect converts from Christianity, mostly Sardars. His simple system of offering was directed against the church which levied a tax. The concept of one God appealed to his people who found his religion and economical relig healer, a miracle-worker, and a preacher spread. The Mundas, [[Oraons]], and [[Kharia people|Kharias]] flocked to Chalkad to see the new prophet and to be cured of their ills. Both the Oraon and Munda population up to [[Barwari]] and Chechari in Palamau became convinced Birsaities. Contemporary and later folk songs commemorate the tremendous impact of Birsa on his people, their joy and expectations at his advent. The name of ''Dharti Aba'' was on everybody's lips. A folk song in Sadani showed that the first impact cut across the lines of caste Hindus and Muslims also flocked to the new Sun of religion.

Birsa Munda started to advise tribal people to pursue their original traditional tribal religious system.&lt;ref name=neeraj/&gt; Impressed by his teachings, he became a prophet figure to the tribal people and they sought his blessings.&lt;ref name=neeraj/&gt;

==Tribal Movement==
[[File:Birsa Munda Statue at Naya More.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Birsa Munda statue by [[Nabhendu Sen]] at ''Naya More'', [[Bokaro Steel City]], [[Jharkhand]]]]
Birsa Munda's slogan threatening the British Raj—''Abua raj seter jana, maharani raj tundu jana'' ("Let the kingdom of the queen be ended and our kingdom be established")—is remembered today in areas of Orissa, Bihar, West Bengal, and Madhya Pradesh.&lt;ref name=stamp/&gt;

The [[British colonial system]] intensified the transformation of the tribal [[agrarian system]] into a feudal state. As the tribals with their primitive technology could not generate a surplus, non-tribal peasantry were invited by the chiefs in [[Chhotanagpur]] to settle on and cultivate the land. This led to the alienation of the lands held by the tribals. The new class of Thikadars was of a more rapacious kind and eager to make the most of their possessions.

In 1856 [[Jagir|Jagirs]] stood at about 600, and they held from a village to 150 villages. But by 1874, the authority of the old Munda or Oraon chiefs had been almost entirely annulled by that of the farmers, introduced by the landlords. In some villages they had completely lost their proprietary rights, and had been reduced to the position of farm labourers.

To the twin challenges of agrarian breakdown and culture change, Birsa along with the Munda responded through a series of revolts and uprisings under his leadership. The movement sought to assert rights of the Mundas as the real proprietors of the soil, and the expulsion of middlemen and the British. 

He was arrested on 3 March 1900 in Jamkopai forest, [[Chakradharpur]], while he was sleeping, along with his tribal guerrilla army, which was fighting against British forces.&lt;ref name=cipra/&gt; About 460 tribal people were arrested, of which one was sentenced to death, 39 to transportation for life, and 23 to fourteen years' jail time. Birsa Munda died in Ranchi Jail on 9 June 1900. Although the British claimed he died of cholera, he never showed symptoms of the disease.&lt;ref name=cipra/&gt; 

Though he lived for a very short span of 25 years, he aroused the mind-set of the tribals and mobilized them in a small town of Chotanagpur and was a terror to the British rulers.
After his death the movement faded out. However, the movement was significant in at least two ways. First it forced the colonial government to introduce laws so that the land of the tribals could not be easily taken away by the ''dikus'' (outsiders). Second it showed once again that the tribal people had the capacity to protest against injustice and express their anger against colonial rule. They did this in their own way, inventing their own rituals and symbols of struggle.

==Birsa Munda in popular culture==
His birth anniversary which falls on 15 November, is still celebrated by tribal people in as far as [[Mysore]] and [[Kodagu district]]s in Karnataka,&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1591329030.cms Tribals celebrate Birsa Munda birth anniversary] ''[[Times of India]], 18 November 2001''.&lt;/ref&gt; and official function takes place at his Samadhi Sthal, at Kokar [[Ranchi]], the capital of [[Jharkhand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rajbhavanjharkhand.nic.in/homagetobirsamunda.pdf Homage to Bhawan Birsa Munda on his Birth Anniversary at Ranchi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410052629/http://rajbhavanjharkhand.nic.in/homagetobirsamunda.pdf |date=10 April 2009 }} ''[[Raj Bhavan (Jharkhand)]] Official website. 15 November 2008.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, there are a number of organizations, bodies and structures named after him, notably [[Birsa Munda Airport]] Ranchi, [[Birsa Institute of Technology Sindri]], Birsa Munda Vanvasi Chattravas, Kanpur, [[Sidho Kanho Birsha University]], Purulia, and [[Birsa Agricultural University]].

[[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] winner, writer-activist [[Mahasweta Devi]]'s historical fiction, ''[[Aranyer Adhikar]]'' (Right to the Forest, 1977), a novel for which she won the [[List of Sahitya Akademi Award winners for Bengali|Sahitya Akademi Award for Bengali]] in 1979, is based on his life and the Munda Rebellion against the [[British Raj]] in the late 19th century; she later wrote an abridged version Birsa Munda, specifically for young readers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Biography/BiographyDeviMah.htm Biography for Mahasweta Devi] " [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] Official website. "&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Statue of Ulgulan]] is a proposed 150-foot-tall statue of Birsa Munda, to be built, with a completion date of 15 November 2018, in Jharkland from stones collected from households in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=बिरसा मुंडा 150 फीट ऊंची प्रतिमा लगाएंगे |trans-title=Birsa Munda will get 150-foot-tall statue |url=http://inextlive.jagran.com/150-feet-statue-of-birsa-munda-142413 |date=16 November 2016 |website=Inextlive |language=Hindi |access-date=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ulgulan, the annual college festival of the [[National University of Study and Research in Law]], in Ranchi, is inspired by the freedom struggle of Birsa Munda.

A '''Deaf American''' is defined as a member of the [[American Sign Language]] [[linguistic minority]]. Though they are [[Hearing impaired|medically deaf]], [[Child of Deaf Adult|children of Deaf people]] and a few [[Hearing (person)|hearing]] people who learn ASL can become adopted into the wider Deaf community. Inversely, "Deaf American" is not inclusive to all people with [[Hearing impaired|hearing loss]] but only those who use ASL as their primary language.

==History==
{{Refimprove|article's section called "History"|date=January 2010}} 
The history of Deaf Americans, for the most part, parallels that of [[American Sign Language]] (ASL).

Although Deaf American identity is now strongly tied to the use of American Sign Language, its roots can be found in early Deaf communities on the American East Coast, including those that communicated using [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]]. Martha's Vineyard Sign Language bloomed from necessity due to an unexplainably high number of hereditarily Deaf Americans in the area. The language became so popular, even the hearing Vineyard workers adopted it. The Vineyard language contributed hundreds of signs to the modern ASL we utilize today.&lt;ref&gt;'For Hearing People Only' (3rd Addition) By Matthew S. Moore and Linda Levitan&lt;/ref&gt;   

An important event in the history of Deaf Americans was the introduction of [[French Sign Language]] to the Deaf community at the [[American School for the Deaf]] in 1817. The many different cultures met at a confluence and formed one Deaf American Deaf culture centered around ASL. The culture transferred from student to student and from alumni to their respective home communities.

This tradition continued until 1880 when [[oralism]] began to replace [[manualism]] as the dominant approach to [[Deaf education]], almost obliterating ASL and [[Deaf culture]] in America. Oralism was the main philosophy in Deaf education until 1965 when the linguist [[William Stokoe]] argued that ASL should be regarded as a full language with all of the expressive power of any oral language. Deaf Pride began to shoot higher than it had in a century and Deaf education returned to [[manualism]] for the most part.

==Culture==
{{main|Deaf culture#Characteristics of Deaf Culture}}

=== Norms of Deaf American culture ===

* The use of [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) is favoured over secondary codes such as [[Signing Exact English|Signed Exact English]] (SEE). ASL is a separate language from English and the Deaf community rejects English-like signing.
* It is important to maintain a high awareness of all that is going on in one's environment and to help keep others similarly informed because "deaf people do not have access to the noises that clue us in to what others are doing when out of view". It is common to provide detailed information when leaving early or arriving late and withholding such information is considered rude.
* Introductions are an important aspect of Deaf culture. This exhibits the effort to find common ground. "The search for connections is the search for connectedness."
* Time is also considered in a different light for the Deaf community. Showing up early to large-scale events, such as lectures, is typical. This is motivated by the need to get a seat that provides the best visual clarity for the deaf person. It is also common to be late to social events such as meeting friends for coffee or play dates with children. This could have stemmed from the fact that until recent years, with the creation of text messaging, it was nearly impossible to inform a friend when you were running late. However, at Deaf social events, such as parties, it is common for Deaf people to stay for elongated amounts of time, for the solidarity and conversations at social gatherings for the Deaf are valued by Deaf culture. This can be explained by the fact that the Deaf community stretches throughout the entire country, so to gather means that a lot of 'catching up' is necessary.
* A positive attitude toward deafness is also expected within the Deaf community. In Deaf culture, deafness is not considered a condition that needs to be fixed. One must also realize the importance of ASL to the Deaf community. ASL represents the liberation of language minority, oppressed for many years by the turmoil of oralist teachings. That is why the language is so precious to the identity of the Deaf community.

=== Rejection of cochlear implants ===

Within Deaf communities, there is strong opposition to the use of [[cochlear implants]] and sometimes also [[hearing aids]] and similar technologies. This is often justified in terms of a rejection of the view that [[deafness]], as a condition, is something that needs to be 'fixed'.

Others argue that this technology also threatens the continued existence of Deaf culture, but Kathryn Woodcock argues that it is a greater threat to [[Deaf culture]] "to reject prospective members just because they used to hear, because their parents chose an implant for them, because they find environmental sound useful, etc."&lt;ref name="woodcock1992"&gt;{{cite book | first=Kathryn | last=Woodcock | year=1992 | title=Cochlear Implants vs. Deaf Culture? In Mervin Garretson (ed.), ''Viewpoints on Deafness: A Deaf American Monograph''. Silver Spring, MD: National Association for the Deaf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cochlear implants may improve the perception of sound for suitable implantees, but they do not reverse [[deafness]], or create a normal perception of sounds.

=== Rejection of oralism as a teaching method ===

There is strong opposition within Deaf communities to the [[oralism|oralist]] method of teaching deaf children to speak and [[lip reading|lip read]] with limited or no use of sign language in the classroom. The method is intended to make it easier for deaf children to integrate into hearing communities, but the benefits of learning in such an environment are disputed. The use of [[sign language]] is also central to Deaf [[Cultural identity|identity]] and attempts to limit its use are viewed as an attack.

The ECOWAS Court of Justice is an organ of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), a regional integration community of 15 member states in Western Africa. It was created pursuant to the provisions of Articles 6 and 15 of the Revised Treaty of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courtecowas.org/site2012/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constituting documents ==
Although ECOWAS was founded in 1975 by the [[Treaty of Lagos]] (ECOWAS Treaty),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationaldemocracywatch.org/attachments/351_ecowas%20treaty%20of%201975.pdf Treaty of the Economic Community of West African States] (adopted 28 May 1975, entered into force 1 August 1995) 1010 U.N.T.S. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Justice was not created until the adoption of  the Protocol on the Community Court of Justice in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courtecowas.org/site2012/pdf_files/protocol.pdf Protocol A/P.1/7/91 on the Community Court of Justice].&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the ECOWAS Revised Treaty of 1993 established  the Court of Justice was an institution of ECOWAS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comm.ecowas.int/sec/?id=treaty&amp;lang=en ECOWAS Revised Treaty] (adopted 24 July 1993) 35 I.L.M. 660.&lt;/ref&gt; The Protocol was amended twice; once in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://documentation.ecowas.int/download/en/legal_documents/protocols/Supplementary%20Protocol%20Amending%20the%20Preamble.pdf Supplementary Protocol A/SP.1/01/05 Amending the Preamble and Articles 1, 2, 9, 22 and 30 of Protocol A/P.1/7/91 relating to the Community Court of Justice and Article 4 Paragraph 1 of the English Version of the Said Protocol].&lt;/ref&gt; and once in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://documentation.ecowas.int/download/en/legal_documents/protocols/Supplementary%20Protocol%20Amending%20the%20Protocol%20on%20the%20community%20Court%20of%20Justice.pdf Supplementary Protocol A/SP.2/06/06 Amending Article 3 Paragraphs 1, 2 and 4, Article 4 Paragraphs 1, 3 and 7 and Article 7 Paragraph 3 of the Protocol on the Community Court of Justice]&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the 2005 Supplementary Protocol expanded the Court's jurisdiction to include human rights claims by individuals.

== Jurisdiction ==
The Court has jurisdiction over four general types of disputes: (1) those relating to the interpretation, application, or legality of ECOWAS regulations, (2) those that arise between ECOWAS and its employees, (3) those relating to liability for or against ECOWAS, and (4) those that involve a violation of human rights committed by a member state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.courtecowas.org/site2012/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=10 |title=Jurisdiction of The Community Court of Justice |publisher=ECOWAS Court |accessdate=2015-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==

== Cases ==
The Court's docket has been limited, with no more than two dozen judgments rendered annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.courtecowas.org/site2012/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=157&amp;Itemid=27 |title=List of Decided Cases from 2004 Till Date |publisher=ECOWAS Court |accessdate=2015-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since 2005, when the Court's jurisdiction was expanded to include human rights claims, the vast majority of cases decided by the Court concern human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Karen J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2560">'''Economic conscription''' is the mechanisms for recruitment of personnel for the [[armed forces]] through the use of economic conditions, particularly when geographical areas within a country are neglected in terms of their economic development, leading to a situation where a high proportion of young people consider a career within the armed forces as an attractive career choice; the premise is that if these areas enjoyed favourable conditions, this would not be the case, and that governments using this mechanism know this, and choose not to change the situation. 

==Claim and counter-claim==
The term is usually used in a pejorative sense, with critics claiming that the government could create conditions where joining the armed forces would not be seen as an attractive career choice, but choose not to in order to avoid resourcing problems for their armed forces. Governments in countries at which the charge of using this method is levelled counter that they are providing work for people who would otherwise not have any.

==Example countries==
Countries which have been described as practising economic conscription include the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. In both cases the armed forces contain sections whose purpose is to recruit new personnel. 

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, these units often recruit through the use of "careers fairs" in areas of high unemployment. In [[Wales]], it has been claimed by [[Plaid Cymru]] that "the army is targeting schools in some of the poorest areas of Wales to find new recruits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6199274.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Wales &amp;#124; Army 'targeting poorer schools' |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-12-04 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the US, teams of staff from these units visit poor neighbourhoods, particularly in southern states and other areas with a high [[African-American]] population, promoting membership of the armed forces. In both cases, the financial rewards of joining up are used as a central part of the "sales package" &amp;mdash; continued use of these tactics in poor areas proves sufficiently successful in attracting a high level of new recruits.

==History of the term==
The term was in use as early as 1915.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/connolly/1915/12/econscr1.htm Economic Conscription I], James Connolly, www.marxists.org, retrieved 23 Jan 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6133">An '''exclusion zone''' is a territorial division established for various case specific purposes. 

Per the [[United States Department of Defense]], an exclusion zone is a territory where sanctioning body prohibits specific activities in a specific geographic area (see [[Military exclusion zone]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url   = http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/data/e/9463.html | title = exclusion zone | work  = [[Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms]] | publisher  = [[United States Department of Defense]] | accessdate = February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These zones are created for control of populations for safety, crowd control, or military purposes, or as a [[border zone]], and they may be temporary or permanent.

==Nuclear disaster exclusion zones==

Large-scale geographic exclusion zones have been established after major disasters in which nuclear power plants went into meltdown:

*[[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] &amp;ndash; [[Ukraine]], established 1986.
*[[Fukushima Exclusion Zone]] &amp;ndash; [[Japan]], established 2011.
*[[East Ural Radioactive Trace]] &amp;ndash; [[Russia]], established 1958.

== Border zones ==
[[Border zone]]s are areas where movement, property ownership or other activity is prohibited or restricted by legislation. Unlike regular territory, border zones are under administrative control of the border authorities. Entrance is generally only with an individual permit. Entering a border zone without authorization is a crime or misdemeanor and grounds for arrest. Border zones are instituted to pinpoint illegal intruders, conceal and obscure and prevent interference with border security procedures and equipment, and thus aid border guards with their work. For example, Russia maintains [[Border Security Zone of Russia|sizable border zones]].

==Natural disaster exclusion zones==

Similarly, exclusion zones have been established due to natural disasters. There is an exclusion zone on the island of [[Montserrat]], where the long-dormant [[Soufrière Hills]] volcano started erupting in 1995 and has continued erupting since. It encompasses the south part of the island, accounting for over half of its land mass and most areas of the island which were populated before the volcano erupted. The volcano destroyed the island's urban center and capital [[Plymouth, Montserrat|Plymouth]], as well as many other villages and neighborhoods. The zone is now strictly enforced; entry into most of the destroyed areas is prohibited, while some areas are subject to restrictions during volcanic activity or open only as a "daytime entry zone".

==  Construction  ==
Exclusion zones are commonly used in the construction industry worldwide. For this purpose they are defined locations to prohibit the entry of personnel in to danger areas, established through the risk assessment process for a construction activity. Typically, exclusion zones are set up and maintained around plant and below work at height.

==  Protesting  ==

With regard to protesting, an exclusion zone is an area that protesters are legally prohibited from protesting in.

Exclusion zones often exist around [[seat of government|seats of government]] and [[abortion clinic]]s. As a result of protests by the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] at the funerals of soldiers killed in the [[Iraq War]], 29 states and the US Congress created exclusion zones around soldiers' funerals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-09-13-funeral-protests_x.htm Funeral protesters say laws can't silence them]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] created a one kilometre exclusion zone around itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-19308982-details/Exclusion+zone+to+Parliament+protests/article.do;jsessionid=b2CbHmRGGmsFm9NhLKCv5fGLGpxxFGZXRqsXSdpTnmFjyLM2ptL1!-1339398235!-1407319225!7001!-1 Exclusion Zone to Parliament Protests]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] states that "Congress shall make no law... abridging... the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." The existence of exclusion zones is based on court rulings that allow the government to regulate the time, place, and manner of protests.

An exclusion zone is related to a [[free speech zone]]. Protesters are required to picket in a free speech zone, thus rendering the area around the free speech zone to be an exclusion zone.

== Restraining orders ==

When a [[restraining order]] is issued, an exclusion zone is an area that the respondent is prohibited from entering—often an area surrounding the petitioner's residence or workplace.  For example, if a [[Wisconsin]] [[Harassment Restraining Order|harassment restraining order]] or [[Domestic Abuse Restraining Order|domestic abuse restraining order]] is violated, the court may order [[GPS]] monitoring of the respondent.&lt;ref name="wislegis2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Legislature 813.129|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/813/129|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=5 Jul 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wislegisexclusionzone"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Legislature 301.49|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/301/49|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the exclusion zone is entered, in violation of the order, the GPS technology is used to notify law enforcement and the petitioner.&lt;ref name="gpsexclusionzone"&gt;{{cite web|title=Databases for Wisconsin Civil and Criminal Information|url=http://www.endabusewi.org/sites/default/files/resources/ii-bciv-d_ro_civil_criminal_databases_wi.pdf|publisher=End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin - Legal Department|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Expropriative anarchism''' ({{lang-es|anarquismo expropiador}}) is the name given to a practice carried out by certain [[anarchist]] [[affinity group]]s in [[Argentina]] and [[Spain]] which involved theft, robbery, [[scam]]s and [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiting currency]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090922162511/http://historiasigloxx.suite101.net/article.cfm/el_anarquismo_expropiador El anarquismo expropiador El uso de la violencia en beneficio de la Idea by Federico Millenaar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://anarquismoexpropiador.blogspot.com/2008/05/anarquismo-expropiador-en-ro-de-la.html Anarquismo expropiador en río de la Plata] Published by ''Barricada'',from [[Montevideo]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Osvaldo Bayer 2008, p. 65"&gt;Osvaldo Bayer, ''Los anarquistas expropiadores y otros ensayos''. Booklet, Buenos Aires, 2008, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The robberies done were called "[[Confiscation|expropriations]] on the [[bourgeoisie]]". It had its major peak between 1920 and 1935 and some of its most famous practitioners were [[Buenaventura Durruti]], [[Francisco Ascaso]], [[Severino Di Giovanni]], [[Miguel Arcángel Roscigna]], and [[Lucio Urtubia]]. It was different from French [[illegalism]] because it was not thought of as a way of life but as a way of reaching political ends such as financing revolutionary activities, anarchist propaganda and the release of anarchist prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;"Se puede ver desde los testimonios de la época que, el accionar de los anarquistas y siguiendo la lógica de sus protagonistas, que la expropiación tenía claramente fines políticos. Existen testimonios de expropiadores y allegados a estos en donde se deja en claro que las condiciones de vida de estos no modificaron luego de las expropiaciones. No se enriquecieron en pocas palabras. Tampoco fue el caso de los grupos que posteriormente, y en otra coyuntura, se abocaron a esta tarea."

== Spain ==

[[Los Solidarios]] (“Solidarity”), also known as Crisol (“Crucible”), was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[anarchist]] armed-struggle group founded in 1922 or 1923 in [[Barcelona]], as a reply to the 'dirty war' strategy used by the employers and government against [[trade union]]s. It was created as a successor to a previous group called ''Los Justicieros'' (“The Avenging Ones”), created in [[Zaragoza]]. The group was instigated by [[anarcho syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]], and it set up a network in order to buy and store guns, with which to attack members of the [[Sindicato Libre]], (“Free Trade Union”), an employer-obeying organization. ''Los Solidarios'' are considered responsible for bank robberies, such as the [[Bank of Spain]] Robbery (September 1923), and for the murder of the Zaragoza cardinal [[Juan Soldevilla y Romero]] (1923). 

After that, and pressured by the [[Primo de Rivera]] dictatorship, [[Buenaventura Durruti]], [[Francisco Ascaso]] and other members fled to [[France]], and then to Latin America, where they were charged with more robberies. They returned to Europe, settled down in France, and were charged with making an attempt on the life of [[Alfonso XIII]] on a visit to Paris, so they had to live clandestinely. They were expelled from France and settled down in [[Belgium]], where they were allowed to stay. With the advent of the [[Spanish Second Republic]] (1931), some of the members that had been able to return to [[Catalonia]] decided to enter the [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] (“Iberian Anarchist Federation”), as a group called ''Nosotros'' (“Us”), holding more radical points of view than those of the FAI itself. When the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out, the group dissolved as such, but they kept working inside the FAI.

== Argentina ==

The first robbery in Argentina for anarchist political ends was executed by the [[Russia]]n Germán Boris Wladimirovich in 1919. The purpose was to obtain financing for pamphlets which could explain the situation of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]. The robbery failed and Wladimirovich was arrested along with his collaborator Andrés Babby.

[[Image:Severino di Giovanni.jpg|180px|left|thumb|[[Severino Di Giovanni]]]]Miguel Arcángel Roscigna and Andrés Vázquez Paredes, who had collaborated with [[Buenaventura Durruti]] and [[Los Solidarios]] when they were in Argentina, later executed a series of bombings against United States interests in response to the execution of [[Sacco and Vanzetti]]. In this campaign, the notorious Italian expropiator [[Severino Di Giovanni]] joined in. Roscigna y Vázquez Paredes alongside Antonio Moretti and Vicente Moretti carried out a robbery on the Rawson Hospital of Buenos Aires in October, 1927, where they obtained the amount of 141.000 pesos. According to historian Oswaldo Bayer, Roscigna, with this money they financed the counterfeiting of argentinian currency.&lt;ref name="Osvaldo Bayer 2008, p. 65"/&gt;

The Moretti brothers and three [[Catalan people|Catalans]] recommended by  Durruti decided to rob the Cambio Messina in [[Montevideo]], with an outcome of 3 deaths and only 4000 pesos. They ended up being arrested but shortly put in practice a spectacular jailbreak. Di Giovanni started publishing a magazine called ''Culmine'' and anarchist propaganda, all of which was financed partly by robberies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090922155914/http://historiasigloxx.suite101.net/article.cfm/anarquismo_en_la_argentina Anarquismo en la Argentina Di Giovanni, el expropiador by Federico Millenaar]&lt;/ref&gt; The anarcho-syndicalist publication La Protesta started criticizing Di Giovanni and his group in strong terms even going as far as accusing him of being a spy and a police agent. Rosigna continued the expropriations but with the purpose of aiding anarchist prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Osvaldo Bayer, ''Los anarquistas expropiadores y otros ensayos''. Booklet, Buenos Aires, 2008, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; This money was used for liberating the anarchists in the Punta Carretas prison. The expropriative anarchists also carried out reprisals against police and state agents who attacked the anarchist movement. Before being arrested Di Giovanni published Anarchia also with "expropriations". He ended up being executed alongside Paulino Scarfó.

The '''Farmer Field School''' ('''FFS''') is a group-based learning process that has been used by a number of governments, NGOs and international agencies to promote [[Integrated Pest Management]] (IPM). The first FFS were designed and managed by the UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] in Indonesia in 1989 since then more than two million farmers across Asia have participated in this type of learning. 

The Farmer Field School brings together concepts and methods from [[agroecology]], [[experiential education]] and [[community development]]. As a result, hundreds of thousands of [[rice]] farmers in countries such as China, India, Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam have been able to reduce the use of [[pesticides]] and improve the [[sustainability]] of crop yields. The FFS has produced other developmental benefits that are broadly described as '[[empowerment]]': FFS alumni in a number of countries are involved in a wide range of self-directed activities including research, training, marketing and advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;'''From farmers field schools to community IPM: scaling up the IPM movement''', Russ Dilts. 2001. LEISA magazine. 17/3 [http://www.communityipm.org/docs/Dilts-Scaling_Up_IPM.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Almost one third of the world's population are members of farming households in Asia. Most of these farming families are small holders. Forty years ago, the [[Green Revolution]] was launched  with the aim of improving the productivity of small farmers.  By improving access to water, improved varieties, and other inputs, the Green Revolution helped to double average rice yields between the 1960s and the 1990s. 
 
During the 1970s it became increasingly apparent that pest resistance and resurgence caused by the indiscriminate use of [[insecticides]] posed an immediate threat to the gains of the Green Revolution. At the same time, research was being conducted that demonstrated the viability of [[biological control]] of major rice pests. However, gaps still existed between the science generated in research institutions and common farmer practice conditioned by years of aggressive promotion of pesticide use. Over the ensuing years, a number of approaches were tried to bring [[integrated pest management]] (IPM) to small farmers - particularly rice farmers – in Asia, with mixed results. Some experts claimed that the principles of IPM were too complex for small farmers to master, and that centrally designed messages were still the only way to convince farmers to change their practices.

By the end of the 1980s, a new approach to farmer training emerged in Indonesia called the 'Farmer Field School' (FFS). The broad problem which these field schools were designed to address was a lack of knowledge among Asian farmers relating to [[agroecology]], particularly the relationship between insect pests and beneficial insects.&lt;ref&gt;'''Ecological Basis for Low-toxicity Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in Rice and Vegetables''', Kevin Gallagher et al. In, Jules Pretty, ''The Pesticide Detox''. 2005. Earthscan [http://shop.earthscan.co.uk/ProductDetails/mcs/productID/335/groupID/6/categoryID/3/v/c55d58d5-f3b5-4009-ad33-0f5ef5328328]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The implementation of projects using the FFS approach led to a deeper understanding of the problem and its causes. It was recognised that sustainable agricultural development required more than just the acquisition of ecological knowledge by individual farmers. It also required the development of a capability for generating, adapting and extending this knowledge within farming communities. The weakness of this capability in most farming communities is itself an important problem; one which has often been exacerbated by earlier agricultural development programmes that fostered a dependency on external sources of expertise. 

This deeper understanding of the problem was first recognised by farmers in [[Indonesia]] who graduated from FFS but realised there was more they could do to improve rural livelihoods. They started to organise new groups, alliances, networks and associations, and became involved in planning and implementing their own interventions. These interventions were highly diverse, ranging from research and training, to marketing and advocacy work. In response to the activities of these groups, IPM projects started to support the idea of 'Community IPM', which gave considerable attention to organisational issues rather than focussing solely on technological and educational aspects of IPM.&lt;ref&gt;'''Kaligondang: A Case History of an IPM Sub-district''', Susianto, A, Purwadi, D, Pontius, J. 1998. FAO [http://www.communityipm.org/docs/Kaligondang_FFS_Case_Study.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The Farmer Field School (FFS) is a group-based learning process. During the FFS, farmers carried out [[experiential learning]] activities that helped them understand the [[ecology]] of their rice fields. These activities involve simple experiments, regular field observations and group analysis. The knowledge gained from these activities enables participants to make their own locally specific decisions about crop management practices. This approach represents a radical departure from earlier [[agricultural extension]] programmes, in which farmers were expected to adopt generalized recommendations that had been formulated by specialists from outside the community.     

The basic features of a typical rice IPM Farmer Field School are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;'''Ten Years of IPM Training in Asia - From Farmer Field School to Community IPM''', Pontius, J, Dilts, R, Bartlett, A. 2002, FAO [http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/ac834e/ac834e00.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Farmer Field Schools for IPM - Refresh your Memory''', Bijlmakers, H. 2005, IPM DANIDA [http://thailand.ipm-info.org/farmerfieldschools/00_contents_ffs.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; 

*The IPM Field School is field based and lasts for a full cropping season.
*A rice FFS meets once a week with a total number of meetings that might range from at least 10 up to 16 meetings.
*The primary learning material at a Farmers Field School is the rice field.
*The Field School meeting place is close to the learning plots often in a farmer's home and sometimes beneath a convenient tree.
*FFS educational methods are experiential, participatory, and learner centred.
*Each FFS meeting includes at least three activities: the agro-ecosystem analysis, a "special topic", and a group dynamics activity.
*In every FFS, participants conduct a study comparing IPM with non-IPM treated plots.
*An FFS often includes several additional field studies depending on local field problems.
*Between 25 and 30 farmers participate in a FFS.  Participants learn together in small groups of five to maximise participation.
*All FFSs include a Field Day in which farmers make presentations about IPM and the results of their studies.
*A pre- and post-test is conducted as part of every Field School for diagnostic purposes and for determining follow-up activities.
*The facilitators of FFS's undergo intensive season-long residential training to prepare them for organising and conducting Field Schools.
*Preparation meetings precede an FFS to determine needs, recruit participants, and develop a learning contract.
*Final meetings of the FFS often include planning for follow-up activities.

Although Farmer Field Schools were designed to promote IPM, [[empowerment]] has an essential feature from the beginning. The curriculum of the FFS was built on the assumption that farmers could only implement IPM once they had acquired the ability to carry out their own analysis, make their own decisions and organise their own activities. The empowerment process, rather than the adoption of specific IPM techniques, is what produces many of the developmental benefits of the FFS&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communityipm.org/docs/Bartlett-EntryPoints-20Jun04.pdf '''Entry Points for Empowerment''', Andrew Bartlett. 2004. CARE]&lt;/ref&gt;

== FAO support in Asia ==
The first IPM Farmer Field Schools were designed and managed in 1989 by experts working for the UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) in [[Indonesia]]. This was not, however, the first attempt made by FAO to extend IPM techniques to farmers in South East Asia.  

The FAO ''Intercountry Programme for the Development and Application of Integrated Pest Control in Rice in South and South-East Asia'' started in 1980, building on the experience of the [[International Rice Research Institute]] (IRRI) and [[Bureau of Plant Industry (Philippines)|Bureau of Plant Industry]] in the Philippines. Over the following two decades the Intercountry Programme (ICP) played a leading role in the promotion of rice IPM in Asia, giving rise to numerous other projects and programmes. By the time of completion in 2002, the ICP had a cumulative budget of $45 million, which had been spent on training activities in 12 countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam).

The ICP was not the only IPM programme supported by FAO during this period. Essential to the development of the FFS was a National IPM Programme in Indonesia, which ran between 1989 and 2000, funded by the United States ($ 25 million grant), World Bank ($ 37 million loan) and the Government ($ 14 million). FAO provided technical assistance to the National IPM Programme through a team of experts based in Indonesia, with back-stopping from the ICP. National projects were also developed and supported by FAO on a smaller scale in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China and Nepal. Additionally, the ICP launched 'spin-off' regional programmes focusing on IPM in cotton and vegetables. In total, during the 15-year period between 1989 and 2004, approximately $100 million in grants were allocated to IPM projects in Asia that used the FFS approach under the guidance of FAO &lt;ref&gt;'''Farmer Field Schools to promote Integrated Pest Management in Asia: the FAO experience''', Andrew Bartlett. 2005. ''Workshop on Scaling Up Case Studies in Agriculture''. IRRI.[http://www.communityipm.org/docs/Bartlett-FFS_Case_for_IRRI_workshop_2005.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Costs and benefits ==
[[Image:FFS Tomato study Bangladesh 2004.jpg|thumb|right|Homestead vegetable producers attending FFS in Bangladesh, 2004, organised by CARE]]There are two major reasons why it is difficult to make generalisations about the costs and benefits of IPM field schools.  

Firstly, there is a lack of agreement about what factors should be taken into account on both sides of the cost-benefit equation. Regarding benefits, should we limit ourselves to measuring yields and pesticide savings, or should we also take account of improvements in public health and the consequences of farmers becoming better organised?  Regarding costs, should we limit ourselves to the expenses involved in running field schools, or should we also take account of the wider costs of training extension staff and managing IPM programmes.   

Secondly, there is a high degree of variation in the value of individual factors. The cost of conducting a season-long field school for 25 farmers has ranged from $150 to $1,000 depending on the country and the organisation. In some cases, the graduates of FFS have saved $40 per hectare per season by eliminating pesticides without any loss of yield. In other cases, graduates did not experience any savings because they were not previously using any pesticides, but yields increased by as much as 25% as a result of adopting other practices learnt during the FFS,  such as improved varieties, better water management and enhanced plant nutrition.   

The conceptual and methodological problems associated with assessing the impact of IPM field schools have resulted in disagreements among experts about the advantages of this intervention . One widely circulated paper written by [[World Bank]] economists has questioned the benefit of 'sending farmers back to school'.&lt;ref&gt;'''Sending Farmers Back to School: The impact of Farmer Field Schools in Indonesia''', Feder, G, Murgai, R and Quizon, J.B. 2004. ''Review of Agricultural Economics'', 26(1), 45-62 [http://www.eldis.org/static/DOC11993.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, a meta-analysis of 25 impact studies commissioned by FAO concluded: 

{{quote|The majority of studies&amp;nbsp;... reported substantial and consistent reductions in pesticide use attributable to the effect of training. In a number of cases, there was also a convincing increase in yield due to training.&amp;nbsp;...

A number of studies described broader, developmental impacts of training.&amp;nbsp;... Results demonstrated remarkable, widespread and lasting developmental impacts. It was found that the FFS stimulated continued learning, and that it strengthened social and political skills, which apparently prompted a range of local activities, relationships and policies related to improved agro-ecosystem management.&lt;ref&gt;'''IPM Farmer Field School: a synthesis of 25 Impact Evaluations''', Henk van den Berg. 2004, Wageningen University [http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/ad487e/ad487e00.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite the arguments amongst economists and policy makers, there has been widespread enthusiasm for IPM and FFS among farmers and development practitioners in a number of Asian countries. Participation in FFS has always been voluntary, and none of the IPM projects and programmes supported by FAO provided financial incentives to participants. On the contrary, participation in FFS has always involved a considerable cost in terms of time and effort. Despite these costs, two million farmers decided to participate. In most countries, the demand for places on a field school has been ahead of supply, and drop-out rates have been very low.  Furthermore, there  are many examples of farmers who decided to train other members of their community and continue working as a group after the training came to an end.

The '''Gadsden flag''' is a [[History of the flags of the United States#Historical flags|historical American flag]] with a yellow field depicting a [[rattlesnake]] coiled and ready to strike. Positioned below the rattlesnake are the words "DONT TREAD ON ME."{{refn|group=note|During the 18th century, when contractions were coming into widespead use, they were often written without an apostrophe and some forms survive today such as ''made'' for ''maked'' and ''had'' for ''haved''. The standard form for the contraction of "do not" later came to include the apostrophe.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lowth, A Short Introduction to English Grammar: With Critical Notes. 1794. pp. 67, 79.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The flag is named after American general and politician [[Christopher Gadsden]] (1724–1805), who designed it in 1775 during the [[American Revolution]]. It was used by the [[Continental Marines]] as an early motto flag, along with the [[Moultrie flag]].

==History==
===Snake symbolism===
[[File:Benjamin Franklin - Join or Die.jpg|thumb|Benjamin Franklin's ''[[Join, or Die]]'' cartoon|alt=|left]]

The [[timber rattlesnake]] can be found in the area of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]]. Its use as a symbol of the American colonies can be traced back to the publications of [[Benjamin Franklin]]. In 1751, he made the first reference to the rattlesnake in a satirical commentary published in his ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette (newspaper)|Pennsylvania Gazette]]''. It had been the policy of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] to send convicted criminals to the Americas, so Franklin suggested that they thank the British by sending rattlesnakes to Britain.&lt;ref name="LeepsonDeMille2006"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leepson |first1=Marc |last2=DeMille |first2=Nelson |title=Flag: An American Biography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qqjzyyZjYTEC&amp;pg=PA12 |date=May 30, 2006 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-312-32309-7 |page=12 |accessdate=August 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1754, during the [[French and Indian War]], Franklin published his [[Join, or Die|famous woodcut of a snake]] cut into eight sections. It represented the colonies, with New England joined together as the head and [[South Carolina Colony|South Carolina]] as the tail, following their order along the coast. Under the snake was the message "[[Join, or Die]]". This was the first [[political cartoon]] published in an American newspaper.

As the American colonies came to identify more with their own communities and the concept of liberty, rather than as vassals of the British empire, icons that were unique to the Americas became increasingly popular. The rattlesnake, like the [[bald eagle]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]], came to symbolize American ideals and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston-tea-party.org/mohawks.html |title=Mohawk was Emerging as a Symbol of Liberty in the New Land |publisher=Boston-tea-party.org |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://statesymbolsusa.org/symbol-or-officially-designated-item/state-bird/american-bald-eagle|title=Bald Eagle {{!}} National Bird|website=statesymbolsusa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[American Revolution]] grew, the snake began to see more use as a symbol of the colonies. In 1774, [[Paul Revere]] added Franklin's iconic cartoon to the nameplate of [[Isaiah Thomas (publisher)|Isaiah Thomas]]' paper, the ''[[Massachusetts Spy]]'', depicted there as fighting a British [[dragon]].&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/us.capitol/s1.html#gadsden |title=A More Perfect Union: Symbolizing the National Union of States |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=August 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 1775, Benjamin Franklin published an essay in the ''[[Pennsylvania Journal]]'' under the pseudonym ''American Guesser'' in which he suggested that the rattlesnake was a good symbol for the American spirit.

The rattlesnake symbol was first officially adopted by the Continental Congress in 1778 when it approved the design for the official Seal of the War Office (at that time and for many years thereafter, the War Office was a term associated with the Headquarters of the Army). At the top center of the Seal is a rattlesnake holding a banner which says: "This We'll Defend". According to the US Army's Institute of Heraldry, "'This We'll Defend,' on a scroll held by the rattlesnake is a symbol depicted on some American colonial flags and signifies the Army's constant readiness to defend and preserve the United States.' This design of the War Office Seal was carried forward—with some minor modifications—into the subsequent designs for the War Department's Seal, and the [[Seal and emblem of the United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army's Seal, Emblem and Flag]]. As such, the rattlesnake symbol has been in continuous official use by the US Army for over 236 years.

===Gadsden's flag===
[[File:1885 History of US flags med.jpg|thumb|Gadsden's flag in an 1885 [[textbook|schoolbook]]]]

In fall 1775, the [[Continental Navy]] was established by General [[George Washington]] in his role as Commander in Chief of all Continental Forces, before [[Esek Hopkins]] was named Commodore of the Navy. The Navy began with seven ships, often called "Washington Cruisers", that flew the "[[Pine Tree Flag|Liberty Tree Flag]]", depicting a green pine tree with the motto "Appeal to Heaven". This is according to the October 20, 1775 letter of Washington's aide Colonel Joseph Reed, which is stored in the Library of Congress.
&lt;!--The illustration on this page shows four flags. The one in the upper left is a common artist's rendition, where the motto is incorrect. The correct motto is "Appeal to Heaven", not "AN APPEAL TO HEAVEN" according to the letter from Washington's aide. [[Caslon]] was the common typeface of the day, used on both the Declaration and the Constitution, not the sans serif typeface shown on the flag image.{{cn}}{{or}}--&gt;

Those first ships were used to intercept incoming British ships carrying war supplies to the British troops in the colonies both to deprive the British of the supplies and to supply to the Continental Army. One ship captured by Captain John Manley had 30,000 pairs of shoes on it. However, the admiralty agent demanded his {{frac|2|1|2}} per cent commission before he would release the cargo for Washington's army, so many soldiers marched barefoot in the snow. To aid in this, the [[Second Continental Congress]] authorized the mustering of five companies of Marines to accompany the Navy on their first mission. The first Marines enlisted in the city of [[Philadelphia]], and they carried drums painted yellow, depicting a coiled rattlesnake with thirteen rattles, and the motto "Don't Tread on Me." This is the first recorded mention of the future Gadsden flag's symbolism.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

At the Congress, [[Continental Army|Continental]] [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Christopher Gadsden represented his home state of [[South Carolina]]. He was one of seven members of the Marine Committee who were outfitting the first naval mission.&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;{{cite book |title=Our flag number: with 1197 flags in full colors and 300 additional illustrations in black and white |year=1917 |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=22s9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA289 |author1=Byron McCandless |author2=Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor |accessdate=August 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|289}}

Before the departure of that first mission in December 1775, the newly appointed [[commander-in-chief]] of the Navy, [[Commodore (USN)|Commodore]] [[Esek Hopkins]], received the yellow rattlesnake flag from Gadsden to serve as the distinctive personal standard of his flagship. It was displayed at the mainmast.&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt;{{rp|289}} Hopkins had previously led [[The United Companies of the Train of Artillery of the Town of Providence]], before being appointed to lead the Navy.  The 1775 flag of the Providence Train of Artillery's featured a coiled timber rattlesnake and the motto "Do Not Tread on Me" along with an anchor, cannons and the motto "In God We Hope" on a gold background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://classroom.monticello.org/media-item/flag-of-the-united-train-of-artillery-of-providence/|title=Flag of the United Train of Artillery of Providence - The Monticello Classroom|author=|date=|website=classroom.monticello.org|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The flag presented to Hopkins as Commander of the Continental Navy is a simplified version of that design.

Gadsden also presented a copy of this flag to the [[South Carolina General Assembly|Congress]] of South Carolina in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. This was recorded in the South Carolina congressional journals on February 9, 1776:

Gadsden presented to the Congress an elegant standard, such as is to be used by the commander in chief of the American Navy; being a yellow field, with a lively representation of a rattlesnake in the middle in the attitude of going to strike and these words underneath, "Don't tread on me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hicks |first=Frederick Cocks |title=The flag of the United States |date=1918 |publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]] |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxYvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA23 |accessdate=August 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

===Variations in appearance===
Many variations of the Gadsden flag exist:
* The motto sometimes includes an apostrophe in the word "Don't" and sometimes does not. Early written discussions uniformly include an apostrophe; however, as early as 1917, a flag reference book includes a picture of a version without the apostrophe.&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt;{{rp|339}}
* The typeface used for the motto is sometimes a serif typeface and other times sans-serif.
* The rattlesnake sometimes is shown as resting on a green ground, presumably grassy, and sometimes not. The green grass seems to be a recent addition; representations dating from 1885 and 1917 do not display anything below the rattlesnake.
* The rattlesnake usually faces to the left, and the early representations mentioned above face left. However, some versions of the flag show the snake facing to the right.

==Other rattlesnake flags==
[[File:Culpeper_Minutemen flag.svg|thumb|Culpeper Minutemen flag]]
[[Image:Flag of Alabama (1861, reverse).svg|thumb|Reverse of the 1861 [[flag of Alabama]]]]
The [[Culpeper Minutemen]] flag has a coiled rattlesnake and the same motto as the Gadsden flag. It has a white field, rather than yellow, and the additional motto "Liberty or Death" and the name "The Culpeper Minute Men". It is the flag of Virginia volunteers from the Culpeper area.

The John Proctor's Regiment flag of 1st Battalion Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, had a coiled rattlesnake shown on its flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heinzhistorycenter.org/franklin/_upload/files/Fort%20Pitt%20Flag%20Story%20-%20Western%20Pa.%20History%20Magazine.pdf |title=A Rattlesnake Flag of the American revolution |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020151804/http://www.heinzhistorycenter.org/franklin/_upload/files/Fort%20Pitt%20Flag%20Story%20-%20Western%20Pa.%20History%20Magazine.pdf |archivedate=October 20, 2013 |accessdate=August 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The United Companies of the Train of Artillery of the Town of Providence]] already used a coiled rattlesnake on a field of gold with the motto "Do Not Tread On Me" on its flag. Before Esek Hopkins was named the first Commodore of the American Navy by the Continental Congress he served as a Brigadier General of the Rhode Island Militia Artillery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~rigenweb/Providence/article286.html|title=RootsWeb.com Home Page|author=|date=|website=www.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would have been familiar with the design of the flag.

All four of the American-designed "Rattlesnake Flags" show a ''coiled'' rattlesnake. The only other rattlesnake flag, the [[First Navy Jack]], was "designed by" the English artist Thomas Hart as background art.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The traditional version of the First Navy Jack has an uncoiled rattlesnake and the same motto as the Gadsden flag, on a field of 13 horizontal red and white stripes. Flag experts ([[Vexillology|vexillologists]]) speculate that the English artist Thomas Hart either did not know about the practice of rattlesnakes to coil in defense, or did, and intended to insult the fledgling American Navy as a weak and vulnerable creature as a rattlesnake is when not coiled and ready to strike, slithering on the ground, trying to escape, with its motto "[Please] Don't Tread on Me!"
However, others{{who|date=August 2013}} suggest the snake pictured on the flag was being provoked, and is striking. Hence the warning, "Don't tread on me [or I will strike]".{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Modern use==

[[File:Don't tread on me.jpg|thumb|Celebrating with the Gadsden flag, early morning, May 2, 2011, hours after the announcement of [[Reactions to the death of Osama bin Laden|Osama bin Laden's death]]]]

Considered one of the first flags of the United States, the flag was later replaced by the current [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]] (or [[Old Glory]]) flag. Since the Revolution, the flag has seen resurgences as a symbol of American [[patriotism]], disagreement with government, or support for civil liberties.

The [[First Navy Jack]], which was not directly related to the Gadsden flag, has been in use by the [[United States Navy]] since its beginnings. Unlike the Liberty Tree Flag with the letter by Colonel Joseph Reed that describes it, there is no document that describes the Snake on Stripes flag, only an image by English artist Thomas Hart in the background of a portrait of Commodore Esek Hopkins. In that same painting is a round "tree flag". The triangular Liberty Tree flag is derived from the only surviving tree flag from the Revolution, found in an old trunk in 1993 on Long Island, the 5th Regt. Connecticut Militia. The Snake on Stripes flag was included in a book of flags by Admiral Preble, but later Preble determined the flag not valid, so he removed it from his text. However, the book publisher used the old color plates, so the image was continued in the new edition and subsequently picked up by other publications and ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In preparation for the 1976 bicentennial year, staff officers in the Secretary of the Navy's office sought a powerful image for the Navy's Bicentennial. One Navy officer saw the Snake on Stripes Flag in ''Webster's Dictionary'', so the staff officers ordered a large number to give away as Navy promotional items and then turned to the Naval Historical Center to "get the history". They were told that the flag had probably never flown during the Revolution, based on Admiral Preble's later discoveries, but a decision was made to use the Snake on Stripes Flag, or the "Fake Snake Flag", anyway. Beginning in 1975, commissioned Navy ships flew this Jack in place of the Naval Jack (officially known as the Union Jack, not to be confused with the United Kingdom's flag) at the bow. In 1977, the [[Secretary of the Navy]] directed that the ship in active status with the longest total period of active service shall display the First Navy Jack until decommissioned or transferred to inactive service, at which time the flag shall be passed to the next ship in line with appropriate honors. The display of this jack by the oldest ship in the fleet is intended as a form of recognition to promote pride of service, enhance morale, and contribute to the tradition of naval service. [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|USS ''Enterprise'']] (CVN 65) became the oldest active ship in the United States Navy upon the decommissioning of [[USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63)|USS ''Kitty Hawk'']] (CV 63) on May 12, 2009. ''Enterprise'' is only the third [[aircraft carrier]] ever to hold the honor of flying the [[First Navy Jack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Don't Tread on Me Flag History |url=http://www.navyjack.info/history.html |accessdate=August 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the first [[Patriot Day]] on September 11, 2002, which commemorates the lives lost in the [[September 11 attack]]s, the rattlesnake from the flag is also shown on the [[United States Army|US Army]]'s [[Drill Sergeant Identification Badge]]. After the Snake on Stripes Flag became the Navy's symbol for the Global War on Terrorism, flag history professionals{{vague|date=August 2013}} ([[vexillology|vexillologists]]) have done extensive research papers that further question the claim that the flag ever flew during the American Revolution, yet it continues to fly at the bow of American warships today.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

For historical reasons, the Gadsden flag is still popularly flown in Charleston, South Carolina, the city where Christopher Gadsden first presented the flag and where it was commonly used during the revolution, along with the [[Flag of South Carolina|blue and white crescent flag]] of pre-Civil War [[South Carolina]].

Athletic apparel company [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] uses the image of a rattlesnake coiled around a soccer ball for an ongoing, patriotic "Don't Tread on Me" campaign in support of the [[United States men's national soccer team]]. The phrase has become a rallying cry for American soccer fans and the Gadsden flag can occasionally be seen at national team games. A representation of the rattlesnake is contained on the inside of their uniforms, over the heart, with the initials "D.T.O.M.", which were used in the [[2010 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/yhst-96316601417599_2105_1874656 |title=USA Men's Soccer Kit |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008210657/http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/yhst-96316601417599_2105_1874656 |archivedate=October 8, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hideo Kojima]]'s video game ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' a variation of the flag can be seen on one of the connecting bridges of the "Big Shell" facility, in a reference to both the original meaning and usage of the flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lparchive.org/Metal-Gear-Solid-2-(Screenshot)/Update%2021/mgs2_4_6fc.jpg|title=Screenshot of Sons of Liberty Flag|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic]] 2006 [[CBS]] TV drama ''[[Jericho (2006 TV series)|Jericho]]'', the flag makes several appearances, most notably in [[Patriots and Tyrants|the series finale]] as Jericho's acting mayor takes down the flag of the "Allied States of America", which had been flying at the town hall following a federal coup. He replaces the red, white, and blue flag of the central government with a Gadsden Flag which the previous mayor had kept framed in his office.

American heavy metal band [[Metallica]] recorded a song called "[[Don't Tread on Me (Metallica song)|Don't Tread on Me]]" on their [[Metallica (album)|self-titled fifth studio album]], released in 1991. The album cover features a dark grey picture of a coiled rattlesnake like the one found on the Gadsden Flag. The song's lyrics refer to political phrases from the [[American Revolutionary War]].

"Don't Tread On Me" is a song from hard rock supergroup Damn Yankees on their 1992 studio album Don't Tread.

In addition, in the hit series The West Wing, Sam Seaborn's office displays the flag hanging above his cabinet.

[[NASCAR]] driver [[Carl Edwards]] displayed the Gadsden Flag next to his facsimile signature on his race car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://joegibbsracing.com/portfolio-item/carl-edwards/|title=Carl Edwards|website=Joe Gibbs Racing|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[WWE]], the tag team Real Americans, composed by [[Jack Swagger]], [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] and the manager [[Dutch Mantel|Zeb Colter]], used the Gadsden Flag and the preamble "[[Preamble to the United States Constitution|We the People]]".

In the 1979 novel ''[[Alongside Night]]'', an organization called the Revolutionary Agorist Cadre, seeking a Second American Revolution, welcomes visitors to one of its undergrounds: "The room's only decoration was a modified Gadsden flag draped on the wall adjoining the bar and medical areas (opposite the door), a golden field with 'LAISSEZ-FAIRE!' in an upper left corner, a coiled rattlesnake facing left with its tongue out, and in the lower right, 'DONT TREAD ON ME!'" The Gadsden flag without the addition of "LAISSEZ-FAIRE!" is carried over into the 2014 ''Alongside Night'' movie adaptation in which the Gadsden flag is used by the Revolutionary Agorist Cadre as well as the traditional anarchist black flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jneilschulman.agorist.com/2010/03/alongside-night-chapter-xiv/|title=Alongside Night — Chapter XIV «  J. Neil Schulman|website=jneilschulman.agorist.com|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A verse from the 1970 song ''[[Uncle John's Band]]'' by the ''[[Grateful Dead]]'' contains the words "Their wall are built of cannonballs, their motto is 'Don't tread on me'".

The '''Hippo water roller''', or '''Hippo roller''', is a device used to carry clean water more easily and efficiently than traditional methods, particularly in the [[developing world]] and rural areas. It consists of a barrel-shaped container which holds the water and can roll along the ground, and a handle attached to the axis of the barrel. Currently deployed in rural Africa, its simple and purpose-built nature makes it an example of [[appropriate technology]]. The rollers cost around $125 each and they are mainly distributed by NGOs.&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/26/africa-innovations-transform-continent|title=Africa innovations: 15 ideas helping to transform a continent|last=Holland|first=Mina|date=2012-08-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-05-15|last2=Tucker|first2=Ian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Mark|first3=Monica|last4=Kelly|first4=Annie|last5=Honigsbaum|first5=Olivia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical design ==
The drum of the Hippo water roller is made from [[UV stabilized]] [[linear low-density polyethylene]] and is designed to cope with the rough surfaces found in rural areas. The drum's volume is 90 liters (about 24 gallons).&lt;ref name="changemakers"&gt;[http://www.hipporoller.org/project/impact/ Social Impact of the Hippo Water Roller], retrieved 02 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It has a large opening (135&amp;nbsp;mm / 5.3&amp;nbsp;inch diameter) for easy filling and cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newatlas.com/go/6638/|title=The Hippo roller – ingenious water roller|website=newatlas.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the opening was originally determined by the availability of a large enough lid. The lid then on its part determined the roll radius of the roller, since enough clearance was required with the lid fitted to keep the latter clear from the ground and any obstacles which might damage it. The lid was eventually further recessed on later models to enhance its protection{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;!-- for the last couple sentences --&gt;.

The steel handle allows the roller to be pushed or pulled over difficult and very rough terrain. The overall width of the roller with handle attached was determined by measuring the average width of a standard doorway and sized to allow it to be pulled through freely{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}. This parameter together with the roll radius and the rounded shoulders eventually determined the average volume of 90 liters. The steel handle is fitted with special polymer end-caps to reduce friction and wear and prolong the life of the pivot cavities in the drum.

During development a water filled roller was drawn behind a vehicle over a dirt road at 20&amp;nbsp;km/h for 15&amp;nbsp;km without any significant signs of wear on both the roller outer surface or pivot cavities{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}.

The roller is rounded at the shoulders to simplify tilting when wanting to pour from the full roller. However, the roller is also very stable in the upright position when it rests on a small, flat surface. The roller has hand grips at the bottom and top to make emptying the container easier.

== History ==
The barrel, originally called "''Aqua Roller''", was the brainchild of two engineers, Pettie Petzer and Johan Jonker of [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="mediaclub"&gt;[http://www.mediaclubsouthafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=549%3Atapping-into-ingenuity010708&amp;catid=42%3Aland_news&amp;Itemid=51 MediaClubSouthAfrica: Tapping into Ingenuity], retrieved 27 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Both men were inspired by the impact of water crisis in a rural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://atlasofthefuture.org/project/hippo-water-roller-project/|title=Water on wheels in Africa {{!}} Atlas of the Future|work=Atlas of the Future|access-date=2017-05-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petzer and Jonker were recognized for their work on the Hippo Roller in 1997 with the "Design for Development Award" by the South African Bureau of Standards and its Design Institute.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sabs.co.za/business_units/design_institute/awards/Design_for_Development/1997/index.aspx#hippo, retrieved October 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Former South African President, [[Nelson Mandela]], expressed his support for the Hippo roller, believing it "will positively change the lives of millions of our fellow South Africans".&lt;ref name="Holland"/&gt;

== Claimed benefits ==
It is claimed that approximately five times the amount of water can be transported in less time with far less effort than the traditional method of carrying 20 liters (approximately 5 gallons) on the head.&lt;ref name="mediaclub"/&gt;

Claimed benefits include {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}:
* time savings (fetching water can be very time consuming in some poor rural environments);
* reduced effort;
* reduced strain (carrying heavy weights on the head every day for years puts strain on the body, particularly the vertebral column);
* increased water availability, with benefits for health and perhaps even enabling vegetables to be grown {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}};
* hygienic storage due to the sealed lid on the roller.

== Use ==
Although the Hippo roller was mainly designed as a water gathering aid for underprivileged communities, several other uses have since been discovered. Because of the Hippo water roller's water tightness it can act as a watertight container to keep valuables and clothes dry when going downstream in white water rapids on extreme excursions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;!-- is this relevant to rural development? People who can afford recreational water sports can easily obtain a suitable watertight container --&gt;

It can also suffice as a container to be dropped with life saving contents from helicopters or low flying fixed-wing aircraft in flooded [[disaster area]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;!-- has this been done before or seriously considered in the literature? If not it is speculative and should be removed --&gt; This might include food and medical supplies, warm dry clothing and blankets, and naturally, water. The polyethylene is lighter than water and will stay only partly submerged, even with fresh water in it. In fact, some rollers have been distributed pre-filled with grain or other foodstuff to villages.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;!-- numbers and names will help --&gt;

One of the draw-backs of the distribution of the rollers is that the rollers cannot be stacked efficiently to save space; thus transport capacity is wasted.

== Administration ==
[[Infotech]], an information technology company, initially sponsored the project as a social responsibility project known as the ''Hippo Water Roller Trust Fund''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Currently, the project is supported financially by donor funding which comes from individuals, corporate businesses and non-profit organization partners. [Hippo Water International] is a [[non-governmental organization]] in the United States created to raise funds there.

== Deployment ==
Around 46,000 Hippo rollers have been manufactured and distributed so far.&lt;ref name="changemakers"/&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;!-- to whom, and where? --&gt;

As part of the investigation into the alleviation of poverty and scarcity of water in the far northern parts of [[Namibia]], the Social Sciences Division of the Multi-Disciplinary Research Centre at the University of Namibia, sponsored by UNICEF's Directorate of Rural Development bought 1000 rollers and distributed them into the community. Six months after the introduction they launched an evaluation on the success and performance of the rollers as well as the social impact of the roller on the lives of the recipients.&lt;ref name="unambia"&gt;Devereux, Stephen et al., [https://web.archive.org/web/20081002041438/http://greenstone.unam.na/gsdl/cgi-bin/library?e=d-00000-00---off-0unampub--00-1--0-10-0---0---0prompt-10---4-------0-1l--11-ps-50---20-about---00-3-1-00-0-0-11-1-0gbk-00&amp;cl=CL4.1.19&amp;d=HASH013c433dd09e2f31b15e0179s1077&amp;x=1 Evaluation of the aqua roller in Namibia], June 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Holden v. Hardy''''', 169 U.S. 366 (1898), is a [[US labor law]] case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that a limitation on working time for miners and smelters was constitutional.

==Facts==
A [[Utah]] state law limited the number of work hours for miners and smelters.

{{expand section|date=May 2017}}

==Judgment==
The Supreme Court held the Utah law was a legitimate exercise of the police power. Such a law is legitimate if there is indeed a rational basis, supported by facts, for the legislature to believe particular work conditions are dangerous. It distinguish the case from laws imposing universal maximum hour rules, that were unconstitutional under the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].

{{quote|The legislature has also recognized the fact, which the experience of legislators in many states has corroborated, that the proprietors of these establishments and their operatives do not [[Inequality of bargaining power|stand upon an equality]], and that their interests are, to a certain extent, conflicting. The former naturally desire to obtain as much labor as possible from their employees, while the latter are often induced by the fear of discharge to conform to regulations which their judgment, fairly exercised, would pronounce to be detrimental to their health or strength. In other words, the proprietors lay down the rules, and the laborers are practically constrained to obey them. In such cases self-interest is often an unsafe guide, and the legislature may properly interpose its authority.}}

'''Homelessness in New Zealand''' has been linked to the general issue of lack of suitable housing.&lt;ref name=increase&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/300038/homelessness-'a-national-problem'|title=Homelessness 'a national problem'|publisher=Radio NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[homeless]] population is generally measured through the country's [[New Zealand census|census]] and by universities and other academic centres. In 2009, urban homelessness (rough sleepers or improvised dwellings) were estimated at less than 300, while rural homelessness (improvised dwellings) was estimated between 500 and 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/research-papers/document/00PLEcoRP14021/homelessness-in-new-zealand|title=Homelessness in New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homelessness in New Zealand has traditionally been reduced by the provision of [[state housing]].

Statistical authorities in New Zealand have expanded their definition of homelessness to include ‘people living in improvised shelters’, ‘people staying in camping grounds/motor camps’ and ‘people sharing accommodation with someone else’s household’.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Geertsema, Volker. "Defining and measuring homelessness." ''Homelessness Research in Europe: Festschrift for Bill Edgar and Joe Doherty'' (2010): 19–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue is believed to have become increasingly visible in recent years.&lt;ref name=increase/&gt; Media in New Zealand have published an accusatory account of the presence of homeless people in public spaces, positioning homeless men as disruptive threats. Though community members have shown support though writing opinion pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgetts, Darrin, Ottilie Stolte, Kerry Chamberlain, Alan Radley, Linda Nikora, Eci Nabalarua, and Shiloh Groot.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1626">'''Human rights in Macau''' refers to the basic rights of citizens of [[Macau]], a former [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colony that reverted to [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Chinese administration]] in 1999. As a [[Special Administrative Region]] (SAR) of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), Macau enjoys a high degree of autonomy, except in defense and foreign affairs, and its citizens have basic freedoms and enjoy legally protected rights.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mc.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Macau Basic Law]] is the SAR's constitution, promulgated by PRC's [[National People's Congress]] (NPC) in 1993. 

The 1987 [[Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration]] and the [[Basic Law]] specify that the SAR is to continue to enjoy substantial autonomy and its economic system and way of life are to remain unchanged for the first 50 years under PRC sovereignty. The [[Government of Macau|government]] is led by a [[chief executive]], chosen by a 300-member election committee, which, in turn, is chosen by a preparatory committee composed of 60 SAR and 40 mainland representatives appointed by the NPC.

'''Independent forest monitoring (IFM)''' is a tool for assessing and strengthening legal compliance in the [[forest]] sector internationally. By complementing official forest law enforcement activities with the objectivity and public credibility of an independent third party, IFM can improve transparency in the short term while contributing to the development of a sound legislative and regulatory framework for responsible forest management{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}.

Transparency was emphasized as a key element in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ([[REDD]]) by the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) at the Conference of the Parties (COP-15) in Copenhagen in December 2009 in its decisions on methodological guidance for forest monitoring systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title= Methodological Guidance |pages= |publisher=UNFCC |year= 2009 |url= http://unfccc.int/files/na/application/pdf/cop15_ddc_auv.pdf |accessdate= 2009-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

IFM has been defined by [[Global Witness]] as “the use of an independent third party that, by agreement with state authorities, provides an assessment of legal compliance, and observation of and guidance on official forest law enforcement systems.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/140/en/a_guide_to_independent_forest_monitoring Global Witness. (2005). ''A Guide to Independent Forest Monitoring''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

IFM centres around the establishment of a partnership between an official ‘host institution’ responsible for oversight of the forest sector and an appointed monitoring organisation. The monitor’s principal activity is to conduct field investigations to observe the work of the official law enforcement agency and to document illegal activity in the forest and related trade. These investigations result in the publication of authoritative{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} information on forest operations, which is made widely available to all levels of government, industry, and civil society.

By monitoring official forest law enforcement, IFM enables mechanisms of illegal activity and [[Political corruption|corruption]] to be identified. Monitors expect their evidence to be acted on and will pro-actively guard against entrenched resistance to improved governance{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}.

==Use==

IFM has been undertaken in [[Cambodia]], [[Cameroon]], [[Republic of Congo]], [[Honduras]], and [[Nicaragua]], and piloted in many other countries.

IFM has also been called Independent Monitoring, Independent Observation, and Third Party Observation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5425">The '''industrial policy of Japan''' was a complicated system devised by the [[Japanese government]] after [[World War II]] and especially in the 1950s and 1960s. The goal was to promote industrial development by co-operating closely with private firms. The objective of industrial policy was to shift resources to specific industries in order to gain international competitive advantage for Japan. The policies and methods were used primarily to increase the productivity of inputs and to influence, directly or indirectly, industrial investment.

Administrative guidance (''gyōsei shidō'' 行政指導) is a principal instrument of enforcement used extensively throughout the Japanese government to support a wide range of policies. Influence, prestige, advice, and persuasion are used to encourage both corporations and individuals to work in directions judged desirable. The persuasion is exerted and the advice is given by public officials, who often have the power to provide or to withhold [[loan]]s, [[Grant (money)|grants]], [[subsidy|subsidies]], [[license]]s, [[tax concession]]s, [[government contract]]s, [[import]] permits, [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]], and approval of [[cartel]] arrangements. The Japanese use administrative guidance to buffer market swings, anticipate market developments, and enhance market competition.

Mechanisms used by the Japanese government to affect the economy typically relate to trade, labor markets, competition, and tax incentives. They include a broad range of trade protection measures, subsidies, de jure and de facto exemptions from antitrust statutes, labor market adjustments, and industry-specific assistance to enhance the use of new [[technology]]. Rather than producing a broad range of goods, the Japanese selected a few areas in which they could develop high-quality goods to produce in vast quantities at competitive prices. A good example is the camera industry, which since the 1960s has been dominated by Japan.

Historically, there have been three main elements in Japanese industrial development. The first was the development of a highly competitive manufacturing sector. The second was the deliberate restructuring of industry toward higher [[value added|value-added]], high productivity industries. In the late 1980s, these were mainly knowledge-intensive [[tertiary industry|tertiary industries]]. The third element was aggressive domestic and international business strategies.

Japan has few [[natural resources]] and depends on massive imports of raw materials. It must export to pay for its imports, and manufacturing and the sales of its services, such as banking and finance, were its principal means of doing so. For these reasons, the careful development of the producing sector has been a key concern of both government and industry throughout most of the twentieth century. Government and business leaders generally agree that the composition of Japan's output must continually shift if living standards are to rise. Government plays an active role in making these shifts, often anticipating economic developments rather than reacting to them.

After World War II, the initial industries that policy makers and the general public felt Japan should have were [[Japanese steel industry|iron and steel]], [[shipbuilding]], the merchant marine, [[machine industries]] in general, heavy electrical equipment, and chemicals. Later, they added the [[Japanese automobile industry|automobile industry]], petrochemicals, and [[nuclear power]] and, in the 1980s, such industries as computers and semiconductors. Since the late 1970s, the government has strongly encouraged the development of knowledge-intensive industries. Government support for research and development grew rapidly in the 1980s, and large joint government-industry development projects in computers and robotics were started. At the same time, government promoted the managed decline of competitively troubled industries, including textiles, shipbuilding, and chemical fertilizers through such measures as tax breaks for corporations that retrained workers to work at other tasks.

Although industrial policy remained important in [[Japan]] in the 1970s and 1980s, thinking began to change. Government seemed to intervene less and become more respectful of price mechanisms in guiding future development. During this period, trade and direct foreign investment were liberalized, tariff and nontariff trade barriers were lowered, and the economies of the advanced nations became more integrated, as the result of the growth of international trade and international corporations. In the late 1980s, knowledge-intensive and high-technology industries became prominent. The government showed little inclination to promote such booming parts of the economy as [[fashion design]], [[advertising]], and [[management consulting]]. The question at the end of the 1980s was whether the government would become involved in such new developments or whether it would let them progress on their own.

The '''National Institute for Agrarian Reform''' ({{lang-es|Instituto Nacional de Reforma Agraria}}, INRA) was an agency of the Cuban Government that was formed to institute the [[Agrarian Reform Laws of Cuba|Agrarian Reform Law]] of 1959.

INRA also implemented the [[Second Agrarian Reform Law]] of 1963. It oversaw the development of the rural infrastructure.

[[Che Guevara]] was appointed the first leader of the Institute.

Formerly a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] socialist party, it has developed towards supporting [[privatisation]] and [[market economy]].{{cn|date=February 2018}} It believes that an independent Greenland should be [[Competition (companies)|competitive]].&lt;ref name=loukacheva&gt;{{Cite book |first=Natalia |last=Loukacheva |title=The Arctic Promise: Legal and Political Autonomy of Greenland and Nunavut |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2007 |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the party successfully campaigned in a national referendum for Greenland to leave the European Economic Community (EEC). 

Inuit Ataqatigiit is represented in the [[Folketing]] (the Danish parliament) by [[Sara Olsvig]], who is also the leader of the party.

Inuit Ataqatigiit made a major electoral breakthrough in the [[Greenlandic parliamentary election, 2009|2009 Greenlandic parliamentary election]]. Making gains from the 2005 Greenlandic parliamentary election, it doubled its total number of seats in the Parliament from 7 to 14 seats out of 31 – just two seats short of a majority – and nearly doubled its total vote share from 22.4% to 43.7%. It supplanted both its coalition partners, shifting the [[Forward (Greenland)|Forward]] party from first to second and the [[Democrats (Greenland)|Democrats]] party from second to third.&lt;ref name=bbcnews/&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; At the [[Greenlandic general election, 2014|2014 elections]] the party obtained 11 members in the Greenlandic parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141205002439/http://valg.gl/default.aspx?electionGuid=b0578019-e04f-4cde-92fa-6a3355cd383d&amp;language=da-DK Valg.gl]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jewish Social Democratic Labour Party (Poalei Zion)''' was a [[Zionist]] [[socialist]] [[political party]] in the [[Russian Empire]] and [[Ukraine]]. The party was founded in 1906 in [[Poltava]]. Members of the party participated in the government of Ukraine in 1917-20. It was part of the international [[Poalei Zion]] movement. Due to its position towards the [[October Revolution]] and being a strong supporter of the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]], the party was banned from most of Soviets dominated by the [[RSDLP(b)]], but was not recognized illegal until 1928.&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;notes by William Chase, [http://www.yale.edu/annals/Chase/chase_intro.htm The Enemies within the Gates?

The party suffered a major split in August 1919, when a dissident group formed the [[Jewish Communist Party (Poalei Zion)]]. After the JCP(PZ) had merged into the [[CPSU|Communist Party]] in 1922, the JSDLP(PZ) changed name to the '''Jewish Communist Labour Party (Poalei Zion)''' (known by its Yiddish acronym א.ק.א.פ. (פועלי ציון)).&lt;ref name="yale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopediaofukr"/&gt; Its Yiddish organ, ''[[Der proletarisher gedank (Moscow)|Der proletarisher gedank]]'' ('Proletarian Thought'), was published from Moscow 1926-1927, replacing its Moscow central Russian organ ''Evreiskaya proletarskaya mysl'' ('Jewish Proletarian Thought', 1920-1926).&lt;ref name="Bar1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arie Bar|title=The Jewish Press that was: Accounts, Evaluations, and Memories of Jewish Papers in Pre-Holocaust Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WhxlAAAAMAAJ|year=1980|publisher=World Federation of Jewish Journalists|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gurevitz1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Baruch Gurevitz|title=National Communism in the Soviet Union, 1918-28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0EjI5CvKH94C&amp;pg=PA104|date=15 September 1980|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Pre|isbn=978-0-8229-7736-0|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wiener Library Bulletin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GS7hAAAAMAAJ|year=1966|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th conference of the party was held in Moscow March 11-18, 1926.&lt;ref name="Gurevitz1980"/&gt; The party opposed the policy of regionalization of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Gurevitz1980"/&gt; The party was completely banned and dissolved in 1928 when most of its member either joined the Communist movement or quit the party.&lt;ref name="yale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopediaofukr"/&gt; 

==Participation in Ukrainian politics==
The party was represented in the [[Central Council of Ukraine]] in 1917 and in the Council of National Ministers of the Ukrainian National Republic (executive branch of the Ukrainian National Republic) the Poalist [[Abraham Revutsky]] was minister of Jewish affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\C\O\CouncilofNationalMinistersoftheUkrainianNationalRepublic.htm|title=Council of National Ministers of the Ukrainian National Republic|last=Markus|first=Vasyl|author2=Stakhiv, M.  |author3=Zhukovsky, A. |work=[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]], vol. 1 (1984)|accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Poalist, [[Solomon Goldelman]], was deputy minister of trade and industry and of labour in the Directory of the Ukrainian National Republic (state authority created by the Ukrainian National Union on 14 November 1918).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages/J/E/Jews.htm|title=Jews|last=Kubijovyč|first=Volodymyr|author2=Markus, Vasyl |work=[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]], vol. 2 (1989)|accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
Coleman started his career in 1953 at [[WCIA]] in [[Champaign, Illinois]], doing the early evening weather forecast and a local bandstand show called ''At The Hop'' while he was a student at [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]].&lt;ref name=kusibio /&gt; After receiving his journalism degree in 1957, he became the weather anchor for WCIA's sister station [[WMBD-TV]] in [[Peoria, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=WAGT-TV /&gt; Coleman was also a weather anchor for [[KETV]] in [[Omaha]], [[WISN-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]] and then [[WBBM-TV]] and [[WLS-TV]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name=kusibio /&gt;&lt;ref name=APWA2008&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sandiego.apwa.net/events/4002/ |title=Speaker: John Coleman, Weathercaster on KUSI TV in San Diego |publisher=[[American Public Works Association|APWA]] San Diego/Imperial Chapter |access-date=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Coleman and his stage crew craftsmen at WLS-TV created the first [[chroma key]] weather map ever in use.&lt;ref name=kusibio /&gt;&lt;ref name=WAGT-TV /&gt;

Coleman became the original weatherman on the brand-new ABC network morning program, ''[[Good Morning America]]''.&lt;ref name="meteorologistobit"&gt;{{cite news|title=John Coleman, Chicago meteorologist and Weather Channel co-founder, dies at 83|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/john-coleman-ex-chicago-meterologist-and-weather-channel-co-founder-dies-at-83/|access-date=January 21, 2018|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Chicago Sun-Time|date=January 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed seven years with this top-rated program anchored by [[David Hartman (TV personality)|David Hartman]] and [[Joan Lunden]].&lt;ref name=kusibio /&gt;&lt;ref name="meteorologistobit"/&gt;

In 1981, he persuaded communications entrepreneur [[Frank Batten]] to help establish The Weather Channel, serving as TWC's CEO and President during the start-up and its first year of operation. After being forced out of TWC a year later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Coleman |publisher=KUSI |url=http://www.kusi.com/story/12963605/john-coleman |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65qp1m68x?url=http://www.kusi.com/story/12963605/john-coleman |archivedate=March 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman became weather anchor at [[WCBS-TV]] in [[New York City|New York]] and then at [[WMAQ-TV]] in Chicago, before moving to Southern California to join the independent television station, [[KUSI-TV]] in San Diego in 1994,&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-john-coleman-obit-20180121-story.html|title=John Coleman, Weather Channel co-founder who doubted climate science, dies at 83|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=22 January 2018|author=Robbins, Gary; Garrick, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; in what Coleman fondly calls "his retirement job."&lt;ref name=kusibio /&gt; Coleman abruptly left KUSI while on vacation in April 2014, with no on-air farewell.&lt;ref name=sdut /&gt;

Coleman obtained Professional membership status in the American Meteorological Society and was named AMS Broadcast Meteorologist of the Year in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ametsoc.org/ams/index.cfm/about-ams/ams-awards-honors/awards/search-past-award-winners/|title=Search Past Award Winners – American Meteorological Society|author=|date=|website=www.ametsoc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coleman said that after ten years of attending AMS National Meetings and studying the papers published in the organization's journal, he said the AMS was driven by political, not scientific, agendas and dropped out of the AMS.&lt;ref name=kusibio /&gt;

== Views on global warming ==
Coleman spoke out as a "rejectionis[t]" of [[global warming]] in 2007 after watching [[NBC]]'s "Green is Universal" week, where the studio lights were cut for portions of [[NBC Sunday Night Football|''Sunday Night Football's'']] pre-game and half-time shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Homans, Charles |date=January 7, 2010 |title=Hot Air |url=http://www.cjr.org/cover_story/hot_air.php?page=all |journal=Columbia Journalism Review |access-date=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He called the concept of climate change the "greatest scam in history", and said that "the polar ice is increasing, not melting away. [[Polar bear#Climate change|Polar bears]] are increasing in number."&lt;ref name=express&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Jason|title='Global warming the greatest scam in history' claims founder of Weather Channel|work=Express News|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/nature/526191/Climate-change-is-a-lie-global-warming-not-real-claims-weather-channel-founder|access-date=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=November 9, 2007 |title=Weather Channel boss calls global warming 'the greatest scam in history' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/3313785/Weather-Channel-boss-calls-global-warming-the-greatest-scam-in-history.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Critics have pointed out that each of these claims was wrong or misleading,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=November 2, 2014|title=Weather Channel co-founder John Coleman prefers conspiracies to climate science|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/nov/03/weather-channel-founder-not-credible-on-global-warming|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; questioned his credibility due to his lack of relevant academic credentials, and said that he had not conducted any scientific research in the area of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=November 3, 2014 |title=Why does anyone pay attention to John Coleman, Weather Channel co-founder, on climate change? |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2014/11/03/why-does-anyone-pay-attention-to-john-coleman-weather-channel-co-founder-on-climate-change |newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; These views contributed to Coleman dropping out of the American Meteorological Society.&lt;ref name="obit1" /&gt;

The '''Karelian question''' or '''Karelian issue''' ({{lang-fi|Karjala-kysymys}}) is a dispute in [[Politics of Finland|Finnish politics]] over whether or not to try to regain control over [[Finnish Karelia]] and other territories ceded to the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Winter War]] and the [[Continuation War]]. Despite the name "Karelian question", the term may refer also to the return of [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]], ceded parts of [[Salla]] and [[Kuusamo]], and four islands in the [[Gulf of Finland]]. Sometimes the phrase "debate on the return of the ceded territories" (''luovutettujen alueiden palautuskeskustelu'') is used. The Karelian question remains a matter of public debate rather than a political issue.

== History ==
The Karelian question arose when Finland was forced to cede territories to the Soviet Union after the [[Winter War]] in the [[Moscow peace treaty]] in 1940. Most [[Finnish citizen]]s were [[Evacuation of Finnish Karelia|evacuated from the ceded areas]]. Most of them returned during the [[Continuation War]] and eventually were evacuated again in 1944. The Soviet Union insisted the ceded areas be  completely evacuated in 10 days. The evacuees were partly compensated for their losses; farmers, for example, received land in proportion to their earlier holdings. Usually, the compensation was about one third of the original farm. Compensation for movable property was much less. However, all evacuee families had a right to receive a small farm, and/or a plot for a detached house or a flat. The land used for these grants was confiscated by the state from municipalities and private owners. Financial compensation was funded by a general property tax of 10 to 30%, levied over a period of several years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aluepalautus.net/uusi/arkisto/2003/15092003a.htm Karjalan suomalaistilojen korvaukset Sodan jälkeeen.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408061845/http://aluepalautus.net/uusi/arkisto/2003/15092003a.htm |date=2008-04-08 }} Reino Paju 9-15-2003.

Retrieved 1-30-2008. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the vast majority of the evacuees who had to settle in the rest of Finland were from [[Finnish Karelia|ceded Karelia]], the question was labeled ''The Karelian Question''. After the Winter War, Karelian municipalities and parishes established [[Karjalan Liitto]] (the Karelian Association) to defend the rights of Karelians in Finland.

[[Image:Evacuees from East-Finland.jpg|thumb|left|[[Evacuation of Finnish Karelia|Evacuees]] from [[Muolaa]] moving towards Western Finland during winter 1940.]]

During the [[Cold War]], the Karelian-born Finnish politician [[Johannes Virolainen]] lobbied for the return of Karelia. President [[Urho Kekkonen]] also tried to reacquire the territory, especially when the Soviet Union returned the peninsula of [[Porkkala]] to Finland in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/arkisto/kotimaa/42054.html Kekkonen nosti Karjala-kysymyksen esiin 1968] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408094825/http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/arkisto/kotimaa/42054.html |date=2008-04-08 }} (''Kekkonen raised Karelia question in 1968'') {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was, however, no significant public controversy about the case, because Kekkonen wanted to keep it quiet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saunalahti.fi/~ptoukkar/lukali.htm#osa69a Kekkonen kehottaa karjalaisia vaitioloon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017211546/http://www.saunalahti.fi/~ptoukkar/lukali.htm |date=2007-10-17 }} (''Kekkonen suggest to  be quiet'') {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last time Kekkonen tried to raise it was in 1972, but he had no success, and public discussion died out in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=172062&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US Saimaa Canal links two Karelias] – ThisisFINLAND&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[breakup of the Soviet Union]], the Karelian question re-surfaced. According to an article by the Finnish newspaper ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' in August 2007, the Russian president [[Boris Yeltsin]] unofficially offered to sell ceded Karelia to Finland in 1991 but was declined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/1135229551051 Report: Unofficial offers by Russia in 1991 to return ceded Karelia to Finland] - ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' August 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to many Finnish political leaders and the Russian vice Prime Minister of the time, there were no such offers, only unofficial probing of the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Koiviston Karjala-selvitys outo asia ulkopolitiikan sisäpiirille STT 15.08.2007 [http://www.kaleva.fi/plus/juttu674074_page0.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esko Aho: Karjalan palautus ei kuulosta uskottavalta.

This price was set at 15 billion US dollars. According to Fyodorov, Finnish president [[Mauno Koivisto]] and Finnish foreign minister [[Paavo Väyrynen]] were aware of these unofficial discussions.&lt;ref&gt;HS: [http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/1135230075337 Fyodorov: Koivisto ja Väyrynen tiesivät Karjala-tunnusteluista] 5.9.2007, accessed 13.3.2008 {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==
[[Image:street in Vyborg.jpg|thumb|Many Finnish era buildings remain in [[Vyborg]].]]
[[Karjalan Liitto]] is an interest group of Karelian evacuees which hopes that Karelia will once again become part of Finland at some point, but does not openly demand it. Some smaller groups, such as [[ProKarelia]], continue to campaign for the peaceful return of Karelia. However, no serious political party has openly supported this goal, and Finnish politicians generally say there is no need for it, citing Finland's peace treaty with Russia. There are some individual politicians who support the return of Karelia, such as [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Ari Vatanen]], and two candidates in the [[Finnish presidential election, 2006|presidential election of 2006]]: [[Timo Soini]] and [[Arto Lahti]].

=== Official opinions ===
Both Russia and Finland have repeatedly stated that no open territorial dispute exists between the two countries. Finland's official stance is that the borders may be changed through peaceful negotiations, although there is currently no need to hold open talks, as Russia has shown no intention of returning the ceded areas, or discussing the question. In 1994 [[Boris Yeltsin]] commented that "seizure of Finnish Karelia" was an example of Stalin's totalitarian and aggressive politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.formin.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=53731&amp;contentlan=1&amp;culture=fi-FI Valtiosihteeri Jukka Valtasaaren puhe Karjalan Liitto ry:n seminaarissa 19.5.1998 Helsingissä].

In 2000 President Putin stated that such discussions may endanger Finnish–Russian relations, and in 2001 he said that "changing borders is not the best way to resolve problems", but that possible solutions would be "integration and cooperation".&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Prozorov: Border Regions and the Politics of EU-Russian Relations, p. 4.

In 1998 [[President of Finland|Finnish President]] [[Martti Ahtisaari]] said that "Finland's official position is that it does not have territorial demands on Russia. However, if Russia wants to discuss returning the ceded areas, Finland is ready for that."&lt;ref&gt;Martti Ahtisaari. In press meeting, Kuopio 30 July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other politicians holding government office, such as the former foreign minister [[Erkki Tuomioja]] and prime minister [[Matti Vanhanen]], have made statements along the same lines.&lt;ref&gt;Tuomioja's reply to [[Risto Kuisma]]'s question in Eduskunta [http://www.ristokuisma.net/html/kuisma2004/ristokuisma041222.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matti Vanhanen in [[YLE]]'s "Pääministerin haastattelutunti" (Interview of the Prime Minister) on 21 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polls and popular opinion===
The latest polls show that approximately 26% to 38% of Finns would like to see Karelia return to Finnish control and some 51% to 62% would oppose such a move. In Russia, people associate the word "Karelia" with the [[Republic of Karelia]] instead of [[Finnish Karelia]], which makes conducting polls more difficult. In a 1999 poll by [[MTV3]], 34% of the people of [[Vyborg]] supported returning Karelia to Finland and 57% were opposed. [[Vyborg]] and the rest of the ceded Karelia outside the [[Republic of Karelia]] nowadays contain very few ethnic Finns, and is almost exclusively inhabited by people who moved there during the Soviet era and their descendants.

In the latest poll in Finland about the question, 36 percent of Finns supported the return of ceded territories, compared to 51% who are opposed. The poll was conducted by the newspaper ''Karjala'' and the research institute ''MC-Info Oy'' on 13 October 2005. In August 2005, a poll by ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' and Suomen [[Gallup International Association|Gallup]], determined that 30% of Finns supported and 62% opposed the return.&lt;ref name="HS Gallup"&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/uutiset/tuoreet/artikkeli/1101980677358 HS-Gallup: Selvä enemmistö ei halua Karjalaa takaisin]&lt;/ref&gt; In a poll by Taloustutkimus and Karjalan Liitto conducted in May 2005, support was 26% while 58% were opposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karjalanliitto.fi/3/taloustutkimus.html  Karjalan Liitto and Taloustutkimus] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070623124037/http://www.karjalanliitto.fi/3/taloustutkimus.html |date=2007-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year earlier, a poll by STT showed 38% supporting and 57% opposing. A poll by Taloustutkimus was criticized by [[ProKarelia]] for asking [[leading questions]], such as, "Do you support the return of Karelia, even if it would mean more tense relations or even war with Russia?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prokarelia.net/fi/?x=artikkeli&amp;article_id=696&amp;author=10 Eg. ProKarelia's article on 17 October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; 5% of supporters and of those who declined to respond supported the return even under these circumstances (2.1% of all replies).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karjalanliitto.fi/3/taloustutkimus.html  Karjalan Liitto and Taloustutkimus, poll] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070623124037/http://www.karjalanliitto.fi/3/taloustutkimus.html |date=2007-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the people who were born in Karelia and were evacuated want Karelia to become part of Finland. According to polls, older people (ages 65 and up) and young people (15-25) support the idea more strongly than the generation of their parents (25–65) who grew up during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="HS Gallup"/&gt; Former President [[Mauno Koivisto]] was against a discussion about the question.&lt;ref&gt;Koivisto halusi vaientaa kokonaan keskustelun Karjalan palauttamisesta. (''Koivisto wanted to silence discussion about returning Karelia'') STT-IA 23 January 1998 {{cite web |url=http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/arkisto/Arkisto_1998/23.tammikuu/UKKKAR.HTM |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/19980224113243/http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/arkisto/Arkisto_1998/23.tammikuu/UKKKAR.HTM |archivedate=1998-02-24 |df= }} (in Finnish)&lt;/ref&gt; Support for regaining the ceded areas is also strong among minor [[nationalist]] [[right-wing]] groups.

== Problems and arguments ==

=== Price ===
[[Image:Svetogorsk.jpg|thumb|right|Blocks of flats built in the Soviet era in [[Svetogorsk]] (Enso)]]
One of the main reasons for opposing the return is the fear of the costs it would bring. According to another poll conducted by ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', 42% of Finns opposing the return list that as the most important single reason. The standard of living on the Russian side of the border is much lower than on the Finnish side. The [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP (PPP) per capita]] in Finland is about double that of Russia.

The costs of bringing Karelia to the same level with the rest of Finland have been researched only by supporters of the idea. According to a survey conducted by ProKarelia, the area has natural advantages that, under Finnish rule, would make it a centre of trade with Russia and industry and thus bring economic growth fast enough to solve the entire problem. According to both ProKarelian research and Arto Lahti's estimate, the price of return would be about 30 billion [[euro]].&lt;ref name="reform"&gt;[http://www.prokarelia.net/en/?x=reform  ProKarelia's Reform]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/cgi-bin/pika/jutut.pl?/arkisto/Arkisto_1999/3.joulukuu/base+1643  Karjalan palauttamisen lasketaan kannattavan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408094839/http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/cgi-bin/pika/jutut.pl?%2Farkisto%2FArkisto_1999%2F3.joulukuu%2Fbase+1643 |date=2008-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arto Lahti's lecture in Karjala seminar 23 August 2005 [http://prokarelia.net/fi/?x=artikkeli&amp;article_id=656&amp;author=65 abridgement]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Population ===
[[Image:Sortavalan maaseutua.jpg|thumb|Countryside houses. A picture from [[Sortavala]].]]
The area is inhabited mostly by people who moved there from [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and Russia, and their descendants. The fate of these people is a major issue in discussions of the return of Karelia to Finland. According to the poll by ''Helsingin Sanomat'', 14% of people opposing return consider its greatest flaw the tensions that would be caused by a Russian-speaking minority being formed in Finland. In 2004, there were about 370,000 Russians living in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/html/TOM_01_04_2.htm 2004 Russian Census]&lt;/ref&gt;

If the inhabitants were allowed to stay in their homes, Finland would receive a few hundred thousand new Russian-speaking people with no experience of living in Finnish society. If services for them in their own language were to be provided, Finland would need many more officials capable of speaking Russian. In ProKarelia's vision, nearly half of the Russian population in Karelia would be [[deportation|expelled]] to Russia, and even more would leave if Finland paid their expenses for doing so.&lt;ref name="reform"/&gt; However most of the Russian speaking population of Karelia were born there and have spent all their life in the region.

There are two distinct definitions of a '''land trust''':
* a private, [[nonprofit organization]] that, as all or part of its mission, actively works to [[conservation (biology)|conserve]] land by undertaking or assisting in land or [[conservation easement]] acquisition, or by its stewardship of such land or easements;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enactconveyancingsydney.com.au "What is a conveyancing?,"] ''Land Conveyancing'' website [retrieved 20 June 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; or
* an agreement whereby one party (the [[trustee]]) agrees to hold ownership of a piece of [[real property]] for the benefit of another party (the [[beneficiary]]).&lt;ref&gt;John C. Murray, [http://www.americanbar.org/content/newsletter/publications/rpte_e_report_home/rpJohnMurray.html “The Use of Land Trusts and Business Trusts in Real Estate Transactions”], ''Real Property, Trust and Estate Law eReport''. American Bar Association. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Cleanup|section|date=November 2017|reason=This section doesn't adequately cover the history of land trusts.}}
===Ancient example===
Possible earliest concept of equity in land held in trust is the depiction of this ancient king ([[Settlor|trustor]]) which grants property back to its previous owner ([[beneficiary]]) during his absence, supported by witness testimony ([[trustee]]).  In essence and in this case, the king, in place of the later state (trustor and holder of assets at highest position) issues ownership along with past proceeds ([[equity (finance)|equity]]) back to the beneficiary:

{{quote|text=On the testimony of Gehazi the servant of Elisha that the woman was the owner of these lands, the king returns all her property to her. From the fact that the king orders his eunuch to return to the woman all her property and the produce of her land from the time that she left ...&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Barak, Zafrira. "Meribaal and the System of Land Grants in Ancient Israel." Biblica (1981): 73-91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Roman era===
Land trusts have been around at least since [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times but their clearest history is from the time of [[King Henry VIII]] in [[England]]. At that time, people used land trusts to hide their ownership of land so they would not have to serve in the military or fulfill other obligations of land ownership. For example, an elder uncle would hold his nephew's land so he would not have to join the king's army. To end this, King Henry in 1536 passed the [[Statute of Uses]]. The statute declared that if one party held land "for the use of" or in trust for another ("beneficiary"), then legal title was vested in the beneficiary. Obviously, if the statute had been given literal effect, there would be no trust law. Shortly after the statute was enacted, however, English courts declared that the statute only applied if the trust was passive, that is, the trustee didn't do anything but hold the land.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===United States===
In late 19th century [[Chicago]], some people figured out that land trusts would be good things for buying property for investors to build skyscrapers on, and city [[aldermen]] figured they would be a good way to hide their ownership in land since they were forbidden to vote on city building projects when they owned land nearby. Because the law of England, including the [[Statute of Uses]], was present in US law, the question arose whether a land trust would be valid. This question went to the [[Illinois Supreme Court]]. It ruled that if a land trust was set up with some minor duty on the trustee (such as to deed the property to the beneficiaries 20 years later), then the trust would not be considered passive and would be valid. Thus, the land trust in America today is often called an "Illinois-type" land trust or "Illinois Land Trust".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=106553,00.html "Abusive Trust Tax Evasion Schemes - Special Types of Trusts"] ''IRS.gov'' website [retrieved 11 September 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618224643/https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=106553,00.html |date=18 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Land trusts have been actively used in Illinois for over a hundred years and in recent decades have begun to be used in other states. The creation of land trusts is not a recorded document, however the declaration of a trust is through a [[Trust deed (real estate)|"deed to trustee"]]. If the trust is filed as a public document, it removes all of the asset protection provided by the formation of the land trust. [[Robert Pless]] pioneered the use of the land trust that has been used by many firms throughout the United States since the early 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Canada===
{{Advert section|date=November 2017}}
While Canada has fewer land trusts than the US, British Columbia has been a model for land trust development with more than 35 individual organizations operating in the province. In 1997, the Land Trust Alliance of British Columbia (LTABC) was started and has an impressive 20-year history of providing research, education, services and awareness to the public and its members. Its website www.ltabc.ca has a wealth of information on conservation, covenants, legal issues and a directory of land trusts in BC.

=== Conservation land trusts ===  &lt;!-- linked from redirect [[land conservancy]] --&gt;

'''Land trusts''', also called '''land conservancies''' and, more rarely, '''conservation land trusts''', have been in existence since 1891. However, land trusts were not well known before the 1980s.&lt;ref name=2005census&gt;Aldrich, R. &amp; Wyerman, J. [http://www.northolympiclandtrust.org/Documents/2005LandTrustCensusReport.pdf 2005 National Land Trust Census Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724081249/http://www.northolympiclandtrust.org/Documents/2005LandTrustCensusReport.pdf |date=24 July 2013 }} (2006), Land Trust Alliance&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chang|first1=Katie|title=2010 National Land Trust CENSUS REPORT|url=https://www.landtrustalliance.org/land-trusts/land-trust-census/2010-final-report|website=https://www.landtrustalliance.org|publisher=Lincoln Institute of Land Policy|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== History ====
The first conservation land trust [[The Trustees of Reservations]] was founded in 1891. The number of land trusts has steadily increased with most forming in the last 25 years. There are land trusts working in Canada (e.g. [[Wildlife Preservation Canada]], [[Edmonton &amp; Area Land Trust]], [[Ecotrust Canada]], [[Georgian Bay Land Trust]] and [[Thames Talbot Land Trust]]), Mexico, and other countries worldwide, in addition to international land trusts like [[The Nature Conservancy]] and the [[World Land Trust]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

There are more than 1,667 land trusts operating in every state of the United States. Over 300 new local and regional trusts were formed from 1998 to 2003, with the last LTA Census counting 1,537 operating in the United States. Over 1,000 of these are members of the LTA. [[California]] now has the most land trusts, with 173 operating statewide in 2003. [[Massachusetts]], despite being much smaller, was a close second with 154 land trusts that year.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==== Aims ====

The goal of conservation trusts is to preserve sensitive natural areas, farmland, ranchland, water sources, cultural resources or notable landmarks. These include enormous international organizations such as [http://www.nature.org/ The Nature Conservancy] or [http://www.worldlandtrust.org/ World Land Trust], as well as smaller organizations that operate on national, state/provincial, county, and community levels. Conservation trusts often, but not always, target lands adjacent to or within existing protected areas. However, land areas that are particularly valuable in terms of natural or cultural resources or are home to [[endangered]] plant or wildlife are good candidates for receiving protection efforts. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loza|first1=Andrew|title=What is a Land Trust|url=http://conservationtools.org/guides/150-what-is-a-land-trust|website=ConservationTools.org|publisher=Pennsylvania Land Trust Association|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Land trusts conserve all different types of land. Some protect only farmland or ranchland, others forests, mountains, prairies, deserts, wildlife habitat, cultural resources such as archaeological sites or battlefields, urban parks, scenic corridors, coastlines, wetlands or waterways; it is up to each organization to decide what type of land to protect according to its mission. Some areas have extremely limited public access for the protection of sensitive wildlife, or to allow recovery of damaged [[ecosystem]]s. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Many protected areas are under private ownership, which tends to limit access. However, in many cases, land trusts work to eventually open up the land in a limited way to the public for recreation in the form of hunting, hiking, camping, wildlife observation, watersports, or other responsible outdoor activities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Access Policies and Practices for Land Trusts|url=http://conservationtools.org/guides/127-public-access-policies-and-practices-for-land-trusts|website=ConservationTools.org|publisher=Pennsylvania Land Trust Association|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;This is often with the assistance of community groups or government programs. Some land is also used for [[sustainable agriculture]] or [[ranching]], or for [[sustainable forestry|sustainable logging]].&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, R. ''Conservancy, The Land Trust Movement in America'' (2003) Lebanon, NH: Dartmouth College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While important, these goals can be seen as secondary to protection of the land from development.

==== Strategies ====

Many different strategies are used to provide this protection, including outright acquisition of the land by the trust. In other cases, the land will remain in private hands, but the trust will purchase a [[conservation easement]] on the property to prevent development, or purchase any mining, logging, drilling, or development rights on the land. Trusts also provide funding to assist like-minded private buyers or government organizations to purchase and protect the land forever.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

As [[non-profit organizations]], land trusts rely on donations, grants and public land acquisition programs for operating expenses and for acquiring land and easements. Donors often provide monetary support, but it is common for conservation-minded landowners to donate an easement on their land, or the land itself. Some land trusts also receive funds from government programs to acquire, protect, and manage land. Some trusts can afford to pay employees, but many others depend entirely on volunteers. According to the 2005 National Land Trust Census, 31% of land trusts reported having at least one full-time staff member, 54% are all volunteer, and 15% have only part-time staff.&lt;ref name=2005census/&gt;
When land is acquired, trusts will sometimes retain ownership of the land in perpetuity, or sell the land to a third party. This third party is often the government, which will usually add the land to an existing protected area, or create a new one entirely. Land trusts were instrumental in the 2004 creation of [[Great Sand Dunes National Park]] in [[Colorado]], as well as the expansion of [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park]] by 50% in 2003. Land trusts also sell land to private buyers, usually with a strict conservation easement attached. Keeping the land under private ownership has the added benefit of maintaining the land on local [[property tax]] rolls, providing income to the local government.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Land trusts use many different tools in their protection efforts. Land trusts buy or accept donations of land in fee. This means that the landowner will sell fee simple interest to the land trust or will just give the land they own to an organization. Landowners may also sell or donate a [[conservation easement]] to a land trust. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

A landowner that donates a conservation easement to a land trust gives up some of the rights associated with the land. For example, the landowner might give up the right to build additional structures, while retaining the right to grow crops. Future owners also will be bound by the conservation easement’s terms. The land trust is responsible for making sure the easement’s terms are followed. This is done through monitoring of the land.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Conservation easements offer great flexibility. An easement on property containing rare wildlife habitat might prohibit any development, for example, while an easement on a working farm might allow the addition of agricultural structures. An easement may apply to all or a portion of the property, and need not require public access. Each conservation easement is carefully crafted to meet the needs of the landowner while not jeopardizing the conservation values of the land.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Byers and Karin Marchetti Ponte. ''The Conservation Easement Handbook'' (2005) The Trust for Public Land and the Land Trust Alliance&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2013}}

In between selling land or an easement to a land trust is an option called a bargain sale. A bargain sale is where a landowner sells a property interest to an organization for less than the market price. The amount of value between the market price and the actual sale price is considered a donation to the organization. There are other strategies to conserve land as well.&lt;ref&gt;Trust for Public Land. ''Doing Deals: A Guide to Buying Land for Conservation'' (1995) Washington, DC: Land Trust Alliance&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2013}}

In October 2002, [[Property and Environment Research Center]] published a report by Dominic P. Parker entitled ''Cost-Effective Strategies for Conserving Private Land''. This paper identified numerous ways for operating land trusts more efficiently, pointing out that conservation easement and other tools for land preservation may be less costly than ownership. Sometimes the various rights associated with land ownership are separable. A preservationist organization may, for instance, buy only the extraction rights on a property with oil or minerals, and then rent those rights to extracters on the organization's terms. The terms might include requirements to protect the environment and pay the organization royalties on materials extracted. Many land trust organizations had already been using these strategies for years when this report was published.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==== Structure ====

The [[Land Trust Alliance]], formed in 1981, provides technical support to the growing network of land trusts in the United States. The Alliance performs a National Land Trust Census that keeps track of the land protected by local and regional land trusts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lta.org/aboutlt/census.shtml|title=National Land Trust Census|first=|last=kseese|date=13 May 2015|website=www.lta.org|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Census, conducted in 2003, reported that these trusts have protected almost 9.4&amp;nbsp;million acres (38,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of land in the [[United States]], double the 4.7&amp;nbsp;million acres (19,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) recorded in the 1998 survey. Over 5&amp;nbsp;million acres (20,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of that was protected by conservation easement in 2003. Although it does not include national or international land trusts in its Census, the LTA estimates another 25&amp;nbsp;million acres (100,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in the U.S. have been protected by those organizations. The largest amount of land protected by local and regional trusts is in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] with 2.9&amp;nbsp;million acres (12,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), while the fastest growing region between 1998 and 2003 was the [[Pacific]] (consisting of [[California]], [[Nevada]], and [[Hawaii]]), with protected land increasing 147% to 1.5&amp;nbsp;million acres (6,100&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in 2003.

=== Community land trusts ===
{{Main|Community Land Trust}}

A successful example of community land trusts is in Canada. The Land Trust Alliance of British Columbia LTABC is the oldest serving provincial alliance in Canada. More than 35 land trusts work in BC conserving forests, shorelines, wetlands, grasslands and other properties as well as many species at risk. Since 1997, LTABC has become a leader in the field providing education, research, publication, conferences, services to member land trusts and the public. Its website www.ltabc.ca is a wealth of information on conservation. 

==== History ====

Community land trusts trace their conceptual history to [[India]]'s [[gramdan]]s where villages held property in the community interest, and to European and North American [[land banking|land banks]], which are quasi-public agencies that invest in land often to help build family farms or to encourage economic development. "The ideas behind the community land trust...have historic roots" in the indigenous Americas, in pre-colonial Africa, and in ancient Chinese economic systems, as Robert Swann and his co-authors saw it in 1972. Thus, "the goal is to 'restore' the land trust concept rather than initiate it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=International Independence Institute|first1=|authorlink1=International Independence Institute|last2=Swann|first2=R.S.|title=The Community Land Trust: A Guide To A New Model For Land Tenure In America|year=1972|publisher=Center for Community Economic Development|location=Cambridge, MA|p=xiii}} 2007 reprint.&lt;/ref&gt;

Residential land trusts emerged in the United States during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] after calls among civil rights leaders in the [[American South]] for economic reforms to reverse rampant poverty. The [[Institute for Community Economics]] was organized in the late 1960s to help residential trusts:{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

* Gain control over local land use and reduce [[Absentee landlord|absentee ownership]]
* Provide affordable housing for lower income residents in the community
* Promote resident ownership and control of housing
* Keep housing affordable for future residents
* Capture the value of public investment for long-term community benefit
* Build a strong base for community action
* Preventing [[foreclosure]]

Residential community land trusts are now widespread in the United States, but seldom gain much notice beyond occasional local news accounts. The Institute for Community Economics in 2004 reported nearly 120 community land trusts of varied sizes in 30 states, the District of Columbia and in five Canadian provinces. While a few earlier trusts faltered, the number of land trusts in North America overall nearly tripled between the 1987 and 2004.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==== Aims ====

Community land trusts (CLT) rely on community members, word of mouth and strategic communications to attract new residents, members and supporters. In residential land trusts, the CLT usually owns the land, leasing it long-term to the land user who owns the home and other improvements on the land. CLTs usually retain rights to buy buildings from residents who move out of the community. The goal of residential trusts is often to protect housing prices from real estate [[speculation]] and [[gentrification]], as well as to allow residents to accrue [[ownership equity]], including [[sweat equity]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

A 2007 study showed that foreclosure rates of members of housing land trusts in the US were 30 times lower than the national average.&lt;ref&gt;Fireside, D. [http://yesmagazine.org/issues/purple-america/community-land-trust-keeps-prices-affordable2014for-now-and-forever "Community Land Trust Keeps Prices Affordable—For Now And Forever"] (29 July 2008) ''YES!''&lt;/ref&gt;  Foreclosure is destabilizing some neighborhoods as vacancy and abandonment rise and absentee landlords replace homeowners. To focus attention on the problem in Washington, D.C., [[Enterprise Community Partners]] and City First Land Trust established a real estate owned program and acquired more than 50 properties in 2009.

Burlington Community Land Trust (BCLT) is a nonprofit, member-based organization whose mission is to ensure access to affordable homes and vital communities for all people through the democratic stewardship of land. BCLT was the first municipally funded community land trust, and today is the largest community land trust in the United States, with more than 2,500 members. BCLT has become a model of locally affordable housing and community revitalization.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

=== Other land trusts ===

A land trust is a useful way to manage complex divisions of the [[bundle of rights]] that people can own in [[real estate]], and can be used to manage something as large and complex as a multi-state [[real estate investment trust]], or as common and small as a single-family home.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Corporations sometimes set up land trusts when they want to compile large tracts of land without arousing suspicion or alerting people to their plans (which would cause the asking price to rise). For example, the land for Walt Disney World near Orlando, Florida, was put together by using many land trusts to buy smaller tracts of land.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Individuals use land trusts as an alternative type of [[housing tenure]] to [[owner occupancy]] mainly for privacy and to avoid [[probate]]. Many investors buy properties through land trusts to prevent their names appearing in public records. The land trust also allows the property to immediately pass to the owner's heirs upon death, rather than go through a lengthy probate process.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Some of the other advantages of land trusts for individuals are:{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
* Sales price of the property can be kept off the public records.
* Property taxes are lower if the purchase price is kept private.
* Judgments or liens (such as IRS liens) against an individual's name are not a lien against their land trust property.
* Partners can more easily continue a project if one dies or is divorced.
* Interests can be transferred quickly without recording a deed.
* Managing a rental property is easier when the trustee can be blamed.
* Negotiating a purchase or sale can be easier when the trustee can be blamed.
* Liability on financing can be limited to the assets of the trust.
* Lease options can be placed into a trust, with the purchaser recording the option.&lt;ref name="pegasusrealestatesolutions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pegasusrealestatesolutions.com/introducing-the-equity-holding-trust.html|title=Introducing the Equity Holding Trust - Pegasus Real Estate Solutions : Pegasus Real Estate Solutions|publisher=pegasusrealestatesolutions.com|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Make loans “Assumable-like” by using a land trust. Transferring title into a land trust with the seller as beneficiary does not usually trigger the alienation clause (due-on-sale clause) of the security instrument.&lt;ref name="andersonadvisors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andersonadvisors.com/land_trusts/|title=Land Trust Formation - The Pros and Cons|publisher=andersonadvisors.com|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investment trust companies hold property for investment purposes and non-citizens who want long-term access to land in Mexico often enter real-estate trust agreements, called ''fideicomiso'', with Mexican citizens, but ''land trust'' more often refers to a community scale organization. Despite containing the word "trust", many if not most land trusts are not technically trusts, but rather non-profit organizations that hold simple title to land and/or other property and manage it in a manner consistent with their non-profit mission.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Indian trust lands differ from commercial land trusts in that there was no trust document that created the Indian trust and specified the duties incumbent on the federal government in managing the trust.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Sometimes trust land and [[Indian reservation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s overlap.

{{Democracy}}
{{Liberalism sidebar|Ideas}}
'''Liberal democracy''' is a [[liberalism|liberal]] [[list of political ideologies|political ideology]] and a [[forms of government|form of government]] in which [[representative democracy]] operates under the principles of [[classical liberalism]]. Also called '''Western democracy''', it is characterised by [[elections]] between [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|multiple distinct]] [[political parties]], a [[separation of powers]] into different [[branches of government]], the [[rule of law]] in everyday life as part of an [[open society]], a [[market economy]] with [[private property]], and the equal protection of [[human rights]], [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]], [[civil liberties]] and [[political freedom]]s for all people. To define the system in practice, liberal democracies often draw upon a [[constitution]], either formally written or [[Uncodified constitution|uncodified]], to delineate the powers of government and enshrine the [[social contract]]. After a period of sustained expansion throughout the 20th century, liberal democracy became the predominant political system in the world.

A liberal democracy may take various constitutional forms: it may be a [[constitutional monarchy]] ([[Politics of Australia|Australia]], [[Politics of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Politics of Canada|Canada]], [[Politics of Japan|Japan]], [[Politics of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Politics of Norway|Norway]], [[Politics of Spain|Spain]], the [[Politics of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]) or a [[republic]] ([[Politics of France|France]], [[Politics of India|India]], [[Politics of Italy|Italy]], [[Politics of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Politics of the United States|United States]]). It may have a [[parliamentary system]] (Australia, Canada, India, [[Politics of Israel|Israel]], Ireland, Italy, the United Kingdom), a [[presidential system]] ([[Politics of Indonesia|Indonesia]], the United States) or a [[semi-presidential system]] (France, [[Politics of Romania|Romania]]).

Liberal democracies usually have [[universal suffrage]], granting all [[adult]] citizens the right to vote regardless of [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender]] or property ownership. However, historically some countries regarded as liberal democracies have had a more [[Suffrage#Forms of exclusion from suffrage|limited franchise]], and some do not have [[secret ballot]]s. There may also be qualifications such as voters being required to [[Voter registration|register]] before being allowed to vote. The decisions made through elections are made not by all of the citizens but rather by those who are [[Voter eligibility|eligible]] and who choose to [[Voter participation|participate]] by voting.

The liberal democratic constitution defines the democratic character of the state{{dubious|date=December 2018}}. The purpose of a constitution is often seen as a limit on the authority of the government. Liberal democracy emphasises the separation of powers, an [[independent judiciary]] and a system of checks and balances between branches of government. Liberal democracies are likely to emphasise the importance of the state being a ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'', i.e. a state that follows the principle of [[rule of law]]. Governmental authority is legitimately exercised only in accordance with written, publicly disclosed [[laws]] adopted and enforced in accordance with established procedure. Many democracies use [[federalism]]—also known as vertical separation of powers—in order to prevent abuse and increase public input by dividing governing powers between municipal, provincial and national governments (e.g., Germany, where [[Bundestag|the federal government]] assumes the main legislative responsibilities and the federated ''[[Länder of Germany|Länder]]'' assume many executive tasks).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Origins==
{{See also|History of liberalism}}
Liberal democracy traces its origins—and its name—to the European 18th-century, also known as the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. At the time, the vast majority of European states were [[Monarchy|monarchies]], with political power held either by the [[monarch]] or the [[aristocracy]]. The possibility of democracy had not been a seriously considered political theory since [[classical antiquity]] and the widely held belief was that democracies would be inherently unstable and chaotic in their policies due to the changing whims of the people. It was further believed that democracy was contrary to [[human nature]], as human beings were seen to be inherently evil, violent and in need of a strong leader to restrain their destructive impulses. Many European monarchs held that their power had been [[divine right of kings|ordained by God]] and that questioning their right to rule was tantamount to [[blasphemy]].

These conventional views were challenged at first by a relatively small group of Enlightenment [[intellectual]]s, who believed that human affairs should be guided by [[reason]] and principles of liberty and equality. They argued that [[all people are created equal]] and therefore political authority cannot be justified on the basis of "noble blood", a supposed privileged connection to God or any other characteristic that is alleged to make one person superior to others. They further argued that governments exist to serve the people—not vice versa—and that laws should apply to those who govern as well as to the governed (a concept known as [[rule of law]]).

Some of these ideas began to be expressed in England in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Kopstein|editor1-first=Jeffrey|editor2-last=Lichbach|editor2-first=Mark|editor3-last=Hanson|editor3-first=Stephen E.|title=Comparative Politics: Interests, Identities, and Institutions in a Changing Global Order|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1139991388|pages=37–39|edition=4, revised|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L2jwAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=Britain pioneered the system of liberal democracy that has now spread in one form or another to most of the world's countries}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was [[Magna Carta#17th–18th centuries|renewed interest in Magna Carta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/videos/from-legal-document-to-public-myth-magna-carta-in-the-17th-century|title=From legal document to public myth: Magna Carta in the 17th century|website=The British Library|access-date=2017-10-16|postscript=none}}; {{Cite web|url=https://www.sal.org.uk/events/2015/06/magna-carta-magna-carta-in-the-17th-century/|title=Magna Carta: Magna Carta in the 17th Century|website=The Society of Antiquaries of London|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and passage of the [[Petition of Right]] in 1628 and [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Act]] in 1679 established certain liberties for subjects. The idea of a political party took form with groups debating rights to political representation during the [[Putney Debates]] of 1647. After the [[English Civil War]]s (1642–1651) and the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] was enacted in 1689, which codified certain rights and liberties. The Bill set out the requirement for regular elections, rules for freedom of speech in Parliament and limited the power of the monarch, ensuring that, unlike much of Europe at the time, [[royal absolutism]] would not prevail.&lt;ref name=refNARoP&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain's unwritten constitution|url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|publisher=British Library|accessdate=27 November 2015|quote=The key landmark is the Bill of Rights (1689), which established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown....

The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects.... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth. The "rights of man" enumerated in the English Bill of Rights gradually were proclaimed beyond the boundaries of England, notably in the American Declaration of Independence of 1776 and in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024130317/http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to significant social change in Britain in terms of the position of individuals in society and the growing power of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in relation to the [[List of English monarchs#House of Stuart (restored)|monarch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizenship 1625–1789|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/citizenship2.htm|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=22 January 2016|postscript=none}}; {{cite web|title=Rise of Parliament|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/making_history_rise.htm|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heater|first1=Derek|title=Citizenship in Britain: A History|date=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=9780748626724|pages=30–42|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=js-qBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30|chapter=Emergence of Radicalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 18th century, leading philosophers of the day had published works that spread around the European continent and beyond. These ideas and beliefs inspired the [[American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]], which gave birth to the ideology of [[liberalism]] and instituted forms of government that attempted to apply the principles of the Enlightenment philosophers into practice. Neither of these forms of government was precisely what we would call a liberal democracy we know today (the most significant differences being that voting rights were still restricted to a minority of the population and slavery remained a legal institution) and the French attempt turned out to be short-lived, but they were the prototypes from which liberal democracy later grew. Since the supporters of these forms of government were known as liberals, the governments themselves came to be known as liberal democracies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

When the first prototypical liberal democracies were founded, the liberals themselves were viewed as an extreme and rather dangerous fringe group that threatened international peace and stability. The conservative [[monarchism|monarchists]] who opposed liberalism and democracy saw themselves as defenders of traditional values and the natural order of things and their criticism of democracy seemed vindicated when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] took control of the young [[French First Republic|French Republic]], reorganised it into the [[first French Empire]] and proceeded to conquer most of Europe. Napoleon was eventually defeated and the [[Holy Alliance]] was formed in Europe to prevent any further spread of liberalism or democracy. However, liberal democratic ideals soon became widespread among the general population and over the 19th century traditional monarchy was forced on a continuous defensive and withdrawal. The [[dominion]]s of the [[British Empire]] became laboratories for liberal democracy from the mid 19th century onward. In Canada, responsible government began in the 1840s and in Australia and New Zealand, parliamentary government elected by [[male suffrage]] and [[secret ballot]] was established from the 1850s and [[female suffrage]] achieved from the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Very Short History of the World; Penguin Books; 2004; {{ISBN|978-0143005599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reforms and revolutions helped move most European countries towards liberal democracy. Liberalism ceased being a fringe opinion and joined the political mainstream. At the same time, a number of non-liberal ideologies developed that took the concept of liberal democracy and made it their own. The political spectrum changed; traditional monarchy became more and more a fringe view and liberal democracy became more and more mainstream. By the end of the 19th century, liberal democracy was no longer only a "liberal" idea, but an idea supported by many different ideologies. After [[World War I]] and especially after [[World War II]], liberal democracy achieved a dominant position among theories of government and is now endorsed by the vast majority of the political spectrum.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Although liberal democracy was originally put forward by Enlightenment liberals, the relationship between democracy and liberalism has been controversial since the beginning and was problematized in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy|last=Schmitt|first=Carl|publisher=MIT Press|year=1985|isbn= 978-0262192408|location=Cambridge|pages=2, 8 (chapter 1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Freedom and Equality in a Liberal Democratic State'', Jasper Doomen posited that freedom and equality are necessary for a liberal democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Freedom and Equality in a Liberal Democratic State|last=Doomen|first=Jasper|publisher=Bruylant|year=2014|isbn= 978-2802746232|location=Brussels|pages=88, 101.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research institute [[Freedom House]] today simply defines liberal democracy as an electoral democracy also protecting [[civil liberties]].

==Rights and freedoms==

In practice, democracies do have limits on certain freedoms. There are various legal limitations such as [[copyright]] and laws against [[defamation]]. There may be limits on anti-democratic speech, on attempts to undermine [[human rights]] and on the promotion or justification of [[terrorism]]. In the United States more than in Europe, during the [Cold War] such restrictions applied to [[Communism|communists]]. Now they are more commonly applied to organisations perceived as promoting actual terrorism or the incitement of group hatred. Examples include [[anti-terrorism legislation]], the shutting down of [[Hezbollah]] satellite broadcasts and some laws against [[hate speech]]. Critics claim that these limitations may go too far and that there may be no due and fair judicial process.
The common justification for these limits is that they are necessary to guarantee the existence of democracy, or the existence of the freedoms themselves. For example, allowing free speech for those advocating mass murder undermines the right to life and security. Opinion is divided on how far democracy can extend to include the enemies of democracy in the democratic process. If relatively small numbers of people are excluded from such freedoms for these reasons, a country may still be seen as a liberal democracy. Some argue that this is only quantitatively (not qualitatively) different from autocracies that persecute opponents, since only a small number of people are affected and the restrictions are less severe, but others emphasise that democracies are different. At least in theory, opponents of democracy are also allowed due process under the rule of law.

However, many governments considered to be democratic have restrictions upon expressions considered anti-democratic, such as [[Holocaust denial]]{{citation needed|date=April 2011|reason=Holocaust denial is anti-Semitic, not anti-democratic}} and hate speech, including prison sentences, ofttimes seen as anomalous for the concept of free speech. Members of political organisations with connections to prior totalitarianism (typically formerly predominant communist, [[Fascism|fascist]] or National Socialists) may be deprived of the vote and the privilege of holding certain jobs. [[Discrimination|Discriminatory]] behaviour may be prohibited, such as refusal by owners of public accommodations to serve persons on grounds of race, religion, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. For example, in Canada a printer who refused to print materials for the Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives was fined $5,000, incurred $100,000 in legal fees and was ordered to pay a further $40,000 of his opponents' legal fees by the Human Rights Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christian Business Ordered to Duplicate Homosexual Activist |publisher=Concerned Women for America|url=http://www.cwfa.org/articles/10594/CFI/family/index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081128171655/http://www.cwfa.org/articles/10594/CFI/family/index.htm|archivedate=28 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other rights considered fundamental in one country may be foreign to other governments. For instance, the constitutions of Canada, India, Israel, Mexico and the United States guarantee freedom from [[double jeopardy]], a right not provided in other legal systems. Also, legal systems that use politically elected court jurors, such as [[law of Sweden|Sweden]], view a (partly) politicised court system as a main component of accountable government, distinctly alien to democracies employing [[trial by jury]] designed to shield against the influence of politicians over trials. Similarly, many Americans consider [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|the right to keep and bear arms]] to be an essential feature to safeguard the [[right to revolution]] against a potentially abusive government, while other countries do not recognise this as fundamental (the United Kingdom, for example, [[gun politics in the United Kingdom|having strict limitations]] on the gun ownership by individuals).

==Preconditions==

Although they are not part of the system of government as such, a modicum of [[individual rights|individual]] and [[economic freedom]]s, which result in the formation of a significant [[middle class]] and a broad and flourishing [[civil society]], are often seen as pre-conditions for liberal democracy (Lipset 1959).{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

For countries without a strong tradition of democratic majority rule, the introduction of free elections alone has rarely been sufficient to achieve a transition from dictatorship to democracy; a wider shift in the political culture and gradual formation of the institutions of democratic government are needed. There are various examples—for instance, in [[Latin America]]—of countries that were able to sustain democracy only temporarily or in a limited fashion until wider cultural changes established the conditions under which democracy could flourish.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

One of the key aspects of democratic culture is the concept of a "[[loyal opposition]]", where political competitors may disagree, but they must tolerate one another and acknowledge the legitimate and important roles that each play. This is an especially difficult cultural shift to achieve in nations where transitions of power have historically taken place through violence. The term means in essence that all sides in a democracy share a common commitment to its basic values. The ground rules of the society must encourage tolerance and civility in public debate. In such a society, the losers accept the judgment of the voters when the election is over and allow for the peaceful transfer of power. The losers are safe in the knowledge that they will neither lose their lives nor their liberty and will continue to participate in public life. They are loyal not to the specific policies of the government, but to the fundamental legitimacy of the state and to the democratic process itself.

Freedom House considers many of the officially democratic governments in Africa and the former Soviet Union to be undemocratic in practice, usually because the sitting government has a strong influence over election outcomes. Many of these countries are in a state of considerable flux.

Officially non-democratic forms of government, such as single-party states and dictatorships, are more common in East Asia, the Middle East and North Africa.

==Types==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}

===Proportional vs. plurality representation===
[[Plurality voting system]] award seats according to regional majorities. The political party or individual candidate who receives the most votes, wins the seat which represents that locality. There are other democratic electoral systems, such as the various forms of [[proportional representation]], which award seats according to the proportion of individual votes that a party receives nationwide or in a particular region.

One of the main points of contention between these two systems is whether to have representatives who are able to effectively represent specific regions in a country, or to have all citizens' vote count the same, regardless of where in the country they happen to live.

Some countries, such as [[Politics of Germany|Germany]] and [[Politics of New Zealand|New Zealand]], address the conflict between these two forms of representation by having two categories of seats in the [[lower house]] of their national legislative bodies. The first category of seats is appointed according to regional popularity and the remainder are awarded to give the parties a proportion of seats that is equal—or as equal as practicable—to their proportion of nationwide votes. This system is commonly called [[mixed member proportional representation]].

[[Politics of Australia|Australia]] incorporates both systems in having the [[Ranked voting systems|preferential voting]] system applicable to the [[Australian House of Representatives|lower house]] and [[proportional representation]] by state in the [[Australian Senate|upper house]]. This system is argued to result in a more stable government, while having a better diversity of parties to review its actions.

===Presidential vs. parliamentary systems===
A [[presidential system]] is a [[system of government]] of a [[republic]] in which the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] is elected separately from the [[legislature|legislative]]. A [[parliamentary system]] is distinguished by the [[executive branch of government]] being dependent on the direct or indirect support of the [[parliament]], often expressed through a [[vote of confidence]].

The presidential system of democratic government has been adopted in Latin America, Africa and parts of the former Soviet Union, largely by the example of the United States. [[Constitutional monarchy|Constitutional monarchies]] (dominated by elected parliaments) are present in Northern Europe and some former colonies which peacefully separated, such as Australia and Canada. Others have also arisen in Spain, East Asia and a variety of small nations around the world. Former British territories such as South Africa, India, Ireland and the United States opted for different forms at the time of independence. The parliamentary system is widely used in the [[European Union]] and neighboring countries.

==Issues and criticism==
{{Further|Criticism of democracy}}

===Dictatorship of the bourgeoisie===
{{Main|Democracy in Marxism}}

Some [[Marxism|Marxists]], [[communists]], [[socialism|socialists]] and [[Anarchism|anarchists]] argue that liberal democracy, under [[Capitalism|capitalist ideology]], is constitutively [[social class|class]]-based and therefore can never be democratic or [[Participatory democracy|participatory]]. It is referred to as [[bourgeois]] democracy because ultimately politicians fight only for the rights of the bourgeoisie.

According to Marx, representation of the interests of different classes is proportional to the influence which a particular class can purchase (through bribes, transmission of propaganda through mass media, economic blackmail, donations for political parties and their campaigns, etc.). Thus, the public interest, in so-called liberal democracies, is systematically corrupted by the wealth of those classes rich enough to gain (the appearance of) representation. Because of this, multi-party democracies under capitalist ideology are always distorted and anti-democratic, their operation merely furthering the class interests of the owners of the means of production. The bourgeois class becomes wealthy through a drive to appropriate the surplus-value of the creative labours of the working class. This drive obliges the bourgeois class to amass ever-larger fortunes by increasing the proportion of surplus-value by exploiting the working class through capping workers' terms and conditions as close to poverty levels as possible (Incidentally, this obligation demonstrates the clear limit to bourgeois freedom, even for the bourgeoisie itself.). Thus, according to Marx, parliamentary elections are no more than a cynical, systemic attempt to deceive the people by permitting them, every now and again, to endorse one or other of the bourgeoisie's predetermined choices of which political party can best advocate the interests of capital. Once elected, this parliament, as a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, enacts regulations that actively support the interests of its true constituency, the bourgeoisie (such as bailing out Wall St investment banks; direct socialisation/subsidisation of business—GMH, US/European [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]]; and even wars to guarantee trade in commodities such as oil).

Vladimir Lenin once argued that liberal democracy had simply been used to give an illusion of democracy while maintaining the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

The cost of political campaigning in representative democracies favors the rich, a form of [[plutocracy]] where only a very small number of individuals can actually affect government policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Draper|first1=Hal|title=Marx on Democratic Forms of Government |date=1974|journal = The Socialist Register|volume = 11|url = https://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5326/2227}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Athenian democracy, some public offices were [[random]]ly allocated to citizens, in order to inhibit the effects of plutocracy. Aristotle described the law courts in Athens which were selected by lot as democratic&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Politics 2.1273b&lt;/ref&gt; and described elections as oligarchic.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Politics 4.1294b&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal democracy has also been attacked by some [[Democratic socialism|socialists]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Democracy|journal=Left Party in Germany|url=https://www.linksfraktion.de/themen/a-z/detailansicht/demokratie/}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a dishonest farce used to keep the masses from realizing that their will is irrelevant in the political process, while at the same time a [[List of conspiracies (political)|conspiracy]] for making them restless for some political agenda. Some contend that it encourages candidates to make deals with wealthy supporters, offering favorable legislation if the candidate is elected—perpetuating conspiracies for [[Monopoly|monopolisation]] of key areas. [[Campaign finance reform]] is an attempt to correct this perceived problem.

In response to these claims, United States economist [[Steven Levitt]] argues in his book ''[[Freakonomics]]'' that campaign spending is no guarantee of electoral success. He compared electoral success of the same pair of candidates running against one another repeatedly for the same job, as often happens in United States Congressional elections, where spending levels varied. He concludes:

:"A winning candidate can cut his spending in half and lose only 1 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, a losing candidate who doubles his spending can expect to shift the vote in his favor by only that same 1 percent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

However Levitt's response were also criticised as they miss the Socialist point of view, which is that citizens who have little to no money at all are blocked from political office entirely. This argument is not refuted merely by noting that either doubling or halving of electoral spending will only shift a given candidate's chances of winning by 1 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mandle|first1=Jay|title=How Freakonomics Gets Campaign Financing Wrong, January 2006|url=http://www.democracymatters.org/money-on-my-mind-2/how-freakonomics-gets-campaign-financing-wrong/|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
Critics of the role of the media in liberal democracies allege that [[concentration of media ownership]] leads to major distortions of democratic processes. In ''[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]'', [[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] argue via their [[Propaganda Model]]&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Herman [http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/199607--.htm "The Propaganda Model Revisited"], ''Monthly Review'', July 1996, as reproduced on the Chomsky.info website&lt;/ref&gt; that the corporate media limits the availability of contesting views and assert this creates a narrow spectrum of elite opinion. This is a natural consequence, they say, of the close ties between powerful [[corporation]]s and the media and thus limited and restricted to the explicit views of those who can afford it.&lt;ref&gt;James Curran and [[Jean Seaton]] ''[[Power Without Responsibility: the Press and Broadcasting in Britain]]'', London: Routledge, 1997, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Media commentators also point out that the influential early champions of the media industry held fundamentally anti-democratic views, opposing the general population's involvement in creating policy.&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky and Gabor Steingart [http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20081010.htm "The United States Has Essentially a One-Party System"], ''Der Spiegel Online'', 10 October 2008, as reproduced on the Chomsky.info website&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Lippmann]] writing in ''[[The Phantom Public]]'' (1925) sought to "put the public in its place" so that those in power would be "free of the trampling and roar of a bewildered herd",&lt;ref&gt;Lippmann cited by Henry Beissel [http://thehumananimal.com/usa/?p=381 "Mutation or Demise: The Democratization of Democracy"] ''Living with Democracy'', #155, Winter 2005, as reproduced on the ''Humanist Persrpectives'' website&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Edward Bernays]], originator of public relations, sought to "regiment the public mind every bit as much as an army regiments their bodies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/bernprop.html Propaganda by Edward Bernays (1928)]. Historyisaweapon.com. Retrieved on 2010-09-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders responding to such arguments assert that constitutionally protected [[freedom of speech]] makes it possible for both for-profit and non-profit organisations to debate the issues. They argue that media coverage in democracies simply reflects public preferences and does not entail censorship. Especially with new forms of media such as the Internet, it is not expensive to reach a wide audience, if there is an interest for the ideas presented.

===Limited voter turnout===
{{Details|Voter turnout}}
Low voter turnout, whether the cause is disenchantment, indifference or contentment with the status quo, may be seen as a problem, especially if disproportionate in particular segments of the population. Although turnout levels vary greatly among modern democratic countries and in various types and levels of elections within countries, at some point low turnout may prompt questions as to whether the results reflect the will of the people, whether the causes may be indicative of concerns to the society in question, or in extreme cases the [[Legitimacy (political science)|legitimacy]] of the electoral system.

[[Get out the vote]] campaigns, either by governments or private groups, may increase voter turnout, but distinctions must be made between general campaigns to raise the turnout rate and partisan efforts to aid a particular candidate, party or cause.

Several nations have forms of [[compulsory voting]], with various degrees of enforcement. Proponents argue that this increases the legitimacy—and thus also popular acceptance—of the elections and ensures political participation by all those affected by the political process and reduces the costs associated with encouraging voting. Arguments against include restriction of freedom, economic costs of enforcement, increased number of invalid and blank votes and random voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idea.int/vt/compulsory_voting.cfm |title=International IDEA &amp;#124; Compulsory Voting |publisher=Idea.int |accessdate=2008-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612191446/http://www.idea.int/vt/compulsory_voting.cfm |archivedate=12 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other alternatives include increased use of [[absentee ballots]], or other measures to ease or improve the ability to vote, including [[electronic voting]].

===Ethnic and religious conflicts===
For historical reasons, many states are not culturally and ethnically homogeneous. There may be sharp ethnic, linguistic, religious and cultural divisions. In fact, some groups may be actively hostile to each other. A democracy, which by definition allows mass participation in decision-making theoretically also allows the use of the political process against 'enemy' groups.

The collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and the partial [[democratisation]] of Soviet bloc states was followed by wars in the former [[Yugoslavia]], in the [[Caucasus]] and in Moldova. Nevertheless, some people believe that the fall of communism and the increase in the number of democratic states were accompanied by a sudden and dramatic decline in total warfare, interstate wars, [[ethnic]] wars, [[revolutionary]] wars and the number of [[refugees]] and displaced people (worldwide, not in the countries of the former sovietic bloc).{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} However, this trend can be attributed to the end of Cold War and the natural exhaustion of said conflicts, many of which were fueled by the Soviet Union and the United States&lt;ref&gt;. {{cite web|authors=Monty G.

In her book ''[[World on Fire (book)|World on Fire]]'', [[Yale Law School]] professor [[Amy Chua]] posits that "when free market democracy is pursued in the presence of a market-dominant minority, the almost invariable result is backlash. This backlash typically takes one of three forms. The first is a backlash against markets, targeting the market-dominant minority's wealth. The second is a backlash against democracy by forces favorable to the market-dominant minority. The third is violence, sometimes genocidal, directed against the market-dominant minority itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chua |first=Amy |authorlink=Amy Chua |title=[[World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability|World on Fire]] |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |year= 2002 |isbn=0385503024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bureaucracy===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
A persistent [[libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[monarchism|monarchist]] critique of democracy is the claim that it encourages the elected representatives to change the law without necessity and in particular to pour forth a flood of new laws (as described in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ''[[The Man Versus the State|The Man Versus The State]]''). This is seen as pernicious in several ways. New laws constrict the scope of what were previously private liberties. Rapidly changing laws make it difficult for a willing non-specialist to remain law-abiding. This may be an invitation for law-enforcement agencies to misuse power. The claimed continual complication of the law may be contrary to a claimed simple and eternal [[natural law]]—although there is no consensus on what this natural law is, even among advocates. Supporters of democracy point to the complex bureaucracy and regulations that has occurred in dictatorships, like many of the former communist states.

The bureaucracy in liberal democracies is often criticised for a claimed slowness and complexity of their decision-making. The term "[[red tape]]" is a synonym of slow bureaucratic functioning that hinders quick results in a liberal democracy.

===Short-term focus===
By definition, modern liberal democracies allow for regular changes of government. That has led to a common criticism of their short-term focus. In four or five years the government will face a new election and it must think of how it will win that election. That would encourage a preference for policies that will bring short term benefits to the electorate (or to self-interested politicians) before the next election, rather than unpopular policy with longer term benefits. This criticism assumes that it is possible to make long term predictions for a society, something [[Karl Popper]] has criticised as [[historicism]].

Besides the regular review of governing entities, short-term focus in a democracy could also be the result of collective short-term thinking. For example, consider a campaign for policies aimed at reducing environmental damage while causing temporary increase in unemployment. However, this risk applies also to other political systems.

[[Anarcho-capitalist]] [[Hans-Herman Hoppe]] explained short-termism of the democratic governments by the rational choice of currently ruling group to over exploit temporarily accessible resources, thus deriving maximal economic advantage to the members of this group. He contrasted this with [[hereditary]] [[monarchy]], in which a monarch has an interest in preserving the long-term capital value of his property (i.e. the country he owns) counterbalancing his desire to extract immediate revenue. He argues that the historical record of levels of taxation in certain monarchies (20–25%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bartlett, Robert|authorlink=Robert Bartlett (historian)|title=England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings: 1075–1225 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford, UK |year=2000 |isbn=0198227418 |pages= 165–68}} 25% tax in England in the 12th century&lt;/ref&gt; and certain liberal democracies (30–60%) seems to confirm this contention.&lt;ref&gt;''Democracy: The God That Failed'' (Transaction Publishers, 2001) Paperback {{ISBN|0765808684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majoritarianism===
{{Main|Majority rule|Tyranny of the majority}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
The [[tyranny of the majority]] is the fear that a direct democratic government, reflecting the majority view, can take action that oppresses a particular minority. For instance, a minority holding wealth, property ownership or power (see [[Federalist No. 10]]), or a minority of a certain racial and ethnic origin, class or nationality. Theoretically, the majority is a majority of all citizens. If citizens are not compelled by law to vote, it is usually a majority of those who choose to vote. If such of group constitutes a minority, then it is possible that a minority could in theory oppress another minority in the name of the majority. However, such an argument could apply to both [[direct democracy]] or [[representative democracy]]. In comparison to a direct democracy where every citizen is forced to vote, under liberal democracies the wealth and power is usually concentrated in the hands of a small privileged class who have significant power over the political process (see [[inverted totalitarianism]]). Several ''de facto'' dictatorships also have compulsory, but not "free and fair" voting in order to try to increase the legitimacy of the regime, such as [[North Korea]].&lt;ref name=pk&gt;{{cite web |title=DPRK Holds Election of Local and National Assemblies |work=[[People's Korea]] |url=http://www1.korea-np.co.jp/pk/195th_issue/2003081602.htm |accessdate=2008-06-28 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FXQ2bRBM?url=http://www1.korea-np.co.jp/pk/195th_issue/2003081602.htm |archivedate=31 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=parlunion4&gt;{{cite web|title=The Parliamentary System of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea | publisher= Association of Secretaries General of Parliaments (ASGP) of the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] | work=Constitutional and Parliamentary Information | url=http://www.asgp.co/sites/default/files/documents//CJOZSZTEPVVOCWJVUPPZVWPAPUOFGF.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2010-10-01 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible examples of a minority being oppressed by or in the name of the majority:
* Those potentially subject to [[conscription]] are a minority possibly because of socioeconomic reasons.
* The minority who are wealthy often use their money and influence to manipulate the political process against the interests of the rest of the population, who are the minority in terms of income and access.
* Several European countries have introduced bans on personal religious symbols in state schools. Opponents see this as a violation of rights to freedom of religion and supporters see it as following from the separation of state and religious activities.
* Prohibition of [[pornography]] is typically determined by what the majority is prepared to accept.
* The private possession of various [[weapons]] (i.e. [[Baston (weapon)|batons]], [[nunchakus]], [[brass knuckles]], [[pepper spray]], [[firearm]]s, etc.) is criminalized in several democracies (i.e. the United Kingdom, Belgium, etc.), with such criminalization motivated by attempts to increase safety in the society, to reduce general violence, instances of homicide or perhaps by moralism, classism and/or paternalism.
* [[recreational drug use|Recreational drug, caffeine, tobacco and alcohol use]] is too often [[War on Drugs|criminalised]] or otherwise suppressed by majorities. In the United States, this happened originally for racist, classist, religious or paternalistic motives.&lt;ref name="repealing"&gt;{{cite book |title=Repealing National Prohibition |author=David E.

The hallucinogen in the cacti, which the Indians interpreted as putting them in communion with their God, rendered them, said the distraught missionaries, "Resistant to all our moral suasions".  The missionaries had recourse to the state legislature and cactus eating was forbidden.  Between the turn of the century and the First World War these laws were generalised to all states of the Union and to all substances, including alcohol.  The Americans adopted prohibition in response to a strong religious lobby for whom all intoxicants were direct competitors for the control over the minds of men.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Society's treatment of [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] is also cited in this context. Homosexual acts were widely criminalised in democracies until several decades ago and in some democracies they still are, reflecting the religious or sexual mores of the majority.
* The Athenian democracy and the early United States had [[slavery]].
* The majority often taxes the minority who are wealthy at [[progressive tax|progressively higher rates]], with the intention that the wealthy will incur a larger tax burden for social purposes.
* In prosperous western representative democracies, the poor form a minority of the population and may not have the power to use the state to initiate redistribution when a majority of the electorate opposes such designs. When the poor form a distinct [[underclass]], the majority may use the democratic process to in effect withdraw the protection of the [[State (polity)|state]].
* An often quoted example of the "tyranny of the majority" is that [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power by "legitimate" democratic procedures. The [[Nazism|Nazi]] Party gained the largest share of votes in the democratic [[Weimar Republic]] in 1933. Some might consider this an example of "tyranny of a minority" since he never gained a majority vote, but it is common for a [[Plurality voting system|plurality]] to exercise power in democracies, so the rise of Hitler cannot be considered irrelevant. However, his regime's large-scale human rights violations took place after the democratic system had been abolished. Also, the Weimar constitution in an [[Enabling Law|"emergency" allowed dictatorial powers and suspension of the essentials of the constitution itself without any vote or election]].

Proponents of democracy make a number of defenses concerning "tyranny of the majority". One is to argue that the presence of a [[constitution]] protecting the rights of all citizens in many democratic countries acts as a safeguard. Generally, changes in these constitutions require the agreement of a [[supermajority]] of the elected representatives, or require a judge and jury to agree that evidentiary and procedural standards have been fulfilled by the state, or two different votes by the representatives separated by an election, or sometimes a [[referendum]]. These requirements are often combined. The [[separation of powers]] into [[legislative branch]], [[executive branch]] and [[judicial branch]] also makes it more difficult for a small majority to impose their will. This means a majority can still legitimately coerce a minority (which is still ethically questionable), but such a minority would be very small and as a practical matter it is harder to get a larger proportion of the people to agree to such actions.

Another argument is that majorities and minorities can take a markedly different shape on different issues. People often agree with the majority view on some issues and agree with a minority view on other issues. One's view may also change, thus the members of a majority may limit oppression of a minority since they may well in the future themselves be in a minority.

A third common argument is that despite the risks majority rule is preferable to other systems and the tyranny of the majority is in any case an improvement on a tyranny of a minority. All the possible problems mentioned above can also occur in nondemocracies with the added problem that a minority can oppress the majority. Proponents of democracy argue that empirical statistical evidence strongly shows that more democracy leads to less internal violence and mass murder by the government. This is sometimes formulated as [[Rummel's Law]], which states that the less democratic freedom a people have, the more likely their rulers are to murder them.

===Political stability===
One argument for democracy is that by creating a system where the public can remove administrations, without changing the legal basis for government, democracy aims at reducing political uncertainty and instability and assuring citizens that however much they may disagree with present policies, they will be given a regular chance to change those who are in power, or change policies with which they disagree. This is preferable to a system where political change takes place through violence.

Some think that political stability may be considered as excessive when the group in power remains the same for an extended period of time. On the other hand, this is more common in nondemocracies.

One notable feature of liberal democracies is that their opponents (those groups who wish to abolish liberal democracy) rarely win elections. Advocates use this as an argument to support their view that liberal democracy is inherently stable and can usually only be overthrown by external force, while opponents argue that the system is inherently stacked against them despite its claims to impartiality. In the past, it was feared that democracy could be easily exploited by leaders with dictatorial aspirations, who could get themselves elected into power. However, the actual number of liberal democracies that have elected dictators into power is low. When it has occurred, it is usually after a major crisis has caused many people to doubt the system or in young/poorly functioning democracies. Some possible examples include [[Adolf Hitler]] during the [[Great Depression]] and [[Napoleon III]], who became first President of the [[Second French Republic]] and later Emperor.

===Effective response in wartime===
By definition, a liberal democracy implies that power is not concentrated. One criticism is that this could be a disadvantage for a state in [[war]]time, when a fast and unified response is necessary. The legislature usually must give consent before the start of an offensive military operation, although sometimes the executive can do this on its own while keeping the legislature informed. If the democracy is attacked, then no consent is usually required for defensive operations. The people may vote against a [[conscription]] army.

However, actual research shows that democracies are more likely to win wars than non-democracies. One explanation attributes this primarily to "the transparency of the [[polity|polities]], and the stability of their preferences, once determined, democracies are better able to cooperate with their partners in the conduct of wars". Other research attributes this to superior mobilisation of resources or selection of wars that the democratic states have a high chance of winning.&lt;ref&gt;Ajin Choi, (2004). "Democratic Synergy and Victory in War, 1816–1992". ''International Studies Quarterly'', Volume 48, Number 3, September 2004, pp. 663–82 (20). {{doi|10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00319.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stam and [[Dan Reiter|Reiter]] also note that the emphasis on individuality within democratic societies means that their soldiers fight with greater initiative and superior leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Reiter |last=Dan |author2=Stam, Allan C.  |year=2002 |title=Democracies at War |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0691089485 |pages=64–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officers in dictatorships are often selected for political loyalty rather than military ability. They may be exclusively selected from a small class or religious/ethnic group that support the regime. The leaders in nondemocracies may respond violently to any perceived criticisms or disobedience. This may make the soldiers and officers afraid to raise any objections or do anything without explicit authorisation. The lack of initiative may be particularly detrimental in modern warfare. Enemy soldiers may more easily surrender to democracies since they can expect comparatively good treatment. In contrast, Nazi Germany killed almost 2/3 of the captured Soviet soldiers and 38% of the American soldiers captured by North Korea in the [[Korean War]] were killed.

===Better information on and corrections of problems===
A democratic system may provide better information for policy decisions. Undesirable information may more easily be ignored in dictatorships, even if this undesirable or contrarian information provides early warning of problems. [[Anders Chydenius]] put forward the argument for [[freedom of the press]] for this reason in 1776.&lt;ref name=luoma&gt;{{cite web

===Corruption===
Research by the [[World Bank]] suggests that political institutions are extremely important in determining the prevalence of [[Political corruption|corruption]]: (long term) democracy, parliamentary systems, political stability and freedom of the press are all associated with lower corruption.&lt;ref&gt;

Retrieved 19 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freedom of information legislation]] is important for [[accountability]] and [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]]. The Indian [[Right to Information Act]] "has already engendered mass movements in the country that is bringing the lethargic, often corrupt bureaucracy to its knees and changing power equations completely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=52046 |title=Right to Information Act India's magic wand against corruption |work=AsiaMedia |accessdate=2008-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926172330/http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=52046 |archivedate=26 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrorism===
{{Globalize section|date=January 2014}}
Several studies{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} have concluded that terrorism is most common in nations with intermediate [[political freedom]], meaning countries transitioning from autocratic governance to democracy. Nations with strong autocratic governments and governments that allow for more political freedom experience less terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2004/11.04/05-terror.html |title=Harvard Gazette: Freedom squelches terrorist violence |publisher=News.harvard.edu |accessdate=2008-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919050732/http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2004/11.04/05-terror.html |archivedate=19 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic growth and financial crises===
Statistically, more democracy correlates with a higher gross domestic product ([[GDP]]) per capita.

However, there is disagreement regarding how much credit the democratic system can take for this. One observation is that democracy became widespread only after the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the introduction of [[capitalism]]. On the other hand, the Industrial Revolution started in England which was one of the most democratic nations for its time within its own borders, but this democracy was very limited and did not apply to the colonies which contributed significantly to the wealth.

Several statistical studies support the theory that a higher degree of economic freedom, as measured with one the several [[Index of Economic Freedom|Indices of Economic Freedom]] which have been used in numerous studies,&lt;ref&gt;Free the World. [http://www.freetheworld.com/papers.html Published Work Using Economic Freedom of the World Research] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xKMGqbq3?url=http://www.freetheworld.com/papers.html |date=20 March 2011 }}. Retrieved 19 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; increases [[economic growth]] and that this in turn increases general prosperity, reduces poverty and causes [[democratisation]]. This is a statistical tendency and there are individual exceptions like Mali, which is ranked as "Free" by [[Freedom House]], but is a [[Least Developed Country]], or Qatar, which has arguably the highest GDP per capita in the world, but has never been democratic. There are also other studies suggesting that more democracy increases economic freedom, although a few find no or even a small negative effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Niclas|last= Bergren|date=2002 |url = http://www.ratioinstitutet.nu/pdf/wp/nb_efi.pdf |title=The Benefits of Economic Freedom: A Survey |accessdate= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070628093441/http://www.ratioinstitutet.nu/pdf/wp/nb_efi.pdf |archivedate=28 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John W.

Retrieved 19 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; One objection might be that nations like Canada and Sweden today score just below nations like Chile and Estonia on economic freedom, but that Canada and Sweden today have a higher GDP per capita. However, this is a misunderstanding as the studies indicate effect on economic growth and thus that future GDP per capita will be higher with higher economic freedom. Also according to the index, Canada and Sweden are among the world's nations with the highest economic freedom rankings, due to factors such as strong [[rule of law]], strong [[property rights]] and few restrictions against [[free trade]]. Critics might argue that the Index of Economic Freedom and other methods used does not measure the degree of capitalism, preferring some other definition.

Some argue that economic growth due to its empowerment of citizens will ensure a transition to democracy in countries such as Cuba. However, other dispute this and even if economic growth has caused democratisation in the past, it may not do so in the future. Dictators may now have learned how to have economic growth without this causing more political freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1 =Bruce|last1= Bueno de Mesquita |first2 = George W. |last2=Downs|date = September-October 2005|url = https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2005-09-01/development-and-democracy|title = Development and Democracy |work=Foreign Affairs|publisher = Council on Foreign Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1= Joseph T.|last1= Single|first2= Michael M.|last2= Weinstein|first3= Morton H.|last3= Halperin|date = 28 September 2004 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/cfr/international/20040901facomment_v83n4_siegle-weinstein-halperin.html |title = Why Democracies Excel|work = New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A high degree of oil or mineral exports is strongly associated with nondemocratic rule. This effect applies worldwide and not only to the Middle East. Dictators who have this form of wealth can spend more on their security apparatus and provide benefits which lessen public unrest. Also, such wealth is not followed by the social and cultural changes that may transform societies with ordinary economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ross, Michael Lewin |title=Does Oil Hinder Democracy? |journal=World Politics |year=2001 |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=325–61 |doi=10.1353/wp.2001.0011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 meta-analysis found that democracy has no direct effect on economic growth. However, it has strong and significant indirect effects which contribute to growth. Democracy is associated with higher human capital accumulation, lower [[inflation]], lower political instability and higher [[Index of Economic Freedom|economic freedom]]. There is also some evidence that it is associated with larger governments and more restrictions on international trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Doucouliagos, H., Ulubasoglu, M |title=Democracy and Economic Growth: A meta-analysis |journal=School of Accounting, Economics and Finance Deakin University Australia |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If leaving out [[East Asia]], then during the last forty-five years poor democracies have grown their economies 50% more rapidly than nondemocracies. Poor democracies such as the Baltic countries, Botswana, Costa Rica, Ghana and Senegal have grown more rapidly than nondemocracies such as Angola, Syria, Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="carnegiecouncil1"/&gt;

Of the eighty worst financial catastrophes during the last four decades, only five were in democracies. Similarly, poor democracies are half likely as nondemocracies to experience a 10 percent decline in GDP per capita over the course of a single year.&lt;ref name="carnegiecouncil1"/&gt;

===Famines and refugees===
A prominent economist, [[Amartya Sen]], has noted that no functioning democracy has ever suffered a large scale [[famine]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Amartya Sen]], (1999). [http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/jod/10.3sen.html "Democracy as a Universal Value"]. ''Journal of Democracy'', 10.3, 3–17. Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Refugee crises almost always occur in nondemocracies. Looking at the volume of refugee flows for the last twenty years, the first eighty-seven cases occurred in autocracies.&lt;ref name=carnegiecouncil1/&gt;

===Human development===
Democracy correlates with a higher score on the [[Human Development Index]] and a lower score on the human poverty index.

Democracies have the potential to put in place better education, longer life expectancy, lower infant mortality, access to drinking water and better health care than dictatorships. This is not due to higher levels of foreign assistance or spending a larger percentage of GDP on health and education, as instead the available resources are managed better.&lt;ref name="carnegiecouncil1"/&gt;

Several health indicators (life expectancy and infant and maternal mortality) have a stronger and more significant association with democracy than they have with GDP per capita, rise of the public sector or income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Franco, Álvaro, Carlos Álvarez-Dardet and Maria Teresa Ruiz |title=Effect of democracy on health: ecological study (required) |journal=[[British Medical Journal]] |year=2004 |volume=329 |issue=7480 |pages=1421–23 |doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7480.1421 |pmid=15604165 |pmc=535957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic peace theory===
{{Main|Democratic peace theory}}

Numerous studies using many different kinds of data, definitions and statistical analyses have found support for the democratic peace theory.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The original finding was that liberal democracies have never made war with one another. More recent research has extended the theory and finds that democracies have few [[militarized interstate dispute]]s causing less than 1,000 battle deaths with one another, that those militarized interstate disputes that have occurred between democracies have caused few deaths and that democracies have few [[civil wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Hegre, Håvard, Tanja Ellington, Scott Gates, and Nils Petter Gleditsch |title=Towards A Democratic Civil Peace?

American professor [[Rudolph Rummel]] claimed that democratic nations have much less [[democide]] or murder by the government.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. J.

'''Loss mitigation''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/sfh/nsc/lmmltrs Loss Mitigation Policy &amp; Guidance]&lt;/ref&gt; is used to describe a third party helping a homeowner, a division within a bank that mitigates the loss of the bank, or a firm that handles the process of negotiation between a homeowner and the homeowner's lender. Loss mitigation works to negotiate [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] terms for the homeowner that will prevent [[foreclosure]]. These new terms are typically obtained through loan modification, [[short sale (real estate)|short sale negotiation]], short refinance negotiation, [[deed in lieu of foreclosure]], cash-for-keys negotiation, a partial claim loan, repayment plan, forbearance, or other loan work-out. All of the options serve the same purpose, to stabilize the risk of loss the lender (investor) is in danger of realizing../

== Kinds of loss mitigation ==
* Loan modification: This is a process whereby a homeowner's [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] is modified and both lender and homeowner are bound by the new terms. The most common modifications are lowering the [[interest rate]] and extending the term to up to 40 years. Reduction in the principal balance, however, is so rare that the Federal Reserve wrote in a report that they could find no evidence that lenders were reducing principal balances on mortgages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The seductive but flawed logic of principal reduction|url=http://realestateresearch.frbatlanta.org/rer/2011/03/seductive-but-flawed-logic-of-principal-reduction.html|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Short  sale: This is a process whereby a lender accepts a payoff that is less than the principal balance of a homeowner's mortgage, in order to permit the homeowner to sell the home for the actual [[market value]] of the home. This specifically applies to homeowners that owe more on their mortgage than the property is worth. Without such a principal reduction the homeowner would not be able to sell the home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/sfh/nsc/faqnsctc FHA NSC Loan Servicing and Loss Mitigation Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Short refinance: This is a process whereby a lender reduces the principal balance of a homeowner's mortgage in order to permit the homeowner to [[refinance]] with a new lender. The reduction in principal is designed to meet the [[Loan-to-value]] guidelines of the new lender (which makes refinancing possible).
* Deed in lieu: A Deed in Lieu of foreclosure (DIL) is a disposition option in which a mortgagor voluntarily deeds collateral property in exchange for a release from all obligations under the mortgage. A DIL of foreclosure may not be accepted from mortgagors who can financially make their mortgage payments.
* Cash-for-keys negotiation: The lender will pay the homeowner or tenant to [[vacate]] the home in a timely fashion without destroying the property after foreclosure. The lender does this to avoid incurring the additional expenses involved in evicting such occupants.
* Special Forbearance - This is where you will make no monthly payment or a reduced monthly payment. Sometimes, the lender will ask you to be put on a repayment plan when the [[forbearance]] has been finished to pay back what you missed, while other times they just modify your loan.
* Partial Claim - Under the Partial Claim option, a mortgagee will advance funds on behalf of a mortgagor in an amount necessary to reinstate a delinquent loan (not to exceed the equivalent of 12 months PITI). The mortgagor will execute a promissory note and subordinate mortgage payable to [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]](HUD). Currently, these promissory or "Partial Claim" notes assess no interest and are not due and payable until the mortgagor either pays off the first mortgage or no longer owns the property.

== Benefits ==
The most common benefit to the homeowner is the prevention of [[foreclosure]] because loss mitigation works to either relieve the homeowner of the debt or create a mortgage resolution that is financially sustainable for the homeowner. Lenders benefit by mitigating the losses they would incur through foreclosing on the homeowner. Immediate foreclosure creates a tremendous financial burden on the lender.

== History and causes==
{{globalize|section|USA|date=December 2010}}
Loss mitigation has been a tool used by lenders for decades, but experienced tremendous growth since late 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philadelphiafed.org/community-development/publications/cascade/66/01_limiting-loan-losses.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; This rapid expansion was in response to the dramatic increase in foreclosures nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/14/AR2007061400513.html | work=The Washington Post | first1=Dina | last1=ElBoghdady | first2=Nancy | last2=Trejos | title=Foreclosure Rate Hits Historic High | date=June 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to late 2006, early 2007; Loss Mitigation was a tiny department within most lending institutions. In fact, the run up prior to the near collapse of the entire financial system shows Loss Mitigation was almost nonexistent. The ten-year period prior to 2007 spurred rapid year over year increases in home prices caused by low interest rates and low underwriting standards. Loss Mitigation was only needed for extreme cases due to the homeowners ability to repeatedly refinance and avoid defaulting.

Beginning in 2007 the mortgage industry nearly collapsed. Large numbers of lenders went out of business and the rest were forced to eliminate all of the loan programs that were most prone to foreclosure.&lt;ref&gt;http://ml-implode.com/index.html#lists&lt;/ref&gt;  These foreclosures were mostly caused by the packaging and selling of subprime and other risky mortgages. The transfer of ownership from mortgage lender to third party investor proved to be disastrous. Lenders wrote risky loans and sold them without being directly affected by the borrowers inability to pay. This practice prompted mortgage lenders to lower the requirements of mortgage approval to the lowest levels in history. Lenders sold pools of these mortgage loans to investment firms who packaged and resold them in the market in the form of bond issues. The investment firms weren't naive to the quality of the mortgages, so they purchased credit default swaps (a type of insurance product without technically being insurance)for protection of inevitable default. In fact, credit default swaps were created during this time and didn't exist prior to the housing boom. This resulted in millions of unqualified people obtaining mortgages.  Another major factor of "mortgage meltdown" was caused by the Bond Rating Agencies. The agencies rated subprime mortgage pools as "investment grade" which opened up an almost unlimited supply of large investors (mutual funds, pension funds and even countries)to purchase these bond issues (The investment grade rating duped money managers into thinking the bonds were less risky then they actually were).  When homeowners began to default on their mortgage payments the bonds were proven to be too risky for investment. This led investment companies to cease purchasing newly originated mortgage pools. In addition, investment firms came to see that the credit default swaps weren't true protection and were essentially worthless. The lenders could no longer sell off the newly originated mortgages. This halted the regeneration of capital necessary for these mortgage banks to lend money. In fact, well over 200 mortgage banks were either forced to close or went bankrupt. This crisis was dubbed the "[[Credit Crunch]]" and the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcrunch.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving lenders were faced with mounting losses from foreclosures. In Addition, they had to depend solely on lending capital derived from deposits. This environment forced the drastic tightening of lending guidelines.

This resulted in millions of people to be unqualified to refinance out of their risky subprime, adjustable rate and [[negative amortization]] loans. Many people suffered dramatic payment increases. At the same time, housing prices plummeted due to the "housing correction" That was fueled by record foreclosures. Based on RealtyTrac data, since December 2007 and through June 2010 there have been a total of 2.36 million U.S. properties repossessed by lenders through foreclosure (REO). In addition there have been 3.48 million default notices and 3.46 million scheduled foreclosure auctions.  This major increase of properties on the market  decreased home values creating a market with fewer qualified borrowers than homes for sale. When there is less demand the prices drop. Home values were at highly inflated levels prior to this due to historically low interest rates&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/mortgage_rates/charts.asp&lt;/ref&gt; and the steady decline of credit requirements for the homeowner to qualify for a mortgage. Many homeowners found themselves with [[negative equity]] meaning the mortgage balance was considerably higher than the market value of the home also known as being "underwater". Many homeowners elected to default voluntarily on their mortgage. Being "underwater" means their home is no longer an asset to them. With all this stacked against them and very few options, the result for many was default and foreclosure or '''loss mitigation'''.

Loss Mitigation can be negotiated directly by the homeowner or an attorney. Be careful of fraudulent claims by third parties, a 2008 study by Professor Alan M White found that of 4,342 modifications that he studied, only 62 received principal reductions.&lt;ref&gt;White, Alan M.,Rewriting Contracts, Wholesale: Data on Voluntary Mortgage Modifications from 2007 and 2008 Remittance Reports(August 26, 2008). Fordham Urban Law Journal, Forthcoming. Available at SSRN:http://ssrn.com/abstract=1259538&lt;/ref&gt;

Still feeling the blow, this has led to a loss of equity (from inflated levels) for every homeowner in the country.&lt;ref&gt;It was noted that home equity has fallen below 50 percent for the first time on record. https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/housing/2008-03-06-foreclosure-record_N.htm&lt;/ref&gt; With less equity homeowners are less likely to qualify for a loan that will refinance them out of a risky loan; with less equity less homeowners are able to qualify for [[home equity line of credit]]s or a [[second mortgage]] in order to pay for financial emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/business/16bernanke.html?em&amp;ex=1205899200&amp;en=348b03a8216ca56d&amp;ei=5087%0A Fed Chief Shifts Path, Inventing Policy in Crisis ]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8762">The '''MacBride Principles''' — consisting of nine [[Employment discrimination|fair employment]] principles — are a corporate code of conduct for [[United States]] companies doing business in [[Northern Ireland]] and have become the Congressional standard for all US aid to, or for economic dealings with, Northern Ireland. They were promoted by [[Seán McManus (priest)|Seán McManus]] and the [[Irish National Caucus]], and by John Finucanne and the American Irish Political Education Committee (PEC), and were drafted by [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Seán MacBride]] (a founding member of [[Amnesty International]]), and were launched in November 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/links/macbride.html Launch date link accessed August 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The principles==
#Increasing the representation of individuals from under-represented religious groups in the workforce including managerial, supervisory, administrative, clerical and technical jobs.
#Adequate security for the protection of minority employees both at the workplace and while traveling to and from work.
#The banning of provocative religious or political emblems at the workplace.
#All job openings should be publicly advertised and special recruitment efforts should be made to attract applicants from under-represented religious groups.
#Lay-off, recall, and termination procedures should not in practice favor particular religious groupings.
#The abolition of job reservations, apprenticeship restrictions and differential employment criteria, which discriminate on the basis of religious or ethnic origin.
#The development of training programs that will prepare substantial numbers of current minority employees for skilled jobs, including the expansion of existing programs and the creation of new programs to train, upgrade, and improve the skills of minority employees.
#The establishment of procedures to assess, identify, and actively recruit minority employees with the potential for further advancement.
#The appointment of a senior management staff member to oversee the company's affirmative action efforts and the setting up of timetables to carry out affirmative action principles.

In addition to the above, each signatory to the principles is required to report annually to an independent monitoring agency on its progress in the implementation of these principles.

&lt;!-- While the Irish-American lobby, namely the [[Irish National Caucus]], is a key campaigner for the Principles, they have been generally rejected in Ireland.  QUESTION: What the heck does the second part of this paragraph mean?? The first part is repetition anyway. --&gt;
Some of the principles were seen as unrealistic and impracticable, such as protection of employees on their way to and from work. Besides, they were perceived as throttling foreign investment in Northern Ireland and by that increasing the economic problems of the province.&lt;ref&gt;Cowley, Martin, "Hume Attacks SF Cynicism on MacBride Principles", Irish Times, 24. 9. 1987, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; No cases were mentioned where a specific American investment had led to discrimination.

There was acceptance, but also a lack of great enthusiasm, by both the Government of the [[Republic of Ireland]], and by moderate nationalists in Northern Ireland, amongst them the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP), as the principles chimed with developing [[European labour law]] provisions. In 1987 the then Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]] was quoted as follows regarding the McBride Principles: “The Government's policy is to press for action by the British Government on measures in the short and medium term aimed at promoting equality of opportunity…”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0372/D.0372.198705070027.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609195446/http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0372/D.0372.198705070027.html |archivedate=2011-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote in 1989 “The Government's view is that there is nothing objectionable in the MacBride principles”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0388/D.0388.198904180036.html{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallel British reforms==
{{main|United Kingdom labour law}}
Within Northern Ireland itself, reforms had begun after the British government suspended the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] in March 1972, starting with the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976 http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/fea1976.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; This was further amended in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1989 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/32/contents]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 the Fair Employment and Treatment Order 1998 became law.

Since then complaints are handled by the [[Fair Employment Commission for Northern Ireland]], now a part of the [[Equality Commission for Northern Ireland]], a non-governmental but publicly funded agency. The MacBride Principles certainly speeded the reform process in the 1980s, but it is debatable whether they contributed significantly after 1989. In a 2003 report the Irish National Caucus felt that the reforms had not yet achieved complete parity, emphasising that Northern Irish Catholics were still more likely to be unemployed and undereducated, and less likely to work in managerial positions, than other groups, and calling for [[affirmative action]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060519075847/http://www.irishnationalcaucus.org/pages/MacBride/IRRC%20Report%20on%20Fair%20Employment%20January%202003.htm INC report 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==
The MacBride Campaign is conducted on a three-fold level:

#Federal - The MacBride Principles became the law of the U.S. in October 1998. The U.S. House and Senate passed the MacBride Principles—as part of the '''Omnibus Appropriations Act''' for Fiscal Year 1999—and President Clinton signed them into law. The MacBride law mandates that recipients of U.S. contributions to the [[International Fund for Ireland]] (IFI) must be in compliance with the MacBride Principles. (The U.S. has been contributing about $19.6 million per year since 1986 to the IFI.)
#State and Cities - Millions of dollars in state and city pension funds are invested in American corporations doing business in Northern Ireland. The MacBride Campaign lobbies to have legislation passed to direct these funds to be invested, in the future, only in companies that endorse the Principles (again, note, not divestment or disinvestments). This is the first step. The second step — once the MacBride Principles investment law has been passed — is to lobby cities and states to enact a "selective purchasing" law, barring the state or city from purchasing goods or services from companies in Northern Ireland that have not endorsed the Principles.
#[[Shareholder resolutions]] - The Campaign works to have shareholders introduce and pass resolutions asking companies to endorse the Principles.

==Endorsement==
The MacBride Principles have been passed in the following 18 US states:

[[Connecticut]], [[Florida]], [[Illinois]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Kentucky]], [[Missouri]], [[Nebraska]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Texas]], [[Vermont]] and [[California]].

They have also been passed or endorsed by over 40 cities, and are pending in many more. The following organizations or individuals have also endorsed them:

* American Irish Political Education Committee
* The Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]]
* [[Randall Robinson]] of TransAfrica, the group that sponsored [[Nelson Mandela]]'s visit to the United States
* Former New York State Governor [[George Pataki]]
* Former New York State Governor [[Mario Cuomo]]
* Former New York City Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]]
* Former New York City Mayor [[David Dinkins]]
* Former Boston Mayor [[Raymond Flynn]] (and former Ambassador to the Vatican)
* The AFL-CIO
* The National Council of Churches
* The American Baptist Convention
* The Episcopal Church
* The Lutheran Pension Board
* The United Church of Christ Board of World Ministries
* The United Methodist Church
* some American Roman Catholic bishops
* Virtually all Irish-American organizations.

'''Mam Nai''' or '''Mam Nay''', ''[[Nom de guerre#Nom de guerre|nom de guerre]]'' Comrade '''Chan''' is a war criminal and former lieutenant of [[Santebal]], the internal security branch of the [[Khmer Rouge]] communist movement, which ruled [[Democratic Kampuchea]] from 1975 to 1979. He was the leader of the interrogation unit at [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum|Tuol Sleng]] (S-21), assisting [[Kang Kek Iew]] (Comrade Duch), the head of the camp where thousands were held for [[interrogation]], [[torture]] and subsequent killing.

Mam Nay gave testimony at the [[Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]] on 14 July 2009. He denied being a leader of the interrogation and torture system of the Khmer Rouge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/s-21-deputy-denies-torture Phnom Penh Post - S-21 deputy denies torture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://khmernz.blogspot.com/2009/07/mam-nay-duchs-former-deputy-amnesia-and.html Mam Nay, Duch’s former deputy: amnesia and serious accommodation with truth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://proceskhmersrouges.net/?p=644 Mam Nay : « Je ne sais pas, je ne me souviens pas »]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tall, pock-marked and having a pink complexion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.andybrouwer.co.uk/2009/07/hiding-to-nothing.html Hiding to nothing]&lt;/ref&gt; Mam Nai impressed both [[Nate Thayer]] and [[François Bizot]] as the most frightening Khmer Rouge individual they ever beheld. Bizot further described Mam Nai as a 'true [[Série noire|crime fiction]] character' with a terrifying 'gallows face'. He met him twice at the [[French Embassy]] compound in [[Phnom Penh]], the second time during the arrest of [[Sirik Matak]] who had been hiding seeking political asylum.&lt;ref&gt;François Bizot, ''Le Portail'', French edition. Page 250&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Mam Nai was born in [[Kampong Thom Province]] in 1934, while Cambodia was under French domination. He was taught by [[Son Sen]] at the ''Institut de Pédagogie'' (Teacher Training College) in Phnom Penh, becoming a [[natural sciences]] teacher in 1956, and Kompong Thom's Balaign College principal in 1958. In the school environment he got to know Kang Kek Iew (Duch) who was his deputy principal. Both were arrested by [[Norodom Sihanouk]]'s security services in 1967 owing to their leftist activities.
After being freed from jail by [[Lon Nol]] in 1970, Mam Nai joined Duch in the guerrilla zone under the control of the Khmer Rouge. He assisted in the interrogation and torture of prisoners at '[[M-13 (prison camp)|M-13 prison camp]]', the first prison Duch set up in the forests of [[Amleang]], [[Thpong District]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Kiernan]], ''The Pol Pot Regime: Race, Power and Genocide in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, 1975-1979''. Page 315&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with [[Tang Sin Hean]] (Comrade Pon) Mam Nai helped Duch to perfect his interrogation techniques in order to purge perceived "enemies of the revolution" from the Khmer Rouge ranks. Prisoners at these camps, mostly disgraced Khmer Rouge cadres, were routinely starved and tortured to extract real and made-up confessions. Few prisoners left the camps alive. Following the [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia|Khmer Rouge victory]] in April 1975 Duch and his men set up prisons throughout the capital including the infamous [[Tuol Sleng prison]]. By 1978, as the party paranoia of seeking unchallenged authority and the ensuing purges increased towards the end of Pol Pot's rule, more and more people were brought to Tuol Sleng.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sfu.ca/archivar/index.php/archivaria/article/viewFile/12222/14562 The Tuol Sleng Archives and the Cambodian Genocide]&lt;/ref&gt; Mam Nai was fluent in the [[Vietnamese language]], uncommon among Cambodians, and took part in the interrogation and torture of Vietnamese-background prisoners, contributing to the extermination of the [[Vietnamese Cambodians|Vietnamese Cambodian]] minority.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.d.dccam.org/Projects/Magazines/Previous%20Englis/Issue07.pdf Magazine of Documentation Center for Cambodia Number 7 July 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mam Nai's signature is on scores of documents detailing the torture of DK's political opponents. He was together with his boss Duch seeing to the execution of surviving prisoners before abandoning Tuol Sleng prison and both were among the very last Khmer Rouge cadres to flee Phnom Penh when it fell to the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] on 7 January 1979. After escaping to the border, Mam Nai joined one of the Khmer Rouge groups that had found sanctuary in [[Thailand]]. In the 1990s he was still working as an interrogator for the Khmer Rouge after joining Front 250, commanded by Ny Korn.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Mam Nai left the Khmer Rouge shortly before [[Pol Pot]] ordered Son Sen's assassination in 1997, living as a private small-scale farmer in the West of the country. Although Cambodian authorities knew where he lived for a long time no attempt was made to arrest him. According to [[Stephen Heder]] of [[London University]] Mam Nai is implicated in "hands-on torture and execution and would almost certainly be convicted in any international tribunal".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcl.american.edu/warcrimes/khmerrouge.pdf Seven Candidates for Prosecution - American University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722052741/http://www.wcl.american.edu/warcrimes/khmerrouge.pdf |date=22 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After appearing at Duch's trial as a witness Mam Nai has, however, not been charged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2009-07-14/cambodian-genocide-trial-hears-from-s21-interrogator/153854 Cambodian genocide trial hears from S21 interrogator]&lt;/ref&gt; At the trial he was asked questions regarding his involvement in the torture and murder of [[Phung Ton]], former dean of [[Phnom Penh University]], but Mam Nai carefully avoided incriminating himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2010/oct/25/cambodias-perfect-war-criminal/ Cambodia’s Perfect War Criminal]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mazdoor Kisan Party''' ('''MKP''') ({{lang-ps|مزدور کسان پارټی}} {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|مزدور کسان پارٹی}}}}) ("[[working class|Workers]] and [[Peasant]]s Party") is a [[political party]] in [[Pakistan]] with [[communist]] and [[socialist]] leanings.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt; In the 1970s, it led  a militant communist movement in [[Hashtnagar]], [[Charsadda District, Pakistan]]. In 2012, a documentary film was screened in [[Lahore]] highlighting the armed struggle of peasants and workers of this small area which was crushed in 1974 by the [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] regime.&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;[https://tribune.com.pk/story/331394/in-the-spotlight-screening-of-hashtnagar/ Documentary film highlighting Hashtnagar armed struggle in the 1970s, screened in Lahore in 2012], The Express Tribune (newspaper), Published 3 February 2012, Retrieved 14 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Creation ===
Following the [[National Awami Party#Party split|split of the National Awami Party (NAP)]] at the end of 1967, the leftist members of the NAP, many of whom were active in a Kissan (peasant) Committee, decided to follow the [[Khan Abdul Wali Khan]] faction of the NAP (after the split). Soon after however, the leadership of the Wali Khan faction, being landlords, decided not to allow members of the NAP to also be members of the Kissan Committee. The leftists, led by [[Afzal Bangash]], then decided to leave the NAP  and establish the MKP. On 1 May 1968, at a meeting in [[Peshawar]], the Mazdoor Kisan Party was formed with Afzal Bangash as leader and Sher Ali Bacha as the General Secretary.

=== Early history ===
The MKP soon started to work together with several factions in Pakistan including the '''Major Ishaque Mohammad''' group in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] and leftist groups in [[East Pakistan]]. In 1970, the Ishaque group merged with the Mazdoor Kisan Party.
The party's main focus was on the peasantry, inspired by the struggles of the [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] and [[African people|African]] people. It achieved immediate success in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North West Frontier Province]] (NWFP) of Pakistan, where spontaneous struggles between peasants and landlords were already taking place due to [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]]'s land reforms and imposition of farm machinery. The MKP provided the organisation and leadership needed by the peasant rebellion and in turn the movement gained tremendous following in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The movement was not only facing the private armies of the landlords but also attempts by the state to stop it by force. The fight continued through three governments: [[Yahya Khan]]'s military regime, the NAP-[[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]] government and the provincial government of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP). Soon even the landlords belonging to the different parties banded together in the ''Ittehad Party'' in order to crush the rebellion.

The provincial NAP-JUI stood firmly behind the landlords in the struggle and, failing to get the central government to establish a ban on the MKP, tried to smear the party by putting forward the notion that [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] had initiated the peasant movement. Still, the government of NAP-JUI fell and the MKP continued on, now having to deal with the PPP.

One of the greatest clashes between the peasantry and the state took place in July 1971 at [[Mandani]]. In a daylong [[pitched battle]], an army of 1500 heavily armed policemen were routed with a casualty rate of about 20 peasants and party cadres on the MKP side. Another struggle took place at the end of the NAP-JUI government period. Around 8000 militia and Rangers were deployed in the [[Malakand Agency]] in order to stop the MKP. During this time the party's vice-president ''Maulvi Mohammad Sadiq'' was assassinated.

===Boycott of Pakistani general elections===
The MKP ignored parliamentary and bourgeois forms of democratic struggle and did not participate in the [[1970 General Election in Pakistan]]. It condemned military action against [[Bengalis]] during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|emergence of Bangladesh]] and, at the same time, struggled for the breaking up of [[One Unit]] in [[West Pakistan]]. The question of nationality in Pakistan was not addressed properly by the MKP, and it also failed to organise in [[Sindh]] and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Baluchistan]]. Still, the MKP had strong support among the peasantry of the [[Peshawar]] and [[Mardan]] districts, the [[Malakand Agency]] and the former states of [[Swat (princely state)|Swat]] and [[Dir (princely state)|Dir]]. It also had built support for itself in parts of [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]] and [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]].

The first national congress of the party was held in May 1973 at [[Shergarh, Pakistan|Shergarh]] in the Mardan District. Armed security guards were placed around the area, and a strike of bus owners was set off by opposing forces in order to prevent people from attending the national congress. This failed, though, as 5000 delegates, helped by disobeying drivers and the MKP militants, attended the congress. An energetic debate took place during which ''Major Ishaque Mohammad'' was elected as president of the party and ''Sher Ali Bacha'' as General Secretary.

===Party elections and internal differences ===
As in 1970, the MKP again did not participate in the [[Pakistani general election, 1977]], although, at that time, it had good prospects of making some progress in national politics of Pakistan. Instead it held the slogan of ''"Intikhab Naheen, Inqilab"'' (Revolution, not elections) and organised mass rallies following a relaxation of political restrictions. Around 50000 people participated in [[Peshawar]] and 30000 in [[Shergarh, Pakistan|Shergarh]], demonstrating the grass-root support of the masses for the MKP.

The aftermath of the March 1977 elections was one of frustration for the cadres of the MKP. The government was accused by the right-wing [[Pakistan National Alliance]] (PNA) of rigging the elections, and the country was basically polarised between supporters and opponents of Bhutto. The MKP, as well as the rest of the ''left'' in Pakistan, was mostly powerless in this major crisis, crying out for civil liberties while at the same time labelling PNA as reactionary.

The MKP was further isolated when a number of leftist parties in Pakistan formed a coalition by the name of [[Awami Jamhuri Ittehad Pakistan]] (AJIP) (People’s Democratic Alliance). The MKP, having increasing internal differences, did not join this alliance.
The internal differences mainly revolved around the question of the peasant movement in NWFP. The three disagreeing factions in the MKP were personified by Sher Ali Bacha, Afzal Bangash, Imtiaz Alam and Major Ishaque Mohammad.

* Sher Ali Bacha argued that in many areas the tenants had become capitalists, as a result of MKP's success in NWFP, and had in turn developed an antagonistic contradiction with the rural labourers they hired. The party should therefore lead the labourers in their confrontation with the tenants. He called for a direct socialist revolution.
* Afzal Bangash also recognised that new contradictions had erupted, but did not see them as antagonistic. He furthermore criticised the rhetoric of immediate socialist revolution as both infantile and Trotskyite.
* In the Punjab section of the party Imtiaz Alam, along with some younger elements of the party, objected to Ishaque’s stance on the national question, and an alleged dogmatism of his. He also accused Bangash of dawdling on said questions, and also making an unprincipled alliance with Ishaque.

Finally in 1978, the MKP formally split up into three factions: One led by Bangash, taking most of the NWFP organisation and the party in northern Punjab with him. A second led by Sher Ali Bacha and Imtiaz Alam, taking most of the cadres in Punjab and Karachi and a small number in NWFP (Sher Ali Bacha later separated himself from this faction, forming the [[Pukhtoonkhwa Mazdoor Kissan Party]]). And finally a third faction led by Major Ishaque, which was supported by a small number of the party’s old guard in Punjab and a small number of cadres from Karachi. Of these three factions, the one led by Afzal Bangash soon came to be recognised by the public as the MKP.

In 1995, Major Ishaque's MKP group merged with the [[Communist Party of Pakistan]] to create the [[Communist Mazdoor Kissan Party]] (CMKP), but in 2003, the CMKP split again and the MKP faction was reestablished.

=== Unity Congress ===
After the split in 1978, Bangash was elected as leader of the MKP and he quickly moved to join AJIP. The coalition provided dialogue and accommodation between the various leftist groups although bitter disagreements were present. Eventually the MKP and the ''Pakistan Workers’ Party'' (PWP) led by Fatehyab Ali Khan, decided to merge and reduce their votes in the coalition from two to one. This unification was announced at the second congress of the party, the "unity congress".

The unity congress was held in July 1979 at [[Mandani]] in NWFP. In spite of martial law restrictions, almost 5000 delegates participated along with observers from a wide range of parties. It was a historical congress and a huge step for MKP. The merging of the MKP and PWP signified a unification of the party having the largest peasant base with the party having the largest trade union base, making the MKP a true workers’ and peasants’ party. Resolutions and the political program implemented at the congress showed the maturity and realism of the new party, and also illustrated the potential of forging left unity.

The unity congress also elected Afzal Bangash as president of the MKP, Fatehyab Ali Khan as Senior Vice-President and Shaukat Ali as Secretary-General. Mirza Mohammad Ibrahim, a veteran labour leader, was elected to the Central Working Committee of the party. Pakistan Mazdoor Kisan Party was formally adopted as the name of the party.

A message of solidarity was also sent by [[Benazir Bhutto]]. All in all, the congress was an indication of the end of the political isolation of the MKP and the entry into mainstream politics, while keeping its distinct character.

=== The party’s role after Unity Congress ===
The MKP played a fundamental role in the popular struggle against the military regime of General [[Zia ul-Haq]]. In early 1981, it had a significant role in forming the united front called [[Movement for the Restoration of Democracy]] (MRD). The MKP also attracted other leftist groups, and was merged with the [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]] (MMA){{fact|date=August 2017}}, ''Surkh Parcham Mahaz-Punjab Jamhoori Front'' (PJF) and ''Muttahida Mazdoor Mahaz'' in Punjab. Much of the character of the MKP was owed to the contributions of parties and organisations merging with it.

=== Death of Afzal Bangash and decline of MKP ===
In 1985 martial law was lifted and MKP president Afzal Bangash returned to Pakistan in mid-1986. At this point although the MKP was officially one single party, internally it was divided in two factions:
*One MKP faction consisting of President Afzal Bangash and the original MKP members.
*A second MKP faction consisting of Senior Vice-President '''Fatehyab Ali Khan''' and his followers, all of whom used to be part of the PWP.

Soon after his return, Afzal Bangash decided to merge his MKP faction with [[Khan Abdul Wali Khan]]'s [[National Democratic Party (Pakistan)|National Democratic Party]] (NDP) thus creating the new [[Awami National Party]] (ANP). However, Fatehyab Ali Khan's faction did not follow the merger with the NDP, instead it continued on as MKP, now calling itself "Mazdoor Kisan Party Pakistan".

In October 1986, Bangash passed away. The death of Bangash signaled the decline of MKP as a significant political force in Pakistan, and the next few decades were to be tumultuous for the party.

The merger the NDP and MKP into ANP never had much support from members of the Afzal Bangash MKP faction, and so around 1988 they decided to split from ANP and once again reconstitute as MKP.

In 1989 Fatehyab Ali Khan was chosen to become president of all of MKP, both his own "Mazdoor Kisan Party Pakistan" faction and the late Afzal Bangash MKP faction.

In August 2002, MKP issued some statements to express its views on the then upcoming national elections under [[Pervez Musharraf]] regime. [[Dawn (newspaper)]] reported, "The newly elected president of the Mazdoor Kisan Party, Fatehyab Ali Khan, has said that his party will cooperate with the leftist and progressive parties in the forthcoming general elections."&lt;ref name=Dawn&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/51236 Mazdoor Kisan Party to cooperate with leftist parties], Dawn (newspaper), Published 5 August 2002, Retrieved 12 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Khan also pledged "that if voted to power, his party will provide free education up to matric for all and restore the 1973 Constitution in its original form." &lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;

In 2004, the Afzal Bangash MKP faction decided to once again go its own way. It split with Fatehyab Ali Khan's MKP faction and instead chose '''Aslam Khan Gigyanay''' as the new party President. Gigyanay remained President until 2012, after which the party has been without a president.

===Some recent events===
On 27 October 2013 tribute was paid to Afzal Bangash, Salar Mohammad Shah Ali and Inqilabi Gojar Khan at an event in Charsadda for their efforts to help the working class.&lt;ref name=Dawn1&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/1052407 A tribute to founding leaders of Mazdoor Kisan Party], Dawn (newspaper), Published 28 October 2013, Retrieved 14 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Some speakers at the event complained about the performance of [[Imran Khan|Imran Khan's]] [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]] (PTI) in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province following the party's coming to power after the [[Pakistani general election, 2013|2013 Pakistani general election]]. One speaker said: "Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf came into power in the province through the slogan of 'change', but miserably failed to bring the promised change." &lt;ref name=Dawn1/&gt;

== Political program ==
The following political program was adopted at the unity congress in 1979. Overall the MKP called for the establishment of a “people’s democratic” system in Pakistan which would eventually lead to socialism. The class contradiction in its view was fundamental to other political contradictions. The ideal system was defined as one in which power was held by workers, peasants, patriotic sections of the intelligentsia, nationalistic entrepreneurs and small traders. Imperialist domination, [[comprador]] capitalism and governance of bureaucracy were to be eliminated.

* '''State and government:''' Pakistan should be a federation brought about by the voluntary and equal association of the provinces which should enjoy complete autonomy in their own affairs. It should be a democratic state in which people will exercise power through the revolutionary party and through elected assemblies.
* '''Economy:''' The current neo-colonial, dependent capitalist system with vestiges of feudal-type relations should be abolished, imperialist domination of the economy ended and a re-orientation of the economy towards real growth, independent development, self-sufficiency, self-reliance and genuine progress should be employed. The state should take a leading role in economic development including nationalisation of the enterprises owned by comprador and pro-imperialist capitalists and management of socialised industry by representative committees of workers. Excess land taken from big land-owners should be distributed free among the local landless and poor peasants.
* '''National question:''' National inequality and oppression should be eliminated. Different nationalities and ethnic groups should be given equal rights and every child should be allowed an education in his/her native tongue.
* '''Culture:''' The popular cultural heritage must be protected and promoted. The current imperialist, feudal and doctrinaire cultural influence should be rooted out.
* '''Fundamental rights:''' All citizens shall have freedom of religion, freedom of expression and freedom of press, regardless of their race, gender or nationality. Vested interests shall not be allowed to exploit the name of Islam to oppress the masses, obstruct progress or instigate communal hatred.
* '''Women:''' No position should be closed to women. They shall have equal rights with men and be allowed to participate in the development and defence of the country.
* '''Foreign policy:''' Pakistan shall support the struggles against imperialism, Zionism and racism. Closer relations with the socialist countries should be developed for mutual advantage. Cooperation with other third world countries for establishing a new international economic order. Support for disarmament and world peace.

== Internal structure ==
The MKP was organised according to the principle of [[democratic centralism]]. The leadership was collective and political instead of individual and personal. The supreme body was the all-[[party Congress]] which was held every four years. It determined the party line and program of action and also elected the central council, which functioned as the highest authority of the party in between congresses. The central council elected the members of the Central Working Committee and the office-bearers of the party.

Below the central council were the provincial branches of the party, which held their own Congresses and elected their own councils. The branches were in turn divided into districts and further into basic organisational units in towns and villages. In parts of the NWFP where the rural membership was very large, several committees got together to form a “Markaz” which carried out a coordinating role.

The members at each level were free to state their opinions on all issues, debate and criticise policies and conduct of leaders at all levels. Still, in the face of this criticism and self-criticism, it was a requirement that members maintained discipline and abided by the decisions of the majority. Also, the election at all levels of higher bodies by the relevant membership meant that although there was a flow of authority from top to bottom, the lower bodies had a great deal of autonomy.

== Mass base ==
The primary mass base of the MKP was the peasantry of NWFP and the organised workers of Punjab. The peasants were mostly directly members of the party while the workers were organised through other organisations affiliated with the MKP. The main worker mass organisation was the [[All Pakistan Trade Union Federation]] (APTUF) led by Mirza Ibrahim. Mirza Ibrahim was himself a member of the MKP’s Central Working Committee. The APTUF was the largest trade union federation in Pakistan and thus contributed greatly to the MKP.

Although the MKP had always been quite weak among the urban middle class groups it did manage getting a good number of members from amongst lawyers, journalists, college teachers and other white-collar professions.

The MKP had very little support among students although its own student wing, the Sarhad Students’ Federation did merge with the Pushtoon Students Organisation in Baluchistan (An affiliate of the PNAP) thereby forming the ''Pakhtonkhwa Students Organisation'' (PSO).

A separate front organisation for women was not created within the MKP. Still, many activists from the [[Women’s Action Forum]] were members or sympathisers of the MKP and the APTUF also had a strong women’s part.

The MKP had a great focus on political education. It published a large number of books, magazines and pamphlets. Sher Ali Bacha was the main editor of these magazines and pamphlets including the weekly “Sanobar”  which was closed down in 1971 and the monthly “Circular” running from 1972 to 1978.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11768">The '''Monterrey Consensus''' was the outcome of the 2002 Monterrey Conference, the [[United Nations]] '''International Conference on Financing for Development'''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/ffd/monterrey/MonterreyConsensus.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Monterrey]], [[Mexico]]. It was adopted by Heads of State and Government on 22 March 2002. Over fifty Heads of State and two hundred Ministers of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Development and Trade participated in the event. Governments were joined by the Heads of the United Nations, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[World Bank]] and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), prominent business and civil society leaders and other stakeholders. New development aid commitments from the United States and the European Union and other countries were made at the conference. Countries also reached agreements on other issues, including debt relief, fighting corruption, and policy coherence.

Since its adoption the Monterrey Consensus has become the major reference point for [[international development]] cooperation. The document embraces six areas of Financing for Development:

# Mobilizing domestic financial resources for development.
# Mobilizing international resources for development: foreign direct investment and other private flows.
# International Trade as an engine for development.
# Increasing international financial and technical cooperation for development.
# External Debt.
# Addressing systemic issues: enhancing the coherence and consistency of the international monetary, financial and trading systems in support of development.

Some critics suggest that the US has ignored the Monterrey Consensus because the amount of US [[official development assistance]] (0.18% of its gross domestic product in 2008), is still well below the 0.7% target, which it endorsed in the Consensus.&lt;ref&gt;http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=ODA_DONOR&lt;/ref&gt;  It is much lower than some other developed countries, especially those in Northern Europe. The United Kingdom, for example, reached its target of giving at least 0.7% of GNI in official aid in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/about/director/pubs/Esquire0504.pdf|title=A Simple Pan to Save the World|last=Sachs|first=Jeffrey|date=May 2004|publisher=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|accessdate=2008-12-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914183311/http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/about/director/pubs/Esquire0504.pdf|archivedate=September 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Monterrey Consensus was updated at Doha, Qatar in 2008, and again at Addis Ababa in 2015.

==2008 Follow-up Conference in Doha, Qatar==

The Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus (Doha,Qatar, 28 November - 2 December 2008) was attended by some 40 Heads of State or Government, 9 Deputy Heads of State or Government, 50 ministers and 17 vice-ministers of foreign affairs, finance, development cooperation and trade, as well as other high-level officials of 170 States and major institutional stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/CONF.212/7&amp;Lang=E&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Doha Declaration'''

Following intense intergovernmental negotiations, the Conference concluded with the adoption of the Doha Declaration on Financing for Development (http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/doha/documents/Doha_Declaration_FFD.pdf). The two key messages included in the document were a strong commitment by developed countries to maintain their Official Development Assistance (ODA) targets irrespective of the current financial crisis, and a decision to hold a UN Conference at the highest level on the impact of the current financial and economic crisis on development.

Other main highlights of the Doha Declaration are:

''Domestic resource mobilization'': the importance of national ownership of development strategies and of an inclusive financial sector, as well as the need for strong policies on good governance, accountability, gender equality and human development.

''Mobilizing international resources for development'': the need to improve the enabling environment and to expand the reach of private flows to a greater number of developing countries.

''International trade as an engine for development'': the importance of concluding the Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations as soon as possible.

''External debt'': the need to strengthen crisis prevention mechanisms and to consider enhanced approaches for debt restructuring mechanisms.

''Addressing systemic issues'': the need to review existing global economic governance arrangements, with a view to comprehensive reforms of the international financial system and institutions.

'''Plenary meetings'''

The Conference was chaired by the Emir of Qatar and included seven plenary meetings. A total of 133 Governments made statements to the plenary. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, the President of the General Assembly, the Director-General of WTO, the Secretary-General of UNCTAD and the Administrator of UNDP spoke at the opening.

In their statements, Member States took stock of the progress made in the implementation of the Monterrey Consensus, identified obstacles and constraints encountered and put forward ideas and proposals to overcome these difficulties. Many statements focused on the consequences of the global financial crisis for development and the need for bold and urgent measures to address them. Much attention was also devoted to the food and energy crises and to the untapped potential of innovative sources of finance.

Amb. Oscar de Rojas, a former Venezuelan diplomat and Director of the U.N.'s Financing for Development Office, served as Executive Secretary of both the Doha and Monterrey conferences.

'''Round tables'''

Six interactive multi-stakeholder round tables were held concurrently with the plenary meetings, centering on the six thematic areas of the Monterey Consensus. Each round table was co-chaired by two Heads of State or Government and ministers from developing and developed countries and moderated by a high-level official of the major institutional stakeholders.

Panelists included HRH Princess Maxima of the Netherlands; S-G’s Special Envoys for the Conference, Mr. Trevor Manuel, South African Finance Minister and Ms. Heidemarie Weiczorek-Zeul, German Minister for Development Cooperation. Following presentations by panelists, interactive discussions took place among representatives of Member States, inter-governmental organizations, UN agencies, civil society and the business sector.

'''Pre-conference events'''

The Conference was preceded by a high-level retreat on the global financial crisis, hosted on 28 November by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Emir of Qatar. The retreat was attended by some 30 Heads of State or Government and ministers from both developed and developing countries, as well as high-level representatives of the major institutional stakeholders. The retreat was meant to serve as a “bridge” between the discussions on the financial crisis that had taken place among smaller groups of countries and the wider membership of the United Nations.

A Global Forum of Civil Society was held from 26 to 27 November on the theme “Investing in people-centered development” and attracted participation of more than 250 civil society organizations and networks. In addition, an International Business Forum, held on 28 November focused on mobilizing private sector resources for development and was attended by more than 200 participants from the private sector.

'''Side events'''

More than 50 side events took place at the Conference site. In the spirit of Monterrey, the organizers were Governments, inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations and the business sector. The issues of inclusive and [[innovative financing]] for development featured prominently in several side events. High-level speakers included: HRH Princess Maxima of the Netherlands, the President of Tanzania.

Stanford University Press, 1999. Pp. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; The colours represent the [[national colours]] of Argentina while the cross represents Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra McGee Deutsch. ''Las Derechas: The Extreme Right in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, 1890-1939''. Stanford University Press, 1999. Pp. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''''Nacionalismo''''' was a [[Far-right politics|far-right]] Argentine [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movement that around 1910 grew out of the "traditionalist" position, which was based on nostalgia for feudal economic relations and a more "organic" social order. It became a significant force in Argentine politics beginning in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell. ''The Cambridge History of Latin America: 1930 to Present''. Volume VIII. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Oakleigh, Melbourne, Australia: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pp. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nacionalismo'' was typically centred upon support of order, hierarchy, [[corporatism]], militant [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], support of the landed estates, combined with the hatred of [[liberalism]], [[Left-wing politics|leftism]], [[Freemasonry]], [[feminism]], [[Jews]] and foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra McGee Deutsch, Ronald H. Dolkart. ''The Argentine right: its history and intellectual origins, 1910 to the present''. SR Books, 1993. Pp. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; It denounced liberalism and [[democracy]] as the prelude to [[communism]].&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell. ''The Cambridge History of Latin America: 1930 to Present''. Volume VIII. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Oakleigh, Melbourne, Australia: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pp. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Nacionalismo'' was strongly influenced by [[Maurrassisme|Maurrassism]] and Spanish [[clericalism]] as well as by [[Italian Fascism]] and [[Nazism]].&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell. ''The Cambridge History of Latin America: 1930 to Present''. Volume VIII. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Oakleigh, Melbourne, Australia: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pp. 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[1930 Argentine coup d'etat]], ''Nacionalistas'' firmly supported the entrenchment of an authoritarian corporatist state led by a military leader.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell. ''The Cambridge History of Latin America: 1930 to Present''. Volume VIII. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Oakleigh, Melbourne, Australia: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pp. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nacionalistas'' often refused to take part in elections because of their opposition to elections as derivative of liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell. ''The Cambridge History of Latin America: 1930 to Present''. Volume VIII. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Oakleigh, Melbourne, Australia: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pp. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Its advocates were writers, journalists, a few politicians and many colonels and other junior military officers; the latter supported the Nationalists largely because, for most of their existence, they saw in the military the only potential political savior of the country.

==Ideology==
''Nacionalismo'' supported a "return to tradition, to the past, to sentiments authentically Argentine, ... [to] the reintegration of the nation with these essential values", these essential values included Roman Catholicism, claiming that to the Church "the Nation should be linked as the body to the soul".&lt;ref&gt; David Rock. ''Authoritarian Argentina: The Nationalist Movement, Its History and Its Impact''.  Berkeley, California, USA: University of California Press, 1993. Pp. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nacionalismo'' opposed [[Secularity|secular]] education, accusing it of being "Masonic [[Laïcité|laicism]]", and supported clerical control of education.&lt;ref&gt; David Rock. ''Authoritarian Argentina: The Nationalist Movement, Its History and Its Impact''.  Berkeley, California, USA: University of California Press, 1993. Pp. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nacionalismo'' based its twin policy of opposition to liberalism and [[socialism]] along with promotion of [[social justice]] on the papal encyclicals of 1891 (''[[Rerum novarum]]'') and 1931 (''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell. ''The Cambridge History of Latin America: 1930 to Present''. Volume VIII. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Oakleigh, Melbourne, Australia: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pp. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nacionalismo'' supported improving relations between the social classes to achieve the Catholic ideal of an organic, "harmonious" society.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell. ''The Cambridge History of Latin America: 1930 to Present''. Volume VIII. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Oakleigh, Melbourne, Australia: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pp. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Beginning in the mid-1930s, ''Nacionalistas'' declared their concern for the [[working-class]] and support for social reform, with the newspaper ''La Voz Nacionalista'' declaring "The lack of equity, of welfare, of social justice, of humanity, has made the [[proletariat]] a beast of burden ... unable to enjoy life or the advances of civilization".&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell. ''The Cambridge History of Latin America: 1930 to Present''. Volume VIII. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Oakleigh, Melbourne, Australia: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pp. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1930s, with industrial development increasing in the country, ''Nacionalistas'' promoted a policy of progressive [[income redistribution]] to allow more money to be with wage-earners and thus allowing them to invest and widen the economy and increase industrial growth.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell. ''The Cambridge History of Latin America: 1930 to Present''. Volume VIII. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Oakleigh, Melbourne, Australia: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pp. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, the ''Nacionalistas'' rose from a fringe group to be a substantial political force in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell. ''The Cambridge History of Latin America: 1930 to Present''. Volume VIII. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Oakleigh, Melbourne, Australia: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pp. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s, the ''Nacionalistas'' emphasized the need for [[Autarky|economic sovereignty]], requiring greater industrialization and the take-over of foreign companies.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell. ''The Cambridge History of Latin America: 1930 to Present''. Volume VIII. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Oakleigh, Melbourne, Australia: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pp. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1940s, the ''Nacionalistas'' was effectively run by the military clique known as the [[Grupo Oficiales de Unidos]] (GOU).&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell. ''The Cambridge History of Latin America: 1930 to Present''. Volume VIII. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Oakleigh, Melbourne, Australia: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pp. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The GOU was highly suspicious about the threat of communism and along with the ''Nacionalistas'' supported the revolution of 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell. ''The Cambridge History of Latin America: 1930 to Present''. Volume VIII. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Oakleigh, Melbourne, Australia: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pp. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Nacionalistas'' took control of President [[Pedro Pablo Ramírez]]'s junta in October 1943, changing Argentina's foreign policy by refusing to permit any further discussion with the [[United States]] on the issue of breaking Argentina's relations with the [[Axis powers]].&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell. ''The Cambridge History of Latin America: 1930 to Present''. Volume VIII. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Oakleigh, Melbourne, Australia: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pp. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States government responded by freezing assets of Argentine banks in their country.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell. ''The Cambridge History of Latin America: 1930 to Present''. Volume VIII. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Oakleigh, Melbourne, Australia: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pp. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; In power, the ''Nacionalistas'' pursued a policy of social justice by supporting the appointment of [[Juan Perón]] (who later became the [[President of Argentina]]) as the head of the department of labour on 28 October 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell. ''The Cambridge History of Latin America: 1930 to Present''. Volume VIII. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Oakleigh, Melbourne, Australia: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pp. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Perón declared that the ''Nacionalista'' government was committed to a "revolution" that would keep national wealth in Argentina, give workers their dues, improving living standards without provoking [[class conflict]], and attacked both communism and international capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell. ''The Cambridge History of Latin America: 1930 to Present''. Volume VIII. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Oakleigh, Melbourne, Australia: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pp. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Facing pressure from the United States for Argentina to dissolve relations with the Axis powers, President Ramírez yielded on 26 January 1944 and this was followed by ''Nacionalistas'' protesting this action and Ramírez banning all ''Nacionalista'' organizations in February.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell. ''The Cambridge History of Latin America: 1930 to Present''. Volume VIII. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Oakleigh, Melbourne, Australia: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pp. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nacionalista'' cabinet ministers resigned in protest and the ''Nacionalistas'' subsequently overthrew Ramírez, retaining their hold on power of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell. ''The Cambridge History of Latin America: 1930 to Present''. Volume VIII. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Oakleigh, Melbourne, Australia: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pp. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an ideology, ''Nacionalismo'' was militarist, authoritarian, and sympathetic to the rule of a modern [[caudillo]], who the Nationalists were frequently either hoping for or reinterpreting history to locate in the past.  Along these lines, a major part of the intellectual work of Nacionalismo was the creation of [[historical revisionism]] as an academic movement in Argentina.  Nationalist historians published a number of works challenging the work of the liberal historians who had forged the dominant historical narrative of Argentina, and presented 19th century dictator [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] as the kind of benevolent authoritarian leader that the country still needed.

While the nationalists themselves never really managed to maintain political power despite participating in a handful of successful coups throughout the 20th century (see, for example, [[José Félix Uriburu]]).  Their lasting legacy, however is twofold: first, their enormous influence over the political discourse of contemporary Argentina, where right, left and center have all been heavily influenced by their discourse, in part through second-hand clerical and military influences, and in part through Perón's adoption of some of their ideas and language.  

Second, the [[1976 Argentine coup d'état|most recent military coup]] in Argentina was largely directed and conducted by Nationalists in the Argentine armed forces, and most certainly dictated by their ideological legacy{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}.  With hindsight, the ironic part of this enormous slaughter (about 30,000 people killed or "disappeared") was that [[Montoneros|the main guerrilla group]] that the government was attempting to undermine and exterminate was also heavily influenced by ''Nacionalismo'', though their political convictions were very different from those of the military officers.

The '''Namibian Economic Freedom Fighters''' (NEFF) is a Namibian political party formed in June 2014. The party has close links to the South African [[Economic Freedom Fighters]].&lt;ref name="sun_eff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.namibiansun.com/politics/local-party-apes-malemas-eff.67539|title=Local party apes Malema’s EFF|publisher=Namibian Sun|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economically, the two parties are similar, with the NEFF describing itself as a Pro Freedom, anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movement,&lt;ref name="news24_replica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/Namibias-EFF-replica-We-want-economic-freedom-20140625|title=Namibia's EFF replica: We want economic freedom|publisher=News24|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be against foreign exploitation of the country's natural resources and proposing that land and its natural resources be owned by indigenous people.&lt;ref name='fever'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.namibian.com.na/indexx.php?id=14514&amp;page_type=story_detail|title=Malema's EFF fever hits Namibia|publisher=The Namibian|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by former [[SWAPO]] member Epafras Mukwiilongo, the party differs from its South African relative in its anti-homosexual rhetoric, with Mukwiilongo stating that "Today, the imperialists are manipulating/influencing our nation through homosexual practices. The NEFF is committed to uniting all Namibians to root out this evil practice. Namibia will never be ruled by homosexuals".&lt;ref name='fever'/&gt;

The party contested the [[Namibian general election, 2014|November 2014 elections]]. It only gathered 0.36% of the votes and failed to gain a seat in the [[National Assembly (Namibia)|National Assembly]]. Its presidential candidate Mukwilongo came in last of the nine contenders.&lt;ref name=NV&gt;{{cite news|title=So lyk die NV|trans-title=That's the NA|language=Afrikaans|newspaper=[[Die Republikein]]|date=3 December 2014|url=http://www.republikein.com.na/politiek/so-lyk-die-nv.234484|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224232149/http://www.republikein.com.na/politiek/so-lyk-die-nv.234484|archivedate=24 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Institute Against Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism''' ('''{{lang-es|Instituto Nacional contra la Discriminación, la Xenofobia y el Racismo}}''', aka '''INADI''') is a state agency of the [[Government of Argentina]] (answerable to the [[Ministry of Justice, Security and Human Rights]]) which is charged with receiving complaints and pursuing charges against citizens accused of acts of discrimination or hatred. Created in 1995 by Federal Law 24515, INADI is considered one of Argentina's [[National human rights institutions]]. 

==Structure==
INADI is led by a Board of Directors, chaired currently by Dr. [[Claudio Morgado]]. The chair and vice-chair are appointed to their positions for four-year terms by the Cabinet from a list of three candidates selected by the Congress; four of the directors are representatives of Ministries of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Argentina)|Interior]], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship|Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship]], [[Ministry of Justice, Security and Human Rights|Justice, Security and Human Rights]] and [[Ministry of Education (Argentina)|Education]]. 

The other three directors are representatives of NGOs who have extensive experience in the struggle for human rights. The Advisory Council, which assists the Board of Directors, has ten members representing NGOs and reflects the diversity of the groups most affected by discrimination.

==Background==

===Indian emergency===
{{main|Indian Emergency}}

[[Jayaprakash Narayan]] was a [[Gandhian]] leader in [[India]] after independence.&lt;ref name="DonnellyHoward-Hassmann1987"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Donnelly|first1=Jack|last2=Howard-Hassmann|first2=Rhoda E.|last3=Howard|first3=Rhoda E.|title=International handbook of human rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3u0oqY8-KdMC&amp;pg=PA156|accessdate=23 June 2010|date=1987-11-06|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-24788-0|pages=156–}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Indira Gandhi was found guilty of violating electoral laws by the [[Allahabad High Court]], Narayan called for Indira to resign, and advocated a program of social transformation. He asked the military and police to disregard unconstitutional and immoral orders.  However, [[Janata Party]] opposition leaders and dissenting members of her party, [[Congress (I)]] were arrested, beginning [[The Emergency (India)|The Emergency]]. Narayan was detained at [[Chandigarh]], and when released in 1976, formed the PUCL to oppose the suppression of civil and political rights during the emergency.&lt;ref name="DonnellyHoward-Hassmann1987"/&gt; The organization was thrown into disarray by his death and the election of the [[Janata party]] to power, which promised to enact the PUCL platform.

Narayan originally intended PUCL to be an organisation free from political ideologies, bringing those concerned about defending civil liberties and human rights from different backgrounds onto a common platform.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} According to the PUCL, the PUCLDR was a loosely organised group of people who were working with Narayan, a prominent figure in the Indian Opposition in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pucl.org/history.htm PUCL History]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-1980===
After the return of Indira Gandhi to power in the 1980 elections in India, the organisation regained momentum&lt;ref name="DonnellyHoward-Hassmann1987"/&gt; and was renamed as the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL). Its founding conference was held in November 1980.

Current President (2017): Ravi Kiran Jain, Senior counsel from Allahabad. General Secretary, V. Suresh.

==Operations==
The founding conference of the PUCL in November 1980, drafted and adopted the organization's constitution, making it a membership based organization.&lt;ref name="A Short History of PUCL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pucl.org/history.htm|title=A Short History of PUCL|publisher=People's Union for Civil Liberties|accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PUCL's constitution does not allow members of a political party to hold any office and hold membership in the PUCL; the number of members, belonging to political parties, in the national or state executive committees shall not be more than 50% of the members of the National Council and the National Executive Committee respectively (and also the corresponding bodies at the state and local level). The PUCL does not allow more than 10% of its members to be from the same political party.&lt;ref name="A Short History of PUCL"/&gt;

[[V. M. Tarkunde]] served as president and editor-politician. [[Arun Shourie]] served as general secretary. Y. P. Chhibbar was appointed as executive secretary. Those elected as president and general secretary have included V. M. Tarkunde, [[Rajni Kothari]], [[Rajinder Sachar]], [[K. G. Kannabiran]], [[Arun Shourie]], Y. P. Chhibbar, [[Arun Jaitley]], [[Satish Jha]], Dalip Swami, and others.

It publishes a monthly journal in English, the ''PUCL Bulletin'',that was founded by [[Satish Jha]], [[Arun Jaitley]], Smitu Kothari and Neeraja Chowdhary and helped bring a large number of people to the fold of PUCL. PUCL also organises a ''JP Memorial Lecture'' on March 23 every year, the date on which the [[India]]n [[State of Emergency]] was lifted in 1977.

It presents its Journalism for Human Rights' Award which carries a citation and an award of Rs 20,000. PUCL, as it policy, does not accept money from any funding agency, [[India]]n or foreign. All the expenses are met by the members, the office bearers, and the activists.

The PUCL supports [[grassroots]] movements that focus on organizing and empowering the poor rather than using state initiatives for change.

They have brought to light the cases of the bonded labourers, children in prison and violence committed against women undertrials.

The PUCL has worked on the issue of the hundreds of people detained by India and Pakistan's government and accused of [[espionage]] after trivial crimes like minor trespassing, a problem linked to the tension caused by the [[Kashmir conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2012/43/ws-nowhereman.html Your World: The Nowhere Man], Rupa Jha, October 21, 2012, BBC (retr 2012 10 20) (Program link:[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00z57wt The Nowhere Man])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charges against Dr Binayak Sen==
[[Binayak Sen]], who is the National Vice-President of the Union and General Secretary of its Chhattisgarh unit, was arrested in May 2007 by security agencies for his alleged links with [[Maoists]]. In 2010, Sen was convicted of [[sedition]] and several other offences under [[Indian Penal Code]] by [[Raipur]] Sessions Court in [[Chhattisgarh]] after finding him and two others, guilty of sedition for helping the Maoists in their fight against the state. They were sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name="The Times of India"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his conviction, he was later released by the [[Supreme Court of India]] though the apex court said it was giving no reason for granting bail and left it to the satisfaction of the trial court concerned to impose the conditions for his release on bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesnow.tv/SC-grants-bail-to-Binayak-Sen/articleshow/4370495.cms |title=Times Now: SC grants bail to Binayak Sen – 15 Apr 2011 |publisher=Timesnow.tv |date=15 April 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Court did not give any reasons for granting his bail. His appeal against conviction is pending with the Chhattisgarh High Court.

The concept of '''permanent war economy''' originated in 1944 with an article by [[Ed Sard]] (alias Frank Demby, Walter S. Oakes and T.N. Vance), a Third Camp Socialist, who predicted a post-war [[arms race]]. He argued at the time that the United States would retain the character of a [[war economy]]; even in peacetime, [[US military expenditure]] would remain large, reducing the percentage of unemployed compared to the 1930s. He extended this analysis in 1950 and 1951.&lt;ref&gt;See Peter Drucker, ''Max Schachtman and his Left.

==Military Keynesianism==
{{Main article|Military Keynesianism}}

The stabilising effect of armaments expenditures on the economy is more or less explained the same way as “non-military” Keynesians explain the effects of their policy. Therefore, additional explanations are needed as to why it is necessary to use military expenditures instead of just civilian useful state expenditures. Several reasons are put forward{{By whom|date=November 2009}}:

1) “[[Legitimation]] crisis of late capitalism”

According to [[Jürgen Habermas]] capitalism will suffer from a “[[Legitimation crisis (concept)|legitimation crisis]]” if there is too much state intervention, because this will lead people to ask for more. Capitalism will no longer be perceived as a system ruled by quasi-natural laws, but as something that can be formed by politics.  An external threat to be countered by government expenditures on arms, however, avoids this danger for the [[ruling class]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

2) The balance of forces between the [[working class]] and the capitalist class will be shifted in favour of the working class if there is too much spending on [[social welfare]] and other items benefitting working-class people.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The end of military Keynesianism came when competitors to the US, like Germany and Japan, the countries that had lost the Second World War, were not allowed or could avoid building their own military machine. They were increasingly allowed to export arms, however. Finally the US could no longer play the role of the world Keynesian but had to prepare for [[competition]] with nations like Japan and Germany. This resulted in cutting back on arms expenditures, thus bringing back crisis to world capitalism.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==Capital export==

A similar effect can result from capital exports. Again profits are siphoned off from private investment. Marx (volume III of “Das Kapital”) mentions capital export as a countervailing tendency for the tendency of the profit rate to fall. The reasons, he puts forward, are that if capital finds in other parts of the world areas with lower costs and higher profit rates, capital exports increase the average rate of profit. It is [[Henryk Grossman]] (and Marx’s “[[Grundrisse]]”), who argues that capital exports in themselves are a cause, which postpones a crisis, which otherwise would follow from the rising value composition of capital and the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==Question of deliberate policy==

Some authors{{Who|date=November 2009}} emphasise that the permanent arms economy was not something planned by capitalists. It was like a lucky fate, which came upon monopoly capitalism by special circumstances, which cannot be repeated at will or by planning. This contrasts with the view of the German Marxist [[Alfred Sohn-Rethel]] who with a rather similar theory claims that the idea of an arms economy was applied rather deliberately in the Germany of the 1930s to fend off a crisis for German capitalism{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Based on analyses which were in fact influenced by Marxist theory, German capitalists came to the conclusion&amp;nbsp;– according to Alfred Sohn-Rethel{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}&amp;nbsp;– that only arms expenditures as a kind of waste could “save” German capitalism for the moment. Thus, they decided to opt for [[Adolf Hitler]] and his promises of increasing military expenditures.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==Benefits==

Military advances provide spin-off benefits for civilian technologies. Additionally, military spending may represent an overhead charge for an economy, allowing a nation to function without fear of invasion. Essentially, military spending ensures the property rights of a nation's citizens: an essential element of a capitalist system.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==Criticisms==

{{Citation needed section|date=November 2009}}

The central arguments against this position have been made by economists like [[Seymour Melman]], [[Lloyd J. Dumas]] and [[John Ullmann]]. It should be noted that, without giving a specific reference, Melman states, in the 1974 edition of Permanent War Economy published by Simon and Schuster (p.&amp;nbsp;16), that "The concept of a "permanent war economy" formulated in 1944 was soon made a reality." The reference is almost certainly to Sard's article in February of that year in Politics.  The critique centers on whether or not military spending has a "use value," i.e. a productive use within the economy. On the one hand, the macroeconomic stimulus of arms spending may be positive in the short run, when comparing such spending to the absence of any form of procurement.  On the other hand, military spending represents serious [[opportunity costs]].  First, the economic benefits of spending in non-military areas may be greater, i.e. have greater multiplier effects.  For example, an investment in a tank or plane is rapidly depleted and after the tank or plane is invented, leads to no further economic use value.  Moreover, when the state fails to invest in key resources, this creates opportunity costs with respect to "socially necessary" or world competitive infrastructure investments.  These costs are evident in depleted infrastructure, reduced spending on education, failure to develop massive investments in alternative energy and transit systems, and outbreaks of violence (such as riots) caused by uneven development.

{{Aromanians}}
The name '''Principality of the Pindus''' ({{lang-rup|Printsipat di la Pind}}; {{lang-el|Πριγκιπάτο της Πίνδου}}; {{lang-it|Principato del Pindo}}) is used in literature to describe the attempt to create an autonomous canton under the protection of Italy at the end of World War I, in July and August 1917, from [[Vlachs|Vlach]]-speaking population of [[Samarina]] and other villages of the [[Pindus]] mountains of Northern Greece during the short period of occupation by Italy of the district of [[Gjirokastra]] and regions of [[Epirus]]. The attempt was not successful and no such principality was ever formed.&lt;ref name="Lascu" /&gt; A declaration was made after the arrival of Italian troops in Samarina. In the immediate withdrawal of Italians a few days later, Greek troops appeared without meeting any resistance.&lt;ref name="Lascu" /&gt;

Since then there was no mention of any similar activity until 1941-2 when the territory of Greece were occupied by Italy, Germany and Bulgaria under the World War II. At that time, [[Alcibiades Diamandi]], a Vlach from Samarina who also took part in the events of 1917, was active with an organization called in later literature with the name [[Vlach "Roman Legion"]] (at the time called "Legion" or "Roman Legion"). As part of the activity of the legion in the areas of mainly [[Thessaly]] (and [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], and [[West Macedonia]]), it was mentioned as an intention of Diamandi to create a semi-independent entity by the name "Principality of the Pindus" or "Independent State of Pindos" or "Canton". The "Legion" was never able to assert itself over the Vlachs whom it supposedly represented, nor over the local population until its ''de facto'' disbandment in 1943 due to the activity of the Greek Resistance and the Italian capitulation, leaving them without real support from the German command.&lt;ref&gt;{{gr icon}}[http://www1.rizospastis.gr/columnPage.do?publDate=7/9/2003&amp;columnId=342 The capitulation of Italy] from ''[[Rizospastis]]'' newspaper, 7 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In other sources, no name is assigned to the events of 1917 in Pindus.&lt;ref name="Kahl"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-ebpDLhkVWcC&amp;lpg=PA148&amp;dq=aromanians%20millet&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q=aromanians%20millet&amp;f=false The ethnicity of Aromanians after 1990: the Identity of a Minority that Behaves like a Majority], Thede Kahl, Ethnologia Balkanica, Vol. 6 (2002), σελ. 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mylonas"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nv4fAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=aromanian%20schools%20Venizelos&amp;pg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Politics of Nation-Building: Making Co-Nationals, Refugees, and Minorities], Harris Mylonas, Cambridge University Press, 2013, σελ. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==The name "Principality of the Pindus"==
The name "Principality of the Pindus" was given retrospectively and is used in bibliography literature mainly about the events of 1917 in Samarina. It was also used for the activity of Diamanti 25 years later, the so-called "[[Vlach "Roman Legion"|Legion of the Vlachs]]" in 1942-1943. In sources closer to the events it is not used in 1917 nor in the period from 1942 to 1943. Indicatively, 12 years after the events in 1929, Nicolae Zdrulla wrote in the journal ''Revista Aromânească'' (Volume 1, No. 2) issued in Bucharest an article entitled "Mişcarea aromânilor din Pind în 1917" ("The movement of Aromanians of Pindos in 1917").&lt;ref&gt;Nicolae Zdrulla, Mişcarea aromânilor din Pind în 1917 (The movement of Aromanians on Pindus in 1917), Revista Aromânească, vol 1, nr.2, Bucureşti, 1929, pp. 162-168&lt;/ref&gt; An archival study published in 2007 with documents of the same period (telegrams of the Vlachs to head of states of that time and correspondence of the Italian and Romanian Consulates) was entitled "The events of July–August 1917 in the region Pindos. The effort to create an independent state of Aromanians"&lt;ref name="Lascu"&gt;[https://csea.wikispaces.com/file/view/5.+Evenimentele+din+iulie-august+1917.pdf Evenimentele din lunile iulie-august 1917 în regiunea Munţilor Pind – încercare de creare a uneistatalităţi a aromânilor. documente inedite şi mărturii. studiu istoriografic şi arhivistic], Stoica Lascu, Revista Romana de Studii Eurasiatice, Anul III, Nr. 1-2/2007&lt;/ref&gt; mentions the word "Principality" only in the introduction, while there is no reference to it to the documents of the time recorded in this archival study.

==Background: Romania's effort after 1860 to win over Vlach populations in the Southern Balkans==
Since [[Romania]]'s creation in 1859, it has tried to win over Vlach populations of the Ottoman Empire. In the 1860s, it funded the activity of [[Apostolos Margaritis]] who founded Romanian schools in the Ottoman territories of Epirus and Macedonia since the Vlach language has much in common with the Romanian language. Romania, with the support of Austro-Hungary, succeeded in the acceptance of Vlachs as a separate [[Millet_(Ottoman_Empire) | millet]] with the decree ([[Irade-i senniye|irade]]) of May 22, 1905 by [[Abdul Hamid II|Sultan Abdulhamid]], so the "Ullah millet" (the millet of the Vlachs) could have their own churches and schools.&lt;ref name="Kahl"/&gt; This was a success of the Romanian national agitation policy in European Turkey in the last part of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rethinking Violence: States and Non-state Actors in Conflict|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7on0obGSuVIC|publisher = MIT Press|date = 2010|isbn = 9780262014205|language = en|first = Erica|last = Chenoweth|first2 = Adria|last2 = Lawrence|page = 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romania then funded the construction and operation of many schools in the wider region of Macedonia and Epirus. These schools have continued their operation even when some of the territories of the region of Macedonia and Thrace passed to Greek authority in 1912. Their financing by Romania continued in 1913 with the agreement of the then Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos.&lt;ref name="Mylonas"/&gt; In such Romanian schools, there was a coordinated effort to promote the idea of Romanian identity among Vlachs. Graduates of these schools who wanted to continue their education usually went to educational institutions in Romania.

== Albania and Epirus at the end of World War I: 1916–1917==
During the First World War, in 1916, the Albanian territory and Northern Epirus were split between the [[Kingdom of Italy]] which occupied [[Gjirokastra]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DicVpKMgBY8C&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=Italian+Protectorate+in+Albania&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JAZzuKH-mT&amp;sig=IMOZ8djXs-UCOhwjuMjrJItetz0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cXtlTZL9Cou0vgPJmqysBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Italian%20Protectorate%20in%20Albania&amp;f=false Armies in the Balkans 1914-18], Nigel Thomas, Osprey Publishing, 2001, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and France which occupied [[Korce]], while in northern and central Albania were occupied by troops of [[Austria-Hungary]].

On December 10, 1916 the French founded the [[Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë|Republic of Korca]]. In response, Austria-Hungary went on proclamation of independence of Albania as a protectorate on January 3, 1917 in [[Shkodra]], while on June 23, 1917 the Italians proclaimed the [[Italian protectorate over Albania|Italian Protectorate of Albania]] in [[Gjirokastra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://flagspot.net/flags/al_w1914.html#kor|title = Republic of Korçë (1917-1918)|author = Jaume Ollé|date = 15 July 1996|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fflagspot.net%2Fflags%2Fal_w1914.html%23kor&amp;date=2011-01-12|archivedate = 12 Jan 2011|accessdate = 12 Jan 2011|quote = On 23 June 1917, Italy proclaimed the independence of Albania under her protectorate, justifying this with the French precedent in Korçë. Austria-Hungary had done it before on 3 January 1917.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then the Italian forces advanced and they captured [[Ioannina]].

In this environment of occupation and fragmentation of territories in Southern Albania and Northwestern Greece, Italian troops occupied Samarina and other villages of Pindus for a few days at the end of August 1917 to the first two days of September 1917.&lt;ref name="Glezos"&gt;{{gr icon}} Μανόλης Γλέζος [[Manolis Glezos]], Εθνική αντίσταση, 1940-1945, τόμος 1, Στοχαστής, 2006, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==The events in 1917==

In 1917, during the occupation of the territories of Albania and Northern Epirus, the Italians tried to win over the Vlachs to convert Vlach-Romanian relations in favor of Italy, based on historical and linguistic relations and to change the Romanian-lean Vlachs ("Ρουμανίζοντες Βλάχοι") into Italian-leaning Vlachs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proiectavdhela.ro/pdf/giuseppe_motta_the_fight_for_balkan_latinity.pdf The Fight for Balkan Latinity], Giuseppe Motta, Proiect Avhdela, p. 10 (data from report of the Italian officer Casoldi entitled: "Note circa la questione valacca" "Note about the Vlach Question" of May 29, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;

In the brief period of Italian occupation of southern [[Albania]], when Italian forces also entered Greek territory in 1917, Vlachs from several villages of the [[Pindos]] mountain requested autonomy under the protection of Italy, turning to Romania for help. Letters were sent to several countries, from mayors and representatives of 13 villages.&lt;ref name="Lascu" /&gt; A proclamation was sent on August 29, 1917 from Samarina signed by seven representatives, who had the role of a temporary committee and requested assistance / protection from the Italian Consulate of Ioannina.&lt;ref name="Lascu" /&gt; One of the members of the provisionary committee, [[Alcibiades Diamandi]] went to Ioannina to get an answer. There was an immediate response the next day from the Romanian and the Italian consulates: A clear answer that these actions were wrong and inappropriate, were not approved by anyone, and could not be supported by any party.&lt;ref name="Lascu" /&gt;

One day later, the Italian army departed from Greek territory. From 3 to 7 September the Greek forces entered unopposed all the villages and, on September 7, they arrested seven men in Samarina, giving an end to the events.&lt;ref name="Lascu"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These events are described in later bibliography as an attempt to form a "Principality of the Pindus", while in other sources, no name is assigned to the events of 1917 in Pindus.&lt;ref name="Kahl"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-ebpDLhkVWcC&amp;lpg=PA148&amp;dq=aromanians%20millet&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q=aromanians%20millet&amp;f=false The ethnicity of Aromanians after 1990: the Identity of a Minority that Behaves like a Majority], Thede Kahl, ''Ethnologia Balkanica'', Vol. 6 (2002), σελ. 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mylonas"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nv4fAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=aromanian%20schools%20Venizelos&amp;pg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Politics of Nation-Building: Making Co-Nationals, Refugees, and Minorities], Harris Mylonas, Cambridge University Press, 2013, σελ. 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A letter to the Prime Minister of Romania [[Ion C. Brătianu]], sent on 27 July 1917, was signed by mayors and notables of the following villages:&lt;ref name="Lascu"/&gt; [[Samarina]], Abella ([[Avdella]]), Perivole ([[Perivoli, Grevena|Perivoli]]), Baïassa ([[Vovousa]]), Amintchou (Metzova - [[Metsovo]]), Paléosseli ([[Palaioselli]]), Padzes ([[Pades, Ioannina|Pades]]), Touria ([[Kranea, Grevena|Kranea]]), Breazna ([[Distrato]]), Laca ([[Laista]]), Dobrinova ([[Iliochori]]), [[Armata, Greece|Armata]], Zmixi ([[Smixi]])

Furthermore, the assistance request to the Italian Consulate was signed by the seven members of the Provisional Committee:&lt;ref name="Lascu"/&gt;

==1941–1943: A Vlach "Roman Legion" supports the Italian occupation army==
{{main article|Vlach "Roman Legion"}}
The Aromanians were part of the projects for the dismemberment of Greece set up by the Italians. When the 11th Army occupied the areas in 1941, their commanders received orders by [[Palazzo Chigi]] (the Italian government/prime minister's premises) to survey each village recording their ethnicity and its attitude towards the occupiers, finding the Aromanians absorbed and assimilated in the Greek community with the exception of some groups who were recorded as anti-Bulgarian, anti-Greek, pro-Italian and pro-Romanian.&lt;ref&gt;Davide Rodogno. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcUNELPsQQsC&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA105#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fascism's European empire: Italian occupation during the Second World War]''. Cambridge University Press, 2006. p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; A pre-war dossier for the Italian government on the subject of the Aromanians promoted the idea that they were descendants from the [[Ancient Romans]] and that the Aromanians had taken shelter in the Pindus mountains against barbarian invasions, to be used at the appropriate moment.&lt;ref&gt;Davide Rodogno. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcUNELPsQQsC&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA105#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fascism's European empire: Italian occupation during the Second World War]''. Cambridge University Press, 2006. pp. 105-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Battle of Greece|fall of Greece]] to the Germans in spring 1941 and the division of the country among the Axis powers, [[Alcibiades Diamandi]] created a [[Separatism|collaborationist]] organisation known as the [[Vlach "Roman Legion"|Roman Legion]], with the support of the Italian occupation authorities and promoted the idea of a Vlach canton or semi-independent state, called several decades later by the name "Principality of Pindus" (even if it was never formed, nor proclaimed) that would encompass northwestern Greece. Diamandi also met the Greek collaborationist Prime Minister, [[Georgios Tsolakoglou]], but Tsolakoglou refused to accommodate his demands. In reality Italian "military authorities refused to permit any form of self-administration by the Aromanians in the awareness that their irredentist aspirations, or appeals for annexation to Italy, were a masquerade by a minority movement seeking political and economic revenge".&lt;ref&gt;Davide Rodogno. ''Fascism's European empire: Italian occupation during the Second World War''. Cambridge University Press, 2006. p. 326. {{ISBN|0-521-84515-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From mid-1942 on, the armed [[Greek Resistance]] also made its presence felt, fighting against the Italians and their collaborators and the leader of the Legionnaires, Diamandi, left for Romania in 1942, to be followed by his second in command and successor [[Nicolaos Matussis]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{gr icon}} [http://tovima.dolnet.gr/print_article.php?e=B&amp;f=12764&amp;m=S05&amp;aa=1 Η άλλη Ξένη], from the ''[[To Vima]]'' newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever authority the Legion exercised, it practically ceased to exist after the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|Italian capitulation]] in September 1943, when the control of Central Greece was taken over by the German army.

The '''Public Security Forces''' (PSF), formerly known as the '''Bahrain State Police''', are the principal [[Bahrain]]i law enforcement arm of the [[Ministry of Interior (Bahrain)|Ministry of Interior]]. They are commanded by Maj. Gen. Tarek Al Hasan and include all Ministry of Interior field units responsible for maintaining order and security in Bahrain.&lt;ref name="BICI"&gt;{{cite report |title=Report of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry |publisher=Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry |url=http://files.bici.org.bh/BICIreportEN.pdf |date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=52}}

== History ==
The Bahrain Police Directorate was first established in 1961 to address [[internal security]], and was headed by Shaikh [[Mohammed ibn Salman Al Khalifa]]. At the time of Bahrain's independence from Britain in 1971, the name of the Directorate was changed to the Ministry of Interior, and the State Police was renamed as Public Security Forces.&lt;ref name="MOI History"&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Staff writer]] | title = History of Police in the Kingdom of Bahrain | publisher=[[Ministry of the Interior (Bahrain)]] | url = http://www.interior.gov.bh/history_en.aspx | accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Departments ==
The following units and departments are among those that report directly to the PSF command:

*The police departments of four of the [[governorates of Bahrain]] (Manama, Muharraq, Shamaliyah and Junubiyah).
*The [[Special Security Force Command|Special Forces Department]].
*The Special Protections Department.
*The Counter Terrorism Centre.
*The General Directorate of Guards.
*The Traffic Police.
*The Operations Department.
*The Coast Guard.

== Role during 2011–present uprising ==
Members of the PSF were the law enforcement officers most often involved in crowd control, and thus in direct clashes with protesters, during the [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)|Bahraini uprising]]. According to a [[Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry]] (BICI) report issued in November 2011, they were equipped with "body armour, shields, batons, sound bombs, tear gas and shotguns." They undertook all operations to clear protesters from the [[Pearl Roundabout]], including one that took place on [[Bloody Thursday (2011)|Bloody Thursday]] which led to the death of four protesters. The PSF also carried out arrests, patrol missions and searches.&lt;ref name="BICI"/&gt;{{rp|pages=52–3}}

=== Human rights violations ===

According to the BICI report, PSF units involved in the Bahraini uprising used excessive force when dealing with protesters which led to many injuries, including loss of vision. The report stated:&lt;ref name="BICI"/&gt;{{rp|pages=266–7}}

{{quote|An examination of the evidence presented to the Commission has revealed that PSF units involved in the events of February/March 2011 and subsequent events in many situations violated the principles of necessity and proportionality, which are the generally applicable legal principles in matters relating to the use of force by law enforcement officials. This is evident in both the choice of weapons that were used by these forces during confrontations with civilians and the manner in which these weapons were used. ... [T]he Commission concludes that while it has not found evidence establishing a purposeful practice of the use of lethal force by PSF units during the performance of their duties, the PSF have, on many occasions, used force and firearms in situations where this was unnecessary and in a manner that was disproportionate.}}

However, as of May 2011, the [[Government of Bahrain]] has not taken any action against those who used excessive force against the protesters.&lt;ref name="HRF1"&gt;{{cite report |title=Bahrain: Speaking Softly |publisher=[[Human Rights First]] |url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Bahrain_Speaking_Softly_2011.pdf |date=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=10}}

==Helicopters==
The Public Security Forces originally operated a pair of [[Westland Scout]]s as well as a pair of [[Hughes 269|Hughes 269C]] helicopters.  Later deliveries included a pair of [[Sikorsky S-76]] helicopters as well as a [[McCulloch J-2]] autogyro and an unknown number of [[McDonnell Douglas MD 500 Defender|Hughes 500D]] scout helicopters.  Three [[Bell 412]] utility transport helicopters now form the main lift of the force, and a single [[Bell 427]] was acquired in 2001.&lt;ref name="scramble"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scramble.nl/orbats/bahrain/summary |title=Bahrain |publisher=Scramble |accessdate=4 January 2017 |work=Armed Forces Overviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
Mondesí was originally signed by the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] as an amateur free agent in 1988 out of the [[Dominican Republic]]. With the [[Great Falls Dodgers]] in 1990, he hit .303 with 30 stolen bases and was selected to the [[Pioneer League (baseball)|Pioneer League]] All-Star team. In 1991, he played in 21 games with the [[Bakersfield Dodgers]], 53 games with the [[San Antonio Missions]], and 2 with the [[Albuquerque Dukes]] hitting .277 with 8 home runs and 18 stolen bases. In 1992, he played 18 games with San Antonio and 35 with Albuquerque, hitting .296.  He spent all of 1993 with the Dukes, hitting .280 with 12 homers and 13 steals.

He made his Major League debut for the Dodgers on July 19, 1993, against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], hitting a single to center field as a pinch hitter in seventh inning against [[David West (baseball)|David West]] for his first major league hit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAN/LAN199307190.shtml Dodgers vs. Phillies box score July 19, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; He hit his first home run, a two run shot off [[Bob Scanlan]] in the 13th inning of a game against the [[Chicago Cubs]] on July 31.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHN/CHN199307310.shtml Dodgers vs. Cubs boxscore July 31, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the minors after the August 6 games, but was back with the Dodgers for good in September. He appeared in 42 games that season for the Dodgers, hitting .291 with four home runs.

Mondesí made the Dodgers opening day roster in 1994 and played in 112 games, hitting .306 with 16 homers, 56 RBI, and 11 stolen bases. He was selected as the [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|National League Rookie of the Year]].

In 1995, he was twice selected as [[Major League Baseball Player of the Week Award|National League Player of the Week]] (April 30 and July 5), he won the [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award]] and was selected to the [[1995 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]. He flew out to right field in his one at-bat in the All-Star game. He also competed in the [[Home Run Derby]]. Overall, he hit .285 with 26 home runs, 88 RBI, and 14 stolen bases. He had two hits in nine at-bats for the Dodgers in the [[1995 National League Division Series]] loss to the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. He was two for twelve in the [[1996 National League Division Series]] against the [[Atlanta Braves]], with two doubles.

In 1997, he hit .310 with 30 homers, 88 RBI, and 32 steals becoming the first Dodger player in history to join the [[30–30 club]]. He also won his second [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award]] and finished 15th in voting for the [[National League Most Valuable Player Award]]. In 1999, he again joined the 30–30 club with 33 homers and 36 steals, though his average had dipped to .253.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
On November 8, 1999, he was traded by the Dodgers (along with [[Pedro Borbón Jr.]]) to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] for [[Shawn Green]] and minor league player Jorge Nunez. He only played in 96 games during his first season in Toronto after he tore ligaments in his right elbow during a game on July 21, which required season-ending surgery. He played two and a half seasons with the Blue Jays, playing in 320 games and hitting 66 home runs. He won the [[Major League Baseball Player of the Week Award|American League Player of the Week Award]] for the week of May 6, 2001.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
He signed as a free agent with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] on February 24, 2004. By May he was talking of leaving the team for personal reasons, involving a legal dispute, in the Dominican Republic. He left the team on May 11, 2004 and his contract was terminated a week later

===Anaheim Angels===
The [[Anaheim Angels]] signed him on May 30, 2004. The deal was investigated by [[Major League Baseball]], as the circumstances were questionable, but the Angels were cleared of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jun/03/sports/sp-angrep3 Selig to Investigate Mondesi Deal]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after he signed with the Angels, he tore his quadriceps and was placed on the disabled list. He was released by the Angels in July for not showing up for his rehab therapy.

A '''regulatory haven''' is jurisdictions that have light [[financial regulation]] system. They often associated with having have lax tax regulation acting as [[tax haven]] and having [[Bank secrecy|financial secrecy]].  Regulatory haven's can be a state, country, or territory which maintains a system of financial secrecy and little or no financial regulation.  Some of the countries that are considered to be regulatory havens include [[Cayman Islands]], [[British Virgin Islands]], [[Singapore]] and [[Hong Kong]].  They are used by some [[financial firms]] to avoid strict financial regulation and is a form of [[regulatory arbitrage]].

It has been argued that the consequence of regulatory havens is increasing of inequality of income redistribution and increase [[systemic risk]] of financial markets in countries that operate well developed financial regulations while benefiting those jurisdictions that operate as regulatory havens by attracting business activity and economic development. 

==Characteristics==
Regulatory havens are used by [[market participant]]s in order to maximize their profit to exploit regulatory gaps. They take even more market risk that is, due to existence of the gap, not detected in a timely manner or is simply ignored by the regulatory agencies even if it is noticed. Companies that try to maximize their profits in this way more often than less take advantage of regulatory havens. Regulatory havens can be defined as jurisdictions that have light financial regulation system as well as lax tax regulation. Also, regulatory haven poses less strict reporting requirements and trading restrictions. Those mostly include low minimum capital required and opacity of the owners to conduct a business in a country that is considered to be regulatory haven. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moschella|first1=Manuela|title=Great expectation, slow transformations: incremental change in post-crisis regulation|date=2013|publisher=ECPR Press|location=UK|isbn=978-1-907301-54-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the countries that are considered to be regulatory havens include Caymans, Singapore and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Portes|first1=R|title=Threats to International Financial Stability|date=1987|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulatory havens can most easily be characterized as jurisdictions that have different tax system that is usually suitable for companies trying to use regulatory gaps to increase their profit and as jurisdictions that apply stricter confidentiality rules compared to the country where the company that uses such haven is placed (Morriss, Henson, 2013). Besides that regulatory havens, also often called offshore financial centers, can be characterized as follows:

* Jurisdictions that incorporate big number of various financial institutions that mostly conduct business with non-residential business subjects,
* Financial systems that are in possession of external assets and liabilities that are not proportional to the domestic financial intermediation and are primarily designed to support domestic economy and economic growth,
* Systems that offer multiple financial services to nonresidential business partners. Some of those services may include low or no taxation, light financial regulation as well as bank secret and anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sinha|first1=Neha|title=Offshore Financial Centers and Tax Havens – An overview|url=http://www.nishithdesai.com/fileadmin/user_upload/pdfs/Research%20Articles/Offshore%20Financial%20Centers.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==

As a financial system, regulatory haven can be divided in two components that include:
* Financial services. Financial services of regulatory havens are services provided and billed to nonresidential companies outside their domestic territory. These services may include some of the following: service fees for intermediaries, foreign exchange, financial leasing, commissions, trading in securities and other financial instruments, services in the context of asset management etc.
* Registration fees that are obligation for licensed entities such as offshore banks, international companies, insurance companies, trusts etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zorome|first1=Ahmed|title=Concept of Offshore Financial Centers: In Search of an Operational Definition|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2007/wp0787.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences ==

The concept of regulatory haven is often linked to the concept of tax haven. Tax haven can be defined as jurisdiction that requires low or no taxation and is characterized by strict banking secret. The information regarding taxes is not the subject of exchange with other countries, but if they are the achievement of restrictive conditions is required. Tax haven primarily ensures to nonresidential subjects and companies to avoid paying higher taxes in their domestic territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moschella|first1=Manuela|title=Great expectation, slow transformations: incremental change in post-crisis regulation|date=2013|publisher=ECPR Press|location=UK|isbn=978-1-907301-54-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disregarding the motivation for a company to establish business relationships within the jurisdictions that are classified as regulatory havens, that can include no tax obligation, banking secret or low regulatory requirements, and no matter the activity undertaken, the establishment of regulatory haven can be attributed to the effort to specialize the economy of a country in some type of business activity, for example export of financial services. This type of specialization most commonly attributes the need to generate revenues that in some countries represents majority of realized national income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zorome|first1=Ahmed|title=Concept of Offshore Financial Centers: In Search of an Operational Definition|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2007/wp0787.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to previously stated the main motivation to establish regulatory haven is to support domestic economy through business conducted with nonresidential companies by offering them better financial conditions for their business. That can also have negative consequences in the legal sense by enabling:
* Tax evasion which is a type of criminal behavior that includes deliberate concealment of full income, i. e. full amount of taxable income which is punishable by law in forms of fines and imprisonment.
* Tax avoidance that is a type of avoidance of paying full tax amount by using legal gaps, i. e. structures that enable reducing of one’s tax liability but in the limit that are “allowed” by law and tax regulations. The example of tax avoidance in the context of international company is partial relocation of assets within the jurisdiction that has lax regulations which is considered to be regulatory haven.
* Financial regulation avoidance that is considered to be avoidance of compliance with existing financial regulations, mostly in tax havens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loomer|first1=Geoffrey|title=Tax havens and the financial crisis|url=http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Business_Taxation/Docs/Publications/Policy_Papers/TaxHavensandtheFinancialCrisis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The direct consequence of regulatory havens is increasing of inequality of income redistribution. Since the higher incomes are mobile, regulatory havens protect those society members that earn more and enable them to increase their net profit due to lower tax base in regulatory haven. Consequently, society members that earn less pay more in taxes compared to wealthy individuals that use regulatory havens since they can be called upon their debts more reliably. Also, is contributes to social inequality since smaller producers face paying higher taxes even though they work more and usually work in worse working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rapaso|first1=A.M.|title=Tax havens or tax hells?|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Regulatory havens enable the concealment of income and that is one of its main attractions compared to non-haven states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schjederup|first1=G|title=International Tax and Public Finance|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

Since regulatory havens have impact of financial system, the necessity to develop control reactions has become mandatory. There are two possible directions that could be taken in order to regulate those jurisdictions that are considered to be regulatory havens. Those include the following:
* Unilateral measures that require the participation of state. Taking the state involvement into consideration, the unilateral measures include lifting of banking secret, financial transparency of outland jurisdictions, transfer prices adjustment, declaration of more strict regulatory requirements and additional measures such as reversed onus of proof.
* Multilateral measures include tax harmonization, transparency of information and control of electronic communication between banks and other financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rapaso|first1=A.M.|title=Tax havens or tax hells?|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic life==
Rottenburg studied social anthropology, sociology and Arab studies (1973-1978) at the [[Free University of Berlin]]. For his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[anthropology]] he conducted 39 months of [[fieldwork]] in [[South Kordofan]] (Sudan).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magazin.uni-halle.de/14469/forschen-zwischen-krieg-und-krise/ Ines Godazgar. ''Forschen zwischen Krieg und Krise.'' In: Scientia Halensis] Retrieved February 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1984-1987, he lectured at the University of Transkei, South Africa. Later he did research on formal organization in companies and city administrations in Europe. In the 1990s Rottenburg worked as a consultant for projects in development cooperation, carrying out research in Africa and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ethnologie.uni-halle.de/personal/richard_rottenburg/publications_richard_rottenburg/ a list of his consultancy paper] Retrieved March 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These engagements provided him with the ethnographic material for his [[habilitation]], which he completed at [[Viadrina European University]] (Frankfurt/Oder) in 1999. In 2002 Rottenburg became full professor and founding director of the Institute for Social and Cultural Anthropology at the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]]. There he established a research group around his research focus on Law, Organisation, Science and Technology (LOST).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologie.uni-halle.de/lost/ LOST homepage at the University of Halle-Wittenberg] Retrieved January 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; From 2006-2012 he was a Max Planck Fellow, heading a project on Biomedicine in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eth.mpg.de/cms/de/research/fellow_groups/mpfg01/bio-africa.html Homepage Biomedicine in Africa project at the MPI for Social Anthropology Halle, Germany] Retrieved January 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He was head or spokesperson of several research programs.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, he headed the program 'Traveling Models in Conflict Management' (2006-2009), funded by the Volkswagen Foundation.

==Research interests==
In his early work, Rottenburg's focus was on the effects of so-called modern traits in African settings. In his book on the life and economic strategies of the Lemwareng ([[Moro Nuba]]) in South Kordofan (Sudan) he conceptualized processes of [[cultural syncretization]] and hybridization as ''accretion'' (Akkreszenz). Rottenburg expanded this interest throughout his career, theorizing the travel of ideas, technologies and procedures and their intercultural translation, as well as the making of objectivity and rationality in various avenues. Thereby he combines insights from Science and Technology Studies with his expertise on Africa and his ethnographic attention to detail.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.dasts.dk/wp-content/uploads/Concept-Paper-STSAfirca.pdf his recent activities to establish a Network for Science and Technology Studies] Retrieved March 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in the book '[[Far-Fetched Facts]]', an 'epistemological thriller of development aid' as a critic of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung put it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/rezension-sachbuch-es-muss-umgekrempelt-sein-11323422.html Book review of the German version 'Weit hergeholte Fakten', FAZ December 2, 2002] Retrieved April 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

By connecting [[Social Anthropology]] to approaches from [[Science and Technology Studies]], Rottenburg is a leading figure in taking German anthropology in new directions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-bonn.de/~hevers/papers/Evers2004-Rottenburg.pdf Hans-Dieter Evers 2004.

[[File:Los Angeles River through downtown evening.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Los Angeles River]] is extensively channelized with concrete embankments.]]
'''River engineering''' is the process of planned human intervention in the course, characteristics, or flow of a river with the intention of producing some defined benefit. People have intervened in the natural course and behaviour of rivers since before recorded history—to manage the [[water resources]], to protect against flooding, or to make passage along or across rivers easier. From [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, rivers have been used as a source of [[hydropower]]. From the late 20th century, river [[engineering]] has had [[sustainability|environmental]] concerns broader than immediate human benefit and some river engineering projects have been concerned exclusively with the restoration or protection of natural characteristics and [[habitats]].

'''Hydromodification''' encompasses the systematic response to alterations to riverine and non-riverine water bodies such as coastal waters (estuaries and bays) and lakes.  The U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has defined hydromodification as the "alteration of the hydrologic characteristics of coastal and non-coastal waters, which in turn could cause degradation of water resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=1993 |title=Guidance Specifying Management Measures for Sources of Nonpoint Pollution in Coastal Waters |url=https://www.epa.gov/polluted-runoff-nonpoint-source-pollution/guidance-specifying-management-measures-sources-nonpoint |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=6–90 |id=EPA-840-B-92-002B}}&lt;/ref&gt; River engineering has often resulted in unintended systematic responses.

The river engineering discipline now strives to repair hydromodified degradations and account for potential systematic response to planned alterations by considering fluvial [[geomorphology]].  Fluvial geomorphology is the study of how rivers change their form over time.  Fluvial geomorphology is the cumulation of a number of sciences including open channel [[hydraulics]], [[sediment transport]], [[hydrology]], physical geology, and [[riparian]] ecology. River engineering attempts to understand fluvial geomorphology, implement a physical alteration, and maintain public safety.&lt;ref name="EPA-hydromod"&gt;{{cite report |date=2007 |title=National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Hydromodification |url=https://www.epa.gov/polluted-runoff-nonpoint-source-pollution/hydromodification-and-habitat-alteration-national |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-B-07-002}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3–13ff}}

==Characteristics of rivers==
The size of rivers above any [[tide|tidal]] limit and their average freshwater [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] are proportionate to the extent of their basins and the amount of rain which, after falling over these basins, reaches the river channels in the bottom of the valleys, by which it is conveyed to the sea.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=River Engineering |volume=23 |pages=374–385 |first=Leveson Francis |last=Vernon-Harcourt |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hydrography of the Pannonian basin before the river and lake regulations in the 19th century.jpg|thumb|Hydrography of the [[Pannonian basin]] before the river and lake regulations in the 19th century.]]
[[File:Mississippi River basin.jpg|thumb|The [[Mississippi River]] basin is the largest in the United States.]]
The [[drainage basin|basin]] of a river is the expanse of country bounded by a [[water divide|watershed]] (called a "divide" in North America) over which rainfall flows down towards the river traversing the lowest part of the valley, whereas the rain falling on the far slope of the watershed flows away to another river draining an adjacent basin. River basins vary in extent according to the configuration of the country, ranging from the insignificant drainage areas of streams rising on high ground very near the coast and flowing straight down into the sea, up to immense tracts of great continents, where rivers rising on the slopes of mountain ranges far inland have to traverse vast stretches of valleys and plains before reaching the ocean. The size of the largest river basin of any country depends on the extent of the continent in which it is situated, its position in relation to the hilly regions in which rivers generally arise and the sea into which they flow, and the distance between the [[source (river or stream)|source]] and the outlet into the sea of the river draining it.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The [[rate of fluid flow|rate of flow]] of rivers depends mainly upon their fall, also known as the gradient or slope. When two rivers of different sizes have the same fall, the larger river has the quicker flow, as its retardation by friction against its bed and banks is less in proportion to its volume than is the case with the smaller river. The fall available in a section of a river approximately corresponds to the slope of the country it traverses; as rivers rise close to the highest part of their basins, generally in hilly regions, their fall is rapid near their source and gradually diminishes, with occasional irregularities, until, in traversing plains along the latter part of their course, their fall usually becomes quite gentle. Accordingly, in large basins, rivers in most cases begin as [[torrent (stream)|torrent]]s with a very variable flow, and end as gently flowing rivers with a comparatively regular discharge.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[File:Thames Barrier 03.jpg|thumb|Flood control structures at the [[Thames Barrier]] in London.]]
The irregular flow of rivers throughout their course forms one of the main difficulties in devising works for mitigating inundations or for increasing the navigable capabilities of rivers. In tropical countries subject to periodical rains, the rivers are in [[flood]] during the [[rainy season]] and have hardly any flow during the rest of the year, while in [[temperate]] regions, where the rainfall is more evenly distributed throughout the year, [[evaporation]] causes the available rainfall to be much less in hot summer weather than in the winter months, so that the rivers fall to their low stage in the summer and are very liable to be in flood in the winter. In fact, with a temperate climate, the year may be divided into a warm and a cold season, extending from May to October and from November to April in the [[Northern hemisphere]] respectively; the rivers are low and moderate floods are of rare occurrence during the warm period, and the rivers are high and subject to occasional heavy floods after a considerable rainfall during the cold period in most years. The only exceptions are rivers which have their sources amongst mountains clad with perpetual snow and are fed by [[glaciers]]; their floods occur in the summer from the melting of snow and ice, as exemplified by the [[Rhône River|Rhône]] above the [[Lake of Geneva]], and the [[Arve]] which joins it below. But even these rivers are liable to have their flow modified by the influx of tributaries subject to different conditions, so that the Rhone below [[Lyon]] has a more uniform discharge than most rivers, as the summer floods of the Arve are counteracted to a great extent by the low stage of the [[Saône]] flowing into the Rhone at Lyon, which has its floods in the winter when the Arve, on the contrary, is low.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Another serious obstacle encountered in river engineering consists in the large quantity of [[detritus]] they bring down in flood-time, derived mainly from the disintegration of the surface layers of the hills and slopes in the upper parts of the valleys by glaciers, [[frost]] and rain. The power of a [[Current (stream)|current]] to transport materials varies with its [[velocity]], so that torrents with a rapid fall near the sources of rivers can carry down rocks, boulders and large [[Rock (geology)|stones]], which are by degrees ground by [[attrition (weathering)|attrition]] in their onward course into [[slate]], [[gravel]], [[sand]] and [[silt]], simultaneously with the gradual reduction in fall, and, consequently, in the transporting force of the current. Accordingly, under ordinary conditions, most of the materials brought down from the high lands by torrential water courses are carried forward by the main river to the sea, or partially strewn over flat [[alluvial]] plains during floods; the size of the materials forming the bed of the river or borne along by the stream is gradually reduced on proceeding seawards, so that in the [[Po River]] in Italy, for instance, pebbles and gravel are found for about 140 miles below [[Turin]], sand along the next 100 miles, and silt and mud in the last 110 miles (176&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Methods==
Improvements can be divided into those that are aimed at improving the flow of the river, particularly in flood conditions, and those that aim to hold back the flow, primarily for navigation purposes, although [[power generation]] is often an important factor. The former is known in the US as ''channelization'' and the latter is generally referred to as ''canalization''.

==Channelization==
[[File:Sechler Run looking upstream from Ferry Street.JPG|thumb|Channelized stream ([[Sechler Run]]) in [[Danville, Pennsylvania]]]]
Reducing the length of the channel by substituting straight cuts for a winding course is the only way in which the effective fall can be increased. This involves some loss of capacity in the channel as a whole, and in the case of a large river with a considerable flow it is very difficult to maintain a straight cut owing to the tendency of the current to erode the banks and form again a [[sinuous]] channel. Even if the cut is preserved by protecting the banks, it is liable to produce changes [[shoals]] and raise the flood-level in the channel just below its termination. Nevertheless, where the available fall is exceptionally small, as in land originally reclaimed from the sea, such as the English [[The Fens|Fenlands]], and where, in consequence, the drainage is in a great measure artificial, straight channels have been formed for the rivers. Because of the perceived value in protecting these fertile, low-lying lands from inundation, additional straight channels have also been provided for the discharge of rainfall, known as drains in the fens. Even extensive modification of the course of a river combined with an enlargement of its channel often produces only a limited reduction in flood damage. Consequently, such floodworks are only commensurate with the expenditure involved&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; where significant assets (such as a town) are under threat. Additionally, even when successful, such floodworks may simply move the problem further downstream and threaten some other town. Recent floodworks in Europe have included [[stream restoration|restoration]] of natural floodplains and winding courses, so that floodwater is held back and released more slowly.

The removal of obstructions, natural or artificial (e.g., trunks of trees, boulders and accumulations of gravel) from a river bed furnishes a simple and efficient means of increasing the discharging capacity of its channel. Such removals will consequently lower the height of floods upstream. Every impediment to the flow, in proportion to its extent, raises the level of the river above it so as to produce the additional artificial fall necessary to convey the flow through the restricted channel, thereby reducing the total available fall.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Human intervention sometimes inadvertently modifies the course or characteristics of a river, for example by introducing obstructions such as mining refuse, sluice gates for mills, fish-traps, unduly wide piers for bridges and solid weirs. By impeding flow these measures can raise the flood-level upstream. Regulations for the management of rivers may include stringent prohibitions with regard to [[water pollution|pollution]], requirements for enlarging [[Spillway|sluice-ways]] and the compulsory raising of their gates for the passage of floods, the removal of [[fish trap]]s, which are frequently blocked up by leaves and floating rubbish, reduction in the number and width of bridge [[piers]] when rebuilt, and the substitution of movable [[weirs]] for solid weirs.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

By installing [[Stream gauge|gauges]] in a fairly large river and its tributaries at suitable points, and keeping continuous records for some time of the heights of the water at the various stations, the rise of the floods in the different tributaries, the periods they take in passing down to definite stations on the main river, and the influence they severally exercise on the height of the floods at these places, can be ascertained. With the help of these records, and by observing the times and heights of the maximum rise of a particular flood at the stations on the various tributaries, the time of arrival and height of the top of the flood at any station on the main river can be predicted with remarkable accuracy two or more days beforehand. By communicating these particulars about a high flood to places on the lower river, weir-keepers are enabled to fully open the movable weirs beforehand to permit the passage of the flood, and riparian inhabitants receive timely warning of the impending inundation.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Where portions of a riverside town are situated below the maximum flood-level, or when it is important to protect land adjoining a river from inundations, the overflow of the river must be diverted into a flood-dam or confined within continuous [[levee|embankments]] on both sides. By placing these embankments somewhat back from the margin of the river-bed, a wide flood-channel is provided for the discharge of the river as soon as it overflows its banks, while leaving the natural channel unaltered for the ordinary flow. Low embankments may be sufficient where only exceptional summer floods have to be excluded from meadows. Occasionally the embankments are raised high enough to retain the floods during most years, while provision is made for the escape of the rare, exceptionally high floods at special places in the embankments, where the scour of the issuing current is guarded against, and the inundation of the neighboring land is least injurious. In this manner, the increased cost of embankments raised above the highest flood-level of rare occurrence is avoided, as is the danger of breaches in the banks from an unusually high flood-rise and rapid flow, with their disastrous effects.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Effects===
A most serious objection to the formation of continuous, high embankments along rivers bringing down considerable quantities of detritus, especially near a place where their fall has been abruptly reduced by descending from mountain slopes onto alluvial plains, is the danger of their bed being raised by deposit, producing a rise in the flood-level, and necessitating a raising of the embankments if inundations are to be prevented. Longitudinal sections of the Po River, taken in 1874 and 1901, show that its bed was materially raised during this period from the confluence of the [[Ticino]] to below [[Caranella]], despite the clearance of sediment effected by the rush through breaches.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Therefore, the completion of the embankments, together with their raising, would only eventually aggravate the injuries of the inundations they have been designed to prevent, as the escape of floods from the raised river must occur sooner or later.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In the UK, problems of flooding of domestic properties around the turn of the 21st century have been blamed{{By whom|date=May 2010}} on inadequate [[planning control]]s which have permitted development on floodplains. This exposes the properties on the floodplain to flood, and the substitution of concrete for natural strata speeds the run-off of water, which increases the danger of flooding downstream. In the [[Midwest|Midwestern United States]] and the Southern United States the term for this measure is ''channelization.'' Much of it was done under the auspices or overall direction of the [[United States Army]] [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]]. One of the most heavily channelized areas in the United States is [[West Tennessee]], where every major stream with one exception (the [[Hatchie River]]) has been partially or completely channelized.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Advantages===
Channelization of a stream may be undertaken for several reasons. One is to make a stream more suitable for navigation or for navigation by larger vessels with deep draughts. Another is to restrict water to a certain area of a stream's natural bottom lands so that the bulk of such lands can be made available for agriculture. A third reason is flood control, with the idea of giving a stream a sufficiently large and deep channel so that flooding beyond those limits will be minimal or nonexistent, at least on a routine basis. One major reason is to reduce natural [[erosion]]; as a natural waterway curves back and forth, it usually deposits [[sand]] and [[gravel]] on the inside of the corners where the water flows slowly, and cuts sand, gravel, [[subsoil]], and precious [[topsoil]] from the outside corners where it flows rapidly due to a change in direction. Unlike sand and gravel, the topsoil that is eroded does not get deposited on the inside of the next corner of the river. It simply washes away.

===Disadvantages===
Channelization has several predictable and negative effects. One of them is loss of [[wetlands]]. Wetlands are an excellent habitat for many forms of wildlife, and additionally serve as a "filter" for much of the world's surface fresh water. Another is the fact that channelized streams are almost invariably straightened. For example, the channelization of Florida's [[Kissimmee River]] has been cited as a cause contributing to the loss of wetlands.&lt;ref name=hinnant&gt;{{cite book |last=Hinnant |first=Lee |date=1970 |chapter=Kissimmee River |title=The Rivers of Florida |editor1-last=Marth |editor1-first=Del |editor2-last=Marth |editor2-first=Marty |url= |location=Sarasota, FL |publisher=Pineapple Press |page= |isbn=0-910923-70-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This straightening causes the streams to flow more rapidly, which can, in some instances, vastly increase soil erosion. It can also increase flooding downstream from the channelized area, as larger volumes of water traveling more rapidly than normal can reach choke points over a shorter period of time than they otherwise would, with a net effect of flood control in one area coming at the expense of greatly aggravated flooding in another. In addition, studies have shown that stream channelization results in declines of river fish populations.&lt;ref name="EPA-hydromod" /&gt;{{rp|3-1ff}}

A 1971 study of the [[Chariton River]] in northern [[Missouri]], United States, found that the channelized section of the river contained only 13 species of fish, whereas the natural segment of the stream was home to 21 species of fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Congdon |first=James C. |date=1971 |chapter=Fish populations of channelized and unchannelized sections of the Chariton River, Missouri |title=Stream Channelization–A Symposium |editor1-last=Schneberger |editor1-first=E. |editor2-last=Funk |editor2-first=J.E. |url= |publisher=North Central Division, American Fisheries Society |pages=52–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The biomass of fish able to be caught in the dredged segments of the river was 80 percent less than in the natural parts of the same stream. This loss of fish diversity and abundance is thought to occur because of reduction in habitat, elimination of riffles and pools, greater fluctuation of stream levels and water temperature, and shifting substrates. The rate of recovery for a stream once it has been dredged is extremely slow, with many streams showing no significant recovery 30 to 40 years after the date of channelization.&lt;ref name ="Brooker"&gt;"The Ecological Effects of Channelization (The Impact of River Channelization)." Brooker, M.P.''The Geographical Journal,'' 1985, 151, 1, 63–69, The Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern policy===
For the reasons cited above, in recent years stream channelization has been greatly curtailed in the U.S., and in some instances even partially reversed. The [[United States Government]] now has in place a "[[no net loss (wetlands)|no net loss]] of wetlands" policy that means that stream channelization in one place has to be offset by the creation of new wetlands in another, a process known as "mitigation."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of the Army and Environmental Protection Agency.  Washington, D.C. [http://www.epa.gov/owow/wetlands/regs/mitigate.html ''Memorandum Of Agreement between the Department Of The Army and the Environmental Protection Agency: The Determination of Mitigation under the Clean Water Act Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines.''] 6 February 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major agency involved in the enforcement of this policy is the same Army Corps of Engineers which for so long was the primary promoter of wide-scale channelization. Often, in the instances where channelization is permitted, boulders may be installed in the bed of the new channel so that water velocity is slowed, and channels may be deliberately curved as well. In 1990 the U.S. [[United States Congress|Congress]] gave the Army Corps a specific mandate to include environmental protection in its mission, and in 1996 it authorized the Corps to undertake restoration projects.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. [[Water Resources Development Act of 1990]], {{USC|33|1252}}, 2316.  [[Water Resources Development Act of 1996]], {{USC|33|2330}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Clean Water Act#Dredge and fill permits (wetlands)|Clean Water Act]] regulates certain aspects of channelization by requiring non-Federal entities (i.e. [[State governments of the United States|state]] and [[Local government in the United States|local]] governments, private parties) to obtain permits for [[dredging]] and filling operations. Permits are issued by the Army Corps with EPA participation.

This new policy also has its critics, however. Farmers who are losing land to soil erosion as channelized streams cease to be maintained feel particularly aggrieved. Not only are they losing their valuable property to erosion, the erosion ends up in the stream or river, and contributes to decreased [[water quality]]. They also point out that if such policies had been in place in the U.S. at the time of [[Colonial history of the United States|white settlement]], the country probably would never have become a leader in world agriculture and a net exporter of food. Channelization critics respond that this is immaterial, as we are no longer living in the era of initial settlement.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

[[Image:SchiffeMaxau.jpg|thumb|An early large channelization was performed by [[Johann Gottfried Tulla]] on the [[Upper Rhine]].]]
Rivers whose discharge is liable to become quite small at their low stage, or which have a somewhat large fall, as is usual in the upper part of rivers, cannot be given an adequate depth for navigation purely by works which regulate the flow; their ordinary summer level has to be raised by impounding the flow with weirs at intervals across the channel, while a [[canal lock|lock]] has to be provided alongside the weir, or in a side channel, to provide for the passage of vessels. A river is thereby converted into a succession of fairly level [[canal reach|reaches]] rising in steps up-stream, providing still-water navigation comparable to a canal; but it differs from a canal in the introduction of weirs for keeping up the water-level, in the provision for the regular discharge of the river at the weirs, and in the two sills of the locks being laid at the same level instead of the upper sill being raised above the lower one to the extent of the rise at the lock, as usual on canals.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Canalization secures a definite available depth for navigation; and the discharge of the river generally is amply sufficient for maintaining the impounded water level, as well as providing the necessary water for locking. Navigation, however, is liable to be stopped during the descent of high floods, which in many cases rise above the locks; and it is necessarily arrested in cold climates on all rivers by long, severe frosts, and especially by ice. Many small rivers, like the [[Thames]] above its tidal limit, have been rendered navigable by canalization, and several fairly large rivers have thereby provided a good depth for vessels for considerable distances inland. Thus the canalized [[Seine]] has secured a navigable depth of 10{{frac|1|2}} feet (3.2 metres) from its tidal limit up to Paris, a distance of 135 miles, and a depth of 6{{frac|3|4}} feet (2.06 metres) up to Montereau, 62 miles higher up.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Regulation works (flow and depth control)===
[[File:Piaskarka Wisła Warszawa 002.jpg|thumb|220px|A suction [[Dredging|dredge]] [[barge]] on the [[Vistula River]], [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]].]]
[[File:Piaskarka Wisła Warszawa 007.jpg|thumb|220px|Another suction dredge barge on the Vistula River, Warsaw, Poland.]]
As rivers flow onward towards the sea, they experience a considerable diminution in their fall, and a progressive increase in the basin which they drain, owing to the successive influx of their various tributaries. Thus, their current gradually becomes more gentle and their discharge larger in volume and less subject to abrupt variations; and, consequently, they become more suitable for navigation. Eventually, large rivers, under favorable conditions, often furnish important natural highways for inland navigation in the lower portion of their course, as, for instance, the [[Rhine]], the [[Danube]] and the [[Mississippi]]. River engineering works are only required to prevent changes in the course of the stream, to regulate its depth, and especially to fix the low-water channel and concentrate the flow in it, so as to increase as far as practicable the navigable depth at the lowest stage of the water level.

Engineering works to increase the navigability of rivers can only be advantageously undertaken in large rivers with a moderate fall and a fair discharge at their lowest stage, for with a large fall the current presents a great impediment to up-stream navigation, and there are generally great variations in water level, and when the discharge becomes very small in the dry season. It is impossible to maintain a sufficient depth of water in the low-water channel.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The possibility to secure uniformity of depth in a river by lowering the shoals obstructing the channel depends on the nature of the shoals. A soft [[shoal]] in the bed of a river is due to deposit from a diminution in velocity of flow, produced by a reduction in fall and by a widening of the channel, or to a loss in concentration of the scour of the main current in passing over from one concave bank to the next on the opposite side. The lowering of such a shoal by dredging merely effects a temporary deepening, for it soon forms again from the causes which produced it. The removal, moreover, of the rocky obstructions at rapids, though increasing the depth and equalizing the flow at these places, produces a lowering of the river above the rapids by facilitating the efflux, which may result in the appearance of fresh shoals at the low stage of the river. Where, however, narrow rocky reefs or other hard shoals stretch across the bottom of a river and present obstacles to the erosion by the current of the soft materials forming the bed of the river above and below, their removal may result in permanent improvement by enabling the river to deepen its bed by natural scour.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The capability of a river to provide a waterway for navigation during the summer or throughout the dry season depends on the depth that can be secured in the channel at the lowest stage. The problem in the dry season is the small discharge and deficiency in scour during this period. A typical solution is to restrict the width of the low-water channel, concentrate all of the flow in it, and also to fix its position so that it is scoured out every year by the floods which follow the deepest part of the bed along the line of the strongest current. This can be effected by closing subsidiary low-water channels with dikes across them, and narrowing the channel at the low stage by low-dipping cross dikes extending from the river banks down the slope and pointing slightly up-stream so as to direct the water flowing over them into a central channel.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Estuarine works==
The needs of navigation may also require that a stable, continuous, navigable channel is prolonged from the navigable river to deep water at the mouth of the [[estuary]]. The interaction of river flow and [[tide]] needs to be modeled by computer or using scale models, moulded to the configuration of the estuary under consideration and reproducing in miniature the tidal ebb and flow and fresh-water discharge over a bed of very fine sand, in which various lines of training walls can be successively inserted. The models should be capable of furnishing valuable indications of the respective effects and comparative merits of the different schemes proposed for works.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Background==

Homosexual acts began to be decriminalised in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1967 in [[England and Wales]], under the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]]. This change in law did not apply to the separate legal jurisdictions of [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Scotland]]. In 1975 the [[Northern Ireland Gay Rights Association]] was established to campaign for equivalent legislation for Northern Ireland. In response to the government's proposal to consider law reform, Paisley launched Save Ulster from Sodomy, a campaign given a further boost when decriminalisation was extended to Scotland in 1980. The campaign was based on his belief that the [[Bible]] condemns homosexuality as a [[sin]], which should therefore not be legally acceptable in a state founded on Christian principles.

[[LGBT rights in Northern Ireland]] were restricted by [[masculinist]] gender norms, in which [[paramilitary]] displays by [[Ulster loyalism|Ulster loyalists]] were common. [[Anti-Catholicism]] inflected [[misogyny|misogynist]] attitudes and vice-versa, with Paisley calling the [[Catholic Church]] the "mother of harlots and abominations of the Earth"&amp;mdash;Catholic iconography included comparatively more female figures than that of [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster|the Protestant church]], like [[Kathleen Ni Houlihan]] and the [[Virgin Mary]]. At the time of the campaign, violent attacks against gay men in Northern Ireland were common.&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt;

==Organization==
The campaign itself was particularly linked to the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster|Free Presbyterian]] wing of the DUP, and combined religious and political rhetoric. It focused on Paisley's belief in his role to save the "Ulster people" from those influences which he believed undermined their Christian beliefs and values, namely [[liberalism]] and [[secularism]]. &lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;Walsh, Fintan. [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10486801.2013.806324 "Saving Ulster from Sodomy and Hysteria: Sex, Politics and Performance."] ''Contemporary Theatre Review'' 23.3 (2013): 291-301.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the campaign, advertisements were placed in newspapers claiming that any change in the law "can only bring God's curse down upon our people". The group recruited 70,000 members to join the campaign mostly through outreach to church attendees.&lt;ref name="Duggan2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marian Duggan|title=Queering Conflict: Examining Lesbian and Gay Experiences of Homophobia in Northern Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bGvQZtOfrdAC&amp;pg=PA53|date=28 January 2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-9499-7|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End==
In 1981 the [[European Court of Human Rights]], in the case of [[Dudgeon v United Kingdom|''Jeffrey Dudgeon v the United Kingdom'']], found that the British Government was in breach of Article 8 (the right to a private life) of the [[European Convention of Human Rights]] by refusing to decriminalise homosexual acts between consenting adults in Northern Ireland. Consequently, despite Paisley's campaign, homosexual acts in Northern Ireland were decriminalised in 1982.

==Legacy==
The DUP remains opposed to homosexuality, and in September 2004 the British government agreed to postpone a vote in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on a Bill to provide for same-sex [[Civil union|civil partnerships]], to avoid a clash with talks aimed at restoring devolved rule in Northern Ireland. All six DUP [[Members of Parliament]] planned to vote against the Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/sep/19/uk.northernireland |title=Blair delays gay marriage bill to give Paisley party chance to vote |author=Henry McDonald |work=The Observer |date=19 September 2004 |accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, however, it was enacted as the [[Civil Partnership Act 2004]] and Northern Ireland was the first part of the [[British Isles]], to register a partnership. Although the DUP does not support [[gay marriage in Northern Ireland]], the all-Ireland party [[Sinn Féin]] does.&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6927">'''Social polarization'''  is associated with the segregation within a [[society]] that may emerge from [[income inequality]], real-estate fluctuations, economic displacements etc. and result in such differentiation that would consist of various social groups, from high-income to low-income.

One of the earlier stimulating research works on social polarization is from R.E. Pahl on [[Isle of Sheppey]],&lt;ref&gt;R. E. Pahl, Divisions of Labour, Oxford: Blackwell, 1984, {{ISBN|0-631-13273-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein he provides a comparison between the [[Pre-capitalist society]] and [[capitalist society]].

More recently, a number of research projects have been increasingly addressing the issues of social polarization within the developed economies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Moulaert]], [[Erik Swyngedouw]] and Arantxa Rodriguez. ''The Globalized City: Economic Restructuring and Social Polarization in European Cities''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-19-926040-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When social polarization occurs in addition to [[economic restructuring]], particularly in cities, economic inequality along social class and racial lines is exacerbated.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Urban Social Geography: An Introduction|last=Knox|first=Paul|last2=Pinch|first2=Steven|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|year=2006|isbn=978-0-13-124944-8|location=Harlow, England|pages=284–288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such separation can be best observed in the urban environment, “where [communities] of extreme wealth and social power are interspersed with places of deprivation, exclusion, and decline.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Globalized City: Economic Restructuring and Social Polarization in European Cities|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780191555527|editor-last=Moulaert|editor-first=Frank|location=Oxford|pages=12–14|quote=|editor-last2=Rodriguez|editor-first2=Arantxa|editor-last3=Swyngedouw|editor-first3=Erik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to how spatial compositions are managed in cities, the technologies used in regards to social relations can also contribute to social polarization&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (see ''Social Polarization &amp; The Media'').

Increased spatial segregation of socioeconomic groups correlates strongly with social polarization as well as [[social exclusion]] and societal fragmentation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Social polarization and the creative class ==
Aspects of this concept can also be associated with the phenomena of the [[creative class]] and how these members have created their own dominant status within society.  [[Globalization]] and its associated ”[[creative destruction]]" has contributed to great prosperity and growth for elites in many cities.  Conversely, the process of creative destruction is intrinsically spatially uneven, so some urban neighborhoods “at the receiving end” of globalization are harmed by it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Social polarization and urban poverty ==

Several theoretical models can be strung together to explain the basics that create social polarization, and the subsequent deprivation that occurs when there is extreme societal deprivation between those of high-wealth and low-wealth.  They are:
* a [[Culture of poverty|Culture of Poverty]]
* a [[Cycle of poverty|Cycle of Poverty]]
* [[Government failure|Government Failure]]—particularly when public policy institutions divided into departments (education, housing, etc.) are ineffective when it comes to dealing with the interdisciplinary problems of the poor
* an Inequitable Distribution of Resources/Opportunities
* [[Class conflict|Class Conflict]], and
* the concept of an "[[Underclass]]".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
When these phenomena are combined in urban areas, it can fuel social polarization.  Urban decay is a visual manifestation of social polarization, while riots, civil commotion and general social disintegration can be symptomatic of this concept as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, it can also lead to an [[informal economy]] in many urban areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Social polarization and the media ==
Digital media, and particularly [[social media]], could potentially play a role in encouraging social polarization.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch|first=Marc|date=October 2015|title=How the Media Trashed the Transitions|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/595926|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=26| issue = 4|pages=90–99|doi=10.1353/jod.2015.0070|pmid=|access-date=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because social media sites like [[Facebook]] can help cluster friends and acquaintances into [[Homophily|homophilous]] circles, and social news sites like [[Digg]] can facilitate a consumption of news that is biased by its user’s choices. In the extreme, a lack of “a common public sphere” could lead to isolated, polarized groups which could even be hostile towards one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webster|first=James G.|date=2011-02-01|title=The Duality of Media: A Structurational Theory of Public Attention|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2010.01375.x/abstract|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=43–66|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2010.01375.x|issn=1468-2885}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, during the [[Arab Spring]] uprisings, it was observed that social media furthered the social stratification already present in several Arab states.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

However, [[Cyberbalkanization|cyberbalkinization]], the phenomenon where media audiences fragment into "enclaves" where they only consume content they concur with—and thus theoretically promoting social polarization—may not have as much influence as believed.  Utilizing Nielsen television and Internet audience data, J.G. Webster found that ideological segmentation among media users was unlikely, as “even consumers of obscure niche media devoted most of their attention to more broadly appealing fare.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webster|first=James G.|last2=Ksiazek|first2=Thomas B.|date=2012-02-01|title=The Dynamics of Audience Fragmentation: Public Attention in an Age of Digital Media|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01616.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=62|issue=1|pages=39–56|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01616.x|issn=1460-2466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet Webster does admit that his research does not measure the particular nature of the subject matter consumed , or how strongly it affected the media viewers’ perceptions of society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The '''Socialist Party of America''' ('''SPA''') was a multi-tendency [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] and [[Social democracy|social democratic]] [[political party]] in the [[United States]] formed in 1901 by a merger between the three-year-old [[Social Democratic Party of America]] and disaffected elements of the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]] which had split from the main organization in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Note that the Socialist Party of America was also known at various times in its long history as the Socialist Party of the United States (as early as the 1910s) and Socialist Party USA (as early as 1935, most common in the 1960s). The original, official name of the organization was Socialist Party of America.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first decades of the 20th century, it drew significant support from many different groups, including [[trade union]]ists, [[Progressivism|progressive]] social reformers, [[Populism|populist]] farmers and [[immigrant]]s. However, it refused to form coalitions with other parties, or even to allow its members to vote for other parties. [[Eugene V. Debs]] twice won over 900,000 votes in presidential elections ([[United States presidential election, 1912|1912]] and [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920]]) while the party also elected two [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] ([[Victor L. Berger]] and [[Meyer London]]), dozens of state legislators, more than a hundred mayors and countless lesser officials.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Weinstein (author)|James Weinstein]], ''The Decline of Socialism in America, 1912-1925'', New York: Vintage Books, 1969, pp. 116–118 (Tables 2 and 3).&lt;/ref&gt; The party's staunch [[American entry into World War I#In the United States|opposition to American involvement in World War I]], although welcomed by many, also led to prominent defections, official repression and vigilante persecution. The organization was further shattered by a factional war over how to respond to the [[October Revolution]] in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] in 1917 and the establishment of the [[Communist International]] in 1919—many members left the party in favor of the [[Communist Party USA]].

After endorsing [[Robert M. La Follette]]'s [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924–34)|presidential campaign in 1924]], the party returned to independent action at the presidential level. It had modest growth in the early 1930s behind presidential candidate [[Norman Thomas]]. The party's appeal was weakened by the popularity of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], the organization and flexibility of the Communist Party under [[Earl Browder]] and the resurgent [[Labor history of the United States|labor movement]]'s desire to support sympathetic [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politicians. A divisive and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to broaden the party by admitting followers of [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Jay Lovestone]] caused the traditional "Old Guard" to leave and form the [[Social Democratic Federation (U.S.)|Social Democratic Federation]]. While the party was always strongly [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] as well as [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]], its [[Opposition to World War II|opposition to American entry in World War II]] cost it both internal and external support.

The party stopped running presidential candidates after [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956]], when its nominee [[Darlington Hoopes]] won fewer than 6,000 votes. In the party's last decades, its members, many of them prominent in the labor, peace, civil rights and civil liberties movements, fundamentally disagreed about the [[History of the socialist movement in the United States|socialist movement]]'s relationship to the [[Labor history of the United States|labor movement]] and the Democratic Party and about how best to advance democracy abroad. In 1970–1973, these strategic differences had become so acute that the Socialist Party of America changed its name to [[Social Democrats, USA]]. Leaders of two of its caucuses formed separate socialist organizations, the [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] and the [[Socialist Party USA]], the former of which became a precursor to the largest socialist organization in the United States in 2018, the [[Democratic Socialists of America]].

From 1901 to the onset of [[World War I]], the Socialist Party had numerous elected officials throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/moves/SP_map-mix.shtml|title=Socialist Party votes and members|website=depts.washington.edu|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two Socialist members of Congress, [[Meyer London]] of [[New York City]] and [[Victor Berger]] of [[Milwaukee]] (a part of the [[Sewer Socialism|sewer socialism]] movement, a major front in socialism, Milwaukee being the first and the only major city to elect a socialist mayor, which it did four times between 1910 and 1956); [[List of Socialist Party Mayors (United States)|over 70 mayors]]; and many [[state legislature (United States)|state legislators]] and city councilors. Its voting strength was greatest among recent Jewish, Finnish and German immigrants, coal miners and former populist farmers in the Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;David Shannon, ''The Socialist Party of America: A History.'' (1955)&lt;/ref&gt; From 1900 (before its formal union) to 1912, it ran [[Eugene V. Debs]] for President at each election. The best showing ever for a socialist ticket was in [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912]], when Debs gained 901,551 total votes, or 6% of the popular vote. In [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920]], Debs ran again, this time while imprisoned for opposing World War I and received 913,693 votes, 3.4% of the total.

Early political perspectives ranged from radical socialism to social democracy, with New York party leader [[Morris Hillquit]] and Congressman Berger on the more social democratic or right-wing of the party and radical socialists and syndicalists, including members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) and the party's frequent candidate, Eugene V. Debs, on the left-wing of the party. There were also [[agrarianism|agrarian]] utopian-leaning radicals, such as [[Julius Wayland]] of Kansas, who edited the party's leading national newspaper, ''[[Appeal to Reason (newspaper)|Appeal to Reason]]'', along with trade unionists; Jewish, Finnish and German immigrants; and intellectuals such as [[Walter Lippmann]] and the Black activist/intellectual [[Hubert Harrison]]. The party outsourced its newspapers and publications so that it would not have an internal editorial board that was a power in its own right. The result was that a handful of outside publishers dominated the published messages the party distributed and agitated for a much more radical anti-capitalistic revolutionary message the party itself tolerated. The ''Appeal to Reason'' newspaper thus became part of its radical left-wing as did the [[Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company]] of Chicago, which produced over half of the pamphlets and books that were sold at party meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Jason D. Martinek, "Business at the Margins of Capitalism: Charles H. Kerr and Company and the Progressive Era Socialist Movement." ''Business &amp; Economic History On-Line'' 8 (2010).

Positions in the party on [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] varied and were the subject of heated debate from its foundation to the 1919 split. At its founding convention, a resolution was presented in favor of "equal rights for all human beings without distinction of color, race or sex", specifically highlighting African Americans as particularly oppressed and exploited and calling for them to be organised by the socialist and labor movements. This was opposed by a number of white delegates, who argued that specific appeals to black workers were unnecessary. Whilst two of the black delegates present agreed with this position, the third, William Costley, held that blacks were in "a distinct and peculiar position in contradiction to other laboring elements in the United States". Costley introduced his own resolution, which also condemned the campaign of "lynching, burning and disenfranchisement" which black Americans suffered. Costley's resolution was passed, albeit with the language on "lynching, burning and disenfranchisement" removed.&lt;ref name=jacobin&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jacobinmag.com/2018/04/socialism-marx-race-class-struggle-color-line|title=Socialism and Black Oppression|last=Heideman|first=Paul|date=April 30, 2018|website=[[Jacobin (magazine)]]|accessdate=May 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the passage of the resolution enshrined a commitment to opposing racism, sections of the party continued to argue against this. For example, Victor Berger drew on [[scientific racism]] to claim that blacks and [[mulatto]]es "constitute[d] a lower race". They were opposed by others who defended the spirit of the resolution, most notably Debs. This spread of opinion was reflected in the drawing up of constitutions by state parties in the [[Southern United States|South]]. The [[Socialist Party of Louisiana]] initially adopted a "negro clause" which opposed [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchisement of blacks]], but it supported segregation. The clause was supported by some Southern socialists whilst being opposed by others, although this was not because of its accommodation of racism as such, but because it officially enshrined this accommodation. The party's National Committee persuaded the Louisiana party to withdraw the clause. However, when the state party subsequently established segregated branches, this was not opposed by the wider party.&lt;ref name=jacobin/&gt;

Elsewhere, the 1912 platform of the Tennessee party stated that [[White supremacy|white supremacist ideology]] was a tool of the capitalist class to [[divide and rule]] the working class whilst the Virginia party passed a resolution three years earlier to focus more attention on encouraging solidarity between black and white workers and to invite non-white workers to join the party. Most notable was the [[Socialist Party of Oklahoma]], which led opposition to the state's 1910 ballot initiative on [[Guinn v. United States|a grandfather clause to prevent blacks from voting]], with prominent party member [[Oscar Ameringer]] writing the ballot argument against it and the party launched an unsuccessful lawsuit to prevent the question from going to the ballot. Party propaganda argued that if working-class solidarity did not extend across racial lines, then blacks would be exploited as [[strikebreaker]]s and as an instrument or repression by the [[ruling class]]. The state party's 1912 platform stated that "safety and advancement of the working class depends upon its solidarity and class consciousness. Those who would engender or foster race hatred or animosity between the white and black sections of the working class are the enemies of both". This stance earned the party support from key black leaders in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/04/teachers-strikes-oklahoma-socialism-sanders-unions|title=Red Oklahoma|last=Blanc|first=Eric|date=April 13, 2018|website=[[Jacobin (magazine)]]|accessdate=May 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jacobin/&gt;

More widely, anti-racist socialists were spurred to action by the [[Springfield race riot of 1908]]. Socialist writer [[William English Walling]]'s reporting on the riot inspired another socialist, [[Mary White Ovington]], among others, to work with prominent black leaders such as [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Ida B. Wells]] and [[Mary Church Terrell]] to establish the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]]. Walling and Ovington both argued inside the party that it had not done enough to oppose racism and they were joined by other left-wing intellectuals who published articles in the party press about the importance of anti-racism to the socialist cause, including [[Hubert Harrison]] and [[I. M. Rubinow]].&lt;ref name=jacobin/&gt;

The party had a tense and complicated relationship with the [[American Federation of Labor]]. The American Federation of Labor leadership, headed by [[Samuel Gompers]], was strongly opposed to the Socialist Party, but many rank and file unionists in the early party of the 20th century saw in the Socialists reliable political allies. Many moderate Socialists, such as Victor Berger and [[International Typographical Union]] President [[Max S. Hayes]], urged close cooperation with the American Federation of Labor and its member unions. Others in the Socialist Party's ranks dismissed the American Federation of Labor and its [[craft union]]s as antiquated and irrelevant, instead favoring the much more radical IWW and the syndicalist path to socialism.

In 1911, IWW leader [[Bill Haywood|William "Big Bill" Haywood]] was elected to the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, on which American Federation of Labor partisan Morris Hillquit also served. The syndicalist and the electoral socialist squared off in a lively public debate in New York City's [[Cooper Union]] on January 11, 1912, with Haywood declaring that Hillquit and the Socialists ought to try "a little sabotage in the right place at the proper time" and attacked Hillquit for having abandoned the class struggle by helping the New York garment workers negotiate an industrial agreement with their employers. Hillquit replied that he had no new message rather than to reiterate a belief in a two-sided workers movement, with separate and equal political and trade union arms. "A mere change of structural forms would not revolutionize the American labor movement as claimed by our extreme industrialists", he declared.&lt;ref&gt;Hillquit, "What shall the Attitude of the SP Be Toward the Economic Organization of the Workers?" (Haywood Debate) in Hillquit Papers; quoted in Pratt, ''Morris Hillquit: A Political History of an American Jewish Socialist,'' p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of "syndicalism vs. socialism" was bitterly fought over the next two years, consummated by "Big Bill" Haywood's recall from the Socialist Party's National Executive Committee (NEC) and the departure of a broad section of the left-wing from the organization. The memory of this split made the intra-party battles of 1919–1921 all the more bitter.

[[File:Eugene V Debs 1912.jpg|thumb|Debs was the founding member of the Socialist Party of America]]
The party's opposition to [[World War I]] caused a sharp decline in membership. Radicals moved further left into the IWW or to the [[Communist Party USA]]. Members who supported the war effort quit, ranging from the rank and file to prominent intellectuals such as [[Walter Lippmann]], [[John Spargo]], [[James Graham Phelps Stokes]] and [[William English Walling]]. Some briefly formed the [[National Party (United States)|National Party]] in an unrealized hope of merging with the remnants of [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] and the [[Prohibition Party]]. Official membership fell from 83, 284 in 1916 to 74,519 in 1918. By 1918, the Socialist Party had won 1,200 political offices, including electing 1 Congressman, 32 state representatives and 79 mayors.&lt;ref&gt;Democratic Socialism: A Global Survey Donald F. Busky&lt;/ref&gt; It gained new votes in ethnic strongholds such as Milwaukee and New York from conservative German Americans who also opposed the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Year Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZLpFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA445|year=1919|page=445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1918, the Socialist Party's long-time leader Eugene V. Debs made an anti-draft speech,&lt;ref&gt;Eugene V. Debs, "The Canton, Ohio Speech, Anti-War Speech", delivered June 16, 1918, first published 1918 in ''The Call'', [http://marxists.org/archive/debs/works/1918/canton.htm online at Marxists.org], accessed 11 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; calling for [[draft resistance]]. Urging young men to ignore the draft law was a crime under the [[Sedition Act of 1918]] and Debs was convicted and sentenced to serve ten years in prison. He and two dozen others were pardoned by President [[Warren G. Harding]] at Christmas time 1921.

=== Split of the Left Wing Section (1919–1921) ===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}
In January 1919, [[Vladimir Lenin]] invited the IWW and the radical wing of the Socialist Party to join in the founding of the Communist Third International, the [[Comintern]].

The [[Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party]] emerged as an organized faction early that same year, building its organization around a lengthy [[Left Wing Manifesto]] authored by [[Louis C. Fraina]]. This effort to organize in order to "win the Socialist Party for the Left Wing" met with staunch resistance from the "Regulars" who controlled a big majority of the seats of the Socialist Party's governing NEC. When it seemed certain that the 1919 party elections for a new NEC had been dominated by the Left Wing, the sitting NEC, citing voting irregularities, refused to tally the votes, declared the entire election invalid and in May 1919 suspended the party's Russian, Latvian, Ukrainian, Polish, South Slavic and Hungarian [[language federations]], in addition to the entire state organization of Michigan. In future weeks, the state organizations of Massachusetts and Ohio would similarly be disfranchised and "reorganized" by the NEC while in New York and Pennsylvania the "Regular" State Executive Committees undertook reorganization of Left Wing branches and locals on a case-by-case basis.

[[File:Socialist-defendants-1919.jpg|thumb|left|Executive Secretary [[Adolph Germer]] was one of top five Socialist of America leaders prosecuted by the Department of Justice in 1919]]
In June 1919, the Left Wing Section held a conference in New York City to discuss their organizational plans. The group found themselves deeply divided, with one section, led by NEC members [[Alfred Wagenknecht]] and [[L. E. Katterfeld]] and including famed radical journalist [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]] favoring a continued effort to gain control of the SPA at its forthcoming Emergency National Convention in Chicago, to be held at the end of August, while another section, headed by the [[Russian Socialist Federation]] of [[Alexander Stoklitsky]] and [[Nicholas I. Hourwich|Nicholas Hourwich]] and the Socialist Party of Michigan seeking to wash their hands of the Socialist Party and immediately move to the establishment of a new [[Communist Party USA#Formation and early history .281919–1921.29|Communist Party of America]]. Eventually, this latter Federation-dominated group was joined by important Left Wingers [[Charles Ruthenberg|C. E. Ruthenberg]] and Louis Fraina, a depletion of Left Wing forces which made the result of the 1919 Socialist Convention a foregone conclusion.

Regardless, the plans of Wagenknecht and Reed to fight it out at the [[1919 Emergency National Convention]] continued apace. With the most radical state organizations effectively purged by the Regulars (Massachusetts, Minnesota) or unable to participate (Ohio, Michigan) and the Left Wing language federations suspended, a big majority of the hastily elected delegates to the gathering were controlled by the Executive Secretary [[Adolph Germer]] and the Regulars. A group of Left Wingers without delegate credentials, including Reed and his sidekick [[Benjamin Gitlow]], made an effort to occupy chairs on the convention floor before the gathering was called into order. The incumbents were unable to block the Left Wingers at the door, but soon called the already present police to their aid and the officers of the law obligingly expelled the boisterous radicals from the hall. With the Credentials Committee firmly in the hands of the Regulars from the outset, the outcome of the gathering was no longer in doubt and most of the remaining Left Wing delegates departed, to meet with other co-thinkers downstairs in a previously reserved room in a parallel convention. It was this gathering which established itself as the [[Communist Labor Party of America|Communist Labor Party]] on August 31, 1919.

Meanwhile, elsewhere in Chicago the Federations and Michiganders and their supporters established the Communist Party of America at a convention gaveled to order on September 1, 1919. Unity between these two communist organizations was a lengthy and complicated process, formally taking place at a secret convention held at the [[Overlook Mountain House]] hotel near [[Woodstock, New York]] in May 1921 with the establishment of a new unified Communist Party of America.

A Left Wing loyal to the Communist International remained in the Socialist Party through 1921, continuing the fight to bring the Socialist Party into the ranks of the Comintern. This group, which opposed the underground secret organizations which the Communist Parties had become, included noted party journalist [[J. Louis Engdahl]] and [[William F. Kruse|William Kruse]], head of the party's youth affiliate, the [[Young People's Socialist League (1907)|Young People's Socialist League]], as well as a significant segment of the Socialist Party's Chicago organization. These left-wing dissidents continued to make themselves heard until their departure from the party after the convention of 1921.

=== Expulsion of Socialists from the New York Assembly (1920) ===
On January 7, 1920, less than a week after the [[Palmer Raids]] had swept and stunned the country, a new session of the [[New York State Assembly]] was called to order. The majority Republicans easily elected their candidate for the Speaker, [[Thaddeus C. Sweet]] and after opening day formalities the body took a brief recess. Back in session, Sweet declared: "The Chair directs the Sergeant-at-Arms to present before the Bar of the House [[Sam DeWitt|Samuel A. DeWitt]], [[Samuel Orr]], [[Louis Waldman]], [[Charles Solomon (politician)|Charles Solomon]], and [[August Claessens]]", the Assembly's five Socialist members.

[[File:Five Socialist Assemblymen.jpg|thumb|523px|The five Socialist Assemblymen suspended by the New York Legislature in January 1920]]
Sweet attacked the five, declaring they had been "elected on a platform that is absolutely inimical to the best interests of the state of New York and the United States". The Socialist Party, Sweet said, was "not truly a political party", but was rather "a membership organization admitting within its ranks aliens, enemy aliens, and minors". The party had denounced America's participation in the European war and had lent aid and comfort to [[Ludwig Martens]], the "self-styled Soviet Ambassador and alien, who entered this country as a German in 1916". It had supported the revolutionaries in [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|Germany]], Austria and [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungary]], Sweet continued; and consorted with international Socialist parties close to the [[Communist International]].&lt;ref&gt;Louis Waldman,'' Albany: The Crisis in Government: The History of the Suspension, Trial and Expulsion from the New York State Legislature in 1920 of the Five Socialist Assemblymen by Their Political Opponents.'' New York: Boni and Liveright, 1920; pp. 2-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Sweet concluded:&lt;ref&gt;Waldman, ''Albany: The Crisis in Government,'' p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is every citizen's right to his day in court. If this house should adopt a resolution declaring your seat herein vacant, pending a hearing before a tribunal of this house, you will be given an opportunity to appear before such tribunal to prove your right to a seat in this legislative body, and upon the result of such hearing and the findings of the Assembly tribunal, your right to participate in the actions of this body will be determined.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Assembly suspended the quintet by a vote of 140 to 6, with one Democrat supporting the Socialists. Civil libertarians and concerned citizens raised their voices to aid the suspended Socialists and protest percolated throughout the press. The principal argument was that majority parties expelling elected members of minority parties from their councils set a dangerous precedent in a democracy.&lt;ref&gt;In his history of the 1920 expulsions written just after the fact, Socialist Assemblyman Louis Waldman noted that "expressions of astonishment and indignation flowed in from all parts of the world," including public figures from England, France, Italy, and Argentina. Waldman, ''Albany: The Crisis in Government,'' p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The battle culminated in a highly publicized trial in the Assembly, which dominated the body's activity from its opening on January 20, 1920 until its conclusion on March 11. Socialist Party leader and former 1917 New York City mayoral candidate [[Morris Hillquit]] served as chief counsel for the suspended Socialists, aided by party founder and future Socialist vice presidential candidate, [[Seymour Stedman]].

At the trial, Hillquit charged that Speaker Sweet had made a "specific, concrete, definite, affirmative declaration of guilt" of the five Assemblymen before they were ever charged with any offense. It was the chief accuser, Speaker Sweet, who also appointed the members of the Judiciary Committee to which the matter was referred. "Thus the accuser selects his own judges", Hillquit declared.&lt;ref&gt;Waldman, ''Albany: The Crisis in Government,'' pp. 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt; Hillquit sought to remove for reasons of bias any members of the Judiciary Committee who had taken part in the activities of the [[Lusk Committee]], the New York State Senate's anti-radicalism committee. Hillquit particularly challenged the presence of Assemblyman [[Louis A. Cuvillier]], who had stated on the floor of the house the previous night words to the effect that "if the five accused Assemblymen are found guilty, they ought not to be expelled, but taken out and shot".&lt;ref&gt;Waldman, ''Albany: The Crisis in Government,'' p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly voted overwhelmingly for expulsion on April 1, 1920.

A special election was held September 16, 1920, to fill the five seats vacated by the Assembly, with each of the five expelled Socialists running for re-election against a "fusion" candidate representing the combined Republican and Democratic parties. All five Socialists were returned to office.&lt;ref&gt;In the 8th New York County Assembly District Louis Waldman beat Morris B. Reiss 3,222 to 3,066; in the 17th New York County AD August Claessens beat Augusta Rosenzweig 3,735 to 2,220; in the 3rd Bronx AD Samuel DeWitt beat Milton Altschuler 3,865 to 2,310; in the 40th Bronx AD Samuel Orr beat James J. Collins 4,171 to 3,063; and in the 23rd Kings AD Charles Solomon beat Jonathan Schneider 2,816 to 1,521. ''Minnesota Daily Star,'' September 17, 1920, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the five, Waldman, Claessens and Solomon, were again denied their seats after a contentious debate by votes of 90 to 45 on September 21, 1920. Orr and DeWitt, deemed less culpable than their peers by the earlier findings of the Judiciary Committee, were seated by votes of 87 to 48. In solidarity with their ousted colleagues, the pair refused to take their seats.&lt;ref name="Ousted"&gt;"Socialists Again Ousted by New York Assembly," ''Minnesota Daily Star,'' September 22, 1920, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the five seats were again vacated, Morris Hillquit expressed his disappointment at the "unconstitutional action" of the Assembly. However, Hillquit continued that "it will draw the issues clearer between the united Republican and Democratic parties representing arbitrary lawlessness, and the Socialist Party, which stood and stands for democratic and representative government".&lt;ref name="Ousted"/&gt;

The legislature attempted to prevent the election and seating of Socialists in the future by passing laws designed to exclude the Socialist Party from recognition as a political party and to alter the legislature's oath-taking procedures so that elected members could be excluded before being sworn. Governor [[Al Smith]] vetoed the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe C.E. Brown, ''History of the State of New York: Political and Government'', vol. IV: 1896-1920 (Syracuse: Syracuse Press, 1922), 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quest for a mass Farmer–Labor Party (1922–1925) ===
[[File:Hillquit-morris-2.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Morris Hillquit]], Chairman of the Socialist Party of America from the death of Debs until he himself died in 1933]]
In the first half of 1919, the Socialist Party had over 100,000 dues paying members and by the second half of 1921 it had been shattered. Fewer than 14,000 members remained in party ranks, with the departure of the large and well-funded [[Finnish Socialist Federation]] adding to the malaise.&lt;ref&gt;For a documented party membership series, see: http://www.marxisthistory.org/subject/usa/eam/spamembership.html&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1921, the NEC of the party determined that the time had come to end the party's historic aversion to "fusion" with other political organizations and issue an appeal declaring that the "forces of every progressive, liberal, and radical organization of the workers must be mobilized" to repel conservative assaults and "advance the industrial and political power of the working class".

This desire for common action seems to have been shared by various unions as late in 1921 a call was issued in the name of the country's 16 major railway labor unions seeking a [[Conference for Progressive Political Action]] (CPPA). The CPPA was originally intended to be an umbrella organization bringing together various elements of the farmer and labor movement together in a common program. Invitations to the group's founding conference were issued to members of a wide variety of "progressive" organizations of widely varied perspectives. As a result, from its inception the heterogeneous body was unable to agree on even a program or even a declaration of principles, let alone congeal into a new political party.

The Socialist Party was an enthusiastic supporter of the CPPA and the group dominated its thinking from the start of 1922 through the first quarter of 1925. In this period of organizational weakness, the party sought to forge lasting ties with the existing trade union movement leading in short order to a mass labor party in the United States on the British model.

A first National Conference of the CPPA was held in Chicago in February 1922, attended by 124 delegates representing a broad spectrum of labor, farmer and political organizations. The gathering passed an "Address to the American People", stating its criticism of existing conditions and formally proposing an amorphous plan of action validating the status quo ante: the labor unions on the group's right-wing to endorse labor-friendly candidates of the Democratic Party, the Socialists and Farmer-Labor Party adherents on the group's left wing to conduct their own independent campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Solon DeLeon and Nathan Fine (eds.), The American Labor Year Book, 1923-1924. New York: Rand School Press, 1922; pp. 147-149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Otto Branstetter, et al., "The Conference for Progressive Political Action," ''The Socialist World,'' Feb. 1922, pp. 1, 3, and documents in same issue, pp. 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt; From the Socialist Party's perspective, perhaps the most important thing the CPPA did at its first National Conference was agree to meet again. The party leadership understood the process of building an independent [[Third party (United States)|third party]] which could count on the allegiance of the country's trade union leadership would be a protracted process and the mere fact of "agreement to disagree", but nevertheless meeting again was regarded as a step forward.

The communist movement also sought to pursue the strategy of bursting from its isolation through the formation of a mass Farmer-Labor Party. Finally emerged from its underground existence in 1922, the Communists' through their "legal political party", the [[Workers Party of America]], decided to send four delegates to the December 1922 gathering of the CPPA.&lt;ref&gt;WPA delegates, as determined by the December 5, 1922, meeting of the WPA's "Administrative Council" were [[William F. Dunne]], [[Caleb Harrison]], [[Ludwig Lore]], and C. E. Ruthenberg. Comintern Archive: f. 515, op. 1, d. 148, l. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Credentials Committee after protracted debate strongly objected to the participation of Communist representatives in its proceedings and issued a recommendation that the representatives of the Workers Party and its youth organization not be seated. The Socialist Party's delegates were strongly in favor of the exclusion of the Communists and acted accordingly, even though the two organizations shared a vision of a party akin to the [[British Labour Party]] in which constituent political groups jointly participated while retaining their independent existence. The fissure between the organizations was thus widened.

As with the first conference, the 2nd Conference of the CPPA split over the all-important issue of an independent political party, with a proposal by five delegates of the Farmer-Labor Party calling for "independent political action by the agricultural and industrial workers through a party of their own" defeated by a vote of 52 to 64. A majority report declaring against an independent political party was instead adopted.&lt;ref&gt;DeLeon and Fine, ''The American Labor Year Book, 1923-1924,'' pg. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; This defeat of the bid for an independent political party cost the CPPA one its major component organizations, with the Farmer-Labor Party delegation announcing that their group would no longer affiliate with the CPPA after the close of the convention. Although the Socialists did not realize it at the time, the chances that the organization would ever be transformed into an authentic mass Farmer-Labor party of the British Labour type were greatly lessened with the departure of the FLP.

The Socialists still remained optimistic and the May 1923 National Convention of the Socialist Party voted after lengthy debate to retain its affiliation with the CPPA and to continue its work for an independent political party from within that group. The May 20 vote in favor of maintaining affiliation with the CPPA was 38–12.&lt;ref&gt;"Minutes of the Convention," ''The Socialist World,'' v. 4, no. 6 (June 1923), pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Failing a mass farmer-labor party from the CPPA, the Socialists sought at least a powerful presidential nominee to run in opposition to the old parties. A 3rd National Conference of the CPPA was held in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] on February 11 and 12, 1924, a gathering which punted on the issue of committing itself to the 1924 presidential campaign, deciding instead to "immediately issue a call for a convention of workers, farmers, and progressives for the purpose of taking action on nomination of candidates for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States, and on other questions that may come before the convention".&lt;ref&gt;Solon DeLeon and Nathan Fine (eds.), ''The American Labor Year Book, 1925.'' New York: Rand School Press, 1924; pp. 120-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decisive moment finally came on the 4th of July, 1924, a date which was not accidentally selected. The 1st National Convention of the CPPA was assembled in Cleveland at the city auditorium, which was packed with close to 600 delegates representing international unions, state federations of labor, branches of cooperative societies, state branches and national officers of the Socialist, Farmer-Labor and Progressive Parties as well as the [[Committee of 48]], state and national affiliates of the Women's Committee on Political Action and sundry individuals. Very few farmers were in attendance.

It was around this time that the American Socialists began actively participating in discussions about democratic principles as much as [[Marxism|Marxist]] ones. By 1924 they supported the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924–34)|Progressive Party ticket]] which pushed for the reform of the democratic party. Ten years after this initial occurrence in 1934, the American Socialists adopted a "clearly undemocratic, quasi-Leninist platform"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/828869850|title=The new Progressive Era : toward a fair and deliberative democracy|last=1967-|first=Levine, Peter,|date=2000|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781461732303|oclc=828869850}}&lt;/ref&gt; that lobbied for the removal of the current "bogus democracy of capitalist parliamentarianism"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/25788634|title=The dialogue of justice : toward a self-reflective society|last=S.|first=Fishkin, James|date=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300051123|oclc=25788634}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Wanting the government to be replaced by a "genuine worker's democracy"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, the American Socialist party stated, "whether or not it is a majority, will not shrink from the responsibility of organizing and maintaining a government under the workers' rule"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/245750583|title=Civil society, democracy, and civic renewal|last=K.|first=Fullinwider, Robert|date=1999|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publ|isbn=0847693554|oclc=245750583}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This was seen as an attempt to propose a political reform which would ultimately result in a better social and economic reform consistent with their beliefs. Regardless, it was [[Karl Marx]] who called this entire concept of voting for socialism "democratic nonsense, political windbaggery"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/37363922|title=Holding the center : America's nonprofit sector at a crossroads|last=M.|first=Salamon, Lester|date=1997|publisher=Nathan Cummings Foundation|isbn=1886333270|oclc=37363922}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Lafollette-and-gompers-240919.jpg|thumb|250px|Socialist Party of America ally [[Robert M. La Follette]] (left) attempted to build a broad labor alliance during the 1924 campaign and here meets with [[Samuel Gompers]] of the [[American Federation of Labor]]]]
The National Committee had previously requested that Wisconsin Senator [[Robert M. La Follette]] make a run for the presidency. The Cleveland Convention was addressed by the Senator's son, [[Robert M. La Follette Jr.]], who read a message from his father accepting the call and declaring that the time had come "for a militant political movement independent of the two old party organizations". However, La Follette declined to lead a third party, seeking to protect those progressives elected nominally as Republicans and Democrats. La Follette declared that the primary issue of the 1924 campaign was the breaking of the "combined power of the private monopoly system over the political and economic life of the American people". After the November election a new party might well be established, La Follette stated, that might unite all progressives.&lt;ref&gt;DeLeon and Fine (eds.), ''The American Labor Year Book, 1925,'' pp. 122-126.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Socialist Party enthusiastically supported the independent candidacy of La Follette, declining to run their own candidate in November 1924. Although the La Follette candidacy garnered five million votes, it failed to seriously challenge the [[hegemony]] of the old parties and was regarded by the unions as a disappointing failure.

Following the election, the governing National Committee of the CPPA met in Washington, D.C. While the body had a mandate from the July convention to issue a call for a convention to organize a new political party, the representatives of the critical railway unions, with the exception of William H. Johnston of the Machinists, were united in opposition to idea. The railroad unions instead proposed a motion not to hold the 1925 organizational convention. This proposal was defeated by a vote of 30 to 13. Following their defeat on this question, the railroaders on National Committee members withdrew from the meeting, announcing that they would await further instructions from their respective organizations with regards to future participation.&lt;ref name="ALYB131"&gt;DeLeon and Fine (eds.), ''The American Labor Year Book, 1925,'' pg. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the very unions who had brought about the CPPA spelled its demise.

A convention to decide on the formation of a new political party was nonetheless scheduled by the National Committee for February 21, 1925 to be held in Chicago. ''Labor,'' the official organ of the railway unions, did nothing to promote this 2nd Convention of the CPPA, stating that since the executives of the various unions had taken no stance on the matter, it would be up to subordinate sections to consider sending delegates themselves.&lt;ref name="ALYB131"/&gt;

However, the February 1925 convention found its task was virtually insurmountable as the heterogeneous organization had split over the fundamental question of realignment of the major parties via the [[primary elections]] process as opposed to establishment of a new competitive political party. The railway unions, whose efforts who had originally brought the CPPA into existence, were fairly solidly united against the Third Party tactic, instead favoring continuation of the CPPA as a sort of pressure group for progressive change within the structure of the Democratic and Republican parties.

L. E. Sheppard, president of the [[Order of Railway Conductors of America]], presented a resolution calling for a continuation of the CPPA on non-partisan lines as a political pressure group. This proposal was met by an amendment by Morris Hillquit of the Socialist Party, who called the five million votes cast for La Follette an ecouraging beginning and urged action for establishment of an American Labor Party on the British model—in which constituent groups retained their organizational autonomy within the larger umbrella organization. A third proposal was made by J.A.H. Hopkins of the Committee of Forty-Eight, which called for establishment of a Progressive Party built around individual enrollments. No vote was ever taken by the convention on any of the three proposals mooted. Instead, after some debate the convention was unanimously adjourned sine die—bringing an abrupt end to the Conference for Progressive Political Action.

Eugene V. Debs addressed a "mass meeting" including delegates of the convention in a keynote address delivered at the Lexington Hotel early in the afternoon of February 21. After the Debs speech, those delegates favoring establishment of a new political party were then reconvened, with the opponents of an independent political party departing. The reconvened Founding Convention found itself split between adherents of a non-class Progressive Party based upon individual memberships as opposed to the Socialists' conception of a class-conscious Labor Party employing "direct affiliation" of "organizations of workers and farmers and of progressive political and educational groups who fully accept its program and principles". Following extensive debate, the Socialist counter-proposal was defeated by a vote of 93 to 64.&lt;ref&gt;Solon DeLeon and Nathan Fine (eds.), The American Labor Year Book, 1926. New York: Rand School of Social Science, 1925; pp. 230-232.&lt;/ref&gt; The trade unions it coveted gone, the farmers non-existent, the Socialist Party exited the convention and abandoned the strategy of establishing a new mass party through the CPPA. A "Progressive Party" was formed by the remaining liberals and the group survived for a short time in a limited number of states throughout the 1920s.

=== Left turn and split of the Old Guard (1928–1936) ===
[[File:Senior-Clarence-1936.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Clarence Senior]], Socialist Party of America Executive Secretary from August 1929 to late 1936.]]
In 1928, the Socialist Party returned as an independent electoral entity under the leadership of [[Norman Thomas]], a radical Protestant minister from New York City. This reentry into the electoral fray behind the dynamic Thomas fueled major growth of the party during the first years of [[Great Depression]], primarily among youth. A skilled orator and advocate of the step by step solution of social problems, Thomas had excellent access to churches, colleges and civic institutions. Thomas also had, as New York social democrat Louis Waldman later noted that "those qualities of mind and character which appealed to the intelligent and educated young people of the country and which drew them into the ranks of the party in unprecedented numbers".&lt;ref&gt;Louis Waldman, ''Labor Lawyer.'' New York: E.P. Dutton &amp; Co., 1944; p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1928 convention voted to reduce membership dues to just $1 per year, with only half of that sum going to the use of the National Office, the balance being retained by state and local organizations. This level of funding proved insufficient for anything beyond the bare minimum of operations by the National Office in Chicago—no official party publication was made available to the members of the organization, with several privately held socialist newspapers fulfilling the function as fonts of party information.

The dues rate cut did prove helpful in reducing the party's membership slide. After nearly a decade of steady decline, the Socialist Party again began to grow, advancing from a low of under 8,000 dues payers in 1928 to a membership of almost 17,000 by 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Frank A. Warren, ''An Alternative Vision: The Socialist Party in the 1930s.'' Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1974; p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this growth came at a price as deep factional divisions developed between the youthful newcomers (radicalized and drawn to militant Marxism by the world economic crisis) and the "Old Guard" headed by Morris Hillquit, James Oneal and Waldman.

The generational battle first erupted at the May 1932 Milwaukee Convention. Participant Anna Bercowitz noted four primary factions at this gathering: an "Old Guard" defending the current course of the party and the position of National Chairman Morris Hillquit, practical Socialists of the Milwaukee type, the young Marxist "[[Militant faction|Militants]]" and liberal pacifist "Thomasites" such as [[Devere Allen]] who followed the lead of the charismatic Thomas.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The groups which represented the so-called 'New Blood' at the convention, the Militants and the Liberals and which at this convention merged for the sole purpose of deposing the present leadership [of the party] had little in common. Many members of the most aggressive, although numerically weakest of these groups, the Militants, had little in common with the so-called Thomasites.... And as for the so-called Mid-western group, although they cast their vote with the opposition, on fundamentals they too are opposed to much of the liberalizing tendencies manifest in the party in recent years. Yet they voted, contrary to their usual procedure in their respective communities, with the opposition. That trades had been made there can be no doubt, and that some groups had been used as innocent dupes can also hardly be doubted...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Fundamentally there is much more in common between the Militants and the so-called 'Old Guard' than between the Militants and the [religious pacifist] Thomasites and surely than between the frank practical 'mid-western' type of Socialists, yet when it was a question of vote on the Russian resolution, on the TU [Trade Union] resolution and on the question of the National Chairman and the Executive Committee votes were not cast on the basis of principles but apparently on the basis of 'trades'. The real difference between the Militants and the 'Old Guard' seems to be based on lack of sufficient activity and on tempo rather than on principle.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Bercowitz, "The Milwaukee Convention," ''The American Socialist Quarterly,'' v. 1, no. 3 (Summer 1932), pp. 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hillquit was challenged at the 1932 convention by [[Daniel Hoan]] of Milwaukee, with the Militants and the Thomas group voting for Hoan with the Midwesterners. Hillquit was reelected National Chairman by a vote of 105–86, representing paid memberships of 7526 to 6984. Six members of the newly elected NEC were adherents of the Hillquit-Old Guard faction.&lt;ref&gt;Bercowitz, "The Milwaukee Convention," p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that to some large extent the controversy between the young newcomers of the Militant faction and that of the so-called Old Guard can be reduced to this struggle for practical control of the party apparatus. Historian Frank Warren notes that "one cannot understand the Old Guard's actions unless one recognizes its intense desire to maintain its place in the party hierarchy; the drives of the young were a threat to the power of the New York Old Guard." He also adds that "clearly one would falsely idealize the Militants if one failed to recognize that their ambitions were not always selfless".&lt;ref&gt;Warren, ''An Alternative Vision,'' pg. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the raw struggle for control of the party apparatus, there was also a divergence of visions about the role of the Socialist Party in the then-current crisis of capitalism, with mass unemployment at home and the growth of [[fascism]] and [[militarism]] abroad. The alternative vision of the Militants would be expressed at the subsequent convention of the party held in Detroit in June 1934, at which it was Norman Thomas and his tactical allies of the Militant faction which would emerge triumphant. It was this gathering which adopted a new [[1934 Declaration of Principles|Declaration of Principles]] which inflamed the "Old Guard" faction on a number of different levels.

[[File:Waldman-louis-1944.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Louis Waldman]], a top leader of the [[Old Guard faction|Old Guard]]]]
The ideological differences between the radical pacifist Thomas and his allies of the Militant faction on the one hand and the Old Guard faction on the other have been succinctly summarized as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Old Guard was convinced that the 1934 Declaration of Principles was an open declaration in favor of armed insurrection; Thomas believed it was a necessary statement to indicate that Socialists would not lie down in the face of fascism. The Old Guard believed that the anti-war sections of the Declaration of Principles placed the party under the threat of legal prosecution for advocating unlawful actions to oppose war; again Thomas believed that a strong statement was necessary to put capitalism on warning that if it engaged in imperialist war there would be opposition. The Old Guard believed that a [[united front]] with the Communists was immoral and would be disastrous for the Socialists, that even limited united action on specific causes should be banned, and even that exploratory discussions about a united front were going too far. Thomas opposed a united front on a general level, including any joint actions in political contests, but he thought that carefully planned united action on specific cases could, and should, take place. And he believed that it was worth while to conduct exploratory talks, even though he felt they would likely lead to nothing. The Old Guard felt that the Socialists' invitation to unaffiliated radicals and the Party's acceptance of former Communists, [[Lovestoneites]], and [[Trotskyists]] was turning the party away from democratic socialism and to Communism. Thomas, though he disagreed with the ideology of these anti-Stalinist Communists, was willing to try to work with a party that included them, if they were willing to accept party discipline and not try to take over the Party. The Old Guard considered the [[Revolutionary Policy Committee]], a far-left group within the Socialist Party, a Communist and [[anarchist]] group that had no place in a democratic socialist party. Thomas disagreed with the 'romantic revolutionists' in the Revolutionary Policy Committee (as he disagreed with the 'romantic parliamentarians' of the Old Guard), but still felt it was useful to try to salvage some of the enthusiasm and dedication that went into the Revolutionary Policy Committee by permitting its members to remain in the Party if, again, they followed party policy and party discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, ''An Alternative Vision,'' pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to the generational and ideological differences between the young Militant faction and the Old Guard and their divergence over tempo of activity and party personnel was great disagreement about matters of symbolism and style. Many of the young radicals dressed and acted in marked contrast to their staid, buttoned-down elders as New York Old Guard leader Louis Waldman recounted in a 1944 memoir:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Symptoms of a new and dangerous spirit among the Socialist youth began to become manifest on all sides. The youngsters appeared at meetings of the party in blue shirts and red ties. At first this attracted no special attention, for oddity in dress is no novelty among radicals. But gradually their number increased and we now could see that this was a uniform. The Socialist youth of America, like the fascist youth in Europe, had succumbed to the shirt mania.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The shirt tendency was followed by the salute mania. In Europe, the Nazi salute was the outstretched arm; here in America the United Front was symbolized by the adoption of the Communist clenched fist salute. This greeting, a raised arm at a slightly different angle from the Nazi or Communist salute, now became routine at all our meetings. [...] Some of the older members of the party were truly horrified at this totalitarian tendency, but others couldn't resist the trend and fell into line. Among these, I painfully record, was Norman Thomas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along with the blue shirts, the red ties, the clenched fists, the raised arm salute, came the banners, the slogans, the demonstrations; all the trappings that make for totalitarian, unthinking mass fervor. These now became regular features at party gatherings. I can still recall the howl of triumph that rose from these young people at one of our meetings when for the first time Norman Thomas returned the clenched fist salute to them. As I stood at his side, my arms deliberately folded to indicate that I would have no part of this, their cheers for Thomas rose to almost uncontrollable frenzy.&lt;ref&gt;Waldman, ''Labor Lawyer,'' pp. 194-195.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following its loss on the floor of the Detroit Convention, the Old Guard then took its case to the rank and file of the party, which had been called upon to either approve or defeat the new Declaration of Principles in referendum vote. A Committee for the Preservation of the Socialist Party was established and an agitational pamphlet published. New York State Assemblyman Charles Solomon was the author of the group's first polemical piece urging defeat of the 1934 Declaration of Principles by the membership at referendum, entitled ''Detroit and the Party.'' In this pamphlet, Solomon decried the Detroit Declaration of Principles as "reckless", observing pointedly that "furious phrases cannot take the place of organized mass power".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Solomon, ''Detroit and the Party.'' New York: Committee for the Preservation of Socialist Policies, n.d. [1934]; pg. 3. It is worthy of note that the Committee for the Preservation of Socialist Policies was an organized faction to the extent of maintaining an office at 1 Union Square in New York City, complete with a provisional Executive Secretary and National Executive Committee.&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon noted that over "the past three or four years" there had arisen "certain definite groups" in the ranks of the Socialist Party. He continued by saying the following:

[[File:Kantorovich-haim.jpg|frame|[[Haim Kantorovitch]], chief theoretician of the [[Militant faction]]]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Declaration does not stand by itself, in a vacuum, as it were. Important as it is, it does not alone account for the vital struggle that is now being waged in the party. It represents the culminating point of a deep seated antagonism. It is like the straw that breaks or threatens to break the camel's back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Declaration of Principles has brought to the surface divergences which are deep, antagonisms which make of our party not a coherent political organization working harmoniously for a common objective but a battle ground of internecine strife.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, ''Detroit and the Party,'' pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Solomon charged that the "so-called 'left'" was "making its position clear" with the Declaration of Principles. "There was no mistaking the flag it had unfurled", he declared, "[i]t was the banner of thinly veiled communism".&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, ''Detroit and the Party,'' pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; While he declared that "the Declaration of Principles must be decisively rejected in the referendum", he nevertheless strongly hinted that a factional split was in the offing. Merely defeating the proposed Declaration of Principles was "not enough", he concluded that the "Socialist Party must be made safe for Socialism, for social democracy".&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, ''Detroit and the Party,'' pg. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

''American Socialist Quarterly'' editor [[Haim Kantorovitch]] made the case for the Militant faction in a pamphlet urging approval of the Declaration of Principles at referendum:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The declaration of principles does not call for insurrection or violence. It simply states that if capitalism should collapse, the Socialist Party will not shrink from the responsibility of taking power. In case of a collapse of capitalism, if the socialists refuse to take power, the fascists will. To say beforehand that in time of a general collapse of capitalism...the socialists will not dare take power before they have a clear mandate from the majority through a democratic vote, is the same as saying that in case of a general collapse of capitalism the Socialist Party will voluntarily, in the name of democracy, turn over the power to the fascists or other reactionary elements, and continue their democratic propaganda from concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;Haim Kantorovich, The Socialist Party at the Crossroads: Notes on the Declaration of Principles Adopted at the National Convention Socialist Party, Detroit, June 3, 1934. New York: Max Delson, July 1934; p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The membership of the Socialist Party approved the 1934 Declaration of Principles in its referendum vote, a victory which moved the Old Guard towards the exits—although factional fighting into 1936. The leaders of the Old Guard formed a new rival organization to the Socialist Party, the [[Social Democratic Federation (US)|Social Democratic Federation]] in 1936 and somewhat reluctantly endorsed [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for President in the election of that year. They also worked to establish the [[American Labor Party]] (ALP), a labor-oriented umbrella organization that included both socialist and non-socialist elements, putting forward both its own candidates as well as endorsing those of the [[Democratic Party (U.S.)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican]] parties.

=== End Poverty in California movement (1934) ===
[[Upton Sinclair]], a prominent novelist, had long been associated with the Socialist Party in California. He was twice its candidate for Congress and its nominee for governor in 1930, but won fewer than 50,000 votes. In 1934, Sinclair ran in the Democratic primary for governor and astonished everyone by a sweeping victory in the primary on his promise of radical socialist economic reforms he dubbed "[[End Poverty in California movement]]" (EPIC). Conservative and Republican elements rallied against Sinclair and managed to defeat him in the general election. The Socialist Party in California and nationwide refused to allow its members to be active in any other party including the Democratic Party and expelled him, along with socialists who supported his California campaign. Sinclair won 879,537 votes, doubling his primary total, but that represented only 38 percent of the record breaking turnout as Republican Frank Merriam won with 49 percent of the vote while Raymond Haight, running under the Progressive Party banner, collected 13 percent. State Socialist Party chair Milen Dempster mounted a feeble effort to hold back the tidal wave of radical enthusiasm for Sinclair, gaining less than 3,000 votes. The expulsions destroyed the Socialist Party in California. More important, Sinclair's campaign encouraged many radicals in other states to turn away from the Socialist Party. Membership, which had climbed back above 19,000 in 1934, would soon decline to less than 6,000 in 1937 and barely 2,000 in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Leader, "Upton Sinclair's EPIC Switch: A Dilemma for American Socialists."

=== Demise of the all-inclusive party (1937–1940) ===
[[File:Norman Thomas 1937.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Norman Thomas]], six-time presidential candidate of the Socialist Party of America]]
Norman Thomas and his radical pacifist co-thinkers and their young Marxist allies of the Militant faction sought to build a mass political movement by transforming the Socialist Party into what they called an "all-inclusive party". Not only would an appeal be made to the radical intellectuals and trade unionists who were the historic core of the organization, but an effort would be made to work closely with the Communist Party in joint actions and to infuse the Socialist Party with the leading personnel of small radical oppositional organizations, including in particular the anti-Stalinist communist groupings headed by [[Jay Lovestone]] (the so-called "Lovestoneites") and [[James P. Cannon]] (the so-called "Trotskyists"). To be sure, an impressive array of left-wing intellectuals came into the Socialist orbit as a result of this venture, including (from the Lovestoneites) [[Bertram D. Wolfe]],&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe co-authored a book with Norman Thomas in 1938, ''Keep America Out of War.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Zam]] and [[Benjamin Gitlow]] as well as (from the Trotskyists) [[Max Shachtman]], [[James Burnham]], [[Martin Abern]] and [[Hal Draper]]. A broad array of radicals from other tendencies also contributed to the pages of the party's official theoretical journal, including from the Communist Party orbit [[Joseph P. Lash]] of the [[American Student Union]], the radical novelist [[James T. Farrell]], public intellectual [[Sidney Hook]], leading American Marxist of the 1910s [[Louis B. Boudin]] and Canadian Trotskyist [[Maurice Spector]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;The SP's theoretical magazine was known variously as the ''American Socialist Quarterly'' (1932–1935), ''American Socialist Monthly'' (1935–1937), and ''Socialist Review'' (1937–1940). For a short commentary on the publication, see David Herreshoff's article in the section "Publications of the Socialists" in Joseph R. Conlin (ed.), ''The American Radical Press, 1880-1960.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1974; v. 1, pp. 198-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

A very real bid was made to unite the factionalized and marginalized [[American Left]] in a common cause—and great hope was held for success in the enterprise. After the rise of the Nazis in Germany and Austria by 1934, no longer did the Communist Party engage in its [[Third Period]] epithets against the Socialists as so-called "[[social fascism|social fascists]]". [[Lillian Symes]] wrote in the Socialist Party's theoretical magazine in February 1937 of the "incredible change" seen to be taking place in the Communist Party in its seeming abandonment of [[sectarianism]] and move towards building a broad "people's front" against fascism. At the same time, other radical organizations sought to alter their tactics so as to rapidly build an aggressive left-wing organization to stand in opposition to nascent fascism. From early 1934, the French Trotskyist organization had entered the French Socialist Party in an effort to build its strength and win support for its ideas. Pressure to follow this policy of the "French Turn" was building among the American Trotskyist group. For a brief historical moment in 1935 and 1936, the vision of the Socialist Party as an "all-inclusive party" which aggregated radical oppositionists and possibly even worked with the Communist Party in common cause seemed achievable.

In January 1936, just as the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party was expelling the Old Guard, a factional battle was being won in the Trotskyist [[Workers Party of the United States]] to join the Socialist Party when a national branch referendum voted unanimously for entry.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, ''The Prophet's Army: Trotskyists in America, 1928-1941.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1977; pg. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations commenced between the Workers Party and Socialist leaderships, with the decision ultimately made to allow admissions only on the basis of individual applications for membership rather than en masse admission of the entire group.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, ''The Prophet's Army,'' pp. 113-114.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 1936, the Workers Party's weekly newspaper, ''The New Militant,'' published its last issue and announced "Workers Party Calls All Revolutionary Workers to Join Socialist Party".&lt;ref&gt;Myers, ''The Prophet's Army,'' pg. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately half of the Workers Party heeded the call and entered the Socialist Party.&lt;ref&gt;Myers cites "about 2,000" members for the Workers Party of the US in 1935 (pg. 114) and indicates they entered with "about 1,000" (p. 140) and exited in 1937 with "1,000 added to their number" (pg. 140). Myers, ''The Prophet's Army.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although party leader Jim Cannon later hinted that the entry of the Trotskyists into the Socialist Party had been a contrived tactic aimed at stealing "confused young Left Socialists" for his own organization,&lt;ref&gt;"If we had stood aside, the Stalinists would have gobbled up the Socialist Left Wing and it would have been used as another club against us, as in Spain," he later recalled. James P. Cannon, ''The History of American Trotskyism.'' New York: Pioneer Press, 1944; pp. 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt; it seems that at its inception, the entryist tactic was made in good faith. Historian Constance Myers notes that while "initial prognoses for the union of Trotskyists and Socialists were favorable", it was only later when "constant and protracted contact caused differences to surface".&lt;ref&gt;Myers, ''The Prophet's Army,'' p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The Trotskyists retained a common orientation with the radicalized Socialist Party in their opposition to the European war, their preference for [[industrial unionism]] and the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] over the trade unionism of the [[American Federation of Labor]], a commitment to trade union activism, the defense of the Soviet Union as the first workers' state while at the same time maintaining an antipathy toward the Stalin regime and in their general aims in the 1936 election.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, ''The Prophet's Army,'' p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Norman Thomas attracted nearly 188,000 votes in his 1936 Socialist Party run for President, but he performed poorly in historic strongholds of the party. Moreover, the party's membership had begun to decline.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, ''The Prophet's Army,'' pp. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was deeply factionalized, with the Militant faction split into right ("Altmanite"), center ("Clarity") and left ("Appeal") factions, in addition to the radical pacifists led by Norman Thomas and the midwestern "constructive" socialists led by Dan Hoan. A special convention was planned for the last week of March 1937 to set the party's future policy, initially intended as an unprecedented "secret" gathering.&lt;ref name="Myers127"&gt;Myers, ''The Prophet's Army,'' p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Split with the Trotskyists ===
Prior to the March convention, the Trotskyist "[[Socialist Appeal (US, 1935)|Socialist Appeal" faction]] held an organizational gathering of their own, meeting in Chicago, with 93 delegates gathering from February 20–22, 1937.&lt;ref name="Myers127"/&gt; The meeting organized the faction on a permanent basis, electing a National Action Committee of five to "coordinate branch work" and "formulate Appeal policies".&lt;ref&gt;The committee included [[Vincent R. Dunne|Vincent Dunne]], [[Albert Goldman (politician)|Albert Goldman]], [[Max Shachtman]], and Richard Babb Whitten. Myers, The Prophet's Army, pp. 128-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Two delegates from the Clarity caucus were in attendance. James Burnham vigorously attacked the [[Labour and Socialist International]], the international organization of left-wing parties to which the Socialist Party belonged and tension rose along these lines among the Trotskyists. United action between the Clarity and Appeal groups was not forthcoming and an emergency meeting of [[Vincent R. Dunne|Vincent Dunne]] and Cannon was held in New York with leaders of the various factions including Thomas, [[Jack Altman]] and [[Gus Tyler]] of Clarity. At this meeting Thomas pledged that the upcoming convention would make no effort to terminate the newspapers of the various factions.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, ''The Prophet's Army,'' p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

No action was taken at the 1937 convention to expel the Trotskyist "Appeal faction", but pressure did continue to build along these lines, fueled by the Communist Party's increasingly hysterical denunciations of Trotsky and his followers as wreckers and agents of international fascism. The convention did pass a ban on future branch resolutions on controversial matters, an effort to rein in the activities of the factions at the local level. It also did ban factional newspapers, a move directly targeting ''The Socialist Appeal''; and formally established ''The Socialist Call'' as the party's national organ.

Constance Myers indicates that three factors led to the expulsion of the Trotskyists from the Socialist Party in 1937: the divergence between the official Socialists and the Trotskyist faction on the issues, the determination of Altman's wing of the Militants to oust the Trotskyists and Trotsky's own decision to move towards a break with the party.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, ''The Prophet's Army,'' pg. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing that the Clarity faction had chosen to stand with the Altmanites and the Thomas group, Trotsky recommended that the Appeal group focus on disagreements over Spain to provoke a split. At the same time, Thomas, freshly returned from Spain, had come to the conclusion that the Trotskyists had joined the Socialist Party not to make it stronger, but to capture the organization for their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, ''The Prophet's Army,'' pg. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 24–25, 1937, a meeting of the Appeal faction's National Action Committee voted to ratcheted up the rhetoric against [[American Labor Party]] and [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican]] nominee for mayor of New York [[Fiorello LaGuardia]], a favorite son of many in Socialist ranks; and to reestablish their newspaper, ''The Socialist Appeal.''&lt;ref name="Myers139"&gt;Myers, ''The Prophet's Army,'' pg. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; This was met with expulsions from the party beginning August 9 with a rump meeting of the Central Committee of Local New York, which expelled 52 New York Trotskyists by a vote of 48 to 2, with 18 abstentions; and ordering 70 more to be brought up on charges.&lt;ref name="Myers139" /&gt; Wholesale expulsions followed, with a major section of the [[Young People's Socialist League (1907)|Young People's Socialist League]] leaving the party with the Trotskyists.

Secretary of Local New York Jack Altman declared that the Trotskyists "were expelled for attempting to undermine the Socialist Party, for loyalty and allegiance to an opponent organization, the Bureau of the Fourth International, and for refusing to abide by the decisions and discipline of the National convention, the National Executive Committee, and the City Central Committee of the party, and for no other reason".&lt;ref&gt;New York Socialists Expel Trotsky Heads, ''The Socialist Call,'' vol. 3, whole no. 127 (August 21, 1937), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Editor Gus Tyler of ''The Socialist Call'' echoed Altman's sentiments, emphasizing that "the Trotskyites have, during the last week, [...] abandoned the usual means of inner party controversy—debate and appeals through party channels—and, like the Old Guard, have carried their argument into the public, into the capitalist press".&lt;ref name="Gus"&gt;[Gus Tyler], "The Trotskyites," 'The Socialist Call,'' vol. 3, whole no. 127 (August 21, 1937), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The issuance of a statement by the Trotskyist faction to ''The New York Times'' and the relaunch of their own newspaper, ''The Socialist Appeal,'' was seen as particularly galling by the ''Call''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s editor.''&lt;ref name="Gus" /&gt;''

=== Collapse of the united front ===
[[File:Spa-rebelsongbook-1935.jpg|frame|The youth and militance of the [[Great Depression]]-era is reflected in the cover of this 1935 song book published by the Socialist Party of America-affiliated Rand School Press]]
Things turned out no better with the official Communist Party, devoted as it was to the Stalin regime in the Soviet Union. The February–March 1937 joint plenum of the Central Committee and Central Control Commission of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|All-Union Communist Party]] in the Moscow, which green-lighted a massive avalanche of secret police terror known to history as the [[Great Purge]], changed everything. Baby steps towards multi-candidate elections and the rule of law in the Soviet Union crumbled instantly as [[show trials]], spy mania, mass arrests and mass executions swept the land. The Trotskyist movement in the Soviet Union was particularly targeted, accused of plotting murder of Soviet officials and conducting sabotage and espionage in preparation for a fascist invasion&amp;mdash;seemingly insane charges which were honestly believed by the Soviet elite. Blood flowed like water as alleged Trotskyists and other politically suspect individuals were rounded up, "investigated" and disposed with a pistol shot in the base of the skull or a 10-year sentence in the [[Gulag]]. Around the world, the adherents of Stalin and Trotsky raged against one another.

In Spain, the country in which the Lovestoneites invested most of their emotional energy as fervid supporters of the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification ([[POUM]]), 1937 marked a similar bloodbath, with the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] achieving hegemony among the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] forces and conducting bloody purges of their own at the behest of the Soviet secret police. Joint action between Communist oppositionists and the unflinching loyalists to Moscow was henceforth an abject impossibility.

In 1937, Norman Thomas willingly acceded to a request from the [[League for Industrial Democracy]] (LID) to author a pamphlet on the topic of "Democracy versus Dictatorship".&lt;ref&gt;Norman Thomas, ''Democracy versus Dictatorship.'' New York: League for Industrial Democracy, 1937. Thomas wrote in the introduction that "At the request of the LID I have written this pamphlet on one of the great either or's of our time. i do not want it to be though that I think it is the one, all inclusive issue, or even the most vital of the issues before us. That, I think, for reasons which I urged over and over in the last [1936] Presidential campaign, is the issue of socialism versus capitalism. It is not 'democracy versus fascism.' There is not now any such emergency in America as should force socialists into a popular front as a defense for our present imperfect democracy." (pg. 3).&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas pulled no punches about his views of the regime in the Soviet Union:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are still in both the eastern and western hemispheres many examples of rather crude and primitive military dictatorships. [...] The preach a nationalism whose benefits, spiritual or material, to some degree are for all the people. They profess a positive and paternal concern for the masses. If they rule them sternly that is for their own good. [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the USSR the dictatorship has been the dictatorship of the Communist Party, but all of its professions and all of its performance has been in the name of the entire working class, and the Communist Party still gives lip-service to a final withering away of all dictatorship, even the dictatorship of the proletariat.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''Democracy versus Dictatorship,'' pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thomas further noted the Communist Party monopoly of press, radio, schools, army and government and recalled his own recent visit to Moscow, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The old keenness of political discussion in the party has almost died, at least in so far as policy is concerned. (Criticism of administration is still allowed). A quotation from Stalin is a final answer to all argument. He receives the same sort of exaggerated veneration in public appearances, in the display of his picture, and in written references to him that is accorded to a Mussolini or a Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''Democracy versus Dictatorship,'' pg. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Any thought of common-cause with the Communists was now dismissed by Thomas, who indicated that the Communists' fairly recent change of line from fighting the existing trade unions and damning of all political opponents as "social fascists" to attempting to build a "popular front" was merely tactical, related to the perceived needs of Soviet foreign policy in building coalitions with capitalist countries to forestall fascist invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''Democracy versus Dictatorship,'' pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The factional havoc of the move to the "all-inclusive party" paralyzed activity while the Old Guard's new group, the Social Democratic Federation of America, controlled the bulk of the Socialist Party's former property and the allegiance of those best able to fund the organization. The expulsions of the Trotskyists and disintegration of the party's youth section left the organization greatly weakened and gasping for life, its membership level at a new low.

=== 1940–1955 ===
[[File:A.-Phillip-Randolph.png|thumb|Labor union and civil rights leader [[A.&amp;nbsp;Philip Randolph]] in 1942]]
By 1940, only a small committed core remained in the Socialist Party, including a considerable percentage of militant pacifists. The Socialist Party continued to oppose [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] as a capitalist palliative, arguing for fundamental change through socialist ownership. In 1940, Norman Thomas was the only presidential candidate who failed to support rearmament military support of Great Britain and China. The pacifist Thomas also served as an active spokesman for the isolationist [[America First Committee]] during 1941.

After the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in the fall of 1941 and the declaration of war, the United States defense of itself and war against fascism was supported by most of the remaining Militants and all of the Old Guard. However, the Socialist Party adopted a compromise position that did not openly oppose American participation in the war. Its failure to support the war created a rift with many leaders, like the [[Walter Reuther|Reuther Brothers]] of the [[United Auto Workers]]. The pacifist wing of the party did not advocate engaging in any systematic antiwar activities such as the general strike endorsed by the 1934 Declaration of Principles.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, ''An Alternative Vision,'' pp. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialist [[A. Philip Randolph]] emerged as one of the most visible spokesmen for African American civil rights. In 1941, Randolph, [[Bayard Rustin]] and [[A. J. Muste]] proposed [[March on Washington Movement|a march on Washington]] to protest racial discrimination in war industries and to propose the desegregation of the American armed forces.&amp;nbsp;The march was cancelled after President Roosevelt issued [[Executive Order 8802]], or the [[Fair Employment Act]].&amp;nbsp;Roosevelt's order applied to banning discrimination within only the war industries, but not within the armed forces. However, the [[Fair Employment Act]] is generally perceived as a success for African American labor rights.

In 1942, an estimated 18,000 blacks gathered at [[Madison Square Garden]] to hear Randolph kick off a campaign against discrimination in the military, in war industries, in government agencies and in labor unions.&amp;nbsp;Following the act, during the [[Philadelphia Transit Strike]] of 1944 the government backed African American workers' striking to gain positions formerly limited to white employees.

In 1947, Randolph, along with colleague [[Grant Reynolds (civil rights leader)|Grant Reynolds]], renewed efforts to end discrimination in the armed services, forming the Committee Against [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] in Military Service, later renamed the League for Non-Violent [[Civil disobedience|Civil Disobedience]].&amp;nbsp;On July 26, 1948, President [[Harry S. Truman]] abolished [[racial segregation]] in the armed forces through [[Executive Order 9981]].&lt;ref name="dol"&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Labor Hall of Fame Honoree (1989): A.

The party retained some pockets of local success in cities such as [[Milwaukee]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]] and [[Reading, Pennsylvania]]. In New York City, they often ran their own candidates on the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]] line.

=== Reunification (1956) ===
Reunification with the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) was long a goal of Norman Thomas and his associates remaining in the Socialist Party. As early as 1938, Thomas had acknowledged that a number of issues had been involved in the split which led to the formation of the rival Social Democratic Federation, including "organizational policy, the effort to make the party inclusive of all socialist elements not bound by communist discipline; a feeling of dissatisfaction with social democratic tactics which had failed in Germany" as well as "the socialist estimate of Russia; and the possibility of cooperation with communists on certain specific matters". Still, he held that "those of us who believe that an inclusive socialist party is desirable, and ought to be possible, hope that the growing friendliness of socialist groups will bring about not only joint action but ultimately a satisfactory reunion on the basis of sufficient agreement for harmonious support of a socialist program".&lt;ref&gt;Norman Thomas, ''Socialism on the Defensive.'' New York: Harper and Brothers, 1938; pp. 287-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Socialist Party and the SDF merged to form the Socialist Party-Social Democratic Federation (SP-SDF) in 1957. A small group of holdouts refused to reunify, establishing a new organization called the [[Democratic Socialist Federation]]. When the Soviet Union led an invasion of Hungary in 1956, half of the members of Communist Parties around the world quit—in the United States alone half did and many joined the Socialist Party.

=== Max Shachtman, civil rights movement and the War on Poverty ===
In 1958, the party admitted to its ranks the members of the recently dissolved [[Workers Party (US)|Independent Socialist League]], which had been led by [[Max Shachtman]]. Shachtman had developed a Marxist critique of Soviet Communism as "bureaucratic collectivism", a new form of class society that was more oppressive than any form of capitalism. Shachtman's theory was similar to that of many dissidents and refugees from communism, such as the theory of the "[[new class]]" proposed by Yugoslavian dissident [[Milovan Đilas]] (Djilas).&lt;ref name="Chenoweth"&gt;Page 6: {{cite journal|title=The gallant warrior: In memoriam Tom Kahn|first=Eric|last=Chenoweth|journal=Uncaptive Minds: A journal of information and opinion on Eastern Europe |publisher=Institute for Democracy in Eastern Europe (IDEE)|location=1718 M Street, NW, No. 147, Washington DC 20036, USA|issn=0897-9669|volume=5|issue=20, number 2|date=Summer 1992|pages=5–16|url=http://www.democracyforcuba.org/images/stories/media/UM2/vol.5no.2a.pdf|ref=harv|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019124831/http://www.democracyforcuba.org/images/stories/media/UM2/vol.5no.2a.pdf|archivedate=October 19, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shachtman was an extraordinary public speaker and formidable in debate and his intelligent analysis attracted young socialists like [[Irving Howe]] and [[Michael Harrington]]. Shachtman's denunciations of the Soviet 1956 invasion of Hungary attracted younger activists like [[Tom Kahn]] and Rachelle Horowitz.

Shachtman's youthful followers were able to bring new vigor into the party and Shachtman encouraged them to take positions of responsibility and leadership. As a young leader, Harrington sent Kahn and Horowitz to help [[Bayard Rustin]] with the [[African-American civil rights movement (1954–1968)|African American civil rights movement]]. Rustin had helped to spread [[pacificism]] and [[non-violence]] to leaders of the civil rights movement like [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King Jr]]. while Kahn and Horowitz quickly became close assistants of Rustin. The civil rights movement benefited from intelligence and analysis of Shachtman and increasingly of Kahn. Rustin and his young aides, dubbed "The Bayard Rustin Marching and Chowder Society" by Harrington, organized many protest activities. The young socialists helped Rustin and [[A. Philip Randolph]] organize the [[1963 March on Washington]], where King delivered his "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech.

Harrington soon became the most visible socialist in the United States when his ''[[The Other America]]'' became a best seller, following a long and laudatory ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' review by [[Dwight Macdonald]]. Harrington and other socialists were called to Washington, D.C. to assist the [[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] and then the [[Lyndon B. Johnson#Presidency 1963–1969|Johnson administration]]'s [[War on Poverty]] and [[Great Society]].

The young socialists' role in the civil rights movement made the Socialist Party more attractive. Harrington, Kahn and Horowitz were officers and staff-persons of the [[League for Industrial Democracy]] (LID), which helped to start the [[New Left]] [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS). The three LID officers clashed with the less experienced activists of SDS, like [[Tom Hayden]], when the latter's [[Port Huron Statement]] criticized socialist and liberal opposition to communism and criticized the labor movement while promoting students as agents of social change.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick Sale, ''SDS'', pp. 22-25.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Gitlin, I think, notes that such public strong criticisms did not help and might have hindered their efforts at realignment. --&gt;LID and SDS split in 1965, when SDS voted to remove from its constitution the "exclusion clause" that prohibited membership by communists.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick Sale, ''SDS'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The SDS exclusion clause had barred "advocates of or apologists for" "totalitarianism".&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick Sale, ''SDS'', pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; The clause's removal effectively invited "disciplined cadre" to attempt to "take over or paralyze" SDS as had occurred to mass organizations in the thirties.&lt;ref&gt;Gitlin, p. 191.&lt;p&gt;[[Todd Gitlin]]. ''[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0553372122#reader_0553372122 The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage''] (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of the civil rights movement and the coalition of labor unions and other progressive forces suggested that the United States was changing and that a mass movement of the democratic left was possible. In terms of electoral politics, Shachtman, Harrington and Kahn argued that it was a waste of effort to run electoral campaigns as Socialist Party candidates against Democratic Party candidates. They instead advocated a political strategy called "realignment" that prioritized strengthening labor unions and other progressive organizations that were already active in the Democratic Party. Contributing to the day-to-day struggles of the civil rights movement and labor unions had gained socialists credibility and influence and had helped to push politicians in the Democratic Party towards social-democratic positions, on civil rights and the War on Poverty.

=== From the Socialist Party to Social Democrats, USA ===
{{main|Social Democrats, USA}}
[[File:BayardRustinAug1963-LibraryOfCongress crop.jpg|thumb|[[Bayard Rustin]], an important member of the Socialist Party of America throughout the decade of the 1960s, was elected a National Co-Chairman late in the decade]]
In its 1972 convention, the Socialist Party had two Co-Chairmen, [[Bayard Rustin]] and [[Charles&amp;nbsp;S. Zimmerman]] (of the [[International Ladies Garment&amp;nbsp;Workers' Union]],&lt;ref name="Sorin149"&gt;Gerald Sorin, ''The Prophetic Minority: American Jewish Immigrant Radicals, 1880-1920.'' Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1985; pg. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; ILGWU); and a First National Vice Chairman, James S. Glaser, who were re-elected by [[acclamation]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; In his opening speech to the convention, Co-Chairman Bayard Rustin called for the group to organize against the "reactionary policies of the Nixon Administration" while he also criticized the "irresponsibility and élitism of the 'New Politics' liberals".&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;

The party changed its name to [[Social Democrats, USA]] (SDUSA) by a vote of 73 to 34.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;
* {{cite news |title=Socialist Party now the Social&amp;nbsp;Democrats,&amp;nbsp;U.S.A.|newspaper=New&amp;nbsp;York Times|date=31 December 1972|page=36|author=Anonymous|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/31/archives/socialist-party-now-the-social-democrats-usa.html|accessdate=February 8, 2010|ref=harv}}

The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported on the 1972 Convention on other days, e.g.
* {{cite news|title=Young Socialists support Meany; Group urges the Democrats to join labor movement|date=31 December 1972|page=36|last=Johnston|first=Laurie|ref=harv|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/31/archives/young-socialist-support-meany-group-urges-the-democrats-to-join.html?sq=Young+socialists&amp;scp=11&amp;st=p|newspaper=New&amp;nbsp;York Times}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Renaming the party as SDUSA was meant to be "realistic". ''[[The New York Times]]'' observed that the Socialist Party had last sponsored a [[Darlington Hoopes|candidate for President]] in [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956]], who received only 2,121 votes and which were cast in only six states. Because the party no longer sponsored candidates in presidential elections, the name "Party" had been "misleading" as "Party" had hindered the recruiting of activists who participated in the Democratic Party, according to the majority report. The name "Socialist" was replaced by "[[social democracy|Social Democrats]]" because many Americans associated the word "[[democratic socialism|socialism]]" with [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communism]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; The party also wished to distinguish itself from two small Marxist parties, the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] and the [[Socialist Labor Party of America|Socialist Labor Party]].&lt;ref name="NYT27"&gt;{{cite news |title=Young Socialists open parley; to weigh 'New&amp;nbsp;Politics' split|newspaper=New York Times|date=27 December 1972|ref=harv|page=25|author=Anonymous|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/27/archives/young-socialists-open-parley-to-weigh-new-politics-split.html?sq=Young+socialists&amp;scp=7&amp;st=p}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Unity Caucus had a [[supermajority]] of votes and its position carried on every issue by a ratio of two to one. The convention elected a national committee of 33 members, with 22 seats for the majority caucus, eight seats for Harrington's "coalition caucus", two for "a Debs caucus" and one for the "independent" [[Samuel&amp;nbsp;H. Friedman]].&lt;ref name="NYT73"&gt;{{cite news |title='Firmness' urged on &lt;!-- CAPITALIZED! --&gt;Communists: Social&amp;nbsp;Democrats reach end of U.S.&amp;nbsp;Convention here|newspaper=New&amp;nbsp;York Times|date=1 January 1973|page=11|author=Anonymous|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50C15F73F551A7493C3A9178AD85F478785F9|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman and the minority caucuses had opposed the name change.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;

The convention voted on and adopted proposals for its program by a two-one vote. On foreign policy, the program called for "firmness toward Communist aggression". However, on the Vietnam War the program opposed "any efforts to bomb Hanoi into submission" and instead it endorsed negotiating a peace agreement, which should protect Communist political cadres in South Vietnam from further military or police reprisals. Harrington's proposal for an immediate withdrawal of American forces was defeated. &lt;!-- A Vice Chairman of the Young People's Socialist League (YPSL), [[Carl Gershman]] introduced the international program that was approved. --&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT73"/&gt; Harrington complained that after its March 1972&lt;!-- Harrington's quote in the NYT must refer to the March 1972 convention, so this is permissible glossing of an objective fact, rather than a violation of WP:OR#Synthesis. --&gt; Convention the Socialist Party had endorsed [[George McGovern]] with a statement loaded with "constructive criticism". Harrington also complained that the party had not mobilized enough support for McGovern. The majority caucus's Arch Puddington replied that the California branch had been especially active in supporting McGovern while the New York branch had instead focused on a congressional race.&lt;ref name="NYT27 "/&gt;

=== Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee and Union for Democratic Socialism ===
{{main|Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee|Union for Democratic Socialism}}
{{see also|Democratic Socialists of America|Socialist Party USA}}
Late in October 1972, before the Socialist Party's December Convention, Harrington resigned as National Co-Chairman of the Socialist Party.&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;James Ring Adams, "Division in American Socialism," ''New America'' [New York], vol. 11, no. 15 (Oct. 15, 1973), pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Although little remarked upon at the time despite Harrington's status as "possibly the most widely known of the Socialist leaders since the death of Norman Thomas", it soon became clear that this was the precursor of a decisive split in the organization.&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt;

Harrington had written extensively about the progressive potential of the so-called "New Politics" in the Democratic Party and had come to advocate unilateral withdrawal from the Vietnam War and to advocate positions regarded by more conservative party members as "avant-garde" on the questions of [[abortion]] and [[gay rights movement|gay rights]].&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt; This put Harrington and his co-thinkers at odds with the party's younger generation of leaders, who espoused a strongly labor-oriented direction for the party and who were broadly supportive of [[AFL–CIO]] leader [[George Meany]].&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt;

In the early spring of 1973, Harrington resigned his membership in SDUSA. That same year, Harrington and his supporters formed the [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] (DSOC). At its start, DSOC had 840 members, of which 2 percent served on its national board, while approximately 200 had been members of SDUSA or its predecessors &lt;!-- (the [[Socialist Party of America#Max Shachtman.2C Civil Rights.2C and the War on Poverty|Socialist&amp;nbsp;Party Social&amp;nbsp;Democratic Federation]], "formerly the Socialist Party,&amp;nbsp;USA"), --&gt; whose membership was then 1,800, according to a 1973 profile of Harrington.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|O'Rourke|1993|pp=195–196}}: &lt;p&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Rourke|first=William|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5iUJfPxlTCcC&amp;pg=PA195|chapter=L: Michael Harrington|title=Signs of the literary times: Essays, reviews, profiles, 1970-1992'|pages=192–196|publisher=SUNY Press|series=The Margins of Literature (SUNY Series)|year=1993|isbn=0-7914-1681-X &lt;!--|ISBN=9780791416815 --&gt;|ref=harv}}

In 1982, DSOC established the [[Democratic Socialists of America]] (DSA) upon merging with the [[New American Movement]], an organization of democratic socialists mostly from the New Left.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=e3MtTr68Hc7NswbvtLH3Dw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=O4h5AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Isserman%2C+DSOC%2C+NAM+%22Michael+Harrington%22%2C+%22New+York+Times%22&amp;q=DSOC%2C+NAM#search_anchor Isserman, p. 349]: Isserman, Maurice (2001) ''The Other American: The Life of Michael Harrington.'' New York: Perseus Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Union for Democratic Socialism]] was another organization, which was formed by former members of the Socialist Party. [[David McReynolds]], who had resigned from the Socialist Party between 1970 and 1971&lt;!-- either 1970 or 1971: McReynolds's blog repeatedly states 1971, while otherwise reliable sources say 1970 --&gt;, along with many from the Debs Caucus, were the core members. In 1973, the UDS declared itself the [[Socialist Party USA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sp-usa.org/ncminutes/1006nc.html Minutes] of October 2006 Socialist Party National Committee meeting.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

=== Official national press ===
Most of the socialist press was privately owned as the party was concerned that a single official publication might lead to censorship in favor of the editors' views, in much the same way [[Daniel DeLeon]] used ''The People'' to dominate the [[Socialist Labor Party]]. A number of papers carried the party's official notices in its first years, the most important being ''The Worker'' (New York), ''The Appeal to Reason'' (Girard, Kansas), ''The Socialist'' (Seattle and Toledo, OH), ''The Worker's Call'' (Chicago), ''St. Louis Labor'' and ''The Social Democratic Herald'' (Milwaukee). The party soon discovered that it needed a more regular means of communication with its members and the 1904 National Convention decided to establish a regular party organ. Over the next seven decades, a series of official publications were issued directly by the SPA, most of which are today available on microfilm in essentially full runs:
* ''Socialist Party Bulletin'' (Monthly) Chicago — vol. 1, no. 1 (September 1904) – vol. 9, no. 6 (March/April 1913).
* ''Socialist Party Weekly Bulletin'' Chicago — 1905? to 1909? &lt;small&gt;—Mimeographed. New York Public Library has partial run on microfilm, August 12, 1905 to September 4, 1909.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''The Party Builder'' (Weekly) Chicago — whole no. 1 (August 28, 1912) – whole no. 88 (July 11, 1914).
* ''The American Socialist'' (Weekly) Chicago — vol. 1, no. 1 (July 18, 1914) – vol. 4, no. 8 (September 8, 1917).
* ''The Eye Opener'' (Weekly) Chicago — previously existing publication, official from vol. ?, no. ? (August 25, 1917) to vol. ?, no. ? (June 1, 1920).
* ''Socialist Party Bulletin'' (Monthly) Chicago — vol. 1, no. 1 (February 1917) – vol. ?, no. ? (June 1920). &lt;small&gt;— may have suspended publication July 1917 through May 1919.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''The New Day'' (Weekly) Milwaukee — vol. 1, no. 1 (June 12, 1920) – vol. ?, no. ? (July 22, 1922).
* ''Socialist World'' (Monthly) Chicago — vol. 1, no. 1 (July 15, 1920) – vol. 6, no. 8 (October 1925).
* ''American Appeal'' (Weekly) Chicago — vol. 7, no. 1 (January 1, 1926) – vol. 8, no. 48 (November 26, 1927) &lt;small&gt; — merged into ''[[New Leader|The New Leader]].''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Although privately owned, ''The New Leader,'' published in New York City, was the semi-official organ of the SPA from December 1927 until supplanted by the rival ''Socialist Call'' in 1935, a rival New York publication which was also initially privately owned. ''The New Leader'' was published by the Rand School, a party organization that left with the party to join the [[Social Democratic Federation (United States)|Social Democratic Federation]] and served as that group's official voice until 1940. After the mid-1940s it was published by the "American Labor Conference on Foreign Affairs" and gradually lost its socialist character.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Labor and Socialist Press News'' Chicago — August 30, 1929 – February 26, 1932 &lt;small&gt; — Mimeographed weekly.&lt;/small&gt;
** ''Labor and Socialist Press Service'' Chicago — March 4, 1932 – July 17, 1936. &lt;small&gt; — Mimeographed weekly.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''American Socialist Quarterly'' New York — vol. 1, no. 1 (January 1932) – vol. 4, no. 3 (Nov. 1935).
** ''American Socialist Monthly'' New York — vol. 5, no. 1 (March 1936) – vol. 6, no. 1 (May 1937).
** ''Socialist Review'' (irregular) New York — vol. 6, no. 2 (September 1937) – vol. 7, no. 2 (Spring 1940).
* ''Socialist Action'' (Monthly) Chicago — vol. 1, no. 1 (October 20, 1934) – vol. 2, no. 9 (Nov. 1936). &lt;small&gt;Three mimeographed "Socialist Action Pamphlets" also produced, press run of 200.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''The Socialist Call'' (various) New York/Chicago — vol. 1, no. 1 (March 23, 1935) – vol. ?, no. ? (Spring 1962).&lt;ref&gt;Goldwater, Walter ''Radical Periodicals in America, 1890-1950.'' New Haven: Yale University Library, 1964; pp. 2-3, 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Hammer and Tongs'' (irregular) New York/Milwaukee — no numbers used, January 1940 - November 1972.
* ''Socialist Campaigner'' (irregular) New York — vol. 1, no. 1 (early 1940) to Vol. 5, no. 3 (December 26, 1944). &lt;small&gt;— Mimeographed.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''Organizers' Bulletin'' (irregular) New York — no. 1 (middle 1940) to no. 3 (September 1940). &lt;small&gt;— Mimeographed.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''Progress Report'' (Monthly) New York — unnumbered, June 1950 to September 1951. &lt;small&gt;— Mimeographed, sent to branch organizers and functionaries.&lt;/small&gt;
** ''News and Views'' (Monthly) New York — unnumbered, October 1951 to December 1953. &lt;small&gt;— Mimeographed, sent to branch organizers and functionaries.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''Socialist Party Bulletin'' (Monthly) New York — unnumbered, October 1955? to January 1957. &lt;small&gt; — Two page typeset newsletter.&lt;/small&gt;
** ''Socialist Bulletin'' (Monthly) New York — unnumbered, February 1957 to April 1958?. &lt;small&gt; — Name change due to merger with SDF.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''New America'' (bimonthly) New York — vol. 1, no. 1 (October 18, 1960) - vol. ?, no. ? (1985). &lt;small&gt;— continued as organ of [[Social Democrats, USA]].&lt;/small&gt;

The '''Sydney Peace Prize''' is awarded by the '''Sydney Peace Foundation''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Home - Sydney Peace Foundation
 | publisher = Sydney Peace Foundation
 | url = http://sydneypeacefoundation.org.au/
 | ref = harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
a not-for-profit organisation associated with the [[University of Sydney]]. The prize promotes peace with justice and the practice of nonviolence and encouraging public interest and discussion about issues of peace, social justice, human rights, and non-violent conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Peace with Justice Links &amp; Resources - Sydney Peace Foundation

 | ref = harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[City of Sydney]] is a major supporter of the Sydney Peace Prize. This involves a significant financial contribution along with other in-kind support in order to foster peace with justice.

Over three months each year, the Sydney Peace Prize jury – comprising seven individuals who represent corporate, media, academic and community sector interests – assesses the merits of the nominees' efforts to promote peace with justice. It is awarded to an organisation or individual:

* who has made significant contributions to global peace including improvements in personal security and steps towards eradicating poverty, and other forms of structural violence
* whose role and responsibilities enable the recipient to use the prize to further the cause of peace with justice
* whose work illustrates the philosophy and principles of non-violence

The jury has been prepared to make some controversial choices. Sydney Peace Foundation Founder, Emeritus Professor [[Stuart Rees]], said, "The initiators of the Sydney Peace Prize aimed to influence public interest in peace with justice, an ideal which is often perceived as controversial. The choice of a non-controversial candidate for a peace prize would be a safe option but unlikely to prompt debate or to increase understanding. Consensus usually encourages compliance, often anaesthetises and seldom informs."&lt;ref name=smh-2004 /&gt;

'''Tafnit''' ({{lang-he|תפנית}} ''Turnaround'') was an [[Israel]]i [[political party]] and a social movement established by the ''[[Aluf]]'' in reserve [[Uzi Dayan]].

==History==
Tafnit was established as a social movement. On 25 December 2005 Dayan announced that the movement would run in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2006|2006 Knesset elections]] as an anti-corruption party. However, the party received just 0.6% of the vote, failing to cross the 2% electoral threshold.
