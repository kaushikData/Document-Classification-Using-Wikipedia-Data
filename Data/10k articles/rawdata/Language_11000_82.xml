[[File:AnilKumarDutta.jpg|thumb|Anil Kumar Dutta]]

'''Anil Kumar Dutta''' ('''Born''' 1 Baisakh, 1340 [[Bengali calendar|Bangabda]] 15 April 1933, '''died''' 15 Bhadra 1412 1 September 2006 ) was an [[India]]n [[artist]] and educator.

He was the founder-editor of '''Shilpa O Sahitya''', a literary magazine and founder-principal of the Academy of Creative Art.

== Early life and education ==

Anil Kumar Dutta was born  in Sahanagar district of  south [[Kolkata]] to a family hailing from [[Barisal]]. He was 4th of 7 brothers born to Jnan Ranjan and Parul Bala Dutta. He lost both his parents within a span of six months when he was 7, his youngest brother was 3. He and his brothers were then raised by their grandmother.

From an early age, he was drawing, painting and writing poetry. He started publishing a hand written literary magazine that was passed along in the neighbourhood. When in high school, he and his friends started a ''Baroari Durga Puja'' and he made the idols for the first Puja there.  A special  feature of this Puja was that the Pandal was a veritable wall magazine. This in time became the ''Tarun Sangha Puja'' of Sahanagar which continues to this day.

After completing the Matriculation from Sahanagar High School, he entered Government Art College, Kolkata but had to discontinue due to financial difficulties.

The following year, he enrolled at the Calcutta Art School (later to be known as Calcutta Art College) and graduated First Class First, winning the Gold Medal in 1955.  His class mates tell the story that he was known amongst the students as ''Kabi'' (meaning poet) and it was widely expected that he would top the class.

He started a business on [[graphic design]] in 1956 named D G Press and Publicity Syndicate.

== Artistic ==

Though occupied with his business of graphic designs and commercial art, he continued to work on his main interests, painting portraits and landscapes.

=== Swakalbela ===
In 1979, he started his project ''Swakalbela'' ''(my own time)'' where he planned to paint portraits of 100 of his contemporaries. These series of portraits were painted directly with brush without any drawing and were completed in 2 or 3 sittings, each lasting between 60 and 90 minutes. He completed 62 portraits. He was also writing a book about the subjects of these portraits.

== Literary ==

In 1977,  he started a literary magazine, originally titled ''Mukto Patra''. Later, he started a publishing business, naming that ''Mukto Patra Publications'' and renamed the magazine ''Shilpo O Sahitya''.  As editor, he was always seeking out new and lesser known poets, authors and artists.

In 1986, he started the annual ''Shilpo O Sahitya'' awards for ''little magazines''. All Bengali little magazines published anywhere in the country were encouraged to enter and prizes were awarded in 5 categories,  best poem, best short story, best non-fiction, best cover design, best editing.

== Art education ==

He was a consultant on Restoration to the "Academy of Fine Arts" and a member of its Executive Committee. He recommended that the Academy of Fine Arts start a school on Art Education.  Thus, the "Institute of Visual Arts" was founded and he was the first Principal.

Later, he founded the "Academy of Creative Art", Kolkata in 1991 and was its first Principal.  The Academy offers two programmes, and a One Year certificate programme aimed at young artists and a Three Year (deemed to be) Degree programme aimed at Senior Artists and those planning to be Art Teachers.

{{update| \ "the article was written from 2011 and 2014 but the field is rapidly advancing"|date=May 2018}}

'''[[Arabic]]''' is one of the major languages that have been given attention by '''[[machine translation]]''' (MT) researchers since the very early days of MT and specifically in the U.S.  The language has always been considered "due to its [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], [[syntactic]], [[phonetic]] and [[phonological]] properties [to be] one of the most difficult languages for [[written language|written]] and [[spoken language]] processing."&lt;ref name=TRANSJ&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zughoul|first=Muhammad|author2=Abu-Alshaar, Awatef|title=English/Arabic/English Machine Translation: A Historical Perspective|journal=Translators' Journal|date=3 August 2005|volume=50|issue=3|pages=1022–1041|url=http://id.erudit.org/iderudit/011612ar|accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic "differs tremendously in terms of its [[character (symbol)|characters]], morphology and [[diacritic|diacritization]] from other languages."&lt;ref name=TRANSJ /&gt; Accordingly, researchers cannot always import solutions from other languages, and today Arabic machine translation still needs more efforts to be improved, mainly in the area of semantic representation systems, which are essential for achieving high quality translation.

== Approaches for the study of machine processing of Arabic ==

=== Particularistic approaches ===
Particularistic approaches describe the linguistic features of Arabic and use them for a local processing approach specific to the internal linguistic system of Arabic. They are concerned with the morphological and semantic aspects of Arabic. [[Sakhr Software Company|Sakhr]] is one of the Arabic speaking groups developing systematically machine processing of Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arabic Machine Translation|url=http://international.sakhr.com/arabic-machine-translation-MT.html|accessdate=4 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110715230846/http://international.sakhr.com/arabic-machine-translation-MT.html| archivedate= 15 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Universalist approaches ===
[[Universalist]] approaches use the methods and systems  proved to be useful in other languages like [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]] making some adaptations if necessary. The focus here is on the syntactic aspects of the linguistic system in general. This approach is followed by most of the companies producing [[software application]]s for Arabic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2122">'''Atypia''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]], ''a'' + ''typos'', without type; a condition of being irregular or nonstandard)&lt;ref&gt;Mosby's Medical Dictionary (8th edition). Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; is a pathologic term for a structural abnormality in a cell, i.e. it is used to describe atypical cells.

It may or may not be a [[precancerous]] indication associated with later [[malignant|malignancy]], but the level of appropriate concern is highly dependent on the context with which it is diagnosed.

Atypia can be caused by an infection or irritation if diagnosed in a [[Pap smear]], for example. In the [[uterus]] it is more likely to be precancerous. 
For example, already differentiated, specialised cells such as epithelia displaying "cellular atypia" are far less likely to become problematic [cancerous/ malignant] than are myeloid progenitor cells of the immune system. The 'further back' in an already specialised, differentiated cell's lineage, the more problematic cellular atypia is likely to be. This is due to the conferring of such atypia to progeny-cells further down the lineage of that cell type.

In current practice, microscopic analysis of haematoxylin and eosin stained section is the backbone in the diagnosis of breast cancer and other types of cancers. Traditionally, pathologists examine histological slides under a microscope, and make diagnostic decisions. This practice produces results which are subjective. Currently, efforts are being made to develop technology and systems which allow for the use of automated image analysis and machine learning techniques in grading cells which display atypia.

The related concept of [[dysplasia]] refers to an abnormality of development,&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|three/000033210|dysplasia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes abnormalities on larger, [[histopathologic]] scales.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6795">The '''BABEL speech corpus''' is a corpus of recorded speech materials from five [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an languages. Intended for use in speech technology applications, it was funded by a grant from the [[European Union]] and completed in 1998. It is distributed by the [[European Language Resources Association]].

==Development of the BABEL Project==
Following the creation of a speech corpus of European Union languages by the SAM project, funding was granted by the [[European Union]] for the creation along similar lines of a speech corpus of languages of [[Central and Eastern Europe]], with the name of BABEL.

The initial impetus came from the SAM (Speech Assessment Methods) project funded by the European Union as ESPRIT Project #1541 in 1987–89.&lt;ref&gt;D. Chan, A. Fourcin, D. Gibbon, B. Granstrom, M.

SAM produced many speech research tools and a corpus of recorded speech material distributed on CD-ROM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/shop/eurom1.php |title=EUROM1 - Multilingual Speech Corpus |publisher=University College London |accessdate=2015-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposal was made to the European Union under the Copernicus initiative in 1994, with the objective of creating a corpus of spoken [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and Grant #1304 was awarded for this. A pilot project to create a small corpus of spoken Bulgarian was carried out jointly by the Universities of Sofia (Bulgaria) and Reading (U.K.).&lt;ref&gt;Misheva, A., Dimitrova, S., Filipov, V., Grigorova, E., Nikov, M., Roach, P. and Arnfield, S. ‘Bulgarian Speech Database: a pilot study’, ''Proceedings of Eurospeech ‘95'', Madrid, vol. 1, pp.859-862 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; The initial meeting of the whole project team took place at the University of Reading in 1995.

==Recorded material==
Since the objective was to produce material suitable for use in speech technology applications, the digital recordings were made in strictly controlled conditions in recording studios. For each language the material had the following composition:

* Many-talker set: 30 males and 30 females each read 100 numbers, 3 connected-speech passages and 5 "filler" sentences (to provide further instances of some items) or 4 passages if no fillers were needed.
* Few-talker set: 5 males and 5 females, normally selected from the above group, each read 5 blocks of 100 numbers, 15 passages and 25 filler sentences, plus 5 lists of syllables.
* Very-few-talker set: 1 male and 1 female selected from the above read 5 blocks of syllables, with and without carrier sentences.

'''Bhoja''' (reigned c. 1010–1055 CE) was an Indian king from the [[Paramara dynasty]]. His kingdom was centered around the [[Malwa]] region in central India, where his capital [[Dhara (city)|Dhara-nagara]] (modern Dhar) was located. Bhoja [[Military career of Bhoja|fought wars]] with nearly all his neighbours in attempts to extend his kingdom, with varying degrees of success. At its zenith, his kingdom extended from [[Chittorgarh Fort|Chittor]] in the north to upper [[Konkan]] in the south, and from the [[Sabarmati River]] in the west to [[Vidisha]] in the east.

Bhoja is best known as a patron of arts, literature, and sciences. The establishment of the [[Bhoj Shala]], a centre for [[Sanskrit]] studies, is attributed to him. He was a [[polymath]], and several books covering a wide range of topics are attributed to him. He is also said to have constructed a large number of [[Shiva]] temples, although [[Bhojeshwar Temple]] in [[Bhojpur, Madhya Pradesh|Bhojpur]] (a city founded by him) is the only surviving temple that can be ascribed to him with certainty.

Because of his patronage to scholars, Bhoja became one of the most celebrated kings in the Indian history. After his death, he came to be featured in several legends as a righteous scholar-king. The body of legends clustered around him is comparable to that of the fabled [[Vikramaditya]].

== Early life ==

Bhoja's father and predecessor was [[Sindhuraja]]. According to ''Bhoja-Prabandha'', his mother's name was Savitri.{{sfn|Singh|1984|p=22}} Bhoja's reputation as a scholar-king suggests that he was well-educated as a child. The ''Bhoja-Prabandha'' states that he was educated by his guardians as well as other learned scholars.{{sfn|Singh|1984|pp=23–24}}

According to ''Bhoja-Prabandha'', early in his life, Bhoja suffered from intense headaches. Two [[Brahmin]] surgeons from [[Ujjain]] made him unconscious using an [[anaesthetic]] powder called ''moha-churna'', opened his [[cranial bone]], removed a tumor, and then made him regain his consciousness by administering another powder called ''sanjivani''.{{sfn|Hoernle|1907|p=xvii}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ramamurthi |title=Textbooks of Operative Neurosurgery (2 Vol.) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J-OD2LP4sTwC |year=2005 |publisher=BI |isbn=978-81-7225-217-5 |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legend of persecution by Munja ===

According to ''Tilaka-Manjari'', composed by Bhoja's contemporary Dhanapala, Bhoja's feet had auspicious birthmarks indicating that he was fit to be a king.{{sfn|Yadava|1982|p=38}} His uncle [[Vakpati Munja|Munja]] (and his father's predecessor) loved him greatly, and appointed him as the king.{{sfn|Singh|1984|p=16}}

However, several later legendary accounts state that Munja was initially jealous of Bhoja, and tried to prevent him from becoming a king. For example, the 14th century ''Prabandha-Chintamani'' states that during the reign of Munja, an astrologer prophesied Bhoja's long reign. Munja, who wanted his own son to become the king, ordered Bhoja's killing.{{sfn|Singh|1984|p=24}} Bhoja was appointed as the king by the royal ministers after Munja's death.{{sfn|Yadava|1982|p=38}} According to a Gujarati legend documented in [[Alexander Kinloch Forbes|Rasmala]], Munja ordered Bhoja's murder, but later appointed him as the crown prince.{{sfn|Singh|1984|p=16}}

''Bhoja-Prabandha'' states that Munja ordered one Vatsaraja to kill Bhoja at the Mahamaya temple in Bhuvaneshvari forest. On hearing Bhoja's cultured manner of talking, Vatsaraja and his men abandoned the murder plan. They faked Bhoja's death, and presented to Munja a fake head and a verse from Bhoja. The verse described how great kings like [[King Mandhata|Mandhata]], [[Rama]] and [[Yudhishthira]] died leaving behind all their property; it then sarcastically added that Munja would be the only one whom the earthly possessions would follow. The verse moved Munja to tears, and made him realize his mistake. When he learned that Bhoja was still alive, he invited Bhoja to back to his court. To repent for his sin, he also went on a pilgrimage to Dharmaranya, where he established a town called Munjapuram.{{sfn|Singh|1984|pp=24–25}} The sarcastic verse, purportedly written by Bhoja to Munja, also appears as an antonymous extract in ''[[Sharngadhara-paddhati]]'' (1363 CE).{{sfn|Singh|1984|pp=25–26}}

These stories of Bhoja's persecution by Munja are essentially mythical. This legend is not found in the works composed by the contemporaries of Munja, Sindhuraja and Bhoja. For example, the ''Nava-Sahasanka-Charita'' makes no mention of this story. The legend appears to be the poetic imagination of later composers.{{sfn|Singh|1984|p=26-27}} ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' also contains a variation of this account, but completely distorts the legend, naming Munja as the one who was persecuted by Bhoja. This account is also completely unreliable from a historical point of view.{{sfn|Singh|1984|p=26}}

== Anointment ==

Some literary works suggest that Bhoja succeeded his uncle [[Vakpati Munja|Munja]] as the Paramara king. These works include ''Tilaka-Manjari'', ''Prabandha-Chintamani'', and ''Rasmala''. However, several other works as well as epigraphic evidence indicate that Bhoja succeeded his father [[Sindhuraja]]. Padmagupta, the court poet of Sindhuraja and Bhoja, also supports this fact. According to ''Bhoja-Prabandha'', Munja left the Paramara administration in hands of Sindhuraja before departing on a military expedition. Munja unexpectedly died in this campaign, and as a result, Sindhuraja succeeded him as the king.{{sfn|Singh|1984|pp=16–17}} Sindhuraja's court poet Padmagupta, in his ''Nava-Sahasanka-Charita'', states that Munja "placed the world in Sindhuraja's hands" before leaving for Ambika's town. This indicates that he left the administration in Sindhuraja's hands before leaving for his fatal expedition against [[Tailapa II]].{{sfn|Singh|1984|pp=27–28}} ''Udaipur Prashasti'' inscription seems to confirm this.{{sfn|Yadava|1982|p=38}}

=== Period of reign ===

The [[Inscriptions of Bhoja#1011 CE Modasa copper-plates|Modasa copper plates]] (1010–11 CE) are the earliest historical record of Bhoja's reign.{{sfn|Mankodi|1987|pp=71–72}} The ''Chintamani-Sarnika'' (1055 CE) was composed by Bhoja's court poet Dasabala.{{sfn|Mankodi|1987|pp=71–72}} An inscription of Bhoja's successor Jayasimha I is also dated 1055 CE. Thus, 1055 CE can be taken as the last year of Bhoja's reign.{{sfn|Singh|1984|p=21}} Based on these evidences, scholars such as Pratipal Bhatia assign Bhoja's reign to 1010–1055 CE.{{sfn|Jain|1972|p=341}}

However, some scholars assign the beginning of Bhoja's reign variously between 1000 CE and 1010 CE, based on their interpretations of inscriptions and legendary texts.{{sfn|Singh|1984|pp=30–33}} For example, Merutunga's ''Prabandha-Chintamani'' states that Bhoja ruled for 55 years, 7 months and 3 days{{sfn|Singh|1984|p=21}} Based on this, scholars such as D. C. Ganguly and K. C. Jain assign Bhoja's reign to 1000–1055 CE.{{sfn|Jain|1972|p=341}} However, as [[K. M. Munshi]] states, dates are "the weakest point in Merutunga's narratives".{{sfn|Singh|1984|p=30}}

=== Names and titles ===

In the Paramara inscriptions, Bhoja is mentioned as ''Bhoja-[[deva (Hinduism)|deva]]''. In some modern north Indian languages such as [[Hindi]], he is also known as "Bhoj" (because of [[schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages|schwa deletion]]). Bhoja's inscriptions mention his titles as ''Parama-bhattaraka'', ''[[Maharajadhiraja]]'' and ''Parameshvara''.{{sfn|Trivedi|1991|p=33}} ''Ganaratna Mahodadhi'' (1140 CE), a work on grammar by Vardhamana, suggests that "Tribhuvan Narayana" or "Triloka Narayana" ("Lord of the three [[loka|worlds]]") was also a title of Bhoja. This is corroborated by epigraphic evidence: the Shiva temple ascribed to Bhoja in the Chittor fort has an idol which was named "Bhojasvamindeva" as well as "Tribhuvan Narayanadeva".{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=129}}

&lt;/mapframe&gt;

While Bhoja became famous as a benevolent king and a patron of arts and culture, he was also renowned as a warrior.{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=129}} He inherited a kingdom centered around the [[Malwa]] region, and made several attempts to expand it with varying results. The ''Udaipur [[Prashasti]]'' inscription of Bhoja's brother claims that Bhoja ruled the land from the [[Himalayas]] in the North to [[Malabar region|Malabar]] in the south, which is an obvious exaggeration.{{sfn|Singh|1984|p=37}} Historical evidence indicates that Bhoja's kingdom extended from [[Chittorgarh Fort|Chittor]] in the north to upper [[Konkan]] in the south, and from the [[Sabarmati River]] in the west to [[Vidisha]] in the east.{{sfn|Mankodi|1987|p=62}}

Several legends mention conflicts between the ruler of Malwa and the [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukyas]], during the reign of the Chaulukya kings [[Vallabharaja|Vallabha-raja]] and [[Durlabharaja (Chaulukya dynasty)|Durlabha-raja]]. Vallabha is said to have died of smallpox during an expedition against the Paramaras. This incident may have happened during the early part of Bhoja's reign, or during the reign of his father [[Sindhuraja]].{{sfn|Seth|1978|pp=130–132}}{{sfn|Singh|1984|pp=38–40}} Vallabha's successor Durlabha is said to have repulsed an attack by a confederacy that included the ruler of Malwa, but modern historians doubt the authenticity of this legend.{{sfn|Seth|1978|pp=133–134}}{{sfn|Singh|1984|p=41}}

Bhoja's first military aggression appears to be his invasion of the [[Lata (region)|Lata region]] (in present-day [[Gujarat]]), around 1018 CE. Bhoja subjugated the [[Chalukyas of Lata]], whose ruler Kirtiraja may have served as his feudatory for a brief period.{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=137}}{{sfn|Sen|1999|p=320}} Bhoja's invasion of Lata brought him close to the [[Shilahara]] kingdom of northern [[Konkana Kingdom|Konkana]], which was located to the south of Lata.{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=136}} Bhoja invaded and captured Konkana sometime between 1018 and 1020 CE, during the reign of the Shilahara king [[Arikesarin|Arikesari]].{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=139}} He celebrated this victory in a big way by making generous donations to [[Brahmin]]s. His 1020 CE inscription states that he organized a ''Konkana-Grahana Vijaya Parva'' ("Konkan Victory Festival").{{sfn|Seth|1978|pp=140–141}} The Shilaharas probably continued to administer Konkana as Bhoja's vassals.{{sfn|Singh|1984|p=46}} By the end of his reign, Bhoja had lost this territory to the [[Chalukyas of Kalyani]].{{sfn|Seth|1978|pp=141–144}}

Sometime before 1019 CE, Bhoja formed an alliance against the Chalukyas of Kalyani with [[Rajendra Chola]] and [[Gangeyadeva]] [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri]]. At this time, [[Jayasimha II (Western Chalukya dynasty)|Jayasimha II]] was the Chalukya king.{{sfn|Choubey|2006|p=63}} The triple alliance engaged the Chalukyas at their northern and southern frontiers simultaneously.{{sfn|Seth|1978|pp=144–145}} The extent of Bhoja's success in this campaign is not certain, as both Chalukya and Paramara [[panegyric]]s claimed victory.{{sfn|Bose|2015|p=27}} D. C. Ganguly believes that Bhoja achieved some early victories against the Chalukyas, but was ultimately defeated. Others, including D. B. Diskalkar and [[Hem Chandra Raychaudhuri|H. C. Ray]], believe that Bhoja was defeated by Jayasimha after some early successes, but ultimately emerged victorious against the Chalukyas after 1028 CE. According to [[Georg Bühler]], the struggle probably ended with some advantage for Bhoja, which might have been exaggerated into a great victory by the Paramara poets.{{sfn|Singh|1984|p=50}}

The ''Udaipur Prashasti'' states that Bhoja defeated a ruler named Indraratha. Modern historians identify this king with Indranatha, the [[Somavaṃśī dynasty|Somavamshi]] king of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]]. This king was defeated by [[Rajendra Chola]]: Bhoja may have played a secondary role in the Chola campaign as part of an alliance.{{sfn|Seth|1978|pp=167–168}}{{sfn|Singh|1984|pp=56–57}}

The [[Ghaznavids]], a Muslim dynasty of [[Turkic people|Turkic]] origin, invaded north-western India in the 11th century, led by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]]. The ''Udaipur Prashasti'' claims that Bhoja's mercenaries defeated the Turushkas (Turkic people).{{sfn|Seth|1978|pp=155–156}} There are some legendary accounts of Bhoja's military successes against the foreign invaders identified with the Ghaznavids. However, there is no clear evidence to show that Bhoja fought against the Ghaznavids or any other Muslim army.{{sfn|Singh|1984|p=60}} Bhoja might have contributed troops to the [[Kabul Shahi]] ruler [[Anandapala]]'s fight against the Ghaznavids. He is believed to have granted asylum to Anandapala's son Trilochanapala.{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=158}} Several medieval Muslim historians state that Mahmud avoided a confrontation with a powerful Hindu ruler named Param Dev after sacking the [[Somnath]] Hindu temple. Modern historians identify Param Dev as Bhoja: the name may be a corruption of Paramara-Deva or of Bhoja's title ''Parameshvara-Paramabhattaraka''.{{sfn|Seth|1978|pp=163–165}}{{sfn|Singh|1984|pp=61–62}} Bhoja may have also been a part of the Hindu alliance that expelled Mahmud's governors from [[Hansi]], [[Thanesar]] and other areas around 1043 CE.{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=166}}{{sfn|Sen|1999|p=320}}

Bhoja's attempt to expand his kingdom eastwards was foiled by the [[Chandela]] king [[Vidyadhara (Chandela king)|Vidyadhara]].{{sfn|Singh|1984|p=69}} However, Bhoja was able to extend his influence among the Chandela feudatories, possibly after Vidyadhara's death. The [[Kachchhapaghata dynasty|Kachchhapaghatas]] of Dubkund, who were the northern neighbours of the Paramaras, were originally Chandela feudatories. However, their ruler Abhimanyu accepted Bhoja's suzerainty.{{sfn|Singh|1984|pp=172–173}} Bhoja also launched a campaign against the Kachchhapaghatas of [[Gwalior]], possibly with the ultimate goal of capturing [[Kannauj]], but his attacks were repulsed by their ruler Kirtiraja.{{sfn|Singh|1984|pp=173}}

According to the ''Udaipur Prashasti'' inscription, Bhoja defeated the [[Gurjaradesa|Gurjara]] king. The identity of this king is debated by the historians, but he is generally identified as a weak [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] ruler of [[Kannauj]]. Bhoja did not retain control of Kannauj for a long time, if at all.{{sfn|Seth|1978|pp=174–175}}

The 1046 CE [[Inscriptions of Bhoja#1046 CE Tilakwada inscription|Tilakawada copper plate inscription]] states that Bhoja's general Suraditya stabilized his royal fortune by slaughtering one Sahavahana in a battle.{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=175}} Some earlier historians identified Sahavahana as a king of [[Chamba State|Chamba]], but this identification is doubtful, considering the distance between Chamba and Malwa, and the fact that the ruler of Chamba was not powerful enough to destabilize Bhoja's kingdom.{{sfn|Seth|1978|pp=175–176}} Sahavahana might been a general of one of Bhoja's rivals, possibly the Kalachuri king Karna.{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=176}}

Bhoja defeated and killed [[Viryarama]], the [[Chahamanas of Shakambhari|Shakambhari Chahamana]] ruler. Encouraged by this success, he also waged a war against the [[Chahamanas of Naddula]]. But in this second campaign, his army was forced to retreat, and his general Sadha was killed.{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=177}}

During the last years of Bhoja's reign, sometime after 1042 CE, Jayasimha's son and successor [[Someshvara I]] invaded Malwa, and sacked his capital [[Dhara (city)|Dhara]].{{sfn|Sen|1999|p=320}} Multiple Chalukya inscriptions dated between 1058 and 1067 CE state that the Chalukyas plundered the important Paramara cities, including Dhara, [[Ujjayini]] and [[Mandu, Madhya Pradesh|Mandapa]].{{sfn|Seth|1978|pp=151–153}} Bhoja re-established his control over Malwa soon after the departure of the Chalukya army. Nevertheless, the defeat was a major setback for the Paramaras, and pushed back the southern boundary of their kingdom from [[Godavari River|Godavari]] to [[Narmada River|Narmada]].{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=154}}{{sfn|Singh|1984|p=56}}

Although the Bhoja and Kalachuri king Gangeya were part of an alliance against the Chalukyas, Bhoja defeated Gangeya. It is not certain when they turned into enemies. According to one theory, Bhoja defeated Gangeya before his Chalukya campaign, in which Gangeya must have fought as a Paramara vassal. A contradictory theory is that the two turned enemies after their Chalukya campaign, sometime between 1028 CE and 1042 CE.{{sfn|Singh|1984|pp=65–66}}{{sfn|Seth|1978|pp=170–171}} The ''Udaipur Prashasti'' also claims that Bhoja defeated one Togglala,{{sfn|Singh|1984|p=36}} who might have been Gangeya's predecessor [[Kokalla II]].{{sfn|Bose|2015|p=281}}

== Death ==

During the last year of Bhoja's reign, or shortly after his death, the Chaulukya king [[Bhima I]] and the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri]] king [[Lakshmikarna|Karna]] attacked his kingdom. According to the 14th century author Merutunga, Bhoja had once thought of subjugating Bhima, but Bhima's diplomat avoided a Paramara invasion by instigating Bhoja against the [[Chalukyas of Kalyani]] instead.{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=148-150}} Sometime before 1031 CE, Bhima launched an expedition against the Paramara branch at [[Mount Abu|Abu]], forcing its ruler Dhandhuka to seek shelter with Bhoja.{{sfn|Seth|1978|pp=180–181}} [[Hemachandra]], who was patronized by the Chaulukyas, states that Bhoja's general Kulachandra once sacked the Chaulukya capital while Bhima was fighting a war at the [[Sindh]] frontier.{{sfn|Seth|1978|pp=179–181}} Bhima later dispatched his soldiers to raid Malwa several times. Merutunga's ''Prabandha-Chintamani'' states that once two such soldiers attacked Bhoja in the vicinity of his capital [[Dhara (city)|Dhara]], but the Paramara king escaped unhurt.{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=181}}

Merutunga also states that Karna once challenged Bhoja to either a war or a palace-building contest. Bhoja, who was an old man by this time, chose the second option. Bhoja lost this contest, but refused to accept Karna's suzerainty. As a result, Karna, in alliance with Bhima, invaded Malwa. According to Merutunga, Bhoja died of a disease at the same time the allied army attacked his kingdom.{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=182}}{{sfn|Singh|1984|pp=66–67}} Several literary works written under Chaulukya patronage suggest that Bhima subjugated Bhoja while Bhoja was still alive. However, such claims are not corroborated by historical evidence.{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=184}}{{sfn|Singh|1984|p=68}}

== Cultural contributions ==
[[File:Bhojpur Mandir.jpg|thumb|The incomplete [[Bhojeshwar Temple]] in [[Bhojpur, Madhya Pradesh]]]]

Bhoja is best remembered for his intellect and patronage to cultural activities. Noted poets and writers of his time sought his sponsorship. The Kashmiri writer [[Bilhana]] famously rued that Bhoja died before him, because of which he failed to seek the king's patronage. Several later kings also emulated Bhoja. For example, [[Krishnadevaraya]] of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] styled himself as ''Abhinava-Bhoja'' ("the new Bhoja") and ''Sakala-Kala-Bhoja'' ("Bhoja of all the arts").{{sfn|Pollock|2003|p=179}}

Bhoja was himself a polymath. Under his rule, Mālwa and its capital [[Dhara (city)|Dhara]] became one of the chief intellectual centres of India. He is said to have paid great attention to the education of his people, so much so that even humble weavers in the kingdom are supposed to have composed metrical [[Sanskrit]] kavyas.

Bhoja is said to have founded the city of [[Bhojpur, Madhya Pradesh|Bhojpur]], a belief supported by historical evidence. Besides the [[Bhojeshwar Temple]] there, the construction of three now-breached dams in that area is attributed to him.{{sfn|Mankodi|1987|p=71}} The temple originally stood on the banks of a reservoir 18.5 long and 7.5 miles wide.{{sfn|Mankodi|1987|p=68}} This reservoir was formed through construction of 3 earth-and-stone dams during Bhoja's reign. The first dam, built on [[Betwa River]], trapped the river waters in a depression surrounded by hills. A second dam was constructed in a gap between the hills, near present-day Mendua village. A third dam, located in present-day Bhopal, diverted more water from the smaller Kaliasot river into the Betwa dam reservoir. This man-made reservoir existed until 15th century, when [[Hoshang Shah]] emptied the lake by breaching two of the dams.{{sfn|Mankodi|1987|p=71}}

Bhoja established the [[Bhoj Shala]] which was a centre for [[Sanskrit]] studies and a temple of [[Sarasvatī]] in present-day [[Dhar]]. According to folklore, the [[Bhopal]] city was established by and named after him ("Bhojpal"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The táj-ul ikbál tárikh Bhopal, or, The history of Bhopal | author = [[Sultan Shah Jahan, Begum of Bhopal]] | publisher = Thacker, Spink | year = 1876 | page = 222 | oclc = 28302607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is possible that the city derives its name from another king called Bhupala (or Bhupal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Historical Geography of Madhya Pradesh from Early Records | author = Pranab Kumar Bhattacharyya | publisher = [[Motilal Banarsidass]] | year = 1977 | isbn = 978-0-8426-9091-1 | page = 275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/MP-BHO-cpi-joins-campaign-against-naming-bhopal-as-bhojpal-1939473.html CPI joins campaign against naming Bhopal as Bhojpal].

===Literary works===

Bhoja was renowned as a scholar-king, and several books are attributed to him. Because these books cover an enormous range of topics, it is not certain if he actually wrote all these books or if he only commissioned these works, acting as a patron of their actual writers. But it is known that he was an expert on poetry, and the treatise ''Shringara-Prakasha'' was definitely authored by him.&lt;ref name="JLM_2001"&gt;{{cite book |title=Semiosis in Hindustani music |last=Martinez |first=José Luiz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OwJRnFIcM4cC&amp;pg=PA219 |year=2001 |origyear=1997 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |location=Delhi |isbn=81-208-1801-6 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ajada, who wrote a commentary titled ''Padaka-prakasha'' on ''Sarasvati-Kanthabharana'', Bhoja wrote 84 books. The surviving works attributed to Bhoja include the following [[Sanskrit]]-language texts ([[IAST]] titles in bracket):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Banerji |first=Sures |title=A companion to Sanskrit literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JkOAEdIsdUsC&amp;pg=PA24 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |location=Delhi |year=1989 |isbn=978-81-208-0063-2 |page=24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bhatia|1970|pp=318–321}}

The [[Prakrit]] language poems ''Kodanda-Kavya'' and ''Kurma-Sataka'' are also attributed to Bhoja.{{sfn|Bhatia|1970|pp=318–321}} The ''Kodanda-Kavya'' (Kodaṅḍakāvya) was found inscribed on stone slab fragments at [[Mandu, Madhya Pradesh|Mandu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Influence of Classical Poets on the Inscriptional Poets |author=D.

''Sangitaraja'', attributed to Kalasena or [[Kumbha of Mewar|Kumbha]], names Bhoja as an authority on music, which suggests that Bhoja also compiled or wrote a work on music.{{sfn|Bhatia|1970|pp=318–321}}

== Religion ==

Historical evidence suggests that Bhoja was a devotee of [[Shiva]]. His writings qualify Shiva as "Jagadguru" ("World teacher"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OrgSAAAAMAAJ |title=Technical Literature in Sanskrit |volume=10 |author=S. Venkitasubramonia Iyer |publisher=Department of Sanskrit, University of Kerala |year=1978 |page=161 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Inscriptions of Bhoja|his inscriptions]] begin with verses praising Shiva.{{sfn|Trivedi|1991|p=33}} The ''[[Udaipur (Madhya Pradesh)|Udaipur]] Prashasti'' inscription of the later Paramara rulers states that Bhoja "covered the earth with temples" dedicated to the various aspects of Shiva, including Kedareshvara, Rameshwara, Somanatha, [[Kal Bhairav|Kala]], and Rudra. The Jain writer Merutunga, in his ''Prabandha-Chintamani'', states that Bhoja constructed 104 temples in his capital city of [[Dhar]]a alone. However, the [[Bhojeshwar Temple]] in [[Bhojpur, Madhya Pradesh|Bhojpur]] is the only surviving shrine that can be attributed to Bhoja with certainty.{{sfn|Mankodi|1987|p=61}} The Samidheshvara or Tribhuvana Narayana Shiva temple of Chittor is also believed to have been constructed by Bhoja; it has an idol, which was originally called Bhoja-svamin-deva.{{sfn|Yadava|1982|p=166}}{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=129}}

The Jain legends state that Bhoja converted to [[Jainism]]. According to this account, his court poet Dhanapala convinced the king to give up [[animal sacrifice in Hinduism|Vedic animal sacrifices]].{{sfn|Yadava|1982|p=12}} The poet also openly ridiculed Bhoja's other religious beliefs, including his worship of [[Kamadeva]]-[[Rati]] and [[cattle in religion|cow]].{{sfn|Yadava|1982|p=13}} Gradually, Dhanapala convinced Bhoja to become a Jain.{{sfn|Yadava|1982|p=14}}

These accounts of Bhoja's conversion to Jainism are irreconcilable with historical evidence.&lt;ref name="LHG_1950"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QzXhAAAAMAAJ |title=The Narrative of Bhoja (Bhojaprabandlha) |author=Ballala |translator=[[Louis Herbert Gray|Louis H. Gray]] |year=1950 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''Bhoja-Prabandlha'' legend, a Brahmin named Govinda calls Bhoja a [[Vaishnavite]].&lt;ref name="LHG_1950"/&gt; It is possible that Bhoja patronized other faiths despite being a Shaivite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LnwYAQAAMAAJ |title=Art &amp; Architecture of Daśārṇa (Malwa) Region |author=Rahman Ali |publisher=Sharada |year=2008 |isbn=9788188934546 |page=38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

Bhoja married multiple women as part of matrimonial alliances with other ruling dynasties. His chief queen was Liladevi or Lilavati. His other queens included Padmavati (princess of [[Kuntala country|Kuntala]]), Chandramukhi (princess of [[Anga]]) and Kamala.{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=130}}

Inscriptional evidence suggests that he was succeeded by [[Jayasimha I (Paramara dynasty)|Jayasimha]], who was probably his son.{{sfn|Warder|1992|pp=177}} Jayasimha's [[Mandhata]] grant of 1055 CE mentions his predecessors as Bhoja, Sindhuraja and Vakpati.{{sfn|Trivedi|1991|p=62}} However, this inscription does not specify the relationship between Bhoja and Jayasimha, and it is the only epigraph that mentions a Paramara king named Jayasimha. The ''Udaipur Prashasti'' and ''Nagpur Prashasti'' inscriptions of the later Paramara kings give a detailed genealogy of the Paramara kings, but do not mention Jayasimha. These two inscriptions name [[Udayaditya]] as the next ruler after Bhoja. Udayaditya is now known to be Bhoja's brother.{{sfn|Trivedi|1991|p=63}}

== Legends ==

In terms of the number of legends centered around him, Bhoja is comparable to the fabled [[Vikramaditya]].{{sfn|Warder|1992|pp=176}} [[Sheldon Pollock]] describes Bhoja as "the most celebrated poet-king and philosopher-king of his time, and perhaps of any Indian time".{{sfn|Pollock|2003|p=178}} Bhoja came to be featured in several legends as a righteous scholar-king, who was the ultimate judge of literary qualities and generously rewarded good poets and writers. Most of these legends were written three to five centuries after his death.{{sfn|Pollock|2003|pp=179–180}}

Apart from epigraphic records, much of the information about Bhoja comes from these legendary accounts, including Merutunga's ''Prabandha-Chintamani'' (14th century), Rajavallabha's ''Bhoja-Charitra'' (15th century), and Ballala's ''Bhoja-Prabandha'' (17th century). However, many of the popular legends about Bhoja do not have any historical basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uywqAQAAIAAJ |title=Sruti, Issues 184–195 |editor=P.N. Sundaresan |year=2000 |page=253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ''Bhoja-Prabandha'' [[anachronism|anachronistically]] describes the ancient poet [[Kalidasa]] as a contemporary of Bhoja.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVxjAAAAMAAJ |title=Sanskrit and Indological Studies: Dr. V. Raghavan Felicitation Volume |author=[[Venkataraman Raghavan]] |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |year=1975 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to enhance their imperial claims, the Paramaras promoted several legends associating Bhoja with the ancient legendary kings. For example, in ''[[Simhasana Dvatrimsika]]'' (popularly known as ''Singhasan Battisi''), Bhoja finds a throne of Vikramaditya, and each of the 32 divine figurines attached to the throne tell him a story about Vikramaditya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ziolkowski |first=Jan M. |title=Fairy Tales from Before Fairy Tales: The Medieval Latin Past of Wonderful Lies |publisher=University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mJ12yPfBL4IC&amp;pg=PA220 |page=220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2009|p=264}} A ''[[Bhavishya Purana]]'' legend describes Bhoja as a descendant of Vikramaditya and [[Shalivahana]]. According to this legend, the [[mleccha]] (foreign) influence had corrupted Indian culture by the time of Bhoja's ascension. Bhoja marched up to the banks of the [[Indus river]], and defeated several mleccha kings. The poet [[Kalidasa]], who accompanied him, magically turned into ashes a mleccha named Mahamada, whose followers came to be known as Muslim (The character Mahamada is based on [[Muhammad]] possibly combined with [[Mahmud of Ghazni]]). After returning to his capital, Bhoja established [[Sanskrit]] language among the top three [[varna in Hinduism|varnas]] and [[Prakrit]] language among the [[Shudra]]s. During his 50-year reign, [[Aryavarta]] (the land between the [[Himalayas]] and the [[Vindhyas]]) became a blessed land where the varna system was established. On the other hand, caste mixture took place beyond the Vindhyas (that is, in [[South India]]).{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2009|pp=273–275}} Again, this is an imaginary account not supported by any historical evidence.{{sfn|Singh|1984|p=60}}

'''Bottle-shock''' or '''Bottle-sickness''' is a  temporary condition of [[wine]] characterized by muted or disjointed fruit flavors. It often occurs immediately after [[bottling line|bottling]] or when wines (usually fragile wines) are given an additional dose of [[sulfur]] (in the form of [[sulfur dioxide]] or [[sulfite]] solution).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3969">In [[linguistics]], '''cataphora''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|t|æ|f|ə|r|ə}}; from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], ''[[wikt:en:καταφορά#Ancient Greek|καταφορά]]'', ''kataphora'', "a downward motion" from ''[[wikt:en:κατά#Ancient Greek|κατά]]'', ''kata'', "downwards" and ''[[wikt:en:φέρω#Ancient Greek|φέρω]]'', ''pherō'', "I carry") is the use of an expression or word that [[Coreference|co-refers]] with a later, more specific, expression in the discourse.&lt;ref name="Cutting2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joan Cutting|title=Pragmatics and Discourse: A Resource Book for Students : A, B, C, D|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KFELwzkFhYC&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=19 May 2013|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-25357-4|pages=10–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preceding expression, whose meaning is determined or specified by the later expression, may be called a '''cataphor'''.  Cataphora is a type of [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]], although the terms ''anaphora'' and ''anaphor'' are sometimes used in a stricter sense, denoting only cases where the order of the expressions is the reverse of that found in cataphora.

An example of cataphora in English is the following sentence:
:* When '''he''' arrived home, '''John''' went to sleep.
In this sentence, the pronoun ''he'' (the cataphor) appears earlier than the noun ''John'' (the [[Antecedent (grammar)|postcedent]]) that it refers to. This is the reverse of the more normal pattern, "strict" anaphora, where a [[referring expression]] such as ''John'' or ''the soldier'' appears before any pronouns that reference it.  Both cataphora and anaphora are types of [[endophora]].

== Examples ==
Other examples of the same type of cataphora are:
:* If you want '''some''', here's some '''parmesan cheese'''.
:* After '''he''' had received his orders, '''the soldier''' left the barracks.
:* If you want '''them''', there are '''cookies''' in the kitchen.

Cataphora across sentences is often used for rhetorical effect. It can build suspense and provide a description. For example:
:* '''He'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s the biggest slob I know.  '''He'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s really stupid.  '''He'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s so cruel.  '''He'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s my boyfriend Nick.

The examples of cataphora described so far are strict cataphora, because the anaphor is an actual [[pronoun]].  Strict within-sentence cataphora is highly restricted in the sorts of structures it can appear within, generally restricted to a preceding subordinate clause.  More generally, however, any fairly general [[noun phrase]] can be considered an anaphor when it [[Coreference|co-refers]] with a more specific noun phrase (i.e. both refer to the same entity), and if the more general noun phrase comes first, it can be considered an example of cataphora.  Non-strict cataphora of this sort can occur in many contexts, for example:
:* A '''little girl''', '''Jessica''', was playing on the swings.
('The anaphor ''a little girl'' co-refers with ''Jessica''.)
:* Finding '''the right gadget''' was a real hassle. I finally settled with a '''digital camera'''.
(The anaphor ''the right gadget'' co-refers with ''a digital camera''.)

Strict cross-sentence cataphora where the antecedent is an entire sentence is fairly common cross-linguistically:
:* I should have known '''it''': '''The task is simply too difficult.'''
:* ''Ich hätte '''es''' wissen müssen: '''Die Aufgabe ist einfach zu schwer.''''' (Same as previous sentence, in German.)

Cataphora of this sort is particularly common in formal contexts, using an anaphoric expression such as ''this'' or ''the following'':
:* '''This''' is what I believe: that '''all men were created equal'''.
:* After squaring both sides, we arrive at '''the following''': &lt;math&gt;x = y^3 + 2z - 1&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Politics of China |expanded = Law }}

The '''constitutional oath of office of China''' was implemented on January 1, 2016 through a decision by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] of [[China]]. The oath requirement applies to state civil servants elected or appointed by the [[National People's Congress]] and its Standing Committee at or above the county level.

==Background==
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, a constitutional oath system had never been established. [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] each had oath systems prior to their return to China, and both regions implemented oaths according to the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] and [[Macau Basic Law]], respectively, following China's resumption of sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.163.com/14/1021/06/A92FUAMR00014SEH.html 社科院法学专家:建议设立宪法宣誓制度和宪法日]，网易，2014-10-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/bmzz/aomen/2007-11/15/content_1372993.htm|title=中华人民共和国澳门特别行政区基本法|date=2007-11-15|publisher=中国人大网}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.cn/test/2005-07/29/content_18298.htm|title=中华人民共和国香港特别行政区基本法|date=2005-07-29|publisher=中国政府网}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, 2012, in celebration of the 12th National Constitution Day and the 30th anniversary of the enactment of China's current constitution, the [[Ningbo]] [[Yinzhou District, Ningbo|Yinzhou District]] People's Court in [[Zhejiang]] province organized the first constitutional oath ceremony in the history of China's people's courts. Nine newly-appointed judges and 24 jurists participated in the ceremony while holding copies of the constitution.

==History==
{{Wikisourcelang|zh|全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于实行宪法宣誓制度的决定|Decision of the National People's Congress Standing Committee Regarding the Implementation of a Constitutional Oath System (Chinese)}}

On October 23, 2014, the Fourth Plenum of the [[18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]] passed the Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Regarding Several Major Issues in the Promotion of the Rule of Law, which proposed "establishing a constitutional oath system, such that all state civil servants elected or appointed by the National People's Congress or its Standing Committee publicly swear an oath to the constitution upon formally taking office."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ifeng.com/a/20141028/42318825_0.shtml 中共中央关于全面推进依法治国若干重大问题的决定]，[[:zh-tw:凤凰网|凤凰网]]，2014-10-28&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2015, the 15th Meeting of the 12th Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed the Decision of the National People's Congress Standing Committee Regarding the Implementation of a Constitutional Oath System, with an effective date of January 1, 2016. The Decision requires state civil servants elected or appointed by the National People's Congress, its Standing Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and other central government organs, as well as equivalent local government organs at or above the county level, to publicly swear an oath to the constitution upon formally taking office.&lt;ref name="人民网0701"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politics.people.com.cn/n/2015/0702/c1001-27240309.html|title=我国通过宪法宣誓制度|date=2015-07-02|publisher=人民网|agency=新华社|accessdate=2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2018, the 33rd Meeting of the 12th Standing Committee of the National People's Congress revised the Decision that instituted the constitutional oath. The constitutional oath's last phrase was changed to "to work for a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious, and beautiful." In addition, the Decision expanded the oath-taking requirement to include members of the newly-created [[National Supervisory Commission]], and required [[March of the Volunteers|the national anthem]] to be played at the oath taking ceremony.&lt;ref name="2018 explanation"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/xinwen/2018-02/24/content_2038166.htm|title=关于《全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于实行宪法宣誓制度的决定（修订草案）》的说明|last=|first=|date=February 24, 2018|website=[[National People's Congress]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/70Z9mQkCX|archive-date=June 30, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=June 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news.php?id=103368&amp;sid=3|title=Public officials to sing national anthem, swear to serve 'great' China |date=2018-02-23|publisher=The Standard|accessdate=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Ceremony==

The Decision allows for the oath to be taken individually or in a group. If taken individually, the oath taker places his or her left hand on a copy of the Constitution, and raises his or her right hand in a fist. If taken in a group, one person leads the ceremony, with his or her left hand on a copy of the Constitution and his or her right hand raised in a fist. The other oath takers stand in a line with their right hands raised in a fist, and recite the oath along with the leader. The ceremony is to be "dignified" and "solemn," and the [[Flag of the People's Republic of China]] or the [[National Emblem of the People's Republic of China]] must be displayed. The [[National Anthem of the People's Republic of China]] must also be played at the ceremony.&lt;ref name="2018 decision"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/xinwen/2018-02/24/content_2038128.htm|title=全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于实行宪法宣誓制度的决定|last=|first=|date=February 24, 2018|website=[[National People's Congress]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/70ZAph9X8|archive-date=June 30, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=June 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''deadlock provision''', or '''deadlock resolution clause''', is a [[contract]]ual clause or series of clauses in a [[shareholders' agreement]] or other form of [[joint venture]] agreement which determines how disagreements on key issues are to be resolved in relation to the management of the enterprise.

Deadlock provisions vary enormously between different countries and with respect to different types of transactions.  However, characteristically the format of the provision will be as follows:
#Certain "key matters" will be designated as matters upon which deadlocks can arise.  These will usually be fairly fundamental matters relating to the management and control of the business.
#The provisions will then indicate if a "key matter" is raised at a certain number of consecutive meetings (occasionally just one meeting, but more often two or three) of the [[board of directors]] or other management organ of the business, a ''deadlock'' is said to have arisen.
#The two parties may then be asked to summarise their differences in writing, and ordinarily senior personnel on either side will meet to try to find an amicable resolution to the deadlock.  The provisions may require that a [[alternative dispute resolution|mediator]] may or shall be involved.
#If the parties fail to find an amicable solution, then the termination provisions will normally operate.

The main focus of most deadlock provisions are the termination provisions.  The principle underlying them is that a successful business enterprise should not be destroyed solely because the two partners are unable to agree on a core issue; the value of the business as a [[going concern]] should be preserved, and a fair way should be found to allow one party to bow out with fair recompense for giving up their share in the venture.

There are as many different types of termination provisions as the ingenuity of [[lawyer]]s can create.  However, a number of specific types of termination provisions have come to be used fairly regularly in commercial transactions where the parties are of equal standing in the venture, and have acquired characteristically descriptive names.

*'''Russian roulette'''.  A draconian solution to a deadlock, a Russian roulette provision requires one of the two deadlocked parties to serve a notice on the other party, and the serving party will name an all-cash price at which it values a half interest in the business.  The party receiving the notice then has the option to either buy the other party out, or sell out to the other party, at that price.
*'''Texas shoot-out'''.  Another dramatic solution to a deadlock, a Texas shoot-out involves each party sending a sealed all-cash bid to an umpire stating the price at which they are willing to buy out the other party.  The sealed bids are opened together, and the highest sealed bid "wins", and that bidder must then buy (and the "loser" must sell) the other half share in the business.
*'''Mexican shoot-out''' (also called ''''Dutch auction''').  A variation on the Texas shoot-out (and slightly different from the traditional [[Dutch auction]]), the parties send in sealed bids indicating the minimum price that they would be prepared to sell their half share for.  Whichever sealed bid is the higher "wins" and that bidder then buys the "loser's" share at the price indicated in the loser's sealed bid.
*'''Multi-choice procedure'''.  A softer option, when the parties do not wish to commit themselves to a more dramatic termination procedure, the deadlock can often provide for a series of options, one of which the parties must agree on, if the deadlock cannot be resolved.  The benefit of an open textured clause like this is that, when faced with the draconian consequences of the next step, the parties are thought to be better able to compromise.  The downside is that if the parties are truly at loggerheads, it usually requires a third party adjudicator (often an [[arbitrator]]) to impose one of the options upon them.
*'''Cooling-off/Mediation'''.  Not strictly a termination provision at all, many deadlock provisions 'end' by providing that the parties shall mediate until a solution is found (sometimes providing that if they cannot mediate out, the mediator will make a determination of reasonableness, which can then have knock-on effects under the contract).  Whilst sounding like a 'soft' option, such clauses often represent the [[judgment of Solomon]], as if the parties are unable to mediate the dispute out, then usually the enterprise will be dissolved.
*'''Deterrence approach'''.  Often the termination clause in deadlock provisions provides a punitive element for the party initiating the deadlock procedure.  In those clauses, a deadlock is only said to arise when one party serves a notice on the other indicating that a deadlock has arisen (instead of a failure to resolve on a key matter at a certain number of meetings).  The provisions will then provide for the determination of the "fair market value" of a half share in the business, usually by having it valued by an expert or [[auditor]] (or sometimes both in consultation).  Once the valuation is made, the party who served the notice must either (a) buy all the other party's share in the business at 125% of the fair price, or (b) sell its share to the other party at 75% of the fair price.  The downside to such clauses is that deadlocks rarely get resolved, and can lead to the business being paralysed by indecision.

Often the drafting of the deadlock provisions will depend to a great extent upon what the "key issues" that the parties want to ensure consensus upon are.

'''Dolors Monserdà i Vidal''' (née, '''Dolors Moncerdà i Vidal'''; also known as, '''Dolors Monserdà de Macià'''; [[Barcelona]], 1845 - 1919) was a Spanish writer, poet, storyteller, playwright, essayist, and columnist of Catalan descent. She was the sister of the painter [[Enric Monserdá i Vidal]] (1850-1926), and her daughter was married to the modernist architect, [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]]. She wrote in Spanish through 1875, and from then on, in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]. She was a regular participant in the [[Floral Games]], where she was awarded prizes in 1878, 1882 and 1891. In 1909, she was the first woman to chair a poetry contest. A journalist as well, she wrote for the periodical, ''La Renaixença'', and the magazine, ''Feminal''.

Times]]|date=2014-05-12|accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This is largely in response to the tendency of modern audiences to [[Time shifting|time shift]] programming ([[Digital video recorder|DVR]]) or view using [[Video on demand|on-demand]] streaming services, which has produced a steady decline in live viewership [[Audience measurement|ratings]]. 
[[Live episode]]s have long been a staple of television programming, but the shift towards event television has greatly accelerated development of new styles of "DVR-proof" programming and new methods of marketing in response to the growth of these new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kjus|first1=Yngvar|title=Event Media|url=https://www.academia.edu/9596915/Event_Media_Television_Production_Crossing_Media_Boundaries|website=academia.edu|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Networks are focusing on more live entertainment and investing into more [[Broadcasting of sports events|sports programming]] which are less attractive to DVR users, but excite and engage live viewers. 
[[Scripted television|Scripted programs]] have adopted the strategy as well, by making more frequent use of sudden, unannounced plot twists or major character deaths. 
"It's important to keep your fans engaged", [[CBS]] entertainment president [[Nina Tassler]] said. "You keep eventizing your entire season."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bauder|first1=David|title=Networks' plea to viewers: Watch now!|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/networks-plea-viewers-watch-now|location=New York |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613055358/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/networks-plea-viewers-watch-now |archivedate=2014-06-13 |publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=2014-05-19|accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Event television often makes use of interactive ways to encourage live viewer participation, such as voting for contestants and results shows,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|last1=Siegel|first1=Robert|last2=Poggi|first2=Jeanine|title=For TV Advertisers, A Hunt For Live Audiences |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/05/29/317127235/for-tv-advertisers-a-hunt-for-live-audiences |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=2014-05-29 |accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[interactive media]] such as [[mobile app]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garvin|first1=Glenn |title=TV execs crave viewers who watch two screens |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/01/24/v-print/2606079/tv-execs-crave-viewers-who-watch.html|work=[[Miami Herald]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204070221/http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/01/24/v-print/2606079/tv-execs-crave-viewers-who-watch.html |archivedate=2012-02-04 |date=2012-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[viral marketing]], or [[hashtag]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Albertazzi|editor1-first=Daniele |editor2-last=Cobley|editor2-first=Paul |title=The Media: An Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-eTbAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA523&amp;dq=%22event%20television%22&amp;pg=PA523#v=onepage&amp;q=%22event%20television%22&amp;f=false |date=September 13, 2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317865216 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slattery|first1=Laura|title=Event television goes extraterrestrial in race for ratings|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/media-and-marketing/event-television-goes-extraterrestrial-in-race-for-ratings-1.1722421|accessdate=2014-06-13|work=[[Irish Times]]|date=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Television series|Series]] and [[Television special|specials]] that have been referred to as "event television" include:
* ''[[The Day of the Doctor]]'' – The 50th anniversary special of [[Doctor Who]] which was simulcast globally in November 2013.
* ''[[The X Factor]]''
* ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]''
* ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]''
* ''[[24: Live Another Day]]''
* ''[[The Sound of Music Live!]]'' (December 2013)
* ''[[Live from Space: Lap of the Planet]]'' (March 2014)

In televisions earliest days, the phrase "event television" was used simply to describe live broadcasts covering certain ''events'' in real time, such as [[Beauty pageant|pageant]]s, sports, [[breaking news]], or awards presentations.&lt;ref name="Brown-ET"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Lester L.|title=Les Brown's Encyclopedia of Television|date=1992|publisher=[[Gale Research, Inc.]]|isbn=0-8103-8871-5|page=526|edition=3rd|chapter=Event television}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the phrase was used infrequently to describe certain 'must watch' programs which significantly altered viewer habits for a short time, drawing them to a particular channel for a night or even "emptying the streets and pubs" during their duration.&lt;ref name="bbcobit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6105578.stm|title=Quatermass creator dies, aged 84|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2006-11-01| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613055706/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6105578.stm |archivedate=2014-06-13 |accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3660">'''Grammar systems theory''' is a field of [[theoretical computer science]] that studies [[system]]s of finite collections of [[formal grammar]]s generating a [[formal language]]. Each grammar works on a string, a so-called ''sequential form'' that represents an environment. Grammar systems can thus be used as a formalization of decentralized or distributed systems of [[Intelligent agent|agents]] in [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref name="gramsysdis"&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt; be a simple [[reactive agent]] moving on the table and trying not to fall down from the table with two reactions, ''t'' for turning and ''&amp;fnof;'' for moving forward. The set of possible behaviors of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt; can then be described as [[formal language]]

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{L_A}=\{(f^mt^nf^r)^+:1\leq m\leq k; 1\leq n\leq \ell;1\leq r\leq k\},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&amp;fnof;'' can be done maximally ''k'' times and ''t'' can be done maximally ''ℓ'' times considering the dimensions of the table.&lt;ref name="kelemenjirku1996"&gt;

[[Image:Grammar system diagram.svg|thumb|450px|right|System of grammars sequentially rewriting shared string &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;]] Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G_A}&lt;/math&gt; be a formal grammar which generates language &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{L_A}&lt;/math&gt;. The behavior of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt; is then described by this grammar. Suppose the &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt; has a [[subsumption architecture]]; each component of this architecture can be then represented as a formal grammar too and the final behavior of the agent is then described by this ''system of grammars''.

The schema on the right describes such a system of grammars which shares a common string representing an environment. The shared sequential form is sequentially rewritten by each grammar, which can represent either a component or generally an agent.

If grammars communicate together and work on a shared sequential form, it is called a ''Cooperating Distributed (DC)'' grammar system. Shared sequential form is a similar concept to the blackboard approach in [[AI]],&lt;ref name="gramsysdis"/&gt; which is inspired by an idea of experts solving some problem together while they share their proposals and ideas on a shared blackboard.

Each grammar in a grammar system can also work on its own string and communicate with other grammars in a system by sending their sequential forms on request. Such a grammar system is then called a ''Parallel Communicating (PC)'' grammar system.&lt;ref name="gramsysdis"/&gt;

PC and DC are inspired by distributed AI.  If there is no communication between grammars, the system is close to the decentralized approaches in AI. These kinds of grammar systems are sometimes called ''colonies'' or ''Eco-Grammar'' systems, depending (besides others) on whether the environment is changing on its own (Eco-Grammar system) or not (colonies).&lt;ref name="gramsysdis"/&gt;

An '''informant''' (also called an '''informer''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=informer|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/informer|website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=6 June 2016|quote='''2:''' one that informs against another; ''specifically'' :  one who makes a practice especially for a financial reward of informing against others for violations of penal laws}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a person who provides privileged information about a person or organization to an agency. The term is usually used within the law enforcement world, where they are officially known as '''confidential''' or '''criminal informants''' ('''CI'''), and can often refer pejoratively to the supply of information without the consent of the other parties with the intent of malicious, personal or financial gain.&lt;ref name="lying" /&gt; However, the term is used in politics, industry and academia.&lt;ref&gt;"Pursuing strategic advantage through political means: A multivariate approach" by DA Schuler, K Rehbein, RD Cramer &amp;ndash; ''Academy of Management Journal'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Reading English for specialized purposes: Discourse analysis and the use of student informants" by A Cohen, H Glasman, PR Rosenbaum-Cohen, ''TESOL Quarterly'', 197&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal informants==
Informants are commonly found in the world of [[organized crime]]. By its very nature, organized crime involves many people who are aware of each other's guilt, in a variety of [[Law|illegal]] activities. Quite frequently, confidential informants (or criminal informants) will provide information in order to obtain lenient treatment for themselves and provide information, over an extended period of time, in return for money or for police to overlook their own criminal activities. Quite often, someone will become an informant following their arrest.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Informants are also extremely common in every-day police work, including homicide and narcotics investigations. Any citizen who provides crime related information to law enforcement by definition is an informant.&lt;ref&gt;Palmiotto, J., Micheal. ''Criminal Investigation''. 4th ed. Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, 2013. p65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] has been criticized for leniency towards [[drug lords]]&lt;ref&gt;"Kid Who Sold Crack to the President" by J Morley. ''Washington City Paper'', 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and murderers&lt;ref name="murder"&gt;"Government Corruption and the Right of Access to Courts" by UA Kim. ''Michigan Law Review'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; acting as paid informants, informants being allowed to engage in some crimes so that the potential informant can blend into the criminal environment without suspicion,&lt;ref name="murder" /&gt; and wasting billions of dollars on dishonest sources of information.&lt;ref name="lying"&gt;"The Weakest Link: The Dire Consequences of a Weak Link in the Informant Handling and Covert Operations Chain-of-Command" by M Levine. ''Law Enforcement Executive Forum'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Informants are often regarded as [[traitors]] by their former criminal associates. Whatever the nature of a group, it is likely to feel strong hostility toward any known informers, regard them as threats and inflict punishments ranging from social ostracism through physical abuse and/or death. Informers are therefore generally protected, either by being segregated while in [[prison]] or, if they are not incarcerated, relocated under a new identity.

===Informant motivation===
[[File:Program Aids - CHS Assessing.pdf|thumb|FBI Anchorage aid for assessing confidential human sources]]
Informants, and especially criminal informants, can be motivated by many reasons. Many informants are not themselves aware of all of their reasons for providing information, but nonetheless do so. Many informants provide information while under stress, duress, emotion and other life factors that can impact the accuracy or veracity of information provided.

Law enforcement officers, prosecutors, defense lawyers, judges and others should be aware of possible motivations so that they can properly approach, assess and verify informants' information.

Generally, informants' motivations can be broken down into self-interest, self-preservation and conscience.

A list of possible motivations includes:

Self-Interest:
* Financial reward&lt;ref name="Lyman, D. 2010. p264"&gt;Lyman, D., Micheal. ''Criminal Investigation: The Art and the Science''. 6th ed. Columbia College of Missouri. Pearson, 2010. p264&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pre-trial release from custody
* Withdrawal or dismissal of criminal charges
* Reduction of sentence
* Choice of location to serve sentence
* Elimination of rivals or unwanted criminal associates.
* Elimination of competitors engaged in criminal activities.
* Diversion of suspicion from their own criminal activities.
* Revenge&lt;ref name="Lyman, D. 2010. p264"/&gt;

Self-Preservation:
* Fear of harm from others.
* Threat of arrest or charges.
* Threat of incarceration.
* Desire for witness protection program.

Conscience:
* Desire to go straight
* Guilty conscience
* Genuine desire to assist law enforcement and society.&lt;ref name="Van Allen Criminal Investigation"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Bill Van|title=Criminal investigation : in search of the truth|date=2011|publisher=Pearson Canada|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-13-800011-0|page=217|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labor and social movements==
Corporations and the detective agencies that sometimes represent them have historically hired [[labor spies]] to monitor or control labor organizations and their activities.&lt;ref&gt;"Private detective agencies and labour discipline in the United States, 1855–1946" by RP Weiss. ''The Historical Journal'', 2009. Cambridge Univ Press&lt;/ref&gt; Such individuals may be professionals or recruits from the workforce. They may be willing accomplices, or may be tricked into informing on their co-workers' unionization efforts.&lt;ref&gt;"Judicial Control of Informants, Spies, Stool Pigeons, and Agent Provocateurs" by RC Donnelly &amp;ndash; ''Yale Law Journal'', 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

Paid informants have often been used by authorities within politically and socially oriented movements to weaken, destabilize and ultimately break them.&lt;ref&gt;"Thoughts on a neglected category of social movement participant: The agent provocateur and the informant" by GT Marx &amp;ndash; ''American Journal of Sociology'', 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
[[File:Confidential Human Source Policy Guide (redacted).pdf|thumb|A redacted version of the FBI policy manual concerning the use of informants.]]
Informers alert authorities regarding government officials that are corrupt. Officials may be taking [[Bribery|bribes]], or participants in a [[Money trail|money loop]] also called a [[Political corruption#Kickbacks|kickback]]. Informers in some countries receive a percentage of all monies recovered by their government.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

[[Lactantius]] described an example from [[ancient Rome]] involved the prosecution of a woman suspected to have advised a woman not to marry [[Maximinus II]]: "Neither indeed was there any accuser, until a certain [[Jew]], one charged with other offences, was induced, through hope of pardon, to give false evidence against the innocent. The equitable and vigilant magistrate conducted him out of the city under a guard, lest the populace should have stoned him... The Jew was ordered to the torture till he should speak as he had been instructed... The innocent were condemned to die.... Nor was the promise of pardon made good to the feigned adulterer, for he was fixed to a gibbet, and then he disclosed the whole secret contrivance; and with his last breath he protested to all the beholders that the women died innocent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf07.iii.v.xl.html|title=On the Deaths of the Persecutors|author=[[Lactantius]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal informant schemes have been used as cover for politically motivated intelligence offensives.&lt;ref&gt;"CIA Assets and the Rise of the Guadalajara Connection" J. Marshall &amp;ndash; ''[[Crime, Law and Social Change]]'', 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jailhouse informants==
Jailhouse informants, who report [[hearsay]] (admissions against penal interest) which they claim to have heard while the accused is in [[pretrial detention]], usually in exchange for sentence reductions or other inducements, have been the focus of particular controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2000/2000scc11/2000scc11.html scc.lexum.umontreal.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110084712/http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2000/2000scc11/2000scc11.html |date=2010-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of their use are in connection with [[Stanley Williams]], [[Cameron Todd Willingham]], [[Gerald Stano]], [[Thomas Silverstein]], [[Marshall "Eddie" Conway]], and a suspect in the disappearance of [[Etan Patz]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Terminology and slang==

The phrase "drop a dime" refers to an informant using a [[payphone]] to call the authorities to report information.

The term "stool pigeon" originates from the long-ago practice of tying a [[passenger pigeon]] to a stool. The bird would flap its wings in a futile attempt to escape. The sound of the wings flapping would attract other pigeons to the stool where they could be easily killed or captured.{{sfn|Coleman|1996|p=24}}

==Informants by country==
===Russia and Soviet Union===
A system of informants existed in [[Russian Empire]] and later adopted by the [[Soviet Union]]. In Russia such person was known as '''osvedomitel''' or donoschik (literally, ''whistleblower'') and secretly cooperated with law enforcement agencies such as [[Okhranka]] or later Soviet [[militsiya]] or [[KGB]]. Officially those informants were referred to as secret coworker ({{lang-ru|секретный сотрудник}}, sekretny sotrudnik) and often were referred by a Russian derived portmanteau '''seksot'''.

In some KGB documents has also been used a term "source of operational information" ({{lang-ru|источник оперативной информации}}, istochnik operativnoi informatsii).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/annals/sakharov/documents_frames/Sakharov_008.htm Andropov to the Central Committee.

'''Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino''', also known as '''Don Belong''' (July 7, 1864 – October 10, 1938), was a prominent [[Philippines|Filipino]] politician, writer and labor activist in the 19th and 20th centuries. He was the original founder of the [[Philippine Independent Church|Aglipayan Church]], an independent Philippine national church.  For his writings and activism with labor unions, he was called the ''"Father of Filipino Socialism"''.

As a young man, de los Reyes followed his mother's footsteps by initially turning to writing as a career; his works were part of the 1887 ''Exposicion General de las Islas Filipinas'' in Madrid.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|258}}  He later became a journalist, editor, and publisher in [[Manila]], and was imprisoned in 1897 for revolutionary activities.  He was deported to the [[Kingdom of Spain]], where he was jailed for his activities until 1898. While living and working in [[Madrid]], he was influenced by the writings of European socialists and [[Marxists]].

Returning to the Philippines in 1901, de los Reyes founded the first labor union in the country. He also was active in seeking independence from the United States. After serving in the Philippine Senate in the 1920s, he settled into private life and religious writing. de los Reyes wrote on diverse topics in history, folk-lore, language, politics, and religion.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|255}} He had a total of 27 children with three successive wives; he survived all his wives and 12 of his children.

== Early life and education ==
Isabelo de los Reyes was born to Elías de los Reyes and [[Leona Florentino]] in [[Vigan]], [[Ilocos Sur]].&lt;ref name=phgov&gt;[https://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/former_senators/isabelo_delos_reyes.htm "Isabelo de los Reyes", Senators' Profiles]&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, of mixed Spanish and Filipino descent, is recognised as the first significant female poet of the Philippines for her works in both Spanish and [[Ilokano language|Ilocano]]. de los Reyes may have been distantly related to Ventura de los Reyes, a creole merchant who was the first Philippine delegate to the Spanish Cortes through his father's side. He may also have been a "distant cousin" of [[Jose Rizal]] through a Chinese tax collector married to both Rizal's grandmother and de los Reyes' grand-aunt.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|256}}

Due to their troubled marriage, Elías entrusted his six-year-old son Isabelo to the care of Don [[Marcelino Crisólogo]], a wealthy relative&lt;ref name=Santa /&gt; who was also a writer in the vernacular. The boy was enrolled in a grammar school attached to the local seminary run by [[Augustinians]]; their harsh discipline made him a lifelong critic of friars.&lt;ref name=phgov/&gt; de los Reyes was a free spirit and chafed against seminary life. Once, he led a student strike against the friars to protest the maltreatment of students.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|257}}

In 1880 at age 16, de los Reyes went to [[Manila]] without his uncle's consent, where he finished the [[Bachelor of Arts|''Bachiller en Artes'']] at the [[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]]. After that, he studied law and [[palaeography]] at the Royal and Pontifical [[University of Santo Tomas]].

==Early career and Journalism==
While studying in the Colegio de San Juan de Letran, he supplemented his allowance by taking to journalism,&lt;ref name=phgov/&gt; [[typesetting|setting type]] for ''La Oceana Española'' as well as writing for periodicals such as ''Diario de Manila'', ''El Comercio'', ''La Revista Popular'', and ''La Opinion''. In November 1882, his work, ''La expedicion de [[Limahong|Li-Ma-Hong]] contra Filipinas'' was published in ''Diario de Manila'' and garnered him a prize.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|257}}

In 1886, de los Reyes worked as Manila correspondent for ''El Eco de Panay'', a newspaper in [[Iloilo]], but was replaced by [[Wenceslao Retana]] when his reports began to appear too liberal. His reputation as an independent-minded writer was such that in 1887, ''La Opinion'' hired him as a foil for their ultra-conservative staff writer, Camilo Millan.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|257}}

As a teenager, de los Reyes had been intrigued by the growing interest in the "new science" of ''El saber popular'' ([[folklore]]). On March 25, 1884, Jose Felipe Del Pan wrote an article in ''La Oceania Filipina'' calling readers to contribute folklore articles, inspired by interest in the subject in the peninsula. De los Reyes was urged by del Pan to contribute and gave him books on the subject pique his interest. Two months later, de los Reyes submitted his articles concerning the folklore of Ilocos, Malabon, and Zambales. In 1887, at the age of 23, del Pan compiled de los Reyes' articles and submitted them to the ''Exposición General de las Islas Filipinas'' in [[Madrid]], where he won a silver medal. These articles would eventually become one of his most important contributions to Philippine studies, ''El Folk-lore Filipino''. ''Folk-Lore'' was published in 1889 in two volumes.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|305}}

De los Reyes' interest in folklore continued. He collected materials, wrote for periodicals, and issued an open letter calling on readers to collect, publish, and organize a folklore society, which did not materialize. De los Reyes wrote ''Folk-Lore'' not just as a book for legends and fables, but eventually as "a general archive at the service of all sciences", expanding his definition of "folklore" to include "popular knowledge relevant to all sciences", including sections on religion, customs, literature, and articles on [[Diego Silang]], [[millenarian]] revolts, and local miracles of the Virgin Mary.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|306–308}}

In 1884, de los Reyes was married to Josefa Hizon Sevilla, his first wife. Sevilla was the daughter of Gregorio Sevilla, the ''capitan'' of Malabon. Shortly after, the couple started a pawnshop, which failed. They also opened a bookstore, which similarly failed because de los Reyes "refused to sell the good ones". Eventually, they were able to build a modest fortune as a commercial agent of rice, tobacco, indigo, and other products.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|258}}

During this time, de los Reyes published in rapid succession multiple works: ''Ilocandias'' (1887), ''Articulos Varios'' (1887), ''Las Islas Visayas en la epoca de la conquista'' (1889), ''Historia de Filipinas'' (1889), and the two-volume ''Historia de Ilocos'' (1890). These and other works won him a measure of recognition as a scholar.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|258}} By 1889, he was listed as a corresponding or honorary member of societies such as the ''Imperial y Real Sociedad Geografica de Vienna'', ''Academia Indo-China de Francia'', and the ''Sociedad Española de Geografica Comercial''.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|259}}

In 1889 he founded ''El Ilocano'', said to be the first newspaper written solely in a Philippine [[vernacular]].&lt;ref name="nhcp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nhcp.gov.ph/isabelo-de-los-reyes/ |title=Isabelo de los Reyes - National Historical Commission of the Philippines |date=2012-09-06 |website=National Historical Commission of the Philippines |language=en-US |access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; de los Reyes declared that he founded ''El Ilocano'' to "serve [our] beloved ''pueblo'' Ilocos by contributing to the enlightenment of her children, defending her interests." ''El Iloco'' lasted for seven years.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|259}} By 1893, de los Reyes was able to acquire his own printing press, which he set up in the basement of his house in Binondo and called ''Imprenta de Isabelo de los Reyes''. Proud of his provincial origins, he boasted that the press parts were fabricated by Vigan artisans and he hired Ilocanos as printshop personnel.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|259}}

Aside from ''El Ilocano'', de los Reyes also published the periodicals ''La Lectura Popular'' (1890-1892), a Tagalog biweekly joint venture with Jose de Jesus, and ''El Minicipio Filipino'' (1894), a short-lived Spanish-Tagalog magazine devoted to colonial jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|259}}

==Imprisonment and exile==
As the [[Philippine Revolution]] of 1896 began, multiple personalities suspected of being a part of it were arrested by the Spanish government. One of these people was de los Reyes, who at the time, openly advocated reforms, and if necessary, "take up arms against the tyrants".&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|263}} de los Reyes was arrested on February 12, 1897, and taken to [[Bilibid Prison]].

De los Reyes was charged with membership in ''[[La Liga Filipina]]'', the political organization organized by Rizal, as well as being knowledgeable of the [[Katipunan]], however, he denied all of this. de los Reyes, however, sold types to [[Emilio Jacinto]] for the Katipunan's printing press, and he later claimed that he made a financial contribution to the ''Liga''. de los Reyes also claimed that while he declined when [[Julio Nakpil]] asked him to join the ''Liga'', he offered to give Nakpil a thousand pesos to purchase revolvers from someone on board the steamer ''Salvadora'', and that he offered his services as a soldier.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|264–265}}

In Bilibid, de los Reyes wrote his ''Memorial sobre la revolution'', which initially was the ''Memoria de agravios de los Filipinos''. The document was addressed to the Governor-General, [[Fernando Primo de Rivera]] and was meant to gain sympathy for the rebels.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|265}} His ''Memoria'' pointed out that the friars sowed the seeds of colonial revolt in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="nhcp"/&gt; de los Reyes' wife, Josefa, died while he was in prison.

de los Reyes was pardoned on May 17, the King's birthday, but was arrested again shortly after complaining about the injustice of his arrest and reminding the governor-general of the ''Memoria'' that he sent.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|265–266}} de los Reyes was deported aboard the ''SS Alicante'' in June 1897, and was interred at the [[Montjuïc Castle]] in [[Barcelona]] for six months, before being released as part of the terms of the [[Pact of Biak-na-Bato]].&lt;ref name="nhcp"/&gt;

===Exile in Spain===
During his time in Montjuïc, de los Reyes was acquainted with anarchists, syndicalists, and other extremists, who shaped him. A sympathetic guard supplied him with anarchist books and newspapers. de los Reyes also met Ramon Sempau, a Spanish poet-journalist who left an impression in de los Reyes.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|268}}

After his release in 1898, de los Reyes was barred from leaving Spain and became a drifter in Barcelona.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|268}} It was during this time that he came to know radicals such as [[Francisco Ferrer i Guardia|Francisco Ferrer]], [[Alejandro Lerroux]], and others.&lt;ref name="Saulo"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/969406494 |title=Communism in the Philippines : An Introduction |last=Saulo |first=Alfredo |date=2002 |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press |isbn=9715504035 |edition= Enlarged |location=Manila, Philippines |oclc=969406494}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} He began reading the works of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]], and other socialist thinkers. He also joined protest actions and was imprisoned for a short time by police authorities. He was released and was forced to relocate from Barcelona to Madrid.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|269}}

During his time in Madrid, he was taken in by Doña Justa Jugo Vidal and met with other Filipinos to discuss the Philippine situation. He also met Señorita Maria Angeles Lopez Montero and married her on Christmas Eve in 1898.&lt;ref name="nhcp"/&gt; He was also commissioned to translate the [[Bible]] to [[Ilocano language|Iloko]]. de los Reyes later said that this work was "one way by which [he] could contribute to the liberalization of dogmatic religion."&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|270}}

At the onset of the [[Spanish–American War]], de los Reyes was employed as Counselor of the [[Ministry of Overseas (Spain)|Ministry of the Colonies]] (''Consejero del Ministerio de Ultramar''), which he held until 1901.&lt;ref name=Santa /&gt; In this capacity, de los Reyes helped rally Filipino support against the Americans, thinking that this would create conditions favorable to the Philippines. He believed that once the Americans were repelled, they would be granted autonomy, and should Spain renege, then the already armed Filipinos could take matters to their own hands. He had received assurances from the governor-general [[Basilio Augustin]] regarding autonomy, and together with other Filipinos in Spain, offered to return to the Philippines to organize militias to fight the Americans.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|270–271}}

De los Reyes wrote anti-American articles for ''La Correspondencia de Epaña'' and other papers.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|271}} On November 10, 1898, as Spain's loss of the Philippines became imminent, he and [[Dominador Gomez]] published ''Filipinas ante Europa''
, which had the editorial logo: ''Contra Norte-America, no; contra el imperialismo, sí, hasta la muerte!'' (Against the Americans, no; against Imperialism, yes, till death!) It ran for 86 issues between October 25, 1899 and June 10, 1901.  After closing, it briefly reappeared as ''El Defensor de Filipinas'', which ran monthly from July 1 to October 1, 1901.&lt;ref name="Santa"/&gt;

After Aguinaldo's surrender, de los Reyes was repatriated to Manila on July 1, 1901. Given guarantees by the American consul in Barcelona that he will in no way molested upon his arrival in the Philippines, he left Spain on September 14 aboard the steamer ''Montevideo''. De los Reyes arrived in Manila on October 15, 1901.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|274}}

==Return to the Philippines==
On his return, de los Reyes quickly set about to launching several initiatives that he already had in mind while still in Spain. On October 25, 1901, ten days after he returned to Manila, he south authority from the Philippine Commission to publish his ''Defensor de Filipinas'', which was refused. On October 31, he appeared before the Commission, with [[Pedro Paterno]] and [[Pascual H. Poblete]] to seek permission to form a political party, the ''Partido Nacionalista'', which was also denied. He wanted to push for a party that would push for independence within the framework of US occupation. Eventually, Poblete managed to form the [[Nacionalista Party]], which de los Reyes joined. He was eventually named its leader.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|275–276}}

In tandem with party building, de los Reyes also set about organizing a wokers' movement in the Philippines. In 1902, [[Hermenegildo Cruz]] and other members of the Carmelo and Bauermann publishing house approached de los Reyes to seek advice in forming a cooperative store for rice and other staples.&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/756771087 |title=Komunista : the genesis of the Philippine Communist Party, 1902–1935 |last=Richardson |first=Jim |date=2011 |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press |isbn=9789715506267 |location=Quezon City |oclc=756771087}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} The ''Union Democratica de Litografos, Impresores, Encuadernadores y Otros Obreros'' was thus formed on February 2, 1902, which came to be known as the ''[[Union Obrera Democratica]]''. De los Reyes was its first president.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|278}}

De los Reyes took home with him works by socialists such as [[Karl Marx]], Proudhon, Bakunin, and [[Errico Malatesta]].&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;{{rp|15}} Malatesta's ''Propaganda socialista fra contadini'' was particularly familiar to union organizers.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|278}} The UOD was the first labor federation in the Philippines, soon being joined by neighborhood associations from [[Cavite]], [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]], [[Santa Cruz, Manila|Santa Cruz]] and [[Sampaloc, Manila|Sampaloc]]; company guilds from the San Miguel Brewery and L.R. Yangco Shipping Company; and trade associations of printers, ''tabaqueros'', tailors, sculptors, seamen, and cooks. At its peak in 1903, the UOD's membership was estimated at around twenty thousand.&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;{{rp|14}}

As conceived by de los Reyes, the UOD's aim was to "achieve the longed-for alliance between capital and labor" by bringing together workers and employers in a spirit of friendship, mutual respect, and recognized interdependence. de los Reyes also wished to enlighten the masses as a prerequisite to modern nationhood. In this end, he organized ''veladas instructivo-recreativas'' as a way to "improve themselves and learn the life of cultured peoples". He had observed that workers in Europe had clubs and cafes where they could read newspapers and discuss current events, and wished to emulate that in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;{{rp|16–17}} de los Reyes also published the UOD's official organ, ''La Redencion del Obrero''.&lt;ref name="Santa"/&gt;

De los Reyes spent this time mediating in labor disputes and other union-organizing activities. The press at this time called him a "Malay Lerroux" and compared him to Spanish labor leader [[Pablo Iglesias Posse|Pablo Iglesias]]. On August 16, 1902, he was arrested on the trumped-up charge that he gave orders to assassinate scabs in a strike at the Commercial Tobacco Factory.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|279}} De los Reyes was eventually released on January 30, 1903 by Governor [[William Howard Taft]], stating that the statute "was not in line with current American thinking on the subject".&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;{{rp|19}} While in prison, de los Reyes tendered his resignation from the UOD on September 14 and was replaced by Dominador Gomez.

After resigning from the UOD, de los Reyes tried to patch up internal rivalries within the organization but ultimately failed. The UOD was dissolved and in its place was the ''[[Union del Trabajo de Filipinas]]'', headed by writer [[Lope K. Santos]].&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;{{rp|21}} After this, de los Reyes focused on his ''Redencion del Obrero'' while contributing to papers like ''El Comercio'', ''Grito del Pueblo'', and others. He took up causes such as labor rights, universal suffrage, the exclusion of Chinese immigrant labor, and parity of Filipinos and Americans in the civil service.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|281}}

==Japan, Hong Kong and Spain==
De los Reyes left the Philippines in February 1903 for a vacation, going to [[Japan]] and [[Hong Kong]]. He also sought to continue his translation of the bible and to oversee its printing in [[Yokohama]], although others suggest that his true purpose was to meet with [[Artemio Ricarte]], who was in exile at the time.&lt;ref name="Santa"/&gt; Details are unclear whether de los Reyes met with Ricarte in Yokohama&lt;ref name="nhcp"/&gt; or in Hong Kong,&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|284}} although it was certain that a meeting took place between the two in Manila. De los Reyes relayed to him the Philippine situation&lt;ref name="Santa"/&gt; and tried to dissuade him from resuming hostilities with the US.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|284}}

In 1905, de los Reyes once again left for Spain where he stayed until 1909. During this time he worked as a juror in Barcelona until 1908.&lt;ref name="Santa"/&gt; He also went back to mend relations with his wife, María Ángeles López Montero, who repeatedly urged him to stay away from politics. During his stay in Spain, he wrote texts such as ''Gregio Aglipay y otros prelados de la Iglesia Filipina Independiente'' (1906) and ''Biblia Filipina''. He also published ''La Religion Antigua de Filipinas'' (1909).&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|285}}

De los Reyes returned to Manila on April 3, 1909 with Lopez, however she could not adjust to the climate. After a few months, he brought her to [[Tokyo]] to recuperate. Lopez died on February 10, 1910 while giving birth to twin daughters.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|285}}

==Later Years and death==
In 1912 at the age of 48, de los Reyes was elected a councilor of the [[City of Manila]], and began his political career. Winning re-election, he served as councilor until 1919.&lt;ref name="nhcp"/&gt; He ran as a candidate for the labor-based group called the ''Union Reformista''. As councilor, he worked on social welfare ordinances, pushed for "Filipinization" of the civil service, and filed resolutions urging immediate and absolute independence of the Philippines.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|286}}

De los Reyes also met and married María Lim, a mestiza de sangley from Tondo. They married in the independent Aglipayan Church, which de los Reyes had helped found. She would eventually die in childbirth in 1923.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|286}} As she was dying, she asked de los Reyes that they be married in the Catholic rite, to which he agreed.&lt;ref name="Santa"/&gt;

Beginning his campaign for the senate in 1922, in 1923, de los Reyes won a Senate seat in an election against [[Elpidio Quirino]] to represent the Ilocos region. As senator, he brokered projects, appointments, and other forms of patronage for his constituents. He was known for crying out "Enough of this nonsense!" whenever he was exasperated with debates on the Senate floor.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|286}}

De los Reyes retired from politics after a stroke left him paralyzed and bedridden on June 5, 1929. He devoted his time to compiling Aglipayan texts and largely slipped out of public notice. His last foray into politics was when he ran in the [[Philippine presidential election, 1935|1935 elections]], losing badly.

De los Reyes died on October 10, 1938 in a Manila hospital. A legal battle between his children regarding his custody ensued during the last years of his life. De los Reyes executed a document of retraction from his Aglipayan faith in 1936, although this was contested by other family members. His body was initially interred at the [[Manila North Cemetery]] before being transferred to the [[Iglesia Filipina Independiente National Cathedral]] in 1944.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|288}}

==The Philippine Independent Church==
De los Reyes was involved with the secular Filipino clergy as early as 1899, when he became a part of negotiations with the [[Holy See]].&lt;ref name="nhcp"/&gt; On January 22, 1899, de los Reyes, representing the "Committee of Paris", visited the [[Papal Nuncio]] [[Giuseppe Francica-Nava de Bontifè]] in Madrid to convey the Aguinaldo government's desire for the Holy See to send a delegate to look into conditions in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|273}} de los Reyes wrote in ''Filipinas Ante Europa'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Enough of Rome! Let us now form without vacillation our own congrations, a Filipino Church, conserving all that is good in the Roman Church and eliminating all the deceptions which the diabolical astuteness of the cunning Romanists had introduced to corrupt the moral purity and sacredness of the doctrines of Christ...&lt;ref name="Agoncillo"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29915943 |title=History of the Filipino people |last=Agoncillo |first=Teodoro |date=1990 |publisher=Garotech Pub |isbn=9718711066 |edition= 8th|location=Quezon City [Philippines] |oclc=29915943}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|236–237}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On his return to the Philippines in 1901, de los Reyes campaigned for the establishment of a Filipino Church. On August 3, 1902, with the help of [[Pascual H. Poblete]] and members of the UOD, the ''[[Iglesia Filipina Independiente]]'' was formed, with [[Gregorio Aglipay]] as its head.&lt;ref name="Agoncillo"/&gt;{{rp|237}} At the time, Aglipay was in talks with the Protestants&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|281–282}} and the Jesuits&lt;ref name="Agoncillo"/&gt;{{rp|238}} to prevent a schism, though neither of these events bore fruit. Aglipay initially dissociated himself from the schism, before realizing the futility of staying outside it. In September 1902, he accepted the position of ''Obispo Maximo'' and consecrated bishops for the new church.&lt;ref name="Agoncillo"/&gt;{{rp|242}}

De los Reyes traveled all over the country to rally people to the new church. He also directed the church publications ''Boletin de la Iglesia Filipina Independiente'' and ''La Iglesia Filipina Independente: Revista Catolica''. He also turned his residence into a temporary seminary.&lt;ref name="Mojares"/&gt;{{rp|283}} In 1929, de los Reyes was appointed an honorary bishop, a position he held until his death. In this capacity, he wrote multiple devotional and doctrinal texts such as the  ''Biblia Filipina'', ''Oficio Divino'', ''Catequesis'', ''Plegarias'', ''Genesis Cientifico y Moderno'' and the ''Calendario Aglipayano''.&lt;ref name="Santa"/&gt;

==Marriage and family==
In 1884, at the age of 20, de los Reyes married Josefa Sevilla, the daughter of Gregorio Sevilla, the ''capitan'' of [[Malabon]]. He and his wife had ten children.&lt;ref name="Mojares"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/76895524 |title=Brains of the nation : Pedro Paterno, T.H.

In late December 1898, he married María Ángeles López Montero (the daughter of a retired Spanish infantry colonel) in [[Madrid]], also in a Catholic ceremony. She died in 1910 [[maternal mortality|while giving birth]] to their ninth child.&lt;ref name="Santa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santa.gov.ph/ilocossur/heroisabelo.html |title=ISABELO DE LOS REYES  Father of the Philippine Socialism |last=Ilocos Sur |first=Province of |date=Jan 16, 2014 |website=archive.org |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060504055859/http://www.santa.gov.ph/ilocossur/heroisabelo.html |archive-date=May 4, 2006 |access-date=2017-12-28 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

De los Reyes' last marriage in 1912 was to the 18-year-old María Lim, a ''[[Mestizo de sangley|mestiza de sangley]]'' from [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]]. They married in the independent Aglipayan Church, which de los Reyes had helped found. They also had several children before María also died in childbirth in 1923. Before her death, she had asked that they be married according to the Catholic rite, to which de los Reyes agreed.

With his own family spanning Catholic and Aglipayan traditions, de los Reyes was tolerant of religious diversity among his children. Isabelo de los Reyes Jr., a son from his second marriage, was ordained an Aglipayan priest and later became ''[[Obispo Maximo|Obispo Máximo IV]]'' of the church. His daughters Ángeles, Elisa, and Elvira from his second marriage, along with Crescencia from his third marriage, became professed nuns in the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Santa" /&gt;

De los Reyes married thrice, siring a total of 27 children.&lt;ref name="Santa" /&gt; He survived all his wives and twelve of his children.

'''Joan Fuster i Ortells''' ({{IPA-ca|ʒuˈam fusˈteɾ j oɾˈteʎs|va}}; 23 November 1922 – 21 June 1992) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] writer. He is considered a major writer in [[Catalan language]],{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} and his work contributed to reinvigorate left-wing, pro-Catalan [[Valencian nationalism|nationalism in Valencia]] during the [[Spanish transition to democracy]]. In his influential political essay [[Nosaltres, els valencians]] (1962) he coined the term [[Països Catalans|Països Catalans (Catalan Countries)]] to refer to the Catalan-speaking territories, for which he claimed independent statehood from Spain.

== Life and works ==
He was born in the village of [[Sueca (city)|Sueca]] near [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], [[Spain]], in a relatively prosperous middle-class family. Both his parents were pious [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Carlist]]s. His father was a renowned local sculptor of mostly religious sculptures. In 1941 he became a member of the fascist organization [[Falange]]; however, he later abjured this affiliation.&lt;ref name="uv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uv.es/~catedra/val/fuster1.htm|title=Biography of Joan Fuster. University of Valencia|publisher=University of Valencia|accessdate=2013-08-01|language=ca|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504130354/http://www.uv.es/~catedra/val/fuster1.htm|archivedate=2009-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947 Fuster graduated with a degree in law and he received a doctoral degree in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] [[philology]] in 1985. From 1946 to 1956 he co-directed the magazine ''Verb'' with [[José Albi]]. Of his first books, all of which are poetry, ''Escrit per al silenci'' ("Written for the Silence") (1954) stands out. In 1952 he began his collaborations with the press of ''[[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]]'' in ''[[Levante, Spain|Levante]]'': this would be one of his more prominent facets. He would continue with it in ''Destino'' and in ''[[La Vanguardia]]''.

With ''El descrèdit de la Realitat'' ("The Discredit of Reality") (1955) he started a notable career as an [[essayist]] of vast thematic breadth and whose incisive style was noted for its precise use of adjectives.&lt;ref name="enciclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pen-club"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visat.cat/traduccions_literatura_catalana/fitxa-autor.php?id_autor=3&amp;id_genere=3&amp;nom_genere=Poetry&amp;idioma=eng|title=Facts about Joan Fuster|publisher=Catalan branch of the [[PEN Club]] Magazine|accessdate=2010-06-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622223138/http://www.visat.cat/traduccions_literatura_catalana/fitxa-autor.php?id_autor=3|archivedate=2010-06-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another aspect of his work was his erudition and concern with the craft of storytelling and he worked greatly to maintain a literary reviewal he pushed forward in anthologies. His dedication to Valencian themes culminated in 1962 with the publication of what remained as his most known work: ''[[Nosaltres els valencians]]'' ("We, the Valencians"). This book, together with ''Qüestió de Noms'' ("Matter of Names") and ''El País Valenciano'' ("The Valencian Country"), are basic books on the history, culture and national identity problem of the Valencian Community from a [[Catalan nationalism|Catalanist]] point of view.

He went on with this subject matter with the release of ''Raimon'' (1964), ''Combustible per a falles'' ("Combustible for Falles") (1967) and ''Ara o Mai'' ("Now or Never") (1981), among others. These, parts of his numerous studies and erudite historical and biographical articles, have been collected in the I and III tomes of the ''Obres completes'' ("Complete Works"). The ''Diari'' ("Day-to-Day Works") (1952–1960) occupy the second volume.

Within the realm of essay writing, he published ''Figures del temps'' ("Figures of Times"), Yxart award (1957), ''Judicis Finals'' ("Final Judgments") (1960), ''Diccionari per a ociosos'' ("Dictionary for Idlers") (1964), ''Causar-se d'esperar'' ("Causing Oneself to Wait") (1965), ''L'home, mesura de totes les coses'' ("The Man, Measure of All Things") (1967), and others—always within the tradition moral root of classical [[humanism]], close in spirit to the [[moral philosopher|moralists]] and French reformers (from [[Montaigne]] to the [[encyclopedists]]), as a critic and skeptic noted for his acid humor. Within his works on history, criticism and literary production, he published ''La Poesia Catalana'' ("Catalan Poetry") (1956), ''Poetes, Moriscos i Capellans'' ("Poets, Moorish and Cures") (1962), ''Heretgies, Revoltes i Sermons'' ("Heresies, Revolts and Sermons") (1968) and ''Literatura Catalana Contemporània'' ("Contemporary Catalan Literature") (1972), in addition to three extensive prologues for the works of [[Joan Salvat-Papasseit]] (1962), [[Salvador Espriu]] (1963) and [[Josep Pla]] (1966), joined together in ''Contra el Noucentisme'' ("Against Noucentisme") (1978).

In 1987 he collected his poetry into ''Set llibres de versos'' ("Seven Books of Verses"). The studies joined together in ''Llibres i problemes del Renaixentisme'' ("Books and problems of the Renaissance") (1989) are the fruit of the research carried out in his last few years. In 1994 the works ''Fuster Inèdit'' ("Unpublished Fuster") and ''Fuster Sabàtic'' ("Sabbatical Fuster") were edited.

== Importance ==

Despite having written also a number of fiction pieces, he is best known for his [[essay]]s, especially the political ones. His most influential work by far was the book ''[[Nosaltres els valencians]]'' ("We, the Valencians") (1962), whereas other titles such as ''Qüestió de Noms'' ("Matter of Names") and ''Diccionari per a Ociosos'' ("Dictionary for Idlers") (1963) are well known in the [[Catalan nationalism]]. He became the intellectual leader of [[Valencian nationalism]] by the end of the 20th century, and was central in proposing the ''[[Països Catalans]]'' concept, which advocated for unity within Catalan culture as proposed by Catalan nationalists. In these books Fuster asserted that it was necessary to strengthen Valencia's relationships with the other Catalan speaking territories for there to be any chance of defending the autonomous culture of Valencia. In this way he sought to bring a Catalan-based cultural community into existence.

In this sense, Fuster is, for some, the most remarkable political essayist in Catalan of the generations that appeared after the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name="enciclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0028550|title=Catalan Encyclopedia entry|publisher=Enciclopèdia Catalana|accessdate=2010-06-07|language=ca|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219161516/http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0028550|archivedate=2009-02-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acknowledgement ==

He received the ''[[Premi d'Honor de les Lletres Catalanes]]'' ("Catalan Letters Award") (1975) and also, in the year 1983, the ''Medalla d’Or de la Generalitat de Catalunya'' ("Gold Medal of Catalonia's Generality"). In 1984 he was named doctor [[honoris causa]] by the [[University of Barcelona]] and by the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]]. In 1986 he was appointed as professor of literature in the [[University of Valencia]].

'''Juǀʼhoan''' (also rendered Zhuǀʼhõasi, Dzuǀʼoasi, Zû-ǀhoa, JuǀʼHoansi), or '''Southeastern ǃXuun''' (Southeastern Ju), is the southern variety of the [[!Kung language|!Kung]] [[dialect continuum]], spoken in northeastern [[Namibia]] and the Northwest District of [[Botswana]]. Four regional (sub)dialects are distinguished: Epukiro, Tsumkwe, Rundu, and Omatako, with Tsumkwe being the best described; [[ǂKxʼauǁʼein]] may be another.

* /a/ is realized as [ə] before /i/.
* The diphthong /oa/ may be realized as [wa].

Juǀʼhoan has four tones and five vowel qualities, which may be [[nasal vowel|nasalized]], [[glottalization|glottalized]], [[breathy voice|murmured]], or combinations of these, and most of these possibilities occur both long and short. The qualities {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} may also be [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] and [[Strident vowel|strident]] (epiglottalized). Thus, there are a good 30 vowel phonemes, perhaps more, depending on one's analysis. There are, in addition, many vowel sequences and [[diphthong]]s.

=== Consonants ===
Juǀʼhoan has an unusually large number of consonants, even for a !Kung language. The following occur at the beginnings of roots. For brevity, only the alveolar clicks are listed with the other consonants; the complete set of clicks is found below.

Tenuis and modally voiced consonants (blue) may occur with any vowel quality. However, other consonants (grey, transcribed with a superscript diacritic to their right) do not occur in the same root as murmured, glottalized, or epiglottalized vowels.

The voiced aspirated and ejective consonants, both pulmonic and clicks, contain a voiceless interval, which Miller (2003) attributes to a larger glottal opening than is found in Hindustani breathy-voiced consonants. Phonetically, however, they are voice contours, starting out voiced but becoming voiceless for the aspiration or ejection.&lt;ref&gt;{{SOWL|63, 80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phonemic status of {{IPA|[ʔ], [dz]}} and {{IPA|[dʒ]}} is uncertain. {{IPA|[ʔ]}} may be epenthetic before vowel-initial words; alternatively, it may be that no word may begin with a vowel. {{IPA|/mʱ/}} occurs only in a single morpheme, the plural diminutive enclitic {{IPA|/mʱi/}}. {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} (not shown) only occur in loan words, and some accounts posit a {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}. Labials ({{IPA|/p, pʰ, b, bʱ, m/}}) are very rare initially, though common between vowels. Velar stops (oral and nasal) are rare initially and very rare medially.

The consonants listed as epiglottalized, following Miller-Ockhuizen (2003), have uvular frication and glottalization; they are similar to consonants in [[Nǀu language|Nǀu]] described as uvular ejective by Miller et al. (2009).

Only a small set of consonants occur between vowels within roots. These are:

|-align=center
| || || || χ || ɦ
|}

Medial {{IPA|[β̞, ɾ, m, n]}} (green) are very common; {{IPA|[ɣ, ŋ]}} are rare, and the other medial consonants occur in only a very few roots, many of them loans. {{IPA|[β̞, ɾ, ɣ]}} are generally analyzed as allophones of {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ/}}. However, {{IPA|[ɾ]}} especially may correspond to multiple root-initial consonants.

Juǀʼhoan has 48 click consonants. There are four click "types": dental, lateral, alveolar, and palatal, each of which found in twelve series or "accompaniments" (combinations of manner, phonation, and contour). These are perfectly normal consonants in Juǀʼhoan, and indeed are preferred over non-clicks in word-initial position.

As above, tenuis and modally voiced consonants (blue) may occur with any vowel quality. However, other consonants (grey, transcribed with a superscript diacritic to their right) do not occur in the same root as murmured, glottalized, or epiglottalized vowels.

Glottalized clicks occur almost exclusively before nasal vowels. This may indicate that these clicks are nasalized {{IPA|[ᵑǃˀ]}}, etc., as is the case in most if not all other languages with glottalized clicks. The nasalization would not be audible during the click itself due to the glottalization, which would prevent any nasal airflow, but the velum would be lowered, potentially nasalizing adjacent vowels.

The 'uvularized' clicks are actually [[linguo-pulmonic]] [[contour (linguistics)|contour]]s, {{IPA|[ǃ͡qχ]}} and {{IPA|[ᶢǃ͡ɢʁ]}}, etc. The 'epiglottalized' clicks are [[homorganic|heterorganic]] affricates, and equivalent to [[linguo-glottalic consonant]]s transcribed {{IPA|[ǃ͡kxʼ]}} and {{IPA|[ᶢǃ͡kxʼ]}}, etc., in other languages (Miller 2011).

See [[Ekoka !Kung]] for a related variety with a somewhat larger click inventory.

==Orthography==
In the 1960s the South African Department of Education set about establishing official orthographies for the languages of [[Southwest Africa]] (Namibia). Jan Snyman was selected to develop an orthography for the then-unwritten Juǀʼhoasi, which was accepted in 1969. In this orthography, the name of the language is spelled Žuǀʼhõasi. A slightly modified form (Snyman 1975) is shown below.

In the 1980s the [[Bible Society]] of South Africa requested a new orthography, one that used only letters of the Latin alphabet, avoided diacritics as much as possible, and conformed as much as possible to the conventions of [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]. This second orthography was accepted in 1987, in which the language is spelled Zjuc'hôa.

A third orthography was developed by the Ju|wa Bushman Development Foundation in 1994. The three are compared with the IPA below. Tone is evidently unmarked:

The 1994 orthography also has ''ih, eh, ah, oh, uh'' for breathy (murmured) vowels, and ''ihn, ahn, ohn, uhn'' for breathy nasal vowels. However, Snyman maintains that these are positional variants of low-tone vowels, and not needed in an orthography (at least, not if tone were marked).

==Grammar==
Source: Dickens (2009).

Juǀ'hoan is basically isolating, being a [[zero-marking]] language in both clauses and noun phrases. The [[Constituent order|Word order]] is SOV. 

===Nouns and pronouns===
Nouns are grouped into noun classes based on animacy and species, with each class having a pronoun-set. The plural is formed by the suffixing of '''-si''' or '''-sín''' or by no change, '''-Ø'''. Many nouns have irregular plurals, such as ''jù'' (''person'', plural ''jú'').

For example, the noun ''gǂhòà'', "dog", belongs to class 2, and may be referred to with the pronoun ''ha'', whereas ''gǀúí'', "forest", belongs to class 5, which has ''ká'' as its corresponding pronoun. 

The noun classes and their pronoun-sets are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
! Class
! General
! Possessed 
! Deictic 
! Example
|-
! 1
| ha (sg); sá (dual); hì, sì (pl)
| mà (sg); hìsì (pl)
| ǁʼàhaà (sg); ǁʼàsà (dual); ǁʼàsìsà, ǁʼàhìsà (pl)
| jù "person" 
|-
! 2
| ha (sg); hì (pl)
| mà (sg); hìsì (pl)
| ǁʼàhaà (sg); ǁʼàhìsà (pl)
| gǂhòà "dog"
|-
! 3
| ha (sg &amp; pl)
| mà (sg); màsì (pl)
| ǁʼàhaà (sg &amp; pl)
| ǁxòè "meteor" 
|-
! 4
| hì (sg &amp; pl)
| hì (sg); hìsì (pl)
| ǁʼàhìà (sg); ǁʼàhìsà (pl)
| gǁùú, "meteor"
|-
! 5
| ká (sg &amp; pl)
| gá (sg); gásì (pl)
| ǁʼàkáà (sg); ǁʼàkásà (pl)
| gǀúí "forest"
|}


====Pronouns====
Personal and demonstrative pronouns are:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|-
| || Singular || Dual incl. || Dual excl. || Plural incl. || Plural excl.
|-
| 1st || mí || mtsá || ètsá || m, m!á || è, è!á
|}

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|-
| || Singular || Dual || Plural 
|-
| 2nd || à; há (hort.) || ìtsá || ì, ì!á
|-
| 3rd || ha (n1-3), hì (n4), ká (n5) || sá (n1) || hì (n1-2), sì (n1)
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Common words and phrases==

K. Balakrishnan is best remembered as the editor and publisher of Kaumudi weekly, which was widely popular in the southern parts of the present Kerala state. A unique feature in the weekly, 'pathradhiparodu chodikkuka' (Ask the editor) in which readers can ask the editor about anything under the sky (but not a quiz session) was widely popular. Unfortunately, no information about the weekly, which was published during 1950s and '60s, s now found  in Wikipedia

==Origins in the classical texts==
The phrase's first appearance is already in the [[Mishnah]]:

{{quote
|text="The following may be recited in any language: The Torah-portion of '[[Ordeal of the bitter water|Sotah]]', the confession made at the presentation of the [[Tithes in Judaism|tithe]], the '[[Shema Yisrael|Shema]]', and the '[[Jewish prayer|Prayer]]' … 
|sign= 
}}
{{quote
|text=The following are recited in the Holy Tongue: The declaration made at the '[[First Fruits]]', the formula of '[[Halizah]]', the blessings and curses, the [[Priestly Blessing|benediction of the priests]] …"

|sign= Mishnah, Tractate [[Sotah (Talmud)|Tractate Sotah]] 7:1-2&lt;ref name=Sota1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sota2/&gt; ([[Talmud]], Sotah 32a)
}}

In its narrow sense, ''Lashon Hakodesh'' refers not to the Hebrew language in its entirety, but rather to the [[Biblical Hebrew]] only. In its broader sense, it was used for combining Hebrew and Talmudic-[[Aramaic]] within the [[Rabbinic Hebrew]], which served the purpose of writing the Jewish classical texts of the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Early modern period]].

The exact meaning of the phrase "''Lashon Hakodesh''" becomes clear due to its contrary term. In the Mishnah and the [[Gemara]] the term was aimed to take out the foreign languages that were commonly spoken among the Jewish communities:

{{quote
|text="For Rabbi said: Why use the Syrian language in the land of Israel? Either use the Holy Tongue or Greek! And R. Joseph said: Why use the Syrian language in Babylon? Either use the Holy Tongue or Persian!"
|sign= Talmud, Tractate Sotah, 49b
}}

{{quote
|text="Rabbi Hanina said: Because language [of Babylonia] is akin to the Lashon Hakodesh"
|sign= [[Talmud]] [[Pesachim (Talmud)|Tractate Pesachim]], 87b
}}

The [[Rishonim]] sages perceived only Biblical Hebrew, and not the [[Mishnaic Hebrew]], as "''Lashon Hakodesh''". In Yiddish, the term "''Loshn Koydesh''" serves to describe its own [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]-Aramaic component, as opposed to words originating from [[German language|German]] or [[Slavic languages]]. In some Jewish [[Haredi]] denominations, the term is meant to describe old Hebrew as opposed to Modern Israeli Hebrew, and few extreme Haredi denominations even try to avoid using renewed words since the [[Revival of the Hebrew language]].

Jewish philosophers have offered various reasonings for Hebrew being the "Sacred Language".

[[Maimonides]], in his book ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' (written in a [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic language]]), reasoned that the preference of the Hebrew language is based upon its internal characteristics:

{{quote
|text=" I have also a reason and cause for calling our language the holy language-do not think it is exaggeration or error on my part, it is perfectly correct—the Hebrew language has no special name for the organ of generation in females or in males, nor for the act of generation itself, nor for semen, nor for secretion. The Hebrew has no original expressions for these things, and only describes them in figurative language and by way of hints, as if to indicate thereby that these things should not be mentioned, and should therefore have no names; we ought to be silent about them, and when we are compelled to mention them, we must manage to employ for that purpose some suitable expressions, although these are generally used in a different sense."
|sign= The Guide for the Perplexed &lt;ref&gt;M. Friedlander (1904). ''[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Guide_for_the_Perplexed_(Friedlander)/Part_III/Chapters]''  The Guide for the Perplexed (Friedlander), Part III, Chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt; 
}}

[[Nahmanides]] disagrees with Maimonides' reasoning, and provides his own reasoning, based on the way the Hebrew was being used:

{{quote
|text="As I see it, the reason for the Rabbis calling the language of the Torah the Holy Tongue is that the words of the Torah and of the prophecies and all sacred utterances were all spoken in that language; it is the language that the Holy One, blessed be He, speaks with His prophets and with His people, saying, "I am ...," "Thou shalt not have ..." and the remaining commandments and prophecies; it is the language by which He is called in His sacred names... and in which He created His universe, gave names to heaven and earth and all therein, giving his angels and his host names — Michael, Gabriel, etc. — all in that language, and in that language naming the saintly people in the Land, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Solomon."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2952">{{Advert|date=July 2016}}The '''McGuire Programme''' is a stammering treatment programme/course run by [[stuttering|people who stammer]] which teaches the use of [[costal breathing]] (also known as diaphragmatic breathing), assertive self acceptance as a person who stammers, non avoidance methods and sports psychology. All methods are taught to control stammering with the aim being controlled speech and not fluency. There is no cure for stammering and the McGuire Programme does not claim to be a cure, instead offering a viable therapy option. However many stammerers that have had poor results with conventional speech therapy through childhood and adulthood, report significantly more success. As with all approaches there will be a distribution of outcomes. The McGuire Programme genuinely attempts to measure success rates across regions, and results in the range 65-85% are  typical according to their criteria.  Stammering is however notoriously difficult to measure, especially where the majority are covert, and tricks and avoidance play a major role.

The McGuire Programme was founded in 1994 by Dave McGuire, himself a person who stammers. He brought different therapy options together, namely non avoidance and diaphragmatic breathing, and combined them with his background in sports psychology. The courses follow a rigorous 3 or 4 day residential set up and all people on the course are people who stammer-this is a unique and key aspect of the course as we believe that advice is a form of nostalgia. The McGuire Programme has a substantial after support network with experienced graduates available in many regions of the world to help support new graduates of the programme and indeed established graduates.

The programme's best known graduate to-date is the [[United Kingdom|British]] singer [[Gareth Gates]] who has regularly promoted the course during TV interviews in the UK and [[Ireland]]. Also [[Graeme Duffin]], lead guitarist of the band [[Wet Wet Wet]] joined the programme and Scottish international rugby union captain, [[Kelly Brown]], is another graduate of the course. Adam Black, a graduate of the course, received a national honour, a BCA ([[British Citizen Awards]]), where his work raising awareness of stammering has been recognised. &lt;ref name="Dirs"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/get-inspired/26035211 | title=Scotland captain Kelly Brown tackling his stammer head on | work=[[BBC News]] | date=5 February 2014 | accessdate=30 September 2014 | author=Dirs, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mwani language''', or '''''Kimwani''''' (pronounced {{IPA-sw|kiˈmwani|}}), is spoken on the coast of the [[Cabo Delgado Province]] of [[Mozambique]], including the [[Quirimbas Islands]]. Although it shares high lexical similarity (60%) with Swahili, it is not intelligible with it. It is spoken by around 120,000 people (including 20,000 who use it as their second language). Speakers of ''Kimwani'' also use [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], (the official language of [[Mozambique]]), [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Makhuwa]] language. ''Kiwibo'',  the dialect of the Island of [[Ibo, Mozambique|Ibo]] is the prestige dialect. ''Kimwani'' (sometimes spelled as ''Quimuane'') is also called ''Mwani'' (sometimes spelled as: ''Mwane, Muane'') and ''Ibo''. According to Anthony P. Grant:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Smith| first1 = Norval| last2 = Veenstra| first2 = Tonjes| title = Creolization and Contact| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yjzoVTRvyXQC&amp;pg=PA94| year = 2001| publisher = John Benjamins Publishing| isbn = 90-272-5245-9| page = 94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Kimwani of northern [[Mozambique]] appears to be the result of imperfect shift towards [[Swahili language|Swahili]] several centuries ago by speakers of [[Makonde language|Makonde]]', and Arends et al. suggest it might turn out to be a Makonde–Swahili [[mixed language]].&lt;ref&gt;Arends, Muysken, &amp; Smith (1995), ''Pidgins and Creoles: An Introduction''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==

The Name "Kimwani" comes from the word "Mwani", meaning "beach". The prefix "Ki" means the language of, so "Kimwani" literally means "language of the beach".

== Sounds ==
''Kimwani'' (similar to [[Swahili language|Swahili]]) is unusual among sub-Saharan languages in having lost the feature of [[Tone (linguistics)|lexical tone]] (with the exception of some verbal paradigms where its use is optional). It does not have the penultimate stress typical of [[Swahili language|Swahili]]; it has movable [[pitch accent]]. [[Labialization]] of consonants (indicated by a [w] following the consonant) and [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] of [[r]] (ry; [rj]) are frequent. [[Nasalization]] of vowels occurs only before a nasal consonant [[n]] followed by a consonant.

=== Vowels ===
''Kimwani'' has five vowel [[phoneme]]s: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}}, that is: its vowels are close to those of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Latin language|Latin]]. It does not have a distinction of [[Close-mid vowel|closed]] and [[Open-mid-vowel|open]] [[mid vowel]]s typical of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]] or [[Italian language|Italian]].

The pronunciation of the phoneme /i/ stands between [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] [i] and [e]. Vowels are never [[vowel reduction|reduced]], regardless of [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. The vowels are pronounced as follows:

* {{IPA|/a/}} is pronounced like the "a" in ''start''
* {{IPA|/e/}} is pronounced like the "e" in ''bed''
* {{IPA|/i/}} is pronounced like the "y" in ''happy''
* {{IPA|/o/}} is pronounced like the "o" in ''or''
* {{IPA|/u/}} is pronounced like the "u" in ''Susan''.

Kimwani has no [[diphthong]]s; in vowel combinations, each vowel is pronounced separately.

=== Consonants ===
Two symbols in a table cell denote the voiceless and [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] consonant, respectively.

'''Ngbaka''' (''Ngbàkà'') is a [[Gbaya language]] spoken by just over a million people in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. It is a regionally important language, used by the [[Gilima]], [[Ngbundu]], [[Mbandja]] and [[Mono people (Congo)|Mono people]]s, and is taught in primary schools; 10% are literate in Ngbaka.

''Ngbaka'' is a common local ethnic name; the language may be distinguished from other languages called "Ngbaka" as '''Ngbaka Gbaya''' or '''Ngbaka Minagende'''.

There are no significant dialectal differences within Ngbaka, and it may be [[mutually intelligible]] with members of the [[Manza language|Manza dialect cluster]].

'''Olga Constantinovna of Russia''' ({{OldStyleDate|3 September|1851|22 August}}{{spaced ndash}}18 June 1926) was [[Queen consort of the Hellenes]] as the wife of [[George I of Greece|King George I]]. She was briefly the [[regent]] of Greece in 1920. 

A member of the [[Romanov dynasty]], she was the daughter of [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia|Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich]] and his wife, [[Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg]]. She spent her childhood in [[Saint Petersburg]], Poland and the [[Crimea]], and married King George I of Greece in 1867 at the age of sixteen. At first, she felt ill at ease in the [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]], but she quickly became involved in social and charitable work. She founded hospitals and schools, but her attempt to promote a new, more accessible, Greek translation of the Gospels sparked riots by religious conservatives.

On the assassination of her husband in 1913, Olga returned to Russia. When the [[First World War]] broke out, she set up a [[military hospital]] in [[Pavlovsk Palace]], which belonged to her brother. She was trapped in the palace after the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, until the Danish embassy intervened, allowing her to escape to Switzerland. Olga could not return to Greece as her son, [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]], had been deposed.

In October 1920, she returned to Athens on the fatal illness of her grandson, [[Alexander of Greece|King Alexander]]. After his death, she was appointed regent until the restoration of Constantine I the following month. After the defeat of the Greeks in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War of 1919–22]] the [[Greek royal family]] were again exiled and Olga spent the last years of her life in the United Kingdom, France and Italy.

==Family and early life==
Olga was born at [[Pavlovsk Palace]] near [[Saint Petersburg]] on {{OldStyleDate|3 September|1851|22 August}}. She was the second child and elder daughter of [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia|Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich]] and his wife, [[Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg|Grand Duchess Alexandra]], a former princess of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. Through her father, Olga was a granddaughter of Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]], a niece of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] and first cousin of Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]].{{sfn|Montgomery-Massingberd|1977|pp=469–474}}

Her childhood was spent at her father's homes, including Pavlovsk Palace and estates in the [[Crimea]]. Her father was a younger brother of Alexander II,{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|p=26}} and her mother was considered one of the most intelligent and elegant women of the court.{{sfn|Mateos Sáinz de Medrano|2004|pp=69–70}} Olga was particularly close to her older brother, [[Grand Duke Nicholas Constantinovich of Russia|Nicholas]], and was one of the few members of the imperial family to keep in touch with him after he was banished to [[Tashkent]].{{sfn|King|Wilson|2006|pp=55, 109–110}}

As a child, Olga was described as a simple and chubby little girl with a broad face and big blue eyes.{{sfn|King|Wilson|2006|p=36}} Unlike her younger sister, [[Grand Duchess Vera Constantinovna of Russia|Vera]], she had a calm temperament, but she was also extremely shy. For example, when interrogated by her tutors during lessons, she burst into tears and ran from the classroom.{{sfn|King|Wilson|2006|pp=36–38}}

In 1862, Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich was appointed [[Namiestnik of the Kingdom of Poland|viceroy]] of [[Russian Poland]] by his brother and moved to [[Warsaw]] with his wife and children. The stay in Poland proved difficult for the Grand Duke, who was the victim of a nationalist assassination attempt the day after his arrival in the Polish capital.{{sfn|King|Wilson|2006|p=35}} Although Constantine embarked on a program of liberalization and re-instated Polish as an official language,{{sfn|Zeepvat|2007|p=70}} Polish nationalists agitating for reform were not appeased. Finally, an [[January Uprising|uprising in January 1863]] and the radicalization of the separatists pushed the Tsar to recall his brother in August.{{sfn|King|Wilson|2006|pp=34–36}} Olga's difficult experiences in Poland marked her profoundly.{{sfn|Christmas|1914|p=81}}

==Engagement and marriage==

[[File:Queen Olga of the Hellenes.jpg|thumb|Queen Olga of Greece in a traditional Greek costume, circa 1870]]

The young King [[George I of Greece]] visited Russia in 1863 to thank Olga's uncle Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] for his support during George's election to the throne of Greece. Whilst there, George met the then twelve-year-old Olga for the first time.&lt;ref name=times&gt;''The Times'' (London), Monday 21 June 1926, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

George visited Russia again in 1867 to meet with his sister [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dagmar]], who had married [[Alexander III of Russia|Tsarevitch Alexander]] (later Alexander III) the year before. He was determined to find a wife and the idea of an alliance with a Russian grand duchess, born into the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], appealed to him.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|pp=24–25}} Olga fell in love with George, but she was nevertheless anxious and distraught at the thought of leaving Russia.{{sfn|King|Wilson|2006|p=37}} Her father was initially reluctant to agree to their marriage, thinking that at the age of fifteen she was too young and, being close to his daughter, concerned by the distance between Greece and Russia. For her part, Grand Duchess Alexandra was much more enthusiastic than her husband and, when some members of the imperial family noted the extreme youth of her daughter, she replied that Olga would not always be as young.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|pp=24–25}} Eventually, it was decided that Olga and George would marry when she had reached her sixteenth birthday. Meanwhile, she would continue her schoolwork until her wedding day.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|pp=24–25}}

Olga and George married at the chapel of the [[Winter Palace]] in Saint Petersburg on {{OldStyleDate|27 October|1867|15 October}}. After five days of festivities, they spent a brief honeymoon at [[Ropsha]], south-west of Saint Petersburg. Over the following twenty years, they had eight children:
* [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]] (2 August 1868&amp;nbsp;– 11 January 1923), who was born ten months after the marriage of his parents; he married [[Princess Sophia of Prussia]] and succeeded his father as king;
* [[Prince George of Greece and Denmark|George]] (24 June 1869&amp;nbsp;– 25 November 1957), High Commissioner of [[Crete]] from 1898 to 1906, married [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]];
* [[Grand Duchess Alexandra Georgievna of Russia|Alexandra]] (30 August 1870&amp;nbsp;– 24 September 1891), married [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia]]; their children included [[Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia]], one of the assassins of [[Grigori Rasputin]];
* [[Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark|Nicholas]] (22 January 1872&amp;nbsp;– 8 February 1938), married [[Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia]];
* [[Princess Maria of Greece and Denmark|Marie]] (3 March 1876&amp;nbsp;– 14 December 1940), married firstly [[Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia (1863–1919)|Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia]] and secondly [[Perikles Ioannidis]];
* Olga (7 April 1880&amp;nbsp;– 2 November 1880);
* [[Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark|Andrew]] (2 February 1882&amp;nbsp;– 3 December 1944), he married [[Princess Alice of Battenberg]], their children included [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]; and
* [[Prince Christopher of Greece and Denmark|Christopher]] (10 August 1888&amp;nbsp;– 21 January 1940), father of [[Prince Michael of Greece]].{{sfn|Montgomery-Massingberd|1977|pp=325–327}}

The Tsar told Olga "to love her new country twice more than her own",{{sfn|Carabott|1993|p=123}} but she was ill-prepared for her new life. Aware of her youth, she chose to retain the services of her governess to continue her education.{{sfnm|Mateos Sáinz de Medrano|2004|1p=69|Van der Kiste|1999|2p=25}} On arrival at [[Piraeus]], Olga wore blue and white, the national colors of Greece, to the delight of the crowd. On the way to the capital, popular unrest was such that Olga, who was not accustomed to such demonstrations, was close to tears. Unable to speak Greek, and with little time for rest, she attended official functions over several days. Overwhelmed, Olga was found sobbing under a staircase cuddling her teddy bear a few days after her arrival in the kingdom while she was expected for a formal event.{{sfnm|Mateos Sáinz de Medrano|2004|1p=69|Van der Kiste|1999|2p=26}} In less than a year, she learnt Greek and English.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|p=26}} On the advice of her mother, she took an interest in the archeology and history of Greece to gain public support.{{sfn|Mateos Sáinz de Medrano|2004|p=70}}

Throughout their marriage, George I and Olga were a close-knit couple,{{sfnm|Gelardi|2006|1p=181|Vickers|2000|2p=68}} and contrary to the prevailing custom spent much time with their children, who grew up in a warm family atmosphere.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|p=36}} With age, however, George I argued with his sons and Olga lamented the quarrels that divided the family periodically.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|p=53}} In private, Olga and George I conversed in German because it was the only language they both spoke at the time of their marriage. With their offspring, they spoke mainly English,{{sfn|Forster|1958|p=74}} although the children were required to speak Greek among themselves,{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|p=42}} and Prince Andrew refused to speak anything but Greek to his parents.{{sfnm|Mateos Sáinz de Medrano|2004|1p=73|Vickers|2000|2p=309}}

The life of the royal family was relatively quiet and withdrawn. The Athenian court was not as brilliant and sumptuous as that of Saint Petersburg,{{sfn|Michael of Greece|2004|p=27}} and days in the Greek capital were sometimes monotonous for members of the royal family.{{sfn|Bertin|1982|p=150}} In spring and winter, they divided time between the [[Hellenic Parliament|Royal Palace]] in Athens, and [[Tatoi Palace]] at the foot of Mount [[Parnitha]]. Summers were spent on vacation at [[Aix-les-Bains]] in France, visiting relatives in the Russian capital or at [[Fredensborg Palace|Fredensborg]] and [[Bernstorff Palace|Bernstorff]] in Denmark, and relaxing at [[Mon Repos, Corfu]].{{sfn|Mateos Sáinz de Medrano|2004|pp=70–73}}

Olga remained nostalgic for Russia. Her room was filled with icons from her homeland and, in the palace chapel, she sang Slavic hymns with her children. She often visited Russian ships that were docked at [[Piraeus]] and invited the Russian sailors to the royal palace.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|pp=26, 39}} She was the only woman in history to bear the title of Admiral of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]], an honor given to her on marriage.{{sfn|King|Wilson|2006|p=37}} She was honored in the Greek navy by having [[Greek ironclad Vasilissa Olga|a ship named after her]].{{sfn|Driault|Lheritier|1926|pp=227, 319, 424, vol. III}}

==Social work==
[[File:Amalieion Orfanotrofeion Athinon.JPG|thumb|right|Amalieion orphanage, Athens]]
Olga was genuinely popular and was extensively involved in charity work.&lt;ref name=times /&gt;{{sfn|Vickers|2000|p=67}} On arrival in Athens, her immediate [[patronage]]s included the Amalieion orphanage founded by the previous queen consort [[Amalia of Oldenburg]], and the [[Arsakeio]]n school for girls located on [[Panepistimiou Street|University Boulevard]]. With her personal support and the support of wealthy donors, she built asylums for the terminally ill and for the elderly disabled, and a [[sanatorium]] for patients with [[Tuberculosis|consumption]]. She founded a society to help the poor, a kindergarten for the children of the poor, and a soup kitchen in Piraeus that doubled as a cooking school for poor girls that was later expanded into a weaving school for girls and elderly women in financial difficulty.{{sfn|Christmas|1914|p=129}} She was patron of two military hospitals and endowed the [[List of hospitals in Greece|''Evangelismos'' (Annunciation) Hospital]], Greece's largest, in downtown [[Athens]].&lt;ref name=times /&gt;{{sfnm|Christmas|1914|1p=131|Mateos Sáinz de Medrano|2004|2p=72}} She built the Russian Hospital in [[Piraeus]] in memory of her daughter, [[Grand Duchess Alexandra Georgievna of Russia|Alexandra]], who died in Moscow in 1891. Although aimed primarily at Russian sailors, the hospital was open to all seamen visiting Greece, with consultation fees set at the low rate of thirty [[Greek lepton|lepta]] and medicines being free.{{sfn|Christmas|1914|pp=130–131}} Olga also supported the establishment and funding of hospitals during the conflicts between Greece and its neighbors, including the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War of 1897]] and the [[First Balkan War]] (1912–13).{{sfn|Christmas|1914|pp=265–266, 368}} For their work for the wounded, Olga and her daughter-in-law [[Sophia of Prussia|Crown Princess Sophia]] were awarded the [[Royal Red Cross]] by [[Queen Victoria]] of the United Kingdom in December 1897.{{sfn|Gelardi|2006|p=83}}

Before Olga's arrival in Greece, there were no separate prisons for women or the young, and she was instrumental in the establishment of a women's prison in the capital and, with the support of wealthy philanthropist [[George Averoff]], one for juvenile delinquents.{{sfn|Christmas|1914|p=130}}

Shortly after Greece's defeat in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, shots were fired at Olga's husband and daughter by disgruntled Greeks in 1898. Despite the failed assassination, Olga insisted on continuing her engagements without a military guard.&lt;ref name=times /&gt; Her son [[Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark|Nicolas]] wrote in his memoirs that one day he spoke of the importance of public opinion to his mother, and she retorted, "I prefer to be governed by a well born lion rather than four hundred rats like me."&lt;ref&gt;"''Je préfère être gouvernée par un lion bien né que par quatre-cent rats de mon espèce''", quoted in {{harvnb|Nicholas of Greece|1926|p=51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Olga's interest in political and public opinion was limited. Although she favored Greece's [[Russian Party (Greece)|Russian party]],{{sfn|Driault|Lheritier|1926|pp=270, 477, vol. IV}} she had no political influence over her husband and did not seek political influence in the [[Greek parliament]].{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|p=41}}

==''Evangelika'' controversy==
[[File:Evangelika1901.jpg|thumb|left|''Evangelika'' riots in Athens, 1901]]
An [[Orthodox Christian]] from birth, Queen Olga became aware, during visits to wounded servicemen in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)]], that many were unable to read the [[Bible]].{{sfn|Carabott|1993|p=123}} The version used by the [[Church of Greece]] included the [[Septuagint]] version of the [[Old Testament]] and the original Greek-language version of the [[New Testament]]. Both were written in [[Koine Greek]] while her contemporaries used either [[Katharevousa]] or the so-called [[Demotic Greek|Demotic]] version of [[Modern Greek]]. Katharevousa was a formal language that contained archaized forms of modern words, was purged of "non-Greek" vocabulary from other European languages and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and had a (simplified) archaic grammar. Modern or Demotic Greek was the version commonly spoken. Olga decided to have the Bible translated into a version that could be understood by most contemporary Greeks rather than only those educated in Koine Greek. Opponents of the translation, however, considered it "tantamount to a renunciation of Greece's 'sacred heritage'".{{sfn|Carabott|1993|p=125}}

In February 1901, the translation of the New Testament from Koine into Modern Greek that she had sponsored was published without the authorization of the Greek [[Holy Synod]]. The price was set at one [[drachma]], far below its actual cost, and the edition sold well. To mitigate opposition to the translation, both the old and new texts were included and the frontispiece specifically stated it was for "exclusive family use" rather than in church.{{sfn|Carabott|1993|p=124}}

At the same time, another translation was completed by [[Alexandros Pallis]], a major supporter of a literary movement supporting the use of Demotic in written language. Publication of the translation started in serial form in the newspaper ''[[Akropolis (newspaper)|Akropolis]]'' on 9 September 1901.{{sfn|Carabott|1993|p=126}} Purist theologians denounced this version as "a ridiculing of the nation's most valuable relics"&lt;!--What is the actual source of this quote? The cited Watch Tower source indicates it is itself quoting this statement, but provides no source--&gt; and [[Ecumenical Patriarch Joachim III of Constantinople]] denounced the translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=15 November 2002|title=The Struggle for a Bible in Modern Greek|journal=The Watchtower|publisher=Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2002846|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A faction of the Greek press started accusing Pallis and his Demoticist supporters of blasphemy and treason.{{sfn|Carabott|1993|p=126}} Riots, peaking on 8 November, were started by students of the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|University of Athens]], partly motivated by conservative professors.{{sfn|Carabott|1993|pp=128–130}} They demanded the [[excommunication]] of Pallis and anyone involved with the translations, including Olga and Procopios, the [[List of Archbishops of Athens|Metropolitan bishop of Athens]], who had supervised the translation at her personal request.{{sfn|Carabott|1993|pp=123, 129–130}}

Troops were called in to maintain order, and conflict between them and the rioters resulted in eight deaths and over sixty people wounded.{{sfn|Carabott|1993|pp=117, 131}} By December, the remaining copies of Olga's translation had been confiscated and their circulation prohibited. Anyone selling or reading the translations was threatened with excommunication.{{sfn|Carabott|1993|p=131}} The controversy was called ''Evangelika'',{{sfn|Carabott|1993|p=117}} i.e. "the Gospels question", after the word ''[[Gospel#Etymology|Evangelion]]'', Greek for "Gospel", and led to the resignation of the [[metropolitan bishop]], Procopius, and the fall of the government of [[Georgios Theotokis]].{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1a2=Sherrard|1y=1968|1p=198|2a1=Carabott|2y=1993|2p=131}}&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London), Tuesday 26 November 1901, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Widowhood==
[[File:Funeral of George I of Greece.jpg|thumb|right|Funeral of George I, Athens, 1913]]
In 1913, the [[First Balkan War]] ended with the defeat of the [[Ottoman Empire]] by a coalition of Greek, [[Bulgaria]]n, [[Serbia]]n and [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] forces. Greece was considerably enlarged at the expense of [[Turkey]], but divisions between the victorious powers in the [[Balkan League]] soon became apparent: Athens and [[Sofia]] vied for possession of [[Thessaloniki]] and its region.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|p=72}} To affirm Greek control of the main city of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], George I moved to the city soon after its liberation. Just as he did in Athens, he went about Thessaloniki without any meaningful protection force, and while out for an afternoon walk near the [[White Tower of Thessaloniki|White Tower]] on 18 March 1913, he was shot and killed by [[Alexandros Schinas]].{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|pp=72–75}} Olga, who said her husband's death was "the will of God", arrived at Thessaloniki the next day. She and her family visited the scene of the assassination and accompanied the body of the king to Athens. He was buried in the royal cemetery at [[Tatoi Palace]].{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|pp=76–77}}

George and Olga's eldest son, [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]], became king and his wife, [[Sophia of Prussia]], became the new [[queen consort]]. Olga, as [[queen dowager]], was given the use of a wing in the royal palace but soon returned to her native Russia, to spend time with her younger brother, [[Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich of Russia|Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich]] and his family at his home, and Olga's birthplace, [[Pavlovsk Palace]].{{sfnm|Mateos Sáinz de Medrano|2004|1p=85|Michael of Greece|2004|2p=27}}

==World War I==
[[File:Pavlovsk Palace 1890-1900.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pavlovsk Palace]], near [[Saint Petersburg]]]]
In August 1914, Olga was in Russia at the outbreak of [[World War I]],{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|p=87}} in which the [[Allies of World War I|Allied or Entente Powers]] including Russia, Britain and France fought against the [[Central Powers]] including Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. She decided to stay in Saint Petersburg and establish a military hospital to support the Russian war effort.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|p=116}} Olga created a clinic at Pavlovsk Palace where she cared for wounded soldiers with her sister-in-law, [[Princess Elisabeth of Saxe-Altenburg (1865–1927)|Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mavrikievna]]. Other members of the imperial family, such as [[Princess Helen of Serbia|Princess Helen]] and Olga's granddaughter [[Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia (1890–1958)|Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna]] founded field hospitals at the front.{{sfnm|1a1=King|1a2=Wilson|1y=2006|1p=155|2a1=Michael of Greece|2y=2004|2p=78}} As the war continued, Olga became aware of the growing crisis in Russia, and attempted to warn [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Tsarina Alexandra]] in 1916 of the danger of revolution but the Russian empress refused to listen. A few weeks later, Olga attracted the fury of the Tsarina after signing a petition asking for a pardon for her grandson, [[Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich]], who had been exiled to the [[Persian Campaign|Persian front]] for his involvement in the assassination of Alexandra's favorite mystic, [[Grigori Rasputin]].{{sfnm|1a1=King|1a2=Wilson|1y=2006|1pp=163–164|2a1=Van der Kiste|2y=1998|2p=191}}
[[File:Queen Olga of Greece.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait by [[Georgios Jakobides]], 1915]]
In contrast to Olga, her eldest son, King Constantine I of Greece, was determined to follow a policy of neutrality.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|pp=89–90}} His maternal relations were Russian, and his wife was the sister of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] of Germany. His policy brought him into conflict with [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]] [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], who favored the Allies. Constantine was soon accused of being a Germanophile and the Athenian government was regarded with suspicion in London and Paris. In what became known as the [[National Schism]], Venizelos established a parallel government in Thessaloniki in opposition to Constantine.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|pp=98–99}}

On the [[February Revolution|collapse of the Tsarist regime]] in February 1917, Olga's sister-in-law left Pavlovsk with her family, but Olga stayed, soon to be almost alone except for a single young domestic named Anna Egorova. (After the Revolution, Egorova entered the service of [[Prince Christopher of Greece and Denmark|Prince Christopher of Greece]] and became the governess of his son, [[Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark|Michael]].{{sfn|Michael of Greece|2004|p=78}}) Short of food, the two women were limited to eating a little dry bread soaked in poor quality oil. Their safety was far from assured, and a few days after the [[October Revolution]], [[Bolshevik]]s invaded and ransacked the palace. Olga was physically unharmed.{{sfn|King|Wilson|2006|pp=166, 186}} She accepted the need to leave Russia, but the Bolsheviks refused to let her go and diplomatic help from Greece was not forthcoming in the aftermath of the National Schism. In June, Constantine had been deposed and exiled to Switzerland. As the Allies did not wish to establish a Greek republic or see [[George II of Greece|Crown Prince George]] succeed his father, Constantine was replaced on the throne by his second son, [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]], who was thought to be more favorable to the Allies and more malleable than his older brother.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|pp=104–108}} Venizelos held power and the supporters of the deposed king were arrested or executed.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|pp=112–115}}

==First exile==
After several months of appeals for help, the Danish legation in [[Russia]] issued Olga a passport, which she used to enter Germany on the eve of its defeat, eventually joining her eldest son and his family in Switzerland in early 1919.{{sfnm|Mateos Sáinz de Medrano|2004|1pp=89–90|Van der Kiste|1999|2p=116}} Other members of the Russian imperial family did not escape. Among those [[Shooting of the Romanov family|killed were the Tsar, Tsarina and their five children]]; Olga's brothers Grand Dukes [[Grand Duke Nicholas Constantinovich of Russia|Nicholas]] and [[Grand Duke Dimitri Constantinovich of Russia|Dmitri]] Constantinovich; three of her nephews Princes [[Prince John Constantinovich of Russia|John]], [[Prince Constantine Constantinovich of Russia|Constantine]] and [[Prince Igor Constantinovich of Russia|Igor]] Constantinovich; and the Tsarina's sister [[Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine (1864–1918)|Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna]].{{sfnm|Montgomery-Massingberd|1977|1pp=470–476|Van der Kiste|1998|2pp=198–202}}

[[File:Laszlo - Queen Olga of Greece.jpg|thumb|upright|Queen Olga in old age by [[Philip de László]]]]
In Switzerland, Constantine I and his family found themselves isolated and without an income. The Greek government under Venizelos did not pay pensions to former rulers and prohibited any contact between the exiles and King Alexander. Already in fragile health, the former king became gradually more depressed.{{sfn|Mateos Sáinz de Medrano|2004|p=90}} The Russian Revolution and the National Schism deprived Olga of her immovable property and she was forced to live a much less lavish lifestyle than in the past.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|p=147}} She did, however, enjoy spending more time with her sons and grandchildren, from whom she had been long separated by the war.{{sfn|Vickers|2000|p=145}}

==Regency==
On 2 October 1920, King Alexander was bitten by a monkey during a walk through the gardens at Tatoi. The wound became infected and Alexander developed [[septicemia]]. On 19 October, he began to rave and called for his mother, but the Greek government refused to allow Queen Sophia to return to Greece.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|pp=122–123}} Worried about her son, and knowing that his grandmother was the only other royal still in favor with the [[Venizelism|Venizelists]], Sophia asked Olga to go to Athens to care for Alexander. After several days of negotiations, the dowager queen obtained permission to return to Greece but, delayed by rough seas, she arrived twelve hours after her grandson's death on 25 October.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|pp=123–124}} On 29 October, Alexander was buried at Tatoi; Olga was the only member of the royal family at the funeral.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|p=125}}

Still opposed to the return of Constantine I and Crown Prince George, the government of Eleftherios Venizelos offered the throne to Constantine's third son, [[Paul of Greece|Prince Paul]], who refused to ascend the throne before his father and older brother unless a referendum named him head of state.{{sfnm|Van der Kiste|1999|1pp=125–126|Vickers|2000|2p=148}} Only days after Alexander's death, however, Venizelos was defeated in [[Greek legislative election, 1920|a general election]]. On 17 November, Admiral [[Pavlos Kountouriotis]], regent since the death of Alexander, retired and the new prime minister, [[Dimitrios Rallis]], asked Olga to assume the regency. She served as regent for about a month until her son Constantine returned to the throne on 19 December after [[Greek referendum, 1920|a referendum in his favor]].{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|p=126}}

==Second exile and death==

[[File:Vasilissa Olga CoA.jpg|thumb|upright|Olga's monogram used as an emblem on the World War II-era Greek destroyer [[Greek destroyer Vasilissa Olga (D15)|''Vasilissa Olga'']]]]
Constantine I returned to the throne 18 months into the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)|Greco-Turkish War]], launched in May 1919. In September 1921, the Greek defeat at the [[battle of Sakarya]] marked the beginning of the Greek retreat from Turkey. Resentment among the allies for Constantine's policy during World War I prevented Athens from receiving outside support.{{sfnm|Bertin|1982|1p=230|Van der Kiste|1999|2pp=129–130}} [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], the new leader of Turkey, regained [[Smyrna]] and [[Eastern Thrace]], annexed by Athens at the end of World War I.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|pp=134–137}}

Following [[11 September 1922 Revolution|a coup by disgruntled military officers]], Constantine I abdicated for a second time on 27 September 1922. With several other members of his family, including Queen Olga, he went into exile in Italy and his eldest son succeeded him for a few months on the throne as George II.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|p=137}} Within months, Constantine died in Italy. One of Olga's sons, Prince Andrew, was among those arrested by the new regime. Many defendants in the [[Trial of the Six|treason trials]] that followed the coup were shot, including senior politicians and generals.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London), Friday 1 December 1922, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign diplomats assumed that Andrew was also in mortal danger, and [[George V of the United Kingdom]], [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]], the French president [[Raymond Poincaré]] and [[Pope Pius XI]] sent representatives to Athens to intercede on his behalf.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|p=140}} Andrew, though spared, was banished for life and his family (including the infant [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]], later Duke of Edinburgh and consort of [[Queen Elizabeth II]]) fled into exile in December 1922 aboard a British cruiser, [[HMS Calypso (D61)|HMS ''Calypso'']].{{sfnm|Van der Kiste|1999|1pp=140–141|Vickers|2000|2pp=170–171}}&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London), Tuesday 5 December 1922, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike her children and grandchildren, Olga was given a pension by the government of the [[Second Hellenic Republic]], but she maintained so many of the faithful old servants who had fled Greece with her that she was usually left with no more than 20 [[Pound sterling|pounds sterling]] per month (worth about £{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|20|1922|r=-2}}}} in {{inflation-year|UK}} prices{{Inflation-fn|UK}}) to meet her own expenses.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|p=147}} She could, however, count on the support of her family, scattered throughout Western Europe. In the United Kingdom, she shared her time between [[Spencer House, London]], the residence of her youngest son, Prince Christopher; [[Regent's Park]], where her daughter, Grand Duchess Marie, rented a mansion; [[Sandringham House]], the home of her sister-in-law, [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]]; and [[Windsor Castle]] and [[Buckingham Palace]], where her nephew, King George V, lent apartments.{{sfnm|Mateos Sáinz de Medrano|2004|1pp=92–93, 318|Van der Kiste|1999|2p=147}}

[[File:GrabKöniginOlga.jpg|thumb|upright|Olga's grave in Tatoi]]
Olga's final years were marked by ill health. Lameness restricted her to a wheelchair, and she stayed in Paris several times to undergo treatment for her eyes. Her poor eyesight caused George V much laughter when she mistook a statue of a naked [[Lady Godiva]] for one of [[Queen Victoria]].{{sfn|Van der Kiste|1999|p=140}} Increasingly dependent, Olga finally settled with her youngest son, Prince Christopher, shortly after the death of his first wife, [[Princess Anastasia of Greece and Denmark|Princess Anastasia]], in 1923. Olga died on 18 June 1926 either at Christopher's Villa Anastasia in [[Rome]],{{sfnm|Van der Kiste|1999|1p=147|Vickers|2000|2p=180}} or at [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau, France]].{{sfn|Montgomery-Massingberd|1977|p=325}}&lt;!--Two in the morning on 19 June in the presence of her family at Villa Anastasia according to ''The Times'' (London), Monday 21 June 1926, p. 14.--&gt;

Despite republicanism in Greece, Olga was still held in high esteem and the republican government in Athens offered to pay for her funeral&lt;!--''The Times'' (London), Monday 21 June 1926, p. 14.--&gt; and repatriate her remains to Greece. Nonetheless, her children declined the offer, preferring to bury her in Italy beside her son, Constantine I, whose body Greece had refused to accept.{{sfn|Vickers|2000|pp=180–181}} Her funeral was held on 22 June 1926 at the Orthodox Church in Rome&lt;!--''The Times'' (London), Wednesday 23 June 1926, p. 15.--&gt; and the next day she was laid to rest in the crypt of the Russian church in [[Florence]].{{sfnm|Van der Kiste|1999|1p=147|Vickers|2000|2pp=180–181}}&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London), Friday 25 June 1926, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Greek monarchy referendum, 1935|restoration of the Greek monarchy in 1935]] she was re-interred at Tatoi on 17 November 1936.{{sfnm|Forster|1958|1p=198|Mateos Sáinz de Medrano|2004|2p=188}}

As much of her property had been confiscated by the [[Soviet Union]] and the Greek republican government, most of her estate comprised jewelry reported in ''[[The Times]]'' to be worth £100,000 ({{Inflation|UK-GDP|100000|1926|r=-5|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{Inflation-fn|UK-GDP}}). This was shared between her children and the children of Constantine I.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London), Tuesday 22 June 1926, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Traumatized by the events of the [[Russian Revolution]], Olga wished to sever all ties with the country in which her family had been massacred. Before dying, she made her grandson, King George II, swear to repatriate the ashes of her daughter Princess Alexandra, buried in the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]] in Saint Petersburg. Her wish was fulfilled in 1940 after his restoration to the Greek throne.{{sfn|Mateos Sáinz de Medrano|2004|p=327}}

== Biography ==
=== Early life, education &amp; family ===
P.V. Acharya was born on 15 February 1915 in the town of Kunjibettu in Udupi district near Mangalore in Karnataka. He was born to Padigaru Laxminarayanacharya (father) and Seetamma (mother). He was the youngest of five children and their only son. Acharya was five years old when his father died.  With some external financial help from extended family &amp; well-wishers, he studied until high school.  He passed matriculation (10th standard) with a 100 percent score in mathematics and 85 percent in English. Impressed with his results, his school’s principal offered him to get admission into Mangalore’s St. Aloysius College with full scholarship. However, Acharya could not accept the scholarship as it would have been impossible for him to manage other living expenses while studying in a more expensive city of Mangalore. He also had the responsibility of taking care of his family. He focused on career instead.

=== Career ===
P.V. Acharya started his career as a primary school teacher in 1932 and quit the job in 1933.He joined Tulunadu Press as an accountant. There, he learned about publishing, which helped . He also had a short stint as editor of “Antaranga”  previously.&lt;ref&gt;The Modern Review - Volume 63 - Page 337 Ramananda Chatterjee - 1938 "" Hindi as the Lingua Franca " by P. V. Acharya appears in the January number of The Modem Review. I beg to correct some notions of the learned author.."&lt;/ref&gt;
He worked as accountant at several places after that until finally joining ''[[Samyukta Karnataka]]'' Press as supervisor for jobs division in 1942. Luck came his way when H.R. Purohit, the then editor-in-chief of Karmaveera, a popular Kannada weekly magazine of that time had to take a 6 weeks long vacation for personal reasons. P.V. Acharya was asked to fill-in for H.R. Purohit. From 1947 onward he worked for Karmaveera full-time from and penned several satirical and gabby articles (ಹರಟೆ) under the pen name of Langulacharya . His articles gained instant popularity with the mass and they are regarded as being instrumental in increasing the magazine’s circulation.
His major contributions to Kannada literature and journalism were through the Kannada monthly digest called “Kasturi”, which he modelled after the popular English digest – “Reader’s Digest”. He graced the position of founder editor for the magazine from 1956 to 1975. During his tenure at Kasturi, the magazine saw  success in Kannada publications.
Post retirement from Kasturi as editor, he continued to contribute to the magazine via a unique section called “Padartha Chintamani” , which explored the origins, contextual meanings and historical references of words. Later, collection of these articles were published as two volume book series.The Media and Public Interest Foundation of Hubli has also set up "Pavem Vichara Vedike" since 2009, which presents the "Pavem Award" for lifetime achievement and upcoming talent categories in Kannada language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/contribution-of-pavem-lauded/article173585.ece|title=Pavem Award|last=|first=|publisher=The Hindu}}

'''Giani Partap Singh''' (Punjabi: ਗਿਆਨੀ ਪ੍ਰਤਾਪ ਸਿੰਘ; January 3, 1904&amp;nbsp;– May 10, 1984) was a Sikh priest and Panjabi writer. He served as the 1st acting [[Jathedar of Akal Takht]] from December 19, 1937 to 1948 and 19th [[Jathedar of Akal Takht]] from 1952 to February 15, 1955.&lt;ref name=GPSJ&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nirankari|first1=Dr Maan Singh|title=Giani Partap Singh Ji|date=1900s|publisher=Darbar Printing Press|page=17|ref=BK-005906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career ==
Partap Singh was born on January 3, 1904, at Nara village in [[Rawalpindi]] division of [[Punjab (region)|Panjab]], [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]]. His father was Makhan Singh and mother Mathura Devi. His grandfather, Sundar Singh served in the army of [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]. Between 1909 and 1918, Singh completed 5 years of education at the local primary school in Nara and further education at the middle school in [[Bishan Daur]]. Near the completion of his primary education, he took the vows of the [[Khalsa]] and became an initiated [[Sikh]]. Subsequently, for some 3 years he studied Sikh literature and attended the services of [[Singh Sabha Movement]] and Isher Singh Rara Sahib.&lt;ref name=GPSJ /&gt;

In 1922, Singh enrolled into Khalsa Updesh College at [[Gujranwala]], where he passed the certificate of [[Giani]] with the second highest marks in [[Punjab (region)|Panjab]]. From 1918 to 1921, he attended various conferences organised by [[Chief Khalsa Diwan]], Na-Milvartan Lehir and Sikh League. These conferences had a great impact on his mind and conscience.&lt;ref name=GPSJ /&gt;

In 1923, Singh contributed with immense participation in the Kar Seva (literally "service with hands") of [[Harmandir Sahib]]. Considering the service and education of the Giani, [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] (SGPC) employed him as a priest. Soon after he joined, the [[East India Company]] declared that the SGPC was against the law. The government arrested various SGPC workers including Singh and imprisoned them at [[Jhang]] and [[Multan]]. During the one and half years of imprisonment, the Giani managed to learn multiple languages such as [[English language|English]], [[Urdu]], [[Persian language|Farsi]] and [[Hindi]].&lt;ref name=GPSJ /&gt;

{{about||the pasta dish|pastitsio|the literary term|pastiche}}
In music, a '''''pasticcio''''' or '''''pastiche''''' is an opera or other musical work composed of works by different composers who may or may not have been working together, or an adaptation or localization of an existing work that is loose, unauthorized, or inauthentic.

==Etymology==

The term is first attested in the 16th century referring both to a kind of pie containing meat and pasta (''see [[pastitsio]]'') and to a literary mixture; for music, the earliest attestation is 1795 in Italian and 1742 in English. It derives from the post-classical [[Latin language|Latin]] ''pasticium'' (13th century), a pie or pasty.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', March 2008 revision, ''s.v.'' pasticcio&lt;/ref&gt;

==In opera==
In the 18th century, [[opera]] ''pasticcios'' were frequently made by composers such as [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], for example ''[[Muzio Scevola]]'' (1721) and ''[[Giove in Argo]]'' (1739), as well as [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]], and [[Johann Christian Bach]]. These composite works would consist mainly of portions of other composers' work, although they could also include original composition. The portions borrowed from other composers would be more or less freely adapted, especially in the case of [[aria]]s in ''pasticcio'' operas by substituting a new text for the original one. In late 18th-century English ''pasticcios'', for instance by [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold]] or [[William Shield]], the "borrowed" music could be Irish or British folksongs.

==In instrumental music==
Instrumental works would also sometimes be assembled from pre-existing compositions, a notable instance of this being the first four [[piano]] [[concerto]]s of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]. These concertos ([[Köchel-Verzeichnis|K.]] 37, 39–41) were assembled almost entirely from keyboard [[sonata]] movements by contemporary composers, to which the boy Mozart added [[orchestra]]l parts supporting the keyboard soloist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7974">'''Pink money''' describes the [[purchasing power]] of the [[LGBT community|gay community]], often especially with respect to [[political donations]].  With the rise of the [[gay rights movement]], pink money has gone from being a fringe or marginalized market to a thriving industry in many parts of the [[Western world]] such as the United States and United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="ns"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Morris|first=Chris|title=Now meet the real gay mafia| newspaper = [[New Statesman]]|pages=22–23|date=1999-02-12|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many businesses now specifically cater to gay customers, including [[nightclub]]s, shops, [[restaurant]]s, and even [[taxicab]]s; the demand for these services stems from common [[discrimination]] by traditional businesses. 

In 2015, LGBT adults in the United States held a combined buying power of approximately $917 billion. This figure exceeded that held by Asian Americans while nearing that of both black and Hispanic Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-20/lgbt-purchasing-power-near-1-trillion-rivals-other-minorities|title=LGBT Purchasing Power Near $1 Trillion Rivals Other Minorities|last=JeffAGreen|first=Jeff Green|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[economic power]] of pink money has been seen as a positive force for the gay community, creating a kind of "financial [[self-identification]]" which helps [[gay]] and [[lesbian]] individuals feel like part of a community which values them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheila Perry|first=Sheila |author2=Máire Cross |title=Voices of France: Social, Political and Cultural Identity|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1997|page=172|isbn=1-85567-394-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, upwards of 90% of gay people support businesses which target pink money, while actively boycotting anti-gay companies.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Business: The Economy: The Pink Pound |publisher=BBC News|date=1998-07-31|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_economy/142998.stm|accessdate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, criticism has been leveled at businesses which target pink money from gay groups, arguing that this segregates the gay and lesbian community from society, and holds back [[gay rights]].&lt;ref name="ns"/&gt;

It's been considered more often than not a market exclusive for USA, UK and some places in Europe, but its extension covers a large amount of Latin America and part of Asia, making its actual earns larger by year and giving marketing options some impulse and variety.

== In the United Kingdom ==
Known as the '''pink pound''' in the United Kingdom, the British gay market is estimated to be worth up to [[British Pound|£]]6 billion a year.

The Pink Pound is often considered to be responsible for the high sales of specific products seen to be favored by a large number of gay people, most noticeably music sales of records by [[gay icon]]s such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Kylie Minogue]] and [[Cher]]. A range of large corporations have recently realised the power of the Pink Pound and have begun to directly market their products towards the gay community through advertising in the gay press. In June 2006 a specialized marketing conference called the Pink Pound Conference was held in London and a similar conference was held in November 2006 by the Market Research Society.

Groups and organizations concerned with the [[ghettoisation]], conformity, and commercialism of the pink pound include [[OutRage!]], the [[NUS LGBT]] Campaign and the [[Queer Youth Alliance]]&amp;mdash;paralleling the more general criticisms of pink money.

A large market of goods and services for gay people has appeared in recent years, including [[gay wedding]] services, [[gay press]] including radio and television, and domestic services such as [[Construction worker|builders]] and [[plumbers]]. In 2001 several gay companies produced pink stickers and stuck them onto thousands of [[Pound Coin]]s which are still in circulation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==In the United States==
Known as the '''pink dollar''' or "Dorothy dollar" in the United States, estimates of the US LGBT market put its value at approximately [[US dollar|$]]790 billion in the year 2012.&lt;ref name="2012US"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsingazette.com/breaking-news/lgbt-buying-power-equals-790-billion.html|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130210024302/http://www.wisconsingazette.com/breaking-news/lgbt-buying-power-equals-790-billion.html|archivedate=2013-02-10|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2012-04-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many of these households are known by demographers as "[[DINKY]]"&amp;mdash;which generally have more disposable income.

Some US industries have tried to focus on these markets with specific advertising campaigns; for example, American Airlines saw its earnings from [[LGBT]] people rise from $20 million in 1994 to $193.5 million in 1999, after formation of a team devoted to gay and lesbian marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=United Tries for Gay-Friendly Skies |first=Michael |last=Arndt |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/may2000/nf00524b.htm |publisher=BusinessWeek |date=24 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[politics]], pink money has been viewed as controversial, mainly due to pressure from [[conservative]] groups promoting traditional values&amp;mdash;for instance, [[Presidential Candidate]] [[Michael Dukakis]] publicly disassociated himself from pink money during the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 US presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gays come out for Gore - as lesser evil|publisher=[[Financial Times]] |date=2007-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, more recently pink money has become politically acceptable, especially as a major source of liberal funding for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]&amp;mdash;in 2000, contributing $5 million to the [[Democratic National Committee]] alone, "a total that puts them among the top tier of Democratic givers, along with unions, [and] trial lawyers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Marcus|first=Ruth|title='Pink Money' Flowing to Democrats; Gay Contributions Now Major Source |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2000-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major candidates such as [[Bill Clinton]], [[Al Gore]], [[John Edwards]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Howard Dean]], [[John Kerry]], and [[Joe Biden]] have actively campaigned for the gay vote.

Since around 2005, Bob Witeck's Washington, D.C.-based communications firm [[Witeck Communications]] has conducted an annual buying power study of U.S. gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender adults.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Jeff Green, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-20/lgbt-purchasing-power-near-1-trillion-rivals-other-minorities LGBT Purchasing Power Near $1 Trillion Rivals Other Minorities], Bloomberg (July 20, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Witeck's analysis determined that the combined buying power of American LGBT adults was $917 billion in 2015, a 3.7% increase from the previous year. This figure approached the combined buying power of other American minority groups, such as [[black American]]s ($1.2 trillion) and [[Hispanic Americans]] ($1.3 trillion), and exceeds that of [[Asian Americans]] ($825 billion).&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;

'''Polish literature''' is the literary tradition of [[Poland]]. Most Polish literature has been written in the [[Polish language]], though other languages used in Poland over the centuries have also contributed to Polish literary traditions, including [[Latin]], [[Yiddish]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[History of the Germans in Poland|German]] and [[Esperanto]]. According to [[Czesław Miłosz]], for centuries Polish literature focused more on drama and poetic self-expression than on fiction (dominant in the English speaking world). The reasons were manifold, but mostly rested on historical circumstances of the nation. Polish writers typically have had a more profound range of choices to motivate them to write, including historical cataclysms of extraordinary violence that swept Poland (as the crossroads of Europe); but also, Poland's own collective incongruities demanding adequate reaction from the writing communities of any given period.&lt;ref name="Miłosz-1"&gt;[[Czesław Miłosz]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=R-MkT9vavwIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  ''The History of Polish Literature.''] Google Books preview. ''[[University of California Press]]'', [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], 1983. {{ISBN|0-520-04477-0}}. {{nowrap|Retrieved October 18, 2011.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polska-1"&gt;[http://en.poland.gov.pl/Culture,483.html  "Experience Poland: Polish culture",] ''"Polska" official promotional website of the Republic of Poland.'' [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], 2008-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish Enlightenment]] began in the 1730s–40s and peaked in the second half of the 18th century. One of the leading Polish Enlightenment authors included [[Ignacy Krasicki]] (1735&amp;ndash;1801) and [[Jan Potocki]] (1761&amp;ndash;1815). [[Polish Romanticism]], unlike [[Romanticism]] elsewhere in Europe, was largely a movement for independence against the foreign occupation. Early Polish Romantics were heavily influenced by other European Romantics. Notable writers included [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Seweryn Goszczyński]], [[Tomasz Zan]] and [[Maurycy Mochnacki]]. In the second period, many Polish Romantics worked abroad. Influential poets included [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Juliusz Słowacki]] and [[Zygmunt Krasiński]].

In the aftermath of the failed [[January Uprising]], the new period of [[Positivism in Poland|Polish Positivism]] began to advocate skepticism and the exercise of reason. The [[modernist]] period known as the [[Young Poland]] movement in visual arts, literature and [[Polish music|music]], came into being around 1890, and concluded with the [[Second Polish Republic|Poland's return to independence]] (1918). Notable authors included [[Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer]], [[Stanisław Przybyszewski]] and [[Jan Kasprowicz]]. The neo-Romantic era was exemplified by the works of [[Stefan Żeromski]], [[Władysław Reymont]], [[Gabriela Zapolska]], and [[Stanisław Wyspiański]]. In 1905 [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]] received a [[Nobel Prize]] in literature for his [[The Trilogy|patriotic Trilogy]] inspiring a new sense of hope. Literature of the [[Second Polish Republic]] (1918-1939) encompasses a short, though exceptionally dynamic period in Polish literary consciousness. The socio-political reality has changed radically with Poland's return to independence. New [[avant-garde]] writers included [[Julian Tuwim|Tuwim]], [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz|Witkacy]], [[Witold Gombrowicz|Gombrowicz]], [[Czesław Miłosz|Miłosz]], [[Maria Dąbrowska|Dąbrowska]] and [[Zofia Nałkowska|Nałkowska]].

In the years of [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|German]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet occupation of Poland]], all artistic life was dramatically compromised. Cultural institutions were lost. Out of 1,500 clandestine publications in Poland, about 200 were devoted to literature. 
Much of Polish literature written during the [[Occupation of Poland]] appeared in print only after the conclusion of World War II, including books by [[Zofia Nałkowska|Nałkowska]], [[Adolf Rudnicki|Rudnicki]], [[Tadeusz Borowski|Borowski]] and others.&lt;ref name="JB-WE" /&gt; The situation began to worsen dramatically around 1949–1950 with the introduction of the [[Socialist realism in Poland|Stalinist doctrine]] by minister [[Włodzimierz Sokorski|Sokorski]]. Poland had three Nobel Prize winning authors in the later 20th century: [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] (1978), [[Czesław Miłosz]] (1980) and [[Wisława Szymborska]] (1996).

==Middle Ages==
Almost{{Explain|date=November 2018|reason="Almost" indicates some pre-966 literature does exist; if that is the case, specify what it is. If it doesn't exist, remove the word "almost"}} nothing remains of Polish literature prior to the [[Baptism of Poland|country's Christianization]] in 966. Poland's [[pagan]] inhabitants certainly possessed an oral literature extending to Slavic songs, legends and beliefs, but early Christian writers did not deem it worthy of mention in the obligatory Latin, and so it has perished.&lt;ref name="Miłosz-1" /&gt;

Within the Polish literary tradition, it is customary to include works that have dealt with [[Poland]], even if not written by ethnic Poles. This is the case with [[Gallus Anonymus]], the first historian to have described Poland in his work entitled ''[[Cronicae et gesta ducum sive principum Polonorum]]'' (Deeds of the Princes of the Poles), composed in sophisticated Latin. Gallus was a foreign [[monk]] who accompanied King [[Bolesław III Wrymouth]] in his return from Hungary to Poland. The important tradition of Polish historiography was continued by [[Wincenty Kadłubek]], a thirteenth-century Bishop of [[Kraków]], as well as [[Jan Długosz]], a Polish priest and secretary to Bishop [[Zbigniew Oleśnicki (cardinal)|Zbigniew Oleśnicki]].&lt;ref name="Miłosz-1" /&gt;

The first recorded sentence in the [[Polish language]] reads: "''Day ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai''" ("Let me grind, and you take a rest") — a [[paraphrase]] of the Latin "''Sine, ut ego etiam molam.''" The work, in which this phrase appeared, reflects the culture of early Poland. The sentence was written within the Latin language chronicle ''[[Liber fundationis]]'' from between 1269 and 1273, a history of the [[Cistercian]] monastery in [[Henryków, Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Henryków]], [[Silesia]]. It was recorded by an abbot known simply as Piotr (Peter), referring to an event almost a hundred years earlier. The sentence was supposedly uttered by a Bohemian settler, Bogwal ("Bogwalus Boemus"), a subject of [[Bolesław the Tall]], expressing compassion for his own wife who "very often stood grinding by the [[quern-stone]]."&lt;ref name="Mikos"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://staropolska.gimnazjum.com.pl/ang/middleages/Mikos_middle/Literary_m.html | title=MIDDLE AGES LITERARY BACKGROUND | last=Mikoś | first=Michael J. | year=1999 | publisher=Staropolska on-line | accessdate=2008-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notable early [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Polish works in Latin and the [[Old Polish language]] include the oldest extant manuscript of fine prose in the [[Polish language]] entitled the ''[[Holy Cross Sermons]]'', as well as the earliest Polish-language ''Bible of Queen Zofia'' and the ''Chronicle of [[Janko of Czarnków]]'' from the 14th century, not to mention the ''Puławy Psalter''.&lt;ref name="Miłosz-1" /&gt;

Most early texts in Polish [[vernacular]] were influenced heavily by the Latin sacred literature. They include ''[[Bogurodzica]]'' (Mother of God), a hymn in praise of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] written down in the 15th century, though popular at least a century earlier. ''Bogurodzica'' served as a national anthem. It was one of the first texts reproduced in Polish on a printing press; and so was the ''Master Polikarp's Conversation with Death'' (Rozmowa mistrza Polikarpa ze śmiercią).&lt;ref name="Miłosz-1" /&gt;

In the early 1470s, one of the first printing houses in Poland was set up by [[Kasper Straube]] in [[Kraków]] (see: [[Global spread of the printing press#Poland|spread of the printing press]]). In 1475 Kasper Elyan of [[Głogów|Glogau (Głogów)]] set up a printing shop in [[Wrocław|Breslau (Wrocław)]], [[Silesia]]. Twenty years later, the first [[Cyrillic]] printing house was founded at Kraków by [[Schweipolt Fiol]] for [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] hierarchs. The most notable texts produced in that period include ''Saint Florian's Breviary,'' printed partially in Polish in the late 14th century; ''Statua synodalia Wratislaviensia'' (1475): a printed collection of Polish and Latin prayers; as well as [[Jan Długosz]]'s ''Chronicle'' from the 15th century and his ''Catalogus archiepiscoporum Gnesnensium''.&lt;ref name="Miłosz-1" /&gt;

== Renaissance ==
With the advent of the [[Renaissance]], the Polish language was finally accepted on an equal footing with Latin. Polish culture and art flourished under [[Jagiellonian dynasty|Jagiellonian]] rule, and many foreign poets and writers settled in Poland, bringing with them new literary trends. Such writers included [[Kallimach]] ([[Filippo Buonaccorsi]]) and [[Conrad Celtis]]. Many Polish writers studied abroad, and at the [[Kraków Academy]], which became a melting pot for new ideas and currents. In 1488 the world's first literary society, the ''[[Sodalitas Litterarum Vistulana]]''  (Vistula Literary Society) was founded in Kraków. Notable members included [[Conrad Celtes]], [[Albert Brudzewski]], [[Filip Callimachus]] and [[Laurentius Corvinus]].&lt;ref name="Miłosz-1" /&gt;

A Polish writer who used [[Latin]] as his principal vehicle of expression was [[Klemens Janicki]] (''Ianicius''), who became one of the most notable Latin poets of his time and was [[Bay laurel|laurel]]ed by the [[Pope]]. Other writers such as [[Mikołaj Rej]],&lt;ref name="polona.pl"&gt;[http://www.polona.pl/dlibra/collectiondescription2?dirids=22 The Mikołaj Rej collection, with biography and body of works. ''National Digital Library'' (Cyfrowa Biblioteka Narodowa ''Polona''), 2006.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903123328/http://www.polona.pl/dlibra/collectiondescription2?dirids=22 |date=2011-09-03 }} {{En icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jan Kochanowski]], laid the foundations for the Polish literary language and modern Polish grammar. The first book written entirely in the [[Polish language]] appeared in this period - It was a [[Breviary|prayer-book]] by [[Biernat of Lublin]] (ca. 1465 – after 1529) called ''Raj duszny'' (''[[Hortulus Animae]]'', Eden of the Soul), printed in [[Kraków]] in  1513 at one of Poland's first printing establishments, operated by [[Florian Ungler]] (originally from [[Bavaria]]).

==Baroque==
The literature in the period of [[Baroque in Poland|Polish Baroque]]&lt;ref name="bookinstitute.pl"&gt;[[Stanisław Barańczak]], [http://www.bookinstitute.pl/en,ik,site,40,81,35.php  Baroque in Polish poetry of the 17th century.] ''Instytut Książki'', Poland. Retrieved September 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; (between 1620 and 1764) was significantly influenced by the great popularization of [[Jesuit]] high schools, which offered education based on [[Latin]] [[classics]] as part of a preparation for a political career. The studies of poetry required the practical knowledge of writing both Latin and Polish poems, which radically increased the number of poets and versifiers countrywide. On the soil of humanistic education some exceptional writers grew as well: Piotr Kochanowski (1566–1620) gave his translation of [[Torquato Tasso]]'s ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]''; [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]], a [[poet laureate]], became known among European nations as ''Horatius christianus '' (Christian [[Horace]]) for his Latin writings; [[Jan Andrzej Morsztyn]] (1621–1693), an epicurean courtier and diplomat, extolled in his sophisticated poems the valors of earthly delights; and [[Wacław Potocki]] (1621–1696), the most productive writer of the Polish Baroque, unified the typical opinions of Polish [[szlachta]] with some deeper reflections and existential experiences. Notable Polish writers and poets active in this period include:

==Enlightenment==
The period of [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish Enlightenment]] began in the 1730s–40s and peaked in the second half of the 18th century during the reign of [[Polish kings|Poland's last king]], [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]].&lt;ref name="bookinstitute.pl-2"&gt;Jacek Adamczyk, book review: [http://www.bookinstitute.pl/en,ik,site,40,79,2480.php  ''Regina Libertas: Liberty in Polish Eighteenth-Century Political Thought'', by Anna Grześkowiak-Krwawicz.] ''Instytut Książki'', Poland. Retrieved September 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It went into sharp decline with the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third and final Partition]] of Poland (1795), followed by political, cultural and economic destruction of the country, and leading to the [[Great Emigration]] of Polish elites. The Enlightenment ended around 1822, and was replaced by [[Romanticism in Poland|Polish Romanticism]] at home and abroad.&lt;ref name="Miłosz-1" /&gt;

One of the leading Polish Enlightenment poets was [[Ignacy Krasicki]] (1735&amp;ndash;1801), known locally as "the Prince of Poets" and [[Fables and Parables|Poland's La Fontaine]], author of the first Polish novel called ''[[The Adventures of Mr. Nicholas Wisdom]]'' (Mikołaja Doświadczyńskiego przypadki); he was also a [[playwright]], [[journalist]], [[encyclopedist]] and [[Translation#History of theory|translator]] from [[French language|French]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Another prominent writer of the period was [[Jan Potocki]] (1761&amp;ndash;1815), a Polish nobleman, [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]], [[linguistics|linguist]], and adventurer, whose travel [[memoir]]s made him legendary in his homeland. Outside Poland he is known chiefly for his novel, ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]],'' which has drawn comparisons to such celebrated works as the ''Decameron'' and ''the Arabian Nights''.

== Romanticism ==
Due to [[Partitions of Poland|partitions]] carried out by the neighboring empires – which ended the existence of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|sovereign Polish state]] in 1795 – [[Polish Romanticism]], unlike [[Romanticism]] elsewhere in Europe, was largely a movement for independence against the foreign occupation, and expressed the ideals and the traditional way of life of the Polish people. The period of Romanticism in Poland ended with the Tsarist suppression of the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]], marked by public executions by the Russians and deportations to Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/russiangovernmen00daywuoft William Ansell Day. The Russian government in Poland : with a narrative of the Polish Insurrection of 1863 (1867)] and [https://archive.org/details/petersburgwarsaw00obriiala Augustin O'Brien Petersburg and Warsaw: scenes witnessed during a residence in Poland and Russia in 1863-1864 (1864)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The literature of Polish [[Romanticism]] falls into two distinct periods, both defined by [[Insurgency|insurgencies]]: the first around 1820–1830, ending with the [[November Uprising]] of 1830; and the second between 1830–1864, giving birth to [[Positivism in Poland|Polish Positivism]]. In the first period, Polish Romantics were heavily influenced by other European Romantics - Their art featured [[emotion]]alism and imagination, [[folklore]], country life, as well as the propagation of the ideals of [[independence]]. The most famous writers of the period were: [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Seweryn Goszczyński]], [[Tomasz Zan]] and [[Maurycy Mochnacki]]. In the second period (after the [[January Uprising]]), many Polish Romantics worked abroad, often banished from the Polish soil by the occupying power. Their work became dominated by the ideals of freedom and the struggle for regaining their country's lost [[sovereignty]]. Elements of mysticism became more prominent. Also in that period, the idea of the ''[[Three Bards|poeta-wieszcz]]'' (nation's bard) developed. The ''wieszcz'' functioned as spiritual leader to the suppressed people. The most notable poet among the [[Three Bards|''leading bards of Romanticism]], so recognized in both periods, was [[Adam Mickiewicz]]. Other two national poets were: [[Juliusz Słowacki]] and [[Zygmunt Krasiński]]. Polish writers and poets of the Romantic period include:

==Positivism==
In the aftermath of the failed [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] against [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] occupation, the new period of [[Positivism in Poland|Polish Positivism]]—which took its name from [[Auguste Comte]]'s [[philosophy]] of [[Positivism]]—advocated [[skepticism]] and the exercise of [[reason]]. Questions addressed by Poland's Positivist writers revolved around "organic work," which included the establishment of [[civil rights|equal rights]] for all members of society, including [[feminism|feminists]]; the [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of Poland's [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish minority]]; and the defense of the Polish population in the German-ruled part of Poland against ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' [[Germanization]] and the [[Prussian deportations|displacement]] of the Polish population by German settlers. The writers worked to educate the public about constructive [[patriotism]], which would enable Polish society to function as a fully integrated "[[social organism]]", regardless of adverse circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[[Czesław Miłosz]], ''The History of Polish Literature'', p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;  Poland's Positivist period lasted until the turn of the 20th century and the advent of the [[Young Poland]] movement. Prominent writers and poets of Polish Positivism included:

==Young Poland (1890-1918)==
The [[modernist]] period known as the [[Young Poland]] movement in visual arts, literature and [[Polish music|music]], came into being around 1890, and concluded with the [[Second Polish Republic|Poland's return to independence]] (1918). The period was based on two concepts. Its early stage was characterized by a strong [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] opposition to the ideals of [[Positivism in Poland|its own predecessor]] (promoting ''organic work'' in the face of foreign occupation). Artists following this early philosophy of Young Poland believed in [[Decadent movement|decadence]], [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], conflict between human values and civilization, and the existence of [[art for art's sake]]. Prominent authors who followed this trend included [[Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer]], [[Stanisław Przybyszewski]] and [[Jan Kasprowicz]]. The later ideology emerged in conjunction with the socio-political upheavals across Europe such as the [[1905 Revolution]] against [[Nicholas II of Russia]], the [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|Norwegian independence]], the [[First Moroccan Crisis|Moroccan Crisis]] and others. It was a continuation of [[Romanticism in Poland|romanticism]], often called neo-romanticism. The artists and writers following this idea covered a large variety of topics: from the sense of personal mission of a [[Poles|Pole]] exemplified by [[Stefan Żeromski]]'s prose, through condemnation of social inequality in works by [[Władysław Reymont]] and [[Gabriela Zapolska]], to criticism of Polish society and Polish revolutionary history by [[Stanisław Wyspiański]]. In 1905 [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]] received a [[Nobel Prize]] in literature for his [[The Trilogy|patriotic Trilogy]] inspiring a new sense of hope. Writers of this period include:&lt;ref name=M-B-D&gt;{{pl icon}} J. Maurin-Białostocka, J. Derwojed, ''Słownik artystów polskich i obcych w Polsce działających.''

==Interbellum (1918–39)==
Literature of the [[Second Polish Republic]] (1918-1939) encompasses a short, though exceptionally dynamic period in Polish literary consciousness. The socio-political reality has changed radically with Poland's return to independence. In large part, derivative of these changes was the collective and unobstructed development of programs for artists and writers. New [[avant-garde]] trends had emerged. The period, spanning just twenty years, was full of notable individualities who saw themselves as exponents of changing European civilization, including [[Julian Tuwim|Tuwim]], [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz|Witkacy]], [[Witold Gombrowicz|Gombrowicz]], [[Czesław Miłosz|Miłosz]], [[Maria Dąbrowska|Dąbrowska]] and [[Zofia Nałkowska|Nałkowska]] ([[Polish Academy of Literature|PAL]]). They all contributed to a new model of the twentieth-century Polish culture echoing its own language of everyday life.&lt;ref name="klp.pl-1"&gt;[http://dwudziestolecie-miedzywojenne.klp.pl/ser-684.html  "Główne gatunki literackie uprawiane w dwudziestoleciu międzywojennym."] ''Kulturalna Polska.'' {{Pl icon}} Retrieved September 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dwutygodnik.com"&gt;Prof. Marian Stala of [[Jagiellonian University]], [http://www.dwutygodnik.com/artykul/284-1989-dwa-dwudziestolecia-jednej-epoki.html  1989: Dwa dwudziestolecia (jednej epoki).] ''Dwutygodnik Literatura''.

The two decades of [[Interbellum]] were marked by rapid development in the field of poetry, undivided and undiminished for the first time in over a century. From 1918 to 1939, the gradual and successive introduction of new ideas resulted in the formation of separate and distinct trends. The first decade of Polish interwar poetry was clear, constructive, and optimistic; as opposed to the second decade marked by dark visions of the impending war, internal conflicts within the Polish society, and growing pessimism. The whole period was amazingly rich nevertheless. In 1933 the [[Polish Academy of Literature]] (PAL) was founded by a decree of the Council of Ministers of the Republic ([[Rada Ministrów]] RP); as the highest opinion-forming authority in the country; it awarded Gold and the Silver Laurels (Złoty, and Srebrny Wawrzyn), the two highest national honors for contributions to literature until [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="Lerski-451"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QTUTqE2difgC&amp;pg=PA451&amp;dq=%22Polish+Academy+of+Literature%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4WHdTuOqE5TSiALn7rXQAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CGIQuwUwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Polish%20Academy%20of%20Literature%22&amp;f=false |title=Historical dictionary of Poland, 966-1945 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1996 |accessdate=December 5, 2011 |author=[[Jerzy Jan Lerski]], Piotr Wróbel, Richard J.

The literary life of his contemporaries revolved mostly around the issues of independence. All Polish poets treated the concept of freedom with extreme seriousness, and many patriotic works had emerged at that time, not to mention a particular variant of a poetic cult of [[Józef Piłsudski|Piłsudski]].

==World War II==
In the years of [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|German]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet occupation of Poland]], all artistic life was dramatically compromised. Cultural institutions were lost. The environment was chaotic, and the writers scattered: some found themselves in concentration and labor camps (or [[Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland|Nazi-era ghettos]]), others were deported out of the country; some emigrated ([[Julian Tuwim|Tuwim]], [[Kazimierz Wierzyński|Wierzyński]]), many more joined the ranks of the Polish underground resistance movement ([[Krzysztof Kamil Baczyński|Baczyński]], [[Tadeusz Borowski|Borowski]], [[Tadeusz Gajcy|Gajcy]]). All literary outlets were forced to cease operation. Writers who remained at home began organizing literary life in conspiracy, including lectures, evenings of poetry, and secret meetings in the homes of writers and art facilitators. Polish cities where such meetings were held most frequently were: [[Warsaw]], [[Kraków]] and [[Lwów]]. Writers participated in setting-up of the underground presses (out of 1,500 clandestine publications in Poland, about 200 were devoted to literature). Many fought in the Polish army in exile or resisted the [[The Holocaust in Poland|Holocaust]] in a civil capacity. The generation of the ''Kolumbs,'' born around 1920, were active during the [[Warsaw Uprising]].&lt;ref name="streszczenia.pl"&gt;[http://streszczenia.pl/epoka/literatura-ii-wojny-swiatowej/  Literatura II wojny światowej.

==1945–56==
All texts published under Soviet rules were strictly censored.
Much of Polish literature written during the [[Occupation of Poland]] appeared in print only after the conclusion of World War II, including books by [[Zofia Nałkowska|Nałkowska]], [[Adolf Rudnicki|Rudnicki]], [[Tadeusz Borowski|Borowski]] and others.&lt;ref name="JB-WE" /&gt; The Soviet takeover of the country did not discourage [[Émigré]]s and exiles from returning, especially before the advent of [[Stalinism in Poland|Stalinism]]. Indeed, many writers attempted to recreate the Polish literary scene, often with a touch of nostalgia for the prewar reality, including [[Jerzy Andrzejewski]], author of ''[[Ashes and Diamonds]]'', describing (accoording to Communist design) [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944–1946)|Anti-communist resistance in Poland]]. His novel was adapted into film a decade later by [[Andrzej Wajda|Wajda]]. The new emerging prose writers such as [[Stanisław Dygat]] and [[Stefan Kisielewski]] approached the catastrophe of war from their own perspective. [[Kazimierz Wyka]] coined a term "borderline novel" for documentary fiction.&lt;ref name="JB-WE"&gt;Jean Albert Bédé, William Benbow Edgerton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2_JLL32RzrkC&amp;lpg=PA634&amp;dq=%22Jerzy%20Andrzejewski%22&amp;pg=PA632#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jerzy%20Andrzejewski%22&amp;f=false  ''Columbia dictionary of modern European literature.''] Page 632.

The situation began to worsen dramatically around 1949–1950 with the introduction of the [[Socialist realism in Poland|Stalinist doctrine]] by minister [[Włodzimierz Sokorski|Sokorski]], on behalf of the increasingly violent [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|Communist regime]], which engaged in gross violations of [[human rights]].&lt;ref name="JB-WE" /&gt; In the years 1944–1956, around 300,000 Polish citizens were arrested, of whom many thousands were sentenced to long-term imprisonment. There were 6,000 death sentences pronounced against political prisoners, the majority of them carried out "in the majesty of the law".&lt;ref name="ipn.gov.pl-2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ipn.gov.pl/portal/pl/2/1002/Otwarcie_wystawy_8222Zbrodnie_w_majestacie_prawa_1944821119568221_8211_Krakow_2_.html | title=Otwarcie wystawy "Zbrodnie w majestacie prawa 1944–1956" – Kraków, 2 lutego 2006 | publisher=''[[Instytut Pamięci Narodowej]]'' | accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing for their proper jobs, many writers associated with the [[Jerzy Borejsza|Borejsza's]] publishing empire embraced the Sovietization of Polish culture.&lt;ref name="Kott"&gt;Jan Kott, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yx2C8o-fiK8C&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=%22Jerzy+Borejsza%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=zl76SZrBKafmygT3zeDBBQ#PPA172,M1 ''Still Alive: An Autobiographical Essay'', p.172-173.] ''Yale University Press'', 1994, {{ISBN|0-300-10561-4}}, Google Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 the ZLP Union, run by [[Leon Kruczkowski|Kruczkowski]] with a slew of prominent signatories, declared full support to persecution of religious leaders by the [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|Ministry of Public Security]].

'''Prague German''' (German: ''Prager Deutsch'', [[Czech language|Czech]]: ''Pražská němčina'') was the [[dialect]] of German spoken in [[Prague]] in what is now the [[Czech Republic]]. The written form of this dialect from the [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg rule]] played an important role in the history of the German language for its balancing function between the written [[Upper German|upper]] [[Austrian German|Austrian]] and [[southern Germany|southern German]] dialects and eastern [[Central German|Central]] dialects of [[Central Germany (geography)|central Germany]], which later developed the spelling of Modern German writing ([[Standard German|Hochdeutsch]]).

== History ==
In the historical development of Prague, there were four periods, which were culturally and linguistically autonomous.&lt;ref&gt;SKÁLA, Emil. Das Prager Deutsch. In: Zeitschrift für deutsche Sprache 22, 1966, page 156-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== List of periods ===
* First period (1310–1415), the period of the [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] rule. Linguistic phenomena approaching [[Middle High German]] spelling.
* Second period (1544–1620), after the Hussite period. At this time, the Prague German was greatly influenced by [[Czech language|Czech]] and lesser than the [[Upper German]].&lt;ref&gt;SKÁLA, Emil. Zum Prager Deutsch des 16. Jahrhunderts. In: BACKERS, Herbert: ''Festschrift für Hans Eggers zum 65 Geburtstag. Beiträge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und Literatur 94 (Sonderheft)''. Tübingen 1972, page 284-285.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Third period (1620–1860), after 1627, Prague German language evolved in its written form towards the Austrian variant. Spelling has not been normative yet, so there were fluctuations in voice and vocal quality.&lt;ref&gt;POVEJŠIL, Jaromír. ''Das Prager Deutsch des 17. und 18. Jahrhunderts: ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der deutschen Schriftsprache''. Praha: Academia, 1980. Rozpravy ČSAV. Řada společenských věd; 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fourth period (1861–1945), at the end of the 19th century, the Prague German was considered the best German of the [[Austro hungarian monarchy|Austro-Hungarian monarchy]]. This language was mainly used by educated layers, which considered Saxony German rather than Austrian German. In 1910 there were only 4.5% of the German-speaking population in Prague, yet there was a world-famous literature. Writers such as [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Max Brod]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Egon Erwin Kisch]], [[Friedrich Torberg]], [[Oskar Baum]], [[Johannes Urzidil]], [[Felix Weltsch]] and [[Paul Leppin]] by some Germanists using a specific style, rather than to the Prague German refers to the literary patterns.

== A sample of the text in Prague German from fourth period ==
* ''"Wissen Sie schon, Frau Krause, daß meine Tontscha sich mit dem jungen Janda verlobt hat?"''
* ''"Der, was Beamter bei der Unionbank ist? Da gratulier ich aber! Wissen Sie, geahnt habe ich es schon längst; denn man hat ihn nie ohne ihr gesehen und sie hat keinen Schritt ohne ihm gemacht."''
* ''"Ja, die beiden haben sich furchtbar gern. ''"''Frau Rößler''"'', hat er zu mir gesagt, ''"''glauben Sie ja nicht, daß ich Ihre Tochter nur wegen dem Gelde heirate, das sie mitbekomt''"'', hat er gesagt."''
* ''"Das ist ein schöner Zug von ihm! Und nur was wahr is': ein fescher Mann is' er!"''
* ''"Gewiß. Aber warum, meine Tonscha ist kein hübsches Mädel? Wissen Sie, gestern, da hat sie sich den neuen Hut angezogen, ich sag' Ihnen: eine Puppe! Und gescheit is' sie! Und gebildet! Und häuslich erzogen! Alles habe ich ihr gelernt: kochen, nähen, bügeln alles! Sogar Klavier spielen kann sie.“''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno?aid=ptb&amp;datum=19170815&amp;seite=3&amp;zoom=33|title=ANNO, Prager Tagblatt, 1917-08-15, Seite 3|last=Nationalbibliothek|first=Österreichische|website=anno.onb.ac.at|language=de|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12736">In [[psychology]], '''prospection''' is the generation and evaluation of mental representations of possible futures. The term therefore captures a wide array of future-oriented psychological phenomena, including the prediction of future emotion ([[affective forecasting]]), the imagination of future scenarios (episodic foresight), and [[planning]]. Prospection is central to various aspects of human [[cognition]] and [[motivation]]. [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)]] and [[Timothy Wilson]] coined the term in 2007.&lt;ref name=pmid17823345 "Prospection: Experiencing the Future"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilbert DT, Wilson TD | title = Prospection: Experiencing the future | journal = Science | volume = 317 | issue = 5843 | pages = 1351-1354 | date = Sep 2007 | pmid = 17823345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since become a central area of enquiry in the [[cognitive sciences]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seligman |first1=Martin E.

== Prospection and learning ==

Even fundamental [[learning]] processes are, in some sense, forms of prospection &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suddendorf |first1=Thomas |last2=Corballis |first2=Michael C. |title=The evolution of foresight: What is mental time travel, and is it unique to humans? |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |date=29 October 2007 |volume=30 |issue=03 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X07001975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gilbert |first1=D. T. |last2=Wilson |first2=T. D. |title=Prospection: Experiencing the Future |journal=Science |date=7 September 2007 |volume=317 |issue=5843 |pages=1351–1354 |doi=10.1126/science.1144161}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Associative learning]] enables individual animals to track local regularities in their environments and adapt their behaviour accordingly, in order to maximise their chances of positive outcomes and minimise risks. Animals that are capable of positive and negative states (for example pleasure and pain) can eventually learn about the consequences of their actions and thereby predict imminent rewards and punishments before they occur. This enables animals to change their current actions accordingly in line with prospective consequences. 

== Relationship with mental time travel ==
{{Main|Mental time travel}}

[[Mental time travel]] refers to the ability to mentally reconstruct personal events from the past (known as [[episodic memory]]), as well as to imagine personal future events (known as episodic foresight). Mental time travel into the future (episodic foresight or episodic future thinking) is therefore one of several types of ‘prospection’ that refers to the capacity to simulate or imagine personal future events &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suddendorf |first1=T. |last2=Corballis |first2=M. C. |title=Mental time travel and the evolution of the human mind |journal=Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs |date=1997 |volume=123 |issue=2 |pages=133–167 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9204544 |issn=8756-7547}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szpunar |first1=Karl K. |last2=Spreng |first2=R. Nathan |last3=Schacter |first3=Daniel L. |title=A taxonomy of prospection: Introducing an organizational framework for future-oriented cognition: Fig. 1. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=30 December 2014 |volume=111 |issue=52 |pages=18414–18421 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1417144111}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Examples of the functions of prospection ==

=== Episodic foresight === 
{{Main|Foresight (psychology)}}
Episodic foresight is the capacity to imagine personal future scenarios and shape current action accordingly &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suddendorf |first1=Thomas |last2=Moore |first2=Chris |title=Introduction to the special issue: The development of episodic foresight |journal=Cognitive Development |date=October 2011 |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=295–298 |doi=10.1016/j.cogdev.2011.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Predicting future emotions (affective forecasting) ===
{{Main|Affective forecasting}}
	
The feelings evoked during episodic foresight enable people to infer how they would really feel if the event were to happen in reality. This thereby enables people to anticipate whether future events are desirable or undesirable, and ability called ‘[[affective forecasting]]’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=Timothy D. |last2=Gilbert |first2=Daniel T. |title=Affective Forecasting |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |date=23 June 2016 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=131–134 |doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00355.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Prospective intentions ===
{{Main|Prospective memory}}
	
Simulating the future enables people to create intentions for future actions. [[Prospective memory]] is the form of memory that involves remembering to perform these planned intentions, or to recall them at some future point in time &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Einstein |first1=Gilles O. |last2=McDaniel |first2=Mark A. |title=Normal aging and prospective memory. |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |date=1990 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=717–726 |doi=10.1037/0278-7393.16.4.717}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Prospective memory tasks are common in everyday life, ranging from remembering to post a letter to remembering to take one’s medication. 

=== Deliberate practice ===
{{Main|Practice (learning method)}}

People anticipate that it is possible to shape their future self. To acquire new knowledge or additional skills, people therefore engage in repeated actions driven by the goal to improve these future capacities. This deliberate practice is essential not only for elite performance but also in the acquirement of numerous everyday feats. 

=== Flexible decision-making ===
{{Main|Intertemporal choice}}

[[Intertemporal choice|Intertemporal choices]] are choices with outcomes that play out over time &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berns |first1=Gregory S. |last2=Laibson |first2=David |last3=Loewenstein |first3=George |title=Intertemporal choice – toward an integrative framework |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |date=November 2007 |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=482–488 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2007.08.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Such decisions are ubiquitous in everyday life, ranging from routine decisions about what to eat for lunch (i.e. whether to adhere to a diet) to more profound decisions about [[climate change]] (i.e. whether to reduce current energy expenditure to avoid delayed costs). The ability to imagine future scenarios and adjust decisions accordingly may be important for making intertemporal choices in a flexible manner that accords with delayed consequences. Accumulating evidence suggests that cuing people to imagine the future in vivid detail can encourage preferences for delayed outcomes over immediate ones &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bulley |first1=Adam |last2=Henry |first2=Julie |last3=Suddendorf |first3=Thomas |title=Prospection and the present moment: The role of episodic foresight in intertemporal choices between immediate and delayed rewards. |journal=Review of General Psychology |date=2016 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=29–47 |doi=10.1037/gpr0000061}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rung |first1=Jillian M. |last2=Madden |first2=Gregory J. |title=Experimental reductions of delay discounting and impulsive choice: A systematic review and meta-analysis. |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General |date=September 2018 |volume=147 |issue=9 |pages=1349–1381 |doi=10.1037/xge0000462}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This has been extended into real-world decisions such as in reducing the consumption of high-calorie food &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dassen |first1=Fania C.M. |last2=Jansen |first2=Anita |last3=Nederkoorn |first3=Chantal |last4=Houben |first4=Katrijn |title=Focus on the future: Episodic future thinking reduces discount rate and snacking |journal=Appetite |date=January 2016 |volume=96 |pages=327–332 |doi=10.1016/j.appet.2015.09.032}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increasing pro-environmental behaviours&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Pei-Shan |last2=Sung |first2=Yu-Hsien |last3=Wu |first3=Chia-Chun |last4=Ho |first4=Liang-Chu |last5=Chiou |first5=Wen-Bin |title=Using Episodic Future Thinking to Pre-Experience Climate Change Increases Pro-Environmental Behavior |journal=Environment and Behavior |date=26 July 2018 |pages=001391651879059 |doi=10.1177/0013916518790590}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Clinical impairment == 

In recent years there have been a range of investigations into variation in prospection and its functions in clinical populations. Deficits to the mechanisms and functions of prospection have been observed in [[Alzheimer’s disease]] and other age-related [[dementias]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Irish |first1=Muireann |last2=Piolino |first2=Pascale |title=Impaired capacity for prospection in the dementias - Theoretical and clinical implications |journal=British Journal of Clinical Psychology |date=March 2016 |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=49–68 |doi=10.1111/bjc.12090}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Schizophrenia]], and after brain damage (especially to the [[medial temporal lobe|medial temporal lobes]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Henry |first1=Julie D. |last2=Addis |first2=Donna Rose |last3=Suddendorf |first3=Thomas |last4=Rendell |first4=Peter G. |title=Introduction to the Special Issue: Prospection difficulties in clinical populations |journal=British Journal of Clinical Psychology |date=March 2016 |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=1–3 |doi=10.1111/bjc.12108}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Shifts in the content and modes of prospection have been observed in [[affective disorders]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacLeod |first1=Andrew |title=Prospection, well-being and memory |journal=Memory Studies |date=30 June 2016 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=266–274 |doi=10.1177/1750698016645233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roepke |first1=Ann Marie |last2=Seligman |first2=Martin E.

For example, in both clinical [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]] there is an overrepresentation of possible negative future events. In depression, there is additionally a reduction in the generation of possible positive future events.

'''Rangiputangatahi Mawhete''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|OBE|size=85%}} (4 March 1880 &amp;ndash; 24 July 1961), born as '''William Arthur Moffatt''' and commonly known as '''Rangi Mawhete''', was a New Zealand  land agent, interpreter and politician. 

==Early life==
Of [[Māori people|Māori]] descent, he identified with the [[Muaūpoko]] and [[Rangitāne]] [[iwi]].

[[File:Straßendorf.svg|thumb|Example of a ribbon development]]
[[File:Dubiny fragment wsi 12.07.2009 p.jpg|thumb|Polish village Dubiny, example of an old ribbon village]]
'''Ribbon development''' is building houses along the routes of communications radiating from a human settlement. Such development generated great concern in the [[United Kingdom]] during the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trumpingtonlocalhistorygroup.org/timeline_20Cearly.html|title=Trumpington Local History Group, Trumpington Timeline: 1901 - 1950|website=www.trumpingtonlocalhistorygroup.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1930s as well as in numerous other countries.

Normally and the very first ribbons are focussed on roads. Following the [[Industrial Revolution]], ribbon development became prevalent along [[railway]] lines: predominantly in [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. However the cost of building stations, their attraction and need for accompanying roads usually led to new small urban centres and broader settlements. Ribbon development created great attractiveness on isolated roads as increasing [[motor car]] ownership meant that houses could be sold easily even if they were remote from workplaces and urban centres. It was attractive to developers because they did not have to waste money or plot space constructing roads. It also enabled spaces at the interstice between several urban areas appealing to potential buyers needing to access either or many of these.

The extent of the practice around roads led to its problems becoming intense and recognition as an inefficient use of resources, requiring bypass roads to be built, and often a precursor to untrammelled [[urban sprawl]], so a key aim for the United Kingdom's [[town and country planning in the United Kingdom|post-war planning system]] was to implement a presumption and convention that proposed new ribbon development is inappropriate. Urban sprawl/suburbanisation of large areas led to the introduction of [[green belt]] policies, new towns, planned suburbs and garden cities.

==History==
Following the [[Industrial Revolution]], ribbon development became prevalent along [[railway]] lines: predominantly in [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. A good example of this was the deliberate promotion of [[Metro-land]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~gsgleaves/london7.htm MetroLand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401220840/http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~gsgleaves/london7.htm |date=2012-04-01 }}.

Similar evidence can be found from [[Long Island]] (where Frederick W Dunton bought much real estate to encourage [[New York City|New York]]ers to settle along the [[Long Island Rail Road]] lines),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dunton.org/archive/LongIslandRailroad.htm Long Island Railroad History Page - The Dunton Archive].

It can also occur along [[ridge]] lines, [[canal]]s and [[coastline]]s, the last occurring especially as people seeking [[seachange (demography)|seachange]] lifestyles build their houses where they can get the best view.

The resulting towns and cities are often difficult to service efficiently. Often, the first problems noticed by residents is [[traffic congestion]], as people compete to move along the narrow urban corridor while ever more people join the ribbon further along the corridor. [[Urban consolidation]] is often a solution to encourage growth towards a more compact urban form.

Ribbon development can also be compared with a [[linear village]], a village that grew along a transportation route, not as part of a city's expansion.

Ribbon development has long been viewed as an especial problem in the [[Republic of Ireland]], where "[[One-off housing|one-off houses]]" proliferate on rural roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=_I5_zN9Uqa8C&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=ribbon+development+ireland&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_ivXehtvZAhULIMAKHT3TCosQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=ribbon+development+ireland&amp;f=false|title=Ireland Unbound: A Turn of the Century Chronicle|first1=Michel|last1=Peillon|first2=Mary P.|last2=Corcoran|date=7 March 2018|publisher=Institute of Public Administration|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes difficulties in the efficient supply of water, [[sewerage]], [[broadband]], electricity, telephones and [[public transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=Xc-d1qxTg9AC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=ribbon+development+ireland&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_ivXehtvZAhULIMAKHT3TCosQ6AEITzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=ribbon+development+ireland&amp;f=false|title=Ireland|first=Catharina|last=Day|date=7 March 2018|publisher=New Holland Publishers|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/regionals/fingalindependent/news/housing-limit-to-prevent-ribbon-development-on-rural-roadsides-27805632.html|title=Housing limit to prevent 'ribbon development' on rural roadsides - Independent.ie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Frank McDonald contrasted development in the Republic with that in [[Northern Ireland]]: ''"[[Enniskillen]] [''in Northern Ireland''] is well defined with clear boundaries to the town and well-laid-out shopping streets.

'''Robert Henry Lawrence Phillipson''' (born 18 March 1942 in [[Gourock]], [[Scotland]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albumacademicum.uva.nl/ R.H.L. Phillipson, 1942 -] at the University of Amsterdam ''Album Academicum'' website.&lt;/ref&gt; is Research Professor at [[Copenhagen Business School]]'s Department of English. He is perhaps best known for writing ''[[Linguistic Imperialism]]'' and ''[[English-Only Europe?]]: Challenging Language Policy'' (translated in [[Esperanto]] by István Ertl: ''Ĉu nur-angla Eŭropo? Defio al lingva politiko''). He graduated as an undergraduate from Cambridge University

He got his PhD from the [[University of Amsterdam]] and his interests include [[language pedagogy]], [[language policy]], and [[linguistic human rights]].

On 21 February 2010, Phillipson was awarded the [[Linguapax Prize]] along with [[Miquel Siguan i Soler]]. [[Linguapax Institute]] describes them as "renowned advocates of multilingual education as a factor of peace and of linguistic rights against cultural and linguistic homogenization processes". &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linguapax.org/en/news/2010/02/21/miquel-siguan-and-robert-phillipson-linguapax-award-2010-ex-aequo "Linguapax Award 2010"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613050334/http://www.linguapax.org/en/news/2010/02/21/miquel-siguan-and-robert-phillipson-linguapax-award-2010-ex-aequo |date=13 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{SpecialChars}}
The '''Samaritan alphabet''' is used by the [[Samaritan]]s for religious writings, including the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]], writings in [[Samaritan Hebrew]], and for commentaries and translations in [[Samaritan Aramaic language|Samaritan Aramaic]] and occasionally [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

{{alphabet}}
Samaritan is a direct descendant of the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]], which was a variety of the [[Phoenician alphabet]] in which large parts of the [[Hebrew Bible]] were originally penned. All these scripts are believed to be descendants of the [[Proto-Sinaitic script]]. That script was used by the ancient [[Israelites]], both [[Jews]] and Samaritans. The better-known "square script" [[Hebrew alphabet]] traditionally used by Jews is a stylized version of the [[Aramaic alphabet]] called "Assyrian writing" (כתב אשורי) which they adopted from the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] (which in turn adopted it from the [[Arameans]]). After the fall of the Persian Empire, Judaism used both scripts before settling on the Aramaic form. For a limited time thereafter, the use of paleo-Hebrew (proto-Samaritan) among Jews was retained only to write the [[Tetragrammaton]], but soon that custom was also abandoned.

The Samaritan alphabet first became known to the Western world with the publication of a manuscript of the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] in 1631 by [[Jean Morin (theologian)|Jean Morin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IOAtAAAAYAAJ Exercitationes ecclesiasticae in utrumque Samaritanorum Pentateuchum], 1631&lt;/ref&gt; In 1616 the traveler [[Pietro della Valle]] had purchased a copy of the text in [[Damascus]], and this manuscript, now known as Codex B, was deposited in a [[Paris]]ian library.{{sfn| Flôrenṭîn|2005|p=1|ps=: "When the Samaritan version of the Pentateuch was revealed to the Western world early in the 17th century... [footnote: 'In 1632 the Frenchman Jean Morin published the Samaritan Pentateuch in the Parisian Biblia Polyglotta based on a manuscript that the traveler Pietro Della Valle had bought from Damascus sixteen years previously.]"}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8104">A '''secure signature creation device''' is a specific type of computer hardware or software that is used in creating an [[electronic signature]]. To be put into service as a secure signature creation device (SSCD), the device must meet the rigorous requirements laid out under Annex II of [[eIDAS|Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 (eIDAS)]], where it is referred to as a [[qualified electronic signature]] creation device. Using secure signature creation devices helps in facilitating online [[business processes]] that save time and money with transactions made within the [[Public sector|public]] and [[private sector]]s.&lt;ref name="Turner-SSCD"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=What is a secure signature creation device|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/secure-signature-creation-device|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuner_Understanding eIDAS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn|title=Understanding eIDAS|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/understanding-eidas|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="eIDAS-EUR-Lex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG|website=EUR-Lex|publisher=The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The minimum requirements that must be met to elevate an electronic signature creation device to the level of a secure signature creation device are provided in Annex II of eIDAS. Through appropriate procedural and technical means, the device must reasonably assure the confidentiality of the data used to create an electronic signature. It further must ensure that the data used to create an electronic signature is unique and only used once. Lastly it shall only allow a [[Trust service provider|qualified trust service provider]] or [[certificate authority]] to create or manage a signatory’s [[electronic signature]] data.&lt;ref name="Tuner_Understanding eIDAS" /&gt;

To ensure security, signature creation data used by the SSCD to create an electronic signature must provide reasonable protection through current technology to prevent forgery or duplication of the signature. The creation data must remain under the sole control of its [[signatory]] to prevent unauthorized use. The SSCD itself is prohibited from altering the signature’s accompanying data.&lt;ref name="Turner-SSCD" /&gt;

When a trust service provider or certificate authority places an SSCD into service, they must securely prepare the device according to Annex II of eIDAS in fully compliance to the following three conditions:&lt;ref name="ETSI-SSCD"&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures: Policy requirements for certification authorities issuing qualified certificates|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/101400_101499/101456/01.04.03_60/ts_101456v010403p.pdf|publisher=European Telecommunications Standards Institute|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-SSCD" /&gt;
# While in use or in storage, the SSCD must remain secure.
# Further, a reactivation and deactivation of the SSCD must occur under secure conditions.
# Any user activation data, include [[Personal identification number|PIN codes]] be delivered separately from the SSCD after being prepared securely.

==International security assurance requirements for SSCDs==

The secure signature creation device must also meet the international standard for computer security certification, referred to as the [[Common Criteria|Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation]] (ISO/IEC 15408).&lt;ref name="ISO15408"&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO/IEC 15408-1:2009  Information technology -- Security techniques -- Evaluation criteria for IT security -- Part 1: Introduction and general model|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50341|publisher=International Organization for Standardization (ISO)|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard gives computer system users the ability to specify security requirements via Protection Profiles (PPs) for security functional requirements (SFRs) and security assurance requirements (SARs).&lt;ref name="Turner-SSCD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eIDAS-EUR-Lex" /&gt; The trust service provider or certificate authority is the required to implement the specified requirements and attest to their product’s security attributes. A third-party testing laboratory then evaluates the device to ensure that the level of security is as claimed by the provider.&lt;ref name="Turner-TrustServiceProviders"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Trust service providers according to eIDAS|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/trust-service-providers-according-to-eidas|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central authentication service==

When a secure signature creation device is used as part of a central authentication service (CAS), it may act as a CAS server in multi-tier authentication scenarios. The CAS software protocol allows users to be authenticated when signing into a web application.

The common scheme for a CAS protocol includes the client’s web browser, an application requesting authentication and the CAS server. When authentication is needed, the application will send a request to the CAS server. The server will then compare the user’s credentials against its database. If the information matches, the CAS will respond that the user has been authenticated.&lt;ref name="Turner-SSCD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eIDAS-EUR-Lex" /&gt;

==Legal implications regarding secure signature creation devices==

eIDAS has provided a tiered approach to determining the legal implications of electronic signatures. A signature that has been created with a secure signature creation device is considered to have the strongest [[Relevance (law)|probative value]]. A document or message that has been signed with such a device is [[non-repudiation|non-reputable]], meaning the signatory cannot deny they are responsible for the creation of the signature.&lt;ref name="Tuner_Understanding eIDAS" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16519">The '''Shaughnessy playoff system''' is a method of determining the champion of a sports league that is not in a divisional alignment. This format is also known as the [[Argus finals system]]. It involves the participation of the top four teams in the league standings in a [[single elimination tournament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/12-02-398.pdf Nothing Minor About It: The American Association/AFL of 1936-1950] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326042625/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/12-02-398.pdf |date=2012-03-26 }} - Bob Gill, Pro Football Researchers Association (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.triple-abaseball.com/PostSeasonIL.jsp International League Governors' Cup Championship] - from official AAA baseball website&lt;/ref&gt; While the first round of the playoffs involve the pairing of the first- and fourth-place teams in one contest (whether it be a single game or a series of games) and the second- and third-place teams in the other,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/10-04-343.pdf “It’s a Minor Thing”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127053144/http://profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/10-04-343.pdf |date=2010-11-27 }} – Steven Brainerd, Professional Football Researchers Association (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; a variant of the Shaughnessy playoffs would pair the first- and third-place teams in one semifinal round and the second- and fourth-place teams in the other. In either variant, the winners of the first two games would then compete for the league championship. Some lower-level leagues use a Shaughnessy playoff for purposes of [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the next-higher league.

Another variant of the Shaughnessy system exempts a certain number of top teams from the playoffs (usually one to three teams) and instead involves the next four teams in the league standings. This variation is almost always used by a lower-level league for promotion purposes. Typically, the exempted top finishers earn automatic promotion and the playoffs determine the final promotion place.

==History and usage==

===North America===
The Shaughnessy playoff system was implemented in 1933 by [[Frank Shaughnessy]], the [[general manager]] of the [[Montreal Royals]] [[minor league]] [[baseball]] team of the [[International League]]. After its successful implementation by the International League, the popularity of the new postseason format spread to other leagues in other sports, including the [[All-America Football Conference]] (which used the Shaughnessy playoff system in the league's last season of existence)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/02-07-035.pdf All-America Football Conference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119163642/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/02-07-035.pdf |date=2013-01-19 }} - Stan Grosshandler, Professional Football Researchers Association (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; and the minor American football league [[American Association (football)|American Association]], which used the format in five of its championship seasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/12-02-398.pdf Nothing Minor About It: The American Association/AFL of 1936-1950] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326042625/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/12-02-398.pdf |date=2012-03-26 }} - Bob Gill, Pro Football Researchers Association (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; The format has also been widely used in minor league baseball on all levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fieldofdreams.sabr.org/book/1950sThreeI-MWL.pdf The Rise of the Midwest League and the Decline of the Three-I League] - Tim Rask, Society for American Baseball Research (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Original Six era]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (1942-1967), the circuit adopted a Shaughnessy playoff system (first place ''vs.'' third place and second place ''vs.'' fourth place) in which the paired teams played in a [[playoff format#Best-of-seven playoff|best-four-of-seven-games series]] with the winners advancing to the [[Stanley Cup|Stanley Cup championship]] round. A Shaughnessy-style format is used in today's NHL in an entirely different context—since [[61st National Hockey League All-Star Game|2016]], the [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] has been contested as a four-team knockout tournament, with each team drawn exclusively from one of the league's four divisions. Each "game" is played in a three-on-three format (i.e., three skaters and one goaltender, unless affected by penalties) over a single 20-minute period (the same length of a period in a regular NHL game).

Since its first season in [[2013 National Women's Soccer League season|2013]], the [[National Women's Soccer League]] has used a Shaughnessy playoff (using 1–4 and 2–3 semifinal pairings)  to determine its champion.

In [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[college basketball]], one [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] conference uses a Shaughnessy playoff for its postseason tournaments for men and women. The [[Ivy League]] launched postseason tournaments for both sexes in the 2016–17 season; the top four teams in the regular-season conference standings advance to a Shaughnessy tournament (also using 1–4 and 2–3 semifinal pairings) at a predetermined site. The winners receive the Ivies' automatic berths in the NCAA [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|men's]] and [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|women's]] tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://ivyleaguesports.com/information/general_releases/2015-16/releases/The_Ivy_League_Adds_Mens-Womens_Basketball_Tournaments_Beginning_in_2017 |title=The Ivy League Adds Men's, Women's Basketball Tournaments Beginning in 2017 |publisher=Ivy League |date=March 10, 2016 |accessdate=September 11, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311041901/http://ivyleaguesports.com/information/general_releases/2015-16/releases/The_Ivy_League_Adds_Mens-Womens_Basketball_Tournaments_Beginning_in_2017 |archivedate=March 11, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
More recently, the Shaughnessy playoff system has been adopted outside of North America. In [[Rugby union in England|English]] [[rugby union]], the format is currently used to determine the winner of the [[Premiership Rugby|Premiership]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiershiprugby.com/premiership/competitions/aviva_premiership_rugby.php#.UaOZOmTcrC4 |title=Aviva Premiership Rugby |publisher=Premiership Rugby Limited |accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from [[2012–13 RFU Championship|2012–13]] through to [[2016–17 RFU Championship|2016–17]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.premiershiprugby.com/news/play-off-system-removed-from-greene-king-ipa-championship-from-next-season/ |title=Play-off system removed from Greene King IPA Championship from next season |publisher=Premiership Rugby Limited |date=3 March 2017 |accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was also used in the second-level [[RFU Championship]] to determine the team to be promoted to the Premiership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/18102034 |title=Championship: RFU to abolish play-off pool stages |publisher=''BBC Sport'' |date=2012-05-17 |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Premiership and Championship formats differ only in the number of games contested—the Premiership playoff uses one-off matches, while all matches in the Championship playoff were two-legged. The [[Premier 15s]], launched in autumn 2017 as the new top flight of English women's rugby, uses the same playoff format as the Premiership. The Celtic League in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]], now known as [[Pro14]], adopted a system identical to that of the Premiership starting in [[2009–10 Celtic League|2009–10]], the season before that league expanded to include two teams from [[Italy]]. The Shaughnessy system was replaced by a six-team playoff when two [[South Africa]]n sides joined the league in [[2017–18 Pro14|2017–18]], bringing it to its current 14-team roster.

In [[National Rugby League (France)|French rugby union]], a Shaughnessy-style playoff was used to determine the second of two promotion spots in the second-tier [[Rugby Pro D2]] through the 2016–17 season, with the teams involved being the second- through fifth-placed teams, as the first-place team earned automatic promotion to the [[Top 14]]. This system has been abandoned for 2017–18 and beyond in favor of a six-team playoff system identical to that currently used in the Top 14, with only the Pro D2 champion earning automatic promotion and the runner-up advancing to a promotion/relegation playoff with the second-from-bottom Top 14 side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyworld.com/news/french-rugby-enjoys-a-popularity-boom-68018 |title=French rugby enjoys a popularity boom as it looks to the future |first=Gavin |last=Mortimer |publisher=''Rugby World'' |date=18 August 2016 |accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the pure Shaughnessy system had been used to determine the Top 14 champion, but that league's playoffs expanded to six teams starting in [[2009–10 Top 14 season|2009–10]].

The [[Super League]] in [[rugby league]], made up primarily of English sides with one from France, adopted a Shaughnessy playoff beginning in 2015. This follows a 22-match home-and-away league season and [[Rugby League Super 8s|a single round-robin mini-league]] involving the top eight clubs from the home-and-away season. In addition, the second-level [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]] adopted a Shaughnessy playoff for its Championship Shield, and the third-level [[League 1 (rugby league)|League 1]] adopted a Shaughnessy-style promotion playoff similar to that formerly used by Rugby Pro D2. In the Championship, the bottom eight teams at the end of the league season enter their own single round-robin mini-league, with the top four teams at the end of that phase entering a Shaughnessy playoff for the Shield. In League 1, the top team at the end of the league season is automatically promoted to the following season's Championship. The second- through fifth-place teams then enter a Shaughnessy-style playoff for the second promotion place.

Some [[association football]] leagues use Shaughnessy-style playoffs for promotion purposes. Among the countries using such a system are:
* [[Football in England|England]]:
** [[EFL Championship]]: Top two teams automatically promoted to the [[Premier League]]; next four teams play off for the final promotion place.
** [[EFL League One]]: Top two teams automatically promoted to the Championship; next four teams play off for the final promotion place.
** [[EFL League Two]]: Top three teams automatically promoted to League One; next four teams play off for the final promotion place.
** [[National League (division)|National League]]: Champion automatically promoted to League Two; next four teams play off for the final promotion place.
** [[National League North]] and [[National League South]]: Each champion automatically promoted to the National League; next four teams in each division play off for that division's second promotion place.
* [[Football in Spain|Spain]]:
** [[Segunda División]]: Top two teams automatically promoted to [[La Liga]]; next four teams play off for the final promotion place. Reserve teams of La Liga clubs are barred from promotion; if any such side occupies a promotion or playoff spot, it is excluded and its place is taken by the next-best team in the standings that is not barred. The same scenario also applies if a reserve team's parent club is relegated from La Liga (with the reserve team being relegated to [[Segunda División B]] in this case).

===Southern Hemisphere===
In rugby union, the Shaughnessy system has been widely used throughout the [[SANZAAR]] countries of South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina.

The [[Super Rugby]] competition, initially featuring teams from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, used the Shaughnessy format throughout its history as the Super 12 and Super 14, ending in 2010. The competition's expansion to 15 teams as Super Rugby in 2011 saw the playoffs expand to six teams, with three conference champions and three "wild cards" advancing. With the addition of three more teams in 2016 (with two of the new entries in Argentina and Japan), the playoffs now involve eight teams, with four conference champions and four "wild cards". The format was discontinued in the Super Rugby competition for the 2017 season.

In South Africa, the [[Currie Cup]] uses a Shaughnessy playoff to determine the champions of both of its divisions (Premier and First).

In New Zealand, the professional [[Mitre 10 Cup]] (formerly Air New Zealand Cup and ITM Cup) adopted the Shaughnessy format in 2009, after having used an eight-team playoff bracket in its first two seasons in 2007 and 2008. In 2011, the then-ITM Cup split into two divisions, effectively re-creating the three-division system that existed in the [[National Provincial Championship]] era. The playoffs in both the Premiership and Championship divisions use the Shaughnessy system except in [[Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] years, in which only the top two teams contest a final. Since its inception in 2007, the amateur [[Heartland Championship]] has used the Shaughnessy system, implemented at the last group stage, to determine the winners of both of its trophies, the [[Meads Cup|Meads]] and Lochore Cups.

Australia's [[National Rugby Championship]], which began play in 2014, uses a Shaughnessy playoff. The country's previous attempt to establish a national league, the [[Australian Rugby Championship]], also used a Shaughnessy playoff, but was scrapped after its only season in 2007.

===Philippines===
A modified Shaughnessy system has been used by the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines]] for its basketball tournaments since 1993. In the semifinals with a #1 vs. #4 and #2 vs. #3 match-ups, the top two seeds possessing the [[Playoff format#Twice to beat advantage|twice to beat advantage]], a variant of the [[Playoff format#Best-of-three playoff|best of three series]] where the higher seed has 1–0 series lead. The winners advance to the best of three finals; it has never been referred to as the "Shaughnessy system" in the country. The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) adopted it for their basketball tournaments starting in 1998. It has since been adopted to other sports by other collegiate leagues, and in the [[Philippine Basketball Association]], since then

}}
'''''Talkman''''' (PSP-240) is a program developed by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] for the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation Portable]] [[video game console]]. It is a voice-activated [[Machine translation|translation software]] application that operates in four languages [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[English language|English]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Standard Chinese|Chinese (Mandarin)]].
The name "Talkman" is a reference to Sony's [[Walkman]] line of portable audio products. It was released in Japan on November 17, 2005 and in America on August 5, 2008 (via the [[PlayStation Store]]) as ''Talkman Travel''. In America, however, instead of receiving all the languages included in the Japanese version in one package, you have the option to buy a single pack for $5.99 a piece. Available packs are: Paris (French), Rome (Italian), and Tokyo (Japanese).

The software is designed for travelers and entertainment, mostly containing [[slang]] and useful travel phrases. While originally sold in and designed for the [[Japan]]ese market for Japanese users, its translation function operates between all four languages [https://web.archive.org/web/20061112045231/http://www.ugo.com/channels/tech/features/talkman/default.asp]. In Japan, the software has proven popular with the middle-aged female demographic due to an interest in South Korean products, and Korean-language soap operas and movies; and as a fun English education aid for children [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nb20060203a4.html].

This product has also been officially released in [[Hong Kong]] with a [[Traditional Chinese]] packaging and manual. However, it does not seem that [[Sony]] is manufacturing any more of these for the Hong Kong market and most retailers that are sold out claims that it will no longer be restocked.

Outside of pure translations, ''Talkman'' also lets players play games to test their fluency of a language. The program comes with a [[USB]] [[microphone]] included.  This microphone draws power through two gold-colored contacts on the top of the PSP, one on each side of the mini-USB port.  This is uncommon due to the ability for most USB products to draw power through USB.  These proprietary contacts are similar to the gold-colored contacts on the bottom-right of the device, which are used for charging.

'''Note:'''  The [[Chotto Shot]] (aka "Go!Cam") has a built-in microphone that also can be used with the ''Talkman'' program.

==''Talkman Euro''==
Following the success of the Asian version of ''Talkman'', a version designed for translating European languages was developed and released on June 16, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sony-Talkman-PSP/dp/B000FH8Z2S/ref=sr_1_1?s=videogames&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1333947684&amp;sr=1-1|title=Talkman|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2016|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Talkman Euro'' is available in two versions. The Japanese version contains support for English, Italian, Spanish, German, French, and Japanese, while the Chinese version contains support for Traditional Chinese instead of Japanese. The differences on the packaging (the Japanese flag as opposed to a flag with the word "mie" in Chinese) are minimal and hard to notice.

==''Talkman'' UMD-only package==
''Talkman'' is also released as a UMD-only package, so users who already have the USB mic or camera can choose to purchase this standalone version. The Sony PSP Headset has also been confirmed to work with ''Talkman''.

'''''The Other Side: the Secret Relationship Between Nazism and Zionism''''' (Arabic: ''al-Wajh al-Akhar: al-'Alaqat as-Sirriya bayna an-Naziya wa's-Sihyuniya''&lt;ref&gt;''al-Wajh al-Akhar: al-'Alaqat as-Sirriya bayna an-Naziya wa's-Sihyuniya''. Publisher: Dar Ibn Rushd, Amman, [[Jordan]]. 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a book by [[Mahmoud Abbas]],&lt;ref name = "NLA"&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/493205 National Library of Australia] Catalogue detail.&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1984 in [[Arabic]].&lt;ref name = "NLA" /&gt; It is based on his [[Kandidat nauk|CandSc]] [[Thesis or dissertation|thesis]],&lt;ref name=kom/&gt; completed in 1982 at [[Patrice Lumumba]] University (now the [[Peoples' Friendship University of Russia]]) under the title ''The Connection between the Nazis and the Leaders of the Zionist Movement'', and defended at the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of Oriental Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the book, Abbas argues that the [[The Holocaust|Nazi-perpetrated Holocaust]] had been exaggerated and that [[Zionism|Zionists]] created "the myth" of six million murdered [[Jews]], which he called a "fantastic lie".&lt;ref name="morris"&gt;Morris, Benny.

September 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He further claimed that those Jews who were killed by the Nazis were actually the victims of a Zionist-Nazi plot aimed to fuel vengeance against Jews and to expand their mass extermination.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; The book also discussed topics such as the [[Haavara Agreement]], in which the [[Third Reich]] agreed with the [[Jewish Agency]] to facilitate Jewish emigration from Germany to [[Mandate Palestine]].&lt;ref name=kom/&gt;

Portions of ''The Other Side'' have been considered as [[Holocaust denial]] by some critics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1933453.stm |title=Profile: Mahmoud Abbas |date=5 November 2009 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially the parts disputing the accepted number of deaths in the Holocaust as well as the accusations that Zionist agitation was the cause of the Holocaust,&lt;ref name="Medoff"&gt;[http://www.wymaninstitute.org/articles/2003-03-denier.php A Holocaust-Denier as Prime Minister of "Palestine"?] by Dr. Rafael Medoff (The David S.

When Abbas was appointed the Palestinian prime minister in 2003, he wrote that the "Holocaust was a terrible, unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation, a crime against humanity that cannot be accepted by humankind" and that he does not deny it,&lt;ref name="haaretzinterview"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=297637&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y Interview with Mahmoud Abbas] by Akiva Eldar, ''Haaretz''.

RT&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Abbas reasserted part of his thesis to the extend that "the Zionist movement had ties with the Nazis".&lt;ref name="maannews"&gt;{{cite news | title = Abbas: Israel agreed to let refugees into West Bank from Syria | newspaper = Ma'an News Agency | date = 23 January 2013 | url =  http://maannews.net/ENG/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=557940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=300397 'Abbas claims Zionists, Nazis linked before WWII'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408065018/http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=300397 |date=2013-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Study at Patrice Lumumba University ==
Abbas attended at [[Patrice Lumumba University]] to prepare and present his doctoral thesis. The institute's director at the time, [[Yevgeny Primakov]], appointed a Soviet specialist on Palestine, Vladimir Ivanovich Kisilev as Abbas' dissertation adviser. They communicated mostly in English and Arabic.&lt;ref name=kom/&gt; In an interview with the magazine ''[[Kommersant]]'' 20 years later, Kisilev remembers Abbas as a well-prepared graduate student, who came to [[Moscow]] with an already chosen research topic and a large amount of already prepared material.&lt;ref name=kom/&gt;

The title of Abbas' thesis is ''The Connection between the Nazis and the Leaders of the Zionist Movement'' or, in [[Russian language|Russian]], "Связи между сионизмом и нацизмом. 1933–1945".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lenta.ru/lib/14161080/full.htm Аббас, Махмуд] (lenta.ru) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, a book based on Abbas' doctoral dissertation was published in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] by Dar Ibn Rushd publishers in [[Amman]], [[Jordan]] under the title ''al-Wajh al-akhar : al-`alaqat al-sirriyah bayna al-Naziyah wa-al-Sihyuniyah''.

== Content of the thesis and book ==
In the doctoral thesis, Abbas describes the number of Jews murdered in the [[The Holocaust|Nazi Holocaust]] as agreed upon by mainstream historians, six millions, as a "fantastic lie".&lt;ref name="morris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mass"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thinker"/&gt; In the book, he wrote:
{{quote|It seems that the interest of the Zionist movement, however, is to inflate this figure [of Holocaust deaths] so that their gains will be greater. This led them to emphasize this figure [six million] in order to gain the solidarity of international public opinion with Zionism. Many scholars have debated the figure of six million and reached stunning conclusions &amp;mdash; fixing the number of Jewish victims at only a few hundred thousand.&lt;ref name="Medoff"/&gt;}}

In the book, he wrote:
{{quote|Following [[World War II|the war]], word was spread that six million Jews were amongst the victims and that a war of extermination was aimed primarily at the Jews . . . The truth is that no one can either confirm or deny this figure. In other words, it is possible that the number of Jewish victims reached six million, but at the same time it is possible that the figure is much smaller, below one million.&lt;ref name="Wiesenthal"/&gt;}}

Abbas quotes historian [[Raul Hilberg]] to support his allegations that fewer than one million Jews were killed.&lt;ref name="Wiesenthal"&gt;[http://www.wiesenthal.com/atf/cf/%7BDFD2AAC1-2ADE-428A-9263-35234229D8D8%7D/DENIAL_REPORT.PDF Holocaust Denial's Assault on Memory: Precursor to Twenty-First Century Genocide], H Brackman, A Breitbart, RA Cooper - Los Angeles: Simon Wiesenthal Center, 2007, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LitvakWebman2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Meir Litvak|author2=Ester Webman|title=From Empathy to Denial: Arab Responses to the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZW2R-KChTcC&amp;pg=PA174|accessdate=18 March 2013|date=30 June 2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-70075-7|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Efraim Karsh"&gt;''Arafat's war: the man and his struggle for Israeli conquest'' by [[Efraim Karsh]], 2003, page 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephen E. Atkins"&gt;''Holocaust denial as an international movement'' by Stephen E. Atkins, ABC-CLIO, 2009, page 214&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Rafael Medoff]] of the [[David S. Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies]] denied the assertion that "The historian and author, Raoul Hilberg, thinks that the figure does not exceed 890,000", and said this is "utterly false". He wrote that "Professor Hilberg, a distinguished historian and author of the classic study ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'', has never said or written any such thing."&lt;ref name="Medoff"/&gt;

Abbas raised doubts regarding the existence of the gas chambers, quoting [[Robert Faurisson]], on the nonexistence of [[gas chamber]]s.&lt;ref name="Wiesenthal" /&gt;

Additionally, he stated that the much smaller number of Jews which he reportedly admitted that the Germans did massacre were actually the victims of a Zionist-Nazi plot:
{{quote|The Zionist movement led a broad campaign of incitement against the Jews living under Nazi rule to arouse the government's hatred of them, to fuel vengeance against them and to expand the mass extermination.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;Chris McGreal: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/19/usa.israel Arafat forced to give up most powers to new PM] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 19 March 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The thesis also discussed topics such as the [[Haavara Agreement]] of 1933, in which the [[Third Reich]] agreed with the [[Jewish Agency]] to enable Jews to emigrate from Germany directly to [[Mandate Palestine]], which he sees as evidence of collaboration.&lt;ref name=kom&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=538949 Аббас на глиняных ногах (Abbas on the feet of clay)], ''[[Kommersant]]-Vlast'' No. 2(605), 17.01.2005) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A global survey of Holocaust denial, published by David S. Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies in 2004, describes the book as "denying the Holocaust".&lt;ref name="Grobman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wymaninstitute.org/articles/2004-denialreport.php|title=Holocaust Denial: A Global Survey - 2004|author=Alex Grobman|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political controversy and Abbas' clarifications==
After Abbas was appointed prime minister of the [[Palestinian Authority]] in 2003, the [[Israel Defense Forces]] removed excerpts from the Abbas book from its website, including quotes questioning the use of gas chambers and talking of less than one million victims.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

According to the Anti-Defamation League, the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] called for Abbas to clarify his position on the Holocaust in 1995, but he did not do so at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/holocaust/denial%5Fme/hdme%5Forigins.asp 1970s–1990s: Beginnings of Denial in Middle East] [[Anti-Defamation League]], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Abbas' reported defence when asked about the book was telling: "When I wrote ''The Other Side''… we were at war with Israel. Today I would not have made such remarks… Today there is peace and what I write from now on must help advance the peace process."&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Justin Huggler"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=3451798 |title=Palestinian PM has friends in Israel, enemies at home |author=Huggler, Justin |date=30 April 2003 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his May 2003 interview with ''[[Haaretz]],'' Abbas stated:

{{quote|I wrote in detail about the Holocaust and said I did not want to discuss numbers. I quoted an argument between historians in which various numbers of casualties were mentioned. One wrote there were twelve million victims and another wrote there were 800,000. I have no desire to argue with the figures. The Holocaust was a terrible, unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation, a crime against humanity that cannot be accepted by humankind. The Holocaust was a terrible thing and nobody can claim I denied it.&lt;ref name="haaretzinterview"/&gt;}}

According to the Ma'an News Agency, in an interview in 2013, Abbas defended his doctoral thesis regarding the relationship between the Zionists and the Nazis and said he "challenges anyone who can deny that the Zionist movement had ties with the Nazis before World War II."&lt;ref name =maannews /&gt;

'''Thomas McDonnell''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|NZC1869|size=85%}} ({{circa}}1831 – 8 November 1899) was a 19th-century [[New Zealand]] public servant, military leader and writer.

[[File:Major Thomas McDonnell.jpg|thumbnail|right|Major Thomas McDonnell]]

==Biography==

===Childhood and early life===
McDonnell was born to [[Thomas McDonnell Sr.]], an early British merchant and speculator who served a brief term as [[Resident (title)|Additional British Resident]], and his wife Anna McDonnell (née Patterson). He was raised first in [[Sydney]], then [[Horeke]], [[Northland Region|Northland]].  There he learned to speak [[Māori language|Māori]] and how to use the traditional [[taiaha]] weapon.  He tried his luck on the [[Victorian gold rush|Victorian goldfields]] from 1853 to 1855, then returned to New Zealand where he obtained a post in the Native Land Purchase Department under [[Alfred Domett]] in [[Auckland]].  After being paid eight months late, McDonnell resigned from that job and went [[Sheep husbandry|sheepfarming]] in the [[Hawkes Bay]] with his brother William, only to be defrauded by a third party.  He returned to Auckland in 1862, and was appointed interpreter to the resident magistrate at [[Thames]], panning for gold on the side.

===Retirement from Military===
On 9 April 1870, McDonnell married Henrietta Elise Lomax, in [[Wellington]].  Together they had four children.  He acquired £690 in government grants and £1,400 worth of freehold property at [[Wanganui]], and set up as a Native Land Court interpreter and land agent at Wanganui in 1884.  He received the [[New Zealand Cross (1869)|New Zealand Cross]] on 31 March 1886, and published fragmented memoirs, as well as a fanciful 'Maori history' of the wars.

===Death===
Thomas McDonnell died on 8 November 1899.

'''Tsakonian''' (also '''Tsaconian''', '''Tzakonian''' or '''Tsakonic'''; Tsakonian: {{lang|tsd|τσακώνικα}}, {{lang|tsd|α τσακώνικα γρούσσα}}; Greek: {{lang|el|τσακώνικα}}) is a modern [[Hellenic languages|Hellenic language]] which is both highly divergent from other spoken [[varieties of Modern Greek]] and, from a [[philology|philological]] standpoint, is also [[Language family|linguistically classified]] separately from them. It is spoken in the [[Tsakonia|Tsakonian region]] of the [[Peloponnese]], [[Greece]]. Tsakonian descends from [[Doric Greek|Doric]], which was an Ancient Greek language on the Western branch of Hellenic languages, and it is its only living descendant&lt;ref&gt;[http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=tsd Linguist List]&lt;/ref&gt; (along with the debatable Maniot dialect of Modern Greek). Although Tsakonian is treated as a dialect of Modern Standard Greek,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Browning|first=Robert|title=Medieval and modern Greek|year=1983|page=124|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horrocks|first=Geoffrey|title=Greek: A history of the language and its speakers|page=382|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|publisher=Blackwell|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Joseph|first1=Brian D.|last2=Terdanelis|first2=Georgios|chapter=Modern Greek|title=Variation typology: a typological handbook of European languages|editor-last=Roelcke|editor-first=Thorsten|pages=823–836|publisher=de Gruyter|location=Berlin|year=2003}}

"Tsakonian"}}&lt;/ref&gt; since Modern Standard Greek descends from Ionic and Attic which are on the Eastern branch of the Hellenic languages, while Tsakonian (as a descendant of Doric) is the sole surviving member of the Western branch.

Tsakonian is critically endangered, with only a few hundred, mostly elderly, fluent speakers left.&lt;ref name="Moseley"/&gt; It is partially [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with [[Standard Modern Greek]].

==Etymology==
It is named after its speakers, the [[Tsakonian people|Tsakonians]], which in turn may be derived from 'exo-[[Laconia]]ns' 'Outer Lakonians'.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Geographic distribution==
[[File:Pelopones ethnic.JPG|thumb|left|Old ethnic map of [[Peloponnese]]; Tsakonian-speaking areas in blue]]

Tsakonian is found today in a group of mountain towns and villages slightly inland from the [[Argolic Gulf]], although it was once spoken farther to the south and west as well as on the coasts of [[Laconia]] (ancient [[Sparta]]). There was formerly a Tsakonian colony on the [[Sea of Marmara]] (or Propontis; two villages near [[Gönen]], Vatika and Havoutsi), probably dating from the 18th century, whose members were resettled in Greece with the 1924 [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|population exchanges]].&lt;ref name="Moseley"/&gt; Propontis Tsakonian appears to have died out around 1970.

[[Geography of Greece|Geographical]] barriers to travel and communication kept the Tsakonians relatively isolated from the rest of Greece until the 19th century, although there was some trade between the coastal towns. The rise of mass education and improved travel beginning after the [[Greek War of Independence]] meant that fluent Tsakonian speakers were no longer as isolated from the rest of Greece. In addition, during the war, the Turkish army drove the Tsakonians east, and as a result, their de facto capital shifted from Prastos to [[Leonidio]], further making the people significantly less isolated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mansfield|first=Peter|date=April 21, 2000|title=Letter from Tere-Sapunadzi|journal=TLS. Times Literary Supplement|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There began a rapid decline from an estimated figure of some 200,000 fluent speakers to the present estimate of a speaker count between 200 and 1,000.&lt;ref name="Moseley" /&gt;

Since the introduction of electricity to all villages in Tsakonia by the late 1950s, the Greek mass media can reach the most remote of areas and profoundly affect the speech of younger speakers. Efforts to revive the language by teaching it in local schools do not seem to have had much success. Standard Modern Greek is the official language of government, commerce and education, and it is possible that the continued modernization of Tsakonia will lead to the language's disappearance sometime this century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The area where the language is found today in some villages Tsakonia slopes of Parnon in the southern province of Kynouria, including the towns of Leonidio and Tyros and  villages of Melana, Agios Andreas, Vaskina, Prastos, Sitaina and [[Kastanitsa]].

===Official status===
Tsakonian has no official status. Prayers and liturgies of the [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox Church]] have been translated into Tsakonian, but the ancient [[Koine]] of the traditional church services is usually used as in other locations in Greece. Some teaching materials in Tsakonian for use in local schools have reportedly also been produced.&lt;ref&gt;P. Trudgill, D. Schreier (2006): Greece and Cyprus. In: U. Ammon (ed.), ''Sociolinguistics.'' Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialects===
Tsakonian is divided by scholars into three dialects, Northern Tsakonian, Southern Tsakonian and Propontis Tsakonian.

Another difference between Tsakonian and the common Demotic Greek dialect is its verb system – Tsakonian preserves different archaic forms, such as participial [[periphrasis]] for the present tense. Certain [[complement (linguistics)|complementisers]] and other adverbial features present in the standard Modern Greek dialect are absent from Tsakonian, with the exception of the Modern ''που'' ({{IPA|/pu/}}) relativiser, which takes the form ''πφη'' ({{IPA|/pʰi/}}) in Tsakonian (note: traditional Tsakonian orthography uses the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''πφ'' to represent [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] {{IPA|/pʰ/}}). Noun morphology is broadly similar to Standard Modern Greek, although Tsakonian tends to drop the nominative, final ''-ς'' (''-s'') from masculine nouns, thus Tsakonian ''ο τσχίφτα'' for Standard ''o τρίφτης'' (''o tshífta''/''o tríftis'': "grater").

[[File:Leonidio-Tsakonian-sign.jpg|thumb|right|300px|(Tsakonian/Greek) "Our language is Tsakonian. Ask and they'll tell you./Groússa námou eíni ta Tsakónika. Rotíete na nioúm' alíoi./I glóssa mas eínai ta Tsakónika. Rotíste na sas poun.", bilingual (Tsakonian and Standard Greek) sign in the town of [[Leonidio]].]]

The Propontis dialect was much more heavily influenced by the modern [[Thrace|Thracian]] dialect, and although there were significant grammatical differences, its vocabulary was much closer to Standard Modern Greek. Compare the Northern and Southern word for water, ''ύο'' (''ýo'', derived from Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|ὕδωρ}}) to Propontic ''νερέ'' and Standard ''νερό'' (''neré'', ''neró'').

However, there has always been contact with [[Koine Greek]] speakers and the language was affected by the neighboring Greek dialects. Additionally, there are some lexical borrowings from [[Arvanitika]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. The core vocabulary remains recognizably Doric, although experts disagree on the extent to which other true Doricisms can be found. There are only a few hundred, mainly elderly true native speakers living,&lt;ref name="Moseley"/&gt; although a great many more can speak the language less than fluently.

==Sounds==

===Vowels===
* '''A''' {{IPA|[a]}} can appear as a reflex of Doric {{IPA|[aː]}}, in contexts where Attic had ''η'' {{IPA|[ɛː]}} and Modern Greek has {{IPA|[i]}}: ''αμέρα'' {{IPA|[aˈmera]}} corresponding to Modern ''ημέρα'' {{IPA|[imera]}} "day", ''στρατιώτα'' {{IPA|[stratiˈota]}} corresponding to Modern ''στρατιώτης'' {{IPA|[stratiˈotis]}} "soldier".
* '''Ε''' {{IPA|[e]}} {{IPA|[i]}} before vowels: e.g. ''Βασιλήα'' {{IPA|[vasiˈlia]}} instead of ''βασιλέα'' {{IPA|[vasiˈlea]}}.
* '''O''' occasionally {{IPA|[o]}} &gt; {{IPA|[u]}}: ''ουφις'' {{IPA|[ufis]}} &lt; ''όφις'' {{IPA|[ˈofis]}} "snake", ''τθούμα'' {{IPA|[ˈtʰuma]}} &lt; ''στόμα'' {{IPA|[ˈstoma]}} "mouth". Final {{IPA|[o]}} &gt; {{IPA|[e]}} after coronals and front vowels: ''όνος'' {{IPA|[ˈonos]}} &gt; ''όνε'' {{IPA|[ˈone]}}, ''χοίρος'' {{IPA|[ˈxyros]}} &gt; ''χιούρε'' {{IPA|[ˈxjure]}}, ''γραφτός'' {{IPA|[ɣrafˈtos]}} &gt; ''γραφτέ'' {{IPA|[ɣrafˈte]}}, ''χρέος'' {{IPA|[ˈxreos]}} &gt; ''χρίε'' {{IPA|[ˈxrie]}}, but ''δρόμος'' {{IPA|[ˈðromos]}} &gt; ''δρόμο'' {{IPA|[ˈðromo]}}
* '''Υ''' Pronounced in Modern Greek {{IPA|[i]}}, this was {{IPA|[u]}} in Doric and {{IPA|[y]}} in Attic. The reflex of this phoneme in Tsakonian is {{IPA|[u]}}, and {{IPA|[ju]}} after coronals (suggesting an origin in {{IPA|[y]}}). ''σούκα'' {{IPA|[ˈsuka]}} corresponding to Modern ''σύκα'' {{IPA|[ˈsika]}} "figs", ''άρτουμα'' {{IPA|[ˈartuma]}} corresponding to ''άρτυμα'' {{IPA|[ˈartima]}} "bread"; ''λύκος'' {{IPA|[ˈlykos]}} &gt; ''λιούκο'' {{IPA|[ˈljuko] [ˈʎuko]}} "wolf"
* '''Ω''' {{IPA|[ɔː]}} in Ancient Greek, regularly goes to {{IPA|[u]}}: ''μουρήα'' {{IPA|[muˈria]}} (Ancient ''μωρέα'' {{IPA|[mɔːˈrea]}}, Modern ''μουριά'' {{IPA|[murˈja]}}), ''αού'' {{IPA|[au]}} &lt; ''λαλών'' {{IPA|[laˈlɔːn]}} "speaking".

(Note: Tsakonian citation forms for verbs are participles, hence they are given as derived from the ancient participle in ''-ών''.)

===Consonants===
Tsakonian in some words preserves the pre-classical Greek [w]-sound, represented in some Ancient Greek texts by the [[digamma]] ''(ϝ)''. In Tsakonian, this sound has become a fricative {{IPA|[v]}}: ''βάννε'' {{IPA|[ˈvane]}} "sheep", corresponding to Ancient ''ϝαμνός'' {{IPA|[wamˈnos]}} (Attic ''ἀμνός'').

Tsakonian has extensive changes triggered by palatalisation:
* {{IPA|[k]}} &gt; {{IPA|[tɕ]}} : ''κύριος'' {{IPA|[ˈkyrios]}} &gt; ''τζιούρη'' {{IPA|[ˈtɕuri]}}, occasionally {{IPA|[ts]}}: ''κεφάλι'' {{IPA|[keˈfali]}} &gt; ''τσουφά'' {{IPA|[tsuˈfa]}}
* {{IPA|[ɡ]}} &gt; {{IPA|[dz]}} : ''αγγίζων'' {{IPA|[aŋˈɡizɔːn]}} &gt; ''αντζίχου'' {{IPA|[anˈdzixu]}}
* {{IPA|[p]}} &gt; {{IPA|[c]}} : ''πηγάδι'' {{IPA|[piˈɣaði]}} &gt; ''κηγάδι'' {{IPA|[ciˈɣaði]}}
* {{IPA|[t]}} &gt; {{IPA|[c]}} : ''τυρός'' {{IPA|[tyˈros]}} &gt; ''κιουρέ'' {{IPA|[cuˈre]}}, occasionally {{IPA|[ts]}}: ''τίποτα'' {{IPA|[ˈtipota]}} &gt; ''τσίπτα'' {{IPA|[ˈtsipta]}}, ''πίτα'' {{IPA|[ˈpita]}} &gt; ''πίτσα'' {{IPA|[ˈpitsa]}} 
* {{IPA|[m]}} &gt; {{IPA|[n]}} : ''Μιχάλης'' {{IPA|[miˈxalis]}} &gt; ''Ν(ν)ιχάλη'' {{IPA|[niˈxali]}}
* {{IPA|[n]}} &gt; {{IPA|[ɲ]}} : ''ανοίγων'' {{IPA|[aˈniɣɔːn]}} &gt; ''ανοίντου'' {{IPA|[aˈɲindu]}}
* {{IPA|[l]}} &gt; {{IPA|[ʎ]}} : ''ηλιάζων'' {{IPA|[iliˈazɔːn]}} &gt; ''λιάζου'' {{IPA|[ˈʎazu]}}
* {{IPA|[r]}} &gt; {{IPA|[ʒ]}} : ''ρυάκι'' {{IPA|[ryˈaki]}} &gt; ''ρζάτζι'' {{IPA|[ˈʒatɕi]}}. This sound appears to have been a [[Alveolar trill#Raised alveolar non-sonorant trill|fricative trill]] in the 19th century, and {{IPA|[ʒ]}} survived latterly only in women's usage in Southern Tsakonian. A similar change occurred with palatalised [rʲ] in [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Czech language|Czech]], whereas [[Proto-Norse language#Consonants|in other languages]] it [[Rhotacism (sound change)#Linguistic shift|went in the reverse]].

In Southern Tsakonian, {{IPA|[l]}} is deleted before back and central vowels: ''λόγος'' {{IPA|[ˈloɣos]}} &gt; Northern ''λόγo'' {{IPA|[ˈloɣo]}}, Southern ''όγo'' {{IPA|[ˈoɣo]}}; ''λούζων'' {{IPA|[ˈluzɔːn]}} &gt; Northern ''λούκχου'' {{IPA|[ˈlukʰu]}}, Southern ''ούκχου'' {{IPA|[ˈukʰu]}};

Occasionally {{IPA|[θ]}} &gt; {{IPA|[s]}}, which appears to reflect an earlier process in Laconian, but in others {{IPA|[θ]}} is retained though the word is absent in Standard Greek: ''θυγάτηρ'' {{IPA|[θyˈɣatir]}} &gt; ''σάτη'' {{IPA|[ˈsati]}}, but Ancient ''θύων'' {{IPA|[ˈθiɔːn]}} (Modern ''σφάζω'' {{IPA|[ˈsfazo]}}) &gt; ''θύου'' {{IPA|[ˈθiu]}}

Word-final {{IPA|[s]}} &gt; {{IPA|[r]}}, which reflects an earlier process in Laconian; in Tsakonian, it is a liaison phoneme: ''τίνος'' {{IPA|[ˈtinos]}} &gt; ''τσούνερ'' {{IPA|[ˈtsuner]}}

Word-initial {{IPA|[r]}} &gt; {{IPA|[ʃ]}}: ''*ράφων'' {{IPA|[ˈrafɔːn]}} &gt; ''σχάφου'' {{IPA|[ˈʃafu]}}

In the common verb ending ''-ζω'', {{IPA|[z]}} &gt; {{IPA|[nd]}} : ''φωνάζων'' {{IPA|[foˈnazɔːn]}} &gt; ''φωνιάντου'' {{IPA|[foˈɲandu]}}

Tsakonian avoids clusters, and reduces them to aspirated or prenasalised stops and affricates:
* {{IPA|[ðr, θr, tr]}} &gt; {{IPA|[tʃ]}}: ''δρύας, άνθρωπος, τράγος'' {{IPA|[ˈðryas, ˈanθropos, ˈtraɣos]}} &gt; ''τσχούα, άτσχωπο, τσχάο'' {{IPA|[ˈtʃua, ˈatʃopo, ˈtʃao]}}
* {{IPA|[sp, st, sθ, sk, sx]}} &gt; {{IPA|[pʰ, tʰ, tʰ, kʰ, kʰ]}}: ''σπείρων, ιστός, επιάσθη, ασκός, ίσχων'' {{IPA|[ˈspirɔːn, isˈtos, epiˈasθi, asˈkos, ˈisxɔːn]}} &gt; ''πφείρου, ιτθέ, εκιάτθε, ακχό, ίκχου'' {{IPA|[ˈpʰiru, iˈtʰe, eˈcatʰe, aˈkʰo, ˈikʰu]}}
* {{IPA|[mf, nθ, ŋx]}} &gt; {{IPA|[pʰ, tʰ, kʰ]}}: ''ομφαλός, γρονθία, ρύγχος'' {{IPA|[omfaˈlos, ɣronˈθia, ˈryŋxos]}} &gt; ''απφαλέ, γροτθία, σχούκο'' {{IPA|[apʰaˈle, ɣroˈtʰia, ˈʃukʰo]}}
* {{IPA|[ks]}} &gt; {{IPA|[ts]}}: ''ξερός'' {{IPA|[kseˈros]}} &gt; ''τσερέ'' {{IPA|[tseˈre]}}
* {{IPA|[kt, xθ]}} &gt; {{IPA|[tʰ]}}: ''δάκτυλο, δεχθώ'' {{IPA|[ˈðaktylo, ðexˈθɔː]}} &gt; ''δάτθυλε, δετθού'' {{IPA|[ˈðatʰile, ðeˈtʰu]}}
* {{IPA|[l]}} after consonants often goes to {{IPA|[r]}}: ''πλατύ, κλέφτης, γλώσσα, αχλάδες'' {{IPA|[plaˈty, ˈkleftis, ˈɣlɔːsa, aˈxlaðes]}} &gt; ''πρακιού, κρέφτα, γρούσα, αχράε'' {{IPA|[praˈcu, ˈkrefta, ˈɣrusa, aˈxrae]}}
* {{IPA|[rp, rt, rk, rð]}} &gt; {{IPA|[mb, nd, ŋɡ, nd]}}: ''σκορπίος, άρτος, άρκα, πορδή'' {{IPA|[skorˈpios, ˈartos, ˈarka, porˈði]}} &gt; ''κχομπίο, άντε, άγκα, πφούντα'' {{IPA|[kʰomˈbio, ˈande, ˈaŋɡa, ˈpʰunda]}}

{{IPA|[z, v]}} are added between vowels: ''μυία, κυανός'' {{IPA|[myˈia, kyaˈnos]}} &gt; ''μούζα, κουβάνε'' {{IPA|[ˈmuza, kuˈvane]}}

{{IPA|[ɣ, ð]}} often drop out between vowels: ''πόδας, τράγος'' {{IPA|[ˈpoðas, ˈtraɣos]}} &gt; ''πούα, τσχάο'' {{IPA|[ˈpua, ˈtʃao]}}

;English translation
&lt;poem&gt;I had a bird in a cage and I kept it happy
I gave it sugar and wine-grapes
and from the great amount of grapes and their essence,
it got naughty [possibly means it got drunk] and escaped.
And its master now runs after it with the cage in his hands:
Come my bird back where you belong, come to your house
I will remove your old bells and buy you new ones.&lt;/poem&gt;

===Phonotactics===
Tsakonian avoids consonant clusters, as seen, and drops final [s] and [n]; as a result, syllable structure tends more to CV than in Standard Modern Greek. (The use of digraphs in tradition spelling tends to obscure this). For instances, ancient [hadros] "hard" goes to Tsakonian [a.tʃe], where /t͡ʃ/ can be considered a single phoneme; it is written traditionally with a trigraph as ''ατσχέ'' (= ''atskhe'').

==Grammar==
Tsakonian has undergone considerable morphological simplification: there is minimal case inflection.

The present and imperfect indicative in Tsakonian are formed with participles, like English but unlike the rest of Greek: Tsakonian ''ενεί αού, έμα αού'' "I am saying, I was saying" ≈ Greek ''ειμί λαλών, ήμην λαλών''.
* '''Ενεί''' (Ení) = I am
* '''Εσεί''' (Esí) = you are
* '''Έννι''' (Éni) = he/she/it is
* '''Έμε''' (Éme) = we are
* '''Έτε''' (Éte) = you are
* '''Είνι''' (Íni) = they are
* '''Έμα''' (Éma) = I was
* '''Έσα''' (Ésa) = you were
* '''Έκη''' (Éki) = he/she/it was
* '''Έμαϊ''' (Émaï) = we were
* '''Έταϊ''' (Étaï) = you were
* '''Ήγκιαϊ''' (Ígiaï) = they were
* '''φερήκου (males) φερήκα (females)''' (feríkou/feríka) = I bring
* '''φερήκεις''' (feríkis) = you bring
* '''φερήκει''' (feríki) = he/she/it brings
* '''φερήκουντε''' (feríkoude) = we bring
* '''φερήκουτε''' (feríkoute) = you bring
* '''φερήκουσι''' (feríkousi) = they bring

==Writing system==
Traditionally, Tsakonian used the standard Greek alphabet, along with digraphs to represent certain sounds that either do not occur in Demotic Greek, or that do not commonly occur in combination with the same sounds as they do in Tsakonian. For example, the [ʃ] sound, which does not occur in standard Greek, does occur in Tsakonian, and is spelled ''σχ'' (much like [[German language|German]] ''sch''). Another sound recalls [[Czech language|Czech]] ''ř''. [[Thanasis Costakis]] invented an orthography using dots, ''[[spiritus asper]]'', and [[caron]] for use in his works, which has been used in his grammar and several other works. This is more like the [[Czech language|Czech]] usage of [[haček]]s (such as ''š''). Lastly, unpalatalized ''n'' and ''l'' before a front vowel can be written double, to contrast with a palatalised single letter. (e.g. in Southern Tsakonian ''ένι'' [eɲi] "he is", ''έννι'' [eni] "I am" – the latter corresponding to Northern Tsakonian ''έμι'' [emi] and Standard Greek ''είμαι'' [ime].)

{{lowercase}}
{{wiktionary}}

The term '''w00t''' (spelled with double-zero, "00"), or '''woot''',&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; is a [[slang]] [[interjection]] used to express happiness or excitement, usually over the Internet. The expression is most popular on forums, [[USENET]] posts, multiplayer computer games (especially [[first person shooter]]s), [[Internet relay chat|IRC]] chats, and [[instant messages]], though use in webpages of the [[World Wide Web]] is by no means uncommon. The ''w00t'' spelling (with double-zero "00") is a [[leetspeak]] variant of ''woot''; alternative spellings include ''whoot'', ''wOOt'', ''wh00t'', ''wewt'', ''wought'', etc.

==Etymology==
See the Wiktionary article ''[[wikt:w00t|w00t]]'' for details of etymology and citations; while origins are never certain, the below is supported by contemporary written references, and is credited by American lexicographer [[Grant Barrett]].&lt;ref name="barrett"&gt;“[http://grantbarrett.com/the-real-history-and-origin-of-woot-and-w00t The Real History and Origin of Woot and w00t]”, [[Grant Barrett]], December 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''woot''' was recalled by a Canadian in the early 2000s to have been used in the 80s and 90s on an RPG BBS as a contraction of "what a hoot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6dgTAQAAIAAJ|title=Everquest Companion: The Inside Story|last=Robert|first=Marks-|publisher=McGraw-Hill Osborne|date=2003|quote=I used it as an abbreviation of 'what a hoot' while we played on a role-playing BBS in the late '80s and '90s," Bradley said.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''w00t''' (1996) is a leetspeak form of earlier ''whoot'' (1993), which in turn was popularized by the rap song “[[Whoot, There It Is]]” (single released March 22, 1993) by group {{w|95 South}}; this is often confused with “{{w|Whoomp! (There It Is)}}” (single released May 7, 1993) by group [[w:Tag Team (group)|Tag Team]]. Both these songs are in the same year, in the  [[Miami bass]] genre. The terms ''whoot'' and ''whoomp'' (and the less common form “Whoops, there it is”) are standardizations of earlier oral use of hooting sounds&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, quoting Jay-Ski, who produced “Whoot, There It Is,” in a 1997 interview:&lt;br&gt;
“There were eight versions of that going around. The idea came from the streets, and even though the 95 South one might have been recorded first, it was Tag Team who released it earlier.”&lt;/ref&gt; variously rendered as ''whoo'', ''whoof'', ''woo'', ''woof'' (compare standard ''[[wikt:woohoo|woohoo]]''), notably by studio audience on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' (1989–94)&lt;ref&gt;G. Brown, ''Colorado Rocks'' (Pruett Publishing Co., 2004, p. 128), quoting members of Tag Team (Cecil “DC” Glenn and Steve “Roll’n” Gibson); quoted in Barrett:&lt;br&gt;
“People had been saying ‘There it is’ forever. Everybody in Arsenio Hall’s television audience used to the ‘Wooof’ chant. We put that together with the ‘There it is’ dance-floor chant we were hearing at the club.&lt;br&gt;
Gibson recalled that DC said, “Oh, man, we need to do a song called, ‘Whoom, there it is.”&lt;br&gt;
“All I said was, ‘How do you spell it?”&lt;/ref&gt; and in the movie ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' (1990).&lt;ref name="barrett"/&gt; The use by the “dog pound” section of''The Arsenio Hall Show'' audience was based on a dog’s ''[[wikt:woof|woof]]'', from chants used by football fans of the [[Cleveland Browns]] in Hall’s home town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvacres.com/fans_dogpound.htm |title=Fans &amp; Fanatics &gt; The Dogpound (The Arsenio Hall Show) |publisher={{w|TV Acres}} |date= |accessdate=September 8, 2013|dead-url=yes}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018|fix-attempted}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://slate.com/culture/2012/06/woof-whoot-whoomp-and-w00t-from-arsenios-dog-pound-to-the-baha-men-and-beyond.html|title=Woot? Woof? Whoot? Whoomp|first=Daniel|last=Lametti|work=Slate|date=June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[folk etymologies]] exist, but the written record is clear: the term appears widely in popular print use only from 1993, particularly used both in dancehalls and at sporting events, and is credited to the songs.&lt;ref name="barrett"/&gt; The "w00t" form gained popularity on the internet from 1996, especially in [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s (MMORPGs).

===Folk etymologies===
Many folk etymologies and backronyms exist, none supported by the written record: these often credit the term to games that appeared years after ''whoot'' had been popularized (1993) or ''w00t'' has appeared in common internet usage (1996).

One such incorrect etymology derives w00t as a contraction of a phrase like "wow, loot!",  "woo, loot!", "wondrous loot", and "Wonderful Loot", etc. in a MMORPG when a player found large quantities of/or rare valuable items in game, or as an [[acronym]] for "'''W'''e [[pwn|'''O'''wned]] the '''O'''ther '''T'''eam".&lt;ref name="acronyms"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/W00T | title=W00T - What does W00T stand for? | accessdate=July 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These games appeared after w00t was already common. Another supposed origin is as an expression used by a cracker (see [[security cracking]]) who has just broken into a computer system, obtaining "root" access: "woot, I have root!".{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Some people say it was just a parody on a child with a speech defect trying to say "loot" and saying "woot" instead.

Other etymologies relate it to "hoot" or "toot", as in trains in children's books, that went "Woot! Woot!", doing so as a statement of victory, or applauding good news. (Some people{{who|date=September 2017}} today say "Woot! Woot!" while making the hand-gesture of pulling a train's horn cord.{{cn|date=September 2017}}) Alternatively, attempts are made to relate it to the [[Scots language|Scots]] word "hoots", which is used in a somewhat similar manner — an exclamation signifying surprise, disbelief, or kindred reaction, though not for positive feelings (delight, joy) as w00t is. This is also along the line of some peoples use of "W00t?", replacing 'wot?' or 'what?' as a response to a happy surprise.

==In popular culture==
The word was featured on the list of [[Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year]] for 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newsweek.com/2007/12/13/w00t-there-it-is.html | title=W00t!

Apart from the British digital sales house w00t!media&lt;ref name="w00t!media"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thedrum.co.uk/news/2011/07/12/23520-deviantart-hires-w00t-media-to-grow-advertising-in-uk/ | title=DeviantART hires w00t!media to grow advertising in UK | date=July 12, 2011 | accessdate=July 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the expression also made it into a URL-shortener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://w00t.in/faq.php | title=w00t.IN &amp;#124; F.A.Q | accessdate=July 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Garaj Mahal]] named their 2008 album ''w00t''.&lt;ref name="album08"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.acousticmusic.com/fame/p04994.htm | title=A review written for the Folk &amp; Acoustic Music Exchange by Mark S.

In 2011, "woot" was added to the ''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/8708448/Woot-Retweet-and-sexting-enter-the-dictionary.html | title=Woot!

'''Yusuf Akçura''' ({{lang-tt|Йосыф Акчура}}; 2 December 1876 – 11 March 1935) was a prominent [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[politician]], writer and ideologist of ethnic [[Tatars|Tatar]] origin. He developed into a prominent ideologue and advocate of [[Pan-Turkism]] during the early republican period, whose writings became widely read and who became one of the leading university professors in Istanbul.

== Biography ==
[[File:Yusuf akcura scan.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Yusuf Akçura in his early days]]
He was born in [[Simbirsk]], [[Russian Empire]] to a Tatar family and lived there until he and his mother emigrated to the [[Ottoman Empire]] when he was seven. He was educated in [[Constantinople]] and entered the Harbiye Mektebi (Military College) in 1895, before taking up a post in the Erkan-i Harbiye (General Staff Course), a prestigious training programme for the Ottoman military. He failed to complete this course as he was accused of belonging to a seditious movement and was exiled to [[Fezzan]]. 

He escaped exile in 1899 and made his way to [[Paris]] where he began to emerge as a staunch advocate of [[Turkish nationalism]]. He returned to Russia in 1903 and began to write extensively on the topic. He garnered most attention for his 1904 work ''Üç Tarz-ı Siyaset'' (Three Policies), which was originally printed in the [[Cairo]]-based magazine ''Türk''. The work called on Turks to abandon the multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire and instead to turn wholly to their Turkish identity. Initially dismissed as an extremist, his ideas began to find more favour after the [[Young Turk Revolution]] and the proclamation of the [[Second Constitutional Era]] (limited form of [[democracy]]). He was one of the co-founders of [[Ittifaq al-Muslimin]].

With a growing feeling of nationalism in the country, he returned and founded the journal ''Türk Yurdu'', which sought to become the intellectual force behind the growth of nationalism. Differing from the regime somewhat, he defined the Turkish identity in purely [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] terms and came to look outside the borders of the country for a kinship with other [[Turkic peoples]]. he also called for creation of a national economy and a move away from [[Islam]]ic values (an area in which he clashed with [[Ziya Gökalp]], as Akçura wanted a [[Secularism|secular]] Turkey, fearing that [[Pan-Islamism]] would hinder nationalist development), meaning that he was largely sympathetic to [[Kemal Atatürk]]. 

He died in [[Istanbul]] in 1935. He was laid to rest at the [[Edirnekapı Martyr's Cemetery]] in Istanbul.
