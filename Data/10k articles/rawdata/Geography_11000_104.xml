{{main|Provinces and territories of Canada}}

'''[[Canada]]''' is divided into ten [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] and three [[Provinces and territories of Canada|territories]].

Each province has a different system of [[local government]] which may include upper-tier or rural jurisdictions such as [[county|counties]], [[municipal district]]s, [[regional municipality|regional municipalities]], [[regional district]]s or [[regional county municipality|regional county municipalities]]. These divisions are then divided into lower-tier or urban jurisdictions such as [[List of cities in Canada|cities]], [[town]]s, [[village]]s, [[township (Canada)|township]]s, and [[parish (administrative division)|parish]]es. Cities in [[Quebec]] are further subdivided into [[Boroughs of Canada|arrondissements]] (similar to [[Boroughs of Montreal|boroughs]]), while outside of Quebec cities are divided into [[Ward (electoral subdivision)|wards]].

[[Statistics Canada]] aggregates statistical [[census]] data into [[Census divisions of Canada|census divisions]], which follow boundaries of one or more large local government units. Municipalities (and in some cases, communities within municipalities) within census divisions may be considered [[census subdivisions]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1438">'''Akyem Abuakwa''' describes a [[Akyem]] an [[Akan people]] traditional entity in the [[Eastern Region, Ghana|Eastern Region]] of Ghana.

Akyen Abuakwa is one of the three independent states along with [[Akyem Bosome]] and [[Akyem Kotoku]] that  forms the Akyem Mansa. It is in Eastern and Ashanti regions of Ghana.

The Akyem Abuakwa state was clearly in existence under the rule of Ofori Panin. He seems to have ruled for many years stretching until about 1730.&lt;ref&gt;W. E. F. Ward, ''A History of Ghana'' (London: Praeger, 1958), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

By the start of the 19th-century it had been subjects of the [[Ashanti Empire]]. In 1811 it rebelled against the Ashanti, in which 100 Ashanti officials in the area were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Larry W. Yarak. ''Asante and the Dutch 1744-1873''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1990. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Avinguda de la Llum''' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]] for ''Avenue of Light''; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''Avenida de la Luz''') is a now closed [[underground mall]] in [[Barcelona]], the first one of its kind to open in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ub.es/geohum/inventari/fitxes/invt079.htm |title=Avinguda de la Llum |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |language=Catalan |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004151741/http://www.ub.es/geohum/inventari/fitxes/invt079.htm |archivedate=2008-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; open between 1940 and 1990, on a 2000 square-metre site built in 1929 and boasting 68 commercial establishments, including a movie theater. It was underneath [[Carrer de Pelai, Barcelona|Carrer de Pelai]], between [[Plaça de Catalunya, Barcelona|Plaça de Catalunya]], [[Carrer de Balmes, Barcelona|Carrer de Balmes]], [[Carrer de Bergara, Barcelona|Carrer de Bergara]] and [[Plaça de la Universitat, Barcelona|Plaça de la Universitat]], upstairs of the [[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya]] (FGC) station [[Catalunya (Barcelona Metro)|Catalunya]], between its vaults and the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trensim.com/foro/viewtopic.php?p=205998 |title=Ver Tema - Avenida de la Luz |publisher=Trensim.com |date=2008-03-27 |language=Spanish|accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of being initially part of an ambitious plan to build an underground city from [[Plaça Urquinaona]] to [[Plaça de la Universitat, Barcelona|Plaça de la Universitat]], the [[urban decay]] prevalent in the area from the 1960s onwards prompted its progressive abandonment. The Avinguda de la Llum was a decayed place with plenty of homeless people living in it by the time it was closed, on May 21, 1990. On the ground upstairs stood an empty, triangular in shape area between buildings which came to be called ''Triangle de la vergonya'' ("Triangle of shame"), which contributed to the adoption of measures to renovate the area in time for the [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

Nowadays its main corridor is part of the underground stage of a [[Sephora]] store in the [[El Triangle]] shopping centre, its successor, while some parts of it are still abandoned and closed to the public.

==In popular culture==
*It features in [[Bigas Luna]]'s 1978 film ''[[Bilbao (film)|Bilbao]]''. 
*The rock band [[Loquillo y los Trogloditas]] wrote a song on this mall called ''Avenida de la Luz''.

The '''Baetic System''' ({{lang-es|Sistema Bético}}) is one of the main systems of [[mountain range]]s in [[Spain]]. Located in the southern and eastern [[Iberian Peninsula]], it is also known as the '''Baetic Cordillera''', '''Baetic Ranges''' or '''Baetic Mountains'''. The name of the mountain system derives from the [[ancient Roman]] region of [[Baetica]], one of the Imperial [[Roman provinces]] of ancient [[Hispania]].

==Geography==
The Baetic System is made up of multiple mountain ranges that reach from western [[Andalusia]] to the [[Region of Murcia]], southern [[Castile-La Mancha]] and the [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Land of Valencia]]. To the north, the Baetic Ranges are separated from the [[Meseta Central]] and the [[Sierra Morena]] by the basin of the [[Guadalquivir]]. The Iberian System rises north of the eastern part of the [[Prebaetic System]], the northernmost prolongation of the Baetic System. Generally the mountain ranges that are part of this system are aligned in a southwest-northeast direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granadanatural.com/blog.php?mes=9&amp;anio=2009 Granada Natural - Las Zonas Externas]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The most well-known range of the Baetic System is the [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]], where the [[Mulhacén]], the highest mountain in continental Spain and in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] is found. 
The [[Rock of Gibraltar]] is also considered to be part of the Baetic System,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gonhs.org/documents/UpperRockGuide.pdf A Guide to the Upper Rock Nature Reserve] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724110959/http://gonhs.org/documents/UpperRockGuide.pdf |date=2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but not the [[Cabo de Gata]] area further east which includes rocks of [[volcanic]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeangeoparks.org/isite/page/124,1,0.asp? European geoparks website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530220441/http://www.europeangeoparks.org/isite/page/124%2C1%2C0.asp |date=2009-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
The Baetic System as a geological feature belongs to a larger [[orogeny]] usually called the [[Gibraltar Arc]], which represents the westernmost edge of the [[Alpine Orogeny]]. The [[geodynamic]] mechanisms responsible for its formation are so far relatively unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Wes Gibbons &amp; Teresa Moreno, ''The geology of Spain''. Geological Society of London, 2003, {{ISBN|978-1-86239-110-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geologically the [[Rif]] mountains in [[Morocco]] and the [[Serra de Tramuntana]] in the island of [[Majorca]] are extensions of the Baetic System.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2955208/Dissertation_Univ._of_Texas_at_Austin_Commercial_Navigation_in_the_Greek_and_Roman_World Dan Davis, ''Commercial Navigation in the Greek and Roman World'']&lt;/ref&gt;
The Gibraltar Arc geological region follows the Moroccan coast from [[Oujda]] in the east to [[Tanger]] in the west, then crosses the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and goes east again from [[Cádiz]] to [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]].

==Ecology==
The Baetic System is home to a number of [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] plant communities, including shrublands, [[oak]] woodlands, [[broadleaf]] forests, and [[conifer]]ous forests, which vary with elevation, soils, and topography.

The Baetic System, together with the [[Rif Mountains]] of Morocco, which face the Baetic Ranges across the [[Alboran Sea]], is one of the Mediterranean basin's ten [[biodiversity hotspot]]s, known to ecologists as the Baetic-Rifan complex. The Baetic mountains are home to a rich assemblage of Mediterranean plants, including a number of [[relict (biology)|relict]] species from the ancient [[laurel forest]]s, which covered much of the Mediterranean basin millions of years ago when it was more humid.

==Subdivision==
The Baetic System is divided into the following sub-chains:

===Penibaetic System===

The [[Penibaetic System]] includes the highest point in the peninsula, the 3,478 m high [[Mulhacén]] in the [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]]; other ranges and features are:

[[File:Rifugi Monte Ortobene 018.JPG|thumb|right|[[Nuoro]], the main urban center in Barbagia]]
[[File:Sardegna Barbaria.png|thumbnail|The Barbaria (in blue) and the Roman controlled regions of Sardinia (in yellow)]]

'''Barbagia''' ({{lang-sc|Barbàgia}} or {{lang|sc|Barbàza}}) is a mountain area of inner [[Sardinia]]. It is a [[natural region]] mostly contained in the [[province of Nuoro]] and located alongside the [[Gennargentu]] massif.

The name comes from [[Cicero]], who described it as a land of [[barbarians]] (''Barbaria'', Βαρβαρία in [[Ancient Greek]]). This word derives from the Greek Βάρβαρος, which means "stuttering". The inhabitants were also known, by the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]], with the pejorative term  ''latrones mastrucati'', which means "thieves with a rough garment in wool". Roman domination in this area of Sardinia was never more than nominal.

In 594, Pope [[Gregory the Great]] wrote a letter to [[Hospito]], a Christian whom he calls the "leader of the Barbaricini" (''dux barbaricinorum''). Hospito apparently permitted the evangelisation of pagan Barbagia by Christian missionaries.

The area is usually divided into five Barbagias: the Barbagia of [[Ollolai]], the [[Barbagia di Seulo|Barbagia of Seulo]], the [[Barbagia of Belvì]], the [[Mandrolisai]], and finally the ''Barbagia Trigònia'', the historical name by which the area of [[Ogliastra]] was once referred to. The latter two are named after a sub-region, and the others after their main villages.

The area is full of hard hills and mountains, and there is little human presence. Barbagia is one of the least populated areas in Europe, which has allowed Barbagia to preserve its cultural and natural treasures. Barbagia is one of the few, if not the only Sardinian region, where [[Sardinian language]] and its internal varieties (both [[Logudorese dialect|Nuorese]] and [[Campidanese dialect|Campidanese]] dialects) is still spoken on an everyday basis, while the rest of the island has already undergone [[language shift|shift]] to Italian.

One of the most important villages is [[Gavoi]]. [[Orgosolo]] was famous for its bandits and kidnappers and typical [[murals]]. [[Oliena]] is well known for its [[wine]]s (especially the Nepente, a  wine made with [[Cannonau]] grapes). Another well known town is [[Fonni]], the highest town in Sardinia at more than 1,000 meters above sea level. Fonni is also the gateway to the Gennargentu mountain system.

The economy consists of agriculture, sheep breeding, art and tradition related business, tourism and light industry.

According to the Bible, the '''Battle of the Waters of Merom''' was a battle between the [[Israelites]] and a coalition of [[Canaan]]ite [[city-state]]s near the [[Waters of Merom]]. Archaeologist Nadav Na'aman has suggested that this battle may never have taken place, and that its narrative might have "preserved some remote echoes of wars conducted in these places in early Iron Age I." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Naʼaman|first=Nadav|title=Canaan in the 2nd millennium B.C.E|year=2005|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-1575061139|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the biblical narrative, around 40 years before the battle, the Israelites escaped from slavery in [[Egypt]], setting out for  [[the Exodus]] under the leadership of [[Moses]]. They entered [[Canaan]] near [[Jericho]] and captured several cities.&lt;ref&gt;Battles of the Bible, page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; An alliance of northern Canaanite city-states sent a united force to halt the Israelite invasion. The Israelites counterattacked, catching the Canaanite forces unaware and routing them with a fearsome head-on assault. The battle is described in [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] chapter 11.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5444">[[Channel (geography)|Channel]] patterns are found in [[river]]s, streams, and other bodies of water that transport water from one place to another. Systems of branching river channels dissect most of the sub-aerial landscape, each in a valley proportioned to its size. Whether formed by chance or necessity, by headward [[erosion]] or downslope convergence, whether inherited or newly formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.primaryhomeworkhelp.co.uk/rivers/stages.html|title=The Stages of a River|website=www.primaryhomeworkhelp.co.uk|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on different geological factors such as weathering, erosion, depositional environment, and [[sediment]] type, different types of channel patterns can form.

==Bedrock vs. alluvial channels==

There are two main types of channels, [[bedrock]] and alluvial, which are present no matter the sub-classification. Bedrock channels are composed entirely of compacted rock, with only patches of [[alluvium]] scattered throughout. Because the bedrock is constantly exposed it takes much less [[stream power]] to carve the channel. The [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] force of flowing water can push and pull detached joint blocks out of their initial position and roll or drag them downstream. [[Plucking (glaciation)|Plucking]] is common in jointed rocks, where this occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/299847567|title=Geomorphology : a systematic analysis of late Cenozoic landforms|last=Leroy.|first=Bloom, Arthur|date=1998|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=0135054966|oclc=299847567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alluvial channels are much more common and can be large or small. All large rivers, and most small ones, have channels that are usually lined with alluvium, sediment that was carried to that channel reach by the river and that eventually will be carried farther [[wikt:downstream|downstream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diplas|first=Panayiotis|title=Characteristics of Self‐Formed Straight Channels|url=http://ascelibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1990)116:5(707)|journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering|language=en|volume=116|issue=5|pages=707–728|doi=10.1061/(asce)0733-9429(1990)116:5(707)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lining of alluvium creates a protective shield over the bedrock, which means it takes a much greater stream power to carve the channel.

==Braided channels==

There are a few distinctly different channel types based on their geological structure and [[Depositional environment|depositional]] environment. [[Braided river]]s carry fairly coarse-grained sediment down a fairly steep gradient. They typically exhibit numerous channels that split off and rejoin each other to give a braided appearance. Additionally, the water [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] tends to be highly variable. Consequently, braided rivers usually exist near mountainous regions, especially those with glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/489065099|title=Geology : an introduction to physical geology|last=Stanley|first=Chernicoff,|last2=L.|first2=Whitney, Donna|date=2007|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|isbn=0131474642|oclc=489065099}}&lt;/ref&gt; These braided channels usually occur in [[Tectonics|tectonically active]] environments and have a larger sediment load due to varying water flow and discharge.

==Anastomosed channels==

Often confused with braided channels, [[Anastomosis|anastomosing]] is reserved for a type of river with multiple, interconnected, coexisting channel belts on alluvial plains. Based on its geomorphology, saucer-shaped islands called [[Flood basin|flood-basins]] characterize anastomosing rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Makaske|first1=Bart|title=Anastomosing rivers: a review of their classification, origin and sedimentary products|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|date=2001|volume=53|issue=3-4|pages=149–196|doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(00)00038-6|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/geo5xx/geos544/pdfs/fluvial/makaske.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These channels are classified as a composite form of which the individual channel belts may have braided, [[meander]]ing or [[Straight River (central Minnesota)|straight channels]]. Although similar to, and even encompass other channel types, anastomosed rivers are their own entity and have just begun to be studied by [[geologist]]s, revealing that much is still unknown.

[[Fluvial]] processes form several '''channel patterns''', including:

*Straight, which are found in the most tectonically incised/active areas.  This is more of a hypothetical end-member, and are not often found in nature.  Straight-type channels can be found at [[alluvial fans]].
*[[Braided river]]s, which form in (tectonically active) areas that have a larger sedimentary load than the discharge of the river and a high gradient.
*[[Meandering river]]s, which form a [[sinuous]] path in a usually low-gradient plain toward the end of a fluvial system.
*[[Anastomosis#Geography|Anastomosed river]] is a rare case of a relatively straight, complicated vertical sequence of river deposits with banks held together by dense [[vegetation]].

'''Churchyards in northwestern France''' are often much older than the church itself. The shape and the height are both indicators of age. Churches often sit on sites of great antiquity, long predating Christianity.&lt;ref name="Muir2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Muir|first=Richard|title=Landscape Encyclopedia:A Reference Guide to the Historic Landscape|year=2004|publisher=Windgather Press|location=29 Bishop Road, Bollington|isbn=0-9545575-1-4|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Age indicators and location==
The general rectangular shape of today’s churchyard began in the [[early middle ages]], so sometimes older grounds are indicated by oval or round forms.Selection of a location by the church involved commandeering pagan holy places, which were linked to landscape features. [[SpringSource|Springs]] were particularly important as they were thought of as points of contact between the underworld and the surface world. These locations were associated with particular pre-Christian gods and goddesses, sometimes Roman gods had previously replaced [[Gauls|Gallic]] or [[Celts]] ones.[[Christian missionaries]] were specifically instructed to take over sites of [[pagan worship]], thus depriving the old gods of their perches, but also enabling the Christian religion to inherit some of the sanctity that native people associated with the site.&lt;ref name="Muir2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Muir|first=Richard|title=Be Your Own Landscape Detective|year=2007|publisher=Sutton Publishing Ltd.|location=Glouchester, UK|isbn=978-0-7509-4333-8|pages=158–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another broad indication of greater antiquity is the height of the churchyard earth in relation to the ground outside the walls. Centuries of repeated [[Exhumation|burials]] in the same location resulted in the gradual elevation of terrain.&lt;ref name="Muir2004" /&gt;

==Historic Uses==

Today a churchyard looks quiet and somber but in [[medieval]] times, despite protests by generations of [[bishops]], the church grounds were popular sites for games, gatherings, dancing and dalliances. The church grounds being the only public grounds available.&lt;ref name="Yorke2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yorke|first=Trevor|title=Gravestones, Tombs, and Memorials|year=2010|publisher=Countryside Books|location=Newbury, Berkshire, UK|isbn=978-1-84674-202-6|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; News and gossip brought out an audience, often after [[mass]]. Before the 17th century [[gravestones]] were rare with most country churches having none before the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Muir2004" /&gt; 

The churchyard [[cross]] usually was the only obstacle for the frequent activities on the church grounds. This cross was always found on the sunlite side mounted on stepped base, and indicated that the churchyard was consecreted ground. Sunny southern side of the church was the favored  spot for burials. The northern exposure, associated with the [[devil]], was designated for the graves of strangers, unbaptised children, outcasts and [[suicides]].During the 18th and 19th centuries, the increased use of stone monuments, brought pressure to use these shadow realms. Archery sometimes was practiced on these northern sides as well because less activity happened there.&lt;ref name="Yorke2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Muir|first=Richard|title=Landscape Encyclopedia:A Reference Guide to the Historic Landscape|year=2004|publisher=Windgather Press|location=29 Bishop Road, Bollington|isbn=0-9545575-1-4|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Community studies''' is an [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] drawing on both [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]] and the [[social research]] [[methodology|methods]] of [[ethnography]] and [[participant observation]] in the study of community. In academic settings around the world, community studies is variously a sub-discipline of anthropology or sociology, or an independent discipline. It is often interdisciplinary and geared toward practical applications rather than purely theoretical perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;The University of California at Santa Cruz has an interdisciplinary [http://communitystudies.ucsc.edu/about_us/ Community Studies Department] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904163357/http://communitystudies.ucsc.edu/about_us/ |date=2006-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Community studies is sometimes combined with other fields, i.e., "Urban and Community Studies," "Health and Community Studies," or "Family and Community studies."&lt;ref&gt;Examples of Community Studies programs with a particular focus: [http://www.urbancenter.utoronto.ca/aboutcucs.html Urban and Community Studies] at the University of Toronto; [http://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/ihcs/ The Institute of Health and Community Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713153603/http://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/ihcs/ |date=2006-07-13 }} at Bournemouth University, UK, and [http://www.douglas.bc.ca/faculties/child-family-community-studies/ The Faculty of Child, Family and Community Studies]  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120730082307/http://www.douglas.bc.ca/faculties/child-family-community-studies/ |date=2012-07-30 }} at Douglas College, New Westminster BC, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epistemology ==
In [[North America]], community studies drew inspiration from the classic [[urban sociology]] texts produced by the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]], such as the works of [[Louis Wirth]] and [[William Foote Whyte]]. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], community studies was developed for colonial administrators working in East Africa, particularly [[Kenya]].  It was further developed in the [[post-war]] period with the [[Institute of Community Studies]] founded by [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] in east London, and with the studies published from the Institute, such as ''[[Family and Kinship in East London]]''.

Community studies, like [[Colonialism|colonial]] [[anthropology]], have often assumed the existence of discrete, relatively [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]], almost [[tribe]]-like [[communities]], which can be studied as [[organic (model)|organic]] [[Holism|wholes]]. In this, it has been a key [[Social influence|influence]] on [[communitarianism]] and [[communalism]], from the [[Local community|local context]] to the [[Globalism|global]] and everywhere in between.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

== Curricula ==

Community studies [[Curriculum|curricula]] are often centered on the "concerns" of communities. These include mental and physical health, stress, addiction, AIDS, racism, immigration, ethnicity, gender, identity, sexuality, the environment, crime, deviance, delinquency, family problems, social competence, poverty, homelessness and other psycho-social aspects. Understanding the socio-cultural completeness and the anthropological ramifications of the accurate analysis of community health is key to the sphere of these studies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Journal of Community and Applied Social Psychology]], Aims and Scope&lt;/ref&gt;

Another focus of curricula in community studies is upon anthropology, [[cultural anthropology]] in particular. Some programs set as prerequisite knowledge, the background and historical contexts for community, drawing upon [[archeology|archeological findings]] and the theoretical underpinnings for social organization in ancient and prehistorical community settings. The theories connected with the so-called "[[Neolithic revolution]]" is one example of a deep study into how, where and why, hunter-gatherer communities formed.&lt;ref&gt;Bellwood, Peter. (2004). First Farmers: The Origins of Agricultural Societies. Blackwell Publishers. {{ISBN|0-631-20566-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community studies have been linked to the causes of social justice, promoting peace and nonviolence and working towards social change, often within an [[Activism|activist]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: [http://admissions.ucsc.edu/pdf/Community_Studies_2005.pdf Community Studies 2005]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823122545/http://admissions.ucsc.edu/pdf/Community_Studies_2005.pdf |date=2006-08-23 }}, U.C.

A '''Daboll trumpet''' is an air trumpet [[foghorn]] which was developed by an American, [[Celadon Leeds Daboll]], of [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], Connecticut.  It was basically a small coal-fired [[hot air engine]], which compressed air in a cylinder on top of which was a reed horn.

The Daboll trumpet, consists of a steel reed vibrating within a horn, which uses the hot air engine to force cold air by means of an air pump into a boiler, from which it escapes into the horn through a valve, causing the vibrations of the reed, which are regulated by an automatic cam.

Daboll's cousin, Charles Miner Daboll (1823-), inventor of the [[Daboll bushing]], is credited with developing the Daboll trumpet for practical use.

The following citation is from: ''Scientific American Supplement'', Vol. XIX, No. 470, Jan. 3, 1885.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Daboll trumpet was invented by Mr. C.L. Daboll, of
Connecticut, who was experimenting to meet the announced wants of the
United States Lighthouse Board. The largest consists of a huge trumpet
seventeen feet long, with a throat three and one-half inches in diameter,
and a flaring mouth thirty-eight inches across. In the trumpet is a
resounding cavity, and a tongue-like steel reed ten inches long, two and
three-quarter inches wide, one inch thick at its fixed end, and half that
at its free end. Air is condensed in a reservoir and driven through the
trumpet by hot air or steam machinery at a pressure of from fifteen to
twenty pounds, and is capable of making a shriek which can be heard at a
great distance for a certain number of seconds each minute, by about
one-quarter of the power expended in the case of the whistle. In all his
experiments against and at right angles and at other angles to the wind,
the trumpet stood first and the whistle came next in power. In the trial
of the relative power of various instruments made by Gen. Duane in 1874,
the twelve-inch whistle was reported as exceeding the first-class Daboll
trumpet. Beaseley reports that the trumpet has done good work at various
British stations, making itself heard from five to ten miles. The engineer
in charge of the lighthouses of Canada says: "The expense for repairs, and
the frequent stoppages to make these repairs during the four years they
continued in use, made them [the trumpets] expensive and unreliable. The
frequent stoppages during foggy weather made them sources of danger
instead of aids to navigation. The sound of these trumpets has
deteriorated during the last year or so." Gen. Duane, reporting as to his
experiments in 1881, says: "The Daboll trumpet, operated by a caloric
engine, should only be employed in exceptional cases, such as at stations
where no water can be procured, and where from the proximity of other
signals it may be necessary to vary the nature of the sound." Thus it
would seem that the Daboll trumpet is an exceptionally fine instrument,
producing a sound of great penetration and of sufficient power for
ordinary practical use, but that to be kept going it requires skillful
management and constant care.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Congress made an appropriation in 1860 authorizing the Light-House Board to make
experiments with "Daboll's trumpet and other ear signals," but nothing was done until some time later."

Daboll's trumpet were installed at the following during trials:

'''Danube-Ipoly National Park''' is one of the most diverse [[national park]]s in [[Hungary]]. In 1997, the park was created from Pilis and Börzsöny national parks, with the addition of part of the [[floodplain]] of the [[River Ipoly]]. This park encompasses areas in [[Budapest]], [[Pest County]], [[Komárom-Esztergom County]] and [[Fejér County]]. Its offices are in Budapest and in the [[Jókai garden]] (Budapest XII), and its headquarters are in [[Esztergom]].

Some species &amp;ndash; both flora and fauna &amp;ndash; have their sole habitat in this park, and there is a programme to save these rare and endangered species.

[[File:Danxia 0816.JPG|thumb|right|Red Cliff]]
The '''Danxia landform''' ({{zh|s=丹霞地貌|p=dānxiá dìmào}}) refers to various landscapes found in southeast, southwest and northwest China that "consist of a red [[Bed (geology)|bed]] characterized by steep cliffs".&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5352/ |title=Danxia Landform of China |accessdate=2009-12-16  |author= |publisher=whc.unesco.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a unique type of [[petrography|petrographic]] [[geomorphology]] found in [[China]]. Danxia [[landform]] is formed from red-coloured [[sandstone]]s and [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] of largely [[Cretaceous]] age. The landforms look very much like [[karst]] topography that forms in areas underlain by [[limestone]]s, but since the rocks that form danxia are sandstones and conglomerates, they have been called "pseudo-karst" landforms. They were formed by endogenous forces (including [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]]) and exogenous forces (including [[weathering]] and [[erosion]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1335 China Danxia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first studies on what are now referred to as Danxia landforms were conducted at [[Mount Danxia]] near [[Shaoguan]], China. In the 1920s and 1930s Chinese geologists made an effort to learn more about these interesting geomorphic structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Danxia Geomorphology|url=http://www.globalgeopark.org/Portals/1/01-News_Events/Newsletter/Danxia2009.pdf|accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danxia landforms are made up uplifted continental crust that has been faulted and eroded, exposing large scarps of layered rock, red in color.&lt;ref name="Zhang, Hayakawa"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zhang, Hayakawa|first=Wen, Yuichi|title=DEM and GIS based Morphometric and Topographic Profile Analyses of Danxia Landforms|url=http://www.geomorphometry.org/system/files/Zhang2011geomorphometry.pdf|accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danxia landforms cover several provinces in southeast China. [[Taining County]], Fujian Province, has very good examples of "young" danxia landforms wherein deep, narrow valleys have been formed. As the landform gets older, valleys widen and one gets isolated towers and ridges.The danxia landform is named after Mount Danxia, one of the most famous examples of the danxia landform. A very peculiar feature of danxia landscape is the development of numerous [[cave]]s of various sizes and shapes. The caves tend to be shallow and isolated, unlike true karst terrain where caves tend to form deep, interconnecting networks. In 2010, several danxia landscapes in southern China, with a general name of "[[China Danxia]]", were inscribed as a [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-08/02/c_13425443.htm China danxia landform proclaimed world heritage]&lt;/ref&gt; The six inscribed danxia landform areas are: [[Mount Langshan]] and [[Mount Wanfo]] ([[Hunan Province]]), [[Mount Danxia]] ([[Guangdong Province]]), [[Taining County|Taining]] and [[Mount Guanzhi]] ([[Fujian Province]]), [[Mount Longhu]] and [[Guifeng]] ([[Jiangxi Province]]), [[Fangyan, Zhejiang|Fangyan]], [[Mount Jianglang]] ([[Zhejiang Province]]), and [[Mount Chishui]] ([[Guizhou Province]]). The total core area of 6 regions above is 73945 ha (182,722 acres), and the total buffer area is 65446 ha (161,720 acres).&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt; Other notable danxia areas, such as [[Zhangye Danxia National Geological Park]], are not included in the World Heritage Site.

==Geology==
Around 80 million years ago (Ma) cretaceous red sandstone and conglomerate was laid down by sedimentation from the lakes and streams.&lt;ref name="Danxiashan Geopark"&gt;{{cite web|title=Danxiashan Geopark|url=http://www.globalgeopark.org/aboutggn/list/china/6405.htm|accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After another 15 million years, tectonic plate movements created many faults.&lt;ref name="Danxiashan Geopark"/&gt; About 23 Ma, movement of the Himalayan range disturbed the land around the Danxia landform in the Guangdong Province of China uplifting and completely changing the topography of the area.&lt;ref name="Danxiashan Geopark"/&gt; Over millions of years the steep cliffs that can be seen today, exposed by faults, were formed through weathering and erosion. This geology can be seen at Danxiashan Geopark in China, where there is about 290 square kilometers of streams, forest and towering danxian rock formations.&lt;ref name="Danxiashan Geopark"/&gt;

==Studies==
In an effort to learn more about danxia topography, a study on the geomorphology of an area in China was conducted. Mount Danxia was the focus of the research, taking Digital Elevation Matrix (DEM) based data from many watersheds and basins in the area.&lt;ref name="Zhang, Hayakawa"/&gt; Understanding the hydrology of the area can tell a lot about the nearby formations. For example, "localized erosion has enhanced deepening of existing fractures rather than lateral erosion to form deep and narrow valleys, while long-term erosion provided large and gentle watersheds."&lt;ref name="Zhang, Hayakawa"/&gt; This study used [[ArcGIS]]. These scientists took maps of the area and overlaid certain features they wanted to measure, such as stream length and size.

'''Eastdenmark''' ({{lang-da|Østdanmark}}) is a geographical term that refers to the part of [[Denmark]] east of Storebælt, including [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] and [[Bornholm]]. From a linguistic and historical point of view the term refers to the area east of the [[Øresund]] (the former Danish territories [[Scania]], [[Halland]] and [[Blekinge]] and Bornholm).&lt;ref&gt;Jens Christian Vesterskov Johansen: ''Da Østdanmark blev Sydsverige. Otte studier i dansk-svenske relationer i 1600-tallet'', Ebeltoft 2003, {{ISBN|8789224744}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former dialects in [[Skåneland]] are accordingly called East Danish (''Østdansk'').

'''Franklin's lost expedition''' was a British voyage of [[Arctic exploration]] led by Captain Sir [[John Franklin]] that departed England in 1845 aboard two ships, {{HMS|Erebus|1826|6}} and {{HMS|Terror|1813|6}}. A [[Royal Navy]] officer and experienced explorer, Franklin had served on three previous Arctic expeditions, the latter two as commanding officer. His fourth and last, undertaken when he was 59, was meant to traverse the last unnavigated section of the [[Northwest Passage]]. After a few early fatalities, the two ships became icebound in [[Victoria Strait]], near [[King William Island]] in the [[Canadian Arctic]]. The entire expedition, comprising 129 men including Franklin, was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Neatby |first1=Leslie H. |last2=Mercer |first2=Keith |last-author-amp=yes |title=Sir John Franklin |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/sir-john-franklin/ |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica Canada |date=|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressed by Franklin's wife, [[Jane Franklin|Jane, Lady Franklin]], and others, the [[Admiralty]] launched a search for the missing expedition in 1848. Prompted in part by Franklin's fame and the Admiralty's offer of a finder's reward, many subsequent expeditions joined the hunt, which at one point in 1850 involved eleven British and two American ships. Several of these ships converged off the east coast of [[Beechey Island]], where the first relics of the expedition were found, including the graves of three crewmen. In 1854, explorer [[John Rae (explorer)|John Rae]], while surveying near the Canadian Arctic coast southeast of King William Island, [[Rae–Richardson Arctic Expedition|acquired relics]] of and stories about the Franklin party from local [[Inuit]]. A search led by [[Francis Leopold McClintock]] in 1859 discovered a note left on King William Island with details about the expedition's fate. Searches continued through much of the 19th&amp;nbsp;century. [[2014 in archaeology|In 2014]], a Canadian search team led by Parks Canada&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/franklin-expedition-ship-found-in-arctic-id-d-as-hms-erebus-1.2784268&lt;/ref&gt; located the wreck of ''Erebus'' west of [[O'Reilly Island]], in the eastern portion of [[Queen Maud Gulf]], in the waters of the Arctic archipelago. [[2016 in archaeology|Two years later]], the Arctic Research Foundation found the wreck of ''Terror'' south of King William Island.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;  Research and dive expeditions at the wreck sites are currently ongoing.

In 1981, a team of scientists led by Owen Beattie, a professor of anthropology at the [[University of Alberta]], began a series of scientific studies of the graves, bodies, and other physical evidence left by Franklin's men on Beechey Island and King William Island. They concluded that the men buried on Beechey Island most likely died of [[pneumonia]] and perhaps [[tuberculosis]], and that [[lead poisoning]] may have worsened their health, owing to badly [[solder]]ed cans held in the ships' food stores. It was later suggested that the source of this lead may not have been [[canning|tinned food]], but the distilled water systems fitted to the ships.&lt;ref name="Battersby"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Battersby |first=William |url=http://www.hakluyt.com/PDF/Battersby_Franklin.pdf |title=Identification of the Probable Source of the Lead Poisoning Observed in Members of the Franklin Expedition |journal=[[Journal of the Hakluyt Society]] |year=2008 |access-date=25 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies in 2013 and 2016 suggested that lead poisoning was likely not a factor, and that the crew's ill health may, in fact, have been due to malnutrition – specifically [[zinc deficiency]] – possibly due to a lack of meat in their diet.&lt;ref name=witze2016 /&gt;

Cut marks on human bones found on King William Island were seen as signs of [[cannibalism]]. The combined evidence of all the studies suggested that the crewmen did not all die quickly. [[Hypothermia]], starvation, lead poisoning or zinc deficiency, and diseases including [[scurvy]], along with general exposure to a hostile environment whilst lacking adequate clothing and nutrition, killed everyone on the expedition in the years following its last sighting by Europeans in 1845.

The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] media portrayed Franklin as a hero despite the expedition's failure and the reports of cannibalism. Songs were written about him, and statues of him in his home town, in London, and in [[Tasmania]] credit him with discovery of the Northwest Passage, although in reality it was not traversed until [[Roald Amundsen]]'s 1903–1906 expedition. Franklin's lost expedition has been the subject of many artistic works, including songs, verse, short stories, and novels, as well as television documentaries.

==Background==
The search by Europeans for a western shortcut by sea from Europe to Asia began with the voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492 and continued through the mid-19th century with a long series of exploratory expeditions originating mainly in England. These voyages, when to any degree successful, added to the sum of European geographic knowledge about the Western Hemisphere, particularly North America, and as that knowledge grew larger, attention gradually turned toward the Arctic. Voyagers of the 16th and 17th centuries who made geographic discoveries about North America included [[Martin Frobisher]], [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]], [[Henry Hudson]], and [[William Baffin]]. In 1670, the incorporation of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] led to further exploration of the Canadian coasts and interior and of the Arctic seas. In the 18th century, explorers included [[James Knight (explorer)|James Knight]], [[Christopher Middleton (navigator)|Christopher Middleton]], [[Samuel Hearne]], [[James Cook]], [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander MacKenzie]], and [[George Vancouver]]. By 1800, their discoveries showed conclusively that no [[Northwest Passage]] navigable by ships lay in the temperate latitudes between the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans.{{sfn|Savours|1999|pp=1–38}}

In 1804, Sir [[Sir John Barrow, 1st Baronet|John Barrow]] became Second Secretary of the [[Admiralty]], a post he held until 1845, and began a push by the Royal Navy to complete the Northwest Passage over the top of Canada and to navigate toward the North Pole. Over the next four decades, explorers including [[John Ross (Arctic explorer)|John Ross]], [[David Buchan]], [[William Edward Parry]], [[Frederick William Beechey]], [[James Clark Ross]], [[George Back]], [[Peter Warren Dease]], and Thomas Simpson made productive trips to the Canadian Arctic. Among these explorers was John Franklin, second-in-command of an expedition towards the North Pole in the ships ''Dorothea'' and ''Trent'' in 1818 and the leader of overland expeditions to and along the Arctic coast of Canada in 1819–22 and 1825–27.{{sfn|Savours|1999|pp=39–166}} By 1845, the combined discoveries of all of these expeditions had reduced the relevant unknown parts of the Canadian Arctic to a quadrilateral area of about {{convert|181300|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Savours|1999|p=169}} It was into this unknown area that Franklin was to sail, heading west through [[Lancaster Sound]] and then west and south as ice, land, and other obstacles might allow, to complete the Northwest Passage. The distance to be navigated was roughly {{convert|1670|km|mi|-1}}.{{sfn|Cyriax|1939|pp=18–23}}

==Preparations==

===Command===
Barrow, who was 82 and nearing the end of his career, deliberated about who should command the expedition to complete the Northwest Passage and perhaps also find what Barrow believed to be an ice-free [[Open Polar Sea]] around the North Pole. Parry, his first choice, was tired of the Arctic and politely declined.{{sfn|Sandler|2006|pp=65–74}} His second choice, James Clark Ross, also declined because he had promised his new wife he was done with the Arctic.{{sfn|Sandler|2006|pp=65–74}} Barrow's third choice, [[James Fitzjames]], was rejected by the Admiralty on account of his youth.{{sfn|Sandler|2006|pp=65–74}} Barrow considered George Back but thought he was too argumentative.{{sfn|Sandler|2006|pp=65–74}} [[Francis Crozier]], another possibility, was of humble birth and Irish, which counted against him.{{sfn|Sandler|2006|pp=65–74}} Reluctantly, Barrow settled on the 59-year-old Franklin.{{sfn|Sandler|2006|pp=65–74}} The expedition was to consist of two ships, {{HMS|Erebus|1826|6}} and {{HMS|Terror|1813|6}}, each of which had seen Antarctic service with James Clark Ross. Franklin was given command of ''Erebus'', and Crozier, who had commanded ''Terror'' during the Antarctica expedition with Ross in 1841–44, was appointed the executive officer and commander of ''Terror''. Franklin received his expedition command on 7 February 1845, and his official instructions on 5 May 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gibson |first=William, F.R.G.S. |title=Sir John Franklin's Last Voyage: A brief history of the Franklin expedition and the outline of the researches which established the facts of its tragic outcome |journal=The Beaver |page=48 |date=June 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ships, provisions and crew===
''Erebus'' at 378 tons ([[Builder's Old Measurement|bm]]) and ''Terror'' at 331 tons (bm) were sturdily built, and were outfitted with recent inventions.{{sfn|Sandler|2006|p=70}} Steam engines were fitted in to drive a single screw in each vessel; these engines were former locomotives from the [[London &amp; Croydon Railway]]. They enabled the ships to make {{convert|7.4|km/h|kn|0|lk=out|abbr=on}} on their own power.{{sfn|Savours|1999|p=180}}

Other advanced technology included bows reinforced with heavy beams and plates of iron, an internal steam heating device for the comfort of the crew, screw propellers and iron rudders that could be withdrawn into iron wells to protect them from damage, ships' libraries of more than 1,000&amp;nbsp;books, and three&amp;nbsp;years' worth of conventionally preserved or tinned preserved food supplies.{{sfn|Sandler|2006|pp=71–73}} The latter was supplied from a provisioner, Stephen Goldner, who was awarded the contract on 1 April 1845, a mere seven weeks before Franklin set sail.{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|pp=25, 158}} Goldner worked frantically on the large and hasty order of 8,000&amp;nbsp;tins. The speed required affected [[quality control]] of a proportion of the tins manufactured, which were later found to have lead soldering that was "thick and sloppily done, and dripped like melted candle wax down the inside surface".{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|p=113}}

Most of the crew were Englishmen, many of them from [[Northern England]], as well as a small number of Irishmen and Scotsmen. Aside from Franklin, Crozier, and Lieutenant Graham Gore, the only other officers who were Arctic veterans were an assistant surgeon and the two icemasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Potter |first=Russell A.

===Australian connections===
Apart from Sir John Franklin himself, who was a former [[Governor of Tasmania|Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen's Land]], the crew included two people with close family connections to explorers of [[Australia]] who also died tragically.  Cmdr Henry Le Vesconte was the first cousin of [[William John Wills]], the co-leader of the 1861 [[Burke and Wills expedition]], the first to cross the Australian mainland from south to north; both Burke and Wills perished on the return journey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tww.id.au/family-history-wills/get/pam.html Wills Family History].

Gibson then remarked, "Oh, I had a brother who died with Franklin at the North Pole and my father had a great deal of trouble getting his pay from Government".&lt;ref&gt;Karma Abraham, "Looking for Gibson", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 11 September 1999, Good Weekend, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ships stopped briefly in Stromness Harbour in the  [[Orkney]] Islands in northern Scotland, and from there they sailed to [[Greenland]] with {{HMS|Rattler|1843|6}} and a transport ship, ''Barretto Junior''.{{sfn|Cookman|2000|p=74}}

At the Whalefish Islands in [[Disko Bay]], on the west coast of Greenland, 10&amp;nbsp;oxen carried by the transport ship were slaughtered for fresh meat; supplies were transferred to ''Erebus'' and ''Terror'', and crew members wrote their last letters home. Letters written on board told how Franklin banned swearing and drunkenness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Owen |first=Roderick |title=The fate of Franklin |publisher=[[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]] |year=1978 |location=London |page=236 |isbn=978-0-09-131190-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the expedition's final departure, five&amp;nbsp;men were discharged and sent home on ''Rattler'' and ''Barretto Junior'', reducing the ships' final crew size to 129.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cyriax|first=Richard J.|title=The Two Franklin Expedition Records Found on King William Island|publisher=Society for Nautical Research|location=Portsmouth, United Kingdom|journal=The Mariner's Mirror|year=1958|volume=44|issue=3|page=186|doi=10.1080/2F00253359.1958.10658393}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition was last seen by Europeans in late July 1845, when Captain Dannett of the whaler ''Prince of Wales'' and Captain Robert Martin of the whaler ''Enterprise'' encountered ''Terror'' and ''Erebus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SIR JOHN FRANKLIN'S EXPEDITION|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24992474/sir_john_franklins_expedition/|newspaper=[[The Morning Post]]|date=25 October 1845|page=5|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = October 31, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   in [[Baffin Bay]], waiting for good conditions to cross to Lancaster Sound.{{sfn|Cyriax|1939|pp=66–68}}

Over the next 150&amp;nbsp;years, other expeditions, explorers, scientists and interviews from native [[Inuit]] peoples would piece together what happened next. Franklin's men wintered in 1845–46 on [[Beechey Island]], where three crew members died and were buried. ''Terror'' and ''Erebus'' became trapped in ice off [[King William Island]] in September 1846 and are believed to have never sailed again. According to a [[Franklin's lost expedition#/media/File:Franklinexpeditionnote.jpg | note dated 25 April 1848]], and left on the island by Fitzjames and Crozier, Franklin had died on 11 June 1847; the crew had wintered on King William Island in 1846–47 and 1847–48, and the remaining crew had planned to begin walking on 26 April 1848 toward the [[Back River (Nunavut)|Back River]] on the Canadian mainland. Nine officers and fifteen men had already died; the rest would die along the way, most on the island and another 30 or 40 on the northern coast of the mainland, hundreds of miles from the nearest outpost of [[Western civilization]].{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|pp=19–50}}

==Early searches==
After two&amp;nbsp;years had passed with no word from Franklin, public concern grew and [[Jane Franklin|Lady Franklin]]—as well as members of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and British newspapers—urged the Admiralty to send a search party. In response, the Admiralty developed a three-pronged plan put into effect in the spring of 1848 that sent an [[Rae-Richardson Arctic Expedition|overland rescue party]], led by Sir [[John Richardson (naturalist)|John Richardson]] and [[John Rae (explorer)|John Rae]], down the [[MacKenzie River]] to the Canadian Arctic coast. Two expeditions by sea were also launched, one entering the Canadian Arctic [[archipelago]] through Lancaster Sound, and the other entering from the Pacific side.{{sfn|Savours|1999|pp=186–89}} In addition, the Admiralty offered a reward of £20,000 (£{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|20000|1848|r=-2}}}} as of {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}) "to any Party or Parties, of any country, who shall render assistance to the crews of the Discovery Ships under the command of Sir John Franklin".{{sfn|Sandler|2006|p=80}} After the three-pronged effort failed, British national concern and interest in the Arctic increased until "finding Franklin became nothing less than a crusade."{{sfn|Sandler|2006|pp=87–88}} Ballads such as "[[Lady Franklin's Lament]]", commemorating Lady Franklin's search for her lost husband, became popular.{{sfn|Sandler|2006|p=266}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Potter |first=Russell A |title=Songs and Ballads About Sir John Franklin |url=http://www.ric.edu/faculty/rpotter/ballad.html |date= |accessdate=26 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sir Edward Belcher by Stephen Pearce.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|[[Edward Belcher]]]]

In 1852, [[Edward Belcher]] was given command of the government [[Arctic]] expedition in search of Sir John Franklin. This was unsuccessful; Belcher's inability to render himself popular with his subordinates was peculiarly unfortunate in an Arctic voyage, and he was not wholly suited to command vessels among ice. Four of the five ships ({{HMS|Resolute|1850|6}}, ''Pioneer'', {{HMS|Assistance|1850|2}} and ''Intrepid''){{sfn|Mowat|1973|p=285}} were abandoned in [[pack ice]], for which Belcher was [[court-martial]]ed but acquitted. One of those ships, HMS ''Resolute'', was later recovered intact by an American whaler and returned to the United Kingdom. Timbers from the ship were later used to manufacture three desks, one of which, the [[Resolute desk]], was presented by [[Queen Victoria]] to the [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Rutherford B. Hayes]]; it has often been chosen by presidents for use in the [[Oval Office]] in the [[White House]].

In 1854, John Rae, while surveying the [[Boothia Peninsula]] for the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC), discovered further evidence of the expedition's fate. Rae met an [[Inuit|Inuk]] near [[Kugaaruk, Nunavut|Pelly Bay]] (now Kugaaruk, Nunavut) on 21 April 1854, who told him of a party of 35 to 40&amp;nbsp;white men who had died of starvation near the mouth of the Back River. Other Inuit confirmed this story, which included reports of [[cannibalism]] among the dying sailors. The Inuit showed Rae many objects that were identified as having belonged to Franklin and his men. In particular, Rae brought from the Inuit several silver forks and spoons later identified as belonging to Franklin, Fitzjames, Crozier, and Robert Osmer Sargent, a [[shipmate]] aboard ''Erebus''. Rae's report was sent to the Admiralty, which in October 1854 urged the HBC to send an expedition down the Back River to search for other signs of Franklin and his men.{{sfn|Klutschak|Barr|1989|pp=xv–xvi}}{{sfn|Savours|1999|pp=270–277}}

Next were Chief Factor James Anderson and HBC employee James Stewart, who travelled north by canoe to the mouth of the Back River. In July 1855, a band of Inuit told them of a group of ''qallunaat'' ([[Inuktitut]] for "whites") who had starved to death along the coast.{{sfn|Klutschak|Barr|1989|pp=xv–xvi}} In August, Anderson and Stewart found a piece of wood inscribed with "Erebus" and another that said "Mr. Stanley" (surgeon aboard ''Erebus'') on [[Montreal Island (Nunavut)|Montreal Island]] in [[Chantrey Inlet]], where the Back River meets the sea.{{sfn|Klutschak|Barr|1989|pp=xv–xvi}}

Despite the findings of Rae and Anderson, the Admiralty did not plan another search of its own. Britain officially labelled the crew deceased in service on 31 March 1854.{{sfn|Cookman|2000|p=2}} Lady Franklin, failing to convince the government to fund another search, personally commissioned [[McClintock Arctic Expedition|one more expedition]] under [[Francis Leopold McClintock]]. The expedition ship, the steam [[schooner]] ''[[Fox (ship)|Fox]]'', bought via public subscription, sailed from [[Aberdeen]] on 2 July 1857.

In April 1859, sledge parties set out from ''Fox'' to search on King William Island. On 5 May, the party led by Royal Navy Lieutenant William Hobson found a document in a [[cairn]] left by Crozier and Fitzjames.{{sfn|Cookman|2000|pp=8–9}} It contained two messages. The first, dated 28 May 1847, said that ''Erebus'' and ''Terror'' had wintered in the ice off the northwest coast of King William Island and had wintered earlier at Beechey Island after circumnavigating [[Cornwallis Island (Nunavut)|Cornwallis Island]]. "Sir John Franklin commanding the Expedition. ''All well''," the message said.{{sfn|Savours|1999|p=292}} The second message, written in the margins of that same sheet of paper, was much more ominous. Dated 25 April 1848, it reported that ''Erebus'' and ''Terror'' had been trapped in the ice for a year and a half and that the crew had abandoned the ships on 22 April. Twenty-four&amp;nbsp;officers and crew had died, including Franklin on 11 June 1847, just two weeks after the date of the first note. Crozier was commanding the expedition, and the 105&amp;nbsp;survivors planned to start out the next day, heading south towards the Back River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/arctic/note-transcript.html |title=NOVA Arctic Passage – The Note in the Cairn (transcript) |accessdate=31 January 2008 |work=PBS |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331205033/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/arctic/note-transcript.html |archivedate=31 March 2015 |dead-url=no |date= |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; This note contains significant errors; most notably, the date of the expedition's winter camp at Beechey Island is incorrectly given as 1846–47 rather than 1845–46.{{sfn|Woodman|1995|p=5}}

The McClintock expedition also found a human skeleton on the southern coast of King William Island. Still clothed, it was searched, and some papers were found, including a seaman's certificate for Chief Petty Officer Henry Peglar (b. 1808), Captain of the Foretop, HMS ''Terror''. However, since the uniform was that of a ship's steward, it is more likely that the body was that of Thomas Armitage, gun-room steward on ''Terror'' and a shipmate of Peglar, whose papers he carried.{{sfn|Savours|1999|pp=295–296}} At another site on the western extreme of the island, Hobson discovered a lifeboat containing two skeletons and relics from the Franklin expedition. In the boat was a large amount of abandoned equipment, including boots, silk handkerchiefs, scented soap, sponges, slippers, hair combs, and many books, among them a copy of ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]''. McClintock also took testimony from the Inuit about the expedition's disastrous end.{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|pp=34–40}}

Two expeditions between 1860 and 1869 by [[Charles Francis Hall]], who lived among the Inuit near [[Frobisher Bay]] on Baffin Island and later at [[Repulse Bay, Nunavut|Repulse Bay]] on the Canadian mainland, found camps, graves, and relics on the southern coast of King William Island, but he believed none of the Franklin expedition survivors would be found among the Inuit. In 1869 local Inuit took him to a shallow grave on King Edward Island containing well preserved skeletal remains and fragments of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Woodman, D.C. Unravelling the Franklin Mystery: Inuit Testimony. Montreal: McGill-Queens University Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; These remains were taken to England and interred beneath the Franklin Memorial at [[Greenwich Royal Naval College|Greenwich Old Royal Naval College]], London. The eminent biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] examined the remains and it was concluded that the remains were those of HTD Le Vesconte, a lieutenant on HMS ''Erebus''.&lt;ref&gt;Owen, R., The Fate of Franklin. London, Hutchinson, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; An examination in 2009 suggested that these were the remains of [[Harry Goodsir]], assistant surgeon on HMS ''Erebus''.&lt;ref&gt;Mays, S., et al., New light on the personal identification of a skeleton of a member of Sir John Franklin’s last expedition to the Arctic, 1845, Journal of Archaeological Science (2011), doi:10.1016/j.jas.2011.02.022&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although Hall concluded that all of the Franklin crew were dead, he believed that the official expedition records would yet be found under a stone cairn.{{sfn|Schwatka|1965|pp=12–15}} With the assistance of his guides Ebierbing and [[Tookoolito]], Hall gathered hundreds of pages of Inuit testimony. Among these materials are accounts of visits to Franklin's ships, and an encounter with a party of white men on the southern coast of King William Island near Washington Bay. In the 1990s, this testimony was extensively researched by David C. Woodman, and was the basis of two books, ''Unravelling the Franklin Mystery'' (1992) and ''Strangers Among Us'' (1995), in which he reconstructs the final months of the expedition.

The hope of finding these lost papers led Lieutenant [[Frederick Schwatka]] of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] to organise an expedition to the island between 1878 and 1880. Traveling to [[Hudson Bay]] on the schooner ''Eothen'', Schwatka, assembling a team that included Inuit who had assisted Hall, continued north by foot and [[dog sled]], interviewing Inuit, visiting known or likely sites of Franklin expedition remains, and wintering on King William Island. Although Schwatka failed to find the hoped-for papers, in a speech at a dinner given in his honour by the [[American Geographical Society]] in 1880, he noted that his expedition had made "the longest sledge journey ever made both in regard to time and distance"{{sfn|Schwatka|1965|pp=115–116}} of 11 months and 4 days and {{convert|4360|km|mi}}, that it was the first Arctic expedition on which the whites relied entirely on the same diet as the Inuit, and that it established the loss of the Franklin records "beyond all reasonable doubt".{{sfn|Schwatka|1965|pp=115–116}} The Schwatka expedition found no remnants of the expedition south of a place known as Starvation Cove on the [[Adelaide Peninsula]]. This was well north of Crozier's stated goal, the Back River, and several hundred miles away from the nearest Western outpost, on the [[Great Slave Lake]]. Woodman wrote of Inuit reports that between 1852 and 1858 Crozier and one other expedition member were seen in the [[Baker Lake, Nunavut|Baker Lake]] area, about {{convert|400|km|mi}} to the south, where in 1948 [[Farley Mowat]] found "a very ancient cairn, not of normal Eskimo construction" inside which were shreds of a hardwood box with [[dovetail joint]]s.{{sfn|Woodman|1992|p=317}}&lt;ref&gt;Woodman was unable to track down the origin of these Inuit reports, and the builder or origins of the cairn found by Mowat are unknown.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern expeditions==

===King William Island excavations (1981–82)===
In June 1981, [[Owen Beattie]], a professor of anthropology at the [[University of Alberta]], began the 1845–48 Franklin Expedition Forensic Anthropology Project (FEFAP) when he and his team of researchers and field assistants travelled from [[Edmonton]] to King William Island, traversing the island's western coast as Franklin's men did 132&amp;nbsp;years before. FEFAP hoped to find artifacts and skeletal remains in order to use modern [[Forensic science|forensics]] to establish identities and causes of death among the lost 129.{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|pp=51–52}}

Although the trek found archaeological artifacts related to 19th-century Europeans and undisturbed [[Disarticulation|disarticulated]] human remains, Beattie was disappointed that more remains were not found.{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|p=58}} Examining the bones of Franklin crewmen, he noted areas of pitting and scaling often found in cases of [[Vitamin C]] deficiency, the cause of [[scurvy]].{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|p=56}} After returning to Edmonton, he compared notes from the survey with James Savelle, an Arctic archaeologist, and noticed skeletal patterns suggesting [[cannibalism]].{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|pp=58–62}} Seeking information about the Franklin crew's health and diet, he sent bone samples to the Alberta Soil and Feed Testing Laboratory for [[trace element]] analysis and assembled another team to visit King William Island. The analysis would find an unexpected level of 226&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million]] (ppm) of lead in the crewman's bones, which was 10&amp;nbsp;times higher than the [[Scientific control|control]] samples, taken from Inuit skeletons from the same geographic area, of 26–36&amp;nbsp;ppm.{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|p=83}}

In June 1982, a team made up of Beattie and three students (Walt Kowall, a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Alberta; Arne Carlson, an archaeology and geography student from Simon Fraser University in British Columbia; and Arsien Tungilik, an Inuk student and field assistant) was flown to the west coast of King William Island where they retraced some of the steps of McClintock in 1859 and Schwatka in 1878–79.{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|p=63}} Discoveries during this expedition included the remains of between six and fourteen men in the vicinity of McClintock's "boat place" and artifacts including a complete boot sole fitted with makeshift cleats for better traction.{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|pp=77–82}}

===Beechey Island excavations and exhumations (1984–86)===
After returning to Edmonton in 1982 and learning of the lead-level findings from the 1981 expedition, Beattie struggled to find a cause. Possibilities included the lead [[solder]] used to seal the expedition's food tins, other food containers lined with lead foil, [[food colouring]], [[tobacco products]], [[pewter]] tableware, and lead-[[Candle wick|wicked]] candles. He came to suspect that the problems of lead poisoning compounded by the effects of scurvy could have been lethal for the Franklin crew. However, because skeletal lead might reflect lifetime exposure rather than exposure limited to the voyage, Beattie's theory could be tested only by forensic examination of preserved soft tissue as opposed to bone. Beattie decided to examine the graves of the buried crewmen on Beechey Island.{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|pp=83–85}}

[[File:BeecheyIsland Graves.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Graves of the crewmen buried on [[Beechey Island]] (2004)]]

After obtaining legal permission,{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|pp=86–87}} Beattie's team visited Beechey Island in August 1984 to perform autopsies on the three crewmen buried there.{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|p=85}} They started with the first crew member to die, Leading Stoker John Torrington.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180313021108/http://preservedremains.wikispaces.com/John%20Torrington Torrington's preserved remains]&lt;/ref&gt; After completing Torrington's autopsy and exhuming and briefly examining the body of [[John Hartnell]], the team, pressed for time and threatened by the weather, returned to Edmonton with tissue and bone samples.{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|pp=111–120}} Trace element analysis of Torrington's bones and hair indicated that the crewman "would have suffered severe mental and physical problems caused by lead poisoning".{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|p=123}} Although the autopsy indicated that pneumonia had been the ultimate cause of the crewman's death, lead poisoning was cited as a contributing factor.{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|pp=122–123}}

During the expedition, the team visited a place about {{convert|1|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} north of the grave site to examine fragments of hundreds of food tins discarded by Franklin's men. Beattie noted that the seams were poorly soldered with lead, which had likely come in direct contact with the food.{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|p=158}}&lt;ref name="LLTissues1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kowall |first1=W.A. |last2=Krahn |first2=P.M. |last3=Beattie |first3=O. B. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Lead Levels in Human Tissues from the Franklin Forensic Project |journal=International Journal Environmental Analytical Chemistry |volume=35 |issue=2 |page=121 |year=1989 |publisher=Gordon and Breach Science Publishers |doi=10.1080/03067318908028385}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of findings from the 1984 expedition and the photo of Torrington, a 138-year-old corpse well preserved by [[permafrost]] in the [[tundra]], led to wide media coverage and renewed interest in the lost Franklin expedition.

Subsequent research has suggested that another potential source for the lead may have been the ships' fresh-water systems rather than the tinned food. K.T.H. Farrer argued that "it is impossible to see how one could ingest from the canned food the amount of lead, 3.3&amp;nbsp;mg per day over eight months, required to raise the PbB to the level 80&amp;nbsp;μg/dL at which symptoms of lead poisoning begin to appear in adults and the suggestion that bone lead in adults could be 'swamped' by lead ingested from food over a period of a few months, or even three years, seems scarcely tenable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=K. T. H. |last=Farrer |title=Lead and the Last Franklin Expedition |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science |volume=20 |issue=4 |year=1993 |pages=399–409 |doi=10.1006/jasc.1993.1024}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, tinned food was in widespread use within the Royal Navy at that time and its use did not lead to any significant increase in lead poisoning elsewhere. However, and uniquely for this expedition only, the ships were fitted with converted railway [[Steam locomotive|locomotive]] engines for auxiliary propulsion which required an estimated one tonne of fresh water per hour when steaming. It is highly probable that it was for this reason that the ships were fitted with a unique [[Desalination|water distillation]] system which, given the materials in use at the time, would have produced large quantities of water with a very high lead content. William Battersby has argued that this is a much more likely source for the high levels of lead observed in the remains of expedition members than the tinned food.&lt;ref name="Battersby"/&gt;

A further survey of the graves was undertaken in 1986. A camera crew filmed the procedure, shown in ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'''s television documentary, ''Buried in Ice'' in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |first=Owen |last=Beattie |title=Buried in Ice |medium=television |publisher=WGHB and NOVA |location=Beechey Island |date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under difficult field conditions, Derek Notman, a [[radiologist]] and medical doctor from the [[University of Minnesota]], and radiology technician Larry Anderson took many [[X-ray]]s of the crewmen prior to autopsy. Barbara Schweger, an [[Arctic clothing]] specialist, and Roger Amy, a [[pathologist]], assisted in the investigation.{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|pp=130–145}}

Beattie and his team had noticed that someone else had attempted to exhume Hartnell. In the effort, a pickaxe had damaged the wooden lid of his coffin, and the coffin plaque was missing.{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|p=116}} Research in Edmonton later showed that Sir Edward Belcher, commander of one of the Franklin rescue expeditions, had ordered the exhumation of Hartnell in October 1852, but was thwarted by the permafrost. A month later, [[Edward Augustus Inglefield|Edward A. Inglefield]], commander of another rescue expedition, succeeded with the exhumation and removed the coffin plaque.{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|pp=116–118}}

Unlike Hartnell's grave, the grave of Private William Braine was largely intact.{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|pp=146–47}} When he was exhumed, the survey team saw signs that his burial had been hasty. His arms, body, and head had not been positioned carefully in the coffin, and one of his undershirts had been put on backwards.{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|p=150}} The coffin seemed too small for him; its lid had pressed down on his nose. A large copper plaque with his name and other personal data punched into it adorned his coffin lid.{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|p=148}}

===NgLj-2 excavations (1992)===
In 1992, a team of archaeologists and [[forensic anthropologist]]s identified a site, which they referenced as "NgLj-2", on the western shores of King William Island. The site matches the physical description of Leopold McClintock's "boat place". Excavations there uncovered nearly 400 bones and bone fragments, and physical artefacts ranging from pieces of clay pipes to buttons and brass fittings. Examination of these bones by Anne Keenleyside, the expedition's forensic scientist, showed elevated levels of lead and many cut-marks "consistent with de-fleshing". On the basis of this expedition, it has become generally accepted that at least some groups of Franklin's men resorted to cannibalism in their final distress.&lt;ref name="Keenleyside" /&gt; On 18 June 2015, a study accepted for publication in the ''[[International Journal of Osteoarchaeology]]'' concluded that in addition to the de-fleshing of bones, 35 "bones had signs of breakage and 'pot polishing,' which occurs when the ends of bones heated in boiling water rub against the cooking pot they are placed in", which "typically occurs in the end stage of cannibalism, when starving people extract the [[bone marrow|marrow]] to eke out the last bit of calories and nutrition they can."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ghose |first=Tia |title=Cracked Bones Reveal Cannibalism by Doomed Arctic Explorers |url=http://www.seeker.com/cracked-bones-reveal-cannibalism-by-doomed-arctic-explorers-1770042202.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529100011/http://www.seeker.com/cracked-bones-reveal-cannibalism-by-doomed-arctic-explorers-1770042202.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 May 2016 |date=22 July 2015 |publisher=Discovery Communications |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wreck searches (1992–93)===
In 1992, Franklin author David C. Woodman, with the help of [[magnetometer]] expert Brad Nelson, organised "Project Ootjoolik" to search for the wreck reported by Inuit testimony to lie off the waters of Adelaide Peninsula. Enlisting both a [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] and a Canadian Forces patrol aircraft, each fitted with a sensitive magnetometer, a large search area to the west of Grant Point was surveyed from an elevation of {{convert|200|ft|m}}. Over 60 strong magnetic targets were identified, of which five were deemed to have characteristics most congruent to those expected from Franklin's ships.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In 1993, Dr. Joe McInnis and Woodman organised an attempt to identify the priority targets from the year before. A chartered aircraft landed on the ice at three of the locations, a hole was drilled through the ice, and a small sector-scan [[sonar]] was used to image the sea bottom. However, due to ice conditions and uncertain navigation, it was not possible to exactly confirm the locations of the holes, and nothing was found although hitherto-unknown depths were found at the locations that were consistent with Inuit testimony of the wreck.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===King William Island (1994–95)===
In 1994 Woodman organised and led a land search of the area from [[Richard Collinson Inlet]] to (modern) Victory Point in search of the buried "vaults" spoken of in the testimony of the contemporary Inuit hunter Supunger. A ten person team spent ten days in the search, sponsored by the [[Royal Canadian Geographical Society]], and filmed by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] ''Focus North''. No trace of the vaults was found.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In 1995, an expedition was jointly organised by Woodman, George Hobson, and American adventurer Steven Trafton – with each party planning a separate search. Trafton's group travelled to the [[Clarence Islands]] to investigate Inuit stories of a "white man's cairn" there but found nothing. Dr. Hobson's party, accompanied by archaeologist Margaret Bertulli, investigated the "summer camp" found a few miles to the south of Cape Felix, where some minor Franklin relics were found. Woodman, with two companions, travelled south from Wall Bay to Victory Point and investigated all likely campsites along this coast, finding only some rusted cans at a previously unknown campsite near Cape Maria Louisa.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Wreck searches (1997–2013)===
In 1997, a "Franklin 150" expedition was mounted by the Canadian film company Eco-Nova to use sonar to investigate more of the priority magnetic targets found in 1992. The senior archaeologist was Robert Grenier, assisted by Margaret Bertulli, and Woodman again acted as expedition historian and search coordinator. Operations were conducted from the [[CCGS Sir Wilfrid Laurier|Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker ''Laurier'']]. Approximately {{convert|40|km2|mi2}} were surveyed, without result, near Kirkwall Island. When detached parties found Franklin relics, primarily copper sheeting and small items, on the beaches of islets to the north of O'Reilly Island the search was diverted to that area, but poor weather prevented significant survey work before the expedition ended. A documentary, ''Oceans of Mystery: Search for the Lost Fleet'', was produced by Eco-Nova about this expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oceansdiscovery.com/about-us/impressum/oceans-of-mystery-documentary.html |title=Oceans Of Mystery Documentary |work=Oceans Discovery |accessdate=10 September 2014 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910200101/http://www.oceansdiscovery.com/about-us/impressum/oceans-of-mystery-documentary.html |archive-date=10 September 2014 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three expeditions were mounted by Woodman to continue the magnetometer mapping of the proposed wreck sites, a privately sponsored expedition in 2001, and the Irish-Canadian Franklin Search Expeditions of 2002 and 2004. These made use of sled-drawn magnetometers working on the sea ice and completed the unfinished survey of the northern (Kirkwall Island) search area (2001), and the entire southern O'Reilly Island area (2002 and 2004). All high-priority magnetic targets were identified by sonar through the ice as geological in origin. In 2002 and 2004, small Franklin artefacts and characteristic explorer tent sites were found on a small islet northeast of O'Reilly Island during shore searches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Charles |url=http://www.ric.edu/faculty/rpotter/woodman/2004_Field_Report_short.htm |title=Irish-Canadian Franklin Search Expedition, 2004 |publisher=Rhode Island College |accessdate=10 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150605015105/http://www.ric.edu/faculty/rpotter/woodman/2004_Field_Report_short.htm |archivedate=5 June 2015 |dead-url=no |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, a new search was announced, to be led by Robert Grenier, a senior archaeologist with [[Parks Canada]]. This search hoped to take advantage of the improved ice conditions, using [[side-scan sonar]] from a boat in open water. Grenier also hoped to draw from newly published Inuit testimony collected by oral historian [[Dorothy Harley Eber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Robert |last=Grenier |title=Full Proposals for IPY 2007–2008 Activities |date=1 May 2009 |url=http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=330 |publisher=International Polar Year |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429214941/http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=330 |archivedate=29 April 2011 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Eber's informants have placed the location of one of Franklin's ships in the vicinity of the [[Royal Geographical Society Island]], an area not searched by previous expeditions. The search was to also include local Inuit historian Louie Kamookak, who has found other significant remains of the expedition and would represent the indigenous culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gilles |first=Rob |title=Canada to Search for Arctic Explorer's Ships |agency=Associated Press |date=16 August 2008 |url=http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080816/D92J5FK00.html |publisher=IAC Search &amp; Media |accessdate=17 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080826031138/http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080816/D92J5FK00.html |archivedate=26 August 2008 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific conclusions===

In 2017, [[Douglas Stenton]], director for heritage in the Nunavut territory in north eastern Canada, suggested that four sets of European human remains found could possibly be women. He initially suspected that [[DNA]] testing would not offer up anything more, but to his surprise they registered that there was no [[Y chromosome|'Y' chromosomal]] element to the DNA. Stenton acknowledged that women were known to have served in the Royal Navy in the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries, but he also pointed out that it could be that the DNA had simply degraded as further tests proved ambiguous. Stenton also stated that whilst the probability of four disguised women aboard the two ships was very, very low; he could not rule it out completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whipple|first1=Tom|title=Arctic bones could rewrite a boy's own adventure tale|work=The Times|issue=72209|date=28 April 2017|page=21|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other factors==
Franklin's chosen passage down the west side of King William Island took ''Erebus'' and ''Terror'' into "a ploughing train of ice ... [that] does not always clear during the short summers",{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|p=42}} whereas the route along the island's east coast regularly clears in summer{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|p=42}} and was later used by [[Roald Amundsen]] in his successful navigation of the Northwest Passage. The Franklin expedition, locked in ice for two winters in [[Victoria Strait]], was naval in nature and therefore not well-equipped or trained for land travel. Some of the crew members heading south from ''Erebus'' and ''Terror'' hauled many items not needed for Arctic survival. McClintock noted a large quantity of heavy goods in the lifeboat at the "boat place" and thought them "a mere accumulation of dead weight, of little use, and very likely to break down the strength of the sledge-crews".{{sfn|Beattie|Geiger|1987|pp=39–40}}

==Legacy==

===Historical===
The most meaningful outcome of the Franklin expedition was the mapping of several thousand miles of hitherto unsurveyed coastline by expeditions searching for Franklin's lost ships and crew. As Richard Cyriax noted, "the loss of the expedition probably added much more [geographical] knowledge than its successful return would have done".{{sfn|Cyriax|1939|p=198}} At the same time, it largely quelled the Admiralty's appetite for Arctic exploration. There was a gap of many years before the [[British Arctic Expedition|Nares expedition]] and Nares' declaration there was "no thoroughfare" to the North Pole; his words marked the end of the Royal Navy's historical involvement in Arctic exploration, the end of an era in which such exploits were widely seen by the British public as worthy expenditures of human effort and monetary resources. Given how difficult and risky it was for professional explorers to cross the Northwest passage, it would be impossible for the average merchant ships of the day to use this route for trade.

As a writer for ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'' put it, "We think that we can fairly make out the account between the cost and results of these Arctic Expeditions, and ask whether it is worth while to risk so much for that which is so difficult of attainment, and when attained, is so worthless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]] |date=1 October 1859 |title=unknown |page=315 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The navigation of the Northwest Passage in 1903–05 by [[Roald Amundsen]] with the ''[[Gjøa]]'' expedition effectively ended the centuries-long quest for the Northwest Passage.

===Cultural===
[[File:Franklin statue.jpg|thumb|right|150px|upright|Statue of John Franklin in his home town of [[Spilsby]], [[Lincolnshire]], England.]]
[[File:Francis Crozier monument in Banbridge, County Down, Ireland.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of Francis Crozier in his home town of [[Banbridge]], County Down.]]
For years after the loss of the Franklin Party, the Victorian media portrayed Franklin as a hero who led his men in the quest for the Northwest Passage. A statue of Franklin in his home town bears the inscription "Sir John Franklin – Discoverer of the North West Passage", and statues of Franklin outside the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum]] in London and in [[Tasmania]] bear similar inscriptions. Although the expedition's fate, including the possibility of cannibalism, was widely reported and debated, Franklin's standing with the Victorian public was undiminished. The expedition has been the subject of numerous works of non-fiction, including two books by [[Ken McGoogan]], ''[[Fatal Passage]]'' and ''[[Lady Franklin's Revenge]]''.

The mystery surrounding Franklin's last expedition was the subject of a 2006 episode of the [[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]] television series ''[[Arctic Passage]]''; a 2007 television documentary, "Franklin's Lost Expedition", on ''Discovery HD Theatre''; as well as a 2008 Canadian documentary, ''[[Passage (2008 film)|Passage]]''. In an episode of the 2009 ITV1 travel documentary series ''[[Billy Connolly: Journey to the Edge of the World]]'', presenter Connolly and his crew visited Beechey Island, filmed the gravesite, and gave details of the Franklin expedition.

In memory of the lost expedition, one of Canada's [[Northwest Territories]] subdivisions was known as the [[District of Franklin]]. Including the high Arctic islands; this jurisdiction was abolished when the area was set off into the newly created Nunavut Territory on 1 April 1999.

On 29 October 2009, a special service of thanksgiving was held in the chapel at the [[Old Royal Naval College]] in Greenwich, to accompany the rededication of the national monument to Franklin there. The service also included the solemn re-interment of the remains of Lieutenant Henry Thomas Dundas Le Vesconte, the only remains ever repatriated to England, entombed within the monument in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lewis-Jones |first=Huw |url=http://www.ric.edu/faculty/rpotter/temp/HLJ_Franklin_Monument.pdf |title=Nelsons of Discovery: Notes on the Franklin Monument in Greenwich |format=PDF |accessdate=19 May 2011 |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, a group of polar authors went to London's [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] to pay their respects to the Arctic explorers buried there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Russell |last=Potter |url=http://visionsnorth.blogspot.com/2010/07/thoughts-on-mcclure-and-hms.html |title=Online Blog at McClure's Memorial in London |publisher=Russell Potter (blog) |via=Visionsnorth.blogspot.com |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other veterans of the searches for Franklin are buried there too, including Admiral Sir [[Horatio Thomas Austin]], Admiral Sir George Back, Admiral Sir Edward Augustus Inglefield, Admiral [[Bedford Pim]], and Admiral Sir John Ross. Franklin's wife [[Jane Griffin]], Lady Franklin, is also interred at Kensal Green in the vault, and commemorated on a marble cross dedicated to her niece Sophia Cracroft.

====Portrayal in fiction and the arts====
From the 1850s through to the present day, Franklin's last expedition inspired numerous literary works. Among the first was a play, ''[[The Frozen Deep]]'', written by [[Wilkie Collins]] with assistance and production by [[Charles Dickens]]. The play was performed for private audiences at [[Tavistock House]] early in 1857, as well as at the [[Royal Gallery of Illustration]] (including a command performance for [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]), and for the public at the Manchester Trade Union Hall. News of Franklin's death in 1859 inspired elegies, including one by [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]].

[[File:'The English at the Noth Pole' by Riou and Montaut 002.jpg|thumb|220x220px|left|Illustration by [[Édouard Riou]] for the title page of [[Jules Verne]]'s ''Voyages et aventures du capitaine Hatteras'' (''[[Journeys and Adventures of Captain Hatteras]]'')]]

Fictional treatments of the final Franklin expedition begin with [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Journeys and Adventures of Captain Hatteras]]'', (1866), in which the novel's hero seeks to retrace Franklin's footsteps and discovers that the [[North Pole]] is dominated by an enormous volcano. [[Mark Twain]] briefly satirized the fate of the expedition and its subsequent searches in the beginning of the story "Some Learned Fables for Good Old Boys and Girls" (1875).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/1545/ Full text]&lt;/ref&gt; The German novelist [[Sten Nadolny]]'s ''[[The Discovery of Slowness]]'' (1983; English translation 1987) takes on the entirety of Franklin's life, touching only briefly on his last expedition. Other recent novelistic treatments of Franklin include [[William T. Vollmann]]'s ''[[The Rifles (novel)|The Rifles]]'' (1994), John Wilson's ''North With Franklin: The Journals of James Fitzjames'' (1999); and [[Dan Simmons]]'s ''[[The Terror (novel)|The Terror]]'' (2007), which was developed as a 2018 [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] television series [[The Terror (TV series)|also called ''The Terror'']]. The expedition has also been the subject of a horror role-playing game supplement, ''The Walker in the Wastes''. Most recently, [[Clive Cussler]]'s 2008 novel ''[[Arctic Drift]]'' incorporates the ordeal of the Franklin expedition as a central element in the story, and [[Richard Flanagan]]'s ''[[Wanting (novel)|Wanting]]'' (2009) deals with Franklin's deeds in both Tasmania and the Arctic. On 12 January 2012, [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast "Erebus," a radio play based on the Franklin expedition by British poet [[Jo Shapcott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0196td4 |title=Erebus |work=BBC |accessdate=10 September 2014 |date=12 January 2012 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kassandra Alvarado's 2013 novel ''The White Passage'' present a vaguely science-fiction take on an alternative history of the lost expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-white-passage-kassandra-alvarado/1115446649?ean=2940044544420|title=The White Passage|last=Alvarado|first=Kassandra|publisher=Smashwords|year=2013|isbn=9781301113293|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the visual arts, the loss of Franklin's expedition inspired a number of paintings in both the United States and Britain. In 1861, [[Frederic Edwin Church]] unveiled his great canvas ''[[The Icebergs]]''; later that year, prior to taking it to England for exhibition, he added an image of a broken ship's mast in silent tribute to Franklin. In 1864, [[Edwin Henry Landseer|Sir Edwin Landseer]]'s ''[[Man Proposes, God Disposes]]'' caused a stir at the annual Royal Academy exhibition; its depiction of two polar bears, one chewing on a tattered ship's ensign, the other gnawing on a human ribcage, was seen at the time as in poor taste, but has remained one of the most powerful imaginings of the expedition's final fate. The expedition also inspired numerous popular engravings and illustrations, along with many panoramas, [[diorama]]s, and [[magic lantern]] shows.{{sfn|Potter|2007}}

[[File:Manproposesgoddisposes.jpg|thumb|''[[Man Proposes, God Disposes]]'' by [[Edwin Henry Landseer]], 1864|left]]Franklin's last expedition also inspired a great deal of music, beginning with the ballad "[[Lady Franklin's Lament]]" (also known as "Lord Franklin"), which originated in the 1850s and has been recorded by dozens of artists, among them [[Martin Carthy]], [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]], and [[The Pearlfishers (band)|The Pearlfishers]]. The British folk metal band [[Alestorm]]'s song "Magnetic North" is dedicated to the expedition. Other Franklin-inspired songs include [[Fairport Convention]]'s "I'm Already There", and [[James Taylor]]'s "Frozen Man" (based on Beattie's photographs of John Torrington). Canadian composer [[Henry Kucharzyk]]'s 1997 ''Terror and Erebus (A Lament for Franklin)'' is an [[oratorio]] for solo baritone and chamber ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soundmakers.ca/soundstreams-commissions/terror-erebus-henry-kucharzyk|title=Terror and Erebus (A Lament for Franklin)|last=Kucharzyk|first=Henry|date=17 June 1997|website=Soundmakers, produced by Soundstreams|access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first operatic treatment of the story is ''Terror &amp; Erebus'', a [[chamber opera]] for six singers and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] quartet by Canadian composer Cecilia Livingston, to premiere in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://terroranderebus.com/|title=Terror &amp; Erebus, a chamber opera for six singers and percussion quartet.|last=Livingston|first=Cecilia|date=2018|website=|access-date=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, traditional Irish composer and [[Sean-nós song|Sean Nós]] singer, Lorcán Mac Mathúna, working with composers Simon O Connor and Daire Bracken, composed a song cycle named ''Tásc is Tuairisc'' (Account and Death Notice) based on the expedition. A minimalist 30 minute cycle for voice, piano, and fiddle, in Irish, it tracks an individual's descent into madness and isolation. Two songs from the cycle, "Farraigí an Tuaiscirt" and "Cladach an Bháis" were released on the 2015 album ''Preab Meadar''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The influence of the Franklin expedition on [[Canadian literature]] and culture has been especially significant. Among the best-known modern Franklin ballads is "[[Northwest Passage (song)|Northwest Passage]]" by the late Ontario folksinger [[Stan Rogers]] (1981), which has been referred to as the unofficial Canadian national anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia |last=Gudgeon |first=Chris |title=Rogers, Stan |encyclopaedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica Foundation of Canada |year=2008 |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0006907 |accessdate=2 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinguished Canadian novelist [[Margaret Atwood]] has also spoken of Franklin's expedition as a sort of national myth of Canada, remarking that "In every culture many stories are told, (but) only some are told and retold, and these stories bear examining ... in Canadian literature, one such story is the Franklin expedition."{{sfn|Atwood|1995|p=11}} Notable treatments by Canadian poets include a verse play for radio, ''Terror and Erebus'' which was commissioned from [[Gwendolyn MacEwen]], broadcast by [[CBC Radio]] (10 January 1965) and subsequently published in her collection ''Afterworlds'' (1987);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creative Canada: A Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Creative and Performing Artists|last=McGregor Rodney|first=Helen, ed.|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=Vols. 1–2, 204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Solway]]'s verse cycle, ''Franklin's Passage'' (2003). The events have also featured prominently in Canadian novels, including [[Mordecai Richler]]'s ''[[Solomon Gursky Was Here]]'' (1989) and [[Dominique Fortier]]'s 2008 French language novel, ''Du bon usage des étoiles'', which creatively considers the Franklin expedition from a variety of perspectives and genres&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editionsalto.com/depots/Fiche-Usage.pdf Fiche] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305110107/http://www.editionsalto.com/depots/Fiche-Usage.pdf |date=5 March 2016 }} (pdf, 3 p., French) for teachers)&lt;/ref&gt; and was both shortlisted and a finalist for several literary awards in Canada ([[2009 Governor General's Awards#French|2009 Governor General's Awards]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editionsalto.com/fiche.php?no_livre=582 www.editionsalto.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305120359/http://www.editionsalto.com/fiche.php?no_livre=582 |date=5 March 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheila Fischman]]'s translation of Fortier's novel, ''On the Proper Use of Stars'', was shortlisted for the [[2010 Governor General's Awards#French|2010 Governor General's Awards]] for French to English Translation. Irish-Canadian writer [[Ed O'Loughlin]]'s novel ''Minds of Winter'' was shortlisted for the 2017 [[Giller Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotiabankgillerprize.ca/2017-longlist/ed-oloughlin/|title=Scotiabank Giller Prize {{!}} Ed O’Loughlin|website=Scotiabank Giller Prize|access-date=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3452">{{nihongo|'''Genkai shūraku'''|限界集落||literally ''limited village'', also translated as ''marginal village''}} is any village in Japan that has experienced depopulation and in danger of disappearing altogether, largely because more than half of the people living in the village are [[Aging of Japan|over the age of 65]].

Such villages are generally found in mountain villages and outlying islands. Villages facing this sort of situation have seen the functions of a community - local government autonomy, maintaining of roads, and ceremonial occasions - rapidly declining, and are facing losing these altogether.

== History ==
Akira Ōno, a professor of emeritus at Nagano University first proposed the concept in 1991 while teaching humanities at [[Kōchi University]].

A number of surveys have been conducted to explore the phenomenon. In 2005 the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan)|Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries]] commissioned a committee on rural development to do a survey on the true state of genkai shuraku (March 2006). According to the results, there were an estimated 1403 villages that were found to be in danger. These results were based on census results in agricultural villages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maff.go.jp/nouson/seisaku/community/report.pdf 調査結果] - 「限界集落における集落機能の実態等に関する調査」、財団法人農村開発企画委員会&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2006, the [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Japan)|Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism]] commissioned a survey on the state of depopulating areas. The report stated that, of the 62,273 villages that were visited, 775 of them were depopulating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlit.go.jp/singikai/kokudosin/keikaku/jiritsu/9/03.pdf 調査報告] - 過疎地域等における集落の状況に関するアンケート調査、国土交通省&lt;br&gt;[http://www.mlit.go.jp/kisha/kisha07/02/020817/01.pdf 平成18年度「国土形成計画策定のための集落の状況に関する現況把握調査」～最終報告～] - 国土交通省、[http://www.mlit.go.jp/kisha/kisha07/02/020817/02.pdf 国土形成計画策定のための集落の状況に関する現況把握調査（図表編）] - 国土交通省&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Geology of Azerbaijan''' forms a constituent geological part of the [[Alpine Orogeny|Alpine fold belt]]. Sedimentary deposits embracing the southwestern parts of the Major and Minor [[Caucasus]], including the intermountain [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kur River]] trough, as well as the Mid- and South [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] basins consist of diversity fold systems. The [[Earth's crust]] thickness in [[Azerbaijan]] varies in the range from 38 to 55&amp;nbsp;km. Its maximum thickness is observed in the Minor Caucasus area, while its minimum thickness is typical for the Talysh foothills. Geological setting of the area consists of sedimentary, volcanic-sedimentary, volcanic and terrestrial deposits embracing almost entire stratigraphic range beginning from [[Pre-Cambrian]] through [[Holocene]] time.

==Minerals==
[[Azerbaijan]] is rich of fuel [[ore]] and non-ore [[mineral]]s. Ore and non-ore minerals are spread mostly in mountainous territories (Small and Great [[Caucasus]]), [[fossil fuel]]s in plain territories and South Caspian basin. In its turn, it caused development of ore industry in west and oil-gas industry in east.

===Fossil-fuel resources===
[[Image:102 329 nobel oilwells.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Nobel Brothers]] oil wells in [[Balakhani]], a suburb of [[Baku]].]]
{{Main|Oil Industry in Azerbaijan}}
Fossil-fuel resources in Azerbaijan are presented by oil, gas, oil shale, peat etc. The [[petroleum]] industry is the most important sector of the local economy. Oil is produced from both onshore and [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] offshore oilfields. Azerbaijan (particularly [[Absheron Peninsula]]) is referred to as the world's most ancient oil producing region. Even during 7th–6th centuries BC oil had been extracted within the [[Absheron Peninsula]] and exported to many different countries.
As of 1985 about 1.2B tons of crude oil has been produced in Azerbaijan (25% of which from offshore oilfields).

===Metalliferous ore resources===
Metalliferous ores ([[magnetite]] and [[hematite]]) in Azerbaijan fall into four generic classes: [[magma]]tic segregation, [[skarn]]-magnetite (contact-metasomatic), [[hydrothermal]]- [[Metasomatism|metasomatic]] and [[sedimentary]] ones.

==Non-metallic mineral resources==
Non-metallic mineral resources play a significant role in Azerbaijan's total balance of row material resources. That group of row materials includes [[rock salt]], [[gypsum]], [[anhydrite]], [[alum]], [[bentonite clay]], [[construction materials]], [[pyrite]], [[borate]], [[gemstone]]s (precious and semi-precious stone), [[dolomite]], [[Iceland spar]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gia.az/ The Geology Institute of the Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underground water==
Underground water is considered to be one of the most important natural resources in Azerbaijan. Due to the differences in chemical composition, they fall into several types, such as service water, drinkable, medical waters, and waters used in various industrial sectors.

==Mud volcanoes==
{{see also|Gobustan National Park|Gobustan State Reserve}}
It is estimated that 300 of the planet's estimated 700 [[mud volcano]]es sit in Eastern [[Azerbaijan]] and the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai112_folder/112_articles/112_mud_volcano.html 11.2 Mud Volcanoes – Mysterious Phenomena Fascinate Scientists and Tourists by Ronnie Gallagher&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mud volcanoes are pervasive within Azerbaijan. In local language, mud volcanoes are also known as "pilpila", "yanardag", "bozdagh", "ahtarma", "gaynarja" etc. There are over 220 mud volcanoes in Azerbaijan ([[Absheron Peninsula]], [[Gobustan National Park|Gobustan]], southeast [[Shirvan]] plain, [[Samur, Azerbaijan|Samur]]-[[Davachi]] plain terrane, both Absheron and [[Baku Archipelago]]. The biggest are Galmas, Toragay, Big Kanizadag etc. Most of them have a cone shape. Their height varies in the range from 20 to 400m, whereas base diameter may vary from 100 to 4500m.

In 2001, one mud volcano 15 kilometers from [[Baku]] made world headlines when it suddenly started spewing flames 15 meters high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1626310.stm BBC News | SCI/TECH | Azeri mud volcano flares&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seismicity==
The first [[Seismology|seismic station]] in Azerbaijan was established soon after 1902 in [[Baku]] by [[E. Nobel]]. Afterwards seismic stations were set in different areas in Azerbaijan ([[Balakhany]], [[Zurnabd]], [[Shamakhi]], [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]], [[Lankaran]], [[Chilov Island]], and [[Mingechevir]]).

Azerbaijan saw devastating [[earthquake]]s since the ancient times. The first reports on "an overall devastating event that destroyed all towns and villages" is dated back to 427 AD. In 1139 AD, a devastating earthquake with the magnitude of IX took place in Azerbaijan. The town of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] was destroyed completely and gross{{clarify|date=June 2014}} casualties were reported. [[Goygol (lake)|Goygol]] Lake was generated as a result of that same earthquake.

{{main|Shamakhi}}
In the AD 19th century, [[Shamahy town]] suffered several devastating earthquakes. Several of them that occurred in 1856, 1861, and 1872 and 1902 that are considered to be the strongest and most devastating were estimated to have an intensity of VII–X.

In the late [[Cretaceous]], an oceanic trench or backarc system formed in connection with a subduction zone, situated where the Isthmus of Panama is now located. Into the early [[Paleogene]], deep sea, open ocean sediments and basalt lava accumulated in the backarc. Volcanic activity was intense in the Cretaceous, [[Paleocene]] and [[Eocene]]. The volcanic arc that built up during the period overthrust onto the southern margin of North America.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

During the [[Oligocene]], the offshore Pacific Plate fragmented into the [[Cocos Plate]] and [[Nazca Plate]], divided by the east-west Colon spreading ridge. The tectonics of Costa Rica are more complicated because the Cocos Plate subdivided into two blocks separated by the Costa Rica Fracture Zone (running northeast onto land), with the northern block being subducted. Submarine canyons have been used to infer the path of the Panama Fracture Zone running along the coast creating wrench faults. On the Osa Peninsula, the Nicoya Complex preserves oceanic crust with basaltic lava, [[dolerite]], [[gabbro]], limestone, [[chert]] and [[argillite]], obducted onto land before the Oligocene and then rearranged by [[Miocene]] wrench faults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/0040-1951(88)90187-4| title=The geology, geochemistry and emplacement of the Cretaceous—Tertiary ophiolitic Nicoya Complex of the Osa Peninsula, southern Costa Rica| journal=Tectonophysics| volume=147| issue=3–4| pages=193–220| year=1988| last1=Berrangé| first1=J.P.| last2=Thorpe| first2=R.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Neogene]] the low angle subduction of the Cocos Plate led to volcanism in the now extinct Cordillera de Aguacate chain in the center of the country. The Valle Central basin formed as volcanism shifted northeastward in the [[Quaternary]]. In the [[Pleistocene]], calderas ejected huge quantities of silica-rich ash, filling the Valle Central basin, affecting the Tarcoles Gorge and generating the Orotina debris fan at the coast. Streams rearranged and flowed more toward the Pacific, downcutting existing channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(2003)031&lt;0419:LEWARV&gt;2.0.CO;2 |year=2003 |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=419 |title=Landscape evolution within a retreating volcanic arc, Costa Rica, Central America |journal=Geology |last1=Marshall |first1=Jeffrey S. |last2=Idleman |first2=Bruce D. |last3=Gardner |first3=Thomas W. |last4=Fisher |first4=Donald M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past two million years, Costa Rican volcanoes have erupted andesite, [[rhyolite]] and [[dacite]] with geochemical patterns that suggest the magma may have come from the melting of metamorphosed basalt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1144/gsjgs.149.4.0569 |title=The geochemistry of young volcanism throughout western Panama and southeastern Costa Rica: An overview |journal=Journal of the Geological Society |volume=149 |issue=4 |pages=569–579 |year=1992 |last1=Defant |first1=M.

H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine geologists have found mound-like structure offshore due to subduction related fluid venting. A lack of chlorine suggests a freshwater origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1130/G20119.1 |title=Fluid expulsion related to mud extrusion off Costa Rica—A window to the subducting slab |journal=Geology |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=201 |year=2004 |last1=Hensen |first1=C. |last2=Wallmann |first2=K. |last3=Schmidt |first3=M. |last4=Ranero |first4=C.R. |last5=Suess |first5=E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Marseille]] on 24 June 1767, the son of Jacques-Joseph Eyriès, a "lieutenant de frégates du roi" ("lieutenant of the king's frigates"), and Jeanne-Françoise Deluy (1748–1826). He moved to [[Le Havre]] in 1772 when his father was promoted to "commandant de la Marine" ("commander of the Navy"), and went to study at the [[College of Juilly]]. Eyriès began to travel to [[England]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]] to learn their languages and study [[botany]] and [[mineralogy]], and through it grew to love geography and travel. Returning to Le Havre, he began working in the armaments trade, including commercial expeditions to various parts of the world, while taking care of a [[natural history]] museum there. In 1794 he went to [[Paris]] to deliver his father, who had been detained as a suspect in the [[French First Republic|new Republic]], moving there the following year to devote himself to his studies, where he attended lectures by [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu]] and [[Georges Cuvier]], and started collecting old travel books.&lt;ref name=Coste/&gt;&lt;ref name=GDU/&gt;

He was given a mission in 1804–1805 by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord]] and [[Napoleon]] to travel to Germany and rally the French emigrants there, chosen for his knowledge of the country and language and his discretion. He used the opportunity to continue his collection, but turned down the title "conseiller d’État" ("councillor of the State") to keep his independence, allowing him to devote himself entirely to geography and botany, and return to Paris to settle. As a speaker of nine languages, he translated many articles and books from German, English and Scandinavian languages into French, mostly on travel and geography, but also including ''[[Fantasmagoriana]]'' from a selection of German ghost stories, which he published anonymously in 1812. From that year he became one of the drafters of the ''Biographie Universelle'' under editor [[Joseph François Michaud]], writing many articles for it up until his death. His quality as a translator and extensive scientific knowledge earned him the friendship and admiration of many respected scientists, notably including [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Conrad Malte-Brun]], the latter of whom he joined in 1819 to continue the publication of ''Nouvelles Annales des Voyages, de la Géographie et de l’Histoire'', a journal dedicated to the advancement of the earth sciences.&lt;ref name=Coste/&gt;&lt;ref name=GDU/&gt;

In 1821 he became one of the 217 founding members of the world's first geographical society, the [[Société de Géographie]], remaining one of the most active and on its central committee until his death; he was named honorary president, a prestigious title given to the likes of [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], Georges Cuvier, Alexander von Humboldt and [[François-René de Chateaubriand]]. He was a recognised geographer, and [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] named a mountain "Eyriès" after him near [[Humboldt Bay]] during his voyage on the ''[[French ship Astrolabe (1811)|Astrolabe]]''. He was admitted to the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]] in 1839, and was awarded the [[Legion of Honour]] in 1844.&lt;ref name=Coste/&gt;

Eyriès suffered a stroke in 1844, rendering him incapable of further work, and died on 13 June 1846 at the house of his brother Alexandre Eyriès, the mayor of Graville near Le Havre, and was buried in the cemetery of Graville priory, with an inscription on his tombstone after [[Edme François Jomard]]. He left a library of about 20,000 volumes collected throughout his life, which reflect his interest in rare and old works on travel and geography, and included almost everything written on [[Normandy]], Le Havre and [[Provence]], with rare maps from the German and Scandinavian countries, some of which are not even in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]. Many of these books, and some of his manuscripts, remain as of 2006 in the municipal library of Le Havre, and a street "Rue Jean Baptiste Eyries" was named after him in the city. Eyriès was remembered by his contemporaries for his erudition, selfless dedication, prodigious memory, critical thinking and modesty, and [[Pierre Larousse]] wrote of him: "Many people still remember seeing a little old man in antiquated clothes, wearing a wide-brimmed hat and reading along the waterfront: that was Eyriès, who worked to fill his vast memory and his rich library at the same time."&lt;ref name=Coste/&gt;&lt;ref name=GDU/&gt;

'''Landscape design software''' is used by [[landscape architect]]s, [[landscape design]]ers and [[garden designer]]s to create planting, softworks, groundworks and hardworks (see definitions below) plans before [[Construction|constructing]] a [[landscape]].

There are two levels of software available, amateur and professional. The former is usually aimed at simple visualisation of a garden design whilst the latter provides tools that allow stylistic representations of a design to be accurately labelled and dimensioned for [[General contractor|contractors]] to interpret and land authorities or local government to sight and approve or otherwise. Since the advent of the [[personal computer]], several software packages have come into existence the main professional software being CS Design Software's CS Artisan, Idea Spectrum's Realtime Landscaping Architect, LANDWorksCAD, Keysoft Solutions' KeySCAPE LandCADD, Landmark, PRO Landscape, Structure Studio's VizTerra, VisionScape's VirtualProperty Architect, Visual Impact's Earthscapes, and [http://www.lands-design.com/ Asuni's Lands Design].

Professional landscape design software requires detailed information to be output for contract documentation, which will usually constitute drawings, specifications and reports (schedules/bills of quantity). The more sophisticated landscape design software solutions automate the process of generating reports (schedules/bills of quantity) from intelligent data in the drawing; such intelligence is usually contained within labels (annotations) which include, in the case of planting, automatic calculation routines to determine the number of individual plants based on plant spacings (centres) per area or length. When labelled areas or lengths are modified (stretched or shrunk), associated labels are recalculated at the same time as reports (schedules/bills of quantity) contained in or associated with the same drawing.

Below is a list of some features provided by such software:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lands-design.com/ |title=Asuni's Lands Design|website= Asuni's Lands Design |access-date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Located in the north-west [[Amazon natural region|Colombian Amazon]], Chiribiquete National Park is the largest protected area in the country. One of the defining features of the park is the presence of [[tepuis]] (the Native American word for table-top mountains), sheer-sided sandstone plateaux that dominate the forest. Over 75,000 paintings, spanning more than 20,000 years to the present, are to be seen on the walls of the 60 rock shelters around the bases of the tepuis. Believed to be linked to the worship of the [[jaguar]], a symbol of power and fertility, these paintings depict hunting scenes, battles, dances and ceremonies. The indigenous communities, which are not directly present on the site, consider the region sacred.

|The large designs in the [[Sechura Desert|Nazca Desert]] are believed to have been created by the [[Nazca culture]] between 400 and 650 AD. They were created by scratching lines into the ground surface. Designs include animals such as a monkey and hummingbird, plants, and geographic shapes on a large scale. It is believed that they served a ritualistic purpose.

This is a '''list of countries and territories by maritime boundaries''' with other countries and territories.  The list encompasses adjacent [[ocean|maritime]] nations and territories with a special focus on the [[border|boundaries]] or [[border]]s which distinguish them.

For purposes of this list, "[[maritime boundary]]" includes boundaries that are recognized by the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], which includes boundaries of [[territorial waters]], [[contiguous zone]]s, and [[exclusive economic zones]]. However, it does not include [[lake]] or [[river]] boundaries. "Potential" maritime boundaries are included; that is, the lack of a [[treaty]] or other agreement defining the exact location of the maritime boundary does not exclude the boundary from the list.

In numbering maritime boundaries, three separate figures are included for each country and territory. The first number is the total number of distinct maritime boundaries that the country or territory shares with other countries and territories. If the country shares two or more maritime boundaries with the same country or territory and the boundaries are unconnected, the boundaries are counted separately. The second number is the total number of distinct countries or territories that the country or territory borders. In this instance, if the country or territory shares two or more maritime boundaries with the same country or territory and the boundaries are unconnected, the boundaries are only counted once. The final number is the total number of unique [[sovereign states]]&lt;ref name = sovereign&gt;The concept of [[sovereign state|state sovereignty]] is somewhat imprecise and there are disagreements about whether certain territories are sovereign. There are currently [[List of sovereign states#Internationally recognized sovereign states|195 states]] that are generally regarded as "fully" or “mostly” sovereign: this includes the [[United Nations member states|193 member states]] of the [[United Nations]] plus Vatican City and Palestine. Some of these states have under their jurisdiction [[Territory (administrative division)|territories, dependencies, or collectivities]] that are clearly non-sovereign geographical areas. These territories are generally regarded as being subsumed within the overarching sovereignty of the governing state. For example, the [[United Kingdom]] holds sovereignty over the territory of [[Gibraltar]], even though Gibraltar is not considered to be part of the United Kingdom. There are a few territories in the world that are neither clearly sovereign nor clearly subsumed under another state's sovereignty. Often, these territories have declared themselves to be sovereign, but they are either not widely recognized as such or lack some of the necessary conditions for sovereign statehood. In these cases, explanatory footnotes indicate how the territory is treated for the purposes of this list.&lt;/ref&gt; that the country or territory shares a maritime boundary with.

Footnotes are provided to provide clarity regarding the status of certain countries and territories.
States with a dagger ({{dagger}}) are [[landlocked]] states.

|'''''{{flag|Abkhazia}}'''''&lt;ref name = abkhazia&gt;In 1992, Abkhazia declared sovereignty from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Georgia disputes the declaration and considers Abkhazia to be part of its territory. The only sovereign states that recognize Abkhazia's sovereignty are [[Russia]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Nauru]]. Because of the low level of international recognition, Abkhazia is not considered a sovereign state for the purposes of this list and is not included in other countries' listings of neighbouring countries and territories.&lt;/ref&gt;

| colspan="2" | '''Fellowship and Membership of Learned Societies'''&lt;ref name="socs"&gt;There are too many [[religious institute]]s, [[learned society|learned societies]], [[Royal Academy|royal academies]], and professional institutions to be listed. One example is provided in each case; the format shown should be followed for other organisations, except that the initials of the organisation should be substituted.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fellow"&gt;Most institutions awarding Fellowships also award memberships. For example, whilst FRAeS is the highest award of the Royal Aeronautical Society, CRAeS (Companion) is an equivalent status but not also including professional qualifications, MRAeS is a professionally qualified member, and AMRAeS is an associate member — reflecting a lower level of professional qualification.  This pattern is common, but not universal and specific post-nominals can vary between societies.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are over eighty squares or ''pleins'' in [[Amsterdam]], Netherlands. This is a list of the most notable ones.

==Major squares==

===Dam Square===
[[File:Dam Amsterdam 2005.jpg|thumb|left|Dam Square]]
[[Dam Square]], also known as the Dam it is the main [[town square]] and considered to be the very center of the city. On the west edge of the square is the [[Royal Palace (Amsterdam)|Royal Palace]]. It is roughly rectangular in shape, and stretches about 200 meters from west to east and about 100 meters from north to south. It links the streets [[Damrak]] and [[Rokin]], which run along the original course of the [[Amstel]] River from Centraal Station to [[Muntplein (Amsterdam)|Muntplein]] (Mint Square) and the [[Munttoren]] (Mint Tower). The Dam also marks the endpoint of the other well-traveled streets Nieuwendijk, [[Kalverstraat]] and Damstraat. A short distance beyond the northeast corner lies the main [[red-light district]]: [[de Wallen]].

The [[National Monument (Amsterdam)|National Monument]], a white stone pillar designed by [[J.J.P. Oud]] and erected in 1956 to memorialize the victims of [[World War II]], dominates the opposite side of the square. Also overlooking the plaza are the NH Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky and the upscale [[department store]] [[De Bijenkorf]]. These various attractions have turned the Dam into a tourist zone.

===Dijkgraafplein===
[[File:Amsterdam Dijkgraafplein Terminus Tram 17 20110424.jpg|thumb|Dijkgraafplein]]
[[Dijkgraafplein]] is located in [[Amsterdam]]-[[Osdorp]] at the end of Tussen Meer in the neighborhood that is now known as 'De Sharpen'. It is named after the office of [[dijkgraaf (official)|dijkgraaf]] (the chairman of a waterboard) in 1962.

===Koningsplein===
[[File:Koningsplein1.jpg|thumb|left|Koningsplein in 2005]]
[[Koningsplein]] is located between the [[Singel (Amsterdam)|Singel]] and [[Herengracht]] canals. It has become a meeting place for the local community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denhaagwoonstad.nl/en/spots/square-koningsplein-/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120802084234/http://www.denhaagwoonstad.nl/en/spots/square-koningsplein-/ |archivedate=2012-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leidseplein===
[[File:Amsterdam, Stadsschouwburg, uitzicht op het Leidseplein03.JPG|thumb|Leidseplein]]
[[Leidseplein]] is located in the southwest of the [[Grachtengordel]] district immediately northeast of the Singelgracht canal. It is situated on the crossroads of the Weteringschans, the Marnixstraat, and the Leidsestraat. It is one of the busiest centres for nightlife in the city. Historically, the square was the end of the road from [[Leiden]], and served as a [[parking lot]] for horse-drawn traffic. Today, modern traffic travels through the square and side streets are packed with restaurants and nightclubs. The [[Stadsschouwburg (Amsterdam)|Stadsschouwburg]], a theater, is the most notable architectural landmark on the square, and the [[American Hotel, Amsterdam|American Hotel]] is close by.&lt;ref name="Dunford2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Dunford|title=The Rough Guide to The Netherlands|url=|year=2010|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-84836-882-8|pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marie Heinekenplein===
[[File:Marie_Heinekenplein.jpg|thumb|left|Marie Heinekenplein in June 2009]]
[[Marie Heinekenplein]] is popularly known as Heinekenplein. This circle-shaped square is used for various events, such as a book market and an open-air cinema. It was constructed in the early 1990s. It lies just outside the city centre, in the neighbourhood of [[De Pijp]], along the street [[Ferdinand Bolstraat]]. The street [[Quellijnstraat]] runs along the southern edge of the square. Tram lines 16 and 24 have a stop near the square.

Along the Marie Heinekenplein are a number of bars and cafés. The square is lined with café terraces. Between the square and the [[Stadhouderskade]] street is the former [[Heineken International|Heineken]] brewery, now a popular tourist attraction known as the [[Heineken Experience]]. Along the northern side of the square is a modern apartment building incorporating a supermarket and other shops at ground level. One of the three restaurants of renowned Chinese restaurant chain [[Nam Kee]] is located along the square.

===Markenplein===
[[Image:Markenlpein.jpg|thumb|Markenplein]]
Prior to 1970, [[Markenplein]] was named ''het oude Markenpleintje'' and before [[World War II]] it used to be a part of the Jewish district of Amsterdam. The name Markenplein symbolizes the bond between the new neighborhood and the old Jewish neighborhood.

The pavement pattern was designed by the American artist [[Sol LeWitt]].

The square houses the entrance of the [[Netherlands Film and Television Academy]], the parking garage Markenhoven and the Grand Cafe Allure.

===Muntplein===
[[File:Munttoren (Amsterdam).JPG|left|thumb|Muntplein]]
[[Muntplein, Amsterdam|Muntplein]], often referred to simply as the "Munt", is in fact a bridge — the widest bridge in Amsterdam — which crosses the [[Singel (Amsterdam)|Singel]] canal at the point where it flows into the [[Amstel]] river. The square is a bustling intersection of six streets. It forms the southern end of the [[Kalverstraat]] shopping street and the major street [[Rokin]]. The eastern end of the floating flower market ([[Bloemenmarkt]]) along the Singel canal is directly south of the square.

Muntplein is named after the [[Munttoren]] (or simply Munt) tower which stands on  this square.

===Museumplein===
[[File:Museumplein amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Museumplein]]
[[Museumplein]] is located in the [[Museumkwartier (Amsterdam)|Museumkwartier]] neighbourhood, beside three major museums – the [[Rijksmuseum]], [[Van Gogh Museum]], and [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam|Stedelijk Museum]] – and the concert hall [[Concertgebouw]].&lt;ref name="mdist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum District|url=http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/visiting/areas/amsterdam-neighbourhoods/centre/museum-quarter|website=iamsterdam.com|publisher=Amsterdam Marketing|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nieuwmarkt===
[[File:Overzicht - Amsterdam - 20320090 - RCE.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nieuwmarkt]] in 2002]]
[[Nieuwmarkt]] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] for "[[New Market (disambiguation)|New Market]]" is located in Amsterdam's [[Chinatown]], next to the [[De Wallen]] ([[Red-light district|Red Light District]]). It is dominated by a building known as the [[Waag (Amsterdam)|Waag]]. There are over 20 cafés and [[Cannabis coffee shops|coffeeshop]]s facing the square. There is a daily market on the square, as well as an organic food market on Saturdays and a market for antiques and books on Sundays in the summer months.

===Noordermarkt===
[[File:ArianitAmsterdam17.jpg|thumb|Noordermarkt]]
[[Noordermarkt]] is located in the [[Jordaan]] neighborhood. It is lined by cafés and restaurants. Markets are held on the square every Monday. On Saturdays, a popular organic farmer's market is held on the square. On Mondays a market (mainly for textiles) is also held in the adjacent [[Westerstraat]] street.

===Oudekerksplein===
[[File:Sex worker statue Oudekerksplein Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|The statue "Belle" on the Oudekerksplein. The plaque reads: "Respect sex workers all over the world"]]
[[Oudekerksplein]] ("Old Church's Square") marks the eastern end of the Red Light District and is wedged between the [[Warmoesstraat]] street and [[Oudezijds Voorburgwal]] canal. From the square, the Oudekerksburg bridge crosses the Oudezijds Voorburgwal canal and continues eastwards, through the Oudekennissteeg and Molensteeg alleys, towards the [[Oudezijds Achterburgwal]] and [[Zeedijk]].

Originally the Oudekerksplein was a graveyard. In 1655, the graveyard was cleared and moved to a new location beyond the city limits, creating the present square.

===Rembrandtplein===
[[File:NieuwRembrandtplein.JPG|thumb|Rembrandtplein after reconstruction 2009]]
[[Rembrandtplein]] (Rembrandt Square) is named after the famous painter [[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]] who owned a [[Rembrandt House Museum|house]] nearby from 1639 to 1656.

===Spui===
[[Image:Spui 3.jpg|thumb|left|The Spui (2008). On the right is the entrance to the [[Begijnhof, Amsterdam|Begijnhof]]]]
The [[Spui (Amsterdam)|Spui]] was originally a body of water that formed the southern limit of the city until the 1420s, when the [[Singel (Amsterdam)|Singel]] canal was dug as an outer moat around the city. In 1882 the Spui was filled in and became the square that we know today. In 1996 the square was renovated and is now largely car-free.

===Waterlooplein===
[[Image:Waterlooplein.jpg|thumb|Waterlooplein flea market]]
[[Waterlooplein]] is located near the [[Amstel]] river. The daily [[flea market]] on the square is popular with tourists. The [[Stopera]] city hall and opera building and the [[Mozes en Aäronkerk (Amsterdam)|Mozes en Aäronkerk]] church are at Waterlooplein. The area of Amsterdam that includes Waterlooplein is also called Groot Waterloo district.

'''MacGillycuddy's Reeks''' ({{lga|Na Cruacha Dubha|the black stacks}}) is a [[sandstone]] and [[siltstone]] [[mountain range]] in [[County Kerry]], [[Ireland]]. Stretching {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=off}}, from the [[Gap of Dunloe]] in the east, to [[Glencar]] in the west, the Reeks is Ireland's highest mountain range, and includes most of the highest peaks and sharpest ridges in Ireland, and the only peaks on the island that are over {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=off}} in height.

==Geology==

MacGillycuddy's Reeks are described as being composed of sandstone particles of various sizes which are collectively known as ''[[Old Red Sandstone]]''.  The rocks date from the Upper [[Devonian]] period (310–450 million years ago) when Ireland was in a hot equatorial setting.&lt;ref name="jim"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ryan | first1 = Jim | title = Carrauntoohil and MacGillycuddy's Reeks: A Walking Guide to Ireland's Highest Mountains | publisher = Collins Press | isbn = 978-1905172337 | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this 60 million year period, Ireland was the site of a major basin, known as the Munster basin, and Cork and Kerry were effectively a large alluvial floodplain.&lt;ref name="jim"/&gt;  Chemical oxidation stained the material with a purple–reddish colour (and green in places from chlorination), still visible today.&lt;ref name="jim"/&gt;  There are virtually no fossils in ''Old Red Sandstone''.&lt;ref name="jim"/&gt;  The composition of ''Old Red Sandstone'' is variable and contains quartz stones, mudstones, siltstones, and sandstone particles (boulders of conglomerate rock containing quartz pebbles are visible throughout the range).&lt;ref name="jim"/&gt;  The Reeks were also subject to significant glaciation which led to fracturing of the rock, and resulted in deep [[cirque|corries]] (e.g. the ''[[Eagle's Nest, Kerry|Eagle's Nest]]''), [[U-shaped valley]]s (e.g. Lough Coomloughra), and sharp [[arête]]s and ridges (e.g. the ''[[Beenkeragh Ridge]]'').&lt;ref name="jim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keepirelandopen.org/Reeks_Report.pdf|title=MacGillycuddy Reeks Mountain Access Development Assessment|publisher=South Kerry Development Partnership|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

MacGillycuddy's Reeks are variously described as consisting of two main sections, that contain all of its 3,000 ft peaks:&lt;ref name="dillon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jim"/&gt;

{{ordered list|type=lower-roman

| Eastern Reeks, a high ridge connecting (west to east), [[Cnoc an Chuillinn]],  [[Maolán Buí]], [[Cnoc na Péiste]], [[The Big Gun]], and [[Cruach Mhór]]; and
| Coomloughra Reeks, a horseshoe around Lough Coomloughra that connects, [[Caher (mountain)|Caher]], [[Carrauntoohil]], [[The Bones]], and [[Beenkeragh]].
}}

The Eastern Reeks meet the Coomloughea Reeks at the [[col]] of the ''Devils's Ladder'', a popular ascent route for Carrauntoohil.&lt;ref name="jim"/&gt;

MacGillycuddy's Reeks contains the three peaks in Ireland which are over {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=off}} in height, namely: [[Carrauntoohil]], Ireland's highest mountain at {{convert|1,038.6|m|abbr=on}}, followed by [[Beenkeragh]] at {{convert|1,008|m|ft|abbr=on}} and [[Caher (mountain)|Caher]] at {{convert|1,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;{{cite book| author=MountainViews (Simon Stewart)|year=2013 | title=A Guide to Ireland's Mountain Summits: The Vandeleur-Lynams &amp; the Arderins |publisher=Collins Books | isbn=978-1-84889-164-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The range contains eleven of the fourteen peaks in Ireland that are over {{convert|3000|ft|abbr=on}} in height, and meet the [[Lists of mountains in Ireland#Vandeleur-Lynams|Vandeleur-Lynam]] classification of a mountain&amp;mdash;peaks with prominence over {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="mvvl"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mountainviews.ie/lists/vandeleur-lynam/?PHPSESSID=6lpes93lcdlq890dprmqqu4dn6|title=Vandeleur-Lynams: Irish mountains of 600+m with a prominence of 15m|publisher=[[MountainViews Online Database]]|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All but one of these eleven 3,000&amp;nbsp;ft peeks, namely [[Cnoc an Chuillinn East Top]], are amongst the list of thirteen Irish [[List of Furth mountains in the British Isles|Furths]]&amp;mdash;peaks which meet the [[Scottish Mountaineering Club]]'s criteria for a Munro, and they are therefore also known as ''Irish Munros''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smc.org.uk/hills/hill-lists#furths|title=Hill Lists: Furths|quote=The list of peaks of 3000ft or more within the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland outside (furth) of Scotland. There are currently 34 Furths.|publisher=[[Scottish Mountaineering Club]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 29 peaks in the range above {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} in height.&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt; The range contains 14 Irish [[Lists of mountains and hills in the British Isles#Hewitts|Hewitts]] (height above 2,000&amp;nbsp;ft and prominence above 30 metres),&lt;ref name="dobih"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hills-database.co.uk/downloads.html|title=The Database of British and Irish Hills|date=2018|author1=Chris Cocker|author2=Graham Jackson|publisher=[[Database of British and Irish Hills]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt; and 16 Irish [[Lists of mountains in Ireland#Arderins|Arderins]] (height above 500 metres and prominence above 30 metres).&lt;ref name="mva"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mountainviews.ie/lists/arderin/|title=Arderins: Irish mountains of 500+m with a prominence of 30m|publisher=[[MountainViews Online Database]]|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The range is also known for its sharp [[arete]]s, including [[The Bones]] arete, more famously known as the ''[[Beenkeragh Ridge]]'', and [[The Big Gun]] arete.&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt;

A feature of the range is the modest [[topographic prominence]], also known as "relative height" or "drop", of many of its peaks.&lt;ref name="dobih"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dillon"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dillion  | first1 = Paddy | title = The Mountains of Ireland: A Guide to Walking the Summits | publisher = Cicerone | isbn = 978-1852841102 | year = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only two of the eleven Reeks over 3,000&amp;nbsp;ft meet the [[Lists of mountains and hills in the British Isles#Marilyns|Marilyn]] classification of a mountain (prominence above 150 metres), namely, Carrauntoohil and [[Cnoc na Péiste]].&lt;ref name="dobih"/&gt;  The only Reek that meets the [[Lists of mountains and hills in the British Isles#P600 (the "Majors")|P600]] classification (prominence above 600 metres), is Carrauntoohil itself.&lt;ref name="dobih"/&gt;  The combination of high peaks and low prominence, means the ridges between the peaks are at a sustained height (e.g. why the prominence is so modest), which has contributed to the popularity of ridge walking in the Reeks, particularly, the ''[[Coomloughra Horseshoe]]'', and the ''[[MacGillycuddy's Reeks Ridge Walk]]'', and the term, "Ireland's highest mountain range".&lt;ref name="dillon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt;

==Ownership==

The entire range is held in private ownership, both in individually owned freehold parcels in the lower reaches and in commonly owned, open upland zones (‘commonage’). A State-sponsored report into access for the range in December 2013 titled ''MacGillycuddy Reeks Mountain Access Development Assessment'' (also called the Mountain Access Project, or MAP), mapped the complex network of land titles.&lt;ref name="MAS"/&gt;  Unlike many other national mountain ranges, the MacGillycuddy's Reeks are not part of a national park or a trust structure.&lt;ref name="MAS"/&gt;

The private ownership has led to issues around the upkeep of popular paths in the Reeks, most particularly the erosion of the ''[[Carrauntoohil#Devil's Ladder|Devil's Ladder]]'' path, which is used to summit Carrauntoohil; and various car-parks and bridges used by climbers.&lt;ref name="MAS"/&gt;  The 2013 MAP report noted the importance of safety in light of the increasing climbers and walkers to the Reeks.  The MAP report stated that Kerry Mountain Rescue ("KMR") logged 17 fatalities on the Reeks between 1996 and 2000, or just over 1 fatality per annum, but since 2000, KMR had been logging approximately 2 fatalities per annum.&lt;ref name="MAS"/&gt;

==Naming==

[[File:The Eagle's Nest (Carrauntoohil, Kerry).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Looking into the deep ''[[Eagle's Nest, Kerry|Eagle's Nest]]'' [[cirque|corrie]] from the Hag's Glen.  The Nest is surrounded by [[Carrauntoohil]] (left), [[The Bones]] (back, centre), and [[Beenkeragh]] (right); Knockbrinea is at the far right.  The ''[[Hag's Tooth, Kerry|Hag's Tooth]]'' is visible at the entrance to the corrie, as is the ''[[Hag's Tooth Ridge]]'' up to the summit of Beenkeragh.]]

The name of the range is {{lga|Cruacha Dubha Mhic Giolla Mo Chuda}}, which is shortened in the Irish form to {{lga|Na Cruacha Dubha}}, meaning "The Black Stacks".&lt;ref name="paul2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mountainviews.ie/features/names/intnames2/TempanMtnNamesInter2.htm|title=Irish mountain names and their international links|author=Paul Tempan|publisher=[[MountainViews Online Database]]|date=2006|quote=Cruach - ‘stack, rick, pile’: Given the original meaning of this word, it is not surprising that most of the mountains with names in cruach show a symmetrical triangular profile, rather like a haystack. This is very evident in the case of na Cruacha Dubha (MacGillycuddy’s Reeks) or, to give them their full and rather poetic title, Cruacha Dubha Mhic Giolla Mochuda.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paul"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://mountainviews.ie/features/names/RyanReeksReview/JimRyanReeksGuide.htm|title=REVIEW: Jim Ryan - Carrauntoohil &amp; MacGillycuddy's Reeks: A Walking Guide to Ireland's Highest Mountains|author=Paul Tempan|publisher=[[MountainViews Online Database]]|date=2006|quote=However, he makes no mention here, or elsewhere in the book, of the MacGillycuddys (a branch of O'Sullivan More), the family most intimately connected with the Reeks, as well as the area to the north, and which gave its name to the range (Cruacha Dubha Mhic Giolla Mo Chuda, usually shortened to just Na Cruacha Dubha, 'the black stacks'). The MacGillycuddy was one of the few Gaelic chieftains to have his lands restored after the Cromwellian confiscations, a circumstance which helps to explain why the name has survived to this day. The MacGillycuddy family tomb is at Kilgobnet, between the mountains and Killorglin.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the English form, the name is translated as "MacGillycuddy's Reeks" (the translation used in ''Gasaitéar na hÉireann'').&lt;ref name="paul"/&gt;  The English name is sometimes incorrectly written as "The MacGillycuddy's Reeks", "MacGillycuddy Reeks", or "Macgillycuddy's Reeks".&lt;ref name="paul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="peak"/&gt;

The MacGillycuddy ({{lga|Mhic Giolla Mo Chuda}}) were a sept, or branch, of the O'Sullivan Moore clan.  The MacGillycuddy was one of the few Gaelic chieftains to have his lands restored after the Cromwellian confiscations, a circumstance which helps to explain why the name has survived to this day.&lt;ref name="paul"/&gt; The MacGillycuddy family tomb is at Kilgobnet, between the mountains and Killorglin.&lt;ref name="paul"/&gt;  The clan chief, [[McGillycuddy of the Reeks]], owned land in this part of [[Munster]] until the end of the 20th century. The word ''reek'' is a [[Hiberno-English]] version of the English word ''[[wikt:rick|rick]]'', meaning a stack.&lt;ref name="peak"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mountaineering.ie/_files/Paul%20Tempan%20Irish%20Mountain%20Placenames%20-%20Feb%202012.pdf|title=Irish Hill and Mountain Names|publisher=MountainViews.ie|author=Paul Tempan|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visitors==
Jim Ryan's 2006 book on the Reeks, ''Carrauntoohil and MacGillycuddy's Reeks: A Walking Guide to Ireland's Highest Mountains'', stated that there were 25,000 annual visitors to the Reeks.&lt;ref name="jim"/&gt;  The 2013 MAP report quoted Ryan's figures, which were cited in the MAP's ''Terms of Reference'', but stated that: "The Reeks are accessed by at least 25,000 recreational users per annum. It is highly likely that the numbers are a factor of 4 times higher based on observation of the year-round level of usage – but data is required to ascertain the visitor numbers." &lt;ref name="MAS"/&gt;

==Climbing==
[[File:Coomloughra Lough (MacGillycuddy's Reeks).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|The ''[[Coomloughra Horseshoe]]'' around the Lough Coomloughra, with [[Caher East Top]] and [[Caher West Top]] on the right, [[Carrauntoohil]] back left, and the ''[[Beenkeragh Ridge]]'' on the far left.]]

The most common reason for visiting the Reeks is to climb Ireland's highest mountain, Carrauntoohil.  The popular route starts from Cronin's Yard ({{gbm4ibx|V837873}}) and enters the Hag's Glen to climb the ''[[Carrauntoohil#Devil's Ladder|Devil's Ladder]]'' (the col between [[Carrauntoohil]] and [[Cnoc na Toinne]]), from which the summit is accessed.&lt;ref name="dillon"/&gt; A more challenging route is via the ''[[Hag's Tooth Ridge]]'' which circles the ''Eagle's Nest'', and takes in Beenkeragh, and the ''Beenkeragh Ridge''.&lt;ref name="jim"/&gt;

MacGillycuddy's Reeks is particularly regarded for the quality of its ridge walking routes,&lt;ref name="dillon"/&gt; with the 6–8 hour 15–kilometre ''[[Coomloughra Horseshoe]]'', that circles Lough Coomloughra, considered "one of Ireland’s classic ridge walks", which takes in all three of Ireland's 1,000 metre peaks, namely, Carrauntouhil, Beenkeragh, and Caher (East Top and West Top), as well as the famous ''[[Beenkeragh Ridge]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/travel/our-finest-mountain-route-1.788946|title=Our Nation's Finest Mountain Route|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|author=John O'Dwyer|date=20 June 2009|quote=There are a few candidates for this honour; Dingle’s Brandon Ridge, Connemara’s Glencoaghan Horseshoe and Mayo’s Mweelrea Circuit immediately spring to mind. But nearly all hillwalkers now agree that one route stands out above even such splendour. Kerry’s Coomloughra Horseshoe is virtually impossible to match in an Irish context, as it takes in our three highest summits and offers an adrenalin-filled crossing of a memorable mountain ridge, great long-range coastal views and a bird’s-eye panorama over some of Killarney’s renowned lakes and fells.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kmr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kerrymountainrescue.ie/carrauntoohil-route-descriptions/|title=Route Descriptions|publisher=Kerry Mountain Rescue Teams|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dillon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jim"/&gt;

{{anchor|MacGillycuddy's Reeks Ridge Walk}}The most challenging route is the full ''MacGillycuddy's Reeks Ridge Walk'', a 12–14 hour 26–kilometre traverse of the entire range.&lt;ref name="jim"/&gt;  The route normally starts at the eastern end from ''[[Kate Kearney's Cottage]]'' in the [[Gap of Dunloe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hiddenirelandtours.com/day-excursions/day-walks-and-hikes/corran-tuathail-and-the-mcgillycuddy-reeks/|title=The Ridge of the Reeks|publisher=Hidden Ireland Tours|author=Con Moriarty|date=2018|quote=Simply, the finest mountain traverse in Ireland with 7 summits over 3000 ft. From Kate Kearney’s Cottage, in the Gap of Dunloe, to Doire na Féinne and Loch a’ Chúis}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The route takes in Stickeen Mountain (440 m) and Cnoc an Bhráca (731 m) before reaching the ridge proper at [[Cruach Mhór]] (932 m).  From there it continues along the narrow arete of [[The Big Gun]] (939 m) to [[Cnoc na Péiste]] (988 m), and continuing along the chain of [[Maolán Buí]] (932 m), [[Cnoc an Chuillinn]] (958 m), [[Cnoc na Toinne]] (845 m) to the summit of [[Carrauntoohil]] (1,038 m).  From Carrauntoohil, a number of variations are possible, the main one being a detour to [[Beenkeragh]] (1,008 m) before returning along the same route to get to [[Caher (mountain)|Caher]] (1,000 m) and then on to [[Caher West Top]] (975 m) before descending to the ''Hydro-Track'' ({{gbm4ibx|V772871}}) car park near [[Lough Acoose]], Glencar. An alternative variation is to continue from Beenkeragh (1,008 m) on the northern side of the ''[[Coomloughra Horseshoe]]'' to the peaks or Skregmore (848 m) and Cnoc Íochtair (747 m) before descending to the ''Hydro-Track'' car park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.activeme.ie/guides/macgillycuddys-reeks-carrauntoohil-entire-mountain-range-walk-kerry-ireland/|title=MacGillycuddy’s Reeks and Carrauntoohil, Entire Mountain Range Walk|publisher=activeme.ie|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dillon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jim"/&gt;

MacGillycuddy's Reeks are not especially known for their rock climbing routes, unlike [[Ailladie]] in Clare or [[Fair Head]] in Antrim. The 450–metre V–Diff, ''[[Carrauntoohil#Howling Ridge|Howling Ridge]]'' up the central arete between the east and north-east faces of Carrauntoohil is notable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kerryclimbing.ie/howling-ridge/|title=Howling Ridge|publisher=KerryClimbing|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/life/travel/travel-tv/watch-the-incredible-howling-ridge-climb-on-irelands-highest-peak-36735648.html|title=Watch the incredible Howling Ridge climb on Ireland's highest peak|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]|date=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The north-east face of Carrauntoohill (e.g. the ''[[Eagle's Nest, Kerry|Eagle's Nest]]'' area), is better-known for its winter climbing, conditions permitting, offering 80 routes with 7 up to winter Grade V.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/crag.php?id=2023#guidebooks|title=Carrauntoohil Winter Climbs|publisher=UKClimbing.com|date=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.climbing.ie/index.php/Winter_Climbing_around_Carrauntoohil|title=Winter Climbing around Carrauntoohil|publisher=IrishClimbingWiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kerryclimbing.ie/rock-climbing-guides-ireland/|title=Rock and Winder Guide: Carrauntoohil|publisher=KerryClimbing.ie|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Merge to|Scotts Miracle-Gro Company |date=December 2017 }}
'''Miracle-Gro''' usually refers to a plant food brand made by [[Scotts Miracle-Gro Company]].  It is commonly used in gardens and houseplants because Miracle-Gro provides nutrients to plants that are otherwise depleted from the soil over time. This allows plants fed with Miracle-Gro to grow faster than unfertilized plants because Miracle-Gro provides readily available material for plants to use in the production of new plant cell structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/flowering-plants/question181.htm | title = What is fertilizer and why do plants need it? | publisher = howstuffworks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main components of this fertilizer is nitrogen derived from ammonium and nitrates. Miracle-Gro fertilizers come in different ratios of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Miracle-Gro for flowers has a 15-30-15 ratio, meaning that there is 15% nitrogen, 30% phosphorus, and 15% potassium by weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://njaes.rutgers.edu/horsepastures/soil_fertility.htm | title = Soil Fertility for Horse Pasture Management | publisher = New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, Rutgers University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Miracle-Gro was developed and launched by Horace Hagedorn and Otto Stern in the late 1940s.  Hagedorn created the product brand name and its distinctive package design. Horace Hagedorn died in 2006, just short of his 90th birthday. Otto Stern, the co-founder, was the uncle of noted historian Fritz Stern. In "The Five Germanys I Have Known," Fritz Stern mentions his very rich uncle Otto who had invented Miracle-Gro.

Miracle-Gro has several different fertilizer mixes which include:

All Purpose (24-8-16), Rose (18-24-16), Flowers (15-30-15), Trees &amp; Shrubs (15-10-9) and Tomato (18-18-21). Note, these values are based on water-soluble dry mix or tree spikes, not on ready to feed fertilizer values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scotts.com/smg/catalog/productCategoryLanding.jsp?navAction=jump&amp;itemId=cat50010&amp;id=cat50106 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928115811/http://www.scotts.com/smg/catalog/productCategoryLanding.jsp?navAction=jump&amp;itemId=cat50010&amp;id=cat50106 |archive-date=2008-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miracle-Gro also makes a variety of products including hose feeders, soils, and weed controls.

{{History of Saudi Arabia}}
'''Najd''' or '''Nejd''' ({{lang-ar|نجد}}, {{IPA-ar|nad͡ʒd|pron}}) is a geographical central region of [[Saudi Arabia]] that alone accounts for almost a third of the population of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.relooney.info/SI_Milken-Arabia/0-Important_14.pdf|title=Saudi Arabia Population Statistics 2011 (Arabic)|page=11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115051640/http://www.relooney.info/SI_Milken-Arabia/0-Important_14.pdf|archivedate=November 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Najd consists of modern administrative regions of [[Riyadh Region|Riyadh]], [[Al-Qassim Region|Al-Qassim]], and [[Ha'il Region|Ha'il]].

==History==
=== Pre-Islamic era ===

In pre-Islamic times the region of Najd was settled by many tribes like the [[Kindah|Kindites]], [[Tayy]] and many others.

Led by Usma bin Luai, the Tayy invaded the mountains of [[Aja mountain|Aja]] and [[Samra mountain|Samra]] from [[Banu Tamim]] in northern Arabia in their exodus from Yemen in AD 115. These mountains are now known as [[Jabal Shammar]]. The Tayy became nomadic camel herders and horse breeders in northern Najd for centuries.

In the 5th century AD, the tribes of North Arabia became a major threat to the trade line between [[Yemen]] and [[Syria]]. The [[Himyarite Kingdom|Ḥimyarites]] decided to establish a [[vassal state]] that controlled Central and North Arabia. The Kindites gained strength and numbers to play that role, and in AD 425 the Ḥimyarite king Ḥasan ibn 'Amr ibn Tubba’ made Ḥujr 'Akīl al-Murār ibn 'Amr the first King ([[Hujr|Ḥujr]]) of Kindah. The [[Kindah|Kindites]] established a kingdom in Najd in central Arabia unlike the organized states of [[Yemen]]; its kings exercised an influence over a number of associated tribes more by personal prestige than by coercive settled authority. Their first capital was Qaryat Dhāt Kāhil, today known as [[Qaryat al-Fāw]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/31568/history-of-Arabia/45976/Kindah#ref484269 History of Arabia – Kindah]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved 11 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ghassanids|Ghassānids]], [[Lakhmids]] and [[Kindah|Kindites]] were all [[Kahlani|Kahlānī]] and [[Qahtanite|Qaḥṭānī]] vassal kingdoms appointed by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Persia]]ns and Ḥimyarites to protect their borders and imperial interests from the raids of the then-rising threat of the 'Adnānī tribes. In the 5th and 6th centuries AD the Kindites made the first real concerted effort to unite all the tribes of Central Arabia through alliances, and focused on wars with the [[Lakhmids]]. Al-Ḥārith ibn 'Amr, the most famous of their kings, finally succeeded in capturing the Lakhmid capital of [[al-Ḥirah]] in southern modern day Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/318035/Kindah|title=Kindah (people)|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later however in about 529, al-Mundhir recaptured the city and put King Ḥārith and about fifty members of his family to death.

In 525, the [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumites]] invaded Ḥimyar, and this Kindites, had a knock-on effect with the Kindites who lost the support of the Ḥimyarites. Within three years the Kindite kingdom had split into four groups: Asad, Taghlib, Qays and Kinānah, each led by a prince of Kindah. These small principalities were then overthrown in the 530s and 540s in a series of uprisings of the [[Adnani|'Adnānī]] tribes of Najd and [[Hijaz|Ḥijāz]]. In 540, the [[Lakhmids]] destroyed all the Kindite settlements in [[Nejd]], forcing the majority of them to move to the [[Yemen]]. The Kindites and most of the Arab tribes switched their alliances to the [[Lakhmids]].

===Muhammad's era===
{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Muhammad}}
{{Main|List of battles of Muhammad}}
During the Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]]'s era, Muhammad carried out military expeditions in the area. The first was the [[Nejd Caravan Raid]] against the [[Quraysh]], which took place in 624. The Meccans led by Safwan ibn Umayyah, who lived on trade, left in summer for Syria for their seasonal trade business. After Muhammad received intelligence about the Caravan's route, Muhammad ordered [[Zayd ibn Haritha]] to go after the Caravan, and they successfully raided it and captured 100,000 [[dirhams]] worth of booty.&lt;ref name="stoat"&gt;Mubarakpuri, The sealed nectar: biography of the Noble Prophet, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hawarey&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawarey|first=[http://mosab.hawarey.org/ Dr. Mosab]|title=The Journey of Prophecy; Days of Peace and War (Arabic)|url=http://www.islamic-book.net/ar/Rihlat-Alnobowwah.htm|publisher=Islamic Book Trust|year=2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322002711/http://www.islamic-book.net/ar/Rihlat-Alnobowwah.htm|archivedate=March 22, 2012|df=mdy-all}}Note: Book contains a list of battles of Muhammad in Arabic, English translation available [https://www.webcitation.org/5zLhjeYyz?url=http://military.hawarey.org/military_english.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Invasion of Nejd]], happened in Rabi‘ Ath-Thani or Jumada Al-Ula, 4 AH (i.e. in October AD 625).&lt;ref name="hawarey"/&gt;

Muhammad led his fighters to Nejd to scare off some tribes he believed had suspicious intentions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{citation|title=The Sealed Nectar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ppPqzawIrIC&amp;pg=PA192| first=Saifur|last=Rahman al-Mubarakpuri|year=2005|publisher=Darussalam Publications|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars say the [[Expedition of Dhat al-Riqa]] took place in Nejd as part of this invasion.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The most authentic opinion according to "Saifur Rahman al Mubararakpuri", however, is that Dhat Ar-Riqa‘ campaign took place after the fall of Khaibar (and not as part of the Invasion of Nejd). This is supported by the fact that [[Abu Hurairah]] and Abu Musa Al-Ash‘ari witnessed the battle. Abu Hurairah embraced Islam only some days before Khaibar, and Abu Musa Al-Ash‘ari came back from Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and joined Muhammad at Khaibar. The rules relating to the prayer of fear which Muhammad observed at Dhat Ar-Riqa‘ campaign, were revealed at the [[Asfan Invasion]] and this scholars say, took place after Al-Khandaq (the [[Battle of the Trench]]).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The [[Expedition of Qatan]] also took place in Nejd. Banu Asad ibn Khuzaymah tribe (not to be confused with the [[Banu Asad]] tribe), were the residents of [[Katan, Saudi Arabia|Katan]], in the vicinity of [[Fayd]], was a powerful tribe connected with the Quraysh. They resided near the hill of Katan in [[Nejd]]. Muhammad, received intelligence reports that they were planning a raid on Medina. So he dispatched a force of 150 men under the leadership of [[Abu Salama `Abd Allah ibn `Abd al-Asad]] to make a sudden attack on this tribe.&lt;ref name="Mubarakpuri p. 349"&gt;Mubarakpuri, The sealed nectar: biography of the Noble Prophet, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ibn Sa’d, vol.ii, p. 150"&gt;Ibn Sa’d, vol.ii, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After Muhammad ===
==== [[Ridda wars]] ====
After Muhammad's death, previously dormant tensions between the Meccan [[Immigration|immigrants]], the [[Muhajirun]], and the Medinan converts, the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]], threatened to break out and split the [[Ummah]]. Other Arabic tribes also wished to revert to local leadership and split from Medina's control. In some places, people claiming prophethood started to establish leaderships to oppose Medina, e.g. [[Al-Aswad Al-Ansi]] and [[Musaylimah]]. All of which are events that led to splitting the Muslim community.&lt;ref name="Donner"&gt;Fred M. Donner, "Muhammad and the Believers: At the Origins of Islam", Harvard University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-674-05097-6}} ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qBzRj7OajmEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]''&lt;/ref&gt; The Ansar, the leaders of the tribes of Medina, met in a hall or house called [[saqifah]], to discuss whom they would support as their new leader. When Abu Bakr was informed of the meeting, he, [[Umar]], [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah]] and a few others rushed to prevent the Ansar from making a premature decision. During the meeting Umar declared that Abu Bakr should be the new leader, and declared his allegiance to Abu Bakr, followed by Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, and thus Abu Bakr became the first Muslim [[caliph]].

Apostasy and rebellion in central Arabia was led by the [[Musaylima]] in the fertile region of Yamamah. He was mainly supported by the powerful tribe of [[Banu Hanifa]]. At Buzakha in north central Arabia, another prophet, Tulaiha, a tribal chief of [[Bani Asad]], led the rebellion against Medina aided by the allied tribes of [[Banu Ghatfan]], the [[Hawazin]], and the [[Tayy]]. At Najd, [[Malik ibn Nuweira]] led the tribes of [[Banu Tamim]] against the authority of Medina.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopaedia of Islam. New Edition. Vol. 1, p. 110.Peter Hellyer, Ibrahim Al-Abed, Ibrahim Al Abed, The United Arab Emirates, A New Perspective, London, Trident Press Ltd., 2001, p. 81-84. {{ISBN|1-900724-47-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On receiving intelligence of the Muslims preparations, Tulayha too prepared for a battle, and was further reinforced by the contingents of the allied tribes.

Before launching Khalid against Tulayha, Abu Bakr sought ways and means of reducing the latter's strength, so that the battle could be fought with the maximum prospects of victory. Nothing could be done about the tribes of [[Bani Assad]] and [[Banu Ghatafan]], which stood solidly behind Tulayha, but the [[Tayy]] were not so staunch in their support of Tulayha, and their chief, [[Adi ibn Hatim]], was a devout Muslim.

Adi was appointed by Abu Bakr to negotiate with the tribal elders to withdraw their contingent from Tulayha's army. The negotiations were a success, and Adi brought with him 500 horsemen of his tribe to reinforce Khalid's army.

Khalid next marched against another apostate tribe, Jadila. Here again Adi ibn Hatim offered his services to persuade the tribe to submit without bloodshed. Bani Jadila submitted, and their 1000 warriors joined Khalid's army.

Khalid, now much stronger than when he had left Zhu Qissa, marched for Buzakha. There, in mid-September 632, he defeated Tulayha in the [[Battle of Buzakha]]. The remaining army of Tulayha retreated to Ghamra, 20 miles from Buzakha, and were defeated in the [[Battle of Ghamra]] in the third week of September.&lt;ref name="A.I. Akram, 1970"&gt;A.I. Akram, ''The Sword of Allah: Khalid bin al-Waleed, His Life and Campaigns'', Nat. Publishing. House, Rawalpindi (1970) {{ISBN|0-7101-0104-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several tribes submitted to the Caliph after Khalid's decisive victories. Moving south from Buzakha, Khalid reached [[Naqra]] in October, with an army now 6000 strong, and defeated the rebel tribe of [[Banu Saleem]] in the [[Battle of Naqra]].  In the third week of October, Khalid defeated a tribal mistress, [[Salma]], in the [[battle of Zafar]].&lt;ref name="A.I. Akram, 1970"/&gt; Afterwards he moved to Najd against the rebel tribe of [[Banu Tamim]] and their [[Sheikh]] [[Malik ibn Nuwayrah]].

At Najd, getting the news of Khalid's decisive victories against apostates in Buzakha, many clans of [[Banu Tamim]] hastened to visit Khalid, but the Banu Yarbu', a branch of Bani Tamim, under their chief, [[Malik ibn Nuwayrah]], hung back. Malik was a chief of some distinction: a warrior, noted for his generosity, and a famous poet. Bravery, generosity, and poetry were the three qualities most admired among the Arabs.

[[File:Mohammad adil rais-conquest of Arabia.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Map detailing the route of Khalid ibn Walid's conquest of Arabia.]]

At the time of [[Muhammad]], he had been appointed as a tax collector for the tribe of [[Banu Tamim]]. As soon as Malik heard of the death of Muhammad, he gave back all the tax to his tribespeople, saying, "Now you are the owner of your wealth."&lt;ref&gt;reference=al-Balazuri: book no: 1, page no:107.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he was to be charged because he signed a pact with the prophet [[Sajjah]]. This agreement stated that first they would deal with local enemy tribes together, and then they would confront the state of [[Madinah]].&lt;ref&gt;reference=al-Tabari: Vol. 2, page no: 496.&lt;/ref&gt;

His riders were stopped by Khalid's army at the town of Buttah. Khalid asked them about the signing of pact with Sajjah; they said it was just because they wanted revenge against their terrible enemies.&lt;ref&gt;reference= Tabari: Vol) p. 501-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Khalid reached Najd he found no opposing army. He sent his [[cavalry]] to nearby villages and ordered them to call the [[Azaan]] (call for prayers) to each party they meet. Zirrar bin Azwar, a squadron leader, arrested the family of Malik, claiming they did not answer the call to prayer.  Malik avoided direct contact with Khalid's army and ordered his followers to scatter, and he and his family apparently moved away across the desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Al-Tabari|915|pp=501–502}}&lt;/ref&gt; He refused to give [[zakat]], hence differentiating between prayer and zakat

Nevertheless, Malik was accused of rebellion against the state of Medina.  He was also to be charged for his entering in an anti-Caliphate alliance with the prophetess Sajjah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Al-Tabari|915|p=496}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Malik was arrested along with his clan men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Al-Tabari|915|p=502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malik was asked by Khalid about his crimes. Malik's response was "your master said this, your master said that" referring to [[Abu Bakr]]. Khalid declared Malik a rebel apostate and ordered his execution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;reference=Tabari: Vol. 2, Page no: 5)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khalid bin Walid]] killed Malik ibn Nuwayra.

[[Ikrimah ibn Abi-Jahl]], one of the corps commanders, was instructed to make contact with [[Musaylima]] at [[Yamamah]], but not to engage in fighting until Khalid joined him. Abu Bakr's intention in giving Ikrimah this mission was to tie Musaylima down at Yamamah. With Ikrimah on the horizon, Musaylima would remain in expectation of a Muslim attack, and thus not be able to leave his base. With Musaylima so committed, Khalid would be free to deal with the apostate tribes of north-central Arabia without interference from Yamamah.

Meanwhile, Abu Bakr sent Shurhabil's corps to reinforce Ikrama at Yamamah.  However, Ikrimah attacked Musaylima's forces in early September 632 and was defeated. He wrote the details of his actions to Abu Bakr, who, both pained and angered by the rashness of Ikrimah and his disobedience, ordered him to proceed with his force to [[Oman]] to assist Hudaifa; once Hudaifa had completed his task, to march to [[Mahra Sultanate|Mahra]] to help Arfaja, and thereafter go to [[Yemen]] to help Muhajir.&lt;ref name="John Glubb 1963, p. 112"&gt;John Glubb, The Great Arab Conquests, 1963, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Abu Bakr sent orders to Khalid to march against Musaylima. Shurhabil's corps, that was stationed at Yamamah, was to reinforce Khalid's corps. In addition to this Abu Bakr assembled a fresh army of [[Ansar (military)|Ansar]] and [[Muhajireen]] in Medina that joined Khalid's corps at Butah. From Butah Khalid marched to Yamamah to join with Shurhabil's corps.

Though Abu Bakr had instructed Shurhabil not to engage Musaylima's forces until the arrival of Khalid, shortly before the arrival of Khalid, Shurhabil engaged Musaylima's forces and was defeated too. Khalid joined with the corps of Shurhabil early in December 632.

The combined force of Muslims, now 13,000 strong, defeated Musaylima's army in the [[Battle of Yamama]], which was fought in the third week of December. The fortified city of Yamamah surrendered peacefully later that week.&lt;ref name="John Glubb 1963, p. 112"/&gt;

Khalid established his headquarters at Yamamah, from where he despatched columns to all over the plain of [[Aqraba (region)|Aqraba]] to subdue the region around Yamamah and to kill or capture all who resisted. Thereafter all of central Arabia submitted to Medina.

What remained of the apostasy in the less vital areas of Arabia was rooted out by the Muslims in a series of well planned campaigns within five months.

==== After Ridda wars until 10th century ====
Muhammad's followers rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia, [[Muslim conquests|conquering huge swathes of territory]] (from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in west to modern day [[Pakistan]] in east) in a matter of decades. In so doing, [[Arabia]] soon became a politically peripheral region of the [[Muslim world]] as the focus shifted to the [[Caliphate|more developed conquered lands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World |author=James E. Lindsay |year=2005 |isbn=0-313-32270-8 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 10th century to the early 20th century Mecca and Medina were under the control of a local Arab ruler known as the [[Sharif of Mecca]], but at most times the Sharif owed allegiance to the ruler of one of the major Islamic empires based in [[Baghdad]], [[Cairo]] or [[Istanbul]]. Most of the remainder of what became Saudi Arabia reverted to traditional tribal rule.&lt;ref name="Britannica history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/31568/history-of-Arabia |title=History of Arabia |work=Encyclopædia Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The changing map of Asia |author=William Gordon East |year=1971 |isbn=978-0-416-16850-1 |pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 16th-century to the Unification of Arabia ===
In the 16th century, the [[Ottomans]] added the [[Red Sea]] and [[Persian Gulf]] coast (the Hejaz, [['Asir Province|Asir]] and [[Al-Hasa|Al-Ahsa]]) to the Empire and claimed [[suzerainty]] over the interior.

In 1916, with the encouragement and support of Britain (which was fighting the Ottomans in [[World War I]]), the Sharif of Mecca, [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Hussein bin Ali]], led a [[Arab Revolt|pan-Arab revolt]] against the Ottoman Empire to create a united Arab state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of World War I |author=Spencer Tucker |author2=Priscilla Mary Roberts |year=205 |isbn=978-1-85109-420-2 |page=565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Arab Revolt of 1916 to 1918 failed in its objective, [[Allies of World War I|the Allied]] victory in World War I resulted in the end of Ottoman suzerainty and control in Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of the Arab Peoples |author=Albert Hourani |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-571-22664-1 |pages=315–319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Saud avoided involvement in the Arab Revolt, and instead continued his struggle with the Al Rashid. Following the latter's final defeat, he took the title Sultan of Nejd in 1921. With the help of the Ikhwan, the Hejaz was conquered in 1924–25 and on 10 January 1926, Ibn Saud declared himself King of the [[Hejaz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Brief History of Saudi Arabia |author=James Wynbrandt |author2=Fawaz A. Gerges |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-8160-7876-9 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, he added the title of King of Nejd. For the next five years, he administered the two parts of his dual kingdom as separate units.&lt;ref name="Britannica history"/&gt;

After the conquest of the Hejaz, the Ikhwan leadership's objective switched to expansion of the Wahhabist realm into the British protectorates of [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]], Iraq and Kuwait, and began raiding those territories. This met with Ibn Saud's opposition, as he recognized the danger of a direct conflict with the British. At the same time, the Ikhwan became disenchanted with Ibn Saud's domestic policies which appeared to favor modernization and the increase in the number of non-Muslim foreigners in the country. As a result, they turned against Ibn Saud and, after a two-year struggle, were defeated in 1930 at the [[Battle of Sabilla]], where their leaders were massacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Kingdom |author=Robert Lacey |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-09-953905-6 |pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 the two kingdoms of the Hejaz and Nejd were united as the ''Kingdom of Saudi Arabia''.&lt;ref name="Britannica history"/&gt;

[[File:Saudi Arabia - Nejd region locator.png|thumb|180px|Najd superimposed over the modern political divisions of Saudi Arabia]]
The Arabic word ''najd'' literally means "upland" and was once applied to a variety of regions within the Arabian Peninsula. However, the most famous of these was the central region of the Peninsula roughly bounded on the west by the mountains of the [[Hejaz]] and [[Yemen]] and to the east by the historical region of [[Eastern Arabia]] and the north by [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]].

Medieval Muslim geographers spent a great amount of time debating the exact boundaries between Hejaz and Najd in particular, but generally set the western boundaries of Najd to be wherever the western mountain ranges and [[lava]] beds began to slope eastwards, and set the eastern boundaries of Najd at the narrow strip of red sand dunes known as the [[Ad-Dahna Desert]], some {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} east of modern-day [[Riyadh]]. The southern border of Najd has always been set at the large sea of sand [[dune]]s known today as [[Rub' al Khali]] (the Empty Quarter), while the southwestern boundaries are marked by the valleys of Wadi Ranyah, Wadi Bisha, and Wadi Tathlith.

The northern boundaries of Najd have fluctuated greatly historically and received far less attention from the medieval geographers. In the early Islamic centuries, Najd was considered to extend as far north as the River [[Euphrates]], or more specifically, the "Walls of [[Khosrau II|Khosrau]]", constructed by the [[Sassanid Empire]] as a barrier between Arabia and [[Iraq]] immediately prior to the advent of Islam. The modern usage of the term encompasses the region of [[Al-Yamama]], which was not always considered part of Najd historically.

===Topography===
Najd, as its name suggests, is a [[plateau]] ranging from {{convert|762|to|1525|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height and sloping downwards from west to east. The eastern sections (historically better known as Al-Yamama) are marked by oasis settlements with lots of farming and trading activities, while the rest has traditionally been sparsely occupied by [[nomad]]ic Bedouins. The main topographical features include the twin mountains of Aja and Salma in the north near [[Ha'il]], the high land of Jabal Shammar and the [[Tuwaiq]] mountain range running through its center from north to south. Also important are the various dry river-beds (''[[wadi]]s'') such as [[Wadi Hanifa]] near Riyadh, Wadi Na'am in the south, Wadi Al-Rumah in the [[Al-Qassim Province]] in the north, and [[Wadi ad-Dawasir]] at the southernmost tip of Najd on the border with Najran. Most Najdi villages and settlements are located along these wadis, due to ability of these wadis to preserve precious rainwater in the arid desert climate, while others are located near [[Oasis|oases]]. Historically, Najd itself has been divided into small provinces made up of constellations of small towns, villages and settlements, with each one usually centered on one "capital". These subdivisions are still recognized by Najdis today, as each province retains its own variation of the Najdi dialect and Najdi customs. The most prominent among these provinces are Al-'Aridh, which includes Riyadh and the historical Saudi capital of [[Diriyah]]; Al-Qassim, with its capital in [[Buraidah]]; [[Sudair]], centered on [[Al Majma'ah]]; Al-Washm, centered on [[Shaqraa]]; and [[Jebel Shammar]], with its capital, Ha'il. Under modern-day [[Saudi Arabia]], however, Najd is divided into three administrative regions: [[Ha'il Province|Ha'il]], Al-Qassim, and [[Riyadh Province|Riyadh]], comprising a combined area of {{convert|554000|km2|abbr=on}}.

== Major towns ==
[[Riyadh]] is the largest city in Najd, as well as the largest city in the country as a whole, with a population of more than 5,700,000 in 2010 and 5,008,100 in 2016.Other cities include [[Buraidah]] (505,845 in 2005), [[Unaizah]] (138,351 in 2005) and [[Ar Rass]] (116,164 in 2005).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alriyadh.com/2005/12/26/article118387.html جريدة الرياض – عين على القصيم]&lt;/ref&gt;  Smaller towns and villages include [[Sudair]], [[Al-Kharj]], [[Dawadmi]], [['Afif]], [[Al-Zilfi]], [[Al Majma'ah]], [[Shaqraa]], [[Tharmada'a]], [[Dhurma]], [[Al-Gway'iyyah]], [[Al-Hareeq]], [[Hotat Bani Tamim]], [[Layla (town)|Layla]], [[As Sulayyil]], and [[Wadi ad-Dawasir]], the southernmost settlement in Najd.

== Population ==
=== Social and ethnic groups ===
Prior to the formation of the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the native population [[Arabia|Arabian tribes]], who were either nomads (''bedouins''), or sedentary farmers and merchants. The rest of the population consisted mainly of [[Arab]]s who were, for various reasons, unaffiliated with any tribes, and who mostly lived in the towns and villages of Najd working in various trades such as carpentry or as ''Sonnaa''' ([[Artisan|craftsmen]]). There was also a small segment of the population made up of African as well as some East and South Eastern European slaves or freedmen.

Most of the Najdi tribes are of [[Adnanite]] origin and emigrated from [[Tihamah]] and [[Hijaz]] to Najd in ancient times. The most famous Najdi tribes in the pre-Islamic era were [[Banu Hanifa]], who occupied the area around modern-day Riyadh, [[Banu Tamim]], who occupied areas further north, the tribe of [[Banu Abs]] who were centered in Al-Qassim, the tribe of [[Tayy]], centered on modern-day Ha'il, and the tribe of [[Banu 'Amir]] in southern Najd. In the 15th through 18th centuries, there was considerable tribal influx from the west, increasing both the nomadic and settled population of the area and providing fertile soil for the [[Wahhabi movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Uwidah Metaireek Al-Juhany, ''Najd Before the Salafi Reform Movement: Social Political and Religious Conditions During the Three Centuries Preceding the Rise of the Saudi State'' (Garnet &amp; Ithaca Press, 2002: {{ISBN|0-86372-401-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt; By the 20th century, many of the ancient tribes had morphed into new confederations or emigrated from other areas of the Middle East, and many tribes from other regions of the Peninsula had moved into Najd. However, the largest proportion of native Najdis today still belong to these ancient Najdi tribes or to their newer incarnations. Many of the Najdi tribes even in ancient times were not nomadic or bedouin but rather very well settled farmers and merchants. The royal family of Saudi Arabia, [[House of Saud|Al Saud]], for example, trace their lineage to Banu Hanifa. On the eve of the formation of Saudi Arabia, the major nomadic tribes of Najd included [[Dawasir]], [[Mutayr]], [['Utaybah]], [[Shammar]] (historically known as Tayy) [[Subay']], [[Suhool]], [[Harb tribe|Harb]], and the [[Qahtanites]] in southern Najd. In addition to those tribes, many of the sedentary population belonged to Anizzah, Banu Tamim, [[Banu Hanifa]], [[Banu Khalid]], and [[Banu Zayd]].

Most of the nomadic tribes are now settled either in cities such as Riyadh, or in special settlements, known as hijras, that were established in the early part of the 20th century as part of a country-wide policy undertaken by [[Ibn Saud|King Abdul-Aziz]] to put an end to nomadic life. Nomads still exist in the Kingdom, however, in very small numbers – a far cry from the days when they made up the majority of the people of the Arabian Peninsula.

Since the formation of modern Saudi Arabia, Najd, and particularly Riyadh, has seen an influx of immigrants from all regions of the country and from virtually every social class. The native Najdi population has also largely moved away from its native towns and villages to the capital, Riyadh. However, most of these villages still retain a small number of their native inhabitants. About a quarter of the population of Najd, including about a third of the population of Riyadh, are non-Saudi expatriates, including both skilled professionals and unskilled laborers.

Slavery was abolished in Saudi Arabia by [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]] in 1962. Some of those freed slaves chose to continue working for their former slave-owners, particularly those whose former owners were members of the royal family.

Unlike [[Hejaz]] and [[Tihamah]], Najd is remote and stayed outside of the reign of important Islamic empires such as the [[Abbasids]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. This fact largely shaped its current dissimilarity to Hejaz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riedel|first=Bruce|title=Brezhnev in the Hejaz|journal=The National Interest|year=2011|volume=115|url=http://www.relooney.info/SI_Milken-Arabia/0-Important_14.pdf|accessdate=April 23, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115051640/http://www.relooney.info/SI_Milken-Arabia/0-Important_14.pdf|archivedate=November 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
The region is known for its strict interpretation of Islam and is generally considered a bastion of religious conservatism. The founder of the strict interpretation of [[Islam]] called [[Wahhabism]] followed by the [[House of Saud]], [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] was born in [['Uyayna]], a village in the Najd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-40633687|title=Saudi Arabia investigates video of woman in miniskirt|date=2017-07-17|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language ===
The people of Najd have spoken [[Arabic language|Arabic]], in one form or another, for practically all of recorded history.  As in other regions of the Peninsula, there is a divergence between the dialect of the nomadic Bedouins and the dialect of the sedentary townspeople. The variation, however, is far less pronounced in Najd than it is elsewhere in the country, and the Najdi sedentary dialect seems to be descended from the [[Arabic dialects|Bedouin dialect]], just as most sedentary Najdis are descendants of nomadic Bedouins themselves. The [[Najdi Arabic|Najdi dialect]] is seen by some to be the least foreign-influenced of all modern Arabic dialects, due to the isolated location and harsh climate of the Najdi plateau, as well as the apparent absence of any substratum from a previous language. Indeed, not even the ancient [[Old South Arabian|South Arabian]] language appears to have been widely spoken in Najd in ancient times, unlike southern Saudi Arabia, for example. Within Najd itself, the different regions and towns have their own distinctive accents and sub-dialects. However, these have largely merged in recent times and have become heavily influenced by [[Varieties of Arabic|Arabic dialects]] from other regions and countries. This is particularly the case in Riyadh.

==Economy==
In the early 20th century, Najd produced coarse [[wool]] cloth.&lt;ref name=Prothero99&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G. W.|title=Arabia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|page=99| url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11767/view/1/99/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[Bahiyyih Nakhjavani]]’s first novel ''The Saddlebag – A Fable for Doubters and Seekers'' describes events set in the Najd plateau along the [[Hajj|pilgrim]] route between [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] in 1844–1845.

A contest held in the Middle East brought light to a new character in famed [[SNK Playmore]] videogame, ''[[The King of Fighters XIV]]''. This character goes under the name Najd.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3055">The '''Natural World Museum''' (NWM) was a mobile and global cultural institution based in [[San Francisco]] that presented art as a catalyst to inspire and engage people in environmental awareness and action. 

The Natural World Museum partnered with the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) to present art exhibitions each year for [[World Environment Day]] as part of their Art for the Environment initiative. NWM designed curatorial programs that offered new and creative perspectives on specific environmental themes such as green cities, [[desertification]], and global climate change. These exhibitions featured both emerging and established artists and were hosted by international venues such as the [[Nobel Peace Center]] in Oslo, Norway.  

NWM was an important source of commissions of new [[environmental art]]. For the 2007 World Environment Day exhibit, ''Envisioning Change: Melting Ice / A Hot Topic'', NWM commissioned [[Alfio Bonnano]] to create a site-specific outdoor nature installation entitled "Ark", depicting a boat balanced in the treetops. The piece symbolizes the [[effects of global warming]]. 

In 2007, NWM published a book entitled ''Art in Action: Nature, Creativity, and Our Collective Future'', with a foreword by [[Achim Steiner]], Executive Director of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]], and containing artworks by [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Ed Burtynsky]], Ken Rinaldo, and [[Cai Guo-Qiang]], among others. 

As part of NWM's educational outreach programs, hundreds of children and youth from all over the world participated in the Planet Art program; the program's purpose was to instill environmental awareness in the future stewards of the earth. NWM also held an ongoing lecture series and annual international symposium that bridged the worlds of art, science, and the environment, featuring guest speakers such as [[Al Gore]], [[Ernest Callenbach]], [[Hunter Lovins]], [[Joanna Macy]], [[Daryl Hannah]], and [[Wangari Maathai]], Nobel Laureate 2004.

Mia Hanak was the Founding Executive Director of NWM from 2001 to 2008.

In May 2009, NWM was officially closed and is no longer a functioning museum.

[[Image:Pedro Reinel 1504.jpg|thumb|250px|right| '''Pedro Reinel''' (c. 1504). [[Bayerische Staatsbibliothek]], [[Munich]].]]
'''Pedro Reinel''' (c. 1462 – c. 1542) was a Portuguese cartographer, author of one of the oldest signed Portuguese  [[nautical charts]] (c. 1485). That is a [[portolan]] type of chart, covering western [[Europe]] and part of [[Africa]], and already reflecting the explorations made by [[Diogo Cão]] in 1482–1485. With his son [[Jorge Reinel]] (c. 1502 – c. 1572), and the cartographer [[Lopo Homem]], he participated in the construction of the well-known [[Miller Atlas]] (1519). His Atlantic Chart of c. 1504 is the earliest known nautical chart with a scale of latitudes, and the first to depict a [[wind rose]] with a clearly drawn [[fleur-de-lys]]. He has a Portuguese postage stamp in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danstopicals.com/reinel.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
From independence in 1960 until 1999 it was divided into [[prefectures of Chad|14 ''préfectures'']]. These were replaced in 1999 by [[departments of Chad|28 ''départements'']]. The country was reorganized again in 2002 to produce 18 ''régions''.  In 2008, a further four ''régions'' were created, increasing the number to 22. Ennedi Region was split into Ennedi-Est and Ennedi-Ouest in 2012, producing the current 23 regions.&lt;ref name=statoids /&gt;&lt;ref name=ordonnance&gt;{{cite web |last=Déby |first=Idriss |author-link=Idriss Déby |url=http://sgg-tchad.org/ordonnances/ORD_70001.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521195604/http://sgg-tchad.org/ordonnances/ORD_70001.pdf |archivedate=May 21, 2016 |title=Ordonnance No. 27/PR/2012 |publisher=Republic of Chad |date=4 September 2012 |accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1885, both the Queensland and the South Australian branches started.

The '''Sea of Zanj''' ({{lang-ar|بحر زنج}}) is a former name for that portion of the western [[Indian Ocean]] adjacent to the region in the [[African Great Lakes]] referred to by [[medieval]] [[Arab]] geographers as [[Zanj]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.eshia.ir/23019/1/542 دانشنامه جهان اسلام، بنیاد دائرة المعارف اسلامی، برگرفته از مقاله «بحرالزنج»، شماره۵۴۲] Article in Islamic World Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; The Sea of Zanj was deemed a fearful zone by Arab mariners and legends regarding dangers in the waters abounded, especially near its far southern limits.&lt;ref name="masudi"&gt;[[Al-Masudi]], ''Meadows of Gold and Mines of Gems'', vol. 1, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The term was applied to the sea expanses near the eastern portion of the African continent known by ancient Muslim travelers and chroniclers such as [[Al Masudi]] and [[Ibn Batuta]].&lt;ref name="masudi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IB"&gt;[[Ibn Battuta]], ''The Travels of Ibn Battuta ''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although geographically insufficiently defined, the area of the Sea of Zanj included a vast maritime region roughly stretching as far as ancient navigators reached on their [[dhow]]s. Subject to [[Monsoon]] wind variations, the Sea of Zanj was located to the south of the [[Erythraean Sea]]. It stretched off the coast of Southeast Africa as far south as the [[Mozambique Channel]], including the [[Comoros]] and the waters off the eastern coast of [[Madagascar]]. On its eastern side the sea extended west of the [[Seychelles]] and to the northwest of the islands of the [[Mascarenes]].&lt;ref name="masudi"/&gt;

'''Servette''' is a [[district]] of the city of [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. The district's name comes from the [[Latin]] word for forest, ''silva'', and means "little forest". Its name alludes to Servette's rural past, before Geneva grew beyond its walls and incorporated the area.

The succession of power in the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) takes place in the context of a [[one-party state|single party system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Folsom|first=Ralph|title=Law and Politics in the People's Republic of China|year=1992|publisher=West Group|isbn=0-314-00999-X|pages=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the guarantee of universal franchise in the constitution, the appointment of the [[Paramount Leader]] lies largely in the hands of his predecessor and the powerful factions that control the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]].  The appointment of the leader of the world’s most populous country occurs after two five year terms in accordance with the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Constitution of the People's Republic of China |url=http://www.npc.gov.cn/zgrdw/english/constitution/constToDetail.jsp?id=full&amp;pages=0 |publisher=National People's Congress |accessdate=26 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609133734/http://www.npc.gov.cn/zgrdw/english/constitution/constToDetail.jsp?id=full&amp;pages=0 |archivedate=June 9, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of Power==
It is generally accepted that the [[Paramount leader]] of China holds these three official titles:

* [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] - Head of the Ruling party
* [[President of the People's Republic of China]] - Nominal head of state
* [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] - Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces ([[People's Liberation Army]])

In the past it was possible for the Paramount Leader to wield absolute power without holding any official office.  This was the case with [[Deng Xiaoping]] who was the undisputed leader from 1978 to 1992 without holding any official offices.  Since his retirement, power has become more structured with the leader holding all three of the previously mentioned offices.

==History==
The concept of Paramount Leader was instituted during the era of [[Mao Zedong]]. The position was further established under [[Deng Xiaoping]], however the term Paramount Leader has not been officially attributed to any other leaders. Since the retirement of Deng Xiaoping in 1992, political power in China has been held collectively by the members of the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China]]. The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] may be best described as primus inter pares, first among equals.  Because the proceedings of this body are considered a state secret, the inner workings of Politburo are not made public. It is clear, however, that decision making has become consensus driven and that no single figure can any longer act unilaterally as in the days of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In China, democracy is only in the Politburo: WikiLeaks|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/In-China-democracy-is-only-in-politburo-WikiLeaks/Article1-640278.aspx|accessdate=26 March 2011|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional Mechanism==
Constitutional power in the People's Republic of China is held by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party]] (CCCPC).  Although this group of approximately 300 members does not have power in the same way as a traditional legislative body, the most important and senior officials of the Chinese government are all members.

Within the CCCPC is the [[Politburo|Politburo of the Communist Party of China]]. This body is a group of 25 individuals (currently 23 men and two women) who govern the [[Communist Party of China]] (CCP). Theoretically, the Politburo is elected by the CCCPC; however, in practice any new member of the Politburo is chosen by the current members. Politburo members hold positions in China's national government and regional positions of power simultaneously thereby consolidating the CCP’s power.

In the case of key policy decisions, topics are addressed in the Politburo which then determines actions to be taken by the national and local government. The policy direction for the entire country rests in the hands of these 25 individuals who meet together once a month. Admission into the Politburo is extremely difficult. Tight control over the body is exercised by current members who vet potential members carefully to maintain the balance of power. Good political relationships within the Politburo are essential for admittance into the group. All members of the Politburo are elected for five year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Alice|title=The 18th Central Committee Politburo: A Quixotic, Foolhardy, Rashly Speculative, But Nonetheless Ruthlessly Reasoned Projection|journal=China Leadership Monitor|date=28 June 2010|volume=33|url=http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/CLM33AM.pdf|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Power within the Politburo is further concentrated in the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China]]. This group of seven members meets together weekly and is led by the General Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Alice|title=The 18th Central Committee Politburo: A Quixotic, Foolhardy, Rashly Speculative, But Nonetheless Ruthlessly Reasoned Projection|journal=China Leadership Monitor|date=28 June 2010|volume=33|url=http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/CLM33AM.pdf|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The election of executive leadership in the PRC is done through a process that can best be described as an indirect election. In this system, only one candidate stands for the election of any given position. Although other candidates are not allowed to formally run, write in candidates are permitted. In 2013, when the [[12th National People's Congress]] elected Xi Jinping as president, 2952 members voted in favor and one against, with three abstentions. Similarly, in the 2008 election, [[Hu Jintao]], then-General Secretary, President and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, was re-elected by a landside. Of the 2985 members of the [[11th National People's Congress]], only 3 voted against Hu Jintao with another 5 abstaining.

==Practical Mechanism==
In practical terms, the [[National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China|National Congress]] provides a rubber stamp on a decision that is made by the Politburo and the Standing Committee. The transition of leadership can take several months. For instance, when Hu Jintao took over power from [[Jiang Zemin]], the transition of power stretched out almost 2 years. Listed below are the dates on which Hu was appointed to each office.
*General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (November 2002)
*President of the People's Republic of China (March 2003)
*Chairman of the Central Military Commission (September 2004)
Usually the office of [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] is the last office handed over by the previous leader, in order to secure political influence and ensure political continuity.

==Most Recent Transition==
Appointments to key offices are the best predictor of who the next leader will be.  The office of Vice Chairman of the [[Central Military Commission]] (CMC) is seen by many as the last stop before becoming the leader of China. Appointment to this position is so crucial that when [[Xi Jinping]], the current General Secretary failed to achieve this office at the 4th Plenum in 2009, many analysts suggested that he had fallen from favor and would not be the next leader of the PRC.  His ultimate appointment to Vice Chairman of the CMC was seen as evidence that he had begun to consolidate his power and would ultimately succeed Hu Jintao when his term expired in 2012 at the 18th party congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mulvenon|first=James|title=Xi Jinping and the Central Military Commission: Bridesmaid or Bride?|journal=China Leadership Monitor|date=22 February 2011|volume=34|url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/china-leadership-monitor/article/67976|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Absent a transparent electoral process, the appointment to key positions is the only way to predict future leadership in the PRC. Note in the table below, the path that Xi Jinping followed from a low level party official at the age of 30 to his current position of the leader of the largest country in the world.

As long as the Chinese government remains secretive about the inner workings of the Politburo, past behavior will continue to be the most effective tool for predicting future appointments. In this context, the appointment of a candidate to key offices is still the best indicator of their future role. For example, the appointment of Xi Jinping as the vice chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China signposted with a reasonable amount of confidence that he would be the next leader of the People's Republic of China.

Universalism, in [[human geography]], signals the position that ideas of development produced in Western social sciences hold for all times and places.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, T. (2000) Universalism, in R. Johnston, D. Gregory, G. Pratt and M. Wats(eds), “The Dictionary of Human Geography". Oxford: Blackwell, 869-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Universalist thinking began in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] when philosophers decided on "truths" that could explain occurrences rationally and accurately. [[Development geography]], human geography and other disciplines seek to find and critique universal "truths". Critics suggest that Universalism has created a world knowledge hierarchy placing Western Europe, North America and the rest of the "developed" world at the top, as the centre of knowledge, and placing the rest of the globe below, as ignorant and needing to be educated. The hierarchy reiterates the [[core-periphery]] notion, examining it in terms of knowledge differentials across space.

==Origins==
As intellectuals began to question traditional understandings of the world and think on a global scale, new "truths" were created to help explain the world as placeless, free of cultural specificity, abstract and apolitical.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, V.L., "Making Development Geography". London: Hodder Arnold&lt;/ref&gt;   They began to manifest themselves in development policies, political apparatuses, and other institutions. In the late 19th and 20th century, [[Émile Durkheim]] wrote that "the truths of [modern] science are independent of any local context", echoing the Enlightenment's philosophies and assuming an isotropic globe, thus allowing homogeneity to overtake difference.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim E., "Selected Writings".Cambridge: University Press&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of security and superiority was wielded as the world was now understood, which allowed for the continued teaching of and reliance upon universal "truths".
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One can see how saying that all knowledge is geographically located is widely taken as a way of saying that the knowledge in question is not authentically true at all.&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, T.  ''The View From Nowhere''. Oxford: University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Global diffusion==
As universal "truth" claims gained acceptance among Western intellectuals, they began an important transition into the school system.  [[Michel Foucault]] describes the 17th- and-18th century school systems as being important because of highly complex systems of conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault Michel, "Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972-1977". New York: Pantheon Books, 125.&lt;/ref&gt; As "truth" claims were taught to children, they became embedded within societal and political apparatuses. Once cemented within such institutions, they were able to flourish and remain.

Through the imperialist expansion by the west and the successive [[colonisation]] around the globe, supposed universal "truths" began to diffuse across borders, space and place.  Once colonies were set up and dominant hegemons were in place the processes of the west began to be the processes of the world and the necessary steps to [[modernisation]].

==Changing truths==
The realization that the truths may not be universal across different spaces was an important factor in the 1970s, when questions arose of nationally varying styles of science. By the mid-1980s, geographical sensibility towards science increased, seeking to show that locality and spatial situation needed to be remembered to understand how scientific knowledge was made, became credible and flowed globally.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin, S. ''Placing the View from Nowhere: Historical and Sociological Problems in the Location of Science''. Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; It has been with that new situational approach to knowledge formation that allowed geographers to begin analyses of [[epistemology]] with relation to place and confront "truth" formation with a more culturally ecological ([[cultural ecology]]) approach.

==Foucaulta  truths==
Important to universalism in geography is understanding how knowledge becomes accepted as truth. Foucault discusses truth in terms of "societal regimes of truth" and explains that truths are made up by societies by selecting "the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true" and creating and controlling "the mechanisms that enable us to distinguish between true and false statements".&lt;ref&gt;Foucault Michel, "Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972-1977". New York: Pantheon Books, 131&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on about the relationship between truth and systems of power and how they produce and maintain such regimes of truth.

In [[astronomy]], [[geography]], and related sciences and contexts, a ''[[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]]'' or ''[[plane (geometry)|plane]]'' passing by a given point is said to be '''vertical''' if it contains the local [[gravity direction]] at that point.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last1 = Hofmann-Wellenhof |first1 = B.
|last2 = Moritz |first2 = H.
|title = Physical Geodesy

|year = 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, a direction or plane is said to be '''horizontal''' if it is perpendicular to the vertical direction.

The usage of the inter-related terms '''horizontal''' and '''vertical''' as well as their symmetries and asymmetries vary with context (e.g. two vs. three dimensions).
In general, something that is vertical can be drawn from up to down (or down to up), such as the y-axis in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].

==Historical definition==
[[Girard Desargues]] defined the vertical to be [[horizon#Projective geometry|perpendicular to the horizon]] in his ''Perspective'' of 1636.

The word "horizontal" is derived from "[[horizon]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|horizontal}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas "vertical" originates in the late [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|verticalis}}'', which is from the same root as ''[[Vertex (disambiguation)|vertex]]'' 'highest point'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|vertical}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geophysical definition==

===The plumb line and spirit level===
[[File:Bubble on a marble shelf.PNG|thumb|Spirit level bubble on a marble shelf tests for horizontality]]
In physics, in engineering, and in construction, the direction designated as vertical is usually that along which a [[plumb-bob]] hangs. Alternatively, a [[spirit level]] that exploits the buoyancy of an air bubble and its tendency to go vertically upwards may be used to test for horizontality. Modern rotary laser levels that can level themselves automatically are robust sophisticated instruments and work on the same fundamental principle.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.laser-level.co.uk/products/stabila-rotary-lasers/stabila-lar200.html Laser Levels]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For how a spirit level works, see http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=562730&lt;/ref&gt;

===The flat earth approximation===
In the flat earth scenario,&lt;ref&gt;See ''Theory and Problems of Theoretical Mechanics" by Murray R Spiegel, 1987, pg 62&lt;/ref&gt; where the earth is notionally a large (infinite) flat surface with gravitational field at a right angle to the surface, the earth surface is horizontal and any plane parallel to the earth surface is also horizontal.  Vertical planes, e.g., walls, may be parallel to each other or they may intersect at a vertical line. Horizontal surfaces do not intersect. Furthermore, a  plane cannot both be a horizontal plane at one place and a vertical plane somewhere else.

===The spherical Earth===
[[File:Vertical wall are never parallel.PNG|thumb|Strictly, vertical walls are never parallel on the surface of a spherical planet]]
When the curvature of the earth is taken into account, the concepts of vertical and horizontal take on yet another meaning. On the surface of a smoothly spherical, homogenous, non-rotating planet, the plumb bob picks out as vertical the radial direction. Strictly speaking, it is now no longer possible for vertical walls to be parallel: ''all'' verticals intersect. This fact has real practical applications in construction and civil engineering, e.g., the tops of the towers of a suspension bridge are further apart than at the bottom. 
&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia.com. In very long bridges, it may be necessary to take the earth's curvature into account when designing the towers. For example, in the New York's Verrazano Narrows Bridge, the towers, which are 700 ft (215 m) tall and stand 4260 ft (298 m) apart, are about 1.75 in (4.5 cm) farther apart at the top than they are at the bottom.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Horizontal planes can intersect.PNG|thumbnail|On a spherical planet, horizontal planes intersect. In the example shown, the blue line represents the tangent plane at the North pole, the red the tangent plane at an equatorial point. The two intersect at a right angle.]]
Also, horizontal planes can intersect when they are [[tangent]] planes to separated points on the surface of the earth. In particular, a plane tangent to a point on the equator intersects the plane tangent to the [[North Pole]] at a [[right angle]]. (See diagram).
Furthermore, the [[equator]]ial plane is parallel to the tangent plane at the North Pole and as such has claim to be a horizontal plane. But it is. at the same time, a vertical plane for points on the equator. In this sense, a plane can, arguably, be ''both'' horizontal and vertical, horizontal ''at one place'', and vertical ''at another''.

=== Further complications===
{{Main Article|Vertical deflection}}
For a spinning earth, the plumb line deviates from the radial direction as a function of latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://faculty.trinityvalleyschool.org/hoseltom/handouts/Chap%2014-Ax-Plumb-bob%20Deviation%20w%20Latitude-34PbyE.pdf|title= Working in the Rotating Reference Frame of the Earth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only at the North and South Poles does the plumb line align with the local radius. The situation is actually even more complicated because earth is not a [[homogeneous]] smooth sphere. It is a non homogeneous, non spherical, knobby planet in motion, and the vertical not only need not lie along a radial, it may even be curved and be varying with time. On a smaller scale, a mountain to one side may deflect the plumb bob away from the true [[zenith]].&lt;ref&gt;Such a deflection was measured by [[Nevil Maskelyne]]. See Maskelyne, N. (1775). "An Account of Observations Made on the Mountain Schiehallion for Finding Its Attraction". Phil. Trans. Royal Soc. 65 (0): 500–542. doi:10.1098/rstl.1775.0050. [[Charles Hutton]] used the observed value to determine the density of the earth.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a larger scale the gravitational field of the earth, which is at least approximately radial near the earth, is not radial when it is affected by the moon at higher altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Chappell, Azhar Iqbal, Derek Abbott for an example of curved gravitational field. arXiv:1206.3857 [physics.class-ph] (or arXiv:1206.3857v1 [physics.class-ph] for this version)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walls and floors ===
[[File:Brick wall close-up view.jpg|thumb|Brick wall showing horizontal mortar courses and vertical perpendiculars. By contrast, a level floor only contains horizontal lines.]] 
On a (horizontal) floor, one can draw a horizontal line but not a vertical line in the sense of a plumb bob line. But on a (vertical) wall, one can draw both vertical ''and'' horizontal lines. In this sense, a vertical wall allows more options. This is reflected in the tools a bricklayer uses: a plumb line for verticality and a spirit level to check that the mortar courses are horizontal.
On the other hand, in contrast to a wall a horizontal floor allows more options when one considers compass directions. One can draw on a floor lines going north, south, east, and west, in fact, along any compass direction. A wall allows fewer options. For instance, on a wall which runs along a longitude, an insect cannot crawl east.

=== Independence of horizontal and vertical motions ===
Neglecting the curvature of the earth, horizontal and vertical motions of a projectile moving under gravity are independent of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Salters Hornerns Advanced Physics Project, As Student Book, Edexcel Pearson, London,  2008, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical displacement of a projectile is not affected by the horizontal component of the launch velocity, and, conversely, the horizontal displacement is unaffected by the vertical component.  The notion dates at least as far back as Galileo.&lt;ref&gt;See Galileo's discussion of how bodies rise and fall under gravity on a moving ship in his ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems''(trans. S. Drake). University of California Press, Berkeley, 1967, pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the curvature of the earth is taken into account, the independence of the two motion does ''not'' hold. For example, even a projectile fired in a horizontal direction (i.e., with a zero vertical component) may leave the surface of the spherical earth and indeed escape altogether.&lt;ref&gt;See Harris Benson ''University Physics'', New York 1991, page 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical definition==

===In two dimensions===
[[File:Vertical horizontal.PNG|thumb|In two dimensions. 1. The vertical direction is designated. 2. The horizontal is normal to the vertical. Through any point P, there is exactly one vertical and exactly one horizontal. Alternatively, one can start by designating the horizontal direction.]]

In the context of a two-dimensional orthogonal [[Cartesian coordinate system]] on  a Euclidean plane, to say that a line is horizontal or vertical, an initial designation has to be made. One can start off by designating the vertical direction, usually labelled  the Y direction.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of identification of the ''y''-axis with the vertical, and the ''x''-axis with the horizontal, see G.S.Rehill's ''Interactive Maths Series, "Building a Strong foundation in Mathematics"'', accessible on http://www.mathsteacher.com.au/year8/ch15_graphs/05_hor/ver.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; The horizontal direction, usually labelled the X direction,&lt;ref&gt;For a definition of "Horizontal axis" see Math Dictionary at http://www.icoachmath.com/math_dictionary/Horizontal_Axis.html&lt;/ref&gt; is then automatically determined. Or, one can do it the other way around, i.e., nominate the ''x''-axis, in which case the ''y''-axis is then automatically determined. There is no special reason to choose the horizontal over the vertical as the initial designation: the two directions are on par in this respect.

The following hold in the two-dimensional case:
# Through any point P in the plane, there is one and only one ''vertical line'' within the plane and one and only one ''horizontal line'' within the plane. This symmetry breaks down as one moves to the three-dimensional case.
# A  ''vertical line'' is any line parallel to the vertical direction. A ''horizontal line'' is any line normal to a vertical line.
# Horizontal lines do not cross each other.
#Vertical lines do not cross each other.

Not all of these elementary geometric facts are true in the 3-D context.

===In three dimensions===
In the three-dimensional case, the situation is more complicated as now one has horizontal and vertical planes in addition to horizontal and vertical lines. Consider a point P and designate a direction through P as vertical. A plane which contains P and is normal to the designated direction is the ''[[horizontal plane]]'' at P. Any plane going through P, normal to the horizontal plane is a  ''[[vertical plane]]'' at P. Through any point P, there is one and only one horizontal plane but a ''multiplicity'' of vertical planes. This is a new feature that emerges in three dimensions. The symmetry that exists in the two-dimensional case no longer holds.

=== In the classroom===
[[File:Mystery of the horizontal y-axis.PNG|thumb|The ''y''-axis on the wall is vertical but the one on the table is horizontal]]
In the 2-dimension case, as mentioned already, the usual designation of the vertical coincides with the [[y-axis]] in co-ordinate geometry. This convention can cause confusion in the classroom. For the teacher, writing perhaps on a white board, the ''y''-axis really is  vertical in the sense of the plumbline verticality but for the student the axis may well lie on a horizontal table.

Although the word horizontal is commonly used in daily life and language (see below), it is subject to many misconceptions.

* The concept of horizontality only makes sense in the context of a clearly measurable gravity field, i.e., in the 'neighborhood' of a planet, star, etc. When the gravity field becomes very weak (the masses are too small or too distant from the point of interest), the notion of being horizontal loses its meaning.
[[File:Verticals at separate points.PNG|thumb|Verticals at two separate points are not parallel. The same holds for their associated horizontal planes]]
* A plane is horizontal only at the chosen point. Horizontal planes at two separate points are not parallel, they intersect.
* In general, a horizontal plane will only be perpendicular to a [[vertical direction]] if both are specifically defined with respect to the same point: a direction is only vertical at the point of reference. Thus both horizontality and verticality are strictly speaking local concepts, and it is always necessary to state to which location the direction or the plane refers to. Note that (1) the same restriction applies to the straight lines contained within the plane: they are horizontal only at the point of reference, and (2) those straight lines contained in the plane but not passing by the reference point are not necessarily horizontal anywhere.
[[File:Gravitational field due to knobbly planet.PNG|thumb|field lines for a non homogeneous knobbly planet in motion may be curved. The white, red and hlue bits illustrate the planet's heterogeneity.]]
* In reality, the gravity field of a heterogeneous planet such as [[Earth]] is deformed due to the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of materials with different [[density|densities]]. Actual horizontal planes are thus not even parallel even if their reference points are along the same vertical line, since a vertical line is slightly curved.
* At any given location, the total gravitational force is not quite constant over [[time]], because the objects that generate the gravity are moving. For instance, on Earth the horizontal plane at a given point (as determined by a pair of [[spirit level]]s) changes with the position of the Moon (air, sea and land [[tide]]s).
* On a rotating planet such as Earth, the strictly gravitational pull of the planet (and other celestial objects such as the Moon, the [[Sun]], etc.) is different from the apparent net force (e.g., on a free-falling object) that can be measured in the laboratory or in the field. This difference is the [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] associated with the planet's rotation. This is a [[fictitious force]]: it only arises when calculations or experiments are conducted in [[Inertial frame of reference|non-inertial frames of reference]], such as the surface of the Earth.

In general, something that is horizontal can be drawn from left to right (or right to left), such as the x-axis in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Practical use in daily life===

The concept of a horizontal plane is thus anything but simple, although, in practice, most of these effects and variations are rather small: they are measurable and can be predicted with great accuracy, but they may not greatly affect our daily life.

This dichotomy between the apparent simplicity of a concept and an actual complexity of defining (and measuring) it in scientific terms arises from the fact that the typical linear scales and dimensions of relevance in daily life are 3 [[orders of magnitude]] (or more) smaller than the size of the Earth. Hence, the world appears to be flat locally, and horizontal planes in nearby locations appear to be parallel. Such statements are nevertheless approximations; whether they are acceptable in any particular context or application depends on the applicable requirements, in particular in terms of accuracy.
[[File:Mystery of the horizontal y-axis.PNG|thumb|The y-axis on the wall is vertical but the one on the table is horizontal.]]
In graphical contexts, such as [[Technical drawing|drawing and drafting]] and Co-ordinate geometry on rectangular paper, it is very common to associate one of the dimensions of the paper with a horizontal, even though the entire sheet of paper is standing on a flat horizontal (or slanted) table. In this case, the horizontal direction is typically from the left side of the paper to the right side. This is purely conventional (although it is somehow 'natural' when drawing a natural scene as it is seen in reality), and may lead to misunderstandings or misconceptions, especially in an educational context.
