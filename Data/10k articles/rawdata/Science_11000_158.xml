'''A-not-B error''' (also known as "stage 4 error" or "perseverative error") is a phenomenon uncovered by the work of [[Jean Piaget]] in his [[theory of cognitive development]] of children. The A-not-B error is a particular error made by infants during substage 4 of their [[sensorimotor stage]]. 

A typical A-not-B task goes like this: An experimenter hides an attractive toy under box "A" within the baby's reach. The baby searches for the toy, looks under box "A", and finds the toy. This activity is usually repeated several times (always with the researcher hiding the toy under box "A"). Then, in the critical trial, the experimenter moves the toy under box "B", also within easy reach of the baby. Babies of 10 months or younger typically make the [[perseveration]] error, meaning they look under box "A" even though they saw the researcher move the toy under box "B", and box "B" is just as easy to reach. This demonstrates a lack of, or incomplete, [[schema (psychology)|schema]] of [[object permanence]]. Children of 12 months or older typically do not make this error.

==Competing explanations==
Traditionally, this phenomenon has been explained as the child seeing an image and remembering where it was, rather than where it is. Other accounts deal with the development of planning, reaching, and deciding things. There are also [[behaviorist]] accounts that explain the behavior in terms of reinforcement. This account argues that the repeated trials with hiding the toy in box "A" is reinforcing that specific behavior, so that the child still reaches for box "A" because the action has been reinforced before. However, this account does not explain the shift in behavior that occurs around 12 months.

Smith and Thelen&lt;ref name=ST&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00156-6|pmid=12907229|title=Development as a dynamic system|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=7|issue=8|pages=343–348|year=2003|last1=Smith|first1=Linda B.|last2=Thelen|first2=Esther}}&lt;/ref&gt; used a [[Cognitive model#Cognitive development| dynamic systems]] approach to the A-not-B task. They found that various components of the activity (strength of memory trace, salience of targets, waiting time, stance) combine in the "B"-trial (where the object is hidden in the "B" location rather than "A") so the child either correctly or incorrectly searches for the toy. They experimentally manipulated the task to see if they could make 10-month-old babies (who typically make the perseverative error of searching at "A") perform like 12-month-old babies (who typically search correctly). Changing the stance of the baby (sitting or standing) was one manipulation they found could make the 10-month-old search correctly. Just standing instead of sitting for the "B"-trial made the prior experience of searching in location "A" less salient to the child, who then searched correctly. The researchers concluded that the length of wait time was one of the crucial elements of the task that is influenced by age.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4412">'''Aceramic''' is defined as "not producing pottery". In [[archaeology]], the term means "without [[pottery]]".

Aceramic societies usually used bark, basketry, gourds and leather for containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.archaeologywordsmith.com/lookup.php?terms=aceramic|title = Archaeology Wordsmith|website = www.archaeologywordsmith.com|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes used to refer to a specific early [[Neolithic]] period before a culture develops [[Pottery|ceramics]], such as the Middle Eastern [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]], in which case it is a synonym of '''preceramic''' (or '''pre-pottery''').

It should be distinguished from the specific term '''Pre-Ceramic''', which is a period in many chronologies of the [[archaeology of the Americas]], typically showing some [[agriculture]] and developed [[textile]]s but no fired [[pottery]].  For example, in the [[Norte Chico civilization]] and other cultures of [[Peru]], the cultivation of [[cotton]] seems to have been very important in economic and power relations, from around 3200 BC. Here, [[Cotton Pre-Ceramic]] may be used as a period. The "Pre-Ceramic" may be followed by "Ceramic" periods or a [[formative stage]].&lt;ref&gt;Stone-Miller, Rebecca, ''Art of the Andes'', pp. 7, 18-23, 2002 (2nd edn), Thames &amp; Hudson, World of Art series, {{ISBN|0500203636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Aceramic" is also used to describe a culture at any time prior to its development of pottery as well as cultures that lack pottery altogether. A '''preceramic''' period is traditionally regarded as occurring in the early stage of the [[Neolithic]] period of a culture, but recent findings in Japan and China have pushed the origin of ceramic technology there well back into the [[Paleolithic]] era.

The Aceramic Neolithic period began roughly around 8500 BC and can be identified with over a half a dozen sites. The period was most prominent in Western Asia in an economy based on the cultivation of crops or the rearing of animals or both. Aceramic Neolithic groups are more rare outside Western Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.archaeologywordsmith.com/lookup.php?terms=aceramic|title = Archaeology Wordsmith|website = www.archaeologywordsmith.com|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aceramic Neolithic villages had many attributes of agricultural communities: large settlement size, substantial architecture, long settlement duration, intensive harvesting of seeds with sickles, equipment and facilities for storing and grinding seeds, and containers. Morphological evidence for domestication of plants comes only from Middle PPNB ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]]), and by Late PPNB some animals, notably goats, were domesticated or at least managed in most of the sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-0023-0_1|title = Aceramic Neolithic|last = Banning|first = Edward|date = 2002-01-01|publisher = Springer US|isbn = 9781468471359|editor-last = Peregrine|editor-first = Peter N.|pages = 1–20|language = en|doi = 10.1007/978-1-4615-0023-0_1|editor-last2 = Ember|editor-first2 = Melvin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sites ==
Some of the most famous Aceramic sites are located in the [[Republic of Cyprus]]. There was an Early Aceramic Neolithic phase beginning around 8200 BC. The phase can be best thought of as a "colony", or initial settlement of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.brynmawr.edu/collections/nehinterns/cypriote/akrotiri-neolithic.html|title = Untitled Document|website = www.brynmawr.edu|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the relatively recent discoveries of the Akrotiri and the Early Aceramic Neolithic phases, the Aceramic Neolithic culture known as the Khirokitia culture was thought to be the earliest human settlement on Cyprus, from 7000 to 5000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.brynmawr.edu/collections/nehinterns/cypriote/aceramicneolithic.html|title = Untitled Document|website = www.brynmawr.edu|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of Late Aceramic Neolithic sites throughout the island. The two most important are called Khirokitia and Kalavasos-Tenta. Late Aceramic Cyprus did not have much external contact because of a lack of settlement in the west or northwest during the period. However, Late Aceramic Cyprus was a well-structured society.

'''Arnold Orville Beckman''' (April 10, 1900 – May 18, 2004) was an American  chemist, inventor, investor, and philanthropist. While a professor at [[California Institute of Technology]], he founded [[Beckman Instruments]] based on his 1934 invention of the [[pH meter]], a device for measuring acidity, later considered to have "revolutionized the study of chemistry and biology".&lt;ref name="Gallwas"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ac041608j | title = People: Arnold Orville Beckman (1900–2004) | year = 2004 | last1 = Gallwas | first1 = Jerry | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 76 | pages = 264 A | issue = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also developed the [[DU spectrophotometer]], "probably the most important instrument ever developed towards the advancement of bioscience".&lt;ref name=Simoni /&gt; Beckman funded the first  [[transistor]] company, thus giving rise to [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref name="hundred"&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-941901-23-9 |author1=Arnold Thackray  |author2=Minor Myers, Jr.  |lastauthoramp=yes |others = foreword by James D.

==Early life==
[[File:Steele chemistry 1873 page 27.jpg|thumb|140px|right|''Fourteen Weeks in Chemistry'', page 27.]]
Arnold Orville Beckman was born in [[Cullom, Illinois]], a village of about 500 people in a farming community.  He was the youngest son of George Beckman, a blacksmith, and his second wife Elizabeth Ellen Jewkes.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|5}} He was curious about the world from an early age. When he was nine, Beckman found an old chemistry textbook, [[Joel Dorman Steele]]'s ''Fourteen Weeks in Chemistry'', and began trying out the experiments.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|9}} His father encouraged his scientific interests by letting him convert a toolshed into a laboratory.

Beckman's mother, Elizabeth, died of diabetes in 1912.  Beckman's father sold his blacksmith shop, and became a travelling salesman for blacksmithing tools and materials.  A housekeeper, Hattie Lange, was engaged to look after the Beckman children.  Arnold Beckman earned money as a "practice pianist" with a local band, and as an "official cream tester" running a centrifuge for a local store.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|12–13}}

In 1914, the Beckman family moved to Normal, located just north of [[Bloomington, Illinois]], so that the young Beckmans could attend [[University High School (Normal)|University High School]] in [[Normal, Illinois|Normal]], a "laboratory school" associated with [[Illinois State University]].&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|16}} In 1915 they moved to Bloomington itself,&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|17–18}} but continued to attend University High, where Arnold Beckman obtained permission to take university level classes from professor of chemistry Howard W. Adams.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|17–18}}  While still in high school, Arnold started his own business, "Bloomington Research Laboratories", doing analytic chemistry for the local gas company.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|21–22}} He also performed at night as a movie-house pianist, and played with local dance bands.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|24–25}} He graduated valedictorian of his class, with an average of 89.41 over four years, the highest attained.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|27}}

Beckman was allowed to leave school a few months early to contribute to the [[First World War]] effort in early 1918 by working as a chemist.  At [[Keystone Steel and Iron]] he took samples of molten iron and tested them to see if the chemical composition of carbon, sulfur, manganese and phosphorus was suitable for pouring steel.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|26}}

When Beckman turned 18 in August 1918, he enlisted in the [[United States Marines]]. After three months at marine boot camp on [[Parris Island, South Carolina]],&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|31}} he was sent to the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], for transit to the war in Europe. Because of a train delay, another unit embarked in place of Beckman's unit. Then, counted into groups in the barracks, Beckman missed being sent to [[Russia]] by one space in line.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|32}} Instead, Arnold spent [[Thanksgiving]] at the local [[YMCA]], where he met 17-year-old Mabel Stone Meinzer, who was helping to serve the meal.  Mabel would become his wife.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|33}}  A few days later, the [[First Armistice at Compiègne|armistice]] was signed, ending the war.

==University education==

Arnold Beckman attended the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] beginning in the fall of 1918. During his freshman year, he worked with [[Carl Shipp Marvel]] on the synthesis of organic mercury compounds, but both men became ill from exposure to toxic [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|42}} As a result, Beckman changed his major from organic chemistry to physical chemistry, where he worked with Worth Rodebush, T. A. White, and Gerhard Dietrichson.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|50–51}}  He earned his [[bachelor's]] degree in chemical engineering in 1922 and his master's degree in physical chemistry in 1923.&lt;ref name=OralHistory&gt;{{cite book|first1= Jeffrey L. |last1=Sturchio|first2= Arnold |last2=Thackray|title=Arnold O. Beckman, Transcript of an Interview Conducted by Jeffrey L. Sturchio and Arnold Thackray at the University of Pennsylvania on 23 April 1985 (0014A) |date=23 April 1985 |url=https://oh.sciencehistory.org/sites/default/files/beckman_ao_0014a_suppl.pdf|place=Philadelphia, PA|publisher=[[Science History Institute|Center for History of Chemistry]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For his master's degree he studied the thermodynamics of aqueous ammonia solutions, a subject introduced to him by T. A. White.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|55}}

Soon after arriving at the University of Illinois, Beckman joined the [[Delta Upsilon]] Fraternity.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|55}}  He was initiated into Zeta Chapter of [[Alpha Chi Sigma]], the chemistry fraternity, in 1921&lt;ref name=AlphaChiSigma&gt;{{cite web|title=Alpha Chi Sigma Hall of Fame|url=http://www.alphachisigma.org/page.aspx?pid=268|publisher=Alpha Chi Sigma Fraternity|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Gamma Alpha]] Graduate Scientific Fraternity in December 1922.

Beckman decided to go to [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) for his doctorate. He stayed there for a year, before returning to New York to be near his fiancée, Mabel, who was working as a secretary for the [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable Life Assurance Society]]. He found a job with [[Western Electric]]'s engineering department, the precursor to the [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]]. Working with [[Walter A. Shewhart]],&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|61}} Beckman developed [[quality control]] programs for the manufacture of [[vacuum tube]]s and learned about circuit design. It was here that Beckman discovered his interest in [[electronics]].

[[File:Mabel and Arnold Beckman 4.23.tif|thumb|right| Mabel and Arnold Beckman]]

Beckman married Mabel on June 10, 1925.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|68}} In 1926 the couple moved back to California and Beckman resumed his studies at Caltech. He became interested in [[ultraviolet photolysis]] and worked with his doctoral advisor, [[Roscoe G. Dickinson]], on an instrument to find the energy of ultraviolet light. It worked by shining the ultraviolet light onto a [[thermocouple]], converting the incident heat into electricity, which drove a [[galvanometer]]. After receiving a Ph.D. in photochemistry in 1928&lt;ref name=OralHistory /&gt; for this application of quantum theory to chemical reactions, Beckman was asked to stay on at Caltech as an instructor and then as a professor.&lt;ref&gt;Beckman, A. O. (1928). The Photochemical Decomposition of Hydrogen Azide (Doctoral dissertation, California Institute of Technology)|URL=http://caltech.tind.io/record/571245&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linus Pauling]], another of [[Roscoe G. Dickinson]]'s graduate students, was also asked to stay on at Caltech.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|99}}

In 1933, Beckman and his family built a home in [[Altadena, California]], in the foothills and adjacent to Pasadena. They lived in Altadena for over 27 years, raising their family.

==Teaching and consultancy at Caltech==
[[File:Beckman lab Caltech 3.31.tif|thumb|right|Arnold Beckman's laboratory at Caltech]]
During his time at Caltech, Beckman was active in teaching at both the introductory and advanced graduate levels. Beckman shared his expertise in glass-blowing by teaching classes in the machine shop. He also taught classes in the design and use of research instruments.  Beckman dealt first-hand with the chemists' need for good instrumentation as manager of the chemistry department's instrument shop.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|96–99}} Beckman's interest in electronics made him very popular within the chemistry department at Caltech, as he was very skilled in building [[measuring instruments]].

Over the time that he was at Caltech, the focus of the department increasingly moved towards pure science and away from chemical engineering and applied chemistry. [[Arthur Amos Noyes]], head of the chemistry division, encouraged both Beckman and chemical engineer William Lacey to be in contact with real-world engineers and chemists, and  [[Robert Andrews Millikan]], Caltech's president, referred technical questions to Beckman from government and businesses.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|98–101}} With their blessing, Beckman began accepting outside work as a scientific and technical consultant. He also acted as a scientific expert in legal trials.

In 1934, Millikan referred I. H. Lyons from the National Postal Meter Company to Arnold Beckman. Lyons wanted a non-clogging ink so that postage could be printed by machines, instead of having clerks lick stamps.&lt;ref name=Jaehnig&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jaehnig|first1=Kenton G.|title=Finding Aid to the Beckman  Historical  Collection 1911 - 2011 (Bulk 1935 - 2004 )|url=http://othmerlib.sciencehistory.org/record=b1072260~S6|website=Science History Institute|quote="Click on 'Beckman Historical Collection Finding Aid' to go to full document."|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckman's solution was to make ink with [[butyric acid]], a malodorous substance. Because of this ingredient, no manufacturer wanted to manufacture it. Beckman decided to make it himself. He started the National Inking Appliance Company, obtaining space in a garage owned by instrument maker Fred Henson and hiring two Caltech students, Robert Barton and Henry Fracker. Beckman developed and took out a couple of patents for re-inking [[typewriter ribbon]]s, but marketing them was not successful. This was Beckman's first experience at running a company and marketing a product, and while this first product failed, Beckman repurposed the company for another product.

[[Sunkist Growers, Incorporated|Sunkist Growers]] was having problems with its own manufacturing process. Lemons that were not saleable as produce were made into [[pectin]] or [[citric acid]], with [[sulfur dioxide]] used as a preservative. Sunkist needed to know the [[pH|acidity of the product]] at any given time, and the colorimetric methods then in use, such as readings from [[litmus paper]], did not work well because sulfur dioxide interfered with them.  Chemist Glen Joseph at Sunkist was attempting to measure the hydrogen-ion concentration in lemon juice electrochemically, but sulfur dioxide damaged hydrogen electrodes, and non-reactive glass electrodes produced weak signals and were fragile.

Joseph approached Beckman, who proposed that instead of trying to increase the sensitivity of his measurements, he amplify his results. Beckman, familiar with glassblowing, electricity, and chemistry, suggested a design for a vacuum-tube amplifier and ended up building a working apparatus for Joseph.  The glass electrode used to measure pH was placed in a grid circuit in the vacuum tube, producing an amplified signal which could then be read by an electronic meter. The prototype was so useful that Joseph requested a second unit.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|124–129}}

Beckman saw an opportunity, and rethinking the project, decided to create a complete chemical instrument which could be easily transported and used by nonspecialists. By October 1934, he had registered patent application US Patent No. 2,058,761 for his "acidimeter", later renamed the pH meter.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|131}}&lt;ref name=Chicago /&gt; The Arthur H. Thomas Company, a nationally known scientific instrument dealer based in Philadelphia, was willing to try selling it.  Although it was priced expensively at $195, roughly the starting monthly wage for a chemistry professor at that time, it was significantly cheaper than the estimated cost of building a comparable instrument from individual components, about $500.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|134–135}} The original pH meter weighed in at nearly 7&amp;nbsp;kg, but was a substantial improvement over a benchful of delicate equipment. The earliest meter had a design glitch, in that the pH readings changed with the depth of immersion of the electrodes, but Beckman fixed the problem by sealing the glass bulb of the electrode.

On April 8, 1935, Beckman renamed his company [[National Technical Laboratories]], formally acknowledging his new focus on the making of scientific instruments.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|131–132}} The company rented larger quarters at 3330 Colorado Street,&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|135}} and began manufacturing pH meters. The pH meter is an important device for measuring the pH of a solution, and by 11 May 1939, sales were successful enough that Beckman left Caltech to become the full-time president of National Technical Laboratories.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|142–143}} By 1940, Beckman was able to take out a loan to build his own 12,000 square foot factory in South Pasadena.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|147–148}}

==Spectrophotometry==

===Ultraviolet===

[[File:James Feeman using Beckman DU spectrophotometer 2004.012.021.tif|thumb|right|Beckman DU spectrophotometer in use]]
In 1940, the equipment needed to measure light energy in the visible spectrum could cost a laboratory as much as $3,000, a huge amount at that time. There was also growing interest in examining ultraviolet spectra beyond that range. Just as Beckman had created a single easy-to-use instrument for measuring pH, he made it a goal to create an easy-to-use instrument for spectrophotometry. Beckman's research team, led by [[Howard Cary]], developed several models.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|148–149}}

The new spectrophotometers used a prism to separate light into its absorption spectrum and a phototube to electrically measure the light energy across the spectrum. They allowed the user to plot the light absorption spectrum of a substance, giving a standardized "fingerprint", characteristic of a compound.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|151}} With Beckman's model D, later known as the [[DU spectrophotometer]], National Technical Laboratories successfully provided the first easy-to-use single instrument containing both the optical and electronic components needed for [[Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy|ultraviolet-absorption spectrophotometry]].&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|153}} The user could insert a sample, dial up the desired wavelength of light, and read the amount of absorption of that frequency from a simple meter.  It produced accurate absorption spectra in both the ultraviolet and the visible regions of the spectrum with relative ease and repeatable accuracy.&lt;ref name=AHist&gt;{{cite web|title=Beckman DU Spectrophotometer|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_399|publisher=National Museum of American History|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The National Bureau of Standards ran tests to certify that the DU's results were accurate and repeatable and recommended its use.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|156}}

[[File:Penicillin poster 5.40.tif|thumb|upright | World War II penicillin poster]]
Beckman's DU spectrophotometer has been referred to as the "Model T" of scientific instruments: "This device forever simplified and streamlined chemical analysis, by allowing researchers to perform a 99.9% accurate quantitative measurement of a substance within minutes, as opposed to the weeks required previously for results of only 25% accuracy."&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite web|title=Arnold O.

Development of the spectrophotometer also had direct relevance to the war effort. For example, the role of vitamins in health was being studied, and scientists wanted to identify [[Vitamin A]]-rich foods to keep soldiers healthy. Previous  methods involved feeding rats for several weeks, then performing a biopsy to estimate Vitamin A levels.  The DU spectrophotometer yielded better results in a matter of minutes.&lt;ref name=LabNews&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mark|first=Andrew|title=Leading the way in chemical instrumentation|journal=Laboratory News|date=September 21, 2007|url=http://www.labnews.co.uk/features/leading-the-way-in-chemical-instrumentation/|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DU spectrophotometer was also an important tool for scientists studying and producing the new wonder drug penicillin.&lt;ref name=Smutzer&gt;{{cite news|last=Smutzer|first=Gregory|title=Spectrophotometers: An Absorbing Tale|accessdate=6 March 2014|newspaper=The Scientist|date=October 15, 2001|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/13639/title/Spectrophotometers--An-Absorbing-Tale/}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, American pharmaceutical companies were producing 650 billion units of penicillin each month.&lt;ref name=Penicillin&gt;{{cite web|last=Markel|first=Howard|title=The Real Story Behind Penicillin|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/the-real-story-behind-the-worlds-first-antibiotic/|work=September 27, 2013|publisher=PBS Newshour|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the work done in this area during World War II was kept secret until after the war.&lt;ref name="Sneader"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sneader|first1=Walter|title=Drug Discovery: A History|date=2005|publisher=John Wiley|location=Chichester|isbn=9780470359297|page=294|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cb6BOkj9fK4C&amp;pg=PA294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrared===

[[File:Beckman Ir-1 Spectrophotometer, ca. 1941.jpg|thumb|220px|Beckman IR-1 Spectrophotometer, ca. 1941]]
--&gt;
Beckman and his company were involved in a number of secret projects. There was a critical shortage of [[rubber]], which was used in jeep and airplane tires and in tanks. Natural sources from the Far East were unavailable because of the war, and scientists sought a reliable synthetic substitute. Beckman was approached  by the Office of Rubber Reserve about developing an [[Infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrophotometer]] to aid in the study of chemicals such as [[toluene]] and [[butadiene]]. The Office of Rubber Reserve met secretly in Detroit  with [[Robert Brattain]] of the Shell Development Company, Arnold O. Beckman, and R. Bowling Barnes of American Cyanamid. Beckman was asked to secretly produce a hundred infrared spectrophotometers to be used by authorized government scientists, based on a design for a single-beam spectrophotometer which had already been developed by Robert Brattain for Shell.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|163}} The result was the  Beckman IR-1 Spectrophotometer.

By September 1942, the first of the instruments was being shipped.  Approximately 75 IR-1s were made between 1942 and 1945 for use by the US synthetic-rubber effort. The researchers were not allowed to publish or discuss anything related to the new machines until after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beckman Infrared Spectrometer|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/research/policy-center/oral-history-program/projects/rubber-matters/feature-beckman-ir.aspx|publisher=[[Chemical Heritage Foundation]]|accessdate=24 June 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204215034/http://www.chemheritage.org/research/policy-center/oral-history-program/projects/rubber-matters/feature-beckman-ir.aspx|archivedate = February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other researchers who were independently pursuing the development of infrared spectrometry, were able to publish and to develop instruments during this time without being affected by secrecy restrictions.

Beckman had continued to develop the infrared spectrophotometer after the release of the IR-1.  Facing stiff competition, he decided in 1953 to go forward with a radical redesign of the instrument.  The result was the IR-4, which could be operated using either a single or double beam of infrared light.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|165}}  This allowed a user to take both the reference measurement and the sample measurement at the same time.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|163}}

==Other secret projects==

===Helipot===
[[File:Beckman Helipot potentiometer SA1400A 2007.075.002.jpg|thumb|right|Beckman Helipot potentiometer SA1400A]]
At the same time that Beckman was approached about infrared spectrometry, he was contacted by Paul Rosenberg. Rosenberg worked at MIT's [[Radiation Laboratory]].  The lab was part of a secret network of research institutions in both the United States and Britain that were working to develop [[radar]], "radio detecting and ranging".  The project was interested in Beckman because of the high quality of the tuning knobs or "potentiometers" which were used on his pH meters.  Beckman had trademarked the design of the pH meter knobs, under the name "helipot" for "helical potentiometer".  Rosenberg had found that the helipot was more precise, by a factor of ten, than other knobs.  Nonetheless, for use in continuously moving airplanes, ships, or submarines, which might be under attack, a redesign would be needed to ensure that the knobs could withstand shocks and vibrations.

Beckman was not allowed to tell his staff the reason behind the redesign, and they were not particularly interested in the problem; he eventually came up with a solution himself.  Instead of using a wire wrapped around a coil, with pressure from a small spring to create a single contact point, he redesigned the knob to have a continuous groove, in which the contact point was contained. The contact point could then move smoothly and continuously, and could not be jarred out of contact. Beckman's Model A Helipot was in tremendous demand by the military.  Within the first year of its production, its sales became 40% of the company's income. Beckman spun off a separate company, the Helipot Corporation, to take on the electronics component manufactory.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|167–175}}

===Pauling oxygen meter===
[[File:Newborn-incubator-toronto.jpg|thumb|upright| Incubator, 1950's]]

[[Linus Pauling]] at Caltech was also doing secret work for the military.  The [[National Defense Research Committee]] called a meeting on October 3, 1940, wanting an instrument that could reliably measure oxygen content in a mixture of gases, so that they could measure oxygen conditions in submarines and airplanes. Pauling designed the Pauling oxygen meter for them.  Originally approached to supply housing boxes for the meter by Holmes Sturdivant, Pauling's assistant, Beckman was soon asked to produce the entire instrument.

While the board of the National Technical Laboratory was unwilling to support the secret project, whose details they could not be told, they agreed that Beckman was free to follow up on it independently. Beckman set up a second spinoff company, Arnold O. Beckman, Inc., for their manufacture.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|180–185}}  Creating the oxygen meter was a technical challenge, involving the creation of tiny, highly precise glass dumbbells. Beckman created a tiny glass-blowing machine which would generate a precisely measured puff of air to create the glass balls.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|185–186}}

After the war, Beckman developed oxygen analyzers for another market.  They were used to monitor conditions in incubators for premature babies. Doctors at Johns Hopkins University used them to determine recommendations for healthy oxygen levels for incubators.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|185–186}}

===Manhattan Project===
Beckman instruments were also used by the [[Manhattan Project]]. Scientists in the project were attempting to develop instruments to measure [[radiation]] in gas-filled, electrically charged [[ionization chamber]]s in nuclear reactors.  It was difficult to get reliable readings because the signals were weak.  Beckman realized that with a relatively minor adjustment - substituting an input-load resistor for the glass electrode - the pH meter could be adapted to do the job.  As a result, Beckman Instruments developed a new product, the micro-ammeter.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|175–177}}

In addition, Beckman developed a [[dosimeter]] for measuring exposure to radiation, to protect personnel of the Manhattan project. The dosimeter was a miniature ionization chamber, charged with 170 volts. It had a small calibrated scale on top, whose needle was a platinum-covered quartz fiber.  The dosimeters were also manufactured by Beckman's spinoff company, Arnold O. Beckman, Inc.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|177–178}}

==Battling smog==
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= [[File:Los Angeles Pollution.jpg|210px]]  | audio1 = [https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/podcast/fighting-smog-in-los-angeles “Fighting Smog in Los Angeles”], ''Distillations'' Podcast, 2018 [[Science History Institute]]}}

In postwar Southern California, including the area of Pasadena where the Beckmans lived, [[smog]] was becoming an increasing topic of conversation, as well as an unpleasant experience. First characterized as "gas attacks" in 1943, suspicion fell on a variety of possible causes including the [[smudge pot]]s used by orange growers, the smoke produced by local industrial plants, and car exhausts.  The Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce was one of the organizations concerned about the possible causes and effects of smog, as it related both to industry (and jobs) and to quality of life in the area.  Beckman was involved with the Chamber of Commerce.

In 1947, California governor [[Earl Warren]] signed a statewide air pollution control act, authorizing the creation of Air Pollution Control Districts (APCDs) in every county of the state.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/resourcecenter/teams/airquality/teamaq_law.pdf|title=An Overview of Federal Air Quality Legislation|authors=Tianjia Tang, Bob O'Loughlin, Mike Roberts, Edward Dancausse|publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]]|accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce asked Beckman to represent them in dealing with creation of a local APCD. The new APCD, when formed, asked Beckman to become the scientific consultant to the Air Pollution Control Officer.  He held the position from 1948 to 1952.

The Air Pollution Control Officer in question was Louis McCabe, a geologist with a background in chemical engineering. McCabe initially suspected that smog was a result of sulfur dioxide pollution, and proposed that the county convert the suspected pollutant into fertilizer through a costly process.  Beckman was not convinced that sulfur dioxide was the real culprit behind Los Angeles smog. He visited Gary, Indiana, where steps were being taken to address sulfur dioxide pollution, and was struck by the characteristic smell of sulfur in the air. Returning, Beckman convinced McCabe that they needed to search for a different cause.

[[File:Beckman patent 1071952 Sheet 1 crop.tif|thumb|upright|Patent 1071952, "Apparatus for recording gas concentrations in the atmosphere"]]

Beckman got in touch with a Caltech professor who was working on smog, [[Arie Jan Haagen-Smit]]. They developed an apparatus to collect particulate matter from Los Angeles air, using a system of tubing intermittently cooled by liquid nitrogen. Haagen-Smit identified the substance they collected as a [[Organic peroxide|peroxy organic material]].  He agreed to  spend a year studying the chemistry of smog. His results, presented in 1952, identified ozone and hydrocarbons from smokestacks, refineries and car exhausts as key ingredients in the formation of smog.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|220–224}}

While Haagen-Smit worked out the genesis of smog, Beckman developed an instrument to measure it.  On October 7, 1952, he was granted a patent for an "oxygen recorder" that used [[Colorimetry|colorimetric methods]] to measure the levels of compounds present in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|224–226}} Beckman Instruments eventually developed a range of instruments for various uses in monitoring and treating automobile exhaust and air pollution. They even produced "air quality monitoring vans", customized laboratories on wheels for use by government and industry.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|224–226}}

Beckman himself was approached by California governor [[Goodwin Knight]] to head a Special Committee on Air Pollution, to propose ways to combat smog.  At the end of 1953, the committee made its findings public.  The "Beckman Bible" advised key steps to be taken immediately:&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|225}}
* stopping vapor leaks from refineries and filling stations
* establishing standards for automobile exhausts
* converting from diesel trucks and buses to propane
* asking polluting industries to restrict pollutants or move away from cities
* banning open burning of trash
* developing regional mass transportation

Beckman Instruments also acquired the Liston-Becker Instrument Company in June 1955. Founded by [[Max D. Liston]], Liston-Becker had a successful record in the development of [[infrared gas analyzer]]s.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|207–208}} Liston developed instruments to measure [[smog]] and car exhaust emissions, essential to attempts to improve [[Los Angeles]] air quality in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Model28&gt;{{cite web|title=Liston-Becker Model 28 Exhaust Gas Analyzer|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/liston-becker-model-28-exhaust-gas-analyzer|website=[[Science History Institute]]|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckman helped to create the Air Pollution Foundation, a non-profit organization to support research on finding solutions to smog, and educating the public about scientific issues related to smog.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|225}}

In 1954, he became a member of the board of directors of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, and chairman of its Air Pollution Committee. He advocated for stronger powers for the APCD, and encouraged industry, business, and citizens to support for their work.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|226}} He helped the Chamber of Commerce to develop a unified approach to monitoring smog, broadcasting smog alerts, and addressing the smog problem. On January 25, 1956, he became president of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce.  He identified the two key issues of his term as battling smog, and supporting the collaboration of local science, technology, industry, and education.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|227}}

Beckman recognized that air quality would not improve overnight. His work with air quality continued for years, and brought him national attention.  In 1967, Beckman was appointed to the Federal Air Quality Board for a four-year term, by President [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|228}}

==Electronics==
John J. Murdock held substantial stock in National Technical Laboratories.  He and Arnold Beckman signed a stock option agreement by which Beckman could purchase Murdock's NTL stock from his estate after his death.  When Murdock died in 1948, Beckman was able to gain a controlling interest in the company.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|195–196}} On April 27, 1950, National Technical Laboratories was renamed Beckman Instruments, Incorporated.  In 1952, Beckman Instruments became a publicly traded company on the [[New York Curb Exchange]], generating new capital for expansion, including overseas expansion.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|197,232–233}}

===Cermets===
Helipot Corporation, the spinoff company that Beckman had created when NTL's board were dubious about electronics, was reincorporated into Beckman Instruments and became the Helipot Division in 1958.  Helipot researchers were experimenting with [[cermet]]s, composite materials made by mixing [[ceramic]]s and [[metals]].  Potentiometers made with cermet instead of metal were more heat-resistant, suitable for use at extreme temperatures.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|211}}

===Centrifuges===
In 1954, Beckman Instruments acquired [[ultracentrifuge]] maker Spinco (Specialized Instruments Corp.), founded by Edward Greydon Pickels in 1946.  This acquisition was the basis of Beckman's Spinco [[centrifuge]] division. The division went on to design and manufacture a range of preparative and analytical ultracentrifuges.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;

===Semiconductors===
In 1955, Beckman was contacted by [[William Shockley]].  Shockley, who had been one of Beckman's students at Caltech, led [[Bell Labs]] research program into [[Semiconductor|semiconductor technology]]. Semiconductors were, in some ways, similar to cermets.  Shockley wanted to create a new company, and asked Beckman to serve on the board. After considerable discussion, Beckman became more closely involved: he and Shockley signed a letter of intent to create the [[Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory]] as a subsidiary of Beckman Instruments, under  William Shockley's direction.  The new group would specialize in semiconductors, beginning with the automated production of [[Diffusion transistor|diffused-base transistors]].&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|237–241}}&lt;ref name=IEEE20131129&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brock|first=David C.|title=How William Shockley’s Robot Dream Helped Launch Silicon Valley|journal=IEEE Spectrum|date=29 Nov 2013|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/how-william-shockleys-robot-dream-helped-launch-silicon-valley|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Shockley's aging mother lived in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], Shockley wanted to establish the laboratory in nearby [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View, California]]. [[Frederick Terman]], provost at [[Stanford University]], offered the firm space in Stanford's new industrial park. The firm launched in February 1956, the same year that Shockley received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] along with [[John Bardeen]] and [[Walter Houser Brattain]] "for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1956 |publisher=Nobel Foundation |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1956/index.html |accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as Silicon Valley.

Shockley, however, lacked experience in business and industrial management.  Moreover, he decided that the lab would research an invention of his own, the four-layer diode, rather than developing the diffused silicon transistor that he and Beckman had agreed upon. Beckman was reassured by his engineers that the scientific ideas behind Shockley's project were still sound. When appealed to by members of Shockley's lab, Beckman chose not to interfere with its management.&lt;ref name=IEEE20131129/&gt;  In 1957, eight leading scientists including [[Gordon Moore]] and [[Robert Noyce]] left Shockley's group to form a competing startup, [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], which would successfully develop silicon transistors.  In 1960, Beckman sold the Shockley subsidiary to the Clevite Transistor Company, ending his formal association with semiconductors.  Nonetheless, Beckman had been an essential backer of the new industry in its initial stages.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|237–250}}

===Computers and automation===
[[File:First spacecraft picture of the Moon PIA02975.jpg|thumb|right |The first picture of the Moon taken by a US spacecraft, Ranger 7, on 31 July 1964]]

Beckman also saw that computers and automation offered a myriad of opportunities for integration into instruments, and the development of new instruments.  Beckman Instruments purchased Berkeley Scientific Company in the 1950s, and later developed a Systems Division within [[Beckman Coulter|Beckman Instruments]] "to develop and build industrial data systems for automation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/wsj/doc/132348380.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Jul+9%2C+1957&amp;author=&amp;pub=Wall+Street+Journal++%281923+-+Current+file%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=12&amp;desc=Beekman+Instruments+Data+Systems | title=Beekman Instruments Data Systems | date=9 July 1957 | newspaper=Wall Street Journal | page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Berkeley developed the EASE [[analog computer]], and by 1959 Beckman had contracts with major companies in the aerospace, space, and defense industries, including [[Boeing|Boeing Aerospace]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed Aircraft]], [[North American Aviation]], and [[Lear Siegler]]. The Beckman Systems Division also developed specialized computer systems to handle large volumes of [[Telemetry|telemetric]] radio data from satellites and unmanned spacecraft. These included systems to process photographs of the moon, taken by NASA's Ranger spacecraft.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|252–258}}

==Philanthropy==
The 1960s were a time of change for the Beckmans.  Mabel fell in love with a house by the sea in [[Corona del Mar]] near [[Newport Beach]], California. They  bought the house in 1960, renovated it, and lived there together until Mabel's death in 1989.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT1989&gt;{{cite news|last=Berkman|first=Leslie|title=Mabel Beckman, Noted Philanthropist, Dies at 88|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-03/local/me-1023_1_beckman-instruments-mrs-beckman-mabel-beckman|accessdate=7 March 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 3, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckman also chose to retire. He and his wife Mabel became increasingly active as philanthropists, with the stated intention of giving away their personal wealth before their deaths.&lt;ref name=Chicago&gt;{{cite news|last=Luther|first=Claudia|title=Arnold O.

The Beckmans' first major philanthropic gift went to Caltech.
In supporting Caltech, they expanded on the long-term relationship that Beckman had begun as a student at Caltech, and continued as a teacher and trustee. In 1962, they funded the construction of a concert hall, the Beckman Auditorium, designed by architect [[Edward Durrell Stone]].&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|289–290}}&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news|title=Work begins officially on Caltech Auditorium|newspaper=The Independent (Pasadena, California)|date=9 January 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a period of years, they also supported the [[Beckman Institute at Caltech|Beckman Institute]], Beckman Auditorium, Beckman Laboratory of Behavioral Sciences, and Beckman Laboratory of Chemical Synthesis at the California Institute of Technology.  In the words of Caltech's president emeritus [[David Baltimore]], Beckman "has shaped the destiny of Caltech."&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt; The Beckmans are also named in the [[Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology]] and the Beckman Quadrangle at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;

The Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation was incorporated in September 1977.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|317}} At the time of Beckman's death, the Foundation had given more than 400 million dollars to a variety of charities and organizations.&lt;ref name=LAT2004Pasco&gt;{{cite news|last=Pasco|first=Jean O.|title=Beckman Remembered as 'Larger Than Life'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jun/12/local/me-beckman12|accessdate=8 March 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990, it was considered one of the top ten foundations in California, based on annual gifts.&lt;ref name=LAT1990&gt;{{cite news|title=California's Top Foundations|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-01/news/vw-1073_1_southern-california-grant|accessdate=7 March 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 1, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Donations chiefly went to scientists and scientific causes as well as Beckman's ''[[alma mater]]s''. He is quoted as saying, "I accumulated my wealth by selling instruments to scientists,... so I thought it would be appropriate to make contributions to science, and that's been my number one guideline for charity."&lt;ref name=quote&gt;{{cite web|first=Jack|last=Williams|title=Arnold O.

After Mabel's death in 1989, Arnold Beckman reorganized the foundation to continue in perpetuity, and developed new initiatives for the foundation's giving.&lt;ref name=Gochman /&gt;

A major focus became the improvement of science education. Beginning in 1998 the Foundation has provided over $23 million to support K-6 hands-on, research-based science education to school districts in Orange County, California, stimulating schools to integrate science into the K-6 curriculum as a core subject.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis Jr.|first1=Martin A.|title=Inventing New Ways to Teach Science|journal=Philanthropy magazine|date=July 2003|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/inventing_new_ways_to_teach_science|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LATgift144&gt;{{cite news|last=Nguyen|first=Tina|title=Beckman's $14.4-Million Science Project|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/15/news/mn-23331|accessdate=8 March 2014|date=September 15, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT1998Martelle&gt;{{cite news|last=Martelle|first=Scott|title=Glad Scientist: Child of Einstein Age, Arnold Beckman Sows Educational Seeds for Another|accessdate=8 March 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 21, 1998|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/21/local/me-25003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT1998&gt;{{cite news|title=An Impressive Assist for Schools|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/20/local/me-24677|accessdate=7 March 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1998-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[graphonomics]], '''Axial pen force''' is the [[vector (geometric)|component]] of the [[normal pen force]] that is parallel to the pen. It is dependent upon [[pen tilt]]. In the special case of a perfectly vertical orientation of the [[writing instrument]] the axial pen force
equals the [[normal pen force]].

'''Beer''' is a crater lying situated within the [[Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle]] (MC-19) region of the planet [[Mars]], named in honor of the German astronomer, [[Wilhelm Beer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Planetary Names: Crater, craters: Beer on Mars|url = http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/659|website = planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located at 14.4°S 351.8°E .

Beer and collaborator [[Johann Heinrich Mädler]] produced the first reasonably good maps of Mars in the early 1830s. When doing so, they selected a particular feature for the [[prime meridian]] of their charts. Their choice was strengthened when [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] used the same location in 1877 for his more famous maps of Mars. The feature was later called Sinus Meridiani ("Middle Bay"), but following the landing of the [[NASA]] probe [[MER-B|MER-B Opportunity]] in 2004 it is perhaps better known as [[Meridiani Planum]].  Currently the Martian prime meridian is the crater [[Airy-0]].

Beer lies in the southwest of Meridiani Planum, about 8° from the prime meridian and about 10° west from the crater [[Mädler (crater on Mars)|Mädler]]. [[Schiaparelli (Martian crater)|Schiaparelli]] is also in the region.

'''Billietite''' is an uncommon mineral of [[Uranium]] that contains [[Barium]].  It has the chemical formula: Ba(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;•8H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. It usually occurs as clear yellow  [[orthorhombic]] crystals.&lt;ref&gt;M. Katherine Pagoaga, Daniel E, Appleman, &amp; James M.

The '''cage effect''' in [[chemistry]] describes how the properties of a [[molecule]] are affected by its surroundings. First introduced by Franck and Rabinowitch &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rabinowitch, Franck|first=|year=1934|title=Some remarks about free radicals and the photochemisty of solutions|url=|journal=Transactions of the Faraday Society|volume=30|pages=120–130|via=Scopus|doi=10.1039/tf9343000120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rabinowitch|first=E|year=1936|title=The collison{{sic|nolink=y|expected=error is in original}} mechanism and the primary photochemical process in solutions|url=|journal=Transactions of the Faraday Society|volume=32|pages=1381–1387|via=Socpus|doi=10.1039/tf9363201381}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1934, the cage effect suggests that instead of acting as an individual particle, molecules in solvent are more accurately described as an encapsulated particle.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denisov|first=E.T.|year=1984|title=Cage effects in a polymer matrix|url=|journal=Macromolecular Chemistry and Physics|volume=8|pages=63–78|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/macp.1984.020081984106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Polymer Science and Chemistry: A problem solving approach|last=Chanda|first=Manas|publisher=CRC Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=New York|pages=291, 301–303|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to interact with other molecules, the caged particle must diffuse from its solvent cage. The typical lifetime of a solvent cage is 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herk | first1 = L. | last2 = Feld | first2 = M. | last3 = Szwarc | first3 = M. | year = 1961 | title = Studies of "Cage" Reactions | url = | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 2998–3005 | doi=10.1021/ja01475a005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Radical polymerization|free radical polymerization]], radicals formed from the decomposition of an initiator molecule are surrounded by a cage consisting of solvent and/or monomer molecules.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Within the cage, the free radicals undergo  many collisions leading to their recombination or mutual deactivation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braden|first=Dale, A.|year=2001|title=Solvent cage effects. I. Effect of radical mass and size on radical cage pair recombination efficiency. II. Is geminate recombination of polar radicals sensitive to solvent polarity?|url=|journal=Coordination Chemistry Reviews|volume=211|pages=279–294|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/s0010-8545(00)00287-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be described in the follow reaction:

&lt;math&gt;
R\!-\!R
\;\;\underset{k_c}{\overset{k_1}{\rightleftharpoons}}\;\;
\underset{\text{cage pair}}{(R^{\,\bullet},^{\bullet}\!R)}
\;\;\underset{k_D}{\overset{k_d}{\rightleftharpoons}}\;\;
\underset{\text{free radicals}}{2R^{\,\bullet}}
\;\rightarrow\;
\text{Products}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

After recombination, free radicals can either react with monomer molecules within the cage walls or diffuse out of the cage. In polymers, the probability of a free radical pair to escape recombination in the cage is 0.1 - 0.01 and 0.3-0.8 in liquids.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cage recombination efficiency ==

The cage effect can be quantitatively described as the '''cage recombination efficiency'''  F&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; where:

&lt;math&gt;F_c = k_c/(k_c + k_d)   &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Here F&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as the ratio of the rate constant for cage recombination (k&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) to the sum of the rate constants for all cage processes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to mathematical models, F&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is dependent on changes on several parameters including radical size, shape, and solvent viscosity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noyes|first=R.M.|year=1954|title=A Treatment of Chemical Kinetics with Special Applicability to Diffusion Controlled Reactions|url=|journal=J. Chem. Phys. |volume=22|pages=1349|doi=10.1063/1.1740394|bibcode=1954JChPh..22.1349N}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noyes|first=R.M.|year=1961|title=|url=|journal=Progr. React. Kinet.|volume=1|pages=129|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that the cage effect will increase with an increase in radical size and a decrease in radical mass.

== Initiator efficiency ==

In free radical polymerization, the rate of initiation is dependent on how effective the initiator is.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Low initiator efficiency, ƒ, is largely attributed to the cage effect. The rate of initiation is described as:

&lt;math&gt;R_i = 2fk_d[I]   &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

where R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the rate of initiation, k&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is the rate constant for initiator dissociation,  [I] is the initial concentration of initiator. Initiator efficiency represents the fraction of primary radicals R·, that actually contribute to chain initiation. Due to the cage effect, free radicals can undergo mutual deactivation which produces stable products instead of initiating propagation - reducing the value of ƒ.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2105">'''Charles Cabrier II''' (18th century) was a notable London clock and scientific instrument maker.

== Biography ==
Charles Cabrier II, son of Charles I and father of Charles III, was the most prominent clockmaker of the three namesakes. The Cabriers were a celebrated dynasty of Huguenot clockmakers who settled in [[London]] after the Revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] (1685).&lt;ref&gt;[https://discoveringclocks.wordpress.com/2016/06/13/the-cabriers-huguenot-clockmakers-in-london/ The Cabriers: Huguenot Clockmakers in London]&lt;/ref&gt; A relatively large number of their clocks - built over a period of half a century - have survived.&lt;ref&gt;[[Museo Galileo]]. "[http://catalogue.museogalileo.it/biography/CharlesCabrierII.html Charles Cabrier II]". Catalogue of the Museo Galileo's Instruments on Display. ''catalogue.museogalileo.it''&lt;/ref&gt;

Apprenticed in 1719, Charles Cabrier II joined the [[Clockmakers' Company]] in 1726; he was [[Master craftsman|Master]] from 1757 to 1772.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mch9CgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT28&amp;ots=saLS_CDHPZ&amp;dq=Charles%20Cabrier%20III&amp;pg=PT28#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An Encyclopaedia of Famous Clock and Watchmakers]&lt;/ref&gt; Many examples of his work, including table clocks, carriage clocks, and pocket watches, are preserved in collections and museums in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] and [[America]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], and [[Russia]].

'''Cinco''' is a small crater in the [[Descartes Highlands]] of the moon visited by the astronauts of [[Apollo 16]].  The crater is one of a group of five (hence the name, Spanish for ''five'') craters that were collectively called the Cinco craters during the Apollo 16 mission.  The craters were designated ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', and ''e'', and the largest (''a'') was officially named ''Cinco'' after the mission in 1973 by the [[IAU]].&lt;ref name=GPN/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.pan4623slbl.jpg NASA map showing the craters], part of AS16-P-4623&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 1972, the Apollo 16 [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] (LM) ''Orion'' landed about 4&amp;nbsp;km north of Cinco, northeast of the prominent [[South Ray (crater)|South Ray]] crater.  The astronauts [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Charles Duke]] explored the area over the course of three [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVAs]] using a [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]], or rover.  They drove up Stone Mountain to Station 4, about 80 m west of Cinco crater, on EVA 2.  The primary goal of sampling on Stone Mountain was to attempt to sample the Descartes Formation, although it remains unclear to this day if the Descartes was sampled.&lt;ref&gt;To a Rocky Moon: A Geologist's History of Lunar Exploration.

The '''Coma Supercluster''' ('''SCl 117''') is a nearby [[supercluster]] of [[Galaxy|galaxies]] comprising the [[Coma Cluster]] (Abell 1656) and the [[Leo Cluster]] (Abell 1367).

==Location==
Located 300 million [[light-year]]s from [[Earth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superclusters - A Review of the Universe|url=https://universe-review.ca/F03-supercluster.htm|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is in the center of the [[CfA2 Great Wall|Great Wall]] and a part of [[Coma Filament]].&lt;ref&gt;'Astronomy and Astrophysics' ({{ISSN|0004-6361}}), vol. 138, no. 1, Sept. 1984, pp. 85-92. Research supported by Cornell University "The Coma/A 1367 filament of galaxies" ''09/1984'' {{bibcode|1984A&amp;A...138...85F}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coma Supercluster is the nearest massive cluster of galaxies to our own [[Virgo Supercluster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cosmic Distance Scale|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/nearest_superclusters_info.html|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Size==
It is roughly spherical, about 20 million light-years in diameter and contains more than 3,000 galaxies. It is located in the constellation [[Coma Berenices]]. Being one of the first superclusters to be discovered, the Coma Supercluster helped [[astronomer]]s understand the [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|large scale structure of the universe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4496">In [[formal grammar]] theory, the '''deterministic context-free grammars''' ('''DCFGs''') are a [[proper subset]] of the [[context-free grammars]]. They are the subset of context-free grammars that can be derived from [[deterministic pushdown automata]], and they generate the [[deterministic context-free language]]s. DCFGs are always [[unambiguous grammar|unambiguous]], and are an important subclass of unambiguous CFGs; there are non-deterministic unambiguous CFGs, however.

DCFGs are of great practical interest, as they can be parsed in linear time and in fact a parser can be automatically generated from the grammar by a [[parser generator]]. They are thus widely used throughout computer science. Various restricted forms of DCFGs can be parsed by simpler, less resource-intensive parsers, and thus are often used. These grammar classes are referred to by the type of parser that parses them, and important examples are LALR, SLR, and LL.

==History==

In the 1960s, theoretical research in computer science on [[regular expressions]] and [[finite automata]] led to the discovery that [[context-free grammars]] are equivalent to nondeterministic [[pushdown automata]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; These grammars were thought to capture the syntax of computer programming languages. The first computer programming languages were under development at the time (see [[History of programming languages]]) and writing [[compilers]] was difficult. But using [[context-free grammars]] to help automate the parsing part of the compiler simplified the task. Deterministic context-free grammars were particularly useful because they could be parsed sequentially by a [[deterministic pushdown automaton]], which was a requirement due to computer memory constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editors = A Salomaa, D Wood, S Yu | editor-link = A Salomaa | editor2-link = D Wood | editor3-link = S Yu | title = [[A Half-Century of Automata Theory]] | year = 2001 | publisher = World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd. | pages =38–39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, [[Donald Knuth]] invented the [[LR parser|LR(k) parser]] and proved that there exists an LR(k) grammar for every deterministic context-free language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Knuth | first1 = D.

In 1969 [[Frank DeRemer]] invented the [[LALR]] and [[SLR parser|Simple LR]] parsers, both based on the LR parser and having greatly reduced memory requirements at the cost of less language recognition power. The LALR parser was the stronger alternative.&lt;ref name="1969 DeRemer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Practical Translators for LR(k) languages |url=http://computer-refuge.org/bitsavers/pdf/mit/lcs/tr/MIT-LCS-TR-065.pdf |author=Franklin L.

Recent research has identified methods by which canonical LR parsers may be implemented with dramatically reduced table requirements over Knuth's table-building algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;X.

[[Image:Diamond Fly Cutting Machine.jpg|thumb|right|Diamond flycutting]]

'''Diamond turning''' is [[turning]] with [[diamond]] as the [[cutting tool (machining)|cutting tool]]. It is a process of mechanical [[machining]] of precision elements using [[lathe]]s or derivative machine tools (e.g., turn-mills, rotary transfers) equipped with natural or synthetic diamond-tipped [[tool bit]]s. The term '''single-point diamond turning''' ('''SPDT''') is sometimes applied, although as with other lathe work, the "single-point" label is sometimes only nominal (radiused tool noses and contoured form tools being options). The process of diamond turning is widely used to manufacture high-quality [[aspheric lens|aspheric]] optical elements from [[crystal]]s, [[metal]]s, [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]], and other materials. Plastic optics are frequently molded using diamond turned mold inserts. Optical elements produced by the means of diamond turning are used in optical assemblies in [[telescope]]s, [[video projector]]s, [[missile guidance]] systems, lasers, scientific research instruments, and numerous other systems and devices. Most SPDT today is done with [[numerical control|computer numerical control]] (CNC) machine tools. Diamonds also serve in other machining processes, such as milling, grinding, and honing. Diamond turned surfaces have a high specular brightness and require no additional polishing or buffing, unlike other conventionally machined surfaces

==Process==
Diamond turning is a multi-stage process. Initial stages of machining are carried out using a series of CNC lathes of increasing accuracy. A diamond-tipped lathe tool is used in the final stages of the manufacturing process to achieve sub-[[nanometer]] level surface finishes and sub-[[micrometre|micrometer]] form accuracies.{{cn|reason=the claim of sub-nanometer surface finish is disputed; see talk|date=January 2018}} The surface finish quality is measured as the peak-to-valley distance of the grooves left by the lathe. The form accuracy is measured as a [[mean absolute deviation|mean deviation]] from the ideal target form. Quality of surface finish and form accuracy is monitored throughout the manufacturing process using such equipment as contact and laser [[profilometer]]s, laser [[interferometer]]s, [[microscope|optical]] and [[electron microscope]]s.  Diamond turning is most often used for making infrared optics, because at longer wavelengths optical performance is less sensitive to surface finish quality, and because many of the materials used are difficult to polish with traditional methods.

Temperature control is crucial, because the surface must be accurate on distance scales shorter than the wavelength of light. Temperature changes of a few degrees during machining can alter the form of the surface enough to have an effect. The main spindle may be cooled with a liquid coolant to prevent temperature deviations.

The diamonds that are used in the process are incredibly strong in the vertical downward direction but very weak in the upward and sideways directions.

== The machine tool ==
For best possible quality natural diamonds are used as single-point cutting elements during the final stages of the machining process. A CNC SPDT lathe rests atop a high-quality [[granite]] base with micrometer surface finish quality. The granite base is placed on air suspension on a solid foundation, keeping its working surface strictly horizontal. The machine tool components are placed on top of the granite base and can be moved with high degree of accuracy using a high-pressure air cushion or hydraulic suspension. The machined element is attached to an air [[Chuck (engineering)|chuck]] using negative air pressure and is usually centered manually using a micrometer. The chuck itself is separated from the electric motor that spins it by another air suspension.

The cutting tool is moved with sub-micron precision by a combination of electric motors and [[piezoelectric]] actuators. As with other CNC machines, the motion of the tool is controlled by a list of coordinates generated by a computer. Typically, the part to be created is first described using a [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] model, then converted to [[G-code]] using a [[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]] program, and the G-code is then executed by the machine control computer to move the cutting tool.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The final surface is achieved with a series of cutting passes of decreasing depth.

Alternative methods of diamond machining in practice also include diamond fly cutting and diamond milling. Diamond fly cutting can be used to generate [[diffraction grating]]s and other linear patterns with appropriately contoured diamond shapes. Diamond milling can be used to generate aspheric lens arrays by annulus cutting methods with a spherical diamond tool.

== Materials ==
Diamond turning is specifically useful when cutting materials that are viable as infrared optical components and certain non-linear optical components such as [[monopotassium phosphate|KDP]]. [[monopotassium phosphate|KDP]] is a perfect material in application for diamond turning, because the material is very desirable for its [[Optical modulator|optical modulating]] properties, yet it is impossible to make optics from this material using conventional methods. KDP is water-soluble, so conventional grinding and [[polishing]] techniques are not effective in producing optics. Diamond turning works well to produce optics from KDP.

Generally, diamond turning is restricted to certain materials. Materials that are readily machinable include:&lt;ref name=Gerchman&gt;{{cite journal | author=Mark Craig Gerchman | title=Specifications and manufacturing considerations of diamond-machined optical components. | journal=Optical Components Specifications for Laser-based Systems and other Modern Optical Systems | year=1986 | volume=607 | pages=36–45 |url=http://fp.optics.arizona.edu/optomech/papers/Gerchman%201986.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Silicon-based glasses and ceramics
*Ferrous materials ([[steel]], [[iron]])
*[[Beryllium]]
*[[Titanium]]
*[[Molybdenum]]
*[[Nickel]] (except for electroless nickel plating)

Ferrous materials are not readily machinable because the carbon in the diamond tool chemically reacts with the substrate, leading to tool damage and dulling after short cut lengths. Several techniques have been investigated to prevent this reaction, but few have been successful for long diamond machining processes at mass production scales. 

Tool life improvement has been under consideration in diamond turning as the tool is expensive. Hybrid processes such as laser-assisted machining have emerged in this industry recently.&lt;ref name=Mohammadi&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Hossein |last1=Mohammadi | first2=H.

The laser softens hard and difficult-to-machine materials such as ceramics and semiconductors, making them easier to cut.&lt;ref name=Mohammadi2&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Hossein |last1=Mohammadi | first2=H.

== Quality control ==
Despite all the automation involved in the diamond turning process, the human operator still plays the main role in achieving the final result. Quality control is a major part of the diamond turning process and is required after each stage of machining, sometimes after each pass of the cutting tool. If it is not detected immediately, even a minute error during any of the cutting stages results in a defective part. The extremely high requirements for quality of diamond-turned optics leave virtually no room for error.

The SPDT manufacturing process produces a relatively high percentage of defective parts, which must be discarded. As a result, the manufacturing costs are high compared to conventional polishing methods. Even with the relatively high volume of optical components manufactured using the SPDT process, this process cannot be classified as mass production, especially when compared with production of polished optics. Each diamond-turned optical element is manufactured on an individual basis with extensive manual labor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2443">[[File:EngelsLaw.svg|thumb|right|250px|According to Engel's law, the share of income spent on food decreases, even as total food expenditure rises]]

'''Engel's law''' is an observation in [[economics]] stating that as income rises, the proportion of income spent on food falls, even if absolute expenditure on food rises. In other words, the [[income elasticity of demand]] of food is between 0 and 1.

The law was named after the [[statistician]] [[Ernst Engel]] (1821–1896).

Engel's law does not imply that food spending remains unchanged as income increases: It suggests that consumers increase their expenditures for food products in percentage terms less than their increases in income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quote={{lang|de|... je aermer eine Familie ist, einen desto groesseren Antheil von der Gesamtausgabe muss zur Beschaffung der Nahrung aufgewendet werden ...}} |first=Ernst |last=Engel |year=1857 |pages=28–29 |title=Die Productions- und Consumtionsverhältnisse des Königreichs Sachsen |journal=Zeitschrift des statistischen Bureaus des Königlich Sächsischen Ministerium des Inneren |volume=8–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |first=C. P. |last=Timmer |first2=W. P. |last2=Falcon |first3=S. R. |last3=Pearson |title=Food policy Analysis |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=1983 |page=43 |isbn=0-8018-3072-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One application of this statistic is treating it as a reflection of the living standard of a country. As this proportion — or "Engel coefficient" — increases, the country is by nature poorer; conversely a low Engel coefficient indicates a higher standard of living.

The interaction between Engel's law, technological progress, and the process of [[structural change]] is crucial for explaining long term economic growth as suggested by [[Paolo Leon|Leon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leon |first=P. |year=1967 |title=Structural Change and Growth in Capitalism |publisher=Johns Hopkins |location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Luigi Pasinetti|Pasinetti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pasinetti |first=L |year=1981 |title=Structural Change and Economic Growth: a Theoretical essay on the dynamics of the wealth of nations |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-23607-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''entropy of fusion''' is the increase in [[entropy]] when [[melting]] a substance. This is almost always positive since the [[Entropy#Entropy as a measure of disorder|degree of disorder]] increases in the [[phase transition|transition]] from an organized [[crystal]]line [[solid]] to the disorganized structure of a [[liquid]]; the only known exception is [[helium]].{{sfn|Atkins|Jones|2008|p=236}} It is denoted as &lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{\text{fus}}&lt;/math&gt; and normally expressed in [[Joule|J]] [[mole (unit)|mol]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; [[Kelvin|K]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;

A natural process such as a [[phase transition]] will occur when the associated change in the [[Gibbs free energy]] is negative. 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta G_{\text{fus}} = \Delta H_{\text{fus}} - T \times \Delta S_{\text{fus}} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \Delta H_{\text{fus}}&lt;/math&gt; is the enthalpy or [[heat of fusion]].
Since this is a [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] equation, the symbol T refers to the absolute [[thermodynamic temperature]], measured in [[kelvin]]s (K).
 
Equilibrium occurs when the temperature is equal to the [[melting point]] &lt;math&gt;T = T_f&lt;/math&gt; so that 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta G_{\text{fus}} = \Delta H_{\text{fus}} - T_f \times \Delta S_{\text{fus}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;,

and the entropy of fusion is the heat of fusion divided by the melting point.

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{\text{fus}} = \frac {\Delta H_{\text{fus}}} {T_f}&lt;/math&gt;

==Helium==
[[Helium-3]] has a negative entropy of fusion at temperatures below 0.3 K. [[Helium-4]] also has a very slightly negative entropy of fusion below 0.8 K. This means that, at appropriate constant pressures, these substances freeze with the addition of heat.{{sfn|Ott|Boerio-Goates|2000|pp=92–93}}

'''Family Re-Union''' is an annual conference, hosted by former [[Vice President of the United States]] [[Al Gore]] and [[Tipper Gore]], in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] whose goal is to bring together families and those who work with them to talk and design better ways to strengthen family life in America. At the center of Family Re-Union is the belief that programs and guidelines should respond to the needs of families and communities, and should build on their strengths.

A '''gene co-expression network (GCN)''' is an [[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Undirected graph|undirected graph]], where each node corresponds to a [[gene]], and a pair of nodes is connected with an edge if there is a significant [[gene expression|co-expression]] relationship between them.&lt;ref name=stuart2003gene&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stuart|first1=Joshua M|last2=Segal|first2=Eran|last3=Koller|first3=Daphne|last4=Kim|first4=Stuart K|title=A gene-coexpression network for global discovery of conserved genetic modules|journal=Science|date=2003|volume=302|issue=5643|pages=249–55|doi=10.1126/science.1087447 |pmid=12934013|bibcode=2003Sci...302..249S|citeseerx=10.1.1.119.6331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having gene expression profiles of a number of genes for several samples or experimental conditions, a gene co-expression network can be constructed by looking for pairs of genes which show a similar expression pattern across samples, since the transcript levels of two co-expressed genes rise and fall together across samples. Gene co-expression networks are of biological interest since co-expressed genes are controlled by the same transcriptional regulatory program, functionally related, or members of the same pathway or protein complex.&lt;ref name=weirauch2011gene&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weirauch|first1=Matthew T|title=Gene coexpression networks for the analysis of DNA microarray data|journal=Applied Statistics for Network Biology: Methods in Systems Biology|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The direction and type of co-expression relationships are not determined in gene co-expression networks; whereas in a [[Gene regulatory network|gene regulatory network (GRN)]] a directed edge connects two genes, representing a biochemical process such as a reaction, transformation, interaction, activation or inhibition.&lt;ref name=roy2014reconstruction&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roy|first1=Swarup|last2=Bhattacharyya|first2=Dhruba K|last3=Kalita|first3=Jugal K|title=Reconstruction of gene co-expression network from microarray data using local expression patterns|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|date=2014|volume=15|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-15-s7-s10|page=S10|pmid=25079873|pmc=4110735}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to a GRN, a GCN does not attempt to infer the causality relationships between genes and in a GCN the edges represent only a correlation or dependency relationship among genes.&lt;ref name=de2010advantages&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Smet|first1=Riet|last2=Marchal|first2=Kathleen|title=Advantages and limitations of current network inference methods|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|date=2010|volume=8|issue=10|doi=10.1038/nrmicro2419|pmid=20805835|pages=717–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modules or the highly connected subgraphs in gene co-expression networks correspond to clusters of genes that have a similar function or involve in a common biological process which causes many interactions among themselves.&lt;ref name=roy2014reconstruction /&gt;

[[File:Gene co-expression vs regulation.png|thumb|right|250px|The direction of edges is overlooked in gene co-expression networks. While three genes X, Y and Z are found to be co-expressed, it is not determined whether X activates Y and Y activates Z, or Y activates X and Z, or another gene activates three of them.]]

Gene co-expression networks are usually constructed using datasets generated by high-throughput [[gene expression profiling]] technologies such as [[Microarray]] or [[RNA-Seq]].

== History ==
The concept of gene co-expression networks was first introduced by Butte and Kohane in 1999 as ''relevance networks''.&lt;ref name=butte1999unsupervised&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butte|first1=Atul J|last2=Kohane|first2=Isaac S|title=Unsupervised knowledge discovery in medical databases using relevance networks|journal=Proceedings of the AMIA Symposium|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; They gathered the measurement data of medical laboratory tests (e.g. hemoglobin level ) for a number of patients and they calculated the Pearson correlation between the results for each pair of tests and the pairs of tests which showed a correlation higher than a certain level were connected in the network (e.g. insulin level with blood sugar). Bute and Kohane used this approach later with mutual information as the co-expression measure and using gene expression data for constructing the first gene co-expression network.&lt;ref name=butte2000mutual&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butte|first1=Atul J|last2=Kohane|first2=Isaac S|title=Mutual information relevance networks: functional genomic clustering using pairwise entropy measurements|journal=Pac Symp Biocomput|date=2000|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructing gene co-expression networks==
A good number of methods have been developed for constructing gene co-expression networks. In principle, they all follow a two step approach: calculating co-expression measure, and selecting significance threshold. In the first step, a co-expression measure is selected and a similarity score is calculated for each pair of genes using this measure. Then, a threshold is determined and gene pairs which have a similarity score higher than the selected threshold are considered to have a significant co-expression relationship and are connected by an edge in the network.

[[File:Gene co-expression network construction steps.png|thumb|right|360px|The two general steps for constructing 
a gene co-expression network: calculating co-expression score (e.g. the absolute value of Pearson correlation coefficient) for each pair of genes, and selecting a significance threshold (e.g. correlation &gt; 0.8).]]

The input data for constructing a gene co-expression network is often represented as a matrix. If we have the gene expression values of ''m'' genes for ''n'' samples (conditions), the input data would be an ''m×n'' matrix, called expression matrix. For instance, in a microarray experiment the expression values of thousands of genes are measured for several samples. In first step, a similarity score (co-expression measure) is calculated between each pair of rows in expression matrix. The resulting matrix is an ''m×m'' matrix called the similarity matrix. Each element in this matrix shows how similarly the expression levels of two genes change together. In the second step, the elements in the similarity matrix which are above a certain threshold (i.e. indicate significant co-expression) are replaced by 1 and the remaining elements are replaced by 0. The resulting matrix, called the adjacency matrix, represents the graph of the constructed gene co-expression network. In this matrix, each element shows whether two genes are connected in the network (the 1 elements) or not (the 0 elements).

===Co-expression measure===
The expression values of a gene for different samples can be represented as a vector, thus calculating the co-expression measure between a pair of genes is the same as calculating the selected measure for two vectors of numbers.

[[Pearson's correlation coefficient]], [[Mutual Information]], [[Spearman's rank correlation|Spearman's rank correlation coefficient]] and [[Euclidean distance]] are the four mostly used co-expression measures for constructing gene co-expression networks. Euclidean distance measures the geometric distance between two vectors, and so considers both the direction and the magnitude of the vectors of gene expression values. Mutual information measures how much knowing the expression levels of one gene reduces the uncertainty about the expression levels of another. Pearson’s correlation coefficient measures the tendency of two vectors to increase or decrease together, giving a measure of their overall correspondence. Spearman's rank correlation is the Pearson’s correlation calculated for the ranks of gene expression values in a gene expression vector.&lt;ref name=weirauch2011gene /&gt; Several other measures such as [[partial correlation]],&lt;ref name=villa2013structure&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Villa-Vialaneix|first1=Nathalie|last2=Liaubet|first2=Laurence|last3=Laurent|first3=Thibault|last4=Cherel|first4=Pierre|last5=Gamot|first5=Adrien|last6=SanCristobal|first6=Magali|title=The structure of a gene co-expression network reveals biological functions underlying eQTLs|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2013|volume=8|issue=4|pages=60045|bibcode=2013PLoSO...860045V|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0060045|pmid=23577081|pmc=3618335}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Regression analysis|regression]],&lt;ref name=persson2005identification&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Persson|first1=Staffan|last2=Wei|first2=Hairong|last3=Milne|first3=Jennifer|last4=Page|first4=Grier P|last5=Somerville|first5=Christopher R|title=Identification of genes required for cellulose synthesis by regression analysis of public microarray data sets|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=2005|volume=102|issue=24|pages=8633–8|doi=10.1073/pnas.0503392102 |pmid=15932943|bibcode=2005PNAS..102.8633P|pmc=1142401}}&lt;/ref&gt; and combination of partial correlation and mutual information&lt;ref name=reverter2008combining&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reverter|first1=Antonio|last2=Chan|first2=Eva KF|title=Combining partial correlation and an information theory approach to the reversed engineering of gene co-expression networks|journal=Bioinformatics|date=2008|volume=24|issue=21|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btn482|pages=2491–2497|pmid=18784117}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also been used.

Each of these measures have their own advantages and disadvantages. The Euclidean distance is not appropriate when the absolute levels of functionally related genes are highly different. Furthermore, if two genes have consistently low expression levels but are otherwise randomly correlated, they might still appear close in Euclidean space.&lt;ref name=weirauch2011gene /&gt; One advantage to mutual information is that it can detect non-linear relationships; however this can turn into a disadvantage because of detecting sophisticated non-linear relationships which does not look biologically meaningful. In addition, for calculating mutual information one should estimate the distribution of the data which needs a large number of samples for a good estimate. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient is more robust to outliers, but on the other hand it is less sensitive to expression values and in datasets with small number of samples may detect many false positives.

Pearson’s correlation coefficient is the most popular co-expression measure used in constructing gene co-expression networks. The Pearson's correlation coefficient takes a value between -1 and 1 where absolute values close to 1 show strong correlation. The positive values correspond to an activation mechanism where the expression of one gene increases with the increase in the expression of its co-expressed gene and vice versa. When the expression value of one gene decreases with the increase in the expression of its co-expressed gene, it corresponds to an underlying suppression mechanism and would have a negative correlation.

There are two disadvantages for Pearson correlation measure: it can only detect linear relationships and it is sensitive to outliers. Moreover, Pearson correlation assumes that the gene expression data follow a normal distribution. Song et al.&lt;ref name=song2012comparison&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Song|first1=Lin|last2=Langfelder|first2=Peter|last3=Horvath|first3=Steve|title=Comparison of co-expression measures: mutual information, correlation, and model based indices|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|date=2012|volume=13|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-13-328|page=328|pmid=23217028|pmc=3586947}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested ''biweight midcorrelation (bicor)'' as a good alternative for Pearson’s correlation. "Bicor is a median based correlation measure, and is more robust than the Pearson correlation but often more powerful than the Spearman's correlation". Furthermore, it has been shown that "most gene pairs satisfy linear or monotonic relationships" which indicates that "mutual information networks can safely be replaced by correlation networks when it comes to measuring co-expression relationships in stationary data&lt;ref name=song2012comparison /&gt;".

===Threshold selection===
Several methods have been used for selecting a threshold in constructing gene co-expression networks. A simple thresholding method is to choose a co-expression cutoff and select relationships which their co-expression exceeds this cutoff. Another approach is to use [[Fisher z-transformation|Fisher’s Z-transformation]] which calculates a [[z-score]] for each correlation based on the number of samples. This z-score is then converted into a [[p-value]] for each correlation and a cutoff is set on the p-value. Some methods permute the data and calculate a z-score using the distribution of correlations found between genes in permuted dataset.&lt;ref name=weirauch2011gene /&gt; Some other approaches have also been used such as threshold selection based on [[clustering coefficient]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elo|first1=Laura L|last2=Järvenpää|first2=Henna|last3=Orešič|first3=Matej|last4=Lahesmaa|first4=Riitta|last5=Aittokallio|first5=Tero|title=Systematic construction of gene coexpression networks with applications to human T helper cell differentiation process|journal=Bioinformatics|date=2007|volume=23|issue=16|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btm309|pages=2096–2103|pmid=17553854}}&lt;/ref&gt; or random matrix theory.&lt;ref name=luo2007constructing&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luo|first1=Feng|last2=Yang|first2=Yunfeng|last3=Zhong|first3=Jianxin|last4=Gao|first4=Haichun|last5=Khan|first5=Latifur|last6=Thompson|first6=Dorothea K|last7=Zhou|first7=Jizhong|title=Constructing gene co-expression networks and predicting functions of unknown genes by random matrix theory|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|date=2007|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-8-299|page=299|pmid=17697349|pmc=2212665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem with p-value based methods is that the final cutoff on the p-value is chosen based on statistical routines(e.g. a p-value of 0.01 or 0.05 is considered significant), not based on a biological insight.

WGCNA is a framework for constructing and analyzing [[Weighted correlation network analysis|weighted gene co-expression networks]].&lt;ref name=zhang2005general&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Bin|last2=Horvath|first2=Steve|title=A general framework for weighted gene co-expression network analysis|journal=Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology|date=2005|volume=4|issue=1|doi=10.2202/1544-6115.1128|pmid=16646834|page=Article17|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.9599}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WGCNA method selects the threshold for constructing the network based on the scale-free topology of gene co-expression networks. This method constructs the network for several thresholds and selects the threshold which leads to a network with [[Scale-free network|scale-free]] topology. Moreover, the WGCNA method constructs a weighted network which means all possible edges appear in the network, but each edge has a weight which shows how significant is the co-expression relationship corresponding to that edge.

== Research and career ==
Einstein joined Duke University in 1989 as an assistant professor and moved to the Centre for Research on Women’s Health at [[Women's College Hospital]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 2006, Einstein established the [[University of Toronto]]’s Collaborative Graduate Program in Women's Health (now known as the Collaborative Specialization in Women's Health).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/programs/collaborative-specialization-in-womens-health/collaborative-specialization-in-womens-healthabout-us/|title=About Us|website=www.dlsph.utoronto.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.womenscollegehospital.ca/news-and-events/connect/news/wcri-provides-home-to-graduate-program-in-women%E2%80%99s-health-research|title=Women's College Hospital - WCRI Provides Home to Graduate Program in Women’s Health Research|website=www.womenscollegehospital.ca|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program is based at the [[Dalla Lana School of Public Health]], and is affiliated with the Women's College Research Institute (based at the [[Women's College Hospital]]). Einstein led the program as a Director from 2006 to 2016.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2007, Einstein edited ''Sex and the Brain'' for [[MIT Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex and the brain|last=Einstein|first=Gillian|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year=2007|isbn=9780262050876|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein's work is focussed on women's health, specifically, the anatomy of the female brain.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With 72% of Canadian Alzheimer's sufferers being represented by women, Einstein explores why brain disorders like Alzheimer's disproportionately affect women.&lt;ref name="Star_03062017"&gt;{{cite news | last = Allen | first = Kate | title = Toronto neuroscientist tackling science, sex and sexism in women’s health | url = https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/06/03/toronto-neuroscientist-tackling-science-sex-and-sexism-in-womens-health.html | work = [[Toronto Star]] | date = 3 June 2017 | access-date = 22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein's research looks at the relationship between early menopause and decreased estrogen levels, and how this may negatively affect cognition.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/50785.html|title=Why do more women develop  Alzheimer’s disease than men? - CIHR|last=Research|first=Government of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health|website=www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/estrogen-brain-dementia-1.4787320|title=Delving into the link between estrogen and dementia {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further to the differences that gender may play on the human brain, Einstein further posits that the social and cultural context that accompanies being female or male can also have a significant effect on our biology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Einstein has been outspoken on the subject of gender disparity in clinical health research. She participated in the scientific discussion that led to the [[National Institutes of Health|US National Institutes of Health]] to form policies requiring even gender distribution in cell and animal studies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 2016, Einstein was awarded the inaugural Wilfred and Joyce Posluns Chair in Women's Brain Health and Aging.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/2017/03/gillian-einstein-leads-research-in-womens-brain-health-with-inaugural-wilfred-and-joyce-posluns-chair/|title=Gillian Einstein Leads Research in Women’s Brain Health with Inaugural Wilfred and Joyce Posluns Chair|website=www.dlsph.utoronto.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This chair is supported through the Wilfred Posluns' Family Foundation, the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]], [[Alzheimer Society of Canada]], and the Ontario Brain Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/university-of-toronto-researcher-receives-the-wilfred-and-joyce-posluns-chair-in-womens-brain-health-and-aging-606522936.html|title=University of Toronto researcher receives The Wilfred and Joyce Posluns Chair in Women's Brain Health and Aging|website=www.newswire.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Graduate Women in Science''' ('''GWIS'''), formerly known as '''Sigma Delta Epsilon Graduate Women in Science (SDE-GWIS)''', is an international organization for women in [[science]], first established in 1921 at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]], United States. The organization currently has over 1,000 members and dozens of chapters spread across the United States as well as an international chapter that was established in 2013.

The organization is a non-profit [[501(c)(3)]] organization that works to connect, lead, and empower [[women in science]]. It does so through offering grants, [[award]]s, and [[scholarship|fellowship]]s; cultivating a powerful international network of women scientists; holding annual conferences and sponsoring additional [[Academic conference|meetings and symposia]]; publishing a free monthly newsletter; and promoting the participation and representation of women in science-related events. Membership is open to anyone, regardless of sex, who has at least a [[bachelor's degree]] in a scientific discipline.

The GWIS National Meeting is held annually in June and is hosted by a local chapter.

==Mission==
Building a global community to inspire, support, recognize, and empower women in science.

==History&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gwis.org/page/history|title=GWIS History - Graduate Women In Science|website=www.gwis.org|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;==

GWIS was established in 1921 at Cornell University by a group of  women pursuing graduate degrees in the sciences, interested in the status of women in scientific fields, and interested in building a social network for women in science. Initially, the organization was formally named the Sigma Delta Epsilon Graduate Women's Scientific Fraternity—SDE for short. In 1922, SDE joined forces with women at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, voting and accepting its National Constitution, thus establishing the organization as a national organization. The first National Convention was held in 1922. In 1931, GWIS established its Formal Fellowships Fund, and the First Research Fellowship was awarded in 1941 to Frances Dorris-Humm, PhD at Yale University studying experimental embryology.  In 1970, the [[Eloise Gerry]] Fellowship Fund, the first of the GWIS fellowships funded by a single individual rather than by fundraising and small membership contributions, was established.

[[File:260D.jpg|right|thumb|The Mercedes-Benz 260D.]]

Diesel engines began to be used in automobiles in the 1930s.  Mainly used for commercial applications early on, they did not gain popularity for passenger travel until their development in Europe in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/question399.htm If diesel engines are more efficient, why do most cars come with gasoline engines?]&lt;/ref&gt;  Diesel cars continue to develop into highly desired, high performance while retaining power and performance. In terms of pollution, diesel engines generally produce less carbon dioxide than gasoline-based engines but produce more nitrous oxides 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Have diesel cars been unfairly demonised for air pollution|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/11/have-diesel-cars-been-unfairly-demonised-for-air-pollution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th century==
[[Charles Chapman (engineer)|Charles Wallace Chapman]] at Perkins Engines at [[Peterborough]], England, developed an engine, the high speed diesel engine, for automobiles; previously diesel engines were too large and heavy.

Production '''diesel car history''' started in 1933&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citroen's Rosalie becomes the world's first commercially available diesel engined passenger car|url=http://www.nu-car.com/Diesel_Buyers_Guide/Diesel_Timeline.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The world's first mass-produced diesel car |url=http://www.oldengine.org/members/diesel/Misc/Ricardo.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uL1FQoM8?url=http://www.oldengine.org/members/diesel/Misc/Ricardo.htm |archivedate=2010-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Citroën]]'s [[Citroën 7U|Rosalie]], which featured a diesel engine option (the 1,766&amp;nbsp;cc 11UD engine) in the Familiale (estate or station wagon) model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cats-citroen.net/citroen/history.html#UA |title=Cats Citroën Net History |publisher=Cats-citroen.net |date=1934-05-03 |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mercedes-Benz 260 D|Mercedes-Benz 260D]] and the [[Hanomag]] Rekord were introduced in 1936.

Immediately after World War II, and throughout the 1950s and 1960s, diesel-powered cars began to gain limited popularity, particularly for commercial applications, such as ambulances, taxis, and station wagons used for delivery work.  Most were conventional in design.  Mercedes-Benz offered a continuous stream of diesel-powered taxis, beginning in 1949 with their 170D powered by the OM-636 engine. Later, in 1959 their OM-621 engine was introduced in the 180D. This 2.0&amp;nbsp;L engine produced {{convert|55|PS|kW|abbr=on}} at 4,350&amp;nbsp;rpm.  Beginning in 1959, Peugeot offered the 403D with their TMD-85 four-cylinder engine of 1.8&amp;nbsp;L and {{convert|48|PS|kW|abbr=on}}, followed in 1962 by the 404D with the same engine. In 1964, the 404D became available with the improved XD88 four-cylinder engine of 2.0&amp;nbsp;L and {{convert|60|PS|kW|abbr=on}}. Other cars available with diesel power during this era included the Austin A60 Cambridge, [[Isuzu Bellel]], Fiat 1400-A, Standard Vanguard, Borgward Hansa, and a few others.

In 1967, Peugeot introduced the world's first compact, high-speed diesel car, the Peugeot 204BD.  Its 1.3&amp;nbsp;L XL4D engine produces {{convert|46|PS|kW|abbr=on}} at 5,000&amp;nbsp;rpm. Following the 1970s oil crisis ([[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]]), Volkswagen introduced their first diesel, the [[VW Golf]], with a 1.5&amp;nbsp;L naturally aspirated indirect-injection engine which was a redesigned (dieselised) version of a gasoline engine. Mercedes-Benz tested turbodiesels in cars (e.g. by the [[Mercedes-Benz C111]] experimental and record-setting vehicles) and the first production [[turbo diesel]] cars were, in 1978, the 3.0 5-cylinder 115&amp;nbsp;hp (86&amp;nbsp;kW) [[Mercedes-Benz W116|Mercedes 300 SD]], available only in North America, and the [[Peugeot 604]].

The biggest single step forward for mass-market diesel cars came in 1982 when PSA Peugeot Citroën introduced the [[XUD]] engine in the [[Peugeot 305]], [[Peugeot 205]] and [[Talbot Horizon]]. This was the class leading automotive diesel engine until the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;"Diesel Car" (Future Publishing Limited, July edition, 1993), p.104&lt;/ref&gt; The first mass market turbo diesel was the XUD powered, 1988 [[Citroën BX]] and then the 1989 [[Peugeot 405]], they gave power and refinement approaching petrol engine standards,&lt;ref&gt;"Diesel Car" (Future Publishing Limited, August/September edition, 1998), p.19&lt;/ref&gt; with the best chassis in their class.  Diesel Car magazine said of the Citroën BX "We can think of no other car currently on sale in the UK that comes anywhere near approaching the BX Turbo's combination of performance, accommodation and economy".&lt;ref&gt;"Diesel Car" (Future Publishing Limited, August/September edition, 1998), p.22&lt;/ref&gt; These were the cars that started the diesel boom in Europe that has now hit 50% of the market in new car sales.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Diesels carried a 2.5% share of the European Community market in 1973. Following the fuel crisis, this share increased to 4.1% in 1975. This more than doubled (to 8.6%) by 1980, and by 1983 diesels represented 11% of new car sales in the [[European Union|EU]].&lt;ref name=Moniteur&gt;{{cite journal | ref = Moniteur | journal = Le Moniteur de l'Automobile | page = 20 | title = Citroën BX 19 TRD | last = Pirotte | first = Marcel | location = Brussels, Belgium | language = French | volume = 35 | number = 793 | date = 1984-04-19 | publisher = Editions Auto-Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diesel Powered Passenger Cars in North America have been steadily increasing in popularity, especially in the early-mid 2000s.  Diesels have typically only been used in trucks and commercial vehicles and buses.   Jeep had offered a Perkins Diesel option for its models in the early 1960s and Chrysler offered them as well although mainly for the European market though some have probably been retrofitted to older AMC and Chrysler models in the US, particularly as taxis.  Oldsmobile released a 350 cubic Inch (5.7 Litre) V8 diesel Engine starting in the late 1970s, most Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Chevrolet and even Cadillac divisions of General Motors, had received this engine by the 1980 model year, and continued to be sold until the engine was discontinued in 1985.  Whilst a very good idea at the time, owing to the recent 1979 energy crisis these engines had gained a terrible reputation for reliability.  Part of this had to do with the fact that, whilst the engine block itself was indeed a diesel specific design (contrary to most people's belief that it was simply a dieselised version of the famous rocket V8), GM management made significant cost saving measures by using many parts from the gas V8 counterpart which were not up to the task of diesel engine operation, specifically the number and type of head bolts used, and the lack of a water and fuel separator in the fuel line, a big issue as a lot of diesel fuel contained water and also high levels of sulfur at the time.  The engine was later revised into the DX block and most of the issues were fixed, a V6 version displacing 4.3 litres and a smaller 4.3 V8 were also offered around this time, mainly for the downsized front-wheel drive models of the mid-1980s and although they were much better in the reliability department, the damage had already been done and the North American diesel car market was severely crippled as a result, despite the best efforts by Mercedes-Benz, Audi, BMW, Peugeot, VW and others in offering their more refined and powerful diesel engines.  All of these olds designed units were non-turbocharged (or natural-aspirated) diesels.  This undoubtedly hampered them in the performance and efficiency departments, although there have been retrofits of turbochargers to Olds diesel blocks which are carried out by enthusiasts and collectors of these cars.  It isn't well proven if turbos are reliable long-term with these engines, but so far they seem to be suitable, however, what performance benefit they bring could be considered as dubious given how low their power output was to begin with.

==1990s and the present==
Diesels steadily gained in acceptance with private buyers in the 1970s and into the 1990s. Having originally been mainly marketed to commercial users such as taxi drivers, European diesel sales increased steadily and reached 17.3 per cent of the overall European market by 1992.&lt;ref name=NZCarp16&gt;{{cite journal | ref = NZC493 | journal = New Zealand Car | title = Newsline | page = 16 | volume = 7 | number = 6 | date = April 1993 | editor-last = Anderson | editor-first = Donn | location = Auckland, New Zealand | publisher = Accent Publishing Cnr | issn = 0113-0196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Audi]] enthusiasts claim that the [[Audi 100]] [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]] was the first turbo charged direct injection diesel sold in 1989, but actually it isn't true, as the [[Fiat Croma]] TD-i.d. was sold with turbo direct injection in 1987&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Technology Heritage|url=http://www.fiat.co.uk/innovations/air-technologies/fiat-technology-heritage/|accessdate=2012-03-16|work=fiat.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one year later [[Austin Rover]] [[Austin Montego|Montego]].&lt;ref name="austin-rover.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austin-rover.co.uk/index.htm?lm10storyf.htm|title=Maestro/Montego|accessdate=2008-04-08|work=austin-rover.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; What was pioneering about the Audi 100, however, was the use of electronic control of the engine, as the Fiat and Austin had Bosch mechanically controlled injection. In the writers experience the Audi 100&amp;nbsp;TDI was very troublesome and the engine code "AAT" is often known as the difficult Audi .{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The electronic control of direct injection really made a difference in terms of emissions, refinement and power. All earlier generation car direct injection diesel engines benefit greatly from the use of biodiesel fuel, which reduces emissions and greatly improves refinement without engine modifications, provided they use compatible 'Viton' type rubber in their fuel systems.

The diesel car markets are the same ones who pioneered various developments (Mercedes-Benz, [[BMW]], [[Peugeot]]/[[Citroën]], [[Fiat]], [[Alfa Romeo]], [[Volkswagen Group]]) There were also small diesel engines produced in England by British Leyland and Perkins.  For reasons of economy the petrol BMC "B" series engine was dieselised and produced in capacities of 1.5 and 1.8 litres.  Perkins produced the 4.99, 4.107 and 4.108 engines all of which were extremely reliable. Later BL produced the five main bearing "O" series engine which was extremely strong. Petrol turbo variants could make 200HP and the engine was ideal for converting to a diesel.  In fact, the 1988 Austin-Rover MDi unit (also known as the 'Perkins Prima') was developed by [[Perkins Engines]] of [[Peterborough]], who have designed and built high-speed diesels since the 1930s. It is still in production as a marine engine however in the writers opinion timing belts at sea are not a good idea. Engines that rely on timing belts are more suited to inland waterways. It is not easy to make a lightweight and powerful top class diesel engine owing to the immense pressures and heat produced within the engine. These problems were solved by VM Motori of Cento and the engines were apparently so good that Rover, Ford and Jeep bought them.  The interesting features of the engines were the tunnel-bore block and separate cylinder heads to allow for expansion. VM engines were marinised by BMW and sold as BMW stern-drive packages. Mercury Marine also used the VM engines. As they have aged in car applications, they have developed a reputation for blowing head gaskets, due to the separate cylinder head design.

In 1997, the first [[common rail]] diesel passenger car was introduced, the [[Alfa Romeo 156]].&lt;ref name="autonews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/files/07_ane_ptc/speakers.html|title=New Powertrain Technologies Conference|accessdate=2008-04-08|work=autonews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, for the very first time in the history of racing, in the legendary [[24 Hours Nürburgring]] race, a diesel-powered car was the overall winner: the BMW works team 320d, a [[BMW E36]] fitted with modern high-pressure diesel injection technology from [[Robert Bosch GmbH]]. The low fuel consumption and long range, allowing 4 hours of racing at once, made it a winner, as comparable petrol-powered cars spent more time refueling.

Chrysler put a [http://www.vmmotori.it/en/01/00/01/dettaglio.jsp?id=11 VM Motori SpA] engine in the [[Jeep Liberty#CRD in North America|Jeep Liberty]] sport utility vehicle in 2005 and 2006 to assess the American market's interest in modern high performance diesel engines.

In 2004 Honda released their first diesel engine, the N22A branded as the i-CTDI, it first featured in the Honda Accord.   The engine featured an aluminium block, DOHC chain driven valvetrain, common rail direct injection and variable geometry turbocharger.
 
In Spring 2005, Mercedes-Benz unveiled their first application of a mass-produced aluminum block diesel engine for passenger vehicles and commercial use. While aluminum is traditionally considered of inferior strength and temperature resistance to withstand diesel applications, Mercedes engineers made extensive use of CAD/CAM design to arrive at an aluminum block that would meet with Mercedes' testing and reliability standards. First use was in 2006 model-year vehicles in the E-Class sedan and ML-class and GL-class SUVs. Similar in weight ({{convert|208|kg|lb|abbr=on}}) to the five-cylinder it replaced, and considerably lighter than the in-line six-cylinder it also replaced, this 3.0L V-6 produces 165&amp;nbsp;kW (224&amp;nbsp;hp) at 3,800&amp;nbsp;rpm and max torque of 510 Nm (376&amp;nbsp;ft·lbf) at 1,600-2,800&amp;nbsp;rpm and makes use of a four-valve head. Additionally, fitment of Mercedes-Benz [[BlueTec]] system, a concert of emissions control strategies, renders this new diesel 50-state legal in the U.S. beginning in 2008 (stringent [[NOx]] limits have made U.S. passenger-car diesels unpopular or impossible in parts of the U.S. in recent years).

In 2006, the new [[Audi R10|Audi R10 TDI LMP1]] entered by [[Joest Racing]] became the first diesel-engined car to win the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. The winning car also bettered the post-1990 course configuration lap record by 1, at 380 laps. However, this fell short of the all-time distance record set in 1971 by over {{convert|200|km}}.

The [[Subaru]] car company of Japan is preparing to sell its [[station wagon]] version of their Legacy mid-size car (called the [[Subaru Outback]] in North America) with a 2.0-litre, [[boxer engine]] format opposed-four-cylinder diesel engine of {{convert|110|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} power, and {{convert|350|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}} of torque, in the [[United Kingdom]]. Sales in continental Europe started in 2008.

Since the numerous [[Diesel emissions scandal]]s of recent years the most high profile of which was the [[Volkswagen emissions scandal]] of 2015 it has been revealed that the levels of toxic emissions coming from diesel cars are higher and pose a greater risk to human health than those of vehicles powered by other means.

== Diesel engine vehicle racing ==
Although the weight and lower output of a diesel engine tend to keep them away from automotive racing applications, there are many diesels being raced in classes that call for them, mainly in [[truck]] racing and [[tractor pulling]], as well in types of racing where these drawbacks are less severe, such as [[land speed record]] racing or [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance racing]]. Even diesel-engined dragsters exist, despite the diesel's drawbacks of weight and low peak rpm, specifications central to performance in this sport. However, in 2006, the new [[Audi R10 TDI]] LMP1 entered by Joest Racing became the first diesel-engined car to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.dieselworldmag.com/content/view/62/ | title = World's First 7-Second Diesel Dragster | journal = Diesel World Magazine |date=January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historic ===
As early as 1931, [[Clessie Cummins]] installed his diesel in the Cummins "Diesel Special" race car, hitting {{convert|162|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} at Daytona and {{convert|138|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} at the [[Indianapolis 500]] race,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dieselduck.ca/library/other/prime_movers.htm |title = The Diesel engine and its development, A historical timeline |author = Martin Leduc}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[David Evans (automobile racer)|Dave Evans]] became the first driver to complete the [[Indianapolis 500]] without making a single [[pit stop]], completing the full distance on the lead lap and finishing 13th, relying on torque and fuel efficiency to overcome weight and low peak power.&lt;ref name = "roadking"&gt;{{cite web |title = Track Star, The diesel-powered Audi R10 owns every race it enters |author = Paul Abelson |publisher = Road King Magazine |url = http://www.roadking.com/story.php?id=800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, a 1925 [[Bentley]] with a [[L Gardner and Sons Ltd|Gardner]] 4LW engine was the first diesel-engine car to take part in the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] when it was driven by Lord Howard de Clifford. It was the leading British car and finished fifth overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Firsts in sport |url = http://web.ukonline.co.uk/m.gratton/Sport.htm |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202195321/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/m.gratton/Sport.htm |archivedate = 2008-12-02 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Cummins Diesel Roadster.jpg|thumb|A 1950 "Cummins Diesel Special" [[Indianapolis 500]] roadster.]]
In 1952, [[Fred Agabashian]] in a Cummins diesel won the pole at the Indianapolis 500 race with a turbocharged 6.6-liter diesel car,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Cummins History |publisher = [[Cummins]] |url = http://www.cummins.com/eu/pages/en/whoweare/cumminshistory.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; setting a record for pole position lap speed, {{convert|222.108|km/h|mi/h|3|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name = "roadking"/&gt; [[Don Cummins]] and his chief engineer [[Neve Reiners]] recognized that the low [[center of gravity]] of the [[flat engine]] configuration (designed to lie beneath the floor of a [[bus]]) plus the power advantage gained by the novel use of [[Elliott Motor|Elliott]] [[turbocharger|turbocharging]] would be a winning combination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Snowberger's Done It Again&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; 1952 Cummins Diesel Car |publisher = National Indy 500 Collector Club |author = Greg Littleton |url = http://www.ni500cc.com/chutes/win05d.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start, a slow pace lap (reportedly less than {{convert|150|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}) apparently induced what is now referred to as "[[turbo lag]]" and badly hampered the throttle response of the Cummins Diesel.  Although Agabashian found himself in eighth place before reaching the first turn, he moved up to fifth in a few laps and was running competitively (albeit well back in the field after a tire change) until the badly situated air intake of the car swallowed enough debris from the track to disable the turbocharger at lap 71; he finished 27th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Viva la diesel! |author = Gavin Foster |date=  2006-07-27 |publisher = [[Mail &amp; Guardian]] Online |url = http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=278954&amp;area=/wheels_deals/new_reviews/}} (incorrect reference to the Cummins Diesel leading laps in the race)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s and rule makers supported the concept, [[BMW]] and [[Volkswagen]] raced diesel [[touring car racing|touring cars]], with BMW winning the 1998 [[24 Hours Nürburgring]] with a [[BMW E36|320d]] against other factory-entered diesel competition of VW and about 200 normally powered cars, mainly by being able to drive very long stints. [[Alfa Romeo]] even organized a racing series with their [[Alfa Romeo 147]] 1.9 JTD models.

In 2006, a BMW 120d repeated a similar result, scoring 5th in a field of 220 cars, many of them much more powerful, a significantly stronger competition than in 1998. The VW [[Dakar Rally]] race [[Volkswagen Touareg|Touareg]] for 2005 and 2006 are powered by their own line of TDI engines in order to challenge for the first overall diesel win there.

[[Image:R10 Engine.jpg|thumb|The diesel engine of [[Audi]]'s [[2007 24 Hours of Le Mans]]-winning [[Audi R10 TDI|R10 TDI]].]]

Meanwhile, the five time [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] winner [[Audi R8 (race car)|Audi R8]] race car was replaced by the [[Audi R10 TDI]] in 2006, which is powered by a {{convert|650|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1100|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}}  V12 TDI [[common rail]] diesel engine, mated to a 5-speed gearbox, instead of the 6 used in the R8, to handle the extra torque produced. The gearbox is considered the main problem, as earlier attempts by others failed due to the lack of suitable transmissions that could stand the torque long enough.

After winning the [[12 Hours of Sebring]] in 2006 with their diesel-powered [[Audi R20 TDI|R10 TDI]], [[Audi]] obtained the overall win at the 2006 [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], too. This is the first time a sports car could compete for overall victories with diesel fuel against cars powered with regular fuel or [[methanol]] and [[bio-ethanol]]. However, the significance of this is slightly lessened by the fact that the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest|ACO]]/[[ALMS]] race rules encourage the use of alternative fuels such as diesel.

Audi again triumphed at Sebring in 2007. It had both a speed and fuel economy advantage over the entire field including the [[Porsche RS Spyder]]s, gasoline powered purpose-built race cars. Audi's diesels won again the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans, against competition coming from the [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP]] diesel powered racer.

In 2006, the [[JCB Dieselmax]] broke the diesel land speed record posting an average speed of over {{convert|328|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.  The vehicle used "two diesel engines that have a combined total of 1,500 horsepower (1120 kilowatts). Each is a 4-cylinder, 4.4-liter engine used commercially in a backhoe loader." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = New diesel land speed record: {{convert|328|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} |author = Associated Press |publisher = MSNBC |url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14486354/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = JCB car beats diesel speed record |date=  2006-08-22 |publisher = BBC |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/5273540.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 [[British Touring Car Championship|BTCC]], Jason Plato and Darren Turner are racing factory sponsored SEAT Leon TDI with some success against a variety of gasoline powered competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seatsportuk.co.uk/sport/ |title=SEAT Sport UK |publisher=SEAT Sport UK |date= |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hot Mirror 6188.jpg|thumb|A [[Tiffen]] photographic hot mirror filter]]

A '''hot mirror''' is a specialized [[dielectric mirror]], a [[dichroic filter]], often employed to protect optical systems by reflecting [[infrared light]] back into a light source, while allowing [[visible light]] to pass. Hot mirrors can be designed to be inserted into the optical system at an [[Angle of incidence (optics)|incidence angle]] varying between zero and 45 degrees, and are useful in a variety of applications where the buildup of [[waste heat]] can damage components or adversely affect spectral characteristics of the illumination source. [[Wavelength]]s reflected by an infrared hot mirror range from about 750 to 1250 [[nanometer]]s. By transmitting visible light wavelengths while reflecting infrared, hot mirrors can also serve as dichromatic [[beam splitter]]s for specialized applications in [[Microscopy#Fluorescence Microscopy|fluorescence microscopy]] or optical [[eye tracking]].

Some early digital cameras designed for visible light capture, such as the [[Kodak DCS 400 series|Associated Press NC2000]] and [[Nikon Coolpix 950]], were unusually sensitive to infrared radiation, and tended to produce colours that were contaminated with infrared. This was particularly problematic with scenes that contained strong sources of infrared, such as fires, although the effect could be moderated by inserting a photographic hot mirror filter into the imaging pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robgalbraith.com/bins/multi_page.asp?cid=7-6463-7191-7457 |title=A Look Back at the NC2000 |website=Robgalbraith.com |first=Eamon |last=Hickey |date=January 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715193313/http://www.robgalbraith.com/bins/multi_page.asp?cid=7-6463-7191-7457 |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, these cameras could be used for [[infrared photography]] by inserting a [[cold mirror]] filter into the imaging pathway, most commonly by mounting the filter on the front of the lens.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

It was a test flight of the Vostok spacecraft, carrying two dogs; [[Soviet space dogs#Pchyolka and Mushka|Pcholka and Mushka]] ("little bee" and "little fly"; affectionate diminutives of "pchela" and "mukha", respectively), as well as a television camera and scientific instruments.

Korabl-Sputnik 3 was launched at 07:30:04 UTC on 1 December 1960, atop a [[Vostok-L]] carrier rocket flying from [[Gagarin's Start|Site 1/5]] at the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]].&lt;ref name="LL"/&gt; It was successfully placed into [[low Earth orbit]]. The flight lasted one day, after which the spacecraft was deorbited ahead of its planned recovery. The deorbit burn began at 07:15 UTC on 2 December, however the engine did not cut off as planned at the end of the burn, and instead the spacecraft's fuel burned to depletion. This resulted in it reentering the atmosphere on a trajectory which might have permitted foreign powers to inspect the capsule. To prevent this, an explosive charge was detonated during reentry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/histind/sputnik6/sputnik6.html#landing|title=The flight of Sputnik-6|last=Grahn|first=Sven|website=www.svengrahn.pp.se|access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Pchyolka and Mushka were killed in the resulting disintegration.&lt;ref name="EA"/&gt; They were the last dogs to die in a Soviet space mission, after [[Laika]], who was never intended to survive her [[Sputnik 2]] flight, and Chaika and Lisichka, perishing after the rocket carrying their "Korabl Sputnik" spacecraft disintegrated 20 seconds into the flight.

Three weeks later, a follow-up launch to Korabl-Sputnik 3 also failed. On 22 December, the dogs [[Soviet space dogs#Damka and Krasavka|Damka and Krasavka]] lifted off from LC-1 using a booster with an enhanced Blok E stage which produced more thrust than the previous model. This variant (the 8K72K) would be used for manned Vostok launches. The strap-ons and core stage of the booster performed normally, but the untested new Blok E failed a few seconds after ignition when the gas generator malfunctioned. Since the engine could not produce sufficient thrust to achieve orbital velocity, the mission had to be aborted. The Vostok was ejected with the Blok E still firing and the dogs subjected to a rough ballistic reentry in freezing winter weather. Recovery crews frantically searched for the descent module before its automatic self-destruct mechanism activated, and after some hours, succeeded in disarming the mechanism and retrieving the dogs, which were returned to Baikonour Cosmodrome alive.

[[File:LatticemodelAB.png|thumb|A three-dimensional lattice filled with two molecules A and B, here shown as black and white spheres. Lattices such as this are used - for example - in the [[Flory–Huggins solution theory]]]]
In [[physics]], a '''lattice model''' is a [[Mathematical model|physical model]] that is defined on a [[lattice (group)|lattice]], as opposed to the [[continuum (theory)|continuum]] of [[space]] or [[spacetime]]. Lattice models originally occurred in the context of [[condensed matter physics]], where the [[atom]]s of a [[crystal]] automatically form a lattice. Currently, lattice models are quite popular in [[theoretical physics]], for many reasons. Some models are [[exactly solvable]], and thus offer insight into physics beyond what can be learned from [[perturbation theory]]. Lattice models are also ideal for study by the methods of [[computational physics]], as the discretization of any continuum model automatically turns it into a lattice model. Examples of lattice models in [[condensed matter physics]] include the [[Ising model]], the [[Potts model]], the [[XY model]], the [[Toda lattice]]. The exact solution to many of these models (when they are solvable) includes the presence of [[soliton]]s. Techniques for solving these include the [[inverse scattering transform]] and the method of [[Lax pair]]s, the [[Yang-Baxter equation]] and [[quantum group]]s. The solution of these models has given insights into the nature of [[phase transitions]], [[magnetization]] and [[scaling behaviour]], as well as insights into the nature of [[quantum field theory]]. Physical lattice models frequently occur as an approximation to a continuum theory, either to give an [[ultraviolet cutoff]] to the theory to prevent divergences or to perform [[numerical analysis|numerical computations]]. An example of a continuum theory that is widely studied by lattice models is the [[QCD lattice model]], a discretization of [[quantum chromodynamics]]. However, [[digital physics]] considers nature fundamentally discrete at the Planck scale, which imposes [[Talk:Bekenstein bound#Cellular automata|upper limit to the density of information]], aka [[Holographic principle#Limit on information density|Holographic principle]]. More generally, [[lattice gauge theory]] and [[lattice field theory]] are areas of study. Lattice models are also used to simulate the structure and dynamics of polymers. Examples include the [[bond fluctuation model]] and the [[2nd model]].

This is a '''list of [[Trogoniformes]] species by global population'''. While numbers are estimates, they have been made by the experts in their fields. For more information on how these estimates were ascertained, see Wikipedia's articles on [[population biology]] and [[population ecology]].

This list is not comprehensive, as not all Trogoniformes have had their numbers quantified.

{{italic title}}
'''''Little Science, Big Science''''' is a book of collected lectures given by [[Derek J. De Solla Price]], first published in 1963. The book presents the 1962 [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] Pegram Lectures, a series of lectures dedicated to discussing science and its place in society. Price's goal in the lectures is to outline what it may look like for science to be analysed scientifically, by applying methods of measuring, hypothesizing, and deriving to science itself. With this goal in mind, he sets out to define quasi-mathematically how the shape and size of science has shifted from "small science" to "big science" in a historical and sociological way. Price presents a quantification of science as a measurable entity via an analogy to thermodynamics, conceptualizing science like a gas with individual molecules possessing individual velocities and interactions, a total volume, and general properties or laws.

== Prologue to a Science of Science ==
Price begins the lectures by setting forth a demarcation in science centered around the modern period. He describes the phenomenon that, at the time of the lectures, 80 to 90 percent of important scientific work had occurred in one normal human life span.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Little Science, Big Science|last=de Solla Price|first=Derek J.|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1963|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this facet in mind, he sets out to describe the development of the term "Big Science," as coined by Alvin M. Weinberg in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weinberg|first=Alvin M.|date=|title=Impact of Large-Scale Science on the United States|url=|journal=Science|volume=134|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a general directive, he seeks to show that the transition from "Little Science" to "[[Big Science]]," specifically the socio-economic and methodological changes to science in the 20th century, have been mostly gradual. To illustrate this point, he presents empirical statistical evidence from various aspects and fields of science, all of which show that the mode of growth of science is exponential, growing at compound interest. This assertion Price claims is the "fundamental law of any analysis of science," stating that it even holds accurately over long time periods. With this fundamental law in mind, he states that for general measures the size of science in manpower or number of publications doubles in size every 10 to 15 years. If this rate of expansion is considered broadly, then from the 1600s until now such size measures of science have increased by a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this observation, Price moves to describe the "coefficient of immediacy:" the number of scientists alive compared to the number of scientists who have ever been, a ratio or percentage he states as 7:8 and 87.5% respectively. This measure serves to show numerically how the majority of important science has taken place within the average human life span at the time of the lecture presentation. As a result of the consistent exponential growth rate and immediacy of science, the statement that the majority of scientists throughout history are alive at any given moment must be consistent throughout history as well, meaning that in 1700 the majority of all scientists ever were alive, true also for 1800 and 1900 and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this facet, Price states that science has been constantly exploding into the population, increasing its size at a rate faster than the increase of total humans able to conduct it.

However, Price asserts that this exponential growth rate cannot simply explain the transition from "Little Science" to "Big Science," as the constant growth would not make the modern period under question any more likely to produce "Big Science" than any other. He conjectures that two statistical phenomena hold true for science generally, that individual metrics of science may grow at rates different from that of the exponential growth, and that the exponential growth rate may be starting to diminish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to his second point, he claims that the normal exponential growth may give way to a logistic growth rate, growing exponentially until it reaches a maximum size and then ceasing to grow. The possibility that science follows a rate of growth modeled by a logistic curve is suggested further by the fact that if science had continued to grow at an exponential rate in 1962, then by now there would be more scientists than people. With his claim that the growth rate actually observes a logistic curve, he provides a second basic law of the analysis of science, namely that the exponential growth rates previously mentioned must be in fact logistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this claim is correct, then the exponential growth rate previously observed must break down at a point in the future, and Price implies as a conclusion to this section that the onset of this breakdown may be associated with an upper bound to the size of science brought on by "Big Science."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Galton Revisited ==
In this chapter, Price suggests various ideas and methods about conducting a science of science, or [[scientometrics]], by first narrating some peculiar contributions to statistics made by [[Francis Galton]]. His overall goal is to further the possibility of applying scientific methods to science itself by suggesting various metrics and measures of the size, growth rate, and distribution of science. He focuses on Galton's work concerning the distribution of high achieving scientists and statesmen in the upper echelons of British society, specifically ''Hereditary Genius''  and ''English Men of Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; These works are reviewed with the goal of understanding a basic metric for the number of people or papers in science that reach different levels of quality, an idea basic in Price's formulation of scientometrics. Further, he suggests that understanding such a metric would allow predictions to be made of science and scientists when changes associated with Big Science arrive. Galton's original approach was to estimate the distribution of high achieving practitioners of science among the eminent parts of British society, and Price takes this as a starting step in grasping a scientific metric of the productivity of science. In analyzing Galton's work and the work of another statistics researcher, Alfred J. Lotka, Price suggests that there may be a rough inverse-square law of productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Price moves next to define a quantity he calls someone's "solidness" ''s'', as the logarithm of the total papers published in one scientist's life. Keeping in mind the previous productivity law, for each unit increase in a scientist's solidness, the total number of scientists of that solidness decreases at a constant rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these two observations, among others, Price asserts that the foundations for an econometric-like study of science have been suggested, with the analysis of time series suggesting exponential or logistic growth and the distribution law of scientific productivity comprising them. He concludes by suggesting that these distributions and analyses contain errors relating to the non-uniform distribution of scientists across populations, noting that they tend to congregate in certain fields, institutions, countries, and journals. In keeping with his gas analogy, he maintains that just as one cannot measure the exact positions and velocities of gas molecules, one cannot pinpoint the exact productivity or contribution levels of individual scientists within science.

== Invisible Colleges and the Affluent Scientific Commuter ==
This chapter serves multiple purposes but overall achieves the same goal as the previous, providing a further conception of the productivity measure in science. This conclusion is reached through defining historically, sociologically, and from a communications perspective what a scientific paper is for, specifically what the purpose of this form of scientific communication is. To begin this analysis, he begins by looking at the history of the scientific paper, tracing its original purpose to discovering what was of interest within scientific practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of this scientific social practice, seen not as a means of publishing new knowledge but of communication between practitioners, the process of situating papers within the general body of literature came in to play. Specifically, each scientific paper is built from the foundation created by all previous papers, and with this facet exists a possibility of quantifying this foundation, the citation of references.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Little Science, Big Science, and Beyond|last=de Solla Price|first=Derek J.|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=New York|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Solla Price|first=Derek|date=|title=Networks of Scientific Papers|url=|journal=Science|volume=149|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the idea that scientific papers were a social device of scientific communication, Price suggests that the driving force behind their emergent usage was the ability to assert and claim intellectual property within science. The possibility of communicating priority in disputes over scientific discoveries promoted the scientific paper as the best means of communication, leaving the information dissemination quality of papers as incidental in their overall purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|date=|title=Priorities in Scientific Discovery: a chapter in the sociology of science|url=|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=22|pages=635|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the quantification of scientific productivity by citation number and rate, there arrives a metric in science that gives the scientific importance of an individual's work or journal as its total usage within scientific practice, its total citations or references in other papers or journals. With this in mind, Price observes the fact that the total number of scientific references at a specific date across science is proportional to the total literature available within science at that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moving from the ability of scientific papers to facilitate communication and interactions between scientists, Price outlines an idea that allows further maximization of interactions between scientists. His term for this organizational method is the "invisible college," specifically the circuit of institutions, research centers, journals, and conferences that allow intermingling and interactions within specific fields of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups of scientists naturally form as a result of collaborations between individuals focusing on similar problems, but the ability for researchers to move around the globe in order to achieve interpersonal relationships with their fellow researchers is what Price suggests maximizes the group size able to keep up regular productive interactions. Thus Price defines the sociological structure of scientific practice communicating through published papers.

== Political Strategy for Big Scientists ==
The final section of the lectures focuses on a larger-picture analysis of science and the monetary trends within it. As a general first statement, Price proposes that the cost of science has been increasing proportional to the square of the number of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that the cost of research in terms of the GDP did not increase in the years preceding World War II, yet afterward began increasing at the rate previously mentioned. As research amounts increase, the current and necessary number of researchers increases, promoting the inducement of scientists with higher salaries and better facilities in turn increasing the overall costs of science. Price suggests that it is this feedback loop that is a potential decelerator for the growth of science, and the main difference between Little Science and Big Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; What follows is his analysis of the "explosion of science" within non-developed countries, specifically [[Japan]]. He shows through this analysis that the United States' lack of experience of this explosion of science within the 20th century up to this point is due to the saturation of society with the activities of science, nearing costs not maintainable by the country. In countries where science has yet reached an exponential growth curve, this saturation is not present which allows the growth rate to set out at an exponential pace.

The final conceptual measure that Price offers is the idea of the "mavericity" of a scientist, or the likelihood that an individual will test new and unique combinations of theories and experiments unexpected in the current literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reactions and interactions within science to this mavericity also characterizes Big Science over Little Science, where the former serves to limit and restrain the most maverick investigators due to collaborative work and specific directed goals for scientific research. Thus the emergence of Big Science not only influences the growth rate, connectedness, and significance of science, but also the individual facets of the scientific pursuit.

'''MARAUDER''' ('''Magnetically accelerated ring to achieve ultrahigh directed energy and radiation''') is, or was, a [[United States Air Force Research Laboratory]] project concerning the development of a coaxial [[plasma railgun]]. It is one of several [[United States Government]] efforts to develop [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]-based projectiles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plasma railgun#Examples]]&lt;/ref&gt; The first computer simulations occurred in 1990, and its first published experiment appeared on August 1, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sovinec|first1=C. R.|title=Phase 1b MARAUDER computer simulations|journal=IEEE international conference on plasma science|date=1990|volume=22|issue=16|url=https://inis.iaea.org/search/searchsinglerecord.aspx?recordsFor=SingleRecord&amp;RN=22057516}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "marauder"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dengan, et. al|first1=J.

== Objectives ==

The first MARAUDER experiment was motivated by RACE, or the Ring Accelerator Experiment, which took place in 1991 at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]].&lt;ref name = "marauder"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "RACE"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McLean|first1=H. S.|title=Ring Accelerator Experiment (RACE)|journal=Plasma Science, 1991. IEEE Conference Record - Abstracts.|date=1991|doi=10.1109/PLASMA.1991.695662}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of the MARAUDER program was to accelerate highly dense [[toroid]]s containing plasma to high speeds. Such a system could be used for “hypervelocity projectiles,” x-ray production, and electrical power amplification. The stated goals of the program included studying the “formation, compression, and acceleration of magnetized plasma rings.”&lt;ref name = "marauder"/&gt;

Specifically, the objective of the program was the acceleration of a toroid of 0.5-2.0&amp;nbsp;mg plasma to a kinetic energy level on the order of megajoules using a 5-10 MJ coaxial gun design.&lt;ref name = "marauder"/&gt;

== Design ==

In 1993, the [[Phillips Laboratory]] developed a coaxial plasma gun capable of accelerating 1–2&amp;nbsp;mg of plasma by up to 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;[[g-force|g]] in a toroid of 1 meter in diameter.&lt;ref name = "marauder"/&gt; The toroids are similar to [[spheromak]]s, but differ in that an inner conductor is used to accelerate the plasma and that confinement behavior results from interactions of the toroid with its surrounding atmosphere. It utilized the [[Shiva Star]] capacitor bank to satisfy the large energy requirements that were needed.

The plasma projectiles would be shot at a speed expected to be 3000 km/s in 1995 and 10,000 km/s (3% of the speed of light) by 2000. A shot has the energy of 5 pounds of TNT exploding. Doughnut-shaped rings of plasma and balls of lightning exploded with devastating thermal and mechanical effects when hitting their target and produced pulse of electromagnetic radiation that could scramble electronics, the energy would shower the interior of the target with high-energy x-rays that would potentially destroy the electronics inside.&lt;ref&gt;Jane's Defence Weekly 29 July 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current status ==

As of 1993 the project appeared to be in the early experimental stages. The weapon was able to produce doughnut-shaped rings of plasma and balls of lightning that exploded with devastating thermal and mechanical effects when hitting their target and produced pulse of electromagnetic radiation that could scramble electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unfriendly Fire |url=http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/163_ballsoffire.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223040553/http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/163_ballsoffire.shtml |archivedate=February 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project's initial success led to it becoming classified, and only a few references to MARAUDER appeared after 1993. No information about the fate of the project has been published after 1995.

{{italic title}}In England and Wales, the '''''Manual for Streets''''', published in March 2007, provides guidance for practitioners involved in the planning, design, provision and approval of new [[street]]s, and modifications to existing ones. It aims to increase the quality of life through good design which creates more people-oriented streets.  Although the detailed guidance in the document applies mainly to residential streets, the overall design principles apply to all streets within urban areas.

A ''street'' is defined as "a highway with important public realm functions beyond the movement of motor traffic" – i.e. by its function rather than some arbitrary traffic flow limit.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Overview ==
The [[UK]] [[Department for Transport]] (DfT) and the [[Department for Communities and Local Government]] (DCLG), with support from the [[Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment]] (CABE), commissioned [[WSP Group]], [[Transport Research Laboratory]] (TRL), [[Llewelyn Davies Yeang]] and [[Phil Jones Associates]] to develop ''Manual for Streets'' to give guidance to a range of practitioners on effective street design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manualforstreets.org.uk/ Manual for Streets website]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Manual for Streets'' was published on 29 March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Department for Communities and Local Government: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/manualforstreets/ Manual for Streets]&lt;/ref&gt;  It superseded ''[[Design Bulletin 32 – Residential Roads and Footpaths – Layout Considerations]]'' (DB32) and the companion guide ''[[Places, Streets and Movement]]'', which have now been withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;Transport Research Laboratory: [http://www.trl.co.uk/store/report_detail.asp?srid=6197 The Manual for Streets: evidence and research]&lt;/ref&gt;  A copy of the manual as well a summary and supporting research can be [http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/manforstreets/ downloaded] from the Department for Transport.

''Manual for Streets'' has updated geometric guidelines for low trafficked residential streets, examines the effect of the environment on road user behaviour, and draws on practice in other countries. Research undertaken by TRL provides the evidence base upon which the revised geometric guidelines in the ''Manual for Streets'' are based, including link widths, forward visibility, visibility splays and junction spacing.&lt;ref&gt;Department for Transport: Policy, guidance and research – Sustainable travel – [http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/manforstreets/ Manual for Streets]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Manual for Streets'' applies in England and Wales and is national guidance, not a policy document.

The Scottish Government commissioned WSP Group, Phil Jones Associates and [[Edaw]] to produce ''[[Designing Streets]]'', a version of ''Manual for Streets'' for application in Scotland and was published in 2010. Unlike ''Manual for Streets'', it is published as a "policy statement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designing Streets: A Policy Statement for Scotland|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/03/22120652/0|work=The Scottish Government|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MfS 2==
'''Manual for Streets 2:  Wider Application of the Principles''' was launched on 29 September 2010 in London. It is designed to be read alongside the original ''Manual'' rather than to supersede it. It is available to buy for £40 in paper form from its publisher, the Chartered Institution of Highways &amp; Transportation (CIHT), as well as the usual retail outlets.  CIHT staff reported at the launch that it will not be available to download for up to a year.

== Criticisms ==

''Manual for Streets'' has been criticised for its approach to [[permeability (spatial and transport planning)|permeability]] of street networks. Critics argue that, by encouraging permeability of street networks for motor vehicles, ''MfS'' undermines its declared intention to reduce the domination of streets by motor traffic. [[Sustrans]], the sustainable transport charity, while giving a cautious welcome to the ''Manual'', argues that the guidance should limit permeability for motor vehicles and provide full permeability for walking and cycling.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sustrans]]: [http://www.sustrans.org.uk/what-we-do/liveable-neighbourhoods/innovative-urban-design/manual-for-streets-sustrans-response Manual for Streets: comments on final draft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101070949/http://www.sustrans.org.uk/what-we-do/liveable-neighbourhoods/innovative-urban-design/manual-for-streets-sustrans-response |date=2011-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Melia (2008) went further, arguing:

:"By multiplying opportunities for ‘rat-running' [the approach in ''Manual for Streets'' will] increase the capacity of a road network to carry traffic – and, course (''sic'') to emit CO2.  In other words, it is a cheaper variation on the 'build our way out of congestion' theme."&lt;ref&gt;Melia, Steve: [http://www.stevemelia.co.uk/ltt.htm "Neighbourhoods Should be Made Permeable for Walking and Cycling But Not for Cars"], ''Local Transport Today'' 23 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1393">A '''matter collineation''' (sometimes '''matter symmetry''' and abbreviated to '''MC''') is a [[vector field]] that satisfies the condition,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_X T_{ab}=0&lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;T_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[energy-momentum tensor]] components. The intimate relation between geometry and physics may be highlighted here, as the vector field &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is regarded as preserving certain physical quantities along the flow lines of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, this being true for any two observers. In connection with this, it may be shown that ''every Killing vector field is a matter collineation'' (by the [[Einstein field equations]] (EFE), with or without [[cosmological constant]]). Thus, given a solution of the EFE, ''a vector field that preserves the metric necessarily preserves the corresponding energy-momentum tensor''. When the energy-momentum tensor represents a perfect fluid, every [[Killing vector field]] preserves the energy density, pressure and the fluid flow vector field. When the energy-momentum tensor represents an [[electromagnetic field]], a Killing vector field does ''not necessarily'' preserve the electric and magnetic fields.

'''Narrow-gap semiconductors''' are [[semiconducting]] materials with a [[band gap]] that is comparatively small compared to that of [[silicon]], i.e. smaller than 1.11 eV at room temperature. They are used as [[infrared detector]]s or [[thermoelectric]]s.

'''The National Watch and Clock Library''' is one of the world's pre-eminent  [[libraries]] devoted to [[horology]] and is located in [[Columbia, Pennsylvania]], United States.

It is operated by the [[National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors]] for the benefit of both the public and the members of the association. It is a sister institution to the [[National Watch and Clock Museum]].

The library is open to the public, members of whom  may use the collection on the premises, and are invited to bring their own watches and clocks if they would like to ask the staff a question for a fee. Books are only lent to members of the NAWCC. The collection is open to researchers, members or the public alike.

==The collection==
The collection covers material on timekeeping, time and timekeepers in around dozen different languages.  In addition to its book collection of about 10,000 titles (some of them dating back to the 16th century), the library has over 1,000 different videos (both [[VCR]] and [[DVD]] formats), a comprehensive collection of horological periodicals (both current and historic) from around the world, many thousands of historic catalogs of watches and clocks, as well as large quantities of archival material chronicling the history of timekeepers, including the research papers of many prominent American horological scholars of the past.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/library-research/using-the-library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/museum-exhibits/the-virtual-museum |title=NAWCC |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sister organisations==
Sister public institutions serving similar purposes include: 
* The Library of the Clockmaker's Company at [[Guildhall, London]], United Kingdom,
* The Library of the British Horological Institute, in Upton, [[Newark-on-Trent]], United Kingdom,
* The Library of the ''Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Chronometrie in Nuernberg'', in [[Nuremberg, Germany]] and

In [[Information theory]], '''outage probability''' of a [[communication channel]] is the [[probability]] that a given information rate is not supported, because of variable [[channel capacity]]. Outage probability is defined as the probability that information rate is less than the required threshold information rate. It is the probability that an outage will occur within a specified time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-026/_3785.htm|title=Definition: outage probability|website=www.its.bldrdoc.gov|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slow-fading channel==
For example, the channel capacity for slow-[[fading channel]] is ''C''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''h''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;SNR), where ''h'' is the fading coefficient and SNR is a signal to noise ratio without fading.  As ''C'' is [[random variable|random]], no constant rate is available. There may be a chance that information rate may go below to required threshold level. For slow fading channel, outage probability&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;P(''C''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''r'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;P(log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''h''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;SNR)&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''r''), where ''r'' is the required threshold information rate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30021">'''Physician supply''' refers to the number of trained [[physician]]s working in a [[health care system]] or active in the [[labour market]].&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;Dal Poz MR et al. [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241547703_eng.pdf ''Handbook on monitoring and evaluation of human resources for health.''] Geneva, World Health Organization, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The supply depends primarily on the number of graduates of [[medical school]]s in a country or jurisdiction, but also on the number who continue to practice [[medicine]] as a [[career]] path and who remain in their country of origin. The number of physicians needed in a given context depends on several different factors, including the [[demographics]] and [[epidemiology]] of the local population, the numbers and types of other [[health care provider#Practitioners and professionals|health care practitioners]] working in the system, as well as the [[health policy|policies]] and goals in place of the health care system.&lt;ref name="Models"&gt;World Health Organization. [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241599016_eng.pdf ''Models and tools for health workforce planning and projections.''] Geneva, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; If more physicians are trained than needed, then supply exceeds demand; if too few physicians are trained and retained, then some people may have difficulty accessing [[health care]] services.  A '''physician shortage''' is a situation in which there are not enough [[physicians]] to treat all [[patient]]s in need of medical care. This can be observed at the level of a given [[health care provider|health care facility]], a province/state, a country, or worldwide.

Globally, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates a shortage of 4.3 million physicians, nurses and other [[Health Human Resources|health workers]] worldwide,&lt;ref name="WHR2006"&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/whr/2006 ''The world health report 2006: working together for health.''] Geneva, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; especially in many [[developing countries]]. Developing nations often have physician shortages due to limited numbers and capacity of medical schools and because of international migration: physicians can usually earn much more money and enjoy better working conditions in other countries.  Many developed countries also report doctor shortages, especially in rural and other underserved areas. For example, shortages are being discussed in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Cauchon | first = Dennis  | title = Medical miscalculation creates doctor shortage | publisher = USATODAY.com | date = 2005-03-02 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-03-02-doctor-shortage_x.htm | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Ramirez | first = Marc  | title = Rural doctor shortage called "a crisis" in Washington | publisher = The Seattle Times | date = 2009-04-18 | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2009078934_ruraldocs18m0.html | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Halsey III | first = Ashley  | title = Primary-Care Doctor Shortage May Undermine Reform Efforts | publisher = The Washington Post | date = 2009-06-20 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/19/AR2009061903583.html | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Feasby | first = Tom  | title = Medical schools are working hard to help cure the doctor shortage  | publisher = The Globe and Mail | date = 2009-03-30 | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/medical-schools-are-working-hard-to-help-cure-the-doctor-shortage/article663115/ | accessdate = 2009-08-20 | location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several causes of the current and anticipated shortages have been suggested; however, not everyone agrees that there is a true physician shortage, at least not in the United States. On the [[Kevin Pho|KevinMD]] medical news blog, for example, it has been argued that inefficiencies introduced into the healthcare system, often driven by government initiatives, have reduced the number of patients physicians can see; by forcing physicians to spend much of their time on data entry and public health issues, these initiatives have limited the physicians' time available for direct patient care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A debate on what we need our doctors to do | publisher = KevinMD | date = 2014-05-15 | url = http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2014/05/debate-doctors.html | accessdate = 2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Determinants==

===Economic Theory and Trends===
[[Image:Merlin Darfur.jpg|thumb|Patients queue to see a doctor in South Sudan]]
Anything that changes the number of available physicians or the demand for their services affects the [[supply and demand]] balance. If the number of physicians is decreased, or the demand for their services increases, then an ''under''-supply or shortage can result. If the number of physicians increases, or demand for their services decreases, then an ''over''-supply can result.

Substitution factors can significantly affect the production of physician services and the availability of physicians to see more patients. For example, an [[accountant]] can replace some of the financial responsibilities for a physician who owns his or her own practice, allowing for more time to treat patients. Disposable supplies can substitute for labor and capital (the time and equipment needed to sterilize instruments). Sound record keeping by physicians can substitute for legal services by avoiding malpractice suits. However, the extent of substitution of physician production is limited by technical and legal factors. Technology cannot replace all skills possessed by physicians, such as surgical skill sets. Legal factors can include only allowing licensed physicians to perform surgeries, but nurses or doctors administering other surgical care.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Phelps, Health Economics (4th edition), (Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Demand of physicians is also dependent on a country's economic status. Especially in developing nations, health care spending is closely related to growth of their [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP). Theoretically, as GDP increases, the health care labor force expands and in turn, physician supply also increases.&lt;ref&gt;http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/21/1/140.full#R10&lt;/ref&gt; However, developing countries face additional challenges in retaining competent physicians to higher-income countries such as the [[United States]], [[Australia]], and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mullan|first1=Fitzhugh|title=The metrics of the physician brain drain.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=27 October 2005|volume=353|issue=17|pages=1810-8|doi=10.1056/NEJMsa050004|pmid=16251537}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emigration of physicians from lower-income and developing countries contribute to [[Brain drain]], creating issues on maintaining sufficient physician supply. However, higher-income countries can also experience an outflow of physicians who decide to return to their naturalized countries after receiving extensive education and training, without ever benefiting from their gained medical knowledge and skill set.

===Number of physicians trained===
Increasing the number of students enrolled in existing [[medical school]]s is one way to address physician shortage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Burk | first = Jennifer  | title = Medical Schools Look to Grow as Doctor Shortage Looms | publisher = Wisconsin Healthcare Workforce Development | date = 2007-05-14 | url = http://www.dwd.state.wi.us/healthcare/Archive2007/medical_schools_grow_dr_shortage_looms.htm | accessdate = 2009-08-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; or increasing the number of schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Beene  | first = Ryan  | title = Medical schools multiplying, but may not solve doctor shortage | pages =  | publisher = Bridging 96 | date = 2009-03-18 | url = http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20090318/BRIDGING96/903169989/1123 | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other factors may also play a role.

Becoming a physician requires several years of training beyond [[undergraduate education]]. Consequently, physician supply is affected by the number of students eligible for medical training. Students that do not finish earlier levels of education, including [[high school dropout]]s and those that leave university without an [[undergraduate degree]] or [[associates degree]], do not qualify for entrance to [[medical school]]. The more people that fail to complete the prerequisites, the fewer people that are eligible for training as physicians.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Murphy | first = Mike | author2 = Tim Anderson | title = Dropout rates draw attention | publisher = The Midwestern Office of The Council of State Governments | date = October 2008 | url = http://www.csgmidwest.org/memberservices/Publications/SLMW/2008/October/p1.pdf | accessdate = 2009-08-20 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091008044231/http://www.csgmidwest.org/MemberServices/Publications/SLMW/2008/October/p1.pdf | archive-date = 2009-10-08 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most countries, the number of placements for students in medical schools and [[Internship (medicine)|clinical internships]] is limited, typically according to the number of teachers and other resources, including the amount of funding provided by governments.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt; In many countries that do not charge [[tuition payments]] to prospective physicians, public funding is the only significant limitation on the number of physicians trained. In the United States, the [[American Medical Association]] says that federal funding is the most important limitation in the supply of physicians. The high cost of tuition combined with the cost of supporting oneself during medical school discourages some people from enrolling to become a physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Lee | first = Frank  | title = Experts foresee doctor shortage | publisher = sctimes.com | date = 2009-07-26 | url = http://www.sctimes.com/article/20090726/NEWS01/107260024/1009/Experts-foresee-doctor-shortage | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Limited [[scholarship]]s and financial aid to medical students may exacerbate this problem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Rogers | first = Christina  | title = Doctor shortage worsens as student debt rises | publisher = AllBusiness.com | date = 2008-06-18 | url = http://www.allbusiness.com/education-training/curricula-medical-education/12131282-1.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120716234245/http://www.allbusiness.com/education-training/curricula-medical-education/12131282-1.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-07-16 | accessdate = 2009-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while low expected pay for practicing physicians in some countries may convince some that the cost is not appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Financiar | first = Ziarul  | title = Doctors can earn over Euro 20,000 per month in private clinics | publisher = Honorary Consulate of Romania | date = 2008-01-24 | url = http://www.roconsulboston.com/Pages/InfoPages/Businesspages/DoctorPrivate08.html | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been speculated that politics and social conditions can sometimes motivate medical student placements. For example, [[racial quota]]s have been cited in some places as preventing some people from enrolling in medical school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = Shortage of young (white) male doctors  | publisher = Sunday Star Times | url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/news/179274 | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Racial discrimination]] and [[gender discrimination]], either overt or disguised, have also been cited as resulting in people being denied the opportunity to train as a physician on the basis of their race or gender.&lt;ref name="pmid18617633"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number of physicians working===
Once trained, the current supply of physicians can be affected by the number of those who continue to practice this profession. The number of working physicians can be affected by:

*The number of medical school graduates who choose to practice as a physician for their [[career]] - for example, some might choose instead to work in [[medical research]], [[public policy]] or other areas where medical expertise is required; or they may choose a job where no medical knowledge is required.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;
*The number of medical school graduates who fail to obtain (or fail to re-qualify for) their license or other [[healthcare provider requisites|professional requirements]] for legal practice.
*The number of medical school graduates who are unable to find work of their choice - for example, studies in Mexico have found high levels of unemployment among trained physicians in urban areas, even while large rural populations remain medically underserved.&lt;ref name="Nigenda"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nigenda G ''et al.'' | title = Educational and labor wastage of doctors in Mexico: towards the construction of a common methodology | url = http://www.human-resources-health.com/content/3/1/3 | journal = Human Resources for Health | year = 2005 | volume = 3| page = 3 | doi=10.1186/1478-4491-3-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The number of physicians who emigrate abroad for better economic and social conditions, also referred to as "[[Brain drain]]".
*Changes in the specialty balance - for example, in many countries, the balance is shifting away from medical students becoming [[general practitioners]] (GP) because of more attractive pay for [[medical specialist]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Another Hurdle to Health Care Reform: Too Few General Practice Doctors | publisher = Knowledge@Wharton | date = 2009-07-22 | url = http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2297 | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to shortages of physicians for [[primary care]].
*Changes in the practice environment - for example, changing legal conditions have been cited in the US, Canada and elsewhere as inciting physician attrition, notably the adoption of laws that require doctors to refer for certain procedures (such as abortion or sex change) with which the doctors disagreed on moral or religious grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Lea Singh. [http://www.mercatornet.com/articles/view/new_look_inquisitions_could_be_calling_doctors_in_for_a_little_chat/ New-look Inquisitions want to call doctors in for a little chat.] Posted Wednesday, 1 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The number of physicians who retire.
*The number of physicians who work part-time - in particular, while the number working only part-time does not affect the overall number of physicians, it does affect the supply of physician services (e.g. in terms of [[full-time equivalent]]s). Many physicians may retain their professional license while working part-time or after retiring; consequently, the reported number of active physicians is probably overstated in many jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|title= Patterns: Number of Doctors Was Overstated, Study Finds 
|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/health/research/27patt.html?ref=health
|work=[[The New York Times]]
|date=21 October 2009
|author=Rabin, Roni Caryn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demand for physician services===
The demand for physician services is influenced by the local job market (e.g. the number of [[Job (role)|job openings]] in local health care facilities), the demographics and epidemiology of the population being served, the nature of the [[health policy|health policies]] in place for health care delivery and financing in a jurisdiction, and also the international job market (e.g. increasing demand in other countries puts pressure on local competition). As of 2010, the WHO proposes a ratio of at least one primary care physician per 1000 people to sufficiently attend the basic needs of the population in a developed country.&lt;ref name="Models"/&gt;

For example, [[population ageing]] has been attributed with increased demand for physician services in many countries, as more previously young and healthy people become older with increased likelihood of a variety of [[non-communicable diseases|chronic medical conditions]] associated with ageing, such as [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]], [[hypertension]], [[osteoporosis]], and some types of [[cancer]]s and [[neurodegenerative]] diseases.

====Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (U.S.)====
In the United States, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] has expanded health insurance coverage and access to an estimated 32 million United States citizens, increasing the demand of physicians, especially [[primary care physicians]], across the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/8061.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Expanded coverage is predicted to increase the number of annual primary care visits between 15.07 million and 24.26 million by 2019. Assuming stable levels of physicians’ productivity, between 4,307 and 6,940 additional primary care physicians would be needed to accommodate this increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2011.00620.x | volume=89 | issue=1 | title=Expansion of Coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Primary Care Utilization | journal=Milbank Quarterly | pages=69–89 | author=Hofer Adam N. | pmc=3160595 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PPACA may have also affected the supply of [[Medicaid]] physicians. Incentives and higher reimbursement rates may have increased the number of physicians accepting Medicaid patients leading up to 2014. With the expansion of Medicaid and a decrease in incentives and reimbursement rates in 2014, the supply of physicians in Medicaid may drop substantially, fluctuating the supply of Medicaid physicians. A study examining variation between states in 2005 showed that average time for Medicaid reimbursements was directly correlated with Medicaid participation, and physicians in states with faster reimbursement times had a higher probability of accepting new Medicaid patients.&lt;ref&gt;http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/28/1/w17.full.pdf+html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of physician shortage==
[[Image:SOWM2010 critical shortage.svg|thumb|Nations identified with critical shortages of physicians and other health care workers]]
Physician shortages have been linked to a number of effects, including:
*Lower quantity of medical care for [[patient]]s, thereby limiting the ability of health systems to meet [[primary health care]] goals, such as the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref name="WHR2006"/&gt;
*Lower quality of medical care for patients, due to shorter doctor visits.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parents.com/family-life/fitness/mom-health/shrinking-doctors-appointment/ {{link dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increased workload and too many patients per doctor resulting in overworked and sleep-deprived doctors, thereby compromising [[patient safety]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/shortage-pushes-doctors-to-limit/2007/04/19/1176697005237.html?page=fullpage ''Shortage pushes doctors to limit''.] Posted by Jill Stark, April 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/05/070520130105.htm ''Approved Medical Resident Hours Still Resulting In Sleepy Doctors''.] Posted by ''ScienceDaily'' (May 21, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1546317/Sleepy-doctors-admit-to-mistakes.html ''"Sleepy" doctors admit to mistakes''.] Posted by Celia Hall, ''The Telegraph'', 22 Mar 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Unnecessary patient deaths while waiting for health care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/16/1661 ''Private Health Care in Canada''.] Posted by Robert Steinbrook, ''N Engl J Med'' 2006; 354:1661-1664; April 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Higher prices for practicing physicians due to less competition, by the rules of [[supply and demand]] in market-driven [[Health economics|health care economies]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?Article_ID=2671 ''America's reliance on foreign doctors''.] Posted by the National Center for Policy Analysis, December 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lower medical costs to consumers. Unlike other industries, as market share grows and competition declines, physicians are less inclined to gross up the frequency or intensity of medical services to maximize reimbursement per limited patient encounter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mgma.com ''Offshoring Physician Labor''] Posted by Layton Lang, December 12, 2011.{{full citation needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed solutions==
A number of solutions, including short-term fixes and long-term solutions, have been proposed to address physician shortages. Some have been tested and applied in national [[Health Human Resources#Health workforce policy and planning|health workforce policies and plans]], while others remain subject to ongoing debate.

*Increase the number of medical graduates through increased recruitment of minority students domestically, as well as intensified recruitment of foreign-trained graduates (also known as [[International medical graduate|International Medical Graduates]] or IMGs).&lt;ref name="pmid19416533"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lakhan SE, Laird C |title=Addressing the primary care physician shortage in an evolving medical workforce |journal=International Archives of Medicine |volume=2 |issue=14 |year=2009 |pmid=19416533 |doi=10.1186/1755-7682-2-14 |pmc=2686687 |pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increase the number of medical schools and classroom sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2009/04/doctors_from_afar_meeting_rura.html | work=The Oregonian | title=Doctors from afar meeting rural Oregon's needs | date=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*To address physician shortages in rural areas, develop, organize, and locate medical schools to increase the propensity of physicians entering rural practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenblatt|first1=RA|last2=Whitcomb|first2=ME|last3=Cullen|first3=TJ|last4=Lishner|first4=DM|last5=Hart|first5=LG|title=Which medical schools produce rural physicians?|journal=JAMA|date=September 23, 1992|volume=268|issue=12|pages=1559-65|doi=10.1001/jama.1992.03490120073031|pmid=1308662}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting medical school applicants from rural areas can also increase the proportion of rural physicians. 
*Higher medical school enrollment limits.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sctimes.com/article/20090726/NEWS01/107260024/1009/Experts-foresee-doctor-shortage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/04/business/fi-doctors4 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Lisa | last=Girion | title=Needs of Patients Outpace Doctors | date=2006-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Loosen the requirements for entry to medical school, such as eliminating the need for a pre-med bachelor's degree as required in some juridisctions, thereby making the education path more attractive for potential students.&lt;ref&gt;http://volokh.com/posts/1240839465.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reduce the costs for students to attend medical school, such as through subsidies for (free or reduced) school tuition and more financial aid.&lt;ref&gt;https://vancouversun.com/story_print.html?id=1295859&amp;sponsor=&lt;/ref&gt;
*Legislate Tuition-Increase Caps for Medical Schools&lt;ref&gt;http://policymatters.net/?p=776&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increase the role of the [[National Health Service Corps]], which help provide debt-relief opportunities for primary care physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bodenheimer|first1=Thomas|last2=Grumbach|first2=Kevin|last3=Berenson|first3=Robert A.|title=A Lifeline for Primary Care|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=25 June 2009|volume=360|issue=26|pages=2693–2696|doi=10.1056/NEJMp0902909}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Improve the political, social and economic conditions in developing countries to prevent brain drain, including fewer wars and conflicts.
*Make better use of other categories of health care professionals, including more [[Osteopathic Physician]]s (DOs), [[nurse practitioner]]s, [[physician assistant]]s, [[clinical officer]]s, [[community health worker]]s, and others.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization.

*Improve physician wages, such as through privatization of health care systems thereby enhancing market attractiveness for people to become doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.roconsulboston.com/Pages/InfoPages/Businesspages/DoctorPrivate08.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://swz.salary.com/salarywizard/layouthtmls/swzl_compresult_national_HC07000025.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/do-doctors-salaries-drive-up-health-care-costs/ | work=The New York Times | first=Catherine | last=Rampell | title=Doctors' Salaries and the Cost of Health Care | date=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Improve physicians' perspectives of their future career path, such as though reduced use of temporary [[employment contract]]s&lt;ref name="Nigenda"/&gt;
*Provide better incentives for physicians to practice in rural and medically underserved areas - for example, in the U.S., this could include expanding the [[National Health Service Corps]] for rural areas.&lt;ref name="kevinmd.com"/&gt;
*Ensure better practice conditions for physicians - for example, medical liability reforms have been cited as an important factor in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;http://sev.prnewswire.com/health-care-hospitals/20081112/CLW00412112008-1.html{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increase the use of e-mail and telephone consultations, which allow physicians to treat patients seeking more traditional forms of care.&lt;ref name="content.healthaffairs.org"&gt;http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/29/5/799.full.pdf+html&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the United States, to better accommodate the elderly and their demand for healthcare services, increase medical and nursing training in [[geriatrics]] and [[gerontology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Steven A.|title=A review of demographic and infrastructural factors and potential solutions to the physician and nursing shortage predicted to impact the growing US elderly population|journal=Journal of Public Health Management and Practice|date=2009|volume=15|issue=4|pages=352-62|doi=10.1097/PHH.0b013e31819d817d|pmid=19525780}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increase use of health care or medical teams (i.e. nurse practitioners and physician assistants) to shift physician workload and allow for increased physician times with patients.&lt;ref name="content.healthaffairs.org"/&gt;

In the US alone, the [[Association of American Medical Colleges]] (AAMC) estimates a shortage of 91,500 physicians by 2020 and up to 130,600 by the year 2025.  However, a bias would clearly exist in their estimates as expanding medical education serves the direct financial needs of the AAMC.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aamc.org/newsroom/keyissues/physician_workforce/&lt;/ref&gt; As previously mentioned, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates a shortage of 4.3 million physicians, nurses and other health workers worldwide.&lt;ref name="WHR2006"/&gt;  The WHO produced a list of countries with a “Human Resources for Health crisis”. In these countries, there are only 1.13 doctors for every 1,000 people. In the United States, there are approximately 2.5 doctors for every 1,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/doctors-table-2014-1-en/index.html;jsessionid=1l4pia740p1ww.x-oecd-live-01?contentType=%2fns%2fStatisticalPublication%2c%2fns%2fKeyTableEdition%2c%2fns%2fTable&amp;itemId=%2fcontent%2ftable%2fdoctors-table-2014-1-en&amp;mimeType=text%2fhtml&amp;containerItemId=%2fcontent%2ftable%2f20758480-table4&amp;accessItemIds=%2fcontent%2ftablecollection%2f20758480|title = Health:Key Tables from OECD|date = 2011|accessdate = Feb 4, 2015|website = OECD iLibrary|publisher = OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; One quarter of physicians practicing in the United States are from foreign countries. Thousands of foreign doctors come to practice in the United States each year&lt;ref&gt;https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/06/11/countries_without_doctors&lt;/ref&gt; while only a few hundred doctors from the United States leave to practice in foreign countries even short-term.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amednews.com/article/20090720/business/307209994/4/&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various organizations that assist United States physicians and others in serving internationally. These organizations may be filling temporary or permanent positions. Two temporary agencies are Global Medical Staffing and VISTA staffing. A [[locum]] doctor will serve in the temporary absence of another physician. These positions are typically 1-year placements but can vary by location, specialty, and other factors. Agencies that attempt to provide international aid in various ways often have a strong medical component. Some of these organizations helping to provide medical care internationally include Reach Out Worldwide (ROWW), Doctors Without Borders ([[Médecins Sans Frontières]]), [[Mercy Ships]], the US [[Peace Corps]], and [[International Medical Corps]].

Additionally, smaller non-profits that work regionally around the world have also implemented task-shifting strategies in order to increase impact. Non profits, such as [[the MINDS Foundation]] educated community health workers or teachers to perform simple medicinal tasks, thereby freeing up health professionals to focus on more pressing concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Model: Capacity Building|url=http://www.mindsfoundation.org/our-model/|website=The MINDS Foundation|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4456">In [[chemistry]] the '''reactivity–selectivity principle''' or '''RSP''' states that a more reactive [[chemical compound]] or [[reactive intermediate]] is less selective in chemical reactions. In this context selectivity represents the ratio of [[reaction rate]]s.

This principle was generally accepted until the 1970s when too many exceptions started to appear. The principle is now considered obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;''Minireview The Reactivity-Selectivity Principle: An Imperishable Myth in Organic Chemistry '' Herbert Mayr, Armin R. Ofial [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition]] Volume 45, Issue 12 , Pages 1844 - 1854 (2006) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.200503273 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic example of perceived RSP found in older organic chemistry textbooks concerns the [[free radical halogenation]] of simple [[alkane]]s. Whereas the relatively unreactive [[bromine]] reacts with 2-methylbutane predominantly to 2-bromo-2-methylbutane, the reaction with much more reactive [[chlorine]] [[regioselectivity|results in a mixture]] of all four [[regioisomer]]s.

Another example of RSP can be found in the selectivity of the reaction of certain [[carbocation]]s with [[azide]]s and [[water]]. The very stable triphenylmethyl carbocation derived from [[solvolysis]] of the corresponding [[triphenylmethyl chloride]] reacts 100 times faster with the azide anion than with water. When the carbocation is the very reactive tertiary [[adamantane]] carbocation (as judged from diminished [[reaction rate|rate]] of solvolysis) this difference is only a factor of 10.

Constant or inverse relationships are just as frequent. For example, a group of 3- and 4-substituted [[pyridine]]s in their reactivity quantified by their [[pKa]] show the same selectivity in their reactions with a group of alkylating reagents.

The reason for the early success of RSP was that the experiments involved very reactive intermediates with reactivities close to [[Diffusion-controlled reaction|kinetic diffusion control]] and as a result the more reactive intermediate appeared to react slower with the faster substrate.

General relationships between reactivity and selectivity in chemical reactions can successfully explained by [[Hammond's postulate]].

[[Image:ReactivitySelectivity.png|right|thumb|300px|Sulfur [[tetrazole]] radical derived from [[photolysis]] of [[disulfide]] and carbon radical derived from photolysis of [[t-butyl peroxide]] followed by proton abstraction from [[triethylamine]]]]When reactivity-selectivity relationships do exist they signify  different reaction modes. In one study &lt;ref&gt;''Search for High Reactivity and Low Selectivity of Radicals toward Double Bonds: The Case of a Tetrazole-Derived Thiyl Radical'' Jacques Lalevée, Xavier Allonas, and Jean Pierre Fouassier [[J. Org. Chem.]]; '''2006'''; 71(26) pp 9723 - 9727; (Article) {{DOI|10.1021/jo061793w}}&lt;/ref&gt; the reactivity of two different [[free radical]] species (A, sulfur, B carbon) towards addition to simple [[alkene]]s such as [[acrylonitrile]], [[vinyl acetate]] and [[acrylamide]] was examined.

The sulfur radical was found to be more reactive (6*10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; vs. 1*10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; [[Molar concentration|M]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and less selective (selectivity ratio 76 vs 1200) than the carbon radical. In this case the effect can be explained by extending the [[Bell–Evans–Polanyi principle]] with a factor &lt;math&gt;\delta \,&lt;/math&gt; accounting for transfer of charge from the reactants to the [[transition state]] of the reaction which can be calculated [[in silico]]:

&lt;math&gt;E_a = E_o + \alpha \Delta H_r + \beta \delta^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;E_a\,&lt;/math&gt; the [[activation energy]] and &lt;math&gt;\Delta H_r\,&lt;/math&gt; the reaction [[enthalpy]] change.  With the [[electrophile|electrophilic]] sulfur radical the charge transfer is largest with electron-rich alkenes such as acrylonitrile but the resulting reduction in activation energy (β is negative) is offset by a reduced enthalpy. With the [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]] carbon radical on the other hand both enthalpy and polar effects have the same direction thus extending the activation energy range.

'''Science.tv''' is a [[virtual community]] for people interested in [[science]].  It enables users to upload videos and categorize them according to subject matter and intended audience.

== History ==
science.tv was founded by Matt Thurling, a [[digital media]] pioneer and film-maker based in [[Bristol]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="pimm.wordpress.com"&gt;[http://pimm.wordpress.com/2007/12/29/sciencetv-joins-the-club-but-exactly-which/ Partial Immortalization, December 29, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  Research and development work began in 2005 &lt;ref&gt;[http://quernstone.com/archives/2005/11/sciencetv.html The Daily Grind, November 26, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; and the site was launched in December 2007.&lt;ref name="pimm.wordpress.com"/&gt;  Thurling writes the [http://www.science.tv/blog/blog.html science.tv blog], where he sets out the vision for the site and invites feedback and suggestions for improvements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pimm.wordpress.com/2008/01/01/sciencetv-launched-a-blog/ Partial Immortalization, January 1, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domain name ==
The .tv ("dot-tv") extension is a [[Top-level domain]] name, originally associated with the Polynesian island nation of [[Tuvalu]].  The entire domain was purchased from the islands' residents in 2000 &lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2006/12/12/technology/pluggedin_lashinsky.fortune/index.htm Adam Lashinsky, Fortune Magazine, December 12, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; and the suffix is now increasingly being used for sites featuring, or relating to, video content.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2007/12/14/channelme-carson-daly-tech-personal-cx_rr_1217channel.html Rachel Rosmarin, Forbes.com, December 17, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
A look at the [[source code]] of science.tv reveals a [[Front-end and back-end|front-end]] built with [[Cascading Style Sheets]] and [[JavaScript]].  Video is delivered using the [[Adobe Flash]] [[codec]].  The [[Front-end and back-end|back-end]] relies on a [[PHP]] interface to a [[mySQL]] [[content management system]].

== Content ==
The focus of science.tv is [[user-generated content]], and much of the content on the site is actually embedded from other video sites, including [[YouTube]].  The intended audience is broad, ranging from school students to academics and professional programme-makers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pimm.wordpress.com/2007/12/31/matt-thurling-on-the-concept-of-sciencetv/ Partial Immortalization, December 31, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5710">The '''simulated growth of plants''' is a significant task in of [[systems biology]] and  [[mathematical biology]], which seeks to reproduce [[plant morphology]] with computer software.
Electronic trees (e-trees) usually use [[L-system]]s to simulate growth. L-systems are very important in the field of [[complexity science]] and [[A-life]].
A universally accepted system for describing changes in plant morphology at the cellular or modular level has yet to be devised. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds8-2/plantsim.html|title=Simulating plant growth|accessdate=2009-10-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209022645/http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds8-2/plantsim.html|archivedate=2009-12-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most widely implemented tree-generating algorithms are described in the papers [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=218427 "Creation and Rendering of Realistic Trees"], and [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n0nacdyjpyvxnnef/ Real-Time Tree Rendering]
[[Image:Fractal weeds.jpg|thumb|300px|'Weeds', generated using an [[L-system]] in 3D.]]
The realistic modeling of plant growth is of high value to biology, but also for computer games.

==Theory + Algorithms==
A biologist, [[Aristid Lindenmayer]] (1925–1989) worked with [[yeast]] and filamentous [[fungi]] and studied the growth patterns of various types of algae, such as the blue/green bacteria [[Anabaena|''Anabaena catenula'']]. Originally the L-systems were devised to provide a formal description of the development of such simple multicellular organisms, and to illustrate the neighbourhood relationships between plant cells. Later on, this system was extended to describe higher plants and complex branching structures.
Central to L-systems, is the notion of rewriting, where the basic idea is to define complex objects by successively replacing parts of a simple object using a set of rewriting rules or productions. The rewriting can be carried out recursively. L-Systems are also closely related to [[Koch curves]].

[[Image:Fractal-plant.svg|centre|A Fractal plant]]
===Environmental interaction===
A challenge for plant simulations is to consistently integrate environmental factors, such as surrounding plants, obstructions, water and mineral availability, and lighting conditions. 
is to build virtual/environments with as many parameters as computationally feasible, thereby, not only simulating the growth of the plant, but also the environment it is growing within, and, in fact, whole ecosystems.
Changes in resource availability influence plant growth, which in turn results in a change of resource availability. Powerful models and powerful hardware will be necessary to effectively simulate these [[Recursion|recursive]] interactions of recursive structures.

In [[scientific visualization]] a '''tensor glyph''' is an object that can visualize all or most of the nine degrees of freedom, such as [[acceleration]], twist, or [[shear matrix|shear]] – of a &lt;math&gt;3 \times 3&lt;/math&gt; matrix. It is used for [[tensor field]] visualization, where a data-matrix is available at every point in the grid. "Glyphs, or icons, depict multiple data values by mapping them onto the shape, size, orientation, and surface appearance of a base geometric primitive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.utah.edu/~gk/papers/vissym04/vissym04kindlmann.pdf | title=Superquadric Tensor Glyphs | work=Joint EUROGRAPHICS – IEEE TCVG Symposium on Visualization (2004) | year=2004 | accessdate=September 1, 2012 | author=Kindlmann, Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tensor glyphs are a particular case of multivariate data [[Glyph (data visualization)|glyphs]].

There are certain types of glyphs that are commonly used:
* Ellipsoid
* Cuboid
* Cylindrical
* [[Superquadrics]]

According to Thomas Schultz and [[Gordon Kindlmann]], specific types of tensor fields "play a central role in scientific and biomedical studies as well as in image analysis
and feature-extraction methods."&lt;ref name="schultz"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~glk/sqd/schultzTVCG10SuperquadricTensorGlyphs.pdf | title=Superquadric Glyphs for Symmetric Second-Order Tensors | author=Schultz, Thomas and Gordon L.
