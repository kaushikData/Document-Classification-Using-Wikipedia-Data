      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8783">An '''API oil–water separator''' is a device designed to separate gross amounts of oil and suspended solids from the [[wastewater]] [[effluents]] of [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]], [[Petrochemical|petrochemical plants]], [[chemical plant]]s, [[Natural gas processing|natural gas processing plant]]s and other industrial oily water sources. The name is derived from the fact that such separators are designed according to standards published by the [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API).&lt;ref name=API421&gt;{{cite book|author=[[American Petroleum Institute|American Petroleum Institute (API)]]|title=Management of Water Discharges: Design and Operations of Oil-Water Separators|edition=1st|publisher=American Petroleum Institute|date=February 1990|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aqueous&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]]|edition=1st|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1967|id=[[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN]] 67019834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of the design and operation==

[[Image:API Separator.png|thumb|right|385px|A typical gravimetric API separator]]
The API separator is a gravity separation device designed using [[Stokes' law]] principles that define the rise velocity of oil droplets based on their [[density]], size and water properties. The design of the separator is based on the [[specific gravity]] difference between the oil and the wastewater because that difference is much smaller than the specific gravity difference between the suspended solids and water. Based on that design criterion, most of the suspended solids will settle to the bottom of the separator as a sediment layer, the oil will rise to top of the separator, and the wastewater will be the middle layer between the oil on top and the solids on the bottom.&lt;ref name=Aqueous/&gt; The API Design Standards, when correctly applied, make adjustments to the geometry, design and size of the separator beyond simple Stokes Law principles. This includes allowances for water flow entrance and exit turbulence losses as well as other factors.  API Specification 421 requires a minimum length to width ratio of 5:1 and minimum depth-to-width ratio of 0.3:0.5.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;”Schultz, Thomas.  “Get the Most out of API Separators.”  Chemical Engineering.  July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically in operation of API separators the oil layer, which may contain entrained water and attached suspended solids,  is continually skimmed off. This removed oily layer may be re-processing to recover valuable products, or disposed of. The heavier bottom sediment layer is removed by a chain and flight scraper (or similar device) and a sludge pump.

==Design Limitations==

API design separators, and similar gravity tanks, are not intended to be effective when any of the following conditions apply to the feed conditions: 
* Mean Oil droplets size in the feed is less than 150 micron
* Oil density is greater than 925&amp;nbsp;kg/m3
* Suspended solids are adhering to the oil meaning the 'effective' oil density is greater than 925&amp;nbsp;kg/m3
* Water temperature less than 5 °C
* There are high levels of dissolved hydrocarbons
According to Stokes' Law, heavier oils require more retention time.  In many cases where refineries have switched to heavier crude slates, the API separator’s efficiency has declined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Further Treatment of API water discharges==

Because of performance limitations the water discharged from API type separators usually requires several further processing stages before the treated water can be discharged or reused. Further water treatment is designed to remove oil droplets smaller than 150 micron, dissolved materials and hydrocarbons, heavier oils or other contaminants not removed by the API. Secondary treatment technologies include [[Dissolved air flotation|dissolved air flotation (DAF)]], Anaerobic and Aerobic biological treatment, Parallel Plate Separators, [[Hydrocyclone]], Walnut Shell Filters and Media filters.

== Alternative Technologies ==
Plate separators, or Coalescing Plate Separators are similar to API separators, in that they are based on Stokes Law principles, but include inclined plate assemblies (also known as parallel packs).&lt;ref name="Aqueous" /&gt; The underside of each parallel plate provides more surface for suspended oil droplets to coalesce into larger globules. Coalescing plate separators may not be effective in situation where water chemicals or suspended solids restrict or prevent oil droplets coalesce. In operation it is intended that sediment will slide down the topside of each parallel plate, however in many practical situations the sediment can adhere to the plates requiring periodic removal and cleaning. Such separators still depend upon the specific gravity between the suspended oil and the water. However, the parallel plates can enhance the degree of oil-water separation for oil droplets above 50 micron in size. Alternatively parallel plate separators are added to the design of API Separators and require less space than a conventional API separator to achieve a similar degree of separation.[[Image:Parallel Plate Separator.png|thumb|right|424px|A typical parallel plate separator]]

==History==

The API separator was developed by the API and the Rex Chain Belt Company (now [http://www.evoqua.com/en Evoqua]). The first API separator was installed in 1933 at the Atlantic Refining Company (ARCO) refinery in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since that time, virtually all of the refineries worldwide have installed API separators as a first primary stage of their oily wastewater treatment plants. The majority of those refineries installed the API separators using the original design based on the specific gravity difference between oil and water. However, many refineries now use plastic parallel plate packing to enhance the gravity separation.&lt;ref name=API421/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aqueous/&gt;  Today regulations often require API separators with fixed or floating covers for volatile organic compound (VOC) control.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Also, most API separators must be above ground for spill detection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Other oil–water separation applications==

There are other applications requiring oil-water separation. For example:

* [[Oily water separator (marine)|Oily water separator]]s (OWS) for separating oil from the [[Bilge|bilge water]] accumulated in ships as required by the international [[MARPOL]] Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imo.org/Conventions/mainframe.asp?topic_id=258&amp;doc_id=678 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (and later amendments)] {{webarchive |url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091014024037/http://www.imo.org/Conventions/mainframe.asp?topic_id=258&amp;doc_id=678 |date=October 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.free-marine.com/i3oilywsep.htm Oily water separator]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Oil and water separators are commonly used in [[electrical substation]]s. The [[transformer]]s found in substations use a large amount of oil for cooling purposes. Moats are constructed surrounding unenclosed substations to catch any leaked oil, but these will also catch rainwater. Oil and water separators therefore provide a quicker and easier cleanup of an oil leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonard L.Grigsby|title=The Electrical Power Engineering Handbook|publisher=CRC Press|year=2001|isbn=0-8493-8578-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Abbot's Kitchen''' is a [[mediaeval]] octagonal building that served as the [[kitchen]] at [[Glastonbury Abbey]] in [[Glastonbury]], [[Somerset]], England.&lt;ref name="tripadvisor"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.tripadvisor.com/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g186373-d218000-i30594970-Glastonbury_Abbey-Glastonbury_Somerset_England.html | title=Glastonbury Abbey Photo: The Abbot's Kitchen | website=[[TripAdvisor]] | accessdate=26 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a Grade I [[listed building]].&lt;ref name=nhle/&gt; The abbot's kitchen has been described as "one of the best preserved medieval kitchens in Europe".&lt;ref name="IoEkitchen"&gt;{{IoE|265971 |Abbot's Kitchen, Glastonbury Abbey | accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone-built construction dates from the 14th century and is one of a very few surviving mediaeval kitchens in the world.&lt;ref name="bbc13"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-23753162 | title=Glastonbury Abbey's rare medieval kitchen to be conserved | date=19 August 2013 | work=[[BBC News]] | publisher=[[BBC]] | location=UK | accessdate=26 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historically, the [[Abbot of Glastonbury]] lived well, as demonstrated by the abbot's kitchen, with four large fireplaces at its corners. The kitchen was part of the opulent abbot's house, begun under Abbot [[John de Breynton]] (1334–42). It is one of the best preserved medieval kitchens in [[Europe]] and the only substantial monastic building surviving at Glastonbury Abbey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=265971 | title=Abbot's Kitchen, Glastonbury Abbey | work=[[Images of England]] | publisher=[[English Heritage]] | first=David | last=Sanderson | date=26 June 2001 | accessdate=28 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The abbot's kitchen has been the only building at Glastonbury Abbey to survive intact. Later it was used as a [[Quaker]] meeting house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM4JP2_Abbots_Kitchen_Glastonbury_Abbey_Glastonbury_England_UK | title=Abbot's Kitchen; Glastonbury Abbey – Glastonbury, England, UK | website=Waymarking|publisher=Groundspeak | accessdate=26 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building is supported by curved buttresses on each side leading up to a [[cornice]] with grotesque [[gargoyles]].&lt;ref name=nhle&gt;{{NHLE|desc=Abbot's Kitchen, Glastonbury Abbey|num=1172820|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside are four large arched fireplaces with smoke outlets above them, with another outlet in the centre of the pyramidal roof.&lt;ref name=IoEkitchen/&gt; The building is designed so that hot air from the cooking fires would have risen up to the top of the building and escaped, whilst cooler air came from openings lower down and sunk into the kitchen, cooling it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Abbot’s Kitchen, Glastonbury Abbey|url=http://www.ssarg.org.uk/media/5af1d2748b130157ffff8010ffffffd3.pdf|publisher=South Somerset Archaeological Research Group|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Abbot's Kitchen at Glastonbury Abbey|url=http://www.prewettbizley.com/graham-bizley-blog/the-abbots-kitchen-at-glastonbury-abbey|publisher=Prewett Bizley Architects|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kitchen was attached to the {{convert|80|ft|m}} high abbot's hall, although only one small section of its wall remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Dunning | first1=Robert W. | first2=M.

It is an elaborate and age-old [[Phoenicia]]n technique for trapping and catching [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]] that was learned and taken to areas such as [[Iberia]] during Iberia's Islamic period.&lt;ref name= "almadrabachiclana"&gt;{{cite news|title=Las almadrabes y Chiclana|url=http://www.diariodecadiz.es/article/opinion/734368/las/almadrabas/y/chiclana.html|archiveurl=http://www.diariodecadiz.es/article/opinion/734368/las/almadrabas/y/chiclana.html|archivedate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique is to trap and catch the tuna when they are crossing between the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean during February to July, on their way to spawn and
until recently, on its return journey, ("al revés") when they come back into the Atlantic Ocean, they also [[Bycatch]]: [[bullet tuna]] (Auxis rochei), [[little tunny]] (Euthynnus
alletteratus), [[Atlantic bonito]] (Sarda sarda), [[bigeye tuna]] (Thunnus obesus) and [[swordfish]]
(Xiphias gladius).

It is a traditional form of tuna fishing or netting fence to catch tuna that is carried out in Italy, Morocco,
Portugal (Mainly in the Algarve) and Spain (Mainly Andalusia, Murcia and Valencia).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=almadraba almadraba] Diccionario de la lengua española, Vigésima segunda edición, Real Academia Española, 2001. {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6013">The '''American Society of Animal Science''' (ASAS) is a [[non-profit]] [[Professional body|professional organization]] for the advancement of [[livestock]], [[companion animals]], exotic animals and [[meat science]]. Founded in 1908, ASAS is headquartered in [[Champaign, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://asas.org/about-asas About ASAS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

ASAS members are involved in university research, education, and extension as well as in the feed, pharmaceutical, and other animal-related industries. Disciplines include nutrition, reproductive physiology, genetics, and behavior of food-producing animals and processing of meat-based products, including [[beef]], [[pork]], and [[veal]].

'''Official ASAS Mission:''' "The American Society of Animal Science is a membership society that supports the careers of scientists and animal producers in the United States and internationally. The American Society of Animal Science fosters the discovery, sharing and application of scientific knowledge concerning the responsible use of animals to enhance human life and well-being."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

== History ==

Organizing ASAS (originally called the American Society of Animal Nutrition) began on July 28, 1908, at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.  A committee of animal nutritionists decided to present a plan for the new society during the International Livestock Exposition in Chicago that fall. When the society first officially gathered on November 26, 1908, 33 charter members represented 17 state experiment stations, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Canada. The goals of the new society were: "(1) to improve the quality of investigation in animal nutrition, (2) to promote more systematic and better correlated study of feeding problems, and (3) to facilitate personal interaction between investigators in this field." &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; During the first year, the society had 100 members join.

At the society business meeting in 1912, the members made plans to broaden the membership base. On November 30, 1915, members changed the society name from the American Society of Animal Nutrition to the American Society of Animal Production. Members passed an amendment to the constitution to include members interested in teaching, breeding, and management investigations as well as nutritionists.

By the 50th anniversary year of the society, in 1958, there were 1829 members. A second name change was approved in 1961, when the official name became the American Society of Animal Science.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In 2008, ASAS celebrated its centennial. As of 2012, the society has more than 5,000 members. Members include animal scientists in academia, the animal industry, and state and federal agencies.

'''Architectural technology''', or '''building technology''', is the application of technology to the design of buildings. It is a component of [[architecture]] and [[building engineering]] and is sometimes viewed as a distinct discipline or sub-category. New materials and technologies generated new design challenges and construction methods throughout the evolution of building, especially since the advent of industrialisation in the 19th century. Architectural technology is related to the different elements of a building and their interactions, and is closely aligned with advances in [[building science]].

Architectural technology can be summarised as the "technical design and expertise used in the application and integration of construction technologies in the building design process."&lt;ref&gt; BSc (Architectural Technology) Level 8 - Dublin Institute of Technology&lt;/ref&gt; or as "The ability to analyse, synthesise and evaluate building design factors in order to produce efficient and effective technical design solutions which satisfy performance, production and procurement criteria."&lt;ref&gt;Architectural Technology BSc (Hons), School of the Built and Natural Environment, Ellison Building, Newcastle City Campus&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Many specialists and professionals, consider [[Vitruvius]]'s theories as the foundations of architectural technology. Vitruvius's attempt to classify building types, styles, materials and construction methods&lt;ref&gt;"[[s:Ten Books on Architecture|The Ten Books on Architecture]]", Translated by Morris Hicky Morgan, Ph.D., LL.D., Cambridge, Harvard University Press, London: Humphrey Milford, Oxford University Press, 1914&lt;/ref&gt; influenced the creation of many disciplines such as [[civil engineering]], [[structural engineering]], architectural technology and other practices which, now and since the 19th century, form a conceptual framework for architectural design.

In his published research, Stephen Emmitt explains that in our modern society, "The relationship between building technology and design can be traced back to the Enlightenment and the industrial revolution, a period when advances in technology and science were seen as the way forward, and times of solid faith in progress... As technologies multiply in number and complexity the building profession started to fragment".&lt;ref&gt;Extract from: "Architectural Technology: Research and Practice", by Stephen Emmitt, published in May 2013 in the UK by Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|978-1-118-29206-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice of architectural technology==
Architectural technology is a discipline that spans architecture, building science and engineering. It is practiced by [[architect]]s, [[architectural technologist]]s, [[structural engineer]]s, [[Architectural engineering|architectural / building engineers]] and others who develop the design / concept into a buildable reality. Specialist manufacturers who develop products used to construct buildings, are also involved in the discipline.

[[Paul Nuttall]] director at [[Arup Group|ARUP]] compares the role of the building engineer to the role of the technical architect and architect. The practice of architectural technology cannot be limited to technology itself; it also relates to the space, the building, the light, the environment served and created by the design. The professional in charge of the technical design leads specialist engineers to provide the best technical and engineered solutions for the project.&lt;ref&gt;Breakfast with Arup: Tuesday 11 December 2012, Paul Nuttall, Director, Building Engineering London, Arup In this talk, Paul Nuttall shares his insights on designing buildings in the 21st Century. The video is widely available on youtube and other websites.&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, architectural technology is developed, understood and integrated into a building by producing [[architectural drawing]]s and [[Scheduling (production processes)|schedules]]. Computer technology is now used on all but the simplest building types: in the twentieth century the use of [[computer aided design]] (CAD) became mainstream, allowing for highly accurate drawings that can be shared electronically, so that for example the architectural plans can be used as the basis for designing electrical and air handling services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ciat.org.uk/about-us/what-is-a-chartered-architectural-technologist.html What is a Chartered Architectural Technologist ?]&lt;/ref&gt; As the design develops, that information can be shared with the whole [[design team]]. That process is currently taken to a logical conclusion with the widespread use of [[Building Information Modeling]] (BIM), which uses a [[3D modeling|three dimensional model]] of the building, created with input from all the disciplines to build up an integrated design.

Architectural technology is informed by both practical constraints, and [[Building code|building regulations]], as well as standards relating to safety, environmental performance, fire resistance, etc.

==Building materials==
Until the twentieth century, the materials used for building were limited to brick, stone, timber and steel to form structures, slate and tiles for roof coverings, lead and sometimes copper for waterproofing details and decorative roofing effects. The Romans used concrete, but it was virtually unknown as a building material until the invention of reinforced concrete in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blconcrete.htm The History of Concrete and Cement]. Inventors.about.com (2012-04-09). Retrieved on 2013-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern construction is much more complex, with walls, floors and roofs all built up from many elements to include structure, insulation and waterproofing often as separate layers or elements.

[[File:Arri Alexa camera.jpg|thumb|Arri Alexa camera]]

The '''Arri Alexa''' (stylised as '''ΛLEXΛ''') is a [[Digital cinematography|digital motion picture camera]] system made by [[Arri]] first introduced in April 2010. The camera was Arri's first major transition into [[digital cinematography]] after smaller previous efforts such as the [[Arriflex D-20]] and [[Arriflex D-21|D-21]]. 

Alexa cameras are designed for use in high budget feature films, television shows, and commercials, and compete with [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|Red Digital Cinema's]] line of high end cameras such as the [[Epic Dragon]] and [[Weapon Dragon]]. Alexa uses the ALEV series of image sensors manufactured by [[ON Semiconductor]].&lt;ref name="ON Semi"&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Steadicam Operator John Fry with Master Steadicam &amp; Arri Alexa camera.jpg|thumb|Arri Alexa camera being used with Master [[Steadicam]].]]
The camera has several methods of recording, including [[SxS|SxS cards]], CFast 2.0 cards and SXR Capture Drives at resolutions up to 2880 x 2160 pixels in either Rec. 709 or Log-C to [[ProRes 422|ProRes]] or [[Arri Alexa#ArriRaw|ARRIRAW]] codecs. Alexa camera owners can purchase additional [[software licenses]] that will unlock different capabilities of the Alexa Camera including High Speed 120fps recording, DNxHD codec and 4:3 "Open Gate" Mode for [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic lenses]].

It features modularity, [[PL mount]] lenses, a [[Super 35]] sized [[Active pixel sensor|CMOS sensor]] shooting up to 2880×2160 resolution and supports [[uncompressed video]] or proprietary [[Raw image format|raw]] (ARRIRAW) data.&lt;ref name="eg"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The price of the camera depends on model and accessories; as an example, in 2015 an Arri Alexa XT cost approximately $66,000-100,000, depending on accessories included.&lt;ref name="4k-review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://4k.com/camera/a-review-of-the-arri-alexa-xt-4k-production-camera/ |title=A Review of the ARRI Alexa XT professional production camera |website=4k.com |quote=The basic camera package will cost you about $66,575. And with accessories, this price can easily reach $100,000 with the addition of XR drives, remotes, licenses, cables and add-on hardware.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model range==
The range of Alexa models has expanded over time:

===Alexa===
The first camera of the Alexa product family. The ARRI ALEXA’s CMOS Super-35mm sensor is rated at 2.8K and ISO 800. That sensitivity allows the camera to see a full seven stops of over exposure and another seven stops of underexposure. To take advantage of this, ARRI offers both industry-standard REC709 HD video output as well as the Log-C mode that shows the entire range of the chip’s sensitivity, allowing for an extreme range of color correction options in post.

===Alexa Plus===
The ALEXA Plus added integrated wireless remote control, the ARRI Lens Data System (LDS), additional outputs, lens synchronization for 3D, and built-in position and motion sensors.

===Alexa Plus 4:3===
The ALEXA Plus added integrated wireless remote control, the ARRI Lens Data System (LDS), additional outputs, lens synchronization for 3D, and built-in position and motion sensors and a 4:3 sensor making it ideal for anamorphic cinematography.

===Alexa M===
The Alexa M had its imaging and processing unit broken down in two parts to be small, compact and lightweight for 3D rigs and other uses where size is a concern.

===Alexa Studio===
The Alexa Studio features an optical viewfinder, mechanical shutter, and a 4:3 sensor for anamorphic cinematography.

===Alexa XT===
In February 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arri.com/camera/digital_cameras/news.html?article=1170&amp;cHash=07cf43b97aaa2808fcde2511e1487066 |title=ARRI Group: News |publisher=Arri.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the range was renewed as Alexa XT (XT standing for extended technology). This range is upgraded versions of the original Alexa cameras, which are equipped with a so-called XR module, which replaces the SxS module on the cameras, and allows direct raw recording without the need for an external recorder. This module records on dedicated SSD drives. Further improvements are an internal ND filter unit, a 4:3 sensor and a quieter cooling fan. The range accordingly comprises the Alexa, the Alexa XT, the Alexa XT M, the Alexa XT Plus, the Alexa XT Studio, and the Alexa Fiber Remote. Existing cameras can be upgraded with the XR module for internal raw recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arri.com/camera/digital_cameras/cameras.html |title=ARRI Group: Cameras |publisher=Arri.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209052625/http://www.arri.com/camera/digital_cameras/cameras.html |archivedate=9 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alexa 65===
On 21 September 2014 at the [[Cinec]] convention in Munich, Arri announced the Alexa 65,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Renée|first1=V|title=Rumor No More: ARRI Reveals Their 6K 65mm Cinema Camera, the ALEXA 65|url=http://nofilmschool.com/2014/09/arri-reveals-6k-65mm-cinema-camera-alexa-65|website=No Film School|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 6k 65mm digital cinema camera. As with cameras from competitor [[Panavision]], the Alexa 65 camera was available by rental only, provided through the ARRI Rental Group.&lt;ref name="arrirental65"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://arrirentalgroup.com/alexa65/ | title=ARRI Rental - ALEXA 65 | publisher=ARRI Rental | accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alexa 65 uses the A3X sensor, which has a maximum recordable resolution of 6560x3100.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arrirentalgroup.com/alexa65/ ARRI Rental | ALEXA 65]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wolfcrow-alexa65"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wolfcrow.com/blog/thoughts-on-the-arri-alexa-65-65mm-6k-camera/ | title=Thoughts on the Arri ALEXA 65 65mm 6K Camera | publisher=Wolfcrow.com | date=26 September 2014 | accessdate=30 August 2016 | author=Sudhakaran, Sareesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first production to use the camera was ''[[Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation]]'', which was used to shoot the underwater sequence, and around forty percent of ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/rogue-one-revenant-help-bolster-851170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1663202/technical?ref_=tt_ql_dt_7&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, [[Marvel Studios]] announced that ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' and [[Untitled Avengers film|its untitled sequel]] will be shot entirely with the brand new camera, marking the first time a narrative feature film was shot entirely with a customized version of Alexa 65 camera, Alexa IMAX.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/marvels-avengers-infinity-war-be-794031&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alexa Mini===
On 24 February 2015, Arri announced the Alexa Mini. It has the same sensor as the other Alexa cameras. It features in-camera recording to CFast 2.0 cards, 200 FPS and 4K UHD in-camera [[Video scaler|upscaling]].

===Alexa SXT===
On 18 March 2015, Arri announced the SXT line of Arri Alexa cameras which will support in-camera upscaling of [[Apple ProRes]] to 4K resolution and [[Rec. 2020]] color space.&lt;ref name=ArriSXTMarch2015TVTechnology&gt;{{cite news |title=Arri Rolls Out Alexa With 4K ProRes Recording |publisher=TVTechnology |url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/arri-rolls-out-alexa-with-k-prores-recording-/275065 |author=Deborah D. McAdams |date=2015-03-18 |accessdate=2015-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ArriSXTMarch2015Arri&gt;{{cite news |title=ALEXA SXT |publisher=Arri |url=http://www.arri.com/camera/alexa/cameras/camera_details/alexa-sxt/subsection/sxt_features/ |accessdate=2015-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arri also announced the SXR module which can upgrade XT, XT Plus, and XT Studio cameras with the SXT features.&lt;ref name=ArriSXTMarch2015TVTechnology/&gt;&lt;ref name=ArriSXTMarch2015Arri/&gt;

===Alexa LF===
On 2 February 2018, Arri announced the Alexa LF at the BSC Expo. It's a true 4K Large Format Camera. The ALEXA LF’s A2X sensor is based on two vertical ALEV-III sensors, which are stitched together to create a seamless large format image. This is the same principle of how they created the ALEXA 65, which uses three Alexa sensors that are arranged vertically. The ALEXA LF can record in Open Gate in a resolution of 4448 x 3096.

==Sensor information==
[[File:Arri Alexa.png|thumb|Arri Alexa being used on the set of ''[[Law &amp; Order: SVU]]'']]
The Alexa's ALEV III image sensor has 3392×2200 [[effective pixels]] used for generating an image, 2880×2160 pixels are generally used for recording on the Alexa Studio and M in 4:3 mode, and 2880×1620 pixels are used for recording on the regular Alexa and other models in 16:9 mode, the rest of the sensor is used for lookaround in the viewfinder. Alternately the full sensor resolution may be employed in 'Open Gate' mode for resolution demanding situations.

[[File:ARRI Alexa-Plus Digital Cinema Camera.jpg|thumb|Director [[Robert Tur]] with an Alexa-Plus camera equipped with an 18 mm Master Prime lens on the set of SIS.]]

The Alexa 65 uses the A3X sensor, which has a 54.12 mm x 25.59 mm active imaging area. It provides up to 6560x3102 'Open Gate' maximum recordable resolution.&lt;ref name="wolfcrow-alexa65" /&gt;

==Recording media==
The Arri Alexa can record to 1920×1080 ProRes 422 or ProRes 4444 on [[SxS]] Cards or 2880×1620 ARRIRAW to external recording devices. The Arri Alexa Firmware 7 increases the resolution on the SxS cards to 2k  ProRes 4444 (previously 1080p)

==ArriRaw==
ArriRaw is a [[Raw image format|raw]] codec similar to [[CinemaDNG]] that contains unaltered [[Bayer sensor]] information, the data stream from the camera can be recorded via T-link with certified recorders like those from [[Codex Digital]] or Cineflow.

The ArriRaw format (along with the other recordable formats) contains static and dynamic metadata. These are stored in the header of the file and can be extracted with the free web tool metavisor&lt;ref&gt;[http://opendci.com/app/metavisor metavisor - Free browser viewer for Arri Raw metadata] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618141829/http://opendci.com/app/metavisor |date=18 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or with the application Meta Extract provided by Arri. Of particular importance for visual effects are the lens metadata, which are stored only when Arri's lens data system (LDS) is supported by the lens used.

==Reception==
According to cinematographer [[Roger Deakins]], the Alexa's [[Lightness|tonal range]], [[color space]] and latitude exceed the capabilities of film. "This camera has brought us to a point where digital is simply better", says Deakins.&lt;ref name="theasc.com"&gt;[http://www.theasc.com/ac_magazine/November2011/InTime/page1.php American Cinematographer: Time Bandit]. The ASC. Retrieved 7 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Deakins used the camera to shoot the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Skyfall]]'', ''[[Unbroken (film)|Unbroken]]'', ''[[Sicario (2015 film)|Sicario]]'', ''[[Prisoners (2013 film)|Prisoners]]'' and the [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]] winner ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]''.

Due to the camera's simplicity of use and high image quality, several network television shows have been shot with the Alexa.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.arri.com/camera/alexa/credits/&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its introduction, five movies shot on Alexa (''[[Argo (2012 film)|Argo]]'', ''[[Birdman (film)|Birdman]]'', ''[[Spotlight (film)|Spotlight]]'', ''[[Moonlight (2016 film)|Moonlight]]'', and ''[[The Shape of Water]]'') won an [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. Also, movies shot on Alexa won [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]] six times, including five in a row between 2011 and 2015, for ''[[Hugo (film)|Hugo]]'', ''[[Life of Pi (film)|Life of Pi]]'', ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'', ''[[Birdman (film)|Birdman]]'', ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'', and ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]''.

'''Audioprosthology (ACA)''' is a term used to refer to the profession of the fitting of a [[hearing aid]], or auditory [[prosthesis]]. An audioprosthologist is defined as “an aid-fitting specialist who has completed a course in audioprosthology.”&lt;ref&gt;James H Delk, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7AYrbVl0zgsC&amp;pg=PP10&amp;lpg=PP10&amp;dq=james+delk+dictionary+of+audiology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C9Hdv9ul_3&amp;sig=K6f7CL6dkR7WSJ7YarBTIfG96SA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yTFoTc_2IIOcsQOAp82mBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=james%20delk%20dictionary%20of%20audiology&amp;f=false Comprehensive dictionary of audiology]&lt;/ref&gt; This term was adopted by a group of hearing instrument specialists and an organization named the [[International Hearing Society]] (IHS) in 1976.

==Definition ==
The roots of the term make its definition self-explanatory: [[sound|audio]] for hearing, [[prosthetic]] for device, and [[-logy|ology]] for science.  “Audio” as used in both “[[audiology]]” and “audioprosthology,” is clearly a derivation from the Latin term “audire,” which means “to hear,” and is commonly used in numerous other English words that are related in varying ways to hearing and sound. Audioprosthology was originally formed by the [[International Hearing Society|International Hearing Society (IHS)]].

Audioprosthologists and Hearing Instrument Specialists provide services and testing for hearing aids and hearing loss. Not to be confused with Audiologists, hearing instrument specialists' primary purpose is to test and properly fit a hearing device. All are required from each individual state to pass certain requirements and regulations, most of which the same practical exam must be taken by Audioprosthologists, Audiologists and Hearing Instrument Specialists. Only Doctors of Audiology can diagnose but still cannot prescribe any type of medication because their Doctorate is not a medical degree.Audiologist in most states have at minimum a Doctorate degree which is clinical. The Doctorate degree is 4 years post a bachelor's degree as well as at least 3 rotations as well as one year clinical training. Audiologist gave training in cochlear implants, intraoperative monitoring, hearing aids, as well as vestibular and balance disorders. Audiologist can also work in private practice, hospitals or doctors offices. There is a vast difference between a hearing aid dispenser and Audiologist.

== Origins ==
Founded in 1976 by [[Harold Williams (physician)|Harold Williams]], EdD, and Robert Briskey, the ACA program was developed in response to a need for advanced training for hearing instrument specialists. The name was believed to be an accurate description of the course of study – the application of [[prostheses]], that is [[hearing aids]], to ameliorate [[Hearing (sense)|auditory]] impairments. The first graduates of the program in 1978 realized the benefits of the coursework immediately and recommended that the ACA program be offered nationwide.
In 1993 the International Hearing Society &lt;ref&gt;[http://ihsinfo.org International Hearing Society]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827231320/http://ihsinfo.org/ |date=August 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (IHS) assumed control of the curriculum and applied to the [[American Council on Education]] (ACE) for an assessment of the program’s university credit equivalence. ACE determined that completion of the ACA course of study was the equivalent of 15 upper level [[bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] semester credits. That equivalency meant that colleges and universities that recognized the ACE credit-equivalence paradigm would accept those 15 credits toward an [[undergraduate degree]]. The ACA program was launched at sites across the U.S. and continues to be offered today.

Hearing aid specialists have typically learned their profession through an apprenticeship in that they’re trained and supervised by another licensed individual. When qualified they take their state’s examination, and upon passing, they’re granted a license to practice. This apprenticeship provides them with the skill set necessary for entry level, safe practice. The original intent of the ACA Program was to provide current practitioners with the scientific foundation for their vocation, thus taking them to an advanced practice designation through formal coursework, laboratory exercises, and summative examinations.

== Purpose ==
The ACA Program is an opportunity for adult learners to supplement their skill set with the knowledge and theoretical background that could move them to a higher level of proficiency and professionalism, that is, to an advanced practice status. The use of the term audioprosthologist is a privilege of successful completion of the course of study. An individual must complete and pass a 13-month course and a subsequent practicum prior to being granted this privilege.

The intent of the American Council on Education (ACE) process was to provide an opportunity for practitioners to gain access to a college degree through lifelong learning and workplace skills. The ACA Program has been determined to be equivalent to 15 semester hours of upper level baccalaureate credit by the ACE College Credit Recommendation Service. ACE will only evaluate courses of study that are comparable to the learning offered at the college level in terms of course content, learning methods, and assessment procedures. Over 1800 academic institutions accept the ACE credit recommendations. In the field of hearing instrument sciences, [[Spokane Falls Community College]] has provided advanced standing for ACA graduates, have accepted all ACA credits, and have granted an automatic one-third fulfillment toward the requirements for the two-year associate degree in hearing instrument sciences.

The ACA Program embraces the concept that working adults should have access to academic credit for formal courses and examinations taken outside traditional degree programs with 100% relevance to their chosen careers. Institutions of higher learning embrace these non-traditional approaches because they facilitate adult learners in earning undergraduate degrees. The ACA Program has been embraced by hearing instrument specialists because it provides an opportunity for them to achieve an advanced practice status, and a few have gone on to use this experience for college credit.

==Course of Study==
The ACA educational program contains five courses structured to conform to a semester-hour format common to universities. Each of the five courses is held over three two-day sessions (weekends) for a total of 42 classroom hours per course. The core faculty consists of individuals with extensive knowledge and experience in the academic and/or business world. It is the core faculty’s responsibility to teach the courses in the ACA program, evaluate student performance and attainment of learning objectives, make suggestions about additional faculty, periodically review curriculum, and make recommendations for curriculum revisions in light of new knowledge, methodologies, and advancements in hearing aid engineering.

Students are required to attend all classes and complete all class assignments with a grade of 70% or better. Failure requires that the course be repeated. Official transcripts are available to each student who completes the ACA through the ACE Transcript Services &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acetranscription.com/ ACE Transcript Services]&lt;/ref&gt; in Washington, DC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6339">A '''Basic Utility Vehicle (BUV)''' is a simple rugged vehicle designed for use in the developing world. A slew of such vehicles were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s; most only reached limited production and market penetration as used Western vehicles often proved cheaper. In Southeast Asia, these are often referred to as "AUVs", or "Asian Utility Vehicles". They have also been called "Basic Transportation Vehicles" ('''BTV'''). The [[Institute for Affordable Transportation]] (IAT) currently holds annual competitions aimed at developing new such vehicles.

==1960s==
[[File:Farmobil left.jpg|thumb|Farmobil]]
Greek financier Peter Kondorgouris began producing a small utility vehicle called the [[Farmobil]], based on a 1957 design by Wilfried Fahr of Switzerland. Using [[BMW]] engines, about 1000 were built between 1962 and 1966. The Farco company was taken over by Chrysler in the mid-sixties and they took over distribution in many markets.

==1970s==
[[File:Citroen Yagan 1974.jpg|thumb|left|Chile's Citroën Yagán, a version of the [[Citroën FAF|Baby Brousse]]]]
Basic utility vehicles were developed by [[Ford Motor Company Philippines|Ford]] and [[Bedford HA#BTV|GM]] specifically for sale in East Asia, with the intent of opening new markets there and in Africa.&lt;ref name=zaCAR1172&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine = CAR (South Africa) | title = Volkswagenwerk plans new cars and engines | last = Wilkins | first = Gordon | volume = 16 | number = 11 | date = December 1972 | ref = DNLCV | page = 11 | publisher = Ramsay, Son &amp; Parker (Pty) Ltd. | location = Cape Town, South Africa }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Volkswagen]] also developed a vehicle, the [[Volkswagen EA489 Basistransporter|EA489 Basistransporter]] which was built from 1975 until 1979. Dutch [[DAF Trucks|DAF]] developed a stillborn competitor for this field, the 1972 BATU (Basic Automotive Transport Unit)&lt;ref name=curbs&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.curbsideclassic.com/blog/museum/museum-classics-daf-museum-eindhoven-part-four-the-specialties/ | title = Museum Classics: DAF Museum Eindhoven, Part Four – The Specialties | last = Dutch | first = Johannes | date = 2015-09-25 | work = Curbside Classic }}&lt;/ref&gt; General Motors' [[Bedford HA#BTV|BTV effort]] was sold under a variety of different names and used the [[Vauxhall Viva]]'s underpinnings and 1256&amp;nbsp;cc [[inline-four engine]]. It was built in Ecuador, Malaysia, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Portugal, and the Philippines. It was marketed as the GM Amigo, Andino (Ecuador),  Mitaí (Paraguay), and Bedford Harimau ("Tiger", Malaysia).

[[File:Toyota-Tamaraw.JPG|thumb|The 1977 Toyota Tamaraw]]
[[Citroën]]'s [[Citroën FAF|FAF and Baby Brousse]] also fit this mold, with the acronym FAF standing for "Easy to Finance, Easy to Build." The FAF and related versions entered production in ten countries, most of them in the developing world. Over 30,000 were built from 1973 until the 1980s.&lt;ref name=citnet&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.citroenet.org.uk/foreign/baby-brousse/index.html | title = Baby Brousse | work = Citroënët | accessdate = 2016-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nissan]] called their Datsun 1200 AX a BTV, it was introduced in June 1977 and received their 1171&amp;nbsp;cc [[Nissan A engine|A12 engine]]. Nissan/Datsun built it in Thailand (Siam Motors) and in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | title = View: In on the ground floor | page = 7 | date = 1977-06-18 | url = https://www.flickr.com/photos/7430965@N05/4143231694 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Portugal it was called the Datsun Sado. The most successful BUV is arguably the [[Toyota Kijang]], which entered production in Indonesia and the Philippines (as the Tamaraw) in 1977 and 1976. The Kijang/Tamaraw has, over five generations, morphed into a fairly luxurious [[Compact MPV]] called the [[Toyota Innova]].

One thing that unites the various Basic Utility Vehicles of this era is that they used almost exclusively flat, welded sheetmetal, giving them a certain uniformity of appearance. Later yet, the independent [[Africar]] project again tried to target developing markets, in particular, Africa. Only six were built from 1986 until the company folded in 1988.

==BUV Design Competition==
[[File:BUVcompetition2008_01.jpg|thumb|The 2006 Basic Utility Vehicle competition]]
[[File:BUVcompetition2008_02.jpg|thumb|A three-wheeled BUV]]

The [[Institute for Affordable Transportation]] (IAT) is the promoter of this type of vehicle and the main sponsor. IAT runs the annual BUV Design Competition where engineering students bring their vehicles for judging and performance evaluation (including cost) and contribute to IAT’s research and development efforts. The competition harnesses the creative energy of college students from across the United States in an effort to develop a simple, low-cost utility vehicle that can benefit low-income people in rural areas of developing countries.  

Student teams design and build these vehicles to compete in a series of tests and events to determine the best design.  Each team also plans an oral report aimed towards the judges and spectators. In the reports, students discuss the planning, building, and testing processes that each BUV went through prior to the competition. Because the BUV must account for a lack of infrastructure, the vehicles must pass a variety of tests during the competition including an obstacle course, mud pit, mogul field, and endurance track.  Many of the students work on the BUV as a senior capstone project at the end of their engineering degree.

BUVs are designed around these specifications:

*Cost:		less than $1000
*Payload:	1000 lbs
*Maximum speed:	20 mph
*Weight:	500 lbs.
*Engine:	10 or 11 HP, gasoline or Diesel  
*Materials:	pickup-truck axle, steel tubing and angle etc.  
*Maximize:	Number of unassembled kits that fit in 20' ocean container
*Minimize:	Total cost of ownership, custom designed parts, part number count
*Excluded	Doors, body panels, glass, trim, gauges, hydraulics, radiator, heater

The '''China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite program''' ('''CBERS''') is a technological cooperation program between [[Brazil]] and [[China]] which develops and operates [[Earth observation satellite]]s.

==History==
The basis for the space cooperation between China and Brazil was established in May 1984, when both countries signed a complementary agreement to the cooperation framework agreement in science and technology. In July 1988, China and Brazil signed the protocol establishing the joint research and production of the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellites (CBERS). Brazil, emerging from a long military regime, sought to abandon the Cold War logic and establish new international partnerships. China was dedicated to its great internal reform, but was also seeking international partnerships to develop advanced technologies. The agreement was advantageous for both countries. Brazil had the chance to develop medium-size satellites at a time when it was only capable of building small ones (100&amp;nbsp;kg size). China had an international partner that posed no military threats and that was receptive of foreigners.

Brazil and China negotiated the CBERS project during two years (1986–1988), exchanging important technical information and visiting each other’s facilities, and they concluded that both sides had all the human, technical and material conditions to jointly develop an Earth resource observation satellite program. The Complementary Protocol on Cooperation on Space Technology was renewed in 1994 and again in 2004.

== Responsible agencies ==
In Brazil, the [[Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais]] (INPE or National Institute of Space Research) and the [[Brazilian Space Agency]] ({{lang-pt|Agência Espacial Brasileira}}; AEB) are involved with the program, as is the Brazilian industrial sector. In China, organizations involved include the [[China Academy of Space Technology]] (a sub-entity of the [[China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation]]), the [[China National Space Administration]] and various other organizations.

==Satellites==
Initially the program included development and deployment of two satellites, CBERS-1 and CBERS-2. Subsequently, agreement was reached to include three additional satellites, CBERS-3, 4 and 4B.

===CBERS-1 and CBERS-2===
{{main article|CBERS-1|CBERS-2}}
The first satellite of the series, [[CBERS-1]], was successfully launched on October 14, 1999&lt;ref name="INPE"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cbers.inpe.br/en/programas/faq.htm | title = Frequently asked questions on CBERS program | publisher = INPE | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070206001643/http://www.cbers.inpe.br/en/programas/faq.htm | archivedate = 2007-02-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="INPE"/&gt; on a [[Long March 4B]]. It is sometimes also called ZY 1.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1999-057A | title = CBERS 1 | publisher = National Space Science Data Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remained functional until August 2003.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second satellite, [[CBERS-2]], was successfully launched on October 21, 2003&lt;ref&gt;

It was retired from service in January 2009, after the launch of [[CBERS-2B]].

====Configuration====
CBERS-1 and 2 are identical satellites. They have three remote sensing multispectral cameras:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cbers.inpe.br/?hl=en&amp;content=cameras1e2e2b | title = CBERS Satéllite Sino Brasileiro de Recursos Terrestres}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Wide Field Imager Camera (WFI).''' This camera records images in two spectral bands: 0,63 – 0,69&amp;nbsp;µm (red) and 0,77 – 0,89&amp;nbsp;µm (infrared), with 260m spatial resolution and 890&amp;nbsp;km of ground swath. About five days are necessary for a whole coverage of the Earth surface.
*'''Medium Resolution Camera (CCD).''' This camera records images in five spectral bands: 0,51 – 0,73&amp;nbsp;µm (panchromatic); 0,45 – 0,52&amp;nbsp;µm (blue); 0,52 – 0,59&amp;nbsp;µm (green); 0,63 – 0,69&amp;nbsp;µm (red); 0,77 – 0,89&amp;nbsp;µm (near infrared), with 20m spatial resolution and 120&amp;nbsp;km of ground swath. It is possible to operate this camera both on nadir and off-nadir. This last capability allows the system to reduce the temporal resolution from 26 days (nadir operation mode) to three days (off-nadir operation mode).
*'''Infrared Multispectral Scanner Camera (IRMSS).''' This camera records images in four spectral bands: 0,50 – 1,10&amp;nbsp;µm (panchromatic); 1,55 – 1,75&amp;nbsp;µm (infrared); 2,08 – 2,35&amp;nbsp;µm (infrared) and 10,40 – 12,50&amp;nbsp;µm (thermal infrared), with 80m spatial resolution on the three infrared reflected bands and 120 m in the thermal infrared one. Ground swath is 120&amp;nbsp;km for all the bands of this camera and 26 days are required to obtain a full coverage of the Earth by this camera.

===CBERS-2B===
{{main article|CBERS-2B}}
[[CBERS-2B]] was launched on 19 September 2007 by a Long-March 4B rocket from the Taiyuan base in China. The satellite operated until June 2010. Sample images from CBERS-2B were made available on January 10, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.cbers.inpe.br/en_noticias/index.php?cod=not88 | title = CBERS-2B first images delivered | publisher = INPE | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110706160714/http://www.cbers.inpe.br/en_noticias/index.php?cod=not88 | archivedate = 2011-07-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBERS-2B is also similar to the two previous members of the series, but a new camera was added to the last satellite: '''High Resolution Panchromatic Camera (HRC).''' This camera records images in one single panchromatic band  0,50 – 0,80&amp;nbsp;µm which comprises part of the visible and of the near infrared portion of electromagnetic spectrum.  The images recorded by this camera are 27&amp;nbsp;km width and have 2.7m spatial resolution.  130 days are required to obtain a full coverage of the Earth by this camera.

===CBERS-3 and CBERS-4===
{{main article|CBERS-3|CBERS-4}}
[[CBERS-3]] was launched in December 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cenariomt.com.br/noticia.asp?cod=175759&amp;codDep=8 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525045412/http://www.cenariomt.com.br/noticia.asp?cod=175759&amp;codDep=8 |archivedate=2013-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was lost after the [[Long March 4B|Chang Zheng 4B]] rocket carrying it malfunctioned. The identical [[CBERS-4]] satellite was successfully launched in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/12/200th-long-march-launches-cbers-4-brazil/ | title = 200th Long March rocket launches CBERS-4 for Brazil | author =  Rui C. Barbosa | publisher = NASASpaceflight.com | date = 7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both satellites carry four cameras:

*'''Advanced Wide Field Imager Camera (AWFI).''' This camera records images in four spectral bands: 0,45 – 0,52&amp;nbsp;µm (blue); 0,52 – 0,59&amp;nbsp;µm (green); 0,63 – 0,69&amp;nbsp;µm (red); 0,77 – 0,89&amp;nbsp;µm (near infrared), with 60m spatial resolution and 720&amp;nbsp;km of ground swath. About five days are necessary for a whole coverage of the Earth surface.
*'''Infrared Multispectral Scanner Camera (IRMSS).''' This camera records images in four spectral bands: 0,50 – 1,10&amp;nbsp;µm (panchromatic); 1,55 – 1,75&amp;nbsp;µm (infrared); 2,08 – 2,35&amp;nbsp;µm (infrared) and 10,40 – 12,50&amp;nbsp;µm (thermal infrared), with 40m spatial resolution on the three infrared reflected bands and 80 m in the thermal infrared one. Ground swath is 120&amp;nbsp;km for all the bands of this camera and 26 days are required to obtain a full coverage of the Earth by this camera.
*'''Panchromatic and Multispectral Camera (PANMUX).''' This camera records images in four spectral bands: 0,51 – 0,73&amp;nbsp;µm (panchromatic); 0,45 – 0,52&amp;nbsp;µm (blue); 0,52 – 0,59&amp;nbsp;µm (green); 0,63 – 0,69&amp;nbsp;µm (red); 0,77 – 0,89&amp;nbsp;µm (near infrared), with 5m spatial resolution for the panchromatic band and 10m spatial resolution in the other bands. It has 60&amp;nbsp;km of ground swath.It is possible to operate this camera both on nadir and off-nadir.

===CBERS-4A===
CBERS-4A is expected to be launched in 2019.

'''Consumer adoption of technological innovations''' is the [[Cognitive process|process]] consumers use to determine whether or not to adopt an [[innovation]]. This process is influenced by [[consumer]] characteristics, such as personality traits and demographic or socioeconomic factors, the characteristics of the new product, such as its relative advantage and complexity, and social influences, such as opinion leaders.

In the context of technological innovations, the adoption process is also influenced by one or several [[new technologies]] that are incorporated in the new product. New technologies are likely to significantly affect the innovation's functionality or interface. Functionality refers to the set of potential benefits that a product can provide the consumer. Interface refers here to the specific means by which a consumer interacts with a product to obtain a particular functionality. Specifically, new technologies suggest four types of innovations with unique characteristics that are likely to affect the adoption process. Alternatively it can be looked at as a Paradox of Technology.

==Paradox of Technology==

Donald Norman in his book, [[The Design of Everyday Things]], outlines the idea of "Paradox of Technology". Norman's paradox states that when a new functionality is added to a technology, it also increases its complexity. Thus, a technology intended to make life easier by providing more functionality, also makes it more complex by making things harder to learn. A good design must reduce the difficulties in use of the ever-growing technology.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Donald A. "The Design of Everyday Things."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Information and communications technology|Information and communications technologies]] such as [[Facebook]] experienced this phenomenon when they released the News Feed functionality to all users. The new groundbreaking feature was met with mass upheaval with only one in 100 messages about News Feed being positive.&lt;ref&gt;Quora. "Something To Consider Before You Complain About Facebook's News Feed Updates." Forbes. 02 Apr. 2013. Forbes Magazine. 01 May 2014 &lt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2013/04/02/something-to-consider-before-you-complain-about-facebooks-news-feed-updates/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Now, News Feed is an essential feature of Facebook which users today would be outraged if removed.

==Symbolic Interactionism==
[[Symbolic interactionism]], the concept that people act toward things based on the meaning they have for them; and these meanings are derived from social interaction and modified though interpretation), plays a key in role in the consumer adoption of technological innovations. People have personal meanings for certain aspects of the technology; when these technologies are changed or modified it can greatly affect how the user interacts with the technology.

A good example of this concept is the controversial removal of the [[Start Menu]] from [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] [[Windows 8]]. A major reason this was so controversial is this concept of symbolic internationalism. Critique Mark Wilson writes, "I grew up on Windows 3.1 and the introduction of the Start button/menu in Windows 95 was a revelation. Windows 8 was a step in the wrong direction."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Mark. "Did Microsoft get it wrong with the Start button in Windows 8.1? (opinion) Written by Mark Wilson on October 21, 2013, 09:28AM." Microsoft news and more. 21 Oct. 2013. WinBeta. 01 May 2014 &lt;http://www.winbeta.org/news/did-microsoft-get-it-wrong-start-button-windows-81-opinion&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar critiques and reactions was a major issue and Microsoft even brought it back the next release of Windows. Many including Microsoft will argue the start menu was dated and that the newer metro start screen is an improvement upon the start menu but that is still up to debate and preference.

==Social Influences==
When a new technology is introduced a user evaluates if the perceived benefits (functionality, aesthetics etc.) outweigh any negative social nuances it may introduce. New technology not only changes the way that the user interacts with it, but often also asks users to embrace new behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Rico J, Brewster S. Gestures all around us: user differences in social acceptability perceptions of gesture based interfaces. In Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services 2009 Sep 15 (p. 64). ACM.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as our technologies are increasingly becoming more mobile, these new behaviors frequently take place in a public location and become an integral part of a user’s social appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Rico J, Brewster S. Usable gestures for mobile interfaces: evaluating social acceptability. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems 2010 Apr 10 (pp. 887-896). ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often the case that every new technology introduces public discomfort. While the first handheld cellular phone was developed in 1973, it was not until the early 2000s that they technology became truly ubiquitous. While a part of the slow growth of cellular phones can be attributed to its design, another big part was the technology being considered esoteric by many.

Sandra Vannoy and Prashant Palvia developed a theoretical model called the "Social Influence Model" that investigates technology adoption at a societal or communal level.&lt;ref&gt;Vannoy SA, Palvia P. The social influence model of technology adoption. Communications of the ACM. 2010 Jun 1;53(6):149-53.&lt;/ref&gt; The postulate that social influence constitutes of four overlapping phenomenon:

# '''Social Computing Action:''' actions performed through use of technology such as Web browsers and cell phones.
# '''Social Computing Consensus:''' agreement from all people that it is right to carry out the action.
# '''Social Computing Cooperation:''' participating in a way that is in the best interests of the group.
# '''Social Computing Authority:''' recognizing that the authority imposed by the group supersedes traditional authority.

Technology adoption is typically measured on two factors: embedment and embracement in daily life.&lt;ref&gt;Baron S, Patterson A, Harris K. Beyond technology acceptance: understanding consumer practice. International Journal of Service Industry Management. 2006 Mar 1;17(2):111-35.&lt;/ref&gt; Social influence deals with the embedment of technology. Embedment in daily life is evaluated by examining how other members of the society present in the same environment utilize the technology, and how the technology is perceived by these members.

== Existing functionality and existing interface ==
These innovations are incremental in nature since they offer an existing functionality and an existing interface; however, they are usually characterized by esthetic changes that affect the product's appearance. Smart phones, for example, are usually black or silver when first introduced into the market but are available in multiple colors several months later.

== Existing functionality and new interface ==
These innovations provide benefits available by existing products but result in a new set of actions for the consumer. [[Speech recognition|Voice recognition software]] is one example of this type of innovation. Consumers create documents or emails, for example, by dictating (instead of typing) to a computer.

== New functionality and existing interface ==
These innovations do not change consumer interaction with a device; they offer, however, a new functionality. Multi-mode cellphones, for example, operate in more than one frequency and enable roaming between different countries.

== New functionality and new interface ==
[[GPS navigation device|Car GPS navigation systems]], for example, fall under this category. These products provide the consumer with novel functionality, such as door-to-door navigation and real-time traffic information. The novel interface implies a new set of actions for using the device, such as using a touch-screen and voice recognition interfaces.
Innovations that incorporate a novel interface require significant learning cost from the consumer since they imply learning a new set of tasks. High learning cost is likely to hinder the adoption of such innovations, unless the functionality provided is new and provides significant benefits to the consumer. Furthermore, innovations incorporating a novel interface often result in fear of technological complexity leading to feelings of ineptitude and frustration. Conversely, innovations that provide the consumer with a new functionality are characterized by a high relative advantage, which is likely to facilitate adoption.

==Impact of Privacy Concerns==
As technologies have improved in the past years privacy has become a major concern among consumers because the data revolution and [[Big Data]]. Technological innovations more recently have seriously been affected by these concerns and changes how people interact with these new technologies. Privacy is a very broad concept, it is very hard to define in simple manners and is still a controversial subject, and because of this confusion, consumers reject many innovations or unknowingly give their personal data to third parties. [[Daniel J. Solove]] is an expert in the topic of Privacy and in his recent book ''Understanding Privacy'' he lays out the problems and frameworks of privacy in the era of technology and the data revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Solove, Daniel J., Understanding Privacy. Daniel J. Solove, UNDERSTANDING PRIVACY, Harvard University Press, May 2008; GWU Legal Studies Research Paper No. 420; GWU Law School Public Law Research Paper No. 420. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1127888&lt;/ref&gt; Another good example is [[Eli Pariser|Eli Pariser's]] concept of [[The Filter Bubble]] that he lays out in his book, ''The Filter Bubble: What the Internet Is Hiding from You.''&lt;ref&gt;Eli Pariser. 2011. The Filter Bubble: What the Internet is Hiding from You. Penguin Group, The.&lt;/ref&gt; Innovations like personalized search from Google are very controversial mainly because most consumers have no idea that it is even occurring.

The term '''cosmetic packaging''' is used for [[cosmetic container]]s (primary packaging) and secondary packaging of [[Aroma compound|fragrances]] and [[cosmetics|cosmetic products]].&lt;ref name="Cosper-Purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=Purposes of Cosmetic Packaging|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=Cosmetic packaging compliant to ISO 22715|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/cosmetic-packaging-compliant-to-iso-22715|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmetic products are substances intended for human cleansing, beautifying and promoting an enhanced appearance without altering the body's structure or functions.&lt;ref name="FDA-Cosmetics Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is It a Cosmetic, a Drug, or Both? (Or Is It Soap?)|url=http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/GuidanceRegulation/LawsRegulations/ucm074201.htm|publisher=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA)|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmetic packaging is standardized by an international norm set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] and regulated by national or regional regulations such as those issued by the [[Regulation (European Union)|EU]] or the [[FDA]]. Marketers and manufacturers of cosmetic products must be compliant to these regulations to be able to market their cosmetic products in the corresponding [[Jurisdiction (area)|areas of jurisdiction]].&lt;ref name="Turner-legally binding"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Is the Standard ISO 22715 on Cosmetic Packaging legally binding?|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/is-the-standard-iso-22715-on-cosmetic-packaging-legally-binding|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The term cosmetic packaging includes primary and the secondary packaging. Primary packaging, also called cosmetic container, is housing the cosmetic product. It is in direct contact with the cosmetic product. Secondary packaging is the outer wrapping of one or several cosmetic containers. An important difference between primary and secondary packaging is that any information that is necessary to clarify the safety of the product must appear on the primary package. Otherwise, much of the required information can appear on just the secondary packaging. 
The cosmetic container shall carry the name of the [[distributor]], the [[ingredient]]s, define storage, nominal content, product identification (e.g., batch number), warning notices and directions for use.
The secondary packaging shall in addition carry the address of the distributor and information on the cosmetic's mode of action. The secondary packaging does not need to carry any product identification notice.
In cases where the cosmetic product is only wrapped by one single container, this container needs to carry all the information.&lt;ref name="Cosper-PackagingFDA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=What you should know when packaging cosmetics compliant to FDA regulations|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/what-you-should-know-when-packaging-cosmetics-compliant-to-fda-regulations|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of cosmetic packaging==
There are multiple reasons why care must be put into cosmetic containers. Not only must they protect the product, they need to provide conveniences for vendors and ultimately consumers.

===Protection===
The  main purpose of a container is to store the product so that it is not degraded through storage, shipping and handling.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging" /&gt; Degradation and damage can be caused by various causes. These causes can be categorized into [[Biological process|biological]], [[Chemical reaction|chemical]], [[temperature|thermal]] causes, damage caused by [[Radiation damage|radiation]] and damage caused by human interaction, by electric sources or by [[pressure]].&lt;ref name="Cosper-PackagingFDA" /&gt;

In addition to protecting the product, packaging also play a big role [[marketing]] cosmetic products. While product quality is a major factor in the product's success, its packaging must be attractive since that's the essence of beauty marketing. Package design must capture the imagination and be associated with enhancing appearance. One of the keys to attractive packaging is artistic use of colors. Most relevant for the marketer is the outer secondary packaging. However, there are cosmetics which are distributed in one single cosmetic container.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging" /&gt;

===Creation of brand awareness===
Cosmetic packages must not only convey [[beauty]], they must equate to [[brand awareness]]. Since the package is what the consumer initially sees, it is very influential in shaping perceptions about the product. Part of building brand awareness for a cosmetic product is associating it with [[emotion]]. Since it's not a survival product it's marketed to appeal to the desire to enhance appearance. The packaging must stimulate this emotion.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging" /&gt;

===Labelling===
[[Label]]s tell consumers what they need to know about the product, as far as how to use it and where it comes from. Companies must list the ingredients and the function of the product, especially when it is unclear. The label  must contain contact information of the entity responsible for putting the product on the market. Labels also provide product tracking information.

The label must be easy to read, particularly for a customer where the product is being displayed. Certain compositions, such as perfumes, can be listed as one ingredient. Secondary packages are what the consumer sees as the outermost package. Primary packages are within the secondary package. Certain information can appear just on secondary packages. The most important information, particularly if the product is prone to misuse, must be displayed on both the primary and secondary packaging.&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CosmeticsEurope"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding the label|url=https://www.cosmeticseurope.eu/cosmetic-products/understanding-label/|publisher=Cosmetics Europe Association|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Information accuracy====
One of the most important aspects of regulations on labelling is that the information is accurate. Although the FDA does not have the resources to inspect all cosmetic products on the market, it can issue penalties for various violations involving packaging and labelling. It is the manufacturer's responsibility to make sure that its product is safe for public consumption.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging" /&gt;

====Avoidance of misleading information====
None of the information, including name and address, may be misleading. Words can be abbreviated only if it is clear what they represent. All text must be printed clearly on the packaging. Smaller packages in which text is too difficult to read, should include tags with legible text.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;

====Listing of ingredients====
Ingredients must be listed in a certain order with priority given to ingredients that represent 1% or more of the volume. These ingredients must be listed in descending order, based on weight. This group of ingredients is then followed by those that represent 1% or less of the product and listed in any order. Colorants may also be listed in any order.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Purposes-of-cosmetic-packaging" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;

===Packaging in multiple layers===
Many times cosmetic products are packaged in multiple layers. Whenever it is difficult to detect for the consumer, the number of units should be listed on the outer package, which should contain details about how to use the product and warnings on what to do if it is misused. It is essential that the product is protected from environmental elements such as [[mould]] and [[bacteria]].

The packaging must be sufficient enough to protect the mechanical, thermal, biological and chemical properties of the product. It should also be strong enough to withstand human tampering and [[radiation damage]].&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;

==FDA and EU regulations==
The FDA overseas cosmetic packaging but does not test products. It leaves testing for safety up to manufacturers. It still provides regulations and can issue recalls when a product is associated with safety hazards. While the FDA does not have many restrictions on ingredients for cosmetic products, it does require that certain chemicals and colorants be listed.&lt;ref name="Cosper-PackagingFDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FDA-CosmeticsLaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmetics &amp; U.S. Law |url=http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/GuidanceRegulation/LawsRegulations/ucm2005209.htm|publisher=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA)|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as [[EU regulation]]s regarding packaging, manufacturers must be compliant with EC No. 1223/2009. One of these requirements involves the manufacturer issuing a safety report before putting the product on the market. The manufacturer must also disclose any serious undesirable effects (SUE) to the EU. Marketers are required to list nano-materials. 
The EU's definition of "ingredients" does not include raw or technical materials used in production that do not end up in the final product. In some cases when durability is an issue, the manufacturer must list an expiration date after the product has been opened. The words "best used before" are common for identifying the product expiration date.&lt;ref name="EU-Regulation-On-Cosmetics"&gt;{{cite web|title=REGULATION (EC) No 1223/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  of 30 November 2009  on cosmetic products|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32009R1223|publisher=THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosper-Packaging-in-EU"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=What you should know when packaging cosmetics compliant to EU regulations|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/what-you-should-know-when-packaging-cosmetics-compliant-to-eu-regulations|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CosmeticsEuropeRegulation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cosmetics Regulation|url=https://www.cosmeticseurope.eu/cosmetics-industry/understanding-cosmetics-regulation/|publisher=Cosmetics Europe Association|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ISO-Standard==
Standard [[ISO 22715]] provides specifications for the packaging and labeling of all cosmetic products that are sold or distributed at no charge; i.e. free samples. National regulations dictate what products are to be regarded as cosmetics. While ISO 22715 is not legally binding, national regulations regarding cosmetic products can be even stricter than those laid out in ISO 22715. The link between [[International standard|standards]] and [[regulation]]s is that a standard often represents the common denominator of [[national law]], as the [[standardization]] committee consists of members of most countries.&lt;ref name="Turner-legally binding" /&gt;

'''Counterparty''' is a financial platform for creating [[peer-to-peer]] financial applications on the [[bitcoin]] [[Blockchain (database)|blockchain]]. The protocol specification and all Counterparty software is open source. The reference client is counterparty and a web wallet called Counterwallet showcases all protocol features. The protocol’s native currency, XCP, is the fuel that powers Counterparty. It is slightly deflationary, with approximately 2.6 million XCP having been created by burning Bitcoins in January 2014. Counterparty provides users with the world's first functioning [[decentralized exchange|decentralized digital currency exchange]],&lt;ref name="bromden_first"&gt;{{cite web|title=Counterparty to Create First Peer-to-Peer Digital Asset Exchange Platform|url=http://cointelegraph.com/post/counterparty_to_create_first_peer_to_peer_digital_asset_exchange_platform#.U1AbsPRDsnt|last=Bromden|first=Stanislas|date=2014-04-10|accessdate=2014-04-27|publisher=CoinTelegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the ability to create their own virtual assets, issue dividends, create [[Financial data vendor|price feeds]], bets and [[contract for difference|contracts for difference]].&lt;ref name="bradbury"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradbury|first=Danny|title=Developers Battle Over Bitcoin Block Chain|url=http://www.coindesk.com/developers-battle-bitcoin-block-chain/|date=2014-03-25|publisher=CoinDesk|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==XCP==
[[File:Counterparty xcp symbol.png|thumb|XCP Symbol]]
Counterparty has a native currency called '''XCP'''. It was originally issued using a provable method called "proof of burn". This method involves sending bitcoins to a special address that renders the coins permanently unspendable. By avoiding funding during its launch, Counterparty has ensured that developers and users have equal financial opportunities. During January 2014, 2125.63 bitcoins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blockscan.com/burn|title=Counterparty XCP Block Explorer :: Proof Of Burn|author=|date=|work=blockscan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; were sent to  1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blockchain.info/address/1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr|title=Bitcoin Address 1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr|author=|date=|work=blockchain.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; (worth roughly US$1.8 million at the time).&lt;ref name="brokaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=The People Who Burn Bitcoins|author=Alex Brokaw|date=2014-04-16|url=http://www.minyanville.com/business-news/editors-pick/articles/The-People-Who-Burn-Bitcoins-bitcoin/4/16/2014/id/54627|accessdate=2014-04-26|publisher=Minyanville}}&lt;/ref&gt; XCP is used in the Counterparty protocol to create new assets, make bets, and perform callbacks on callable assets. Counterparty used proof of burn to issue XCP, instead of a more traditional fund-raising technique for altcoin launches, to keep the initial distribution of funds as fair and decentralized as possible, and to avoid potential legal issues.&lt;ref name="brokaw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="swanson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Swanson|first=Tim|title=Great Chain of Numbers a Guide to Smart Contracts, Smart Property and Trustless Asset Management|section=Chapter 3: Next Generation Platforms|url=http://www.ofnumbers.com/2014/03/04/chapter-3-next-generation-platforms/|publisher=Self-published|accessdate=2014-04-26|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use-cases ===
{{More citations needed|section|date=March 2018}}
* '''Programmable Smart Contracts''' - Turing-complete smart contracts scripting is one of the most powerful Counterparty features. Users can write their own custom financial instruments and decentralized applications (Dapp). Counterparty contracts are 100% compatible with Ethereum scripting, and pretty much all contracts can be run on both platforms without code changes.
* '''Betting''' - Counterparty turns the bitcoin blockchain into a betting platform and prediction market. Oracles can create broadcasts of information, and users can then place bets on these broadcasts. Funds are escrowed automatically by the protocol and benefit from being stored securely inside the bitcoin blockchain. Funds placed on bets are provably inaccessible until the bet is resolved or expires. Oracles can set a fee fraction to receive for their betting feeds, providing an incentive to run their broadcasts.
* '''Tickets &amp; Coupons''' - Assets can be used as tickets to a music event, parking tickets, coupons, etc.
* '''Token Controlled Access (TCA)''' - Token Controlled Access is the idea of granting access to private forums, chat rooms, games, projects or other social media based on the ownership of tokens. Different types of tokens represent different types of membership, and holders of that token can register and/or view the restricted content. To invite new users, smaller fractions of these tokens can be transferred. If the token is indivisible and scarce, it will limit the number of users others are able to invite. These tokens are also publicly tradable on the DEX and therefore can have a monetary value, and/or one proportional to other types of these tokens.
* '''Proof of Publication''' - Using broadcasts, users can publish timestamped information onto the bitcoin blockchain. This makes it possible to verify that something has been posted at a certain time, and it cannot be deleted.
* '''Crowdfunding''' - Counterparty assets can be used for crowdfunding. You can issue a certain amount of assets and sell these to start your project. Due to the high amount of trust involved, it is better to use a Counterparty-based crowdfunding platform which can perform due-diligence on your project. This will provide your users trust, and demonstrate the legitimacy of your project. There is nothing stopping you from doing this on your own, but users may rightfully be suspicious about your project.
* '''Derivatives''' - You can back Counterparty assets with tangible goods, such as gold.
* '''In-game Currency''' - To integrate your multiplayer game into the global economy, Counterparty assets can also be used as in-game currency.
* '''Altcoin Migration''' - If you have an altcoin that seeks to fulfill a specific purpose, but do not wish to continue mining, you can migrate it to Counterparty with proof-of-burn.
* '''Verifiable Voting''' -Counterparty supports voting through the use of user-created tokens. This means that you can post the terms and options of your vote as a broadcast, and let users vote on its outcome with full transparency by using tokens. If you create a token (EXAMPLE), you can create any other tokens (such as EXAMPLEVOTE) and pay distributions of EXAMPLEVOTE to all holders of EXAMPLE in one single action. Create a distribution payment and choose EXAMPLEVOTE as the currency to distribute. This way, all holders of EXAMPLE will receive EXAMPLEVOTE in the amount you specify. Now all you need are as many different bitcoin addresses as there are choices in your poll. For example, one bitcoin address for yes, one for no. To cast their votes, holders of EXAMPLE can then send the EXAMPLEVOTE they have received to whichever address they choose. The results of the poll will then be public and verifiable on the bitcoin blockchain and can be visualized in a block explorer.

Since Counterparty Assets are created within the bitcoin blockchain, the assets actually exist in any bitcoin block explorer, however, to decode the information on what bitcoin address has what asset an additional layer of block exploration needs to be applied. Currently, there are two block explorers you can use to locate Counterparty assets in bitcoin wallets:
* '''Blockscan''' - Blockscan was the first block explorer built specifically for the Counterparty protocol. You can explore everything from the original burns used to generate XCP, to the most recent assets created by users. This feature-rich website allows you to really dive into the blockchain to take a look at all the assets, broadcasts, and transactions that take place. Blockscan also offers additional features if you register for an account. Once you log into an account made on Blockscan you can verify addresses that you own by signing messages or broadcasting feeds and then your username will be associated with those wallets. This allows you to create voting scoreboards and change asset descriptions for ones you own in that wallet.
* '''Counterparty Chain''' - Counterparty Chain by CoinDaddy has a block explorer and API service for XCP assets (Counterparty). But CoinDaddy is not just simply a block explorer, they also have a whole suite of features available to the public including Asset registration, transfer services, asset enhancement, asset vending machines, and enhanced broadcasting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4468">'''Currah''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[computer]] [[peripheral]] manufacturer, famous mainly for the [[speech synthesis]] [[ROM cartridge]]s it designed for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], and other 8-bit [[home computer]]s of the 1980s.

==Currah μSource for the ZX Spectrum==
Currah μSource from [[Quadhouse]]. In a self-contained ROM cartridge it has a full-function-two-pass macro assembler, Forth and a debugger, all of which can interact with Basic. It is also compatible with Interface 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/048/usource.htm |title=Sinclair User 48 - Currah μSource |publisher=Sincuser.f9.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305202039/http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/048/usource.htm |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Currah μSpeech for the ZX Spectrum==
The Currah μSpeech, commonly referred to as the ''Microspeech'' plugged into the [[expansion port]] on the back of the ZX Spectrum. Additional leads were provided to feed the sound and [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] signal from the computer into the unit.  The TV [[aerial lead]] plugged into the unit and speech sounds were added into the UHF signal generated by computer.

By default, the unit "spoke" every key-press the user made, even the direction keys which came out as "CURSOR".  This could be controlled by a reserved variable &lt;code&gt;KEYS&lt;/code&gt;. Typing
 LET KEYS=0
would turn this feature off.

===Programming speech===
Specific words and phrases could be spoken by assigning a value to the reserved string variable &lt;code&gt;S$&lt;/code&gt;.  This was interpreted letter-by-letter unless brackets were used to denote other [[allophone]]s.  A simple example would be "(dth)is", (dth) representing the [[voiced dental fricative]] /ð/. Sixty-three allophones were provided.  Rudimentary [[pitch modulation]] could be achieved by altering the case of the letters—upper case letters being pronounced at a slightly higher pitch.

A more complex example:
  5 REM OKAY WISEGUY THIS IS IT
 10 &lt;nowiki&gt;LET a$=" (oo)K (AA)"&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 20 &lt;nowiki&gt;LET b$="w(ii)z (ggg) (ii),"&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 30 &lt;nowiki&gt;LET c$=" (dth)is iz it"&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 40 &lt;nowiki&gt;LET S$=a$+b$+c$&lt;/nowiki&gt;

{{Listen|filename=Okwiseguy.ogg|title=Currah Microspeech output|description=Audio recording of output from this program listing - 38 KB|format=[[Ogg]]}}

===Technical details===
The unit contained a [[Uncommitted Logic Array|ULA]] which worked on a WRITE command from the microprocessor, a [[Read-only memory|ROM]] containing the keyword speech patterns, and an [[General Instrument SP0256-AL2|SP0256-AL2]] speech processor. It also contained a clock for clear speech and an [[audio modulator]] to transfer the sound to the TV lead.  A small adjustment screw was provided, to allow fine tuning of the audio output.

The unit allocated itself the top 256 bytes of memory at switch-on and moved down the USR graphics and RAMTOP.  This made it incompatible with some programs, particularly games, which use that space for machine code.

For cost reasons, the unit did not provide for [[daisy chain (information technology)|daisy-chaining]] of further devices on the computer's expansion port.  Many [[joystick]] [[computer bus|interface]] manufacturers took the same approach, meaning that you could not have a joystick and the MicroSpeech unit plugged in at the same time.

''Booty'' (Firebird Software Ltd) detected the presence of a MicroSpeech unit and presented the user with a completely different game to that which would be played if the MicroSpeech unit was not present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zxplanet.emuunlim.com/booty_hidden_game.htm |title=Booty Hidden Game Review - ZX Planet :: Spectrum Heaven! |publisher=Zxplanet.emuunlim.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Currah was acquired by [[DK'Tronics]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/yr13/yr13_72.htm "Minding his own business"] from ''Your Spectrum'' issue 13, April 1985&lt;/ref&gt; DK'Tronics continued to manufacture the MicroSpeech unit, and many of their software titles (such as ''[[Maziacs]]'' and ''[[Zig Zag (video game)|Zig Zag]]'') supported it.

'''Demand articulation''' is a concept developed within the scientific field of [[innovation]] studies which serves to explain learning processes about needs for new and emerging technologies.&lt;ref&gt;R.E.H.M. Smits, Innovation studies in the 21st century, Technological Forecasting and Social Change 69 (2002) 861-883.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emerging technologies]] are technologies in their early phase of development, which have not resulted in concrete products yet.&lt;ref&gt;Van Merkerk, R. and H. Van Lente (2005). “Tracing emerging irreversibilities in emerging technologies: The case of nanotubes.” Technological Forecasting and Social Change 72(9): 1094-1111.&lt;/ref&gt; Many characteristics of these technologies, such as the technological aspects but also the needs of users concerning the technology, have not been specified yet. Demand articulation can be defined as ‘iterative, inherently creative processes in which stakeholders try to address what they perceive as important characteristics of, and attempt to unravel preferences for an emerging innovation’.&lt;ref&gt;Boon, W.P.C., E.H.M. Moors, S. Kuhlmann, R.E.H.M. Smits  (2010) Demand articulation in emerging technologies: Intermediary user organisations as co-producers? Research policy, 40 (2011) 242–252.&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach may be applied to describing the processes by which needs for emerging technologies become more concrete over time. At the same time, demand articulation can also be perceived as learning processes that can be evaluated.

== Background ==
The concept of demand articulation originates from the theoretical school that explains innovations as a result of the co-evolution of technological developments and societal pressures. The central idea behind this school is that innovations are not only deterministically formed following technological considerations and possibilities, but in interaction with societal aspects, such as ethical questions, user demands, implementation issues.&lt;ref&gt;Mowery, D. C. and N. Rosenberg (1979). “The influence of market demand upon innovation: a critical review of some recent empirical studies.” Research Policy 8(2): 102-153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R. R. and S. G. Winter (1982). An evolutionary theory of economic change. Cambridge/London, The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van den Belt, H. and A. Rip (1987). The Nelson-Winter-Dosi model and synthetic dye chemistry. The social construction of technological systems; new directions in the sociology and history of technology. W. Bijker, T. P. Hughes and T. Pinch. Cambridge, MIT Press: 135-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the emergent phase, several aspects of the technology remain rather ‘fluid’ and can be formed by stakeholders involved. In this period, co-evolution of society and technology takes place and ‘societal entrenchment of a technology’ is carried by different processes in which several aspects of the technology become articulated over time. In the 1990s, the term articulation processes was introduced,&lt;ref&gt;Rip, A. (1995). “Introduction of new technology: making use of recent insights from sociology and economics of technology.” Technology Analysis &amp; Strategic Management 7(4): 417-431.&lt;/ref&gt; including articulation of technology specifications, of product and maintenance networks, of cultural and political acceptability, and of demands.&lt;ref&gt;Nelis, A. (1998). DNA diagnostics in the Netherlands (original title: ‘DNA-diagnostiek in Nederland’). Enschede, Twente University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demand articulation processes owe much to the work of Teubal,&lt;ref&gt;Teubal, M., A. Arnon and M. Trajtenberg (1976). “Performance in innovation in the Israeli electronics industry: a case study of biomedical electronics instrumentation.” Research Policy 5(4): 354-379.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teubal, M. (1979). On user needs and need determination: aspects of the theory of technological innovation. Industrial innovation: technology, policy and diffusion. M. Baker. London, Macmillan: 266-289.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he stated that in existing markets users have defined their needs quite precisely, and prices (also of competitors) play a major role in sales decisions. With breakthrough, radical, emerging technologies there are no markets and needs in place. Producers can only offer blueprints. However, users might not have thought of the direction of solutions the new product offers, and the regime as a whole might even change as a result of the innovation, which both can lead to different preferences of users.

In order to deal with the determination of user preferences in the context of emerging technologies, Teubal &lt;ref&gt;Teubal, M., A. Arnon and M. Trajtenberg (1976). “Performance in innovation in the Israeli electronics industry: a case study of biomedical electronics instrumentation.” Research Policy 5(4): 354-379.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the term market determinateness as “the degree of specificity of the market signals received by the innovating firm and consequently to the extent to which it anticipates demand. In order to explain the concept we introduce four types of market signals, in ascending order of specificity: (1) signals about a need; (2) signals about a product class; (3) signals about basic functions; (4) signals about product specifications.” Ideally, as a technology emerges and several of its aspects become clear, users are also becoming specific about their ‘market signals’ or demands.

Kodama &lt;ref&gt;Kodoma, F. (1995). Emerging Patterns on Innovation: Sources of Japan’s Technological Edge. Boston, Harvard Business School Press.&lt;/ref&gt; later picked up market determinateness or demand articulation, which he defined as “a dynamic interaction of technological activities that involves integrating potential demands into a product concept and decomposing this product concept into development agendas for its individual component technologies”. Building on this, the term ‘latent demand’ was introduced, which means that most stakeholders will not have an evident idea of what they want from the start.&lt;ref&gt;Orihata, M. and C. Watanabe (2000). “The interaction between product concept and institutional inducement: a new driver of product innovation.” Technovation 20: 11-23.&lt;/ref&gt; An actor might have a certain need that is ill-defined or latent, but which, in a sense, cannot be denied. For example, there have been an evident need for communication over long distances and even a then-farfetched idea of mobile communication devices, but the precise need for mobile phones (or SMS services for that matter) could not be foreseen before the introduction of these devices. The demand articulation process, therefore, is the start of a consciousness-raising exercise in which demands become increasingly concrete.

== Definition of demand ==
The definition of demand merits special attention in the context of demand articulation. A clear distinction should be made between two types of demands:&lt;ref&gt;Klerkx, L., K. de Grip and C. Leeuwis (2006). “Hands off but Strings Attached: The Contradictions of Policy-induced Demand-driven Agricultural Extension.” Agriculture and Human Values 23(2): 189-204.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Economic or market demand, i.e. actor X wants a product and is prepared to pay a certain price);
* Substantive demand, i.e. actor X has ideas about how to develop a new technology.
Following the distinction made by Teubal &lt;ref&gt;Teubal, M. (1979). On user needs and need determination: aspects of the theory of technological innovation. Industrial innovation: technology, policy and diffusion. M. Baker. London, Macmillan: 266-289.&lt;/ref&gt; above, substantive demand are more relevant in the emergent phase of technological development. Mowery and Rosenberg &lt;ref&gt;Mowery, D. C. and N. Rosenberg (1979). “The influence of market demand upon innovation: a critical review of some recent empirical studies.” Research Policy 8(2): 102-153.&lt;/ref&gt; underline this by criticising the use of “the rather shapeless and elusive notion of [market] ‘needs’”.

Demands should be regarded as a broad concept that includes a range of concepts varying in level of determinedness and varying in content areas. Concerning the varying degree of concreteness, demands include (ranging from less to more concrete):
* Science fictions, (guiding) visions, mission statements, ‘Leitbilder’, expectations or promises, being real-time representations of future technological situations and capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Borup, M., N. Brown, K. Konrad and H. Van Lente (2006). “The sociology of expectations in science and technology.” Technology Analysis &amp; Strategic Management 18(3/4): 285-298.&lt;/ref&gt; They include statements on the future (‘we expect…’, ‘we anticipate…’, etc.). Visions are “mental images of an attainable future shared by a collection of actors; they guide the actions of and interactions between those actors”.&lt;ref&gt;Grin, J., A. Grunwald, M. Decker, P. Mambrey, R. Reuzel and G. Van der Wilt (1999). The lessons we learnt: first outline of strategy and a methodical repertoire for vision assessment. Vision assessment: shaping technology in 21st century society – Towards a repertoire for technology assessment. J. Grin and A. Grunwald. Berlin, Springer: 169-189.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Perceptions of problems and obstacles with existing products or situations.
* Ideas and solutions: the actor acknowledges a problem, knows a direction for solutions, and has some concrete ideas about how this end state should be reached.
* Concrete and latent needs for existing and non-existing products: “user needs in general are the preferences of the user for the properties of the service or alternatively for the performance dimensions of the product”.&lt;ref&gt;Teubal, M. (1979). On user needs and need determination: aspects of the theory of technological innovation. Industrial innovation: technology, policy and diffusion. M. Baker. London, Macmillan: 266-289.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Concerns about ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) regarding new technologies.

Concerning the content range, demands may include cultural, political, ethical, social issues, because in early stages of technology development it is unclear which issues would become important in steering, and because user preferences are diverse and partially dependent on these issues.

== Demand articulation and innovation ==
[[User innovation|Users]] of products and services have the potential to contribute to innovation processes and to the success of eventual innovations. In the 1970s the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) conducted the SAPPHO-study in which resembling successful and unsuccessful innovations were compared. “The single measure that discriminated most clearly between success and failure was ‘user needs understood’”.&lt;ref&gt;Rothwell, R., C. Freeman, A. Horlsey, V. T. P. Jervis, A. B. Robertson and J. Townsend (1974). “SAPPHO updated – project SAPPHO phase II.” Research Policy 3(3): 258-291.&lt;/ref&gt; Building on this finding, Von Hippel and his colleagues found that users were major sources or “loci” of innovations in several sectors.&lt;ref&gt;Von Hippel, E. (1976). “The dominant role of users in the scientific instrument innovation process.” Research Policy 5: 212-239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Hippel, E. (2005). Democratizing innovation: the evolving phenomenon of user innovation. Advancing knowledge and the knowledge economy, Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do users point to directions of future needs, they could also have first-hand information on new research directions, ideas, problems, and solutions.

The role of demand-side actors has also been studied in a more holistic way in the [[innovation system]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;Lundvall, B. A. (1992). National Systems of Innovation: Towards a Theory of Innovation and Interactive Learning. London, Pinter Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, users – and also intermediary organisations – appear as major actors that are engaged in demand articulation processes. Innovation occurs at the intersection of needs and opportunities, both of which show a large degree of variability and unpredictability. This requires not only exchange of information on qualities and costs of innovations, but also of information on the (technological and user-related) contents of these innovations. This content needs to be communicated. The major role of knowledge in user-producer interactions calls for an emphasis on interactive learning; to innovate successfully, producers constantly need to learn about the technological possibilities as well as about user needs.

These interactive learning processes in which demands for (characteristics of) innovations are increasingly better understood can be regarded as demand articulation.

== Demand articulation in public innovation policy ==
In the light of the benefits of understanding user needs, poorly articulated demand is regarded as one of the systemic failures that innovation systems can face.&lt;ref&gt;Edquist, C. (2005). "Systems of innovation - Perspectives and challenges" In:  J. Fagerberg, D.C. Mowery and R.R. Nelson (2005) The Oxford handbook of innovation. Oxford University Press: Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; Demand articulation, strategy and vision development should be stimulated.&lt;ref&gt;Smits, R. and S. Kuhlmann (2004). “The rise of systemic instruments in innovation policy.” International Journal of Foresight and Innovation Policy 1(1/2): 4-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Public innovation policy can contribute to this by contemplating the use of demand-oriented policy instruments, besides supply-, diffusion- and infrastructure-oriented instruments. Examples of demand-oriented innovation policy instruments are public procurement,&lt;ref&gt;Edler, J. and L. Georghiou (2007). "Public procurement and innovation – Resurrecting the demand side. Research Policy 36,949–963.&lt;/ref&gt; visioning exercises to produce R&amp;D agendas &lt;ref&gt;Roelofsen, A., J. E. W. Broerse, Tj. de Cock Buning and J. F. G. Bunders (2008). “Exploring the future of ecological genomics: Integrating CTA with vision assessment.” Technological Forecasting and Social Change 75(3): 334-355.&lt;/ref&gt; and facilitate user-producer interactions in local, experimental transdisciplinary settings.&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F. W. (2002). “Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: a multi-level perspective and a case-study.” Research Policy 31(8/9): 1257-1274.&lt;/ref&gt;

In several countries, including Germany &lt;ref&gt;Edler, J. (2007). "Nachfrageorientierte Innovationspolitik" (Demand Oriented Innovation Policy). Berlin: Edition Sigma.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation. (2011) "Naar de top: de hoofdlijnen van het nieuwe bedrijfslevenbeleid" (To the top: starting points for new business policy. Den Haag: Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation&lt;/ref&gt; demand-oriented innovation policy gradually gained momentum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4318">An '''electric tug''' is a battery-powered and pedestrian-operated machine used to '''move heavy loads on wheels.

The machines form part of the [[Material-handling equipment|material handling equipment]] industry that, amongst others, also covers fork lift trucks, overhead cranes and pallet jacks.
Although ‘electric tug’ is perhaps the most commonly used term, suppliers and customers regularly use a range of other names that include towing tractors, battery-powered tugs, electric hand trucks, electric tuggers and pedestrian operated tugs.
The tugs move loads across a single level. They do not lift the load clear of the ground which is why the load must be on wheels. If the load itself does not have wheels, it would be placed on a wheeled platform often referred to as a trolley, bogie or skate. The tug connects to this wheeled platform just as a fork lift truck links to a pallet in order to move a load sat on it.
In most cases a steel coupling (male) attached to the machine itself connects to a corresponding coupling (female) bolted to the load’s bogie. A second bogie or multiple bogies will each have identical female couplings attached to them so that a single male coupling attached to the machine can move them all without alterations.

==Operation==
[[File:Electric tug moving a large cable drum.jpg|thumb|right|Electric tug moving a heavy cable drum]] 
An electric tug relies on the principal of tractive effort. The machine, once secured to the bogie, will lift a portion of the load ensuring the load’s wheels remain on the ground. This is achieved via the machine’s hydraulic mast which is designed to create downforce on the drive wheel immediately beneath it. It is the traction generated from this process that allows the tug to move very large and heavy objects. As a tug does not lift its load clear of the ground it does not have to conform to the [[LOLER|Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998 (LOLER)]], therefore an operator does not need a licence to operate it.

==Applications==
Electric tugs are used in many industry sectors. Some common applications include;

*Retail - To move heavy roll cages from a delivery vehicle’s tail lift to the supermarket’s storeroom or long trains of empty roll cages.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:A small electric tug being used in a retail setting; moving heavy loaded roll cages from a vehicle tail lift to supermarket storeroom.jpg|thumb|right|Electric tug in Retail]] --&gt;
*Healthcare – to move bariatric beds, waste bins (including multiple bins at once), linen cages and gas bottles.
*Pharmaceutical – to move [[Column chromatography|chromatography columns]] within laboratories.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:A stainless steel electric tug moving chromatography columns in a pharmaceutical setting.jpg|thumb|right|Electric tug Pharmaceutical]] --&gt;
*Supermarkets and Airports – to move long trains of empty luggage trolleys.
*Horticulture and Agriculture – to move heavy materials such as top soil or to harvest crops in polytunnels.
*Construction – to move heavy building materials or to access construction sites where diggers and movers cannot due to size restrictions.
*Food and beverage – to move industrial mixing bowls full of product.
*Waste handling - to move containers and waste bins and wheelie bins.
*Manufacturing and Assembly-
 
:*Automotive - To move heavy products such as vehicles down a production line.

:*Glass – To move heavy [[stillage]]s used to hold glass through production.

:*Wind Turbines – Moving turbine blades up to 50 metres in length through production.

:*Aerospace – To move wing assemblies, invar tooling, turnover jigs etc.

'''Evelyn Berezin''' (born April 12, 1925) is an [[United States|American]] [[computer engineer|computer designer]] best known for designing the first computer-driven [[word processor]]. She was also responsible for the first computer-controlled systems for airline reservations.&lt;ref name="wayne"&gt;{{cite book|last = Wayne|first = Tiffany K.|title = American Women of Science Since 1900|year = 2010|publisher = ABC-CLIO|isbn = 9781598841589|pages = 234|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gPGZJ_YuMwgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and contributions==
Berezin started university at [[Hunter College]] in January 1941, studying economics instead of the physics she preferred because it was preferred as a subject for women at that time. After WWII started, new opportunities made the study of physics possible with a scholarship at [[New York University Stern School of Business|New York University]], plus free classes at both Hunter and [[Brooklyn polytechnic|Brooklyn Polytech]] during the war years.  At the same time, she worked full-time during the day as an assistant in the Rheology Department of the Research Division of the International Printing Company (IPI). Going to university at night, she received her B.S. in physics in 1946.

She began graduate work at New York University, holding a fellowship from the United States Atomic Energy Commission. In 1951 she accepted a job with the Electronic Computer Corporation and began there as head of the Logic Design Department. Berezin was the only person doing the logic design for computers being developed by ECC. In 1957 ECC was purchased by Underwood Corporation (originally known as the [[Underwood Typewriter Company]]) . Here, she designed a number of computers which were very general in structure but individual in specific application. Among them was a system for the US Army for range calculations, a system for controlling the distribution of magazines, and also developed what is now considered the first office computer.&lt;ref name="witi"&gt;{{cite web|title = Evelyn Berezin|url = http://www.witi.com/center/witimuseum/halloffame/303047/Evelyn-Berezin-Management-Consultant-Brookhaven-Science-Associates/|work = WITI Hall of Fame|publisher = Women in Technology International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Underwood Typewriter Company was not able to continue the development beyond 1957, and Berezin went to a company called Teleregister where she developed the first computerized banking system and also an airline reservation system which controlled 60 cities in a communication system that provided 1 second response time.

In 1968, Berezin had the idea for a word processor to simplify the work of secretaries, and in 1969 she founded a word processor company, [http://special.lib.umn.edu/findaid/xml/cbi00090-077.xml Redactron Corporation], which became a public company and delivered thousands of systems to customers throughout its international marketing organization. In the 1970s, although the market continued strong the economy suffered a serious inflation, increasing interest rates to a level (16%) which was untenable for a business like Redactron which operated in a world in which equipment was rented. The Company was sold to the [[Burroughs Corporation]], and integrated into its office equipment division. Berezin stayed on until 1979.

In 1980, Berezin served as President of Greenhouse Management Company, General Partner of a venture capital group dedicated to early stage high technology companies.

Throughout her career she has received honorary doctorates from [[Adelphi University]] and [[Eastern Michigan University]]. Berezin has also served on the Boards of [[Cigna|CIGNA]], Standard Microsystems, [[Koppers]], and [[Datapoint]].

Berezin is now retired. She has been on the Board of the Stony Brook Foundation at [[Stony Brook University]], the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] and the Boyce Thompson Institute.&lt;ref name="SION"&gt;{{cite web|title = Sion Power|url = http://www.sionpower.com/board.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berezin established the Berezin-Wilenitz Endowment which will give the value of her estate to fund either a chair, professorship, or research fund at Stony Brook in any field of science as stated in her [[will and testament]].&lt;ref name="StonyBrook" /&gt; In addition to the endowment, Berezin and her late husband funded the Sam and Rose Berezin Endowed Scholarship, a full-tuition scholarship that is awarded to an undergraduate student who plans to study in the field of science, engineering or mathematics, in honor of her parents. Berezin and Wilenitz also established the Israel Wilenitz Endowment, this provides discretionary funds to the Linguistics Department at [[Stony Brook University]], where Wilenitz received a [[Master's Degree]].&lt;ref name="StonyBrook" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Berezin was married for 51 years to Israel Wilenitz, born in 1922 in [[London]]. Wilenitz died on February 20, 2003.&lt;ref name=wilenitz&gt;{{cite web|title=Paid Notice:Deaths WILENITZ, ISRAEL|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/23/classified/paid-notice-deaths-wilenitz-israel.html|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; She currently resides in [[Setauket]] and has an apartment in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=StonyBrook&gt;{{cite web|title=Donor Profiles|url=http://www.givingyourway.org/stonybrook/donor-Wilenitz.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ferring Holding SA''', better known as '''Ferring Pharmaceuticals''', is a multinational [[pharmaceutical company]] that specializes in the development and marketing of [[drugs]] for use in [[human]] [[medicine]].

==History==

The company was founded by [[Frederik Paulsen Sr]] in [[Malmö]], [[Sweden]], in 1950, initially as the '''Nordiska Hormon Laboratoriet''', renamed '''Ferring''' in 1954.  A ''ferring'' in [[North Frisian|Frisian]] is a person from the island [[Föhr]] off the western coast of Germany. Mr. Paulsen's family originates from that island.

The first major breakthrough was the synthetic production of [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]] in 1961. With further growth and expansion, the headquarters moved to [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], and subsequently to [[Switzerland]].

In August 2016, the company announced it would acquire the phase III [[sciatica]] candidate drug - [[Condoliase]] (SI-6603) from [[Seikagaku]] for approximately $95 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/ferring-acquires-sciatica-candidate-from-seikagaku-for-up-to-95m/81253141/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[Image:Ferring St-Prex.jpg|thumb|Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Global Headquarters in [[St-Prex]], Switzerland.]]
Ferring Holding SA headquarters are located in [[Saint-Prex]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name=fhold&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=6711475 businessweek.com: "Pharmaceuticals Company Overview of Ferring Holding SA"], retrieved 26 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  The company holds over 5,000 employees with manufacturing facilities in [[Europe]], [[South America]], [[China]] and has built two new facilities in the [[US]] and in [[India]].

In Copenhagen, Ferring has a R&amp;D centre in the Ferring Tower in [[Ørestad]]. The company has commissioned [[Foster and Partners]] to design a new building in the [[Scanport]] development which is expected to be completed in 2019. It will have area of 30,000 square metres and have room for 750 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business.dk/medico/ferring-bygger-forskningscenter-paa-amager|title=Ferring bygger forskningscenter på Amager|language=Danish|publisher=Berlingske|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferring established a research group at the Ferring Research Institute in [[San Diego, CA]] (USA) in 1996. Ferring assembled a peptide research group that collaborates with academic scientists. The Ferring Research Institute moved to its new home in San Diego in February 2009 with the opening of a 38,000-square-foot facility in [[Sorrento Valley]]. The new facility houses expanded research laboratories for peptide medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, bioanalytical, and pharmacology.
  
In 2012, Ferring Pharmaceuticals funded the Ferring Research Infertility and Gynaecology Grant.

==Products==
Products are used in [[reproductive health]], [[gastroenterology]], [[urology]], [[orthopaedics]] and [[endocrinology]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Energy diversity is essential to long-term socio-economic prosperity.  A diverse energy portfolio, depending on the local availability of natural resources, includes (1) solar, wind, biogas, biomass, ocean, and geothermal energy for power generation; (2) biofuels and renewable hydrocarbons, such as diesel, biodiesel, jet biofuel, and ethanol from biomass, algae, oil-seed plants, and used oil; and (3) electric vehicles powered by renewable energy for transportation.&lt;ref&gt;Maidique, M. and Philippidis, G.

The '''Grazebrook Engine''' is an 1817 [[beam engine]] that was used for blowing air over the hot coals of a [[blast furnace]] to increase the heat. It is now found as sentinel sculpture on the Dartmouth Circus roundabout at the entrance of the [[A38(M)]] in [[Birmingham]], [[England]]. It is believed to be the largest steam engine used in Birmingham.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==History==
It was built in 1817 to the designs of Watt, who had a [[Boulton &amp; Watt|foundry]] in [[Soho, Birmingham]], by [[Grazebrook &amp; Whitehouse]] for their [[Netherton, Worcestershire|Dudley]] foundry in [[Dudley, Worcestershire]]. It provided air for two blast furnaces.{{sfn|Dudley|2015}} In 1912, it was retired, remaining on site as a standby engine. It was dismantled in 1964, and is now displayed on the Dartmouth Circus roundabout at the entrance of the A38(M) (Aston Expressway) and the [[A4540]] (Dartmouth Middleway).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Technical details==
This is a typical example of an early nineteenth century engine, it comprises a vertical double acting steam cylinder coupled via an {{convert|8|m|ft}} rocking beam to a double acting air cylinder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pmsa.org.uk/pmsa-database/5932/#sthash.V1oeUh9s.dpuf| title=PMSA database | website=pmsa.org.uk | location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beam is made of cast iron; it is {{convert|28|ft|m}} long and weighs {{convert|10|LT|tonne}}. The steam cylinder is {{convert|42|in|mm}} in diameter and has a stroke of {{convert|8|ft|m}}. It was designed to run at between 12 and 16 strokes per minute. Steam was provided by a bank of six [[Lancashire boiler]]s. A pressure regulator vessel was fitted to smooth out the air flow. It provided air at {{convert|5|psi|kPa}} to two blast furnaces.{{sfn|Dudley|2015}}

The [[house-built engine|engine house]] was specially built using [[lime mortar]] so that the structure could 'flex' with the movement of the engine.{{sfn|Dudley|2015}}

==Company==
Grazebrook had a works in Peartree Lane, Netherton, possibly during 1952/53.

M. &amp; W. Grazebrook's history can be traced to 1641, when Michael Grazebrook went into business in [[Stourbridge]]. The company had a glassworks in Stourbridge, a forge at [[Halesowen]] in the 1700s and their own colliery in [[Coseley]]. It then focused on iron production and fabrications moving to Netherton in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/Black-Country-s-industrial-1950s-boom-years/story-26407806-detail/story.html#ixzz3cBBfLDlK|title=

A '''heat flux sensor''' is a transducer that generates an electrical signal proportional to the total [[heat transfer|heat rate]] applied to the surface of the sensor. The measured heat rate is divided by the surface area of the sensor to determine the [[heat flux]].
[[File:Silicon encased heat flux sensors.jpg|thumb|Silicon encased heat flux sensor for measurements on rugged surfaces]]
The [[heat flux]] can have different origins; in principle convective, radiative as well as conductive heat can be measured. Heat flux sensors are known under different names, such as heat flux transducers, heat flux gauges, heat flux plates. Some instruments that actually are single-purpose heat flux sensors like [[pyranometers]] for solar radiation measurement. Other heat flux sensors include [[Gardon gauge]]s&lt;ref&gt;R.Gardon, "An instrument for the direct measurement of intense thermal radiation", Rev. Sci. Instrum., 24, 366-370, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as a circular-foil gauge), thin-film [[Thermopile|thermopiles]],&lt;ref&gt;T.E. Diller, Advances in Heat Transfer, Vol. 23, p.297-298, Academic Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and Schmidt-Boelter gauges.&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Kidd and C.G. Nelson, "How the Schmidt-Boelter gage really works," Proc. 41st Int. Instrum. Symp., Research Triangle Park, NC: ISA, 1995, 347-368&lt;/ref&gt; In [[SI]] units, the [[heat transfer|heat rate]] is measured in [[Watt]]s, and the heat flux is computed in [[Watt]]s per meter squared.

== Usage ==
Heat flux sensors are used for a variety of applications. Common applications are studies of building envelope thermal resistance, studies of the effect of fire and flames or laser power measurements. More exotic applications include estimation of fouling on [[boiler]] surfaces, temperature measurement of moving foil material, etc.

The total heat flux is composed of a [[Thermal conduction|conductive]], [[Convective heat transfer|convective]] and [[Thermal radiation|radiative]] part. Depending on the application, one might want to measure all three of these quantities or single one out.

An example of measurement of conductive heat flux is a heat flux plate incorporated into a wall.

An example of measurement of radiative heat flux density is a [[pyranometer]] for measurement of [[solar radiation]].

An example of a sensor sensitive to radiative as well as convective heat flux is a [[Gardon gauge|Gardon]] or Schmidt–Boelter gauge, used for studies of fire and flames.  The [[Gardon gauge|Gardon]] must measure convection perpendicular to the face of the sensor to be accurate due to the circular-foil construction, while the wire-wound geometry of the Schmidt-Boelter gauge can measure both perpendicular and parallel flows.In this case the sensor is mounted on a water-cooled body. Such sensors are used in fire resistance testing to put the fire to which samples are exposed to the right intensity level.

There are various examples of sensors that internally use heat flux sensors examples are [[Thermopile laser sensor|laser power meters]], [[Pyranometer|pyranometers]], etc.

We will discuss three large fields of application in what follows.&lt;ref name="Hukseflux Applications and Specifications"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hukseflux.com/product_group/heat-flux-sensors|title=Example of sensors for different applications|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applications in meteorology and agriculture ===
Soil heat flux is a most important parameter in agro-meteorological studies, since it allows one to study the amount of energy stored in the soil as a function of time.

Typically two or three sensors are buried in the ground around a meteorological station at a depth of around 4&amp;nbsp;cm below the surface. The problems that are encountered in soil are threefold:
: First is the fact that the thermal properties of the soil are constantly changing by absorption and subsequent evaporation of water.
: Second, the flow of water through the soil also represents a flow of energy, going together with a ''thermal shock'', which often is misinterpreted by conventional sensors.
: The third aspect of soil is that by the constant process of wetting and drying and by the animals living on the soil, the quality of the contact between sensor and soil is not known.
The result of all this is the quality of the data in soil heat flux measurement is not under control; the measurement of soil heat flux is considered to be extremely difficult.

=== Applications in building physics ===

In a world ever more concerned with saving energy, studying the thermal properties of buildings has become a growing field of interest. One of the starting points in these studies is the mounting of heat flux sensors on walls in existing buildings or structures built especially for this type of research. Heat flux sensors mounted to building walls or envelope component can monitor the amount of heat energy loss/gain through that component and/or can be used to measure the envelope thermal resistance, [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]], or thermal transmittance, [[U-value]].

The measurement of heat flux in walls is comparable to that in soil in many respects. Two major differences however are the fact that the thermal properties of a wall generally do not change (provided its moisture content does not change) and that it is not always possible to insert the heat flux sensor in the wall, so that it has to be mounted on its inner or outer surface.
When the heat flux sensor has to be mounted on the surface of the wall, one has to take care that the added [[thermal resistance]] is not too large. Also the spectral properties should be matching those of the wall as closely as possible. If the sensor is exposed to [[solar radiation]], this is especially important. In this case one should consider painting the sensor in the same color as the wall. Also in walls the use of self-calibrating heat flux sensors should be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fluxteq.com/thermal-monitoring-of-buildings|title=FluxTeq Heat Flux Sensors {{!}} National Lab-Approved Heat Flux Sensors|website=FluxTeq Heat Flux Sensors {{!}} National Lab-Approved Heat Flux Sensors|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greenTEG application note"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shop.greenteg.com/wp-content/uploads/gSKIN_Application-note_Building-physics_v2.7.pdf|title=greenTEG application note:building physics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applications in medical studies ===

The measurement of the heat exchange of human beings is of importance for medical studies, and when designing clothing, immersion suits and sleeping bags.

A difficulty during this measurement is that the human skin is not particularly suitable for the mounting of heat flux sensors. Also the sensor has to be thin: the skin essentially is a constant temperature heat sink, so added thermal resistance has to be avoided. Another problem is that test persons might be moving. The contact between the test person and the sensor can be lost. For this reason, whenever a high level of quality assurance of the measurement is required, it can be recommended to use a self-calibrating sensor.

=== Applications in industry ===

Photo shows model RC01 with a gold-coated and a black coated heat flux sensor on a metal heat sink. The gold sensor only measures convective heat flux, the black sensor measures radiative as well as convective heat flux. A small air temperature sensor is added to estimate local heat transfer coefficients]]

Heat flux sensors are also used in industrial environments, where temperature and heat flux may be much higher. Examples of these environments are [[aluminium smelting]], [[Concentrated solar power|solar concentrators]], [[Fossil fuel power station|coal fired boilers]], [[Blast furnace|blast furnaces]], [[Gas flare|flare systems]], [[Fluidized bed|fluidized beds]], [[Coker unit|cokers]],...

== Properties ==

A heat flux sensor should measure the local heat flux density in one direction. The result is expressed in watts per square meter. The calculation is done according to:

&lt;math&gt;\phi_q =\frac{V_{\mathrm{sen}}}{E_{\mathrm{sen}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{sen}}&lt;/math&gt; is the sensor output and &lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{sen}}&lt;/math&gt; is the calibration constant, specific for the sensor.

[[Image:generalhfsensor.png|thumb|250px|left|General characteristics of a heat flux sensor.]]

As shown before in the figure to the left, heat flux sensors generally have the shape of a flat plate and a sensitivity in the direction perpendicular to the sensor surface.

Usually a number of [[thermocouple]]s connected in series called thermopiles are used. General advantages of thermopiles are their stability, low ohmic value (which implies little pickup of electromagnetic disturbances), good signal-noise ratio and the fact that zero input gives zero output. Disadvantageous is the low sensitivity.

For better understanding of heat flux sensor behavior, it can be modeled as a simple electrical circuit consisting of a resistance, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, and a capacitor, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. In this way it can be seen that one can attribute a thermal resistance &lt;math&gt;R_{\mathrm{sen}}&lt;/math&gt;, a thermal capacity &lt;math&gt;C_{\mathrm{sen}}&lt;/math&gt; and also a response time &lt;math&gt;\tau_{\mathrm{sen}}&lt;/math&gt; to the sensor.

Usually, the thermal resistance and the thermal capacity of the entire heat flux sensor are equal to those of the filling material. Stretching the analogy with the electric circuit further, one arrives at the following expression for the response time:

&lt;math&gt;\tau_{\mathrm{sen}} = R_{\mathrm{sen}} C_{\mathrm{sen}}  = \frac{d^2 \rho C_p}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

In which &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the sensor thickness, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; the density, &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; the specific heat capacity and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; the thermal conductivity. From this formula one can conclude that material properties of the filling material and dimensions are determining the response time.
As a rule of thumb, the response time is proportional to the thickness to the power of two.

[[File:Hukseflux radiationmeasurement sbg01 photo.jpg|thumb|right|331x331px|Gardon or Schmidt Boelter gauge showing the instrument main components: metal body, black sensor, water cooling pipe in and out, mounting flange, and cable. Dimensions: diameter housing is 25mm. Photo shows model SBG01.]]

Other parameters that are determining sensor properties are the electrical characteristics of the thermocouple. The temperature dependence of the thermocouple causes the temperature dependence and the non-linearity of the heat flux sensor. The non linearity at a certain temperature is in fact the derivative of the temperature dependence at that temperature.

However, a well designed sensor may have a lower temperature dependence and better linearity than expected. There are two ways of achieving this:
:As a first possibility, the thermal dependence of conductivity of the filling material and of the thermocouple material can be used to counterbalance the temperature dependence of the voltage that is generated by the thermopile.
:Another possibility to minimize the temperature dependence of a heat flux sensor, is to use a resistance network with an incorporated thermistor. The temperature dependence of the thermistor will balance the temperature dependence of the thermopile.

Another factor that determines heat flux sensor behavior, is the construction of the sensor. In particular some designs have a strongly nonuniform sensitivity. Others even exhibit a sensitivity to lateral fluxes. The sensor schematically given in the above figure would for example also be sensitive to heat flows from left to right. This type of behavior will not cause problems as long as fluxes are uniform and in one direction only.

[[Image:sandwichconstruction.png|thumb|250px|left|Sandwich construction.]]

To promote uniformity of sensitivity, a so-called sandwich construction as shown in the figure to the left can be used. The purpose of the plates, which have a high conductivity, is to promote the transport of heat across the whole sensitive surface.

It is difficult to quantify non-uniformity and sensitivity to lateral fluxes. Some sensors are equipped with an extra electrical lead, splitting the sensor into two parts. If during application, there is non-uniform behavior of the sensor or the flux, this will result in different outputs of the two parts.

Summarizing: The intrinsic specifications that can be attributed to heat flux sensors are thermal conductivity, total thermal resistance, heat capacity, response time, non linearity, stability, temperature dependence of sensitivity, uniformity of sensitivity and sensitivity to lateral fluxes. For the latter two specifications, a good method for quantification is not known.

== Calibration of thin heat flux transducers ==
In order to do in-situ measurements, the user must be provided with the correct calibration constant &lt;math&gt;E_{sen}&lt;/math&gt;. This constant is also called ''sensitivity''. The sensitivity is primarily determined by the sensor construction and operation temperatures, but also by the geometry and material properties of the object that is measured. Therefore the sensor should be calibrated under conditions that are close to the conditions of the intended application. The calibration set-up should also be properly shielded to limit external influences. 

=== Preparation ===
To do a calibration measurement, one needs a voltmeter or datalogger with resolution of ±2μV or better. One should avoid air gaps between layers in the test stack. These can be filled with filling materials, like toothpaste, caulk or putty. If need be, thermally conductive gel can be used to improve contact between layers&lt;ref name="ASTM C 1130"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.astm.org/Standards/C1130.htm|title=ASTM C1130-17 Standard Practice for Calibration of Thin Heat Flux Transducers|date=2017|publisher=[[ASTM International]] (ASTM)|edition=1.0|access-date=2018-05-30|orig-year=2017-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123004608/https://www.astm.org/Standards/C1130.htm|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A temperature sensor should be placed on or near the sensor, and connected to a readout device.

=== Measuring ===
The calibration is done by applying a controlled heat flux through the sensor. By varying the hot and cold sides of the stack, and measuring the voltages of the heat flux sensor and temperature sensor, the correct sensitivity can be determined with:

&lt;math&gt;E_{sen} = \frac{V_{sen}}{\phi_{q}} &lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;V_{sen}&lt;/math&gt; is the sensor output and &lt;math&gt;\phi_{q}&lt;/math&gt; is the known heat flux through the sensor. 

If the sensor is mounted onto a surface and is exposed to convection and radiation during the expected applications, the same conditions should be taken into account during calibration.  

Doing measurements at different temperatures allows for determining sensitivity as a function of the temperature. 

=== In-Situ calibration ===
[[File:FHF02SC heat flux sensor self calibrating.jpg|alt=The image shows the FHF02SC, a thin self-calibrating heat flux sensor. The sensor area is a rounded square, with a metal attachment coming of the bottom housing the cable. On the square are traces of the heater running left and right.|thumb|300x300px|FHF02SC, a thin self-calibrating heat flux sensor. Sensors that are embedded in construction can sometimes be very troublesome to remove if need to be re-calibrated (in a lab). Some sensors incorporate heaters in order to be able to leave the sensor in place while performing a re-calibration.]]
While heat flux sensors are typically supplied with a sensitivity by the manufacturer, there are times and situations that call for a re-calibration of the sensor. Especially in building walls or envelopes the heat flux sensors can not be removed after the initial installation or may be very difficult te reach. In order to calibrate the sensor, some come with an integrated heater with specified characteristics. By applying a known voltage on and current through the heater, a controlled heat flux is provided which can be used to calculate the new sensitivity.

== Error sources ==

The interpretation of measurement results of heat flux sensors is often done assuming that the phenomenon that is studied, is quasi-static and taking place in a direction transversal to the sensor surface.
Dynamic effects and lateral fluxes are possible error sources.

=== Dynamic effects ===

The assumption that conditions are quasi-static should be related to the response time of the detector.

The case that the heat flux sensor is used as a radiation detector (see figure to the left) will serve to illustrate the effect of changing fluxes. Assuming that the cold joints of the sensor are at a constant temperature, and an energy flows from &lt;math&gt;t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the sensor response is:
&lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{sen}} = E_{\mathrm{sen}} \left( 1 - e^{- \frac{t}{\tau_{\mathrm{sen}}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

This shows that one should expect a false reading during a period that equals several response times, &lt;math&gt;\tau_{\mathrm{sen}}&lt;/math&gt;. Generally heat flux sensors are quite slow, and will need several minutes to reach 95% response. This is the reason why one prefers to work with values that are integrated over a long period; during this period the sensor signal will go up and down. The assumption is that errors due to long response times will cancel. The upgoing signal will give an error, the downgoing signal will produce an equally large error with a different sign. This will be valid only if periods with stable heat flow prevail.

In order to avoid errors caused by long response times, one should use sensors with low value of &lt;math&gt;R_{\mathrm{sen}}C_{\mathrm{sen}}&lt;/math&gt;, since this product determines the response time. In other words: sensors with low mass or small thickness.

The sensor response time equation above holds as long as the cold joints are at a constant temperature. An unexpected result shows when the temperature of the sensor changes.

Assuming that the sensor temperature starts changing at the cold joints, at a rate of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;, starting at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tau_{\mathrm{sen}}&lt;/math&gt; is the sensor response time, the reaction to this is:&lt;!--whatever it is, it appears to be MISSING here--&gt;

[[File:Pidgin 2.0 contact window.png|thumb|A [[buddy list]] in [[Pidgin (software)|Pidgin]] 2.0]]
'''Instant messaging''' ('''IM''') technology is a type of [[online chat]] that offers [[real-time text]] transmission over the [[Internet]]. A [[LAN messenger]] operates in a similar way over a [[local area network]]. Short messages are typically transmitted between two parties, when each user chooses to complete a thought and select "send". Some IM [[application (computing)|applications]] can use [[push technology]] to provide [[real-time text]], which transmits messages character by character, as they are composed. More advanced instant messaging can add [[file transfer]], clickable [[hyperlink]]s, [[Voice over IP]], or [[video chat]].

Non-IM types of chat include [[multicast]] transmission, usually referred to as "chat rooms", where participants might be anonymous or might be previously known to each other (for example collaborators on a project that is using chat to facilitate communication). Instant messaging systems tend to facilitate connections between specified known users (often using a contact list also known as a "buddy list" or "friend list"). Depending on the IM protocol, the technical architecture can be [[peer-to-peer]] (direct [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] transmission) or [[client-server]] (an [[Instant message service center]] retransmits messages from the sender to the communication device).

By 2010, instant messaging over the Web was already in sharp decline,&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=Jon|title=Instant messaging: This conversation is terminated|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8698174.stm|accessdate=14 March 2018|agency=BBC|date=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of messaging features on social networks such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]].  The most popular IM platforms, such as [[AIM (software)|AIM]], closed in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://help.aol.com/articles/aim-discontinued|title=AIM has been discontinued as of December 15, 2017|website=https://help.aol.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Windows Live Messenger]] was merged into Skype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28987797|title=MSN Messenger to end after 15 years|date=29 August 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, most instant messaging takes place on [[messaging apps]] (such as [[WhatsApp]], [[Facebook Messenger]], [[WeChat]], and [[Viber]]), which by 2014 had more users than social networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The rise of messaging platforms|url=https://chatbotnewsdaily.com/the-rise-of-messenger-platforms-and-its-legal-implications-62fe73355122|publisher=The Economist, via Chatbot News Daily|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
Instant messaging is a set of  communication technologies used for text-based communication between two or more participants over the Internet or other types of [[computer network|network]]s. IM–chat happens in real-time. Of importance is that online chat and instant messaging differ from other technologies such as email due to the perceived quasi-[[Synchronization|synchrony]] of the communications by the users. Some systems permit messages to be sent to users not then 'logged on' (''offline messages''), thus removing some differences between IM and email (often done by sending the message to the associated email account).

IM allows effective and efficient communication, allowing immediate receipt of acknowledgment or reply. However IM is basically not necessarily supported by [[transaction processing|transaction control]]. In many cases, instant messaging includes added features which can make it even more popular. For example, users may see each other via [[webcam]]s, or talk directly for free over the Internet using a [[microphone]] and [[headphone]]s or loudspeakers. Many applications allow file transfers, although they are usually limited in the permissible file-size.

It is usually possible to save a text conversation for later reference. Instant messages are often logged in a local message history, making it similar to the persistent nature of emails.

== History ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2012}}
[[File:Unix talk screenshot 01.png|thumb|300px|[[Command-line]] Unix "[[talk (software)|talk]]", using a split screen [[user interface]], was popular in the 1980s and early 1990s.]]
[[File:PLATO-Talkomatic.png|thumb|2014 recreation screenshot of the original Talkomatic program, released in 1973, on the PLATO system (on an orange plasma display).]]

Though the term dates from the 1990s, instant messaging predates the Internet, first appearing on [[multi-user]] [[operating system]]s like [[Compatible Time-Sharing System]] (CTSS) and Multiplexed Information and Computing Service ([[Multics]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Van Vleck |url=http://www.multicians.org/thvv/mail-history.html |title=Instant Messaging on CTSS and Multics |publisher=Multicians.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-1960s. Initially, some of these systems were used as notification systems for services like printing, but quickly were used to facilitate communication with other users logged into the same machine. As networks developed, the protocols spread with the networks. Some of these used a [[peer-to-peer]] protocol (e.g. [[talk (software)|talk]], ntalk and ytalk), while others required peers to connect to a server (see [[talker]] and [[IRC]]). The [[Zephyr (protocol)|Zephyr Notification Service]] (still in use at some institutions) was invented at MIT's [[Project Athena]] in the 1980s to allow service providers to locate and send messages to users.

Parallel to instant messaging were early [[online chat]] facilities, the earliest of which was [[Talkomatic]] (1973) on the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] system, which allowed 5 people to chat simultaneously on a 512x512 plasma display (5 lines of text + 1 status line per person). During the [[bulletin board system]] (BBS) phenomenon that peaked during the 1980s, some systems incorporated chat features which were similar to instant messaging; Freelancin' Roundtable was one prime example. The first&lt;ref&gt;CompuServe Innovator Resigns After 25 Years, The Columbus Dispatch, May 11, 1996, p. 2F&lt;/ref&gt; such general-availability commercial online chat service (as opposed to PLATO, which was educational) was the CompuServe [[CB Simulator]] in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;Wired and Inspired, The Columbus Dispatch (Business page), by Mike Pramik, November 12, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; created by [[CompuServe]] executive Alexander "Sandy" Trevor in [[Columbus, Ohio]].

Early instant messaging programs were primarily [[real-time text]], where characters appeared as they were typed. This includes the Unix [[talk (software)|"talk"]] command line program, which was popular in the 1980s and early 1990s. Some BBS chat programs (i.e. [[Celerity BBS]]) also used a similar interface. Modern implementations of real-time text also exist in instant messengers, such as AOL's Real-Time IM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://help.aol.com/help/microsites/microsite.do?cmd=displayKC&amp;docType=kc&amp;externalId=223568 |title=AOL Instant Messenger's Real-Time IM feature |publisher=Help.aol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312102140/http://help.aol.com/help/microsites/microsite.do?cmd=displayKC&amp;docType=kc&amp;externalId=223568 |archivedate=March 12, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as an optional feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realjabber.org/real_time_text_demo.html |title=RealJabber.org's animation of real-time text |publisher=Realjabber.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter half of the 1980s and into the early 1990s, the [[Quantum Link]] online service for [[Commodore 64]] computers offered user-to-user messages between concurrently connected customers, which they called "On-Line Messages" (or OLM for short), and later "FlashMail." (Quantum Link later became [[America Online]] and made [[AOL Instant Messenger]] (AIM, discussed later). While the Quantum Link client software ran on a [[Commodore 64]], using only the Commodore's [[PETSCII]] text-graphics, the screen was visually divided into sections and OLMs would appear as a yellow bar saying "Message From:" and the name of the sender along with the message across the top of whatever the user was already doing, and presented a list of options for responding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qlinklives.org/qlink-old/liz1.jpg |title=Screenshot of a Quantum Link OLM |date= |accessdate=2012-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619055644/http://www.qlinklives.org/qlink-old/liz1.jpg |archivedate=June 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it could be considered a type of [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), albeit much more primitive than the later [[X Window System|Unix]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Macintosh]] based GUI IM software. OLMs were what Q-Link called "Plus Services" meaning they charged an extra per-minute fee on top of the monthly Q-Link access costs.

Modern, Internet-wide, GUI-based messaging clients as they are known today, began to take off in the mid-1990s with [[PowWow (chat program)|PowWow]], [[ICQ]], and AOL Instant Messenger. Similar functionality was offered by [[CU-SeeMe]] in 1992; though primarily an audio/video chat link, users could also send textual messages to each other. [[AOL]] later acquired [[Mirabilis (company)|Mirabilis]], the authors of ICQ; a few years later ICQ (then owned by AOL) was awarded two patents for instant messaging by the U.S. patent office. Meanwhile, other companies developed their own software; ([[Excite]], [[MSN]], [[Ubique (company)|Ubique]], and [[Yahoo!]]), each with its own [[proprietary protocol|proprietary]] [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] and [[software client|client]]; users therefore had to run multiple client applications if they wished to use more than one of these networks. In 1998, IBM released [[IBM Lotus Sametime]], a product based on technology acquired when IBM bought Haifa-based [[Ubique (company)|Ubique]] and Lexington-based Databeam.

In 2000, an [[open-source software|open-source application]] and [[open standards]]-based protocol called [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|Jabber]] was launched. The protocol was standardized under the name [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol]] (XMPP). XMPP servers could act as gateways to other IM protocols, reducing the need to run multiple clients. Multi-protocol clients can use any of the popular IM protocols by using additional local libraries for each protocol. IBM Lotus Sametime's November 2007 release added [[IBM Lotus Sametime Gateway]] support for XMPP.

As of 2010, [[social network service|social networking]] providers often offer IM abilities. [[Facebook Chat]] is a form of instant messaging, and [[Twitter]] can be thought of as a [[Web 2.0]] instant messaging system. Similar server-side chat features are part of most [[dating website]]s, such as [[OKCupid]] or [[PlentyofFish]]. The spread of [[smartphone]]s and similar devices in the late 2000s also caused increased competition with conventional instant messaging, by making [[text messaging]] services still more ubiquitous.

Many instant messaging services offer [[videotelephone|video calling]] features, [[voice over IP]] and [[web conferencing]] services. Web conferencing services can integrate both video calling and instant messaging abilities. Some instant messaging companies are also offering [[desktop sharing]], IP radio, and [[IPTV]] to the voice and video features.

The term "Instant Messenger" is a [[service mark]] of [[Time Warner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/foia/ttab/decsum/2006/16jan06.pdf |title=Summary Of Final Decisions Issued By The Trademark Trial And Appeal Board |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may not be used in software not affiliated with AOL in the United States. For this reason, in April 2007, the instant messaging client formerly named [[Gaim]] (or gaim) announced that they would be renamed "[[Pidgin (software)|Pidgin]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pidgin.im/index.php?id=177 "Important and Long Delayed News"], Announcement of [[Gaim]] renaming (to [[Pidgin]]), April 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s: Messaging apps replace IM===
In the 2010s, more people started to use messaging apps like [[WhatsApp]], [[WeChat]], [[Facebook Messenger]] and [[Line (software)|Line]] than instant messaging like AIM. For example, WhatsApp was founded in 2009, and Facebook acquired in 2014, by which time it already had half a billion users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2014/04/22/whatsapp-hits-500-million-users/|title=WhatsApp Hits 500 Million Users|first=Amit|last=Chowdhry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clients ==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
{{See also|Comparison of instant messaging clients}}
Each modern IM service generally provides its own client, either a separately installed piece of software, or a [[browser-based]] client. These usually only work within the same IM network, although some allow limited function with other services. Third party client software applications exist that will connect with most of the major IM services.

[[File:Pidgin Screenshot Ubuntu.png|thumb|200px|left|Pidgin's tabbed chat window in Linux]]

Standard complementary instant messaging applications offer functions like file transfer, contact list(s), the ability to hold several simultaneous conversations, etc. These may be all the functions that a small business needs, but larger organizations will require more sophisticated applications that can work together. The solution to finding applications capable of this is to use enterprise versions of instant messaging applications. These include titles like XMPP, [[Lotus Sametime]], [[Microsoft Office Communicator]], etc., which are often integrated with other enterprise applications such as workflow systems. These enterprise applications, or [[enterprise application integration]] (EAI), are built to certain constraints, namely storing data in a common format.

There have been several attempts to create a unified standard for instant messaging: [[IETF]]'s [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) and [[SIMPLE (instant messaging protocol)|SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions]] (SIMPLE), [[Application Exchange]] (APEX), [[Instant Messaging and Presence Protocol]] (IMPP), the open [[XML]]-based [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol]] (XMPP), and [[Open Mobile Alliance]]'s [[Instant Messaging and Presence Service]] developed specifically for mobile devices.

Most attempts at producing a unified standard for the major IM providers (AOL, [[Yahoo!]] and [[Microsoft]]) have failed, and each continues to use its own [[proprietary protocol]].

However, while discussions at IETF were stalled, [[Reuters]] signed the first inter-service provider connectivity agreement in September 2003. This agreement enabled AIM, ICQ and [[MSN Messenger]] users to talk with [[Reuters Messaging]] counterparts and vice versa. Following this, Microsoft, Yahoo! and AOL agreed to a deal in which Microsoft's [[Live Communications Server 2005]] users would also have the possibility to talk to public instant messaging users. This deal established SIP/SIMPLE as a standard for protocol interoperability and established a connectivity fee for accessing public instant messaging groups or services.&lt;!--“cloud(s)” is ambiguous marketing-buzz hype--&gt; Separately, on October 13, 2005, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced that by the 3rd quarter of 2006 they would interoperate using SIP/SIMPLE, which was followed, in December 2005, by the AOL and [[Google]] strategic partnership deal in which [[Google Talk]] users would be able to communicate with AIM and ICQ users provided they have an AIM account.

There are two ways to combine the many disparate protocols:
* Combine the many disparate protocols inside the IM ''[[client (computing)|client application]]''.
* Combine the many disparate protocols inside the IM ''server'' application. This approach moves the task of communicating with the other services to the server. Clients need not know or care about other IM protocols. For example, [[Live Communications Server 2005|LCS 2005]] Public IM Connectivity. This approach is popular in XMPP servers; however, the so-called transport projects suffer the same [[reverse engineering]] difficulties as any other project involved with closed protocols or formats.

Some approaches allow organizations to deploy their own, private instant messaging network by enabling them to restrict access to the [[Server (computing)|server]] (often with the IM network entirely behind their [[firewall (computing)|firewall]]) and administer user permissions. Other corporate messaging systems allow registered users to also connect from outside the corporation LAN, by using an encrypted, firewall-friendly, HTTPS-based protocol. Usually, a dedicated corporate IM server has several advantages, such as pre-populated contact lists, integrated authentication, and better security and privacy.

Certain networks have made changes to prevent them from being used by such multi-network IM clients. For example, [[Trillian (instant messenger)|Trillian]] had to release several revisions and [[patch (computing)|patches]] to allow its users to access the MSN, AOL, and Yahoo! networks, after changes were made to these networks. The major IM providers usually cite the need for formal agreements, and [[computer security|security]] concerns as reasons for making these changes.

The use of [[proprietary protocol]]s has meant that many instant messaging networks have been incompatible and users have been unable to reach users on other networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://sameroom.io/chat-timeline.pdf|title=A Brief History of Chat Services|publisher=sameroom.io}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have allowed [[social networking]] with IM-like features and [[text messaging]] an opportunity to gain market share at the expense of IM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8698174.stm | work=BBC News | title=The decline of instant messaging | date=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IM language ==
{{See also|SMS language}}
Users sometimes make use of [[internet slang]] or [[text messaging#Effect on language|text speak]] to abbreviate common words or expressions to quicken conversations or reduce keystrokes. The language has become widespread, with well-known expressions such as 'lol' translated over to face-to-face language.

Emotions are often expressed in shorthand, such as the abbreviation [[LOL]], [[Internet slang|BRB and TTYL]]; respectively laugh(ing) out loud, be right back, and talk to you later.

Some, however, attempt to be more accurate with [[emotional expression]] over IM. Real time reactions such as (''chortle'') (''snort'') (''guffaw'') or (''eye-roll'') are becoming more popular. Also there are certain standards that are being introduced into mainstream conversations including, '#' indicates the use of sarcasm in a statement and '*' which indicates a spelling mistake and/or grammatical error in the prior message, followed by a correction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.networkdictionary.com/index.php/Instant_Messenging instant messaging] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212114903/http://wiki.networkdictionary.com/index.php/Instant_Messenging |date=February 12, 2010 }}, NetworkDictionary.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business application ==
Instant messaging has proven to be similar to personal computers, email, and the [[World Wide Web]], in that its adoption for use as a business communications medium was driven primarily by individual employees using consumer software at work, rather than by formal mandate or provisioning by corporate information technology departments. Tens of millions of the consumer IM accounts in use are being used for business purposes by employees of companies and other organizations.

In response to the demand for business-grade IM and the need to ensure security and legal compliance, a new type of instant messaging, called "Enterprise Instant Messaging" ("EIM") was created when [[Lotus Software]] launched IBM Lotus Sametime in 1998. Microsoft followed suit shortly thereafter with [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]] Instant Messaging, later created a new platform called [[Microsoft Office Live Communications Server]], and released [[Office Communications Server]] 2007 in October 2007. [[Oracle Corporation]] has also jumped into the market recently with its [[Oracle Beehive]] unified collaboration software.&lt;ref name="Oracle Beehive offers enterprise instant messaging"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cmswire.com/cms/enterprise-20/oracle-buzzes-with-updates-for-its-beehive-collaboration-platform-004538.php | title=Oracle Buzzes with Updates for its Beehive Collaboration Platform | publisher=CMSWire| date=May 12, 2018 | accessdate=October 16, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both IBM Lotus and Microsoft have introduced federation between their EIM systems and some of the public IM networks so that employees may use one interface to both their internal EIM system and their contacts on AOL, MSN, and Yahoo. As of 2010, leading EIM platforms include [[IBM Lotus Sametime]], [[Microsoft Office Communications Server]], Jabber XCP and Cisco Unified Presence.{{third-party inline|date=July 2016}} Industry-focused EIM platforms such as [[Reuters Messaging]] and [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg Messaging]] also provide IM abilities to financial services companies.{{third-party inline|date=July 2016}}

The adoption of IM across corporate networks outside of the control of IT organizations creates risks and liabilities for companies who do not effectively manage and support IM use. Companies implement specialized IM archiving and security products and services to mitigate these risks and provide safe, secure, productive instant messaging abilities to their employees. IM is increasingly becoming a feature of [[enterprise software]] rather than a stand-alone application.

== Types of products ==
IM products can usually be categorised into two types: Enterprise Instant Messaging (EIM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://im.about.com/od/imforbusiness/a/topbizims.htm |title=Better Business IMs - Business Technology |publisher=Im.about.com |date=2012-04-10 |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Consumer Instant Messaging (CIM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://im.about.com/b/2008/03/15/reader-questions-im-privacy-at-work.htm |title=Reader Questions IM Privacy at Work |publisher=Im.about.com |date=2008-03-15 |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enterprise solutions use an internal IM server, however this isn't always feasible, particularly for smaller businesses with limited budgets. The second option, using a CIM provides the advantage of being inexpensive to implement and has little need for investing in new hardware or server software.

For corporate use, encryption and conversation archiving are usually regarded as important features due to security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.schneier.com/cryptography/paperfiles/worldwide-survey-of-encryption-products.pdf|title=Multi-Encrypting Messengers – in: A Worldwide Survey of Encryption Products,|author=Schneier, Bruce / Seidel, Kathleen / Vijayakumar, Saranya |date=11 February 2016|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a bunch of open source encrypting messengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sf.net/projects/goldbug/files/bigseven-crypto-audit.pdf|title=BIG SEVEN Study, open source crypto-messengers to be compared - or: Comprehensive Confidentiality Review &amp; Audit: Encrypting E-Mail-Client &amp; Secure Instant Messenger, Descriptions, tests and analysis reviews of 20 functions of the applications based on the essential fields and methods of evaluation of the 8 major international audit manuals for IT security investigations including 38 figures and 87 tables|author=Adams, David / Maier, Ann-Kathrin|website= |date=6 June 2016|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the use of different operating systems in organizations requires use of software that supports more than one platform. For example, many software companies use [[Windows]] in administration departments but have software developers who use [[Linux]].

An '''Instant Message Service Center''' ('''IMSC''') is a network element in the [[mobile phone|mobile telephone]] network which delivers instant messages. When a user sends an IM message to another user, the phone sends the message to the IMSC.  The IMSC stores the message and delivers it to the destination user when they are available. The IMSC usually has a configurable time limit for how long it will store the message. Few companies who make many of the IMSCs in use in the [[GSM]] world are Miyowa, [[Followap]] and OZ. Other players include [[Acision]], Colibria, [[Ericsson]], [[Nokia]], [[Comverse Technology]], Now Wireless, Jinny Software, Miyowa, Feelingk and few others.

=== Serverless messengers ===
Major IM services are controlled by their corresponding companies. They usually follow the [[client-server]] model when all clients have to first connect to the central server. This requires users to trust this server because messages can generally be accessed by the company. Companies can be compelled to reveal their user's communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/05/26/skype_in_belgium_court_summons_microsoft/|title=Skype hauled into court after refusing to hand call records to cops|website=[[The Register]]|date=26 May 2015|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies can also suspend user accounts for any reason. There is the class of instant messengers that uses the [[serverless computing|serverless]] model, which doesn't require servers, and the IM network consists only of clients. There are several serverless messengers: [[RetroShare]], [[Tox (protocol)|Tox]], [[Bitmessage]], [[Ricochet (software)|Ricochet]], [[Ring (software)|Ring]]. Serverless messengers are generally more secure because they involve fewer parties.

==Conversational commerce==
{{Main|Conversational commerce}}
Conversational commerce is [[e-commerce]] via various means of messaging:

*[[live chat]] on e-commerce [[Web sites]], 
*live chat on messaging apps such as [[WeChat]], [[Facebook Messenger]] and [[WhatsApp]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/omnichannel-cross-channel-strategies/retail-s-big-opportunity-87-of-u-s-consumers-grasp-the-power-of-conversational-commerce|title=Retail’s Big Opportunity: 87% Of U.S. Consumers Grasp The Power Of Conversational Commerce - Retail TouchPoints|first=Glenn|last=Taylor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[chatbots]] on messaging apps or Web sites
* via [[voice assistants]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/06/how-to-prepare-your-products-and-brand-for-conversational-commerce/|title=How to prepare your products and brand for conversational commerce|date=6 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Security risks ==
{{See also|Secure instant messaging}}
Crackers (malicious or [[black hat]] hackers) have consistently used IM networks as vectors for delivering [[phishing]] attempts, "poison URLs", and virus-laden file attachments from 2004 to the present, with over 1100 discrete attacks listed by the IM Security Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imsecuritycenter.com|title=IM Security Center|accessdate=May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004–2007. Hackers use two methods of delivering malicious code through IM: delivery of viruses, [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]]s, or [[spyware]] within an infected file, and the use of "socially engineered" text with a [[Uniform Resource Locator|web address]] that entices the recipient to click on a URL connecting him or her to a website that then downloads malicious code.

Viruses, [[computer worm]]s, and trojans usually propagate by sending themselves rapidly through the infected user's [[contact list]]. An effective attack using a poisoned [[URL]] may reach tens of thousands of users in a short period when each user's contact list receives messages appearing to be from a trusted friend. The recipients click on the web address, and the entire cycle starts again. Infections may range from nuisance to criminal, and are becoming more sophisticated each year.

IM connections sometimes occur in [[plain text]], making them vulnerable to eavesdropping. Also, IM client software often requires the user to expose open [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] ports to the world, raising the threat posed by potential security vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Why just say no to IM at work|journal=blog.anta.net|date=October 29, 2009|url=http://blog.anta.net/2009/10/28/why-just-say-no-to-im-at-work/|issn=1797-1993|accessdate=October 29, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726135708/http://blog.anta.net/2009/10/28/why-just-say-no-to-im-at-work/|archivedate=July 26, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compliance risks ==
In addition to the malicious code threat, the use of instant messaging at work also creates a risk of non-compliance to laws and regulations governing use of electronic communications in businesses.

=== In the United States ===
In the United States alone there are over 10,000 laws and regulations related to electronic messaging and records retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid5_gci906152,00.html|title=ESG compliance report excerpt, Part 1: Introduction |accessdate=May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The better-known of these include the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]], [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]], and SEC 17a-3.

Clarification from the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA) was issued to member firms in the financial services industry in December, 2007, noting that "electronic communications", "email", and "electronic correspondence" may be used interchangeably and can include such forms of electronic messaging as ''instant messaging'' and [[text messaging]].&lt;ref&gt;FINRA, Regulatory Notice 07-59, Supervision of Electronic Communications, December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Changes to [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]], effective December 1, 2006, created a new category for electronic records which may be requested during [[discovery (law)|discovery]] in legal proceedings.

=== World-wide ===
Most nations also regulate use of electronic messaging and electronic records retention in similar fashion as the United States. The most common regulations related to IM at work involve the need to produce archived business communications to satisfy government or judicial requests under law. Many instant messaging communications fall into the category of business communications that must be archived and retrievable.

== Security and archiving ==
{{See also|Secure instant messaging}}
In the early 2000s, a new class of IT security provider emerged to provide remedies for the risks and liabilities faced by corporations who chose to use IM for business communications. The IM security providers created new products to be installed in corporate networks for the purpose of archiving, content-scanning, and security-scanning IM traffic moving in and out of the corporation. Similar to the [[e-mail filtering]] vendors, the IM security providers focus on the risks and liabilities described above.

With rapid adoption of IM in the workplace, demand for IM security products began to grow in the mid-2000s. By 2007, the preferred platform for the purchase of security software had become the "[[computer appliance]]", according to IDC, who estimate that by 2008, 80% of [[network security]] products will be delivered via an appliance.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Christiansen and Rose Ryan, International Data Corp., "IDC Telebriefing: Threat Management Security Appliance Review and Forecast"&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2014 however, the level of safety offered by instant messengers was still extremely poor. According to a scorecard made by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], only 7 out of 39 instant messengers received a perfect score, whereas the most popular instant messengers at the time only attained a score of 2 out of 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/nov/06/secure-messaging-app-eff-imessage-snapchat|title=How secure is your favourite messaging app?

KDS develops Neo, a cloud-based tool which enables business users to search and book complete door-to-door itineraries, instead of the traditional way of booking individual components. Using Neo, employees also manage business expenses through a calendar-based view instead of the common spreadsheet or line-item report approach.

==History==
Yves Weisselberger founded KDS&lt;ref&gt;KDS for Klee Data System&lt;/ref&gt; in 1994. In 2011, Weisselberger stepped down as [[chief executive officer|CEO]] and chose Dean Forbes as his replacement.&lt;ref name=tnooz3/&gt; Weisselberger chose Forbes to take his position because of Forbes's outside perspective.&lt;ref name=tnooz3/&gt;

KDS launched Neo, a self-booking tool in January 2013.&lt;ref name=businesstravelnews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesstravelnews.com/More-News/KDS-Clients-Impressed-By-New-Booking-Tool/?ida=Technology&amp;a=mgmt|title=KDS Clients Impressed By New Booking Tool|author=Amon Cohen|work=Business Travel News|date=2013-02-07|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tool was developed on the concept of booking an entire trip from door to door with a departure location, destination, and required time of arrival.&lt;ref name=businesstravelnews/&gt; The company also partnered with various payment partners to expand payment methods for transactions completed in the booking tool and a variety of travel inventory suppliers beyond air, rail and hotel to connect such as [[Groundscope]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.travolution.com/articles/16021/tte-2016-kds-open-api-attracts-suppliers-to-new-travel-industry-content-hub|title=KDS open API attracts suppliers to new travel industry content hub|last=|first=|date=|website=Travolution|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Snapcar]], [[Addison Lee]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://buyingbusinesstravel.com/news/1625327-kds-announces-addison-lee-partnership|title=KDS announces Addison Lee partnership|website=buyingbusinesstravel.com|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Booking.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://buyingbusinesstravel.com/news/1325946-kds-strikes-bookingcom-deal|title=KDS strikes Booking.com deal|website=buyingbusinesstravel.com|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013, KDS signed a five-year contract with Orange, a mobile network operator and internet provider in [[France]], allowing Orange to use Neo for its business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buyingbusinesstravel.com/news/0521335-orange-agrees-use-kds-travel-tool|title=Orange agrees to use KDS travel tool|author=Rob Gill|work=Buying Business Travel|date=2013-09-05|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smart-mobilitymanagement.com/orange_signs_with_kds_for_its_travel_expense_solution_55122-en-422-185307.html|title=

On January 29, 2014, the company's booking tool gained access to [[Renfe Operadora]]'s content.&lt;ref name=businesstravelnews2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesstravelnews.com/Travel-Management/KDS-announced-that-booking-tool-users-now-can-access-Spanish-rail-operator-Renfe-s-content/?ib=Rail&amp;a=trans|title=KDS announced that booking tool users now can access Spanish rail operator Renfe's content|work=Business Travel News|date=2014-01-29|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; KDS gained access after it partnered with [[SilverRail Technologies]].&lt;ref name=businesstravelnews2/&gt; The partnership also gave KDS access to North American rail content via [[Amtrak]] and Italy with [[Trenitalia]].

On July 16, 2016, KDS released its latest version of Neo which for the first time combined the functionality of its legacy corporate booking tool, the door-to-door search and calendar-view introduced in Neo under a completely redesigned consumer-grade [[user interface]].

==Surveys and studies==
KDS released the results of a survey the company took in 2013 asking business travelers about their company's travel safety.&lt;ref name=smartmm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smart-mobilitymanagement.com/safety_and_security_communication_is_the_key_54374-en-437-184650.html|title=Safety and Security:Communication is the Key|author=Jonathan Green |work=Smart Mobility Management|date=2013-06-19|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey found that 15% of travelers believed that their employers were unaware of their whereabouts and that an additional 23% regularly booked outside of the company defined booking processes.&lt;ref name=smartmm/&gt;

Later that year, KDS and EPSA online surveyed 200 employees of companies of all sizes on expense fraud. Results found that 60% of employees thought cheating mileage expenses was justifiable because the system is poorly organized.&lt;ref name=smartmman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smart-mobilitymanagement.com/how_much_is_expense_fraud_costing_you__56459-en-461-186552.html|title=How much is expense fraud costing you?|author=Jonathan Green|work=Smart Mobility Management|date=2014-03-26|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 85% of participants stated that they had never cheated in their request for the reimbursement of business expenses.&lt;ref name=smartmman/&gt; The survey also found that employee reimbursement time on average is 17 days and could take up to month.&lt;ref name=smartmman/&gt;

In 2016, KDS launched a survey devised to investigate the attitudes, actions and behaviors of UK and U.S. business professionals when booking and managing their work-related travel and reporting travel expenses. The survey questioned over 1,000 participants and revealed that almost one quarter (22%) embellish their business travel expenses by regularly rounding up business mileage claims by 1 and 10 miles per journey.

==Applications==
KDS developed door-to-door reservations tool Neo to manage travel booking and business travellers. Describing the concept of open booking as "failure dressed up as innovation," Dean Forbes (KDS CEO) said KDS will emphasize Neo because he is confident it can sufficiently deter travelers from using alternative, unofficial booking channels.&lt;ref name=thebeat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebeat.travel/post/2013/10/21/KDS-De-emphasizing-Open-Booking-Pushing-Neo-System-Into-US.aspx|title=KDS De-Emphasizing Open Booking Tools, Pushing 'Neo' System Into U.S. Market|work=The Beat|date=2013-10-21|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open booking aims to collect data from bookings that take place on public websites.&lt;ref name=thebeat/&gt;

==Neo==
KDS launched Neo, a door-to-door corporate booking tool, in January 2013.&lt;ref name=tnooz2/&gt; The tool provides consumers live street view and map overlays while displaying door-to-door itinerary time lines with steps including walking, driving, biking, rail, hotel, flights and dining.&lt;ref name=tnooz2/&gt; In November 2013, Neo had 11 active clients with over 300,000 profiles.&lt;ref name=thebeat2/&gt;

In 2014, KDS developed the Neo expense solution including an [[optical character recognition]] tool, that captures data and turns it into text.&lt;ref name=tnooz2/&gt; The tool aims to get rid of the collection of receipts by uploading them to a user's expense system as a line item.&lt;ref name=tnooz2/&gt; The expense system is calendar based to provide users with context on when and how they incurred an expense.&lt;ref name=tnooz2/&gt;

In 2015, the company rolled out the Neo Move mobile app for the iPhone and Apple Watch, branded as an ‘on-trip companion and guide’ by providing the traveler with real-time, location-based information and the ability to scan expense receipts on the go.

&lt;!-- EDITOR SUGGESTIONS- columnized pictures rather then off table? --&gt;
&lt;!-- Alphabetize? or group by region or both?--&gt;
&lt;!-- Color code for martial art weapons and medieval era? --&gt;
This '''list of traditional armaments''' tries to include all "traditional" armaments. Essentially anything that is wieldable, excluding "modern" (post American civil war) firearms. It lists everything by typology in easy-to-reference tables for your searching convenience.

This catalog does not however presume to list every dialectal variant for the word spear, sword, etc. It only attempts to provide a broad range of designs or unique characteristics of various arms of historical or regional significance, i.e. items that stand out from the standard norm. This catalog may include some modern examples but it tries to lean towards weapons of the past.

''For mythological or fictional arms see:''
&lt;!-- EDITOR PLEASE NOTE- "historically important" fantasy blades may be included, such as ones with deep cultural roots and iconography, in which case label them as fantastic in the "martial use column" and place them in the table best suited to their perceived design. Try to only include weapons that might have actually have existed or are Iconic and contained in more then one work of mythology. I left out the sword of ceasar because it was dubious to me. --&gt;

==Pole arms and staff weapons==
'''''A pole with a weaponized tip; often used to counter mounted cavalry or to aid in infantry charges. Their benefit is their reach. Their hindrance is they are often hard to wield and transport, and tie up both hands; this usually leads to the need of a backup weapon such as a sword.'''''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5622">'''Live online tutoring''' is the process of tutoring in an [[online]] environment, with teacher and student interacting in real-time without necessarily being in the same place. This real-time element, whilst presenting a significant technical challenge, sets live online tutoring apart from traditional [[online tutoring]] as it attempts to mimic in-person interaction as closely as possible rather than simply facilitating knowledge transfer.

== Background ==

Live online tutoring is a relatively recent concept, originally pioneered by [[NetTutor]] in 1996 and popularized by the live online tutoring platform [[Tutor.com]] from 1998 in the US. It has developed alongside far more widespread asynchronous online tutoring and learning experiences, in turn popularized by organizations such as [[Khan Academy]], universities and other educational institutions with the introduction of Massive Open Online Courses ([[Massive open online course|MOOCS]]). These efforts were aimed primarily at people without local access to appropriate teachers and tutors, in an attempt to remove geographical barriers from education.&lt;ref name="Cases on Online Tutoring, Mentoring, and Educational Services: Practices and Applications"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berg|first1=Gary|title=Cases on Online Tutoring, Mentoring, and Educational Services: Practices and Applications|date=31 October 2009|publisher=IGI Global|location=Hershey, New York|ISBN=9781605668772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, lack of certain key technology such as reliable remote video and audio communication, and a lack of widespread stable high-bandwidth Internet access, prevented these early efforts from including a significant live component in their offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chi Ng|first1=Kwok|title=Replacing Face-to-Face Tutorials by Synchronous Online Technologies: Challenges and pedagogical implications|journal=The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning|date=March 2007|volume=8|issue=1|url=http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/335/764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early innovations came from remote language learning services such as [[italki]], where a stable audio connection was sufficient to deliver a reasonable service. In most contexts, online tutoring was thus fundamentally different from face-to-face tutoring, more closely resembling correspondence teaching than sitting in a classroom. Today, there are hundreds of companies and academic institutions based around the world offering live remote learning in a huge range of subjects, both in the context of academic learning and industrial training. With current technology and increasing Internet penetration in the developing world, there is a renewed interest in live offerings as exemplified by [[Chegg]]'s recent acquisition of [[InstaEDU]] for $30 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TechCrunch article, June 2014|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/03/chegg-acquires-online-tutoring-site-instaedu-for-30-million/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common functionality ==

Existing live online tutoring services frequently include the following features to connect students and tutors:

* Video link
* Audio link
* Text chat
* Interactive whiteboard
* Feedback

Some services also provide

* Document sharing, upload and download
* Synchronized document editing
* Screen sharing and recording
* Mathematics tools (equation editors, graph plotters, etc.)

The overall environment aims to reproduce the level of interaction present in a face-to-face session, and is fundamentally different from software packages and services for screen-casting and videoconferencing such as [[WebEx]], where the focus is on one-way transmission of information.

== Comparison with in-person tutoring ==

Live online tutoring has several advantages over face-to-face tutoring, although suffers from shortcomings in ease of non-verbal communication.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Attribute !! Live online tutoring !! Face-to-face tutoring
|-
| '''Verbal communication''' || Audio link || Conversation
|-
| '''Visual non-written communication''' || Video link || Body language
|-
| '''Written communication''' || Text chat, whiteboards, synchronized document sharing and editing || Reading and writing together
|-
| '''Lesson quality control and accountability''' || Lessons can be recorded or monitored unobtrusively || Lessons must be recorded or observed in person by an external party
|-
| '''Lesson asymmetry''' || Experience of tutor and student during lesson can differ significantly || Experience of tutor and student during lesson is largely shared
|-
| '''Ease of lesson scheduling, planning and execution''' || No travelling required, resources available privately to tutor during lessons || Travelling required, tutor has access to limited resources during lessons
|-
| '''Safety concerns''' || No physical contact, lesson can be monitored unobtrusively and halted immediately || Physical contact, monitoring with ability to halt lesson immediately requires close third party supervision
|}

With the development of wearable technology, in particular smart headsets, richer interaction will become possible as companies work to mimic face-to-face interaction more closely. The language learning service [[Duolingo]], for example, is already fully compatible with [[Google Glass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article on TheNextWeb.com, June 2014|url=https://thenextweb.com/google/2014/06/24/google-glass-gets-shazam-runtastic-duolingo-9-new-updated-glassware-apps/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2796">'''Louis Pierre Couffignal''' (16 March 1902 – 4 July 1966) was a French [[Mathematics|mathematician]] and [[cybernetics]] pioneer, born in [[Monflanquin]]. He taught in schools in the southwest of [[Brittany]], then at the naval academy and, eventually, at the Buffon School.

== Biography ==
After joining the school, Couffignal hesitated to write a thesis on Symbolic Logic but after his meetings with [[Philbert Maurice d'Ocagne]], he decided to focus on machines and on Mechanical Logic.

He published a variety of notes at the Academy of Sciences, with a focus on using binary computation by machines to solve new problems. Following [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], he promoted binary numbers as the basis of calculating machines. Couffignal received his Doctorate of Sciences in 1938 with his thesis on Mechanical Analysis, demonstrating applications for machines to calculate celestial mechanics. Couffignal took on an interest in Cybernetics, influenced by his meetings with [[Louis Lapicque]] in 1941 and the cyberneticist [[Norbert Wiener]] in 1946.

With Lapicque, Couffignal compared the functioning of the [[nervous system]] and that of machines, as Wiener prepared his book ''Cybernetics'', the book that established the foundations for the subject.

Between 1938 and 1960, Couffignal was the director of the Blaise Pascal Calculation Center. In 1945, he was named Inspector General of Public Teaching. In 1951, Couffignal prepared an international conference on thinking machines to bring together the greatest specialists in this new science, including [[Norbert Wiener]], [[W. Ross Ashby]], [[Warren McCulloch]], etc. As Inspector General, he created the first BTS teaching degree in France.

== Publications ==
Couffignal wrote several books and articles. A selection:
* ''Les machines à calculer. Leurs principes. Leur évolution''.
* 1952, ''Les machines à penser''. Couffignal Éditions de Minuit.
* 1956, "Essai d’une définition générale de la cybernétique", The First International Congress on Cybernetics, Namur, Belgium, June 26–29, 1956, Gauthier-Villars, Paris, 1958, pp.&amp;nbsp;46–54

Retrieved 2014-6-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Maths Doctor was founded in [[Brighton]], [[Sussex]] in 2008 by Simon Walsh, a [[Chartered Financial Analyst]] and former [[teacher]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/maths-doctor "Maths Doctor"] ''CrunchBase''. Retrieved 2014-6-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Walsh initially worked as an [[investment banker]] before re-training as a [[Secondary school#United Kingdom|secondary maths teacher]]. After teaching in both [[independent schools|independent]] and [[state school]]s, Walsh generated the concept of individually tailored online tuition sessions, culminating in his creation of Maths Doctor and its online tuition services.

In 2012, the agency was acquired by the educational organisation [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan Digital Education]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digital-education.com/macmillan-digital-education-acquires-maths-doctor-to-enter-uk-e-tutoring-market/ "Macmillan Digital Education Acquires Maths Doctor to Enter UK e-tutoring Market"] ''DIGITAL Education''. Retrieved 2014-6-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Maths Doctor founder Simon Walsh was assigned as Managing Director of Maths Doctor following its acquisition.

==Logistics==
The agency has a network of over 500 [[tutors]] across the United Kingdom, delivering live online lessons. All Maths Doctor tutors are [[Disclosure and Barring Service|DBS]] checked and receive training according to [[Local Safeguarding Children Board]] procedures and [[Department of Education]] guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netmums.com/south-bucks/local/view/after-school-activities/academic-and-languages/maths-doctor-maths-and-physics-tuition "Maths Doctor"] ''Southbucks net mums''. Retrieved 2014-6-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maths Doctor tutors facilitate live one-to-one [[In-home tutoring|home tutoring]] via the internet, as well as worksheets and tutoring videos. To use these services, students receive an [[electronic pen]] and pad which connects to their computer via USB allowing students to access a shared white board with their tutor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/andy-robertson/online-tuition-tailors-le_b_4601073.html  "Online Tuition Tailors Learning to the Individual Learner Rather Than the Class"] ''HuffPost Tech UK''.

==Biography==

===Early years===
De Icaza was born in [[Mexico City]] and studied Mathematics at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|Universidad Nacional Autonoma de México]] (UNAM), but never received a degree.&lt;ref&gt;http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2009/Oct-19.html&lt;/ref&gt; He came from a family of scientists in which his father is a physicist and his mother a biologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview{{sic|hide=y}} with Miguel De Icaza|url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6833|publisher=''[[Linux Journal]]''|accessdate=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started writing [[free software]] in 1992.

===Early software career===
One of the earliest pieces of software he wrote for Linux was the [[Midnight Commander]] file manager, a text-mode file manager.&lt;ref name="mc-maintainer"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/mc/mc/FAQ?rev=HEAD | title = Midnight Commander FAQ | author = Midnight Commander authors | accessdate = 2010-09-06 | quote = ''Midnight Commander was started by Miguel de Icaza and he is the maintainer of the package. Other authors have joined the project later.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also one of the early contributors to the [[Wine (software)|Wine project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wine History|url=http://wiki.winehq.org/WineHistory|publisher=wiki.winehq.org|accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked with [[David S. Miller]] on the Linux [[SPARC]] port and wrote several of the video and network drivers in the port, as well as the libc ports to the platform.&lt;ref name="sparc-port-usenix97"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/ana97/summaries/miller_invite.html | title = The SPARC Port of Linux | author=David S. Miller, Rutgers CAIP, and Miguel de Icaza, Instituto de Ciencias Nucleares, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico | work = Usenix Proceedings | year = 1997 | publisher = [[USENIX]] Association | accessdate = 2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They both later worked on extending Linux for [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] to run on SGI's [[SGI Indy|Indy]] computers and wrote the original X drivers for the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kneuro.net/cgi-bin/lxr/http/source/drivers/sgi/char/graphics.c | title = graphics.c | author = Miguel de Icaza | accessdate = 2011-11-19 | quote = ''Author: Miguel de Icaza''}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Ingo Molnar]] he wrote the original software implementation of RAID-1 and RAID-5 drivers of the Linux kernel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.koders.com/c/fid90D0506D0981288C46C7A849BBB82C7276351E12.aspx?s=rsa | title = raid5.c | quote = ''Copyright: (C) 1996, 1997 Ingo Molnar, Miguel de Icaza, Gadi Oxman''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer of 1997, he was interviewed by [[Microsoft]] for a job in the [[Internet Explorer for UNIX|Internet Explorer Unix]] team (to work on a [[SPARC]] port), but lacked the university degree required to obtain a work [[H-1B visa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nat.org/blog/2009/10/ | title = Startup Visa | first = Nat | last = Friedman | date = 2009-10-31 | accessdate = 2010-09-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20140328013753/http://nat.org/blog/2009/10/ | archivedate = 2014-03-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said in an interview that he tried to persuade his interviewers to free the IE code even before [[Netscape]] did so with their own browser.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dndotnet/html/deicazainterview.asp]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020108174635/http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=%2Flibrary%2Fen-us%2Fdndotnet%2Fhtml%2Fdeicazainterview.asp|date=January 8, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GNOME, Ximian, Xamarin and Mono===
De Icaza started the [[GNOME]] project with [[Federico Mena]] in August 1997 to create a completely free desktop environment and component model for [[Linux]] and other [[Unix-like]] operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Practical Mono|first=Mark|last=Mamone|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YpIAry7MNCcC&amp;dq=Federico+Mena&amp;cad=0|publisher=Apress|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59059-548-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also created the GNOME spreadsheet program, [[Gnumeric]].

In 1999, de Icaza, along with [[Nat Friedman]], co-founded Helix Code, a GNOME-oriented free software company that employed a large number of other GNOME hackers. In 2001, Helix Code, later renamed [[Ximian]], announced the [[Mono (software)|Mono]] Project, to be led by de Icaza, with the goal to implement [[Microsoft]]'s new [[.NET Framework|.NET]] development platform on [[Linux]] and [[Unix-like]] platforms. In August 2003, Ximian was acquired by [[Novell]]. There, de Icaza was [[Vice president|Vice President]] of Developer Platform.

In May 2011, de Icaza started [[Xamarin]] to replace MonoTouch and Mono for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] after Novell was bought by [[Attachmate]] and the projects were abandoned. Shortly afterwards, Xamarin and Novell reached an agreement where Xamarin took over the development and sales of these products.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Nat. (2011-07-18) [http://blog.xamarin.com/2011/07/18/first-press-release/ Xamarin mobile products available now! | Xamarin Blog] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110234152/http://blog.xamarin.com/2011/07/18/first-press-release/ |date=2011-11-10 }}. Blog.xamarin.com. Retrieved on 2013-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, Xamarin announced being acquired by Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.xamarin.com/a-xamarin-microsoft-future/]&lt;/ref&gt; One month later in Microsoft Build conference, it was announced that the Mono Project would be [[Software relicensing|relicensed]] to MIT, Visual Studio would include Xamarin (even the free versions) without restrictions, and Xamarin SDKs would be opensourced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.xamarin.com/xamarin-for-all/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advocacy of Microsoft open technologies===
De Icaza endorsed Microsoft's [[Office Open XML|Office Open XML (OOXML)]] document standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OOXML.

===Preference for Mac over Linux===
In August 2012, de Icaza criticized the [[Linux desktop]] as "killed by Apple". De Icaza specifically criticized a generally developer-focused culture, lack of [[backward compatibility]] and fragmentation among the various Linux distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/08/osx-killed-linux/| title= How Apple Killed the Linux Desktop and Why That Doesn’t Matter|first=Klint |last=Finley|publisher=[[wired.com]] |date=2012-08-27 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2012/Aug-29.html| first=Miguel|last=de Icaza|title=What Killed the Linux Desktop|publisher=tirania.org |date=2012-08-29 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, de Icaza announced on his personal blog that he regularly used [[OS X|macOS]] instead of Linux for desktop computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2013/Mar-05.html| first=Miguel|last=de Icaza|title=How I ended up with Mac |publisher=tirania.org |date=2013-03-05 |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===.NET Foundation director===
In 2014 he joined [[Anders Hejlsberg]] on stage during the announcements of the [[.NET Foundation]] and the open sourcing of Microsoft's [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] Compiler. He serves on the [[board of directors]] of the .NET Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140403006500/en/Microsoft-Xamarin-Collaborate-Establish-.NET-Foundation Microsoft-Xamarin-Collaborate-Establish-.NET-Foundation] (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/11/12/release_microsoft_net_from_its_windows_chains_mono_and_xamarin_guy_miguel_de_icaza_on_open_source_net/ Microsoft .NET released from its Windows chains... but what ABOUT MONO?] on [[theregister.co.uk]] ''"Xamarin is a close partner of Microsoft, and De Icaza is one of three directors of the .NET Foundation, and the only director that does not work for Microsoft.

'''Music instrument technology''' refers to the construction of [[Musical instrument|instruments]] and the way they have changed over time. Such change has produced modern instruments that are considerably different from their [[Musical instrument#Modern|historical antecedents]].

An example is the way in which many instruments commonly associated with a modern symphony orchestra are markedly different from the same instruments for which European composers were composing music centuries ago.

Such changes include the addition of piston valves to brass instruments, the design of more complex fingering systems for woodwind instruments such as the flute, and the standardization of the family of orchestral string instruments.

Many advancements were made in music instrument technology during the [[Middle Ages]] and 19th Century. The introduction of copper smelting allowed for [[trumpets]], [[organ pipes]], and slides to be constructed with sheet metal which had a smooth texture and consistency in thickness, allowing for more range of tones and sounds. Improvements in molding and casting during the 19th Century allowed for technological advancement to [[pianos]]. While originally constructed with wooden frames, limiting the amount of sound that could be produced, pianos began to be constructed of one-piece iron frames. This provided a more amplified volume from the instrument and allowed musicians to use less force when playing the instrument. Improvements in drum tuning were also established at this time. The "Dresden" model of tuning, involving steel technology and employing a foot petal with ratchet in order to attach the device to the [[timpani]], was invented by Carl Pittrich. This technology allowed for timpani to be tuned much faster by the musician. The Dresden tuners could also be added onto existing timpani, allowing symphonies to continue using their existing instruments while still employing this new technology. Lastly, the 19th century also lead to the development of valves, and when added in to the construction of trumpets and [[French horn|horns]], they allowed for the instruments to express a broader range to the harmonic series of notes being produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowles|first=Edmund|title=The Impact of Technology on Musical Instruments|url=http://www.cosmosclub.org/web/journals/1999/bowles.html|publisher=Cosmos Club|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of this technology represents patentable advancements in the musical instrument industry.  See [https://web.archive.org/web/20130511183302/http://blog.hdp.com/category/music-industry/ Musical Instrument Patent of Week]

'''Network transparency''', in its most general sense, refers to the ability of a protocol to transmit data over the [[computer network|network]] in a manner which is [[Transparency (human–computer interaction)|transparent]] (invisible) to those using the applications that are using the protocol. In this way, users of a particular application may access remote resources in the same manner in which they would access their own local resources. An example of this is [[cloud storage]], where remote files are presented as being locally accessible, and [[cloud computing]] where the resource in question is processing. 

==X Window==
The term is often partially correctly applied in the context of the [[X Window System]], which is able to transmit graphical data over the network and integrate it seamlessly with applications running and displaying locally; however, certain extensions of the X Window System are not capable of working over the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/553415/ |title=The Wayland Situation: Facts About X vs. Wayland (Phoronix) |publisher=[[LWN.net]] |date=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Databases==
In a [[centralized database system]], the only available resource that needs to be shielded from the user is the data (that is, the [[storage system]]). In a [[Distributed Database Management System|distributed DBMS]], a second resource needs to be managed in much the same manner: the [[computer network|network]]. Preferably, the user should be protected from the network operational details. Then there would be no difference between database applications that would run on the centralized database and those that would run on a distributed one. This kind of transparency is referred to as '''network transparency''' or '''distribution transparency'''. From a [[database management system]] (DBMS) perspective, distribution transparency requires that users do not have to specify where data is located.

Some have separated distribution transparency into location transparency and naming transparency.

Location transparency in commands used to perform a task is independent both of the locations of the data, and of the system on which an operation is carried out.

Naming transparency means that a unique name is provided for each object in the database.

==Firewalls==
{{See also|Proxy server#Transparent proxy}}

Transparency in firewall technology can be defined at the networking (IP or [[Internet Layer|Internet layer]]) or at the [[Internet Layer|application layer]].

Transparency at the IP layer means the client targets the real IP address of the server. If a connection is non-transparent, then the client targets an intermediate host (address), which could be a proxy or a caching server. IP layer transparency could be also defined from the point of server's view. If the connection is transparent, the server sees the real client IP. If it is non-transparent, the server sees the IP of the intermediate host.

Transparency at the application layer means the client application uses the protocol in a different way. An example of a transparent HTTP request for a server:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="http"&gt;
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Connection: Keep-Alive
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

An example non-transparent HTTP request for a proxy (cache):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="http"&gt;
GET http://foo.bar/ HTTP/1.1
Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Application layer transparency is symmetric when the same working mode is used on both the sides. The transparency is asymmetric when the firewall (usually a proxy) converts server type requests to proxy type or vice versa.

Transparency at the IP layer does not mean automatically application layer transparency.

An '''oil platform''', '''offshore platform''', or '''offshore drilling rig''' is a large structure with facilities for [[well drilling]] to explore, extract, store, process [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] which lies in rock formations beneath the seabed. In many cases, the platform contains facilities to house the workforce as well.

Most commonly, oil platforms engage in activities on the [[continental shelf]], though they can also be used in lakes, inshore waters and inland seas.

Depending on the circumstances,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=BF|year=2005|title=Applicability ranges for offshore oil and gas production facilities|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183390500050X|journal=Marine Structures|volume=18 |issue=3|pages=251–263|via=Elsevier ScienceDirect|doi=10.1016/j.marstruc.2005.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; the platform may be [[Fixed Platform|fixed]] to the ocean floor, may consist of an [[artificial island]], or may [[Floating oil production system|float]]. Remote [[subsea]] wells may also be connected to a platform by flow lines and by [[Umbilical cable|umbilical]] connections. These sub-sea solutions may consist of one or more subsea wells, or of one or more manifold centres for multiple wells.

Offshore drilling presents environmental challenges, both from the produced hydrocarbons and the materials used during the drilling operation. Controversies include the ongoing [[US offshore drilling debate|U.S. offshore drilling debate]].&lt;ref&gt;Compton, Glenn, "[http://thebradentontimes.com/reasons-not-to-drill-for-oil-offshore-of-florida-p19415-137.htm 10 Reasons Not to Drill for Oil Offshore of Florida]", ''The Bradenton Times'', Sunday, January 14, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many different types of facilities from which offshore drilling operations take place. These include bottom founded drilling rigs ([[Jackup rig|jackup barges]] and swamp barges), combined drilling and production facilities either bottom founded or floating platforms, and deepwater mobile offshore drilling units (MODU) including semi-submersibles and drillships.  These are capable of operating in water depths up to {{convert|3000|m|ft}}. In shallower waters the mobile units are anchored to the seabed, however in deeper water (more than {{convert|1500|m|ft}}) the [[semisubmersible]]s or [[drillship]]s are maintained at the required drilling location using [[dynamic positioning]].

==History==
[[File:Gulf Offshore Platform.jpg|thumb|upright|Offshore platform, [[Gulf of Mexico]]]]
Around 1891, the first submerged oil wells were drilled from platforms built on piles in the fresh waters of the [[Grand Lake St. Marys]] (a.k.a. Mercer County Reservoir) in [[Ohio]]. The wide but shallow reservoir was built from 1837 to 1845 to provide water to the [[Miami and Erie Canal]].

Around 1896, the first submerged oil wells in salt water were drilled in the portion of the [[Summerland Oil Field|Summerland field]] extending under the [[Santa Barbara Channel]] in [[California]]. The wells were drilled from piers extending from land out into the channel.

Other notable early submerged drilling activities occurred on the Canadian side of [[Lake Erie]] since 1913  and [[Caddo Lake]] in [[Louisiana]] in the 1910s. Shortly thereafter, wells were drilled in tidal zones along the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] of [[Texas]] and Louisiana. The [[Goose Creek Oil Field|Goose Creek field]] near [[Baytown, Texas]] is one such example. In the 1920s, drilling was done from concrete platforms in [[Lake Maracaibo]], [[Venezuela]].

The oldest offshore well recorded in Infield's offshore database is the [[Bibiheybət|Bibi Eibat]] well which came on stream in 1923 in [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.members.tripod.com/azmsa/oil.html|title=Oil in Azerbaijan|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landfill was used to raise shallow portions of the [[Caspian Sea]].

In the early 1930s, [[Texaco|the Texas Company]] developed the first mobile steel barges for drilling in the brackish coastal areas of the gulf.

In 1937, [[Pure Oil Company]] (now [[Chevron Corporation]]) and its partner [[Superior Oil Company]] (now part of [[ExxonMobil Corporation]]) used a fixed platform to develop a field in {{convert|14|ft|m}} of water, one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) offshore of [[Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana]].

In 1938, Humble Oil built  a mile-long wooden trestle with railway tracks into the sea at McFadden Beach on the Gulf of Mexico, placing a derrick at its end - this was later destroyed by a hurricane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morton|first1=Michael Quentin|date=June 2016|title=Beyond Sight of Land: A History of Oil Exploration in the Gulf of Mexico|url=https://www.academia.edu/25960555/Beyond_Sight_of_Land_Oil_A_History_of_Oil_Exploration_in_the_Gulf_of_Mexico_2016_|journal=GeoExpro|volume=30|issue=3|pages=60–63|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, concern for American control of its offshore oil reserves caused President [[Harry Truman]] to issue an Executive Order unilaterally extending American territory to the edge of its continental shelf, an act that effectively ended the [[3-mile limit]] "[[freedom of the seas]]" regime.

In 1946, Magnolia Petroleum (now [[ExxonMobil]]) drilled at a site {{convert|18|mi|km}} off the coast, erecting a platform in {{convert|18|ft|m}} of water off [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana]].

In early 1947, Superior Oil erected a drilling/production platform in {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} of water some 18 miles{{vague|which miles?|date=February 2010}} off [[Vermilion Parish, Louisiana]]. But it was [[Kerr-McGee]] Oil Industries (now [[Anadarko Petroleum Corporation]]), as operator for partners [[Phillips Petroleum]] ([[ConocoPhillips]]) and [[Stanolind Oil &amp; Gas]] ([[BP]]), that completed its historic Ship Shoal Block 32 well in October 1947, months before Superior actually drilled a discovery from their Vermilion platform farther offshore. In any case, that made Kerr-McGee's well the first oil discovery drilled out of sight of land.&lt;ref&gt;Ref accessed 02-12-89 by technical aspects and coast mapping. [[Kerr-McGee]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="project-redsand"&gt;[http://www.project-redsand.com/ Project Redsand&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[Maunsell Forts]] constructed during [[World War II]] are considered the direct predecessors of modern offshore platforms. Having been pre-constructed in a very short time, they were then floated to their location and placed on the shallow bottom of the [[Thames]] and the [[Mersey]] estuary.&lt;ref name="project-redsand" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai112_folder/112_articles/112_chronology.html 11.2 Azerbaijan's Oil History Brief Oil Chronology since 1920  Part 2 by Mir-Yusif Mir-Babayev&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the first [[jackup rig|jackup oil rig]] was ordered by [[Zapata Oil]]. It was designed by [[R. G. LeTourneau]] and featured three electro-mechanically-operated lattice type legs. Built on the shores of the [[Mississippi river]] by the LeTourneau Company, it was launched in December 1955, and christened 'Scorpion'. The Scorpion was put into operation in May 1956 off [[Port Aransas]], Texas. It was lost in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;http://iadc.org/dcpi/dc-septoct05/Sept05-anniversary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://petrowiki.org/History_of_offshore_drilling_units&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ibvuWmF7Dc&lt;/ref&gt;

When offshore drilling moved into deeper waters of up to {{convert|30|m|ft}}, fixed platform rigs were built, until demands for drilling equipment was needed in the {{convert|100|ft|m}} to {{convert|120|m|ft}} depth of the Gulf of Mexico, the first [[Jackup rig|jack-up rigs]] began appearing from specialized offshore drilling contractors such as forerunners of ENSCO International.

The first [[semi-submersible]] resulted from an unexpected observation in 1961. [[Blue Water Drilling Company]] owned and operated the four-column submersible Blue Water Rig No.1 in the Gulf of Mexico for [[Shell Oil Company]]. As the pontoons were not sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of the rig and its consumables, it was towed between locations at a draught midway between the top of the pontoons and the underside of the deck. It was noticed that the motions at this draught were very small, and Blue Water Drilling and Shell jointly decided to try operating the rig in the floating mode. The concept of an anchored, stable floating deep-sea platform had been designed and tested back in the 1920s by [[Edward Robert Armstrong]] for the purpose of operating aircraft with an invention known as the 'seadrome'. The first purpose-built drilling [[semi-submersible]] ''Ocean Driller'' was launched in 1963. Since then, many semi-submersibles have been purpose-designed for the drilling industry mobile offshore fleet.

The first offshore [[drillship]] was the ''CUSS 1'' developed for the [[Mohole]] project to drill into the Earth's crust.

As of June, 2010, there were over 620 mobile offshore drilling rigs (Jackups, semisubs, drillships, barges) available for service in the competitive rig fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rigzone.com/data/|title=RIGZONE - Offshore Rig Data, Onshore Fleet Analysis|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the world's deepest hubs is currently the [[Perdido oil platform|Perdido]] in the Gulf of Mexico, floating in 2,438 meters of water. It is operated by [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and was built at a cost of $3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN3123683920100331|title=UPDATE 1-Shell starts production at Perdido|work=Reuters|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deepest operational platform is the Petrobras America Cascade FPSO in the Walker Ridge 249 field in 2,600 meters of water.

~fixed are those platforms which are fixed at a particular place and cannot be changed.

===Compliant towers===
{{Main article|Compliant Tower}}
These platforms consist of slender, flexible towers and a pile foundation supporting a conventional deck for drilling and production operations. Compliant towers are designed to sustain significant lateral deflections and forces, and are typically used in water depths ranging from {{convert|370|to|910|m}}.

===Semi-submersible platform===
{{Main article|Semi-submersible}}
These platforms have hulls (columns and pontoons) of sufficient [[buoyancy]] to cause the structure to float, but of weight sufficient to keep the structure upright. Semi-submersible platforms can be moved from place to place and can be ballasted up or down by altering the amount of flooding in buoyancy tanks. They are generally anchored by combinations of chain, wire rope or polyester rope, or both, during drilling and/or production operations, though they can also be kept in place by the use of [[dynamic positioning]]. Semi-submersibles can be used in water depths from {{convert|60|to|6000|m|sigfig=1}}.

===Jack-up drilling rigs===
[[File:Jackrigkachbay.jpg|thumb|{{convert|400|ft}} tall jackup rig being towed by tugboats, [[Kachemak Bay, Alaska]]]]
{{Main article|Jackup rig}}
Jack-up Mobile Drilling Units (or jack-ups), as the name suggests, are rigs that can be jacked up above the sea using legs that can be lowered, much like [[Jack (device)|jacks]]. These MODUs (Mobile Offshore Drilling Units) are typically used in water depths up to {{convert|120|m|ft}}, although some designs can go to {{convert|170|m|abbr=on}} depth. They are designed to move from place to place, and then anchor themselves by deploying their legs to the ocean bottom using a [[rack and pinion]] gear system on each leg.

===Drillships===
{{Main article|Drillship}}
A drillship is a maritime vessel that has been fitted with drilling apparatus. It is most often used for exploratory drilling of new oil or gas wells in deep water but can also be used for scientific drilling. Early versions were built on a modified tanker hull, but purpose-built designs are used today. Most drillships are outfitted with a [[dynamic positioning]] system to maintain position over the well. They can drill in water depths up to {{convert|3700|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chevron.com/news/press/release/?id=2010-03-11 |title=Chevron Drillship |accessdate=2010-05-24 |date=2010-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530044448/http://www.chevron.com/news/press/release/?id=2010-03-11 |archivedate=2010-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floating production systems===
[[File:View of the Port of Las Palmas from the dock of La Esfinge (3).jpg|View of the Port of Las Palmas from the dock of La Esfinge|thumb]]
{{Main article|Floating production, storage and offloading}}
The main types of floating production systems are [[Floating Production Storage and Offloading|FPSO (floating production, storage, and offloading system)]]. FPSOs consist of large monohull structures, generally (but not always) shipshaped, equipped with processing facilities. These platforms are moored to a location for extended periods, and do not actually drill for oil or gas. Some variants of these applications, called [[Floating storage and offloading unit|FSO (floating storage and offloading system)]] or FSU (floating storage unit), are used exclusively for storage purposes, and host very little process equipment. This is one of the best sources for having floating production.

The world's first [[FLNG|floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG)]] facility is currently under development. See the section on [[Oil platform#Particularly large examples|particularly large examples]] below.

===Tension-leg platform===
{{Main article|Tension-leg platform}}
TLPs are floating platforms tethered to the seabed in a manner that eliminates most vertical movement of the structure. TLPs are used in water depths up to about {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}. The "conventional" TLP is a 4-column design which looks similar to a semisubmersible. Proprietary versions include the Seastar and MOSES mini TLPs; they are relatively low cost, used in water depths between {{convert|180|and|1300|m}}. Mini TLPs can also be used as utility, satellite or early production platforms for larger deepwater discoveries.

===Gravity-based structure===
{{Main article|Gravity-based structure}}
A GBS can either be steel or concrete and is usually anchored directly onto the seabed. Steel GBS are predominantly used when there is no or limited availability of crane barges to install a conventional fixed offshore platform, for example in the Caspian Sea. There are several steel GBS in the world today (e.g. offshore Turkmenistan Waters (Caspian Sea) and offshore New Zealand). Steel GBS do not usually provide [[hydrocarbon]] storage capability. It is mainly installed by pulling it off the yard, by either wet-tow or/and dry-tow, and self-installing by controlled ballasting of the compartments with sea water. To position the GBS during installation, the GBS may be connected to either a transportation barge or any other barge (provided it is large enough to support the GBS) using strand jacks. The jacks shall be released gradually whilst the GBS is ballasted to ensure that the GBS does not sway too much from target location.

===Spar platforms===
[[File:Devils tower 2004.JPG|thumb|upright|Devil's Tower spar platform]]
{{Main article|Spar (platform)}}
Spars are moored to the seabed like TLPs, but whereas a TLP has vertical tension tethers, a spar has more conventional mooring lines. Spars have to-date been designed in three configurations: the "conventional" one-piece cylindrical hull; the "truss spar", in which the midsection is composed of truss elements connecting the upper buoyant hull (called a hard tank) with the bottom soft tank containing permanent ballast; and the "cell spar", which is built from multiple vertical cylinders. The spar has more inherent stability than a TLP since it has a large counterweight at the bottom and does not depend on the mooring to hold it upright. It also has the ability, by adjusting the mooring line tensions (using chain-jacks attached to the mooring lines), to move horizontally and to position itself over wells at some distance from the main platform location. The first production spar was [[Kerr-McGee Corporation|Kerr-McGee's]] Neptune, anchored in {{convert|590|m|abbr=on}} in the Gulf of Mexico; however, spars (such as [[Brent Spar]]) were previously used as FSOs.

[[Eni]]'s [[Devil's Tower (oil platform)|Devil's Tower]] located in {{convert|1710|m|abbr=on}} of water in the Gulf of Mexico, was the world's deepest spar until 2010. The world's deepest platform is currently the [[Perdido oil platform|Perdido]] spar in the Gulf of Mexico, floating in 2,438 metres of water. It is operated by [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and was built at a cost of $3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN3123683920100331 Shell starts production at Perdido]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fahey, Jonathan, [[Associated Press]], "[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45825598/ns/us_news-environment/t/deep-gulf-drilling-thrives-mos-after-bp-spill/ Deep Gulf drilling thrives 18 mos. after BP spill]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 4 January 2012, p. 11; "[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gz-JrDDvRM0_zBWa3CWjEGhvB0xw?docId=7c57a1cc233d4a2d9ee7d047ef6d32cc The offshore drilling life: cramped and dangerous]", 1 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first truss spars were Kerr-McGee's Boomvang and Nansen.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}
The first (and only) cell spar is Kerr-McGee's Red Hawk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fmctechnologies.com/en/SubseaSystems/GlobalProjects/NorthAmerica/US/KMGRedHawk.aspx?tab=%7BB01D40AB-5E2F-4710-9543-19C658AF29F5%7D |title=First Cell Spar |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Normally unmanned installations (NUI)===
{{Main article|Normally unmanned installation}}
These installations, sometimes called toadstools, are small platforms, consisting of little more than a [[well bay]], [[helipad]] and emergency shelter. They are designed to be operated remotely under normal conditions, only to be visited occasionally for routine maintenance or [[well work]].

===Conductor support systems===
{{Main article|Conductor Support Systems}}
These installations, also known as '''satellite platforms''', are small unmanned platforms consisting of little more than a [[well bay]] and a small [[process plant]]. They are designed to operate in conjunction with a static production platform which is connected to the platform by flow lines or by [[umbilical cable]], or both.

==Particularly large examples==
[[File:Oil platform Norway.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Troll A platform|Troll A]] [[natural gas]] platform, a [[gravity-based structure]], under construction in [[Norway]]. Almost all of the 600KT structure will end up submerged.]]

The [[Petronius Platform]] is a compliant tower in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] modeled after the Hess Baldpate platform, which stands {{convert|2000|ft|m}} above the ocean floor. It is one of the [[world's tallest structures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=What is the World's Tallest Building? | url=http://www.allaboutskyscrapers.com/tallest_building.htm | work=All About Skyscrapers | year=2009 | accessdate=23 May 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205082042/http://www.allaboutskyscrapers.com/tallest_building.htm | archivedate=5 February 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hibernia Gravity Base Structure|Hibernia]] platform in [[Canada]] is the world's largest (in terms of weight) offshore platform, located on the [[Jeanne D'Arc Basin]], in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] off the coast of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. This ''[[gravity base structure]]'' (GBS), which sits on the ocean floor, is {{convert|111|m|ft}} high and has storage capacity for {{convert|1.3|Moilbbl|m3}} of crude oil in its {{convert|85|m|ft|adj=on}} high caisson. The platform acts as a small concrete island with serrated outer edges designed to withstand the impact of an [[iceberg]]. The GBS contains production storage tanks and the remainder of the void space is filled with ballast with the entire structure weighing in at 1.2 million [[ton]]s.

[[Royal Dutch Shell]] is currently developing the first [[FLNG|Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG)]] facility, which will be situated approximately 200&amp;nbsp;km off the coast of [[Western Australia]] and is due for completion around 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9ccaed4a-82ba-11e0-b97c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1NADgzzOH&lt;/ref&gt; When finished, it will be the largest floating offshore facility. It is expected to be approximately 488m long and 74m wide with [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] of around 600,000t when fully ballasted.&lt;ref&gt;http://gastoday.com.au/news/flng_gets_serious/042981/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintenance and supply==
A typical oil production platform is self-sufficient in energy and water needs, housing electrical generation, water desalinators and all of the equipment necessary to process oil and gas such that it can be either delivered directly onshore by pipeline or to a [[Floating production storage and offloading|floating platform]] or tanker loading facility, or both. Elements in the oil/gas production process include [[wellhead]], [[production manifold]], [[production separator]], [[glycol]] process to dry gas, [[gas compressor]]s, [[Water injection (oil production)|water injection pumps]], [[oil/gas export metering]] and [[main oil line]] pumps.

Larger platforms assisted by smaller ESVs (emergency support vessels) like the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Iolair]] that are summoned when something has gone wrong, ''e.g.'' when a [[search and rescue]] operation is required. During normal operations, [[platform supply vessel|PSVs]] (platform supply vessels) keep the platforms provisioned and supplied, and [[anchor handling tug supply vessel|AHTS vessels]] can also supply them, as well as tow them to location and serve as standby rescue and firefighting vessels.

==Crew==

===Essential personnel===
Not all of the following personnel are present on every platform. On smaller platforms, one worker can perform a number of different jobs. The following also are not names officially recognized in the industry:

*[[OIM (offshore installation manager)]] who is the ultimate authority during his/her shift and makes the essential decisions regarding the operation of the platform;
*operations team leader (OTL);
*Offshore Methods Engineer (OME) who defines the installation methodology of the platform;
*offshore operations engineer (OOE) who is the senior technical authority on the platform;
*PSTL or operations coordinator for managing crew changes;
*dynamic positioning operator, navigation, ship or vessel maneuvering (MODU), station keeping, fire and gas systems operations in the event of incident;
*automation systems specialist, to configure, maintain and troubleshoot the process control systems (PCS), process safety systems, emergency support systems and vessel management systems;
*second mate to meet manning requirements of flag state, operates fast rescue craft, cargo operations, fire team leader;
*third mate to meet manning requirements of flag state, operate fast rescue craft, cargo operations, fire team leader;
*ballast control operator to operate fire and gas systems;
*crane operators to operate the cranes for lifting cargo around the platform and between boats;
*scaffolders to rig up scaffolding for when it is required for workers to work at height;
*coxswains to maintain the lifeboats and manning them if necessary;
*control room operators, especially FPSO or production platforms;
*catering crew, including people tasked with performing essential functions such as cooking, laundry and cleaning the accommodation;
*production techs to run the production plant;
*[[helicopter]] [[Aviator|pilot]](s) living on some platforms that have a helicopter based offshore and transporting workers to other platforms or to shore on crew changes;
*maintenance technicians (instrument, electrical or mechanical).
*Fully qualified medic.
*Radio operator to operate all radio communications.
*Store Keeper, keeping the inventory well supplied

===Incidental personnel===
Drill crew will be on board if the installation is performing drilling operations. A drill crew will normally comprise:
* [[Toolpusher]]
* [[Driller (oil)|Driller]]
* [[Roughneck]]s
* [[Roustabout]]s
* [[Company man]]
* [[Mud engineer]]
* [[Motorman]]
* [[Derrickhand]]
* [[Geologist]]
* [[Welders]] and Welder Helpers
[[Well services]] crew will be on board for [[well work]]. The crew will normally comprise:
* Well services supervisor
* Wireline or coiled tubing operators
* Pump operator
* Pump hanger and ranger

==Drawbacks==
{{For|fuller discussion|United States offshore drilling debate}}

===Risks===
The nature of their operation—extraction of volatile substances sometimes under extreme pressure in a hostile environment—means risk; accidents and tragedies occur regularly. The U.S. [[Minerals Management Service]] reported 69 offshore deaths, 1,349 injuries, and 858 fires and explosions on offshore rigs in the Gulf of Mexico from 2001 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Potential for big spill after oil rig sinks | date = 2010-04-22 | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36683314/ns/us_news-life/ | work = MSNBC | accessdate = 2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 6, 1988, 167 people died when [[Occidental Petroleum]]'s [[Piper Alpha]] offshore production platform, on the Piper field in the UK sector of the [[North Sea]], exploded after a gas leak. The resulting investigation conducted by Lord Cullen and publicized in the first [[Cullen Report]] was highly critical of a number of areas, including, but not limited to, management within the company, the design of the structure, and the Permit to Work System. The report was commissioned in 1988, and was delivered November 1990.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oilandgas.org.uk/issues/piperalpha/v0000864.cfm{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The accident greatly accelerated the practice of providing living accommodations on separate platforms, away from those used for extraction.

The offshore can be in itself a hazardous environment. In March 1980, the '[[flotel]]' (floating hotel) platform ''[[Alexander L. Kielland (platform)|Alexander L. Kielland]]'' capsized in a storm in the [[North Sea]] with the loss of 123 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/27/newsid_2531000/2531091.stm |title=North Sea platform collapses  | work=BBC News | accessdate=2008-06-19 | date=1980-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, ''[[Petrobras 36]]'' in [[Brazil]] exploded and sank five days later, killing 11 people.

Given the number of grievances and conspiracy theories that involve the oil business, and the importance of gas/oil platforms to the economy, platforms in the United States are believed to be potential terrorist targets.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}} Agencies and military units responsible for maritime counter-terrorism in the US ([[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], [[Navy SEALs]], [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Marine Recon]]) often train for platform raids.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

On April 21, 2010, the ''[[Deepwater Horizon]]'' platform, 52 [[nautical mile|miles]] off-shore of [[Venice, Louisiana]], (property of [[Transocean]] and leased to [[BP]]) [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|exploded]], killing 11 people, and sank two days later. The resulting undersea gusher, conservatively estimated to exceed {{convert|20|e6USgal|m3}} as of early June, 2010, became the worst oil spill in US history, eclipsing the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]].

===Ecological effects===
[[File:Gulf Coast Platforms.jpg|thumb|250px|right|NOAA map of the 3,858 oil and gas platforms extant in the Gulf of Mexico in 2006]]
In British waters, the cost of removing all platform rig structures entirely was estimated in 2013 at £30 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/reports/decommissioning-in-the-north-sea.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquatic organisms invariably attach themselves to the undersea portions of oil platforms, turning them into artificial reefs. In the Gulf of Mexico and offshore California, the waters around oil platforms are popular destinations for sports and commercial fishermen, because of the greater numbers of fish near the platforms. The [[United States]] and [[Brunei]] have active [[Rigs-to-Reefs]] programs, in which former oil platforms are left in the sea, either in place or towed to new locations, as permanent artificial reefs. In the US [[Gulf of Mexico]], as of September 2012, 420 former oil platforms, about 10 percent of decommissioned platforms, have been converted to permanent reefs.&lt;ref&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, [http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/habitat_conservation/documents/pdfs/efh/gulf_decommissioning_and_rigs_to_reefs_faqs_final.pdf Gulf decomissioning and Rigs-to-Reefs, FAQs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109224846/http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/habitat_conservation/documents/pdfs/efh/gulf_decommissioning_and_rigs_to_reefs_faqs_final.pdf |date=2013-11-09 }}, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the US Pacific coast, [[marine biologist]] Milton Love has proposed that oil platforms off California be retained as [[artificial reef]]s, instead of being dismantled (at great cost), because he has found them to be havens for many of the species of fish which are otherwise declining in the region, in the course of 11 years of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Page M, Dugan J, Love M, Lenihan H |title=Ecological Performance and Trophic Links: Comparisons Among Platforms And Natural Reefs For Selected Fish And Their Prey |url=http://www.coastalresearchcenter.ucsb.edu/cmi/ecoperformance.html |publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara |accessdate=2008-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Love is funded mainly by government agencies, but also in small part by the [[California Artificial Reef Enhancement Program]]. [[Professional diving#Scientific diving|Divers]] have been used to assess the [[fish]] populations surrounding the platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=SA Cox |author2=CR Beaver |author3=QR Dokken |author4=JR Rooker.  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Diver-based under water survey techniques used to assess fish populations and fouling community development on offshore oil and gas platform structures |journal=In: MA Lang, CC Baldwin (Eds.) the Diving for Science...1996, "Methods and Techniques of Underwater Research". |volume=Proceedings of the American Academy of Underwater Sciences |issue=16th Annual Scientific Diving Symposium |year=1996 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4689 |accessdate=2008-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==
Offshore oil and gas production is more challenging than land-based installations due to the remote and harsher environment. Much of the innovation in the offshore petroleum sector concerns overcoming these challenges, including the need to provide very large production facilities. Production and drilling facilities may be very large and a large investment, such as the [[Troll A platform]] standing on a depth of 300 meters.

Another type of offshore platform may float with a mooring system to maintain it on location. While a floating system may be lower cost in deeper waters than a fixed platform, the dynamic nature of the platforms introduces many challenges for the drilling and production facilities.

The ocean can add several thousand meters or more to the [[fluid column]]. The addition increases the equivalent circulating density and downhole pressures in drilling wells, as well as the energy needed to lift produced fluids for separation on the platform.

The trend today is to conduct more of the production operations [[subsea]], by separating water from oil and re-injecting it rather than pumping it up to a platform, or by flowing to onshore, with no installations visible above the sea. Subsea installations help to exploit resources at progressively deeper waters—locations which had been inaccessible—and overcome challenges posed by sea ice such as in the [[Barents Sea]]. One such challenge in shallower environments is [[Seabed gouging by ice|seabed gouging by drifting ice features]] (means of protecting offshore installations against ice action includes burial in the seabed).

Offshore manned facilities also present logistics and human resources challenges. An offshore oil platform is a small community in itself with cafeteria, sleeping quarters, management and other support functions. In the North Sea, staff members are transported by helicopter for a two-week shift. They usually receive higher salary than onshore workers do. Supplies and waste are transported by ship, and the supply deliveries need to be carefully planned because storage space on the platform is limited. Today, much effort goes into relocating as many of the personnel as possible onshore, where management and technical experts are in touch with the platform by video conferencing. An onshore job is also more attractive for the aging workforce in the [[petroleum industry]], at least in the western world. These efforts among others are contained in the established term [[integrated operations]]. The increased use of subsea facilities helps achieve the objective of keeping more workers onshore. Subsea facilities are also easier to expand, with new separators or different modules for different oil types, and are not limited by the fixed floor space of an above-water installation.

== Effects on the environment ==
Offshore oil production involves environmental risks, most notably [[oil spill]]s from oil tankers or pipelines transporting oil from the platform to onshore facilities, and from leaks and accidents on the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Debate Over Offshore Drilling|medium=internet video|publisher=''[[CBS News]]''|date=2008|url=http://www.webcastr.com/videos/news/debate-over-offshore-drilling.html|accessdate=2008-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824002817/http://www.webcastr.com/videos/news/debate-over-offshore-drilling.html|archive-date=2008-08-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Produced water]] is also generated, which is water brought to the surface along with the oil and gas; it is usually highly saline and may include dissolved or unseparated hydrocarbons.

==Deepest oil platforms==
The world's deepest oil platform is the floating [[Perdido (oil platform)|Perdido]], which is a [[Spar (platform)|spar platform]] in the Gulf of Mexico in a water depth of {{convert|2438|m}}.

'''Photoinduced electron transfer''' ('''PET''') is an excited state [[electron transfer]] process by which an excited electron is transferred from donor to acceptor.&lt;ref&gt;"Highlights of the spectroscopy, photochemistry and electrochemistry of [M(CO)4(α-diimine)] complexes, M=Cr, Mo, W" Antonín Vlcek ''Coord. Chem. Rev.'' 230 (2002) 225-242.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Organic and Inorganic Photochemistry" V. Ramamurthy and Kirk S. Schanze 1998 Marcel Dekker {{ISBN|0-8247-0174-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to PET a charge separation is generated, ''i.e.'', [[redox]] reaction takes place in excited state (this phenomenon is not observed in [[Dexter electron transfer]]).

== Breadth ==

Such materials include [[semiconductors]] that can be photoactivated like many [[solar cells]], biological systems such as those used in [[photosynthesis]], and small molecules with suitable [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]]s and redox states.

== Process ==

It is common to describe where electrons reside as [[electron band]]s in bulk materials and [[Molecular orbital|electron orbitals]] in [[molecule]]s. For the sake of expedience the following description will be described in molecular terms.  When a photon excites a molecule, an electron in a ground state orbital can be excited to a higher energy orbital.  This excited state leaves a vacancy in a ground state orbital that can be filled by an [[electron donor]].  It produces an electron in a high energy orbital which can be donated to an [[electron acceptor]].  In these respects a photoexcited molecule can act as a good [[oxidizing agent]] or a good [[reducing agent]].

:'''Photoinduced Oxidation'''

:[ML&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + hν → [ML&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;*

:[ML&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;* + donor → [ML&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + donor&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

:'''Photoinduced Reduction'''

:[ML&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + hν → [ML&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;*

:[ML&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;* + acceptor → [ML&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + acceptor&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The end result of both reactions is that an electron is delivered to an orbital that is higher in energy than where it previously resided.  This is often described as a charge separated electron-hole pair when working with [[semiconductors]].

In the absence of a proper electron donor or acceptor it is possible for such molecules to undergo ordinary [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|fluorescence emission]].  The electron transfer is one form of [[Quenching (fluorescence)|photoquenching]].

== Subsequent processes ==

In many photo-productive systems this charge separation is kinetically isolated by delivery of the electron to a lower energy [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] attached to the p/n junction or into an [[electron transport chain]].  In this case some of the energy can be captured to do work.  If the electron is not kinetically isolated thermodynamics will take over and the products will react with each other to regenerate the ground state starting material.  This process is called recombination and the photon's energy is released as heat.

:'''Recombination of Photoinduced Oxidation'''

:[ML&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + donor&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → [ML&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + donor

== Potential induced photon production ==

The reverse process to photoinduced electron transfer is displayed by [[light emitting diodes]] (LED) and [[chemiluminescence]].  Where potential gradients are used to create excited states that decay by light emission.

==Classification==
Aquatics video monitoring systems are broken into two categories:
* Passive
* Active

Passive systems provide lifeguards with views of below water swimmer activity and behaviour. The views are displayed at the lifeguard position/chair allowing them to incorporate them into their 10:20 scan to help with early identification of an incident developing or abnormal events occurring. They are primarily a means of addressing the physical limitations of viewing through glare and into blind spots in the swimming pool tank. They are designed to make the lifeguard's job easier.
Active systems are designed to further help lifeguards in an attempt to address the physical limitations imposed by the human factor.  

Monitoring systems are further broken into three broad classes:
* Surveillance for safety and security 
* Remote monitoring
* Computer-aided drowning detection.

== Surveillance for safety and security ==

Viewing aids are typically underwater video cameras for [[lifeguards]] to see various views underwater simultaneously from a single location&lt;ref&gt;High-tech tools can help lifeguards prevent drowning, By Sarah Sookman, CBC News, Jul 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Preventing Drowning Accidents Using Thermal Cameras, Soren BonderupJonas Olsson,  Lecture Notes in Computer Science book series (LNCS, volume 10073)&lt;/ref&gt;. They can be used for all types of swimming pools. Cameras can view areas which would otherwise be obstructed. These passive systems while providing additional vision for the lifeguards can also distract them from scanning the pool because of the moving images on the monitor next to them.  All cameras are recorded in real-time and the below water cameras are normally paired with above water cameras providing face-to-body matching if there is an incident where a swimmer needs to be identified but may not show their face below the water, for example [[pedophilia]] &lt;ref&gt;Underwater camera traps pervert in swimming pool, St. Helen's Reporter, Thursday 10 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swimming pools install underwater cameras to deter paedophiles, Irish Examiner, March 30, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paedo caught on underwater CCTV stalking kids at swimming baths,  3rd April 2018, Daily Star, Sunday&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;City-owned pools to get security cameras to deter sexual predators, by Jeff Keele, Political Reporter, CTV News Winnipeg, Published Monday, October 17, 2016 12:34PM CST&lt;/ref&gt;, or other offenses &lt;ref&gt;Teenie-Sex im Thermalbad

[[Image:Maglifter.jpg|thumb|right|350px|An example of rocket sled launch assist: NASA's Maglifter proposal for giving a 500+ ton rocket initial velocity from a mountain.]]

A '''rocket sled launch''', also known as "ground based launch assist", "catapult launch assist", and "sky ramp launch", is a proposed method for [[Non-rocket spacelaunch|launching]] [[space]] vehicles. With this concept the launch vehicle is supported by an eastward pointing rail or maglev track that goes up the side of a mountain while an externally applied force is used to accelerate the launch vehicle to a given velocity.  Using an externally applied force for the initial acceleration reduces the propellant the launch vehicle needs to carry to reach orbit.  This allows the launch vehicle to carry a larger payload and reduces the cost of getting to orbit.  When the amount of velocity added to the launch vehicle by the ground accelerator becomes great enough, [[single-stage-to-orbit]] flight with a reusable launch vehicle becomes possible.

For hypersonic research in general, tracks at [[Holloman Air Force Base]] have tested, as of 2011, small rocket sleds moving at up to {{convert|6453|mph|km/h|abbr=on|}} (Mach 8.5).&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. Air Force: {{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123004755|title=Test Sets World Land Speed Record|accessdate=April 24, 2011|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120604184801/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123004755|archivedate=June 4, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effectively a 'sky ramp' would make the most expensive, first stage of a rocket fully reusable since the sled is returned to its starting position, to be refueled and may be reused in the order of hours after use. Present launch vehicles have performance-driven costs of [[Rocket#Costs and economics|thousands of dollars per kilogram of dry weight]]; sled launch would aim to reduce performance requirements and amortize hardware expenses over frequent, repeated launches.  Designs for mountain based inclined rail 'rocket' sleds often use jet engines or rockets to accelerate the spacecraft mounted on it. Electromagnetic methods (such as Bantam, Maglifter, and [[StarTram]]) are another technique investigated to accelerate a rocket before launch, potentially scalable to greater rocket masses and velocities than [[air launch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ias-spes.org/SPESIF2010/Plenary%20I/Rather_abs.html|title=Transformational Technologies to Expedite Space Access and Development|publisher=SPESIF, Dr. John Rather, prior Assistant Director for Space Technology Program Development at [[NASA]]|accessdate=28 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323091323/http://www.ias-spes.org/SPESIF2010/Plenary%20I/Rather_abs.html|archivedate=23 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = NASAmaglifter&gt;{{cite web|citeseerx=10.1.1.110.9317|title=Maglifter Tradeoff Study and Subscale System Demonstrations|publisher=NASA|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the problem==
[[NASA]] studies have shown that the [[Space Shuttle]] used more than a third of its fuel just to reach {{convert|1000|mph|km/h|abbr=on|}}.&lt;ref&gt;''NASA: {{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/reference/basics/launch.html|title=Space Shuttle Basics|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If a rocket were already moving at launch, with corresponding reduced propellant needs, a greater fraction of liftoff mass could have been payload and hardware.

==An example==

Due to factors including the exponential nature of the [[rocket equation]] and higher [[propulsive efficiency#Rocket engines|propulsive efficiency]] than if a rocket takes off stationary, a [[NASA]] Maglifter study estimated that a {{convert|270|m/s|mph|abbr=on}} launch of an [[Expendable launch system|ELV]] rocket from a 3000-meter altitude mountain peak could increase payload to [[Low earth orbit|LEO]] by 80% compared to the same rocket from a conventional [[launch pad]].&lt;ref name = MaglifterMankins&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=24756.0;attach=288934|title=The Maglifter: An Advanced Concept Using Electromagnetic Propulsion in Reducing the Cost of Space Launch|publisher=NASA|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mountains of such height are available [[Mountain peaks of the United States|within the mainland U.S.]] for the easiest logistics, or nearer to the Equator for a little more gain from [[Earth's rotation]]. Among other possibilities, a larger [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) could be reduced in liftoff mass by 35% with such launch assist, dropping to 4 instead of 6 engines in one case considered.&lt;ref name = MaglifterMankins/&gt;

At an anticipated efficiency close to 90%, electrical energy consumed per launch of a 500-ton rocket would be around 30 [[Joule#Gigajoule|GJ]], 8000 [[kilowatt hour]]s (each kilowatt-hour costing a few cents at the current [[cost of electricity]] in the United States), aside from any additional losses in energy storage. It is a system with low marginal costs dominated by initial capital costs&lt;ref name = NASAmaglifter/&gt;  Although a fixed site, it was estimated to provide a substantial net payload increase for a high portion of the varying launch azimuths needed by different satellites, with rocket maneuvering during the early stage of post-launch ascent (an alternative to adding [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] for later [[orbital inclination change]]).  Maglev guideway costs were estimated as $10 – $20 million per mile in the 1994 study, which had anticipated annual maglev maintenance costs on the order of 1% of capital costs.&lt;ref name = MaglifterMankins/&gt;

==Benefits of high altitude launches==

Rocket sled launch helps a vehicle gain altitude, and proposals commonly involve the track curving up a mountain.  Advantages to any launch system that starts from high altitudes include reduce [[gravity drag]] (the cost of lifting fuel in a gravity well).  The thinner air will reduce [[air resistance]] and allow more efficient engine geometries.  Rocket nozzles have different shapes (expansion ratios) to maximize thrust at different air pressures. (Though NASA's [[aerospike engine]] for the [[Lockheed Martin X-33]] was designed to change geometry to remain efficient at a variety of different pressures, the aerospike engine had added weight and complexity; [[Lockheed Martin X-33|X-33]] funding was canceled in 2001; and other benefits from launch assist would remain even if aerospike engines reached flight testing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/engines/rs2200.htm|title=RS-2200|accessdate=April 28, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317035653/http://www.astronautix.com/engines/rs2200.htm|archivedate=March 17, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/x-33/aero_faq.htm|title=The Aerospike Nozzle|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the air is 39% thinner at 2500 meters. The more efficient rocket plume geometry and the reduced air friction allows the engine to be 5% more efficient per amount of fuel burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/design/aerospike/compensation.shtml|title=Altitude Compensation|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another advantage to high altitude launches is that it eliminates the need to throttle back the engine when the "[[Max Q]]" limit is attained.  Rockets launched in thick atmosphere can go so fast that air resistance may cause structural damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/dynpress.html|title=Dynamic Pressure|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Engines are throttled back when Max Q is reached, until the rocket is high enough that they can resume full power.  The [[Atlas V]] 551 gives an example of this.  It reaches its Max Q at 30,000 feet.  Its engine is throttled back to 60% thrust for 30 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/design_lib/Atlas5.pl.guide.pdf|title=Atlas Launch System Mission Planner's Guide|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This reduced acceleration adds to the gravity drag the rocket must overcome.  Additionally, space craft engines concerned with Max Q are more complex as they must be throttled during launch.

A launch from high altitude need not throttle back at Max Q as it starts above the thickest portion of the Earth's atmosphere.

Debora A. Grant and James L. Rand in: "The Balloon Assisted Launch System - A Heavy Lift Balloon"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406&amp;gTable=mtgpaper&amp;gID=2127|title=The Balloon Assisted Launch System|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote: "It was established some time ago that a ground launched rocket capable of reaching 20 km would be able to reach an altitude of almost 100km if it was launched from 20km."  They suggest that small rockets are lifted above the majority of the atmosphere by balloon in order to avoid the problems discussed above.

==Compatibility with reusable launch vehicles==

Rocket sleds at China Lake testing ground have reached Mach 4 while carrying 60,000&amp;nbsp;kg masses.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} A sled track that gave a Mach 2 or greater launch assist could reduce the fuel to orbit by 40% or more, while helping counter the [[Reusable launch system#Weight penalty|weight penalty]] when aiming to make a fully [[Reusable launch system|reusable launch vehicle]].  Angled at 55 degrees to vertical, a track on a tall mountain could allow a single stage to orbit reusable vehicle with no new technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g2mil.com/timeline.htm|title=Sky Ramp Technology|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rocket sled launches in fiction==
*[[Robert A. Heinlein]] used a lunar maglev launcher in [[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]].  One on Earth was built by the novel's end.
*[[Dean Ing]] used a similar system in his 1988 novel "The Big Lifters".
*[[Fireball XL5]] was launched on a sled from sea level.
*[[When Worlds Collide (1951 film)|When Worlds Collide (film)]] used a rocket sled to launch the Ark, but the book did not.
*[[Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel!|Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel]] has a rocket sled in its initial cutscene.
*[[Permission To Die (Graphic Novel)]] in an original James Bond story by Mike Grell, a sled-propelled rocket plays a crucial element to the plot.
*[[Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War]] (Video Game) Features a mission requiring a Rocket Sled site to be defended during a launch.

== Work ==
Since the 1960s, Roy Ascott has been a practitioner of [[interactive]] [[computer art]], [[electronic art]], [[cybernetic art]] and [[telematic art]].


The historian of art and technology [[Frank Popper]] writes of Roy Ascott:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Frank|title=From Technological to Virtual Art|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-262-16230-2|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Roy Ascott was among the first artists to launch an appeal for total spectator participation ... At present, Ascott is one of the most outstanding artists and theoreticians in the field of telematics.
}}

In his first show (1964) at the Molton Gallery, London [http://telematic.walkerart.org/timeline/timeline_shanken.html], he exhibited ''Analogue Structures and Diagram Boxes'', comprising change-paintings and other works in wood, perspex and glass. In 1964 Ascott published "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" in ''Cybernetica: journal of the International Association for Cybernetics'' (Namur). In 1968,  he was elected Associate Member of the Institution of Computer Science, London (proposed by [[Gordon Pask]]). In 1972, he became a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]].

Ascott has shown at the [[Venice Biennale]], [[Shanghai Biennale]], Electra Paris, [[Ars Electronica]], [[V2 Institute for the Unstable Media]]  [http://framework.v2.nl/archive/archive/leaf/other/default.xslt/nodenr-143122], Milan Triennale, Biennale do Mercosul, [[Brazil]], European Media Festival, and gr2000az at [[Graz]], Austria. His first telematic project was ''La Plissure du Texte'' (1983),  [http://telematic.walkerart.org/timeline/timeline_ascott.html]  an online work of "distributed authorship" involving artists around the world. The second was his "gesamtdatenwerk" ''Aspects of Gaia: Digital Pathways across the Whole Earth'' (1989), an installation for the [[Ars Electronica]] Festival in Linz, discussed by  (inter alia) Matthew Wilson Smith in ''The Total Work of Art: from Bayreuth to Cyberspace'', New York: Routledge, 2007. Retrospective exhibitions of his work were shown in May 2009 at Plymouth Arts Centre, England,  then in the Incheon International Digital Arts Festival, Incheon, South Korea in September 2010, and at [[SPACE (studios)]] in Hackney, London in 2011. ''Syncretic Cybernetics'', a comprehensive exhibition of his work, was featured in the 9th [[Shanghai Biennale]] 2012. ''Roy Ascott: The Analogues'' (featuring his work of the 1960s) was shown at the Plug-in Institute ofContemporary Arts [http://www.plugin.org/exhibitions/2013/roy-ascott-analogues], Winnipeg, July-Sept 2013. In September 2014, a mini retrospective of his work was shown in Linz, at the time of his Ars Electronica Golden Nica award [http://www.art-in-berlin.de/royascott2.mp4]. He discussed his work on Geran TV [http://www.art-in-tv.de/videoplaytv.php?id=1525].
The seminal work of 1962, "Video-Roget" [http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/ascott-video-roget-t13977] was acquired in 2014, by the Tate Gallery, London for its permanent collection. Two key works were included in "Electronic Superhighway", at the Whitechapel Gallery, London in 2016 [http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/about/press/press-release-electronic-superhighway/]. "Art in Europe 1945-68" shown in ZKM, Karlsruhr, Germany Oct 2016/ Jan 2017, included his "Change-painting 1966" [http://zkm.de/en/event/2016/10/art-in-europe-1945-1968]. His early work was the subject of the exhibition "Roy Ascott: Form has Behaviour", at the Henry Moore Institute, Leeds, Jan/Apr 2017 [https://www.henry-moore.org/whats-on/2017/01/25/roy-ascott-form-has-behaviour]. 

== Interactive computer art ==
Since the 1960s, Ascott has been a working with interactive [[computer art]], [[telematic art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artmuseum.net/w2vr/timeline/Ascott.html artmuseum.net]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[systems art]]. Ascott built a theoretical framework for approaching interactive artworks, which brought together certain characteristics of [[Dada]], [[Surrealism]], [[Fluxus]], [[Happenings]], and [[Pop Art]] with the science of [[cybernetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouthartscentre.org/art/royascott.html|title=Plymouth Arts Centre Blog|work=Plymouth Arts Centre Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also influenced by the writings of [[Gordon Pask]], [[Anthony Stafford Beer]], [[William Ross Ashby]], and [[Frank Honywill George|F.H. George]].&lt;ref&gt;A critical survey of Ascott's work is provided by [[Edward A. Shanken]] in his introductory essay "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott" in Ascott, R. 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3305">'''Segmentation Rules eXchange''' or '''SRX''' is an [[XML]]-based [[Technical Standard|standard]] that was maintained by [[Localization Industry Standards Association]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090523015600/http://www.lisa.org/Segmentation-Rules-e.40.0.html SRX home] - Archived copy of main SRX page on the LISA OSCAR web site&lt;/ref&gt; until it became insolvent in 2011, and then by GALA.&lt;ref&gt;Globalization and Localization Association - [http://www.gala-global.org/lisa-oscar-standards Page on the OSCAR LISA Standards]&lt;/ref&gt;

SRX provides a common way to describe how to segment text for translation and other language-related processes. It was created when it was realized that TMX was less useful than expected in certain instances due to differences in how tools segment text. SRX is intended to enhance the [[Translation Memory eXchange|TMX standard]] so that [[translation memory]] (TM) data that is exchanged between applications can be used more effectively. Having the segmentation rules that were used when a TM was created increases the usefulness of the TM data.

==Implementation difficulties==
SRX make use of the [[International Components for Unicode|ICU]] Regular Expression syntax,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090220072525/http://www.lisa.org/fileadmin/standards/srx20.html#Intro_RegExp SRX regular Expressions] - Archived copy&lt;/ref&gt; but not all programming languages support all ICU expressions, making implementing SRX in some languages difficult or impossible. Java is an example of this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opentag.com/okapi/wiki/index.php?title=SRX_and_Java Java and SRX] - Comparison between SRX and Java regular expressions&lt;/ref&gt;

==Version history==
SRX version 1.0&lt;ref&gt;SRX 1.0 specification - {{cite web |url=http://www.gala-global.org/oscarStandards/srx/srx10.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801195826/http://www.gala-global.org/oscarStandards/srx/srx10.html |archivedate=2012-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was officially accepted as an OSCAR standard in April 2004.

SRX version 2.0&lt;ref&gt;SRX 2.0 specification - http://www.gala-global.org/oscarStandards/srx/srx20.html&lt;/ref&gt; was officially accepted as an OSCAR standard in April 2008.

SRX forms part of the [[Open Architecture]] for XML Authoring and Localization ([[OAXAL]]) reference architecture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14507">'''Social media in education''' refers to the practice of using [[social media]] platforms as a way to enhance the [[education]] of students. Social media is defined as "a group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchange of [user-generated content".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaplan|first1=Andreas M.|last2=Haenlein|first2=Michael|title=Users of the world, unite!

==Student Devices==
Student use of computers as learning aids began in the early 1980s when drilling and practice programs were first developed and implemented into the classroom &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers_in_the_classroom|title=Computers in the classroom|website=www.wikipedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Following the 1980s was a computer advancement boom that defined the 1990s and 2000s as CD-ROMS were first introduced and the internet became more user friendly. As of 2018, 95% of teenage students have access to a smartphone and 45% say they are online almost constantly &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018/|title=Teens, Social Media, &amp; Technology|last1=Anderson|first1=Monica|website=www.pewinternet.org|publisher=PEW Research|accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As the use of technology and social media has become more prevalent, some educators and parents argued that they were too distracting for the classroom environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kist|first1=W.|title=Class get ready to tweet: Social media in the classroom|journal=Our Children|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ991339.pdf|date=December 2012 – January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to many schools blocking [[Internet access]], including access to social media sites, and even disallowing the use of cell phones to class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 33| issue = 1| pages = 41–47| last1 = Obringer| first1 = S. John| last2 = Coffey| first2 = Kent| title = Cell Phones in American High Schools: A National Survey.| journal = Journal of Technology Studies| date = 2007| url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ847358| doi=10.21061/jots.v33i1.a.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These policies proved to be ineffective in some cases, as students continue to bring their phones to class despite the no cell phone policy, and many even find ways to access social media sites regardless of precautions taken by school administrators.  

In response to these challenges, many schools have adopted a "[[Bring your own device|Bring Your Own Device]]" (BYOD) policy to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 3| issue = 8| pages = 42–45| last = Sangani| first = Kris| title = BYOD to the classroom| journal = Engineering &amp; Technology| date = 2013| url = https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.ieee-art-000006495438}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a policy that allows students to bring their own internet accessing device, such as a phone or [[iPad]], for the purpose of accessing the Internet for research and other in-class activities. While the BYOD concept was initially introduced as a way of reducing departmental technology costs, administrators and teachers are realizing other benefits from BYOD policies, such as increased student motivations and engagement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 74| pages = 50 60| last = Song| first = Yanjie| title =Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) for seamless science inquiry in a primary school| journal = Computers &amp; Education| date = 2014| url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131514000153| doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2014.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anywhere access to information. 

==Device Integration in the Classroom==

Technology integration can be described as involving student needs rather than revolving around teacher needs. In a classroom with a whiteboard and a single computer, the learning will revolve round the teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edutopia.org/technology-integration-guide-description|title=What Is Successful Technology Integration?|last1=Shaffner|first1=Marian|website=Edutopia|publisher=George Lucas Educational Foundation|accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the use of technology, the learning environment can be expanded. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachhub.com/benefits-technology-classroom|title=Benefits of Technology in the Classroom|last1=Cox|first1=Janelle|website=TeachHUB|accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of technology in the classroom can be very positive. Technology can support and improve the learning environment. As technology is becoming more predominant in the world today, teachers believe that developing these technological skills among students can be very beneficial for entering the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ctl.yale.edu/Using-Electronic-Devices-in-Class|title=Use of Electronic Devices in Class|website=Yale Center for Teaching and Learning|publisher=Yale|accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology creation of online textbooks has made tablets and laptops widely popular in the classroom. With this ability, students are able to have readily available access to this resource anywhere at any time. Laptops can be used to quickly access information in the classroom and gather knowledge. They can be used for interactive activities involving polls, note taking, recording data, and research. 

The impact of using technology within classrooms can have a negative effect as well. A study shows that students who used laptops in class for nonacademic reasons had poorer class performance overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ctl.yale.edu/Using-Electronic-Devices-in-Class|title=Use of Electronic Devices in Class|website=Yale Center for Teaching and Learning|publisher=Yale|accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These students spent most of their time on social media websites, online shopping, and other personal usage.

== Apps and Services ==
The recent developments in technology have changed how and what students learn in a classroom. The internet gives students access to more resources than ever before, in terms of both research and learning tools. Students are taught to be more critical in life overall when they have to decide which sources are credible or not when doing internet research &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Internet as a Learning Tool |url=http://www.csun.edu/~ac64224/paper2.html |website=www.csun.edu |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Students can also engage in [[active learning]] by using devices to participate in their field and [[Service-learning|service learning]] by working with organizations outside of the classroom to solve problems and create new projects &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kembel |first1=George |title=The Classroom in 2020 |url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/04/08/stanford-design-2020-technology-data-companies-10-education.html#26401e1e4ee4 |website=www.forbes.com |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Students can also use their devices to access [[learning management systems]] like [[Blackboard Inc.|Blackboard]] and Canvas. Students are able to complete their work anywhere as long as they have internet service, which grants them more freedom outside the classroom. 

Other apps have been developed that combine learning tasks with elements of social media. [[Quizlet]] is a new tool that helps students study in a new way&lt;!-- Be more specific. What is a "new way?" This shouldn't sound like an advertisement, but it should be more detailed.  --&gt;. Quizlet allows users to create flashcard sets that are always available to study. It also takes these card sets and automatically generates practice tests and other activities to help students study, which they can share with other users. There is opposition to learning websites such as Quizlet because some people believe they make it easier for students to cheat, claiming that students can use their phone during the test to look up answers and can pass off other students work as their own &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kolodny |first1=Lora |title=Popular study app Quizlet faces a moment of truth as a new school year begins |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/23/quizlet-a-popular-study-app-faces-a-moment-of-truth.html |website=www.cnbc.com |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

== Methods institutions use to communicate ==
College institutions are adapting many social media platforms into their educational systems to improve communication with students and the overall quality of student life.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lcibs.co.uk/the-role-of-social-media-in-education/|title=The Role of Social Media in Education|date=2017-07-20|work=LCIBS|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides colleges with an easy fast method of communication and allows them to give and receive feedback to students. Social media usage has skyrocketed over the past decade as present research shows that almost all college students use some form of social networking website. Conducted studies show that 99% of college students who use social media use Facebook and 35% use Twitter. Facebook and Twitter have become the dominant forms of social media platforms that have successfully grown in popularity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sponcil|first=Megan|last2=Gitimu|first2=Priscilla|date=2013|title=Use of social media by college students: Relationship to communication and self-concept.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alistair_Calder/post/Letting_students_drive_social_media_patterns_in_higher_ed/attachment/59d63bc679197b8077998cf8/AS:412709343514624@1475408983793/download/121214.pdf|journal=Journal of Technology Research|volume=4|pages=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube are widely used by educational institutions to make connecting with students and providing information convenient. Institutions also consider communicating information through the usage of technology a vital part in student success. In many classrooms across America, teachers have created social media pages for their classes on which they can post assignments as well as interact with their students. Schools have felt the need to make regulations for how students and faculty interact online. Many teachers stay away from "friending" of "following" their students online because it can become too personal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/01/26/579955559/teach-students-to-use-social-media-the-right-way-and-the-possibilities-are-endle|title=Teach Students To Use Social Media (The Right Way) And The Possibilities Are Endless|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Needs expansion at some point-- the article is about social media in education, and thus far there is no history of social media in education (only internet use in general) --&gt;Use of social media has helped some educators mentor their students more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=S.

Rather than compete with, or deny access to social media sites, some schools have totally embraced them, and are using them to further students' educations.&lt;ref name="Raths 2012 28"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raths|first=David|date=2012|title=Are You Ready for BYOD: Advice from the Trenches on How to Prepare Your Wireless Network for the Bring-Your-Own-Device Movement|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-292008620/are-you-ready-for-byod-advice-from-the-trenches-on|journal=THE Journal (Technological Horizons In Education)|volume=39|issue=4|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents, students, and teachers are using social media to connect and communicate inside and outside the classroom. Programs like Black Board, School loop, Top Hat, and Moodle have created platforms to enhance the learning experience by increasing communication between all parties. These sites are not necessarily social media websites, but their added communication features such as fourms create an experience that is similar to that of social media.&lt;!-- Unpack this a little more. These are LMSs, not social networks. But they have added features that mimic the social media experience. That's an important distinction. --&gt; Studies have shown that 96% of students have internet access, as well as access to at least one social media site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wade |first1=Lori |title="How Social Media is Reshaping Today's Education System" |website=www.georgetown.com |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Teachers are taking risks when choosing to communicate with students outside of the classroom, especially when they are private conversations through social media. Transparency is the key to communicating with students. Teachers are choosing to use Twitter as a way to talk to their students in a safe and transparent way because it is a social media site where the posts and comments are open to the public.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3573">A '''tandem-charge''' or '''dual-charge''' weapon is an [[explosive]] device or [[projectile]] that has two or more stages of detonation.

==Anti-tank==
[[File:RPG-29 USGov.JPG|thumb|An [[RPG-29]] and its PG-29V rocket with a tandem-charge warhead]]
[[File:Army-fgm148.jpg|thumb|The self-guided [[FGM-148 Javelin]] missile has a tandem-charge warhead]]
[[Tandem]] charges are effective against [[reactive armour]], which is designed to protect an [[armoured vehicle]] (mostly tanks) against [[Anti-tank warfare|anti-tank]] munitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/baes-lrod-cage-armor-03473 BAE’s Lrod Cage Armour - Defense Industry Daily&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage of the weapon is typically a weak charge that either pierces the reactive armour of the target without detonating it leaving a channel through the reactive armour so that the second warhead may pass unimpeded, or simply detonating the armourplate causing the timing of the counter-explosion to fail. The second detonation from the same projectile (which defines it as a tandem charge) attacks the same location as the first detonation where the reactive armour has been compromised. Since the regular armour plating is often the only defence remaining, the main charge (second detonation) has an increased likelihood of penetrating the armour.

However, tandem-charges are useful only against ERA (explosive reactive armour) types of reactive armour, much less so against the [[Reactive armour#Non-explosive and non-energetic reactive armour|non-explosive reactive armour (NxRA)]] types, since their inner liner is not explosive itself and thus not expended by the small forward warhead of tandem-charge attack.

The [[PG-7VR]] warhead for the [[RPG-7]] rocket launcher and the PG-29V warhead for the more modern [[RPG-29]] rocket launcher are examples of tandem charges, but the technology is employed worldwide because they were designed in the Cold War era to counter the reactive armour that was a common feature on Soviet tanks. Examples of missiles that use tandem charges include the [[BGM-71 TOW]], [[FGM-148 Javelin]], [[Brimstone (missile)|Brimstone]] and the [[MBT LAW]].

==Penetrating weapons==
[[File:Storm Shadow p1220865.jpg|thumb|The [[Storm Shadow]] missile uses a tandem-charge warhead to penetrate hardened structures]]
Dual charges are also effective at increasing the effectiveness of warheads when used against structures (such as bunkers).  Because the explosion of a unitary [[high explosive]] charge will follow the path of least resistance, much of the explosive power of a warhead will be lost to the air surrounding the target if detonated outside the structure. This effect can be countered by using heavily constructed gravity bombs with delay [[fuze]]s which penetrate the earth, concrete, etc. of the target before exploding—thus containing the explosion inside the structure and significantly increasing its effect.

Gravity bombs require aircraft to fly rather close to what may be a heavily-defended target which poses a significant risk to the launch aircraft. Cruise missiles equipped with large tandem-charge warheads can use the first charge to create a hole into which the missile flies before exploding the second charge, creating a similar effect of the delayed gravity bomb. An example of an anti-structure tandem-charge warhead is the [[BROACH]] warhead.

}}
A '''techno-thriller''' (also known as '''technothrillers''') is a hybrid genre drawing from [[science fiction]], [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]s, [[spy fiction]], [[action (fiction)|action]], and [[War novel|war novels]]. They include a disproportionate amount (relative to other genres) of technical details on their subject matter (typically military technology); only [[hard science fiction]] tends towards a comparable level of supporting detail on the technical side. The inner workings of technology and the mechanics of various disciplines ([[espionage]], [[martial arts]], [[politics]]) are thoroughly explored, and the plot often turns on the particulars of that exploration.

== History ==
One of the earliest techno-thrillers is thought to be ''[[The Satan Bug (novel)|The Satan Bug]]'' (1962) by [[Alistair MacLean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gullcottageonline.com/Buried_Treas.html|title=Alistair MacLean's THE SATAN BUG: Birth of the Techno-Thriller - by CEJ|work=gullcottageonline}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Michael Crichton]] and [[Tom Clancy]] are considered to be the fathers of the "modern techno-thriller";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1993-04-11/features/9302050353_1_tom-clancy-clancy-novel-fiction|title=Father Of Our Country? Tom Clancy Created The Techno-thriller, And He Did It With A Pro-american Mindset.|work=tribunedigital-sunsentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crichton's book ''[[The Andromeda Strain]]'' and Clancy's book ''[[The Hunt for Red October]]'' set out the type example which defined the genre, although many authors had been writing similar material earlier, such as [[Craig Thomas (author)|Craig Thomas]], whom [[BBC News]] also credits as an early innovator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-13012763|title=Techno thriller writer Craig Thomas dies|author=&lt;!-- Staff --&gt;|work=[[BBC News]]|date=8 April 2011|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
Techno-thrillers focus strongly on details, especially on the technology, which is frequently of military origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-10-02/entertainment/bs-md-clancy-appreciation-20131002_1_tom-clancy-cold-war-red-october|title=Clancy invented 'techno-thriller,' reflected Cold War fears|last=Kaltenbach|first=Chris|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=2 October 2013|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/10/02/tom-clancy-appreciation/2908305/|title=Appreciation: Tom Clancy mastered the techno-thriller|last=Minzesheimer|first=Bob|work=[[USA Today]]|date=3 October 2013|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Techno-thrillers tend to have a broad scope in the narrative, and can often be regarded as contemporary speculative fiction; world wars are a common topic. Techno-thrillers often overlap, as far as the genre goes, with near-future science fiction, [[War_novel|military fiction]], and [[Spy_fiction|espionage fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.writersdigest.com/writing-articles/by-writing-genre/varieties-of-the-technothriller-genre|title=Crypto, Sci-Fi, Soldiers, Spies (and Disasters): 5 Varieties Within the Technothriller Genre|last=Boush|first=Sam|work=[[Writer's Digest]]|date=19 July 2018|accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that technology is now a dominant aspect of modern global culture, most modern thrillers are "techno-thrillers", and the genre is somewhat diffuse. Techno-thrillers blur smoothly into the category of [[hard science fiction]]; the defining characteristics of techno-thriller are an emphasis on real-world or plausible near-future technology. There is often a focus on military or military-political action. Techno-thrillers also overlap with [[conspiracy fiction]] and [[apocalyptic fiction]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9056">The '''Obscene Device Law''' is a [[Texas]] [[statute]] prohibiting the sale of [[sex toy]]s. The law was introduced in 1973, and was last updated in 2003. While the law technically remains in effect, in 2008 a U.S. District Judge released a report declaring it to be "facially unconstitutional and unenforceable".

==History==
In 1973, the [[Texas Legislature]] passed Section 43.21 of the [[Texas Penal Code]], which, in part, prohibited the sale or promotion of "obscene devices"', being defined as "a device including a [[dildo]] or [[artificial vagina]], designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of [[Sex organ|human genital organs]]." The legislation was last updated in 2003, and Section 43.23 currently states "A person commits an offense if, knowing its content and character, he wholesale promotes or possesses with intent to wholesale promote any obscene material or obscene device."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.43.htm#43.23 |title=Penal Code Chapter 43.

==Prosecuted cases==
Prosecution under the statute is rare but has occasionally occurred. In [[Burleson, Texas|Burleson]] in 2004, Joanne Webb, a mother of three and a former schoolteacher, faced up to one year in prison for selling a [[Vibrator (sensual)|vibrator]] to two undercover police officers posing as a married couple at a private party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/LAW/02/11/obscenity.trial.reut/ |title=Texas mom faces trial for selling sex toys |date=February 11, 2004 |work=[[CNN]] |access-date=July 15, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130110202251/http://edition.cnn.com/2004/LAW/02/11/obscenity.trial.reut/ |archivedate=January 10, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was later acquitted, and the undercover officers were issued reprimands. In 2007, a [[lingerie]] shop in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] was raided, and items "deemed to be illegal by the Texas Penal Code" were confiscated. The clerk on duty at the time was arrested and may have had to [[Sex offender registries in the United States|register as a sex offender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.klbk13.tv/news/default.asp?mode=shownews&amp;id=2259 |title=Police Raid Lingerie Shop |date=May 21, 2007 |work=klbk13.tv |access-date=May 21, 2007 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070525044229/http://www.klbk13.tv/news/default.asp?mode=shownews&amp;id=2259 |archivedate=May 25, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, attorneys Mary and Ted Roberts used the obscenity statute in an elaborate extortion scheme against a number of men who had engaged in extramarital relations with Mary Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tdcaa.com/node/2483 |title=There's something about Mary1 … |date= |work=Texas District &amp; County Attorneys Association |access-date=July 15, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120918140525/http://www.tdcaa.com/node/2483 |archivedate=September 18, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeals==

Reliable Consultants, Inc., who operate four retail stores in Texas that carry a stock of sexual devices, and PHE, Inc., which is also engaged in the retail distribution of sexual devices through their website and catalogs, both filed [[lawsuit]]s against the legislation,{{when|date=July 2017}} claiming that the statute is [[unconstitutional]]. In an appeal from the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Texas]], a three-judge panel of the [[5th Circuit Court of Appeals]] overturned the statute on February 12, 2008, by a vote of 2–1, holding that "the statute has provisions that violate the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-5th-circuit/1263575.html |title=PHE v.

On July 3, 2008, the Texas 13th District Court of Appeals in Corpus Christi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Texas Office of Court Administration |url=http://www.13thcoa.courts.state.tx.us/ |title=Welcome to the official site of the Thirteenth Court of Appeals of Texas |publisher=13thcoa.courts.state.tx.us |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of Villareal vs. State,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.13thcoa.courts.state.tx.us/opinions/htmlopinion.asp?OpinionId=16906 |title=Texas Judiciary Online - HTML Opinion |publisher=13thcoa.courts.state.tx.us |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; addressed the ruling of the federal 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.  The 13th District Court of Appeals ruled that until the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rules that 43.23 is unconstitutional, the promotion of obscene devices remains illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dallascriminaldefenselawyerblog.com/2008/10/are-dildos-illegal-in-texas-ag.html |title=Are Dildos Illegal in Texas (again)? |last=Guest |first=Robert |date=October 6, 2008 |work=Dallas Criminal Defense Lawyer Blog |access-date=July 15, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730174954/http://www.dallascriminaldefenselawyerblog.com/2008/10/are-dildos-illegal-in-texas-ag.html |archivedate=July 30, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, despite the actions of the federal courts and the Texas Attorney General described elsewhere in this article, section 43.23 remains in effect in the twenty-county area of Texas covered by the jurisdiction of the 13th District Court of Appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://daxlegal.com/dildos-sexually-obscene-toys-illegal-in-texas-for-now/ |title=Dildos &amp; Sexually Obscene "Toys" Illegal in Texas … for now &amp;#124; Austin Attorney Dax Garvin |work=Dax Legal |date=January 31, 2012 |accessdate=July 15, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716030219/http://daxlegal.com/dildos-sexually-obscene-toys-illegal-in-texas-for-now/ |archivedate=July 16, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2008, the Fifth Circuit denied Texas's request to re-hear the case ''en banc''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/06/06-51067-CV1.wpd.pdf |title=United States Court of Appeals |publisher=Ca5.uscourts.gov |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The refusal created a split between federal circuits: the 5th Circuit overturned the Texas law and the 11th Circuit upheld a nearly identical Alabama law. That would usually mean that the United States Supreme Court would grant a writ of [[certiorari]] and rule in order to clear up the disagreement between the two circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2008/08/dildos_at_the_supreme_court.php |title=Dildos at the Supreme Court? |last=Brayton |first=Ed |date=August 11, 2008 |work=[[ScienceBlogs]] |access-date=August 11, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018121053/http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2008/08/dildos_at_the_supreme_court.php |archivedate=October 18, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, 2008, U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel released a two-page document dated October 29, 2008, in which he stated that the Texas Attorney General's Office notified him that they would not file a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court. The next month, on November 13, Yeakel filed a "joint status report" that noted the parties had come to an agreement. "Texas Penal Code §§ 43.23, to the extent that it applies to "obscene devices" as defined in Texas Penal Code § 43.21(a)(7), is declared to be facially unconstitutional and unenforceable throughout the State of Texas".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/document/322594597/2008-11-13-Texas-Western-Court-Order-Obscenity-Law&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TrafficDito''' is a free traffic monitoring website and [[GPS]]-enabled [[iOS]] application for [[iPhones]] launched in the Philippines on October 21, 2011 by the TrafficDito Team, a local startup in the country. It works by sorting through [[Twitter]] users’ public tweets and its iPhone app-generated traffic reports describing road conditions along major roads&lt;ref&gt;[http://trafficdito.com/about TrafficDito About page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114032504/http://trafficdito.com/about |date=2012-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.trafficdito.com/post/11719527743/trafficdito-now-ready-to-take-on-metro-manila TrafficDito Blog - TrafficDito now ready to take on Metro Manila gridlocks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223114236/http://blog.trafficdito.com/post/11719527743/trafficdito-now-ready-to-take-on-metro-manila |date=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the cities of [[Makati]], [[Pasig]], [[Caloocan]], [[Taguig]], [[Parañaque]], [[Manila]], [[Mandaluyong]], and [[Quezon City]].

== Website ==
Tweets and reports not older than 3 hours are filtered by an algorithm that will determine the expressed sentiment as light, moderate, or heavy traffic. They are then labeled, color-coded and displayed in a stream that can be sorted via search. TrafficDito currently does not support cities outside Metro Manila, nor can it be used in countries outside the Philippines.

== iPhone App ==
The TrafficDito iPhone application&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trafficdito/id472621182 App Store - TrafficDito - Apple]&lt;/ref&gt; has features not available on its browser-based counterpart. Users on the iPhone app can send geo-tagged traffic reports labeled by users as light, moderate, or heavy, alongside any optional text details that may be added. App users may then view the crowdsourced reports and geo-tagged tweets as color-coded dots overlaid on a [[Google map]] of Metro Manila.

In its latest updates,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.trafficdito.com/post/12920560734/pimp-my-app-td-gets-tricked-out TrafficDito Blog - Pimp My App: TD Gets Tricked Out] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113030349/http://blog.trafficdito.com/post/12920560734/pimp-my-app-td-gets-tricked-out |date=2012-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the iPhone app was given additional reporting features such as automatic bearing-detection, Twitter integration, offline mode, and the ability to display geo-tagged reports sourced from tweets&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.trafficdito.com/post/11979911617/itd-map TrafficDito Blog - iTD Map &lt;3 MMDA Reports] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120701175348/http://blog.trafficdito.com/post/11979911617/itd-map |date=2012-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]].

'''Tunnel magnetoresistance''' (TMR) is a [[magnetoresistance|magnetoresistive effect]] that occurs in a '''magnetic tunnel junction''' (MTJ), which is a component consisting of two [[ferromagnet]]s separated by a thin [[Insulator (electrical)|insulator]]. If the insulating layer is thin enough (typically a few [[nanometre]]s), [[electron]]s can [[Quantum tunneling|tunnel]] from one ferromagnet into the other. Since this process is forbidden in classical physics, the tunnel magnetoresistance is a strictly [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomenon.

Magnetic tunnel junctions are manufactured in [[thin film]] technology. On an industrial scale the film deposition is done by magnetron [[sputter deposition]]; on a laboratory scale [[molecular beam epitaxy]], [[pulsed laser deposition]] and [[electron beam physical vapor deposition]] are also utilized. The junctions are prepared by [[photolithography]].

== Phenomenological description ==

The direction of the two [[magnetization]]s of the ferromagnetic films can be switched individually by an external [[magnetic field]]. If the magnetizations are in a parallel orientation it is more likely that [[electron]]s will tunnel through the insulating film than if they are in the oppositional (antiparallel) orientation. Consequently, such a junction can be switched between two states of [[electrical resistance]], one with low and one with very high resistance.

== History ==

The effect was originally discovered in 1975 by Michel Jullière (University of Rennes, France) in [[iron|Fe]]/[[germanium|Ge]]-[[oxygen|O]]/[[cobalt|Co]]-junctions at 4.2 K. The relative change of resistance was around 14%, and did not attract much attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=M. Julliere | title=Tunneling between ferromagnetic films | journal=Phys.

Later, in 1994, Miyazaki found 18% in junctions of iron separated by an [[amorphous]] [[aluminum oxide]] insulator &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=T. Miyazaki  |author2=N.

Since the year 2000, tunnel barriers of [[crystalline]] [[magnesium oxide]] (MgO) have been under development. In 2001 Butler and Mathon independently made the theoretical prediction that using [[iron]] as the ferromagnet and [[MgO]] as the insulator, the tunnel magnetoresistance can reach several thousand percent.&lt;ref name=ButlerPRB2001&gt;{{cite journal |author1=W.

== Applications ==

The [[Disk read-and-write head|read-heads]] of modern [[hard disk drive]]s work on the basis of magnetic tunnel junctions. TMR, or more specifically the magnetic tunnel junction, is also the basis of [[MRAM]], a new type of [[non-volatile memory]]. The 1st generation technologies relied on creating cross-point magnetic fields on each bit to write the data on it, although this approach has a scaling limit at around 90–130&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="white paper"&gt;Barry Hoberman [http://www.crocus-technology.com/pdf/BH%20GSA%20Article.pdf The Emergence of Practical MRAM] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427022729/http://www.crocus-technology.com/pdf/BH%20GSA%20Article.pdf |date=2011-04-27 }}. Crocus Technologies&lt;/ref&gt; There are two 2nd generation techniques currently being developed: [[Thermal Assisted Switching]] (TAS)&lt;ref name="white paper"/&gt; and [[Spin Torque Transfer]] (STT). Magnetic tunnel junctions are also used for sensing applications. For example, a TMR-Sensor can measure angles in modern high precision [[Weather vane|wind vanes]], used in the wind power industry.

== Physical explanation ==

[[File:TunnelSchema TMR.svg|thumb|right|Two-current model for parallel and anti-parallel alignment of the magnetizations]]

The relative resistance change—or effect amplitude—is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{TMR} := \frac{R_{\mathrm{ap}}-R_{\mathrm{p}}}{R_{\mathrm{p}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{ap}&lt;/math&gt; is the electrical resistance in the anti-parallel state, whereas &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the resistance in the parallel state.

The TMR effect was explained by Jullière with the [[spin polarization]]s of the ferromagnetic electrodes. The spin polarization ''P'' is calculated from the [[spin (physics)|spin]] dependent [[density of states]] (DOS) &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; at the [[Fermi energy]]:

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{\mathcal{D}_\uparrow(E_\mathrm{F}) - \mathcal{D}_\downarrow(E_\mathrm{F})}{\mathcal{D}_\uparrow(E_\mathrm{F}) + \mathcal{D}_\downarrow(E_\mathrm{F})}&lt;/math&gt;

The spin-up electrons are those with spin orientation parallel to the external magnetic field, whereas the spin-down electrons have anti-parallel alignment with the external field. The relative resistance change is now given by the spin polarizations of the two ferromagnets, ''P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'':

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{TMR} = \frac{2 P_1 P_2}{1 - P_1 P_2}&lt;/math&gt;

If no [[voltage]] is applied to the junction, electrons tunnel in both directions with equal rates. With a bias voltage ''U'', electrons tunnel preferentially to the positive electrode. With the assumption that spin is [[Conservation law (physics)|conserved]] during tunneling, the current can be described in a two-current model. The total current is split in two partial currents, one for the spin-up electrons and another for the spin-down electrons. These vary depending on the magnetic state of the junctions.

There are two possibilities to obtain a defined anti-parallel state. First, one can use ferromagnets with different [[coercivity|coercivities]] (by using different materials or different film thicknesses). And second, one of the ferromagnets can be coupled with an [[antiferromagnet]] ([[exchange bias]]). In this case the magnetization of the uncoupled electrode remains "free".

The TMR becomes infinite if ''P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' equal 1, i.e. if both electrodes have 100% spin polarization. In this case the magnetic tunnel junction becomes a switch, that switches magnetically between low resistance and infinite resistance. Materials that come into consideration for this are called ''ferromagnetic half-metals''. Their conduction electrons are fully spin-polarized. This property is theoretically predicted for a number of materials (e.g. CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, various [[Heusler alloy]]s) but its experimental confirmation has been the subject of subtle debate. Nevertheless, if one considers only those electrons that enter into transport, measurements by Bowen et al. of up to 99.6%&lt;ref name=BowenJPCM2005&gt;

The TMR decreases with both increasing temperature and increasing bias voltage. Both can be understood in principle by [[magnon]] excitations and interactions with magnons, as well as due to tunnelling with respect to localized states induced by oxygen vacancies (see Symmetry Filtering section hereafter).&lt;ref name=SchleicherNC2014 /&gt;

==Symmetry-filtering in Tunnel Barriers==
Prior to the introduction of epitaxial [[magnesium oxide]] (MgO), amorphous aluminum oxide was used as the tunnel barrier of the MTJ, and typical room temperature TMR was in the range of tens of percent. MgO barriers increased TMR to hundreds of percent. This large increase reflects a synergetic combination of electrode and barrier electronic structures, which in turn reflects the achievement of structurally ordered junctions. Indeed, MgO filters the tunneling transmission of electrons with a particular symmetry that are fully spin-polarized within the current flowing across [[Cubic crystal system|body-centered cubic]] Fe-based electrodes. Thus, in the MTJ's parallel (P) state of electrode magnetization, electrons of this symmetry dominate the junction current. In contrast, in the MTJ's antiparallel (AP) state, this channel is blocked, such that electrons with the next most favorable symmetry to transmit dominate the junction current. Since those electrons tunnel with respect to a larger barrier height, this results in the sizeable TMR.

Beyond these large values of TMR across MgO-based MTJs,&lt;ref name=IkedaAPL2008 /&gt; this impact of the barrier's electronic structure on tunnelling spintronics has been indirectly confirmed by engineering the junction's potential landscape for electrons of a given symmetry. This was first achieved by examining how the electrons of a LSMO [[half-metal]]lic electrode with both full spin (P=+1 &lt;ref name=BowenJPCM2005 /&gt;) and symmetry polarization tunnel across an electrically biased SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; tunnel barrier.&lt;ref name=BowenPRB2006&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; that the electronic retention on the ground and excited states of an oxygen vacancy, which is temperature-dependent, determines the tunnelling barrier height for electrons of a given symmetry, and thus crafts the effective TMR ratio and its temperature dependence. This low barrier height in turn enables the high current densities required for spin-transfer torque, discussed hereafter.

==Spin-transfer torque in Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs)==
The effect of [[spin-transfer torque]] (STT) has been studied and applied widely in MTJs, where there is a tunnelling barrier sandwiched between a set of two ferromagnetic electrodes such that there is (free) magnetization of the right electrode, while assuming that the left electrode (with fixed magnetization) acts as spin-polarizer. This may then be pinned to some selecting transistor in an MRAM device, or connected to a preamplifier in an HDD application.

The STT vector, driven by the linear response voltage, can be computed from the expectation value of the torque operator:

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} = \mathrm{Tr}[\hat{\mathbf{T}} \hat{\rho}_\mathrm{neq}] &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \hat{\rho}_\mathrm{neq} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gauge theory|gauge-invariant]] nonequilibrium [[density matrix]] for the steady-state transport, in the zero-temperature limit, in the linear-response regime,&lt;ref&gt;[F. Mahfouzi, N. Nagaosa, and B. K. Nikolić, ''Spin-orbit coupling induced spin-transfer torque and current  polarization in topological-insulator/ferromagnet vertical heterostructures'',  Phys. Rev. Lett. '''109''', 166602 (2012).  Eq. (13)]&lt;/ref&gt; and the torque operator &lt;math&gt; \hat{\mathbf{T}} &lt;/math&gt; is obtained from the time derivative of the spin operator:

&lt;math&gt;
\hat{\mathbf{T}} = \frac{d\hat{\mathbf{S}}}{dt}= -\frac{i}{\hbar}\left[\frac{\hbar}{2}\boldsymbol{\sigma},\hat{H}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the general form of a 1D tight-binding Hamiltonian:

&lt;math&gt; \hat{H}=\hat{H}_0 - \Delta (\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{m})/2 &lt;/math&gt;

where total magnetization (as macrospin) is along the unit vector &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{m}&lt;/math&gt; and the Pauli matrices properties involving  arbitrary classical vectors &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p},\mathbf{q} &lt;/math&gt;, given by

&lt;math&gt; (\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{p})(\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{q}) = \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{q} + i(\mathbf{p}\times\mathbf{q})\cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}  &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; (\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{p}) \boldsymbol{\sigma} = \mathbf{p} + i \boldsymbol{\sigma} \times \mathbf{p} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;  \boldsymbol{\sigma}  (\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{q}) = \mathbf{q} + i \mathbf{q} \times  \boldsymbol{\sigma} &lt;/math&gt;

it is then possible to first obtain an analytical expression for &lt;math&gt; \hat{\mathbf{T}} &lt;/math&gt; (which can be expressed in compact form using  &lt;math&gt; \Delta, \mathbf{m} &lt;/math&gt;, and the vector of Pauli spin matrices &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\sigma}=(\sigma_x,\sigma_y,\sigma_z) &lt;/math&gt;).

The STT vector in general MTJs has two components: a parallel and perpendicular component:

A parallel component:
&lt;math&gt; T_{\parallel}=\sqrt{T_x^2+T_z^2} &lt;/math&gt;

And a perpendicular component:
&lt;math&gt; T_{\perp}=T_y &lt;/math&gt;

In symmetric MTJs (made of electrodes with the same geometry and exchange splitting), the STT vector has only one active component, as the perpendicular component disappears:

&lt;math&gt; T_{\perp} \equiv 0 &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[S.-C. Oh ''et. al.'', ''Bias-voltage dependence of perpendicular spin-transfer torque in a symmetric MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions'', Nature Phys. '''5''', 898 (2009). [http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v5/n12/abs/nphys1427.html &amp;#91;PDF&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, only &lt;math&gt; T_{\parallel} &lt;/math&gt; vs. &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; needs to be plotted at the site of the right electrode to characterise tunnelling in symmetric MTJs, making them appealing for production and characterisation at an industrial scale.

Note: 
In these calculations the active region (for which it is necessary to calculate the retarded [[Green's function (many-body theory)|Green's function]]) should consist of the tunnel barrier + the right ferromagnetic layer of finite thickness (as in realistic devices). The active region is attached to the left ferromagnetic electrode (modeled as semi-infinite tight-binding chain with non-zero [[Zeeman effect|Zeeman splitting]]) and the right N electrode (semi-infinite tight-binding chain without any Zeeman splitting), as encoded by the corresponding self-energy terms.

Recently, using new STEM techniques, the grain boundaries within FeCoB/MgO/FeCoB MTJs have been atomically resolved. This has allowed first principles calculations in the formalism of DFT to be performed on structural units that are present in real films. Such calculations have shown that the band gap can be reduced by as much as 45%.&lt;ref&gt;Bean, J. J., Saito, M., Fukami, S., Sato, H., &amp; Ikeda, S. (2017).

'''Verdant Power''' is a maker and installer of [[tidal power]] and [[hydroelectric]] systems. Their primary device is an underwater turbine, similar to a three-bladed [[wind turbine]], that is designed to capture energy from tidal currents and (precipitation-driven) river currents. The company uses the trade term "kinetic hydropower" to distinguish their systems from those (tidal and hydroelectric) based on [[dam]] construction. The company's first project, the "RITE Project", is several turbines in [[New York City|New York City's]] [[East River]]. 

==Location==
Verdant's home base is situated between [[Manhattan]] and [[Queens]] on [[Roosevelt Island]] in the middle of the East River, a tidal [[strait]] running from [[Long Island Sound]] to [[Upper New York Bay]].&lt;ref name=CBS20130807&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/powering-the-future-underwater-turbines-harness-river-power/ Powering the Future Underwater turbines harness river power - CBS News] 7 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==RITE Project==
The Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy (RITE) Project, owned by Verdant Power, is the first tidal energy project to be issued a license from the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferc.gov/media/news-releases/2012/2012-1/01-23-12.asp FERC News Release FERC Issues First Pilot License for Tidal Power Project in New York]&lt;/ref&gt; The first of three phases of the project was prototype testing from 2002 until 2006 when the phase 2 demonstration began. The six full-scale tidal turbines installed in the river bed constituted the "world's first operation of a grid-connected tidal turbine array".&lt;ref&gt;[http://verdantpower.com/what-initiative/ The RITE Project - East River - New York, NY] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224004159/http://verdantpower.com/what-initiative/ |date=February 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They provided power for a [[Gristedes]] supermarket and the adjacent Motorgate parking garage on Roosevelt Island.&lt;ref name=nytimes20120912&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/nyregion/in-quest-for-east-rivers-power-a-search-for-stouter-arms.html?_r=2&amp;ref=todayspaper&amp; In Quest for East River’s Power, a Search for Stouter Arms - NYTimes_com] by Patrick McGeehan 11 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012 the federal government announced an agreement with Verdant Power to install 30 tidal turbines in the channel, then projected to begin operations in 2015 and produce 1.05 MW of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turbines Off NYC East River Will Create Enough Energy to Power 9,500 Homes|url=http://energy.gov/articles/turbines-nyc-east-river-will-create-enough-energy-power-9500-homes|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were problems with turbine blade degradation. A September 2012 test of a newly designed 16-feet diameter turbine was a success, and the company estimated it will take about 5 years to complete the array of 30 turbines in the river.&lt;ref name=nytimes20120912 /&gt; In August 2013, CBS News reported that Verdant planned to put "two more turbines in the river over the next year or two and build up from there".&lt;ref name=CBS20130807 /&gt;

'''Virtual Labs''' is a project initiated by the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development]], [[Government of India]], under the National Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Document of National Mission on Education Through ICT|url=http://www.iitg.ac.in/cet/MissionDocument_20Feb09.pdf|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The project aims to provide remote-access to Laboratories  in various disciplines of science and engineering for students at all levels from under-graduate to research.&lt;ref&gt;Callaghan, Harkin, Maguire (2007). "Paradigms in Remote Experimentation", ''International Journal of Online Engineering (iJOE)'', Vol 3, No 4 (2007)[http://online-journals.org/i-joe/article/view/468]&lt;/ref&gt;

It also intends to develop a complete Learning Management System where the students can avail the various tools for learning, including additional web-resources, video-lectures, animated demonstrations and self-evaluation. There is also a component wherein costly equipment and resources are shared, which are otherwise available to only a limited number of users due to constraints on time and [[geographical distance]]s.

Seven [[Indian Institute of Technology|IIT]]'s ([[IIT Delhi|Delhi]], [[IIT Bombay|Bombay]], [[IIT Kanpur|Kanpur]], [[IIT Kharagpur|Kharagpur]], [[IIT Madras|Madras]], [[IIT Roorkee|Roorkee]] and [[IIT Guwahati|Guwahati]]), [[IIIT Hyderabad]], 	[[Amrita University]], [[Dayalbagh Educational Institute|Dayalbagh University]], [[NIT Karnataka]], and [[College of Engineering, Pune]], are the institutions participating in the project.
	
The Project intends to cover physical sciences, chemical science and various branches of engineering like electronics and communications, computer science and engineering, electrical engineering, 	mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, 	biotechnology engineering and civil engineering.
