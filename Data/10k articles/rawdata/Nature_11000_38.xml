      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11803">{{short description|A hydroacoustic current meter used to measure water current velocities over a depth range using the Doppler effect}}
An '''acoustic Doppler current profiler''' ('''ADCP''') is a [[underwater acoustics|hydroacoustic]] [[current meter]] similar to a [[sonar]], used to measure [[water current]] [[velocity|velocities]] over a depth range using the [[Doppler effect]] of [[sound waves]] scattered back from particles within the water column. The term ADCP is a generic term for all acoustic current profilers, although the abbreviation originates from an instrument series introduced by [[Teledyne|RD Instruments]] in the 1980s.  The working frequencies range of ADCPs range from 38&amp;nbsp;[[kHz]] to several [[Megahertz]]. The device used in the air for wind speed profiling using sound is known as [[SODAR]] and works with the same underlying principles.

== Working principle ==
[[File:Z-cell.png|thumb|ADCPs with three beams resolve the three components of velocity.  (Models Aquadopp Profiler 1MHz and 0.6 MHz, Nortek)]]
[[File:Adcp 600.jpg|thumb|Head of an ADCP with four transducers (Model WH-600, RD Instruments)]]
ADCPs contain [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] transducers to transmit and receive sound signals. The traveling time of sound waves gives an estimate of the distance. The frequency shift of the echo is proportional to the water velocity along the acoustic path. To measure 3D velocities, at least three beams are required.  In rivers, only the 2D velocity is relevant and ADCPs typically have two beams.  In recent years, more functionality has been added to ADCPs (notably wave and turbulence measurements) and systems can be found with 2,3,4,5 or even 9 beams.

Further components of an ADCP are an [[electronic amplifier]], a [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]], a clock to measure the traveling time, a [[temperature sensor]], a compass to know the heading, and a pitch/roll sensor to know the orientation. An [[analog-to-digital converter]] and a [[digital signal processor]] are required to sample the returning signal in order to determine the [[Doppler shift]]. A [[micro processor|temperature]] sensor is used to estimate the [[sound velocity]] at the instrument position using the [[Speed of sound#Seawater|seawater equation of state]], and uses this to estimate scale the frequency shift to water velocities. This procedure assumes that the [[salinity]] has a preconfigured constant value. Finally, the results are saved to internal memory or output online to an external display software.

== Processing methods ==
Three common methods are used to calculate the Doppler shift and thus the water velocity along the acoustic beams. The first method uses a monochromatic transmit pulse and is referred to as "[[Coherence (physics)|incoherent]]" or "[[narrowband]]".  The method is robust and provides good quality mean current profiles but has limited space-time resolution.  When the transmit pulse consists of coded elements that are repeated, the method is referred to as "repeat sequence coding"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0426%281992%29009%3C0149%3ARSCFIP%3E2.0.CO%3B2|title=Repeat-Sequence Coding for Improved Precision of Doppler Sonar and Sodar, R. Pinkel and J. A. Smith|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "broadband".  This method improves the space-time resolution by a factor of 5 (typical).  Commercially, this method was protected by US patent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US5615173|title=Acoustic doppler current profiler, US Patent 5615173|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5615173 until 2011.  The pulse-to-pulse coherent method&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0426%281984%29001%3C0293%3APTPCDS%3E2.0.CO%3B2|title=Pulse-to-Pulse Coherent Doppler Sonar Signal Processing Techniques, Roger Lhermitte|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; relies on a sequence of transmit pulses where the echo from subsequent pulses are assumed not to interfere with each other.  This method is only applicable for very short profiling ranges but the corresponding improvement in space time resolution is of order 1000.

== Applications ==
Depending on the mounting, one can distinguish between side-looking, downward- and upward-looking ADCPs. A bottom-mounted ADCP can measure the speed and direction of currents at equal intervals all the way to the surface. Mounted sideways on a wall or bridge piling in rivers or canals, it can measure the current profile from bank to bank. In very deep water they can be lowered on cables from the surface.

The primary usage is for [[oceanography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A6ew-bJDIDIC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=Acoustic+Doppler+Current+Profiler+book&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PwSf29Bbuo&amp;sig=LxTDjtmzKFVCgF8ZT0kwme964TU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WLtOTcSPFcP98Aaez9GCDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Acoustic%20Doppler%20Current%20Profiler%20book&amp;f=false|title=Data analysis methods in physical oceanography|page=83|author=William J. Emery, Richard E. Thomson|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|year=2001|accessdate=2011-02-06|ISBN=978-0-444-50757-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instruments can also be used in [[river]]s and [[canal]]s to continuously measure the [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]].

Mounted on [[mooring (oceanography)|mooring]]s within the water column or directly at the seabed, water current and wave studies may be performed. They can stay underwater for years at a time, the limiting factor is the lifetime of the battery pack. Depending on the nature of the deployment the instrument usually has the ability to be powered from shore, using the same [[umbilical cable]] for data communication. Deployment duration can be extended by a factor of three by substituting [[High capacity oceanographic lithium battery pack|lithium battery packs]] for the standard alkaline packs.

=== Bottom tracking ===
By adjusting the window where the Doppler shift is calculated, it is possible to measure the relative velocity between the instrument and the bottom. This feature is referred to as bottom-track. The process has two parts; first identify the position of the bottom from the acoustic echo, then calculating the velocity from a window centered around the bottom position.  When an ADCP is mounted on a moving ship, the bottom track velocity may be subtracted from the measured water velocity.  The result is the net current profile. Bottom track provides the foundation for surveys of the water currents in coastal areas.  In deep water where the acoustic signals cannot reach the bottom, the ship velocity is estimated from a more complex combination of velocity and heading information from [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[Gyroscope|gyro]], etc.

=== Discharge measurements ===
In rivers, the ADCP is used to measure the total water transport.  The method requires a vessel with an ADCP mounted over the side to cross from one bank to another while measuring continuously. Using the bottom track feature, the track of the boat as well as the cross sectional area is estimated after adjustment for left and right bank areas. The discharge can then be calculated as the dot product between the vector track and the current velocity.  The method is in use by hydrographic survey organisations across the world and forms an important component in the stage-discharge curves used in many places to continuously monitor river discharge.

=== DVL ===
For underwater vehicles, the bottom tracking feature can be used as an important component in the navigation systems.  In this case the velocity of the vehicle is combined with an initial [[Position fixing|position fix]], compass or gyro [[Course (navigation)|heading]], and data from the [[acceleration sensor]].  The sensor suite is combined (typically by use of a [[Kalman filter]]) to estimate the position of the vehicle. This may help to navigate submarines, [[autonomous underwater vehicle|autonomous]], and [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s.
[[File:Bo-awac+frame91.jpg|thumb|The AWAC (Acoustic Wave and Currents) is a type of ADCP specifically designed for surface wave height and direction.]]

=== Wave measurements ===
Some ADCPs can be configured to measure surface [[wave height]] and direction. The wave height is estimated with a vertical beam that measures the distance to the surface using the echo from short pulses and simple peak estimation algorithms.  The wave direction is found by cross correlating the along-beam velocity estimates and the wave height measurement from the vertical beam.  Wave measurements are typically available for seafloor-mounted instruments but recent improvements permit the instrument to be mounted also on rotating subsurface buoys.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US20070019505|title=System and method for determining directional and non-directional fluid wave and current|publisher=US Patent office}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turbulence ===
ADCPs with pulse-to-pulse coherent processing can estimate the velocity with the precision required to resolve small scale motion. As a consequence, it is possible to estimate [[Turbulence|turbulent]] parameters from properly configured ADCPs.  A typical approach is to fit the along beam velocity to the [[Kolmogorov structure function|Kolmogorov structure configuration]] and thereby estimate the dissipation rate.  The application of ADCPs to turbulence measurement is possible from stationary deployments but can also be done from moving underwater structures like gliders or from subsurface [[buoy]]s.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The two major advantages of ADCPs is the absence of moving parts that are subject to [[biofouling]] and the [[remote sensing]] aspect, where a single, stationary instrument can measure the current profile over ranges exceeding 1000 m. This features allow for long term measurements of the [[ocean current]]s over a significant portion of the water column.  Since the start in the mid-1980s, many thousand ADCPs have been used in the world oceans and the instrument has played a significant role in our understanding of the world [[Ocean current|ocean circulation]].

The main disadvantage of the ADCPs is the loss of data close to the boundary.  This mechanism, often referred to as a [[Side lobe|sidelobe]] interference, covers 6–12% of the water column and, for instruments looking up toward the surface, the loss of velocity information close to the surface is real disadvantage.  Cost is also a concern but is normally dwarfed by the cost of the ship required to ensure a safe and professional deployment.

As any acoustical instrument, the ADCP contributes to [[noise pollution]] in the ocean which may interfere with [[cetacean]] navigation and echolocation.&lt;ref name=EncylopediaOfEarth&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogan|first=C Michael|title=Icon Encyclopedia of Earth Topics|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Acoustic_Doppler_Current_Profiler?topic=49501|publisher=Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment|accessdate=2012-09-13|location=Washington, D.C.|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The effect depends on the frequency and the power of the instrument but most ADCPs operate in a frequency range where noise pollution has not been identified to be a serious problem.

[[File:Four statuettes of Mesopotamian gods.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|Four copper-alloy [[foundation figures]] dating to {{circa|2130}} BC, depicting four ancient Mesopotamian gods,{{sfn|Amin|2014}} wearing characteristic horned crowns{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=98}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=185}}]]

The '''Anunnaki''' (also transcribed as '''Anunaki''', '''Anunna''', '''Ananaki''', and other variations) are a group of [[deity|deities]] that appear in the mythological traditions of the ancient [[Sumerian religion|Sumerians]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]], [[Assyria]]ns, and [[Babylonian religion|Babylonians]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} Descriptions of how many Anunnaki there were and what role they fulfilled are inconsistent and often contradictory. In the earliest Sumerian writings about them, which come from the Post-Akkadian period, the Anunnaki are the most powerful deities in the pantheon, descendants of [[Anu|An]], the god of the heavens, and their primary function is to [[Time and fate deities|decree the fates of humanity]].

In ''[[Inanna#Descent into the Underworld|Inanna's Descent into the Netherworld]]'', the Anunnaki are portrayed as seven judges who sit before the throne of [[Ereshkigal]] in the [[Ancient Mesopotamian Underworld|Underworld]]. Later Akkadian texts, such as ''[[The Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', follow this portrayal. During the Old Babylonian period, the Anunnaki were believed to be the [[chthonic]] deities of the Underworld, while the gods of the heavens were known as the [[Igigi]]. The ancient [[Hittites]] identified the Anunnaki as the oldest generation of gods, who had been overthrown and banished to the Underworld by the younger gods. The Anunnaki have featured prominently in works of modern [[pseudohistory]], such as the books of [[Zecharia Sitchin]], and in [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], such as those of [[David Icke]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Mesopotamian - Cylinder Seal - Walters 42564 - Impression.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]ian [[cylinder seal]] impression depicting a [[vegetation goddess]], possibly [[Ninhursag]], sitting on a throne surrounded by worshippers ({{circa|2350–2150}} BC)]]

The name ''Anunnaki'' is derived from [[Anu|An]],{{sfn|Leemings|2009|page=21}} the Sumerian god of the sky.{{sfn|Leemings|2009|page=21}} The name is variously written "&lt;sup&gt;''[[determinative|d]]''&lt;/sup&gt;a-nuna", "&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;a-nuna-ke&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-ne", or "&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;a-nun-na", meaning "princely offspring" or "offspring of An".{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}}

The Anunnaki were believed to be the offspring of An and his consort, the earth goddess [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} [[Samuel Noah Kramer]] identifies Ki with the Sumerian mother goddess [[Ninhursag]], stating that they were originally the same figure.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=41}}{{sfn|Kramer|1963|page=122}} The oldest of the Anunnaki was [[Enlil]], the god of air{{sfn|Coleman|Davidson|2015|page=108}} and chief god of the Sumerian pantheon.{{sfn|Kramer|1983|pages=115–121}} The Sumerians believed that, until Enlil was born, heaven and earth were inseparable.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=72–73}} Then, Enlil cleaved heaven and earth in two{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=72–73}} and carried away the earth{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=72–75}} while his father An carried away the sky.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=72–75}}

==Worship and iconography==
The Anunnaki are chiefly mentioned in literary texts{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}} and very little evidence to support the existence of any cult of them has yet been unearthed.{{sfn|Falkenstein|1965|pages=127–140}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}} This is likely due to the fact that each member of the Anunnaki had his or her own individual cult, separate from the others.{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} Similarly, no representations of the Anunnaki as a group have yet been discovered,{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} although a few depictions of its individual members have been identified.{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} Deities in ancient Mesopotamia were almost exclusively [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=93}} They were thought to possess extraordinary powers{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=93}} and were often envisioned as being of tremendous physical size.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=93}} The deities typically wore ''melam'', an ambiguous substance which "covered them in terrifying splendor".{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=93–94}} ''Melam'' could also be worn by heroes, kings, giants, and even demons.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=130–131}} The effect that seeing a deity's ''melam'' has on a human is described as ''ni'', a word for the [[Paresthesia|physical tingling of the flesh]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=130}} Deities were almost always depicted wearing horned caps,{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=98}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=185}} consisting of up to seven superimposed pairs of ox-horns.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=102}} They were also sometimes depicted wearing clothes with elaborate decorative gold and silver ornaments sewn into them.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=185}}

The ancient Mesopotamians believed that their deities lived in [[Heaven]],{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=94}} but that a god's statue was a physical embodiment of the god himself.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=94}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=186}} As such, [[Cult image|cult statues]] were given constant care and attention{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|pages=186–187}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=94}} and a set of priests were assigned to tend to them.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|pages=186–188}} These priests would clothe the statues{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=186}} and place feasts before them so they could "eat".{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|pages=186–187}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=94}} A deity's [[Temple#Mesopotamian temples|temple]] was believed to be that deity's literal place of residence.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=174}} The gods had boats, full-sized [[barge]]s which were normally stored inside their temples{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=44–45}} and were used to transport their cult statues along waterways during various [[religious festival]]s.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=44–45}} The gods also had [[Chariot#Ancient Near East|chariots]], which were used for transporting their cult statues by land.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=52}} Sometimes a deity's cult statue would be transported to the location of a battle so that the deity could watch the battle unfold.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=52}} The major deities of the Mesopotamian pantheon, which included the Anunnaki, were believed to participate in the "assembly of the gods",{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=98}} through which the gods made all of their decisions.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=98}} This assembly was seen as a divine counterpart to the [[History of democracy#Mesopotamia|semi-democratic legislative system]] that existed during the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] ({{circa}} 2112 BC — {{circa}} 2004 BC).{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=98}}

==Mythology==
===Sumerian===
[[File:Ea (Babilonian) - EnKi (Sumerian).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Akkadian cylinder seal dating to {{circa|2300}} BC depicting the deities Inanna, Utu, and Enki, three members of the Anunnaki{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=32–33}}]]

The earliest known usages of the term ''Anunnaki'' come from inscriptions written during the reign of [[Gudea]] ({{circa}} 2144 — 2124 BC) and the Third Dynasty of Ur.{{sfn|Brisch|2016}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}} In the earliest texts, the term is applied to the most powerful and important deities in the Sumerian pantheon: the descendants of the sky-god An.{{sfn|Katz|2003|page=403}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}} This group of deities probably included the "seven gods who decree":{{sfn|Kramer|1963|page=123}} An, Enlil, [[Enki]], [[Ninhursag]], [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]], [[Utu]], and [[Inanna]].{{sfn|Kramer|1963|pages=122–123}}

Although certain deities are described as members of the Anunnaki, no complete list of the names of all the Anunnaki has survived{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} and they are usually only referred to as a cohesive group in literary texts.{{sfn|Brisch|2016}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}} Furthermore, Sumerian texts describe the Anunnaki inconsistently{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} and do not agree on how many Anunnaki there were, or what their divine function was.{{sfn|Brisch|2016}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}} Originally, the Anunnaki appear to have been heavenly deities with immense powers.{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} In the poem ''Enki and the World Order'', the Anunnaki "do homage" to Enki, sing hymns of praise in his honor, and "take up their dwellings" among the people of Sumer.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Kramer|1963|page=180}} The same composition repeatedly states that the Anunnaki "decree the fates of mankind".{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}

Virtually every major deity in the Sumerian pantheon was regarded as the patron of a specific city{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=179}} and was expected to protect that city's interests.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=179}} The deity was believed to permanently reside within that city's temple.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=187-189}} One text mentions as many as fifty Anunnaki associated with the city of [[Eridu]].{{sfn|Edzard|1965|pages=17–140}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} In ''[[Inanna#Descent into the Underworld|Inanna's Descent into the Netherworld]]'', there are only seven Anunnaki, who reside within the [[Kur|Underworld]] and serve as judges.{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=60}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}} [[Inanna]] stands trial before them for her attempt to take over the Underworld;{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=60}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}} they deem her guilty of [[hubris]] and condemn her to death.{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=60}}

Major deities in Sumerian mythology were associated with specific celestial bodies.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|pages=201–203}} Inanna was believed to be the planet [[Venus]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=108–109}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=203}} Utu was believed to be the sun.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=182–184}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=203}} Nanna was the moon.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=135}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=203}} An was identified with all the stars of the [[Celestial equator|equatorial sky]], Enlil with those of the [[Northern celestial hemisphere|northern sky]], and Enki with those of the [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere|southern sky]].{{sfn|Rogers|1998|page=13}} The path of Enlil's celestial orbit was a continuous, symmetrical circle around the [[Celestial pole|north celestial pole]],{{sfn|Levenda|2008|page=29}} but those of An and Enki were believed to intersect at various points.{{sfn|Levenda|2008|pages=29–30}}

===Akkadian, Babylonian, and Assyrian===
{{rquote|right|Reverence begets favour, sacrifice prolongs life, and prayer atones for guilt. He who fears the gods is not slighted by .[...] He who fears the Anunnaki extends [his days].|Babylonian hymn{{sfn|Leick|2003|page=100}}}}
[[File:Marduk and pet.jpg|thumb|Babylonian representation of the [[national god]] [[Marduk]],{{sfn|Willis|2012|page=62}} who the Babylonians and Assyrians envisioned as a prominent member of the Anunnaki{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}}{{sfn|Oshima|2010|pages=145–146}}]]

Akkadian texts of the second millennium BC follow similar portrayals of the Anunnaki from ''Inanna's Descent into the Netherworld'', depicting them as [[chthonic]] Underworld deities. In [[Inanna#Akkadian version|an abbreviated Akkadian version of ''Inanna's Descent'']] written in the early second millennium, [[Ereshkigal]], the queen of the Underworld, comments that she "drink[s] water with the Anunnaki".{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=156}} Later in the same poem, Ereshkigal orders her servant [[Namtar]] to fetch the Anunnaki from Egalgina,{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=159}} to "decorate the threshold steps with coral",{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=159}} and to "seat them on golden thrones".{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=159}}

During the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian Period]] ({{circa}} 1830 BC — c. 1531 BC), a new set of deities known as the [[Igigi]] are introduced.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=106}} The relationship between the Anunnaki and the Igigi is unclear.{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} On some occasions, the categories appear to be used synonymously,{{sfn|Brisch|2016}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}} but in other writings, such as ''The Poem of Erra'', there is a clear distinction between the two.{{sfn|Brisch|2016}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}} In the late Akkadian ''[[Atra-Hasis]]'' epic, the Igigi are the sixth generation of the gods who are forced to perform labor for the Anunnaki.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=85}}{{sfn|Leick|2003|page=96}} After forty days, the Igigi rebel and the god [[Enki]], one of the Anunnaki, creates humans to replace them.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=85}}{{sfn|Leick|2003|page=96}}

From the [[Kassites|Middle Babylonian Period]] ({{circa}} 1592 — 1155 BC) onward, the name ''Anunnaki'' was applied generally to the deities of the underworld;{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} whereas the name ''Igigi'' was applied to the heavenly deities.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} During this period, the underworld deities [[Damkina]], [[Nergal]], and Madānu are listed as the most powerful among the Anunnaki,{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} alongside [[Marduk]], the [[national god]] of ancient Babylon.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}}

In the standard Akkadian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' ({{circa}} 1200 BC) [[Utnapishtim]], the immortal survivor of the [[Flood myth|Great Flood]], describes the Anunnaki as seven judges of the Underworld, who set the land aflame as the storm approaches.{{sfn|Dalley|1989|pages=112}} Later, when the flood comes, [[Ishtar]] (the [[East Semitic]] equivalent to Inanna) and the Anunnaki mourn over the destruction of humanity.{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=113}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}

In the Babylonian ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'', Marduk assigns the Anunnaki their positions.{{sfn|Pritchard|2010|pages=33–34}} A late Babylonian version of the epic mentions 600 Anunnaki of the underworld,{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} but only 300 Anunnaki of heaven,{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} indicating the existence of a complex underworld [[cosmology]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} In gratitude, the Anunnaki, the "Great Gods", build [[Esagila]], a "splendid" temple dedicated to Marduk, Ea, and Ellil.{{sfn|Pritchard|2010|page=34-35}} In the eighth-century BC ''Poem of Erra'', the Anunnaki are described as the brothers of the god Nergal{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}} and are depicted as antagonistic towards humanity.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}

A badly damaged text from the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian Period]] (911 — 612 BC) describes Marduk leading his army of Anunnaki into the sacred city of [[Nippur]] and causing a disturbance.{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=145}} The disturbance causes a flood,{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=145}} which forces the resident gods of Nippur to take shelter in the Eshumesha temple to [[Ninurta]].{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=145}} Enlil is enraged at Marduk's transgression and orders the gods of Eshumesha to take Marduk and the other Anunnaki as prisoners.{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=145}} The Anunnaki are captured,{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=145}} but Marduk appoints his front-runner Mushteshirhablim to lead a revolt against the gods of Eshumesha{{sfn|Oshima|2010|pages=145–146}} and sends his messenger Neretagmil to alert [[Nabu]], the god of literacy.{{sfn|Oshima|2010|pages=145–146}} When the Eshumesha gods hear Nabu speak, they come out of their temple to search for him.{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=146}} Marduk defeats the Eshumesha gods and takes 360 of them as prisoners of war, including Enlil himself.{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=146}} Enlil protests that the Eshumesha gods are innocent,{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=146}} so Marduk puts them on trial before the Anunnaki.{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=146}} The text ends with a warning from Damkianna (another name for Ninhursag) to the gods and to humanity, pleading them not to repeat the war between the Anunnaki and the gods of Eshumesha.{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=146}}

===Hurrian and Hittite===
[[File:Yazilikaya B 12erGruppe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Ancient Hittite relief carving from [[Yazılıkaya]], a sanctuary at [[Hattusa]], depicting twelve gods of the underworld,{{sfn|Collins|2002|page=228}} whom the Hittites identified as the Mesopotamian Anunnaki{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=141}}{{sfn|Collins|2002|page=225}}]]

In the mythologies of the [[Hurrian religion|Hurrians]] and [[Hittite mythology|Hittites]] (which flourished in the mid to late second millennium BC), the oldest generation of gods was believed to have been banished by the younger gods to the Underworld,{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=141}}{{sfn|Van Scott|1998|page=187}} where they were ruled by the goddess [[Lelwani]].{{sfn|Van Scott|1998|page=187}} Hittite scribes identified these deities with the Anunnaki.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=141}}{{sfn|Collins|2002|page=225}} In [[Hurrian language|ancient Hurrian]], the Anunnaki are referred to as ''karuileš šiuneš'', which means "former ancient gods",{{sfn|Archi|1990|page=114}} or ''kattereš šiuneš'', which means "gods of the earth".{{sfn|Archi|1990|page=114}} Hittite and Hurrian treaties were often sworn by the old gods in order to ensure that the oaths would be kept.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=141}}{{sfn|Archi|1990|page=114}} In one myth, the gods are threatened by the stone giant [[Ullikummi]],{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=25–26}} so Ea (the later name for Enki) commands the Former Gods to find the weapon that was used to separate the heavens from the earth.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=141}}{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=26}} They find it and use it to cut off Ullikummi's feet.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=26}}

Although the names of the Anunnaki in Hurrian and Hittite texts frequently vary,{{sfn|Collins|2002|page=225}} they are always eight in number.{{sfn|Collins|2002|page=225}} In one Hittite ritual, the names of the old gods are listed as: "Aduntarri the diviner, Zulki the dream interpress, Irpitia Lord of the Earth, Narā, Namšarā, Minki, Amunki, and Āpi."{{sfn|Collins|2002|page=225}} The old gods had no identifiable cult in the Hurrio-Hittite religion;{{sfn|Collins|2002|page=225}} instead, the Hurrians and Hittites [[divination|sought to communicate with the old gods]] through the [[ritual sacrifice]] of a piglet in a pit dug in the ground.{{sfn|Collins|2002|pages=225–226}} The old gods were often invoked to perform [[ritual purification]]s.{{sfn|Collins|2002|pages=226–227}}

The Hittite account of the old gods' banishment to the Underworld ultimately became the source for the Greek poet [[Hesiod]]'s narrative of the overthrow of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] by the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]] in his ''[[Theogony]]''.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=26–27}} The Greek sky-god [[Uranus (mythology)|Ouranos]] (whose name means "Heaven") is the father of the Titans{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=27–29}} and is derived from the Hittite version of Anu.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=29–30}} In Hesiod's account, Ouranos is castrated by his son [[Cronus|Kronos]],{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=27–30}} just as Anu was castrated by his son [[Kumarbi]] in the Hittite story.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=25–26, 29–30}}

[[File:ZECHARIA SITCHIN.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pseudohistory|Pseudohistorian]] [[Zecharia Sitchin]] posing with an enlarged photograph of a Sumerian cylinder seal impression]]
{{main|Zecharia Sitchin}}
In his 1976 book ''The Twelfth Planet'', Russian-American author [[Zecharia Sitchin]] claimed that the Anunnaki were actually a race of [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial beings]] from the undiscovered planet [[Nibiru cataclysm|Nibiru]], who came to Earth around 500,000 years ago in order to mine gold.{{sfn|Fritze|2016|page=292}}{{sfn|Fritze|2009|page=212}}{{sfn|Robertson|2016}} According to Sitchin, the Anunnaki [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] ''[[homo erectus]]'' to create modern humans to work as their slaves.{{sfn|Fritze|2016|page=292}}{{sfn|Fritze|2009|page=212}}{{sfn|Robertson|2016}} Sitchin claimed that the Anunnaki were forced to leave Earth when Antarctic glaciers melted, causing the [[Genesis flood narrative|Flood of Noah]],{{sfn|Fritze|2009|pages=212–213}} which also destroyed the Anunnaki's bases on Earth.{{sfn|Fritze|2009|pages=212–213}} These had to be rebuilt and the [[Nephilim]], needing more humans to help in this massive effort, taught them agriculture.{{sfn|Fritze|2009|pages=212–213}} [[Ronald H. Fritze]] writes that, according to Sitchin, "the Annunaki built the pyramids and all the other monumental structures from around the world that ancient astronaut theorists consider so impossible to build without highly advanced technologies."{{sfn|Fritze|2016|page=292}} Sitchin also claimed that the Anunnaki had left behind human-alien hybrids, some of whom may still be alive today, unaware of their alien ancestry.{{sfn|Fritze|2009|page=212}}{{sfn|Robertson|2016}} Sitchin expanded on this mythology in later works, including ''The Stairway to Heaven'' (1980) and ''The Wars of Gods and Men'' (1985).{{sfn|Fritze|2009|page=213}} In ''The End of Days: Armageddon and the Prophecy of the Return'' (2007), Sitchin predicted that the Anunnaki would return to earth, [[2012 phenomenon|possibly as soon as 2012]], corresponding to the end of the [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]].{{sfn|Fritze|2009|page=213}}{{sfn|Robertson|2016}}

Sitchin's writings have been universally rejected by mainstream historians, who have labelled his books as [[pseudohistory]],{{sfn|Fritze|2009|pages=213–214}} pointing out that Sitchin seemingly deliberately misrepresents Sumerian texts by quoting them out of context, truncating quotations, and mistranslating Sumerian words to give them radically different meanings from their accepted definitions.{{sfn|Fritze|2009|page=214}} Nonetheless, because Sitchin worked in the shadow of [[Erich von Däniken]]'s more widely publicized ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', he managed to escape the notice of debunkers,{{sfn|Fritze|2016|page=292}}{{sfn|Robertson|2016}} allowing his theories to become more influential.{{sfn|Robertson|2016}} Although Sitchin himself described the Anunnaki as [[Nordic aliens|humanoids]],{{sfn|Fritze|2009|page=212}} in a book published in 1994, the conspiracy theorist Arthur Horn proposed that they were actually [[Reptilian humanoid|reptilians]].{{sfn|Robertson|2016|page=94}} British conspiracy theorist [[David Icke]] further expanded on this thesis by claiming that the surviving alien bloodlines mentioned by Sitchin were the "Brotherhood of Babylon",{{sfn|Robertson|2016}} a race of shape-shifting, reptilian aliens who secretly control all the governments of the world and keep humans enslaved,{{sfn|Robertson|2016}} using the [[Illuminati]] as one of their figurative chess pieces.{{sfn|Robertson|2016}}

[[File:Map00323 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|Undersea topography of the Atlantis Massif highlighting the location of the [[Lost City Hydrothermal Field]]]]

The '''Atlantis Massif''' is a prominent undersea [[massif]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]]. It is a dome-shaped region approximately {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} across and rising about {{convert|14000|ft|m|0}} from the sea floor. It is located at approximately 30°8′N latitude 42°8′W longitude; just east of the intersection of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] with the Atlantis [[Transform fault|Transform Fault]]. The highest point of the massif is around {{convert|700|m|ft|0}} beneath the surface.

It is believed that the massif was formed underneath the nearby Mid-Atlantic Ridge, but pulled from underneath the ridge during the movement of the [[plate tectonics|plates]], about 1.5 to 2 million years ago. Geologic studies of the massif have indicated that it is not composed of the black [[basalt]] typical of the ocean floor, but rather of dense green [[peridotite]] usually found in the [[earth's mantle|mantle]]. The central dome is corrugated and striated in a way that is representative of an exposed [[ultramafic]] [[oceanic core complex]].

An expedition to the area in 1996 made an important advance in the study of the ocean floor. It found that a steeply sloping [[detachment fault]] is associated with the oceanic core complex structure. The dome was caused by mantle material being extruded to the surface. Another expedition discovered the [[Lost City (hydrothermal field)|Lost City hydrothermal field]] near the summit of the ridge in 2000.

Another expedition in 2016, the IODP 357 expedition, targeted this massif, drilling cores.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28038">[[File:Helium atom QM.svg|180px|thumb|right|Diagram of a helium atom, showing the electron probability density as shades of gray.]]The '''atomic radius''' of a [[chemical element]] is a measure of the size of its atoms, usually the mean or typical distance from the center of the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] to the boundary of the surrounding cloud of [[electron]]s.  Since the boundary is not a well-defined physical entity, there are various non-equivalent definitions of atomic radius. Three widely used definitions of atomic radius are:  [[Van der Waals radius]], [[ionic radius]], and [[covalent radius]].

Depending on the definition, the term may apply only to isolated atoms, or also to atoms in [[condensed matter]], [[covalent bonding|covalently bound]] in [[molecule]]s, or in [[ionization|ionized]] and [[excited state]]s; and its value may be obtained through experimental measurements, or computed from theoretical models. The value of the radius may depend on the atom's state and context.&lt;ref&gt;

Electrons do not have definite orbits, or sharply defined ranges. Rather, their positions must be described as [[probability distribution]]s that taper off gradually as one moves away from the nucleus, without a sharp cutoff.  Moreover, in condensed matter and molecules, the electron clouds of the atoms usually overlap to some extent, and some of the electrons may roam over a large region encompassing two or more atoms.

Under most definitions the radii of isolated neutral atoms range between 30 and 300 [[picometre|pm]] ([[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#10.E2.88.9212|trillionths]] of a meter), or between 0.3 and 3 [[ångström]]s. Therefore, the radius of an atom is more than 10,000 times the [[nuclear radius|radius of its nucleus]] (1–10 [[femtometre|fm]]),&lt;ref name=Basdevant&gt;

For many purposes, atoms can be modeled as spheres. This is only a crude approximation, but it can provide quantitative explanations and predictions for many phenomena, such as the [[density]] of liquids and solids, the diffusion of fluids through [[molecular sieves]], the arrangement of atoms and ions in [[crystal]]s, and the [[space-filling model|size and shape of molecules]].{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Atomic radii vary in a predictable and explicable manner across the [[periodic table]]. For instance, the radii generally decrease along each period (row) of the table, from the [[alkali metal]]s to the [[noble gases]]; and increase down each group (column).  The radius increases sharply between the noble gas at the end of each period and the alkali metal at the beginning of the next period.  These trends of the atomic radii (and of various other chemical and physical properties of the elements) can be explained by the [[electron shell]] theory of the atom; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]. The atomic radii decrease across the Periodic Table because as the atomic number increases, the number of protons increases across the period, but the extra electrons are only added to the same quantum shell. Therefore, the effective nuclear charge towards the outermost electrons increases, drawing the outermost electrons closer. As a result, the electron cloud contracts and the atomic radius decreases.

==History==

In 1920, shortly after it had become possible to determine the sizes of atoms using [[X-ray crystallography]], it was suggested that all atoms of the same element have the same radii.&lt;ref&gt;

 |doi=10.1080/14786440808636111
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in 1923, when more crystal data had become available, it was found that the approximation of an atom as a sphere does not necessarily hold when comparing the same atom in different crystal structures.&lt;ref&gt;

==Definitions==
&lt;!--{{atomic radius}}--&gt;
Widely used definitions of atomic radius include:

* [[Van der Waals radius]]: in principle, half the minimum distance between the nuclei of two atoms of the element that are not bound to the same molecule.&lt;ref name="Pauling1945"&gt;
{{cite book

 |title=The Nature of the Chemical Bond

 |lccn=42034474
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ionic radius]]: the nominal radius of the ions of an element in a specific ionization state, deduced from the spacing of atomic nuclei in crystalline salts that include that ion. In principle, the spacing between two adjacent oppositely charged ions (the [[bond length|length]] of the [[ionic bond]] between them) should equal the sum of their ionic radii.&lt;ref name="Pauling1945"/&gt;
* [[Covalent radius]]: the nominal radius of the atoms of an element when [[covalent bond|covalently bound]] to other atoms, as deduced from the separation between the atomic nuclei in molecules. In principle, the distance between two atoms that are bound to each other in a molecule (the length of that covalent bond) should equal the sum of their covalent radii.&lt;ref name="Pauling1945"/&gt;
* [[Metallic radius]]: the nominal radius of atoms of an element when joined to other atoms by [[metallic bond]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}
* [[Bohr radius]]: the radius of the lowest-energy electron orbit predicted by [[Bohr model]] of the atom (1913).&lt;ref name="bohrI"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is only applicable to atoms and ions with a single electron, such as [[hydrogen]], singly ionized [[helium]], and [[positronium]].  Although the model itself is now obsolete, the Bohr radius for the hydrogen atom is still regarded as an important physical constant.

==Explanation of the general trends==
[[File:Atomic number to radius graph.png|thumb|A graph comparing the atomic radius of elements with atomic numbers 1–100. Accuracy of ±5 pm.]]The way the atomic radius varies with increasing [[atomic number]] can be explained by the arrangement of electrons in shells of fixed capacity.  The shells are generally filled in order of increasing radius, since the negatively [[electric charge|charged]] electrons are attracted by the positively charged [[proton]]s in the nucleus.  As the atomic number increases along each row of the periodic table, the additional electrons go into the same outermost shell; whose radius gradually contracts, due to the increasing nuclear charge.  In a noble gas, the outermost shell is completely filled; therefore, the additional electron of next alkali metal will go into the next outer shell, accounting for the sudden increase in the atomic radius.

The increasing nuclear charge is partly counterbalanced by the increasing number of electrons, a phenomenon that is known as [[shielding effect|shielding]]; which explains why the size of atoms usually increases down each column. However, there is one notable exception, known as the [[lanthanide contraction]]: the 5d block of elements are much smaller than one would expect, due to the shielding caused by the 4f electrons.

Essentially, atomic radius decreases across the periods due to an increasing number of protons. Therefore, there is a greater attraction between the protons and electrons because opposite charges attract, and more protons creates a stronger charge. The greater attraction draws the electrons closer to the protons, decreasing the size of the particle. Therefore, atomic radius decreases. Down the groups, atomic radius increases. This is because there are more energy levels and therefore a greater distance between protons and electrons. In addition, electron shielding causes attraction to decrease, so remaining electrons can go farther away from the positively charged nucleus. Therefore, size (atomic radius) increases.

The following table summarizes the main phenomena that influence the atomic radius of an element:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! factor !! principle !! increase with...  !! ''tend to'' !! effect on radius
|-
| electron shells || quantum mechanics || principal and azimuthal quantum numbers || increase atomic radius || increases down each column
|-
| nuclear charge || attractive force acting on electrons by protons in nucleus || atomic number || decrease atomic radius || decreases along each period
|-
| shielding || repulsive force acting on outermost shell electrons by inner electrons || number of electrons in inner shells  || increase atomic radius || reduces the effect of the 2nd factor
|}

===Lanthanide contraction===
{{main|Lanthanide contraction}}
The electrons in the 4f-[[Electron shell|subshell]], which is progressively filled from [[cerium]] (''[[Atomic number|Z]]''&amp;nbsp;= 58) to [[lutetium]] (''Z''&amp;nbsp;= 71), are not particularly effective at shielding the increasing nuclear charge from the sub-shells further out. The elements immediately following the [[lanthanide]]s have atomic radii which are smaller than would be expected and which are almost identical to the atomic radii of the elements immediately above them.&lt;ref name="Jolly_contract"&gt;
{{cite book
 |last1=Jolly |first=W. L.
 |year=1991
 |title=Modern Inorganic Chemistry
 |page=22 |edition=2nd
 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]
 |isbn=978-0-07-112651-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence [[hafnium]] has virtually the same atomic radius (and chemistry) as [[zirconium]], and [[tantalum]] has an atomic radius similar to [[niobium]], and so forth.  The effect of the lanthanide contraction is noticeable up to [[platinum]] (''Z''&amp;nbsp;= 78), after which it is masked by a [[relativistic effect]] known as the [[inert pair effect]].

Due to lanthanide contraction, the 5 following observations can be drawn:

# The size of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions regularly decreases with atomic number. According to [[Fajans' rules]], decrease in size of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions increases the covalent character and decreases the basic character between Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and  OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions in Ln(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, to the point that Yb(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Lu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can dissolve with difficulty in hot concentrated NaOH. Hence the order of size of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is given: &lt;br /&gt; La&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; ..., ... &gt; Lu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;.
# There is a regular decrease in their ionic radii.
# There is a regular decrease in their tendency to act as a reducing agent, with increase in atomic number.
# The second and third rows of d-block transition elements are quite  close in properties.
# Consequently, these elements occur together in natural minerals and are difficult to separate.

===d-Block contraction===
{{main|d-block contraction}}
The d-block contraction is less pronounced than the lanthanide contraction but arises from a similar cause. In this case, it is the poor shielding capacity of the 3d-electrons which affects the atomic radii and chemistries of the elements immediately following the first row of the [[transition metal]]s, from [[gallium]] (''Z''&amp;nbsp;= 31) to [[bromine]] (''Z''&amp;nbsp;= 35).&lt;ref name="Jolly_contract"/&gt;

'''Bell Island''' is an island located off the [[Avalon Peninsula]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Canada]] in [[Conception Bay]]. Measuring {{convert|9.7|km}} in length and {{convert|3.5|km}} in width, it has an area of {{convert|34|km²|acre}}. The subsurface is composed of [[Ordovician]] [[sandstone]] and [[shale]] with red [[hematite]]. It was once the site of large iron ore mines.

It is home to three communities, the largest of which is the incorporated town of [[Wabana, Newfoundland and Labrador|Wabana]]. The provincial government operates a ferry service from [[Portugal Cove, Newfoundland and Labrador|Portugal Cove]] to Bell Island daily using either the {{MV|Flanders}} or the {{MV|Legionnaire}}.  It is primarily used by commuters who work in the [[St. John's metropolitan area]].

==History==
[[File:BellIslandPierCa1900.jpg|thumb|left|Bell Island iron ore pier, circa 1900]]
Probably settled by [[Maritime Archaic]] and/or [[Dorset culture|Dorset]] people, Bell Island, as with the rest of the island of Newfoundland, was probably inhabited by the [[Beothuk]] Nation at the time of European discovery.

The first European inhabitants settled during the 18th century and attempted to farm and fish, with the island having a subsistence economy throughout much of the 19th century. The first recorded settler was an Englishman, Gregory Normore, in 1740.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oickle|first=Vernon|title=Disasters of Atlantic Canada: Stories of Courage &amp; Chaos|year=2007|publisher=Lone Pine Publishing|isbn=978-1-894864-15-2|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economy expanded tremendously during the 1890s when [[iron ore]] mining began near the community of [[Wabana, Newfoundland and Labrador|Wabana]].

Wabana grew to become the island's largest community and the mine became one of the largest producers of iron ore in northeastern North America. The mine's workings extended beneath the seabed of Conception Bay, creating one of the most extensive submarine iron mines in the world.

Most of Bell Island's ore was shipped from loading facilities to [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]], [[Nova Scotia]] where it was [[smelter|smelted]] in a steel mill. The steel mill at Sydney and the iron mine at Bell Island were owned by the [[Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation|Dominion Steel and Coal Company]] (DOSCO), which at one point was one of the largest private employers in [[Canada]].

===World War II===
Two [[QF 4.7-inch Gun Mk I–IV|QF 4.7-inch B Mark IV*]] guns were emplaced on Bell Island early in World War II. They can still be seen on their mountings.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the anchorage for [[bulk carrier]]s shipping iron ore was attacked by [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[U-boat]]s in two attacks on 5 September and 2 November 1942, by [[German submarine U-513|''U-513'']] and [[German submarine U-518|''U-518'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/politics/bell-island-sinkings.php|title=Bell Island Sinkings|author=|date=|website=www.heritage.nf.ca|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026002909/http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/politics/bell-island-sinkings.php|archivedate=26 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seethesites.ca/designations/the-u-boat-attacks-on-the-bell-island-ore-ships-in-1942.aspx|title=The U-Boat Attacks on the Bell Island Ore Ships in 1942 - Provincial Historic Commemorations Program|author=|date=|website=www.seethesites.ca|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716022851/http://www.seethesites.ca/designations/the-u-boat-attacks-on-the-bell-island-ore-ships-in-1942.aspx|archivedate=16 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four ships were sunk and 70 [[Merchant Navy|merchant mariners]] lost their lives:
* SS ''Saganaga''
* SS ''Lord Strathcona''
* SS ''P.L.M 27''
* SS ''Rose Castle''

In addition to the four cargo ships, an errant German [[torpedo]] also struck the DOSCO iron ore loading dock on shore.  A memorial overlooks the waters at Lance Cove where the wrecks lie just a few hundred yards offshore.  Bell Island was one of the [[Attacks on North America during World War II#Newfoundland|very few]] locations in North America to see enemy action during the war, and the only location in [[North America]] to be subject to direct attack by German forces during World War II (due to the errant torpedo hitting land).

=== Closure of iron ore mine ===
Being an underground operation, the Bell Island iron ore mine was extremely expensive to operate.  During the 1950s, some of the largest surface iron ore deposits in the world were discovered in northeastern [[Quebec]] and the western part of [[Labrador]].  After the [[Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway]] was built in the latter part of the decade, Bell Island iron ore became uncompetitive.

[[File:Labrador helicopter landing Bell Island.jpg|thumb| A [[Canadian Forces]]&lt;!-- from  the late 1960s thru 2011, it was 'Canadian Forces', not the RCAF, pls do not change --&gt; [[Boeing Vertol CH-113 Labrador|Labrador helicopter]] landing on "The Clapper", a [[sea stack]] off the tip of Bell Island, in 1987.]]

During the early 1960s, the steel and coal industries on [[Cape Breton Island]] began to falter in the face of foreign competition. In 1966 the steel mill in Sydney and nearby coal mines were slated to be closed. At the same time, iron ore mining at Wabana stopped.

Bell Island's resource-based economy was hard-hit by the shutdown, resulting in a large out-migration of residents. Some moved to the nearby growing metropolitan centre of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]]. In recent decades a reverse move has occurred where housing is being built on Bell Island to accommodate residents who wish to [[commuting|commute]] by [[ferry]] (20 minutes each direction) to [[Portugal Cove – St. Philip's|Portugal Cove]] and travel to work in the city.

The scenic and sheltered waters of Conception Bay are also seeing an increase in pleasure boating activity as the suburban communities grow around nearby [[Conception Bay South]].

In September 2015, concerns were expressed over the possible collapse of the abandoned tunnels that formed part of the Bell Island mine. A retired miner, Peter Young, told [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio's ''On The Go'']] that tunnels under the abandoned mines, going down as far as two kilometres, hold the potential for a large-scale disaster. He felt that a collapse would initiate a local earthquake giving rise to the secondary effect of the water level in Conception Bay around the mine dropping which in turn could force a tsunami from the surrounding ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bell Island collapse not an if, but a when, engineer says|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/bell-island-collapse-not-an-if-but-a-when-engineer-says-1.3243353?cmp=rss|website=CBC|accessdate=27 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426193214/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/bell-island-collapse-not-an-if-but-a-when-engineer-says-1.3243353?cmp=rss|archivedate=26 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bell Island boom ==
On  April 2, 1978, there was a loud explosion on Bell Island which caused damage to some houses and the electrical house wiring in the surrounding area. Two cup-shaped holes about two feet deep and three feet wide marked the major impact.  A number of TV sets in Lance Cove, the surrounding community, exploded at the time of the blast. It was initially thought to be caused by [[ball lightning]].&lt;ref name="disastersp97"&gt;{{cite book |last=Oickle |first=Vernon |title=Disasters of Atlantic Canada: Stories of Courage &amp; Chaos |year=2007 |publisher=Folklore Publishing |isbn=1-894864-15-8 | page=97 |chapter=Bell Island Boom}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meteorology|Meteorologists]] confirmed that atmospheric conditions at the time were not conducive to [[lightning]]. The boom was heard 55 kilometers away in [[Cape Broyle]]. The impact occurred in the Bickfordville area, on the southwestern side of the island.

The incident was investigated by John Warren and Robert Freyman from [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]], in [[New Mexico]]. It has been speculated that, due to the two men's place of work, they were investigating a secret weapons test and were military attachés. However, reacting to data received from the [[Vela (satellite)|Vela satellites]], they were in fact investigating a "[[Lightning#Observational variations|superbolt]]" – an unusually large bolt of lightning, lasting an unusually long time: about a thousandth of a second.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

A documentary that aired on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] about [[electromagnetic pulse]] weapons investigated the speculation that the incident may have been a result of top secret experiments. It was postulated that either the Soviet or the U.S. governments were the cause of the 'attack' and that it involved high energy beams focused into the ionosphere that were attracted by the iron in abandoned mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4515534125267138757&amp;sourceid=docidfeed&amp;hl=en#|title=The Invisible Machine: Electromagnetic Warfare|publisher=History Channel|date=c. 2007|medium=Television production|accessdate=30 October 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519215453/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4515534125267138757&amp;sourceid=docidfeed&amp;hl=en|archivedate=19 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Skeptoid]]'' podcast "The Bell Island Boom", presenter Brian Dunning dismissed that theory, stating, "Although iron is magnetic and can be magnetized, natural iron ore has its molecules jumbled in every direction and rarely happens to have a significant magnetic field, certainly not strong enough to divert or attract a particle beam."&lt;ref name="skeptoid.com"&gt;{{Skeptoid |id=4190 |number= 190 |title=The Bell Island Boom |date=2010-01-26 |access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some have pointed out that the natural oolitic iron ore on Bell Island is magnetic due to its hematite content, such ore does not ''generate'' a magnetic field, for the reasons Dunning discussed.&lt;ref name="Özdemir-Deutsch"&gt;Özdemir, Ö.; Deutsch, E. R., "Magnetic properties of oolitic iron ore on Bell Island, Newfoundland," ''Earth and Planetary Science Letters, Volume 69, Issue 2, pp. 427–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Datasets from the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), and [[NASA]] are considered primary examples.

The idea behind Climate Mirror is comparable to the notion that [[LOCKSS|lots of copies keep stuff safe]] from disappearing through [[censorship]], [[link rot]], lapses of [[professionalism]] in preserving the integrity of the [[scientific literature|scientific record]], or lack of [[digital permanence]]. It offers a parallel type of massive backup.

The '''Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union''' (CFMMEU) is Australia's main trade union in construction, [[forestry]], [[wikt:maritime|maritime]], mining, energy, textile, clothing and footwear production. The CFMMEU is affiliated with the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]], with the [[Australian Labor Party]] and with the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]].

The CFMMEU has offices in all capital cities in Australia and in many major regional centres with the national office of the union being in Melbourne. The union has an estimated 120,000 members and employs around 400 full-time staff and [[officials]].&lt;ref name="cfmeu_page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Principal Officers|url=https://www.cfmeu.org.au/team-members|website=CFMEU|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, a two-year long process ended resulting in a merger between the old CFMEU, the [[Maritime Union of Australia]] and the [[Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia]]. The new union is the second biggest union by membership in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afr.com/news/policy/industrial-relations/cfmeumua-superunion-gets-fair-work-approval-20180305-h0x1ye&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-06/cfmeu-maritime-union-to-merge-fair-work-decision/9517618&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions==
The CFMMEU is structured into different divisions – '''Construction and General Division''', '''Mining and Energy Division''', '''Manufacturing  Division''' and '''Maritime Union of Australia Division'''. Each division operates largely autonomously.

===Construction and General Division===

====History====
The Construction and General Division was formed in the early 1990s with the creation of the national CFMEU. The creation of a single building union had been a policy objective of various building unions for decades with records showing the Queensland Branch of the Operative Painters and Decorators Union (OPDU) carried resolutions calling for a single industry union to be created as early as the 1920s.  The rationale behind this policy position was the logical view that members would be better represented by a larger industry-based union rather than the traditional craft unions.

The largest amalgamating union, the [[Building Workers' Industrial Union]] (BWIU) was itself the result of numerous amalgamations over several decades between 1946 and 1992.  The coverage of the BWIU included numerous craft unions representing building tradespeople including bricklayers, carpenters, plasterers, tilers, stonemasons and various skilled non-trades construction workers.  In the late 1980s the BWIU increased its coverage to include other construction workers such as steel fixers, concreters, construction labourers and trades assistants following the deregistration of the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF).

The division also has members working off-site in manufacturing workplaces such as shopfitting workshops, joinery shops and other establishments involved in the pre-fabrication of materials used in the construction process.  Members also work in brick, tile and pottery manufacturing and in Queensland, the union covers furnishing trades as there is no formal Forestry Division in the State, due to the [[Australian Workers' Union]]'s historical coverage of this industry.  The Queensland Branch does, however have a presence in Queensland's forestry sector with CFMEU members employed by the State Government working for the Department of Primary Industries.

With the absorption of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemens Association of Australasia (FEDFA) which had coverage of crane drivers, plant operators, and other construction workers, the Construction and General Division has moved closer to fulfilling the policy objective of creating a single industry union for construction workers.

====Political Activity====
The Construction Division is often associated with the left faction of the [[Australian labour movement]], but during the 2010 Federal election the CFMEU and [[Australian Manufacturing Workers Union|AMWU]] donated a total of $60,000 to the Greens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keane|first=Bernard|title=Electoral funding figures show Labor's donations collapse|url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2012/02/01/australian-electoral-funding-figures-liberal-and-labor/?wpmp_switcher=mobile|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Crikey|date=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each State division operates with autonomy, which results in differing services being offered to members.

The NSW Branch of the CFMEU General and Construction Division has an estimated 5,000 members and the Victorian Branch around 9,500.

In August 2010, the CFMEU donated over $1.2&amp;nbsp;million to political activist group [[GetUp!]] to pay for TV airtime for a women's rights ad-spot condemning [[Tony Abbott]] and the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getup.org.au/about/disclosure/ GetUp! website, accessed 21 Nov 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2013 Election the CFMEU donated $50,000 to the Greens party in the ACT.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-18/cfmeu-confirms-donation-to-act-greens-election-campaign/5678056&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forestry and Furnishing Products Division===
[[File:Forestry and Furnishing Products Division (logo).png|right|180px]]
The CFMMEU Forestry and Furnishing Products Division was first registered as a Federal Organisation 21 August 1907, as the Federated Sawmill, Timber-yard and Woodworkers Employees Association of Australasia.

The Union's name was changed in 1913 to the Amalgamated Timber Workers Union of Australia, and again in 1918 to the Australian Timber Workers Union.

In late 1990 a ballot was conducted by members of the Australian Timber Workers Union and the [[Pulp and Paper Workers Federation of Australia]] endorsing the amalgamation of both Unions to form the Australian Timber and Allied Industries Union.

Another ballot was conducted in mid-1991 on the amalgamation between the Australian Timber and Allied Industries Union and the Building Workers Industrial Union. This endorsement supported the first stage in the development of what is now the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union. The Forest and Furnishing Products Division represents 20,000 members nationally.

===Mining and Energy Division===
[[Image:Miningandenergy.png|right|180px]]
The Mining and Energy Division consists of a number of unions which have amalgamated. The largest union to contribute to the formation of the division was the [[Australian Coal and Shale Employees' Federation]] (ACSEF) (often known as the Miners Federation) which had a continuous history dating back to 1915.  Predecessors to the ACSEF had existed on and off since the 1850s.

Industries covered by the Mining and Energy Division include the coal industry, coal ports, the metalliferous mining industry, electric power generation, oil and gas and the small coke industry.

*The Coal Industry: The coal industry is the majority of the Mining and Energy Divisions' coverage. Of more than 16,500 members around 13,000 work in the coal industry. The CFMEU is the primary union for the coal mining industry.
* Coal Ports:  The union represents most workers (approximately 500) at export coal ports located along the east coast of Australia
* Metalliferous Mining: The Division covers most metalliferous miners in Broken Hill where silver, lead and zinc ores are mined. There are around 400 members at Broken Hill. Other mines are largely covered by the AWU.  Through the amalgamation with the FEDFA, the division also has around 1,500 members at metalliferous mines in [[Western Australia]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]] and [[Queensland]].
* Oil, gas and electricity: The division has around 2,200 members employed in power stations, oil refineries and other parts of the oil and gas production chain. This division is the major union representing workers in the Victorian power generation industry.
* The Coke Industry: This industry as a stand-alone commercial industry is quite small in Australia. Most coke production is tied to iron and steel operations. There are stand-alone coke works on the South Coast of NSW (north of [[Wollongong]]) and in [[Bowen, Queensland|Bowen]] in Northern Queensland. The Mining and Energy Division covers the cokeworks on the south coast and the AWU covers the Bowen site. The CFMEU has approximately 50 members in the coke industry.

===Maritime Union of Australia Division===
{{main article|Maritime Union of Australia}}
The Maritime Union of Australia Division consists of the amalgamated [[Maritime Union of Australia]]. As of 2017, the division represents 16,000 workers associated with Australian ports.

In the [[Victorian state election, 2018|2018 Victorian Election]], the Maritime Union of Australia Division donated an unknown amount to the [[Victorian Socialists]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jolly |first1=Stephen |title=Stephen Jolly on Twitter |url=https://twitter.com/stephenjolly99/status/1048366921664487424 |website=Twitter |accessdate=7 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent events==

===Building and construction industry regulation===
[[Image:Martin Kingham, CFMEU.JPG|thumb|right|Martin Kingham, Former Victorian secretary of the CFMEU speaking at a rally to oppose the Howard government's then-proposed [[Voluntary student unionism|VSU]] legislation.]]
In 2001, the [[Howard Government]] set up the [[Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry]] (commonly known as the ''Cole Royal Commission''). The Commission and its findings were largely condemned by the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] and the [[Australian Greens|Greens]] which argued that the terms of reference were too narrow. The CFMEU asserted that the purpose of the Commission was a "witch-hunt" to reduce the power of the CFMEU rather than to investigate crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.cfmeu.asn.au/construction/press/vic/20030502_RCcontemptcase.html |title=Royal Commission contempt case |date=2 May 2003 |publisher=CFMEU |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030605110901/http://www.cfmeu.asn.au/construction/press/vic/20030502_RCcontemptcase.html |archivedate=5 June 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The General and Construction Division of the union stopped some corruption within the union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2001/s296609.htm |author=Hardaker, David |title=Investigation into building industry corruption to release findings |date=14 May 2001 |work=[[The 7.30 Report]] |format=transcript |publisher=[[ABC1|ABC TV]] |location=Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Cole found 392 cases of unlawful conduct; 98 cases were passed on to prosecution authorities by the Commonwealth [[Attorney-General for Australia|Attorney-General]], of which 26 were considered breaches of criminal law.

As a result of the Commission's findings the Howard Government established the [[Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner|Australian Building and Construction Commission]] (ABCC) in 2005. It had a wide range of powers, including compelling testimony under oath, with penalties of up to $22,000 for individuals and $110,000 for corporations and unions apply for breaches of the ''Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005''. The ABCC was abolished in 2012 by the [[Gillard Government]] and was replaced by the [[Fair Work Building and Construction]]. In December 2016, after two failed attempts to reintroduce the ABCC which included the trigger for the [[double dissolution]] [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]], the [[Turnbull Government]] was successful in reinstating the [[Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner|Australian Building and Construction Commission]] with key support from Senators [[Pauline Hanson's One Nation]], [[Nick Xenophon Team]] and [[Derryn Hinch]].

In 2015 a proposal to reinstate the ABCC was submitted by the [[Abbott Government]], but failed to pass the two houses of Parliament. A further attempt to pass the legislation was submitted by the [[Turnbull Government]] in March 2016, and was a [[double dissolution]] trigger for the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]].

Under [[WorkChoices]], situations where industrial action could take place were reduced{{fact|date=April 2016}}{{vague|date=October 2016}}{{when?|date=October 2016}}. The CFMEU and workers had to prove a workplace was unsafe to put a stop to work on a site which has not happened to date{{fact|date=April 2016}}.

===Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v BHP Coal Pty Ltd===
During 2011 and 2012, BHP Coal and its employees were negotiating about a new enterprise agreement to apply to BHP Coal's operations at various mines, including the Saraji mine.  For the purpose of supporting or advancing their claims, employees of BHP Coal took protected industrial action in the form of work stoppages and overtime bans.  There was a seven-day work stoppage between 15 and 22 February 2012. During this stoppage, members of the CFMEU who were employed at the Saraji mine, including Mr Doevendans, participated in protests beside the road leading into the mine property.  Standing behind barriers BHP Coal had erected at the side of the road, the protesters held up signs which the CFMEU had provided and waved the signs at those who were driving into the mine.  The signs were directly or indirectly critical of BHP Coal and of those who were driving into the mine.  On four occasions over three days, Mr Doevendans held up a sign that read:  "No principles Scabs No guts." Some employees of BHP Coal complained to management about the scabs sign. Following some interactions with management, Mr Doevendans' employment with BHP was terminated.&lt;ref name=CFMEUvBHP&gt;{{cite web |last1=High Court of Australia |title=Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v BHP Coal Pty Ltd [2014] HCA 41 |url=https://jade.barnet.com.au/Jade.html#article=349099 |accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On appeal to the High Court of Australia, it was held that the dismissal of Mr Doevendans was permissible under the ''[[Fair Work Act 2009]]''.&lt;ref name=CFMEUvBHP/&gt;

==Amalgamations==
The federal division of the Federated Saw Mill, Timber Yard and General Wood Workers Employees' Association changed its name to the Amalgamated Timber Workers' Union of Australia. The former union had been registered federally in 1907 and had registered branches in Victoria, Adelaide, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania. Although the organisation was deregistered in 1918 its members formed a new union, the Australian Timber Workers' Union, the same year. The new union extended coverage to workers in box and case factories, saw makers' shops, [[joiner]]s' workshops, [[carpenter]]s, implement workers and wood-working [[machinist]]s. In 1940 the union filed an application and succeeded in extending its coverage to most workers employed in the timber and wood industry including [[cabinet maker]]s and furniture factories. In 1991 it [[amalgamation (business)|amalgamated]] with the Pulp &amp; Paper Workers' Federation of Australia to form the Australian Timber &amp; Allied Industries Union. Later in the year amalgamation with the Building Workers' Industrial Union of Australia created the ATAIU &amp; BWIU Amalgamated Union. Further amalgamations eventually saw this organisation become part of the Construction Forestry Mining &amp; Energy Union in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivescollection.anu.edu.au/index.php/australian-timber-workers-union-tasmanian-branch-deposit-1|title=Context area, deposit description, Australian Timber Workers' Union, Tasmanian Branch deposit 1|date=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merger with Maritime Union of Australia, 2015/16==
Since late 2015, the [[Maritime Union of Australia]] and CFMEU have been in merger talks to create 'Australia's most powerful union'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-16/cfmeu-and-maritime-unions-enter-merger-talks/6860932 CFMEU and MUA enter merger talks to create 'Australia's most powerful union']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mua.org.au/mua_and_cfmeu_merger_on_the_cards MUA and CFMEU Merger Talks Underway]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 February 2016 at the MUA national conference, delegates voted unanimously in favour of negotiations for a merger with the CFMEU by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fullyloaded.com.au/industry-news/1603/mua-to-begin-merger-negotiations-with-cfmeu/ MUA to begin merger negotiations with CFMEU]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-29/maritime-union-votes-in-favour-merging-with-construction-union/7209264 Maritime Union of Australia delegates vote in favour of merging with Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union]&lt;/ref&gt;

The merger was approved by the Fair Work Commission in March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wright|first1=Patrick|title=CFMEU, Maritime Union of Australia merger approved by Fair Work Commission|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-06/cfmeu-maritime-union-to-merge-fair-work-decision/9517618|accessdate=7 March 2018|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dip circles''' (also ''dip needles'') are used to measure the angle between the [[horizon]] and the [[Earth's magnetic field]] (the [[Magnetic dip|dip angle]]).  They were used in [[surveying]], [[mining]] and [[prospecting]] as well as for the demonstration and study of [[magnetism]].

[[Georg Hartmann]] first discovered dip angle in 1544, when he noticed the needle on a [[compass]] dipped towards the north [[Northern Hemisphere|hemisphere]].  Rather than explore this phenomenon, Hartmann sought ways to eliminate it. However, [[Robert Norman]] around 1576 investigated dip angle further and in 1581 described in print a device to measure this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Robert; Borough, William. (1581). ''The newe attractiue, containyng a short discourse of the magnes or lodestone, and amongst other his vertues, of a newe discouered secret and subtill propertie, concernyng the declinyng of the needle, touched therewith vnder the plaine of the horizon. Now first founde out by Robert Norman. Herevnto are annexed certaine necessarie rules for the art of nauigation, by the same R. N.'' London: Ihon Kyngston for Richard Ballard. [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/181712334 WorldCat record.] OCLC: 181712334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early dip circles were not accurate and gave poor results.  Over the next 300 years many improvements were made, including reducing the [[friction]] between the needle and its pivot and encasing the circle in glass.  Between the late 18th century and late 19th century the design approached its peak. Improvements which made the dip circle a practical aid for polar navigation were made by [[Robert Were Fox the Younger|Robert Were Fox]] FRS, who developed in the 1830s the first dip circle that could be used on board a moving ship. Another important improvement to the instrument was developed in the 1830s by the [[Dublin]] Physicist Humphrey Lloyd, who devised a way of attaching a magnetic needle at right-angles to the dip needle in order to measure the intensity of [[force]] (by seeing the extent to which the right-angle needle deflected the dip-needle).

By [[World War I]] the most advanced dip circles were being made.  With the development of electronic systems dip circles became obsolete.

'''Edward Brinton''' (January 12, 1924 &amp;ndash; January 13, 2010) was a professor of [[oceanography]] and research [[biologist]].  His particular area of expertise was Euphausiids or [[Krill]], small shrimp-like creatures found in all the oceans of the world.
{{TOC left}}

==Early life==
Brinton was born on January 12, 1924, in Richmond, Indiana to a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] couple, [[Howard Brinton]] and Anna Shipley Cox Brinton.  Much of his childhood was spent on the grounds of [[Mills College]] where his mother was Dean of Faculty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://archive.org/stream/careerhigheredu00bennrich/careerhigheredu00bennrich_djvu.txt | title = A career in higher education : Mills College, 1935-1974 : oral history transcript, 1986 | accessdate = 2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,798797-2,00.html | work=Time | title=Religion: Pendle Hill | date=1948-06-21 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his father was a professor.  The family later moved to the [[Pendle Hill Quaker Center for Study and Contemplation]], in Pennsylvania where his father and mother became directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pendlehill.org/vision-mission-and-history/90-pendle-hill-beginnings?start=1 | title = Religion: Pendle Hill | date = 1948-06-21 | accessdate = 2010-01-23 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100108130218/http://www.pendlehill.org/vision-mission-and-history/90-pendle-hill-beginnings?start=1 | archivedate = 2010-01-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Brinton attended High School at [[Westtown School]] in Chester County, Pennsylvania.  He studied at [[Haverford College]] and graduated in 1949 with a bachelor's degree in biology. He enrolled at [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] as a graduate student in 1950 and was awarded a Ph.D. in 1957.  He continued on as a research biologist in the Marine Life Research Group, part of the [[CalCOFI]] program. He soon turned his dissertation into a major publication, The Distribution of Pacific [[Euphausiids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=E. Brinton |title=The distribution of Pacific euphausiids |journal=Bull. Scripps Inst. Oceanogr. |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=51–270 |year=1962 |url=http://repositories.cdlib.org/sio/bulletin/8no2/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="escholarship"&gt;http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/3xq6r58k&lt;/ref&gt; In this large monograph, he laid out the major biogeographic provinces of the Pacific (and part of the Atlantic), large-scale patterns of pelagic diversity and one of the most rational hypotheses for the mechanism of sympatric, oceanic speciation. In all of these studies the role of physical oceanography and circulation played a prominent part. His work has since been validated by others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal =Evolution | volume = 59 | issue = 11 | pages = 2378&amp;ndash;2398 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1554/05-077.1 | title = GLOBAL POPULATION GENETIC STRUCTURE AND BIOGEOGRAPHY OF THE OCEANIC COPEPODS EUCALANUS HYALINUS AND E.

He has described several new species and, in collaboration with Margaret Knight, worked out the complicated life histories of many Euphausiid species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=E.

His Academic career continued at Scripps until his retirement in the 1991.

==Family life==
Brinton met and married Desiree Ward in 1948.  He had four children and was widowed in 1976.  He remained unmarried until the time of his death.  His primary residence was in La Jolla, California. He and his family lived in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] for a year in 1960, and in [[Kerala]], [[India]] from 1965-1967.  He died after a long illness on January 13, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scrippsnews.ucsd.edu/Releases/?releaseID=1042 Obituary] [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]]. Retrieved 2010-01-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== General Overview of the '''[[Environmental issue|environmental issues]] in [[Azerbaijan]]'''.[edit] ==
Like most (previous) republics of the [[Soviet Union]] which experienced rapid development of all spheres of economics and human activity which has led to an increasingly negative impact on the environment, including the [[Resource efficiency|inefficient usage]] of [[natural resources]]. As can be seen in many other countries, [[Azerbaijan]] is interested in finding solutions to the problems regarding [[environmental protection]] and rational utilization of natural resources. In support of Azerbaijan's environmental protection goals, a number of important laws, legal documents and state programs, all of which conform to European law requirements, have been developed and approved in order to improve the ecological situation in the country. However, problems arose as these precautionary laws have not been as effective as they were meant to be.  Transparency has been a consistent issue in Azerbaijan as NGO's who are given legal authority to collect data from the oil refineries are often blocked or dismissed, and their information comes unofficially. Domestic oil producers have often skimped out on the regulations, disregarding the oil leaks that plague the [[Caspian Sea]]. In the next 30 years, Azerbaijan will produce more oil than it produced during the last century.  This means that there is little coordination and precaution with the excessive drilling for oil. Part of this is the lack of communication with its neighbors in the Caspian Sea.

=== Local Health Is Affected Most[edit] ===
The most severe pollutions are the following: dumped petroleum during the Soviet Period, discharge of sewage, depleted stocks of sturgeon, severe air pollution, and heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers. Many of the locals are constantly exposed to the contaminants, and they have accepted to live in it. Some even comment on the beauty of the ocean with the layer of oil that glisten on the top. Unfortunately, the smell and the ramifications of constant exposure to harmful vapors are a concern to the local health, particularly the coastline of Azerbaijan.  The ramifications of petro-fueled industries are the following health concerns: harms to the pulmonary, digestive, circulatory, and immune systems. In the worst cases, genetic mutations can occur. Groundwater is also affected by the oil spills causing cancers and bacterial diseases like cholera and hepatitis. 

=== Other forms of pollution [edit][edit] ===
The following are the principal ecological problems of Azerbaijan:
* The pollution of water resources by way of introduction of [[contaminated water]], including transnational pollution
* The supply of low-quality water to inhabited regions, the loss of fresh water prior to it delivery to the end consumers, insufficient development of sewer systems
* [[Air pollution]] from industrial plants and transport vehicles
* [[Soil degradation|Degradation]] of soil ([[erosion]], [[desertification]], etc.)
* Deforestation as the burning trees affect the climate cycle
* Improper regulation of industry and housing, as well as hazardous solid wastes
* [[Biodiversity loss|Decline in biological diversity]]
* Decline in forest reserves and fauna, especially fish results

== Conclusion[edit] ==
The government has focused on these issues and the judicial system has provided laws to safeguard local health. Foreign oil producers and refineries have been more consistent with these regulations, while not all the time, more so than the domestic oil companies. British Petroleum is one such company that attempts to clean the floors of the ocean by separating the contaminants with the rest of the natural setting. Still, locals are without much strength as the people cannot depend on the judicial system to be actionable as the country is still shedding its war-torn past.

The '''Exner equation''' is a statement of [[conservation of mass]] that applies to [[sediment]] in a [[fluvial]] system such as a [[river]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Paola | first1 = C. | last2 = Voller | first2 = V. R. | title = A generalized Exner equation for sediment mass balance | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 110 | pages = F04014 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1029/2004JF000274| bibcode=2005JGRF..11004014P}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by the Austrian meteorologist and sedimentologist [[Felix Maria Exner]], from whom it derives its name.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, G. (2006), 1D Sediment Transport Morphodynamics with applications to Rivers and Turbidity Currents, Chapter 1, http://vtchl.uiuc.edu/people/parkerg/_private/e-bookPowerPoint/RTe-bookCh1IntroMorphodynamics.ppt.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The equation==

The Exner equation describes [[conservation of mass]] between sediment in the bed of a channel and [[sediment transport|sediment that is being transported]]. It states that bed elevation increases (the bed [[aggradation|aggrades]]) proportionally to the amount of sediment that drops out of transport, and conversely decreases (the bed [[degradation (geology)|degrades]]) proportionally to the amount of sediment that becomes entrained by the flow.

===Basic equation===
The equation states that the change in bed elevation, &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;, over time, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, is equal to one over the grain packing density, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_o&lt;/math&gt;, times the negative [[divergence]] of sediment [[flux]], &lt;math&gt;q_s&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_o}\nabla\cdot\mathbf{q_s}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_o&lt;/math&gt; can also be expressed as &lt;math&gt;(1-\lambda_p)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_p&lt;/math&gt; equals the bed [[porosity]].

Good values of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_o&lt;/math&gt; for natural systems range from 0.45 to 0.75.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, G. (2006), 1D Sediment Transport Morphodynamics with applications to Rivers and Turbidity Currents, Chapter 4, http://vtchl.uiuc.edu/people/parkerg/_private/e-bookPowerPoint/RTe-bookCh4ConservationBedSed.ppt.&lt;/ref&gt; A typical good value for spherical grains is 0.64, as given by [[random close pack]]ing. An upper bound for close-packed spherical grains is 0.74048. (See [[sphere packing]] for more details); this degree of packing is extremely improbable in natural systems, making random close packing the more realistic upper bound on grain packing density.

Often, for reasons of computational convenience and/or lack of data, the Exner equation is used in its one-dimensional form. This is generally done with respect to the down-stream direction &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, as one is typically interested in the down-stream distribution of [[erosion]] and [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]] though a river reach.

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_o}\frac{\partial\mathbf{q_s}}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

===Including external changes in elevation===
An additional form of the Exner equation adds a [[subsidence]] term, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, to the mass-balance. This allows the absolute [[elevation]] of the bed &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; to be tracked over time in a situation in which it is being changed by outside influences, such as [[tectonic]] or compression-related subsidence ([[Isostasy|isostatic compression or rebound]]). In the convention of the following equation, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is positive with an increase in elevation over time and is negative with a decrease in elevation over time.

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_o}\nabla\cdot\mathbf{q_s}+\sigma&lt;/math&gt;

'''Hibonite''' ((Ca,Ce)(Al,Ti,Mg)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;) is a mineral, occurring in various colours, with a hardness of 7.5–8.0 and a hexagonal crystal structure. It is rare, but is found in high-grade [[metamorphic rocks]] on [[Madagascar]]. Some [[presolar grains]] in primitive [[meteorites]] consist of hibonite. Hibonite also is a common mineral in the [[Ca-Al-rich inclusion]]s (CAIs) found in some [[chondrite|chondritic meteorites]]. Hibonite is closely related to hibonite-Fe (IMA 2009-027, ((Fe,Mg)Al&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;)) an alteration mineral from the Allende meteorite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rruff.info/ima/|title=IMA Mineral List with Database of Mineral Properties|website=rruff.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very rare gem, hibonite was discovered in 1953 in Madagascar by Paul Hibon, a French prospector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gemdat.org/gem-1897.html|title=Hibonite gemstone information|website=www.gemdat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colour==
Hibonite can vary in colour, from a bright blue, to green, to orange, to a nearly black deep brown. The colour is related to the degree of oxidation; meteoritic hibonite tends to be blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ihinger |first1=Phillip D.  |last2=Stolper |first2=Edward |title=The color of meteoritic hibonite: an indicator of oxygen fugacity |journal=[[Earth and Planetary Science Letters]] |volume=78 |issue=1 |date=May 1986 |pages=67–79 |doi=10.1016/0012-821X(86)90173-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10581">'''Intermediate band photovoltaics''' in [[solar cell]] research provides methods for exceeding the [[Shockley–Queisser limit]] on the efficiency of a cell. It introduces an intermediate band (IB) energy level in between the valence and conduction bands. Theoretically, introducing an IB allows two [[photons]] with energy less than the [[bandgap]] to excite an electron from the [[valence band]] to the [[conduction band]]. This increases the induced photocurrent and thereby efficiency.&lt;ref name="ref5" /&gt;

==Limiting efficiencies==

===One band===
[[Antonio Luque López|Luque]] and Marti first derived a theoretical limit for an IB device with one midgap energy level using [[detailed balance]].&lt;ref name="ref5" /&gt; They assumed no carriers were collected at the IB and that the device was under full concentration.&lt;ref name="ref5" /&gt; They found the maximum efficiency to be 63.2%, for a bandgap of 1.95eV with the IB 0.71eV from either the valence or conduction band.&lt;ref name="ref5" /&gt;
Under one sun illumination the limiting efficiency is 47%.&lt;ref name="ref8" /&gt;

===Infinite bands===
Green and Brown expanded upon these results by deriving the theoretical efficiency limit for a device with infinite IBs.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; By introducing more IB’s, even more of the incident spectrum can be utilized.
After performing the detailed balance, they found the maximum efficiency to be 77.2%.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;
This efficiency is less than that of a multijunction cell with infinite junctions. This is because in multijunction cells, electrons are captured exactly after being excited to a higher energy state, while in an IB device, the electrons still need another energy transition to reach the conduction band and be collected.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

==Current technology==

IBs have theoretical potential to become high efficiency devices, but they are hard to make. Introducing an IB greatly increases non-radiative recombination mechanisms.&lt;ref name="ref14" /&gt; Additionally, IBs need to be partially filled to allow for carrier movement to and from the IB. This often requires donor carriers.&lt;ref name="ref8" /&gt; The three current methods of fabricating IB devices are described below.

===Quantum dots===

The first method is to introduce small, homogenous QD structures into a single junction device.&lt;ref name="ref8" /&gt; 
This creates an IB, which can be tuned by changing the shape and size of the QDs.&lt;ref name="ref9" /&gt; For an experimental device to show high efficiency potential, it must demonstrate that it can generate current from the absorption of sub-bandgap photons, while preserving the output voltage of the device.&lt;ref name="ref9" /&gt; Using quantum dots, some experimental devices, such as InAs/GaAs, have been able to do this.&lt;ref name="ref9" /&gt; InAs/GaAs devices have been able to produce efficiencies as high as 18.3%, although this is still lower than the comparable single junction device.&lt;ref name="ref4" /&gt; Unfortunately, QD structures have several issues:&lt;ref name="ref8" /&gt;

#	The introduced IB is often empty, requiring donor carriers to partially fill it. 
#	The devices are typically only effective at low temperatures as they are prone to thermal escape.  
# 	The use of QDs increases non-radiative recombination, which decreases sub-bandgap performance.  
#	Increasing the amount of QD layers can improve sub-bandgap performance, but also increases the lattice strain on the device.

Therefore, more research is needed to fabricate truly high efficient devices. Specifically, high-density QD structures with long carrier lifetimes need to be developed and new materials need to be found to eliminate the need to use donor carriers to fill the IB.&lt;ref name="ref8" /&gt;

===Highly mismatched alloys===

Another method of fabricating an IB device is to use highly mismatched alloys. The use of these mismatched alloys introduces an IB due to the band anti-crossing (BAC) mechanism.&lt;ref name="ref3" /&gt; This is essentially the splitting of the valence or conduction band, depending on the alloy type, into two bands.&lt;ref name="ref3" /&gt; These materials are typically made of III-V alloys, however they have also been fabricated with II-VI alloys.&lt;ref name="ref3" /&gt;
The two most studied alloys are ZnTe doped with O and GaAs doped with N.&lt;ref name="ref16" /&gt; Both of these devices have experimentally shown the absorption of sub-bandgap photons, however neither has been able to demonstrate voltage preservation.&lt;ref name="ref16" /&gt; Despite this, ZnTeO devices have demonstrated a higher photocurrent and efficiency than a comparable single bandgap ZnTe device.&lt;ref name="ref4" /&gt; 
Unfortunately, both structures exhibit efficiency less than 1%.&lt;ref name="ref4" /&gt; Moving forward, more research is needed to find materials with natural partially filled IB bands.&lt;ref name="ref9" /&gt;

===Bulk materials with deep level impurities===

Finally, the last approach is to introduce deep level impurities (DLI) into a semiconductor bulk material.&lt;ref name="ref9" /&gt; 
This method is similar to highly mismatched alloys, however the doping percentages are much less. The biggest issue with these devices is that the non-radiative recombination, predominantly Shockley-Read-Hall, significantly increases.&lt;ref name="ref6" /&gt;
Significant research in this field was aimed at achieving “lifetime recovery”, or the ability to increase carrier lifetime by introducing more DLIs.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; In particular, it was believed that lifetime recovery could be achieved by increasing the DLI concentrations to the insulator to metal transition.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; Krich, however, disproved this and in the process proposed a “figure of merit” to determine if materials would be suitable for high efficiency IB’s.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; The idea was that if the non-radiative recombination lifetime was significantly higher than the transit time for an electron to move from the conduction band to the IB, then the material could increase efficiency.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; Essentially, the electron could reach the IB before recombining, leading to a higher induced photocurrent. 
This figure of merit has been used to explain why no usable device has been fabricated using highly doped silicon. Chalcogen doped silicon, in particular, have low figures of merit due to their small non-radiative recombination lifetimes.&lt;ref name="ref10" /&gt; To achieve IB devices, more research needs to be done to find a bulk semiconductor material that exhibits higher non-radiative recombination lifetimes.

The '''IAGC''' ('''International Association of GeoChemistry''', formerly known as the International Association of Geochemistry and Cosmochemistry) is affiliated with the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] and has been one of the pre-eminent international geochemical organizations for over thirty-five years. {{cn|date=November 2016}}

The principal objective of the IAGC is to foster co-operation in, and advancement of, [[geochemistry]] in the broadest sense. This is achieved by:
# working with any interested group in planning symposia and other types of meetings related to geochemistry, 
# sponsoring publications in geochemistry of a type not normally covered by existing organizations and,
# the activities of working groups which study problems that require, or would benefit from, international co-operation.

The scientific thrust of the IAGC takes place through its Working Groups (many of which organize regular symposia) and the official journal, Applied Geochemistry.

The specific objectives of the IAGC are:

# To foster the use of the tools and techniques of chemistry to advance the understanding of the earth and its component systems for the benefit of mankind and modern society;
# To contribute to advancement in geochemical research throughout the world, including both fundamental geochemical research aimed at understanding the global earth system and applied geochemical research that addresses problems of particular relevance to the welfare of mankind and society;
# To promote international and education cooperation in geochemistry through outreach activities that include:
#* establishing internal specialty-area working groups in topic areas that would benefit from international scientific cooperation,
#* sponsoring international scientific meetings related to geochemistry,
#* disseminating new knowledge through publication of the journal “Applied Geochemistry,”
#* fostering communication in geochemistry across the international scientific community,
#* encouraging the early career development of young geochemists,
#* contributing to geochemical education,
#* enhancing the visibility of the science of geochemistry and demonstrating its importance to mankind and society.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

==History==
The International Association of Geochemistry and Cosmochemistry (IAGC) was formally founded on 8 May 1967. Prior to that time the organization of international geochemical affairs was largely carried out through the Inorganic Chemistry section of the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) starting in 1960. It was at the twenty-first International Geological Congress (IGC) at Copenhagen in 1960 when the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] (IUGS) was formally established and geochemists formed a close bond with the world geological community. Earl Ingerson, as Chairman or Secretary to three of the then existing international geochemical organizations, coordinated a meeting of members of the committees on geochemistry of the IGC, IUGG and IUPAC in New Delhi in 1964, but was himself unable to attend. This meeting, chaired by Ken Sugawara, drew up draft statutes and nominated temporary officers, with the result that in November 1965, Earl Ingerson called a meeting in Paris to name the association, complete the statutes, elect temporary officers and apply to IUGS for immediate affiliation. The first Council meeting was held on 8 May 1967 at [[UNESCO]] headquarters in Paris, presided over by Earl Ingerson.

Until 2000, the Association's governing body was the General Assembly which met during each IGC. The main internal financial support was provided by National Members who voted at the General Assembly. Some outside funding also came from UNESCO and IUGS Day-to-day operations between each General Assembly were carried out by a Council of five officers and eight Council members.

During its existence, IAGC has, through its various working groups and members, sponsored or co-sponsored more than 40 international meetings, which represent its main financial expenditure. Many of these meetings result from close cooperation with other associations affiliated with IUGS and IUGG, as well as various international, national, provincial and academic organizations. Proceedings of these meetings are usually published. In 1986 the IAGC launched its official journal, Applied Geochemistry.

At the General Assembly of the IAGC in Rio de Janeiro, National Memberships were terminated as it was widely felt that the IAGC was sufficiently mature and financially stable that the control and support of individual countries on the IAGC, through designated representatives (who may not have been geochemists), was redundant and potentially counter-productive. Thus, the IAGC evolved into a self-supported organization whose activities were controlled by its members, through an elected Executive and Council.

Recently, the Statutes of the IAGC have undergone important revisions to be more applicable to current plans and operations. Also, as described on the IAGC homepage, there has been a name change to reflect the applied geochemical nature of the IAGC (now the International Association of GeoChemistry).

[[Image:Leucothea Allasseur cour Carree Louvre.jpg|thumb|180px|''Leucothea'' by [[Jean Jules Allasseur]] (1862), Cour Carrée of the [[Palais du Louvre]].]]

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Leucothea''' ({{IPAc-en|lj|uː|ˈ|k|oʊ|θ|i|ə}}; {{lang-el|Λευκοθέα}} ''Leukothéa''),  "white goddess") was one of the aspects under which an ancient sea goddess was recognized, in this case as a transformed nymph.

In the more familiar variant, [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]], the daughter of [[Cadmus]], sister of [[Semele]], and queen of [[Athamas]], became a goddess  after [[Hera]] drove her insane as a punishment for caring for the newborn [[Dionysus]]. She leapt into the sea with her son [[Melicertes]] in her arms, and out of pity, the Hellenes asserted, the Olympian gods turned them both into sea-gods, transforming Melicertes into [[Melicertes|Palaemon]], the patron of the [[Isthmian games]], and Ino into Leucothea.

In the version sited at [[Rhodes]], a much earlier mythic level is reflected in the genealogy: there, the woman who plunged into the sea and became Leucothea was [[Halia]] ("of the sea", a personification of the saltiness of the sea) whose parents were from the ancient generation, [[Thalassa (mythology)|Thalassa]] and [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] or [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]. She was a local [[nymph]] and one of the aboriginal [[Telchines]] of the island. Halia became [[Poseidon]]'s wife and bore him [[Rhodos]] and six sons; the sons were maddened by [[Aphrodite]] in retaliation for an impious affront, assaulted their sister and were confined beneath the Earth by Poseidon. Thus the Rhodians traced their mythic descent from Rhodos and the Sun god [[Helios]].&lt;ref&gt;Graves 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Odyssey]]'' (5.333 ff.), Leucothea makes a dramatic appearance as a [[gannet]] who tells the shipwrecked Odysseus to discard his cloak and raft and offers him a veil (κρήδεμνον, ''kredemnon'') to wind round himself to save his life and reach land. [[Homer]] makes her the transfiguration of Ino. In Laconia, she has a sanctuary, where she answers people's questions about dreams. This is her form of the oracle.

==Cultural allusions==
Leucothea is mentioned by [[John Milton]] in the ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' scene where archangel Michael descends to Adam and Eve to declare that they must no longer abide in Paradise (second edition, 1674, book XI, lines 133-135):

Meanwhile,&lt;br&gt;
To resalute the World with sacred light,&lt;br&gt;
Leucothea wak'd...&lt;ref&gt;John Milton. ''The English Poems''. Wordsworth Poetry Library, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leucothea is mentioned by [[Robert Graves]] in ''[[The White Goddess]]''.

In [[Ezra Pound]]'s [[Cantos]], she is one of the goddess figures who comes to the poet's aid in ''Section: Rock-Drill'' (Cantos 85–95). She is introduced in Canto 91 as "Cadmus's daughter":&lt;blockquote&gt;
As the sea-gull Κάδμου θυγάτηρ said to Odysseus&lt;br&gt;
KADMOU THUGATER&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"get rid of parap[h]ernalia"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;She returns in Cantos 93 ("Κάδμου θυγάτηρ") and 95 ("Κάδμου θυγάτηρ/ bringing light ''per diafana''/ λευκὁς Λευκόθοε/ white foam, a sea-gull... 'My bikini is worth yr/ raft'. Said Leucothae... Then Leucothea had pity,/'mortal once/ Who now is a sea-god...'"), and reappears at the beginning of Canto 96, the first of the ''Thrones'' section ("Κρήδεμνον.../ κρήδεμνον.../ and the wave concealed her,/ dark mass of great water.").

Leucothea appears twice in ''Dialoghi con Leucò'' (Dialogues with Leucò) by [[Cesare Pavese]].

''[[Leucothoé]]'' was the first work by the Irish playwright [[Isaac Bickerstaffe]] published in 1756.

Leucothea becomes a metaphor, in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower'', for the mist that covers a young man's gaze when looking on the beauty of young women: "...a cloud that had re-formed a few days later, once I had met them, muting the glow of their loveliness, often passing between them and my eyes, which saw them now dimmed, as through a gentle haze, reminiscent of Virgil's Leucothea."&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Proust, ''In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower,'' trans. James Grieve (New York: Penguin Books, 2002), 526.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leukothea is a poem by Keith Douglas.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Douglas The Complete Poems with and introduction by Ted Hughes=&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Other characters ==
A similar name is carried by two other characters in Greek mythology.

*'''Leucothoë''': a princess, daughter of [[Orchamus]] and sister of [[Clytie (Oceanid)|Clytia]], Leucothoë was loved by [[Helios]], who disguised himself as Leucothoë's mother to gain entrance to her chambers. Clytia, jealous of her sister because she wanted Helios for herself, told Orchamus the truth, betraying her sister's trust and confidence in her.  Enraged, Orchamus ordered Leucothoë, who claimed Helios had forced her to succumb to his desires, buried alive. Helios changed Leucothoë's lifeless body into an incense plant. Helios refused to forgive Clytia for betraying his beloved, and a grieving Clytia wilted and slowly turned into a heliotrope, which follows the sun every day.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Leucothoë''', one of the [[Nereids]].&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, ''[[Fabulae]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of undomesticated or feral plants, generally considered [[weed]]s, yet having some positive effects or uses, often being ideal as [[companion plant]]s in gardens.

[[Beneficial weed]]s can accomplish a number of roles in the garden or yard, including fertilizing the soil, increasing moisture, acting as shelter or [[living mulch]], repelling pests, attracting [[beneficial insects]], or serving as food or other resources for human beings.

==Categories of beneficial weeds==

===Pest-repellent===
* [[Neem]]—repels leaf eating insects

===Edible===
* [[Blackberry]]—blackberries are delicious but they form thorny thickets when dead, and their thorn punctures can induce sickness; appropriate medical treatments may thereafter be costly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/lifestyle/home-and-garden/sdut-thorn-punctures-garden-soil-pathogens-2015nov20-story.html|title=Beware thorn punctures; they can make you sick|first=Vincent|last=Lazaneo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Borage]]—all parts have various medicinal purposes, with the edible flowers being used in desserts.
* [[Burdock]]—roots are edible (as are the stalks, but particularly the young leaves &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ediblewildfood.com/burdock.aspx|title=Burdock: Pictures, Flowers, Leaves and Identification - Arctium lappa|website=www.ediblewildfood.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Chickweed]] (''Stellaria media'')—used in salads and also as ground cover
* [[Clover]]—its leaves can be eaten, but not in great numbers due to their natural acidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.survival.org.au/bf_trifolium.php|title=Trifolium - Clover - Edible Weeds and Bush Tucker Plant Foods|website=www.survival.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cornflower]]—various colours; can be served as edible garnish to decorate salads.
* [[Dandelions]]—leaves are edible, while roots are edible after being roasted
* [[Flatweed]]—leaves are edible raw, while roots are edible after being roasted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.survival.org.au/bf_hypochaeris.php|title=Hypochaeris radicata - Catsears|website=www.survival.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Horsetail]]—primeval plant that is high in silica; tops are very similar to &amp; may be eaten like asparagus
* [[Lamb's quarter]]s—leaves and shoots, raw, also prevents [[erosion]], also distracts [[leaf miner]]s from nearby crops
* [[Nettle]]—young leaves collected before flowering used as a tea or spinach substitute. Plants have use as compost material or for fibre.
* [[Purslane]]—prepared raw for salads or sautéed
* [[Shepherd's purse]]—leaves are edible and often sautéed or blanched
* [[Watercress]]—can be eaten raw or cooked; is considered a weed in some cultures (caution required when harvesting wild because of the risk of contracting potentially fatal liver fluke)

===Habitat for beneficial insects===
* Wild [[blackberry]]—attracts predatory insects, and produces berries
* [[Motherwort]]—attracts bees
* [[Joe-Pye weed]]—habitat for pollinators and predatory insects
* [[Aster (genus)|Aster]]—habitat predatory insects

===Shelter plants===
* Normal [[grass]] can be used as ground cover, especially in nitrogenous soils.

===Trap crops===
[[Trap crop]]s draw potential pests away from the actual crop intended for cultivation.

* [[Cowpea]]—attracts ladybird beetle, so planting around cotton fields protects them from sucking insects. It serves as source of food and niche.

===Other===
* [[Solanaceae|Nightshade]]—breaks up [[hardpan]], allowing roots to grow deeper.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

A nuclear close call is an incident that could lead to, or could have led to, at least one unintended nuclear detonation/explosion. These incidents typically involve a perceived imminent threat to a [[nuclear-armed country]] which could lead to retaliatory strikes against the perceived aggressor. The damage caused by international nuclear exchange is not necessarily limited to the participating countries, as the hypothesized rapid [[climate change]] associated with even small-scale regional nuclear war could threaten food production worldwide—a scenario known as [[nuclear famine]].&lt;ref name="agu.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fromm |first1=M. |last2=Stocks |first2=B. |last3=Servranckx |first3=R. |last4=Lindsey |first4=D. |year=2006 |title=Smoke in the Stratosphere: What Wildfires have Taught Us About Nuclear Winter |journal=[[Eos (journal)|Eos, Transactions, American Geophysical Union]] |volume=87 |issue=52 Fall Meet.

Despite a reduction in global nuclear tensions after the end of the [[Cold War]], estimated nuclear warhead stockpiles total roughly 15,000 worldwide, with the [[United States]] and [[Russia]] holding 90% of the total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nuclear Weapons: Who has what at a glance|url=https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Nuclearweaponswhohaswhat|publisher=Arms Control Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though exact details on many nuclear close calls are hard to come by, the analysis of particular cases has highlighted the importance of a variety of factors in preventing accidents. At an international level, this includes the importance of context and outside mediation; at the national level, effectiveness in government communications, and involvement of key decision-makers; and, at the individual level, the decisive role of individuals in following intuition and prudent decision-making, often in violation of protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Patricia|last2=Williams|first2=Heather|last3=Pelopidas|first3=Benoit|last4=Aghlani|first4=Sasan|title=Too Close for Comfort: Cases of Near Nuclear Use and Options for Policy|journal=Chatham House Report|date=28 April 2014|url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/field/field_document/20140428TooCloseforComfortNuclearUseLewisWilliamsPelopidasAghlani.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1950s and 1960s==
===5 November 1956===
During the [[Suez Crisis]], the [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] (NORAD) received a number of simultaneous reports, including unidentified aircraft over Turkey, Soviet [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] fighters over Syria, a downed British [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra medium bomber]], and unexpected maneuvers by the Soviet [[Black Sea Fleet]] through the [[Dardanelles]] that appeared to signal a Soviet offensive. Considering previous Soviet threats to utilize conventional weapons against France and the UK, U.S. forces believed these events could trigger a [[NATO]] nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. In fact, all reports of Soviet action turned out to be erroneous, misinterpreted, or exaggerated. The perceived threat was due to a coincidental combination of events, including a wedge of swans over Turkey, a fighter escort for the Syrian president returning from Moscow, a British bomber brought down by mechanical issues, and scheduled exercises of the Soviet fleet.&lt;ref name="nuclear files 20"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Philips|first1=Alan F.|title=20 Mishaps That Might Have Started Accidental Nuclear War|url=http://nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/issues/accidents/20-mishaps-maybe-caused-nuclear-war.htm|website=Nuclear Files|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===5 October 1960===
Radar equipment in [[Thule, Greenland]] mistakenly interpreted a moonrise over Norway as a large-scale Soviet missile launch. Upon receiving a report of the supposed attack, NORAD went on high alert. However, doubts about the authenticity of the attack arose due to the presence of Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in New York as head of the USSR's [[United Nations]] delegation.&lt;ref name="UCS close calls"&gt;{{cite web|title=Close Calls with Nuclear Weapons|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/04/Close%20Calls%20with%20Nuclear%20Weapons.pdf|website=Union of Concerned Scientists|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="K Blows Top"&gt;{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Peter |date=2009 |title=[[K Blows Top]]: A Cold War Comic Interlude Starring Nikita Khrushchev, America's Most Unlikely Tourist |url= |location= |publisher=PublicAffairs |page= |isbn=978-1-58648-497-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/us/false-alarm-missile-alerts.html|title=Causes of False Missile Alerts: The Sun, the Moon and a 46-Cent Chip|last=Stevens|first=Matt|date=2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-14|last2=Mele|first2=Christopher|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===24 November 1961===
Staff at the Strategic Air Command Headquarters (SAC HQ) simultaneously lost contact with NORAD and multiple [[Ballistic Missile Early Warning System]] sites. Since these communication lines were designed to be redundant and independent from one another, the communications failure was interpreted as either a very unlikely coincidence or a coordinated attack. SAC HQ prepared the entire ready force for takeoff before already-overhead aircraft confirmed that there did not appear to be an attack. It was later found that the failure of a single relay station in Colorado was the sole cause of the communications problem.&lt;ref name="UCS close calls"/&gt;

===27 October 1962===
{{main|Cuban Missile Crisis}}
At the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Soviet patrol submarine {{ship|Soviet submarine|B-59||2}} almost launched a nuclear-tipped [[torpedo]] while under harassment by American naval forces. One of several vessels surrounded by American [[destroyer]]s near Cuba, ''B-59'' dove to avoid detection and was unable to communicate with Moscow for a number of days.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dobbs, ''One Minute to Midnight'', Vintage, Random House, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; {{USS|Beale|DD-471|6}} began dropping practice [[depth charge]]s to signal ''B-59'' to surface, however the Soviet submarine took these to be real depth charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB75/subchron.htm |title=Chronology of Submarine Contact During the Cuban Missile Crisis |publisher=National Security Archive of the [[George Washington University]] |accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With low [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] affecting the submarine's life support systems and without orders from [[Moscow]], the commander of ''B-59'' believed that war may have already begun and ordered the use of a 10-kiloton nuclear torpedo against the American fleet. The submarine political officer agreed, but commander of the sub-flotilla [[Vasili Arkhipov]] persuaded the captain to surface and await orders.&lt;ref name="thankyou"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/27/vasili-arkhipov-stopped-nuclear-war|title = Thank you Vasili Arkhipov, the man who stopped nuclear war|newspaper = [[The Guardian]]|author = Edward Wilson|date = 2012-10-27|accessdate = 4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-8050-7688-3"&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Noam Chomsky]] |title=Hegemony or Survival: America's Quest for Global Dominance |publisher=Henry Holt |location=New York |year=2004 |isbn=0-8050-7688-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xx3ptbzQ8L4C&amp;pg=PA74 |page=74 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, an American [[U-2 spy plane]] was shot down over Cuba, and another U-2 flown by [[United States Air Force]] Captain Charles Maultsby strayed {{convert|300|mi|km}} into Soviet airspace. Despite orders to avoid Soviet airspace by at least {{convert|100|mi|km}}, a navigational error took the U-2 over the [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka Peninsula]], causing Soviet MiG interceptors to scramble and pursue the aircraft.&lt;ref name="nuclear files 20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/06/missile_crisis_excerpt200806 |title=Lost in Enemy Airspace |publisher=Vanity Fair |author=Michael Dobbs |date=June 2008 |accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; American [[F-102 Delta Dagger|F-102A]] interceptors armed with [[AIM-26 Falcon|GAR-11 Falcon]] nuclear [[air-to-air missile]]s (each with a 0.25 kiloton yield) were then scrambled to escort the U-2 into friendly airspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.x-plane.org/home/urf/aviation/text/missiles/aam.html |title=Air-to-air Missile Non-comparison Table |publisher=X-Plane |accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual pilots were capable of arming and launching their missiles.

===9 November 1965===
The Command Center of the Office of Emergency Planning went on full alert after a massive power outage in the northeastern United States. Several nuclear bomb detectors—used to distinguish between regular power outages and power outages caused by a nuclear blast—near major U.S. cities malfunctioned due to circuit errors, creating the illusion of a [[nuclear attack]].&lt;ref name="nuclear files 20"/&gt;

===23 May 1967===
A powerful [[solar flare]] accompanied by a [[coronal mass ejection]] interfered with multiple NORAD radars over the Northern Hemisphere. This interference was initially interpreted as intentional jamming of the radars by the Soviets, thus an act of war. A nuclear bomber counter-strike was nearly launched by the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wall|first1=Michael D.|title=How a 1967 Solar Storm Nearly Led to Nuclear War|url=http://www.space.com/33687-solar-storm-cold-war-false-alarm.html|website=Space.com|date=9 August 2016|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970s and 1980s==
===9 November 1979===
{{See also|Yom Kippur war|DEFCON}}
A [[computer error]] at [[NORAD]] headquarters led to alarm and full preparation for a nonexistent large-scale Soviet attack.&lt;ref name="UCS close calls"/&gt; NORAD notified national security adviser [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] that the Soviet Union had launched 250 [[ballistic missile]]s with a trajectory for the United States, stating that a decision to retaliate would need to be made by the president within 3 to 7 minutes. NORAD computers then placed the number of incoming missiles at 2,200.&lt;ref name="The 3 A.M. Phone Call"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb371/ |title=The 3 A.M.

Within six to seven minutes of the initial response, satellite and radar systems were able to confirm that the attack was a false alarm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBC Digital Archives|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/norad-false-alarm-causes-uproar|publisher=CBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was found that a training scenario was inadvertently loaded into an operational computer. Commenting on the incident, U.S. State Department adviser Marshall Shulman stated that "false alerts of this kind are not a rare occurrence. There is a complacency about handling them that disturbs me."&lt;ref name="The 3 A.M. Phone Call"/&gt; In the months following the incident there were 3 more false alarms at NORAD, 2 of them caused by faulty computer chips.&lt;ref name="UCS close calls"/&gt;

===15 March 1980===
One of four Soviet missiles launched from a submarine near the [[Kuril Islands]] was detected by an American early warning sensor and determined to be heading towards the United States.&lt;ref name="UCS close calls"/&gt;

===26 September 1983===
{{Main|1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident}}
Several weeks after the downing of [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] over Soviet airspace, a satellite early-warning system near Moscow reported the launch of one American [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman ICBM]]. Soon after, it reported that five missiles had been launched. Convinced that a real American offensive would involve many more missiles, Lieutenant Colonel [[Stanislav Petrov]] of the [[Soviet Air Defence Forces|Air Defense Forces]] refused to acknowledge the threat as legitimate and continued to convince his superiors that it was a false alarm until this could be confirmed by ground [[radar]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wash"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/coldwar/shatter021099b.htm | title=I Had A Funny Feeling in My Gut | first=David | last=Hoffman | publisher=Washington Post |date=10 February 1999 |access-date= 4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold War's Riskiest Moment |publisher=Baltimore Sun, 31 August 2003 (article reprinted as ''The Nuclear War That Almost Happened in 1983'') |url=http://hnn.us/articles/1709.html#bombs9-5-03 |first=Scott |last=Shane |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819033034/http://hnn.us/articles/1709.html |archivedate=19 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AnotherDayRT&gt;{{cite news | title = Another day the world almost ended | url = https://www.rt.com/usa/nuclear-war-stanislav-petrov/ | work = [[RT (TV network)|RT]] | date = May 19, 2010 | access-date = January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PetrovRT&gt;{{cite news | title = 'I was just doing my job': Soviet officer who averted nuclear war dies at age 77 | url = https://www.rt.com/news/403625-nuclear-soviet-officer-died/ | work = RT | date = September 17, 2017 | access-date = January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PetrovBBC&gt;{{cite news | title = Stanislav Petrov, who averted possible nuclear war, dies at 77 | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41314948 | work = [[BBC]] | date = September 18, 2017 | access-date = January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PetrovAP&gt;{{cite news | title = Stanislav Petrov, 'the man who saved the world' from nuclear war, dies at 77 | url = https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-stanislavsky-petrov-20170921-story.html | newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | agency = [[Associated Press]] | date = September 21, 2017 | access-date = January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PetrovNPR&gt;{{cite news | last = Myre | first = Greg | title = Stanislav Petrov, 'The Man Who Saved The World,' Dies At 77 | url = https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/09/18/551792129/stanislav-petrov-the-man-who-saved-the-world-dies-at-77 | work = [[npr]] | date = September 18, 2017 | access-date = January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PetrovSmithsonian&gt;{{cite work | last = Daley | first = Jason |  title = Man Who Saved the World From Nuclear Annihilation Dies at 77: In 1983, Soviet lieutenant colonel Stanislav Petrov kept his cool and reported a U.S. missile strike as a false alarm, preventing a massive counterstrike | url = https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/man-who-saved-world-nuclear-annihilation-dies-77-180964934/ | work = [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian.com]] | date = September 18, 2017 | access-date = January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, parts of the Soviet government misinterpreted the [[Able Archer 83]] NATO simulation of escalation to DEFCON 1 as a possible ruse of war to obscure preparations for a genuine nuclear first strike.&lt;ref name = "Fischer Conundrum"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-cold-war-conundrum/source.htm#HEADING1-13|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|title=A Cold War Conundrum: The 1983 Soviet War Scare|author =Benjamin B.

===25 January 1995===
{{main|Norwegian rocket incident}}
Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] became the first world leader to activate a [[nuclear briefcase]] after Russian radar systems detected the launch of a Norwegian [[Black Brant XII]] research rocket being used to study the [[Aurora|Northern Lights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/coldwar/shatter031598a.htm|title=Cold-War Doctrines Refuse to Die|first=David|last=Hoffman|publisher=Washington Post Foreign Service|date=15 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian strategic [[ballistic missile submarine]]s were put on alert in preparation for a possible retaliatory strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eucom.mil/article/23042/this-week-in-eucom-history-january-23-29-1995|title=January 25, 1995—The Norwegian Rocket Incident|publisher=United States European Command|date=23 January 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921003744/http://www.eucom.mil/article/23042/this-week-in-eucom-history-january-23-29-1995|archivedate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it became clear the rocket did not pose a threat to Russia and was not part of a larger attack, the alarm was cancelled. Russia was in fact one of a number of countries earlier informed of the launch; however, the information had not reached the Russian radar operators.&lt;ref name="UCS close calls"/&gt;

===23 October 2010===
Commanders at a [[Francis E. Warren Air Force Base|U.S. Air Force base]] in [[Wyoming]] lost most forms of command, control, and security monitoring over 50 nuclear ICBMs for approximately 45 minutes. The missiles were taken offline after a suspected hardware problem caused multiple errors with control computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/failure-shuts-down-squadron-of-nuclear-missiles/65207/ |title=Failure Shuts Down Squadron of Nuclear Missiles |last1=Ambinder |first1=Marc |date=26 October 2010 |publisher=The Atlantic |access-date=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although military officials maintain that the missiles remained under control and were not susceptible to outside attempts to gain control, former Air Force launch officer [[Bruce G.

== Incidents ==

This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. '''For natural gas alone''', the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987.

A "significant incident" results in any of the following consequences:
* fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization
* $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars
* liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel)
* releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion

PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are repurposed to carry different products.&lt;ref&gt;Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10. PHMSA Corrective Action Orders are at https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/CAO_opid_0.html. PHMSA Pipeline Failure Investigation Reports are at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/safety-reports/pipeline-failure-investigation-reports. NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

* On January 13, a pipeline leak near [[Independence, Kansas]] spilled about 135,000 gallons of petroleum product, of which about 93,000 gallons was lost. The pipeline failed from external corrosion.&lt;ref name="dot4"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 FORM 10-Q |url=https://www.magellanlp.com/uploadedFiles/Investors/Financials/2006/MMP%20-%203q06%2010q%20-%20Final%20Donnelley%20Draft.pdf |accessdate=28 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216093213/http://magellanlp.com/uploadedFiles/Investors/Financials/2006/MMP%20-%203q06%2010q%20-%20Final%20Donnelley%20Draft.pdf |archivedate=December 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On February 28, a gas compressor station explosion severely burned a worker, and set off a raging fire near [[De Beque, Colorado]]. A second explosion at that site soon after caused no injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc11news.com/home/headlines/2385406.html |title=Man Injured In Natural Gas Explosion |publisher=NBC11news.com |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028044309/http://www.nbc11news.com/home/headlines/2385406.html |archivedate=October 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Prudhoe Bay oil spill]]: On March 2, a surveillance crew discovered a crude oil spill from a [[BP]] crude pipeline near [[North Slope Borough, Alaska]]. The pipeline failure resulted in a release currently estimated at {{convert|5000|oilbbl|m3}} of processed crude oil, impacting the arctic tundra and covering approximately {{convert|2|acre|m2}} of permafrost. The pipeline's leak detection system was not effective in recognizing and identifying the failure. Failure to run [[pigging|cleaning pigs]] to remove internal corrosive build up was a factor. The failure caused crude oil price to spike throughout the World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No. 5-2006-501 5H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/520065015H/BP%205-2006-5015H%20-%20Final.pdf?nocache=9340 |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065542/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/520065015H/BP%205-2006-5015H%20-%20Final.pdf?nocache=9340 |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/business/energy/article/Pipe-corrosion-in-Alaska-takes-the-issue-off-back-1899295.php |title=Pipe corrosion in Alaska takes the issue off back burner – Houston Chronicle |publisher=Chron.com |date=August 13, 2006 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010133036/http://www.chron.com/business/energy/article/Pipe-corrosion-in-Alaska-takes-the-issue-off-back-1899295.php |archivedate=October 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 23, a pipeline failed west of [[Toledo, Ohio]], spilling about {{convert|200 |oilbbl|m3}} of unleaded gasoline. During the repair work, another smaller nearby leak was also found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corrective Action Order_03292006 |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/320065033H/320065033H_Corrective%20Action%20Order_03292006.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217225824/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/Comm/reports/enforce/documents/320065033H/320065033H_Corrective%20Action%20Order_03292006.pdf |archivedate=February 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On April 17, a [[Plantation Pipeline]] line experienced a failure in Henrico County, near [[Richmond, Virginia]]. The failure resulted in the release of 23,226 gallons of jet fuel in a residential area. The jet fuel sprayed for approximately 14 minutes and the spray traveled the distance of approximately {{convert|200|ft|m}}. The jet fuel did not ignite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF NO. 1-2006-5003-H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/120065003H/120065003H_CAO_04202006.pdf?nocache=4592 |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065757/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/120065003H/120065003H_CAO_04202006.pdf?nocache=4592 |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/272047 |title=April 17, 2006 – ProPublica |publisher= |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020210550/http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/272047 |archivedate=October 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On June 27, a [[Koch Industries]] pipeline carrying crude oil failed near the town of [[Little Falls, Minnesota]]. The pipeline operator estimated that approximately {{convert|3200 |oilbbl|m3}} of crude oil were released. The pipeline failed due to previous mechanical damage to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No. 3-2006-5037H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/320065037H/CPF_NO_3-2006-5037H.pdf?nocache=1341 |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064126/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/320065037H/CPF_NO_3-2006-5037H.pdf?nocache=1341 |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/272108 |title=June 27, 2006 – ProPublica |publisher= |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020210552/http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/272108 |archivedate=October 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On July 22, a [[Tennessee Gas Pipeline]] Company gas transmission pipeline ruptured, resulting in an estimated release of {{convert|42946000|cuft|m3|abbr=on}} of natural gas near Clay City in [[Clark County, Kentucky]]. The gas ignited, but there were no injuries, and just minor property damage. External corrosion was suspected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No. 2-2006-3 007 H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/220061007H/220061007H_Corrective%20Action%20Order_07272006.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211183405/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/Comm/Reports/enforce/documents/220061007H/220061007H_Corrective%20Action%20Order_07272006.pdf |archivedate=February 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lex18.com/news/gas-explosion-was-kentucky-s-fourth-in-last-decade#!prettyPhoto/0/ |title=Gas Explosion Was Kentucky's Fourth In Last Decade |location=Lexington, Kentucky |publisher=LEX18.com |date=January 3, 2012 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027221607/http://www.lex18.com/news/gas-explosion-was-kentucky-s-fourth-in-last-decade |archivedate=October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On July 22, 2006, near [[Campbellsville, Kentucky]], a Kinder Morgan [[Tennessee Gas Pipeline]] exploded. A 25-foot-long piece of pipe blew out of the ground and landed 200 feet away; the pipe wad twisted and mangled, its external coating burned off. The 24" pipeline ruptured due to an area of external bacterial corrosion more than two feet long at the bottom of a valley in an area of wet shale, known to cause corrosion on buried pipelines in this part of Kentucky. The pipe was manufactured in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents (1986-2001) link on the Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at www.phmsa.dot.govdata-and-statisticspipelinepipeline-incident-flagged-files.

[[File:Hapalochlaena lunulata2.JPG|thumb|Many venomous animals, such as this [[greater blue-ringed octopus]] (''Hapalochlaena lunulata''), are brightly colored or can display bright colors to warn potential [[Predation|predators]]]]

Numerous animal species naturally produce chemical toxins which are used to kill or incapacitate prey or as a defense against predators. Venomous animals deliver these toxins as [[venom]] through a [[bite]], [[stinger|sting]], or other specially evolved mechanism.

Venoms have evolved to serve a wide variety of purposes. Their intended effects can range from mild fleeting discomfort to paralysis and death, and they may be highly selective in which species they target, often making them harmless to all but a few specific [[coevolution|co-evolved]] organisms. Because the definition of "venomous" can be extremely broad, this list includes only those animals with venom that is known or suspected to be medically significant for humans or domestic animals.

==Invertebrates==
===[[Arachnid]]s===
{{further|Arachnidism|List of medically significant spider bites}}
Strictly speaking, all spiders and scorpions possess venom, though only a handful are dangerous to humans. Spiders typically deliver their venom with a bite from piercing, fang-like [[chelicerae]]; scorpions sting their victims with a long, curved [[stinger]] mounted on the [[telson]].

====Spiders====

===Other arthropods===
* Many species of [[centipede]]
* The [[Remipedia|remipede]] ''[[Xibalbanus tulumensis]]'' is a centipede-like [[crustacean]] with a long segmented body and scores of legs which display a swimming motion.

===[[Cephalopods]]===
Many species of octopus, squid, and cuttlefish make use of venom when hunting their prey.
* The [[blue-ringed octopus|blue-ringed octopodes]] (''Hapalochlaena'' spp.) produce [[tetrodotoxin]], which is extremely toxic to even the healthiest adult humans, though the number of actual fatalities they have caused is far lower than the number caused by spiders and snakes, with which human contact is more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animal.discovery.com/convergence/oceans-deadliest/deadliest-creatures/deadliest-creatures_05.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218092057/http://animal.discovery.com/convergence/oceans-deadliest/deadliest-creatures/deadliest-creatures_05.html |archivedate=18 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Venomous mammals}}
Only a few modern mammal species are capable of producing venom; they are likely the last living examples of what was once a more common trait among the mammals. The definition of "venomous" becomes less distinct here, however, and whether some species are truly venomous is still disputed.

* [[Slow loris]] (''Nycticebus'' spp.)&lt;sup&gt;[disputed]&lt;/sup&gt;

===Dinosaurs===
Some scientists have proposed that ''[[Sinornithosaurus]]'' had a venomous bite, but recent evidence suggests otherwise.&lt;ref name=venom2&gt;Gianechini, F.A., Agnolín, F.L. and Ezcurra, M.D. (2010).

[[Image:Belte inter.png|thumb|300px|The Little Belt (labelled ''Lillebælt''), the leftmost of the 3 [[Danish straits|Danish Straits]].]]

The '''Little Belt''' ({{Lang-da|Lillebælt}}) is a [[strait]] between the island of [[Funen]] and the [[Jutland Peninsula]] in [[Denmark]]. It is one of the three [[Danish straits|Danish Straits]] that drain and connect the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Kattegat]] strait, which drains west to the [[North Sea]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]].

==Geography==
[[Image:Lillebalt in the Twilight - Denmark - 03.jpeg|thumb|300px|The Little Belt [[strait]] at dusk.]]
The Little Belt is about {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|800|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|28|km|abbr=on}} wide, and its deepest point is at [[Marens Hul]] west of the island of [[Fænø]], at {{convert|81|m|abbr=on}}, which makes it deeper than its sister strait, the [[Great Belt]]. Numerous small [[List of islands of Denmark|Danish islands]] lie within the belt. In part because of its depth, 10% of the water moving between the inner Baltic Sea and the Kattegat flows through the Little Belt.

The Little Belt stretches from the town of [[Juelsminde]] in the north to the island of [[Als (island)|Als]] in the south, with a winding course in between. The northern end is the widest at over {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}}. From there it runs southwest, narrowing to about {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} at a place called ''Snævringen'' (The Narrows), where the two Little Belt Bridges are located. South of Fænø, the strait widens to about {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} until it reaches the Baltic Sea near Als and the [[South Funen Archipelago]].

The Little Belt's western coastline is largely broken up by irregular inlets called [[Förden and East Jutland Fjorde|fjords]], and both sides feature steep sand bluffs.

== Geology ==
The area around the Little Belt is shaped by numerous glacial [[moraine]]s, the first of which was formed during the [[Last glacial period|early Weichsel glaciation]] approximately 22-25,000 years ago. Approximately 14-15,000 years ago, during the late Weichsel glaciation, ice arrived from the south and southeast, one part of which became the Little Belt Glacier, causing hilly terrain with deep fjords.  The notable [[tunnel valley]]s were formed by meltwater. The terminal moraines from the northeast ice's glacial maximum are some of the oldest in Denmark.

== Nature ==

==History==

=== Prehistoric settlements ===
Human populations lived around the Little Belt during the [[Stone Age]], hunting [[aurochs]], [[reindeer]], and other game in the tunnel valleys and forests.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danskhistorie.dk/tidsperioder/jaegerstenalderen/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510092758/http://www.danskhistorie.dk/tidsperioder/jaegerstenalderen/ |date=2012-05-10 }} Retrieved 20-03-2008 (in Danish)&lt;/ref&gt; Climate and geological changes brought new plants and animals to the area and made the fishery in the fjords and neighboring archipelagoes into an important food source. Around 4000 BC, temperatures rose again, and the [[Funnelbeaker culture]] was active in the area. There are many archaeological sites from the Funnelbeaker culture and other [[Neolithic]] cultures in the area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kulturarv.dk/tjenester/publikationer/emneopdelt/arkaeologi/aud/1996kat.pdf Oversigt af arkæologiske undersøgelser i Danmark. Retrieved 15-03-2008 (in Danish)&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]], and [[Viking Age]], trade with other populations increased, and settlements became larger and more permanent. In the 14th century, the towns of [[Kolding]] and [[Vejle]] received merchant town privileges, and today they are the area's two largest towns.

===Porpoise hunting===
[[Image:Marsvinefangst Gamborg Fjord38.jpg|thumb|19th century harbour porpoise catch in [[Gamborg Fjord]]]]
From the Middle Ages until the end of the 19th century, local fishermen were also involved in [[harbour porpoise]] hunting. Harbor porpoises winter in Danish waterways, and fishermen would wait in the narrow parts of the belt and drive them to the shallows where they would be slaughtered. Porpoise oil, a type of [[whale oil]], was in widespread use as a lamp oil until the spread of electric lighting undermined the porpoise hunting economy. In the winter of 1854-55, 1,742 porpoises were captured, but otherwise, the catch from most winters was around 700-800 porpoises. Porpoise hunting was regulated by laws dating to at least 1593. The law was overturned by a royal resolution on May 4, 1899, although shortages during World War I and II caused short-lived resurgences in porpoise hunting.

===Modern era===
19th century proponents of [[Unification of Germany|German unification]] advocated considering the Little Belt ([[German language|German]]: ''Kleiner Belt'') as the northern border of Germany, and the Belt is mentioned in this context in [[Ernst Mortiz Arndt]]'s ''[[Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?]]'' (1813) and the ''[[Deutschlandlied]]'' (1841), the third stanza of which is the current German national anthem. This reflects the fact that the Denmark-Germany border has shifted several times over the centuries, so that the current Danish region of [[Southern Jutland]] was once part of the [[Duchy of Schleswig]].

The Little Belt has historically been an important shipping channel. In the present day, it is popular among divers for its archaeological sites and shipwrecks.&lt;ref name="byport"&gt;http://www.byportalen.dk/page.asp?objectid=1585&amp;zcs=350{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Byportalen.

The {{nihongo|'''Matsukawa Geothermal Power Plant'''|松川地熱発電所|Matsukawa Jinetsu Hatsudensho}} is Japan's first commercial [[geothermal power station]]. It is located in the city of  [[Hachimantai, Iwate|Hachimantai]], [[Iwate Prefecture]] in the [[Tōhoku region]] of northern Japan.

The plant is located in the [[Mount Hachimantai|Hachimantai Plateau]], in the [[Ōu Mountains]]. After seams of steam were found at the [[Matsuo mine]] in 1952, plans began to utilize this resource for the generation of electric power. The plant was completed in 1966 with a total construction cost of 2 billion yen by Japan Metals &amp; Chemicals Co., Ltd. was operated by the same company. After a corporate reorganization, the plant was turned over to Tohoku Geothermal Energy Company, a subsidiary of  [[Tohoku Electric]].  

In addition to power generation, the waste hot water is supplied to farmers with greenhouses for agricultural applications.

In 2016, the Matsukawa Georthermal Plant was certified as one of the [[Mechanical Engineering Heritage (Japan)| Mechanical Engineering Heritage sites]] of Japan by the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers (JSME).&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.jsme.or.jp/kikaiisan/data/list.html The Mechanical Engineering Heritage (Japan) list] — official website, in Japanese with English titles&lt;/ref&gt; As it marked its fiftieth year, the plant was also cited as an inspiration for new power sources following the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Japan-sees-opportunity-in-the-Earth-s-percolating-heat|title=Japan sees opportunity in the Earth's percolating heat|last=Ohira|first=Yuji|date=16 November 2016|work=Nikkei Asian Review|access-date=13 June 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant comprises one generation unit with a capacity of 23.5 MW.

In [[biology]], '''naturalisation''' (or '''naturalization''') is any process by which a [[Indigenous (ecology)|non-native]] [[organism]] or [[species]] spreads into the [[Wilderness|wild]] and its [[reproduction]] is sufficient to maintain its population.  Such populations are said to be '''naturalised'''.

Some populations do not sustain themselves reproductively, but exist because of continued influx from elsewhere. Such a non-sustaining population, or the individuals within it, are said to be [[adventive]].&lt;ref name="WHS1999"&gt;Warren L. Wagner, Derral R. Herbst, and Sy H. Sohmer. ''Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawai`i'', Revised Edition, 1999. Bishop Museum Press: Hololulu&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plant cultivation|Cultivated]] plants are a major source of adventive populations.

Naturalised species may become [[invasive species]] if they become sufficiently abundant to have an adverse effect on native plants and animals.

The '''Non-Proliferation Trust''' ('''NPT''') is a U.S. [[Not-for-profit corporation]] that, at the beginning of the 21st century, advocated storing 10,000 [[ton]]s of U.S. [[nuclear waste]] in Russia for a fee of $15 billion paid to the Russian [[government]]&lt;ref name="Palast"&gt;{{Citation | last=Palast | first=Gregory | title=To Russia with love and $15bn | newspaper=The Observer | date=29 July 2001 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2001/jul/29/columnists.theobserver| accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $250 million paid to a fund for Russian [[orphanage|orphans]]. The group was headed by [[Admiral]] [[Daniel Murphy (admiral)|Daniel Murphy]].&lt;ref name="Palast" /&gt; This proposal was endorsed by the Russian [[Nuclear power|atomic energy]] ministry, [[MinAtom]],&lt;ref name="Palast" /&gt; which estimated that the proposal could eventually generate $150 billion in revenue for Russia.

{{Further|Electricity sector in Finland|Energy in Finland}}

[[File:EPR OLK3 TVO fotomont 2 Vogelperspektive.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant]] with two existing units. The third unit and Finland's fifth (far left) is computer manipulated and will be ready by 2013.]]
Cheap and reliable energy is of exceptional importance to Finland. The energy demand is high because of its cold climate and the structure of its industry. Finland's [[hydrocarbon]] resources are limited to [[peat]] and [[wood]], while neighboring Norway has oil and [[Estonia]] [[oil shale]]. Until the 1960s, Finnish energy policy relied on the electricity produced by [[hydropower]] stations and extensive decentralised use of wood for energy. Finland's 187,888 lakes do not lie much above sea level – less than 80 metres in the case of the two biggest lakes, [[Saimaa]] and [[Päijänne]]. Consequently, Finland has less hydropower capacity than Sweden or Norway.

Finnish energy cooperative [[Teollisuuden voima]] operates four nuclear reactors that produce 18 percent of the country's energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tilastokeskus.fi/tk/yr/yeenergiakuviot_en.pdf |title=Energy Consumption in 2001 |work=Statistics Finland |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2007-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108043546/http://tilastokeskus.fi/tk/yr/yeenergiakuviot_en.pdf |archivedate=8 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also one research reactor in [[Otaniemi]] campus and [[Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant]], the fifth [[AREVA]]-[[Siemens]]-built reactor – world's largest at 1600 [[Watt#Watts electrical and thermal|MWe]] and a showcase of new technology – is currently under construction. It was supposed to be finished by 2009, but won't be finished according to the newest approximations before 2016. Finland's Kyoto and EU emission terms are causing a sharp increase in energy prices and the existing reactors are aging: there has been talk about many more reactors and the sixth is already under environmental impact assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/energywatch/nuclear/news/article_1284079.php/Finnish_energy_groups_interested_in_building_sixth_nuclear_reactor |title=Finnish energy groups interested in building sixth nuclear reactor |work=Monsters and Critics |date=2007-03-28 |accessdate=2007-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind power would be by far the cleanest energy form in Finland (the existing hydropower plants and nuclear power excluded), but because political parties - particularly the [[True Finns]] - are hesitant to grant wind power permits, most energy is produced from [[fossil fuel]]s, mainly [[coal]] and [[oil]]. About 25 percent of energy production is categorized to be [[renewable energy]], which is high compared to the EU average 10 percent. About one fifth of all the energy consumed in Finland is wood-based. Industrial residue and garbage are often utilized for energy. Many homeowners use wood as an additional (but not primary) heat source. About seven percent of electricity is produced from [[peat]] harvested from Finland's extensive [[bog]]s.

Currently, some electricity is imported to Finland. In recent years, a varying amount (5–17 percent) of power has been imported from Russia, Sweden and Norway. The Norwegian and Swedish [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plants remain an important source for imported power. The current energy policy debate is centred on self-sustainability. There are plans to build a [[HVDC Russia-Finland|submarine power cable]] from Russia, but this is also considered a [[national security]] issue. The government has already rejected one plan for such a power cable. Neste Oil operates two large [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]] for domestic and Baltic markets, refined products making 36 percent of chemical exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://report.chemind.fi/kemianteollisuuden-vienti |title=Kemianteollisuuden vienti toimialoittain |work=Chemical Industry Federation of Finland |accessdate=2007-04-26|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Norway==
{{expand section|date=April 2009}}
{{Main article|Electricity sector in Norway|Energy in Norway}}

Hydropower stands for almost 98% of the energy production in Norway. The country lacks of larger lakes that can be used as water storage magazines. However, height differences are generally very high due to the country's mountainous nature. This together with large amounts of rain- and snowfall each year makes for favourable hydropower conditions. Norway has some of the largest hydroelectric power stations in Europe, with the largest, [[Kvilldal Hydroelectric Power Station]], at 1240 MW. This is larger than the largest of Sweden, [[Harsprånget]], at 977 MW. Norway exports large amounts of its electricity production. The correlation is low between wind power in Norway and Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;Hannele Holttinen, Simo Rissanen, Xiaoli Larsen, Anne Line Løvholm. "[http://www.vtt.fi/inf/pdf/technology/2013/T96.pdf Wind and load variability in the Nordic countries]" page 20. ''[[VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland]]'', 2013. Quote: "correlation between Finland and Denmark, and Norway and Denmark is almost non-existent"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] produced in the country is mostly exported, and the small oil amounts used are mostly for vehicles.

==Sweden==
{{Main article|Electricity sector in Sweden|Energy in Sweden}}

The [[1973 oil crisis]] strengthened Sweden's commitment to decrease dependence on imported fossil fuels. Since then, [[electricity]] has been generated mostly from [[hydropower]] and nuclear power. Among other things, the accident of [[Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station]] (United States) prompted the [[Swedish parliament]] to hold a [[referendum]] on nuclear power. The referendum led to a decision that no further nuclear power plants should be built and that a [[nuclear power phase-out]] should be completed by 2010. Instead, Sweden has elected to build new reactors to replace its existing ones.&lt;ref name="BBC phase-out"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10347187 |title=Sweden to replace existing nuclear plants with new ones |date=18 June 2010 |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, out of a total electricity production of 139 [[TWh]], electricity from hydropower accounted for 61 TWh (44%), and [[nuclear power]] delivered 65 TWh (47%). At the same time, the use of [[biofuel]]s, [[peat]] etc. produced 13 TWh (9%) of electricity, while wind power produced 1 TWh (1%). Sweden was a net importer of electricity by a margin of 6 TWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.svenskenergi.se/upload/Statistik/Tidigare%20statistik/Veckostat%203%20%C3%A5r/Vecka_01-52_2007_ver_A.pdf |title=Kraftläget i Sverige, Vattensituationen |access-date=5 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225074241/http://www.svenskenergi.se/upload/Statistik/Tidigare%20statistik/Veckostat%203%20%C3%A5r/Vecka_01-52_2007_ver_A.pdf |archive-date=25 February 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biomass]] is mainly used to produce heat for [[district heating]] and [[central heating]] and industry processes.

In March 2005, an opinion poll showed that 83% supported maintaining or increasing nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf42.html |title=Nuclear Power in Sweden |publisher=World Nuclear Association |date=September 2009 |accessdate=2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then however, reports about radioactive leakages at a nuclear waste store in [[Forsmark]], Sweden, have been published,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/finance/feeds/afx/2005/06/29/afx2116521.html "Swedish nuclear power station leaks high levels of radioactive waste into Baltic" - Forbes 29 June 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; although this does not seem to have changed the public support of continued use of nuclear power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15655">'''Obsidian hydration dating''' (OHD) is a [[geochemistry|geochemical]] method of determining age in either [[Absolute dating|absolute]] or [[Relative dating|relative]] terms of an [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] made of [[obsidian]].

Obsidian is a [[volcanic]] [[glass]] that was used by prehistoric people as a raw material in the manufacture of [[stone tools]] such as projectile points, knives, or other cutting tools through knapping, or breaking off pieces in a controlled manner, such as pressure flaking.

Obsidian obeys the property of [[mineral hydration]], and absorbs [[water]], when exposed to air, at well defined rate. When an unworked nodule of obsidian is initially fractured, there is typically less than 1% water present. Over time, water slowly diffuses into the artifact forming a narrow "band," "rim," or "rind" that can be seen and measured with many different techniques such as a high-power [[microscope]] with 40-80 power [[magnification]], depth profiling with SIMS ([[secondary ion mass spectrometry]]), and IR-PAS (infra red photoacoustic spectroscopy).&lt;ref name="Investigations towards"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stevenson.C, Liritzis.I and Diakostamatiou.M |year=2002|title=Investigations towards the hydration dating of Αegean obsidian|journal=Mediterranean Archaeology &amp; Archaeometry|volume=2| issue = 1|pages=93–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Obsidian hydration dating by infrared"&gt;{{cite journal|author=C.Stevenson and S.W.Novak |year=July 2011|title=Obsidian hydration dating by infrared spectroscopy: method and calibration|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=38| issue = 7 |pages=1716–1726|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2011.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to use obsidian hydration for absolute dating, the conditions that the sample has been exposed to and its origin must be understood or compared to samples of a known age (e.g. as a result of [[radiocarbon dating]] of associated materials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advances in Obsidian Glass Studies|year=1976|isbn=978-0-8155-5050-1|author=Meighan, Clement|article="Empirical Determination of Obsidian Hydration Rates from Archaeological Evidence"|editor=R.E.

== History ==

Obsidian hydration dating was introduced in 1960 by [[Irving Friedman]] and [[Robert Smith (geologist)|Robert Smith]] of the [[U.S. Geological Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Irving|author2=Robert L. Smith|title=A New Dating Method Using Obsidian: Part I, The Development of the Method|journal=American Antiquity|year=1960|volume=25|pages=476–522}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their initial work focused on obsidians from archaeological sites in western North America.

The use of [[Secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS) in the measurement of obsidian hydration dating was introduced by two independent research teams in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liritzis|first=I.|author2=Diakostamatiou.M|title=Towards a new method of obsidian  hydration dating with secondary ion mass spectrometry via a surface saturation layer approach|journal=Mediterranean Archaeology &amp; Archaeometry|year=2002|volume=2|issue=1|pages=3–20|url=http://maajournal.com/Issues/2002/Vol02-1/Full1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riciputi|first=L. R.|author2=J. M. Elam |author3=L. M. Anovitz |author4=D. R. Cole |title=Obsidian diffusion dating by secondary ion mass spectrometry: A test using results from Mound-65, Chalco, Mexico|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|year=2002|volume=29|issue=10|pages=1055–1075|doi=10.1006/jasc.2001.0692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the technique is applied extensively by archaeologists to date prehistoric sites and sites from [[prehistory]] in [[California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meighan|first=Clement|title=Obsidian Dating in California|journal=American Antiquity|year=1983|volume=48|issue=3|pages=600–609|doi=10.2307/280567}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Great Basin]] of North America.  It has also been applied in South America, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands, including New Zealand and Mediterranean Basin.

==Techniques==

=== Conventional procedure ===
To measure the hydration band, a small slice of material is typically cut from an artifact. This sample is ground down to about 30 micrometers thick and mounted on a petrographic slide. The hydration rind is then measured under a high-power [[microscope]] outfitted with some method for measuring distance, typically in tenths of micrometers. The technician measures the [[microscopic]] amount of water absorbed on freshly broken surfaces. The principle behind obsidian hydration dating is simple&amp;ndash;the longer the artifact surface has been exposed, the thicker the hydration band will be.

=== Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) procedure ===

In case of measuring the hydration rim using the depth profiling ability of the secondary ion mass spectrometry technique, the sample is mounted on a holder without any preparation or cutting. This method of measurement is non-destructive.
There are two general SIMS modes: static mode and dynamic mode, depending on the primary ion current density, and three different types of mass spectrometers: magnetic sector, quadrupole and time-of-flight (TOF).
Any mass-spectrometer can work in static mode (very low ion current, a top mono-atomic layer analysis), and dynamic mode (a high ion current density, in-depth analysis).

Although relatively infrequent the use of SIMS on obsidian surface investigations has produced great progress in OHD dating. SIMS in general refers to four instrumental categories according to their operation; static, dynamic, quadrupole, and time-of-flight, TOF. In essence it is a technique with a large resolution on a plethora of chemical elements and molecular structures in an essentially non destructive manner. An approach to OHD with a completely new rationale suggests that refinement of the technique is possible in a manner which improves both its accuracy and precision and potentially expands the utility by generating reliable chronological data. Anovitz et al.&lt;ref name="The failure of obsidian"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anovitz|first1=L.M.|last2=Elam|first2=M.|last3=Riciputi|first3=L.|last4=Cole|first4=D.|year=1999|title=The failure of obsidian hydration dating: sources, implications, and new directions|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science |volume=26 | issue = 7|pages=735–752|doi=10.1006/jasc.1998.0342}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented a model which relied solely on compositionally-dependent diffusion, following numerical solutions (finite difference (FD), or finite element) elaborating on the H+ profile acquired by SIMS. A test of the model followed using results from Mount 65, Chalco in Mexico by Riciputi et al.&lt;ref name="Journal of Archaeological"&gt;{{cite journal|last=. Riciputi|first=L.R. |author2=M.J. Elam |author3=L.M. Anovitz |author4=D.R. Cole|year=2002|title=Journal of Archaeological Science 29 (2002) 1055–1075}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique used numerical calculation to model the formation of the entire diffusion profile as a function of time and fitted the derived curve to the hydrogen profile. The FD equations are based on a number of assumptions about the behavior of water as it diffused into the glass and characteristic points of the SIMS H+ diffusion profile.

In Rhodes, Greece, under the direction and invention of Ioannis Liritzis,&lt;ref name="SIMS1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rhodes.aegean.gr/tms/sims-ss/ |title=SIMS-SS Home Page |publisher=Rhodes.aegean.gr |accessdate=2014-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111115328/http://www.rhodes.aegean.gr/tms/sims-ss/ |archivedate=2014-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
the dating approach is based on modeling the S-like hydrogen profile by SIMS, following Fick's diffusion law, and an understanding of the surface saturation layer (see Figure). In fact, the saturation layer on the surface forms up to a certain depth depending on factors that include the kinetics of the diffusion mechanism for the water molecules, the specific chemical structure of obsidian, as well as the external conditions affecting diffusion (temperature, relative humidity, and pressure).&lt;ref name="Introduction to Chemical"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=J.M.|author2=Smith, H.C. Van Hess|year=1987|title=Introduction to Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics, 4th ed. McGraw-Hill, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together these factors result in the formation of an approximately constant, boundary concentration value, in the external surface layer. Using the end product of diffusion, a phenomenological model has been developed, based on certain initial and boundary conditions and appropriate physicochemical mechanisms, that express the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O concentration versus depth profile as a diffusion/time equation.

This latest advance, the novel secondary ion mass spectrometry–surface saturation (SIMS-SS), thus, involves modelling the hydrogen concentration profile of the surface versus depth, whereas the age determination is reached via equations describing the diffusion process, while topographical effects have been confirmed and monitored through [[atomic force microscopy]].&lt;ref name="New evidence of Cycladic"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liritzis|first=I.|year=2010|title=Strofilas (Andros Island, Greece): New evidence of Cycladic Final Neolithic dated by novel luminescence and Obsidian Hydration methods|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=37|pages=1367–1377|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2009.12.041}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Obsidian hydration dating by SIMS"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liritzis|first=I.|author2=Bonini.M and Laskaris.N |year=2008|title=Obsidian hydration dating by SIMS-SS: surface suitability criteria from atomic force microscopy|journal=Surface &amp; Interface Analysis|volume=40|pages=458–463|doi=10.1002/sia.2672}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fifty years of obsidian"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Liritzis, I  |author2=Laskaris, N |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2011|title=Fifty years of obsidian hydration dating in archaeology|journal=J.

== Limitations ==

Several factors complicate simple correlation of obsidian hydration band thickness with absolute age. [[Temperature]] is known to speed up the hydration process.  Thus, artifacts exposed to higher temperatures, for example by being at lower [[elevation]], seem to hydrate faster. As well, obsidian chemistry, including the intrinsic water content, seems to affect the rate of hydration.  Once an [[archeologist]] can control for the [[geochemical]] signature of the obsidian (e.g., the "source") and temperature (usually approximated using an "effective hydration temperature" or EHT coefficient), he or she may be able to date the artifact using the obsidian hydration technique. [[Water vapor]] pressure may also affect the rate of obsidian hydration.&lt;ref name="The failure of obsidian"/&gt;

The reliability of the method based on Friedman’s empirical age equation (''x²=kt'', where ''x'' is the thickness of the hydration rim, ''k'' is the diffusion coefficient, and ''t'' is the time) is questioned from several grounds regarding temperature dependence, square root of time and determination of diffusion rate per sample and per site, apart of some successful attempts on the procedure and applications.The SIMS-SS age calculation procedure is separated into two major steps. The first step concerns the calculation of a 3rd order fitting polynomial of the SIMS profile (eq.1). The second stage regards the determination of the saturation layer, i.e. its depth and concentration. The whole computing processing is embedded in stand-alone software created in Matlab (version 7.0.1) software package with a graphical user interface and executable under Windows XP. Thus, the SIMS-SS age equation in years before present is given in eq.2:

&lt;math&gt;c=e^{a+bx+cx^2+dx^3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''Eq.1'''Fitting polynomial of the SIMS profile

&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{(C_1-C_2)^2\left(\frac{1.128}{1-\frac{0.177kC_1}{C_2}}\right)^2}{4Dse\!f\!\!f\left(\left.\frac{\mathrm dC}{\mathrm dx}\right|_{x=0}\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;'''Eq.2'''     The SIMS-SS age equation in years before present

Where, Ci is the intrinsic concentration of water, Cs is the saturation concentration, dC/dx is the diffusion coefficient for depth x=0, k is derived from a family of Crank’s theoretical diffusion curves, and Ds,eff is an effective diffusion coefficient (eq.3) which relates the inverse gradient of the fit polynomial to well dated samples:

:'''D&lt;sub&gt;s,eff&lt;/sub&gt; = aD&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; + b/ (10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) = 8.051e&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;+0.999/(1022D&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;), 	'''Eq.3''' 
:'''

where Ds = (1/(dC/dx))10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;  assuming a constant flux and taken as unity. The eq.(2) and assumption of unity is a matter of further investigation.&lt;ref name="SIMS2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhodes.aegean.gr/tms/sims-ss/|title=www.rhodes.aegean.gr/tms/sims-ss|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111115328/http://www.rhodes.aegean.gr/tms/sims-ss/|archivedate=2014-01-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several commercial companies and university laboratories provide obsidian hydration services.

The '''Pannonian Sea''' was a shallow ancient sea located where the [[Pannonian Basin]] in [[Central Europe]] is now. The Pannonian Sea existed during the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] epochs, when a three to four kilometre depth of marine sediments were deposited in the Pannonian Basin.

==History==
The Pannonian Sea, for most of its history, was part of the [[Paratethys Sea]]. A Miocene uplift of the Carpathian Mountains isolated the sea from the rest of Paratethys (about 10 million years ago). 

During its first historical phase, the Pannonian Sea had a western connection with the [[Mediterranean Sea]] through the territories of the modern [[Ligurian Sea]], [[Bavaria]], and [[Vienna Basin]]. Through the [[Đerdap]] Strait, the Pannonian Sea was linked to the Paratethys in the [[Wallachia]]n-[[Black Sea|Pontic]] Basin. The Pannonian Sea was also attached to the [[Aegean Sea]] through the modern [[Preševo Valley]].

Due to its diverse history the salinity of the sea often shifted. The decrease of salinity resulted an endemic fauna. 

The Pannonian Sea existed for about 9 million years. Eventually, the sea lost its connection to the Paratethys and became a lake permanently (''Pannonian Lake''). Its last remnant, the [[Slavonian Lake]],  dried up in the [[Pleistocene]] epoch. The remnants of the former islands of the Pannonian Sea are the modern [[Pannonian island mountains]] ([[Mecsek]], [[Papuk]], [[Psunj]], [[Krndija]], [[Dilj]], [[Fruška Gora]], and [[Vršac Mountains]]).

==In popular culture==
In 1979, the Serbian musician [[Đorđe Balašević]] released a single titled ''{{lang|sr|[[Panonski Mornar]]}}'' (Pannonian sailor).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12050">'''Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems''' ('''POLES''') is a world simulation model for the [[Energy economics|energy sector]] that runs on the Vensim software. It is a techno-economic model with endogenous projection of energy prices, a complete accounting of energy demand and supply of numerous energy vectors and associated technologies, and a carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emissions module.

== History ==

POLES was initially developed in the early 1990s in the Institute of Energy Policy and Economics IEPE (now EDDEN-CNRS) in [[Grenoble]], France. It was conceived on the basis of research issues related to global energy supply and [[climate change]] and the long-term impact of [[Energy policy|energy policies]]. It was initially developed through a detailed description of sectoral energy demand, electricity capacity planning and fossil fuel exploration and production in the different world regions. Along its development it incorporated theoretical and practical expertise in many fields such as mathematics, economics, engineering, energy analysis, international trade and technical change.

The initial development of POLES was financed by the JOULE II and III programmes of the [[European Commission]]’s Third and Fourth [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|Framework Programmes (FP) for Research and Technological Development]] (1990-1994 and 1994-1998) as well as by the French CNRS. Since then, the model has been developed extensively through several projects, some partly financed by FP5, FP6 and FP7, and in collaboration between the EDDEN-CNRS, the consulting company Enerdata and the European [[Joint Research Centre (European Commission)|Joint Research Centre]] [[Institute for Prospective Technological Studies|IPTS]].

With a history spanning twenty years, it is one of the few energy models worldwide that benefits from a continuous development process and expertise over such an extended time period.

== Structure ==

The model provides a complete system for the simulation and economic analysis of the world’s energy sector up to 2050. POLES is a partial equilibrium model with a yearly recursive simulation process with a combination of price-induced behavioural equations and a cost- and performance-based system for a large number of energy or energy-related technologies. Contrary to several other energy sector models, international energy prices are endogenous. The main exogenous variables are the gross domestic product and population for each country or region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lepii.upmf-grenoble.fr/IMG/pdf/LEPII-Enerdata.pdf Energy Scenarios, Technology Development and Climate Policy Analysis with the POLES Modelling System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819233946/http://lepii.upmf-grenoble.fr/IMG/pdf/LEPII-Enerdata.pdf |date=2011-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model’s structure corresponds to a system of interconnected modules and articulates three levels of analysis: international energy markets, regional energy balances, and national energy demand (which includes new technologies, electricity production, primary energy production systems and sectoral greenhouse gas emissions).

POLES breaks down the world into 66 regions, of which 54 correspond to countries (including the 28 countries of the European Union) and 12 correspond to countries aggregates; for each of these regions, a full energy balance is modelled. The model covers 15 energy demand sectors in each region.

=== Demand sectors ===

Each demand sector is described with a high degree of detail, including activity indicators, short- and long-term energy prices and associated elasticities and technological evolution trends (thus including the dynamic cumulative processes associated with technological learning curves). This allows a strong economic consistency in the adjustment of supply and demand by region, as relative price changes at a sectoral level impact all key component of a region’s sector. Sectoral value added is simulated.

Energy demand for each fuel in a sector follows a market share-based competition driven by energy prices and factors related to policy or development assumptions.

The model is composed of the following demand sectors:

* '''Residential and Tertiary''': two sectors.
* '''Industry''':
** Energy uses in industry: four sectors, allowing for a detailed modelling of such energy-intensive industries such as the steel industry, the chemicals industry and the non-metallic minerals industry (cement, glass).
** Non-energy uses in industry: two sectors, for the transformation sectors such as plastics production and chemical feedstock production.
* '''Transport''': four sectors (air, rail, road and other). Road transport modelling comprises several vehicle types (passenger cars, merchandise heavy trucks) and allows the study of inter-technology competition with the penetration of alternative vehicles (hybrids, electric or fuel cell vehicles).
* '''International bunkers''': two sectors.
* '''Agriculture''': one sector.

=== Oil and gas supply ===

There are 88 oil and gas production regions with inter-regional trade; these producing regions supply the international energy markets, which in turn feed the demand of the 66 aforementioned world regions. Fossil fuel supply modelisation includes a technological improvement in the oil recovery rate, a linkage between new discoveries and cumulative drilling and a feedback of the reserves/production ratio on the oil price. OPEC and non-OPEC production is differentiated. The model includes non-conventional oil resources such as [[oil shales]] and [[tar sands]].

=== Power Generation ===

There are 30 electricity generation technologies, among which several technologies that are still marginal or planned, such as thermal production with [[carbon capture and storage]] or [[Generation IV reactor|new nuclear designs]]. Price-induced diffusion tools such as [[feed-in tariff]]s can be included as drivers for projecting the future development of new energy technologies. 

The model distinguishes four typical daily [[load curve]]s in a year, with two-hour steps. The load curves are met by a generation mix given by a merit order that is based on marginal costs of operation, maintenance and annualized capital costs. Expected power demand over the year influences investment decisions for new capacity planning in the next step.

=== Emissions and carbon price ===

The model includes accounting of [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions and allows visualising GHG flows on sectoral, regional and global levels. POLES covers fuel combustion-related emissions in all demand sectors, thus covering over half of global GHG emissions. The six [[Kyoto Protocol]] GHGs are covered (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulphur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons).

The model can be used to test the sensibility of the energy sector to the [[carbon price]] as applied to the price of fossil fuels on a regional level, as envisaged or experimented by [[cap and trade]] systems like the EU’s [[Emissions Trading Scheme]].

=== Databases ===

The model’s databases have been developed by IPTS, EDDEN and Enerdata. Data on technological costs and performances were provided by the TECHPOL database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feem.it/userfiles/attach/200911914381252009.02.18_patrick_criqui_presentation.pdf Emissions Constraints and Induced Technical Change in the Energy Sector: simulations with the POLES model]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Techpol, un observatoire des nouvelles technologies de l'énergie'', Menanteau, P., in ''Lettre Techniques de l'Ingénieur - Energies, 2 (2006) 5-6''&lt;/ref&gt; The data for historical energy demand, consumption and prices are compiled and provided by Enerdata.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eie.gov.tr/turkce/en_tasarrufu/uetm/twinning/sunular/hafta_02/5_POLES_description.pdf POLES description]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

The POLES model can be used to study or test the effect of different energy resources assumptions or energy policies and assess the importance of various driving variables behind energy demand and the penetration rates of certain electricity generation or end-use technologies. POLES does not directly provide the macro-economic impact of mitigation solutions as envisaged by the [[Stern Review]], however it allows a detailed assessment of the costs associated with the development of low- or [[Low-carbon economy|zero-carbon]] technologies.

Linked with GHG emissions profiles, the model can produce [[Marginal Abatement Cost Curve|marginal abatement cost curves]] (MACCs) for each region and sector at a desired time; these can be used to quantify the costs related to GHG emissions reduction or as an analysis tool for strategic areas for emissions control policies and emissions trading systems under different market configurations and trading rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.jrc.ec.europa.eu/Pages/Activities.htm#POLES Uses at IPTS]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecomod.net/conferences/ecomod2005/ecomod2005_papers/Ciscar.pdf Coupling with the GEM-E3 model] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001165449/http://www.ecomod.net/conferences/ecomod2005/ecomod2005_papers/Ciscar.pdf |date=2006-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies including POLES simulations have been commissioned by international bodies such as several Directorates-General of the European Commission,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/pdf/pm_summary2025.pdf Greenhouse gas reduction pathways in the UNFCCC process up to 2025] - study for DG ENV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/pdf/weto-h2_en.pdf World Energy Technology Outlook 2050] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715051644/http://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/pdf/weto-h2_en.pdf |date=2010-07-15 }} - study for DG RTD&lt;/ref&gt; national energy, environment, industry and transport agencies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/scenario-facteur4-2050.pdf Facteur 4] - study for the French ministry of finance and industry&lt;/ref&gt; or private actors in the energy sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecofys.com/com/publications/brochures_newsletters/documents/Sharing_developed_countries_reduction_targets.pdf Sharing developed countries’ post-2012 greenhouse gas emission reductions based on comparable efforts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710165803/http://www.ecofys.com/com/publications/brochures_newsletters/documents/Sharing_developed_countries_reduction_targets.pdf |date=2011-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

POLES can model changes in sectoral value added and shifts of activity between sectors. However POLES is not a macroeconomic model in the sense that it uses the [[gross domestic product]] as an input and includes no feedback on it that could result from the evolution of the energy system: carbon pricing, falling oil production and its effect on transport and mobility, or growth induced by technological innovation (such as the IT boom of the 1990s). As such, it does not provide the total impact on society of, e.g., climate adaptation or mitigation (it does however quantify the total cost to the energy sector, including investment necessary in the development of low-carbon technologies).

The model does not cover all greenhouse gases emissions, notably those related to agriculture (in part), [[land use, land-use change and forestry]]. As such, the climate component of the model does not allow to fully project GHG stocks, concentrations and associated temperature rises from [[anthropogenic climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC50307.pdf Economic Assessment of Post-2012 Global Climate Policies using POLES and GEM-E3]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rattan Cane (5661053551).jpg|thumbnail|300px|A rattan cane.]]

'''Rattan''' (from the [[Malay language|Malay]] ''rotan'') is the name for roughly 600 [[species]] of [[old world]] [[climbing palm]]s belonging to subfamily [[Calamoideae]] (from the Greek 'kálamos' = [[Reed (plant)|reed]]).&lt;ref name="Dransfield general" /&gt; Rattan is also known as ''manila'', or ''malacca'', named after the ports of shipment [[Manila]] and [[Malacca City]], and as ''manau'' (from the Malay ''rotan manau'', the trade name for ''Calamus manan'' canes in Southeast Asia).&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Dennis V. (2004): ''Rattan Glossary: And Compendium Glossary with Emphasis on Africa''. Rome: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The climbing habit is associated with the characteristics of its flexible woody stem, derived typically from a secondary growth, makes rattan a [[liana]] rather than a true [[wood]].

==Taxonomy==

Calamoideae also includes tree palms such as Raphia (''[[Raffia]]'') and ''[[Metroxylon]]'' (Sago palm) and shrub palms such as ''[[Salacca]]'' (Salak) (Uhl &amp; Dransfield 1987 ''Genera Palmarum'').&lt;ref name="Dransfield general" /&gt; The climbing habit in palms is not restricted to Calamoideae, but has also evolved in three other evolutionary lines—tribes Cocoseae (''[[Desmoncus]]'' with c. 7–10 species in the New World tropics) and Areceae (''[[Dypsis scandens]]'' in Madagascar) in subfamily Arecoideae, and tribe Hyophorbeae (climbing species of the large genus ''[[Chamaedorea]]'' in Central America) in subfamily Ceroxyloideae.&lt;ref name="species" /&gt; They do not have spinose stems and climb by means of their reflexed terminal leaflets.&lt;ref name="species" /&gt; Of these only ''Desmoncus'' spp. furnish stems of sufficiently good quality to be used as rattan cane substitutes.&lt;ref name="species" /&gt;

There are 13 different genera of rattans that include around 600 species.&lt;ref name="species" /&gt; Some of the species in these "rattan genera" have a different habit and do not climb, they are shrubby palms of the forest undergrowth; nevertheless they are close relatives to species that are climbers and they are hence included in the same genera.&lt;ref name="Dransfield general" /&gt;&lt;ref name="species" /&gt; The largest rattan genus is ''[[Calamus (palm)|Calamus]]'', distributed in Asia except for one species represented in Africa.&lt;ref name="species" /&gt; From the remaining rattan genera, ''[[Daemonorops]], [[Ceratolobus]], [[Korthalsia]], [[Plectocomia]], [[Plectocomiopsis]], [[Myrialepis]], [[Calospatha]], [[Pogonotium]]'' and ''[[Retispatha]]'', are centered in Southeast Asia with outliers eastwards and northwards;&lt;ref name="species"&gt;Terry C.H. Sunderland and John Dransfield. Species Profiles. Ratans. http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/y2783e/y2783e05.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and three are endemic to Africa: ''[[Laccosperma]]'' (syn. ''Ancistrophyllum''), ''[[Eremospatha]]'' and ''[[Oncocalamus]]''.&lt;ref name="species" /&gt;

== Structure ==
Most rattans differ from other palms in having slender stems, 2–5&amp;nbsp;cm diameter, with long [[plant stem|internode]]s between the [[leaf|leaves]]; also, they are not [[tree]]s but are vine-like [[liana]]s, scrambling through and over other vegetation. Rattans are also superficially similar to [[bamboo]]. Unlike bamboo, rattan stems ("malacca") are solid, and most species need structural support and cannot stand on their own. Many rattans have [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spines]] which act as hooks to aid climbing over other plants, and to deter [[herbivore]]s. Rattans have been known to grow up to hundreds of metres long. Most (70%) of the world's rattan population exist in [[Indonesia]], distributed among the islands [[Borneo]], [[Sulawesi]], and [[Sumbawa]]. The rest of the world's supply comes from the [[Philippines]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Bangladesh]].

== Economic and environmental issues ==
In forests where rattan grows, its economic value can help protect forest land, by providing an alternative to loggers who forgo timber logging and harvest rattan canes instead. Rattan is much easier to harvest, requires simpler tools and is much easier to transport. It also grows much faster than most tropical wood. This makes it a potential tool in forest maintenance, since it provides a profitable crop that depends on rather than replaces trees. It remains to be seen whether rattan can be as profitable or useful as the alternatives.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Rattans are threatened with overexploitation, as harvesters are cutting stems too young and reducing their ability to resprout.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, K. (1998) Sustainable use as a conservation tool in the forests of South-East Asia. Conservation of Biological Resources (E.J. Milner Gulland &amp; R Mace, eds), pp 174–192. Blackwell Science, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Unsustainable harvesting of rattan can lead to [[forest degradation]], affecting overall forest [[ecosystem services]]. Processing can also be polluting. The use of toxic chemicals and petrol in the processing of rattan affects soil, air and water resources, and also ultimately people's health. Meanwhile, the conventional method of rattan production is threatening the plant's long-term supply, and the income of workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= WWF Rattan Switch project |url= http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/where_we_work/greatermekong/our_solutions/sustainablerattan/benefits/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100803194026/http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/where_we_work/greatermekong/our_solutions/sustainablerattan/benefits/ |archivedate= 3 August 2010 |publisher= WWF |date=July 2010 |accessdate=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
=== Furniture making ===
[[File:066a Josepinism Style Furniture.jpg|thumb|Chair, [[Josephinism]] style, typical Viennese, around 1780. The seat and back wickerwork panels are woven of rattan, while the frame is hardwood.]]
Rattans are extensively used for making baskets and [[furniture]]. When cut into sections, rattan can be used as wood to make furniture. Rattan accepts [[paint]]s and [[stain]]s like many other kinds of wood, so it is available in many colours, and it can be worked into many styles. Moreover, the inner core can be separated and worked into [[wicker]].

Generally, raw rattan is processed into several products to be used as materials in furniture making. The various species of rattan range from several millimetres up to 5–7&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. From a strand of rattan, the skin is usually peeled off, to be used as rattan weaving material. The remaining "core" of the rattan can be used for various purposes in furniture making. Rattan is a very good material, mainly because it is lightweight, durable, suitable for outdoor use, and, to a certain extent, flexible.

===Clothing===
Traditionally, the women of the [[Wemale people|Wemale]] ethnic group of [[Seram Island]], [[Indonesia]] wore rattan [[girdle]]s around their waist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Piper, Jaqueline M. |title=Bamboo and rattan, traditional uses and beliefs|publisher= Oxford University Press|date= 1995|isbn= 978-0195889987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporal punishment ===
Thin rattan canes were the standard implement for [[school corporal punishment]] in England and Wales, and are still used for this purpose in schools in Malaysia, Singapore, and several African countries. Similar canes are used for military punishments in the [[Singapore Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="counsga"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corpun.com/counsga.htm|title= Singapore: Caning in the military forces|website= World Corporal Punishment Research}} (Includes a photograph of a military caning in progress)&lt;/ref&gt; Heavier canes, also of rattan, are used for [[judicial corporal punishment]]s, called "caning", in [[Aceh]], [[Caning in Brunei|Brunei]], [[Caning in Malaysia|Malaysia]], and [[Caning in Singapore|Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corpun.com/singfeat.htm |title=Judicial caning in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei|website= World Corporal Punishment Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food source ===
Some rattan fruits are edible, with a sour taste akin to citrus. The [[fruit]] of some rattans exudes a red [[resin]] called [[dragon's blood]]; this resin was thought to have medicinal properties in antiquity and was used as a dye for [[violin]]s, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/rattan.aspx |title=Rattan|website=Encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resin normally results in a wood with a light peach hue. In the Indian state of [[Assam]], the shoot is also used as vegetable.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

=== Medicinal potential ===
In early 2010, scientists in Italy announced that rattan wood would be used in a new "wood to bone" process for the production of [[artificial bone]]. The process takes small pieces of rattan and places it in a furnace. [[Calcium]] and [[carbon]] are added. The wood is then further heated under intense pressure in another oven-like machine, and a phosphate solution is introduced. This process produces almost an exact replica of bone material. The process takes about 10 days. At the time of the announcement the bone was being tested in sheep, and there had been no signs of rejection. Particles from the sheep's bodies have migrated to the "wood bone" and formed long, continuous bones. The new bone-from-wood programme is being funded by the [[European Union]]. Implants into humans were anticipated to start in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8446637.stm | work=BBC News |title=Turning wood into bones |date=8 January 2010 |access-date=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wicks ===
Rattan is the preferred natural material used to wick [[essential oil]]s in aroma reed diffusers (commonly used in [[aromatherapy]], or merely to scent closets, passageways, and rooms), because each rattan reed contains 20 or more permeable channels that [[Capillary action|wick]] the oil from the container up the stem and release fragrance into the air, through an evaporation diffusion process. In contrast, reeds made from bamboo contain nodes that inhibit the passage of essential oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=The Diffusery|url=http://www.thediffusery.com/faqs.htm#Q3|title=FAQS: Questions: Question 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Avotion|url=http://avotion.com/faqs.htm#Q2|title=FAQS: Questions: Question 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reeddiffusershop.com/how-to-choose-the-best-diffuser-reeds/|website=Reed Diffuser Guide|title=How To Choose The Best Diffuser Reeds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Handicraft and arts ===
Many of the properties of rattan that make it suitable for furniture also make it a popular choice for handicraft and art pieces. Uses include rattan baskets, plant containers, and other decorative works.

Due to its durability and resistance to splintering, sections of rattan can be used as [[Walking stick|canes]], crooks for high-end [[umbrella]]s, or [[Stick-fighting|staves]] for [[martial arts]].  Rattan sticks 70&amp;nbsp;cm long, called ''[[Baston (weapon)|baston]]'', are used in [[Filipino martial arts]], especially [[Arnis|Arnis/Eskrima/Kali]] and for the striking weapons in the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]]'s [[Contact sport#Grades|full-contact]] "[[SCA armoured combat|armoured combat]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sca.org/officers/chatelain/sca-intro.html |title=What is the SCA? |website=Society for Creative Anachronism, Inc |quote=Since we prefer that no one gets hurt, SCA combatants wear real armor and use rattan swords. |access-date=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Marshals' Handbook |url=http://www.sca.org/officers/marshal/docs/marshal_handbook.pdf |publisher= Society for Creative Anachronism |date=March 2007 |edition=March 2007 revision |access-date=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[birch]] and bamboo, rattan is a common material used for the handles in percussion mallets, especially mallets for [[Percussion instrument|keyboard percussion]], ''e.g.'', [[marimba]], [[vibraphone]], [[xylophone]], etc.

=== Shelter material ===
Most natives or locals from the rattan rich countries{{where|date=June 2017}} employ the aid of this sturdy plant in their home building projects. It is heavily used as a housing material in rural areas. The skin of the plant or wood is primarily used for weaving.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Sports equipment===
Rattan cane is also used traditionally to make polo mallets, though only a small portion of cane harvested (roughly 3%) is strong, flexible, and durable enough to be made into sticks for polo mallets, and popularity of rattan mallets is waning next the more modern variant, fibrecanes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Hoser has published several works as a [[whistleblower]]. In a 1998 radio interview he said that he was "known as an anti-corruption crusader".&lt;ref name="bolton"/&gt; An analysis of his work by the [[Rationalist Society of Australia]] referred to him as a "tireless investigator"&lt;ref name=strange/&gt; and he has received praise from [[Brian Martin (social scientist)|Brian Martin]], a former president of [[Whistleblowers Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423185728/http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/Martin_def.html|archivedate= 23 April 2009| first = Brian| last= Martin|url = http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/Martin_def.html | title=Defamation and the Australian media: a case study| date= October 1997|accessdate =1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1993 book ''Smuggled'', Hoser wrote that officials of the wildlife services in [[New South Wales]] were involved in the illegal [[wildlife trade]].&lt;ref name=strange&gt;{{cite web| first = H.

In 2009, Hoser started his own journal, the ''Australasian Journal of Herpetology'', for which he is editor and, as of August 2014, the sole contributing author of all 24 issues containing 102 papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smuggled.com/AJHIP1.htm |title=Australasian Journal of Herpetology |publisher=Smuggled.com |date= |accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The taxon count for issues 1–24 (years 2009–2014) of the ''Australasian Journal of Herpetology'' is 752 taxa, i.e. two superfamilies, nine families, 11 subfamilies, 119 tribes, 55 subtribes, 198 genera, 183 subgenera, 96 species, and 79 subspecies.

In 2012, Hoser received criticism from several crocodile zoologists after he named what he claimed to be new species of pygmy [[freshwater crocodile]], based on a single population discovered in 1979 in the upper [[Liverpool River]] in [[Arnhem Land]] in the [[Northern Territory]] of Australia by noted zoologist and current [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] Crocodile Specialist Group Chair Grahame Webb.&lt;ref name="ntnews.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|author=Alison Bevege |url=http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2012/07/26/312001_ntnews.html |title=Boffins big blue over little croc &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; NT News &amp;#124; Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia |publisher=ntnews.com.au |date=2012-07-26 |accessdate=2014-04-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130627222256/http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2012/07/26/312001_ntnews.html |archivedate=27 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://portals.iucn.org/blog/2012/07/23/conservingcrocodilesariskybusiness/ |title=IUCN International - Conserving crocodiles – a risky business! |publisher=Portals.iucn.org |date=2012-07-23 |accessdate=2013-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130704032006/https://portals.iucn.org/blog/2012/07/23/conservingcrocodilesariskybusiness/ |archivedate=4 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Webb argued that the crocodiles were a merely clinal variation of the [[freshwater crocodile|Johnston crocodile]] which is stunted in size because of lack of food in the area, and not a new species.&lt;ref name="ntnews.com.au"/&gt; Crocodile geneticist Sally Isberg stated that Hoser had not presented the required molecular genetic data to prove that a new species exists and claimed that Hoser's journal is not peer-reviewed.&lt;ref name="ntnews.com.au"/&gt; However, molecular genetic evidence is [http://iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp not a requirement] for the naming of new species.

In 2013, a group of international herpetologists published a paper in the ''Herpetological Review'', a peer-reviewed publication of the [[Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles]]. The paper, which included the names of over 60 of the world's academic herpetologists as supporters, and many of the major societies including the World Congress of Herpetology, set out to put a stop to the "taxonomic vandalism" of Hoser and another self-publishing herpetologist, Richard Wells. It dismissed as unscientific, and lacking in evidence, scientific rigor, or credibility, the huge number of names coined by Hoser since 2000, mostly in his self-published, self-edited, single-authored ''Australasian Journal of Herpetology'', and provided authors with the original or alternative, more acceptable, names. The paper also dealt with a smaller number of names coined by Wells.&lt;ref name=Kaiser&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markoshea.info/downloads/Kaiser-et-al-2013.pdf|title=Best Practices: In the 21st Century, Taxonomic Decisions in Herpetology are Acceptable Only When Supported by a Body of Evidence and Published via Peer-Review. |author= Kaiser, H., B.I.

In June 2013, ''[[Scientific American]]'' author Darren Naish published a concise account of the situation in his Tetrapod Zoology blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/2013/06/20/taxonomic-vandalism-and-raymond-hoser//|title=Taxonomic vandalism and the Raymond Hoser problem|publisher= |work=Scientific American |date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the British Herpetological Society and the Netherlands Association for Herpetoculture adopted resolutions censuring Hoser for naming reptiles without scientific evidence or peer review and what they deemed as "vanity publishing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.territorystories.nt.gov.au/bitstream/handle/10070/245440/ntn22may13002x.pdf?sequence=2 |title=Snake fans vent at vain wife name |publisher=Aap.newscentre.com.au |date=2013-05-22 |accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editor of the Herpetological Association of Africa published an online editorial which stated that the ''African Journal of Herpetology'' would not use any names listed in Table 1 of Kaiser ''et al.'' 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanherpetology.org/taxonomy.php/|title=Taxonomic Vandalism|publisher=africanherpetology.org/taxonomy.php |accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently,{{when|date=September 2017}} there have been several papers published by groups of herpetologists, that over-write or ignore Hoser's names. Most notable are Reynolds ''et al.'' 2013,&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;{{cite journal|title=Toward a Tree-of-Life for the boas and pythons: Multilocus species-level phylogeny with unprecedented taxon sampling. |author= Reynolds, R.G., M.

Hoser's response includes calling the journals (respectively ''[[Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution]]'' and ''[[Zootaxa]]'') PRINO (peer-reviewed in name only), a term he coined himself for rival journals. Both these decisions are controversial at present and the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]] may be called to adjudicate on which nomenclature should be adopted. The dispute has also been picked up by mainstream media, including the [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]].&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Benjamin|title=A Few Bad Scientists Are Threatening to Topple Tadonomy|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-big-ugly-problem-heart-of-taxonomy-180964629/|website=Smithsonian|accessdate=10 September 2017|language=en|date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an increase in snakebites, Hoser criticized the zookeeper, conservationist and television personality [[Steve Irwin]] to ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper (of [[Melbourne]], Australia), saying that Irwin had "given many people false ideas about how to behave around snakes".&lt;ref name="theage.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/snake-bites-up-as-warm-weather-brings-reptiles-and-people-together/2007/01/31/1169919403529.html|title=Snake bites up as warm weather brings reptiles and people together|publisher= |work=The Age|date=31 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoser said, "The way he handled snakes on TV was not the right way to do it. Some people don't seem to understand that if you play with deadly animals, you may end up dead."&lt;ref name="theage.com.au"/&gt;

A 2008 government tribunal ruled that Hoser's venomoid snakes cannot be handled by members of the public, due to the risk of the venom glands regrowing.

==Legal proceedings==
In 2001, the [[Victorian Supreme Court]] used the offence of ''scandalising the court'' to fine Hoser $5,000 after he published names of two county court judges and two magistrates in a book entitled ''Victoria Police Corruption'' with allegations of bias and improper conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Scandalous behaviour; Police under pressure; Starbucks Australia | url = http://www.abc.net.au/rn/nationalinterest/stories/2001/441523.htm | publisher = ABC Radio National | date = 16 December 2001 | accessdate = 1 July 2011 }}&lt;br&gt;- ''[http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=28394&amp;sectioncode=1 "Scandalising the Court"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616100651/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=28394&amp;sectioncode=1 |date=16 June 2011 }}, ''Press Gazette'', 10 October 2003.

In 2011, Hoser was convicted and fined $12,000 in the County Court for demonstrating with venomous snakes less than three metres from the public, working in accessible pits and demonstrating in a way that put the animals at risk of theft. Hoser allowed his 10-year-old daughter to be bitten five times by venomoid specimens of two species of highly venomous snakes, an [[inland taipan]] and a [[Acanthophis|common death adder]], to demonstrate that his venomoid snakes were harmless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/handler-raymond-hoser-let-snakes-bite-his-daughter/story-fn7x8me2-1226111929548|title=Handler Raymond Hoser let snakes bite his daughter|last=Prytz|first=Anna|date=10 August 2011|work=heraldsun.com.au|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manager of the shopping center where Hoser performed claimed that Hoser's performance was not consistent with his act description and said that Hoser would not be allowed back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jefferson |first=Andrew |url=http://melton-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/melton-shops-ban-for-snake-act/ |title=Melton shops ban for snake act - Business - News - Melton Leader |publisher=Melton-leader.whereilive.com.au |date= |accessdate=31 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710140028/http://melton-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/melton-shops-ban-for-snake-act/ |archivedate=10 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this incident, the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) suspended Hoser's commercial wildlife demonstrator license and his authorisation to hold snake-handling courses and use wildlife in film and television.&lt;ref name="heraldsun1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/snakeman-has-licence-revoked/story-fn7x8me2-1226116966893|title=Snake handler Raymond Hoser has licence revoked|work=Herald Sun|date=18 August 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Hoser said that he would apply to the courts for an emergency injunction against this suspension.&lt;ref name="heraldsun1"/&gt;

In May 2013, Hoser appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Victoria|Victoria Court of Appeal]] in an attempt to overturn the Department of Sustainability and Environment's (DSE) decision to cancel his wildlife demonstrators licence and [[Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal]] (VCAT) deputy president Judge Pamela Jenkins's decision in 2012 to uphold that DSE cancellation of his license.&lt;ref name="mailtimes.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|last=Russell |first=Mark |url=http://www.mailtimes.com.au/story/1516267/you-die-real-quick-snake-handlers-appeal-after-daughter-bitten/?cs=12 |title=You die real quick: snake handler's appeal after daughter bitten &amp;#124; The Wimmera Mail-Times |publisher=Mailtimes.com.au |date=2013-05-21 |accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="au.news.yahoo.com"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130630173236/http://au.news.yahoo.com/latest/a/-/newshome/17269474/victorian-snake-handler-fights-ban/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, Judge Jenkins had found Hoser intentionally allowed two snakes to bite his daughter 7 times, and compromised both the safety of the audience and the welfare of the snakes during his demonstration.&lt;ref name="mailtimes.com.au"/&gt; According to the [[Daily Examiner]] newspaper, Jenkins in March 9, 2012 had upheld a previous appeal by Hoser (of the DSE actions against him), fining Hoser $4,000 under the [[Wildlife Safety Act]] and ordering Hoser to pay the costs of the DSE of $8,000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dailyexaminer.com.au/news/snake-man-is-sprung-raymond-hoser/1333502/ | title=Snake man is sprung}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins had found that "through his demeanour and evidence, displayed a contempt and reckless disregard for the licence conditions. He has conducted his demonstrations in a manner which seriously compromises the welfare of the snakes he is displaying and the safety and well-being of audience members, including children and, on one occasion, his own daughter."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In March 2013, Justice Robert Redlich of the [[Supreme Court of Victoria|Victoria Court of Appeal]] recommended that Hoser hire a lawyer to represent him (rather than representing himself) and adjourned the hearing until 13 June 2013.&lt;ref name="mailtimes.com.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="au.news.yahoo.com"/&gt;

==Candidate for local and state government==
In 2012, Hoser ran for council of the [[City of Manningham]] (Mullum Mullum ward), but failed to win one of three positions. He received 4.31% of the primary vote.&lt;ref name="Victorian Electoral Commission"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vec.vic.gov.au/Results/ManninghamResult2012.html|title=Results for Manningham City Council Elections 2012|work=Victorian Electoral Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Hoser ran in the Victorian state election 1999 in Frankston East district. He received the fewest votes (11 out of 26,842 votes or 0.04% of first preference votes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.vec.vic.gov.au/Results/state1999resultFrankstonEastDistrict.html | title=State Election 1999: Frankston East District results summary - Victorian Electoral Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russia–Saudi Arabia relations''' ({{lang-ru|	Российско-саудовские отношения}}) ({{lang-ar|العلاقات السعودية الروسية}}) is the bilateral relationship between [[Russia]] and the [[Saudi Arabia|Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]]. The two countries are referred to as the two [[Energy superpower|petroleum superpowers]] and account for about a quarter of the world's [[crude oil]] [[List of countries by oil production|production]]  between them.

==Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union==
The first country to establish full diplomatic relations with the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]] (the name of the Saudi state until 1932) was the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Ismael, Tareq Y., ''The Communist Movement in the Arab World''. [[New York City]]: [[RoutledgeCurzon]], 2005. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kahtani&gt;{{cite web|last=Al Kahtani|first=Mohammad Zaid|title=The Foreign Policy of King Abdulaziz|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/529/1/uk_bl_ethos_412035.pdf|publisher=[[University of Leeds]]|accessdate=21 July 2013|date=December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relations began in 1926&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quandt|first=William B. | authorlink = William B. Quandt|title=Riyadh between the Superpowers|journal=[[Foreign Policy]]|date=Autumn 1981|issue=44|pages=37–56|jstor=1148544}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a means for Moscow to stand up to the UK. The first Consul General was Karim Khakimov, a Soviet Muslim of Tatar descent sometimes called the Soviet [[Lawrence of Arabia]], who in February 1926 drove through gunfire from Jeddah to [[Ibn Saud]]'s residence in the desert to hand over a formal note recognising his status as king. Relations improved further when in June 1926 the Pan-Islamic Congress of Mecca was called to resolve the dispute over control of the holy sites of Mecca and Medina. The Soviet Union, with its 30 million [[Soviet Muslims]], supported Ibn Saud by sending six Soviet Islamic scholars to take part in the congress, contrary to its atheistic ideology. Using the Soviet influence to spread Communist propaganda among Hajj pilgrims was unsuccessful so the diplomatic focus turned to the creation of trade links between Soviet [[Black Sea]] ports and [[Hejaz]]. Ibn Saud's son [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Prince Faisal]] (who became king in 1964) visited the Soviet Union in 1932 during his extensive European trip. King Abdulaziz used Moscow's offer of one million British pounds in financial aid as leverage with London and never accepted the USSR's offer.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/moscow-lost-riyadh-1938-171014113525997.html | title=Russia: How Moscow lost Riyadh in 1938 | publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] | date=October 15, 2017 | accessdate=October 7, 2018 | author=Barmin, Yury }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, relations cooled later on; in 1932, the Soviet Muslims were unofficially banned from performing Hajj. Khakimov returned to Jeddah as the Head of Mission in 1935, and tried to renew the relationship, but Moscow was no longer interested in new trade contracts. [[Stalin]], who was never convinced of the value of the USSR's presence in the Gulf, saw the partnership with King Abdulaziz and political ambitions for the Gulf as disposable political gambits that Moscow thought would enhance relations with England, whose support the Soviet Union sought against [[Hitler]]. Khakimov was recalled to Moscow for a routine visit in 1937 and arrested on suspicion of being a spy; he and his colleague Turyakulov fell victim to Stalin's political terror. Turyakulov was executed in October 1937 and Khakimov the following January.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera"/&gt; King Abdulaziz was outraged at the killing of these two Soviet diplomats whom he considered his friends. Two months after Khakimov's execution American geologists discovered the world's largest deposits of crude oil in [[Dhahran]] prompting the Soviet Union to appoint a new head of mission in Jeddah in 1938. King Abdulaziz refused to accept anyone other than Khakimov or Turyakulov and months later broke diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union, accusing Moscow of inciting a revolution in the Muslim world. With the USSR out of the way, Britain and latterly the US, took over the development and exploitation of [[Saudi oil]].&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera"/&gt;

Relations were especially strained from 1979, during the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], with Saudi Arabia supporting the [[Mujahideen|Afghan Mujahideen]] in [[Operation Cyclone|close cooperation]] with the [[United States]].

Diplomatic relations were only reestablished in 1992, after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and the establishment of the [[Russian Federation]].&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera"/&gt;&lt;ref name=libcong&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi Arabia|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+sa0110%29|publisher=[[The Library of Congress]]|accessdate=27 May 2012|date=December 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a lack of relations, about 20 Soviet Muslims were allowed to annually make the [[Hajj]] from 1946 until 1990 when liberalization allowed thousands of Soviet Muslims to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Openness and Foreign Policy Reform in Communist States|author=Segal, Gerald |year=1992|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bI0OAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Soviet+Saudi+Hajj&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=23 November 2009|pages=149|isbn=978-0-415-08275-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 25 years since, Russian-Saudi relations have never developed beyond symbolic visits though in 2017 Saudi [[King Salman]] visited Moscow with a 1,500-strong delegation; however, the Moscow-Riyadh agreement paled in comparison to Saudi arms contracts with the US.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera"/&gt;

==Saudi Arabia and Russia==
[[File:Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia 11-12 February 2007-14.jpg|thumb|Governor [[Salman bin Abdulaziz]] with Vladimir Putin in 2007]]

[[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] met [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] in [[Riyadh]] during a high level delegation visit on 11–12 February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/37170 President Vladimir Putin and King of Saudi Arabia Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud held talks in Riyadh] kremlin.ru, 11 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first official visit for a Russian leader to the Kingdom. The visit was an opportunity for Moscow to improve its relations with Riyadh regarding various areas, including regional security issues, energy, trade, transportation, scientific cooperation and exchanges. King Abdullah's visit to Russia in 2003, as Crown Prince, was an opening in high level contacts between the countries which did not have diplomatic ties from 1938 until 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/11/AR2007021100048.html Putin 1st Russian Leader to Visit Saudis] WP, 11 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syrian Civil War, military cooperation===
{{also|Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War|Saudi Arabian involvement in the Syrian Civil War}}
Relations between the two countries became strained during the [[Syrian Civil War]], in which Russia and its ally Iran put their support behind Syria′s government and president [[Bashar al-Assad]] while Saudi Arabia along with Qatar and Turkey backed insurgents in Syria, like Al-Nusra.&lt;ref name="nationalking" /&gt;  Saudi Arabia, prior to Russia′s [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|direct military intervention]] in Syria in September 2015, was reported to have sought to use its offer to reduce its oil production in exchange for Russia dropping its support for Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, a proposal that Russia rejected.&lt;ref name="nytlever"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/04/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-is-said-to-use-oil-to-lure-russia-away-from-syrias-assad.html Saudi Oil Is Seen as Lever to Pry Russian Support From Syria’s Assad] NYT, 3 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, Saudi Arabia offered for the first time to send ground troops to Syria; a Saudi official confirmed that Riyadh had sent warplanes to [[Incirlik Air Base]] in [[Turkey]], a move considered as preparation for an incursion into Syria and seen as inimical to Russia′s as well as Iran′s interests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/analysis/2016/02/17/Military-moves-Turkey-and-Saudi-Arabia-close-ranks-on-Syria-.html Military moves: Turkey and Saudi Arabia close ranks on Syria] Al Arabiya, 17 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/04/saudi-arabia-ground-troops-syria-fight-isis Saudi Arabia offers to send ground troops to Syria to fight Isis] The Guardian, 4 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Russia reacted to the reports with public sarcasm alluding to the Saudi Arabian-led [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|military intervention]] in [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://ria.ru/world/20160204/1369880352.html Захарова о планах Эр-Рияда воевать в Сирии: в Йемене всех победили?] RIA Novosti, 4 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations improved significantly in 2017 as Russia′s influence in the Middle East rose following military success in Syria as a result of its [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|intervention in the Syrian conflict]] on the side of the [[Bashar Assad]] government, on whose removal from power Saudi Arabia had insisted prior.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ft.com/content/7ceea568-a8e0-11e7-ab55-27219df83c97 Saudi king’s visit expected to strengthen ties with Russia] FT, 4 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-saudi-meeting/russias-putin-saudi-prince-praise-dialogue-on-oil-syria-idUSKBN18Q0S4 Russia's Putin, Saudi prince praise dialogue on oil, Syria] Reuters, 30 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Military issues were among the topics of discussions held by Vladimir Putin and Saudi [[Minister of Defense (Saudi Arabia)|defence minister]] deputy crown prince [[Mohammed bin Salman]] in Moscow on 30 May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/54627 Встреча с преемником наследного принца, министром обороны Саудовской Аравии Мухаммедом бен Сальманом Аль Саудом] kremlin.ru, 30 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2017/5/31/saudis-powerful-young-royal-meets-putin-in-russia Saudi's powerful young royal meets Putin in Russia] [[Al Arabiya]], 30 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early September 2016, following a meeting between Russian president Vladimir Putin and Saudi deputy crown prince [[Mohammed bin Salman]] on the sidelines of the [[2016 G20 Hangzhou summit|G20 summit]], Saudi Arabia, a leading [[OPEC]] member, and non-OPEC Russia agreed to cooperate in world oil markets to tackle a [[2010s oil glut|global glut]], saying they could limit output in the future and signing a joint statement to this effect.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-g20-china-saudi-russia-oil/saudi-arabia-russia-sign-oil-pact-may-limit-output-in-future-idUSKCN11B0UF Saudi Arabia, Russia sign oil pact, may limit output in future] reuters, 5 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/52825 Meeting with Deputy Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud] kremlin.ru, 4 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Russia agreed to join OPEC nations′ commitment to reduce oil output, with cuts taking effect from 1 January 2017 to last for six months; Russian president Vladimir Putin and Saudi deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, along with Iran’s supreme leader [[Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]], were said to have played a key role in having OPEC rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia set aside differences to make the organization's first deal with non-OPEC Russia in 15 years possible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/10/business/russia-opec-saudi-arabia-cut-oil-output.html Russia and Others Join OPEC in Rare, Coordinated Push to Cut Oil Output] NYT, 10 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-opec-meeting/exclusive-how-putin-khamenei-and-saudi-prince-got-opec-deal-done-idUSKBN13Q4WG Exclusive: How Putin, Khamenei and Saudi prince got OPEC deal done] Reuters, 1 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21711088-oil-prices-surge-saudi-arabia-and-iran-sign-deal-opecs-meeting OPEC reaches a deal to cut production] The Economist, 3 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that the Saudis had been “coordinating [their] oil policies recently” with Moscow in order to convince Russia that Riyadh was a better bet for them than [[Iran|Tehran]], the main goal being ″not to have Russia place all its cards in the region behind Iran″.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/a-young-prince-reimagines-saudi-arabia-can-he-make-his-vision-come-true/2017/04/20/663d79a4-2549-11e7-b503-9d616bd5a305_story.html A young prince is reimagining Saudi Arabia.

==Mythology==
After [[Rangi and Papa]] were separated by their sons, Rangi cried, and his tears flooded the land. To stop this, the sons decided to turn Papa face down, so Rangi and Papa could no longer see each other's sorrow. Rūaumoko was at his mother's breast when this happened, so he was carried into the world below.&lt;ref name="TeAraHistoricEarthquakes" /&gt; He was given fire for warmth by Tama-kaka, and his movements below the earth cause earthquakes and volcanoes.&lt;ref name="EQC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TeAraHistoricEarthquakes" /&gt; Another version tells that he remains in Papa's womb, with some variants saying it was to keep Papa company after her separation from Rangi. In these versions, his movements in the womb cause earthquakes.&lt;ref name="EQC" /&gt;

The earthquakes Rūaumoko causes are in turn responsible for the change of seasons. Depending on the time of year, the earthquakes cause the warmth, or cold, of Papa to come to the surface of the land, resulting in the warming, or cooling of the Earth.&lt;ref name="EQC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Best |first=Elsdon |date=June 1908 |title=Art.

[[Image:Sioux Quartzite.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cross-bedding]] in the '''Sioux Quartzite''', [[Blue Mounds State Park]], Minnesota, USA.]]

The '''Sioux Quartzite''' is a [[Proterozoic]] [[quartzite]] that is found in the region around the intersection of Minnesota, South Dakota, and Iowa, and correlates with other rock units throughout the [[Upper Midwest|upper midwestern]] and [[Southwestern United States|southwestern]] [[United States]]. It was formed by [[braided river]] deposits, and its correlative units are thought to possibly define a large sedimentary wedge that once covered the passive margin on the then-southern side of the [[North American craton]]. In human history, it provided the [[catlinite]], or pipestone, that was used by the [[Plains Indians]] to carve ceremonial pipes. With the arrival of Europeans, it was heavily quarried for building stone, and was used in many prominent structures in [[Sioux Falls]], [[South Dakota]] and shipped to construction sites around the Midwest. Sioux Quartzite has been and continues to be quarried in [[Jasper, Minnesota]] at the Jasper Stone Company and Quarry, which itself was posted to the National Register of Historic Places on January 5, 1978.&lt;ref name="Jasper Stone Company and Quarry"&gt;National Register of Historic Places, Jasper Stone Company and Quarry [http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/pipestone/jsq.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jasper, Minnesota]] contains many turn-of-the-century quartzite buildings, including the school, churches and several other public and private structures, mostly abandoned.

The Sioux Quartzite is a red to pink [[Proterozoic]] [[quartzite]]. It is a thick [[Formation (stratigraphy)|stratigraphic unit]] (~3000 m&lt;ref&gt;Morey, B. G., 1985, Sedimentology of the Sioux Quartzite in the Fulda Basin,Pipestone County, southwestern Minnesota, in Southwick, D. L., cd., Shorter contributions to the geology of the Sioux Quartzite (Early Proterozoic), southwestern Minnesota: Minnesota Geological Survey Report of Investigations 32, pp. 59–74.&lt;/ref&gt;) that crops out in southwestern [[Minnesota]], southeastern and south-central [[South Dakota]], northwestern [[Iowa]], and a small part of northeastern [[Nebraska]]. It is correlated with other sandstone and quartzite [[Geological unit|units]] across [[Wisconsin]] (at [[Rib Mountain]], [[Baraboo]], [[Barron, Wisconsin|Barron]], [[Waterloo, Wisconsin|Waterloo]], and [[Flambeau, Rusk County, Wisconsin|Flambeau]]), southeastern [[Iowa]], southern [[Nebraska]],  and north-central [[New Mexico]] and southeast-central [[Arizona]] (Ortega, Mazatzal, and Deadman Quartzite).&lt;ref name="Field Guide"&gt;Anderson, R.

Its age can be better-constrained by extrapolation correlative units to between 1760 ± 10 Ma.&lt;ref&gt;U-Pb dating by Van Schmus, 1979, Geochronology of the southern Wisconsin rhyolites and granites: University of Wisconsin Extension, Geoscience Wisconsin, v. 2, pp. 9–24.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1640 ± 40 Ma&lt;ref&gt;Van Schmus, W.

E., 1975, Geology and Rb-Sr chronology of middle Precambrian rocks in eastern and central Wisconsin: Geological Society of America Bulletin, v. 86, pp. 1255–1265.&lt;/ref&gt; This period in which The Sioux Quartzite and its correlative units were deposited is known as the Baraboo interval, in which high relative sea levels covered a large amount of North America.&lt;ref name="dott"&gt;Dott, R. H., Jr., 1983, The Baraboo interval; A tale of red quartzite Geological
Society of America Abstracts with Programs, v. 15, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sioux quartzite  was primarily formed by [[braided river]] deposits, of [[quartz arenite]] composition, with 95% of the rock being composed of rounded, fine to medium (0.125–0.5&amp;nbsp;mm) [[sand]]-size [[quartz]] [[Particle size (grain size)|grains]].&lt;ref name="Field Guide" /&gt; The rivers are believed to flow southeast, at a relatively shallow gradient.&lt;ref name="Field Guide" /&gt; Its basal conglomerate is thought to be braided stream deposits that are more proximal to the source, and there is possible marine influence on the upper part of the unit – this interpretation is supported by evidence of marine sediments ([[shale]]s and [[banded iron formation]]s) atop its correlative unit in Baraboo, Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;Ojakangas, R. W., and Weber, R. E., 1985, Petrography and paleocurrents of the Lower Proterozoic Sioux Quartzite, Minnesota and South Dakota, in Southwick, D. L., ed., Shorter contributions to the geology of the Sioux Quartzite (Early Proterozoic), southwestern Minnesota: Minnesota Geological Survey Report of Investigations 32, pp. 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the unit contains ~1 meter beds of [[claystone]], which are known as [[catlinite]] or pipestone, because these beds were used by the natives of the area to carve pipe bowls.&lt;ref name="Field Guide" /&gt; It is thought that the Sioux Quartzite and its correlative units are parts of a once-laterally-extensive sedimentary wedge that covered the then-southern passive margin of the North American craton.&lt;ref name="dott"/&gt;

[[File:Sioux Falls Federal Building 35.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Federal Building and United States Courthouse (Sioux Falls, South Dakota)|Federal Building]] in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]] was constructed with Sioux quartzite from nearby quarries.]]
The Sioux Quartzite is extremely resistant to erosion, and has formed a topographic high through most of [[Phanerozoic]] time. It was inundated by Phanerozoic seas during the periods of maximum sea level, and subsequent erosion removed these sedimentary units. For this reason, the only [[Formation (stratigraphy)|geologic unit]]s to sit atop the Sioux Quartzite are of [[Cretaceous]] age, deposited when a large portion of North America was covered by the [[Cretaceous Interior Seaway]].

Many present-day outcrops of Sioux Quartzite were exposed by [[glacial erosion]] during the [[Quaternary period|Quaternary]].&lt;ref name="Field Guide" /&gt; Some of these have been dated with the [[cosmogenic radionuclide dating|cosmogenic radionuclides]] [[beryllium-10]] and [[aluminium-26]] to determine how long ago the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] retreated from the [[Upper Midwest]]. These dates show that southwestern Minnesota was last covered in glacial ice at least 500,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bierman|first1=P|title=Mid-Pleistocene cosmogenic minimum-age limits for pre-Wisconsinan glacial surfaces in southwestern Minnesota and southern Baffin Island: a multiple nuclide approach|journal=Geomorphology|volume=27|pages=25|year=1999|doi=10.1016/S0169-555X(98)00088-9|bibcode = 1999Geomo..27...25B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2705">'''Spatial design''' is a relatively new [[conceptual design]] discipline that crosses the boundaries of traditional design specialisms such as [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], [[landscape design]], [[interior design]] and [[service design]] as well as certain areas of [[public art]].

It focuses upon the flow of people between multiple areas of interior and exterior environments and delivers value and understanding in spaces across both the private and public realm. The emphasis of the discipline is upon working with people and space, particularly looking at the notion of place, also [[place identity]] and [[genius loci]].  As such the discipline covers a variety of scales, from detailed design of interior spaces to large regional strategies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southwest-ra.gov.uk/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=836 SWRA - The Draft Regional Spatial Strategy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and is largely found within the UK.
As a discipline it uses the language of architecture, interior design and landscape architecture to communicate design intentions.
Spatial design uses [[research methods]] often found in disciplines such as product and [[service design]], identified by [[IDEO]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideo.com/culture/teams/environments-design/ IDEO Environments Design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206063206/http://www.ideo.com/culture/teams/environments-design |date=2009-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as social and historical methods that help with the identification and determination of place.

As a growth area of design, the number of spatial design practitioners work within existing disciplines or as independent consultants.

The subject is studied at a number of institutions within the UK,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.falmouth.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=177&amp;Itemid=201 Spatial Design: Interior &amp; Landscape BA(Hons) - University College Falmouth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.ac.uk/lcc/courses/undergraduate/ba-hons-spatial-design/index.php BA (Hons) Spatial Design - London College of Communication, University of the Arts London] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219121003/http://www.arts.ac.uk/lcc/courses/undergraduate/ba-hons-spatial-design/index.php |date=2014-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though, as with any new field of study, these courses differ in their scope and ambition.

Ultimately it can be seen as 'the glue that joins traditional built environment disciplines together with the people they are designed to serve'.

'''The Black Tusk''' is a [[stratovolcano]] and a [[rock pinnacle|pinnacle]] of [[volcanic rock]] in [[Garibaldi Provincial Park]] of [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. At {{convert|2319|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level,&lt;ref name=Gunn/&gt; the upper spire is visible from a great distance in all directions. It is particularly noticeable from the [[Sea-to-Sky Highway]] just south of [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]], British Columbia. Distinctive and immediately identifiable, The Black Tusk is among the best known mountains in the [[Garibaldi Ranges]] of the [[Coast Mountains]].  The volcano is part of the [[Garibaldi Volcanic Belt]] which is a segment of the [[Canadian Cascade Arc]], but it is not within the geographic boundary of the [[Cascade Range]].

==Indigenous==
To [[Squamish people]], this mountain is known as ''t'a&lt;u&gt;k&lt;/u&gt;'t'a&lt;u&gt;k&lt;/u&gt; mu'yin tl'a in7in'a'xe7en''.  In their [[Sḵwxwú7mesh language|language]] it means "Landing Place of the Thunderbird", speaking of the supernatural ''in7in'a'xe7en'' or [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]].  The jagged shape of the mountain and its black colouring are said to come from the Thunderbird's lightning.&lt;ref name="cmeTusk"/&gt; The same is true for the [[Mount Cayley massif]], another [[stratovolcano]] farther north.

==Geology==
The Black Tusk is considered to be the remnant of an [[Extinct volcano|extinct]] [[andesite|andesitic]] [[stratovolcano]] which formed between about 1.3 and 1.1 million years ago.&lt;ref name="NRCcv"/&gt;  Following glacial dissection, renewed volcanism produced the [[lava dome]] and flow forming its summit about 170,000 years ago.  According to [[Natural Resources Canada]], The Black Tusk was "perhaps the conduit for [[lava]] within a [[cinder]]-rich volcano. The loose cinder has eroded, leaving only the hard lava core."&lt;ref name="GSC"/&gt; The exposed lava rock of the core is loose and [[friability|friable]]. It is also black, giving the mountain its name and character. [[Cinder Cone (British Columbia)|Cinder Cone]], to the east of The Black Tusk, produced a {{convert|9|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long [[lava flow]] during the late [[Pleistocene]] or early [[Holocene]].

The mountain currently hosts two significant [[glacier]]s, in large [[cirque]]s carved into the northeastern and northwestern flanks of the broad cone below the lava pinnacle.  Both glaciers start from about {{convert|2100|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and flow northwards to below {{convert|1800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.  The glaciers are heavily covered in rocky debris due to the crumbling nature of the Tusk's rock.

The Black Tusk is a member of the chain of volcanic peaks that run from southwestern British Columbia to northern California. The peaks formed in the past 35 million years as the [[Juan de Fuca Plate|Juan de Fuca]], [[Gorda Plate|Gorda]] and [[Explorer Plate|Explorer]] plates to its west have been [[subduction|subducting]] under the [[North American Plate]] at the [[Cascadia subduction zone]].

==Recreation==
[[Image:Black Tusk trail.jpg|thumb|250px|Part of the trail from [[Garibaldi Lake]] to The Black Tusk.]]
The Black Tusk's lower flanks and south summit are a popular backcountry [[hiking]] and [[scrambling]] destination.  Most hikers approach from the Taylor Meadows campground to the south near [[Garibaldi Lake]], although there is a second route from the north that travels by way of [[Helm Lake]].&lt;ref name="BcParks"/&gt;

The upper summit area at the top of the lava column can only be reached by scrambling up a short but exposed rock chimney to reach the south summit.&lt;ref name=Gunn/&gt;  The true summit, only about a metre higher, lies just to the north across a precipitous drop.  It is rarely climbed, requiring a [[rappel]] of about {{convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} into a notch followed by a loose and dangerous reascent up the crumbling lava.  On the northern side of the north summit stands an isolated and intimidating rock formation known as the "Bishop's Mitre", which is rumoured to be unclimbed.&lt;ref name="cmeTusk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cmeMitre"/&gt;

'''Trachyandesite''' is an [[extrusive]] [[igneous]] [[Rock (geology)|rock]] with a composition between [[trachyte]] and [[andesite]]. It has little or no free [[quartz]], but is dominated by alkali [[feldspar]] and [[Sodium|sodic]] [[plagioclase]] along with one or more of the following [[mafic]] [[minerals]]: [[amphibole]], [[biotite]] or [[pyroxene]]. Small amounts of [[nepheline]] may be present and [[apatite]] is a common accessory mineral. Trachyandestine is often affiliated with the German word "Schadenfreude" for its chemical properties.

Trachyandesitic [[magma]] can produce explosive [[Plinian eruption]]s, such as happened at [[Mount_Tambora|Tambora]] in 1815.&lt;ref name="Self_Et_Al_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Magma volume, volatile emissions, and stratospheric aerosols from the 1815 eruption of Tambora | first=S. | last=Self | first2=R. | last2=Gertisser | first3=T. | last3=Thordarson | first4=M.

==Varieties==

[[Sodium]]-rich trachyandesite is called [[benmoreite]]. Basaltic trachyandesite is transitional to [[basalt]] and comes in two varieties, [[mugearite]] (sodium-rich) and [[shoshonite]] ([[potassium]]-rich).

[[File:William Dunlop Brackenridge (old).jpg|thumb|Brackenridge in 1880]]
'''William Dunlop Brackenridge''' (1810–1893) was a Scottish nurseryman and botanist.

Brackenridge emigrated to [[Philadelphia]] in 1837, where he was employed by Robert Buist, nurseryman. He was appointed horticulturalist, then assistant botanist, for the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] from 1838-1842. Originally, the well-known botanist [[Asa Gray]] was to be the chief botanist, and William Rich, a Washington, DC socialite and son of an ambassador, was politically appointed as his assistant.  However, Gray never went on the expedition due to taking an academic job, and Rich was appointed botanist, so they needed a new assistant.  Rich was reportedly of little use on the trip, and Brackenridge did almost all the collecting and serious botany work.

Brackenridge was assigned to the U.S. Ship Vincennes.  In 1839, he collected plants in the Sydney and Hunter River districts of [[New South Wales]], Australia. From 1841-1842, the ships explored the [[Oregon]] and California coasts, with trips inland. After returning, he continued working with the collected plants and wrote the fern report for the expedition, included in the overall botanical report written by [[Asa Gray]].  After 1855, he lived in Baltimore and worked as a nurseryman and landscape architect.  Near [[Mount Shasta]], he discovered the California Pitcher Plant, ''[[Darlingtonia californica]]'', one of the noted successes of the expedition. [[John Torrey]] chose the genus name to honor his friend, [[Pennsylvania]] botanist [[William Darlington]].

Brackenridge Passage in [[Puget Sound]] is named for him.

Reports of the day indicate that Brackenridge was a hardy, strapping six-footer. He and his wife Isobel were Presbyterians. They had at least four children: Agnes (1846), Robert Buist (1847), William D. (1850), and Jane Henderson Brackenridge (1854).

== Aim ==
It is estimated that the burden of mental and addictive disorders are among the highest in the world with expected increase over the next decades. However, those estimations are not based on [[Cross-sectional_study|cross-sectional]] [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] [[Survey (human research)|surveys]], rather, they are mainly based on [[literature reviews]] and isolated studies.
The WMH Survey Initiative aim is to accurately address the global burden of mental disorders by obtaining accurate cross-sectional information about the prevalences and correlates of mental and behavioral disorders as well as substance abuse, allowing for evaluation of risk factors and study of patterns of service use in order to target appropriate interventions.

== Collaborators ==
Collaborators in this survey come from all WHO regions of the world, with 27 participating countries.
