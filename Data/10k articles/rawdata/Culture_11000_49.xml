[[File:Arthur de Gobineau, Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines (original).jpg|thumb|Cover of the original edition]]
'''''Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines'''''  (Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races, 1853–1855) is the infamous work of French writer [[Arthur de Gobineau|Joseph Arthur, Comte de Gobineau]], which argues that there are differences between human [[Race (human classification)|races]], that civilizations decline and fall when the races are mixed and that the [[Caucasian race|white race]] is superior. It is today considered to be one of the earliest examples of [[scientific racism]].

Expanding upon [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]]' use of [[ethnography]] to defend the [[Ancien Régime]] against the claims of the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]], Gobineau aimed for [[metanarrative|an explanatory system universal in scope]]: namely, that race is ''the'' primary force determining world events. Using scientific disciplines as varied as [[linguistics]] and [[anthropology]], Gobineau divides the human species into three major groupings, white, yellow and black, claiming to demonstrate that "history springs only from contact with the white races." Among the white races, he distinguishes the [[Aryan race]] as the pinnacle of human development, comprising the basis of all European aristocracies. However, inevitable miscegenation led to the "downfall of civilizations".

== Background ==
Gobineau was a [[Legitimist]] who despaired at France's decline into republicanism and centralization. The book was written after the [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 revolution]] when Gobineau began studying the works of [[Xavier Bichat]] and [[Johann Blumenbach]].

The book was dedicated to King [[George V of Hanover]] (1851–66), the last king of [[House of Hanover|Hanover]].  In the dedication, Gobineau writes that he presents to His Majesty the fruits of his speculations and studies into the hidden causes of the "revolutions, bloody wars, and lawlessness" ("révolutions, guerres sanglantes, renversements de lois") of the age.

In a letter to Count [[Anton von Prokesch-Osten]] in 1856 he describes the book as based upon "a hatred for democracy and its weapon, the Revolution, which I satisfied by showing, in a variety of ways, where revolution and democracy come from and where they are going."&lt;ref&gt;cited in Michael D. Biddiss ''Father of Racist Ideology: Social and Political Thought of Count Gobineau'' (1970) p514&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gobineau and the Bible ==
In Vol I, chapter 11, "Les différences ethniques sont permanentes" ("The ethnic differences are permanent"), Gobineau writes that "Adam is the originator of our white species" ("Adam soit l'auteur de notre espèce blanche"), and creatures not part of the white race are not part of that species.
By this Gobineau refers to his division of humans into three main races: white, black, and yellow. The biblical division into [[Hamitic|Hamites]], [[Semitic people|Semites]], and [[Japhetites]] is for Gobineau a division ''within'' the white race. In general, Gobineau considers the Bible to be a reliable source of actual history, and he was not a supporter of the idea of [[Polygenism|polygenesis]].

== Translation ==
[[Josiah Clark Nott]] hired [[Henry Hotze]] to translate the work into English. Hotze's translation was published in 1856 as '''''The Moral and Intellectual Diversity of Races''''', with an added essay from Hotze and appendix from Nott. However, it "omitted the laws of repulusion and attraction, which were at the heart of Gobineau's account of the role of race-mixing in the rise and fall of civilizations".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bernasconi and Tommy L. Lott (editors) ''The Idea of Race'' Hackett Publishing Co(2000) p45&lt;/ref&gt; Gobineau was not pleased with the version; Gobineau was "particularly concerned that Hotze had ignored his comments on 'American decay generally and upon slaveholding in particular'."&lt;ref&gt;Lonnie A. Burnett ''Henry Hotze, Confederate Propagandist: Selected Writings on Revolution, Recognition, and Race'' The University of Alabama Press (2008) p5&lt;/ref&gt;

The German translation '''''Versuch über die Ungleichheit der Menschenrassen''''' first appeared in 1897 and was translated by Ludwig Schemann, a member of the [[Bayreuth Circle]] and "one of the most important racial theorists of imperial and Weimar Germany".&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Levy (Editor) ''Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution'' ABC-CLIO Ltd (2005) p640&lt;/ref&gt;

A new English language version '''''The Inequality of Human Races''''', translated by Adrian Collins, was published in Britain and the USA in 1915 and remains the standard English language version. It continues to be republished in the USA.

==Influence==
Steven Kale argues that Gobineau's "influence on the development of racial theory has been exaggerated and his ideas have been routinely misconstrued".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Steven |last=Kale |title=Gobineau, Racism, and Legitimism: a Royalist Heretic in Nineteenth-Century France |journal=Modern Intellectual History |volume=7 |issue=1 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=April 2010 |page=59 |doi=10.1017/S1479244309990266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gobineau's ideas found an audience in the United States and in German-speaking areas more so than in France, becoming the inspiration for a host of racial theories, for example those of [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]]. "Gobineau was the first to theorize that race was the deciding factor in history and the precursors of Nazism repeated some of his ideas, but his principle arguments were either ignored, deformed, or taken out of context in German racial thought".&lt;ref name="Kale2010p60"&gt;Kale (2010) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

German historian [[Joachim C. Fest]], who wrote a biography of Hitler, describes Gobineau, in particular his negative views on race-mixing as expressed in his essay, as an eminent influence on [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazism]]. Fest writes that the influence of Gobineau on Hitler can be easily seen and that Gobineau's ideas were used by Hitler in simplified form for demagogic purposes: "Significantly, Hitler simplified Gobineau's elaborate doctrine until it became demagogically usable and offered a set of plausible explanations for all the discontents, anxieties, and crises of the contemporary scene."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joachim C. |last=Fest |authorlink=Joachim Fest |title=Hitler |publisher=Mariner Books |year=2002 |chapter = Vision | pages=210–211 |ISBN=0-15-602754-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Professor Steven Kale has cautioned that "Gobineau's influence on German racism has been repeatedly overstated".&lt;ref name="Kale2010p60"/&gt;

Although cited by groups such as the [[Nazi Party]], the text implicitly criticizes [[antisemitism]] and describes Jews in positive terms, the Jews being seen as a superbly forged race of "ancient Greek-like strength" of cohesion. Implicitly, the folk of Judah merely represented a wandering, semi-austral variation of Ur-Aryan blood-stock. Gobineau stated, "Jews... became a people that succeeded in everything it undertook, a free, strong, and intelligent people, and one which, before it lost, sword in hand, the name of an independent nation, had given as many learned men to the world as it had merchants." Philo-Judaic sentiment was intermixed with ethnological theories concerning the primally Indo-Iranian/Indo-Aryan archeogenetic matrix whence sprang the Jews. In these lines of speculative anthropology, the Jews were anciently (supposedly) primordially interpreted as of atypical [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] ethnicity: Judaic racial typology emerged from [[Iranid]]&amp;ndash;[[Nordid]] founders, the details considered inessential, possessors of compatibly "white" "Aryan" blood being the main point. The latter-day "Hamiticized" Jewish folk came into existence from non-Afro-Asiatic [[Hurrian]] (or Horite), [[Jebusite]], [[Amorite]] or early-[[Hittites|Hittite]], [[Mittani]]-affiliated racial nuclei, the "consensus science" of the time asserted. The blatantly, ironically almost aggressive pro-Jewish attitude of Gobineau, akin to Nietzsche in sheer admiration and lionization of the Jews as one of the "highest races", proved ideologically vertiginous to the Nazi propagandists and [[Procrustean]] thinkers—here Gobineau unmistakably contradicted perhaps the main pillar of Nazi political ideology, the schizoid, neo-Gnostic dualism of "Jewish demonology", painfully obvious as reflective of low-grade moral-intellectual barbarism. Incompatible with Nazi ideology, the Count's fervent Judaic positivity and total dearth of antisemitism the Nazis could only attempt to ignore or minimize away in the silence of hypocrisy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sabine |first=George |authorlink=George Holland Sabine |year=1988 |title=Historia de la teoría política |location=Madrid |publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económica |isbn=9789681641993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races, Section 'The Influence of Locality'&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animusic''' is an [[United States|American]] company specializing in the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Music visualization|visualization]] of [[MIDI]]-based music. Founded by [[Wayne Lytle]], it is incorporated in [[New York (state)|New York]], with offices in [[Texas]] and [[California]]. The initial name of the company was '''Visual Music''', but changed to Animusic in 1995.

The company is known for its ''Animusic'' compilations of computer-generated animations, based on MIDI events processed to simultaneously drive the music and on-screen action, leading to and corresponding to every sound.  The animated short "Pipe Dream" showed at [[SIGGRAPH]]'s Electronic Theater in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.awn.com/animationworld/siggraph-2001-computer-animation-festival-digital-odyssey&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many other music visualizations, the music drives the animation. While other productions may animate figures or characters to the music, the animated models in ''Animusic'' are created first, and are then programmed to follow what the music "tells them" to. 'Solo cams' featured on the ''Animusic'' DVD shows how each instrument plays through a piece of music from beginning to end.

Many of the instruments appear to be [[robot]]ic or play themselves using seemingly curious methods to produce and visualize the original compositions. The animations typically feature dramatically-lit rooms or landscapes.

The music of ''Animusic'' is principally pop-rock based, consisting of straightforward sequences of triggered samples and digital patches mostly played "dry" (with few [[:Category:Audio effects|effects]]). There are no [[lyrics]] or voices, save for the occasional [[Choir|chorus]] [[synthesizer]]. According to the director's comments on ''Animusic 2'', most instrument sounds are generated with software synthesizers on a music workstation (see [[Animusic#Software programs|Software Programs]] for more info). Many sounds resemble stock patches available on digital keyboards, subjected to some manipulation, such as pitch or playback speed, to enhance the appeal of their [[timbre]].

==Compilations==
{{As of|2017}}, three video albums have been released:

*''Animusic: A Computer Animation Video Album''
*''Animusic 2: A New Computer Animation Video Album''
*''Animusic HD: Stunning Computer-Animated Music''

All Animusic DVDs are set to [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 0]], meaning they are playable in all [[DVD player]]s worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animusic.com/support/#q06|title=Animusic &amp;#124; Support &amp;#124; 6|accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Animusic'' was released in 2001 on VHS, and later [[DVD]], with a special edition DVD being released later, in 2004.  This special edition included extra material, such as Animusic's first animation, "Beyond the Walls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animusic.com/_ProtoPHP/_D-Details.php?title=Animusic%3Cbr/%3E1&amp;itemType=DVD&amp;itemCode=DVD-1&amp;itemListPrice=19.95&amp;itemSalePrice=15.95|title=Animusic Special Edition Details|accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second album, ''Animusic 2'', was released in the United States in 2005. Later, in 2008, this volume was released in Japan through a distribution deal with Japanese company [[Jorudan|Jorudan, Co. Ltd.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animusic.com/news-Jorudan.html|title=Animusic 2 in Japan|accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a company newsletter, it was announced that the Animusic company would also be producing a [[High-definition video|high-definition]] version of ''Animusic 2'' on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]], to be released sometime before their third major album, ''Animusic 3''.&lt;ref name="High Definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animusic.com/news-Nov06.html|title=Animusic 2 in HD| accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This HD compilation was eventually released in November 2010, featuring all of the animations featured in ''Animusic 2'', as well as the animation "Pipe Dream" from ''Animusic'' encoded at a high bitrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animusic.com/_ProtoPHP/_D-Details.php?title=Animusic%3Cbr/%3EHD&amp;itemType=BRD&amp;itemCode=BRD-0&amp;itemListPrice=24.95&amp;itemSalePrice=19.95|title=Animusic HD Details|accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later newsletter,  the working titles of three animations in ''Animusic 3'', “Sonic Warfare”, “Paddle Ball” and “Super Pipe Dream”, were revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animusic.com/news-Wayne-news-Nov07.html|title=November 2007 Newsletter|accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a Kickstarter campaign for ''Animusic 3'' was successfully launched and funded. ''Animusic 3'' has not yet been completed; however, "The Sound of Twelve", a music-only album made using similar harmonics as ''Animusic,'' was released in March 2015.

==Publicity==
''Animusic'' has been promoted at [[SIGGRAPH]] since 1990, and has been promoted on [[Public Broadcasting Service]] and other [[television network]]s such as [[CNN]].&lt;ref name="Animusic Media Reviews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animusic.com/reviews/media.php|title=Animusic &amp;#124; Reviews &amp;#124; Media|accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wayne Lytle and his works have also been featured on [[Fox News]] and over 30 other local stations in January 2007.&lt;ref name="Lytle interviews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animusic.com/news-TVtour.html|title=Wayne Lytle TV interviews| accessdate=2007-10-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071015045010/http://www.animusic.com/news-TVtour.html| archivedate= 15 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animusic's "Pipe Dream" was released as a real-time demo for ATI's Radeon 9700 series graphics cards.&lt;ref name="Radeon"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://ati.amd.com/developer/demos/r9700.html| title= Pipe Dream video used as a Radeon demo| accessdate= 2007-10-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012230637/http://ati.amd.com/developer/demos/r9700.html| archivedate= 12 October 2007| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Animusic also rendered "Resonant Chamber" and "Starship Groove" in [[High-definition video|HD]] resolution for [[Apple (computer)|Apple]]'s [[QuickTime]] HD Gallery.&lt;ref name="Apple"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/quicktime/guide/hd/animusic2dvd.html |title=Animusic featured in Apple's Quicktime's HD gallery |accessdate=2007-10-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823081838/http://www.apple.com/quicktime/guide/hd/animusic2dvd.html |archivedate=2007-08-23 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular tourist destination located in [[Fredericksburg, Texas]], the Rockbox Theater, often plays the ''Animusic'' DVDs either before shows or during intermission.&lt;ref name="Rockbox Theater"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animusic.com/news/Rockbox_Theater.php|title=Animusic &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Rockbox Theater|accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an internet rumor that suggested that the "Pipe Dream" video was actually a machine created at the [[University of Iowa]] from farm machinery parts. Although this has been proven false,&lt;ref name="Snopes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/photos/arts/musicmachine.asp|title='Farm Machine Music' on Snopes|accessdate=2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rumor is still considered "pretty amusing" to the Animusic staff.&lt;ref name="Hoax email"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animusic.com/news/hoax-email.php|title=Animusic &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Hoax Email|accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intel]] later commissioned a version of the machine to be built which was demonstrated at IDF 2011.&lt;ref name="Intel Demo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sisudevices.com/projects/Intel-Pipe-Dream-Demo-IDF-2011/|title=Intel Pipe Dream Demo (IDF 2011)|accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software programs==
According to the company's [[FAQ]], animation is created [[Procedural animation|procedurally]] with their own proprietary MIDImotion engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animusic.com/support/#q06|title=Animusic &amp;#124; Support &amp;#124; 10|accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[3D Studio Max|Discreet 3D Studio Max]] was used for modeling, lighting, cameras, and rendering. Maps were painted with [[Corel Painter]], Deep Paint 3D, and [[Photoshop]]. They have also created their own software called ANIMUSIC|studio that is based on scene-graph technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animusic.com/company/software.php |title=Animusic &amp;#124; Company &amp;#124; Software |publisher=Animusic |date= |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an August 2015 newsletter, Animusic has using [[Unreal Engine|Unreal Engine 4]] for rendering since ''Animusic 3''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Update 24: Alive · ANIMUSIC 3 (DVD / Blu-ray)|url = https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2040578790/animusic-3-dvd/posts/1330238|website = Kickstarter|accessdate = 2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#This animation starts with a musical bubble machine on the wall. It blows different sizes of [[purple]] bubbles and it shows that the biggest bubble has the lowest pitch and the smallest bubble has the highest pitch. Next, the gong rings twice and the harmonious trumpets and tuba play the [[fanfare]] with vertical clash cymbals striking four times. Then, the bass drum with a hi-hat on top of, big wheel below and two arms attached to it comes out of the [[door]] with a yellow [[star]] on it and begins to play. A two-armed snare drum with a cowbell on top and a medium wheel below comes out of its doors and joins its bass drum friend for a beat. As the walls begin to open, their one-armed friend the crash cymbal joins in as well and the percussion instruments get in their positions in front of the musical light/laser machine that first plays the bass lights with all the lasers joining in with harmony. A group of these instruments continue playing as they move towards the doors and the yellow laser, along with one of the red ones, opens the doors with all the airplane tom-toms and the helicopter clash cymbals taking off for the percussive solo pattern. The flying percussion instruments move aside as the choir lasers solve the puzzle to open the ship's doors and for the grand finale, as the white fireworks pop up, all the moving instruments fly into the starry sky far away.

#* The robotic drummer (surrounded by a percussion set) has four arms and one bass drum mallet foot; two of the arms hold [[Percussion mallet|2B Drum stick]]s while the other two hold the vibraphone mallets. The Three-Necked Electric Guitar has metallic fingers that pluck the strings of the electric bass, and a metallic arm that strums the strings of the lead and rhythm guitars in both plucked and arpeggiated styles. As a whole instrument, the body is colored green and sports various [[electrical connector|plug]]s and lights. There are also giant [[loudspeaker]]s in the background, connected to the electronic instruments, with [[VU meter|VU]] displays that light up when the instruments are played.
#'''Stick Figures''' (5:23)
#*BPM=188
#*Instruments in the order they're presented:
#**Hammered one string fretless [[chapman stick]] (known as "Mr. Stick")
#**[[Percussion instrument]]s, including a [[Drum kit|Drum Kit]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[Whip (instrument)|Slapstick]], [[Gong]], and [[Metallophone]]

#**26-stringed [[Harp]]
#**[[Pan flute|Pan Flute]]
#**[[Tubular Bell]]s
#**1-stringed [[Cello]]
#**1-stringed [[Violin]]
#*The room in which this animation takes place is completely enclosed. Its ceiling is painted a dark blue or black with a [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]] and [[star]]s that appear to glow. The room is filled with about one foot of water in which the harp sits right in the middle. Between instrumental refrains, the lighting changes between warm-toned lamps on the wall and cool-toned, blue-ish underwater lights. All of the instruments are connected to the harp.
#*In the background, water gently ripples throughout the piece. Some lights are set on top of the wooden [[column]]s.
#'''Drum Machine''' (3:22)
#*BPM=120, 185
#*Instruments in the order they're presented: (various gear-driven [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] devices)
#**Background [[gear]]-grinding noises (synced to the [[tempo]] of the music)

#**A second [[drum kit]] with four [[timbales]], four [[timpani]], four [[wood block]]s, a [[vibraslap]] and two [[agogô]] [[bell (instrument)|bells]]
#**A third kit with three church bells approximating B♭, E♭ and C, and two [[Gong|tamtam]]s
#*Like machines in the factory, the gears rotate automatically to play the percussion instruments. As the drum kit keeps playing, two more kits descend with the control of the [[chain]]s. At the end of the performance, the gears stop moving.
#'''Pipe Dream''' (3:28)
#*BPM=147
#*Instruments in the order they're presented:

#***A [[drum kit]]
#***A circular [[vibraphone]] fountain
#***[[Tubular bell]]s
#***A Slide-bar [[Marimba]]
#*This performance begins with the ball firing testing on the bass/bongo double instrument. The vibraphone fountain and the tubular bells appear to be made of gold.
#*This video is the second most famous Animusic animation, partially in thanks to an email hoax stating that the set was a real machine built at the [[University of Iowa]] using farm equipment. The hoax mail also said that it took 13,000 hours to make the performance (equivalent to about a year and a half), including building, calibrating, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animusic &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Hoax Email|url=http://www.animusic.com/news/hoax-email.php|website=Animusic|publisher=Animusic|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#*In 2012, [[Intel]] made a real version with 2,300 balls, taking 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Normal |first=Nick |url=http://makezine.com/2012/02/20/animusics-pipe-dream-made-real |title=Animusic’s "Pipe Dream" Made Real |website=makezine.com |date=February 20, 2012 |accessdate=2016-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Harmonic Voltage''' (5:58)
#*BPM=114
#*Instruments in the order they're presented:
#**Background [[Synthesizer|synth]] strings (emitted from plasma wisp)
#**[[Red]] [[Synthesizer|synth]] tower laser (beginning in [[purple]], then interchanging into [[pink]] and [[red]] between pro-chorus [pink] and true chorus [red])

===Animusic 2: A New Computer Animation Video Album===
Track listing:
#'''Starship Groove'''
#*BPM=111
#*Instruments in the order they're presented:
#**Blue [[Bass (sound)|bass]] [[Synthesizer|synth]]

#**Two-player [[drum kit]]
#**Red lead [[Synthesizer|synth]]
#**Two low-pitched [[power chord]] accent flashes
#**Yellow plucked [[Synthesizer|synth]]
#**Two high-pitched power chord accent flashes
#*Most of these instruments are played by the five starship robots. While they perform, the starship travels steadily through space. In the commentary, Wayne Lytle states that the robot that plays the red lead synth pad set looks like a female. "She" is also capable of actions and body language.
#*The spaceship whirs throughout the piece, although not heard during the music itself, but at the beginning and end.
#'''Pogo Sticks'''
#*BPM=107
#*Instruments in the order they're presented:
#**Two hammered [[chapman stick]] (one lead, one backup)
#**Hammered [[bass guitar]] (an updated version from 'Stick Figures'; the bass now has two strings plus the small [[wheel]]s and is in motion)

#***3 [[bass drum]]s and a [[snare drum]]
#***2 [[cymbal]]s, 3 [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hats]] and a [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]]
#**Two [[xylophone]]s
#***[[Marimba]]
#***[[Metallophone]]
#*It has been revealed that the stick bass has "cousins," which are the hammered guitars. His "friends" are the drum kit playing sticks and the two stick xylophones, one as a marimba and another as a metallophone. They also have green lights that [[Chemiluminescence|glow]] when they go through tunnels. Throughout the performance, they travel around the wooden course at sunset, stopping at stages intermittently.
#*This animation has actually been evolved from the "Stick Figures" animation from the first ''Animusic''. On the stills seen on the DVD, it is revealed that the instruments are actually the original stick bass, with appropriate changes. The "Stick Figures" stage was copied several times and appears as the stages the band stops on.
#'''Resonant Chamber'''
#*BPM=120, 155,180
#*Instruments in the order they're presented:
#**Eight-stringed [[Classical guitar]]
#**[[Koto (instrument)|Koto]]
#**Two-string [[bass guitar]]
#**Four-stringed tapping [[Guitar]]
#**Two-string [[Guitar]]
#**Three-stringed [[mandolin]]
#*Across the circle-shaped [[resonator]] are the strings of the classical guitar and a bass guitar which cross each other.
#*In this animation, it can be noted that there is only one dark sky with four windows and four different moons. One of them is the thick [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]], another is the [[full moon]], third is the [[Lunar phase|waning gibbous]] and the last one is the thin crescent moon. Inside the room, there are four [[lantern]]s already lit up.
#'''Cathedral Pictures''' (based on selections from the 1971 [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]] [[Pictures at an Exhibition (Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer album)|adaptation]] of ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' by [[Modest Mussorgsky]])

#**Lime [[Electric arc]] sound ([[synthesizer|synthesized]] tone) Laser 
#**Light-emitting [[Flute]] 
#**[[Pyrotechnics]] 
#*This animation performance plays a medley of three selected tunes written by Mussorgsky in Lytle's arrangement. They are "Promenade", "Hut of Baba-Yaga" and "The Great Gate of Kiev". In front of the robotic drummer is a drum kit with two [[bass drum]]s. It also demonstrates a [[Drum roll|drumroll]] on the snare drum in transmission from the "Hut of Baba Yaga" to the "Great Gate of Kiev".
#'''Pipe Dream 2'''
#*BPM=140
#*Instruments in the order they're presented: (the set is used in Pipe Dream in the first ''Animusic'', but is aged and dented here)

#**[[Percussion instrument|Percussion]], including:
#***A [[drum kit]]
#***A circular [[vibraphone]] fountain
#***[[Tubular bell]]s
#***A Slide-bar [[Marimba]]
#*To contrast the two different performances on this set, the Bass/Bongo double instrument next to the wall is lit by a blue light in the second version, as opposed to a magenta light in the first version. The [[gold]]en vibraphone fountain now glows orange when struck instead of white. The back wall from the first animation has been removed to reveal a large empty space filled with pipes. The tubular bells also have a little more detail, partially due to the fact that they spend more time onscreen.
#'''Fiber Bundles'''
#*BPM=112
#*Instruments in the order they're presented:
#**Green [[Bass (sound)|Bass]] Chorus Synth
#**White Echo light [[Synthesizer|Synth]] Pulses

The performance starts with the blue chorus beams appearing to trigger the transformation of the pyramid into the musical temple. At least three other planets or moons can be seen in the sky, one of which bears a strong resemblance to the planet [[Jupiter]].

===Animusic 3: The Next Computer Animation Video Album===
Animusic is currently producing the third volume of the ''Animusic'' series; it was once intended to be released sometime in 2010, featuring animations such as "Sonic Warfare", "Paddle Ball", and "Super Pipe Dream".&lt;ref name="Release Date Unknown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animusic.com/news/wayne-news-sep-09.php|title=September 2009 Newsletter| accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this release date passed with no word regarding the volume's progress. In November 2010, Animusic attributed this delay to a complete restructuring of their modeling and rendering software.&lt;ref name="November 2010 Newsletter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animusic.com/Newsletters/2010-11/BluNooz.html|title=Animusic Blu-ray!| accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 6, 2012, the company began a [[Kickstarter]] campaign aimed at raising $200,000 to fund the completion of the ''Animusic 3'' DVD.&lt;ref name="Kickstarter Campaign"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2040578790/animusic-3-dvd|title=ANIMUSIC 3 (DVD/Blu-ray) by ANIMUSIC| accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign was featured on several websites such as [[Animation World Network]].&lt;ref name="A3 Starts Production"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/news/music-and-sound/animusic-3-starts-production|title=ANIMUSIC 3 Starts Production| accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rough mix from the newly revealed album ''The Sound of 12'', titled "Glarpedge," was released online on August 28, 2012.&lt;ref name=Glarpedge&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/animusic_tracks/animusic-so12-glarpedge|title=So12 Glarpedge by ANIMUSIC| accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This album has been described by the company as "the soul of ''Animusic 3''."&lt;ref name="So12"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/animusic_tracks|title=ANIMUSIC's sounds on SoundCloud| accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, 2012, two more mixes were released: "Emoticondria"&lt;ref name=Emoticondria&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/animusic_tracks/animusic-so12-emoticondria|title=So12 Emoticondria by ANIMUSIC| accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "EchoKrunch."&lt;ref name=EchoKrunch&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/animusic_tracks/animusic-so12-echokrunch|title=So12 EchoKrunch by ANIMUSIC| accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kickstarter page was later updated to confirm that a Blu-ray edition of ''Animusic 3'' would be released shortly following the DVD's completion.&lt;ref name="Kickstarter Campaign Updates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2040578790/animusic-3-dvd/posts|title=ANIMUSIC 3 (DVD/Blu-ray) by ANIMUSIC ≫ Updates| accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 5, 2012, the Kickstarter campaign ended successfully, with a final backing amount of $223,123, surpassing the goal and reportedly putting ''Animusic 3'' into its final production stages.&lt;ref name="Animusic 3 Preview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animusic.com/previews/animusic3.php|title=Animusic &amp;#124; Previews &amp;#124; Animusic 3| accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animusic posted expected shipping dates of October 2013 for the DVD, and February 2014 for the Blu-ray disc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2040578790/animusic-3-dvd/posts/629957&lt;/ref&gt; However, both dates have passed without either product being released.

Although the release of ''Animusic 3'' has been postponed for some time, others have created and released tribute animations and fan-made versions of the Animusic concept through [[YouTube]] while the third addition to the series has been anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjJTNmGoyAj7UODl9WUeA_0qhYnzmM0_4&amp;feature=mh_lolz&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, hundreds of these homemade animations have been produced and shared. The bulk of these animations have been created since shortly after the release of [[Animusic 2]].

On a Kickstarter update in August 2015,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2040578790/animusic-3-dvd/posts/1330238&lt;/ref&gt; Wayne Lytle announced some other factors that have delayed the project, including Dave Crognale's departure from the project, personal struggles, physical stress and injury, and the distribution of supplemental prizes for backers. However, he insisted on his determination to finish the project, expressing his excitement about the abilities of the newly-implemented [[Unreal Engine 4]] and his gratitude for those who have invested in him. Lytle stated that he had withheld from posting an update until he had a completion date, but did not give one in the update.

Since 2015, no further updates have been posted, and there is once again speculation as to whether Animusic 3 is still in production, and, if so, when it will be completed.  Many Kickstarter backers have expressed their frustration with the company's continued lack of communication about the project, inferring that it is suffering from a lack of personnel in its production team, along with other issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2040578790/animusic-3-dvd/posts/1330238/comments|title=Comments » ANIMUSIC 3 (DVD / Blu-ray) —  Kickstarter|website=www.kickstarter.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, the Animusic headquarters, including Animusic's office space and the Lytle residence, was sold&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn-uploads.weebly.com/uploads/7/1/1/5/7115035/printer_friendly_report_-_image_mate_online.pdf|title=Property Description Report For: 99 Eastlake Rd, Municipality of Lansing|last=|first=|date=|website=Tompkins County, New York|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to RP Solutions, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rpsolutions.com/about/contact-us|title=Contact Us|website=rpsolutions.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ashiq Qarib''''' ({{lang-az|Aşıq Qərib}}, literally "the wandering [[ashik]]") is an anonymous [[Romance (love)|romantic]] [[dastan]],  composed not earlier than the 16—17th centuries and popular in [[Transcaucasia]] and [[Central Asia]]. The verses, which are incorporated into the prose, are ascribed to the eponymous hero, a wandering Ashik who began his journeys with worldly love and attains wisdom by travelling and learning then achieving sainthood. The original Tatar version was first recorded by [[Mikhail Lermontov]] in 1837 and was published in 1846. In 1915 Azerbaijani composer [[Zulfugar Hajibeyov]] wrote an opera ''[[Ashig Garib (opera)|Ashiq Qarib]]''.

The dastan is popular in [[Asia Minor]] and [[Middle Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', 3rd Edition (1970-1979)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Turkey|Turkish]] version assumed the form of cycles (''Son of Ashik-Garip'' and ''Grandson of Ashik-Garip''). The [[Turkmenistan|Turkmen]] version (''Shasenem and Garib'') abounds in ethnic details and historical names.

The story of Ashiq Qarib has been the main feature of a [[Ashik Kerib (film)|movie with the same name]] by director and producer [[Sergei Parajanov]].

'''''Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction''''' ({{ISBN|0-19-530567-1}}) is a book published in 2007 by the [[Oxford University Press]]. It was edited by Jeff Prucher, with an introduction by [[Gene Wolfe]].  The vocabulary includes words used in [[science fiction]] books, TV and film. A second category rises from discussion and criticism of science fiction, and a third category comes from the subculture of fandom. In 2008 it won the [[Hugo Award for Best Related Book]].

It is stated to be "the first historical dictionary devoted to science fiction", tracing how science fiction terms have developed over time.

'''{{Lang|la|Castigat ridendo mores}}''' ({{IPA-la|kaˈstiːɡat rɪˈdɛndoː ˈmoːreːs}}) (laughing corrects morals) is a Latin phrase that generally means "one corrects customs by laughing at them," or "he corrects morals by ridicule."&lt;ref name=Latin-Quotes&gt;{{cite web|title=Latin Quotes: Criticism|url=http://latin-phrases.co.uk/quotes/criticism/|work=Latin Phrases &amp; Quotes|accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators suggest that the phrase embodies the essence of satire; in other words, the best way to change things is to point out their absurdity and laugh at them.&lt;ref name=Commentators&gt;{{cite web|last=Felt|first=Scott|title=Latin Phrases in Scholarly Writing|url=http://pacs.unt.edu/criminal-justice/content/latin-phrases-scholarly-writing|publisher=University of North Texas, Department of Criminal Justice|accessdate=July 11, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104034723/http://pacs.unt.edu/criminal-justice/content/latin-phrases-scholarly-writing|archivedate=November 4, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; French [[New Latin]] [[poet]] Abbé {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean de Santeul|fr}} (1630–1697) allegedly coined the phrase.&lt;ref name=Santeul&gt;{{cite web|title=Castigat ridendo mores.

==Biography==

Cathal Buí Mac Giolla Ghunna (?1680-1756)&lt;ref&gt;http://ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/Mac/M-Giolla-G_C/life.htm&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the four most prominent of the south [[Ulster]] and north [[Leinster]] poets in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. He has been described as 'an Irish-speaking [[Christy Moore]], an incisive ballad singing entertainer for a totally Irish-speaking community of poor people living at or below subsistence in the early 18th century.'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eofeasa.ie/cathalbui/public_html/danta_CB/who_was_CB.html| Féile Chathal Buí 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of a school of ballad poetry that included [[Peadar Ó Doirnín]], [[Art Mac Cumhaigh]], and [[Séamas Dall Mac Cuarta]].

Mac Giolla Ghunna was probably born in [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] and, having initially studied to be a priest, settled for a career as a [[rake-poet]].&lt;ref&gt;''An Duanaire 1600–1900: Poems of the Dispossessed'', p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; 
It has been remarked about his poetry that 'of the handful of poems attributed to him, most are marked by a rare humanity, but none can match ''[[An Bonnán Buí]]'' ''(The Yellow Bittern)'' with its finely-judged blend of pathos and humour'.&lt;ref&gt;Seán Ó Tuama and Thomas Kinsella, ''An Duanaire 1600–1900: Poems of the Dispossessed'', p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Although "Cathal Buí", as he is still affectionately termed in the folklore of [[Bréifne]], is now little known in Ireland, his masterpiece ''[[An Bonnán Buí]]'' is one of the best known songs in Irish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eofeasa.ie/cathalbui/public_html/danta_CB/an_bonnan_bui.html ''An Bonnán Buí''], with a translation by [[Seamus Heaney]].&lt;/ref&gt; "An Bonnán Buí" was based in [[Lough MacNean]], which is situated between Fermanagh and Cavan. A monument in his honour lies near there, which was unveiled by [[Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh]].
 
A study of the Bréifne school of poetry is forthcoming from [[Pádraigín Ní Uallacháin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishsong.com/work.html Gaelic Song Tradition of Bréifne project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629145112/http://www.irishsong.com/work.html |date=2007-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His memory is celebrated annually in his home country – [[Blacklion]] (Cavan) and [[Belcoo]] (Fermanagh), with a festival for young poets named in his honour, ''Féile Chathal Buí''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eofeasa.ie/cathalbui/public_html/index.html Féile Chathal Buí]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CharioteerPapyrus.jpg|thumb|250px|The Charioteer Papyrus]]

The '''Charioteer Papyrus''' ([[London]], [[Egypt Exploration Society]], s.n.) is a 5th-century fragment of an illustration from an unknown work of literature.  It is one of the finest surviving fragments of classical book illustration.  Unlike other surviving illustrated fragments of papyrus, such as the ''[[Romance Papyrus]]'' and the ''[[Heracles Papyrus]],'' which have illustrations that are little more than mere sketches, the ''Charioteer Papyrus'' is sensitively drawn and finely colored. It shows portions of six [[chariot]]eers in red or green [[tunic]]s.  Although there is no text on the fragment, it undoubtedly served an illustration for a literary work, perhaps serving as an illustration for the [[chariot race]] at the games at the funeral of [[Patroclus]] in the ''[[Iliad]].''

'''Charles Heidsieck''' is the smallest of the Grandes Marques [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] Houses. Based in the [[Reims]] region of [[Champagne (wine region)|Champagne]], it is one of the best-known producers for both [[vintage]] and non-vintage ''[[cuvée]]''.&lt;ref name="Stevenson pg 180"&gt;{{cite book|last =Stevenson |first= Tom, ed. |authorlink=Tom Stevenson |title =The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia (4th Edition) |pages =180 |publisher =Dorling Kindersley |year =2005 |isbn=  0-7513-3740-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of [[:fr:EPI (holding)|EPI]] group since 2011. 
The house was founded in 1851 by the French champagne maker [[Charles Heidsieck|Charles Camille Heidsieck]], who became known as Champagne Charlie.

==History==
[[Charles Heidsieck]] was born in 1822 into an eminent Reims family whose wine-making traditions date back to Florens-Louis Heidsieck (see [[Heidsieck &amp; Co]]). In 1851, at age 29, he founded a wine house (Maison) bearing his own name. He began to sell his champagne abroad, starting in Belgium and in England, and in 1852 he travelled to the United States, becoming the first merchant to market his own champagne there. He was a larger than life dandy and became something of a social sensation, one New York newspaper describing him as "Champagne Charlie". He visited on three further occasions until the [[American Civil War]] disrupted trade. He returned to New York in an unsuccessful effort to recover debts owed by his agents and on visiting the south he became trapped by the conflict. In July 1862, Charles Heidsieck was arrested as a spy while travelling to New Orleans trying to flee back to France. He was sent to the infamous Fort Jackson in Louisiana. After many pleas, and the intercession of President Lincoln himself, Charles was released in November 1862, but he returned to France sick and bankrupt. His business was subsequently saved because a debt was repaid in deeds to land in Coronado where, shortly afterwards, there was a silver boom which turned the obscure village of Denver into valuable estate.

Charles Heidsieck focused on selecting, blending and ageing wines to produce higher quality champagnes, buying grapes from individual growers. In 1867 he purchased several old chalk quarries, called crayères which dated from the Gallo-Roman era, in order to create optimal conditions for wine maturation. There cellars are now inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List along with others champagne vineyards, houses and cellars.

His showmanship and the quality of his wines earned him royal warrants from the many of the royal and imperial families of the time.

For a long period Charles Heidsieck was owned by the [[Henriot (champagne)|Henriot]] group. In 1985, Charles Heidsieck became part of the [[Rémy Cointreau]] wine and spirits group, and was sold in 2011 to privately owned French luxury goods group EPI (Société européenne de participations industrielles) founded by Christopher Descours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/45126 French Luxury Firm Buys Charles Heidsieck and Piper Heidsieck] Wine Spectator: June 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''creative director''' is a position often found within the [[graphic design]], [[film]], [[music]], [[video game industry|video game]], [[fashion]], [[advertising]], [[Mass media|media]], or [[Show business|entertainment]] industries, but may be useful in other creative organizations such as [[web development]] and [[software development]] firms as well.

A creative director is a vital role in all of the arts and entertainment industries. In another sense, they can be seen as another element in any product development process. The creative director may also assume the roles of an art director, copywriter, or lead designer. The responsibilities of a creative director include leading the communication design, interactive design, and concept forward in any work assigned. For example, this responsibility is often seen in industries related to advertisement. The creative director is known to guide a team of employees with skills and experience related to graphic design, fine arts, motion graphics, and other creative industry fields. Some example works can include visual layout, brainstorming, and copywriting. To assume the role of a creative director, one must already have an existing set of skills and expertise in many areas. Often, these types of artists start up from the very beginning in fields that can relate to motion graphics, advertisement in television, and/or book (or magazine) publishing.

==Communication design==

===Advertising===
In the advertising industry, a creative director is determined to develop various marketing schemes and strategies for a company or client that he or she is hired by. Assuming one is hired by a company that is fairly well known and established, there would be some type of creative department or management that the director would work with. The creative director would also serve as the project manager that works directly with employers, and in most circumstances, they would be responsible for designing concepts for advertisements and other promotional needs for their client(s). Some examples of their duties involve [[copywriting]] and laying out chronological advertisement plans which explain the ongoing process of a project. It is important for an advertisement creative director to meet their goals at specific deadline with maximum efficiency as possible. To do so, they must be able to guide the creative department effectively from start to finish. Educational requirements of this position involve a blending of skills in business and journalism. To even be considered as a creative director, one would need to have a couple of years of experience in advertising (as little as five to as many as ten years).&lt;ref&gt;"Advertising Creative Director Job Description, Salary, and Training Information." 300+ Job Descriptions: Find Your Dream Job in 2011. N.p., n.d. Web. 1 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://www.jobdescriptions.net/business/advertising-creative-director/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising creative directors are usually promoted from copy writing or art directing positions. Familiarity with film-making techniques is also common. Creative directors rise to become executive creative directors or chief creative officers, a position with executive responsibility for the entire creative department, and some progress to chairman of a firm.

Creative directors usually possess a [[communication design]] or [[fine art]]s &amp; animation degree. Copywriters may have degrees in [[journalism]], [[language arts]], or media innovation, or may develop more emphasis on advertising copy writing while pursuing a communication design degree.

==Video games==
{{main|Video game producer}}
With the increased team sizes and more specialised disciplines in the games industry, certain game designers are titled as 'creative director', 'executive designer', or 'game director'. A creative director in a video game company is usually responsible for product development across a number of titles and is generally regarded as the prime design authority across the company's product range. Some examples are [[Peter Molyneux]], [[Sam Lake]], [[Neil Druckmann]], or [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] whose influence extends across more than one project.

The creative director has an important responsibility in this industry. The director must devise ideas to lead a video game project forward and many responsibilities involve working with various individuals or teams spread out within the entire project/video game production. This can include cross-functional collaboration with the various disciplines involved in games development. Academically speaking, a creative director is usually degree educated but there are some circumstances where a high school education strongly focusing on aspects such as art, graphics, [[computer science]], and math can be acceptable and provide some valuable insight to students who hope to aspire in this field of work. Some skills that a creative director working in the video game industry may have include proficiency in [[computer programming]] and graphic development (illustrations, fine art) and have excellent interpersonal and writing skills (since they deal with many other clients and management leaders). The exact skills a game director possesses will depend on their background in the industry. Creative director, or game director, is not usually an entry level position, but in a smaller studio it can be. This is more common in start up companies for instance though normally one would have to earn that role by showing their skills and development over a period of years. The entertainment industry is not always a meritocracy, however, and sometimes people just luck into or inherit such positions. Creative directors have often done their share of lower level startup positions such as internships or assisting other directors in art related work fields. It is all about advancing through the career chain, and once one has earned the position a creative director, they may be eligible to work for larger and more popular game developing companies depending on how successful they have been with past collaborative projects.&lt;ref&gt;Careers in focus:computer and video game design. 2nd ed. New York: Ferguson, 2009. p.17-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==

{{Main|Production designer}}

The creative director in the film industry is referred to as the [[production designer]]. A production designer carries a large responsibility of designing the look of a movie. The job is similar to a creative director's role in the video game industry in that he or she manages a team of employees and has to consistently develop new ideas and methods of working. It is vital that designers in this field are able to produce expressive/creative ideas and translate them into something cinematic. Usually a certain sum of funds is distributed among different departments in the production of a film (in this case, the art department). Creative directors must decide on how to distribute and use the funds in the most efficient and effective way to ensure maximum quality in the films art department. An example can include the structuring of scenes and sets once a film begins to undergo the shooting process. During this process, it is important for creative directors to understand what props and effects should be used and how they should be used among various sets and scenes of the film. Some important qualifications that one should have include being able to manage teams, having expertise in design (specifically in theatre, interior sets and art design), being open minded to new ideas and methods in regards to organizing film sets, and having an understanding of coordinating among different departments in order to move a project towards success. A creative director in the film industry usually starts out in lower ranks of the chain, such as an assistant to other art directors and/or as a [[Drafter|draughtsman]].&lt;ref&gt;"Art Department – Skillset." Welcome to Skillset – Skillset. N.p., n.d. Web. 19 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.skillset.org/film/jobs/productiondesign&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
{{Main|Music director}}
Creative directors in the field of music can be broken down into various key roles that make up the whole (it may be said that one can be known as a 'music director'). It is in this artistic field where the individual, the director, must master tasks that are relatable to one another. An orchestral conductor is a prime example (but not exclusive) of this role and how one would direct music and harmonize symphonies as well as guide/direct other musician’s in an ensemble. The three roles in this sense can consist of: the active [[musician]], the musical art director, and the instructor that teaches and informs music for society. The main requirements one would need to have is an extensive background and knowledge of music (being able to master one or more instrument), understanding the principles and theories behind music composition, developing an understanding and connection with musicians that the director would be working with to communicate music in a harmonic and creative sense, and most importantly being able to develop leadership skills among other musicians.&lt;ref&gt;"Traits and Skills of a Music Director – League of American Orchestras."

==Fashion==
Creative director is the highest creative position in a [[Fashion design|fashion house]]. The creative director does not design clothes, but instead formulates and impresses upon the designers an overarching concept or concepts for a certain collection and the label as a whole. 
A fashion creative director's main role is to establish what designs should be created, what will appeal to the target market, and how the concepts will be applied and distributed in collaboration with fashion designers who are responsible for creating the clothing and fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;"Fashion Director: Inside Jobs."

The '''culture of [[Ethiopia]]''' is diverse and generally structured along ethnolinguistic lines. The country's [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]]-speaking majority adhere to an amalgamation of traditions that were developed independently and through interaction with neighbouring and far away civilizations, including other parts of [[Northeast Africa]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[India]], [[Italy]] and [[Malaysia]]. By contrast, the nation's [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] communities and other ethnolinguistic minorities tend to practice customs more closely linked with [[South Sudan]] and/or the [[African Great Lakes]] region.

==Music==
{{Main|Music of Ethiopia}}
The music of Ethiopia is extremely diverse, with each of the country's ethnic groups being associated with unique sounds. Some forms of traditional music are strongly influenced by [[folk music]] from elsewhere in the [[Horn of Africa]], especially [[Somalia]]. However, Ethiopian religious music also has an ancient [[Christian]] element, traced to Yared, who lived during the reign of Gabra Masqal. In northeastern Ethiopia, in [[Wollo]], a Muslim musical form called ''manzuma'' developed in 1907. Sung in [[Amharic language|Amharic]], manzuma has spread to [[Harar]] and [[Jimma]], where it is now sung in the [[Oromo language]]. In the Ethiopian Highlands, traditional secular music is played by itinerant musicians called ''azmari'' (Zageth), who are regarded with both suspicion and respect in Ethiopian society.

===Chordophones===
[[File:Seated man playing krar.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A ''[[krar]]'' player.]]
In the highlands, traditional string instruments include the ''[[masenqo]]'' (also known as masinko), a one-string bowed [[lute]]; the ''[[krar]]'' (also known as kirar), a six-string [[lyre]]; and the ''[[begena]]'', a large ten-string lyre. The ''dita'' (a five-string lyre) and musical bows (including an unusual three-string variant) are among the [[chordophone]]s found in the south. Also "kebero" ( a drum) used by the religious group like Orthodox's or other Christian religious group to praise what they believe in.

===Aerophones===
The [[washint]] is a [[bamboo]] [[flute]] that is common throughout or in the highlands. [[Trumpet]]-like instruments include the ceremonial ''[[Kakaki|malakat]]'' used in some regions, and the ''holdudwa'' (animal horn; compare shofar) found mainly in the south. Embilta flutes have no finger holes, and produce only two tones, the fundamental and a fourth or fifth interval. These may be metal (generally found in the north) or bamboo (in the south). The Konso and other people in the south play fanta, or [[pan flute]]s.

===Idiophones===
In the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], liturgical music employs the senasel, a [[sistrum]]. Additionally, the clergy will use prayer staffs, or ''maqwamiya'', to maintain rhythm. Rural churches historically used a ''dawal'', made from stone slabs or pieces of wood, in order to call the faithful to prayer. The [[Beta Israel]] use a small [[gong]] called a ''qachel'' as liturgical accompaniment, though qachel may also refer to a small bell. The toom, a [[lamellophone]], is used among the [[Nuer people|Nuer]], [[Anuak people|Anuak]], [[Majangir]], [[Surma people|Surma]], and other Nilo-Saharan groups. Metal leg rattles are common throughout the south.

===Membranophones===
The kebero (ከበሮ) is a large hand [[drum]] used in the Orthodox Christian liturgy. Smaller kebero drums may be used in secular celebrations. The ''nagarit'' (ነጋሪት), played with a curved stick, is usually found in a secular context such as royal functions or the announcement of proclamations, though it has a liturgical function among the Beta Israel. The Gurage and other southern peoples commonly play the ''atamo'', a small hand drum sometimes made of clay.

===Popular music===
Ethiopia is a musically traditional country. Popular music is played, recorded and listened to, but most musicians also sing traditional songs, and most audiences choose to listen to both popular and traditional styles. A long-standing popular musical tradition in Ethiopia was that of brass bands, imported from [[Jerusalem]] in the form of forty Armenian orphans (Arba Lijoch) during the reign of [[Haile Selassie]]. This band, which arrived in [[Addis Ababa]] on September 6, 1924, became the first official orchestra of Ethiopia. By the end of [[World War II]], large orchestras accompanied singers; the most prominent orchestras were the Army Band, Police Band, and Imperial Bodyguard Band. Most of these bands were trained by Europeans or Armenians.

From the 1950s to the 1970s, Ethiopian popular musicians included [[Bizunesh Bekele (singer)|Bizunesh Bekele]], [[Mahmoud Ahmed]], [[Alemayehu Eshete]], Hirut Bekele, [[Ali Birra]], Ayalew Mesfin, [[Kiros Alemayehu]], [[Muluken Melesse]] and [[Tilahun Gessesse]], while popular folk musicians included [[Alemu Aga]], Kassa Tessema, Ketema Makonnen, [[Asnaketch Worku]], and Mary Armede. Perhaps the most influential musician of the period, however, was Ethio-jazz innovator [[Mulatu Astatke]]. Amha Records, Kaifa Records, and Philips-Ethiopia were prominent Ethiopian record labels during this era. Since 1997, [[Buda Musique]]'s ''[[Éthiopiques]]'' series has compiled many of these singles and albums on compact disc.

During the 1980s, the Derg controlled Ethiopia, and emigration became almost impossible. Musicians during this period included Ethio Stars, Wallias Band and Roha Band, though the singer [[Neway Debebe]] was most popular. He helped to popularize the use of [[Qene|Sem ena Worq]] (wax and gold, a poetic form of double entendre) in music (previously only used in qiné, or poetry) that often enabled singers to criticize the government without upsetting the censors.

===Contemporary scene===
[[File:Aster Aweke.jpeg|thumb|right|Popular Ethiopian singer [[Aster Aweke]].]]
Popular musicians from Ethiopia include internationally renowned and recognized artists such as the [[Los Angeles]]–area expatriate [[Aster Aweke]], [[The Weeknd]] and [[Teddy Afro]], who is often accredited with the fusion of [[Rastafarian]] styles into mainstream Ethiopian music.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10819101&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, music from [[Tigray Region|Tigray]] and [[Eritrea]] has become popular in Ethiopia and among exiles, especially in [[Italy]]. One of the biggest new trends, however, has been the rise of bolel, a sort of [[blues]]-like music, played by sarcastic azmari playing in parts of Addis Ababa, especially Yohannès Sefer and Kazentchis. Bolel musicians include Tigist Assefa, Tedje and Admassou Abate.

Currently the most prominent Ethiopian singer internationally is [[Gigi (singer)|Gigi]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Through her performing with top jazz musicians such as [[Bill Laswell]] (who is also her husband) and [[Herbie Hancock]], Gigi has brought Ethiopian music to popular attention, especially in the [[United States]], where she now lives.

Other popular performers include Tewodros Tadesse, Neway Debebe, [[Tadesse Alemu]], Hamelmal Abate, Martha Ashagari, Yohannes Berhanu, [[Kuku Sebsebe]], [[Aster Aweke]], and Manalemosh Dibo. Neway was very popular among the youth of the 1980s and early 1990s with such songs as "Yetekemt Abeba," "Metekatun Ateye," "Safsaf," and "Gedam," among others. Abatte Barihun has exemplified all four main qenets on his 2005 album Ras Deshen.

''[[Éthiopiques]]'' producer [[Francis Falceto]] criticizes contemporary Ethiopian music for eschewing traditional instruments and ensemble playing in favor of one-man bands using [[synthesizers]]. Harvard University professor Kay Kaufman Shelemay, on the other hand, maintains that there is genuine creativity in the contemporary music scene. She further points out that Ethiopian music is not alone in shifting to electronically produced music, a point that Falceto acknowledges.

==Clothing==
[[File:Azeb and Meseret.jpg|thumb|right|[[Habesha people|Habesha]] women in urban wear]]
In some central and northern areas, women's traditional clothes are often made from cloth called ''shemma''. It is basically cotton cloth, about 90&amp;nbsp;cm wide, woven in long strips which are then sewn together. Sometimes shiny threads are woven into the fabric for an elegant effect. It takes about two to three weeks to make enough cloth for one dress. The bottom of the garment or shirt may be ornamented with patterns.
[[File:Dmitri-Markine-Hamer.jpg|thumb|left|[[Omotic languages|Omotic]] [[Hamar people|Hamar]] women wearing their traditional attire]]
Men wear pants and a knee-length shirt with a white collar, and perhaps a sweater. They also frequently wear knee-high socks, while women might not wear socks at all. Men as well as women wear shawls, the ''[[netela]]''. The shawls are worn in a different style for different occasions. When going to church, women cover their hair with them and pull the upper ends of the shawl about their shoulders reproducing a cross (''meskelya''), with the shiny threads appearing at the edge. During funerals, the shawl is worn so the shiny threads appear at the bottom (''madegdeg''). Women's dresses are called ''[[habesha kemis]]'', and are often made from the shemma cloth. The dresses are usually white with some color above the lower hem. [[Bracelets]] and [[necklaces]] of [[silver]] or [[gold]] are worn on arms and feet to complete the look. A variety of designer dinner dresses combining traditional fabric with modern style are now worn by some ladies in the cities.

These traditional clothes are still worn on a day-to-day-basis in the countryside. In cities and towns, western clothes are popular. However, on special occasions such as [[New Year]] (''[[Enkutatash]]''), [[Christmas]] (''Genna'') or weddings, some wear traditional clothes.

Often, a woman will cover her head with a ''shash'', a cloth that is tied at the neck. ''Shama'' and ''[[Kuta (clothing)|kuta]]'', gauze-like white fabrics, are often used.&lt;ref&gt;Dera Fitsum Medhane. "[http://www.tsc.sa.edu.au/napwebpages/FitsumswebPage/Clothes.html Clothing in Ethiopia]." Accessed on July 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This is common among both Muslim and Christian women. Elderly women will wear a sash on a day-to-day basis, while other women only wear a sash also called a ''netela'' while attending church.

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Ethiopian cuisine}}
[[File:Ethcofcerm.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An Ethiopian woman preparing Ethiopian [[coffee]] at a [[Coffee ceremony|traditional ceremony]]. She roasts, crushes and brews the coffee on the spot.]]
The [[Ethiopian cuisine]] consists of various [[vegetable]] or [[meat]] side dishes and entrees, often prepared as a ''[[Wat (food)|wat]]'' or thick stew. One or more servings of wat are placed upon a piece of [[injera]], a large sourdough flatbread, which is 50&amp;nbsp;cm (20&amp;nbsp;inches) in diameter and made out of fermented [[teff]] flour. One does not eat with utensils, but instead uses injera (always with the right hand) to scoop up the entrees and side dishes. Traditional Ethiopian food does not use any [[pork]] or [[seafood]] (aside from fish), as most Ethiopians have historically adhered to [[Islam]], the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], or [[Judaism]], all of which prohibit eating pork. Additionally, throughout a given year, Orthodox Christians observe numerous [[Fasting|fasts]] (such as [[Lent]]), during which food is prepared without any meat or [[dairy products]]. Another dish served in Ethiopia is [[Doro wat]], which is [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] stew with [[hard boiled eggs]].

==Sports==
{{Main|Sports in Ethiopia}}
[[Track and field]] is Ethiopia's most successful sport, in which they have won many medals in the [[Olympic Games]]. [[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Ethiopia. Despite lack of success by the [[Ethiopia national football team|national team]], it is supported by a significant part of the population.

==Media==
{{Main|Media of Ethiopia}}
[[Radio]] and [[television]] are under the control of the Ethiopian government. There are nine radio broadcast stations, eight AM and one shortwave, licensed to operate. The major radio broadcasting stations (all AM) are [[Radio Ethiopia]], Radio Torch (pirate), Radio Voice of One Free Ethiopia, and the Voice of the Revolution of Tigray. The single television broadcast network is [[Ethiopian Television]]. In keeping with government policy, radio broadcasts occur in a variety of languages. Print media, because of high poverty levels, low literacy rates, and poor distribution outside of the capital, serve only a small portion of the population. Major daily newspapers include ''[[Addis Zemen (newspaper)|Addis Zemen]]'', the ''Daily Monitor'', and the ''Ethiopian Herald''. There is also a small but lively film industry.

English is the most widely spoken foreign language and is the medium of instruction in secondary schools.

In terms of [[writing system]]s, Ethiopia's principal orthography is [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ge'ez]] or Ethiopic. Employed as an [[abugida]] for several of the country's languages, it first came into usage in the 6th and 5th centuries BC as an [[abjad]] to transcribe the Semitic [[Ge'ez language]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodolfo Fattovich, "Akkälä Guzay" in Uhlig, Siegbert, ed.

Other writing systems have also been used over the years by different Ethiopian communities. The latter include Sheikh [[Bakri Sapalo]]'s script for Oromo.&lt;ref name=HH-551&gt;Hayward and Hassan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/616613 "The Oromo Orthography of Shaykh Bakri Saṗalō", ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies''], 44 (1981), p. 551&lt;/ref&gt;

The neurological nature and underlying causes of dyslexia are an active area of research, and the distinction of dyslexia as a condition is a topic of some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9752.2008.00653.x|title = Does Dyslexia Exist?|journal = Journal of Philosophy of Education|volume = 42|issue = 3–4|pages = 475–491|year = 2008|last1 = Elliott|first1 = Julian G|last2 = Gibbs|first2 = Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
{{main|History of dyslexia research}}
Dyslexia was first identified by Oswald Berkhan in 1881,&lt;ref&gt;BERKHAN O. Neur. Zent 28 1917&lt;/ref&gt; and the term 'dyslexia' later coined in 1887 by [[Rudolf Berlin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rudolf Berlin: Originator of the term dyslexia |journal=Annals of Dyslexia|date=January 1973|first=Rudolph|last=Wagner|volume=23|issue= 1 |pages=57–63|doi= 10.1007/BF02653841}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[ophthalmologist]] practicing in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
|title = Uber Dyslexie | journal = Archiv für Psychiatrie | volume = 15| pages = 276–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the twentieth century, dyslexia was primarily seen as a [[phonological deficit]] (specifically phonological awareness) that resulted in a reading deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christo, Catherine|author2=John M. Davis|author3=Stephen E. Brock|title=Identifying, Assessing, and Treating Dyslexia at School.|year=2009|publisher=New York: Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ott, Philomena|title=Teaching Children with Dyslexia: A Practical Guide.|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|ISBN= 978-0415324540}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reid, Gavin|title=The Routledge Companion to Dyslexia|year=2012|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|ISBN=978-0415430784}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyslexia was seen as an issue with reading achievement specifically, caused by deficits in discrimination of written word sounds as opposed to a broader disorder of brain function. However, much research from the 1990s onward has focused on the potential biological bases of dyslexia and understanding dyslexia as a disorder of brain function. One of the first weaknesses of the strictly phonological deficit hypothesis for dyslexia was its inability to account for the genetic link of dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Reading Disability Research.|author1=McGill-Franzen|first=Anne|author2=Allington|first2=Richard L.|publisher=New York: Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0805853346|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it's been shown that "Relatively high heritabilities were observed for both reading ability and dyslexia indicating substantial genetic influences."&lt;ref name=PractHandbook/&gt; In a large twin study (sample 1031 twins), Gayan and Olson established that dyslexia was highly heritable, while a family study by Pennington (sample 1698 individuals) showed familial risk rates of 35-45%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Olson, RK|title=Reading Disability: Evidence for a Genetic Etiology|journal=European Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=8|pages=52–55|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=1991|title=Evidence for Major Gene Transmission of Developmental Dyslexia|url=|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=266|issue=11|pages=1527–1534|doi=10.1001/jama.1991.03470110073036|pmid=1880884|via=|vauthors=Pennington BF, Gilger JW, Pauls D, Smith SA, Smith SD, DeFries JC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Without a biological explanation for dyslexia, this heritability went unexplained. Not only must the heritability be explained, but also the environmental factors that protected at-risk children from developing dyslexia. Research began to focus on potential biological causes and to center the study of dyslexia in a developmental framework. A second major weakness of the strictly phonological deficit hypothesis was its strict definition of dyslexia as a reading disorder. Consequently, the various secondary symptoms were unable to be explained, including automatization deficits of both skill and knowledge acquisition, balance impairments, motor skill/writing deficits, and muscle tone underdevelopment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; New theories of dyslexia began to be a focus of research, with the most well established being the [[biological theories of dyslexia|magnocellular deficit theory]] the [[biological theories of dyslexia|automatization deficit theory]], and the double-deficit hypothesis.&lt;ref name=PractHandbook&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reid, Gavin,|title= Dyslexia: A Practitioner's Handbook.|year=2016|publisher=Chichester : Wiley Blackwell|isbn=978-0470760406}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=April 2018}}

==Theories==
Theories of the [[etiology]] of dyslexia have and are evolving with each new generation of dyslexia researchers, and the more recent theories of dyslexia tend to enhance one or more of the older theories as understanding of the nature of dyslexia evolves.

Theories should not be viewed as competing, but as attempting to explain the underlying causes of a similar set of symptoms from a variety of research perspectives and background.&lt;ref name=theories&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ramus F, Rosen S, Dakin SC |title=Theories of developmental dyslexia: insights from a multiple case study of dyslexic adults |journal=Brain |volume=126 |issue=4 |pages=841–65 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12615643 |doi=10.1093/brain/awg076 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12615643 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Nicolson RI, Fawcett AJ |title=Procedural learning difficulties: reuniting the developmental disorders? |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=135–41 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17328970 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2007.02.003 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cerebellar theory===
The '''cerebellar theory of dyslexia'''  asserts that the cause of dyslexia is an abnormality in the [[cerebellum]] (a region in the back of the brain), which in turn cause disruption in normal development, which causes issues with motor control, balance, working memory, attention, automatization, and ultimately, reading.&lt;ref name=Mody2008&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mody|author2=Sillman|title=Brain, Behavior, and Learning in Language and Reading Disorders|year=2008|publisher=London : The Guilford Press|isbn = 978-1593858315}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=April 2018}}   This theory was initially proposed by [[Harold Levinson]] and Jan Frank in 1973 and further developed by Levinson and other researchers. Angela Fawcett and Rod Nicolson later proposed that the [[cerebellum]] contributes to motor control during the [[Manner of articulation|articulation of speech]], and that articulation problems can contribute to the [[phonological]] processing deficits that can cause dyslexia. They also reasoned that the cerebellum contributes to the automatisation of learned behaviors, which may include learning the [[grapheme]]-[[phoneme]] relationships when reading text.&lt;ref name=Stoodley2009&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Stoodley CJ, Stein JF |title=The cerebellum and dyslexia |journal=Cortex |volume= 47|issue= 1|pages= 101–16|date=October 2009 |pmid=20060110 |doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2009.10.005 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FNSage&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Reid, Gavin|title=The SAGE Handbook of Dyslexia|year=2013|isbn=9781412945134|chapter=Chapter 4:Dyslexia and the Cerebellum|first1=Angela J.|last1=Fawcett|first2=Roderick I.|last2=Nicolson}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84}}


In attempting to explain all the many known reading and non-reading dyslexic symptoms, therapies and theories as well as the presence of only cerebellar and related vestibular neurophysiological signs in dyslexics, the cerebellum was postulated to coordinate in time and space all signals (visual, auditory, tactile, proprioceptive, motion) entering and leaving the brain as well as signal interconnections. The quality and severity of the many symptoms characterizing each dyslexic was reasoned to depend on the diverse cerebral cortical and other brain processors receiving scrambled signals due to a cerebellar dysfunction. Helpful therapies were reasoned to enhance cerebellar fine tuning (e.g., the use of cerebellar-vestibular stabilizing antimotion sickness medications) and/or improve descrambling and other compensatory cognitive capabilities (e.g., tutoring, biofeedback). Most other theories equate the dyslexia disorder with impaired reading comprehension and so attempt to only explain the latter. Another cerebellar proposal indicated that articulation problems can contribute to the phonological deficits that can cause dyslexia. The cerebellum also contributes to the automitisation of learned behaviors, which can include learning the grapheme-phoneme relationships when reading texts.&lt;ref name=Stoodley2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;

However, some have suggested that cerebellar dysfunction alone may not be a primary cause of dyslexia and that dysarticulation and phonological deficits appear unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Irannejad, S.  |author2=Savage, R. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Is a cerebellar deficit the underlying cause of reading difficulties?|journal=Annals of Dyslexia|year=2012|volume=62|pages=22–52|doi=10.1007/s11881-011-0060-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stoodley|first=Catherine J.|author2=Stein, John F.|title=Cerebellar Function in Developmental Dyslexia|journal=The Cerebellum|date=1 August 2012|doi=10.1007/s12311-012-0407-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ramus |first1=F. |last2=Pidgeon |first2=E. |last3=Frith |first3=U. |title=The relationship between motor control and phonology in dyslexic children |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |year=2003|doi=10.1111/1469-7610.00157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary hypothesis===
This theory considers that reading is an unnatural act carried out for a very brief period in human evolutionary history. It has only been in the last hundred years that reading a visual form of speech has been promoted as a major form of communication, and subsequently a lack of time for reading behaviors to evolve. In many societies around the world the majority of the population do not use the visual notation of speech as a form of communication and do not use reading skills, and therefore have no dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Dalby JT |title=An ultimate view of reading ability |journal=The International Journal of Neuroscience |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=227–30 |date=September 1986 |pmid=3759349 |doi=10.3109/00207458608985671 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many developmental dyslexics significantly compensate for their cerebellar-vestibular
determined symptoms and signs over time and most normal young children evidence age-appropriate "dyslexic-like" symptoms and cerebellar-vestibular(CV) "immaturities." It was thus hypothesized that genetic dyslexia may represent an [[ontogenetic]] [[recapitulation theory|recapitulation]] of a pre-reading state in [[phylogeny]] and that [[ontogeny]] extended beyond the embryo into childhood and occasionally beyond, thus perhaps explaining late and even late-late blooming.&lt;ref name="Levinson2"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Levinson |first=H.N. |title=The discovery of cerebellar-vestibular syndromes and therapies, a solution to the riddle dyslexia |location=New York |publisher=Springer-Verlag; Stonebridge Publishing |pages=99–100 |year=2000 |isbn=0963930311}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of reading and related writing and spelling functioning, as well as the corresponding ontogenetic CV-cerebral developmental lag hypothesis of dyslexia, is indirectly supported by studies suggesting that "the cerebellum has enlarged between three and fourfold in [only] the past million years of evolution [together with a corresponding spurt of the cerebrum]."&lt;ref name="Linas"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Linas |first=R. |year=1975 |title=The cortex of the cerebellum |journal=Scientific American |volume=232 |pages=56–71 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0175-56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palay"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Palay |first1=S.L. |last2=Chan-Palay |first2=V. |year=1974 |title=Cerebellar Cortex: Cytology and Organization |location=New York |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=9780387062280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnocellular theory===
The Magnocellular theory attempts to unify the Cerebellar Theory, the Phonological Theory, the Rapid Auditory Processing Theory, and the Visual Theory.  The Magnocellular theory proposes that the [[magnocellular part|magnocellular]] dysfunction is not only restricted to the visual pathways but also includes auditory and tactile [[Stimulus modality|modalities]].&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ray NJ, Fowler S, Stein JF |title=Yellow filters can improve magnocellular function: motion sensitivity, convergence, accommodation, and reading |journal=Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. |volume=1039 |issue= |pages=283–93 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15826982 |doi=10.1196/annals.1325.027 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2010, studies of [[Evoked_potential#Visual_evoked_potential|visual evoked potentials]] have generally supported this theory.  While some studies of contrast sensitivity have supported it. Subjects' age (10-46), differences in experimental design, small sample sizes (&lt;10 dyslexic subjects in prominent studies), and the presence, absence, or failure to assess for comorbid ADHD might explain these contradictory findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schulte-Körne|first=Gerd|author2=Bruder, Jennifer|title=Clinical neurophysiology of visual and auditory processing in dyslexia: A review|journal=Clinical Neurophysiology|date=1 November 2010|volume=121|issue=11|pages=1794–1809|doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2010.04.028|pmid=20570212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming speed deficit and double deficit theories===
The speed with which an individual can engage in the [[rapid automatized naming]] of familiar objects or letters is a strong predictor of dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Denckla MB, Rudel RG |title=Rapid "automatized" naming (R.A.N): dyslexia differentiated from other learning disabilities |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=471–9 |year=1976 |pmid=995240 |doi=10.1016/0028-3932(76)90075-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slow naming speed can be identified as early as kindergarten and persists in adults with dyslexia.

A deficit in naming speed is hypothesized to represent a deficit that is separate from phonological processing deficit. Wolf identified four types of readers: readers with no deficits, readers with phonological processing deficit, readers with naming speed deficit, and readers with double deficit (that is, problems both with phonological processing and naming speed). Students with double deficits are most likely to have some sort of severe reading impairment.

Distinguishing among these deficits has important implications for instructional intervention. If students with double deficits receive instruction only in phonological processing, they are only receiving part of what they need.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Birsh |first=Judith R. |year=2005 |chapter=Alphabet knowledge: letter recognition, naming and sequencing |editor=Judith R. Birsh |title=Multisensory Teaching of Basic Language Skills |page=119 |publisher=Paul H. Brookes Publishing |location=Baltimore, Maryland |isbn=978-1-55766-676-5 | oclc = 234335596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceptual visual-noise exclusion hypothesis===
The concept of a [[Perceptual noise exclusion hypothesis|perceptual noise exclusion]] deficit (impaired filtering of behaviorally irrelevant visual information in dyslexia or visual-noise) is an emerging hypothesis, supported by research showing that subjects with dyslexia experience difficulty in performing visual tasks (such as motion detection in the presence of perceptual distractions) but do not show the same impairment when the distracting factors are removed in an experimental setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Sperling AJ, Lu ZL, Manis FR, Seidenberg MS |title=Motion-perception deficits and reading impairment: it's the noise, not the motion |journal=Psychological Science |volume=17 |issue=12 |pages=1047–53 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17201786 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01825.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Roach NW, Hogben JH |title=Impaired filtering of behaviourally irrelevant visual information in dyslexia |journal=Brain |volume=130 |issue=3 |pages=771–85 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17237361 |doi=10.1093/brain/awl353 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17237361 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers have analogized their findings concerning visual discrimination tasks to findings in other research related to auditory discrimination tasks. They assert that dyslexic symptoms arise because of an impaired ability to filter out both visual and auditory distractions, and to categorize information so as to distinguish the important sensory data from the irrelevant.&lt;ref name=Sperling2005&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Sperling AJ, Lu ZL, Manis FR, Seidenberg MS |title=Deficits in perceptual noise exclusion in developmental dyslexia |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=862–3 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15924138 |doi=10.1038/nn1474 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonological deficit theory===
The [[phonological deficit]] theory proposes that people with dyslexia have a specific sound manipulation impairment, which affects their auditory memory, word recall, and sound association skills when processing speech. The phonological theory explains a reading impairment when using an [[alphabetic]] writing system which requires learning the [[grapheme]]/[[phoneme]] correspondence, the relationship between the graphic letter symbols and  speech sounds which they represent.&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;

===Rapid auditory processing theory===
The rapid auditory processing theory is an alternative to the phonological deficit theory, which specifies that the primary deficit lies in the perception of short or rapidly varying sounds. Support for this theory arises from evidence that people with dyslexia show poor performance on a number of auditory tasks, including frequency discrimination and temporal order judgment.&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;

===Visual theory===
The visual theory represents a traditional perspective of dyslexia, as being the result of a visual impairment creating problems when processing information from letters and words from a written text. This includes visual processing problems such as [[binocular vision|binocular]], poor [[vergence]], and visual crowding. The Visual Theory does not deny the possibility of alternative causes of dyslexia&lt;ref name=theories/&gt;

==Research==
Various methods and models have been used to study dyslexia.

===Genetics===
High genetic concordance found in [[twin studies]] suggest a significant genetic influence on reading ability, although the degree depends on the definition of dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olson|first=RK|title=Dyslexia: nature and nurture|journal=Dyslexia|year=2002|volume=8|issue=3|pages=143–159|doi=10.1002/dys.228|pmid=12222731}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linkage analysis]] and [[genetic association]] studies (typically [[quantitative trait locus]] association studies, which use [[microarrays]] to look at [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] of multiple genes at once) have been used to identify [[candidate gene]]s that may be implicated in dyslexia, which have then been confirmed in various [[Knockout mouse|knockout models]].&lt;ref name=Guidi2018/&gt;

As of 2018 the leading candidate genes included [[DYX1C1]] on [[chromosome 15]], [[DCDC2]] and [[KIAA0319]] on [[chromosome 6]], and [[ROBO1]] on [[chromosome 3]].&lt;ref name=Guidi2018/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shastry" &gt;{{Cite journal|author=Shastry BS |title=Developmental dyslexia: an update |journal=J.

However, these genes account for a small proportion of variance in reading disability, often less than 0.5%.{{mcn|date=November 2018}} Additionally, the findings are not always replicated nor consistently supported by genome-wide association studies.&lt;ref name=Guidi2018/&gt; Therefore, no single gene is definitively implicated in dyslexia. A 2007 review reported that no specific cognitive processes are known to be influenced by the proposed genes and that scientists had begun to include [[neurophysiological]] (e.g., event-related potential) and imaging (e.g., functional [[MRI]]) procedures in their [[phenotype]] characterisation of people with dyslexia.&lt;ref name=Schumacher2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schumacher2007&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schumacher J, Hoffmann P, Schmäl C, Schulte-Körne G, Nöthen MM |title=Genetics of dyslexia: the evolving landscape |journal=[[Journal of Medical Genetics]] |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=289–97 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17307837 |pmc=2597981 |doi=10.1136/jmg.2006.046516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely that multiple genes, as well as the environment, interact to influence reading ability. The [[Generalist Genes Hypothesis]] proposes that many of the same genes are implicated within different aspects of a learning disability as well as between different learning disabilities. Indeed, there also appear to be a large genetic influence on other learning abilities, such as language skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stromswold|first=Karin|title=The Heritability of Language: A Review and Metaanalysis of Twin, Adoption, and Linkage Studies.|journal=Language|date=December 2001|volume=77|issue=4|pages=647–723|doi=10.1353/lan.2001.0247}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Generalist Genes Hypothesis supports the findings that many learning disabilities are [[comorbid]], such as [[speech sound disorder]], language impairment, and reading disability, although this is also influenced by diagnostic overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pennington BF, Bishop DVM |title= Relations Among Speech, Language, and Reading Disorders |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |year= 2009|volume=60 |pages=283–306|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163548|pmid= 18652545 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neuroimaging ===
[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[diffusion tensor imaging]] (DTI) are the main [[neuroimaging]] methods used to study brain structure in people with dyslexia, and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) along with [[EEG]] are used to study brain function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soriano-Ferrer |first1=M |last2=Piedra Martínez |first2=E |title=A review of the neurobiological basis of dyslexia in the adult population. |journal=Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain) |date=undefined NaN |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=50-57 |doi=10.1016/j.nrl.2014.08.003 |pmid=25444408}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual processing ===
Visual processes constitute an important part of higher cortical functioning.&lt;ref name="Vellutino 2–40"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vellutino|first=Frank R.|author2=Fletcher, Jack M. |author3=Snowling, Margaret J. |author4=Scanlon, Donna M. |title=Specific reading disability (dyslexia): what have we learned in the past four decades?|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|date=1 January 2004|volume=45|issue=1|pages=2–40|doi=10.1046/j.0021-9630.2003.00305.x|pmid=14959801}}&lt;/ref&gt; The encoding and interpretation of retinal stimulation occur at the neurological level upon reception of afferent input from the eyes. Reading, for example, requires the possession of both adequate vision and the neurological ability to process what is seen. In the past, many researchers have associated anomalies in the visual system as the main cause of dyslexia. While acknowledging that most such theories are untenable, visual system deficits have been shown to contribute to symptoms of dyslexia, such as word reversal and skipping words.&lt;ref name="Vellutino 2–40"/&gt;

A small subset of dyslexic individuals have been demonstrated to have deficits in the magnocellular visual system.&lt;ref name="Stein 12–36"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stein|first=John|title=The magnocellular theory of developmental dyslexia|journal=Dyslexia|date=1 January 2001|volume=7|issue=1|pages=12–36|doi=10.1002/dys.186|pmid=11305228}}&lt;/ref&gt; A compromised magnocellular system, responsible for the processing of images with high temporal frequencies and high degree of movement, might be the main contributing factor to the reported "masking" of words reported amongst dyslexic individuals.&lt;ref name="Stein 12–36"/&gt; Researchers posit that such a "masking" effect is due to the abnormal longevity of the visual trace produced in the magnocellular system, resulting in a lapse in acuity as effected individuals attempt to process connected text.&lt;ref name="Vellutino 2–40"/&gt; 

Anomalies in saccadic movement, which are instantaneous, fast, oscillating eye movements essential for unimpaired reading have been observed in people with dyslexia. When corrected for reading ability, dyslexic individuals demonstrate below normal saccadic eye movements, suggesting that the severity reading disorders may be due to oculo-motor deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olitsky|first=SE|author2=Nelson, LB |title=Reading disorders in children.|journal=Pediatric Clinics of North America|date=February 2003|volume=50|issue=1|pages=213–24|pmid=12713114|doi=10.1016/s0031-3955(02)00104-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, further examination of the phenomenon shows that saccadic patterns in dyslexics seem to be a result and not the cause of the disorder, as decoding and comprehension failure were isolated as the antecedent for impairments in both the speed and accuracy with which dyslexics read. Also, there is no evidence that children with oculomotor impariments are at risk of developing dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hodgetts|first=DJ |author2=Simon, JW |author3=Sibila, TA |author4=Scanlon, DM |author5=Vellutino, FR|title=Normal reading despite limited eye movements.|journal=Journal of AAPOS|date=June 1998|volume=2|issue=3|pages=182–3|pmid=10532756|doi=10.1016/S1091-8531(98)90011-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also suspected are convergence insufficiency and poor accommodation, both of which are uncommon in children, can interfere with the physical act of reading but not with decoding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Granet|first=D. B.|author2=Castro, E. F. |author3=Gomi, C.

=== Language processing ===
Brain activation studies using PET to study language have found that people with dyslexia have a deficit in parts of the left hemisphere of the brain involved in reading, which includes the [[inferior frontal gyrus]], [[inferior parietal lobule]], and middle and [[Brodmann area 20|ventral temporal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16925477 |doi=10.1207/s15326942dn3001_5 |year=2006 |last1=Shaywitz |first1=BA |last2=Lyon |first2=GR |last3=Shaywitz |first3=SE |title=The role of functional magnetic resonance imaging in understanding reading and dyslexia |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=613–32 |journal=Developmental Neuropsychology}}&lt;/ref&gt; A neural basis for the visual [[lexicon]] and for auditory verbal [[short term memory]] components have been proposed. [[Wernicke's area|Wernicke's]] and [[Broca's area]]s are being recast in terms of localized components of [[phonological]] input and output. Some classical regions, such as the [[arcuate fasciculus]], are having their "classical" roles questioned, while other regions, such as the basal temporal language zone, are growing progressively in terms of their recognized importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9059757 |year=1997 |last1=Chertkow |first1=H |last2=Murtha |first2=S |title=PET activation and language |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=78–86 |journal=Clinical Neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update-inline|date=November 2018}}

===Working memory ===
People with dyslexia have been commonly associated with working memory deficits, along with reduced activity in the pre-frontal and parietal cortex.&lt;ref name=Berninger2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berninger|first=Virginia W. |author2=Raskind, Wendy |author3=Richards, Todd |author4=Abbott, Robert |author5=Stock, Pat|title=A Multidisciplinary Approach to Understanding Developmental Dyslexia Within Working-Memory Architecture: Genotypes, Phenotypes, Brain, and Instruction|journal=Developmental Neuropsychology|date=5 November 2008|volume=33|issue=6|pages=707–744|doi=10.1080/87565640802418662|pmid=19005912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observed differences in the neural pattern of people with dyslexia, namely decreased activation in the left &lt;ref name="Wager 255–74"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wager|first=TD|author2=Smith, EE |title=Neuroimaging studies of working memory: a meta-analysis.|journal=Cognitive, Affective &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience|date=December 2003|volume=3|issue=4|pages=255–74|pmid=15040547|doi=10.3758/cabn.3.4.255}}&lt;/ref&gt; and posterior &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vasic|first=N|author2=Lohr, C |author3=Steinbrink, C |author4=Martin, C |author5=Wolf, RC |title=Neural correlates of working memory performance in adolescents and young adults with dyslexia.|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=2008-01-31|volume=46|issue=2|pages=640–8|pmid=17950764|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; midfrontal gyrus (LMG, PMG) and superior parietial regions of the brain further supports the view that deficits in working memory contribute to dyslexia. LMG and PMG are commonly associated with working memory processes such as memory updating and temporal order memory.&lt;ref name="Wager 255–74"/&gt; Behavioral experiments in dyslexia have largely been supportive of the mediating role assumed by working memory between neurological abnormalities and dyslexic behavior.&lt;ref name="Nicolson 508–11"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nicolson|first=RI |author2=Fawcett, AJ |author3=Dean, P|title=Developmental dyslexia: the cerebellar deficit hypothesis.|journal=Trends in Neurosciences|date=September 2001|volume=24|issue=9|pages=508–11|pmid=11506881|doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(00)01896-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
It is difficult to control for [[confounder]]s when attempting to isolate specific causes; for example, the response to instructions by children is itself confounded by a subjects' environments, genetics and socio-economic status.&lt;ref name=Berninger2008/&gt;

==Controversy==

In recent years there has been significant debate on the categorization of dyslexia. In particular, Elliot and Gibbs argue that "attempts to distinguish between categories of 'dyslexia' and 'poor reader' or 'reading disabled' are scientifically unsupportable, arbitrary and thus potentially discriminatory".&lt;ref name='Elliot1'&gt;{{Cite journal

While acknowledging that reading disability is a valid scientific curiosity, and that "seeking greater understanding of the relationship between visual symbols and spoken language is crucial" and that while there was "potential of genetics and neuroscience for guiding assessment and educational practice at some stage in the future", they conclude that "there is a mistaken belief that current knowledge in these fields is sufficient to justify a category of dyslexia as a subset of those who encounter reading difficulties".

''The Dyslexia Myth'' is a documentary that first aired in September 2005 as part of the ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' series produced by British broadcaster [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/microsites/D/dyslexia_myth/
 |title=The Dyslexia Myth
 |work=Dispatches
 |publisher=Channel 4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing only on the reading difficulties that people with dyslexia encounter the documentary says that myths and misconceptions surround dyslexia. It argues that the common understanding of dyslexia is not only false but makes it more difficult to provide the reading help that hundreds of thousands of children desperately need. Drawing on years of intensive academic research on both sides of the Atlantic, it challenged the existence of dyslexia as a separate condition, and highlighted the many different forms of reading styles.

Julian Elliot, an educational psychologist at [[Durham University]] in the United Kingdom, disputes the characterization of dyslexia as a medical condition, and believes it should be treated simply as a reading difficulty.&lt;ref name='Elliot1' /&gt; According to Elliot, "Parents don’t want their child to be considered lazy, thick or stupid. If they get called this medically diagnosed term, dyslexic, then it is a signal to all that it’s not to do with intelligence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

He feels that resources are wasted on diagnosis and testing, and favors early intervention programs for all struggling readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

John Everatt of the [[University of Surrey]] 2007, has suggested that:- 
*dyslexic students can be distinguished from other children with low reading achievement by testing geared to assessing their strengths as well as weaknesses
*dyslexic children tend to score significantly better than other children, including non-impaired children, on tests of creativity, [[spatial memory]], and [[spatial reasoning]]
*dyslexic children also perform better than other reading-impaired children on tests of vocabulary and listening comprehension
*dyslexic children may be better served by educational intervention which includes strategies geared to their unique strengths in addition to skill remediation
and thus recommends more comprehensive evaluation and targeted interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''East West Theatre Company''' (Bosnian: East West Centar) was established in 2005 in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It is a nonprofit cultural institution which produces performing arts programs, publications, films, and music events. It also organizes touring shows, discussions, forums, master-classes and workshops. Important components of its work include a creation of new work and a commitment to international cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastwest.ba/ Official East West Theatre Company Website &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission and leadership ==
Mission of the [http://www.eastwest.ba East West Theatre Company] Sarajevo is to raise awareness of the importance of multiculturalism in the [[Balkan]] region and around the world. It strives to serve as a platform for artists coming from different backgrounds as well as to produce the works of art of the highest standard. Their programmes and policies are based on equality and are oriented towards promoting diversity in terms of ethnicity, race, religion, gender and sexual orientation.

[[Haris Pašović]], Director of the East West Theatre Company is an internationally acclaimed multiple awarded theatre and film director who has been of a leading cultural and public figure in the Balkans for decades. His achievements include: co-founding of the Directing Department at the Performing Arts Academy in Sarajevo; managing the International Theatre and Film Festival MES during the siege of Sarajevo (during which he produced a production of [[Waiting for Godot]] directed by [[Susan Sontag]] ); founding of the Sarajevo Film Festival "Beyond the End of the World" during the siege of Sarajevo; founding of the East West Theatre Company in Sarajevo.

== History and repertoire ==
The East West Theatre Company has been performing extensively in the Balkan region and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labforculture.org/en/directory/contents/region-in-focus/adriatic-region-in-focus/regional-directory/bosnia-and-herzegovina/east-west-theatre-company/ LabforCulture Website: ''East West Theatre Company'' by Aida Kalender; Published: 03 nov 2008 &amp;#91;cited December 15, 2011&amp;#93; ]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the venues it performed at include the Edinburgh International Festival; Napoli Teatro Festival Italia, National Arts Festival of South Africa; Singapore Arts Festival; International Theatre Festival Poland as well as the festivals in St. Petersburg, Sibiu, Ljubljana, Belgrade, Zagreb, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastwest.ba/shows/ Official East West Theatre Company Website, List of Shows]&lt;/ref&gt;

The East West Theatre Company's repertoire consists of the following shows: W. Shakespeare's [[Hamlet (EWTC show)|''Hamlet'']]; [[Faust (EWTC show)|''Faust'']] based on Marlowe; N. Williams' ''[[Class Enemy (play)|Class Enemy]]'' (2007-), Michael Frayn's [[Copenhagen (EWTC show)|''Copenhagen'']]; [[Bolero (EWTC show)|''Bolero, Sarajevo'']] based on Maurice Ravel's work; Ibsen inspired [[Nora (EWTC show)|''Nora'']]; H.C.Andersen's [[Ugly Duckling (EWTC show)|''The Ugly Duckling'']]; H. Pašović's ''[[Football, Football]]''; a documentary film ''Dreamers'';[[Europe Today (show)|''Europe Today'']] based on [[Miroslav Krleža]]'s essay and ''[[Roses for Anne Teresa/Football Stories]]''.

William Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet (EWTC show)|Hamlet]]'' was performed in several countries and it was set in the context of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/sep/20/theatre ''The Guardian'' News Article]&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the Balkan's largest regional co-productions in the past twenty-five years and it involved artists from eight countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturelink.com.sg/artists/ Culture Link Website: ''East West Theatre Company( Bosnia Herzegovina)''; &amp;#91;cited December 15, 2011&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; British Reuters, [[CNN]] as well as many other media outlets reported about the production. Amar Selimović, as Hamlet, was awarded the Best Young Actor Award at the International Theatre Festival MES Sarajevo.

[[Faust (EWTC show)|''Faust'']] (produced in 2006) opened the MES Festival Sarajevo 2006 and in only two days attracted (for Bosnia and Herzegovina) record breaking 2,000 spectators. Based on [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s masterpiece, this production was set in the near future and it examined the impact of the rapid development of technology on contemporary life.

As the first Balkan company ever, the East West Theatre Company participated at the [[Edinburgh International Festival]] 2008 with Nigel Williams’ play ''[[Class Enemy (play)|Class Enemy]]'' (produced in 2007).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/25/theater/25frin.html?fta=y&amp;pagewanted=print/ New York Times: Antsy Adolescents Romp at Edinburgh Festivals by CHarles Isherwood &amp;#91;cited December 08, 2011&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a play about juvenile violence and disillusioned youth adapted to Bosnian circumstances. ''The Times'', ''[[Financial Times]]'', ''The Guardian'', ''The Herald'', ''The Independent'', ''The Scotsman'', ''Scotland on Sunday'', BBC, BBC World Service and many other British media reported extensively about the East West Theatre Company. ''[[Class Enemy (play)|Class Enemy]]'' has been pronounced as the Best Contemporary Show at the International Festival Kontakt, Toruń, Poland, and as The Best Play of the Year in Singapore's leading newspaper ''[[Strait Times]]'' and the leading theatre portal The Flying Inkpot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inkpotreviews.com/2008reviews/0618,clas,kk.xml/ The Flying Inkpot Website: ''Tonight Is What it Means to Be Young'' by Kenneth Kwok; Published: 18 Jun 2008 &amp;#91;cited December 15, 2011&amp;#93; ]&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Class enemy poster.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Poster for ''[[Class Enemy (play)|Class Enemy]]'' by East West Theatre Company]]

In 2008, East West Theatre Company toured with ''[[Class Enemy (play)|Class Enemy]]'' in Scotland in the small cities such as [[Cumbernauld]], [[Rutherglen]], and [[Stirling]]. With the same play, East West Theatre Company also toured to more than thirty Bosnia and Herzegovina towns. Most of the tour towns have not hosted a single theatre production for several decades prior to the arrival of the East West Theater Company's ''[[Class Enemy (play)|Class Enemy]]''.

In 2010, East West Theatre Company was invited to create an international theatre and dance production ''[[Football, Football]]''. The show was written and directed by [[Haris Pašović]], and produced in cooperation with Napoli Teatro Festival, [[Singapore Arts Festival]], Les Ballet C de la B, legendary contemporary dance company and Flota Institute from Slovenia. Since the May 2010 opening, the show has been performed fifteen times on three continents (Europe, Asia and Africa). The artists coming from four continents (Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia) and seven countries (Italy, Slovenia, Singapore, Burkina Faso, Bosnia and Herzegovina, China and Australia) gathered to work on the project.

[[Reuters]], British [[The Guardian|Guardian]], [[Channel News Asia]], CNN Mexico, [[China Daily]], [[India Times]], Daily News Pakistan, [[ABC News]] and media in Italy, Spain, Australia, Singapore and Indonesia wrote extensively about the show.

''[[Football, Football]]'' was a highlight of the National Arts Festival in South Africa that was taking place during the [[FIFA World Cup 2010]]. During the Napoli Teatro Festival Italia the East West Theatre Company organised a workshop presenting the story of football to 300 kids coming from deprived areas of the region of [[Campania]].

== Activities ==
In February 2009, the East West Theatre Company hosted one of the highest-profile theatre companies in Europe, Schaubühne Berlin, as a central part of the project East West Fest – Berlin in Sarajevo. This was one of the events in Europe that marked the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Schaubühne Theatre presented themselves to local audience with three of their productions:

Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' directed by [[Thomas Osteremeir]] played in the Olympic Hall Zetra before more than 2,500 spectators, Arthur Miller's ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' directed by Luk Perceval and F. Richter ''Under Ice'' in the National Theatre for more than 1,300 spectators.

In 2007 and 2008, East West organized events in the National Theatre Sarajevo celebrating April 6 – The Liberation Day of the City of Sarajevo.

In February 2011 East West Theatre Company co-produced a show called [[Europe Today (show)|''Europe Today'']]. Their co-producer was  the largest Slovenian theatre – [[Slovene National Theatre, Maribor]] and European Cultural Capital 2012 Maribor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sng-mb.si/za-medije/press-release-europe-today-the-biggest-theatre-co-production-in-south-east-europe/ Slovene National Theatre Announcement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323142505/http://www.sng-mb.si/za-medije/press-release-europe-today-the-biggest-theatre-co-production-in-south-east-europe/ |date=2011-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was written by [[Miroslav Krleža]] and directed by Haris Pašović with some of the finest artists in the region:  [[Miki Manojlović]], an actor; [[Edward Clug]], a contemporary dancer and choreographer and the industrial, neoclassical band [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]]. The dramaturge of the production was the [[Zagreb Youth Theatre]] director, Dubravka Vrgoč. [[Financial Times]] gave it excellent reviews rated it with four stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/15936ec0-3f75-11e0-a1ba-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1Eq631acg Financial Times Article]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past three years East West Theatre Company has organized master classes and workshops with some of the Europe's leading  directors, producers and choreographers such as Thomas Ostermeier (artistic director of Schaubuhne), Luk Perceval (artistic director of Thalía Theatre Hamburg), Tobias Veit (chief producer of Schaubuhne), [[James Morrison (producer)|James Morrison]] (producer of Guthrie Theatre Minneapolis), Mark Russel (director of [[Under the Radar Festival]] New York), Steve Kirkham and Madelaine Brennan (choreographer from Mathew Bourne's New Adventures), Larisa Lipovac and Tamara Curić (directors of Contemporary Dance Center TALA, Zagreb). Haris Pašović, artistic director held workshops for Scottish theatre and film directors in Edinburgh and master classes for professionals in Belfast, Singapore, Zagreb and Subotica.

In October 2011 East West Theatre Company, in co-production with Prime Cut Productions from Belfast, the [[Bosnian National Theatre Zenica]] and the Slovenian Youth Theatre of Ljubljana organized a five-day workshop in Zenica on the theme "Do the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Northern Ireland have the right to be happy? ". This workshop was greatly inspired by [[Bertrand Russell]]'s work The Conquest of Happiness, and materials generated there will serve as a basis for a future production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2008.eif.co.uk/event/east-west-theatre-company.html/ Edinburgh International Festival: East West Theatre Company &amp;#91;cited December 08, 2011&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;

East West Theatre Company and the City of Sarajevo are the main organizers of a large-scale event called [[Sarajevo Red Line]] which in April 2012 commemorated the [[Siege of Sarajevo]]'s 20th anniversary. This drama and music poem dedicated to citizens killed during the 1992-96 siege of their city consisted of 11,541 red chairs placed on the main Sarajevo street and it also included a street exhibition and a concert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/06/bosnia-marks-20th-anniversary_n_1407791.html/ Huffington Post: ''Sarajevo Marks The Conflict's 20th Anniversary '' &amp;#91;cited May 29, 2012&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Category:Exhibitions]]
'''Exhibit professional''' (sales) is someone who engages in the multimedia of all [[exhibitions]]. Such professional should exemplify knowledge of all types of exhibits (small and large) and locations of exhibitions as well. Some examples are: [[Tradeshow]] exhibitions, Museum exhibitions, international exhibitions. Exhibit professionals often use [[lead retrieval]] tools to capture and process [[Sales lead|sales leads]] from the exhibition. Lead retrieval tools connect to a database containing the contact details of event attendees, which the attendees provided when they registered for the event. Event attendees wear a badge during the event, which features a barcode, ID number or QR code. Exhibitors at the event use lead retrieval devices to scan the code or number, to digitally collect that person’s data from the registration database.

Exhibit Professional (builder) is someone who constructs the exhibit itself. Fabricating tradeshow exhibits, point of purchase displays and extremely knowledgeable in the use of [[Plexiglas]], plastic and above all signage. An exhibit builder must also have the ability to construct 1/4" to full-scale models.
[[Category:Exhibitions]]
Exhibit Professional (assembler) is responsible for reading [[blueprints]], shipping crates, crate packing, assembling exhibits, and extremely critical tradeshow shipping/receiving demands.

&lt;!-- The summary found in the opening paragraphs give the impression that the article is more concerned with language learning than extensive reading. --&gt;'''Extensive reading''', '''free reading''', '''book flood''', or '''reading for pleasure''' is a way of [[language learning]], including [[foreign language]] learning, through large amounts of reading. As well as facilitating acquisition of vocabulary, it is believed to increase motivation through positive affective benefits. It is believed that extensive reading is an important factor in education. Proponents such as Krashen (1989) claim that reading alone will increase encounters with unknown words, bringing learning opportunities by [[inferencing]]. The learner's encounters with unknown words in specific contexts will allow the learner to infer and thus learn those words' meanings. While the mechanism is commonly accepted as true, its importance in language learning is disputed. ({{harvnb|Cobb|2007|p= }})

[[File:Silent Reading time in a Lao school.jpg|thumb|About half of all children in rural Laos speak a minority ethnic language at home, and have difficulty in school, which is taught only in the Lao language. This primary school in Laos began a daily reading period in September 2013, in which children select a book to read simply for enjoyment. Big Brother Mouse, a literacy project that sponsored the program, began conducting a study in 2013 to measure reading and vocabulary improvements in schools that had this program.]]

In language learning, extensive reading is contrasted with ''intensive reading'', which is slow, careful reading of a small amount of difficult text – it is when one is "focused on the language rather than the text".&lt;ref name="waring"&gt;[http://www.robwaring.org/er/what_and_why/what_is_er.htmm Extensive Reading FAQ], Rob Waring&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive and intensive reading are two approaches to language learning and instruction, and may be used concurrently;&lt;ref name="waring" /&gt; intensive reading is, however, the more common approach, and often the only one used.&lt;ref name="waring" /&gt;

Extensive reading has been used and advocated in language learning since at least the 19th century (with [[Latin]]; [[#Translation of modern literature|see below]]). In the first language, many connections have been made between reading and vocabulary size, as well as other academic skills.

== Concepts ==
''Free voluntary reading'' refers to using extensive reading in language education. Students are free to choose a book that they like and are allowed to read it at their own pace. The aim of a free voluntary reading program is to help students to enjoy reading, so assessment is usually minimized or eliminated entirely.

The idea behind extensive reading is that a lot of reading of interesting material that is slightly below, at, or barely above the full comprehension level of the reader will foster improved language skills. [[Graded reader]]s are often used. For foreign-language learners, some researchers have found that the use of [[gloss (annotation)#In linguistics|gloss]]es for "difficult" words is advantageous to [[vocabulary]] acquisition ({{harvnb|Rott|Williams|Cameron|2002}}) but at least one study finds it has no effect ({{harvnb|Holley|King|2008}}). A number of studies report significant incidental vocabulary gain in extensive reading in a foreign language ({{harvnb|Huckin|Coady|1999}}). Advocates claim it can enhance skill in speaking as well as in reading.

{{harvnb|Day and Bamford (1988)|pp=7–8|Ref={{harvid|Day|Bamford|1988}}}} gave a number of traits common or basic to the extensive reading approach. Students read as much as possible. Reading materials are well within the reader's grammatical and vocabulary competence.  The material should be varied in subject matter and character.

Students choose their own reading material and are not compelled to finish uninteresting materials. Reading material is normally for pleasure, information or general understanding; reading is its own reward with few or no follow-up exercises after reading; reading is individual and silent.  Reading speed is usually faster when students read materials they can easily understand.

Nation(2005) suggests that learning from extensive reading should meet the following conditions: focusing on the meaning of the English text, understanding the type of learning that can occur through such reading, having interesting and engaging books, getting learners to do large quantities of reading at an appropriate level, and making sure that learning from reading is supported by other kinds of learning. In order to meet the conditions needed for learning from extensive reading at the students’ proficiency levels, it is essential to make use of simplified texts (Nation, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Nation, K. (2005). Children’s reading comprehension difficulties. In M. J. Snowling and C. Hulme (Eds.), The Science of Reading: A Handbook (pp 248–265).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://eteachershub.com/2015/05/07/developing-china-students-english-reading-ability-through-extensive-reading/&lt;/ref&gt;

The teacher is a role model who also orients the students to the goals of the program, explains the idea and methodology, keeps records of what has been read, and guides students in material selection and maximizing the effect of the program.

Some recent practitioners have not followed all of these traits, or have added to them, for example,  requiring regular follow-up exercises such as story summaries or discussions and the use of audio materials in tandem with the readings ({{harvnb|Bell|1998}}).

== Graded reader series ==
A [[graded reader]] series of books that increase in difficulty from shorter texts using more common words in the first volumes, to longer texts with less common vocabulary in later volumes. {{harvnb|Cobb (2008)|p=|Ref={{harvid|Cobb|2008}}}} cites Oxford's ''Bookworm series'', which includes the 2,500 most frequent words, The ''Longman Bridge Series'' (1945), with a systematic grading up to 8,000 words, now out of print, and the ''Penguin/Longman Active Reading'' series with its 3,000 word-family target.

Many series of graded readers exist in English, and series exist also in French, German, Italian, and Spanish.&lt;ref name="Hill2008"&gt;{{Harv|Hill|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2008}}, readers are notably absent or scarce in Russian, Arabic, Japanese, and Mandarin Chinese,&lt;ref name="Hill2008" /&gt; though since 2006, an extensive reader series is available in Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nihongo-yomu.jp/tadoku-english.html What is Extensive Reading?] {{en icon}} [http://www.nihongo-yomu.jp/ 日本語多読研究会] (Japanese Extensive Reading Research Society) [http://www.nihongo-yomu.jp/info.html 活動報告] (Report on Activities) [http://www.nihongo-yomu.jp/info.html#2006 2006] {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; English readers have primarily been produced by British publishers, rather than American or other Anglophone nations. {{As of|1997}}, only one small series (15 volumes) was published in the United States, and a few in Europe outside the UK, with the majority in the UK.&lt;ref name="Hill1997"&gt;{{Harv|Hill|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Translation of modern literature ==
For advocates of extensive reading, lack of reading selection is an acute issue in [[classical language]]s such as [[Latin]] – the main readings available being quite difficult and are perceived as dry. To increase the available literature and make more light selection available, modern literature (particularly children's literature, comics, and genre fiction) may be translated into classical languages – see [[list of Latin translations of modern literature]] for examples in Latin. As [[Francis William Newman|F. W. Newman]] writes in his introduction to a Latin translation of ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'':
:"[N]o accuracy of reading small portions of Latin will ever be so effective as extensive reading; and to make extensive reading possible to the many, the style ought to be very easy and the matter attractive."&lt;ref&gt;Francis William Newman, ''Rebilius Cruso: Robinson Crusoe, in Latin; A Book to Lighten Tedium to a Learner'', London, Trübner &amp; Co., 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Threshold ==
Laufer suggests that 3,000 [[word family|word families]] or 5,000 lexical items are the threshold ({{harvnb|Laufer|1997|p= }}). Coady &amp; Nation (1998) suggest 98% of lexical coverage and 5,000 word families or 8,000 items for a pleasurable reading ({{harvnb|Coady &amp; Huckin|1997|p=233}}). After this threshold, the learner leaves the beginner paradox, and enters a [[virtuous circle]] ({{harvnb|Coady &amp; Huckin|1997|p=233}}). Then, extensive reading becomes more efficient.

== Limits ==
{{harvnb|Cobb (2007)|p=|Ref={{harvid|Cobb|2008|p= }}}}, {{harvnb|McQuillan &amp; Krashen (2008)|p=|Ref={{harvid|McQuillan|Krashen|2008|p= }}}}, and {{harvnb|Cobb (2008)|p=|Ref={{harvid|Cobb|2008|p= }}}} offer contrasting perspectives. All agree on the need of lexical input, but Cobb (2007; 2008) supported by {{harvnb|Parry (1997)|p=|Ref={{harvid|Parry|1997|p= }}}} denounces the sufficiency of extensive reading, the current lexical expansion pedagogy, especially for confirmed learners. According to Cobb (2007), {{harvnb|Krashen (1989)|p=|Ref={{harvid|Krashen|1989|p= }}}}'s Input Hypothesis states that extensive reading generates a continuous hidden learning (lexical input), eventually "doing the entire job" of vocabulary acquisition. This hypothesis is without empirical evidence, neither on the extent (% of global [[vocabulary acquisition]]), nor on the sufficiency of extensive reading for [[lexicon]] learning (Cobb 2007).

Cobb (2007) thus proposed a computer-based study to quantitatively assess the efficiency of extensive reading. Cobb estimated the reading quantity of common learners within the L2 language (~175,000 words over two years), then randomly took 10 words in each of the first thousand most frequent words, the second thousand, and the third thousand, to see how many times those words would appear. Those results should be higher than 6 to 10 encounters, the number needed for stable initial word learning to occur. Cobb (2007) summarizes as following: "[the quantitative study] shows the extreme unlikelihood of developing an adequate L2 reading lexicon [above 2,000 words families] through reading alone, even in highly favorable circumstances" since "for the vast majority of L2 learners, free or wide reading alone is not a sufficient source of vocabulary knowledge for reading". Thereafter, Cobb restated the need of lexical input, and stated the possibility to increase it using computing capabilities.

McQuillan &amp; Krashen (2008) answer that learners may read far more than 175,000 words but rather +1,000,000 words in 2 years, but {{harvnb|Cobb (2008)|p=|Ref={{harvid|Cobb|2008|p= }}}} counters that view as being based on excessively successful cases of reading oversimplified texts. Experiments cited by McQuillan &amp; Krashen use easy and fast to read texts, but not material suitable for discovering new vocabulary; unsimplified texts are far harder and slower to read.

== Advocacy and support organizations ==
The Extensive Reading Foundation is a not-for-profit, charitable organization whose purpose is to support and promote extensive reading. One of its initiatives is the annual Language Learner Literature Award for the best new works in English. Another is maintaining a bibliography of research on extensive reading. The Foundation is also interested in helping educational institutions set up extensive reading programs through grants that fund the purchase of books and other reading material.&lt;ref&gt;http://erfoundation.org/wordpress/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Extensive Reading Special Interest Group (ER SIG) of the Japan Association for Language Teaching &lt;ref&gt;[http://jalt.org/ Japan Association for Language Teaching (JALT)]&lt;/ref&gt; is a not-for-profit organization which exists to help promote Extensive Reading in Japan.  Via a website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ersig.org/drupal-ersig/ xtensive Reading Special Interest Group (ER SIG)]&lt;/ref&gt; the publications ''Extensive Reading in Japan'' and ''Journal of Extensive Reading'', presentations throughout Japan, and other activities, the ER SIG aims to help teachers set up and make the most of their ER programs and ER research projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ersig.org/drupal-ersig/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extensive listening ==
Similar to extensive reading is ''extensive listening'', which is the analogous approach to listening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robwaring.org/el/starting_extensive_listening.htm Starting Extensive Listening], Rob Waring&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eltj.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/06/24/elt.ccq042.full The primacy of extensive listening], Meredith Stephens, {{doi|10.1093/elt/ccq042}}&lt;/ref&gt; One issue is that listening speed is generally slower than reading speed, so simpler texts are recommended – one may be able to read a text extensively, but not be able to listen to it extensively.

The '''Film Music Guild''' (FMG) is a student organization at [[Biola University]] in [[La Mirada, CA]]. The Film Music Guild was formed to teach film students about music and music students about film.

==History==
The Film Music Guild was formed in 2006 by composition student [[Dave Martina]] to fill the gap between [[Biola University|Biola]]'s music and film departments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biola.edu/100percent/instrumental/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The FMG Conference==
On October 3, 2009, the Film Music Guild hosted the first annual Film Music Guild Conference (called the FMG Conference 2009).

The '''film industry''' or '''motion picture industry''', comprises the technological and commercial institutions of [[filmmaking]], i.e., film [[production company|production companies]], [[film studio]]s, [[cinematography]], [[animation]], [[film production]], [[screenwriting]], [[pre-production]], [[post production]], [[film festival]]s, [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] and [[actor]]s, [[film director]]s and other [[film crew]] personnel.

Though the expense involved in making [[film]]s almost immediately led film production to concentrate under the auspices of standing production companies, advances in affordable film making equipment, and expansion of opportunities to acquire investment capital from outside the film industry itself, have allowed [[independent film]] production to evolve. [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] is the oldest film industry of the world, and the largest in terms of box office gross revenue. [[Indian cinema]] (including [[Bollywood]]) is the largest film industry in terms of the number of films produced and the number of tickets sold, with 3.5 billion tickets sold worldwide annually (compared to Hollywood's 2.6 billion tickets sold annually)&lt;ref&gt;Matusitz, J., &amp; Payano, P. (2011). The Bollywood in Indian and American Perceptions: A Comparative Analysis. ''India Quarterly: A Journal of International Affairs'', ''67''(1), 65–77. {{doi|10.1177/097492841006700105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,986 feature films produced annually.&lt;ref name="filmfed"&gt;{{cite web|title=INDIAN FEATURE FILMS CERTIFIED DURING THE YEAR 2017|url=http://www.filmfed.org/IFF2017.html|website=[[Film Federation of India]]|date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern film industry ==
{{World Cinema}}
The worldwide theatrical market had a box office of {{USD|38.6 billion}} in 2016. The top three continents/regions by box office gross were: Asia-Pacific with {{USD|14.9 billion}}, the U.S. and Canada with {{USD|11.4 billion}}, and Europe, the Middle East and North Africa with {{USD|9.5 billion}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lang |first=Brent |date=22 March 2017 |title=Global Box Office Hits Record $38.6 Billion in 2016 Even as China Slows Down |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/box-office-record-china-1202013961/ |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2016-Theatrical-Market-Statistics-Report-2.pdf |title=Theatrical Market Statistics 2016 |website=MPAA |access-date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2016}}, the largest markets by box office were, in decreasing order, the United States, China, Japan, India, and the United Kingdom. {{as of|2011}}, the countries with the largest number of film productions were India, Nigeria, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Robinson |first1=Daniel B. |title=The trend shift of the modern film industry |url=https://www.bollywikia.com/ |accessdate=2 April 2018 |agency=Lindale Avenue |issue=April '18 |publisher=San Fran &amp; co |date=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, significant centers of movie production are France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="EUROAVCOUNCIL-20090511"&gt;{{cite press release

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinct from the centers are the locations where movies are filmed. Because of labor and infrastructure costs, many films are produced in countries other than the one in which the company which pays for the film is located. For example, many U.S. movies are filmed in Canada, many Nigerian movies are filmed in [[Ghana]], while many Indian movies are filmed in the Americas, Europe, [[Singapore]] etc.

[[File:Hollywood Sign (Zuschnitt).jpg|thumb|The [[Hollywood Sign]]|226x226px]]
The [[cinema of the United States]], often generally referred to as '''Hollywood''', has had a profound effect on cinema across the world since the early 20th century. The United States cinema (Hollywood) is the oldest film industry in the world which originated more than 121 years ago and also the largest film industry in terms of revenue. [[Hollywood]] is the primary nexus of the U.S. film industry with established film study facilities such as the [[American Film Institute]], [[LA Film School]] and NYFA being established in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nyfa.edu/los-angeles/ Los Angeles Film Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; However, four of the [[Major film studio#Today's Big Six|six major film studios]] are owned by [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] companies. The [[major film studios]] of Hollywood including [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Lightstorm Entertainment]] are the primary source of the [[List of highest-grossing films|most commercially successful movies in the world]], such as  ''[[Star Wars]]'' (1977), and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997).

American film studios today collectively generate several hundred movies every year, making the United States one of the most prolific producers of films in the world. Only [[The Walt Disney Company]] — which owns [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|the Walt Disney Studios]] — is fully based in [[Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Donckels|first=William|title=Disney Raises SoCal Annual Pass Prices 30% - to Keep Locals "Out"|url=http://technorati.com/business/article/disney-raises-socal-annual-pass-prices/|publisher=Technorati.com|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; And while [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] is headquartered in Culver City, California, its parent company, the [[Sony Corporation]], is headquartered in [[Tokyo]], Japan. Most shooting now takes place in [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Louisiana]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[North Carolina]]. Hollywood is the most popular film industry with the highest number of screens, and is the highest-grossing film industry in the world. Between 2009-2015, Hollywood consistently grossed $10 billion (or more) annually.&lt;ref&gt;Number of total movies in 2014 are taken from http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2014&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood's award ceremony, the [[Academy Awards]], officially known as The Oscars, is held by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS) every year and a total of 2,947 Oscars have been awarded since the inception of the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oscar Statuette|url = http://www.oscars.org/oscars/statuette|website = Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest documented account of an exhibition of projected motion pictures in the United States was in June 1894 in [[Richmond, Indiana]] by [[Charles Francis Jenkins]] which makes [[Cinema of the United States|United States cinema]] the earliest cinema in the whole world. Jenkins used his Phantoscope to project his film before an audience of family, friends and reporters. The film featured a vaudeville dancer performing a Butterfly Dance. Jenkins and his new partner [[Thomas Armat]] modified the Phantoscope for exhibitions in temporary theaters at the Cotton States Exposition in the fall of 1895. The Phantoscope was later sold to [[Thomas Edison]], who changed the name of the projector to Edison's Vitascope.
[[File:Nestor studio 1911.jpg|thumb|223x223px|Nestor studio, 1911]]
[[Nestor Studios]] was Hollywood's first movie studio, founded on 27 October 1911. It was built by [[David Horsley]] for Nestor Motion Picture Company. It was then owned and operated by [[David Horsley]] and his brother, William Horsley. The first [[Sound stage|motion picture stage]] in Hollywood was built behind the tavern. Other [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] studios had moved production to Los Angeles, prior to Nestor's move
west. The California weather allowed for year-round filming and the ambitious studio operated three principal divisions under its Canadian-born general manager, [[Al Christie]]. Other [[Filmmaking|filmmakers]] began opening studios in the [[Hollywood]] area. The Horsleys operated the [[Nestor Studios]] at the Sunset and Gower location until 20 May 1912, when the [[Universal Studios]] was formed, headed by [[Carl Laemmle]]. Nestor, along with several other motion picture companies, including Laemmle's [[Independent Moving Pictures]] (IMP), was merged with Universal.

[[File:Qufu Cinema - P1060026.JPG|thumb|Old Chinese Cinema in [[Qufu]], [[Shandong]], China]]
The '''Cinema of China''' is one of three distinct historical threads of [[Chinese language|Chinese-language]] [[film|cinema]] together with the [[cinema of Hong Kong]] and the [[cinema of Taiwan]]. Cinema was introduced in China in 1896 and the first Chinese film, ''[[The Battle of Dingjunshan (film)|The Battle of Dingjunshan]]'', was made in 1905, with the film industry being centered on [[Shanghai]] in the first decades. China is the home of the largest film studio in the world, the [[Hengdian World Studios]], and in 2010 it had the third largest film industry by number of feature films produced annually. For the next decade the production companies were mainly foreign-owned, and the domestic film industry was centered on Shanghai, a thriving [[Entrepôt|entrepot]] and the largest city in the [[Far East]]. In 1913, the first independent Chinese [[screenplay]], ''[[The Difficult Couple]]'', was filmed in [[Shanghai]] by [[Zheng Zhengqiu]] and [[Zhang Shichuan]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = East Asian Cinema|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Nydlzbe2LhEC|publisher = Oldcastle Books, Limited|date = 4 November 2010|isbn = 9781842433805|first = David|last = Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Still Life'' was a surprise addition and [[Golden Lion]] winner of the 2006 Venice International Film Festival. ''Still Life'', which concerns provincial workers around the [[Three Gorges]] region, sharply contrasts with the works of Fifth [[Generation]] Chinese directors like [[Zhang Yimou]] and [[Chen Kaige]] who were at the time producing ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' (2004) and ''The Promise'' (2005). It featured no star of international renown and was acted mostly by non-professionals. In 2012 the country became the second-largest market in the world by box office receipts.

The 1940s, 1950s and the 1960s are generally considered the [[golden age]] of Egyptian cinema. As in the West, films responded to the popular imagination, with most falling into predictable [[Film genre|genres]] (happy endings being the norm), and many actors making careers out of playing strongly typed parts. In the words of one critic, "If an Egyptian film intended for popular audiences lacked any of these prerequisites, it constituted a betrayal of the unwritten contract with the spectator, the results of which would manifest themselves in the box office."&lt;ref name="retrospection"&gt;Farid, Samir, [http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/462/cinema.htm "Lights, camera...retrospection"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511112523/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/462/cinema.htm |date=11 May 2013 }}, ''[[Al-Ahram]] Weekly'', 30 December 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, Egypt's cinema has gone in separate directions. Smaller [[art film]]s attract some international attention but sparse attendance at home. Popular films, often broad comedies such as ''[[What A Lie!

North Korean films tend to portray their communist or revolutionary themes.

[[Hong Kong]] is a filmmaking hub for the Chinese-speaking world (including the worldwide [[diaspora]]) and East Asia in general.  For decades it was the third largest motion picture industry in the world (after Bollywood and Hollywood) and the second largest exporter of films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gorman|first=Patrick J.|title=Hong Kong to Hollywood:  A "ridiculous amount of interest" in Hong Kong cinema is redefining Tinseltown|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/hong_kong_to_hollywood_3279/|publisher=Moviemaker.com|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an industry crisis starting in the mid-1990s and Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty in July 1997 Hong Kong film has retained much of its distinctive identity and continues to play a prominent part on the world cinema stage.
Unlike many film industries, Hong Kong has enjoyed little to no direct government support, through either subsidies or import quotas.  It has always been a thoroughly commercial cinema, concentrating on crowd-pleasing [[film genre|genres]], like comedy and action, and heavily reliant on formulas, sequels and remakes.  Typically of commercial cinemas, its heart is a highly developed [[star system (film)|star system]], which in this case also features substantial overlap with the [[Cantopop|pop music industry]].

=== Pakistan ===
{{see also|Cinema of Pakistan|Lollywood}}
The '''cinema of Pakistan''', or simply, '''Pakistani cinema''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|پاکستانی سنیما}}}}) refers to [[Pakistan]]'s film industry. Most of the feature films shot in Pakistan are in [[Urdu]], the national language, but may also include films in English, the official language, and regional languages such as [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Balochi language|Balochi]], and [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]]. [[Lahore]] has been described as the epicentre of Pakistani cinema, giving rise to the term "[[Lollywood]]."

Before the separation of Bangladesh, Pakistan had three main film production centres: [[Lahore]], [[Karachi]] and [[Dhaka]]. The regime of [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], [[Video cassette recorder|VCR]]s, [[film piracy]], the introduction of entertainment taxes, strict laws based upon ultra-conservative jurisprudence, was an obstacle to the industry's growth.&lt;ref name="dawn.com"&gt;http://www.dawn.com/news/1045365&lt;/ref&gt; Once thriving, the cinema in Pakistan had a sudden collapse in the 1980s and by the 2000s "an industry that once produced an average of 80 films annually was now struggling to even churn out more than two films a year.".&lt;ref&gt;an industry that once produced an average of 80 films annually was now struggling to even churn out more than two films a year.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bollywhat.com/beyond/pakistani.html The Beginner's Guide to Pakistani Cinema]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the industry has recently made a dramatic and remarkable comeback, evident from the fact that 18 of the 21 highest grossing Pakistani movies were released from 2013 through to the present, with Pakistani films frequently outcompeting Bollywood movies for the Pakistani audience, the industry is supported by Pakistani channels such as ARY and Geo whose entertainment divisions have invested significantly in Pakistani cinema when expanding from providing news and entertainment on TV channels, the lifting of strict regulations on production of films and reduction of taxes on cinemas helped to fuel an expansion across the industry from which the film industry has seen a revival.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Bangladesh ===
{{see also|Cinema of Bangladesh|Dhallywood}}
The '''cinema of Bangladesh''' is the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] language film industry based in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]]. The industry often has been a significant film industry since the early 1970s. The word "Dhallywood" is a portmanteau of the words Dhaka and [[Hollywood]]. The dominant style of Bangladeshi cinema is [[Melodrama|Melodramatic cinema]], which developed from 1947 to 1990 and characterizes most films to this day. Cinema was introduced in Bangladesh in 1898 by Bradford Bioscope Company, credited to have arranged the first film release in Bangladesh. Between 1913 and 1914, the first production company named Picture House was opened. A short silent film titled ''Sukumari'' (''The Good Girl'') was the first produced film in the region during 1928. The first full-length film ''The Last Kiss'', was released in 1931. From the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan, Dhaka is the center of Bangladeshi film industry, and generated the majority share of revenue, production and audiences. The 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and the first half of the 1990s were the golden years for Bangladeshi films as the industry produced many successful films. ''[[Mukh O Mukhosh|The Face and the Mask]]'', the first Bengali language Bangladeshi full-length feature film was produced in 1956.&lt;ref name=cholochitro&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Bangladeshi Film|url=http://www.cholochitro.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=49|website=cholochitro.com|publisher=Cholochitro|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mukh O Mukhosh"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mukh O Mukhosh |url=http://www.bfa.gov.bd/movie/details.html?id=100 |publisher=bfa.gov.bd |accessdate=14 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129021323/http://www.bfa.gov.bd/movie/details.html?id=100 |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign films include major box offices from the west, and other major film producers of the world. This has caused a massive ripple effect on the country's economy. It is assumed that this increases the purchase of unlicensed DVDs. However, even copyright violating DVDs took longer to obtain. The minimum cost to view a foreign film not screened locally, was 1 million Rupiah.

The [[Trinidad and Tobago Film Company]] is the national agency that was established in 2006 to further development of the film industry. Trinidad and Tobago puts on a number of film festivals which are organized by different committees and organizations. These include the Secondary Schools Short Film Festival and Smartphone Film Festival organized by Trinidad and Tobago Film Company. There is also an annual [[Trinidad and Tobago Film Festival]] which runs for two weeks in the latter half of September.

=== Nepal ===
{{main|Kallywood}}
Nepali film does not have a very long movie history, but the industry has its own place in the cultural heritage of the country. It is often referred to as 'Nepali Chalchitra' (which translates to "Nepali movies" in English). The terms Kollywood and Kallywood are also used, as a portmanteau of "Kathmandu" and "Hollywood"; "Kollywood" however is more frequently used to refer to Tamil cinema.[1] [[Chhakka Panja]] has been considered the highest-grossing movie of all time in Nepali Movie Industry and Kohinoor the second highest. Nepali movies has recently begun receiving international acclaim with films such as [[The Black Hen]] (2015), [[Kagbeni (film)|Kagbeni]] (2006) and others. Nepali feature film [[White Sun]] (Seto Surya) has bagged the Best Film award at [http://sgiff.com/ the 27th Singapore International Film Festival] (SGIFF)(2016).

The Film Development Board (FDB) was established by the Government of Nepal for the development and promotion of the Nepali film industry. The Board is a liaison to facilitate the conceptualization, making, distribution and exhibition of Nepali films nationally. The Board attempts to bridge the gap between film entrepreneurship and government bureaucracy. The Board is a balance between the people at large, the government, and the process of film making. It is intended to act as the safeguard of the interests of the people, the watchdog of the government, and the advocate of filmmakers.

The first [[feature film]] to be made was the 1906 Australian silent ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'', an account of the notorious gang led by [[Ned Kelly]] that was directed and produced by the [[Melbourne|Melburnians]] Dan Barry and [[Charles Tait (film director)|Charles Tait]]. It ran, continuously, for eighty minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Story of the Kelly Gang |url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/story-kelly-gang/notes/ |publisher=Australian Screen, National Film and Sound Archive |accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1910s, the film industry had fully emerged with D.W. Griffith's ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''. Also in the early 1900s motion picture production companies from New York and New Jersey started moving to California because of the good weather and longer days. Although electric lights existed at that time, none were powerful enough to adequately expose film; the best source of illumination for movie production was natural sunlight. Besides the moderate, dry climate, they were also drawn to the state because of its open spaces and wide variety of natural scenery.

=== Hollywood ===
The earliest documented account of an exhibition of projected motion pictures in the United States was in June 1894 in [[Richmond, Indiana]] by [[Charles Francis Jenkins]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} The first [[movie studio]] in the Hollywood area, [[Nestor Studios]], was founded in 1911 by [[Al Christie]] for [[David Horsley]] in an old building on the northwest corner of [[Sunset Boulevard]] and Gower Street.  In the same year, another fifteen Independents settled in Hollywood.  Hollywood came to be so strongly associated with the film industry that the word "Hollywood" came to be used colloquially to refer to the entire industry.

In 1913 [[Cecil B. DeMille]], in association with [[Jesse Lasky]], leased a barn with studio facilities on the southeast corner of Selma and Vine Streets from the Burns and Revier Studio and Laboratory, which had been established there.  DeMille then began production of ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'' (1914). It became known as the [[Lasky-DeMille Barn]] and is currently the location of the [[Hollywood Heritage Museum]].

The [[Charlie Chaplin]] Studios, on the northeast corner of La Brea and De Longpre Avenues just south of Sunset Boulevard, was built in 1917.  It has had many owners after 1953, including Kling Studios, which housed production for the [[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|''Superman'' TV series]] with [[George Reeves]]; [[Red Skelton]], who used the [[sound stage]]s for his [[CBS]] TV [[variety show]]; and CBS, who filmed the TV series ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' with [[Raymond Burr]] there.  It has also been owned by [[Herb Alpert]]'s [[A&amp;M Records]] and Tijuana Brass Enterprises.  It is currently The [[Jim Henson]] Company, home of the [[Muppets]]. In 1969 The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Board named the studio a historical cultural monument.

The famous [[Hollywood Sign]] originally read "Hollywoodland." It was erected in 1923 to advertise a new housing development in the hills above Hollywood. For several years the sign was left to deteriorate. In 1949 the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce stepped in and offered to remove the last four letters and repair the rest.

The sign, located at the top of Mount Lee, is now a registered trademark and cannot be used without the permission of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which also manages the venerable [[Hollywood Walk of Fame|Walk of Fame]].

The first [[Academy Awards]] presentation ceremony took place on 16 May 1929, during a banquet held in the Blossom Room of the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard. Tickets were [[United States dollar|USD]] $10.00 {{citation needed|date=March 2016}} and there were 250 people in attendance.

From about 1930 five major Hollywood movie studios from all over the Los Angeles area, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[RKO]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Warner Bros.]], owned large, grand [[Movie theater|theaters]] throughout the country for the exhibition of their movies.  The period between the years 1927 (the effective end of the silent era) to 1948 is considered the age of the "Hollywood studio system", or, in a more common term, the ''[[History of cinema#The Golden Age of Hollywood|Golden Age of Hollywood]]''.  In a [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|landmark 1948 court decision]], the Supreme Court ruled that movie studios could not own theaters and play only the movies of their studio and [[movie star]]s, thus an era of Hollywood history had unofficially ended.  By the mid-1950s, when television proved a profitable enterprise that was here to stay, movie studios started also being used for the production of programming in that medium, which is still the norm today.

''The Wrestlers'' (1899) and ''The Man and His Monkeys'' (1899), directed and produced by Harischandra Sakharam Bhatawdekar ([[H. S. Bhatavdekar]]), were the first two films made by Indian filmmakers, which were both short films. He was also the first Indian filmmaker to direct and produce the first documentary and news related film, titled ''The Landing of Sir M.M. Bhownuggree''.

''Pundalik'' (''[[Shree Pundalik]]'') (1912), by [[Dadasaheb Torne]] alias Rama Chandra Gopal, and ''[[Raja Harishchandra]]'' (1913), by [[Dadasaheb Phalke]], were the first and second silent feature films respectively made in India.&lt;ref name="Guinness Books"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robertson|first1=Patrick|title=The Guinness Book of Movie Facts &amp; Feats|date=1988|publisher=Guinness Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-85112-899-8|page=8|edition=1988}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dainik Asam Assamese daily"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Deka|first1=Arnab Jan|title=Fathers of Indian Cinema Bhatawdekar and Torney|publisher=Dainik Asam (Assamese daily)|date=27 October 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Narwekar|first1=Sanjit|title=Marathi Cinema : In Retrospect|date=January 1995|publisher=Maharashtra Film, Stage &amp; Cultural Development Corporation Ltd|location=Bombay, India|pages=9–12|edition=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Firoze Rangoonwalla"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rangoonwalla|first1=Firoze|title=A Pictorial History of Indian Cinema|date=1979|publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=London, New York, Sydney, Toronto|isbn=0-600-34909-8|page=12|edition=1979}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s the industry was producing more than 200 films per annum.&lt;ref name="britannica2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gulzar |author2=Nihalani, Govind |author3=Chatterji, Saibal |title=Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema|year=2003|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica (India) Pvt Ltd.|isbn=81-7991-066-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8y8vN9A14nkC|pages=136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Indian sound film, [[Ardeshir Irani]]'s ''[[Alam Ara]]'' (1931), was a major commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060326/spectrum/main1.htm Talking Images, 75 Years of Cinema]&lt;/ref&gt; There was clearly a huge market for talkies and musicals; Bollywood and all the regional film industries quickly switched to sound filming. ''[[Joymoti (1935 film)]]'' by [[Jyoti Prasad Agarwalla]] was the first Indian dubbed film, released in Calcutta on 10 March 1935. Till then, all dialogues of all talkies were had to be recorded at locations during the shooting of the film. Through ''[[Joymoti (1935 film)]]'', dubbing technology was successfully introduced to Indian cinema by Assamese filmmaker [[Jyoti Prasad Agarwalla]].&lt;ref name="Dainik Asam Assamese daily"/&gt;

The 1930s and 1940s were tumultuous times: India was buffeted by the [[Great Depression]], World War II, the [[Indian independence movement]], and the violence of the [[Partition of India|Partition]]. Most Bollywood films were unabashedly [[escapism|escapist]], but there were also a number of filmmakers who tackled tough social issues, or used the struggle for Indian independence as a backdrop for their plots.&lt;ref name="britannica2"/&gt;

In 1937 [[Ardeshir Irani]], of ''[[Alam Ara]]'' fame, made the first colour film in Hindi, ''[[Kisan Kanya (1937 film)|Kisan Kanya]]''. The next year, he made another colour film, a version of ''Mother India''. However, colour did not become a popular feature until the late 1950s. At this time, lavish romantic musicals and melodramas were the staple fare at the cinema.

Following [[Indian independence movement|India's independence]], the period from the late 1940s to the early 1960s is regarded by film historians as the "Golden Age" of Hindi cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Popular Cinema: A Narrative of Cultural Change|last=K.

== Economics ==
{{main|Economics of the arts and literature}}

Profitability of a [[film studio]] is crucially dependent on picking the right film projects and involving the right management and creative teams (cast, direction, visual design, score, photography, costume, set design, editing, and many additional specialties), but it also depends heavily on choosing the right scale and approach to [[film promotion]], control over receipts through technologies such as [[digital rights management]] (DRM), [[Hollywood accounting|sophisticated accounting practices]], and management of [[tie-in|ancillary revenue streams]]; in the extreme, for a major [[media franchise]] centered on film, the film might itself be only one large component of many large contributions to total franchise revenue.

Substantial revenues might also derive from [[license|licensing]] efforts and other activities centered around the management of [[intellectual property]]; for this reason, various national film industries are [[lobbying|heavily invested]] in the politics and legal specifics of multilateral [[trade agreement]]s. Hollywood is a large enough industry to impact America's net [[balance of trade]], offsetting some of the decline of employment in the manufacturing sector of the American economy since the early 1980s; typical of recent economic trends in [[first world]] economies, a large number of manufacturing jobs paying moderate wages are offset by a smaller number of creating jobs paying high wages. As an intellectual property industry, the film industry (along with the [[software industry]]) are central to modern [[globalization]].

The film industry differs from software, however, in functioning primarily as a cultural export. English-language culture is the most globalized of all cultures, despite China and India having internal populations to rival the global English footprint. For this reason, Hollywood is the dominant film industry in globalism and trade. India has both a large film industry and a large, internal English-language culture, though Bollywood has not yet become a center for English-language film exports on a major scale. Films designed for global export tend to be films centered on action rather than dialogue, especially nuanced dialogue which is not fully available to people speaking [[English as a second language]] (ESL). Unusually, Japanese [[Anime]] has a global audience, though these are sometimes dubbed into English by star-power Hollywood voice actors.&lt;!-- several recent Ghibli productions --&gt;

On the creative side, picking the right projects has traditionally been regarded as high risk. Increasingly the risk is being mitigated with approaches drawn from advanced [[data analytics]], such as using models derived from [[machine learning]] (sometimes glorified as [[artificial intelligence|AI]]) to estimate the future revenue of a proposed project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-box-office-predictions/|title=Could Artificial Intelligence Predict the Next Avengers: Infinity War?|last1=Bay |first1=Scott |date=30 April 2018 |website=wired.com |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Linguistics}}
Many languages have '''distinct sets of enunciation and/or of writing''', dependent on whether the speaker or writer be a man or a woman, and/or on whether the party or parties addressed be men or women.

==Australia==
Some tribes found in western [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] prohibit a man and woman from marrying if they speak the same language. During initial visits in this arrangement, neither people are allowed the speak the [[dialect]] of the tribe that he or she is visiting.&lt;ref&gt;Mason 1899, p. 199 -- quoted from :- J. G. Frazer, ''Totemism'', Edinburgh, 1887. p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2015}}

==Africa==
The women in the Kaffir of [[South Africa]] have their own vocabulary system that is not understood by men. It is called the "ukulela kwabazi", or "women's language".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2aHQVyZ8b4cC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=  Crawley 1927, p. 56]&lt;/ref&gt;

"the [[Swahili people|Suaheli]] have for every object which they do not care to mention by its real name a symbolic word understood by everybody concerned. In especial such symbols are used by women in their mysteries to denote obscene things. The words chosen are either ordinary names for innocent things or else taken from the old language or other [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] languages, mostly [[Zigula language|Kiziguha]], for among the [[Wazigua|Waziguha]] secret rites play an enormous role."&lt;ref&gt;Jespersen 1922, chapter XIII, section 2 "Tabu", p. 241 -- citing :- H. Ploss and M. Bartels, ''Das Weib in der Natur und Volkerkunde'' (9th ed., Leipzig, 1908)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
"There are families in which the wife talks [[Basque language|Basque]], while the husband does not even understand Basque and does not allow his children to learn it".&lt;ref&gt;Jespersen 1922, chapter XIII, section 3, "Competing languages", p. 241 -- citing :- Bornecque et Miihlen, ''Les Provinces françaises'', 53.&lt;/ref&gt; 
"The old [[Livonian language]], which is now nearly extinct, is kept up with the greatest fidelity by the women, while the men are abandoning it for [[Lettish]]."&lt;ref&gt;Jespersen 1922, chapter XIII, section 3, "Competing languages", p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;
"In [[France]], about 1700, women were inclined to pronounce '''e''' instead of '''o''' ... . ... in the sixteenth century in France there was a tendency to leave off the trilling and even to go further than to the present English untrilled point '''r''' by pronouncing ['''z'''] instead, but some of the old grammarians mention this pronunciation as characteristic of women".&lt;ref&gt;Jespersen 1922, chapter XIII, section 6 "Phonetics and grammar", p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==
In the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] group of dialects, "In addition to Main Dialect, there is also a sociolect called eme-sal. The meaning of the second element of the name is uncertain; it may mean "fine, thin". The "status" of this [[sociolect]] has been much discussed. It has traditionally been called a "women's language", because it appears in literary texts of the [[Old Babylonian period]], used by goddesses when speaking to other goddesses. ... Emesal differs from Main Dialect in [[phonology]] and in [[lexicon]], but not apparently in morphology. ... For example, words with /d/ in Main Dialect usually have /z/ in Emesal".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sci.tech-archive.net/Archive/sci.lang/2009-05/msg00122.html Hayes, John L. : ''A Manual of Sumerian Grammar and Texts'', second revised and expanded edition.]&lt;/ref&gt;

"emesal features actually appear in the speech of real women in the "Dialogues Between Two Women""&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go2081/is_2_121/ai_n28858458/ Gonzalo Rubio : "Inanna And Dumuzi: A Sumerian Love Story"
''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', April–June, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Eme-sal (language of women) to Eme-ku (language of men) phonemic correspondences are :&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-7s4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq= ''J.A.O.S.'', vol 24 (1903) pp. 103-128 J. Dyneley Prince : "The Hymn to Bêlit". p. 126]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Eme-sal /m/, /b/, /d/ = Eme-ku /g/
*Eme-sal /ê/ = Eme-ku /u/ {Cf. that for "the [[English language|English]] sound system we have express statements by old grammarians that women had a more advanced pronunciation than men, and characteristically enough these statements refer to the raising of the vowels in the direction of ['''i''']".&lt;ref&gt;Jespersen 1922, chapter XIII, section 6 "Phonetics and grammar", p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;}
*Eme-sal /š/ = Eme-ku /z/
*Eme-sal /l/ = Eme-ku /n/

In eastern [[Siberia]], "[[Chukchi language|Chukchi]] women's language differs from the Chukchi men's variety in a number of synchronically unpredictable ways, particularly with respect to an alternation between r and c/č. ... this alternation is nonarbitrary, originating from the asymmetric collapse of three cognate sets into two, such that in men's Chukchi *r and *d &gt; r and *c &gt; č, whereas in women's Chukchi *r &gt; r and *d and *c &gt; c."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=1159139 ''Anthropological linguistics'', Vol. 42, no. 3 (Fall 2000).Michael Dunn : "Chukchi Women’s Language: A Historical-Comparative Perspective".]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pacific Islands==
In the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]], "the women engaged in the beating had a system of signalling by blows and intervals from valley to valley. This is a very primitive kind of [[telegraphy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Mason 1899, p. 196 -- citing :- Brigham, ''Cat, Bishop Mus.'', Honolulu, 1892, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Americas==
"The robes of buffalo hide on which a great deal of picture writing was done were all wrought by women, and ... among the [[Plains Indians]] the women have a picture language unknown to the men."&lt;ref&gt;Mason 1899, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

"the earliest observation of a difference between the language of men and that of women was apparently that of [[Raymond Breton]] ... in [[Guadeloupe|Guadéloupe]] and [[Dominica]].  ... it seems that the island [[Carib languages|Carib]] have two distinct vocabularies, and used by men and by women when speaking to men, and the other used by women when speaking to each other, and by men when repeating in ''oratio obliqua'' some saying of the women. ... 
In the [[Abipón language|language of the Abipon]]es some words varied according to sex."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2aHQVyZ8b4cC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=  Crawley 1927, p. 54]&lt;/ref&gt;
"Of the [[Guaykuruan languages|Guaycuru]]s of the [[Gran Chaco]] ... "... the speech of the men is wholly, or at least in certain words, different from that of the men." The Karaya have a special women’s dialect ... . 
The [[Eskimo languages|Eskimo]] women of the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie Delta]] have a special expressions, words, and terminations which the men do not use."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2aHQVyZ8b4cC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=  Crawley 1927, p. 55]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Lesser Antilles]], "words special to one or the other sex are found most frequently in the names of the various degrees of [[kinship]] ; thus, ... for maternal uncle, son (elder son, younger son), brother-in-law, wife, mother, grandmother, daughter, cousin all of these are different according as a man or a woman is speaking. It is the same with the names of some though far from all, of the different parts of the body".&lt;ref&gt;Jespersen 1922, chapter XIII, section 1 "Women’s languages", p. 238 -- citing :-  Rochefort : ''Histoire naturelle et morale des les Antilles'' (2e ed., Rotterdam, 1665, p. 449 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
"With the [[Chiquitos]] in [[Bolivia]], ... men indicate by the addition of -tii that a male person is spoken about, while the women do not use this suffix and thus make no distinction between ' he ' and ' she,' ' his ' and ' her.' ... To many substantives the men prefix a vowel which the women do not employ.&lt;ref&gt;Jespersen 1922, chapter XIII, section 2 "Tabu", p. 240 -- citing :- V. Henry, "Sur le parler des hommes et le parler des femmes dans la langue chiquita," ''Revue de linguistique'', xii. 305, 1879&lt;/ref&gt; {Cf. the difference between [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] of [[Nigeria]] and Fǫn of [[Dahomey]], in that Yoruba prefixes to many substantives a vowel which Fǫn does not employ.}

"Similar gender-associated languages" include [[Yanomaman languages|Yanomama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.skadi.net/archive/index.php/t-54133.html ''Antiquity'', Dec 1993 v67 n257 p747(14) "A social prehistory of European languages" -- citing :- HILL, J. 1978.

The '''Goilalan languages''' are a group of languages placed in the [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans–New Guinea]] [[language family|family]] by [[Stephen Wurm]] (1975) and tentatively retained there in the classification of [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]] (2005). The languages,

*[[Tauade language|Tauade]]
*Northern (Kunimaipa): [[Biangai language|Biangai]]–[[Kunimaipa language|Kunimaipa]]–[[Weri language|Weri]], 
are clearly related, especially northern Biagai, Kunimaipa, and Weri, which might be considered divergent dialects.  Pronouns are northern 1sg ''ne'', 2sg ''ni'', 3sg ''pi''; Tauade/Fuyug 1sg ''na'', 2sg ''nu'', though Tauade also has the possessive pronouns {{lang|ttd|ne-ve}}, {{lang|ttd|ni-e}}.

[[Image:Taj Mahal in March 2004.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Taj Mahal]] unites Persian and Indian elements. It is the mausoleum of [[Mumtaz Mahal]], the Persian wife of Mughal Emperor [[Shah Jahan]].]]
'''Indo-Persian culture''' refers to those [[Persian culture|Persian aspects]] that have been integrated into or absorbed into the cultures of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

Persian influence was first introduced to the Indian subcontinent by [[Islamic rulers in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim rulers]] of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Ethnic groups in Afghanistan|Afghan]] origin, especially with the [[Delhi Sultanate]] from the 13th century, and in the 16th to 19th century by the [[Mughal Empire]]. In general, from its earliest days, aspects of the culture and language were brought to the Indian subcontinent by various [[Persianate society|Persianized]] Central Asian Turkic and Afghan rulers,&lt;ref&gt;Sigfried J. de Laet. [https://books.google.nl/books?id=PvlthkbFU1UC&amp;pg=PA734&amp;dq=persian+language+in+anatolia&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAWoVChMIs-fO2_aRxgIVygYsCh2NJgBM#v=onepage&amp;q=persian%20language%20in%20anatolia&amp;f=false ''History of Humanity: From the seventh to the sixteenth century''] UNESCO, 1994. {{ISBN|9231028138}} p 734&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]] in the 11th century.

[[Persian language|Persian]] was the official language of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], the [[Bahamani Sultanate]], the [[Mughal Empire]], and their successor states, as well as the cultured language of poetry and literature. Many of the [[Sultan]]s and nobility in the Sultanate period were [[Persianised Turks]] from [[Central Asia]] who spoke [[Turkic languages]] as their mother tongues. The [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] were also culturally Persianized Central Asians (of [[Turco-Mongol]] origin on their paternal side), but spoke [[Chagatai language|Chagatai Turkic]] as their first language at the beginning, before eventually adopting Persian. Persian became the preferred language of the Muslim elite of north India. Muzaffar Alam, a noted scholar of Mughal and Indo-Persian history, suggests that Persian became the official ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the empire under [[Akbar]] for various political and social factors due to its non-sectarian and fluid nature.&lt;ref&gt;Alam, Muzaffar. "The Pursuit of Persian: Language in Mughal Politics." In ''Modern Asian Studies'', vol. 32, no. 2. (May, 1998), pp. 317–349.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of these languages led to a [[vernacular]] called [[Hindustani_language|Hindustani]] that is the ancestor of today's [[Urdu]] and [[Hindi]].

== In contemporary India and Pakistan ==
{{See also|Persian language in South Asia|Persian and Urdu}}
Indo-Persian culture has helped produce certain composite traditions within the Indian subcontinent that survive to this day, of which the [[Urdu language]] and literature is notable. The legacy of Indo-Persianate culture moreover can also be seen in much of the Mughal architecture within [[Architecture of Lahore|Lahore]], Delhi and Agra, latterly of which the Taj Mahal is world-renowned. Hindustani classical music also received some influence from the Persian culture, but the nature of these influences remain unclear. In many ways, the absorption and assimilation of Persian or Persianate culture within India may be compared to the gradual (if sometimes problematic) absorption of English, British or Western culture generally of which the English language is perhaps the most notable and controversial within both India and Pakistan today. The influence of [[Persian language]] moreover may be seen in the considerable proportion of loanwords absorbed into the vernaculars of the north and north-west of the Indian subcontinent including [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Urdu]], [[Hindi]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]].

==History==
With the presence of [[Muslim]] culture in the region in the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid period]], [[Lahore]] and [[Uch]] were established as centers of [[Persian literature]]. [[Abu-al-Faraj Runi]] and [[Masud Sa'd Salman]] (d. 1121) were the two earliest major Indo-Persian poets based in Lahore. The earliest of the "great" Indo-Persian poets was [[Amir Khusrow]] (d. 1325) of [[Delhi]], who has since attained iconic status within the Urdu speakers of the Indian subcontinent as, among other things, the "father" of  Urdu literature.

===Delhi sultanate and the Mughal era===
{{See also|Persians in the Mughal Empire}}[[Image:Basawan - Alexander Visits the Sage Plato.jpg|thumb|''[[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] Visits the Sage [[Plato]]'', from ''Khamsa-e Nizami'' by the Indo-Persian poet [[Amir Khusro]].]]
Indo-Persian culture and to varying degrees also Turkic culture flourished side-by-side during the period of the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526). The invasion of Babur in 1526, the end of the Delhi Sultanate, and the establishment of what would become the [[Mughal Empire]] would usher the golden age of Indo-Persian culture with particular reference to the art and architecture of the Mughal era.

The Mughal Era to the [[British Raj]]: [[Persian language|Persian]] persisted as the language of the Mughals up to and including the year 1707 which marked the death of the [[Aurangzeb|Emperor Aurangzeb]], generally considered the last of the "Great Mughals". Thereafter, with the decline of the Mughal empire, the 1739 invasion of Delhi by [[Nader Shah]] and the gradual growth initially of the [[Maratha Empire|Hindu Marathas]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=aqqBPS1TDUgC&amp;pg=PA28 Delhi, the Capital of India By Anon, John Capper, p.28. "This source establishes the Maratha control of Delhi before the British"]&lt;/ref&gt; and later the [[Europe]]an power within the Indian subcontinent, Persian or Persian culture commenced a period of decline although it nevertheless enjoyed patronage and may even have flourished within the many regional empires or kingdoms of the Indian subcontinent including that of the Sikh Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] (r. 1799–1837).

Persian as a language of governance and education was abolished in 1839 by the [[United Kingdom|British]] and the last Mughal emperor [[Bahadur Shah Zafar]], even if his rule was purely symbolic or ceremonial, was overthrown in 1857 by the British.

Further, C.E. Bosworth wrote about the Central Asian's Persian ([[Tājik people|Tajiks]]→[[Ghurids]]) influence on India:
''"...The sultans were generous patrons of the Persian literary traditions of Khorasan, and latterly fulfilled a valuable role as transmitters of this heritage to the newly conquered lands of northern India, laying the foundations for the essentially Persian culture which was to prevail in Muslim India until the 19th century..."''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ghurids Iranica: GHURIDS or Āl-e Šansab; a medieval Islamic dynasty of the eastern Iranian lands.&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval  [[Bahamani Sultanate]] and its successor [[Deccan sultanates]] of Central India had heavy Persian influence. The Bahamani sultans actively recruited Persian or Persianized men in their administration. Sultan Firuz (1397-1422) would send ships from his ports in [[Goa]] and [[Chaul]]to the [[Persian Gulf]] to bring back talented men of letters, administrators, jurists, soldiers and artisans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eaton|first1=Richard M.|title=The new Cambridge history of India.|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521254847|pages=51–52|edition=1. publ.|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=cGd2huLXEVYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR12&amp;dq=bahamani+persian+deccan&amp;ots=YbRQ7iir5F&amp;sig=LalqoXiPCvXbBqLFOLnRBv4FA2M#v=onepage&amp;q=%20persian%20culture&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high born Iranian [[Mahmud Gawan]] (1411-1481) who rose to become a powerful a powerful minister of that state during the reign of another Bahamani Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eaton|first1=Richard M.|title=The new Cambridge history of India.|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521254847|pages=59–72|edition=1. publ.|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=cGd2huLXEVYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR12&amp;dq=bahamani+persian+deccan&amp;ots=YbRQ7iir5F&amp;sig=LalqoXiPCvXbBqLFOLnRBv4FA2M#v=onepage&amp;q=%20persian%20culture&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Richard Eaton, even the Hindu [[Vijayanagara]] empire from the same period was highly Persianized in its Culture. The royal quarters of the capital had many Persian architectural elements such as domes and vaulted arches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eaton|first1=Richard M.|title=The new Cambridge history of India.|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521254847|pages=99–101|edition=1. publ.|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=cGd2huLXEVYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR12&amp;dq=bahamani+persian+deccan&amp;ots=YbRQ7iir5F&amp;sig=LalqoXiPCvXbBqLFOLnRBv4FA2M#v=onepage&amp;q=%20persian%20culture&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahmani Sultanate disintegrated into five [[Deccan sultanates|Deccan Sultanates]], similar in culture. [[Hyderabad]], built by the [[Golconda Sultanate]] in the 16th century, was inspired from [[Isfahan]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Persianate-culture-forms-intrinsic-part-of-Hyderabad/articleshow/11369711.cms|title=‘Persianate culture forms intrinsic part of Hyderabad’ - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Persian as a court language in Hyderabad continued under the [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizams of Hyderabad]], and was only replaced by Urdu in 1886.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The court language during the Deccan sultanate period was Persian or Arabic, however, the local [[Marathi language]] was widely used during the period especially by [[Adil Shahi]] of Bijapur and the [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Stewart|title=Cambridge History of India: The Marathas 1600-1818|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-26883-7|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iHK-BhVXOU4C&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=marathi++nizamshahi+stewart+gordon#v=onepage&amp;q=deshastha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rulers were Muslims, the local feudal landlords and the revenue collectors were Hindus and so was the majority of the population. Political expediency made it important for the sultans to make use of Marathi. Nevertheless, Marathi in official documents from the era is totally [[Persian language in South Asia|Persian]]ised in its vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1992|title=DECCAN (MAHARASHTRA) UNDER THE MUSLIM RULERS FROM KHALJIS TO SHIVAJI : A STUDY IN INTERACTION, PROFESSOR S.M KATRE Felicitation|jstor=42930434|journal=Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute|volume=51/52,|pages=501–510|last1=Kulkarni|first1=G.T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian influence continues to this day with many Persian derived words used in every day speech such as bagh (Garden), karkhana (factory), Shahar (city),  bāzār (market), dukān (shop), hoshiār (clever), kāḡhaz (paper), khurchi (&lt; khurchi (chair), zamin (land), zahirāt (advertisement), and  hazār (thousand).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Qasemi|first1=S.

=== After the British Raj===
Given that the Mughals had historically symbolized Indo-Persian culture to one degree or another, the overthrow of Bahadhur Shah Zafar and the institution of the British Raj in 1858 may be considered as marking the end of the Indo-Persian era, even if, after [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|First War of Independence in 1857]], Persian would still retain an audience and even produce commendable literature such as the philosophical poetry of [[Muhammad Iqbal]] (d. 1938). In [[Pakistan]], [[Urdu]] and other regional languages retain extensive Persian vocabulary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6966">'''Institutes of Religion''' are local organizations that provide religious education for young adults (ages 18–30) who are members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). Local institutes may function in church [[Meeting house#Religious meeting houses|meetinghouses]], but may also have a stand-alone building situated adjacent to [[college]]s or [[University|universities]] (especially those found in the [[Mormon Corridor]] areas in the [[Western United States]] and [[Canada]]). The LDS Church describes the purpose of the Institute program as "weekday religious instruction for single and married postsecondary students."&lt;ref&gt;[http://institute.lds.org "Institutes of Religion." institute.lds.org]{{specify|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutes of Religion are professionally directed as part of the [[Church Educational System]], with responsibility for the [[Seminary#LDS Youth seminaries|seminary]] program and the church's higher education institutions, including [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU).

In addition to offering classes, Institutes often sponsor activities, such as dances, aimed at the needs of [[Higher education|postsecondary]] students between 18–30 years old. Young adult church members are encouraged, although not required, to be enrolled in an Institute class whenever possible. In areas with a large LDS population, there are often [[Special needs|special-needs]] Institutes that serve adults who have [[Mental retardation|mental]] or physical handicaps. These Institutes adapt their curricula to meet individual student needs. 

Among the standard Institute course offerings are classes on the [[Book of Mormon]], [[Old Testament]], [[New Testament]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and other [[Revelation#In the Latter Day Saint Movement|modern revelation]]. Institute classes are offered on campus at LDS higher education institutions, such as BYU. However, BYU students are required to take religion classes offered by the university. Students can transfer Institute [[course credit]] to BYU for a nominal charge and can graduate from the Institute program after completing 14 course [[Carnegie Unit and Student Hour|credit hours]].

The first Institute of Religion was established in 1926 in [[Moscow, Idaho]], adjacent to the [[University of Idaho]]. Its first director was [[J. Wyley Sessions]].  There are currently 350,000 students in over 2,700 locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lds.org/si/institute/about/faq?lang=eng|title=Frequently Asked Questions—Institute|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=August 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
[[File:CSULBInstitute.jpg|thumb|Institute of Religion at [[California State University, Long Beach]].]]
Each institute has an Institute Director who is hired by [[Church Educational System|Seminaries and Institutes of Religion]] (S&amp;I). An Institute Council consists of [[students]] appointed by the local [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] or [[Branch President|branch president]]. The Institute Council is a non-paid, voluntary position. Ultimate responsibility for the Institute program falls on the Church Board of Education, which is composed of the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], three members of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], and other leaders of the LDS Church.

Institute directors often cover large areas. At times Institute directors may be based at a large university with many LDS students and multiple classes where other teachers assist them, but they may also teach an institute class once a week at one or more other universities in the same general area with fewer LDS students.  For example, as of fall 2009, the director of the LDS Institute of Religion in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], taught one class a week at [[Eastern Michigan University]] and another weekly class at [[Wayne State University]]. These were each held on campus under the sponsorship of the [[LDS Student Association]]. The director also taught multiple classes at the institute building adjacent to the [[University of Michigan]], while other classes were taught by an S&amp;I missionary couple and part-time, volunteer instructors.&lt;ref&gt;2009 Ann Arbor Institute Class Schedule{{full|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expanded Institute==
By the early 1990s, it was realized that young adults, especially young single adults, who did not attend college or were not currently in college could benefit from Institute.  This included the fact that many schools had few LDS students attending them, and the nature of [[community colleges]] meant that there was not an easy concentration of LDS Students. In 1992, the church launched the expanded institute program, with the goal of having virtually every [[stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake]] offer at least one institute class. These new institute classes were generally taught by volunteer instructors under the same lines of supervision as seminary teachers. The rule for attending institute was either being a young single adult or being a student. All single members of the LDS Church under the age of 31 were encouraged to attend institute where possible.

==Institute Outreach Center/Center for Young Adults==
Starting in the first years of the 21st century, and accelerating under the leadership of [[L. Tom Perry]] while he served as president of the Europe Central [[Area (LDS Church)|Area]], the church developed a program called the "Institute Outreach Center", later renamed the "Center for Young Adults". This center focused on four aspects, including institute courses. The others included an activity council that would plan activities geared towards outreach, full-time missionaries who focused on reaching out to men and women of their own age group, and a senior missionary couple that would provide practical and spiritual guidance for the endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ldschurchnewsarchive.com/articles/49379/A-key-to-Europe.html |title= A key to Europe: Young single adults are vital to the strength of the Church |newspaper= [[Church News]] |date= September 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Baccalaureate''' ('''IB'''), formerly known as the '''International Baccalaureate Organization''' ('''IBO'''), is an international educational [[foundation (charity)|foundation]] headquartered in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], and founded in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ibo.org/offices/hq/index.cfm IB headquarters] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519202704/http://www.ibo.org/offices/hq/index.cfm |date=19 May 2009 }}."

==History==

===Inception===
When [[Marie-Thérèse Maurette]] wrote "Educational Techniques for Peace. Do They Exist?" in 1948,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumni.ecolint.net/authors/walker.html|title=George Walker|work=ecolint.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; she created the framework for what would eventually become the [[IB Diploma Programme]] (IBDP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Resources Publications |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0015/001582/158270eb.pdf| accessdate=8 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1960s, a group of teachers from the [[International School of Geneva]] (Ecolint) created the International Schools Examinations Syndicate (ISES), which would later become the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) and then the International Baccalaureate (IB).&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite book |title=International Education: Principles and Practice |editors=Mary Hayden and Jeff Thompson |edition=2nd |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=9780749436162 |author=Elisabeth Fox |chapter= The Emergence of the International Baccalaureate as an Impetus to Curriculum Reform |page= 141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First programme===
The IB headquarters were officially established in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1968 for the development and maintenance of the IB Diploma Programme. The objective of this programme was to "provide an internationally acceptable university admissions qualification suitable for the growing mobile population of young people whose parents were part of the world of diplomacy, international and multi-national organizations" by offering standardized courses and assessments for students aged 16 to 19.&lt;ref name="IBDP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibo.org/diploma/ |title=International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme |accessdate=2007-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International Education: Principles and Practice |editors=Mary Ray Hayden and Jeff William Thompson |edition=2nd |publisher=Routledge |year=2001|isbn=9780749436162 |author=Mary Hayden|chapter= Global Issues: A Necessary Component of a Balanced Curriculum for the Twenty-First Century |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International Baccalaureate North America (IBNA) was established in 1975&lt;ref name="Peterson2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Peterson |first=Alexander Duncan Campbell |title=Schools Across Frontiers: The Story of the International Baccalaureate and the United World Colleges |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nTUjMNjNo3EC&amp;pg=PP4 |year=2003 |publisher=Open Court Publishing |isbn=978-0-8126-9505-2 |p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Peter Nehr, International Baccalaureate Africa, Europe and Middle-East (IBAEM) in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; and International Baccalaureate Asia Pacific (IBAP) during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other programmes===
The IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) was first offered in 1994. Within five years, 51 countries had MYP schools.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; A revised MYP programme was introduced in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibo.org/myp/|title=IB Middle Years Programme at a glance|work=ibo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) was piloted in 1996 in 30 primary schools on different continents, and the first PYP school was authorised in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibo.org/history/timeline/|title=International Baccalaureate|work=ibo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 87 authorised schools in 43 countries within five years.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

The IB Career-related Programme (formerly IB Career-related Certificate&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibo.org/announcements/2014/ibcp.cfm{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;) was first offered in 2012.

===Directors===
[[Alec Peterson]] was IB's first director general (1968–1977), followed by Gérard Renaud (1977–1983), Roger Peel (1983–1998), Derek Blackman (1998–1999), [[George Walker (professor)|George Walker]] (1999–2005), [[Jeffrey Beard]] (2006–2013) and Dr. Siva Kumari (appointed 2013, incumbent from 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IBO History |url=http://www.ibo.org/history/ |publisher=ibo.org |accessdate=6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The IB learner profile==

As the IB's mission in action, the learner profile concisely describes the aspirations of a global community that shares the values underlying the IB's educational philosophy. The IB learner profile describes the attributes and outcomes of education for international-mindedness. IB learners strive to be:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibo.org/globalassets/digital-tookit/flyers-and-artworks/learner-profile-en.pdf |title=Learner Profile}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Thinkers

The IB is a not-for-profit educational foundation. The IB maintains its Foundation Office in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. The Assessment Centre is located in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]] and the curriculum centre moved in 2011 to [[The Hague, Netherlands]]. Three Global Centres have been opened: [[Bethesda, Maryland]] (within the metropolitan area of [[Washington, DC]]) in the United States, [[Singapore]] and The Hague.

The organisation is divided into three regional centres: IB Africa, Europe and Middle East (IBAEM), administered from The Hague; IB Americas (IBA), administered from Bethesda; and IB Asia-Pacific (IBAP), administered from Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibo.org/offices/regions/|title=IB Global Centres |publisher=Ibo.org |date= |accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sub-regional associations "are groups formed by and for IB school practitioners to assist IB schools, teachers and students in their communities—from implementing IB programmes to providing a forum for dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibo.org/contact-the-ib/associations-of-ib-schools/|title=Associations of IB World Schools|accessdate= 18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently fifty-six (56) sub-regional associations, including:

In 2003, the IB established the IB Fund, incorporated in the United States, for the purpose of enhancing fundraising and keeping funds raised separate from operational funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|authorlink=|author2=|date=August 2004|title=The president's view on Fundraising and the strategic plan|trans_title=|journal=IB World|volume=40|issue=|page=8|id=|publisher=International Baccalaureate Organization|url=http://www.ibo.org/ibworld/documents/aug04.pdf|accessdate=13 July 2009|quote=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615210819/http://ibo.org/ibworld/documents/aug04.pdf|archive-date=15 June 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the IB approved a strategic plan to "ensure that programmes and services are of the highest quality" and "to provide access to people who are socio-economically disadvantaged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|authorlink=|author2=|date=August 2004|title=IBO strategic plan approved|trans_title=|journal=IB World|volume=40|issue=|page=2|id=|publisher=International Baccalaureate Organization|url=http://www.ibo.org/ibworld/documents/aug04.pdf|accessdate=13 July 2009|quote=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615210819/http://ibo.org/ibworld/documents/aug04.pdf|archive-date=15 June 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 and 2015 the strategic plans were updated after substantial consultation. The vision for the next 5 years was to more consciously establish the IB as a leader in international education and the Board outlined a vision and four strategic goals with key strategic objectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibo.org/mission/strategy/index.cfm Strategic plan]. Ibo.org. Retrieved on 17 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Access remains fundamental to the mission of the IB and a variety of initiatives and projects are helping to take it forward in [[Ecuador]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[South Africa]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Spain]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibo.org/facts/annualreview/documents/annual_review_2012.pdf|title=IB Annual Review|accessdate=17 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014105751/http://www.ibo.org/facts/annualreview/documents/annual_review_2012.pdf|archive-date=14 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has the largest number of IB programmes (2,010 out of 5,586) offered in both private and public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibo.org/programmes/find-an-ib-school/?SearchFields.Region=&amp;SearchFields.Country=US |title=Find an IB World School|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IB works with governments and non-governmental organizations across the world and has consultative status as a non-governmental organisation (NGO) at United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) and has collaborative relationships with the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie]] (OIF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibo.org/partnerships/governments/|title=Governments|accessdate=14 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304005302/http://www.ibo.org/partnerships/governments/|archive-date=4 March 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
The IB governance is composed of an IB Board of Governors and six committees (access and advancement, audit, education, finance, human resources and governance). The Board of Governors appoints the Director General, sets the strategic direction of the organisation, adopts a mission statement, makes policy, oversees the IB's financial management, and ensures autonomy and integrity of the IB Diploma Programme examinations and other student assessment. The structure of its different committees are based on respect, representation and collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibo.org/about-the-ib/governance-and-leadership/|title=Governance and leadership|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board of Governors can comprise between 15 and 25 members. Members are elected by the Board on the recommendation of the governance committee, and from nominations presented from the Heads Council, Regional Councils and the Board. To encourage diversity of gender, culture and geography, there are only three ex officio positions: Director General (non-voting), the chair of the Examining Board and the chair of the Heads Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibo.org/council/|title=The IB Board of Governors|accessdate=22 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302003650/http://ibo.org/council/|archive-date=2 March 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advisory bodies include the Heads Council and Regional Councils&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibo.org/about-the-ib/governance-and-leadership/advisory-bodies/|title=Advisory Bodies|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IB Diploma Programme was described as "a rigorous, off-the-shelf curriculum recognized by universities around the world" when it was featured in the December 18, 2006, edition of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' titled "How to bring our schools out of the 20th Century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1568480-3,00.html|title=How to bring our schools out of the 20th Century|work=Time|accessdate=16 July 2009|last=Wallis|first=Claudia|date=10 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IBDP was also featured in the summer 2002 edition of ''American Educator,'' where Robert Rothman described it as "a good example of an effective, instructionally sound, exam-based system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.aft.org/pubs-reports/american_educator/summer2002/testworthteaching.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601181911/http://archive.aft.org/pubs-reports/american_educator/summer2002/testworthteaching.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-06-01|title=A test worth teaching to|work=American Educator|accessdate=14 June 2010|last=Rothman|first=Robert|date=Summer 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

The IB conducts its own research or commissions research from renowned universities or research institutions around the globe. Research is used to understand and track the implementation and impact of the IB's programmes or to support development of the programmes. There is also a wealth of third party research available:
* The International Education Research Database is a source for references concerning research publications related to ‘international education’, ‘international schools’ and ‘International Baccalaureate’. It provides links to the original sources.
* The ''Journal of Research in International Education'' often contains articles related to research on the IB or International Education.
* Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) in the UK examined the characteristics and trends of IB students compared to A-level and other student groups at universities and documented the results in a comprehensive report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibo.org/about-the-ib/research/programme-impact-research/diploma-studies/|title=Diploma Years Studies – Research – International Baccalaureate®|work=International Baccalaureate®|access-date=29 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328073238/http://ibo.org/about-the-ib/research/programme-impact-research/diploma-studies/|archive-date=28 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of plagiarism==

[[Jeffrey Beard]], a past director-general of International Baccalaureate, gave a talk on "Education for a Better World" on 5 August 2010 at the [[Chautauqua Institution]] in [[New York State]].  The institution issued a statement the next day in which it expressed "genuine disappointment" with the talk, noting that it "drew heavily upon and quoted extensively from a speech given earlier in the year by Sir Ken Robinson", while adding that he "neglected to cite his source or reveal the quotations for what they were".&lt;ref name="red-handed"&gt;{{cite journal |author=William Stewart |title=Caught red-handed: IB boss plagiarising |journal=[[Times Educational Supplement]] |url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6058168 |date=17 September 2010 |accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Robinson (British author)|Ken Robinson]] is a renowned British educationist who lives in the United States. Through an IB spokesperson, Beard admitted that "he could have been more explicit about the sources and authors that inspired him for the content of this speech".&lt;ref name="red-handed"/&gt; In a letter sent to heads of schools that offer the IB curricula, he described this as an "unfortunate incident" due to an "oversight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=William Stewart |title=IB chief pleads 'oversight' led to plagiarisation speech |journal=[[Times Educational Supplement]] |url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6060266 |date=8 October 2010 |accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an apparently unrelated development, the ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]'' revealed on 8 October 2010, that significant portions of one of IB's marking guides for the IB Diploma Programme was lifted wholesale from unattributed websites, including Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=William Stewart |title=IB lifted exam marking guides from Wikipedia |journal=[[Times Educational Supplement]] |url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6060245 |date=10 October 2010 |accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to schools, IB director-general Beard wrote: "We have and always will take immediate and appropriate action when we discover any violation of our policies or standards."

'''''K-19: The Widowmaker''''' is a 2002 [[Historical period drama|historical]] [[submarine films|submarine film]] about the first of many disasters that befell the [[Soviet submarine K-19|Soviet submarine ''K-19'']].

''K-19: The Widowmaker'' was directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]], and stars [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Liam Neeson]]. The screenplay was adapted by Christopher Kyle, with the story written by [[Louis Nowra]], based on real-life events depicted in a book by [[Peter Huchthausen]]. The film is an international [[Co-production (media)|co-production]] between the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada.{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Plot==
{{long plot|date=October 2017}}
In 1961, the [[Soviet Union]] launches its first ballistic missile [[nuclear submarine]], the [[Soviet submarine K-19|''K-19'']], commanded by Captain Alexei Vostrikov ([[Harrison Ford]]), aided by [[executive officer]] Mikhail Polenin ([[Liam Neeson]]). Polenin was the crew's original captain, and they have served together for some time; Vostrikov's appointment is alleged to have been aided by his wife's political connections, as well as Polenin's tendency to put the crew's morale and safety before the pride of the Soviet Union. During his first inspection, Vostrikov discovers the reactor officer to be drunk and asleep on duty and sacks him, ordering Polenin to request a replacement.

The replacement reactor officer, Vadim Radtchenko ([[Peter Sarsgaard]]), is fresh from the naval academy's nuclear program. Before the launch, the medical officer is killed when struck by an oncoming truck, and is replaced by command's foremost medical officer, who hails from the army and has never been out to sea. During the official launch of the ''K-19'', the bottle of champagne fails to break when it strikes the bow, considered to be a sign of ill fortune (according to some naval traditions, a young woman is supposed to break a bottle of alcoholic/celebratory beverage against a ship's hull at its christening/maiden launch; if the bottle did not break, it was taken to be an ill omen).

With Captain Vostrikov's constant drilling, the crew's performance improves. The first mission of the ''K-19'' is to surface in the Arctic to fire an unarmed [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] as a test, then to patrol a zone in the Atlantic within striking range of [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] as a Soviet deterrent to American ambitions. To test the submarine's limits, Vostrikov orders the ''K-19'' to submerge past its maximum operational depth of 250 meters to a depth closer to its "crush depth" (300 meters), then surface rapidly at full-speed to break through the Arctic pack-ice, estimated at no more than one meter thick. Polenin regards this maneuver as dangerous and storms off the bridge. Scraping along the underside of the ice, the ''K-19'' breaks through with little difficulty. The test missile is launched successfully.

En route to the patrolling area, a pipe for the [[Nuclear reactor#Cooling|reactor cooling system]] springs a leak and then bursts completely. Control rods are inserted to stop the reactor, but without coolant the reactor temperature continues to rise rapidly. During an officers' review of emergency protocols, it is revealed that back-up coolant systems were not installed; without these, the protocols are useless (they are based on the assumption that back-up systems are in place). The ''K-19'' surfaces to contact fleet command about the accident and await orders. The cable for the long-range transmitter antenna on the [[conning tower]], however, is damaged, possibly due to the earlier surfacing maneuver in the Arctic.

An engineering team conceives a plan to rig a makeshift coolant system; because Polenin has discovered that the submarine was supplied with chemical, not nuclear, suits, teams are instructed to work in 10-minute shifts to limit radiation exposure. The first group emerges vomiting and heavily blistered; the second and third teams succeed in cooling the reactor, but all are severely ill with radiation poisoning. As radiation levels slowly rise inside the ship, the submarine surfaces and most of the crewmen are ordered topside. Radtchenko, the reactor officer, is initially assigned to go as part of the third team to finish the operation, but his fear upon witnessing the first team's radiation injuries overtakes him, and the [[Glavny starshina|crew chief]] joins the third team in his place.

A United States Navy helicopter from a nearby [[destroyer]] approaches the ''K-19''; the destroyer and asks if the ''K-19'' requires assistance. Vostrikov tells the destroyer "no" and refuses to allow the Americans anywhere near ''K-19''. Back in the [[Soviet Union]], the government worries about the condition of the ''K-19'' because it has ceased contact with fleet command (due to its disabled long-range communicator) but has been spotted by Soviet spy aircraft in the vicinity of the American destroyer.

With the hope that fleet command will send some diesel submarines to tow the ''K-19'' back to port, Vostrikov ceases the mission and orders a heading that would return to port, but at a pace that could kill the entire crew with radiation sickness if rescue is not forthcoming. Shortly thereafter, the repair crews' pipework springs leaks and the reactor temperature begins to rise once again. This incites unrest among some of the crew, and in an accident, fuel that had been previously removed from a torpedo ignites, causing a fire in that compartment. Initially ordering the emergency fire suppression system to be activated (which would deprive the fire of oxygen, but suffocate anyone inside that area), Vostrikov is talked down by Polenin, who personally goes to assist the fire crew in putting out the fire. This leaves Vostrikov facing some hostile crew and officers who no longer have Polenin present to moderate them, and two officers enact a pre-planned mutiny to remove Vostrikov from command. Radtchenko, who earlier panicked and backed out from joining the repair crews, this time enters the reactor area alone and commences a second repair attempt.

Polenin returns to the command deck after helping put out the torpedo room fire; upon seeing Vostrikov handcuffed to a ladder, he deceives the mutineers into handing over their weapons, places them under arrest, and then frees Vostrikov. Believing the repairs to have failed and unaware that Radtchenko had gone in alone to patch up the new leaks, Vostrikov, at the behest of Polenin, tells the crew what has happened, and his rationale for a subsequent dive to attempt another repair; he is afraid that if the reactor were to overheat, it could set off the actual nuclear warheads carried by the ''K-19'' and the accident would destroy not just the ''K-19'' but also the nearby American ship, provoking an American retaliatory attack and possibly inciting nuclear war. Vostrikov then waits for the crew to respond to his recommendation; the crew subsequently responds in the affirmative, and the ''K-19'' dives. Vostrikov then goes back to the reactor section after hailing Radtchenko and receiving no reply. Radtchenko's repairs were successful, but he received a heavier dose of radiation than earlier teams, having stayed in 18 minutes to complete his repair. Unable to see and too weak to properly extricate himself from the reactor chamber, Radtchenko is dragged out personally by Captain Vostrikov. The repairs prevent a reactor meltdown, but radiation is leaking throughout the submarine due to irradiated steam leakage from the reactor's damage.

A Soviet diesel submarine finally reaches the ''K-19''; it relays orders from fleet command to confine the crew on the submarine until a freighter can pick them up. Knowing it would be too dangerous to stay, Vostrikov orders the crew to be evacuated to the diesel submarine, despite knowing he will most likely lose his command and be sent to a [[gulag]] for countermanding a direct order. The crew is evacuated and returns to the Soviet Union, without having to receive assistance from the nearby Americans. After the incident, Captain Vostrikov is tried for endangering the mission and disobeying a direct order, but Polenin and the other officers and crew of the ''K-19'' come to his defense.

==Epilogue==

Epilogue lead-in text indicates that charges against Captain Vostrikov were dropped, but that the former crew of the ''K-19'' is ordered to maintain silence regarding the incident, and Vostrikov is never given command of a submarine again. All seven men who went into the reactor chamber to effect repairs died of radiation poisoning days after returning home, and twenty other crew members later died from radiation sickness acquired during the incident. It is not until the fall of Communism nearly three decades later that the members of the ''K-19'' crew could openly discuss what happened.

Later in 1989, an aged Captain Vostrikov meets Polenin on the anniversary of the day they were rescued. The commanders enter a cemetery where ''K-19'' survivors have met since the incident. Vostrikov is visibly moved as he greets the men and informs them that he nominated the crewmen who died from [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation poisoning]]—28 in total—for the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] award, but was told the honor was reserved for combat veterans. Remarking that "what good are honors from such people," referring to the committee that turned down his recommendation, Vostrikov toasts the survivors and the deceased crew who sacrificed their lives to honor their duty to their crewmates.

==Production==
"The Widowmaker" nickname was used only in the film. In real life, the submarine had no nickname until the nuclear accident on July 3, 1961, when she got her actual nickname "Hiroshima".&lt;ref&gt;Huchthausen 2002, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

''K-19: The Widowmaker'' cost $100 million to produce,&lt;ref name = "dvdmg"&gt;[http://www.dvdmg.com/k19.shtml "K-19: The Widowmaker (2002)."] ''DVDmg.com'', March 14, 2009.

Retrieved: July 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was not financed by a major studio (''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'' was owned by National Geographic Partners, a joint venture with [[21st Century Fox]] and The National Geographic Society), making it one of the most expensive independent films to-date. ''K-19: The Widowmaker'' was filmed in [[Canada]], specifically [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]; [[Gimli, Manitoba]]; and [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]].

The producers made some efforts to work with the original crew of ''K-19'', who took exception to the first version of the [[screenplay|script]] available to them.&lt;ref&gt;Gentleman, Amelia. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/23/filmnews.russia "Hollywood infuriates Russian veterans."] ''The Guardian'', February 23, 2001. Retrieved: July 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The submarine's captain presented an open letter to the actors and production team, and a group of officers and crew members presented another. In a later script, several scenes were cut, and the names of the crew changed at the request of the crew members and their families.

The most significant difference between the plot and the historical events is the scene that replaces an incident where the captain threw almost all the submarine's small arms overboard out of concern about the possibility of a mutiny; the film instead portrays an actual attempt at mutiny.

The {{sclass2-|Hotel|submarine}} ''[[Soviet submarine K-19|''K-19'']]'' was portrayed in the film by the [[Juliett class submarine|''Juliett''-class]] ''[[Soviet submarine K-77|K-77]]'', which was significantly modified for the role. [[HMCS Ojibwa (S72)|Her Majesty's Canadian Submarine ''Ojibwa'']] portrayed the Soviet {{sclass2-|Whiskey|submarine}} ''S-270''. {{HMCS|Terra Nova|DDE 259|6}} portrayed {{USS|Decatur|DD-936|6}}. The Canadian [[Halifax Shipyard]] stood in for the [[Sevmash]] shipyard of [[Far North (Russia)|northern Russia]].

[[Klaus Badelt]] wrote the film's late-[[Romantic music|Romantic]]-styled [[Film score|score]].

==Reception==
''K-19: The Widowmaker'' received mixed reviews with a total of 60% positive reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. It is summarized as being "A gripping drama even though the filmmakers have taken liberties with the facts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=K-19: The Widowmaker Movie Reviews, Pictures |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/k19_the_widowmaker/ |work=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''K-19: The Widowmaker'' was premiered in [[Russia]] in October 2002, fifty-two veterans of the ''K-19'' submarine accepted flights to the [[Saint Petersburg]] premiere; despite what they saw as technical as well as historical compromises, they praised the film and, in particular, the performance of Harrison Ford.&lt;ref&gt;Titova, Irina."K-19 Film Premieres at Mariinsky Theater." ''The St. Petersburg Times'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review, film critic [[Roger Ebert]] compared ''K-19: The Widowmaker'' to other classic films of the genre, "Movies involving submarines have the logic of chess: The longer the game goes, the fewer the possible remaining moves. 'K-19: The Widowmaker' joins a tradition that includes ''[[Das Boot]]'' and ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' and goes all the way back to ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep (1958 film)|Run Silent, Run Deep]]''. The variables are always oxygen, water pressure and the enemy. Can the men breathe, will the sub implode, will depth charges destroy it?"&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Roger.

The '''Lampsacus Treasure''' or ''Lapseki Treasure'' is the name of an important early [[Byzantine]] silver hoard found near the town of [[Lapseki]] (ancient Lampsacus) in modern-day Turkey.  Most of the hoard is now in the [[British Museum]]'s collection, although a few items can be found in museums in [[Paris]] and [[Istanbul]] too.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=27676&amp;plaA=27676-3-2 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discovery==
The Lampsacus Treasure was accidentally found in 1847 by famers digging in a field near the village of Lapseki (ancient [[Lampsacus]]) in north-west Turkey. Dating to 6th and 7th centuries AD, the hoard of largely silver objects provides a significant catalogue of design and fashion from the early [[Byzantine]] period. Soon after its discovery, the bulk of the treasure came into the possession of [[Henry Richard Charles Wellesley]], Earl of Cowley, who donated it to the [[British Museum]] in 1848. Two other institutions also have objects from the treasure: the [[Istanbul Archaeological Museum]] possess two bowls; the [[Louvre]] a further two spoons.

==Description of the treasure==
The [[hoard]] includes a wide range of [[ecclesiastical]] objects that may have originally belonged to a church or a wealthy individual connected with the church. It includes a silver tripod lamp-stand with five imperial control stamps that date from the reign of [[Justinian I]] (527-65AD). In the British Museum there are also twelve pear-shaped spoons, six of which bear inscriptions and verse in Greek and/or Latin, a (slightly damaged) silver [[chalice]], two silver dishes with [[niello]]ed [[monograms]] in the centre, an ornate silver polycandelon, part of a folding stool, and various jewellery and furniture/vessel fittings.

'''Language exchange''' is a method of [[language learning]] based on mutual language practicing by learning partners who are speakers of different languages. This is usually done by two native speakers teaching each other their native language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahn|first=Tae youn|title=Learner agency and the use of affordances in language-exchange interactions|url=http://www-tandfonline-com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/pdf/10.1080/14708477.2015.1125911|journal=Language and Intercultural Communication|volume=16|issue=2|pages=164–181|doi=10.1080/14708477.2015.1125911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language exchange is different from other Language learning methods as there is usually no set syllabus or activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Language exchange is sometimes called [[Tandem language learning]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Acar, Kobayashi|first=Adam, Hideo|date=2011|title=Whys and How's of Language Exchange Meetings|url=http://callej.org/journal/12-2/Acar_Kobayashi_2011.pdf|journal=PDF|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern contexts, "language exchange" most often refers to the mutual teaching of partners' [[first language]]s.  Language exchanges are generally considered helpful for developing [[language proficiency]], especially in speaking fluency and listening comprehension.  Language exchanges that take place through writing or text chats also improve reading comprehension and writing ability. The aim of language exchange is to develop and increase language knowledge and intercultural skills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is usually done through social interaction with the native speaker.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Given that language exchanges generally take place between native speakers of different languages, there is also the side benefit of improving cross-cultural communication.

==History==
This practice has long been used by individuals to exchange knowledge of foreign languages. For example, [[John Milton]] gave [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] an opportunity to practice [[Hebrew]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], and [[French language|French]], while receiving lessons in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in exchange.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jews of Rhode Island'', by George M. Goodwin, Ellen Smith (2004) {{ISBN|1-58465-424-4}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=J6VleZCF9gkC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=%22language+exchange%22&amp;lr=#PPA132,M1 p. 132]&lt;/ref&gt; Language exchange first came about in the early 1800s where school aged children in England were introduced to the newly set up program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Countries such as Belgium and Switzerland found the language exchange program very easy to run as there were many languages spoken in the one country.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; French and German youth picked up language exchange in 1968 which then spread to Turkey and Madrid.

==In education==
Universities are increasingly experimenting with language exchanges as part of the language learning curriculum.  In this respect, language exchanges have a similar role as [[study abroad]] programs and [[language immersion]] programs in creating an environment where the language student must use the foreign language for genuine communication outside of a classroom setting. Language Travelling has increased significantly over the last three years, with an increase of 67%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hothousemedia.com/ltm/ltmbackissues/dec14web/dec14pdf/#p=29 - Study Travel Magazine Report]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are also concerns that language exchanges cannot be used as a substitute for formal language education, given the difficulty of using language exchanges in learning formal grammar and writing skills.

In addition, various offline organizations exist to facilitate language exchanges, such as [[Tandem language learning]] and [[Unilang]], as well as mobile apps like [[UTandem - Language Exchange App|uTandem]], Bilingua, Hello Pal and Tandem.
 
By using the mobile apps, users from all over the world can connect with new language partners to share connections and passions. 
Some of the apps will connect you based on interests, location or just with a native speaker of the language you are searching for.

Institutional programs
In Europe, the Erasmus programme (established in 1987 by the European Union and incorporated in the Socrates programme in 1994) allows students to do part of their studies in another European institution. The students will be studying for a minimum of three months, up to one year.

In Canada, the Katimavik programme is addressed to young volunteers aged 17 to 21; This program has cultural aims and allows them to practice the second official language in three Canadian provinces.

In Spain, the fields of education and training have increased language tourism by more than 20% between 2007 and 2009.

LAOTSE (Links to Asia by Organizing Traineeship and Student Exchange) is an international network of technical universities from Europe to Asia.&lt;ref&gt;https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Échange_linguistique&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits==
Language exchanges have been viewed as a helpful tool to aid language learning at [[language school]]s.  Language exchanges tend to benefit oral proficiency, fluency, colloquial vocabulary acquisition, and vernacular usage. A major benefit of language exchange is the exposure to the native speaker's culture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yurtopic.com/education/languages/language-exchange.html|title=The Benefits of Language Exchange Partnerships|website=YurTopic|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the culture of native speaker will help with understanding why and how the language is used.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another benefit is that you are in an friendly and informal environment, this means there is no pressure to get everything right as both speakers are trying to learn and understand.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This also gives the learning environment a fun and productive atmosphere. By learning with native speakers each person will get a better understanding of the language as they are learning from someone who has knowledge and background in the language, whereas, learning from someone who has learnt the language later on in their life may not be correct in what they are teaching.
Another benefit is that people are learning faster when they have a one-on-one connection with the "teacher". Many people choose to learn one-on-one but struggle try to find a teacher. People like this are highly motivated to learn a new language. The native speakers whom are helping these people may feel a new sense of motivation since they are now responsible for teaching this person. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Technology==
With the growth of the internet, language exchanges using social networks and [[VoIP|voice-over-IP technologies]] have become  increasingly popular.  Language learning social networks now offer students the ability to find language partners around the world, and speak, text chat or video through [[Instant messaging|instant messengers]].  This has allowed students who previously could not find foreign language partners to search online for native speakers of that language.
Another perk of this technology is that users can verify their texts with native speakers. This way there will be less grammar mistakes and bigger improvements in languages. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lang1234.info/3/category/2practice/1.html | title=Practice with Native Speakers | date=24 April 2013 | accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now over 24 different online language exchange groups that can be joined.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Darkness 'recruits' other resentful shades from the past who also died 'unfairly' as a result of a coming or completed conflict — such as the crew of an experimental submarine whose air-pumps failed, and a [[World War II]] bomber pilot killed in a crash just one flight away from being demobbed. It is up to Sapphire and Steel to decide if the life of one living human is worth the price of the danger presented to Reality.

('''Note:''' This story's transmission was interrupted by the [[History_of_ITV#1979_dispute|1979 ITV technicians strike]], which lasted from 10 August to 24 October 1979. Once the strike was over, instead of resuming transmission with the next episode, the decision was made to transmit the story from the beginning.)

| colspan="5" | Rothwyn and Eldred, a couple living in a modern apartment, are not what they seem. In fact, they are from the 35th Century, the apartment is their time capsule, which is situated on the roof of a modern day tower block, and the experiment is to live as 20th Century humans. But trouble starts when the couple discover that they can neither contact their controllers in the future nor two other similar time capsules in the present day. The biomechanical system that runs the capsule has experiments of its own that it plans to perform on the occupants &amp;ndash; resenting the fact that in the 35th century, Mankind is the only animal not extinct; all other creatures, flora, fauna and even germs having been ruthlessly eradicated in order to preserve the purity of the human race. This time, Sapphire and Steel have help in the form of Silver, an interdimensional technician.

Mullrine has even gone so far as to have every room in the house, with the exception of his office, put back to its original style. Then, strange things start to happen: McDee himself turns up at the party along with other anachronisms, and then, one by one, the guests begin to be murdered &amp;ndash; their bodies vanishing shortly afterwards. Secrets and lies involving McDee from fifty years before are resurfacing, Time is trying to rewrite history, and the only ones who can stop it are two uninvited guests — Sapphire and Steel.

('''Note:''' Many regional editions of ''TVTimes'' wrongly billed this story as a repeat. This was possibly due to confusion caused by the changeover from ATV to Central on 1 January 1982, when an ITV contracts change in 1980 resulted in the Midlands ITV region's franchise going from the first company to the second.)

The '''''Madonna with Child and Saints''''' is a [[painting]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] late [[Renaissance]] painter [[Luca Signorelli]], executed around 1519-1523. It is housed in the [[Museo Nazionale di Castel Sant Angelo]], [[Rome]], Italy.
The picture is a traditional [[Holy Conversation]] composition.

==History==
The painting was commissioned by the Brotherhood of St. Jerome in [[Arezzo]] for their seat. The work was executed in [[Cortona]] and was brought to Arezzo by the painter himself, who was then in his seventies (here, he resided in the Vasari family's house and met the young [[Giorgio Vasari]], his future biographer, who started to practice painting  after Signorelli's suggestion).

It is the last work by Signorelli, who died after returning to Cortona.

It runs for eleven days, incorporating over 100 events across Greater Manchester for families and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sci-eng.mmu.ac.uk/news_and_events/news/news_view.asp?newsid=2181|accessdate=31 March 2016|title=Brains of the Future at Manchester Science Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siemens has been the Festival’s headline sponsor since 2014, as part of its Curiosity Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Siemens to inspire five million young people through the promotion of science and engineering|url=http://www.siemens.co.uk/en/news_press/index/news_archive/2014/siemens-to-inspire-5-million-young-people-through-science-and-engineering.htm|website=Siemens|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

The festival launched at the Museum of Science and Industry in 2007. With over 100,000 visits to the festival in 2015, Manchester Science Festival is England's largest science festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchester Science Festival|url=http://www.manchestersciencefestival.com/getinvolved/share-your-ideas|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Manchester Evening News]] describe the festival as “one of the most fun things to happen to the region in recent years, taking practical science into places you never imagined possible all over the city”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchester festival diary: the events you should be going to and where to buy tickets|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/manchester-festival-diary-events-you-10818588|website=Manchester Evening News|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manchester Science Festival Programme==

Each year, the programme features hands-on activities, immersive experiences, exhibitions, talks and tours. Events reflect the festival ethos of ‘part laboratory, part playground’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchester Science Festival supported by Siemens|url=http://msimanchester.org.uk/en/whats-on/activity/manchester-science-festival|website=Museum of Science and Industry|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aim to bring science to audiences at the Museum and at venues across Greater Manchester.

The programme for Manchester Science Festival is created and produced collaboratively with partners across the North West. Over the years, this has included [[University of Manchester]], [[Manchester Metropolitan University]], [[University of Salford]], [[Chester Zoo]], [[Cancer Research UK]], HackManchester, [[Jodrell Bank Observatory|Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre]], [[Manchester Cathedral]], [[John Rylands Library]] and [[Manchester Central Library]].

The programme encourages audiences to actively participate in science. This includes science busking activities and since 2014 has included the Museum of Science and Industry’s Platform for Investigation (Pi). The Pi is sponsored by Siemens and is part of the museum’s monthly live event programme. Pi gives audiences the opportunity to meet scientists and hear about their research whilst getting involved with experiments and activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Queen Heralds Glorious Future|url=http://group.sciencemuseum.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/annual-review-2014-15.pdf|website=Science Museum Group|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Exhibitions]] are a feature of the festival programme, including contemporary science exhibitions at the Museum of Science and Industry. Since 2014, [[Cape Farewell, UK]] have partnered with the festival to commission an exhibition inspired by [[James Lovelock]]’s [[Gaia Theory]]. Notable exhibitions include Marcus Coates’ ''The Sounds of Others'' and Tania Kovats’ ''Evaporation''.

The eighth Manchester Science Festival showcased [[Marcus Coates]]’ exhibition ''The Sounds of Others'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bears on stairs, Bez stares on: Manchester Science Festival|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2014/oct/23/bears-on-stairs-bez-stares-on-manchester-science-festival|website=The Guardian|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 3D printing exhibition, a debate over the future of fracking with [[Bez (dancer)|Bez]] from [[Happy Mondays]], and the building of a [[Mega Menger]]. The website Creative Tourist wrote about Manchester Science Festival’s programme, saying that, “The delight in such a diversity of diversions is being able to wander according to one’s own fancy; being cartographer to your own map. The book of Manchester is open: choose your own adventure”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchester Science Festival 2014: Mapping the future|url=http://www.creativetourist.com/articles/art/manchester/manchester-science-festival-2014-mapping-the-future/|website=Creative Tourist|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchester Science Festival 2013===

In its seventh year, Manchester Science Festival brought the exhibition ''Brains: the Mind as Matter'' and a supporting events programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brains: The mind as matter|url=https://wellcomecollection.org/exhibitions/brains-mind-matter|website=Wellcome Collection|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched its second citizen science project, Hooked On Music&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=#HookedOnMusic – Manchester Science Festival 2014|url=http://mancunion.com/2014/11/12/hookedonmusic-late-manchester-science-festival-2014/|website=The Mancunion|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and built a giant [[Rube Goldberg Machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leading lights of science put on show for Festival|url=http://www.engagement.manchester.ac.uk/blog/?tag=msf|website=The University of Manchester|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Festival also won the Manchester Tourism Award for Large Tourism Event of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchester Tourism Awards 2013 Winners|url=http://www.manchestertourismawards.com/media/65562/mta%20winners%20piece.pdf|website=Manchester Tourism Awards|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citizen Science Projects==

Manchester Science Festival has been involved with two citizen science projects since 2007. The first was ''Turing’s Sunflowers'' in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greater Manchester sunflowers to test Alan Turing theory|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-17469241|website=BBC|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and #HookedOnMusic, part of the festival programme since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=#Hooked: a citizen science experiment into what makes music memorable|url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/Press-releases/WTP054263.htm|website=Wellcome Trust|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turing's Sunflowers===

The experiment was conceived by Jonathan Swinton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Turing's Sunflowers?|url=http://www.turingsunflowers.com/about/why|website=Museum of Science and Industry|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led by Erinma Ochu at the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Manchester)|Museum of Science and Industry]], who said that “we hope to provide the missing evidence to test Turing's little-known theories about [[Fibonacci numbers]] in [[sunflowers]]. It would be a fitting celebration of the work of Alan Turing”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grow a sunflower to solve unfinished Alan Turing experiment|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/mar/26/alan-turing-sunflowers-manchester-science-festival|website=The Guardian|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizen scientists from seven countries participated, growing over 500 sunflowers, over 450 of which conformed to the Fibonacci sequence, thereby proving Alan Turing’s theory.

===HookedOnMusic===

Launched at the 2013 Manchester Science Festival with Ashley Burgoyne from the [[University of Amsterdam]], audiences were encouraged to play a free, online game that produced results for scientific research. Researchers were looking for the [[Hook (music)|hooks]] in music to help future research on [[Alzheimer’s disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=#Hooked: a citizen science experiment into what makes music memorable|url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/Press-releases/WTP054263.htm|website=Wellcome Trust|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using catchy music, researchers hope to find ways to trigger therapeutic benefits for patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Play game that tests if you're hooked on music - and help research into Alzheimer's disease|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/hooked-music-mosi-alzheimers-play-7244307|website=Manchester Evening News|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Results presented at the 2014 Manchester Science Festival revealed the UK’s top ten catchiest tunes, looking at just how memorable parts of songs can be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spice Girls' Wannabe 'is catchiest hit single'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-29847739|website=BBC|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number one catchiest song was the [[Spice Girls]]’ '[[Wannabe (song)|Wannabe]]'.

==Sponsorship==

Since 2014, [[Siemens]] has been the headline sponsor for the festival. Other major sponsors include the [[University of Salford]], [[Electricity North West]] and the [[Waters Corporation]].

The '''McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology''' started in 1963 as the '''Centre for Culture and Technology''', initially a card pinned to the door of [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s office in the English Department at the [[University of Toronto]]. It then had no organized program for research or teaching, but gained in prestige from the worldwide popularity of ''Understanding Media'' (1964) and grew in McLuhan's last decade in Toronto, assisted by [[Derrick de Kerckhove]] and McLuhan's son Eric, who became a director of the McLuhan Program International.&lt;ref&gt;http://projects.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/eric.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the McLuhan Program became a part of the [[University of Toronto]]'s [[University of Toronto Faculty of Information|Faculty of Information]]. The program's curriculum is based on the works of [[Marshall McLuhan]] and other media theorists. In 2009, the Faculty of Information launched the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Information#Coach House Institute|Coach House Institute]] (CHI) as a clearly defined research unit under which the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology now operates. In 2016 under Interim Director, Prof Seamus Ross, the Institute receive approval for its renaming as the McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology in recognition of [[Marshall McLuhan]] intellectual contributions.  The McLuhan Program is now subsumed under this Centre.

Sarah Sharma, an Associate Professor of Media Theory from the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology (ICCIT) and the Faculty of Information (St. George), began a five year term as director. Professor Sharma's research and teaching focuses on feminist approaches to technology, including issues related to temporality and media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chi.utoronto.ca/prof-sarah-sharma-appointed-director-mcluhan-centre/|title=Prof. Sarah Sharma Appointed Director of McLuhan Centre - McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|date=2016-12-13|work=McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Sharma's thematic for the 2017-2018 Monday Night Seminars at the McLuhan Centre is MsUnderstanding Media which extends and introduces feminist approaches to technology to McLuhan's formulations of technology and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chi.utoronto.ca/msunderstanding-media-2/|title=Monday Night Seminars - McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|last=University of Toronto|first=|date=2017-07-19|work=McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|access-date=2017-11-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Melody type''' or '''type-melody'''&lt;ref&gt;David Hiley. ''Western Plainchant. A Handbook''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993, pp.&amp;nbsp;331–33.&lt;/ref&gt; is a set of [[melody|melodic]] formulas, [[figure (music)|figures]], and [[melodic pattern|patterns]].

== Term and typical meanings ==
"Melody type" is a fundamental notion for understanding a nature of Western and non-Western musical [[Mode (music)|modes]], according to [[Harold Powers|Harold Powers']] seminal article "Mode" in the first edition of the ''[[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' {{harv|Powers|1980|loc=12:376–77, 379, et passim}}.

Melody types are used in the [[musical composition|composition]] of an enormous variety of [[music]], especially [[music of Asia|non-Western]] and [[early music|early Western music]]. Such music is generally composed by a process of [[centonization]], either freely (i.e. improvised) or in a fixed pattern.

"Melody type" as used by the ethmnomusicologist [[Mark Slobin|Mark]] {{harvtxt|Slobin|1982|loc=186}}&lt;ref&gt;Slobin, Mark (1982). ''Tenement Songs: The Popular Music of the Jewish Immigrants''. Music in American Life. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. {{ISBN|0-252-00893-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as a "group of melodies that are related, in that they all contain similar modal procedures and characteristic [[rhythm]]ic and melodic contours or patterns".&lt;ref&gt;Koskoff, Ellen (2000). ''Music in Lubavitcher Life'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press), p.&amp;nbsp;86. {{ISBN|978-0-252-02591-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most cultures which compose music in this way organize the patterns into distinct melody types. These are often compared to modern Western [[musical scale|scale]]s, but they in fact represent much more information than a sequence of permissible [[pitch (music)|pitches]], since they include how those pitches should function in the music, and indicate basic formulas which serve as a basis for [[improvisation]]. In non-improvised music, such as codified liturgical music, it is still usually clear how the melody developed from set patterns.

{{quote|On one end of the continuum, the right, the melody type is a schema that is quite definite—a specific melody or a tune. When a musician improvises on this schema, he [or she] plays the melody with only slight variations. The basic outline is preserved and is clearly recognized by the listener. The best example&amp;nbsp;... on this end of the continuum is a folk song. A genuine folk song performance is a kind of improvisation. No one person sings it exactly as it came to him [or her]. One of the challenges of folk song research, of course, is to find all the variants of the tune and to try to trace the family relationships.&lt;br/&gt; On the left side of the continuum is the melody type as a [[musical mode|mode]]. Here the melody type is similar to a [[Gregorian mode|church mode]]: a scalar configuration with a preferential order of tones.&lt;br/&gt; ...The closer we get to the pole where a melody type is a tune, the more definite and literal is the schema.|May (1983)&lt;ref&gt;May, Elizabeth (1983). ''Musics of Many Cultures: An Introduction, Part 1'', p.&amp;nbsp;274. {{ISBN|978-0-520-04778-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|A melodic formula, ranging length from a short motif of a few notes to an entire melody, which is used as the basis for musical compositions. It differs from a mode, which simply sets forth a sequence of [[interval (music)|intervals]] (in Western music, half tones and whole tones), and from a scale (the notes of a mode in rising order of pitch), in that it is more specific: a melody type spells out actual sequences of tones, just as they are to appear in a piece, as well as particular beginnings and endings, [[ornament (music)|ornaments]], and other details. Melody types are found mostly in the music of ancient peoples—the Greeks, Hebrews, and others—and of Eastern peoples—the Arabs, Persians (Iranians), Indians, and others. For...example...[[raga]].|Ammer (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Ammer, Christine (2004). "Melody type", ''The Facts on File Dictionary of Music'', p.&amp;nbsp;238. {{ISBN|978-0-8160-5266-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pseudo-liturgical verses with initial numerals (''primum..., secundum..., tertia...'' etc.) helped singers to associate a current model with a 'real' chant (such as antiphon) of the same tone. These type-melodies were probably conceived as didactic, to adjust ear for typical melodic formulae, reciting tones, finals etc. They should not be confused with psalm tones, which represent an exact scheme for modulating psalms and canticles.&lt;ref&gt;David Hiley, ''Western Plainchant: A Handbook'' (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1993): pp.&amp;nbsp;58-69 and pp.&amp;nbsp;331-335; this handbook is itself a summary of specialized studies of intonation formulas by Michel Huglo, Terence Bailey, [[Bruno Stäblein]], and many others referred to at pp.&amp;nbsp;58 and 325 et passim.

==Extra-musical implications==
In most cases, these melody types are associated with extra-musical implications, particularly [[emotion]]s (see Indian [[rasa (art)|rasa]], for instance). They are also often associated with certain times. For example, most [[raga]]s are associated with a certain time of day, or a [[wayang]] performance in Java implies a certain succession of [[pathet]]s.

[[Image:Ac marbles.jpg|thumb|Metope from the Parthenon marbles depicting part of the battle between the Centaurs and the Lapiths.]]

In [[classical architecture]], a '''metope''' (μετόπη) is a rectangular architectural element that fills the space between two [[triglyph]]s in a [[Doric order|Doric]] [[frieze]], which is a decorative band of alternating triglyphs and metopes above the [[architrave]] of a building of the Doric order.  Metopes often had painted or sculptural decoration; the most famous example are the 92 metopes of the [[Parthenon marbles]] some of which depict the battle between the [[Centaur]]s and the [[Lapiths]].  The painting on most metopes has been lost, but sufficient traces remain to allow a close idea of their original appearance.  

In terms of structure, metopes may be carved from a single block with a triglyph (or triglyphs), or they may be cut separately and slide into slots in the triglyph blocks as at the [[Temple of Aphaea]].  Sometimes the metopes and friezes were cut from different stone, so as to provide color contrast.  Although they tend to be close to square in shape, some metopes are noticeably larger in height or in width.  They may also vary in width within a single structure to allow for corner contraction, an adjustment of the column spacing and arrangement of the Doric frieze in a temple to make the design appear more harmonious.

'''''National Lampoon's Doon''''' is a [[parody]] of [[Frank Herbert]]'s 1965 [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', written by [[Ellis Weiner]] and published in 1984 by [[Pocket Books]] for ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]''. It was reprinted by [[Grafton Books]] ({{ISBN|0-586-06636-5}}) in 1985. In 1988 William F. Touponce called the book "something of a tribute to Herbert's success on college campuses", noting that "the only other book to have been so honored is [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s ''[[Lord of the Rings]]''," which [[Bored of the Rings|was parodied]] by ''[[The Harvard Lampoon]]'' in 1969.&lt;ref name="Touponce 119"&gt;{{cite book|last=Touponce|first=William F.|year=1988|title=Frank Herbert|chapter=Herbert's Reputation|location=[[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]|publisher=Twayne Publishers imprint, G. K. Hall &amp; Co|page=119|isbn=0-8057-7514-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dune'' is set on the dangerous, [[sandworm (Dune)|sandworm]]-ridden [[desert planet]] [[Arrakis]], sole source of the [[melange (fictional drug)|spice melange]], the most valuable substance in the universe. The parody follows a similar storyline, wherein rival restaurant-owning families battle for control of Arruckus, which is overrun by giant pretzels and the source of valuable [[beer]].

== Plot ==

Within the Galactic Empire, a change of fief is occurring. Led by the verbose Baron Vladimir, House Hardchargin, the Great Big House given charge of Arruckus, has been displaced by Shaddap IV, the Padedbrah Emperor, in favor of the up-and-coming House Agamemnides, with Duke Lotto at its head.

Arruckus is also known as "Doon", and is additionally known as the Dessert Planet. Covered entirely in sugars, it is a harsh unforgiving environment, where not an entree can be found; the natives live entirely on whatever they can import, produce from the sugars, or produce from soy protein (the native food experiments known as the ''Mahn t'Vani'')

Duke Lotto accepts the fief, aware that it may well be a death trap but also conscious of the importance of Arruckus's only export, the wide-spectrum intoxicant known as [[beer]]. Found naturally on Arruckus as a result of natural processes and nowhere else, it is the engine on which commerce runs; the Schlepping Guild, who has a monopoly on space travel in the Imperium, will not run without it. Who controls the beer controls commerce.

But soon after arriving on Doon, with his heir and son Pall and his concubine the Lady Jazzica, an adept of the galaxy-spanning sisterhood of chefs and event planners known as the Boni Maroni, Duke Lotto and House Agamemnides fall victim to a scheme originated by Baron Vladimir Hardchargin and implemented by the Duke's own accountant Oyeah, who, without the Duke's knowledge, kept a secret second ledger. When the Emperor called for an audit of the fief, the duplicate ledger made it appear as though House Agamemnides had been [[Creative accounting|cooking the books]]. In return for this act, Oyeah hoped the Baron would give him a start as a stand-up comic–which he did, but on the Imperial prison planet, Salacia Simplicissimus. Ruined, Duke Lotto's brief reign over Doon is ended and House Hardchargin is reinstated as fief-holders.

Banished to the sugared wilderness, Pall (now head of House Agamemnides) and Lady Jazzica meet with and are eventually accepted by the planet's native population, the Freedmenmen, a process made easier by previous prophecy-seeding by the Missionaria Phonibalonica, via the Great Prophet Phyllis. The natives are receptive to the fulfillment of the prophecies even after the revelation that Phyllis's decanonization resulted in her prophecies being discredited. Pall, given the Freedmenmen name Assol and taking the secret name Mauve'Bib (after the purple napkin that all Freedmenmen wear about their necks), begins to ascend the power structure of the tribe and takes the Freedmenmen girl Loni as his lover. He realizes that he could use the Freedmenmen to return to a position of power, taking control of not only Doon but the Imperium itself. He also realizes what the planet's Imperial Planetologist and liberal economist, Keynes, had puzzled out some time before: the rampaging Giant Pretzels (known as Schmai-gunug) actually produces the beer as a byproduct of its very life-cycle. The Lady Jazzica ascends to the status of Revved-Up Mother of Hootch Grabr, becoming known as Jazzica-of-the-Weirdness. During her ascension, while getting drunk on the beer, she realizes that she carries Lotto's daughter. Her intoxication opens her foetal daughter to the thousands of years of Boni Maroni culinary history; the result is Nailya-the-Truly-Weird, a toddler who spouts recipes as though she were an adult.

Pall positions himself as the Kumquat Haagendasz (the result of a generations-long breeding program so secret that the Boni Maroni have actually forgotten the point) and the Mahdl-t, the long hoped-for Freedmenmen messiah, "he who will drive us to Paradise and Back", who will finally bring the entrees the Freedmenmen have hungered for. By this route, he assumes and consolidates his power over the natives, not only making them his allies, but his fanatic followers.

Meanwhile, Baron Vladimir Hardchargin has his own problems. Converting the fief into the Shadvlad Rendezvous, the galaxy's premier lounge planet, is a relative success, even though the Freedmenmen remain a chronic problem and the Giant Pretzels remain at large. He is hungry for more success, and has plans to muscle out his silent partner (the Emperor) and play the Imperial House against the Boni Moroni, the Schlepping Guild, and the interstellar development cooperative NOAMCHOMSKI using his control of beer as leverage, thereby becoming the true power in the galaxy, and franchising the Shadvlad across the Imperium.

Events come to a head when Pall, gone completely native and acquiring the "Eye of the Egad" (the telltale red-on-red eyes, indicating severe beer addiction) challenges the Baron to a bake-off, with a new ingredient: peanut butter, rendered from the naturally occurring snack mix's peanuts, and debuting his secret weapon – a [[liqueur]] made from beer – Drambrewski. With the support of the Boni Moroni, the promise of an assured supply of beer to the Schlepping Guild (who had been influenced to believe that the Hardchargins have been watering the beer, and are revealed to have the red-on-red eyes of beer addiction), and after dispatching the ShaNaNa-Baron Flip-Rotha Hardchargin in rankout (single insult-combat), Pall assumes Imperial control, banishing the Emperor's house to the prison plant Simplicissima Secundus, acquiring the hand of the Emperor's daughter Serutan in a marriage of convenience, and the Freedmenmen woman Loni as his concubine.

== Comedic style ==
{{Original research|date=January 2009}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}
The story uses a style typical to many parodies and spoofs of the genre, most notably ''[[Bored of the Rings]]'', encompassing not only high and sometimes abstruse humor but middle and low as well, through punning references and plays on words designed to either make light of the original characters' names or referencing pop-culture touchpoints.

For example, the galactic development combine [[CHOAM]] in the original ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' story becomes [[Noam Chomsky|NOAMCHOMSKI]], an acronym which expands to the name ''Neutralis Organizational Abba Mercantile Condominium Havatampa Orthonovum Minnehaha Shostakovich Kategorial Imperative'' – a name whose style mocks that of the equally-impenetrable ''Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles'' – and is mentioned and expanded on by some characters to the point of compulsion. The [[Bene Gesserit]] [[litany against fear]] becomes the litany against fun: ''I must not have fun. Fun is the time-killer.''

Another example is the repeated use of the name Jonzun Fillup, the acclaimed architect from whose designs the Baron Hardchargin cribs liberally to create the Shadvlad. This is a reference to [[Philip Johnson]], the influential 20th Century American architect whose controversial postmodern design for the then-AT&amp;T Building (latterly, the [[Sony Building (New York)|Sony Building]] in New York) included a top reminiscent of a Chippendale bookcase. This too is transferred to the story, as Baron Hardchargin lavishly praises Fillup's Gothic entablature at the north pole of the Antares Teleport and Telepath's headquarters planet.

Other references, such as the word Mahn-t'vani (a play on the easy-listening music composer [[Mantovani]]) and the name [[Serutan]] (with reference to its famous "Natures spelled backwards" tagline) may seem a bit dated, but there are references to such things as the hokey-pokey and [[Tito Puente]] which still hold currency in modern culture{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2015}}.

Overall, the arc of the story is respected and held closely to throughout. In the style of the original, quotes from the Princess Serutan's works (amongst them, ''The Portable Mauve'Bib'', ''In My Father's House, In His Room, And Especially Rummaging Through His Junk Drawer'', and ''No More Princess Nice Guy: The Princess Serutan Diaries'') lead off each chapter. ''Dune'' was a story about spice power; Doon is a story about beer power. Most notable is the successful transition of Herbert's style into comedy, as can be referenced by Pall Agamemnides as he surveys his situation prior to the relocation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This realization focused within him in a sudden sparkflash computation, and in the clear brilliance of that illumination, the boy Pall understood a profoundness. His life, hitherto a child's plaything, devoid of direction–seemingly! Or had there in fact always been a plan–a plan within a plan within a plan (whatever that meant (whatever that meant (whatever that meant)))?–was now encompassed by a terrible purpose. He knew the meaning of the word terrible, and he knew the meaning of the word purpose. And therefore he understood deeply the meaning of "terrible purpose". Unless he, in the solitude of his deeply brain-filled mind, misunderstood this revelation, and was in fact confronted with a "terrible papoose."

What could that mean?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The native population of Doon, the Freedmenmen, are characterized as intense, somewhat overweight beer addicts, steeped in tradition, mysticism, and ritual, with a language of their own–"Varietese", a direct play on the signature style of [[headlinese]] of the entertainment-industry newspaper ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' (the magazine's famous headline, [[Sticks Nix Hick Pix]], is rendered as an expression of resignation, along the lines of "What can one do?"). The [[stillsuit]] of the original story becomes the Freedmenmen sweatsuit, meant to induce sweating to reduce the accumulation of excess body weight brought on by constant beer consumption. The [[sandworm (Dune)|sandworms]] (also known as Maker and Shai-Hulud in the original) become giant pretzels, also known by the natives as Brewer and Schmai-gunug, a term the glossary claims is rendered from a Yiddish phrase meaning "to browse and fiddle around and window-shop enough".

An advertisement in the back of the book promised conceptual sequels, including ''Doon Meshugganah; Men, Women, Children, Pets of Doon; Lord God Help Us, Another Sequel to Doon; The Doon Reference Book, Atlas, and Rhyming Dictionary;'' and ''The Doon Catalogue of Quality Menswear for Dad 'n' Lad.''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2807">'''Neo-minimalism''' is an amorphous art movement of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. It has alternatively been called "neo-geometric" or "neo-geo" art.  Other terms include: [[Neo-conceptual art|Neo-Conceptualism]], [[Neo-Futurism]], Neo-Op, Neo-Pop, New Abstraction, Poptometry, Post-Abstractionism, Simulationism, and Smart Art.&lt;ref&gt;John Albert Walker, ''Glossary of Art, Architecture, and Design Since 1945'', Third edition, New York, G. K. Hall, 1992; p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
The aspects of "postmodern art" that have been described as neo-minimalism (and related terms) involve a general "reevaluation of earlier art forms."&lt;ref&gt;Fred S. Kleiner and Christin J. Mamiya, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective'', Twelfth edition, Thomson / Wadsworth, 2005; Vol. 2, p. 844.&lt;/ref&gt;  As its various titles indicate, the movement draws on earlier mid-to-late-20th century developments in [[Minimalist art]], [[Abstract Expressionism]] and its [[Post-painterly Abstraction|offshoots]], plus [[Pop Art]], [[Op Art]], and other threads of artistic development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museumstuff.com/learn/topics/Neo-minimalism&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary artists who have been linked to the term, or who have been included in shows employing it, include [[Peter Halley]], [[Philip Taaffe]], [[Lorenzo Belenguer]], [[Ashley Bickerton]], David Burdeny, Paul Kuhn, Eve Leader, [[Peter Schuyff]], [[Christopher Willard]] and [[Tim Zuck]]. The steel sculptures of [[Richard Serra]] have been described as "austere neo-Minimalism...."&lt;ref&gt;Casey Nelson Blake, "An Atmosphere of Effrontery," in: ''The Power of Culture: Critical Essays in American History'', Richard Wightman Fox and [[T. J. Jackson Lears]], eds., Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1993; p. 259 n. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and music==
Beyond painting, sculpture and other "museum art," the term has been applied to architecture, design, and music.&lt;ref&gt;''Cadence: The American Review of Jazz and Blues'', Vol. 14 (1988), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In architecture, indeed, neo-minimalism has been identified as a part of "the new orthodoxy...."&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Hodge, ed., ''Not Architecture But Evidence That It Exists'', Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press, 1999; p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

"After the bacchanal of [[Postmodernism|post-modernism]], the time has again come for neo-minimalism, neo-ascetism, neo-denial and sublime poverty."&lt;ref&gt;Juhani Pallasmaa, ''Architecture in Miniature'', Museum of Finnish Architecture, 1991; p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

|title=Xerox PARC turns 40: Marking four decades of tech innovations
|quote=spun off by Xerox in January 2002 |date=September 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1969, Jack Goldman, Xerox's Chief Scientist, spoke to [[George Pake]], a [[physicist]] specializing in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] and [[Provost (education)|provost]] of [[Washington University in St. Louis]], about starting a second research center for the company.

Pake selected Palo Alto, California, as the site of what was to become known as PARC. While the 3,000 mile buffer between it and Xerox headquarters in [[Rochester, New York]] afforded scientists at the new lab great freedom to undertake their work, the distance also served as an impediment in persuading management of the promise of some of their greatest achievements.

PARC's West Coast location proved to be advantageous in the mid-1970s, when the lab was able to hire many employees of the nearby [[SRI International|SRI]] [[Augmentation Research Center]] (ARC) as that facility's funding began falling, from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]), National Aeronautics and Space Administration ([[NASA]]) and [[U.S. Air Force]] (USAF). Being situated on [[Stanford Research Park]] land leased from [[Stanford University]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://lbre.stanford.edu/realestate/map Map of Stanford Research Park] on Stanford University Real Estate web site&lt;/ref&gt;allowed Stanford graduate students to be involved in PARC research projects and PARC scientists to collaborate with academic seminars and projects.

Much of PARC's early success in the computer field was under the leadership of its Computer Science Laboratory manager [[Robert Taylor (computer scientist)|Bob Taylor]], who guided the lab as associate manager from 1970 to 1977 and as manager from 1977 to 1983.

==Today==
After three decades as a division of Xerox, PARC was transformed in 2002&lt;ref name=X2002/&gt; into an independent, wholly owned subsidiary company dedicated to developing and maturing advances in science and business concepts with the support of commercial partners and clients.

Xerox remains the company's largest customer (50%), but PARC has many other corporate and venture clients in different fields of use than Xerox including: [[VMware]], [[Fujitsu]], [[Dai Nippon Printing]] (DNP), [[Samsung]], [[NEC]], SolFocus, [[Powerset (company)|Powerset]], [[Thin Film Electronics ASA]] and many more.

PARC currently conducts research into [[clean technology]], [[metamaterial]]s, [[user interface]] design, [[Sensemaking (information science)|sensemaking]], [[ubiquitous computing]] and context-aware systems, large-area electronics, digital manufacturing, and model-based control and optimization in embedded, intelligent systems.

==Accomplishments==
Xerox PARC has been the inventor and incubator of many elements of modern computing in the contemporary office work place:

*[[Laser printer]]s
*Computer-generated [[bitmap]] graphics
*The [[graphical user interface]], featuring windows and icons, operated with a [[computer mouse|mouse]]
*The [[WYSIWYG]] text editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/tech-history/silicon-revolution/the-xerox-alto-struts-its-stuff-on-its-40th-birthday
  |title=The Xerox Alto Struts Its Stuff on Its 40th Birthday 
  |website=[[IEEE]].org (IEEE Spectrum)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Interpress]], a resolution-independent graphical page-description language and the precursor to [[PostScript]]
*[[Ethernet]] as a local-area computer network&lt;ref name=EncycB/&gt;
*Fully formed [[object-oriented programming]] (with [[Class-based programming|class-based]] inheritance, the most popular OOP model to this day) in the [[Smalltalk]] [[programming language]] and integrated development environment
*[[Prototype-based programming]] (the second most popular inheritance model in OOP) in the [[Self (programming language)|Self]] programming language
*[[Model–view–controller]] software architecture
*[[AspectJ]] an aspect-oriented programming (AOP) extension for the Java programming language

===The Alto===
{{Main|Xerox Alto}}
[[File:Xerox Alto mit Rechner.JPG|thumb|Xerox Alto]]
Most of these developments were included in the Alto, which added the now familiar [[Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI) developed [[Computer mouse|mouse]],&lt;ref name="fn_1"&gt;Xerox PARC was the first research group to widely adopt the mouse invented by [[Douglas Engelbart]]'s [[Augmentation Research Center]] at the [[Stanford Research Institute]] (now [[SRI International]]) in [[Menlo Park, California]].&lt;/ref&gt; unifying into a single model most aspects of now-standard personal computer use. The integration of Ethernet&lt;ref name=EncycB/&gt; prompted the development of the [[PARC Universal Packet]] architecture, much like today's Internet.

===The GUI===
Xerox has been heavily criticized (particularly by business historians) for failing to properly commercialize and profitably exploit PARC's innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |author1=Douglas K. Smith  |author2=Robert C. Alexander 
  |title=Fumbling the Future: How Xerox Invented, then Ignored, the First Personal Computer
  |date=1988|publisher=William Morrow &amp; Co|isbn=978-0688069599}}&lt;/ref&gt; A favorite example is the [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), initially developed at PARC for the Alto and then commercialized as the [[Xerox Star]] by the Xerox Systems Development Department. Although very significant in terms of its influence on future system design, it is deemed a failure because it only sold approximately 25,000 units. A small group from PARC led by [[David Liddle]] and [[Charles Irby]] formed [[Metaphor Computer Systems]]. They extended the Star desktop concept into an animated graphic and communicating office-automation model and sold the company to [[IBM]].

==Distinguished researchers==
{{Main|List of people associated with PARC}}
Among PARC's distinguished researchers were three [[Turing Award]] winners: [[Butler W. Lampson]] (1992), [[Alan Kay]] (2003), and [[Charles P. Thacker]] (2009). The [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) Software System Award recognized the Alto system in 1984, [[Smalltalk]] in 1987, [[InterLisp]] in 1992, and the [[remote procedure call]] in 1994. Lampson, Kay, Bob Taylor, and Charles P. Thacker received the [[National Academy of Engineering]]'s prestigious [[Charles Stark Draper Prize]] in 2004 for their work on the Alto.

==Legacy==
PARC's developments in information technology served for a long time as standards for much of the computing industry. Many advances were not equalled or surpassed for two decades,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} enormous timespans in the fast-paced high-tech world.

While there is some truth that Xerox management failed to see the potential of many of PARC's inventions, this was mostly a problem with its computing research, a relatively small part of PARC's operations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12083">'''Participatory media''' is media where the audience can play an active role in the process of collecting, reporting, analyzing and disseminating content.&lt;ref name="wemedia"&gt;Bowman, S., Willis, C. "[http://www.hypergene.net/wemedia/weblog.php We Media: How Audiences are Shaping the Future of News and Information.]" 2003: The Media Center at the American Press Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Citizen journalism|Citizen / Participatory journalism]], [[citizen media]] and [[democratic media]] are related principles.

Participatory media includes [[community media]], [[blogs]], [[wiki]]s, [[RSS (file format)|RSS]], [[tag (metadata)|tagging]] and [[social bookmarking]], music-photo-video sharing, [[Mashup (music)|mashups]], [[podcast]]s, [[participatory video]] projects and [[videoblogs]]. All together they can be described as "e-services, which involve end-users as active participants in the value creation process".&lt;ref&gt;http://eipcm.org/research.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, "active [...] uses of media are not exclusive to our times".&lt;ref name="history_pm"&gt;Ekström, A., Jülich, S., Lundgren, F., Wisselgren, P. "History of Participatory Media". 2011: Taylor &amp; Francis Group.&lt;/ref&gt; "In the history of mediated communication we can find many variations of participatory practices. For instance, the initial phase of the [[radio]] knew many examples of non-professional broadcasters".&lt;ref name="Carpentier"&gt;Carpentier, Nico. "Participation Is Not Enough: The Conditions of Possibility of Mediated Participatory Practices" 2009: European Journal of Communication 2009 24: 407-419.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marshall MacLuhan]] discussed the participatory potential of media already in the 1970s but in the era of digital and [[social media]], the theory of [[participatory culture]] becomes even more acute as the borders between audiences and media producers are blurring.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;Jenkins, Henry. "Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide" 2006: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
These distinctly different media share three common, interrelated characteristics:&lt;ref name="Rheingold"&gt;{{cite web|last= Rheingold |first= Howard|title=Using Participatory Media and Public Voice to Encourage Civic Engagement|publisher=Thesis, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]|location=2007|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/dmal.9780262524827.097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Many-to-many]] [[Media (communication)|media]] now make it possible for every person connected to the network to broadcast and receive [[Written language|text]], [[image]]s, [[sound|audio]], [[video]], [[software]], [[data]], [[discussion]]s, [[Transaction processing|transactions]], [[computation]]s, [[tag (metadata)|tags]], or [[hyperlink|links]] to and from every other person. The asymmetry between broadcaster and audience that was dictated by the structure of pre-digital technologies dictated has changed radically. This is a technical-structural characteristic.
* Participatory media are [[social media]] whose value and power derives from the active participation of [[Internet meme|many people]]. This is a psychological and social characteristic. One example is [[StumbleUpon]].
* [[Social network]]s, when amplified by information and [[communication networks]], enable broader, faster, and lower cost coordination of activities. This is an economic and political characteristic.

Full-fledged participatory news sites include [[NowPublic]], [[OhmyNews]], DigitalJournal.com, [[On the Ground News Reports]] and [[GroundReport]].

With participatory media, the boundaries between audiences and creators become blurred and often invisible. In the words of [[David Sifry]], the founder of [[Technorati]], a search engine for blogs, one-to-many "lectures" (i.e., from media companies to their audiences) are transformed into "conversations" among "the people formerly known as the audience". This changes the tone of public discussions. The mainstream media, says [[David Weinberger]], a blogger, author and fellow at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]], "don't get how subversive it is to take institutions and turn them into conversations". That is because institutions are closed, assume a hierarchy and have trouble admitting fallibility, he says, whereas conversations are open-ended, assume equality and eagerly concede fallibility.&lt;ref name="Kluth"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kluth|first=Andreas|title=Among the Audience|publisher=[[Economist]]|location=2006|url=http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6794156|date=20 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proposed that journalism can be more "[[participatory]]" because the [[World Wide Web]] has evolved from "read-only" to "[[read/write culture|read-write]]". In other words, in the past only a small proportion of people had the means (in terms of time, money, and skills) to create content that could reach large audiences. Now the gap between the resources and skills needed to consume online content versus the means necessary to produce it have narrowed significantly to the point that nearly anyone with a web-connected device can create media.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon"&gt;{{cite web|last=MacKinnon|first=Rebecca|title=Blogging, Journalism and Credibility: The Future of Global Participatory Media|publisher=Seikai Shisosya|location=2007|url=http://rconversation.blogs.com/MacKinnon_blogging_and_journalism_2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Dan Gillmor]], founder of the Center for Citizen Media declared in his 2004 book [[We the Media]], journalism is evolving from a lecture into a conversation.&lt;ref name="Gilmor"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilmor|first=Dan|title=We the Media|publisher=[[O’Reilly]]|location=2004|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also points out that new interactive forms of media have blurred the distinction between producers of news and their audience. In fact, some view the term "audience" to be obsolete in the new world of interactive participatory media. New York University professor and blogger [[Jay Rosen]] refers to them as "the people formerly known as the audience."&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Jay|title=Top Ten Ideas of '04: News Turns from a Lecture to a Conversation|publisher=Pressthink|location=2006|url=http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2006/06/27/ppl_frmr.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906032526/http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2006/06/27/ppl_frmr.html|archivedate=2010-09-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "We Media", a treatise on participatory journalism, Shayne Bowman and Chris Willis suggest that the "audience" should be renamed "participants".&lt;ref name="wemedia"/&gt; One of the first projects encompassing participatory media prior to the advent of social media was The [[September 11 Photo Project]]. The exhibit was a not-for-profit community based photo project in response to the [[September 11 attacks]] and their aftermath. It provided a venue for the display of photographs accompanied by captions by anyone who wished to participate. The Project aimed to preserve a record of the spontaneous outdoor shrines that were being swept away by rain or wind or collected by the city for historical preservation.

Some even proposed that "all mass media should be abandoned", extending upon one of the four main arguments given by [[Jerry Mander]] in his case against television: Corporate domination of television used to mould humans for a commercial environment, and all mass media involve centralized power. Blogger Robin Good wrote, "With participatory media instead of mass media, governments and corporations would be far less able to control information and maintain their legitimacy... To bring about true participatory media (and society), it is also necessary to bring about participatory alternatives to present economic and political structures... In order for withdrawal from using the mass media to become more popular, participatory media must become more attractive: cheaper, more accessible, more fun, more relevant. In such an atmosphere, nonviolent action campaigns against the mass media and in support of participatory media become more feasible."&lt;ref name="Good"&gt;{{cite web|last=Good |first=Robin|title=The Power Of Open Participatory Media And Why Mass Media Must Be Abandoned|publisher=blog|location=2003|url=http://www.masternewmedia.org/news/2006/03/20/the_power_of_open_participatory.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although 'participatory media' has been viewed uncritically by many writers, others, such as [[Daniel Palmer (writer)|Daniel Palmer]], have argued that media participation must also "be understood in relation to defining characteristics of contemporary capitalism – namely its user-focused, customised and individuated orientation."&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Palmer|first=Daniel|title=Participatory Media: Visual Culture in Real Time|publisher=University of Melbourne|location=2004|url=http://dtl.unimelb.edu.au/R/V3S399QAFCVRQXAL239Q87YCD42LF7U2C51Q6FQB3XGDCXA3YR-01304?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=65808&amp;local_base=GEN01&amp;pds_handle=GUEST}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
* The phrase '''Participatory Media''' was first used publicly by [http://deoxy.org/seize_it.htm Greg Ruggiero] and later popularized by blog researcher [http://www.rebeccablood.net/talks/waging_peace.html#content Rebecca Blood] and others, such as [[Furukawa Group|Furukawa]]. In April 2006, journalist and media researcher [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611092957/http://getmydrift.typepad.com/pfel/2006/04/my_blogging_and.html Jim McClellan] used the phrase '''Personal Participatory Media''', which may distinguish between objective social media (scientific, corporate, pure information) and subjective/personal social media (value-laden, opinion, religious).

{{Hazara people}}
The '''persecution of Hazara people''' refers to the discrimination of the [[Hazaras]], who are primarily from the central highland region of [[Hazarajat]] in [[Afghanistan]]. Significant populations of the Hazara people are also found in [[Quetta]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Mashad]], [[Iran]] as part of the [[Hazara diaspora|Hazara]] and [[Afghan diaspora]]s. The [[persecution]] of Hazara people dates back to the 16th century, with [[Babur]] from [[Kabulistan]].&lt;ref name="Leyden"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian//pf?file=03501051&amp;ct=92 |title=Events Of The Year 910 (1525) |page=5 |editor=John Leyden |editor2=William Erskine |work=[[Baburnama|Memoirs of Babur]] |publisher=[[Packard Humanities Institute]] |year=1921 |authorlink=Babur |accessdate=2012-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114042010/http://persian.packhum.org/persian//pf?file=03501051&amp;ct=92# |archive-date=November 14, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massacre and displacement of Hazaras in 1888 to 93|It is reported that]] during the reign of [[Abdur Rahman Khan|Emir Abdur Rahman]] (1880–1901), thousands of Hazaras were killed, expelled and enslaved.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hazara-2|title=HAZĀRA ii.

The Hazara people have also been the victims of massacres committed by the [[Taliban]] and [[al-Qaeda]]. {{as of|2014|df=US}}, conditions have not improved for the Hazaras in Afghanistan and thousands continue to be persecuted in neighboring Pakistan by [[Sunni]] extremist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thacker|first1=Purvi|title=Pakistan's Hazara: 'It's like living in jail'|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/humanrights/2014/12/pakistan-hazara-it-like-living-jail-2014123114655754509.html|accessdate=27 October 2017|work=Al Jazeera|date=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Afghanistan==
{{see also|1888-1893 Uprisings of Hazaras|Kuchi–Hazara conflict}}
Hazaras are historically the most restrained ethnic minority group in the state and have witnessed slight improvements in the circumstances even with the setup of modern Afghanistan. The discrimination against this ethnic group has continued for centuries, instigated by Pashtuns and other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/geopedia/Hazara_People|title=Hazara People|publisher=National Geographic - GeoPedia|year=2008|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syed Askar Mousavi]], a contemporary Hazara writer, estimates that more than half of the entire population of Hazarajat was driven out of their villages, including many who were massacred. "It is difficult to verify such an estimate, but the memory of the conquest of the Hazārajāt by ʿAbd-al-Raḥmān Khan certainly remains vivid among the Hazāras themselves, and has heavily influenced their relations with the Afghan state throughout the 20th century."&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; 
The British from neighboring British India, who were heavily involved in Afghanistan, did not document such a large figure. Others claim that Hazaras began leaving their hometown of Hazarajat due to poverty and in search of employment mostly in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="hazara-1"&gt;{{cite web |work=Arash Khazeni, Alessandro Monsutti, Charles M. Kieffer |publisher=Encyclopædia Iranica |title=HAZĀRA |url=http://iranicaonline.org/articles/hazara-1 |date=December 15, 2003 |location=United States |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these Hazaras immigrated to neighbouring [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], where they were provided permanent settlement by the government of British India.&lt;ref name="Who are the Hazara"/&gt; Others settled in and around [[Mashad]], in the [[Khorasan Province]] of [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="hazara-1"/&gt;

The Hazaras of Afghanistan faced severe political, social and economic tyranny and denial of basic civil rights.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt; In the late 19th century, the Hazaras along with their Shia counterpart [[Qizilbash]] sided with the invading [[British Raj|British-led Indians]] against the Sunni [[Ethnic groups of Afghanistan]]. In 1933, [[Abdul Khaliq Hazara (assassin)|Abdul Khaliq Hazara]], a Hazara student assassinated Afghan King [[Mohammed Nadir Shah|Nadir Khan]].

=== Persecution and marginalization ===

Notably, after the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]], Shah Abdur conducted a campaign of repression in Hazarajat, but it was met with fierce opposition by Hazara tribal leaders. The first uprising was conducted in correlation with Shah Adbur's cousin, Mohammad Eshaq who sought to overthrow the Shah. This revolt of Hazara nationalists and anti-Shah partisans was brief, because Shah Adbur astutely used sectarian strife to divide the Hazara Shias and the Sunni partisans, thus allowing him to easily defeat his foes.&lt;ref name="The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dtsjournal.com/2016/04/01/the-mongol-hazaras-in-afghanistan/ |title=The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan |publisher= University of Toronto Journal of Diaspora and Transnationalism |date= April 1, 2016|accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the Hazaras in their first revolt allowed Shah Adbur to impose taxes on Hazarajat for the first time, and they severely impeded the autonomy of Hazarajat, because numerous Pashtun soldiers and government officials were garrisoned in Hazarajat in order to ensure its compliance with the Pashtun-run state. Subsequently, the Pashtuns garrisoned in Hazarajat, treated the local Hazaras inferiorly and often committed arbitrary acts of cruelty and brutality against them. This caused great unrest and a deepening hatred between the Hazaras and their Pashtun rulers, causing the Hazaras to reach their tipping point in 1892. When a local Pashtun garrison searched the home of a Hazara chieftain for arms, but the pretext was false, the garrison subsequently tied the chieftain up and made him watch while they raped his wife.&lt;ref name="The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan"/&gt;

The outrage that followed allowed the Hazaras to unite once again in order to overthrow most of the local Pashtun garrisons in Hazarajat. This newfound zealous fever fermented fierce resistance against Shah Adbur and his forces. Witnessing the rising tide, Shah Adbur felt he had no choice but to wage a [[jihad]] against the Shia Hazaras, and under this [[casus belli]] Shah Adbur was able to muster around 150,000 troops.&lt;ref name="The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan"/&gt; The resulting conflict was brutal and led to a great loss of life on both sides. The Hazaras fought with vigour but the attrition they faced due to lack of rations, led to their demise at the uprising's epicenter of Oruzgan.&lt;ref name="The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan"/&gt; The aftermath of the uprising was a genocide at the hands of Shah Adbur, who wiped out more than half of the entire Hazara population, and caused a myriad of people to be driven out of their villages.&lt;ref name="The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan"/&gt; Prior to the genocide, Hazaras made up more than half of Afghanistan's total population. Although once the largest ethnicity, they were now a minority, constituting roughly 9% of Afghanistan's total population.&lt;ref name="The Mongol Hazaras in Afghanistan"/&gt; Accordingly, in order to stifle Hazara influence Shah Adbur fragmented Hazarajat and demarcated it so that it would encompass numerous other provinces, where the Hazara are now a minority.

=== Afshar ===
{{main|Afshar Operation}}

In February 1993, a two-day military operation was conducted by the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] government and the Saudi-backed Sunni [[Wahhabi]] [[Ittihad-i Islami]] militia led by [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]]. At that time Ittihad-i Islami was allied with the government of [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]]. The military operation was conducted in order to seize control of the Afshar district in west Kabul where the Shia [[Hezb-e Wahdat]] militia (which was allied to [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]'s Sunni [[Hezb-i Islami]] and backed by Pakistan) was based and from where it was shelling civilian areas in northern Kabul. The operation also intended to capture Wahdat leader Abdul Ali Mazari. The Afshar district, situated on the slopes of Mount Afshar west of Kabul, is a densely populated district. The area is predominantly inhabited by Shia [[Hazara people]]. The Afshar military operation escalated into what became known as the Afshar massacre when the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] backed [[Wahhabi]] militia of [[Ittehad-al-Islami|Ittihad-e-Islami]] went on a rampage through Afshar, killing, raping, looting and burning houses. Two out of nine Islamic State sub-commanders, Anwar Dangar (later joined the [[Taliban]]) and Mullah Izzat, were also reported as leading troops that carried out abuses. The Islamic State government in collaboration with the then enemy militia of Hezb-e Wahdat as well as in cooperation with Afshar civilians established a commission to investigate the crimes that had taken place in Afshar. The commission found that around 70 people died during the street fighting and between 700 and 750 people were abducted and never returned by Abdul Rasul Sayyaf's men. These abducted victims were most likely killed or died in captivity.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"&gt;{{cite web |year=2006 |url = http://hrw.org/reports/2005/afghanistan0605/5.htm#_Toc105552365|title = Ittihad |publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]] |accessdate = 2012-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc_2001"&gt;{{cite news |date=December 2, 2001 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent/1682466.stm|title = A personal account|publisher = BBC News | last= Phil Rees | accessdate = 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of women were abducted during the operation as well.&lt;ref name="Book_Anderson"&gt;{{cite book | last = John Lee Anderson | authorlink = | title = The Lion's Grave |year=2002|page= 224 | publisher = Atlantic Books| isbn= 1-84354-118-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mazar-i-Sharif ===

Following the 1997 massacre of 3,000 Taliban prisoners by [[Abdul Malik Pahlawan]] in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1615824.stm#pahlawan |title=Afghan powerbrokers: Who's who |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date= November 19, 2001|accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; thousands of Hazara men and boys were massacred by other Taliban members in the same city in August 1998.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human rights]] organizations reported that the dead were lying on the streets for weeks before the Taliban allowed their burial due to stench and fear of epidemics.

=== Robatak Pass ===

The pass connecting the settlements of [[Kholm, Afghanistan|Tashkurgan]] and [[Puli Khumri|Pule Khumri]] is known as Robatak Pass. A mass murder was carried out there by Taliban in May 2000 in which 31 people were reported dead. Twenty-six of the victims were [[Ismaïlia|Ismaili]] Hazara from Baghalan province. Their remains were found to the northeast of the pass, in a neighborhood known as Hazara Mazari, on the border between Baghlan and Samngan provinces. The victims were detained four months before their execution by Taliban troops between January 5 and January 14, 2000.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch Robatak Pass"&gt;{{cite web |year=2006 |url = https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/afghanistan/afghan101-04.htm#P176_25561|title = Massacre at Robatak Pass, May 2000|publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]]| accessdate = 2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington File"/&gt;

=== Yakawlang ===

In January 2001 the Taliban committed a mass execution of Hazara people in [[Yakawlang District]] of [[Bamyan province]], Afghanistan. This started on January 8 and lasted for four days; it took the lives of 170 men. Taliban apprehended about 300 people, including employees of local humanitarian organizations. They were grouped to various assemblage points where they were shot dead in public view. Around 73 women, children and elderly were taking shelter in a local mosque when Taliban fired rockets at the mosque.&lt;ref name="Washington File"&gt;{{cite web |year=2001 |url = http://usinfo.org/wf-archive/2001/011017/epf312.htm|title = Fact Sheet: The Taliban's Betrayal of the Afghan People|publisher = Office of International Information Programs| accessdate = 2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch Yakawlang"&gt;{{cite web |year=2006 |url = https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/afghanistan/afghan101-03.htm#P126_15001|title = Massacre in yakaolang|publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]]| accessdate = 2012-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Khas Urozgan ===

In June 2010, at least nine Hazara men were killed in an ambush in [[Khas Urozgan District]]. The Taliban took responsibility for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Alissa J.

=== Zabul ===

In November 2015, Afghan militants claiming loyalty to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] beheaded seven ethnic Hazara civilians who had been abducted in the southern Afghan province of [[Zabul]]. Their throats were cut with metal wire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Afghan Fighters Loyal to ISIS Beheaded 7 Hostages, Officials Say |author=Mujib Mashal |author2=Taimoor Shahnov |date=November 10, 2015 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/10/world/asia/afghan-fighters-loyal-to-isis-beheaded-7-hostages-officials-say.html |page=A10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims were four men, two women, and a 9-year-old girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The beheading of a 9-year-old girl prompted huge protests in Afghanistan |author=Ishaan Tharoor |date=November 12, 2015 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/12/the-beheading-of-a-9-year-old-girl-prompted-huge-protests-in-afghanistan/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dehmazang bombings===
{{main|July 2016 Kabul bombing}}

On July 23, 2016 two [[ISIL|Islamic State]] suicide bombers blow themselves during the peaceful protest 'Junbish Roshnaye' in [[Kabul]] killing 160 and wounded over 200 people.&lt;ref name="bbckabul"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36874570 | title=Kabul explosion: Islamic State 'admits attack on Hazara protest' | publisher=BBC Asia | date=23 July 2016 | accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attackers were reportedly from the local affiliate of the so-called Islamic State, known as the "Khurasan Province" (IS-Khurasan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rafiq|first1=Arif|title=The Persecution of Afghanistan's Hazaras Has Less to Do with Religion Than You Think|url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-persecution-afghanistans-hazaras-has-less-do-religion-17174|website=nationalinterest.org|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ashura attacks===
18 people were killed and 54 were injured in July 2016 at Kabul's landmark Sakhi Shrine by a gunman wearing an Afghan National Security Forces uniform. The attack took place on the eve of Ashura, the Shia mourning day. Responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Islamic State, or ISIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shuja|first1=Ahmad|title=Afghanistan's Shia Hazara Suffer Latest Atrocity|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/10/13/afghanistans-shia-hazara-suffer-latest-atrocity|website=hrw.org|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The next morning, an improvised electronic device(IED) killed at least 15 Hazara people in the Balkh province of northern Afghanistan. ISIS claimed responsibility for this attack as well. These attacks show the growing threat of the IS to the Hazara people.

===Post-Taliban era===
There has been a significant improvement in the status and treatment of Hazaras in Afghanistan. The new Afghan constitution now recognizes them as one of the country's ethnic minorities, and they now have the full right to Afghan citizenship. In Afghanistan's recent parliamentary election, Hazaras won around 25 per cent of the seats.&lt;ref name="Afghanistan Hazaras"&gt;{{cite web|title=Afghanistan Hazaras|url=http://minorityrights.org/minorities/hazaras/|website=minorityrights.org|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazara have also pursued higher education, enrolled in the army, and many have top government positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sappenfield|first1=Mark|title=Afghanistan's success story: The liberated Hazara minority|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0806/p06s02-wosc.html?page=2|website=csmonitor.com|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Mohammad Mohaqiq, a Hazara from the Hizb-i-Wahdat party, ran in the 2004 presidential election in Afghanistan, and Karim Khalili became the Vice President of Afghanistan. Since ousting the Taliban in late 2001, billions of dollars have been poured into Afghanistan for several large-scale reconstruction projects that took place from August 2012. For example, there have been more than 5000 kilometers of road pavement completed across Afghanistan, of which little was done in central Afghanistan Hazarajat. On the other hand, the Band-e Amir in the Bamyan Province became the first national park of Afghanistan. The road from Kabul to Bamyan was also built, along with new police stations, government institutions, hospitals, and schools in the Bamyan Province, Daykundi Province, and others. The first ski resort of Afghanistan was also established in the Bamyan Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levinson|first1=Charles|title=Since Skiing Came to Afghanistan, It Has Been Pretty Much All Downhill|url=wsj.com|website=wsj.com|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is still a large degree of discrimination against Hazaras, however. A new danger in the form of ISIS has become especially prominent in recent years, and they have carried out abductions, extortions and violent killings against Hazaras.&lt;ref name="Afghanistan: Who are the Hazaras"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hucal|first1=Sarah|title=Afghanistan: Who are the Hazaras?|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/06/afghanistan-hazaras-160623093601127.html|website=aljazeera.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rising power of warlords, who the Hazara people perceive as a direct threat, has also been a matter of concern. There have been ethnic tensions and violent clashes with nomadic Kuchis over land access issues.&lt;ref name="Afghanistan Hazaras"/&gt; Taliban fighters continue to abduct and execute Hazaras travelling in vehicles. Furthermore, anti-Hazara sentiments became stronger when the former director of the National Directorate of Security, Amrullah Saleh, accused Iran of interfering in Afghan affairs through Shias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ali Seerat|first1=Rustam|title=Peril and Persecution in Afghanistan|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/08/27/peril-and-persecution-in-afghanistan/|website=foreignpolicy.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazara activists still believe that the government does not serve their people's security needs sufficiently. Parts of central Afghanistan, like the unofficial Hazara capital Bamiyan, are among the country's poorest and often lack even basic necessities like water and electricity.&lt;ref name="Afghanistan: Who are the Hazaras"/&gt; Hazara people held a protest in March 2016 against the government's decision to move a proposed power line project out of Bamiyan, seeing it as another form of ethnic discrimination.

==Pakistan==
The history of Hazara people in Pakistan dates back to the 1840s, when Hazara tribesmen from [[Hazarajat]] began migration to colonial India because of persecution by Pashtuns and Tajiks. Many Hazaras were enlisted in the British Indian Army during the first Anglo-Afghan War (1838-1840). The mass-migration and permanent settlements started in the 1890s when Emir Abdul Rahman Khan started persecuting the Hazaras of Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://minoritysupportpakistan.com/The_Hazara_Shia_of_PakistanvApril_16_edited.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Hazara are [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] Muslims with a sizable [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] minority. Pakistan is home to an estimated 20% Shia Muslim population. Sectarian violence in Pakistan started in 1980s.

===Quetta===
{{further|Persecution of Hazaras in Quetta}}
In 2011 the persecution of Hazaras in Quetta has left at least 1300 dead and more than 1500 wounded. The victims include high-profile community members, laborers, women and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://samaa.tv/newsdetail.aspx?ID=37032&amp;CID=1 |title=International commission demanded to probe Hazara killings |publisher=Samaa Tv |date=2011-10-01 |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029183755/http://samaa.tv/newsdetail.aspx?ID=37032&amp;CID=1 |archivedate=October 29, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One third of the victims are children.

As a consequence of the attacks there has been a recent exodus of Hazaras trying to flee the violence. They are headed mainly to [[Australia]] &amp; other Western Countries, where thousands of them have taken shelter and successfully relocated after obtaining refugee status. To get there, they complete an illegal and treacherous journey across [[Southeast Asia]] through air, land and sea that has already left hundreds of them dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/world/asia/fleeing-violence-in-pakistan-hazaras-brave-uncertain-journey.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0&amp;hp | work=The New York Times | first=Declan | last=Walsh | title=Fleeing Violence in Pakistan, Hazaras Brave Uncertain Journey |date=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dawn.com/2012/09/19/hazaras-exodus-to-the-land-down-under/|title=Hazaras: Exodus to the land down under|author=Zofeen T.

The most recent attack occurred on October 10, 2017, when two unidentified attackers on a motorcycle opened fire on a van heading for a nearby vegetable market, killing the driver and four others, continuing the trend of attacks against Hazaras in Quetta.

==In fiction==
The main character in [[Khaled Hosseini]]'s novel ''[[The Kite Runner]]'' is Amir, a [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] boy who has a Hazara friend, Hassan, in 1970s Afghanistan. They are bullied by an older Pashtun who expresses scorn for the Hazara people and rapes Hassan.

In the book ''In The Sea There Are Crocodiles'', Eniatollah Akbari, a Hazara boy, details his journey to escape persecution in Afghanistan.

'''''Shadowrun''''' is a [[science fantasy]] [[tabletop role-playing game]] set in a near-future [[fictional universe]] in which [[cybernetics]], [[magic in fiction|magic]] and [[fantasy]] creatures co-exist. It combines genres of [[cyberpunk]], [[urban fantasy]] and [[crime fiction|crime]], with occasional elements of [[conspiracy fiction|conspiracy]], [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[detective fiction]]. From its inception in 1989, ''Shadowrun'' has remained among the most popular role-playing games. It has spawned a vast franchise that includes a series of novels, a collectible card game, two miniature-based tabletop wargames, and multiple video games.

The title is taken from the game's main premise – that [[industrial espionage]] runs rampant in a near-future setting.  A ''shadowrun'' – a successful [[data theft]] or physical break-in at a rival corporation or organization – is one of the main tools employed by both corporate rivals and underworld figures.  Deckers (futuristic [[hacker (computer security)|hackers]]) who can tap into an immersive, three-dimensional cyberspace are opposed by rival deckers and lethal, potentially brain-destroying [[artificial intelligence]]s called "[[Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics]]" – "ICE" for short –, who are protected by street fighters and/or mercenaries, often with [[cyborg]] implants (called ''cyberware''), [[magician (paranormal)|magicians]], and other exotic figures, on such missions as they seek access, physical or remote, to the power structures of rival groups.  [[Magic (paranormal)|Magic]] has also returned to the world after a series of [[dystopia]]n [[plague (disease)|plagues]];  [[dragon]]s who can take human form have returned as well, and are commonly found in high positions of corporate power.

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Setting==
''Shadowrun'' takes place several decades in the future (2050 in the first edition, currently {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+62}}&lt;ref group="note" name="when"/&gt;). The end of the [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]] ushered in the "Sixth World",&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See [[2012 phenomenon]].&lt;/ref&gt; with once-mythological beings (e.g. dragons) appearing and forms of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] suddenly emerging. Large numbers of humans have "Goblinized" into orks and trolls, while many human children are born as elves, dwarves, and even more exotic creatures. In North America, [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] discovered that their traditional ceremonies allow them to command powerful spirits, and rituals associated with a new [[Ghost Dance]] movement let them take control of much of the western U.S. and Canada, where they formed a federation of Native American Nations. [[Seattle]] remains under U.S. control by treaty as a [[city-state]] enclave, and most game materials are set there and assume campaigns will use it as their setting.

In parallel with these magical developments, the setting's 21st century features technological and social developments associated with [[cyberpunk]] science fiction.
[[Megacorporation]]s control the lives of their employees and command [[Private military company|their own armies]]; the ten largest have [[extraterritoriality]], such as currently enjoyed by foreign heads of state. Technological advances make cyberware (mechanical replacement body parts) and bioware (augmented vat-grown body parts implanted in place of natural organs) common. The Computer Crash of 2029 led to the creation of the Matrix, a worldwide computer network that users interact with via direct neural interface. When conflicts arise, corporations, governments, [[organized crime]] syndicates, and even wealthy individuals subcontract their dirty work to specialists, who then perform "shadowruns" or missions undertaken by deniable assets without identities or those that wish to remain unknown. The most skilled of these specialists, called shadowrunners, have earned a reputation for getting the job done. They have developed a knack for staying alive, and prospering, in the world of ''Shadowrun''.

==Publication history==
''Shadowrun'' was developed and published by [[FASA]] from 1989 until early 2001, when FASA closed its doors and the property was transferred to [[WizKids]] (a company founded by former FASA employees). WizKids licensed the RPG rights to [[Fantasy Productions]] (who were already publishing for the German version) until they were acquired by [[Topps]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20030624&amp;slug=bizbriefs24 |title=Topps will buy WizKids in cash deal |publisher=Community.seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=2003-06-24 |accessdate=2013-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catalyst Game Labs]] (a publishing imprint of InMediaRes Productions) licensed the rights from Topps to publish new products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catalystgamelabs.com/shadowrun/ |title=Shadowrun at Catalyst Game Labs |publisher=Catalystgamelabs.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; WizKids itself produced an unsuccessful collectible action figure game based on the property, called ''[[Shadowrun Duels]]''.

''Shadowrun'' Fifth Edition was announced in December 2012.&lt;ref name=CatalystYearOfShadowrun /&gt; It was released as a [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] in July 2013, with a limited-edition softcover version of the Fifth Edition core rulebook sold at the [[Origins Game Fair]] in June 2013. The hardcover version was released in August 2013.  It is generally similar to the system that was unveiled in Fourth Edition and modified in the Twentieth Anniversary Edition.

Since 2004, ''Shadowrun Missions'' (''SRM'') has offered fans "[[living campaigns]]" that allow for persistent character advancement. ''SRM'' is broken down into "seasons" which are made up of up to 24 individual missions that can be played at home, with special missions available to play exclusively at conventions. Each ''SRM'' season develops an overarching plot focused on a specific city from the ''Shadowrun'' setting. Missions settings have included the divided city of Denver, the corporate city-state of Manhattan, and the Seattle Metroplex city-state, and the formerly walled-off wastelands of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Catalyst Game Labs| title = Official Shadowrun Site: Shadowrun Missions| url = http://www.facebook.com/SRMissions/| accessdate = 25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Shadowrun'' role-playing game has spawned several properties, including ''[[Shadowrun: The Trading Card Game]]'', eight video games, an action figure game (''Shadowrun Duels''), two magazines, an art book and [[List of Shadowrun books#Novels|more than 50 novels]], starting with the ''Secrets of Power'' series which introduces some of the original characters of ''Shadowrun'' and provides an introduction to this fictional universe. In addition to the main rule book (now in its fifth edition) there have been over 100 supplemental books published with adventures and expansions to both the rules and the game settings. Catalyst Game Labs announced that 2013 would be "The Year of Shadowrun," and in addition to the release of Shadowrun Fifth Edition that it has collaborated with publishers on the following properties: ''Shadowrun: Crossfire, The Adventure Deck-building Game'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Shadowrun:Crossfire| title = Shadowrun:Crossfire on Board Game Geek Site: BoardGameGeek| url = http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/135382/shadowrun-crossfire| accessdate = 29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shadowrun: Sprawl Gangers'', a [[miniature wargaming|tactical miniatures wargame]]; and ''Shadowrun: Hostile Takeover'', a board game designed by Bryan C.P. Steele is planned for release in late 2014/early 2015. In addition, Catalyst has been in collaboration with Nordic Games and Cliffhanger Studios to create ''[[Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown]]'' online RPG, as well as teasing the release of future novels and other ''Shadowrun'' fiction.&lt;ref name=CatalystYearOfShadowrun /&gt;

==Fictional universe==
The ''Shadowrun'' world is [[cross-genre]], incorporating elements of both cyberpunk and [[urban fantasy]]. Unlike in a purely cyberpunk game, in the ''Shadowrun'' world, magic exists and has "worked" since 2011. Among other things, this split humankind into subtypes, also known as metatypes/metahumans. Some of these metatypes take the form of common [[fantasy]] races. Likewise, some animals have turned into familiar monsters of past fantasy and lore and both monsters and human magicians have regained magical powers. By the second half of the 21st century, in the time the game is set, these events are accepted as commonplace. Man, machine, and magic exist in a world where the amazing is among the most common and technology has entered into every facet of human (and metahuman) life.

===Races===
Characters in ''Shadowrun'' can be humans, orks, trolls, elves, dwarves, as well as certain diverging subspecies (known as metavariants) such as gnomes, giants, minotaurs, etc. In the early days, when magic returned to the world, humans began to either change into, or give birth to elf and dwarf infants, a phenomenon called Unexplained Genetic Expression (UGE). Later, some juvenile and adult humans "goblinized" into other races (mostly orks, but also some trolls). The term "[[metahuman]]" is used either to refer to humanity as a whole, including all races, or to refer specifically to non-human races, depending on context. With the return of [[Halley's Comet]] new human variants called "changelings" arose. Two of the metahuman races have [[fictional language]]s.

Additionally, a virus known as the Human Meta-Human Vampiric Virus (HMHVV), with many variant strains, has been known to cause further change, far beyond that of traditional vampirism, frequently resulting in fierce abominations that are no longer human and sometimes no longer even sentient: [[bandersnatch]]es, [[banshee]]s, [[Dzunukwa|dzoo-noo-quas]], [[goblin]]s, [[ghoul]]s, [[nosferatu (word)|nosferatus]], [[vampire]]s, [[wendigo]]s, wild [[fomorians]], and others. Most of these species do not consider human/metahuman types as more than victims, and are generally treated as dangerous subjects by society. They are not normally available as player characters. [[Dragon]]s are also present in the awakened world, though not as player characters. Dragons are very powerful physically, magically, and in some situations, financially; some dragons found the riches they hoarded and hid during the last Awakening. Their great intelligence allowed them to gain a great deal of influence and power quickly and a few have risen to high political and economical posts, running entire corporations or even as heads of state.

===Game background===
The game is set 62 years in the future,&lt;ref group="note" name="when"/&gt; following a great change that has returned magic to the world. The emergence of magic, the outbreak of the VITAS plagues, the Computer Crash of 2029, the Euro-Wars, and the fevers for independence of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] tribes, Chinese provinces, and everything else that came with the many struggles that ravaged Europe and Asia left the world's governments tumbling and falling. The United States was broken into substates. Monetary value was lost. The world had to rebuild, and rebuild they did, this time in the image of the megacorporations that seized power. Taking advantage of the laws that had been passed years ago, and using their newfound freedom, the megacorps began impressing their power on the failing governments. Before long the world was transformed. Boundaries were redrawn, and the political landscape was changed forever.

A basic premise of the setting is that as the world endured the string of state-changing events and conflicts, the political landscape fragmented and reformed. In North America, for example, some nations broke apart and reformed, as was the case with the Confederation of American States and the United Canadian and American States, while others became havens for specific racial or ethnic groups, like Native American Nations (the Native Americans having used their newfound magical abilities to regain massive tracts of land) or the Elvish principality of Tír Tairngire, which encompasses all of the state of Oregon. Some, like the California Free State, simply declared independence, while yet others became ''de facto'' corporate subsidiaries like Aztlan (the former Mexico), the headquarters of the Aztechnology megacorp. Despite the new role of megacorporations, many nations still hold considerable sway through economic, social and military means. For most people, “getting by” means taking advantage of whatever the corps or the government might bring their way.

===The corporations===
The monolithic "enemies" of the ''Shadowrun'' world (borrowing heavily from cyberpunk mythos) are the corporations, dubbed "megacorporations", "megacorps", or simply "megas" or "corps" for short. Megacorporations in the 21st-century are global, with all but the smallest corps owning multiple subsidiaries and divisions around the world. They are the [[superpower]]s of the ''Shadowrun'' universe, with the largest corporations having far more political, economic, and military power than even the most powerful nation-states.

In ''Shadowrun'', corporations are effectively "ranked" by the amount of assets under their control, including material, personnel, and property, as well as profit. These ranks are A, AA, and AAA; AAA corporations are top tier. Most corporations in the AA and AAA level are immune to domestic law, responsible only to themselves, and regulated only by the Corporate Court, an assembly of the ten AAA-rated corporations. All AAA-rated and most AA-rated corporations exhibit a privilege known as "[[extraterritoriality]]", meaning that any land owned by the corp is [[sovereignty|sovereign territory]] only to the corp and immune to any laws of the country within. Corporate territory is not foreign soil but corporate soil, just like its employees are corporate citizens, though [[multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] in a corporation and a nation is common. The AAA corps, as well as numerous minor corporations, fight each other not only in the boardroom or during high-level business negotiations but also with physical destruction, clandestine operations, hostile extraction or elimination of vital personnel, and other means of sabotage. Because no corporation wants to be held liable for damages, it has to be done by deniable assets, or shadowrunners, invisible to the system where every citizen is tagged with a System Identification Number (SIN).

===Technology and the Matrix===
Despite the Crash which caused much data corruption, technology in the game is advanced. [[Cyberware]] (technical implants) and Bioware (genetically engineered implants which enhance a person's abilities) emerged. Characters can also augment their bodies with [[nanotechnology]] implants.

In earlier editions, direct neural interface technology enabled humans and metahumans to directly access computers and the Matrix, the ingame global computer network restructured after the 2029 Crash. Access to the Matrix was accomplished by "deckers": individuals that have "cyberdecks". These interface machines are connected to the brain through a [[brain–computer interface]] called a "datajack" that is generally located at the temple or behind the ear.

In ''Shadowrun, Fourth Edition'', the Matrix rules have changed, thanks to the setting's constant evolution and a drive to match real world technological developments. After the second Matrix crash in 2064, Matrix technology was moved away from the wired network and led into a wireless technology. The most noticeable difference between the Matrix in the 2070s and the earlier editions is that wireless technology has become completely ubiquitous. Communications and Matrix access is provided through [[Wi-Fi]] nodes [[mesh networking|placed throughout the infrastructure]] of just about every city on Earth, fulfilling a service similar to contemporary [[cell site]]s—but as these nodes are as numerous as telephone poles, only a tiny percentage of their range is necessary. The nodes of all electronic devices a person carries are connected in a similar manner, creating a Personal Area Network (PAN). People access their PAN with their Commlink, a combination personal computer/cell phone/PDA/wireless device available either as a [[brain implant]] or a [[head-mounted display]]. This access can be the total sensory immersion common to cyberpunk fiction, or a sensory enhancement by which the virtual features of one's physical surroundings can be perceived and manipulated. The Matrix of the 2070s is thus not only a [[virtual reality]], but an [[augmented reality|augmented]] or [[mixed reality]]. Cyberdecks are obsolete, so "deckers" have once again become "hackers". In turn, the [[otaku]] of previous versions (deckers who did not need decks to access the Matrix) have been reworked into [[Technomancy|technomancers]], who possess an innate connection to the Matrix that permits them to access the wireless network without hardware.

In ''Shadowrun Fifth Edition'', corporations have cracked down on hacking, reforming the matrix into Grids for better control and creating the Grid Overwatch Division (GOD). Hackers were thus forced to acquire specialized, larger variants of commlinks, which were swiftly named cyberdecks after the devices of old. This has resulted in the return of the term "decker" of earlier editions.

In the sixth world, riggers are people who use datajacks and in most cases a special type of cyberware - called the "control rig" - to interface with vehicles and drones. Often they also use a remote control deck called the "rigger command console". The term "rigger" may also be applied to others using these machines.

Riggers jump in to machines to control them with their mind. While jumped in they feel like they are the machine, using the vehicle or drone's sensors to replace their own. This allows the rigger to control the machine at Matrix speeds and with greater precision. The downside is if the machine takes damage the rigger will have to deal with dangerous levels of biofeedback. Likewise the rigger may have to engage in cybercombat with other hackers that are attempting to hijack their devices.

===Magic===
Those able to actively interact with the magical energies of the Sixth World are known as "awakened". An awakened character's power in magic is linked to their Magic attribute. A magic user's approach to working with mystic energy is called their Path. The Awakened fall into three general Paths: magicians, adepts and mystic adepts. Broadly speaking, magicians focus their magic outward, actively affecting the world around them, while adepts focus their magic inward, passively enhancing their bodies and minds.

Magicians are able to cast spells, summon spirits, and create magical artifacts called "foci". All magicians follow traditions that determine their understanding of magic, including hermetic mages (whose control of magic comes through study and manipulation of magical energy or mana, and who summon and bind elementals in lengthy and expensive rituals to be called on later) and shamans (whose magic derives from a connection to nature via a totem spirit, and who can summon the nature spirits associated with a particular place). Adepts use magic internally in order to accentuate their natural physical abilities. Adepts can run on walls, use mundane objects as deadly thrown projectiles, shatter hard objects with a single unarmed blow, and perform similar feats of incredible ability. All adepts follow a very personal path (Path of the Warrior, Path of the Artist, etc.) that normally determines their abilities which might be very different for any two adepts (while one might demonstrate increased reflexes and facility with firearms, a second might possess unparalleled mastery of the [[katana]], and a third might be able to pull off incredible vehicular stunts). Mystic adepts, also known as physical mages, are part magician and part adept who distribute their magic power between the abilities of both aspects.

==System==

===Mechanics===
[[File:Shadowrun Wuerfel Dice.jpeg|thumb|185px|A 6-sided die with the Shadowrun symbol in place of the 6.]]

The ''Shadowrun'' game mechanics are based entirely on a 6-sided [[dice]] system. The game is skill-based rather than class-based, but [[archetype]]s are presented in the main book to give players and gamemasters an idea of what is possible with the system.

Before the fourth edition, skill and ability checks worked as follows: all actions in the game, from the use of skills to making attacks in combat, are first given a target number that reflects the difficulty of the action which is then raised or lowered by various modifying factors, such as environmental conditions, the condition of the character, the use of mechanical aids, and so forth. The player then rolls a number of dice equal to their level in the relevant skill, and the number of dice rolled that meet or exceed the target number determines if the character is successful performing the action and the degree of success the character has. As an example, a character with a high firearms skill not only has a better chance at hitting a target than someone with a lower ranked skill, but also is more likely to cause more damage to the target. Target numbers may exceed 6, in which case any dice that show a 6 have to be re-rolled (a target number of, e.g., 9 is reached by rolling a 6 followed by at least a 3; thus, a target number of 6 and one of 7 are identical, except extra dice rolls are not allowed for target number 7 or greater). For even higher target numbers, this procedure has to be repeated; thus, an action with a target number of 20 (like attempting to procure military-grade weaponry) will only succeed if three successive dice rolls result in sixes, and the fourth gives at least a 2. For any dice-roll a roll of 1 always counts as a failure. This system allows great flexibility in setting the difficulty of an action.

In addition to this basic mechanic, players can use several task-specific dice pools to add bonus dice to certain tests, though dice that are used do not refresh until the end of a turn. This adds an extra tactical element, as the player must decide where best to spend these bonus dice. For example, combat pool dice could be spent to improve attacks or to improve defense, or some of each. Players also have Karma Pool that can be used to reroll any dice that failed to reach the target number. Karma Pool refreshes rarely, typically once per scene or less, at the GM's discretion.  The combination of Karma Pool and dice pools gives players a considerable amount of freedom to decide how important a task is to their character. Two characters with identical statistics could perform very differently on the same tasks depending on their priorities (and thus, allocation of dice pools and Karma Pool).

In the fourth edition, things have changed substantially. The game still runs on six-sided dice, but now each task is given a threshold. The player then rolls dice equal to their skill plus the relevant attribute modified by applicable modifiers. The number of fives and sixes is equal to the number of hits. Hits above the threshold indicate extraordinary performance. Furthermore, if more than half the dice rolled are ones, then the player has made a glitch. Glitches cause bad things to happen to the player and game masters are encouraged to be inventive and funny.

===Archetypes===
Although the skill system is freeform, certain combinations of skills and equipment work well together. This combination of specialization in skill and equipment is known as an archetype. The most notable archetypes are street samurai, characters who have heavily augmented their bodies with cyberware and bioware and focus on physical combat; adepts, characters who have magical abilities that increase their physical (and sometimes mental) combat abilities; faces, highly charismatic characters who specialize in negotiations and social manipulation; hackers (deckers), experts in electronic surveillance, security, and [[augmented reality|augmented]]/[[virtual reality]] monitoring, combat and response; riggers, who augment their brains to achieve fine control over vehicles and drones; and magicians, who cast spells and can view emotions and call spirits from astral space. In ''Fourth Edition'', with the setting change, deckers are replaced by hackers, who manipulate computer networks with augmented reality via ubiquitous commlinks; they also tend to take over the rigger's role.

However, the archetypes are not character classes: the player is allowed to cross boundaries. Restrictions are not imposed by the system itself, but by the player's specializations. Because character-building resources are limited, the player has to weigh which game resource he wants to specialize in and which he has to neglect. This allows high character customization while still ensuring that characters are viable in the setting.

===Character creation===
The fourth edition of ''Shadowrun'' uses a point-based character creation system. Earlier editions and later in the fifth edition, used a priority-based system with point-based character creation as an advanced option. Priorities are divided into race, magic, attributes, skills, and resources. All things that do not explicitly fall under the first four classifications, including contacts in third and earlier editions of ''Shadowrun'', are given cash-equivalent values to be bought with resources.

''Shadowrun'' characters are created with contacts, friends and acquaintances who serve as key nodes in the character's social network and who will often help the character out.  Through the contacts system, players may uncover information that their characters cannot independently acquire. Additionally, players can often negotiate for the use of skills that their characters do not themselves have, a radical departure from most role-playing games.

===Essence and Karma/Edge===
Essence is a measure of a living being's lifeforce. All humans and metahumans start with a value of six (although critters may start with a higher or lower Essence). It powers magic, and as essence fades, so does magical aptitude. Cyberware, bioware, nanotech implants, extreme cases of substance addiction, and other major changes to a being's body can damage its essence as well. Generally, if a being's essence ever reaches zero, it dies. Cybermancy allows metahumans to survive with an essence rating of zero or less.

Players are awarded Karma points as a game progresses. In third edition and earlier, these points are usually added to a total called Good Karma, which can be used to boost attributes and skills. Skills that are already well-developed cost more Good Karma than skills which are undeveloped, which helps encourage specialized characters to become more flexible by spending Good Karma on weaker attributes. Karma also makes characters more powerful in general because every tenth (or twentieth for metahumans) point is added to the Karma Pool instead of Good Karma. The Karma Pool allows players to re-roll dice or "purchase" additional dice in certain situations. Karma can even be used to avoid certain death, at the cost of all Good Karma and Karma Pool points. In fourth edition, Karma Pool is replaced by a new attribute called Edge which can be used in most of the same ways as the third edition Karma Pool. Experience and character advancement is still tracked with Karma, although Good was dropped from the name as it no longer needs to be distinguished from the old Karma Pool.

==Influences and links==
''Shadowrun'' is linked to ''[[Earthdawn]]'', and is set in the "Sixth World", where ''Earthdawn'' is the "Fourth World" and modern-day Earth is at the tail end of the ''Fifth World''. Such links are not necessary for play, but they allow crossover potential. The concept of the "Worlds" is linked to the ancient [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]] belief that the world is renewed every five thousand years—a period called a "Sun" (currently we live in the [[Five Suns|fifth Sun]]). The date of the beginning of the "Sixth World" is based on the ancient [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]], which when ''Shadowrun'' was developed was correlated as finishing a 5,200-year-long cycle on 24 December 2011. The understanding of the Maya that resulted in the use of the 2011 date and the use of the "worlds" concept is due to the influence of [[Frank Waters]]'s 1975 book ''Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth World of Consciousness'', whose elaborate cosmology is selectively utilized in the framework of the ''Shadowrun'' universe. Waters took his information about the date of the end of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar from the 1966 edition of [[Michael D. Coe]]'s ''The Maya''.

''Shadowrun'' is also influenced by the writings of [[William Gibson]] (particularly ''[[Neuromancer]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Maleficent Rea|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/07/26/shadowrun-returns-review/ |title=Shadowrun Returns needs to curtail its nostalgia (review) |publisher=Venturebeat.com |date=2013-07-26 |accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson, who gave no permission and expressed strong aversion for mixing his ideas with "spare me, *elves*,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://williamgibsonblog.blogspot.com/2003_05_01_archive.html |title=William Gibson |publisher=Williamgibsonblog.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; reacted as follows to its release:

In 2007, Robert Boyd from [[Carrickfergus]], Northern Ireland, robbed a [[Belfast]] lingerie shop at knifepoint while wearing a blonde lady's wig. During his trial, Boyd stated he was playing ''Shadowrun'', specifically the role of criminal elf Buho, at the time and may have "blurred reality and fantasy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/6425333.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Northern Ireland &amp;#124; Elf defence for 'lingerie thief' |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-03-06 |accessdate=2013-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim convinced only two members of the jury and Boyd was jailed for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/05/22/magical_elf_jailed/|title=Magical elf jailed for lifting women's knickers|publisher=The Register|date=                            22 May 2007|accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Novels==
{{Main article|List of Shadowrun books#Novels and other fiction}}

FASA released 40 ''Shadowrun'' novels in collaboration with [[New American Library|Roc publishing]] between 1991 and 2001. ''Shadowrun'' novels went out of production between 2001 and 2005, making the books produced towards the end of FASA's ownership of the license hard to find. Another (41st) novel was announced, but never released.

In 2005, WizKids began publishing new ''Shadowrun'' novels, again through the Roc imprint of the New American Library. Six novels were released in the new series. In 2008, Catalyst Game Labs announced the return of novels for ''Classic BattleTech'', ''MechWarrior'' and ''Shadowrun''. The announcement states that the first of the all-new ''Shadowrun'' novels would appear tentatively by early 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalystgamelabs.com/2008/06/27/catalyst-game-labs-bring-classic-battletech-shadowrun-and-mechwarrior-novels-back-to-bookstores/ |title=Catalystgamelabs.com |publisher=Catalystgamelabs.com |date=2008-06-27 |accessdate=2013-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the novels were not released due to unexplained delays in production of the novels for all three franchises. A collection of short stories titled ''Spells and Chrome'' was published in 2010. In 2012, Catalyst Game Labs published a standalone electronic novella, ''Neat'', written by Russell Zimmerman.&lt;ref name=RPGNow&gt;{{cite web|title=RPGNow: Shadowrun: Novella: Neat|url=http://www.rpgnow.com/product/107953/Shadowrun-Novella-Neat|publisher=RPGNow|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalyst later announced plans to release further fiction and eventually novels to be released in collaboration with Barnes &amp; Noble in Winter 2013.&lt;ref name="Catalyst Year Of Shadowrun Announcement"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bills|first=Randall|title=The Year of Shadowrun|url=http://cdn.shadowruntabletop.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SR5-Announcement-Update.pdf|publisher=Catalyst Game Labs|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several additional novels were published in other languages. More than 30 novels have been written in German, by German and Austrian authors published by Heyne (since 1991) and [[Fantasy Productions|FanPro]] (since 1997).{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Video games==
Eight video games have been developed based on the ''Shadowrun'' franchise; the first in 1993 was an [[action role-playing game]] titled ''[[Shadowrun (1993 video game)|Shadowrun]]'' and developed by [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Beam Software]] for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The second, also titled ''Shadowrun'', was released for the [[Sega Genesis]] in 1994, developed by [[BlueSky Software]]. The third game was an [[interactive fiction]] [[adventure game]] developed by Japanese company [[Group SNE]] in 1995 for the [[Sega CD]], again titled ''[[Shadowrun (1996 video game)|Shadowrun]]''. A fourth game, titled ''Shadowrun: Assassin'', was planned to be released in 1998 by [[FASA Studio|FASA Interactive Technologies]] for the PC, but was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hardcore Gaming 101: Shadowrun|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/shadowrun/shadowrun2.htm|website=www.hardcoregaming101.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next game released was a [[first-person shooter]] for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[Windows Vista]], entitled ''[[Shadowrun (2007 video game)|Shadowrun]]''. It was developed by FASA Interactive, owned by [[Microsoft]], which also produced the title. It was the very first game that allows cross-platform play on the [[Games for Windows – Live]] service. As the publishers of the ''Shadowrun'' role-playing game stated at the time of the video game's release: "Microsoft rewrote the timeline and setting for this game, so it is not in continuity with the tabletop RPG. It may be more accurately described as a game loosely based on ''Shadowrun''."

In September 2007, Microsoft closed FASA Studios and licensed the ''Shadowrun'' electronic entertainment rights to Smith &amp; Tinker, a company owned by [[Jordan Weisman]], one of the original creators of ''Shadowrun''. In 2012, Weisman's company [[Harebrained Schemes]] launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to fund the development of ''[[Shadowrun Returns]]'', a 3D turn-based single player role-playing video game. Approximately 1.8 million US dollars were pledged, four times more than the $400,000 goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shadowrun Returns|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1613260297/shadowrun-returns|publisher=Kickstarter|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Shadowrun Returns]]'' was released on July 25, 2013. An expansion for ''Shadowrun Returns'' named ''[[Shadowrun: Dragonfall]]'' was created as a stretch goal, and then later re-released as a standalone game called ''Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut''. In January 2015, Harebrained Schemes launched another Kickstarter to fund [[Shadowrun: Hong Kong]], which was released August 2015. Jan Wagner's Cliffhanger Productions also ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for an online 3D [[turn-based strategy]] [[role-playing video game]] that can be played either alone or with other players. On 14 August 2012, the campaign was funded at $558,863. The game was due to be released at the end of 2013 as ''Shadowrun Online'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shadowrun Online|url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=493454340742047&amp;id=170199826400835|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was actually released in April 2015 as ''[[Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordicgames.at/index.php/article/shadowrun_online_renamed_to_shadowrun_chronicles_boston_lockdown|title=Shadowrun Online renamed to Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown|publisher=[[Nordic Games]]|date=March 3, 2015|accessdate=July 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Shadowrun'' was ranked 8th in the 1996 reader poll of ''Arcane'' magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time.  The UK magazine's editor Paul Pettengale commented: "''Shadowrun'''s strength lies in the cleverly designed background, which creates a unique setting that actually works and is continually evolving. It also ties in with FASA's other main system, ''Earthdawn'' - while ''Shadowrun'' is the future, ''Earthdawn'' is the past of the same world. Between the two a fascinating universe has been created, offering a great deal of potential for all styles of play."&lt;ref name="Arcane14"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Pettengale|first=Paul|date= Christmas 1996 |title=Arcane Presents the Top 50 Roleplaying Games 1996|journal=Arcane|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|issue=14|pages=25-35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven S. Long]] comments: "''Shadowrun'' second edition belongs on the list of best hobby games because it so superbly integrates the gaming-specific material with the setting information. In doing so it satisfies what many gamers see as their twin needs: hard-and-fast rules that make gameplay fun; and an immersive setting that enhances the gaming experience, rather than detracting from it."&lt;ref name="HG"&gt;{{Cite book | contribution=Shadowrun | title=Hobby Games: The 100 Best | last=Long | first=Steve | authorlink=Steven S.

'''''Snow-Bound: A Winter Idyl''''' is a long [[narrative poetry|narrative poem]] by American poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] first published in 1866.

==Overview==
The poem takes place in what is today known as the [[John Greenleaf Whittier Homestead]], which still stands in [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, William. ''Literary New England: A History and Guide''. Boston: Faber and Faber, 1993: 126. {{ISBN|0-571-19816-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem chronicles a rural New England family as a snowstorm rages outside for three days. Stuck in their home for a week, the family members exchange stories by their roaring fire.

==Composition and publication history==
[[File:John Greenleaf Whittier 1859.png|thumb|left|John Greenleaf Whittier, author of ''Snow-Bound'', pictured in 1859]]
Whittier began the poem originally as a personal gift to his niece Elizabeth as a method of remembering the family.&lt;ref name=Woodwell336&gt;Woodwell, Roland H. ''John Greenleaf Whittier: A Biography''. Haverhill, Massachusetts: Trustees of the John Greenleaf Whittier Homestead, 1985: 336.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he told publisher [[James Thomas Fields]] about it, referring to it as "a homely picture of old New England homes".&lt;ref name=Woodwell336/&gt; The poem was written in [[John Greenleaf Whittier House|Whittier's home]] in [[Amesbury, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;Danilov, Victor J. ''Famous Americans: A Directory of Museums, Historic Sites, and Memorials''. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2013: 202. {{ISBN|978-0-8108-9185-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is set at his [[John Greenleaf Whittier Homestead|ancestral home]] in [[Haverhill, Massachusetts|Haverhill]].&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, William. ''Literary New England: A History and Guide''. Boston: Faber and Faber, 1993: 126. {{ISBN|0-571-19816-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Snow-Bound'' was first published as a book-length poem on February 17, 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Woodwell, Roland H. ''John Greenleaf Whittier: A Biography''. Haverhill, Massachusetts: Trustees of the John Greenleaf Whittier Homestead, 1985: 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
[[File:Whittier House.jpg|thumb|right|The home where ''Snow-Bound'' takes place is today preserved and open to the public as the [[John Greenleaf Whittier Homestead]].]]
''Snow-Bound'' was financially successful, much to Whittier's surprise.&lt;ref&gt;Wagenknecht, Edward. ''John Greenleaf Whittier: A Portrait in Paradox''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1967: 7.&lt;/ref&gt; By the summer after its first publication, sales had reached 20,000, earning Whittier royalties of ten cents per copy. He ultimately collected $10,000 for it.&lt;ref&gt;Woodwell, Roland H. ''John Greenleaf Whittier: A Biography''. Haverhill, Massachusetts: Trustees of the John Greenleaf Whittier Homestead, 1985: 338–339.&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity also led to the home depicted in the poem being preserved as a museum in 1892.&lt;ref name=Sorby35&gt;Sorby, Angela. ''Schoolroom Poets: Childhood, Performance, and the Place of American Poetry, 1865–1917''. Durham, NH: University of New Hampshire Press, 2005: 35. {{ISBN|1-58465-458-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first important critical response to ''Snow-Bound'' came from [[James Russell Lowell]]. Published in the ''[[North American Review]]'', the review emphasized the poem as a record of a vanishing era. "It describes scenes and manners which the rapid changes of our national habits will soon have made as remote from us as if they were foreign or ancient," he wrote. "Already are the railroads displacing the companionable cheer of crackling walnut with the dogged self-complacency and sullen virtue of [[anthracite]]."&lt;ref&gt;Sorby, Angela. ''Schoolroom Poets: Childhood, Performance, and the Place of American Poetry, 1865–1917''. Durham, NH: University of New Hampshire Press, 2005: 37. {{ISBN|1-58465-458-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was second in popularity only to [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]'' and was published well into the twentieth century. Though it remains in many common anthologies today, it is not as widely read as it once was.&lt;ref name=Sorby35/&gt;

==Analysis==
The poem attempts to make the ideal past retrievable.&lt;ref&gt;Buell, Lawrence. ''New England Literary Culture: From Revolution Through Renaissance''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1986: 127. {{ISBN|0-521-37801-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time it was published, homes like the Whittier family homestead were examples of the fading rural past of the United States.&lt;ref name=Sorby35/&gt; The use of storytelling by the fireplace was a metaphor against modernity in a post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] United States, without acknowledging any of the specific forces modernizing the country.&lt;ref&gt;Newcomb, John Timberman. ''Would Poetry Disappear?: American Verse and the Crisis of Modernity''. Ohio State University Press, 2004: 39–40. {{ISBN|978-0-8142-5124-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The raging snowstorm also suggests impending death, which is combated against through the family's nostalgic memories.&lt;ref&gt;Newcomb, John Timberman. ''Would Poetry Disappear?: American Verse and the Crisis of Modernity''. Ohio State University Press, 2004: 41. {{ISBN|978-0-8142-5124-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Angela Sorby suggests the poem focuses on whiteness and its definition, ultimately signaling a vision of a biracial America after the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Sorby, Angela. ''Schoolroom Poets: Childhood, Performance, and the Place of American Poetry, 1865–1917''. Durham, NH: University of New Hampshire Press, 2005: 36. {{ISBN|1-58465-458-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Comic balloons 4 types 1x4.svg|thumb|The four most common speech balloons, top to bottom: speech, whisper, thought, scream.]]

'''Speech balloons''' (also '''speech bubbles''', '''dialogue balloons''' or '''word balloons''') are a graphic convention used most commonly in [[comic book]]s, [[comic]]s and [[cartoon]]s to allow words (and much less often, pictures) to be understood as representing the speech or thoughts of a given character in the comic. There is often a formal distinction between the balloon that indicates thoughts and the one that indicates words spoken aloud: the balloon that conveys thoughts is often referred to as a '''thought bubble'''.

==History==
[[Image:Strigel 1506-detail.jpg|thumb|Before the 20th century,{{specify}} speech was depicted using bands, flags, scrolls, or sheets of paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bugpowder.com/andy/e.speechballoons.evolution.html Evolution of speech balloons].

[[Image:Ograbme.jpg|thumb|In this 1807 political cartoon opposing [[Embargo Act of 1807|Jefferson's Embargo]], the form and function of speech balloons is already similar to their modern use.]]
One of the earliest antecedents to the modern speech bubble were the "[[speech scroll]]s", wispy lines that connected first person speech to the mouths of the speakers in [[Mesoamerican]] art between 600 and 900 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper| author=Hull, Kerry Michael| title=Verbal Art and Performance in Ch’orti’ and Maya Hieroglyphic Writing| year=2003| url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2003/hullkm039/hullkm039.pdf| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012021647/http://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2003/hullkm039/hullkm039.pdf| archivedate=2006-10-12| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western graphic art, labels that reveal what a pictured figure is saying have appeared since at least the 13th century. These were in common European use by the early 16th century. Word balloons (also known as "banderoles") began appearing in 18th-century printed broadsides, and political cartoons from the [[American Revolution]] (including some published by [[Benjamin Franklin]]) often used them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.rtp.nc.us/tserve/eighteen/ekeyinfo/erelrev.htm|title=Religion and the American Revolution, Divining America, TeacherServe®, National Humanities Center|work=rtp.nc.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA04/wood/ykid/illustrated.htm The Yellow Kid on paper and stage, Contemporary illustrations]''. Retrieved October 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; They later fell out of fashion, but by 1904 had regained their popularity, although they were still considered novel enough to require explanation.&lt;ref name=ArtOfCaricature&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofcaricature00wrig#page/134/mode/2up/ The Art of Caricature], p. 134, by Grant Wright; published September 1904, by Baker &amp; Taylor Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of the [[comics]] industry in the 20th century, the appearance of speech balloons has become increasingly standardized, though the formal conventions that have evolved in different cultures (USA as opposed to Japan, for example), can be quite distinct.

[[Richard F. Outcault]]'s [[Yellow Kid]] is generally credited as the first American comic strip character. His words initially appeared on his yellow shirt, but word balloons very much like those in use today were added almost immediately, as early as 1896. By the start of the 20th century, word balloons were ubiquitous, and since that time only a very few American comic strips and comic books have relied on captions, notably [[Hal Foster]]'s ''[[Prince Valiant]]'' and the early [[Tarzan (comics)|''Tarzan'' comic strip]] in the 1930s. In Europe, where [[text comics]] were more common, speech balloons slowly caught on with well known examples like [[Alain Saint-Ogan]]'s ''[[Zig et Puce]]'' (1925), [[Hergé]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' (1929)  and [[Rob-Vel]]'s ''[[Spirou (comics)|Spirou]]'' (1938).

==Popular forms==

===Speech bubbles===
The most common is the speech bubble. It comes in two forms for two circumstances: an in-panel character and an off-panel character. An in-panel character (one who is fully or mostly visible in the panel of the strip of comic that the reader is viewing) uses a bubble with a pointer, called a tail, directed towards the speaker.

When one character has multiple balloons within a panel, often only the balloon nearest to the speaker's head has a tail, and the others are connected to it in sequence by narrow bands. This style is often used in [[Mad Magazine]], due to its "[[call-and-response]]" dialogue-based humor.

An off-panel character (the comic book equivalent of being "off screen") has several options, some of them rather unconventional. The first is a standard speech bubble with a tail pointing toward the speaker's position. The second option, which originated in [[manga]], has the tail pointing ''into'' the bubble, instead of out. (This tail is still pointing towards the speaker.) The third option replaces the tail with a sort of bottleneck that connects with the side of the panel. It can be seen in the works of [[Marjane Satrapi]] (author of ''[[Persepolis (graphic novel)|Persepolis]]'').

In American &lt;!--- Is the description American necessary? Isn't this technique also used in manga, etc? ---&gt; comics, a bubble without a tail means that the speaker is not merely outside the reader's field of view but invisible to the [[point of view (literature)|viewpoint character]], often as an unspecified member of a crowd.

Characters distant (in space or time) from the scene of the panel can still speak, in squared bubbles without a tail; this usage, equivalent to [[voice-over]] in film, is not uncommon in American comics for dramatic contrast.  In contrast to captions, the corners of such balloons never coincide with those of the panel; for further distinction they often have a double outline, a different background color, or [[quotation mark]]s.

===Thought bubbles===
Thought bubbles come in two forms: the chain thought bubble and the "fuzzy" bubble.

The chain thought bubble is the almost universal symbol for thinking in cartoons. It consists of a large, [[cloud]]-like bubble containing the text of the thought, with a chain of increasingly smaller circular bubbles leading to the character. Some artists use an elliptical bubble instead of a cloud-shaped one.

Often animal characters like [[Snoopy]] and [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] "talk" using thought bubbles.  Thought bubbles may also be used in circumstances when a character is gagged or otherwise unable to speak.

Another, less conventional thought bubble has emerged: the "fuzzy" thought bubble. Used in manga (by such artists as [[Ken Akamatsu]]), the fuzzy bubble is roughly circular in shape (generally), but the edge of the bubble is not a line but a collection of spikes close to each other, creating the impression of fuzziness. Fuzzy thought bubbles do not use tails, and are placed near the character who is thinking. This has the advantage of reflecting the TV equivalent effect: something said with an echo.

Writers and artists can refuse to use thought bubbles, expressing the action through spoken dialogue and drawing; they are sometimes seen as an inefficient method of expressing thought because they are attached directly to the head of the thinker, unlike methods such as caption boxes, which can be used both as an expression of thought and narration while existing in an entirely different panel from the character thinking. However, they are restricted to the current viewpoint character. An example is [[Alan Moore]] and [[David Lloyd (comic artist)|David Lloyd]]'s ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', wherein during one chapter, a monologue expressed in captions serves not only to express the thoughts of a character but also the mood, status and actions of three others.

===Other forms===
The shape of a speech balloon can be used to convey further information. Common ones include the following:
*''Scream bubbles'' indicate a character is screaming or shouting, usually with a jagged outline or a thicker line which can be colored.  Their lettering is usually larger or bolder than normal.
*''Broadcast bubbles'' (also known as ''radio bubbles'') may have a jagged tail like the conventional drawing of a lightning flash and either a squared-off or jagged outline. Letters are sometimes italicised without also being bold. Broadcast bubbles indicate that the speaker is communicating through an electronic device, such as a radio or television, or is robotic.
*''Whisper bubbles'' are usually drawn with a dashed (dotted) outline, smaller font or gray lettering to indicate the tone is softer, as most speech is printed in black. &lt;BR&gt;Another form, sometimes encountered in manga, looks like an occidental thought bubble.
*''Icicle bubbles'' have jagged "icicles" on the lower edge, representing "cold" hostility.  
*''Monster bubbles'' have blood or slime dripping from them.
*''Colored bubbles'' can be used to convey the emotion that goes with the speech, such as red for anger or green for envy. This style is seldom used in modern comics. Alternatively (especially in online-published comics), colours can be used to provide an additional cue about who is speaking. Main characters often have individual thematic colours, and their speech bubbles are frequently tinted with their colour; especially in situations when there are no characters visible for speech bubbles to point to.

==Captions==
Captions are generally used for [[narration]] purposes, such as showing location and time, or conveying editorial commentary. They are generally rectangular and positioned near the edge of the panel. Often they are also colored to indicate the difference between themselves and the word balloons used by the characters, which are almost always white. Increasingly in modern comics, captions are frequently used to convey an internal monologue or typical speech.&lt;ref name=Piekos&gt;Piekos, Nate.

==Artist-specific variations==
[[Image:YellowKid.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Yellow Kid]]'s words appear on his shirt]]

Some characters and strips use highly unconventional methods of communication. Perhaps the most notable is the [[Yellow Kid]], an early [[United States|American]] [[comic strip]]. His (but not the other characters') words would appear on his large, smock-like shirt. A short-run [[Shirt Tales#TV series|American animated TV series of the early 1980s]] used this same concept, but with changing phrases on the "T-shirts" worn by the animal-based characters, depending on the characters' thoughts. 

Also noteworthy are the many variations on the form created by [[Dave Sim]] for his comic ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark]]''. Depending on the shape, size, and position of the bubble, as well as the texture and shape of the letters within it, Sim could convey large amounts of information about the speaker. This included separate bubbles for different states of mind (drunkenness, etc.), for echoes, and a special class of bubbles for one single floating apparition.

An early pioneer in experimenting with many different types of speech balloons and lettering for different types of speech was [[Walt Kelly]], in his ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' strip. Deacon Mushrat speaks in [[blackletter]], P.T. Bridgeport speaks in circus posters, Sarcophagus MacAbre speaks in condolence cards, "Mr. Pig" (a take on [[Nikita Khrushchev]]) speaks in [[faux Cyrillic]], etc.

In the famous French comic series ''[[Asterix]]'', [[René Goscinny|Goscinny]] and [[Albert Uderzo|Uderzo]] use bubbles without tails to indicate a distant or unseen speaker. They have also experimented with using different types of lettering for characters of different nationalities to indicate they speak a different language that Asterix may not understand; Goths speak in [[blackletter]], Greeks in angular lettering (though always understood by the Gaulish main characters, so it is more of an accent than a language), Norse with "Nørdic åccents", Egyptians in faux [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] (depictive illustrations and rebuses), etc. Another experiment with speech bubbles was exclusive to one book, ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]''. The agent in question is a vile manipulator who creates discord in a group of people with a single innocent-sounding comment. His victims start quarreling and ultimately fighting each other while speaking in green-colored speech bubbles.

Font variation is a common tactic in comics. ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' series, written by [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Letterer|lettered]] by [[Todd Klein]], features many characters whose speech bubbles are written with a font that is exclusive to them. For examples, the main character, the gloomy [[Dream (DC Comics)|Dream]], speaks in wavy-edged bubbles, completely black, with similarly wavy white lettering. His sister, the scatterbrained and whimsical [[Delirium (DC Comics)|Delirium]] speaks in bubbles in a many-colored explosive background with uneven lettering, and the irreverent raven [[Characters of The Sandman#Matthew|Matthew]] speaks in a shaky angular kind of bubble with scratchy lettering. Other characters, such as John Dee, have special shapes of bubbles for their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/07/comics-you-should-own-sandman/|title= Comics You Should Own – ''Sandman''|first= Greg|last= Burgas|date= January 7, 2013|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140410022316/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/07/comics-you-should-own-sandman/|archivedate= April 10, 2014|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'''s recurring ''[[Monroe (comic strip)|Monroe]]'' comic strip, certain words are written larger or in unusual fonts for emphasis.

In [[manga]], there is a tendency to include the speech necessary for the storyline in balloons, while small scribbles outside the balloons add side comments, often used for irony or to show that they're said in a much smaller voice.  [[Characters of Negima (16-31)#Satsuki Yotsuba|Satsuki Yotsuba]] in the manga series [[Negima]] is notable because she speaks almost ''entirely'' in side scribble.

==Graphic symbols==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
Speech bubbles are used not only to include a character's words, but also emotions, voice inflections and unspecified language.

===Punctuation marks===
One of the universal emblems of the art of comics is the use of a single punctuation mark to depict a character's emotions, much more efficiently than any possible sentence. A speech bubble with a single big [[question mark]] (?) (often drawn by hand, not counted as part of the lettering) denotes confusion or ignorance. An [[exclamation mark]] (!) indicates surprise or terror. This device is broadly used in the European comic tradition, the Belgian artist [[Hergé]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' series being a good example. Sometimes, the punctuation marks stand alone above the character's head, with no bubble needed.

In [[manga]], the [[ellipsis]] (i.e. three dots) is also used to express silence in a much more significant way than the mere absence of bubbles. This is specially seen when a character is supposed to say something, to indicate a stunned silence or when a sarcastic comment is expected by the reader. The ellipsis, along with the big drop of sweat on the character's temple—usually depicting shame, confusion, or embarrassment caused by other people's actions—is one of the [[Japan]]ese graphic symbols that have taken root in comics all around the world, although they are still rare in Western tradition.  Japanese even has a sound effect for "deafening silence", {{nihongo|''shiin''|シーン|}}.

===Foreign languages===
In many comic books, words that would be foreign to the narration but are displayed in translation for the reader are surrounded by [[Brackets|angle brackets]] or chevrons {{angbr|like this}}.

[[Gilbert Hernandez]]'s series about [[Love and Rockets (comics)|Palomar]] is written in English, but supposed to take place mainly in a [[Hispanic]] country. Thus, what's supposed to be representations of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speech is written without brackets, but occasional actual English speech is written within brackets, to indicate that it is unintelligible to the main [[Hispanophone]] characters in the series.

Some comics will have the actual foreign language in the speech balloon, with the translation as a footnote; this is done with Latin aphorisms in ''Asterix''.

Another convention is to put the foreign speech in a distinctive lettering style; for example, [[Asterix and the Goths|''Asterix''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Goths]] speak in [[blackletter]].

Since the Japanese language uses [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|two writing directionalities]] (vertical, which is the traditional direction; and horizontal, as most other languages), manga has a convention of representing translated foreign speech as horizontal text.

===The big Z===
It is a convention in [[United States|American]] comics that the sound of a snore is represented as a series of Z's, dating back at least to [[Rudolph Dirks]]' early 20th-century strip ''[[The Katzenjammer Kids]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Cecil. [http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/42997/why-does-z-stand-for-snoring-and-how-do-other/ "The Straight Dope: Why Does Z Stand for Snoring? And how do other languages represent the sound?,"] ''Washington City Paper'' (July 27, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has even been reduced to a single letter Z, so that a speech bubble with this letter standing all alone (again, drawn by hand rather than a font type) means the character is sleeping in most humorous comics. This can be seen, for instance, in [[Charles Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strips.

Originally, the resemblance between the 'z' sound and that of a snore seemed exclusive to the [[English language]], but the spread of American comics has made it a frequent feature in other countries.  An exception to this is in Japanese manga, where the usual symbol for sleep is a large bubble coming out of the character's nose.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, Megan. [https://www.wired.com/2015/05/using-emoji-wrong/ "WE’RE ALL USING THESE EMOJI WRONG,"] ''Wired'' (05.21.15).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drawings within the speech bubble===
Singing characters usually have [[musical note]]s drawn into their word balloons. [[Archie Comics]]' [[Melody Valentine]], a character in their ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (comic)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' comic, has musical notes drawn into her word balloons at all times, to convey that she speaks in a sing-song voice.

The above-mentioned Albert Uderzo in the ''Asterix'' series decorates speech bubbles with beautiful flowers depicting an extremely soft, sweet voice (usually  preceding a violent outburst by the same character).

A stormy cloud with a rough lightning sticking out of it, either in a bubble or just floating above the character's head as a modified 'cloudy' thought bubble, depicts anger, not always verbally expressed.

[[Light bulbs]] are sometimes used when the character comes up with an idea or solution to a problem.

In the Western world, it is common to replace profanity with a string of nonsense symbols (&amp;%$@*$#), sometimes called [[The Lexicon of Comicana|grawlixes]]. In comics that are usually addressed to children or teenagers, bad language is [[censorship|censored]] by replacing it with more or less elaborate drawings and expressionistic symbols. For example, instead of calling someone a swine, a pig is drawn in the speech bubble.

One example is the [[Spain|Spanish]] ''[[Mortadelo]]'' series, created by [[Francisco Ibáñez Talavera|Francisco Ibáñez]]. Although not specifically addressed to children, ''Mortadelo'' was born during [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[dictatorship]], when censorship was the order of the day and the slightest attempt of rough language was prohibited. When Ibáñez's characters are angry, donkey heads, lightning, lavatories, billy goats and even faux Japanese characters are often seen in their bubbles.

When ''Mortadelo'' was portrayed on film by Spanish director [[Javier Fesser]] in 2003, one of the critiques made to his otherwise successful adaptation was the character's use of words that never appeared in the comics. Fesser claimed: "When you see a bubble speech containing a lightning falling on a pig, what do you imagine the character's saying?"

==Order==
In order for comic strip and graphic novel dialogue to make sense, it has to be read in order. Thus, conventions have evolved in the order in which the communication bubbles are read. The individual bubbles are read in the order of the language. For example, in [[English language|English]], the bubbles are read from left to right in a panel, while in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], it is the other way around. Sometimes the bubbles are "stacked", with two characters having multiple bubbles, one above the other. Such stacks are read from the top down. Poor use of speech balloons can unintentionally make the proper reading order ambiguous, confusing the reader.

==Lettering==
Traditionally, a cartoonist or occupational [[letterer]] would draw in all the individual letters in the balloons and sound effects by hand.  A modern alternative, used by most comics today and universal in English-translated manga, is to letter with computer programs.  The [[font]]s used usually emulate the style of hand-lettering.

Traditionally, most mainstream comic books are lettered entirely in [[upper-case]], with a few exceptions:
* Name particles such as ''de'' and ''von'', and the "c" in a [[surname]] of Scottish or Irish origin starting with ''Mc''
* To indicate a frightened or quiet manner of speech
* An interjection such as "er", "um", etc.

When hand-lettering, upper-case lettering saves time and effort because it requires drawing only three guidelines, while mixed-case lettering requires five.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;Bradley, Drew. [http://multiversitycomics.com/columns/looking-at-lettering-caps-vs-mixed-case/ "Looking at Lettering: CAPS vs Mixed Case,"] ''Multiversity Comics'' (April 22, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a few comics, uppercase and lowercase are used as in ordinary writing.  Since the mid-1980s, [[mixed case]] lettering has gradually become more widely used in mainstream books. Some comics, such as ''[[Pearls Before Swine (comics)|Pearls Before Swine]]'', also use lowercase speech to mark a distinctive accent (in this case, the male crocodiles’ accented speech, opposed to all other characters who use standard uppercase speech).

From 2002–2004, [[Marvel Comics]] experimented with mixed-case lettering in all its books.&lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt; Most mainstream titles have since returned to traditional all upper-case lettering.

In many comics, although the lettering is entirely in capital letters, [[serif]] versions of "I" are used exclusively where a capital I would appear in normal print text, and a [[sanserif]] (i.e., a simple vertical line) is used in all other places. This reduces confusion with the number one, and also serves to indicate when the personal pronoun "I" is meant. This lettering convention can be seen in computer fonts such as [[Blambot]]'s "DigitalStrip.ttf" and "AnimeAce.ttf" fonts, which make no other distinction between lower- and uppercase letters.

==Substance of balloons==
In several occasions, comics artists have used balloons (or similar narrative devices) as if they have true substance, usually for humorous [[meta-]]like purposes. In ''[[Peanuts]]'', for example, the notes played by [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]] occasionally take substance and are used in various ways, including Christmas decorations or perches for birds. Sometimes balloons can be influenced by the strip's environment: in the Italian strip ''[[Sturmtruppen]]'' they freeze and crack when the temperature is very low, or an [[Archie (comics)|Archie]] comic strip where two men from Alaska remarked on how cold it was, by saying the speech balloons froze as they said them, and the words had to be thawed out to be heard.

In the Flemish ''[[Suske en Wiske]]'' series, on one occasion a thought bubble full of mathematical formulas is cut open with scissors and its contents emptied in a bag, to be saved for later (in a manner not unlike the [[pensieve]] in the [[Harry Potter]] series). In the same series, speech balloons are occasionally even held and blown up to function as actual balloons or the words of the speech bubble are occasionally shown coming out the side of the speech bubble, to signify that the speaker is moving so fast that their words can't keep up with them, i.e. at [[supersonic]] speed.

In the novel ''[[Who Censored Roger Rabbit?]]'', the last words of a murdered Toon (cartoon character) are found under his body in the form of a speech balloon.

==Computer-generated speech balloons==
Many digital artists generate speech balloons with [[List of vector graphics editors|general-purpose illustration software]].  Products like [[Comic Book Creator]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Comic Life]] for [[Mac OS X]] and Windows target the non-professional end of the market.

The '''Swedish Institute''' ({{lang-sv|Svenska Institutet}}, {{lang|sv|'''SI'''}}) is a  [[Government agencies in Sweden|Government agency in Sweden]] with the responsibility to spread information about [[Sweden]] outside the country. It exists to promote Swedish interests, and to organise exchanges with other countries in different areas of public life, in particular in the spheres of [[culture]], [[education]], and [[research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Spotlight On: American Swedish Institute  |work= [[CBS]]|date=|url= http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/02/27/spotlight-on-american-swedish-institute/|accessdate=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main office of the Swedish Institute is located in [[Gamla stan]] in central [[Stockholm]]. There is also a branch abroad; the [[Swedish Cultural Centre in Paris]] ({{lang-fr|Centre Culturel Suédois}}). The agency has approximately 90 members of staff and its board is appointed by the [[Government of Sweden]].

In early 2007 the Swedish Institute stated it was planning to set up an "embassy", the "House of Sweden", in [[Second Life]], an Internet-based virtual world. This virtual office is not intended to provide passports or visas, but serve as a point of information about Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{refimprove|date=December 2011}}
A '''taua''' is a war party in the tradition of the [[Māori people|Maori]], the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] people of [[New Zealand]]. Contemporary knowledge of taua is gleaned from missionary observations and writings during the [[Musket Wars]] of the early 19th century and the later [[New Zealand wars]]. The reason to engage gather a taua may be for reasons of seeking revenge ([[Utu (Māori concept)|utu]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/h/he-hinatore-ki-te-ao-maori-a-glimpse-into-the-maori-world/part-1-traditional-maori-concepts/utu/ ''"Traditional Maori Concepts, Utu"'' Ministry of Justice website]&lt;/ref&gt; or seeking compensation for an offence against an individual, community or society (muru).&lt;ref name="justice.govt.nz"&gt;[http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/publications-archived/2001/he-hinatore-ki-te-ao-maori-a-glimpse-into-the-maori-world/part-1-traditional-maori-concepts/muru ''"Traditional Maori Concepts, Muru"'' Ministry of Justice website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
A taua was typically composed of [[males]], although there were occasions when [[women]] fought as well. The party was led by a chief ([[rangatira]]), and would be made up of around 70 [[warrior]]s. This number was the general capacity of a “[[waka taua]]” (a war canoe), however sometimes waka would be designed to carry up to 140 warriors, and such canoes were called "Te Hokwhitu a Tu". During the height of the musket wars the number of warriors rose to about 2,000 and the group travelled mainly on foot around the [[North Island]] coast.

The most comprehensive written account of a war expedition was written by missionary [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]].&lt;ref name="CARv1p2"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Carleton |first1=Hugh |authorlink1= |title= The Life of Henry Williams|url= |format= |accessdate=  |year= 1874 |publisher= [[Early New Zealand Books]] (ENZB),  University of Auckland Library|location= |language= |isbn= |oclc=  |doi= |id= |page= |pages=106–126|chapter= Vol. I |chapterurl=http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document?wid=1042&amp;page=0&amp;action=null|quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This heke was a consequence of the so-called [[Girls’ War]], which was a fight that occurred on the beach at [[Kororareka]], [[Bay of Islands]] in March 1830 between northern and southern [[hapū]] within the [[Ngāpuhi]] [[iwi]].

==Muru==
Muru is the negative or revenge side of the Maori cultural practice of utu, carried out by taua, which can be either positive or negative. It was within Māori traditions for a taua to conduct  muru against hapu who had no involvement in the events that caused the death of the chief.&lt;ref name="CARv1p1"/&gt; Often muru was preceded by a tribal or hapu discussion as to what action should take place. Normally muru was an act by taua  to balance  an act of violence or theft. In the early days of European settlers muru was practiced against settlers who had transgressed against Maori lore. Often settlers were bewildered by apparent random thefts or acts of violence. Sometimes, especially in the north, chiefs would intercede to give a cultural explanation to settlers  and arrange a suitable payment of goods in compensation. In Maori society it was accepted that muru could be carried out against strangers. This had the appearance of arbitrary attacks on innocent parties. This led to a direct conflict with New Zealand law where only the guilty could be punished. In 1847 in Whanganui a Maori chief was accidentally shot in the face on a ship. He accepted that his wound was an accident. His wound was tended to by a doctor and the man recovered but a taua decided to take muru for the accident by attacking a local farmer /artist. He escaped,  but the taua killed four members of the family and wounded two more. When five of the taua were caught by Maori  the taua were found to be 14 and 19 year olds. All, apart from the 14 year old were found guilty of murder and hanged. The 14 year old was banished.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Strategy==
Taua would typically restrict their activity to the fighting season, between late November and early April, when food and fishing was plentiful. During the height of the musket wars Taua were away from their turangawaiwai for up to a year. By 1830 they were no longer dependent on traditional crops such as [[Sweet potato|kumara]] which only grew well in the north most part of North Island, the [[Iwi]] now grew large quantities of more easily grown potatoes.

The taua would usually attack at [[dawn]] in the form of an ambush or a surprise raid. Their intimate knowledge of New Zealand’s natural environment enabled them to appear and disappear swiftly and noiselessly and successfully complete their mission. As Maori at the time were strongly committed to the idea of "[[Utu (Māori concept)|utu]]" (revenge), the aim would be to kill all members of the enemy war party and leave no survivors. There were, however, occasions when warring taua would come to a truce. This would be typically settled through the arrangement of an intertribal marriage.

==Customs==
The [[haka]] was a central feature to the life and culture of each taua. Other customs and rites included abstinence of certain foods and practices, dedication to [[Tumatauenga]], the god of war, and rites that would place a "[[tapu (Polynesian culture)#In Māori tradition|tapu]]" around the warrior, and lift the tapu when the warrior returned home. It was customary to eat the vanquished or to take slaves which could be eaten later or used as slave labour. Heads of defeated chiefs were kept as trophies and displayed on [[palisade]]s of the home ''[[Pā (Māori)|pa]]''.

==''Taua'' film==
''Taua'' (aka ''War Party'') is a 2007 short film written and directed by [[Te Arepa Kahi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzfilm.co.nz/film/taua-war-party ''Taua'' (''War Party'')]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tupelo Press''' is an American not-for-profit literary press founded in 1999. It produced its first titles in 2001, publishing poetry, fiction and non-fiction. Originally located in Dorset, Vermont, the press has since moved to [[North Adams, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pw.org/content/small_press_points_30 ''Poets &amp; Writers'' &gt; ''Small Press Points'' &gt; ''News and Trends'' by Kevin Larimer &gt; March 01, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newshare.typepad.com/greylocknews/2009/04/inkberry-and-papyri-books-present-wordplay-featuring-poets-of-tupelo-press.html''greylocknews''  &gt; April 2, 2009 &gt; North Adams, MA]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Turkestan.png|thumb|385px|Map of Turkestan with modern state borders. The area covers a large number of countries including: [[Russia]] ([[Tatarstan]] and parts of [[Siberia]]), [[Mongolia]], parts of the [[China|Chinese]] autonomous province of [[Xinjiang]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and parts of [[Afghanistan]].]]
[[Image:Kashgari map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map from [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]]'s [[Dīwān ul-Lughat al-Turk]], showing the 11th century distribution of Turkic tribes]]'''Turkestan''', also spelt '''Turkistan''' (literally "Land of the Turks" in [[Persian language|Persian]]), refers to an area in [[Central Asia]] between [[Siberia]] to the north and [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Kashmir]], and [[Tibet]] to the south, the [[Caspian Sea]] to the west and the [[Gobi Desert]] to the east. 

==Etymology and terminology==
Of [[Persian language|Persian]] origin (see [[-stan]]), the term "Turkestan" (ترکستان) has never referred to a single [[national state]].&lt;ref name="Clewell"&gt;Gladys D. Clewell, Holland Thompson, ''Lands and Peoples: The world in color'', Volume 3, page 163. Excerpt: Never a single nation, the name Turkestan means simply the place of [[Turkish peoples]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iran|Iranian]] [[geographer]]s first used the word to describe the place of [[Turkic peoples]].&lt;ref name="CARC"&gt;Central Asian review by Central Asian Research Centre (London, England), St. Antony's College (University of Oxford). ''Soviet Affairs Study Group'', Volume 16, page 3. Excerpt: The name Turkestan is of Persian origin and was apparently first used by Persian geographers to describe "the country of the Turks". The [[Russian Empire]] revived the word as a convenient name for the governorate-general established in 1867 ({{lang-ru| Туркестанское генерал-губернаторство}}); the terms [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], etc., came into use only after 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Turkestan" was used{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} to describe any place where Turkic peoples lived.&lt;ref name="Clewell" /&gt;

On their way southward during the conquest of [[Central Asia]] in the course of the 19th century, the [[Imperial Russia|Russians]] under {{ill|Nikolai Aleksandrovich Veryovkin|ru|Верёвкин, Николай Александрович}} took the [[Turkestan (city)|city of Turkistan]] (in present-day [[Kazakhstan]]) in 1864. Mistaking its name for that of the entire region, they adopted the name of "Turkestan" ({{lang-ru|Туркестан}}) for [[Russian Turkestan|their new territory]].&lt;ref name="CARC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annette M. B. Meakin, ''In Russian Turkestan: a garden of Asia and its people'', page 44. Excerpt: On their way southward from [[Siberia]] in 1864, the Russians took it, and many writers affirm that, mistaking its name for that of the entire region, they adopted the appellation of "Turkestan" for their new territory. Up to that time, they assure us [[Khanate]]s of [[Bokhara]], [[Khiva]] and [[Kokand]] were known by these names alone.&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{As of | 2015}}, the term labels a region in [[Central Asia]] which is inhabited mainly by Turkic peoples, but the regions also contained peoples who were not Turkic, such as the Tajiks, and excluded some who were. It includes present-day [[Turkmenistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and parts of [[Xinjiang]] (also known as [[East Turkestan]]). Often, the Turkic regions of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Russia]] ([[Tatarstan]] and parts of [[Siberia]]) are included as well.

==History==
{{further|History of Central Asia}}
[[File:Geschichte des Kostüms (1905) (14580617778).jpg|thumb|upright|People of Turkestan]]
The history of Turkestan dates back to at least the [[3rd millennium BC|third]] millennium BC. Many [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] were produced in that period, and much [[trade]] was conducted. The region was a focal point for [[cultural diffusion]], as the [[Silk Road]] traversed it. Turkestan covers the area of [[Central Asia]] and acquired its "Turkic" character from the 4th to 6th centuries AD with the incipient [[Turkic expansion]].

Turkic sagas, such as the ''[[Ergenekon]]'' legend, and written sources such as the [[Orkhon Inscriptions]] state that Turkic peoples originated in the nearby [[Altai Mountains]], and, through nomadic settlement, started their long journey westwards. [[Huns]] conquered the area after they conquered [[Kashgaria]] in the early 2nd century BC. With the dissolution of the Huns' empire, [[China|Chinese]] rulers took over Eastern Turkestan. [[Arab]] forces captured it in the 8th century. The [[Persian Empire|Persian]] [[Samanid]] dynasty subsequently conquered it and the area experienced economic success.&lt;ref name="Turkistan_EB2007"&gt;"Turkistan", ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] 2007 Ultimate Reference Suite.''&lt;/ref&gt; The entire territory was held at various times by Turkic forces, such as the [[Göktürks]] until the conquest by [[Genghis Khan]] and the [[Mongols]] in 1220.  Genghis Khan gave the territory to his son, [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]] and the area became the [[Chagatai Khanate]].&lt;ref name="Turkistan_EB2007"/&gt; [[Timur]] took over the western portion of Turkestan in 1369 and the area became part of the [[Timurid Empire]].&lt;ref name="Turkistan_EB2007"/&gt;  The eastern portion of Turkestan was also called Mogulistan, and continued to be ruled by descendants of Genghis Khan.

==Overview==
[[File:Bandera del Turquestan.svg|thumb|Flag of Turkestan]]
Known as [[Turan]] to the Persians, western Turkestan has also been known historically as [[Sogdiana]], ''Ma wara'u'n-nahr'' (by its [[Arab]] conquerors), and [[Transoxiana]] by Western travellers. The latter two names refer to its position beyond the River [[Oxus]] when approached from the south, emphasizing Turkestan's long-standing relationship with [[Iran]], the [[Persian Empire]]s and the [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid]] [[Caliphate]]s.

Turkestan is roughly within the regions of [[Central Asia]] lying between [[Siberia]] on the north; [[Tibet]], [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iran]] on the south; the [[Gobi Desert]] on the east; and the [[Caspian Sea]] on the west.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/610093/Turkistan Encyclopadea Britannica. Turkistan retrieved-18 march,2010]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oghuz Turks]] (also known as [[Turkmens]]), [[Uzbeks]], [[Kazakhs]], [[Khazars]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], [[Hazara people|Hazara]] and [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] are some of the Turkic inhabitants of the region who, as history progressed, have spread further into Eurasia forming such Turkic nations as [[Turkey]] and [[Azerbaijan]], and subnational regions like [[Tatarstan]] in [[Russia]] and [[Crimea]] in [[Ukraine]]. [[Tājik people|Tajiks]] and [[Russian people|Russians]] form sizable non-Turkic minorities.

It is subdivided into [[Afghan Turkestan]] and [[Russian Turkestan]] in the West, and [[Xinjiang]] in the East.

===Chinese influence===
[[File:Turkestani Restaurant.JPG|thumb|Restaurant of a Uyghur [[expatriate|expat]] in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]]]
A summary of Classical sources, largely [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Ptolemy]], on the [[Serica|Seres]], the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name of China, gives the following account:

{{quotation|The region of the Seres is a vast and populous country, touching on the east the Ocean and the limits of the habitable world, and extending west nearly to [[Pamir Mountains|Imaus]] and the confines of [[Bactria]]. The people are civilised men, of mild, just, and frugal temper, eschewing collisions with their neighbours, and even shy of close [conversation], but not averse to dispose of their own products, of which raw [[silk]] is the staple, but which include also silk stuffs, [[fur]]s, and [[iron]] of remarkable quality.|[[Henry Yule]], ''Cathay and the Way Thither''}}

In the Persian epic [[Shahnameh]], China and Turkestan are regarded as the same, and the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of Turkestan is called the Khan of Chin.&lt;ref name="Pavry2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bapsy Pavry|title=The Heroines of Ancient Persia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CaVEBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=gurdya+china&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMIoMGumr33xwIVxfI-Ch2QlgY2#v=onepage&amp;q=gurdya%20china&amp;f=false|date=19 February 2015|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-1-107-48744-4|pages=86–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Winchester1930"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bapsy Pavry Paulet, Marchioness of Winchester|title=The Heroines of Ancient Persia: Stories Retold from the Shāhnāma of Firdausi.

Muslim writers like Marwazī wrote that [[Transoxania]] was a former part of China, retaining the legacy of [[Tang Dynasty]]'s rule over Transoxania:

{{quotation|In ancient times all the districts of Transoxania had belonged to the kingdom of China [Ṣīn], with the district of Samarqand as its centre. When Islam appeared and God delivered the said district to the Muslims, the Chinese migrated to their [original] centers, but there remained in Samarqand, as a vestige of them, the art of making paper of high quality. And when they migrated to Eastern parts their lands became disjoined and their provinces divided, and there was a king in China and a king in Qitai and a king in Yugur.|Marwazī}}

Muslim writers viewed the [[Khitai]], the [[Gansu]] [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] kingdom and [[Kashgar]] as all part of "China" culturally and geographically, with the Muslims in Central Asia retaining the legacy of Chinese rule in Central Asia by using titles such as "Khan of China" (تمغاج خان) (Tamghaj Khan or Tawgach) in [[Turkic language|Turkic]] and "the King of the East in China" (ملك المشرق (أو الشرق) والصين) (malik al-mashriq (or al-sharq) wa'l-ṣīn) in Arabic, which were titles of the Muslim [[Qarakhanid]] rulers and their [[Karluks|Qarluq]] ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michal Biran|title=The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History: Between China and the Islamic World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B934LaVBaz8C&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=15 September 2005|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-84226-6|pages=99–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schluessel    |first=Eric T. |last2= |first2= |date=2014  |title=The World as Seen from Yarkand: Ghulām Muḥammad Khān’s 1920s Chronicle Mā Tīṭayniŋ wā  qiʿasi |url=http://www.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tokyo-ias/nihu/publications/cers09/cers09_fulltext.pdf |journal= |publisher=NIHU Program Islamic Area Studies |volume= |number=9|series=TIAS Central Eurasian Research Series|isbn=978-4-904039-83-0|page=13 |doi= |access-date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title Malik al-Mashriq wa'l-Ṣīn was bestowed by the [[Abbasid Caliph|'Abbāsid Caliph]] upon the Tamghaj Khan, the Samarqand Khaqan Yūsuf b. Ḥasan. Afterwards, coins and literature had the title Tamghaj Khan appear on them, which continued to be used by the Qarakhanids, the Transoxania-based Western Qarakhanids and some Eastern Qarakhanid monarchs. Therefore, the Kara-Khitan (Western Liao)'s usage of Chinese things such as [[Chinese coins]], the [[Chinese writing system]], tablets, [[seal (emblem)|seals]], [[Chinese art]] and other items from [[Chinese culture]] such as [[porcelein]], [[mirror]]s, and [[jade]] was designed to appeal to the local Central Asian Muslim population, since the Muslims in the area regarded Central Asia as former Chinese territories and viewed connections with China as prestigious. Western Liao's rule over Muslim Central Asia reinforced these Muslims' view that Central Asia was a Chinese territory. For example, Turkestan and Chīn (China) were identified with each other by Fakhr al-Dīn Mubārak Shāh, with China being identified as the country where the cities of Balāsāghūn and Kashghar were located.&lt;ref name=BiranP102&gt;{{cite book|author=Michal Biran|title=The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History: Between China and the Islamic World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B934LaVBaz8C&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=15 September 2005|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-84226-6|pages=102–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liao Chinese traditions and the Qara Khitai's clinging helped the Qara Khitai avoid Islamization and conversion to Islam. The Qara Khitai used Chinese and Central Asian features in their administrative system.&lt;ref name=BiranP102 /&gt;

Although in modern [[Urdu]] Chin means China, Chin referred to Central Asia in [[Muhammad Iqbal]]'s time, which is why Iqbal wrote that "Chin is ours" (referring to the Muslims) in his song [[Tarana-e-Milli]].&lt;ref&gt;Although "Chin" refers to China in modern [[Urdu]], in Iqbal's day it referred to Central Asia, coextensive with historical Turkestan.

The Tang Chinese reign over Qocho and Turfan and the Buddhist religion left a lasting legacy upon the Buddhist Uyghur [[Kingdom of Qocho]] with the Tang presented names remaining on the more than 50 Buddhist temples with Emperor Tang Taizong's edicts stored in the "Imperial Writings Tower " and Chinese dictionaries like Jingyun, Yuian, Tang yun, and da zang jing (Buddhist scriptures) stored inside the Buddhist temples and Persian monks also maintained a Manichaean temple in the Kingdom., the Persian Hudud al-'Alam uses the name "Chinese town" to call Qocho, the capital of the Uyghur kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James A.

The Turfan Buddhist Uighurs of the Kingdom of Qocho continued to produce the Chinese [[Qieyun]] rime dictionary and developed their own pronunciations of Chinese characters, left over from the Tang influence over the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=TAKATA|first= Tokio   |last2= |first2= |date= |title=The Chinese Language in Turfan with a special focus on the Qieyun fragments |url=http://www.zinbun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~takata/BerlinQieyun.pdf |journal= |publisher=Institute for Research in Humanities, [[Kyoto University]] |volume= |issue= |pages=7–9 |doi= |access-date=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern Uyghur [[linguist]] Abdurishid Yakup pointed out that the Turfan Uyghur [[Buddhists]] studied the [[Chinese language]] and had Chinese books such as [[Qianziwen]] (the thousand character classic) and Qieyun *(a rhyme dictionary) and it was written that "In Qocho city were more than fifty monasteries, all titles of which are granted by the emperors of the Tang dynasty, which keep many Buddhist texts as [[Tripitaka]], Tangyun, Yupuan, Jingyin etc."&lt;ref name="Yakup2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Abdurishid Yakup|title=The Turfan Dialect of Uyghur|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dk12I01qTPUC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=Turfan+chinese+speaking&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ihYwVKzzJpD8sATb_IDgDg&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Turfan%20chinese%20speaking&amp;f=false|year=2005|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-05233-7|pages=180–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Central Asia the Uighurs viewed the Chinese script as "very prestigious" so when they developed the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]], based on the Syriac script, they deliberately switched it to vertical like Chinese writing from its original horizontal position in Syriac.&lt;ref name="Gorelova2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Liliya M.

The last major victory of Arabs in Central Asia occurred at the [[Battle of Talas]] (751). The [[Tibetan Empire]] was allied to the Arabs during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jvsVSqhw-FAC&amp;pg=PA286#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Bulliet &amp; Crossley &amp; Headrick &amp; Hirsch &amp; Johnson 2010, p. 286.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AguuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA286#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Bulliet 2010, p. 286.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_ahBEjHRnBcC&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Chaliand 2004, p. 31.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wink 2002, p. 68"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uQ7k2vQlYxEC&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Wink 2002, p. 68.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wink 1997, p. 68"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=75FlxDhZWpwC&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Wink 1997, p. 68.]&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Arabs did not proceed to Xinjiang at all, the battle was of no importance strategically, and it was An Lushan's rebellion which ended up forcing the Tang Chinese out of Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GXj4a3gss8wC&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ed.

Barthold states that the Islamic rule over Transoxiana was secured at the Battle of Talas. Turks had to wait two and a half centuries before reconquering Transoxiana when the [[Karakhanids]] reconquered the city of Bukhara in 999. Professor [[Denis Sinor]] said that it was interference in the internal affairs of the [[Western Turkic Khaganate]] which ended Chinese supremacy in Central Asia, since the destruction of the Western Khaganate rid the Muslims of their greatest opponent, and it was not the Battle of Talas which ended the Chinese presence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ST6TRNuWmHsC&amp;pg=PA344&amp;dq=Indeed,+the+Talas+battle+in+75+1+in+which+the+Muslims+aided+by+the+Turkic+Karluks+stopped+the+Chinese+and+their+Turkic+allies+was+not,+as+Gibb+noted+,'+the+deathblow+to+Chinese+imperial+traditions+in+Western+Central+Asia.+Rather,+it+was+China's+meddling+in+the+murky+politics+of+the+Western+Turk+Kaghanate,+a+policy+that+contributed+to+the+latter's+destruction+and+thereby+removed+the+only+serious+opposition+the+Muslims+faced.+The+Arabs,+however,+did+not+seek+to+establish+themselves+deep+in+the+steppe.+Instead,+they+retired+to+the+ribats+(border+forts),+oasis+city-states+and+rich,+urban+trappings+of+the+Khorasanian+towns.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8mFkU8zyJ67jsASwjYGQCQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Indeed%2C%20the%20Talas%20battle%20in%2075%201%20in%20which%20the%20Muslims%20aided%20by%20the%20Turkic%20Karluks%20stopped%20the%20Chinese%20and%20their%20Turkic%20allies%20was%20not%2C%20as%20Gibb%20noted%20%2C'%20the%20deathblow%20to%20Chinese%20imperial%20traditions%20in%20Western%20Central%20Asia.%20Rather%2C%20it%20was%20China's%20meddling%20in%20the%20murky%20politics%20of%20the%20Western%20Turk%20Kaghanate%2C%20a%20policy%20that%20contributed%20to%20the%20latter's%20destruction%20and%20thereby%20removed%20the%20only%20serious%20opposition%20the%20Muslims%20faced.%20The%20Arabs%2C%20however%2C%20did%20not%20seek%20to%20establish%20themselves%20deep%20in%20the%20steppe.%20Instead%2C%20they%20retired%20to%20the%20ribats%20(border%20forts)%2C%20oasis%20city-states%20and%20rich%2C%20urban%20trappings%20of%20the%20Khorasanian%20towns.&amp;f=false Sinor 1990, p. 344.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Voulez-vous coucher avec God?''''' ("Do you want to sleep with God?") is a 1972 Canadian [[experimental film]] directed by Jack Christie and [[Michael Hirsh (producer)|Michael Hirsh]].  Combining live-action and animation, the film is heavily steeped in late 1960s - early 1970s [[counterculture]] and features of a soundtrack of popular music from the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iffr.com/en/films/voulez-vous-coucher-avec-god/ |title=Voulez-vous coucher avec God? - IFFR.COM - International Film Festival Rotterdam 2015 |publisher=IFFR |date= |accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It tells the story of a bigoted and war-crazed [[God]], portrayed by [[Tuli Kupferberg]], who sends an angel down to Earth to become [[President of the United States]], leading to chaos.

==Reception==
''Voulez-vous coucher avec God?'' was reviewed positively by [[J.

'''Vulgar Latin''' or '''Sermo Vulgaris''' ("common speech"), also '''Colloquial Latin''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=98|title=The Romance Languages|first=Rebecca|last=Posner|location=Cambridge, New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Common Romance''' (particularly in the late stage), was a range of [[Standard language|non-standard]] [[sociolect]]s of [[Latin]] (as opposed to [[Classical Latin]], the standard and literary version of the language) spoken in the [[Mediterranean basin|Mediterranean region]] during and after the classical period of the [[Roman Empire]].

The [[Romance languages]], such as [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] were all derived from Vulgar Latin. Compared to [[Classical Latin]], Vulgar Latin is less standardized and was spoken as a living language until the 8th century.

Works written in Latin during classical times and the earlier Middle Ages used [[Linguistic prescription|prescribed]] [[Classical Latin]] rather than Vulgar Latin, with very few exceptions (most notably sections of [[Petronius|Gaius Petronius]]' ''[[Satyricon]]''), thus Vulgar Latin had no official [[orthography]] of its own. In [[Renaissance Latin]], Vulgar Latin was called ''vulgare Latinum'' or ''Latinum vulgare.''{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

By its nature Vulgar Latin varied greatly by region and by time period, though several major divisions can be seen. Vulgar Latin dialects began to significantly diverge from Classical Latin by the third century during the classical period of the Roman Empire. Nevertheless, throughout the sixth century the most widely spoken dialects were still similar to and mostly mutually intelligible with Classical Latin. {{quote|The verb system [...] seems to have remained virtually intact throughout the fifth century [...] the transformation of the language, from structures we call Latin into structures we call Romance, lasted from the third or fourth century until the eighth, "So its history came to an end – or to put it another way, the language becomes a "dead" language – when it stops functioning in this way and is no longer anybody's natural mother tongue," In Gaul from the mid-eighth century many people were not able to understand even the most straightforward religious texts read to them in Latin. In Italy the first signs that people were aware of the difference between the everyday language they spoke and the written form is in the mid-tenth century. The period of most rapid change occurred from the second half of the seventh century. Until then the spoken and written form (though with many vulgar features) were regarded as one language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herman|first=József|year=2000|title=Vulgar Latin|first2=Roger (Translator)|last2=Wright|location=University Park|publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University Press]]|isbn=0-271-02001-6|pages=96–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Latin changed from being a "living natural mother tongue"..." to being a language foreign to all, which could not even be used or understood even by Romance-speakers except as a result of deliberate and systematic study, Herman op. cit. p. 110. If a date is wanted "we could say Latin 'died' in the first part of the eighth century," Herman. p 115 and after a long period 650–800 A.D. of rapidly accelerating changes, Herman p. 119. Even after the end of Classical Latin people had no other names for the languages they spoke than Latin or lingua romana or lingua romana rustica (to distinguish it from the formal Latin) for 200-300 years. Modern people call these languages proto-Romance.     

The flaw in the death metaphor for Latin is summarized in the first line of Wright's essay, "Did Latin die?": "Latin isn't dead, you know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wright, Roger | title = Did Latin die? | journal = Omnibus | volume = 15 | pages = 27–29 | date = 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright explains that the hundreds of millions of people whose first language is one of Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Rumanian, Catalan, etc., speak evolved Latin as surely as English speakers use the evolved continuation of Old English. While traditional Classical Latin was eventually reduced in use as a written code and abandoned as a useful secondary "roof language" ([[Dachsprache]]), naturally spoken Latin changed as all languages do.         

In terms of regional differences for the whole Latin period "we can only glimpse a tiny amount of divergence with the actual written data. In texts of all kinds, literary, technical, and all others, the written Latin of the first five or six centuries A.D. looks as if it were territorially homogeneous, even in its "vulgar" register. It is only in the later texts, of the seventh and eighth centuries, that we are able to see in the texts geographical differences that seem to be the precursors of similar differences in the subsequent Romance languages." Herman, op. cit. p. 117.

In the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] Latin faded as the Court language in the course of the 5th century. The Vulgar Latin spoken in the Balkans north of Greece became heavily influenced by Greek and Slavic (Vulgar Latin already had Greek loanwords before the Roman Empire) and also became radically different from Classical Latin and from the proto-Romance of Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Vulgar Latin | author1=Posner, Rebecca | author2=Sala, Marius | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica | url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Vulgar-Latin | accessdate=20 Jun 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association | publisher=American Philological Association | year=1870 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oOY5AQAAMAAJ | pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the term ==

The term "common speech" (''sermo vulgaris''), which later became "Vulgar Latin", was used by inhabitants of the Roman Empire. Subsequently it became a technical term from Latin and [[Romance languages|Romance-language]] [[philology]] referring to the unwritten varieties of a Latinised language spoken mainly by [[Italo-Celtic]] populations governed by the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Roman Empire]].

Traces of their language appear in some inscriptions, such as graffiti or advertisements. The educated population mainly responsible for [[Classical Latin]] may also have spoken Vulgar Latin in certain contexts depending on their socioeconomic background. The term was first used improperly in that sense by the pioneers of Romance-language philology: [[François Juste Marie Raynouard]] (1761–1836) and [[Friedrich Christian Diez]] (1794–1876).

In the course of his studies on the lyrics of songs written by the [[troubadour]]s of [[Provence]], which had already been studied by [[Dante Alighieri]] and published in ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'', Raynouard noticed that the Romance languages derived in part from lexical, morphological, and syntactic features that were Latin, but were not preferred in [[Classical Latin]]. He hypothesized an intermediate phase and identified it with the ''Romana lingua'', a term that in countries speaking Romance languages meant "nothing more or less than the vulgar speech as opposed to literary or grammatical Latin".&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1906), p.&amp;nbsp;239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diez, the principal founder of Romance-language philology, impressed by the [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative methods]] of [[Jakob Grimm]] in ''Deutsche Grammatik'', which came out in 1819 and was the first to use such methods in philology, decided to apply them to the Romance languages and discovered Raynouard's work, ''Grammaire comparée des langues de l'Europe latine dans leurs rapports avec la langue des troubadours'', published in 1821. Describing himself as a pupil of Raynouard, he went on to expand the concept to all Romance languages, not just the speech of the troubadours, on a systematic basis, thereby becoming the originator of a new field of scholarly inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1906), pp. 244–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diez, in his signal work on the topic, "Grammar of the Romance Languages,"&lt;ref&gt;''Grammatik der romanischen Sprachen'', first published in 1836–1843 and multiple times thereafter&lt;/ref&gt; after enumerating six Romance languages that he compared: Italian and Wallachian (''i.e.'', Romanian) (east); Spanish and Portuguese (southwest); and Provençal and French (northwest), asserts that they had their origin in Latin – but "not from classical Latin," rather "from the Roman popular language or popular dialect".&lt;ref&gt;''nicht aus dem classischen Latein'', rather ''aus der römischen Volkssprache oder Volksmundart''. Diez (1882), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; These terms, as he points out later in the work, are a translation into German of Dante's ''vulgare latinum'' and ''Latinum vulgare'', and the Italian of [[Boccaccio]], ''latino volgare''.&lt;ref&gt;Diez (1882), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; These names in turn are at the end of a tradition extending to the [[Roman republic]].

The concepts and vocabulary from which ''vulgare latinum'' descend were known in the classical period and are to be found amply represented in the unabridged Latin dictionary, starting in the late Roman republic. [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]] was a prolific writer. His works have survived in large quantity, and serve as a standard of Latin. He and his contemporaries recognized the ''lingua Latina''; but they also knew varieties of "speech" under the name ''{{wt|la|sermo}}''. Latin could be ''sermo Latinus'', but there was also a variety known as ''sermo vulgaris'', ''sermo vulgi'', ''sermo plebeius'' and ''sermo quotidianus''. These modifiers inform post-classical readers that a conversational Latin existed, which was used by the masses (''{{wt|la|vulgus}}'') in daily speaking (''{{wt|la|quotidianus}}'') and was perceived as lower-class (''{{wt|la|plebeius}}'').

These vocabulary items manifest no opposition to the written language. There was an opposition to higher-class, or family Latin (good family) in ''sermo familiaris'' and very rarely literature might be termed ''sermo nobilis''. The supposed "sermo classicus" is a scholarly fiction unattested in the dictionary. All kinds of ''sermo'' were spoken only, not written.  If one wanted to refer to what in post-classical times was called classical Latin one resorted to the concept of ''{{wt|la|latinitas}}'' ("latinity") or ''{{wt|la|latine}}'' (adverb). 

If one spoke in the ''lingua'' or ''sermo Latinus'' one merely spoke Latin, but if one spoke ''{{wt|la|latine}}'' or ''{{wt|la|latinius}}'' ("more Latinish") one spoke good Latin, and formal Latin had ''{{wt|la|Latinitas|latinitas}}'', the quality of good Latin, about it. After the fall of the empire and the transformation of spoken Latin into the early Romance languages the only representative of the Latin language was written Latin, which became known as ''classicus'', "classy" Latin. The original opposition was between formal or implied good Latin and informal or Vulgar Latin. The spoken/written dichotomy is entirely philological.

== Sources ==
Vulgar Latin is a [[blanket term]] covering the popular [[dialect]]s and [[sociolect]]s of the [[Latin|Latin language]] throughout its range, from the hypothetical ''prisca latinitas'' of unknown or poorly remembered times in early Latium, to the language spoken around the fall of the empire. Although making it clear that ''sermo vulgaris'' existed, ancient writers said very little about it. Because it was not [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]], it can only be studied indirectly. Knowledge comes from these chief sources:&lt;ref&gt;Grandigent (1907), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Solecism]]s, especially in [[Late Latin]] texts.
# Mention of it by ancient grammarians, including [[prescriptive grammar]] texts from the Late Latin period condemning linguistic "errors" that represent spoken Latin.
# The [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]], which reconstructs Proto-Romance, a hypothetical vernacular [[proto-language]] from which the Romance languages descended.
# Some literary works written in a lower [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] of Latin provide a glimpse into the world of Vulgar Latin in the classical period: the dialogues of the plays of [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]], being comedies with many characters who were slaves, and the speech of freedmen in the ''[[Cena Trimalchionis]]'' by [[Petronius Arbiter]].

== History ==
[[File:Sacramenta Argentariae (pars brevis).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|An extract of the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]], the earliest known Gallo-Romance text.]]

The original written Latin language (what is today referred to as ''Classical Latin'') was adapted from the actual spoken language of the Latins, with some minor modifications, long before the rise of the [[Roman Empire]]. As with many languages, over time the spoken ''vulgar'' language diverged from the written language, with the written language remaining somewhat static. During the classical period spoken (Vulgar) Latin still remained largely common across the Empire, some minor dialectal differences notwithstanding. 

The collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] rapidly began to change this. The former western provinces became increasingly isolated from the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], leading to a rapid divergence between the Latin spoken on either side of the Adriatic north of line that ran from northern Albania mid-way through Bulgaria but stopped short of the Black Sea coast which was Greek-speaking. In the West an even more complex transformation was occurring. A blending of cultures was occurring between the former Roman citizens who were fluent in the "proper" Latin speech (which was already substantially different from Classical Latin), and many of the [[Goths|Gothic]] rulers who, though largely Latinised, tended to speak Latin poorly, speaking what could be considered a pidgin of Latin and their Germanic mother tongue, though this changed over time. Notable among those who spoke Latin well is Theodoric the Great, imperial regent of Italy (493–526) who is reputed to have been illiterate based on his use of stamp to sign documents. Since he lived as a hostage of Emperor Leo I at the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]] from 461 to 471 (from age 7 to 17) and was well-educated by Constantinople's best teachers,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Mark J., Toward a History of Theoderic's Building Program, Dumbarton Oaks Papers, 1988, volume42, pp=73–96&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=73}} it difficult to believe he did not know Greek and Latin.

The vulgar Latin language that continued to evolve after the establishment of the successor kingdoms of the Roman State incorporated Germanic vocabulary, but with minimal influences from Germanic grammar (Germanic languages did not displace Latin except in northern Belgium, England, the Rhineland Moselle region and north of the Alps). For a few centuries this language remained relatively common across most of Western Europe (as a result, Italian, Spanish, French, etc. are far more similar to each other than to Classical Latin), though regional dialects were already developing. As early as 722, in a face to face meeting between [[Pope Gregory II]], born and raised in Rome, and [[Saint Boniface]], an [[Anglo-Saxon]], Boniface complained that he found Pope Gregory's Latin speech difficult to understand, a clear sign of the transformation of Vulgar Latin in two regions of western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Horace, ''The Lives of the Popes in the Early Middle Ages, Vol. I: The Popes Under the Lombard Rule, Part 2, 657–795'' (1903), pg. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Although diverging Classical Latin and Vulgar Latin were still viewed as the same language, although increasingly divergent, Latin and the Romance Languages in the Early Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Roger Wright, 1991, p. 22, "...it is well known that there is absolutely no evidence for any name other than Latin in the Romance area before the ninth century"..."Ir means that the process of establishing new language names does not belong to Carolingian times, but to the long period of expansion that followed after the disastrous tenth century," Tore Janson, {{ISBN|0-271-01569-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the third [[Council of Tours]] in 813, [[priest]]s were ordered to preach in the vernacular language – either in the ''rustica lingua romanica'' (Vulgar Latin), or in the [[West Germanic languages|Germanic vernaculars]] – since the common people could no longer understand formal Latin. Within a generation, the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] (842), a treaty between [[Charlemagne]]'s grandsons [[Charles the Bald]] and [[Louis the German]], was proffered and recorded in a language that was already distinct from Latin. József Herman states: {{quote|It seems certain that in the sixth century, and quite likely into the early parts of the seventh century, people in the main Romanized areas could still largely understand the biblical and liturgical texts and the commentaries (of greater or lesser simplicity) that formed part of the rites and of religious practice, and that even later, throughout the seventh century, saints' lives written in Latin could be read aloud to the congregations with an expectation that they would be understood. We can also deduce however, that in Gaul, from the central part of the eighth century onward, many people, including several of the clerics, were not able to understand even the most straightforward religious texts.&lt;ref name="Herman"&gt;Herman (2000), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the end of the first millennium, local speech had diverged to the point that distinct languages are recognizable; names were emerging for these; and some of the more geographically distant ones may have become mutually unintelligible. With the evolved Latin vernaculars viewed as different languages with local norms, specific [[orthography|orthographies]] were duly developed for some. Since all modern Romance varieties are continuations of this evolution, Vulgar Latin is not extinct but survives in variously evolved forms as today's Romance languages and dialects. In Romance-speaking Europe, recognition of the common origin of Romance varieties was replaced by labels recognizing and implicitly accentuating local differences in linguistic features. Some Romance languages evolved more than others. In terms of phonological structures, for example, a clear hierarchy from conservative to innovative is found in a comparison of modern Italian, Spanish and French (e.g. Latin ''amica'' &gt; Italian ''amica'', Spanish ''amiga'', French ''amie''; Latin ''caput'' &gt; Italian ''capo'', Spanish ''cabo'', French ''chef'').

The [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] offer indications of the state of Gallo-Romance toward the middle of the 9th century. While the language cannot be said with any degree of certainty to be Old French in the sense of the linear precursor to today's standard French, the abundance of Gallo-Romance features provides a glimpse of some particulars of Vulgar Latin's evolution on French soil.

Vulgar Latin featured a large vocabulary of words that were productive in Romance.

== Phonology ==
{{See also|Latin spelling and pronunciation|Latin regional pronunciation}}
{{Main article|Romance languages}}

There was no single pronunciation of Vulgar Latin, and the pronunciation of Vulgar Latin in the various Latin-speaking areas is indistinguishable from the earlier history of the phonology of the Romance languages. See the article on [[Romance languages]] for more information.

=== Evidence of changes ===
{{wikisourcelang|la|Appendix Probi|Appendix Probi}}
Evidence of phonological changes can be seen in the late 3rd-century [[Appendix Probi]], a collection of glosses [[Prescription and description|prescribing]] correct classical Latin forms for certain vulgar forms. These glosses describe:
* a process of [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]], the loss of [[stress (linguistics)|unstressed]] vowels in medial syllables ("''calida non calda''");
* the merger of [[Stress (linguistics)|unstressed]] pre-vocalic {{IPA|/e/}} and short {{IPA|/i/}}, probably as [[palatal approximant|yod]] {{IPA|/j/}} ("''vinea non vinia''");
* the levelling of the distinction between {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} ("''coluber non colober''") and {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} ("''dimidius non demedius''");
* [[regularization (linguistics)|regularization]] of irregular forms ("''glis non glirus''");
* regularization and emphasis of gendered forms ("''pauper mulier non paupera mulier''");
* levelling of the distinction between {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} between vowels ("''bravium non brabium''");
* [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of [[stop consonant|plosive]] [[consonant cluster]]s ("''amycdala non amiddula"'');
* the substitution of [[diminutive]]s for [[markedness|unmarked]] words ("''auris non oricla, neptis non nepticla''");
* the loss of syllable-final nasals before /s/ ("''mensa non mesa''") or their inappropriate insertion as a form of [[hypercorrection]] ("''formosus non formunsus''");
* the loss of {{IPA|/h/}}, both initially ("''hostiae non ostiae''") and within the word ("''adhuc non aduc''");
* simplification of {{IPA|/kʷ/}} ("''coqui non coci''").

Many of the forms castigated in the ''Appendix Probi'' proved to be the forms accepted in Romance; e.g., ''oricla'' (evolved from the Classical Latin marked diminutive ''auricula'') is the source of French ''oreille'', Catalan ''orella'', Spanish ''oreja'', Italian ''orecchia'', Romanian ''ureche'', Portuguese ''orelha'', Sardinian ''origra'' 'ear', not the prescribed ''auris''. Development of yod from the post-nasal unstressed /e/ of ''vinea'' enabled the [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of /n/ that would produce French ''vigne'', Italian ''vigna'', Spanish ''viña'', Portuguese ''vinha'', Catalan ''vinya'', Occitan ''vinha'', Friulan ''vigne'', etc., 'vineyard'.

=== Consonant development ===
{{See also|Romance languages#Consonants}}
The most significant consonant changes affecting Vulgar Latin were [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] (except in [[Sardinia]]); [[lenition]], including simplification of geminate consonants (in areas north and west of the [[La Spezia–Rimini Line]], e.g. Spanish ''digo'' vs. Italian ''dico'' 'I say', Spanish ''boca'' vs. Italian ''bocca'' 'mouth'); and loss of final consonants.

==== Loss of final consonants ====
The loss of final consonants was already under way by the 1st century AD in some areas. A [[graffiti|graffito]] at [[Pompeii]] reads {{smallcaps|quisque ama valia}}, which in Classical Latin would read {{smallcaps|quisquis amat valeat}} ("may whoever loves be strong/do well").&lt;ref name="Harrington" /&gt; (The change from {{smallcaps|valeat}} to {{smallcaps|valia}} is also an early indicator of the development of {{IPA|/j/}} ([[Palatal approximant|yod]]), which played such an important part in the development of [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]].) On the other hand, this loss of final {{IPA|/t/}} was not general. [[Old Spanish]] and [[Old French]] preserved a reflex of final {{IPA|/t/}} up through 1100 AD or so, and modern French still maintains final {{IPA|/t/}} in some [[liaison (French)|liaison]] environments.

==== Lenition of stops ====
Areas north and west of the [[La Spezia–Rimini Line]] lenited intervocalic {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} to {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ/}}. This phenomenon is occasionally attested during the imperial period, but it became frequent by the 7th century. For example, in Merovingian documents, {{smallcaps|rotatico}} &gt; ''rodatico'' ("wheel tax").{{sfn|Herman|2000|p=47}}

==== Simplification of geminates ====
Reduction of bisyllabic clusters of identical consonants to a single syllable-initial consonant also typifies Romance north and west of La Spezia-Rimini. The results in Italian and Spanish provide clear illustrations: {{smallcaps|siccus}} &gt; Italian ''secco'', Spanish ''seco''; {{smallcaps|cippus}} &gt; Italian ''ceppo'', Spanish ''cepo''; {{smallcaps|mittere}} &gt; Italian ''mettere'', Spanish ''meter''. 

==== Loss of word-final m ====
The loss of the final ''m'' was a process which seems to have begun by the time of the earliest monuments of the Latin language. The [[epitaph]] of [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus]], who died around 150 BC, reads {{smallcaps|taurasia cisauna samnio cepit}}, which in Classical Latin would be {{smallcaps|taurāsiam, cisaunam, samnium cēpit}} ("He captured Taurasia, Cisauna, and Samnium"). This however can be explained in a different way, that the inscription simply fails to note the nasality of the final vowels (just as ''consul'' was customarily abbreviated as {{smallcaps|cos.}})

==== Neutralization of /b/ and /w/ ====
Confusions between ''b'' and ''v'' show that the Classical semivowel {{IPA|/w/}}, and intervocalic {{IPA|/b/}} partially merged to become a [[voiced bilabial fricative|bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|/β/}} (Classical semivowel {{IPA|/w/}} became {{IPA|/β/}} in Vulgar Latin, while {{IPA|[β]}} became an allophone of {{IPA|/b/}} in intervocalic position). Already by the 1st century AD, a document by one Eunus writes {{smallcaps|iobe}} for {{smallcaps|iovem}} and {{smallcaps|dibi}} for {{smallcaps|divi}}.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks, Geoffrey and James Clackson (2007). ''The Blackwell History of the Latin Language''. Malden: Blackwell Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-6209-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In most of the Romance varieties, this sound would further develop into {{IPA|/v/}}, with the notable exception of the [[Betacism|betacist]] varieties of [[History of the Spanish language#Merger of /b/ and /v/|Hispano-Romance]]: ''b'' and ''v'' represent the same phoneme /b/ (with allophone [β]) in Modern Spanish, as well as in [[Galician language|Galician]], northern [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and the northern dialects of [[Catalan language|Catalan]].

==== Consonant cluster simplification ====
In general, many clusters were simplified in Vulgar Latin. For example, {{IPA|/ns/}} reduced to {{IPA|/s/}}, reflecting the fact that syllable-final {{IPA|/n/}} was no longer phonetically consonantal. In some inscriptions, {{smallcaps|mensis}} &gt; ''mesis'' ("month"), or {{smallcaps|consul}} &gt; ''cosul'' ("consul").{{sfn|Herman|2000|p=47}} Descendants of {{smallcaps|mensis}} include Portuguese ''mês'', Spanish and Catalan ''mes'', Old French ''meis'' (Modern French ''mois''), Italian ''mese''.{{sfn|Herman|2000|p=47}} In some areas (including much of Italy), the clusters {{IPA|[mn]}}, {{IPA|[kt]}} {{angle bracket|ct}}, {{IPA|[ks]}} {{angle bracket|x}} were assimilated to the second element: {{IPA|[nn]}}, {{IPA|[tt]}}, {{IPA|[ss]}}.{{sfn|Herman|2000|p=47}} Thus, some inscriptions have {{smallcaps|omnibus}} &gt; ''onibus'' ("all [dative plural]"), {{smallcaps|indictione}} &gt; ''inditione'' ("indiction"), {{smallcaps|vixit}} &gt; ''bissit'' ("lived").{{sfn|Herman|2000|p=47}} Also, three-consonant clusters usually lost the middle element. For example: {{smallcaps|emptores}} &gt; ''imtores'' ("buyers") {{sfn|Herman|2000|p=47}}

Not all areas show the same development of these clusters, however. In the East, Italian has {{IPA|[kt]}} &gt; {{IPA|[tt]}}, as in {{smallcaps|octo}} &gt; ''otto'' ("eight") or {{smallcaps|nocte}} &gt; ''notte'' ("night"); while Romanian has {{IPA|[kt]}} &gt; {{IPA|[pt]}} (''opt'', ''noapte'').{{sfn|Herman|2000|p=47}} By contrast, in the West, the {{IPA|[k]}} weakened to {{IPA|[j]}}. In French and Portuguese, this came to form a diphthong with the previous vowel (''huit'', ''oito''; ''nuit'', ''noite''), while in Spanish, the [i] brought about [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of {{IPA|[t]}}, which produced {{IPA|[tʃ]}} (''*oito'' &gt; ''ocho'', ''*noite'' &gt; ''noche'') {{sfn|Herman|2000|p=48}}

Also, many clusters including {{IPA|[j]}} were simplified. Several of these groups seem to have never been fully stable{{clarify|date=October 2014}}&lt;!-- analogy, not sound change, eh? --&gt; (e.g. ''facunt'' for {{smallcaps|faciunt}}). This dropping has resulted in the word {{smallcaps|parietem}} ("wall") developing as Italian ''parete'', Romanian ''părete&gt;perete'', Portuguese ''parede'', Spanish ''pared'', or French ''paroi'' (Old French ''pareid'').{{sfn|Herman|2000|p=48}}

The cluster {{IPA|[kw]}} {{angle bracket|qu}} was simplified to {{IPA|[k]}} in most instances before /i/ and /e/. In 435, one can find the hypercorrective spelling ''quisquentis'' for {{smallcaps|quiescentis}} ("of the person who rests here"). Modern languages have followed this trend, for example Latin {{smallcaps|qui}} ("who") has become Italian ''chi'' and French ''qui'' (both {{IPA|/ki/}}); while {{smallcaps|quem}} ("whom") became ''quien'' ({{IPA|/kjen/}}) in Spanish and ''quem'' ({{IPA|/kẽj/}}) in Portuguese.{{sfn|Herman|2000|p=48}} However, {{IPA|[kw]}} has survived in front of {{IPA|[a]}} in most areas, although not in French; hence Latin {{smallcaps|quattuor}} yields Spanish ''cuatro'' ({{IPA|/kwatro/}}), Portuguese ''quatro'' ({{IPA|/kwatru/}}), and Italian ''quattro'' ({{IPA|/kwattro/}}), but French ''quatre'' ({{IPA|/katʀ/}}), where the ''qu-'' spelling is purely etymological.{{sfn|Herman|2000|p=48}}

In Spanish, most words with consonant clusters in syllable-final position are loanwords from Classical Latin, examples are: ''tra'''ns'''porte'' {{IPA|[tɾansˈpor.te]}}, ''tra'''ns'''mitir'' {{IPA|[tɾanz.miˈtir]}}, ''i'''ns'''talar'' {{IPA|[ins.taˈlar]}}, ''co'''ns'''tante'' {{IPA|[konsˈtante]}}, ''o'''bs'''tante'' {{IPA|[oβsˈtante]}}, ''o'''bs'''truir'' {{IPA|[oβsˈtɾwir]}}, ''pe'''rs'''pectiva'' {{IPA|[pers.pekˈti.βa]}}, ''i'''st'''mo'' {{IPA|[ˈist.mo]}}. A syllable-final position cannot be more than one consonant (one of n, r, l, s or z) in most (or all) dialects in colloquial speech, reflecting Vulgar Latin background. Realizations like {{IPA|[trasˈpor.te]}}, {{IPA|[tɾaz.miˈtir]}}, {{IPA|[is.taˈlar]}}, {{IPA|[kosˈtante]}}, {{IPA|[osˈtante]}}, {{IPA|[osˈtɾwir]}}, and {{IPA|[ˈiz.mo]}} are very common, and in many cases, they are considered acceptable even in formal speech.

=== Vowel development ===
{{See also|Romance languages#Vowels}}
In general, the ten-vowel system of Classical Latin, which relied on phonemic vowel length, was newly modelled into one in which [[vowel length]] distinctions lost [[phoneme|phonemic]] importance, and qualitative distinctions of [[vowel height|height]] became more prominent.

==== System in Classical Latin ====
Classical Latin had 10 different vowel [[phoneme]]s, grouped into five pairs of short-long, {{angle bracket|{{smallcaps|ă – ā, ĕ – ē, ĭ – ī, ŏ – ō, ŭ – ū}}}}. It also had four [[diphthong]]s, {{angle bracket|{{smallcaps|ae, oe, au, eu}}}}, and the rare diphthong {{angle bracket|{{smallcaps|ui}}}}. Finally, there were also long and short {{angle bracket|{{smallcaps|y}}}}, representing {{IPA|/y/}}, {{IPA|/yː/}} in Greek borrowings, which, however, probably came to be pronounced {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/iː/}} even before Romance vowel changes started.

At least since the 1st century AD, short vowels (except ''a'') differed by quality as well as by length from their long counterparts, the short vowels being lower.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (2003) states: "There appears to have been no great difference in quality between long and short ''a'', but in the case of the close and mid vowels (''i'' and ''u'', ''e'' and ''o'') the long appear to have been appreciably closer than the short." He then goes on to the historical development, quotations from various authors (from around the 2nd century AD), and evidence from older inscriptions in which  "e" stands for normally short ''i'', "i" for long ''e'', etc.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Grandgent|Moll|1991|p=11}} Thus the vowel inventory is usually reconstructed as {{IPA|/a – aː/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ – eː/}}, {{IPA|/ɪ – iː/}}, {{IPA|/ɔ – oː/}}, {{IPA|/ʊ – uː/}}.

==== Monophthongization ====
Many diphthongs had begun their [[monophthong]]ization very early. It is presumed that by Republican times, {{smallcaps|ae}} had become {{IPA|/ɛː/}} in unstressed syllables, a phenomenon that would spread to stressed positions around the 1st century AD.{{sfn|Palmer|1954|p=157}} From the 2nd century AD, there are instances of spellings with {{angle bracket|{{smallcaps|ĕ}}}} instead of {{angle bracket|{{smallcaps|ae}}}}.{{sfn|Grandgent|Moll|1991|p=118}} {{angle bracket|oe}} was always a rare diphthong in Classical Latin (in [[Old Latin]], ''oinos'' regularly became {{smallcaps|unus}} ("one") and became {{IPA|/eː/}} during early Imperial times. Thus, one can find ''penam'' for {{smallcaps|poenam}}.{{sfn|Palmer|1954|p=157}}

However, {{angle bracket|{{smallcaps|au}}}} lasted much longer. While it was monophthongized to {{IPA|/o/}} in areas of north and central Italy (including Rome), it was retained in most Vulgar Latin, and it survives in modern Romanian (for example, ''aur'' &lt; {{smallcaps|aurum}}). There is evidence in French and Spanish that the monophthongization of ''au'' occurred independently in those languages.{{sfn|Palmer|1954|p=157}}

==== Loss of distinctive length and near-close mergers ====
Length confusions seem to have begun in unstressed vowels, but they were soon generalized.{{sfn|Herman|2000|pp=28–29}} In the 3rd century AD, [[Marius Plotius Sacerdos|Sacerdos]] mentions people's tendency to shorten vowels at the end of a word, while some poets (like [[Commodian]]) show inconsistencies between long and short vowels in versification.{{sfn|Herman|2000|pp=28–29}} However, the loss of contrastive length caused only the merger of {{smallcaps|ă}} and {{smallcaps|ā}} while the rest of pairs remained distinct in quality: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ – e/}}, {{IPA|/ɪ – i/}}, {{IPA|/ɔ – o/}}, {{IPA|/ʊ – u/}}.{{sfn|Palmer|1954|p=156}}

Also, the near-close vowels {{IPA|/ɪ/}} and {{IPA|/ʊ/}} became more open in most varieties and merged with {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} respectively.{{sfn|Palmer|1954|p=156}} As a result, the reflexes of Latin ''pira'' "pear" and ''vēra'' "true" rhyme in most Romance languages: Italian and Spanish ''pera'', ''vera''. Similarly, Latin ''nucem'' "walnut" and ''vōcem'' "voice" become Italian ''noce, voce'', Portuguese ''noz, voz''.

There was likely some regional variation in pronunciation, as the Romanian languages and [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] evolved differently.&lt;ref name="Vincent"&gt;Vincent (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; In Sardinian, all corresponding short and long vowels simply merged with each other, creating a 5-vowel system: {{IPA|/a, e, i, o, u/}}. In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the front vowels ''ĕ, ĭ, ē, ī'' evolved like the Western languages, but the back vowels ''ŏ, ŭ, ō, ū'' evolved as in Sardinian. A few Southern Italian languages, such as southern [[Corsican language|Corsican]], northernmost [[Calabria]]n and southern [[Lucania]]n, behave like Sardinian with its penta-vowel system or, in case of [[Vegliote]] (even if only partially) and western [[Lucania]]n,&lt;ref&gt;Michele Loporcaro, "Phonological Processes", ''The Cambridge History of the Romance Languages: Structures'', vol. 1 (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2011), 112–4.&lt;/ref&gt; like Romanian.

==== Phonologization of stress ====
The placement of stress did not change from Classical to Vulgar Latin, and words continued to be stressed on the same syllable they were before. However, the loss of distinctive length disrupted the correlation between syllable weight and stress placement that existed in Classical Latin. Where in Classical Latin the place of the accent was predictable from the structure of the word, it was no longer so in Vulgar Latin. Stress had become a phonological property and could serve to distinguish forms that were otherwise homophones.

==== Lengthening of stressed open syllables ====
After the Classical Latin [[vowel length]] distinctions were lost in favor of [[vowel quality]], a new system of [[allophone|allophonic]] vowel quantity appeared sometime between the 4th and 5th centuries. Around then, stressed vowels in [[open syllable]]s came to be pronounced long (but still keeping height contrasts), and all the rest became short. For example, long ''venis'' {{IPA|/*ˈvɛː.nis/}}, ''fori'' {{IPA|/*fɔː.ri/}}, ''cathedra'' {{IPA|/*ˈkaː.te.dra/}}; but short ''vendo'' {{IPA|/*ˈven.do/}}, ''formas'' {{IPA|/*ˈfor.mas/}}.{{sfn|Grandgent|Moll|1991|p=125}} (This allophonic length distinction persists to this day in [[Italian phonology|Italian]].) However, in some regions of Iberia and Gaul, all stressed vowels came to be pronounced long: for example, ''porta'' {{IPA|/*ˈpɔːr.ta/}}, ''tempus'' {{IPA|/*ˈtɛːm.pus/}}.{{sfn|Grandgent|Moll|1991|p=125}} In many descendents, several of the long vowels underwent some form of [[diphthongization]], most extensively in [[Old French]] where five of the seven long vowels were affected by breaking.

== Grammar ==

=== Romance articles ===
It is difficult to place the point in which the [[definite article]], absent in Latin but present in all Romance languages, arose, largely because the highly colloquial speech in which it arose was seldom written down until the daughter languages had strongly diverged; most surviving texts in early Romance show the articles fully developed.

Definite articles evolved from demonstrative [[pronoun]]s or [[adjective]]s (an analogous development is found in many Indo-European languages, including [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]); compare the fate of the Latin [[demonstrative adjective]] ''{{wt|la|ille}}, {{wt|la|illa}}, {{wt|la|illud}}'' "that", in the [[Romance languages]], becoming French ''{{wt|fr|le}}'' and ''{{wt|fr|la}}'' (Old French ''li'', ''lo'', ''la''), Catalan and Spanish ''{{wt|es|el}}'', ''{{wt|es|la}}'' and ''{{wt|es|lo}}'', Portuguese ''{{wt|pt|o}}'' and ''{{wt|pt|a}}'' (elision of -l- is a common feature of Portuguese), and Italian ''{{wt|it|il}}'', ''{{wt|it|lo}}'' and ''{{wt|it|la}}''. Sardinian went its own way here also, forming its article from ''{{wt|la|ipse}}, {{wt|la|ipsa}}'' "this" (''su, sa''); some Catalan and Occitan dialects have articles from the same source. While most of the Romance languages put the article before the noun, Romanian has its own way, by putting the article after the noun, e.g. ''lupul'' ("the wolf" – from *''lupum illum'') and ''omul'' ("the man" – ''*homo illum''),&lt;ref name="Vincent" /&gt; possibly a result of its membership in the [[Balkan sprachbund]].

This demonstrative is used in a number of contexts in some early texts in ways that suggest that the Latin demonstrative was losing its force. The [[Vetus Latina]] Bible contains a passage ''Est tamen ille daemon sodalis peccati'' ("The devil is a companion of sin"), in a context that suggests that the word meant little more than an article. The need to translate [[sacred text]]s that were originally in [[Koine Greek]], which had a definite article, may have given Christian Latin an incentive to choose a substitute. [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Aetheria]] uses ''ipse'' similarly: ''per mediam vallem ipsam'' ("through the middle of the valley"), suggesting that it too was weakening in force.&lt;ref name="Harrington"&gt;Harrington et al. (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another indication of the weakening of the demonstratives can be inferred from the fact that at this time, legal and similar texts begin to swarm with ''{{wt|la|praedictus}}'', ''{{wt|la|supradictus}}'', and so forth (all meaning, essentially, "aforesaid"), which seem to mean little more than "this" or "that". Gregory of Tours writes, ''Erat autem... beatissimus Anianus in supradicta civitate episcopus'' ("Blessed Anianus was bishop in that city.") The original Latin demonstrative adjectives were no longer felt to be strong or specific enough.&lt;ref name="Harrington" /&gt; 

In less formal speech, reconstructed forms suggest that the inherited Latin demonstratives were made more forceful by being compounded with ''{{wt|la|ecce}}'' (originally an [[interjection]]: "behold!"), which also spawned Italian ''{{wt|it|ecco}}'' through ''{{wt|la|eccum}}'', a contracted form of ''ecce eum''. This is the origin of Old French ''{{wt|fro|cil}}'' (*''ecce ille''), ''{{wt|fro|cist}}'' (*''ecce iste'') and ''{{wt|fro|ici}}'' (*''ecce hic''); Italian ''{{wt|it|questo}}'' (*''eccum istum''), ''{{wt|it|quello}}'' (*''eccum illum'') and (now mainly Tuscan) ''{{wt|it|codesto}}'' (*''eccum tibi istum''), as well as ''{{wt|it|qui}}'' (*''eccu hic''), ''{{wt|it|qua}}'' (*''eccum hac''); Spanish ''{{wt|es|aquel}}'' and Portuguese ''{{wt|pt|aquele}}'' (*''eccum ille''); Spanish ''{{wt|es|acá}}'' and Portuguese ''{{wt|pt|cá}}'' (*''eccum hac''); Spanish ''{{wt|es|aquí}}'' and Portuguese ''{{wt|pt|aqui}}'' (*''eccum hic''); Portuguese ''{{wt|pt|acolá}}'' (*''eccum illac'') and ''{{wt|pt|aquém}}'' (*''eccum inde''); Romanian ''{{wt|ro|acest}}'' (*''ecce iste'') and ''{{wt|ro|acela}}'' (*''ecce ille''), and many other forms.

On the other hand, even in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]], no demonstrative appears even in places where one would clearly be called for in all the later languages (''pro christian poblo'' – "for the Christian people"). Using the demonstratives as articles may have still been considered overly informal for a royal oath in the 9th century. Considerable variation exists in all of the Romance vernaculars as to their actual use: in Romanian, the articles are suffixed to the noun (or an adjective preceding it), as in other members of the [[Balkan sprachbund]] and the [[North Germanic languages]].

The numeral ''{{wt|la|unus}}, una'' (one) supplies the [[indefinite article]] in all cases (again, this is a common semantic development across Europe). This is anticipated in Classical Latin; [[Cicero]] writes ''cum uno gladiatore nequissimo'' ("with a most immoral gladiator"). This suggests that ''unus'' was beginning to supplant ''{{wt|la|quidam}}'' in the meaning of "a certain" or "some" by the 1st century BC.{{Dubious|date=May 2009}}

[[File:LatinGenderLoss.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.8|The genders]]
The three [[grammatical genders]] of Classical Latin were replaced by a two-gender system in most Romance languages.

The neuter gender of classical Latin was in most cases identical with the masculine both syntactically and morphologically. The confusion starts already in [[Pompeii|Pompeian]] graffiti, e.g., ''cadaver mortuus'' for ''cadaver mortuum'' ("dead body"), and ''hoc locum'' for ''hunc locum'' ("this place"). The morphological confusion shows primarily in the adoption of the nominative ending ''-us'' (''-Ø'' after ''-r'') in the ''o''-declension. 

In [[Petronius]]' work, one can find ''balneus'' for {{wt|la|balneum}} ("bath"), ''fatus'' for ''{{wt|la|fatum}}'' ("fate"), ''caelus'' for ''{{wt|la|caelum}}'' ("heaven"), ''amphitheater'' for ''{{wt|la|amphitheatrum}}'' ("amphitheatre"), ''vinus'' for ''{{wt|la|vinum}}'' ("wine"), and conversely, ''thesaurum'' for ''{{wt|la|thesaurus}}'' ("treasure"). Most of these forms occur in the speech of one man: Trimalchion, an uneducated Greek (i.e., foreign) [[freedman]].

In modern Romance languages, the nominative ''s''-ending has been largely abandoned, and all substantives of the ''o''-declension have an ending derived from ''-um'': ''-u'', ''-o'', or ''-Ø''. E.g., masculine ''{{wt|la|murum}}'' ("wall"), and neuter ''{{wt|la|caelum}}'' ("sky") have evolved to: Italian ''{{wt|it|muro}}'', ''{{wt|it|cielo}}''; Portuguese ''{{wt|pt|muro}}'', ''{{wt|pt|céu}}''; Spanish ''{{wt|es|muro}}'', ''{{wt|es|cielo}}'', Catalan ''{{wt|ca|mur}}'', ''{{wt|ca|cel}}''; Romanian ''{{wt|ro|mur}}'', ''cieru&gt;{{wt|ro|cer}}''; French ''{{wt|fr|mur}}'', ''{{wt|fr|ciel}}''. However, Old French still had ''-s'' in the nominative and ''-Ø'' in the accusative in both words: ''murs'', ''ciels'' [nominative] – ''mur'', ''ciel'' [oblique].
{{efb|In a few isolated masculine nouns, the ''s'' has been either preserved or reinstated in the modern languages, for example FILIUS ("son") &gt; French ''{{wt|fr|fils}}'', [[deus|DEUS]] ("god") &gt; Spanish ''{{wt|es|dios}}'' and Portuguese ''{{wt|pt|deus}}'', and particularly in proper names: Spanish ''Carlos'', ''Marcos'', in the conservative orthography of French ''Jacques'', ''Charles'', ''Jules'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;Menéndez Pidal 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;208; [http://monsu.desiderio.free.fr/curiosites/cassujet.html Survivances du cas sujet].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For some neuter nouns of the third declension, the oblique stem became the productive; for others, the nominative/accusative form, which was identical in Classical Latin. Evidence suggests that the neuter gender was under pressure well back into the imperial period. French ''(le) {{wt|fr|lait}}'', Catalan ''(la) {{wt|ca|llet}}'', Spanish ''(la) {{wt|es|leche}}'', Portuguese ''(o) {{wt|pt|leite}}'', Italian language ''(il) {{wt|it|latte}}'', [[Leonese language|Leonese]] ''(el) lleche'' and Romanian ''{{wt|ro|lapte}}(le)'' ("milk"), all derive from the non-standard but attested Latin nominative/accusative neuter ''{{wt|la|lacte}}'' or accusative masculine ''{{wt|la|lactem}}''.

Note also that in Spanish the word became feminine, while in French, Portuguese and Italian it became masculine (in Romanian it remained neuter, ''{{wt|ro|lapte}}/lăpturi''). Other neuter forms, however, were preserved in Romance; Catalan and French ''{{wt|fr|nom}}'', Leonese, Portuguese and Italian ''{{wt|it|nome}}'', Romanian ''{{wt|ro|nume}}'' ("name") all preserve the Latin nominative/accusative ''nomen'', rather than the oblique stem form *''nominem'' (which nevertheless produced Spanish ''{{wt|es|nombre}}'').&lt;ref name="Vincent" /&gt;

|}

Most neuter nouns had plural forms ending in &lt;small&gt;-A&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;-IA&lt;/small&gt;; some of these were reanalysed as feminine singulars, such as ''{{wt|la|gaudium}}'' ("joy"), plural ''gaudia''; the plural form lies at the root of the French feminine singular ''(la) {{wt|fr|joie}}'', as well as of Catalan and Occitan ''(la) {{wt|oc|joia}}'' (Italian ''la {{wt|it|gioia}}'' is a borrowing from French); the same for ''{{wt|la|lignum}}'' ("wood stick"), plural ''ligna'', that originated the Catalan feminine singular noun ''(la) {{wt|ca|llenya}}'', and Spanish ''(la) {{wt|es|leña}}''. Some Romance languages still have a special form derived from the ancient neuter plural which is treated grammatically as feminine: e.g., &lt;small&gt;{{wt|la|bracchium|BRACCHIUM}} : BRACCHIA&lt;/small&gt; "arm(s)" → Italian ''(il) {{wt|it|braccio}}'' : ''(le) braccia'', Romanian ''{{wt|ro|braț|braț(ul)}}'' : ''brațe(le)''. Cf. also [[Merovingian]] Latin ''ipsa animalia aliquas mortas fuerant''.

Alternations in Italian [[heteroclitic]] nouns such as ''l'uovo fresco'' ("the fresh egg") / ''le uova fresche'' ("the fresh eggs") are usually analysed as masculine in the singular and feminine in the plural, with an irregular plural in ''-a''. However, it is also consistent with their historical development to say that ''{{wt|it|uovo}}'' is simply a regular neuter noun (''{{wt|la|ovum}}'', plural ''ova'') and that the characteristic ending for words agreeing with these nouns is ''-o'' in the singular and ''-e'' in the plural. The same alternation in gender exists in certain Romanian nouns, but is considered regular as it is more common than in Italian. Thus, a relict neuter gender can arguably be said to persist in Italian and Romanian.

In Portuguese, traces of the neuter plural can be found in collective formations and words meant to inform a bigger size or sturdiness. Thus, one can use ''{{wt|pt|ovo}}/ovos'' ("egg/eggs") and ''{{wt|pt|ova}}/ovas'' ("roe", "a collection of eggs"), ''{{wt|pt|bordo}}/bordos'' ("section(s) of an edge") and ''{{wt|pt|borda}}/bordas'' ("edge/edges"), ''{{wt|pt|saco}}/sacos'' ("bag/bags") and ''{{wt|pt|saca}}/sacas'' ("sack/sacks"), ''{{wt|pt|manto}}/mantos'' ("cloak/cloaks") and ''{{wt|pt|manta}}/mantas'' ("blanket/blankets"). Other times, it resulted in words whose gender may be changed more or less arbitrarily, like ''{{wt|pt|fruto}}/{{wt|pt|fruta}}'' ("fruit"), ''{{wt|pt|caldo}}/{{wt|pt|calda}}'' (broth"), etc.

These formations were especially common when they could be used to avoid irregular forms.  In Latin, the names of trees were usually feminine, but many were declined in the second declension paradigm, which was dominated by masculine or neuter nouns. Latin ''{{wt|la|pirus}}'' ("[[pear]] tree"), a feminine noun with a masculine-looking ending, became masculine in Italian ''(il) {{wt|it|pero}}'' and Romanian ''{{wt|ro|păr|păr(ul)}}''; in French and Spanish it was replaced by the masculine derivations ''(le) {{wt|fr|poirier}}'', ''(el) {{wt|es|peral}}''; and in Portuguese and Catalan by the feminine derivations ''(a) {{wt|pt|pereira}}'', ''(la) {{wt|ca|perera}}''. 

As usual, irregularities persisted longest in frequently used forms. From the fourth declension noun ''manus'' ("hand"), another feminine noun with the ending ''-us'', Italian and Spanish derived ''(la) {{wt|es|mano}}'', Romanian ''mânu&gt;{{wt|ro|mâna}}'' pl (reg.)''mânule/{{wt|ro|mânuri}}'', Catalan ''(la) {{wt|ca|mà}}'', and Portuguese ''(a) {{wt|pt|mão}}'', which preserve the feminine gender along with the masculine appearance.

Except for the Italian and Romanian heteroclitic nouns, other major Romance languages have no trace of neuter nouns, but still have neuter pronouns. French ''{{wt|fr|celui-ci}} / {{wt|fr|celle-ci}} / {{wt|fr|ceci}}'' ("this"), Spanish ''{{wt|es|éste}} / {{wt|es|ésta}} / {{wt|es|esto}}'' ("this"), Italian: ''{{wt|it|gli}} / {{wt|it|le}} / {{wt|it|ci}}'' ("to him" /"to her" / "to it"), Catalan: ''{{wt|ca|ho}}'', ''{{wt|ca|açò}}'', ''{{wt|ca|això}}'', ''{{wt|ca|allò}}'' ("it" / ''this'' / ''this-that'' / ''that over there''); Portuguese: ''{{wt|pt|todo}} / {{wt|pt|toda}} / {{wt|pt|tudo}}'' ("all of him" / "all of her" / "all of it").

In Spanish, a three-way contrast is also made with the definite articles ''{{wt|es|el}}'', ''{{wt|es|la}}'', and ''{{wt|es|lo}}''. The last is used with nouns denoting abstract categories: ''lo bueno'', literally "that which is good", from ''{{wt|es|bueno}}'': good.

=== Loss of oblique cases ===
The Vulgar Latin vowel shifts caused the merger of several case endings in the nominal and adjectival declensions.{{sfn|Herman|2000|p=52}} Some of the causes include: the loss of final ''m'', the merger of ''ă'' with ''ā'', and the merger of ''ŭ'' with ''ō'' (see tables).{{sfn|Herman|2000|p=52}} Thus, by the 5th century, the number of case contrasts had been drastically reduced.{{sfn|Herman|2000|p=52}}

There also seems to be a marked tendency to confuse different forms even when they have not become homophonous (like in the generally more distinct plurals), which indicates nominal declension was not only shaped by phonetic mergers, but also by structural factors.{{sfn|Herman|2000|p=52}} As a result of the untenability of the noun case system after these phonetic changes, Vulgar Latin shifted from a markedly [[synthetic language]] to a more [[analytic language|analytic one]].

&lt;!--I don't have the whole explanation of the disapparition of every case--&gt;
The '''[[genitive case]]''' died out around the 3rd century AD, according to [[Wilhelm Meyer-Lübke|Meyer-Lübke]], and began to be replaced by {{smallcaps|de}}  + noun (which originally meant "about/concerning", weakened to "of") as early as the 2nd century BC {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. Exceptions of remaining genitive forms are some pronouns, many fossilized combinations like sayings, some proper names, and certain terms related to the church. For example, French ''{{wt|fr|jeudi}}'' ("Thursday") &lt; Old French ''juesdi'' &lt; Vulgar Latin {{smallcaps|{{wt|la|diēs Iovis|jovis diēs}}}}; Spanish ''es {{wt|es|menester}}'' ("it is necessary") &lt; {{smallcaps|est {{wt|la|ministeri}}}}; terms like {{smallcaps|angelorum}}, {{smallcaps|paganorum}}; and Italian ''{{wt|it|terremoto}}'' ("earthquake") &lt; {{smallcaps|{{wt|la|terraemotus|terrae motu}}}} as well as names like ''Paoli'', ''Pieri''.{{sfn|Grandgent|Moll|1991|p=82}}

The '''[[dative case]]''' lasted longer than the genitive, even though [[Plautus]], in the 2nd century BC, already shows some instances of substitution by the construction {{smallcaps|ad}} + accusative. For example, {{smallcaps|ad carnuficem dabo}}.{{sfn|Grandgent|Moll|1991|p=82}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Captivi]], 1019.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[accusative case]]''' developed as a prepositional case, displacing many instances of the [[ablative case|ablative]].{{sfn|Grandgent|Moll|1991|p=82}} Towards the end of the imperial period, the accusative came to be used more and more as a general oblique case. {{sfn|Herman|2000|p=53}}

Despite increasing case mergers, nominative and accusative forms seem to have remained distinct for much longer, since they are rarely confused in inscriptions.{{sfn|Herman|2000|p=53}} Even though Gaulish texts from the 7th century rarely confuse both forms, it is believed that both cases began to merge in Africa by the end of the empire, and a bit later in parts of Italy and Iberia.{{sfn|Herman|2000|p=53}} Nowadays, [[Romanian language|Romanian]] maintains a two-case system, while [[Old French]] and [[Old Occitan]] had a two-case subject-oblique system. 

This Old French system was based largely on whether or not the Latin case ending contained an "s" or not, with the "s" being retained but all vowels in the ending being lost (as with ''veisin'' below). But since this meant that it was easy to confuse the singular nominative with the plural oblique, and the plural nominative with the singular oblique, along with the final "s" becoming silent, this case system ultimately collapsed as well, and French adopted one case (usually the oblique) for all purposes, leaving the Romanian the only one to survive to the present day.

=== Wider use of prepositions ===
Loss of a productive noun case system meant that the [[syntax|syntactic]] purposes it formerly served now had to be performed by [[preposition]]s and other paraphrases. These particles increased in number, and many new ones were formed by compounding old ones. The descendant Romance languages are full of grammatical particles such as Spanish ''{{wt|es|donde}}'', "where", from Latin ''{{wt|la|de}}'' + ''{{wt|la|unde}}'', or French ''{{wt|fr|dès}}'', "since", from ''{{wt|la|de}}'' + ''{{wt|la|ex}}'', while the equivalent Spanish and Portuguese ''{{wt|pt|desde}}'' is ''de'' + ''ex'' + ''de''. Spanish ''{{wt|es|después}}'' and Portuguese ''{{wt|pt|depois}}'', "after", represent ''de'' + ''ex'' + ''{{wt|la|post}}''.

Some of these new compounds appear in literary texts during the late empire; French ''{{wt|fr|dehors}}'', Spanish ''de {{wt|es|fuera}}'' and Portuguese ''de {{wt|pt|fora}}'' ("outside") all represent ''de'' + ''{{wt|la|foris}}'' (Romanian ''{{wt|ro|afară}}'' – ''ad'' + ''foris''), and we find [[Jerome]] writing ''stulti, nonne qui fecit, quod de foris est, etiam id, quod de intus est fecit?'' (Luke 11.40: "ye fools, did not he, that made which is without, make that which is within also?"). In some cases, compounds were created by combining a large number of particles, such as the Romanian ''{{wt|ro|adineauri}}'' ("just recently") from ''ad'' + ''de'' + ''in'' + ''illa'' + ''hora''.&lt;ref&gt;Romanian Explanatory Dictionary ([http://dexonline.ro/definitie/adineauri DEXOnline.ro])&lt;/ref&gt;

As Latin was losing its case system, prepositions started to move in to fill the void. In colloquial Latin, the preposition ''ad'' followed by the accusative was sometimes used as a substitute for the dative case.

'''Classical Latin:'''
:''Marcus patrī librum dat.'' "Marcus is giving [his] father [a/the] book."

'''Vulgar Latin:'''
:''*Marcos da libru a patre.'' "Marcus is giving [a/the] book to [his] father."

Just as in the disappearing dative case, colloquial Latin sometimes replaced the disappearing genitive case with the preposition ''de'' followed by the ablative, then eventually the accusative (oblique).

'''Classical Latin:'''
:''Marcus mihi librum patris dat.'' "Marcus is giving me [his] father's book.

'''Vulgar Latin:'''
:''*Marcos mi da libru de patre.'' "Marcus is giving me [the] book of [his] father."

=== Pronouns ===
Unlike in the nominal and adjectival inflections, pronouns kept great part of the case distinctions. However, many changes happened. For example, the {{IPA|/ɡ/}} of ''ego'' was lost by the end of the empire, and ''eo'' appears in manuscripts from the 6th century.{{Which|date=April 2017}}{{sfn|Grandgent|Moll|1991|p=238}}

=== Adverbs ===
Classical Latin had a number of different suffixes that made [[adverb]]s from [[adjective]]s: ''{{wt|la|cārus}}'', "dear", formed ''{{wt|la|cārē}}'', "dearly"; ''{{wt|la|ācriter}}'', "fiercely", from ''{{wt|la|ācer}}''; ''{{wt|la|crēbrō}}'', "often", from ''{{wt|la|crēber}}''. All of these derivational suffixes were lost in Vulgar Latin, where adverbs were invariably formed by a feminine [[ablative case|ablative]] form modifying ''{{wt|la|mente}}'', which was originally the ablative of ''mēns'', and so meant "with a ... mind". So ''{{wt|la|vēlōx}}'' ("quick") instead of ''{{wt|la|vēlōciter}}'' ("quickly") gave ''veloci mente'' (originally "with a quick mind", "quick-mindedly")
This explains the widespread rule for forming adverbs in many Romance languages: add the suffix -''ment(e)'' to the feminine form of the adjective. The development illustrates a textbook case of [[grammaticalization]] in which an autonomous form, the noun meaning 'mind', while still in free lexical use in e.g. Italian ''venire in mente'' 'come to mind', becomes a productive suffix for forming adverbs in Romance such as Italian ''{{wt|it|chiaramente}}'', Spanish ''{{wt|es|claramente}}'' 'clearly', with both its source and its meaning opaque in that usage other than as adverb formant.

In general, the verbal system in the Romance languages changed less from Classical Latin than did the nominal system.

The four conjugational classes generally survived. The second and third conjugations already had identical imperfect tense forms in Latin, and also shared a common present participle. Because of the merging of short ''i'' with long ''ē'' in most of Vulgar Latin, these two conjugations grew even closer together. Several of the most frequently-used forms became indistinguishable, while others became distinguished only by stress placement:

|}

These two conjugations came to be conflated in many of the Romance languages, often by merging them into a single class while taking endings from each of the original two conjugations. Which endings survived was different for each language, although most tended to favour second conjugation endings over the third conjugation. Spanish, for example, mostly eliminated the third conjugation forms in favour of second conjugation forms. 

French and Catalan did the same, but tended to generalise the third conjugation infinitive instead. Catalan in particular almost completely eliminated the second conjugation ending over time, reducing it to a small relic class. In Italian, the two infinitive endings remained separate (but spelled identically), while the conjugations merged in most other respects much as in the other languages. However, the third-conjugation third-person plural present ending survived in favour of the second conjugation version, and was even extended to the fourth conjugation. Romanian also maintained the distinction between the second and third conjugation endings.

In the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], many languages generalized the ''-aui'' ending most frequently found in the first conjugation. This led to an unusual development; phonetically, the ending was treated as the diphthong {{IPA|/au/}} rather than containing a semivowel {{IPA|/awi/}}, and in other cases the {{IPA|/w/}} sound was simply dropped. We know this because it did not participate in the sound shift from {{IPA|/w/}} to {{IPA|/β̞/}}.  Thus Latin ''amaui'', ''amauit'' ("I loved; he/she loved") in many areas became proto-Romance *''amai'' and *''amaut'', yielding for example Portuguese ''amei'', ''amou''. This suggests that in the spoken language, these changes in conjugation preceded the loss of {{IPA|/w/}}.&lt;ref name="Vincent" /&gt;

Another major systemic change was to the [[future tense]], remodelled in Vulgar Latin with [[auxiliary verbs]]. A new future was originally formed with the auxiliary verb ''{{wt|la|habere}}'', *''amare habeo'', literally "to love I have" (cf. English "I have to love", which has shades of a future meaning). This was contracted into a new future suffix in Western Romance forms, which can be seen in the following modern examples of "I will love":
* {{lang-fr|j'aimerai}} (''je'' + ''aimer'' + ''ai'') ← ''aimer'' ["to love"] + ''ai'' ["I have"].
* [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and {{lang-gl|amarei}} (''amar'' + [''h'']''ei'') ← ''amar'' ["to love"] + ''hei'' ["I have"]
* [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and {{lang-ca|amaré}} (''amar'' + [''h'']''e'') ← ''amar'' ["to love"] + ''he'' ["I have"].
* {{lang-it|amerò}} (''amar'' + [''h'']''o'') ← ''amare'' ["to love"] + ''ho'' ["I have"].

A [[periphrasis|periphrastic construction]] of the form 'to have to' (late Latin ''habere ad'') used as future is characteristic of [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]: 
* ''Ap'a istàre'' &lt; ''apo a istàre'' 'I will stay'
* ''Ap'a nàrrere'' &lt; ''apo a nàrrer'' 'I will say'

An innovative [[conditional mood|conditional]] (distinct from the [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]]) also developed in the same way (infinitive + conjugated form of ''habere''). The fact that the future and conditional endings were originally independent words is still evident in literary Portuguese, which in these tenses allows [[clitic]] object pronouns to be incorporated between the root of the verb and its ending: "I will love" (''eu'') ''amarei'', but "I will love you" ''amar-te-ei'', from ''amar'' + ''te'' ["you"] + (''eu'') ''hei'' = ''amar'' + ''te'' + [''h'']''ei'' = ''amar-te-ei''.

In Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, personal pronouns can still be omitted from verb phrases as in Latin, as the endings are still distinct enough to convey that information: ''venio'' &gt; Sp ''vengo'' ("I come"). In French, however, all the endings are typically homophonous except the first and second person (and occasionally also third person) plural, so the pronouns are always used (''je viens'') except in the [[imperative mood|imperative]]. 

Contrary to the millennia-long continuity of much of the active verb system, which has now survived 6000 years of known evolution, the synthetic [[passive voice]] was utterly lost in Romance, being replaced with [[periphrastic]] verb forms—composed of the verb "to be" plus a passive participle—or impersonal [[reflexive verb|reflexive]] forms—composed of a verb and a passivizing pronoun.

Apart from the grammatical and phonetic developments there were many cases of verbs merging as complex subtleties in Latin were reduced to simplified verbs in Romance. A classic example of this are the verbs expressing the concept "to go". Consider three particular verbs in Classical Latin expressing concepts of "going": ''{{wt|la|ire}}'', ''{{wt|la|vadere}}'', and *''ambitare''. In Spanish and Portuguese ''ire'' and ''vadere'' merged into the verb ''ir'', which derives some conjugated forms from ''ire'' and some from ''vadere''. ''andar'' was maintained as a separate verb derived from ''ambitare''. 

Italian instead merged ''vadere'' and ''ambitare'' into the verb ''{{wt|it|andare}}''. At the extreme French merged three Latin verbs with, for example, the present tense deriving from ''vadere'' and another verb ''ambulare'' (or something like it) and the future tense deriving from ''ire''. 
Similarly the Romance distinction between the Romance verbs for "to be", ''{{wt|la|essere}}'' and ''{{wt|la|stare}}'', was lost in French as these merged into the verb ''{{wt|fr|être}}''. In Italian, the verb ''{{wt|it|essere}}'' inherited both Romance meanings of "being essentially" and "being temporarily of the quality of", while ''{{wt|it|stare}}'' specialized into a verb denoting location or dwelling, or state of health.

==== Copula ====
{{Main article|Romance copula}}

The [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] (that is, the verb signifying "to be") of Classical Latin was ''{{wt|la|esse}}''. This evolved to *''essere'' in Vulgar Latin by attaching the common infinitive suffix ''-re'' to the classical infinitive; this produced Italian ''{{wt|it|essere}}'' and French ''{{wt|fr|être}}'' through Proto-Gallo-Romance *''essre'' and Old French ''{{wt|fro|estre}}'' as well as Spanish and Portuguese ''{{wt|pt|ser}}'' (Romanian ''a {{wt|ro|fi}}'' derives from ''fieri'', which means "to become"). 

In Vulgar Latin a second copula developed utilizing the verb ''{{wt|la|stare}}'', which originally meant (and is cognate with) "to stand", to denote a more temporary meaning. That is, *''essere'' signified the ''esse''nce, while ''stare'' signified the ''state.'' ''Stare'' evolved to Spanish and Portuguese ''{{wt|pt|estar}}'' and Old French ''{{wt|fro|ester}}'' (both through *''estare''), while Italian and Romanian retained the original form.

The semantic shift that underlies this evolution is more or less as follows: A speaker of Classical Latin might have said: ''vir est in foro'', meaning "the man is in/at the marketplace". The same sentence in Vulgar Latin could have been *''(h)omo stat in foro'', "the man stands in/at the marketplace", replacing the ''est'' (from ''esse'') with ''stat'' (from ''stare''), because "standing" was what was perceived as what the man was actually doing. 

The use of ''stare'' in this case was still semantically transparent assuming that it meant "to stand", but soon the shift from ''esse'' to ''stare'' became more widespread. In the Iberian peninsula ''esse'' ended up only denoting natural qualities that would not change, while ''stare'' was applied to transient qualities and location. In Italian, ''stare'' is used mainly for location, transitory state of health (''sta male'' 's/he is ill' but ''è gracile'' 's/he is puny') and, as in Spanish, for the eminently transient quality implied in a verb's progressive form, such as ''sto scrivendo'' to express 'I am writing'. 

The historical development of the ''stare'' + gerund progressive in those Romance languages that have it seems to have been a passage from a usage such as ''sto pensando'' 'I stand/stay (here) thinking', in which the ''stare'' form carries the full semantic load of 'stand, stay' to [[grammaticalization]] of the construction as expression of progressive [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] (Similar in concept to the English verbal construction of "I am '''still''' thinking"). The process of reanalysis that took place over time [[semantic bleaching|bleached]] the semantics of ''stare'' so that when used in combination with the gerund the form became solely a grammatical marker of subject and tense (e.g. ''sto'' = subject first person singular, present; ''stavo'' = subject first person singular, past), no longer a [[lexical verb]] with the semantics of 'stand' (not unlike the auxiliary in compound tenses that once meant 'have, possess', but is now semantically empty: ''j''''ai''' écrit'', '''''ho''' scritto'', '''''he''' escrito'', etc.). Whereas ''sto scappando'' would once have been semantically strange at best (?'I stay escaping'), once grammaticalization was achieved, collocation with a verb of inherent mobility was no longer contradictory, and ''sto scappando'' could and did become the normal way to express 'I am escaping'. (Although it might be objected that in sentences like Spanish ''la catedral está en la ciudad'', "the cathedral is in the city" this is also unlikely to change, but all locations are expressed through ''estar'' in Spanish, as this usage originally conveyed the sense of "the cathedral ''stands'' in the city").

=== Word order typology ===
Classical Latin in most cases adopted an SOV word order in ordinary prose, however other word orders were allowed, such as in poetry, due to its inflectional nature.
However, word order in the modern Romance languages generally adopted a standard SVO word order. This change may have been attributed from the Germanic peoples' influence in the late Imperial period, since they spoke in the SVO word order, or perhaps SVO was the ordinary Roman's way of speaking with SOV being considered more formal.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} 
Fragments of SOV word order still survive through object pronouns (te amo – "I love you").
