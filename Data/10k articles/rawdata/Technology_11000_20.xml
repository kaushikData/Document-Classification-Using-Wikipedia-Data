The '''Adventure Activities Licensing Authority''' (AALA) is the licensing authority for outdoor activity centres for young people in [[Great Britain]].  Since 2007 it has been part of the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE), the government body charged with overseeing health and safety in all workplaces.  AALA inspect and issue licences to providers. These licences give an assurance that, so far as is reasonably practicable, participants and employees can be 'safe'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoJt1RlgprcsVu3X7wmtctw]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 2010, Lord Young of Graffham, recommended that the AALA be abolished and the existing statutory licensing regime be replaced by a code of practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/aala/recommendation-to-abolish-aala.htm Recommendation to abolish the Adventure Activities Licensing Authority]&lt;/ref&gt;

The AALA was created following the [[Lyme Bay canoeing tragedy]] in March, 1993 which involved a commercial organisation assuming responsibility for children's safety. A group of eight pupils and their teacher were accompanied by two instructors from an outdoor centre on the south coast of [[England]]. As a result of a series of errors, four of the teenagers drowned. The subsequent trial resulted in the prosecution of the parent company and the centre manager. The government initially resisted changing legislation until [[David Jamieson (British politician)|David Jamieson]], the Member of Parliament for Plymouth Devonport, who represented the parents of the children who died, introduced a Private Member's Bill which in January 1995 became the Activity Centres (Young Persons’ Safety) Act 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/Mum-s-anger-plan-scrap-law-brought-Plymouth/story-13537617-detail/story.html |title=Mum's anger at plan to scrap law brought in after four Plymouth children died |publisher=The Herald |date=12 October 2011 |accessdate=28 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015041810/http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/Mum-s-anger-plan-scrap-law-brought-Plymouth/story-13537617-detail/story.html |archive-date=2014-10-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1995 an independent licensing authority, the AALA, was created to bring the act into reality.

The activities within the scope of the licensing scheme are:&lt;ref&gt;Guidance from the Licensing Authority on the Adventure Activities Licensing Regulations 2004 The Activity Centres (Young Persons’ Safety) Act 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[caving]] (except in caves principally used as show-places open to the public)
* [[climbing]] (climbing, traversing, abseiling and scrambling activities except on purpose-built [[climbing wall]]s or abseiling towers)
* [[trekking]] (walking, running, horny trekking, mountain biking, off-piste skiing and related activities when done in moor- or mountain-country above 600 metres and which is remote, i.e. over 30 minutes travelling time from the nearest road or refuge)
* watersports (canoeing, rafting, sailing and related activities when done on the sea, tidal waters or larger non-placid inland waters).

Despite many providers falling outside the legal remit of AALA, the standards are widely regarded as applying to any organisation providing outdoor activities and would probably, according to Marcus Baillie (the head of inspection services) be used as “the standard” in any court case. It is not clear if provision has declined across the country as a consequence of the Act, but risk analysis and management systems appear to have increased. It is fortunate{{why|date=November 2011}} that the head of inspection services and the inspectors all have extensive experience in the field of outdoor education and are typically well respected within the outdoor community.{{cn|date=November 2011}} This adds credibility to AALA and, one{{who|date=November 2011}} hopes, to the field of outdoor education in general. It is difficult to predict the future of AALA and the consequences of this on the field.{{cn|date=November 2011}} One possibility is the expansion of the remit to increase the range of activities covered. Another possibility is to widen the remit to apply to all providers regardless of the age groups with which they work. Further options might be considered for voluntary organisations. This currently looks very unlikely, primarily due to cost. There is also discussion about a non-statutory scheme for those providers who are outside the remit of the licensing scheme, but again cost of implementation is likely to prove prohibitive. There is, not surprisingly, some debate regarding whether AALA has achieved its original aims following the kayaking tragedy (Loynes, 1996). One study, which focused on [[sea kayaking]], suggests that AALA has had almost entirely positive effects on both quality and quantity of provision in sea kayaking (Woolven, 2004). Empirical data on other activities are not yet available and it appears that no one is currently conducting research in this area.

Although the AALA regulations appear to be working well{{cn|date=November 2011}} and are typically well received{{cn|date=November 2011}} they may have added force to the culture of over-protection placing, for example, an increased emphasis on [[safety]] and administration of [[risk assessment]]s as opposed to a deeper discussion on educational practices.{{cn|date=November 2011}}

==Products==
===Broadcast Hardware===
Blackmagic's first and main products have been broadcast video hardware, including live production switchers, real-time compositing processors, Cintel scanners, signal converters, and video monitors. The company then began producing similar products for the filmmaking industry, including cinema cameras and video monitors with integrated recording options.

A '''Business Intelligence Competency Center''' (BICC) is a cross-functional organizational team that has defined tasks, roles, responsibilities and processes for supporting and promoting the effective use of [[Business Intelligence]] (BI) across an organization.

[[Gartner]] started advocating that companies need a BICC to develop and focus resources to be successful using business intelligence in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Strange, K. H., Hostmann, B.  (22 July 2003), BI Competency Center Is Core to BI Success, Gartner Research&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, the BICC concept has been further refined through practical implementations in organizations that have implemented BI and analytical software.

In practice, the term "BICC" is not well integrated into the nomenclature of business or public sector organizations and there are a large degree of variances in the organizational design for BICCs.  Nevertheless, the popularity of the BICC concept has caused the creation of units that focus on ensuring the use of the information for decision-making from BI software and increasing the [[return on investment]]  (ROI) of BI.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G., Queisser, T (2008), The Modern BI Organization, Heidelberg, MaxMetrics GmbH&lt;/ref&gt;

A BICC coordinates the activities and resources to ensure that a fact-based approach to decision making is systematically implemented throughout an organization.  It has responsibility for the governance structure for BI and analytical programs, projects, practices, software, and architecture. It is responsible for building the plans, priorities, infrastructure, and competencies that the organization needs to take forward-looking strategic decisions by using the BI and analytical software capabilities.

A BICC’s influence transcends that of a typical business unit, playing a crucial central role in the organizational change and strategic process.  Accordingly, the BICC’s purpose is to empower the entire organization to coordinate BI from all units.  Through centralization, it "…ensures that information and best practices are communicated and shared through the entire organization so that everyone can benefit from successes and lessons learned."&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G., Bräutigam, B, &amp; Gerlach, S. (2006). Business Intelligence Competency Centers:  A Team Approach to Competitive Advantage. Hoboken: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

The BICC also plays an important organizational role facilitating interaction among the various cultures and units within the organization.  Knowledge transfer, enhancement of analytic skills, coaching and training are central to the mandate of the BICC.  A BICC should be pivotal in ensuring a high degree of information consumption and a ROI for BI.

'''Business Intelligence Competency Centers in U.S. Healthcare'''

Next to the U.S. government, the American [[healthcare industry]] generates the second largest amount of information every year. However, despite having complex information management needs, a KLAS report revealed that one-third of healthcare organizations do not have the appropriate business intelligence tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ashrafi|first1=N|title=The impact of business intelligence on healthcare delivery in the USA.|journal=Interdisciplinary Journal of Information, Knowledge, and Management|date=2014|volume=9|pages=117–130|url=http:// www.ijikm.org/Volume9/IJIKMv9p117-130Ashrafi0761.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since finance and energy industries have successfully implemented business intelligence competency centers (BICCs) and have produced financial returns on their investment and accelerated decision-making speed, the healthcare industry is initiating use of BICCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business analytics returns $13.01 for every dollar spent, up from $10.66 three years ago, Nucleus Research finds.|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/business-analytics-returns-13-01-151800882.html|publisher=Nucleus Research|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creating a business intelligence competency center in healthcare involves prioritizing information needs, creating data governance structures, identifying data stewards to provide data quality assurance, establishing ongoing education programs, and defining predictive modeling, analytics, data warehouse, and cloud storage tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eckert|first1=B.|title=Creating a Business Intelligence Competency Center to Accelerate Healthcare Performance Improvement|url=http://www.beaconpartners.com/resources/topic/white-paper|accessdate=21 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122153145/http://www.beaconpartners.com/resources/topic/white-paper|archivedate=22 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Skills Needed'''

Information technology specialists in SQL design, relational databases, programming, reporting software, and analytics can provide the necessary technical information management skills. Data stewards, such as data analysts and scientists, understand the creation, capture, storage, and access processes needed to ensure high quality data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eckert|first1=B.|title=Why do Healthcare Organizations Need a Business Intelligence Competency Center?|url=http://www.beaconpartners.com/blog/why-healthcare-organizations-need-a-business-intelligence-competency-center-0|publisher=Beacon Partners|accessdate=16 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122153322/http://www.beaconpartners.com/blog/why-healthcare-organizations-need-a-business-intelligence-competency-center-0|archivedate=22 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analytics Competency Center (ACC) ==

In recent years  knowledge-oriented shared service centres with primary focus on offering analytics and data mining as an internal service across the organization have emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=H.J.|date=2015|title=How Big Data Applicaton are Revolutionizing Decision Making|url=|journal=International Journal of Database Theory &amp; Application|volume=20 |issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These centres are often referred to as Analytics Competency Center (ACC), Analytics Center of Excellence, Analytics Service Center, Big Data CoC or Big Data Lab. It is predicated, that by the end of 2017 already a quarter of all large firms will have such a dedicated unit for data and analytics &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3645332?srcId=1-6595640781|title=Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2017: A Gartner Trend Insight Report|last=Cearley|first=David|date=2017|work=Gartner|access-date=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In contrast to classic BICC these centres do not place emphasis on reporting, historical analysis and dashboards. While BICC usually create enterprise-wide data marts and warehouses to establish a foundation for trusted information,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/big-data-analytics-and-the-path-from-insights-to-value/|title=Big Data, Analytics and the Path From Insights to Value|work=MIT Sloan Management Review|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; an ACC follows a more strategic objective. ACCs follow the strategic objective to  transform the company towards a data driven company, build analytics expertise, formulate a data strategy, identify use cases for data mining, establish a manage a platform and drive the general adoption of analytics across the Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronny|first=Schüritz|last2=Ella|first2=Brand|last3=Gerhard|first3=Satzger|last4=Johannes|first4=Bischhoffshausen|date=2017|title=HOW TO CULTIVATE ANALYTICS CAPABILITIES WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION? – DESIGN AND TYPES OF ANALYTICS COMPETENCY CENTERS|url=http://aisel.aisnet.org/ecis2017_rp/26/|journal=Proceedings of the 25th European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS)|language=en|volume=|pages=389–404|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, historically grown BICCs are transformed into an ACC, but also new formations of ACC can be found in practise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28221">The '''California Green Chemistry Initiative''' ('''CGCI''') is a six-part initiative to reduce public and environmental exposure to [[toxin]]s through improved knowledge and regulation of [[chemical]]s; two parts became statute in 2008. The other four parts were not passed, but are still on the agenda of the [[California Department of Toxic Substances Control]] green ribbon science panel discussions. The two parts of the California Green Chemistry Initiative that were passed are known as AB 1879 (Chapter 559, Statutes of 2008): Hazardous Materials and Toxic Substances Evaluation and Regulation and SB 509 (Chapter 560, Statutes of 2008): Toxic Information Clearinghouse. Implementation of CGCI has been delayed indefinitely beyond the January 1, 2011.

== Purpose ==
[[Green chemistry]] is the design of [[chemical products]] and [[Chemical process|processes]] that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of [[hazardous substance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;California Department of Toxic Substances Control, ''Green Chemistry Resources'', Retrieved 03/2011 from http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/GreenChemistryResources/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;  Green chemistry is based upon twelve principles, identified in “Green Chemistry: Theory and Practice” and adopted by the [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref&gt;Anastas, P. T.; Warner, J. C.; Green Chemistry: Theory and Practice, Oxford University Press: New York, 1998, p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an innovative technology which encourages the design of safer chemicals and products and minimizes the impact of wastes through increased [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], the design of chemical products that degrade after use and the use of renewable resources (instead of non-renewable [[fossil fuel]] such as [[petroleum]], [[gas]] and [[coal]]).  The Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT), created under the United States [[Pollution Prevention Act of 1990]], promotes the use of chemistry for [[pollution prevention]] through  voluntary,  non-regulatory ' partnerships with academia, industry, other government agencies, and [[non-governmental organization]]s. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promotes green chemistry as overseen by the OPPT.  The California Green Chemistry Initiative  moves beyond voluntary partnerships and voluntary information disclosure to require industry reporting and public disclosure.

== Overview ==
The United States Environmental Protection Agency’s most important law to regulate the production, use and disposal of chemicals is the [[Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976]] (TSCA). Over the years, TSCA has fallen behind the industry it is supposed to regulate and is an inadequate tool for providing the protection against today’s chemical risks.&lt;ref&gt;Speech by EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson, San Francisco 09/29/2009, Retrieved 03/2011 from    http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/8d49f7ad4bbcf4ef852573590040b7f6/fc4e2a8c05343b3285257640007081c5!OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt;  Green chemistry represents a major [[paradigm shift]] in industrial manufacturing as it is a proactive “cradle-to-cradle” approach that focuses [[environmental protection]] at the design stage of production processes.

In 2008, California governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] signed two joined bills, AB 1879 and SB 507, which created California’s Green Chemistry Initiative (CGCI). AB 1879 increases regulatory authority over chemicals in [[consumer product]]s. The law established an advisory panel of scientists, known as the green ribbon science panel, to guide research in chemical policy, create regulations for assessing alternatives, and set up an internet database of research on toxins.&lt;ref&gt;California Department of Toxic Substance Control, ''Assembly Bill No. 1879, Chapter 559, Health and Safety Code'', Retrieved 03/2011 from   http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/GreenChemistryInitiative/upload/ab_1879_GCI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  SB 509 was designed to ensure that information regarding the hazard traits, toxicological and environmental endpoints, and other vital data is available to the public, to businesses, and to regulators in a Toxics Information Clearinghouse.&lt;ref&gt;California Department of Toxic Substance Control, ''Senate Bill No, 509, Chapter 559, Health and Safety Code'', Retrieved 03/2011 from http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/GreenChemistryInitiative/upload/sb_509_GCI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[legislation]] marks the biggest leap forward in California chemicals policy in nearly two decades and is intended to improve the [[health and safety]] of all Californians by providing the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) with the authority to control toxic substances in consumer products.&lt;ref&gt;Chemicals Policy, ''AB 1879,'' Retrieved 03/2011 from  http://www.chemicalspolicy.org/legislationdocs/California/CA_AB1879.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The bills were scheduled to go into regulatory affect January 1, 2011 with the adoption of the Green Chemistry Initiative. California has postponed the initiative, indefinitely, due to concerns raised by [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s and more specifically, controversial last minute changes in the final draft.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson Hine Environmental Law Group,''California Postpones Adoption of Proposed Green Chemistry Initiative'', Retrieved 03/2011 from  http://www.thompsonhine.com/publications/pdf/2011/01/greenproductsupdate2224.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The final or third draft contains substantial revisions, including scaled back manufacturer and retailer [[Environmental compliance|compliance]] requirements that were not well received by the environmental community. Assemblyman Mike Feur and several authors of AB 1879, assert that last minute changes by the California DTSC have drastically weakened the Green Chemistry Initiative and limited its scope.&lt;ref&gt;Green Biz News,''California Green Chemistry Backers Cry Foul at Last Minute Changes'', Retrieved 03/2011 from http://www.greenbiz.com/news/2010/12/27/ca-green-chemistry-backers-cry-foul-last-minute-changes&lt;/ref&gt;  They are most concerned with the change to require the state to prove that a chemical is harmful before being regulated, mirroring what is currently required at the Federal level by TSCA. The original draft advocated a precautionary principle, or “cradle-to-cradle” approach.&lt;ref&gt;California Department of Toxic Substances Control, ''Green Chemistry Initiative'', Retrieved 03/2011 from   
http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/GreenChemistryInitiative/upload/sb_509_GCI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Environmentalist]]s fear that CGCI will not remove chemicals off the shelves, but instead will create “paralysis by analysis” as companies litigate against the DTSC over unfavorable decisions.&lt;ref&gt;LA Weekly Online, ''Schwarzeneggers Chemical Romance'', Retrieved 03/2011 from http://www.laweekly.com/2010-12-09/news/schwarzenegger-s-chemical-romance/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical and social causes  ==

=== Traditional methods of dealing with wastes ===
Society historically managed its industrial and municipal wastes by disposal or [[incineration]]. Chemical regulation occurs only after a product is identified as hazardous. This problem-specific approach has led to the release of thousands of potentially harmful chemicals in our environment.&lt;ref&gt;California Department of Toxic Substance Control, ''Green Chemistry'', Retrieved 03/2011 from http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/GreenChemistryResources/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;  Chemical regulation is a continuous game of catch up, in which banned chemicals are replaced with new chemicals that may be just as or more toxic. Many environmental laws are still based on the industrial production model of cradle-to-grave. The term “cradle-to-grave” is used to describe and assess the life-cycle of products, from [[raw material]] extraction through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use and disposal. This traditional approach to chemicals management has serious environmental drawbacks because it does not consider what happens to a product after it is disposed of. The [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA) of 1976, exemplifies a cradle-to-grave management approach of hazardous waste. RCRA has been largely ineffective because its emphasis is on dealing with waste after it has been created; meanwhile emphasis on [[waste reduction]] is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;California Department of Toxic Substance Control, ''Green Chemistry'', Retrieved 03/2011 from http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/GreenChemistryResources/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;   Waste does not disappear, it is simply transported elsewhere. Costly and burdensome [[hazardous waste]] disposal in the US has encouraged the exportation of hazardous waste to poor counties and developing nations willing to accept the waste for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, J. &amp; Thompson, B.H. 2010. Environmental Law and Policy, 3rd edition. New York: Foundation Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Chemistry initiative instead employs a cradle-to-cradle approach, representing a major paradigm shift in environmental policy and provides a proactive solution to toxic waste. The Earth’s capacity to accept toxic waste is practically nonexistent. The disposal of hazardous wastes is not the root problem but rather, the root symptom. The critical issue is the creation of toxic wastes.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul. 1993. The Ecology of Commerce. Harper-Collins Publishers. New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;  Requiring manufacturers to consider chemical exposure during manufacturing, throughout product use and after disposal, encourages the production of safer products.

=== Consumption and wastes ===
By the time we find a product on a market shelf, 90% of the resources used to create that product was regarded as waste.&lt;ref&gt;Presentation at SFSU by Crisitine Lueng, Natural Resource Defense Council, March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  This accounts for about 136 pounds of resources a week consumed by the average American and 2,000 pounds of waste support that consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul. 1993. The Ecology of Commerce. Harper-Collins Publishers. New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the population grows and the economy expands more and more products will be created, consumed, and disposed. Many negative externalities are related to the environmental consequences of production and use, including [[air pollution]], [[anthropogenic climate change]] and [[water pollution]]. Under the current cycle of production, toxic chemical byproducts will continue to be produced and unleashed on our environment. It is important to carefully consider how toxic wastes are created in order to forgo the possibility of a world that is unsuitable for human life.

=== Transparency issues ===
One of the biggest failures in market transactions is the imbalance of information that is provided to consumer via producer. “[[Information asymmetry]]” is an economic concept that is used to explain this failure: it deals with the study of decisions in transactions where one party has more or better information than the other. Due to a lack of information transparency, the public may lack vital information about the health and safety of products found on [[supermarket]] shelves. This lack of information may have led to a reversed purchasing decision. Yet without such labeling, consumers must make assumptions based on things like price or expertise. For example, one [[apple juice]] brand may be assumed healthier because it cost more and because the brand is advertised as “healthy” and “recommended by mothers”. Further, it may be assumed that the product is safe for consumption if it is sitting on a [[grocery store]] shelf and probably would not be approved by the government if it contained harmful chemicals. Assumptions such as these could inform a typical purchasing decision, despite their inaccuracy. Perhaps given more information, the same brand of apple juice would be less desirable if information on unhealthy preservatives, [[Food additive|additive]]s or pesticide residues was easily obtained. To make market transactions more efficient, the government could force more accurate labeling about products, laws could require companies to be more transparent, and the government could require that advertising be less persuasive and more informative.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 03/2011 from http://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Market_failures/Information_failure.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The Green Chemistry Initiative of California would address transparency issues by creating a public chemical inventory and requiring more stringent regulation of chemicals that may be toxic. The CGCI Draft Report suggests a green labeling system to identify consumer products with ingredients harmful to human health and the environment.

=== Stakeholder involvement ===
The United States is the world leader in chemicals manufacturing. As a multibillion-dollar industry, the chemical industry has a leading role in the [[US economy]] and because of this, a high level of influence in federal decision-making. Central to the modern [[world economy]], it converts raw materials ([[oil]], [[natural gas]], air, water, metals, and minerals) into more than 70,000 different products.&lt;ref&gt;2005. Sustainability in the Chemical Industry: Grand Challenges and Research Needs - A Workshop Report, Committee on Grand Challenges for Sustainability in the Chemical Industry, National Research Council, The National Academies Press: Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt;  The chemical industry—producers of chemicals, household cleansers, plastics, [[rubber]], [[paint]]s and [[explosive]]s, keeps a watchful eye on issues including environmental and health policy, taxes and trade. The industry is often the target of environmental groups, which charge that chemicals and chemical waste are polluting the air and water supply. And like most industries with [[pollution]] problems, chemical manufacturers oppose meddlesome government regulations that make it more difficult and expensive for them to do business. So do most [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], which is why this industry gives nearly three-fourths of its campaign contributions to the GOP.&lt;ref&gt;''Chemical Industry Lobbying in Washington'', Retrieved 03/2011 from http://www.thetruthaboutdow.org/article.php?id=76&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to campaign contributions to elected officials and candidates, companies, labor unions, and other organizations spend billions of dollars each year to lobby Congress and federal agencies. Some special interests retain [[lobbying]] firms, many of them located along Washington's legendary [[K Street (Washington, D.C.)|K Street]]; others have lobbyists working in-house.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 03/2011 from http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/issuesum.php?lname=Chemical+Industry&amp;year=2010&lt;/ref&gt;

According to website ''[[Opensecrets]],'' the total number of clients lobbying for the chemical industry in 2010 was 143, which is the highest number in history. The first group on this list, [[American Chemistry Council]] spent $8,130,000 lobbying last year and Crop America, which comes second, spent $2,291,859 lobbying last year, [[FMC Corporation]] spent $1,230,000 and [[Koch Industries]] spent $8,070,000.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 03/2011 from http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/issuesum.php?lname=Chemical+Industry&amp;year=2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chemical Industry wants limited testing of chemicals, more lengthy and costly studies of chemicals already proven to be dangerous, and an assumption that we are only exposed to one chemical at a time, and from one source at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 03/2011 from http://www.saferchemicals.org/2010/09/new-polling-data-indicates-overwhelming-public-support-for-chemicals-regulation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families,'' a broad coalition of groups, including major environmental organizations like the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] and the [[Environmental Defense Fund]], health organizations like the Learning Disabilities Association, Breast Cancer Fund, and the [[Autism Society of America]], health professionals and providers like the [[American Nurses Association]], [[Planned Parenthood|Planned Parenthood Federation of America]], and the Mt. Sinai Children's Environmental Health Center, and concerned parents groups like MomsRising: there is growing national momentum and pressure to change the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), our federal system for overseeing chemical safety, which has not been updated in thirty-five years.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 03/2011 from http://www.saferchemicals.org/2010/09/new-polling-data-indicates-overwhelming-public-support-for-chemicals-regulation.html&lt;/ref&gt; Polling data indicates overwhelming support for chemical regulation nationwide. According to polling data conducted by the Mellman Group, 84% say that "tightening controls" on chemical regulation is important, with 50% of those calling it "very important.”&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 03/2011 from http://www.saferchemicals.org/2010/09/new-polling-data-indicates-overwhelming-public-support-for-chemicals-regulation.html&lt;/ref&gt; Public Health Advocates want public disclosure of safety information for all chemicals in use, prompt action to phase out or reduce the most dangerous chemicals, deciding safety based on real world exposure to all sources of toxic chemicals.

== History ==
In 2008, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed two state bills authorizing the state to identify toxic chemicals in industry and consumer products and analyze alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Green Biz, ''California Green Chemistry Backers Cry Foul at Last Minute Changes,'' Retrieved 03/2011 from http://www.greenbiz.com/news/2010/12/27/ca-green-chemistry-backers-cry-foul-last-minute-changes&lt;/ref&gt;  AB 1879, written by Assemblyman Mike Feur, a Los Angeles Democrat,  requires the state Department of Toxic Substances Control to assess chemicals and prioritize the most toxic for possible restrictions or bans. The environmental policy council, made up of heads of all state environmental protection agency boards and departments will oversee the program. SB 509, by Senator [[Joe Simitian]], a [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], creates an online toxics information clearinghouse with information about the hazards of thousands of chemicals used in California. These bills are intended to put an end to chemical-by-chemical bans and remove harmful products at the design stage.  The regulations are expected to motivate manufacturers of consumer products containing chemicals of concern to seek safer alternatives.

Supporters of the bill include the California Association of Professional Scientists, the Chemical Industry Council of California, [[DuPont]], BIOCOM, [[Grocery Manufacturers Association]], the Breast Cancer Fund, [[Catholic Healthcare West]], in addition to a broad array of environmental groups such as the Coalition for Clean Air, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council.  The [[American Electronics Association]] (AEA) and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] spoke in opposition to the bill, each requesting an exemption from its provisions.&lt;ref&gt;Californians Against Waste, 2007-08 Legislation Archives, Retrieved 03/2011 from http://www.cawrecycles.org/issues/current_legislation/ab1879_08&lt;/ref&gt;  Also opposing were environmental justice advocates who indicated the bill did not go far enough. Meanwhile, large trade associations such as [[Household &amp; Commercial Products Association|Consumer Specialty Products Association]], [[Western States Petroleum Association]], [[American Chemistry Council]], CA Manufacturers and Technology Association, and [[California Chamber of Commerce|CA Chamber of Commerce]] officially withdrew opposition to the measures.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 03/2011 from http://www.cicc.org/doc.asp?id=1666&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to outdated and inefficient or otherwise voluntary chemical regulation at the Federal level, the State of California has decided to take regulation into its own hands and develop stricter, environmentally-informed methodologies for dealing with the production of toxic wastes. California's [[economy]] is the largest of any state in the US, and is the eighth largest economy in the world.&lt;ref&gt;"Largest state GDPs in the United States - California Texas New York Florida". EconPost.com. November 11, 2009. http://econpost.com/unitedstateseconomy/largest-state-gdps-united-states-california-texas-new-york-florida. Retrieved March 9, 2011 "California economy ranking among world economies". EconPost.com. November 8, 2009.0. http://econpost.com/californiaeconomy/california-economy-ranking-among-world-economies. Retrieved March 9, 2010.0.&lt;/ref&gt;  This position gives California an advantage when it comes to environmental standards: the impact of chemical regulation statewide can have a broader impact nationwide if manufacturers desire to stay competitive in California’s market. The Green Chemistry Initiative forces statewide industries to comply with greener standards of production, which may spark innovation on a wider basis.

The Green Chemistry initiative aims to regulate the creation and use of materials hazardous to human health and the environment by encouraging innovative design and manufacturing, and ultimately safer consumer product alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;California Department of Toxic Substance Control, '' Green Chemistry,'' Retrieved 03/2011 from  http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/GreenChemistryResources/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;  To develop the regulatory framework, DTSC held a number of stakeholder and public workshops and invited direct public participation in the drafting of regulations on a [[wiki]] website.  DTSC reportedly received over 57,000 comments and over 800 regulatory suggestions. Regulatory suggestions included industry assessments of risk and safety, alternative chemicals and life-cycle assessments and mandatory industry reporting, full public disclosure of substances contained in products, a [[green labelling]] program that would inform consumers of the potential health and environmental impacts of the chemicals contained in products and a mandated [[fee|surcharge]] on chemicals and products to support a fund to address environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;California Department of Toxic Substances Control, ''California Green Chemistry Initiative, Phase Two: Recommendations Report,''
Retrieved 04/2011 from http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/GreenChemistryInitiative/upload/CGCI-Appendices.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, DTSC announced six policy recommendations for the Green Chemistry Initiative.  In brief, those recommendations are:&lt;ref&gt;California Department of Toxic Substance Control, ''Final Report of Green Chemistry Initiative,'' Retrieved 03/2011 from  http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/GreenChemistryInitiative/upload/GREEN_Chem.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
#	expand pollution prevention
#	develop green chemistry workforce education and training, research and development, technology transfer
#	online product ingredient network
#	online toxics clearing house
# 	accelerate the quest for safer products
#	move toward cradle to cradle economy

Two of the six recommendations from this report were adopted: AB 1879 requires the DTSC to implement regulations to identify and prioritize chemicals of concern, evaluate alternatives, and specify regulatory responses where chemicals are found in products. SB 509 requires an online, public toxics information clearinghouse that includes science-based information on the toxicity and hazard traits of chemicals used in daily life. Essentially the recommended policy methods include authority tools that would regulate the approval on new chemicals in a more cautious manner as well as mandate the decimation of information, as provided by manufacturers to the public; innovation would be encouraged under this paradigm to replace harmful chemicals with greener alternatives and the California government would fund programs to help industries produce greener chemicals. Secondly, capacity or learning tools would be provided to the public in the form of the online database, giving the tools so that they have better ability to make market decisions that reflect their interests.

== Criticism ==
Environmentalists say the amended regulations won't remove toxic products from the shelves and will create "[[paralysis by analysis]]," as industries can litigate against DTSC over unfavorable department decisions. Activists say California was poised to lead the way on toxics regulation but now is faced with potentially one of the weakest chemical-regulatory mechanisms in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;LA Weekly, ''Schwartzeneggers Chemical Romance,'' Retrieved 03/2011 from http://www.laweekly.com/2010-12-09/news/schwarzenegger-s-chemical-romance/&lt;/ref&gt;  According to CHANGE (Californians for a Healthy &amp; Green Economy), the revised regulation is a betrayal of the Green Chemistry promise and ignores two years of public input, while caving to backroom industry lobbying. Furthermore, it is a betrayal to [[public interest]] groups, businesses, and residents of California and legislators who supported the intent of this bill, to protect Californians and spur a healthy, innovative [[green economy]]. Environmentalists say the toxics department gutted the initiative at the behest of the chemical industry, and then put out the changes for public comment during a 15-day period just before [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]].

[[File:FSboomerang.JPG|thumb|right|220 px|An example of a color magazine or "boomerang"]] A '''color magazine''' is a fixture attached to a [[follow spot]] that places different color filters in the path of the beam. Instead of working with comparatively cumbersome [[color gel|gel]] frames, the color magazine allows the spot operator to easily slide color frames in or out of place using a series of levers.

The term '''boomerang''' is also used to describe a color magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''Cryo-preservation''' or '''cryo-conservation''' is a process where [[organelle]]s, [[cell (biology)|cells]], [[Biological tissue|tissues]], [[extracellular matrix]], [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] or any other biological constructs susceptible to damage caused by unregulated [[chemical kinetics]] are preserved by cooling to very low [[temperature]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pegg |first=David E. |date=January 1, 2007 |title=Principles of cryopreservation|journal=Methods in Molecular Biology |location=Clifton, N.J. |volume=368 |pages=39–57 |doi=10.1007/978-1-59745-362-2_3 |issn=1064-3745 |pmid=18080461}}&lt;/ref&gt; (typically −80&amp;nbsp;°C using solid [[carbon dioxide]] or −196&amp;nbsp;°C using [[liquid nitrogen]]). At low enough temperatures, any [[Enzyme|enzymatic]] or chemical activity which might cause damage to the biological material in question is effectively stopped. Cryopreservation methods seek to reach low temperatures without causing additional damage caused by the formation of ice crystals during freezing. Traditional cryopreservation has relied on coating the material to be frozen with a class of molecules termed [[cryoprotectants]]. New methods are constantly being investigated due to the inherent [[toxicity]] of many cryoprotectants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sambu |first=Sammy |date=June 25, 2015 |title=A Bayesian approach to optimizing cryopreservation protocols |url=https://peerj.com/articles/1039/#results-and-discussion |journal=PeerJ |language=en |volume=3 |doi=10.7717/peerj.1039 |issn=2167-8359 |pmc=4485240 |pmid=26131379 |pages=e1039}}&lt;/ref&gt; By default it should be considered that cryopreservation alters or compromises  [[Cell (biology)#Cellular processes|the structure and function of cells]] unless it is proven otherwise for a particular cell population. [[Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources]] is the process in which animal genetic material is collected and stored with the intention of conservation of the breed.

== Natural cryopreservation ==

[[Water bear|Water-bears]] (''[[Tardigrada]]''), microscopic multicellular organisms, can survive [[freezing]] by replacing most of their internal water with the [[sugar]] [[trehalose]], preventing it from crystallization that otherwise damages [[cell membranes]]. Mixtures of solutes can achieve similar effects. Some solutes, including salts, have the disadvantage that they may be toxic at intense concentrations. In addition to the water-bear, wood frogs can tolerate the freezing of their blood and other tissues. Urea is accumulated in tissues in preparation for overwintering, and liver glycogen is converted in large quantities to glucose in response to internal ice formation. Both urea and glucose act as "cryoprotectants" to limit the amount of ice that forms and to reduce [[osmotic]] shrinkage of cells. Frogs can survive many freeze/thaw events during winter if no more than about 65% of the total body water freezes. Research exploring the phenomenon of "freezing frogs" has been performed primarily by the Canadian researcher, Dr. [[Kenneth B. Storey]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

'''Freeze tolerance''', in which organisms survive the winter by freezing solid and ceasing life functions, is known in a few vertebrates: five species of frogs (''[[Rana sylvatica]]'', ''[[Pseudacris triseriata]]'', ''[[Hyla crucifer]]'', ''[[Hyla versicolor]]'', ''[[Hyla chrysoscelis]]''), one of salamanders (''[[Hynobius]] keyserlingi''), one of snakes (''[[Thamnophis sirtalis]]'') and three of turtles (''[[Chrysemys picta]]'', ''[[Terrapene carolina]]'', ''[[Terrapene ornata]]'').&lt;ref name=AJP1991 /&gt; Snapping turtles ''[[Chelydra serpentina]]'' and wall lizards ''[[Podarcis muralis]]'' also survive nominal freezing but it has not been established to be adaptive for overwintering. In the case of ''Rana sylvatica'' one cryopreservant is ordinary glucose, which increases in concentration by approximately 19&amp;nbsp;mmol/l when the frogs are cooled slowly.&lt;ref name=AJP1991&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.units.muohio.edu/cryolab/publications/documents/CostanzoLeeWright91AJP.pdf|title=Glucose loading prevents freezing injury in rapidly cooled wood frogs|author=Jon P. Costanzo|author2=Richard E. Lee|author3=Michael F. Wright|date=1991|journal=American Journal of Physiology|pages=R1549–R1553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
One of the most important early theoreticians of cryopreservation was [[James Lovelock]]. He suggested that damage to [[red blood cell]]s during freezing was due to [[osmosis|osmotic]] stress. During the early 1950s, Lovelock had also suggested that increasing salt concentrations in a cell as it dehydrates to lose water to the external ice might cause damage to the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mazur P |title=Cryobiology: the freezing of biological systems |journal=Science |date=1970 |pages=939–49 |volume=168 |issue=3934 |pmid=5462399 |doi=10.1126/science.168.3934.939 |bibcode=1970Sci...168..939M}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1950s, he experimented with the cryopreservation of rodents, determining that hamsters could be frozen with 60% of the water in the brain crystallized into ice with no adverse effects. Other organs were shown to be susceptible to damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The Cryobiological Case for Cryonics|magazine=Cryonics|page=27|date=March 1988|volume=9(3)|issue=92|publisher=[[Alcor Life Extension Foundation]]|url=https://www.alcor.org/cryonics/cryonics8803.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryopreservation was applied to humans beginning in 1954 with three pregnancies resulting from the insemination of previously frozen sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fatherhood After Death Has Now Been Proved Possible|newspaper=Cedar Rapids Gazette|date=April 9, 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fowl sperm was cryopreserved in 1957 by a team of scientists in the UK directed by [[Christopher Polge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1957.0068 |author=Polge C |title=Low-Temperature Storage of Mammalian Spermatozoa |journal=Royal Society of London |date=1957 |pages=498–508 |volume=147 |issue=929 |bibcode=1957RSPSB.147..498P}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rapid immersion of the samples in [[liquid nitrogen]] did not, for certain samples – such as some types of embryos, bone marrow and stem cells – produce the necessary viability to make them usable after thawing. Increased understanding of the mechanism of freezing injury to cells emphasised the importance of controlled or slow cooling to obtain maximum survival on thawing of the living cells. A controlled-rate cooling process, allowing biological samples to equilibrate to optimal physical parameters osmotically in a cryoprotectant (a form of anti-freeze) before cooling in a predetermined, controlled way proved necessary. The ability of cryoprotectants, in the early cases glycerol, to protect cells from freezing injury was discovered accidentally. Freezing injury has two aspects: direct damage from the ice crystals and secondary damage caused by the increase in concentration of solutes as progressively more ice is formed. During 1963, Peter Mazur, at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in the U.S., demonstrated that lethal intracellular freezing could be avoided if cooling was slow enough to permit sufficient water to leave the cell during progressive freezing of the extracellular fluid. That rate differs between cells of differing size and water permeability: a typical cooling rate around 1&amp;nbsp;°C/minute is appropriate for many mammalian cells after treatment with cryoprotectants such as glycerol or dimethyl sulphoxide, but the rate is not a universal optimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.cell.com/biophysj/pdf/S0006-3495(63)86824-1.pdf |pmc=1366450|year=1963|last1=Mazur|first1=P.|title=Studies on Rapidly Frozen Suspensions of Yeast Cells by Differential Thermal Analysis and Conductometry|journal=Biophysical Journal|volume=3|issue=4|pages=323–353|pmid=13934216|bibcode=1963BpJ.....3..323M|doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(63)86824-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temperature==
Storage at very low temperatures is presumed to provide an indefinite longevity to cells, although the actual effective life is rather difficult to prove. Researchers experimenting with dried seeds found that there was noticeable variability of deterioration when samples were kept at different temperatures – even ultra-cold temperatures. Temperatures less than the [[glass transition point]] (Tg) of [[polyol]]'s water solutions, around {{Convert|-136|C|K F|0}}, seem to be accepted as the range where [[Metabolism|biological activity]] very substantially slows, and {{Convert|-196|C|K F|0}}, the boiling point of [[liquid nitrogen]], is the preferred temperature for storing important specimens. While [[refrigerator]]s, freezers and extra-cold freezers are used for many items, generally the ultra-cold of liquid nitrogen is required for successful preservation of the more complex biological structures to virtually stop all biological activity.

== Risks ==

[[Phenomena]] which can cause damage to cells during cryopreservation mainly occur during the freezing stage, and include: solution effects, [[extracellular]] ice formation, dehydration and [[intracellular]] ice formation. Many of these effects can be reduced by [[cryoprotectant]]s.
Once the preserved material has become frozen, it is relatively safe from further damage. However, estimates based on the accumulation of radiation-induced DNA damage during cryonic storage have suggested a maximum storage period of 1000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1957.0068 |author=Mazur P |title=Freezing of living cells: mechanisms and implications |journal=American Journal of Physiology |date=1984 |pages=C125-42 |volume=247 |issue=3 Pt 1 |bibcode=1957RSPSB.147..498P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Solution effects: As ice crystals grow in freezing water, solutes are excluded, causing them to become concentrated in the remaining liquid water. High concentrations of some solutes can be very damaging.

; Extracellular ice formation: When tissues are cooled slowly, water migrates out of [[cell (biology)|cells]] and [[ice]] forms in the extracellular space. Too much extracellular ice can cause mechanical damage to the cell membrane due to crushing.

; Dehydration: Migration of water, causing extracellular ice formation, can also cause cellular dehydration. The associated stresses on the cell can cause damage directly.

; Intracellular ice formation: While some [[organism]]s and [[biological tissue|tissues]] can tolerate some extracellular ice, any appreciable intracellular ice is almost always fatal to cells.

==Main methods to prevent risks==
The main techniques to prevent cryopreservation damages are a well established combination of ''controlled rate and slow freezing'' and a newer flash-freezing process known as ''vitrification''.

===Slow programmable freezing===
[[Image:Liquid nitrogen tank.JPG|thumb|150px|A tank of [[liquid nitrogen]], used to supply a cryogenic freezer (for storing laboratory samples at a temperature of about −150&amp;nbsp;°C)]]
''Controlled-rate and slow freezing'', also known as ''slow programmable freezing (SPF)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vutyavanich T|author2=Piromlertamorn W|author3=Nunta S |title=Rapid freezing versus slow programmable freezing of human spermatozoa |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=93 |issue=6 |pages=1921–8 |date=April 2010 |pmid=19243759 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.04.076}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a set of well established techniques developed during the early 1970s which enabled the first human [[embryo]] frozen birth Zoe Leyland during 1984. Since then, machines that freeze biological samples using programmable sequences, or controlled rates, have been used all over the world for human, animal and cell biology – "freezing down" a sample to better preserve it for eventual thawing, before it is frozen, or cryopreserved, in liquid nitrogen. Such machines are used for freezing oocytes, skin, blood products, embryo, sperm, stem cells and general tissue preservation in hospitals, veterinary practices and research laboratories around the world. As an example, the number of live births from frozen embryos 'slow frozen' is estimated at some 300,000 to 400,000 or 20% of the estimated 3 million in vitro fertilisation ([[IVF]]) births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bionews.org.uk/commentary.lasso?storyid=4055 |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20090526093911/http://www.bionews.org.uk/commentary.lasso?storyid=4055 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-05-26 |title=dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lethal intracellular freezing can be avoided if cooling is slow enough to permit sufficient water to leave the cell during progressive freezing of the extracellular fluid. To minimize the growth of extracellular ice crystal growth and recrystallization,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Deller |first=Robert C. |last2=Vatish |first2=Manu |last3=Mitchell |first3=Daniel A. |last4=Gibson |first4=Matthew I. |date=February 3, 2014 |title=Synthetic polymers enable non-vitreous cellular cryopreservation by reducing ice crystal growth during thawing |url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140203/ncomms4244/full/ncomms4244.html?message-global=remove&amp;WT.ec_id=NCOMMS-20140205 |journal=Nature Communications |language=en |volume=5 |pages=3244 |doi=10.1038/ncomms4244 |pmid=24488146|bibcode=2014NatCo...5E3244D }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[biomaterial]]s such as [[alginate]]s, [[polyvinyl alcohol]] or [[chitosan]] can be used to impede ice crystal growth along with traditional small molecule cryoprotectants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sambu |first=Sammy |date=June 25, 2015 |title=A Bayesian approach to optimizing cryopreservation protocols |url=https://peerj.com/articles/1039/ |journal=PeerJ |language=en |volume=3 |doi=10.7717/peerj.1039 |issn=2167-8359 |pmc=4485240 |pmid=26131379 |pages=e1039}}&lt;/ref&gt; That rate differs between cells of differing size and water [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]]: a typical cooling rate of about 1&amp;nbsp;°C/minute is appropriate for many mammalian cells after treatment with [[cryoprotectant]]s such as [[glycerol]] or [[dimethyl sulfoxide]], but the rate is not a universal optimum. The 1&amp;nbsp;°C / minute rate can be achieved by using devices such as a rate-controlled freezer or a benchtop portable freezing container.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thompson M|author2=Nemits M|author3=Ehrhardt R |title=Rate-controlled Cryopreservation and Thawing of Mammalian Cells |journal=Protocol Exchange |date=May 2011 |doi=10.1038/protex.2011.224 |url=http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/protocols/2085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several independent studies have provided evidence that frozen embryos stored using slow-freezing techniques may in some ways be 'better' than fresh in IVF. The studies indicate that using frozen embryos and eggs rather than fresh embryos and eggs reduced the risk of stillbirth and premature delivery though the exact reasons are still being explored.

===Vitrification===&lt;!--Section linked from [[vitrification]]--&gt;
Researchers [[Greg Fahy]] and William F. Rall helped to introduce vitrification to reproductive cryopreservation in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="vitrification origination"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rall |first=WF |author2=Fahy, GM |title=Ice-free cryopreservation of mouse embryos at −196 degrees C by vitrification |journal=Nature |date=February 14–20, 1985 |volume=313 |issue=6003 |pages=573–5 |pmid=3969158 |bibcode=1985Natur.313..573R |doi=10.1038/313573a0}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 October 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2000, researchers claim vitrification provides the benefits of cryopreservation without damage due to ice crystal formation.&lt;ref name="cryonics 2000"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.alcor.org/cryonics/cryonics2000-4.pdf |title=Alcor: The Origin of Our Name |accessdate=August 25, 2009 |date=Winter 2000 |publisher=Alcor Life Extension Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation became more complex with the development of tissue engineering as both cells and biomaterials need to remain ice-free to preserve high cell viability and functions, integrity of constructs and structure of biomaterials. Vitrification of tissue engineered constructs was first reported by Lilia Kuleshova,&lt;ref name=Kuleshova&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuleshova |first1=L L |last2=Wang |first2=XW |last3=Wu |first3=YN |last4=Zhou |first4=Y |last5=Yu |first5=H |title=Vitrification of encapsulated hepatocytes with reduced cooling and warming rates |journal=Cryo Letters |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=241–254 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; who also was the first scientist to achieve vitrification of woman’s eggs (oocytes), which resulted in live birth in 1999.&lt;ref name="Kuleshova1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuleshova |first1=Lilia |last2=Gianoroli |first2=Luca |last3=Magli |first3=Cristina |last4=Ferraretti |first4=Anna |last5=Trounson |first5=Alan |doi=10.1093/humrep/14.12.3077 |title=Birth following vitrification of small number of human oocytes |journal=Human Reproduction |volume=14 |issue=12 |pages=3077–3079 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; For clinical cryopreservation, vitrification usually requires the addition of [[cryoprotectant]]s prior to cooling. The cryoprotectants act like [[antifreeze]]: they decrease the freezing temperature. They also increase the viscosity. Instead of [[crystal]]lizing, the syrupy solution becomes an [[amorphous ice]]—it ''vitrifies''. Rather than a phase change from liquid to solid by crystallization, the amorphous state is like a "solid liquid", and the transformation is over a small temperature range described as the "[[glass transition]]" temperature.

Vitrification of water is promoted by rapid cooling, and can be achieved without cryoprotectants by an extremely rapid decrease of temperature (megakelvins per second). The rate that is required to attain glassy state in pure water was considered to be impossible until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bhat SN |author2=Sharma A |author3=Bhat SV |title=Vitrification and glass transition of water: insights from spin probe ESR |journal=Phys Rev Lett |date=2005 |pages=235702 |volume=95 |issue=23 |pmid=16384318 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.235702 |bibcode=2005PhRvL..95w5702B |arxiv=cond-mat/0409440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two conditions usually required to allow vitrification are an increase of the viscosity and a decrease of the freezing temperature. Many solutes do both, but larger molecules generally have a larger effect, particularly on viscosity. Rapid cooling also promotes vitrification.

For established methods of cryopreservation, the solute must penetrate the cell membrane in order to achieve increased viscosity and decrease freezing temperature inside the cell. Sugars do not readily permeate through the membrane. Those solutes that do, such as [[dimethyl sulfoxide]], a common cryoprotectant, are often toxic in intense concentration. One of the difficult compromises of vitrifying cryopreservation concerns limiting the damage produced by the cryoprotectant itself due to cryoprotectant toxicity. Mixtures of cryoprotectants and the use of ice blockers have enabled the [[Twenty-First Century Medicine]] company to vitrify a [[rabbit]] [[kidney]] to −135&amp;nbsp;°C with their proprietary vitrification mixture. Upon rewarming, the kidney was transplanted successfully into a rabbit, with complete functionality and viability, able to sustain the rabbit indefinitely as the sole functioning kidney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4161/org.5.3.9974 |display-authors=4 |author=Fahy GM |author2=Wowk B |author3=Pagotan R |author4=Chang A |author5=Phan J |author6=Thomson B |author7=Phan L |title=Physical and biological aspects of renal vitrification |journal=Organogenesis |volume=5 |issue=3 |date=2009 |pages=167–175 |pmc=2781097 |pmid=20046680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Freezable tissues ==

Generally, cryopreservation is easier for thin samples and small clumps of individual cells, because these can be cooled more quickly and so require lesser doses of [[toxic]] cryoprotectants. Therefore, cryopreservation of human [[liver]]s and [[heart]]s for storage and [[Organ transplant|transplant]] is still impractical.

Nevertheless, suitable combinations of cryoprotectants and regimes of cooling and rinsing during warming often allow the successful cryopreservation of biological materials, particularly cell suspensions or thin tissue samples. Examples include:
* [[Semen]] in [[semen cryopreservation]]
* [[Blood]]
** Special cells for transfusion
** [[Stem cell]]s. It is optimal in high concentration of synthetic serum, stepwise equilibration and slow cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=4|author=Lee JY|author2=Lee JE|author3=Kim DK|author4=Yoon TK|author5=Chung HM|author6=Lee DR |title=High concentration of synthetic serum, stepwise equilibration and slow cooling as an efficient technique for large-scale cryopreservation of human embryonic stem cells |journal=Fertil.

** [[Umbilical cord blood]] ''Further information: [[Cord blood bank#Cryopreservation]]''
* Tissue samples like [[tumor]]s and [[Histology|histological cross sections]]
* Eggs ([[oocyte]]s) in [[oocyte cryopreservation]]
* [[Embryos]] at cleavage stage (that are 2, 4 or 8 cells) or at blastocyst stage, in [[embryo cryopreservation]]
* [[Ovarian tissue]] in [[ovarian tissue cryopreservation]]
* [[Plant]] seeds or shoots may be cryopreserved for [[conservation biology|conservation]] purposes.

Additionally, efforts are underway to preserve humans cryogenically, known as [[cryonics]]. For such efforts either the brain within the head or the entire body may experience the above process. Cryonics is in a different category from the aforementioned examples, however: while countless cryopreserved cells, vaccines, tissue and other biologial samples have been thawed and used successfully, this has not yet been the case at all for cryopreserved brains or bodies. At issue are the criteria for defining "success". Proponents of cryonics claim that cryopreservation using present technology, particularly vitrification of the brain, may be sufficient to preserve people in an "[[information theoretical death|information theoretic]]" sense so that they could be revived and made whole by hypothetical vastly advanced future technology. Not only is there no guarantee of its success, many people argue that human cryopreservation is unethical. According to certain views of the mind body problem, some philosophers believe that the mind, which contains thoughts, memories, and personality, is separate from the brain. When someone dies, their mind leaves the body. If a cryopreserved patient gets successfully resuscitated, no one knows if they would be the same person that they once were or if they would be an empty shell of the memory of who they once were. Right now scientists are trying to see if transplanting cryopreserved human organs for transplantation is viable, if so this would be a major step forward for the possibility of reviving a cryopreserved human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devlin|first1=Hannah|title=Cryonics: Does It Offer Humanity a Chance to Return from the Dead?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/18/cryogenics-does-it-offer-humanity-a-chance-to-return-from-the-dead|website=thegaurdian.com|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embryos=== &lt;!--Embryo storage redirects here--&gt;
{{Main|Embryo cryopreservation}}
Cryopreservation for embryos is used for embryo storage, e.g., when [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) has resulted in more embryos than is currently needed.

Pregnancies have been reported from embryos stored for 16 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planer.com/PlanerComWebsite.nsf/7dc62b5d9e44dd40802575460048fc4e/76a07726303dac468025757d005b004d?OpenDocument Planer NEWS and Press Releases &gt; 'Twins' born 16 years apart.]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} January 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies have evaluated the children born from frozen embryos, or “frosties”. The result has been uniformly positive with no increase in birth defects or development abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givf.com/fertility/embryofreezing.cfm |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121206043620/http://www.givf.com/fertility/embryofreezing.shtml |archivedate=December 6, 2012 |title=Genetics &amp; IVF Institute |publisher=Givf.com |accessdate=July 27, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of more than 11,000 cryopreserved human embryos showed no significant effect of storage time on post-thaw survival for IVF or oocyte donation cycles, or for embryos frozen at the pronuclear or cleavage stages.&lt;ref name=riggs&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=4 |author=Riggs R |author2=Mayer J |author3=Dowling-Lacey D |author4=Chi TF |author5=Jones E |author6=Oehninger S |title=Does storage time influence postthaw survival and pregnancy outcome?

=== Ovarian tissue ===
{{Main|Ovarian tissue cryopreservation}}
Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is of interest to women who want to preserve their reproductive function beyond the natural limit, or whose reproductive potential is threatened by cancer therapy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Isachenko V |author2=Lapidus I |author3=Isachenko E |title=Human ovarian tissue vitrification versus conventional freezing: morphological, endocrinological, and molecular biological evaluation |journal=Reproduction |date=2009 |pages=319–27 |volume=138 |pmid=19439559 |issue=2 |doi=10.1530/REP-09-0039 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example in hematologic malignancies or breast cancer.&lt;ref name=Oktay&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oktay K |author2=Oktem O |title=Ovarian cryopreservation and transplantation for fertility preservation for medical indications: report of an ongoing experience |journal=Fertil.

Tissue can then be thawed and implanted near the fallopian, either orthotopic (on the natural location) or heterotopic (on the abdominal wall),&lt;ref name=Oktay/&gt; where it starts to produce new eggs, allowing normal conception to occur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintluc.be/actualites/presse/2004/2004-tamara-lancet-complet.pdf Livebirth after orthotopic transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Lancet, September 24, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The ovarian tissue may also be transplanted into mice that are immunocompromised ([[SCID mice]]) to avoid [[graft rejection]], and tissue can be harvested later when mature follicles have developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=4|author=Lan C|author2=Xiao W|author3=Xiao-Hui D|author4=Chun-Yan H|author5=Hong-Ling Y |title=Tissue culture before transplantation of frozen-thawed human fetal ovarian tissue into immunodeficient mice |journal=Fertil.

===Oocytes===
{{Main|Oocyte cryopreservation}}
Human oocyte cryopreservation is a new technology in which a woman’s eggs ([[oocytes]]) are extracted, frozen and stored. Later, when she is ready to become pregnant, the eggs can be thawed, fertilized, and transferred to the uterus as [[embryos]].
Since 1999, when the birth of the first baby from an embryo derived from vitrified-warmed woman’s eggs was reported by Kuleshova and co-workers in the journal of Human Reproduction,&lt;ref name=Kuleshova/&gt; this concept has been recognized and widespread. This break-through in achieving vitrification of woman’s oocytes made an important advance in our knowledge and practice of the IVF process, as clinical pregnancy rate is four times higher after oocyte vitrification than after slow freezing.&lt;ref&gt;Glujovsky D, Riestra B, Sueldo C, Fiszbajn G, Repping S, Nodar F, Papier S, Ciapponi A. Vitrification versus slow freezing for women undergoing oocyte cryopreservation" ''Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews'' 2014, Issue 8. Art. No.: CD010047. {{DOI|10.1002/14651858.CD010047.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oocyte vitrification is vital for preservation fertility in young oncology patients and for individuals undergoing IVF who object, either for religious or ethical reasons, to the practice of freezing embryos.

===Semen===
{{Main|Semen cryopreservation}}
[[Semen]] can be used successfully almost indefinitely after cryopreservation. The longest reported successful storage is 22 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planer.com/PlanerComWebsite.nsf/7dc62b5d9e44dd40802575460048fc4e/df90c37237a74df88025757d005b0057?OpenDocument Planer NEWS and Press Releases &gt; Child born after 22 year semen storage using Planer controlled rate freezer] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120908021925/http://www.planer.com/PlanerComWebsite.nsf/7dc62b5d9e44dd40802575460048fc4e/df90c37237a74df88025757d005b0057?OpenDocument |date=2012-09-08 }} 14/10/2004&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used for [[sperm donation]] where the recipient wants the treatment in a different time or place, or as a means of preserving fertility for men undergoing [[vasectomy]] or treatments that may compromise their fertility, such as [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy]] or surgery.

===Testicular tissue===
Cryopreservation of immature testicular tissue is a developing method to avail reproduction to young boys who need to have gonadotoxic therapy. Animal data are promising, since healthy offsprings have been obtained after transplantation of frozen testicular cell suspensions or tissue pieces. However, none of the fertility restoration options from frozen tissue, i.e. cell suspension transplantation, [[tissue grafting]] and [[in vitro maturation]] (IVM) has proved efficient and safe in humans as yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=4 |author=Wyns C |author2=Curaba M |author3=Vanabelle B |author4=Van Langendonckt A |author5=Donnez J |title=Options for fertility preservation in prepubertal boys |journal=Hum.

===Moss===
[[Image:Ecotypes of Physcomitrella patens.JPG|thumb|200px|Four different [[ecotypes]] of ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'' stored at the [[International Moss Stock Center|IMSC]].]]
Cryopreservation of whole [[moss]] [[plant]]s, especially [[Physcomitrella patens]], has been developed by [[Ralf Reski]] and coworkers&lt;ref&gt;Schulte, J., Ralf Reski (2004): High-throughput cryopreservation of 140000 Physcomitrella patens mutants. Plant Biol. 6, 119-127. {{cite journal |title=High throughput cryopreservation of 140,000 Physcomitrella patens mutants |author=Schulte J. |author2=Reski R. |publisher=Plant Biotechnology, Freiburg University, Freiburg, Germany |pmid=15045662 |doi=10.1055/s-2004-817796 |volume=6 |journal=Plant Biol (Stuttg) |pages=119–27 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is performed at the [[International Moss Stock Center]]. This [[biobank]] collects, preserves, and distributes moss [[mutant]]s and moss [[ecotype]]s.&lt;ref&gt;ScienceDaily: Mosses, deep frozen. {{cite web |title=Mosses, deep-frozen |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/02/100224134325.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)===
MSCs, when transfused immediately within a few hours post-thawing, may show reduced function or show decreased efficacy in treating diseases as compared to those MSCs which are in log phase of cell growth (fresh). As a result, cryopreserved MSCs should be brought back into log phase of cell growth in ''in vitro'' culture before these are administered for clinical trials or experimental therapies. Re-culturing of MSCs will help in recovering from the shock the cells get during freezing and thawing. Various clinical trials on MSCs have failed which used cryopreserved products immediately post-thaw as compared to those clinical trials which used fresh MSCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Francois|first1=M|display-authors=etal|journal=Cytotherapy|date=2012|volume=14|issue=2|pages=147–152|pmc=3279133|title=Cryopreserved mesenchymal stromal cells display impaired immunosuppressive properties as a result of heat-shock response and impaired interferon-γ licensing|doi=10.3109/14653249.2011.623691|pmid=22029655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation of microbiology cultures==
Bacteria and fungi can be kept short-term (months to about a year, depending) refrigerated, however, cell division and metabolism is not completely arrested and thus is not an optimal option for long-term storage (years) or to preserve cultures genetically or phenotypically, as cell divisions can lead to mutations or sub-culturing can cause phenotypic changes. A preferred option, species-dependent, is cryopreservation. Nematode worms are the only multicellular eukaryotes that have been shown to survive cryopreservation. &lt;ref&gt;Weisberger, M. (2018). Worms Frozen for 42,000 Years in Siberian Permafrost Wriggle to Life. Retrieved from https://www.livescience.com/63187-siberian-permafrost-worms-revive.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shatilovich, A.V., Tchesunov, A.V., Neretina, T.V. et al. Dokl Biol Sci (2018) 480: 100. https://doi.org/10.1134/S0012496618030079&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fungi===
Fungi, notably zygomycetes, ascomycetes and higher basidiomycetes, regardless of sporulation, are able to be stored in liquid nitrogen or deep-frozen. Crypreservation is a hallmark method for fungi that do not sporulate (otherwise other preservation methods for spores can be used at lower costs and ease), sporulate but have delicate spores (large or freeze-dry sensitive), are pathogenic (dangerous to keep metabolically active fungus) or are to be used for genetic stocks (ideally to have identical composition as the original deposit). As with many other organisms, cryoprotectants like [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]] or [[glycerol]] (e.g. filamentous fungi 10% glycerol or yeast 20% glycerol) are used. Differences between choosing cryoprotectants are species (or class) dependent, but generally for fungi penetrating cryoprotectants like DMSO, glycerol or polyethylene glycol are most effective (other non-penetrating ones include sugars mannitol, sorbitol, dextran, etc.). Freeze-thaw repetition is not recommended as it can decrease viability. Back-up deep-freezers or liquid nitrogen storage sites are recommended. Multiple protocols for freezing are summarized below (each uses screw-cap polypropylene cryotubes):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://128.104.77.228/documnts/pdf2004/fpl_2004_nakasone001.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517120153/http://128.104.77.228/documnts/pdf2004/fpl_2004_nakasone001.pdf |archive-date=2014-05-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacteria===
Many common culturable laboratory strains are deep-frozen to preserve genetically and phenotypically stable, long-term stocks. Sub-culturing and prolonged refrigerated samples may lead to loss of plasmid(s) or mutations. Common final glycerol percentages are 15, 20 and 25. From a fresh culture plate, one single colony of interest is chosen and liquid culture is made. From the liquid culture, the medium is directly mixed with equal amount of glycerol; the colony should be checked for any defects like mutations. All antibiotics should be washed from the culture before long-term storage. Methods vary, but mixing can be done gently by inversion or rapidly by vortex and cooling can vary by either placing the cryotube directly at −50 to −95&amp;nbsp;°C, shock-freezing in liquid nitrogen or gradually cooling and then storing at −80&amp;nbsp;°C or cooler (liquid nitrogen or liquid nitrogen vapor). Recovery of bacteria can also vary, namely if beads are stored within the tube then the few beads can be used to plate or the frozen stock can be scraped with a loop and then plated, however, since only little stock is needed the entire tube should never be completely thawed and repeated freeze-thaw should be avoided. 100% recovery is not feasible regardless of methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Freeze-Drying and Cryopreservation of Bacteria&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.addgene.org/plasmid_protocols/create_glycerol_stock/|title=Addgene: Protocol - How to Create a Bacterial Glycerol Stock|website=Addgene.org|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.qiagen.com/knowledge-and-support/spotlight/plasmid-resource-center/growth%20of%20bacterial%20cultures/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907031938/http://www.qiagen.com/Knowledge-and-Support/Spotlight/Plasmid-Resource-Center/Growth%20of%20bacterial%20cultures |archive-date=2013-09-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Worms ===
The microscopic soil-dwelling [[nematode]] [[roundworms]] [[Panagrolaimus detritophagus]] and [[Plectus parvus]] are the only eukaryotic organisms that have been proven to be viable after long-term cryopreservation to date. In this case, the preservation was natural rather than artificial, due to [[permafrost]].

'''Dynamite''' is an [[explosive material|explosive]] made of [[nitroglycerin]], [[sorbent]]s (such as powdered shells or clay) and stabilizers. It was invented by the [[Swedish people|Swedish]] chemist and engineer [[Alfred Nobel]] in [[Geesthacht]], and [[patented]] in 1867. It rapidly gained wide-scale use as a more powerful alternative to [[gun powder|black powder]]. 

Today dynamite is mainly used in the [[mining]], [[quarrying]], [[construction]], and [[demolition]] industries. Dynamite is still the product of choice for trenching applications, and as a cost-effective alternative to [[cast booster]]s. Dynamite is occasionally used as an initiator or booster for [[ANFO|AN and ANFO explosive charges]].

==History==
[[File:Nobels Extradynamit label.jpg|thumb|"Nobels ExtraDynamit" manufactured by Nobel's old company, Nitroglycerin Aktiebolaget]]

Dynamite was invented by Swedish chemist [[Alfred Nobel]] in the 1860s and was the first safely manageable explosive stronger than [[black powder]], which had been invented in China in the 9th century. Black powder is now popularly known as gunpowder, because while it is effective as a propellant, it is less suitable for shattering rock or fortifications. 

Alfred Nobel's father, [[Immanuel Nobel]], was an industrialist, engineer, and inventor. He built bridges and buildings in Stockholm and founded Sweden's first rubber factory. His construction work inspired him to research new methods of blasting rock that were more effective than black powder. After some bad business deals in Sweden, in 1838 Immanuel moved [[Nobel family|his family]] to [[Saint Petersburg]], where Alfred and his brothers were educated privately under Swedish and Russian tutors. At age 17, Alfred was [[grand tour|sent abroad for two years]]; in the United States he met Swedish engineer [[John Ericsson]] and in France studied under famed chemist [[Théophile-Jules Pelouze]] and his pupil [[Ascanio Sobrero]] who had first synthesized [[nitroglycerin]] in 1847. It was in France that Nobel first encountered nitroglycerin, which Pelouze cautioned against using as a commercial explosive because of its high volatility.(flame ingnition ease)&lt;ref name="tekniskamuseet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfred Nobel - Dynamit|url=https://www.tekniskamuseet.se/lar-dig-mer/svenska-uppfinnare-och-innovatorer/alfred-nobel-dynamit/|publisher=[[Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology]] |accessdate=1 October 2017|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1857, Nobel filed the first of several hundred patents, mostly concerning air pressure, gas and fluid gauges, but remained fascinated with nitroglycerin's potential as an explosive. Nobel, along with his father and brother [[Emil Oskar Nobel|Emil]], experimented with various combinations of nitroglycerin and black powder. Nobel came up with a solution of how to safely detonate nitroglycerin by inventing the [[detonator]], or blasting cap, that allowed a controlled explosion set off from a distance using a [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]]. In the summer of 1863, Nobel performed his first successful detonation of pure nitroglycerin, using a blasting cap made of a copper [[percussion cap]] and [[Mercury(II) fulminate|mercury fulminate]]. In 1864, Alfred Nobel filed patents for both the blasting cap and his method of synthesizing nitroglycerin, which is composed of sulfuric acid, nitric acid and glycerin. On 3 September 1864, while experimenting with nitroglycerin, Emil and several others were killed in an explosion at the factory at Immanuel Nobel's estate at [[Heleneborg]]. After this, Alfred founded the company Nitroglycerin Aktiebolaget AB in [[Vinterviken]] to continue work in a more isolated area and the following year moved to Germany, where he founded another company, [[Dynamit Nobel]].&lt;ref name="tekniskamuseet"/&gt; 

Despite the invention of the blasting cap, the volatility of nitroglycerin rendered it useless as a commercial explosive. To solve this problem, Nobel sought to combine it with another substance that would make it safe for transport and handling but yet would not reduce its effectiveness as an explosive. He tried combinations of cement, coal, and sawdust, but was unsuccessful. Finally, he tried [[diatomaceous earth]], fossilized algae, that he brought from the [[Elbe River]] near his factory in [[Hamburg]], which successfully stabilized the nitroglycerin into a portable explosive.&lt;ref name="tekniskamuseet"/&gt; 

Nobel obtained [[patent]]s for his inventions in England on 7 May 1867 and in Sweden on 19 October 1867.&lt;ref name="s&amp;s-101"&gt;Schück &amp; Sohlman (1929), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; After its introduction, dynamite rapidly gained wide-scale use as a safe alternative to [[black powder]] and [[nitroglycerin]]. Nobel tightly controlled the patents, and unlicensed duplicating companies were quickly shut down. However, a few American businessmen got around the patent by using a slightly different formula.&lt;ref name="USPat 234489"&gt;US Patent 234489 issued to Morse 16 November 1880&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel originally sold dynamite as "Nobel's Blasting Powder" but decided to change the name to dynamite, from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''dýnamis'' ({{lang|grc|δύναμις}}), meaning "power".&lt;ref&gt;"dynamite."

==Manufacture==

===Composition===
Nitroglycerin by itself is a very strong explosive, but is extremely shock-sensitive (that is, physical shock can cause it to explode), and degrades over time to even more unstable forms, which makes it highly dangerous to transport or use. Dynamite combines nitroglycerin with absorbents and stabilizers, rendering it safe to use while retaining its powerful explosive properties.

Nobel's original composition of dynamite consisted of three parts "explosive oil" (as [[nitroglycerin]] was called), one part [[diatomaceous earth]] as the absorbent, and a small admixture of [[sodium carbonate]] antacid as the stabilizer. [[Ethylene glycol dinitrate]] was later added to the nitroglycerin to lower its freezing point and keep it from freezing into a slush at low temperatures, which made it unstable, or from sweating out when it thawed. Diatomaceous earth is not usually used today as an absorbent medium and it has been replaced by cheaper media such as sawdust, wood pulp, flour, or starch. Other stabilizers, such as calcium carbonate or zinc oxide, can be used in the place of sodium carbonate. Sodium nitrate is added to the medium as an oxidizer to improve the dynamite's [[brisance]].

===Form===
Dynamite is usually sold in the form of cardboard cylinders about {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on|0|order=flip}} long and about {{convert|1.25|in|cm|abbr=on|1|order=flip}} in diameter, with a weight of about {{convert|1/2|lbt|g|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name="Austin Blaster Guide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austinpowder.com/BlastersGuide/docs/pib/Dynamite%20Series.PDF |title=Austin Powder Guide, Dynamite series page 2 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=9 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321201205/http://www.austinpowder.com/BlastersGuide/docs/pib/Dynamite%20Series.PDF |archivedate=21 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A stick of dynamite thus produced contains roughly 1&amp;nbsp;MJ ([[megajoule]]) of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ChemViews|title=145 Years of Dynamite|url=http://www.chemistryviews.org/details/ezine/3622371/145_Years_of_Dynamite.html|website=Chemistry Views|publisher=ChemViews Magazine|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sizes also exist, rated by either portion (Quarter-Stick or Half-Stick) or by weight.

Dynamite is usually rated by "weight strength" (the amount of nitroglycerin it contains), usually from 20% to 60%. For example, ''40% dynamite'' is composed of 40% nitroglycerin and 60% "dope" (the absorbent storage medium mixed with the stabilizer and any additives).

===Storage considerations===
The maximum [[shelf life]] of nitroglycerin-based dynamite is recommended as one year from the date of manufacture under good storage conditions.&lt;ref name="Austin Blaster Guide" /&gt;

Over time, regardless of the sorbent used, sticks of dynamite will "weep" or "sweat" nitroglycerin, which can then pool in the bottom of the box or storage area. For that reason, explosive manuals recommend the repeated turning over of boxes of dynamite in storage. Crystals will form on the outside of the sticks causing them to be even more shock, friction, and temperature sensitive. This creates a very dangerous situation. While the risk of an explosion without the use of a [[blasting cap]] is minimal for fresh dynamite, old dynamite is dangerous. Modern packaging helps eliminate this by placing the dynamite into sealed plastic bags, and using wax coated cardboard.

Dynamite is moderately sensitive to shock. Shock resistance tests are usually carried out with a drop-hammer: about 100&amp;nbsp;mg of explosive is placed on an anvil, upon which a weight of between 0.5 and 10&amp;nbsp;kg is dropped from different heights until detonation is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos López Jimeno, Emilio López Jimeno, Francisco Javier Ayala-Carcedo, ''Drilling and Blasting of Rocks'', translated by Yvonne Visser de Ramiro from ''Manual de perforación y voladura de rocas'' (1987), Geomining Technological Institute of Spain (Instituto Tecnológico Geominero de Espan~a), Taylor &amp; Francis, London and New York, 1995, {{ISBN|90-5410-199-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a hammer of 2&amp;nbsp;kg, [[mercury fulminate]] detonates with a drop distance of 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;cm, nitroglycerin with 4 to 5&amp;nbsp;cm, dynamite with 15 to 30&amp;nbsp;cm, and ammoniacal explosives with 40 to 50&amp;nbsp;cm.

===Major manufacturers===
[[File:Aetna dynamite.jpg|thumb|upright|Advertisement for the Aetna Explosives Company of New York.]]

====South Africa====
For several decades beginning in the 1940s, the largest producer of dynamite in the world was the [[Union of South Africa]]. There the [[De Beers]] company established a factory in 1902 at [[Somerset West]]. The explosives factory was later operated by [[AECI]] (African Explosives and Chemical Industries). The demand for the product came mainly from the country's vast gold mines, centered on the [[Witwatersrand]]. The factory at Somerset West was in operation in 1903 and by 1907 it was already producing 340,000 cases, {{convert|50|lb|kg|order=flip}} each, annually. A rival factory at Modderfontein was producing another 200,000 cases per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caia.co.za/index.php?pg=18 AECI: South Africa - History of the Chemical Industry]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two large explosions at the Somerset West plant during the 1960s. Some workers died, but the loss of life was limited by the modular design of the factory and its earth works, and the planting of trees that directed the blasts upward. There were several other explosions at the Modderfontein factory. After 1985, pressure from trade unions forced AECI to phase out the production of dynamite. The factory then went on to produce ammonium nitrate emulsion-based explosives that are safer to manufacture and handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeci.co.za/New/History/1980.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630050905/http://www.aeci.co.za/New/History/1980.htm |archivedate=30 June 2006 |title=Historical Highlights 1980's |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=30 June 2006 |accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
Dynamite was first manufactured in the U.S. by the [[Giant Powder Company]] of [[San Francisco, California]] whose founder had obtained the exclusive rights from Nobel in 1867.  Giant was eventually acquired by the [[E. I. du Pont de Nemours Company]] who subsequently produced it under the Giant name until that company was dissolved by Du Pont in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;[https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc38234/m1/147/ ''US v. Du Pont'' 188 Fed 127, 147]&lt;/ref&gt;
Thereafter, Du Pont produced dynamite under its own name until 1911-12 when its explosives monopoly was broken up by the U.S. Circuit Court in the "Powder Case". 
Two new companies that were formed upon the breakup, the [[Hercules Powder Company]] and the Atlas Powder Company took up the manufacture of dynamite (in different formulations) thereafter.

Currently only [[Dyno Nobel]] manufactures dynamite in the US. The only facility producing it is located in [[Carthage, Missouri]], but the material is purchased from Dyno Nobel by other manufacturers, who put their label on the dynamite and boxes.

==Non-dynamite explosives==
Other explosives are often referred to or confused with dynamite:

===TNT===
[[TNT]] is most commonly assumed to be the same as (or confused for) Dynamite, largely due to the ubiquity of both explosives during the 20th century and the civilian practice of preparing Dynamite charges in 8x1" "sticks" wrapped in red waxed paper and shaped to fit the cylindrical [[borehole]]s drilled in the rock face. This incorrect connection between TNT and Dynamite was enhanced by [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoons where animators started labelling ''any'' kind of cartoon bomb (ranging from sticks of Dynamite to kegs of [[black powder]]) as "TNT" because the acronym was shorter, more memorable and didn't require [[literacy]] to recognize "TNT" meant "bomb" (similar to the use of XXX markings on [[whiskey]] bottles and barrels in cartoons). This eventually led to the general perception that TNT and Dynamite were one and the same.

In actuality, aside from both being high explosives, TNT and Dynamite have very little in common: TNT is a 2nd generation [[Use_forms_of_explosives#Castings|castable explosive]] adopted by the military "The German armed forces adopted it as a filling for artillery shells in 1902" forty years after Dynamite, which is a 1st generation [[phlegmatized explosive]] primarily intended for civilian earthmoving. TNT has never been popular or widespread in civilian earthmoving, as it is considerably more expensive and less powerful by weight than Dynamite&lt;ref name=Meyer2008&gt;J. Köhler, R. Meyer, A. Homburg: ''Explosivstoffe.'' Zehnte, vollständig überarbeitete Auflage. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-527-32009-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as being slower to mix and pack into cylindrical boreholes; for its part, Dynamite has never been popular in warfare because it degenerates quickly under severe conditions and can be detonated by either fire or a wayward bullet. TNT's primary asset is its remarkable insensitivity and stability: a full generation better than Dynamite, it is waterproof and incapable of detonating without the extreme shock and heat provided by a [[blasting cap]] (or a [[sympathetic detonation]]); this conveniently also allows it to be melted at 178 °F, poured into [[shell (projectile)|high explosive shells]] and allowed to re-solidify with no extra danger or change in the TNT's characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, T.R. &amp; Popolato, A. ''LASL Explosive Property Data''. [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], New Mexico. [[USDOE]], 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, more than 90% of the TNT produced in America was always for the military market, with most filling shells, [[hand grenades]] and [[aerial bombs]] and the remainder being packaged in brown "bricks" (not red cylinders) for use as [[satchel charge|demolition charges]] by [[combat engineers]].

==="Extra" dynamite===
In the United States, in 1885, the chemist Russell S. Penniman invented "ammonium dynamite", a form of explosive that used [[ammonium nitrate]] as a substitute for the more costly nitroglycerin. Ammonium nitrate has only 85% of the [[chemical energy]] of nitroglycerin.

It is rated by either "weight strength" (the amount of ammonium nitrate in the medium) or "cartridge strength" (the [[Strength (explosive)|potential explosive strength]] generated by an amount of explosive of a certain density and grain size used in comparison to the explosive strength generated by an equivalent density and grain size of a standard explosive). For example, high-explosive ''65% Extra Dynamite'' has a weight strength of 65% ammonium nitrate and 35% "dope" (the absorbent medium mixed with the stabilizers and additives). Its "cartridge strength" would be its weight in pounds times its strength in relation to an equal amount of [[ANFO]] (the civilian baseline standard) or [[TNT]] (the military baseline standard). For example, 65% ammonium dynamite with a 20% cartridge strength would mean the stick was equal to an equivalent weight strength of 20% ANFO.

==="Military dynamite"===
"Military dynamite" is a dynamite substitute, formulated without nitroglycerin. It contains 75% [[RDX]], 15% TNT, 5% SAE 10 motor oil, and 5% cornstarch, but is much safer to store and handle for long periods than Nobel's dynamite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uxoinfo.com/uxoinfo/ordfillers.cfm |title=Unexploded Ordnance Information: Ordnance Fillers |publisher=Uxoinfo.com |date= |accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Military dynamite substitutes much more stable chemicals for nitroglycerin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ledgard |first=Jared |title=A Soldiers Handbook, Volume 1: Explosives Operations |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=U6f-Qlmm6zIC&amp;pg=PA498|year=2007 |isbn=0-615-14794-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emergency tourniquets''' are cuff-like devices designed to stop severe traumatic [[bleeding]] before or during transport to a care facility. They are wrapped around the limb, [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] to the site of [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], and tightened until all [[blood vessel]]s underneath are occluded.

Pressure underneath a tourniquet cuff is not evenly distributed, with the highest pressures localized around the cuff centerline and decreasing to zero near the cuff edges.&lt;ref name=Noordin2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Noordin |first1=Shahryar |last2=McEwen |first2=James A. |last3=Kragh |first3=John F. |year=2009 |title=Current Concepts Review: Surgical Tourniquets in Orthopaedics |journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery |volume=91 |issue=12 |pages=2958–67 |publisher=JBJS |issn=0021-9355 |doi=10.2106/JBJS.I.00634}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high rate of change of pressure across the cuff width, or a high cuff pressure [[slope|gradient]], is a leading cause of nerve and muscle injury from tourniquet use.&lt;ref name=Noordin2009/&gt; Tourniquets with wider straps or cuffs, especially those with pneumatic actuation in contrast to mechanical force, distribute pressure more evenly and produce lower pressure gradients.&lt;ref name=Noordin2009/&gt; They are therefore more likely to stop bleeding and less likely to cause damage to underlying tissue, in addition to being significantly less painful than tourniquets with narrow straps and bands.&lt;ref name=Kragh2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=David M. |last2=Vater |first2=Gill M. |last3=Parker |first3=Paul J. |year=2011 |title=An Evaluation of Two Tourniquet Systems for the Control of Prehospital Lower Limb Hemorrhage |journal=The Journal of Trauma |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=591–5 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |doi=10.1097/TA.0b013e31820e0e41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overpressure protection in certain emergency tourniquets also help to prevent excessive force from damaging the limb.&lt;ref name=Walters2005/&gt;

==Risks==
[[File:Tourniquet application.jpg|right|thumb|Emergency tourniquet being applied in simulated combat. Military devices are designed for rugged environments.]]

Possible risks of complications—[[morbidity]]—related to emergency tourniquet use include 
{|
|-
|
* [[amputation]] or stump shortening
* [[:wikt:palsy|palsy]]
* [[myonecrosis]]
* pain
* clot
* [[fasciotomy]]
* acute [[renal failure]]
* [[rigor]]
* [[abscess]]
* [[blisters]]
* [[abrasion (medical)|abrasion]]s
* [[contusions]]
* and pinching.&lt;ref name=Kragh2008/&gt;
|}

Emergency care services implementing routine tourniquet use, especially in the civilian setting, should exercise caution and ensure that training is adequate for optimal results.&lt;ref name=Kragh2009a/&gt; However, given proper precautions, the occurrence of complications due to tourniquet use is quite rare.&lt;ref name=Kragh2009b&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kragh |first1=John F. |last2=Littrel |first2=Michelle L. |last3=Walters |first3=Thomas J. |year=2009 |title=Battle Casualty Survival with Emergency Tourniquet Use to Stop Limb Bleeding |journal=The Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=XX |issue=2 |pages=S38-S50 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |doi=10.1016/j.jemermed.2009.07.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed tourniquet devices are routinely tightened over healthy limbs during training with no ill effects, and recent evidence from combat hospitals in Iraq suggests that morbidity rates are low when users adhere to standard best practices. Since no better alternatives exist for users to self-apply with only basic training, the benefit of tourniquet use far outweighs the risks.&lt;ref name=Kragh2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kragh2009a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kragh2009b/&gt;

Safe tourniquet practice involves:
{|
|-
|
1. Careful placement of tourniquet proximal to all sites of hemorrhage.

2. Limiting tourniquet time to less than two hours, if possible.

3. Minimizing excessive applied pressure beyond the point of complete blood flow cessation.&lt;ref name=Kragh2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kragh2009b/&gt;
|}

==Current developments==
[[File:US Navy 100505-N-8377A-039 Quartermaster 2nd Class Caleb Murray works with two members of the Royal Brunei Navy Support Squadron, demonstrating the proper use of a tourniquet.jpg|right|thumb|Tourniquet application on the lower arm during training. Device user knowledge greatly increases survival rate and minimizes complications.]]

=== Field experience ===
Latest field trials suggest that wider straps are more effective and less painful than tourniquets with thinner straps. The concept of [[Tourniquet#Limb occlusion pressure|limb occlusion pressure]] is also gaining prominence over the misconception that greater applied force results in greater effectiveness. In addition, studies of failed cases indicate that the correct devices should be coupled with training that facilitates realistic expectations and correct user actions.&lt;ref name=Kragh2011/&gt;

=== Emerging needs ===
Despite the success of widespread tourniquet deployment to limit combat casualties, many preventable deaths from hemorrhage occur where conventional tourniquet use is inappropriate. The need exists for controlling junctional bleeding, especially in the [[human pelvis|pelvic]] area.&lt;ref name=Murphy2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Murphy |first1=Chris |last2=Kragh |first2=John F. |last3=Dubick |first3=Michael A. |year=2011 |title=New Tourniquet Device Concepts for Battlefield Hemorrhage Control |journal=U.S. Army Medical Department Journal |pages=38–48 |issn=1524-0436}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Combat Ready Clamp (CRoC) was selected by the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR) for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/article/72172/New_truncal_tourniquet_ready_for_battlefield_use/|title=New truncal tourniquet ready for battle use}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another emerging need is more refined training regimes and doctrine based on scientific evidence, which can ensure that future tourniquet practice and policies are in line with the most current body of knowledge.&lt;ref name=Murphy2011/&gt;

Junctional hemorrhage, bleeding from the areas at the junction of the trunk and its appendages, is a difficult problem in trauma. These areas are not amenable to extremity tourniquets because the area that is bleeding will not allow placement that can create circumferential pressure around the extremity and above the wound. Junctional arterial injuries can rapidly lead to death by exsanguination prior to care in the hospital so out-of-hospital control of junctional bleeding can be lifesaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Croushorn|first1=J|last2=Thomas|first2=G|last3=McCord|first3=SR|title=Abdominal aortic tourniquet controls junctional hemorrhage from a gunshot wound of the axilla.|journal=Journal of Special Operations Medicine|date=2013|volume=13|issue=3|pages=1–4|pmid=24048982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the study interval between October 2001 and June 2011, 4,596 battlefield fatalities were reviewed and analyzed. The stratification of mortality demonstrated that 87.3% of all injury mortality occurred pre-Military Treatment Facility (MTF). Of the pre-MTF deaths, 75.7% (n = 3,040) were classified as non-survivable, and 24.3% (n = 976) were deemed potentially survivable (PS). In this study the injury/physiologic focus of PS mortal wounding was largely associated with hemorrhage (90.9%) and the primary site of lethal hemorrhage was truncal (67.3%), followed by junctional (19.2%), and then peripheral-extremity (13.5%) hemorrhage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eastridge |first1=Brian J. |last2=Mabry |first2=Robert L. |last3=Seguin |first3=Peter |last4=Cantrell |first4=Joyce |last5=Tops |first5=Terrill |last6=Uribe |first6=Paul |last7=Mallett |first7=Olga |last8=Zubko |first8=Tamara |last9=Oetjen-Gerdes |first9=Lynne |last10=Rasmussen |first10=Todd E. |last11=Butler |first11=Frank K. |last12=Kotwal |first12=Russell S. |last13=Holcomb |first13=John B. |last14=Wade |first14=Charles |last15=Champion |first15=Howard |last16=Lawnick |first16=Mimi |last17=Moores |first17=Leon |last18=Blackbourne |first18=Lorne H. |title=Death on the battlefield (2001–2011) |journal=Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery |date=December 2012 |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=S431–S437 |doi=10.1097/TA.0b013e3182755dcc |pmid=23192066 |url=http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0227/4639/files/Eastridge_Death_on_the_Battlefield_J_Trauma_2012.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616142948/http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0227/4639/files/Eastridge_Death_on_the_Battlefield_J_Trauma_2012.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the statistics cited above we can deduce that there were 976 PS patients, with 91% of those involving hemorrhage.  This results in a total of 888 PS patients that died as a result of hemorrhage.  From these hemorrhagic cases we find that 19.2% involved junctional hemorrhage resulting in a potentially survivable subgroup of 171 patients from this study.  Therefore, if a device that can control junctional hemorrhage had been available, 171 persons with life-threatening hemorrhage from junctional regions could have been treated near the point of injury most probably resulting in reduced mortality in this subgroup.  And if that junctional device were multi-site capable so it could also be used to control extremity hemorrhage if needed then perhaps more in the peripheral-extremity sub-group could have survived.  Additionally it is unclear to what extent that the authors of this study categorized inter-pelvic bleeding, a common component of both amputations from blast and from blunt trauma like motor vehicle accidents, as truncal hemorrhage.  However it is very clear that if a device were capable of controlling not only junctional hemorrhage but was also clearly indicated and effective for controlling inter-pelvic hemorrhage, it could potentially change which injuries are viewed as “potentially survivable” in this study and thereby further expand survivability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pastore|first1=Rose|title=2012 Invention Awards: An Inflatable Abdominal Tourniquet|url=http://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2012-05/inflatable-tourniquet-stops-abdominal-bleeding|website=Popsci.com|publisher=Popular science|date=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Empower Up''', formerly known as CREAM (Computer Reuse Education And Marketing), a [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]], was a [[Computer recycling|computer recycling center]] in SW Washington. Started in mid-2002, Empower Up took old electronics in for donation, and recycled/distributed them.

==History==
Empower Up's history can be traced back to a collection event started by the [[Vancouver, Washington|City of Vancouver]] and [[Clark County, Washington|Clark County]] in June 2001. The success of this collection prompted the city to start another collection in January 2002, to collect only reusable computers and monitors for the community. Due to the success of the second event, comments by sponsors, and the general public showed an interest in these collections.

In mid-2002, after both an event for re-usage and recycling of computers, departments of the City of Vancouver created the program Computer REuse and Marketing, or CREAM. This new organization would have a permanent location, permanent collection sites, and mobile collection units to travel around the area. CREAM would also make sure of the proper disposal of materials in electronics not suitable for redistribution. By 2008, CREAM had distributed 250 refurbish computers to needy families (with the help of [[Salvation Army|Salvation Army Family Services]]), and recycled 3.5 million pounds of [[electronic waste]].

Near the beginning of 2009, due to new laws in Washington, it was recommended that the organization become an independent [[non-profit organization]]. With the help of [[Habitat for Humanity International|Habitat for Humanity]], and Clark County ReStore, the state created a 3-year plan to make CREAM an independent nonprofit. In February 2009, they established their first permanent building in Vancouver.

In April 2010, CREAM's name was changed to Empower Up, with the motto "''Technology Reuse In Action''", and changed to their current logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upgradeyourcommunity.org/about.html |title=Empower Up - About Us |author=CREAM |date=April 2010 |accessdate=April 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728144633/http://www.upgradeyourcommunity.org/about.html |archivedate=July 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013 Empower Up moved to 3206 N E 52nd Street Vancouver Washington 98663 on St Johns Road. They expanded the Reuse store and added an eBay store. &lt;!-- dubious - discuss? In the future Empower Up wants to promote more artistic ventures with recycled electronic parts and add skills training certifications.--&gt;

On 27 August 2016 Empower Up was shut down permanently, citing "economic pressure".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2016/jul/26/electronics-recycler-empower-up-closing/|title=Electronics recycler Empower Up closing|date=2016-07-26|work=The Columbian|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:eye liner.jpg|thumb|Dark [[teal (color)|teal]] eye liner along the rim of the eye]]
'''Eye liner''' or '''eyeliner''' is a [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] used to define the [[Human eyes|eyes]]. It is applied around the contours of the eye(s) to create a variety of aesthetic effects.

==History==
[[File:Tomb of Nakht.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ancient Egypt]]ian women and men wearing [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] eye liner, from the tomb of [[Nakht]] in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] (15th century BC).]]
Eye liner was first used in [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]] as a dark black line around the eyes. As early as 10,000 BC, Egyptians and Mesopotamians wore various cosmetics including eye liner not only for aesthetics but to protect the skin from the desert sun.  Research has also speculated that eye liner was worn to protect the wearer from the [[evil eye]]. The characteristic of having heavily lined eyes has been frequently depicted in ancient Egyptian art. They produced eye liner with a variety of materials, including [[copper ore]] and [[antimony]]. Ancient Egyptian [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] contained [[galena]], which was imported from nearby regions in the [[Land of Punt]], [[Qift|Coptos]] and [[Western Asia]].&lt;ref name="Stiant"&gt;''Studies in Ancient Technology'', Volume III, (Brill Archive), p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, [[Tutankhamun]]'s tomb was discovered, introducing the use of eye liner to the Western world. The 1920s were an era commonly associated with many changes in women's fashion, and women felt freer to apply make-up more liberally.

In the 1960s, liquid eye liner was used to create thick black and white lines around the eyes in the make-up fashion associated with designers like [[Mary Quant]]. The '60s and '70s also saw new fashion trends which made use of eyeliner, [[eyeshadow]] and [[mascara]] in new ways. As goth and punk fashion developed, they employed eyeliner for a dark and dramatic effect.

==Modern usage==
[[File:Tekom003.jpg|thumbnail|upright|right|A girl wearing eye liner.]]
In the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, heavy eye liner use has been associated with [[Goth fashion]] and [[Punk fashion]]. Eye liner of varying degrees of thickness has also become associated with the [[emo]] subculture and various alternative lifestyles. Guyliner is also a special style the [[emo]] subculture tend to use after being popularized from [[Pete Wentz|''Pete Wentz'']], bassist of the  pop-punk band [[Fall Out Boy|''Fall Out Boy'']].  
[[File:Eye makeup.jpg|thumb|left|An eye with brown eye liner under the bottom lashes.]]
Eye liner is commonly used in a daily make-up routine to define the eye or create the look of a wider or smaller eye. Eye liner can be used as a tool to create various looks as well as highlighting different features of the eyes.  Eye liner can be placed in various parts of the eye to create different looks with a winged eye liner or [[#Tight lining|tight lined]] at the waterline. Eye liner can be drawn above upper lashes or below lower lashes or both, even on the water lines of your eyes. Its primary purpose is to make the lashes look lush, but it also draws attention to the eye and can enhance or even change the eye's shape. Eye liner is available in a wide range of hues, from the common black, brown and grey to more adventurous shades such as bright primary colors, pastels, frosty silvers and golds, white and even glitter-flecked colors.

Eye liner can also be used for showing depression in photographs, such as the {{clarify|text=famous "Bleeding Mascara"|What does this refer to?|date=June 2015}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Tina |title=Bleeding Mascara: Eyeliner for Depressionistas |url=http://eyelinertips.net/bleeding-mascara/ |accessdate=7 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220090501/http://eyelinertips.net/bleeding-mascara/ |archivedate=February 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Different modern uses===
Although many users of eye liner use it on a day-to-day basis for a simple definer of the eyes, there are others who use it for more than just an easy eye enlarger. There are many styles of eye liner. Most of them usually revolve around the winged eye liner, which is defining around your top eyelid shape and a line, about halfway toward the end of the eyebrow. It is usually connected to the defining around the top. However today there are some drastically toned eye liner. Nowadays it is also used on the lower lid of the eyes in  different colors. 

===Tight lining===
Tight lining is the use of eye liner tight against the [[Meibomian gland|waterline]] under the lashes of the upper lid, and above the lashes of the lower lid. Due to the proximity to the membranes, and the surface of the eye itself, waterproof eye liner is preferred. Tight lining is a technique which makes the eyelashes appear to start farther back on the eyelid, thus making them look longer. Gel eye liner and a small angled brush may be used to create this look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tightlining: How-To|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/12/tightlining-eyeliner-makeup-tips_n_2853595.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Simone|last=Kitchens|date=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Headshot of Model with Blue Eyeliner.jpg|thumb|right|Woman with turquoise eye liner]]
Depending on its texture, eye liner can be softly smudged or clearly defined. There are five main types of eye liner available on the market: each produces a different effect.

*''Liquid eye liner'' is an opaque liquid that usually comes in a small bottle and is typically applied with a small sharp-tipped brush. It creates a clean, precise line. Because liquid eye liner gives a much heavier appearance, it is often only applied to the upper lash-line. 
*''Powder-based eye pencil'' is eye liner in a wood pencil.  It is generally available in dark, matted shades.
*''Wax-based eye pencils'' are softer pencils and contain waxes that ease application. They come in a wide variety of intense colours as well as paler shades such as white or beige. Wax-based eye liners can also come in a cone or a compact with brush applicator.
*''[[Kohl (cosmetics)|Kohl]]'' eye liner is a soft powder available in dark matte shades.  It is most often used in black to outline the eyes.  It comes in pencil, pressed powder, or loose powder form.  This type of eye liner is more likely to smudge.
* ''Gel eye liner'', which is a softer gel liner, that can be easily applied with an eye liner brush.  It can be precisely applied and is much softer than Kohl.
* ''Shimmer Liner'', which is available in different bright colors applied on the upper as well as lower eyelid.

==Chemical composition==
Traditional wax-based eye liners are made from about 20 components.  About 50% by weight are waxes (e.g., [[Japan wax]], fats, or related soft materials that easily glide on to the skin.  [[Stearyl heptanoate]] is found in most cosmetic eyeliner. Typical pigments include black [[iron oxide]]s, as well as smaller amounts of [[titanium dioxide]] and [[Prussian blue]].&lt;ref name=Color&gt;J.

'''Fasten Inc.''' is an American [[transportation network company]] based in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fasten.com/legal/driver-items|title=Fasten Driver Terms &amp; Conditions|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2017-01-26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 2015 by CEO Kirill Evdakov, CMO Roman Levitskiy and COO Vlad Christoff,  Fasten was first launched in September 2015 in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/10/05/uber-challenger-fasten/|title=Fasten wants to challenge Uber and Lyft in Boston|website=Fortune|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its initial round of funding, Fasten raised $9.2 million, contributed wholly by chairman Evgeny Lvov.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.betaboston.com/news/2015/10/05/bostons-fasten-seeks-to-compete-with-uber-lyft/|title=Boston’s Fasten seeks to compete with Uber, Lyft|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fasten now operates in two cities—[[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and Boston—with plans to expand to more U.S. cities in the future. Using the company's [[mobile app]], customers can send requests for rides, which are then dispatched to the nearest available drivers. Fasten has emphasized that for every trip completed by a driver, the company only takes $0.99 of the fare,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.fasten.com/you-are-driving-to-earn-money-2/|title=Hey Boston — you’re the first to ride with us|website=blog.fasten.com|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; a lower commission compared to competing transportation businesses such as [[Uber (company)|Uber]] and [[Lyft]], which both take a percentage of the fare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3065089/startup-report/the-ride-share-startup-thats-competing-with-uber-and-lyft-by-charging-1|title=The Ride-Share Startup That's Competing With Uber And Lyft By Charging $1|date=2016-10-31|newspaper=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first year, Fasten made a revenue of $500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/revenue-financial.fasten_inc.c1d597eed3e13dfa.html|title=Financials Information for Fasten Inc.|last=|first=|date=|work=|language=en|access-date=2017-01-26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its first year in Boston, Fasten mostly targeted college students in the Boston and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] area. The company offered promotions such as $5 for any ride under 20 minutes, $3 off your first 100 rides, and free rides between midnight and 3am, with Fasten paying the difference between promotional prices and actual prices to drivers. To attract drivers, Fasten offered to pay drivers for not only the time the customer was in the car, but also for the distance and time covered when the driver was travelling to pick up their passenger. Evdakov stated that in its first year, Fasten's driver base in Boston "grew 300% quarter by quarter."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://boston.crains.com/article/qa-fasten-founder-kirill-evdakov-takes-uber-and-lyft|title=Q&amp;A: Fasten founder Kirill Evdakov takes on Uber and Lyft|last=Bentley|first=Chris|date=2016-08-14|work=|newspaper=Crain's Boston|language=en|access-date=2017-01-26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== App ==
In order to use Fasten, both riders and drivers need a GPS enabled smartphone with the app installed. Currently available in the [[Google Play]] store for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices,&lt;ref&gt;{{Google Play|com.fasten}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] for devices powered by Apple's iOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{ITunes Preview App|941094858?|Fasten By Fasten Inc.}}]&lt;/ref&gt;  From this app, riders can enter a start (usually their current location) and end destination, and can request either a four- or six-seat car. Before requesting, riders will see an estimated wait time, an estimated time until arrival at destination, and an estimated cost.  Instead of [[Dynamic pricing|surge pricing]] in the app, Fasten offers potential riders the option to "boost" their ride, where riders can offer to pay drivers more in order to secure a ride during times of high demand. Upon requesting a ride, nearby drivers are notified of the pending request, and can choose whether or not to accept it. Drivers also see whether the rider has boosted the ride or not, and the multiplier of the booster.

Once a driver has accepted the request, the rider is able to view the driver's profile, including photo, the make and model of their car, license plate, and rating. Fasten rates drivers on a percentage scale, with riders giving drivers either thumbs up or down after each ride. Riders also see an estimated time until the driver arrives, with the driver's real-time position being shown on the map.

Customers have the option of contacting their driver through either phone or text. These communications are conducted through Fasten's servers, with Fasten providing both rider and driver with a temporary phone number to ensure anonymity. Fasten has emphasized that they require drivers to pull over before responding to phone calls or texts.

Another feature of the app is real-time pricing. While on the ride, riders can see the real-time fare they will be charged in the app as they travel along their route. This is similar to taxi cab pricing, and differs from Uber and Lyft, which offer either upfront pricing or calculate the fare to be paid after the trip has finished.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.betaboston.com/news/2015/10/28/test-riding-fasten-transportation-app-gunning-for-uber-and-lyft-in-boston/|title=Test-riding Fasten, a transportation app gunning for Uber and Lyft in Boston|last=Kirsner|first=Scott|date=October 28, 2015|work=|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Driver fees ==
Fasten takes a fixed $0.99 commission for every trip completed by a driver, unlike competitors Uber and Lyft, which both take around 20-30% of the fare riders pay. According to its website, Fasten drivers can also elect to pay a fixed $20 daily fee or $80 weekly fee, pocketing in whole all fares made during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2015/10/05/fasten-boston-ride-hailing/|title=Fasten Looks to Join Boston's Ride Hailing Market|newspaper=Boston Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drivers use their own cars, and must pay for their own fuel, car maintenance, and car insurance. During the ride, Fasten also offers additional and increasing levels of insurance coverage while a driver is looking for riders, while a driver is in transit to pick up a passenger, and while a passenger is on the ride, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fasten.com/safety|title=Rider Safety|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2017-01-26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drivers must undergo rigorous background checks before being allowed to work for Fasten. The company reviews an applicants county and federal courthouse records, state criminal databases, national sex offender registry, social security history, and motor vehicle records. Evdakov also stated that Fasten requires drivers' cars to be manufactured later than 2005 for safety reasons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fasten.com/drive|title=Drive With Fasten|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2017-01-26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Initial reception to Fasten in Boston was mixed. Riders were quick to laud Fasten's cheaper prices compared to similar services such as UberX and Lyft, especially due to the number of promotions that Fasten was running. Cars on Fasten's network also seemed to be of slightly higher quality. However, critics also pointed out the scarcity of drivers, with pickup times exceeding those of competing services. Fasten has tried to combat this and attract more drivers by offering amenities such as a driver's lounge in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160815005363/en/Fasten-Unveils-Industry%E2%80%99s-Lounge-Ridesharing-Drivers|title=Fasten Unveils the Industry’s First Lounge for Ridesharing Drivers {{!}} Business Wire|website=www.businesswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Scott Krisner of the ''Boston Globe'' points out, Fasten has entered the market late and so must overcome "huge brand awareness and loyal users who don’t think twice before hitting their app icons" on both the rider and driver end.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Political stances ==
Although he did not mention Trump directly, on January 31, 2017, in response to President Trump's [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] suspending the [[United States Refugee Admissions Program|U.S. Refugee Admissions Program]] and entry of foreign nationals from seven countries, CEO Evdakov released a statement stating: "We should never let our national origin, religion, or political views divide us, nor prevent us from seeing the real human being in each other." He also affirmed that Fasten would "match all tips riders give their drivers and donate 100% of the proceeds to nonprofit organizations that stand up for the rights of all people." This statement was released both as a blog on Fasten's website as well as contained in an email send to all riders and drivers. All proceeds will be donated to the American Civil Liberties Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.fasten.com/people-first/|title=PEOPLE FIRST|website=blog.fasten.com|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7985">A '''feature toggle'''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin Fowler 29 October 2010 |url=http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html |title=FeatureToggle |publisher=Martinfowler.com |date=2010-10-29 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also '''feature switch''', '''feature flag''', '''feature flipper''', '''conditional feature''', etc.) is a technique in [[software development]] that attempts to provide an alternative to maintaining multiple [[source code|source-code]] branches (known as feature branches), such that a feature can be tested even before it is completed and ready for release. Feature toggle is used to hide, enable or disable the feature during run time. For example, during the development process, a developer can enable the feature for testing and disable it for other users.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=ALM Rangers - Software Development with Feature Toggles|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn683796|website=msdn.microsoft.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuous release and [[continuous deployment]] provide developers with rapid feedback about their coding. This requires the integration of their code changes as early as possible. Feature branches introduce a bypass to this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apptimize.com/feature-flags-launch/|title=Feature Flags for Mobile Apps - Apptimize|work=apptimize.com|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feature toggles are an important technique used for the implementation of [[continuous delivery]].

The technique allows developers to release a [[Software versioning|version]] of a product that has unfinished features. These unfinished features are hidden (toggled) so they do not appear in the [[user interface]]. This allows many small incremental versions of [[software]] to be delivered without the cost of constant branching and merging. Feature toggles may allow shorter software integration cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Programming JavaScript Applications|url=http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000262/ch09.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team working on a project can use feature toggle to speed up the process of development, that can include the incomplete code as well.

== Implementation ==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
Feature toggles are essentially variables that are used inside conditional statements. Therefore, the blocks inside these conditional statements can be toggled 'on or off' depending on the value of the feature toggles. A block of code which has been toggled 'off' is similar to it being commented out. This allows developers to control the flow of their software and bypass features that are not ready for deployment.

The main usage of feature toggles is to avoid conflict that can arise when merging changes in software at the last moment before release. Although this can lead to [[Technical debt|toggle debt]]. Toggle debt arises due to the dead code present in software after a feature has been toggled on permanently and produces overhead. This portion of the code has to be removed carefully as to not disturb other parts of the code.

There are two main types of feature toggle. One is a release toggle, which the developer determines to either keep or remove before a product release depending on its working. The other is a business toggle, which is kept because it satisfies a different usage compared to that of the older code.

Feature toggles can be used in the following scenarios:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Adding a new feature to an application.
# Enhancing an existing feature in an application.
# Hiding or disabling a feature.
# Extending an interface.

Feature toggles can be stored as:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Row entries in a database.
# A property in a configuration file.

=== Feature groups ===
Feature groups consist of feature toggles that work together. This allows the developer to easily manage a set of related toggles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Programming JavaScript Applications|last=Elliot|first=Eric|publisher=O'Reilly Media|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canary release ==

Another benefit of feature flags is canary launches. A canary release (or canary launch or canary deployment) allow developers to have features incrementally tested by a small set of users. If a feature's performance is not satisfactory, then it can be rolled back without any adverse effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.launchdarkly.com/canary-launches-how-and-why-to-canary-release/|title=Canary launches – how and why to canary release|date=7 April 2015|work=launchdarkly.com|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the pattern can be implemented very simply in most [[programming language]]s (e.g. Java,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ff4j.github.io/|title=Home - Feature Flipping 4 JAVA|website=ff4j.github.io|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.togglz.org/|title=Togglz - Features flag for Java|website=www.togglz.org|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angular JS,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/mjt01/angular-feature-flags|title=mjt01/angular-feature-flags|website=GitHub|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; PHP,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://labs.qandidate.com/blog/2014/08/18/a-new-feature-toggling-library-for-php/|title=A new feature toggling library for PHP {{!}} labs @ Qandidate.com|website=labs.qandidate.com|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; JavaScript,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000262/ch09.html|title=Programming JavaScript Applications|website=chimera.labs.oreilly.com|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc. ), there are libraries &lt;ref&gt;One of many feature toggle framework list: http://www.beautifulbuilds.com/feature-toggle-frameworks-list/&lt;/ref&gt; available to further simplify usage.

[[Martin Fowler]] states that a feature toggle "should be your last choice when you're dealing with putting features into production". Instead, it is best to break the feature into smaller parts that each can be implemented and safely introduced into the released product without causing other problems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Feature-toggling is used by many large websites including Flickr,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.flickr.net/2009/12/02/flipping-out/|title=Flipping Out - code.flickr.com|first=Ross|last=Harmes|work=flickr.net|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disqus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.disqus.com/post/789540337/partial-deployment-with-feature-switches |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105232758/http://blog.disqus.com/post/789540337/partial-deployment-with-feature-switches |archivedate=2013-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Etsy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://codeascraft.com/2011/02/04/how-does-etsy-manage-development-and-operations/|title=How does Etsy manage development and operations?|date=4 February 2011|work=codeascraft.com|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; reddit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/config/feature/README.md|title=reddit/reddit|work=github.com|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gmail&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gmail.googleblog.com/2011/12/developing-gmails-new-look.html|title=Developing Gmail’s new look|work=googleblog.com|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Netflix, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/11/preparing-netflix-api-for-deployment.html|title=Preparing the Netflix API for Deployment|work=netflix.com|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as software such as [[Google Chrome|Google Chrome Canary]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18070">'''The International Organization for Biological and Integrated Control''', usually referred to as '''IOBC''', is a professional organization affiliated with the [[IUBS|International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS)]] and aims to be an effective advocate for [[Biological pest control|biological control]], [[integrated pest management]] (IPM) and [[integrated production]] (IP).

==Introduction==
The IOBC serves as a resource for international organizations, for example: the [[European Commission]] on sustainable use of pesticides &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Sustainable use of Pesticides |url= http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ppps/meeting040609.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the status of IPM in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Agra CEAS | year=2002 | title=Integrated crop management systems in the EU | url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/agriculture/pdf/icm_finalreport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the EC Regulation of Biological Control Agents (REBECA) with regard to invertebrate biological control agents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Regulation if invertebrate biological control agents in Europe:  review and recommendations in its pursuit of a harmonised regulatory system |url= http://www.rebeca-net.de/downloads/Regulation%20of%20Beneficials%20in%20Europe.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research on IPM ([[CGIAR]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CGIAR Systemwide Program on Integrated Pest Management (SP-IPM) |url=http://www.spipm.cgiar.org/articles/-/asset_publisher/N3xX/content/is-the-cbd-promoting-environmentally-friendly-solutions-to-pest-control;jsessionid=BC9134B15F8F3807F52D6824AA5952CA?redirect=%2Fhome}}&lt;/ref&gt; the European Plant Protection Organization ([[European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization|EPPO]]) on biological control agents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2009 | title=2nd Joint EPPO/IOBC Panel Meeting on Biological Control Agents | url= http://www.eppo.org/MEETINGS/2009_meetings/biocontrol_ch.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Food and Agriculture Organization ([[FAO]]) with respect to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD).&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web| author=Haas, F., van Lenteren, J.C., Cock, M.J.W.| title=Is the Convention on Biological Diversity promoting environmentally friendly solutions to pest control? |url= http://www.spipm.cgiar.org/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=53af8458-981c-4ff7-beab-0f1596f081b1&amp;groupId=17812|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | author=Cock, M.J.W., van Lenteren, J.C., Brodeur, J.|  year=2010 | title=The use and exchange of biological control agents for food and agriculture | url=http://cdn.www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/abs/abswg-09/information/abswg-09-inf-14-en.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and structure ==

The complete history of the IOBC was published in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Franz, J.M. | year=1988 |title=Highlights in the development of the International Organization for Biological Contreol of noxious animals and plants |  journal=BioControl | volume=33| pages=131–134 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/7360616463n05512/ | doi=10.1007/bf02372647}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Briefly, in 1948 the idea of an international organization on biological control was conceived.  By 1950 the IUBS decided to support the establishment of a "Commission Internationale de Lutte Biologique" (CILB) as part of the IUBS Division of Animal Biology and a committee was established to further this concept.  In 1955 the [[statute]]s of the new organization were ratified by the IUBS and the first [[plenary session]] of the CILB took place at [[Antibes]], [[France]].  In 1965, CILB changed its name from “Commission” to “Organization” thus becoming the “International Organization of Biological Control of Noxious Animals and Plants”.  In 1969, under the auspices of the IUBS, an agreement was reached among organizations to merge IOBC and the “International advisory committee for biological Control” (active in English-speaking countries) into a single international organization under the name IOBC.  The scientific journal ''Entomophaga'' (now superseded by ''BioControl'') is the official journal of the new organization.  In 1971 Global IOBC was established and the former IOBC became IOBC/WPRS, one of the regional sections.

There are now six regional sections world-wide:
*APRS [http://www.iobc-global.org/rs_aprs.html Asia and Pacific Regional Section]
*ATRS [http://www.iobc-global.org/rs_atrs.html Afrotropical Regional Section]
*EPRS [http://www.iobc-global.org/rs_eprs.html East Palearctic Regional Section]
*NRS [http://www.iobcnrs.com Nearctic Regional Section]
*NTRS [http://www.iobc-global.org/rs_ntrs.html Neotropical Regional Section]
*WPRS [http://www.iobc-wprs.org West Palearctic Regional Section]

== Goals and purpose ==

The IOBC promotes the development of biological control and its application in integrated pest management and international cooperation to these ends.

The IOBC collects, evaluates and disseminates information about biological control and promotes national and international action concerning research, training of personnel, coordination of large-scale application and public awareness of the economic and social importance of biological control.

The IOBC arranges conferences, meetings and symposia, and takes other actions to implement its general objectives.

== Global IOBC  ==

In addition to serving as an umbrella organization for the six regional sections, the global organization publishes proceedings of meetings, a newsletter and books and has 10 working groups.  These groups meet to discuss specific topics, usually agricultural pests, that often impact on biological control globally.

===Quality Control Standards===
Since using biological control agents is not like spraying a pesticide which gives immediate results, in order for growers to fully accept and use either biological control or an integrated pest management system, it is imperative that the quality of the control agents be uniformly good.  For this purpose, a set of standards have been developed and updated, for assessing the quality control of commercially produced biological control agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Bigler, F. | year=1992 | title=Report of the sixth workshop of the IOBC global working group "Quality control of mass reared arthropods" | pages=1–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=van Lenteren, J.C., Hale, A., Klapwijk, J.N.| year=2003 | chapter=Guidelines for quality control of commercially produced natural enemies | editor=van Lenteren, J.C. | publisher=CABI publishing |title=Quality Control and Production of Biological Control Agents: Theory and Testing Procedures |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; These guidelines have also been accepted and are used by the scientific community (see a selection of references).&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | doi=10.1006/bcon.2001.0962 |author1=Hassan S.A.  |author2=Zhang, W.Q. | year=2001 | title=Variability in Quality of Trichogramma brassicae (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) from Commercial Suppliers in Germany | journal=Biological Control | volume=22 | pages=115–121 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&amp;_imagekey=B6WBP-45BBTCM-J-1&amp;_cdi=6716&amp;_user=3935559&amp;_pii=S1049964401909624&amp;_orig=search&amp;_coverDate=10%2F31%2F2001&amp;_sk=999779997&amp;view=c&amp;wchp=dGLbVzz-zSkzV&amp;md5=fa2ebca79588b74d44c60d6ce96fe19d&amp;ie=/sdarticle.pdf | issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Fernandez, C.  |author2=Nentwig, W. | title=Quality control of the parasitoid Aphidius colemani (Hy., Aphidiidae) used for biological control in greenhouses | journal=Journal of Applied Entomology | volume=121 | pages=1–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author=Prezotti, L.R., Parra, J.R.P., Vencovsky, R.| year=2002 | title=Flight Test as Evaluation Criterion for the Quality of Trichogramma pretiosum Riley (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae): Adaptation of the Methodology | journal=Neotropical Entomology | volume=31 | doi=10.1590/S1519-566X2002000300010 | issue=3 | pages=411–417 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | doi=10.1603/0022-0493(2004)097[0781:QAOSCA]2.0.CO;2 | author=Vasquez, G.M, Orr D.B. and Baker, J.R. | year=2004 | title=Quality assessment of selected commercially available whitefly and aphid biological control agents in the United States | journal=Journal of Economic Entomology | volume=97 | issue=3 | pages=781–788 | pmid=15279253 | issn=0022-0493 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.biocontrol.2008.07.014 | author=Luczynski, A., Nyrop, J.P., and Shi, A. | year=2008 | title=Pattern of female reproductive age classes in mass-reared populations of Phytoseiulus persimilis (Acari: Phytoseiidae) and its influence on population characteristics and quality of predators following cold storage | journal=Biological Control | volume=47 | pages=159–166 | issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commission on Biological Control and Access and Benefit Sharing===
In 2008 IOBC Global established a Commission on Biological Control and Access and Benefit Sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Barratt, B.I.P. | year=2009 | title=A review of access and benefit-sharing for biological control:  What does it mean for New Zealand? | journal=New Zealand Plant Protection | volume=62 | pages=152–155 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], countries have sovereign rights over their genetic resources.  Agreements governing the access to these resources and the sharing of the benefits arising from their use needs to be established between involved parties.  These agreements were created for a number of reasons, among which was the disproportionate monetary advantage developed countries were realizing in the pharmaceutical market.  However, since the agreements are all encompassing there have been unforeseen consequences.  These agreements also apply to species collected for potential use in biological control.  Recent applications of CBD principles have already made it difficult or impossible to collect and export natural enemies for biological control research in several countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1007/s10526-009-9234-9| author=Cock, M.J.W., van Lenteren, J.C., Brodeur, J.| year=2010 | title=Do new Access and Benefit Sharing procedures under the convention on Biological Diversity threaten the future of biological control? | journal=BioControl | volume =55 |pages=199–218 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/e6v347044t221404/fulltext.pd| issue=2|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Haas, F., Lohr, B., Munyi, P.| year=2007 | title=Access to biocontrol agents to combat invasive alien species and the Access and Benefit Sharing regulations | url=http://cdn.www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/abs/abswg-05/information/abswg-05-inf-05-en.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== West Palaearctic Regional Section ===

The West Palaearctic Regional Section is the most active of the regional sections with 20 [[working group]]s (that focus on crops, agricultural pests, and other topics) and five commissions which usually meet in different locations in member countries.  Additionally it produces the ''IOBC/WPRS Bulletin'' which is recognized by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] as one of the top research journals on organic production and organic food,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/pubs/ofp/ofpjournals.shtml USDA Journal List]&lt;/ref&gt; newsletters and books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iobc-wprs.org/pub/index.html Publications]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pesticide Side-Effects Standards====
The Pesticides and Beneficial Organisms working group is made up of scientists from many countries. They established standards, which are periodically updated, for testing the side effects of pesticides on a large range of natural enemies and ranking those effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1111/j.1365-2338.1985.tb00224.x| author=Hassan, E., Oomen, P.A., Overmeer, P.| year=1985 | title=Standard methods to test the side-effects of pesticides on natural enemies of insects and mites developed by the IOBC/WPRS Working Group 'Pesticides and Beneficial Organisms' | journal=EPPO Bulletin | volume=15 | pages=214–255 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119513886/PDFSTART| issue=2|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hassan, S.A., Bigler, F., Bogenschutz, H.| year=1994 | title=Results of the sixth joint pesticide testing programme of the IOBC/WPRS-working group ‘Pesticides and Beneficial Organisms' | journal=BioControl | volume=39 | pages=107–119 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/q438jtp075686184/ | doi=10.1007/bf02373500|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1023/A:1009959009802| author=Sterk, G., Hassan, S.A., Baillod, M.| year=1999 | title=Results of the seventh joint pesticide testing programme carried out by the IOBC/WPRS-Working Group ‘Pesticides and Beneficial Organisms’ | journal=BioControl | volume=44 | pages=99–117 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g41511632873n431/fulltext.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Candolfi, M.P., Blumel, S., Forester, R.| year=2000 | title=Guidelines to evaluate side-effects of plant protection products to non-target arthropods Joint initiative IOBC, BART and EPPO | url=http://www.iobc-wprs.org/pub/book2000.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of establishing these standards was to provide a means by which pesticides could be ranked for their effect on beneficial organisms and pesticide testing could be compared from all regions of the world.

Fire-retardant materials should not be confused with fire-resistant materials. A '''[[Fireproofing|fire resistant]] material''' is one that is designed to resist [[combustion|burning]] and withstand [[heat]], however, fire-retardant materials are designed to burn slowly. An example of a fire-resistant material is one which is used in [[bunker gear]] worn by [[firefighter]]s to protect them from the [[flame]]s of a burning building. In the [[United Kingdom]], after two significant construction fires which resulted in a combined loss of £1500 million, ''The Joint Code of Practice'' was introduced by the national fire safety organisation, {FPA},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Joint Code of Practice |url=http://www.thefpa.co.uk/ |website=FPA
|publisher=Fire Protection Association|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to prevent fires on buildings undergoing construction work. The Joint Code of Practice provides advice on how to prevent fires such as the use of flame-retardant temporary protection materials such as some high quality floor protectors which are designed to burn slowly and prevent the spread of fires.

[[Image:Microcontrollers Atmega32 Atmega8.jpg|thumbnail|Two ATmega microcontrollers]]

A '''microcontroller''' ('''MCU''' for ''microcontroller unit'', or '''UC''' for ''&amp;mu;-controller'') is a small [[computer]] on a single [[integrated circuit]].  In modern terminology, it is similar to, but less sophisticated than, a [[system on a chip]] (SoC); an SoC may include a microcontroller as one of its components. A microcontroller contains one or more [[Central_processing_unit|CPUs]] ([[Processor core|processor cores]]) along with [[Computer memory|memory]] and programmable [[input/output]] peripherals.  Program memory in the form of [[ferroelectric RAM]], [[Flash memory#NOR flash|NOR flash]] or [[Programmable read-only memory|OTP ROM]] is also often included on chip, as well as a small amount of [[random-access memory|RAM]].  Microcontrollers are designed for [[Embedded_system|embedded]] applications, in contrast to the [[microprocessor]]s used in [[personal computer]]s or other general purpose applications consisting of various discrete chips.

Microcontrollers are used in [[Control system|automatically controlled]] products and devices, such as automobile engine control systems, implantable medical devices, remote controls, office machines, appliances, power tools, toys and other [[embedded system]]s.  By reducing the size and cost compared to a design that uses a separate [[microprocessor]], memory, and input/output devices, microcontrollers make it economical to digitally control even more devices and processes.  [[Mixed-signal integrated circuit|Mixed signal]] microcontrollers are common, integrating analog components needed to control non-digital electronic systems.  In the context of the [[internet of things]], microcontrollers are an economical and popular means of [[data collection]], [[Sensor|sensing]] and [[Actuator|actuating]] the physical world as [[Edge device|edge devices]].

Some microcontrollers may use four-bit [[Word (computer architecture)|words]] and operate at frequencies as low as {{nowrap|4 kHz,}} for low [[Electric energy consumption|power consumption]] (single-digit [[Watt|milliwatts]] or microwatts). They generally have the ability to retain functionality while [[Wait state|waiting]] for an [[Event-driven architecture|event]] such as a button press or other [[interrupt]]; power consumption while sleeping (CPU clock and most peripherals off) may be just nanowatts, making many of them well suited for long lasting battery applications. Other microcontrollers may serve performance-critical roles, where they may need to act more like a [[digital signal processor]] (DSP), with higher clock speeds and power consumption.

== History ==
The first [[microprocessor]] was the [[4-bit]] [[Intel 4004]] released in 1971, with the [[Intel 8008]] and other more capable microprocessors becoming available over the next several years. However, both processors required external chips to implement a working system, raising total system cost, and making it impossible to economically computerize appliances.

One book credits [[Texas Instruments|TI]] engineers Gary Boone and Michael Cochran with the successful creation of the first microcontroller in 1971.  The result of their work was the [[TMS 1000]], which became commercially available in 1974. It combined read-only memory, read/write memory, processor and clock on one chip and was targeted at embedded systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  |accessdate=2009-12-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly in response to the existence of the single-chip TMS 1000,&lt;ref name=CMoral2008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2013/05/102658328-05-01-acc.pdf |title=Oral History Panel on the Development and Promotion of the Intel 8048 Microcontroller|work=Computer History Museum Oral History, 2008|accessdate=2016-04-04|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intel developed a computer system on a chip optimized for control applications, the [[Intel 8048]], with commercial parts first shipping in 1977.&lt;ref name=CMoral2008/&gt; It combined [[Random access memory|RAM]] and [[Read only memory|ROM]] on the same chip. This chip would find its way into over one billion PC keyboards, and other numerous applications. At that time Intel's President, Luke J. Valenter, stated that the microcontroller was one of the most successful in the company's history, and expanded the division's budget over 25%.

Most microcontrollers at this time had concurrent variants. One had [[EPROM]] program memory, with a transparent quartz window in the lid of the package to allow it to be erased by exposure to [[ultraviolet]] light, often used for prototyping. The other was either a mask programmed ROM from the manufacturer for large series, or a [[Programmable read-only memory|PROM]] variant which was only programmable once; sometimes this was signified with the designation OTP, standing for "one-time programmable". The PROM was of identical type of memory as the EPROM, but because there was no way to expose it to ultraviolet light, it could not be erased. The erasable versions required ceramic packages with quartz windows, making them significantly more expensive than the OTP versions, which could be made in lower-cost opaque plastic packages. For the erasable variants, quartz was required, instead of less expensive glass, for its transparency to ultraviolet&amp;mdash;glass is largely opaque to UV&amp;mdash;but the main cost differentiator was the ceramic package itself.

In 1993, the introduction of [[EEPROM]] memory allowed microcontrollers (beginning with the Microchip [[PIC16x84|PIC16C84]])&lt;ref name="pic16c84ref"&gt;{{cite web
 |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/silicon-revolution/chip-hall-of-fame-microchip-technology-pic-16c84-microcontroller

 |publisher=IEEE
 |access-date=September 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be electrically erased quickly without an expensive package as required for [[EPROM]], allowing both rapid prototyping, and [[in-system programming]]. (EEPROM technology had been available prior to this time&lt;ref name="mc68ch805ref"&gt;{{cite book |author=Motorola |title=Advance Information, 8-Bit Microcomputers MC68HC05B6, MC68HC05B4, MC68HC805B6, Motorola Document EADI0054RI |publisher= Motorola Ltd., 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but the earlier EEPROM was more expensive and less durable, making it unsuitable for low-cost mass-produced microcontrollers.) The same year, Atmel introduced the first microcontroller using [[Flash memory]], a special type of EEPROM.&lt;ref name="flash"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atmel’s Self-Programming Flash Microcontrollers |url=http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2464.pdf |date=2012-01-24 |accessdate=2008-10-25}} by Odd Jostein Svendsli 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies rapidly followed suit, with both memory types.

Nowadays microcontrollers are cheap and readily available for hobbyists, with large online communities around certain processors.

=== World's smallest computer ===
On 21 June 2018, the "world's smallest computer" was announced by the [[University of Michigan]]. The device is a "0.04mm3 16nW wireless and batteryless sensor system with integrated [[ARM Cortex-M#Cortex-M0+|Cortex-M0+]] processor and optical communication for cellular temperature measurement." It "measures just 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm to a side&amp;mdash;dwarfed by a grain of rice. [...] In addition to the RAM and [[photovoltaics]], the new computing devices have processors and [[wireless networking|wireless transmitters and receivers]]. Because they are too small to have conventional radio antennae, they receive and transmit data with visible light. A base station provides light for power and programming, and it receives the data."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=https://news.umich.edu/u-m-researchers-create-worlds-smallest-computer/ | title=U-M researchers create world's smallest 'computer' | date=2018-06-21 | publisher=[[University of Michigan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device is 1/10th the size of IBM's previously claimed world-record-sized computer from months back in March 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=https://www.cnet.com/news/university-of-michigan-outdoes-ibm-with-worlds-smallest-computer/ | title=University of Michigan outdoes IBM with world's smallest 'computer' | date=2018-06-22 | publisher=[[CNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is "smaller than a grain of salt",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=https://www.cnet.com/news/ibm-fighting-counterfeiters-with-worlds-smallest-computer/ | title=IBM fighting counterfeiters with world's smallest computer | date=2018-03-19 | publisher=[[CNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a million transistors, costs less than $0.10 to manufacture, and, combined with [[blockchain]] technology, is intended for logistics and “crypto-anchors”&amp;mdash;”[[Fingerprint_(computing)|digital fingerprints]]” applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=IBM Built a Computer the Size of a Grain of Salt.

=== Volumes and cost ===
In 2002, about 55% of all [[central processing unit|CPU]]s sold in the world were 8-bit microcontrollers and microprocessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.embedded.com/electronics-blogs/significant-bits/4024488/The-Two-Percent-Solution|title=The Two Percent Solution|last=Turley|first=Jim|work=Embedded|year=2002|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over two billion 8-bit microcontrollers were sold in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.circuitcellar.com/library/designforum/silicon_update/3/index.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927214629/https://www.circuitcellar.com/library/designforum/silicon_update/3/index.asp|archivedate=2007-09-27|title=Microchip on the March &lt;!--HTML title: Circuit Cellar - Digital Library--&gt;|year=1998|first=Tom |last=Cantrell|website=Circuit Cellar|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Semico, over four billion 8-bit microcontrollers were sold in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.semico.com&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Semico has claimed the MCU market grew 36.5% in 2010 and 12% in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://semico.com/content/momentum-carries-mcus-2011|title=Momentum Carries MCUs Into 2011 {{!}} Semico Research|website=semico.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical home in a developed country is likely to have only four general-purpose microprocessors but around three dozen microcontrollers. A typical mid-range automobile has about 30 microcontrollers. They can also be found in many electrical devices such as washing machines, microwave ovens, and telephones.

== Embedded design ==
A microcontroller can be considered a self-contained system with a processor, memory and peripherals and can be used as an [[embedded system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of microcontrollers in use today are embedded in other machinery, such as automobiles, telephones, appliances, and peripherals for computer systems.

While some embedded systems are very sophisticated, many have minimal requirements for memory and program length, with no operating system, and low software complexity. Typical input and output devices include switches, [[relay]]s, [[solenoid]]s, [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]'s, small or custom [[liquid-crystal display]]s, radio frequency devices, and sensors for data such as temperature, humidity, light level etc. Embedded systems usually have no keyboard, screen, disks, printers, or other recognizable I/O devices of a [[personal computer]], and may lack human interaction devices of any kind.

=== Interrupts ===
Microcontrollers must provide [[Real-time computing|real-time]] (predictable, though not necessarily fast) response to events in the embedded system they are controlling. When certain events occur, an [[interrupt]] system can signal the processor to suspend processing the current instruction sequence and to begin an [[interrupt service routine]] (ISR, or "interrupt handler") which will perform any processing required based on the source of the interrupt, before returning to the original instruction sequence. Possible interrupt sources are device dependent, and often include events such as an internal timer overflow, completing an analog to digital conversion, a logic level change on an input such as from a button being pressed, and data received on a communication link. Where power consumption is important as in battery devices, interrupts may also wake a microcontroller from a low-power sleep state where the processor is halted until required to do something by a peripheral event.

=== Programs ===
Typically micro-controller programs must fit in the available on-chip memory, since it would be costly to provide a system with external, expandable memory. Compilers and assemblers are used to convert both [[High-level programming language|high-level]] and [[assembly language]] codes into a compact [[machine code]] for storage in the micro-controller's memory. Depending on the device, the program memory may be permanent, [[read-only memory]] that can only be programmed at the factory, or it may be field-alterable [[Flash memory|flash]] or erasable read-only memory.

Manufacturers have often produced special versions of their micro-controllers in order to help the hardware and [[software development]] of the target system. Originally these included [[EPROM]] versions that have a "window" on the top of the device through which program memory can be erased by [[ultraviolet]] light, ready for reprogramming after a programming ("burn") and test cycle. Since 1998, EPROM versions are rare and have been replaced by [[EEPROM]] and flash, which are easier to use (can be erased electronically) and cheaper to manufacture.

Other versions may be available where the ROM is accessed as an external device rather than as internal memory, however these are becoming rare due to the widespread availability of cheap microcontroller programmers.

The use of field-programmable devices on a micro controller may allow field update of the [[firmware]] or permit late factory revisions to products that have been assembled but not yet shipped. Programmable memory also reduces the lead time required for deployment of a new product.

Where hundreds of thousands of identical devices are required, using parts programmed at the time of manufacture can be economical. These "[[mask ROM|mask programmed]]" parts have the program laid down in the same way as the logic of the chip, at the same time.

A customized micro-controller incorporates a block of digital logic that can be personalized for additional processing capability, [[peripherals]] and [[Interface (computer science)|interfaces]] that are adapted to the requirements of the application. One example is the [[AT91CAP]] from [[Atmel]].

=== Other microcontroller features ===
Microcontrollers usually contain from several to dozens of general purpose input/output pins (GPIO). GPIO pins are software configurable to either an input or an output state. When GPIO pins are configured to an input state, they are often used to read sensors or external signals. Configured to the output state, GPIO pins can drive external devices such as LEDs or motors, often indirectly, through external power electronics.

Many embedded systems need to read sensors that produce analog signals. This is the purpose of the [[analog-to-digital converter]] (ADC). Since processors are built to interpret and process digital data, i.e. 1s and 0s, they are not able to do anything with the analog signals that may be sent to it by a device. So the analog to digital converter is used to convert the incoming data into a form that the processor can recognize. A less common feature on some microcontrollers is a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC) that allows the processor to output analog signals or voltage levels.

In addition to the converters, many embedded microprocessors include a variety of timers as well. One of the most common types of timers is the [[programmable interval timer]] (PIT). A PIT may either count down from some value to zero, or up to the capacity of the count register, overflowing to zero. Once it reaches zero, it sends an interrupt to the processor indicating that it has finished counting. This is useful for devices such as thermostats, which periodically test the temperature around them to see if they need to turn the air conditioner on, the heater on, etc.

A dedicated [[pulse-width modulation]] (PWM) block makes it possible for the CPU to control [[Switched-mode power supply|power converters]], [[Electrical resistance|resistive]] loads, [[Electric motor|motors]], etc., without using lots of CPU resources in tight timer [[Program loops|loops]].

A [[universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter]] (UART) block makes it possible to receive and transmit data over a serial line with very little load on the CPU. Dedicated on-chip hardware also often includes capabilities to communicate with other devices (chips) in digital formats such as Inter-Integrated Circuit ([[I²C]]), Serial Peripheral Interface ([[Serial Peripheral Interface|SPI]]), Universal Serial Bus ([[USB]]), and [[Ethernet]].&lt;ref&gt;David Harris &amp; Sarah Harris (2012).

== Higher integration ==
[[Image:PIC12C508-HD.jpg|thumb|[[Die (integrated circuit)|Die]] of a PIC12C508 8-bit, fully static, [[EEPROM]]/[[EPROM]]/[[Mask ROM|ROM]]-based [[CMOS]] microcontroller manufactured by [[Microchip Technology]] using a 1200 [[nanometre]] process]]
[[Image:STM32F100C4T6B-HD.jpg|thumb|[[Die (integrated circuit)|Die]] of a STM32F100C4T6B [[ARM Cortex-M|ARM Cortex-M3]] microcontroller with 16 [[kilobyte]]s [[flash memory]], 24&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|MHz]] [[central processing unit]] (CPU), [[motor controller|motor control]] and [[Consumer Electronics Control]] (CEC) functions. Manufactured by [[STMicroelectronics]].]]
Micro-controllers may not implement an external address or data bus as they integrate RAM and non-volatile memory on the same chip as the CPU. Using fewer pins, the chip can be placed in a much smaller, cheaper package.

Integrating the memory and other peripherals on a single chip and testing them as a unit increases the cost of that chip, but often results in decreased net cost of the embedded system as a whole. Even if the cost of a CPU that has integrated peripherals is slightly more than the cost of a CPU and external peripherals, having fewer chips typically allows a smaller and cheaper circuit board, and reduces the labor required to assemble and test the circuit board, in addition to tending to decrease the defect rate for the finished assembly.

A micro-controller is a single [[integrated circuit]], commonly with the following features:
* [[central processing unit]]{{snd}} ranging from small and simple [[4-bit]] processors to complex [[32-bit]] or [[64-bit]] processors
* volatile memory ([[RAM]]) for data storage
* [[Read-only memory|ROM]], [[EPROM]], [[EEPROM]] or [[Flash memory]] for [[Computer program|program]] and operating parameter storage
* discrete input and output bits, allowing control or detection of the logic state of an individual package pin
* serial [[input/output]] such as [[serial port]]s ([[UART]]s)
* other [[serial communications]] [[Network interface controller|interfaces]] like [[I²C]], [[Serial Peripheral Interface]] and [[Controller Area Network]] for system interconnect
* [[peripheral]]s such as [[timer]]s, event counters, [[Pulse-width modulation|PWM generators]], and [[Watchdog timer|watchdog]]
* [[clock generator]]{{snd}} often an oscillator for a quartz timing crystal, resonator or [[RC circuit]]
* many include analog-to-digital converters, some include digital-to-analog converters
* [[in-circuit programming]] and [[in-circuit debugging]] support

This integration drastically reduces the number of chips and the amount of wiring and [[Printed circuit board|circuit board]] space that would be needed to produce equivalent systems using separate chips. Furthermore, on low pin count devices in particular, each pin may interface to several internal peripherals, with the pin function selected by software. This allows a part to be used in a wider variety of applications than if pins had dedicated functions.

Micro-controllers have proved to be highly popular in [[embedded system]]s since their introduction in the 1970s.

Some microcontrollers use a [[Harvard architecture]]: separate memory buses for instructions and data, allowing accesses to take place concurrently. Where a Harvard architecture is used, instruction words for the processor may be a different bit size than the length of internal memory and registers; for example: 12-bit instructions used with 8-bit data registers.

The decision of which peripheral to integrate is often difficult. The microcontroller vendors often trade operating frequencies and system design flexibility against time-to-market requirements from their customers and overall lower system cost. Manufacturers have to balance the need to minimize the chip size against additional functionality.

Microcontroller architectures vary widely. Some designs include general-purpose microprocessor cores, with one or more ROM, RAM, or I/O functions integrated onto the package. Other designs are purpose built for control applications. A micro-controller instruction set usually has many instructions intended for [[bit manipulation]] (bit-wise operations) to make control programs more compact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2009-01/dot-dot-programming Easy Way to build a microcontroller project]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a general purpose processor might require several instructions to test a bit in a register and branch if the bit is set, where a micro-controller could have a single instruction to provide that commonly required function.

Microcontrollers traditionally do not have a [[math coprocessor]], so [[floating point]] arithmetic is performed by software. However, some recent designs do include an FPU and DSP optimized features. An example would be Microchip's PIC32 MIPS based line.

== Programming environments ==
Microcontrollers were originally programmed only in [[assembly language]], but various [[high-level programming language]]s, such as [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[JavaScript]], are now also in common use to target microcontrollers and [[embedded systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7389059 |title= Changing the programming paradigm for the embedded in the IoT domain |last1= Mazzei |first1= Daniele |last2= Montelisciani |first2= Gabriele |last3= Baldi |first3= Giacomo |last4= Fantoni |first4= Gualtiero |date= 2015 |publisher= IEEE |pages= 239–244 |conference=  Internet of Things (WF-IoT), 2015 IEEE 2nd World Forum on |location=Milan |doi= 10.1109/WF-IoT.2015.7389059}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Compiler]]s for general purpose languages will typically have some restrictions as well as enhancements to better support the unique characteristics of microcontrollers. Some microcontrollers have environments to aid developing certain types of applications. Microcontroller vendors often make tools freely available to make it easier to adopt their hardware.

Microcontrollers with specialty hardware may require their own non-standard dialects of C, such as [[Small Device C Compiler|SDCC for the 8051]], which prevent using standard tools (such as code libraries or static analysis tools) even for code unrelated to hardware features. [[Interpreter (computing)|Interpreters]] may also contain nonstandard features, such as [[MicroPython]], although a fork, [[CircuitPython]], has looked to move hardware dependencies to libraries and have the language adhere to a more [[CPython]] standard.

Interpreter firmware is also available for some microcontrollers. For example, [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] on the early microcontrollers [[Intel]] [[8052]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lvr.com/microc.htm "8052-Basic Microcontrollers"] by Jan Axelson 1994&lt;/ref&gt; BASIC and [[Forth (programming language)|FORTH]] on the [[Zilog Z8]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Edwards |first1=Robert |year=1987 |title=Optimizing the Zilog Z8 Forth Microcontroller for Rapid Prototyping |journal= |volume= |issue= |page=3 |publisher=Martin Marietta |doi= |url=http://www.ornl.gov/info/reports/1987/3445602791343.pdf |accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as some modern devices. Typically these interpreters support [[interactive programming]].

[[Logic simulation|Simulators]] are available for some microcontrollers. These allow a developer to analyze what the behavior of the microcontroller and their program should be if they were using the actual part. A [[simulator]] will show the internal processor state and also that of the outputs, as well as allowing input signals to be generated. While on the one hand most simulators will be limited from being unable to simulate much other hardware in a system, they can exercise conditions that may otherwise be hard to reproduce at will in the physical implementation, and can be the quickest way to debug and analyze problems.

Recent microcontrollers are often integrated with on-chip [[debug]] circuitry that when accessed by an [[in-circuit emulator]] (ICE) via [[JTAG]], allow debugging of the firmware with a [[debugger]]. A real-time ICE may allow viewing and/or manipulating of internal states while running. A tracing ICE can record executed program and MCU states before/after a trigger point.

Many others exist, some of which are used in very narrow range of applications or are more like applications processors than microcontrollers. The microcontroller market is extremely fragmented, with numerous vendors, technologies, and markets. Note that many vendors sell or have sold multiple architectures.

== Interrupt latency ==
In contrast to general-purpose computers, microcontrollers used in embedded systems often seek to optimize [[interrupt latency]] over instruction throughput. Issues include both reducing the latency, and making it be more predictable (to support real-time control).

When an electronic device causes an interrupt, during the [[context switch]] the intermediate results (registers) have to be saved before the software responsible for handling the interrupt can run. They must also be restored after that [[interrupt handler]] is finished. If there are more [[processor register]]s, this saving and restoring process takes more time, increasing the latency. Ways to reduce such context/restore latency include having relatively few registers in their central processing units (undesirable because it slows down most non-interrupt processing substantially), or at least having the hardware not save them all (this fails if the software then needs to compensate by saving the rest "manually"). Another technique involves spending silicon gates on "shadow registers": One or more duplicate registers used only by the interrupt software, perhaps supporting a dedicated stack.

Other factors affecting interrupt latency include:

* Cycles needed to complete current CPU activities. To minimize those costs, microcontrollers tend to have short pipelines (often three instructions or less), small write buffers, and ensure that longer instructions are continuable or restartable. [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] design principles ensure that most instructions take the same number of cycles, helping avoid the need for most such continuation/restart logic.
* The length of any [[critical section]] that needs to be interrupted. Entry to a critical section restricts concurrent data structure access. When a data structure must be accessed by an interrupt handler, the critical section must block that interrupt. Accordingly, interrupt latency is increased by however long that interrupt is blocked. When there are hard external constraints on system latency, developers often need tools to measure interrupt latencies and track down which critical sections cause slowdowns.
** One common technique just blocks all interrupts for the duration of the critical section. This is easy to implement, but sometimes critical sections get uncomfortably long.
** A more complex technique just blocks the interrupts that may trigger access to that data structure. This is often based on interrupt priorities, which tend to not correspond well to the relevant system data structures. Accordingly, this technique is used mostly in very constrained environments.
** Processors may have hardware support for some critical sections. Examples include supporting atomic access to bits or bytes within a word, or other atomic access primitives like the [[Load-link/store-conditional|LDREX/STREX]] exclusive access primitives introduced in the [[ARM architecture|ARMv6]] architecture.
* Interrupt nesting. Some microcontrollers allow higher priority interrupts to interrupt lower priority ones. This allows software to manage latency by giving time-critical interrupts higher priority (and thus lower and more predictable latency) than less-critical ones.
* Trigger rate. When interrupts occur back-to-back, microcontrollers may avoid an extra context save/restore cycle by a form of [[tail call]] optimization.

Lower end microcontrollers tend to support fewer interrupt latency controls than higher end ones.

== Microcontroller embedded memory technology ==
Since the emergence of microcontrollers, many different memory technologies have been used. Almost all microcontrollers have at least two different kinds of memory, a non-volatile memory for storing firmware and a read-write memory for temporary data.

=== Data ===
From the earliest microcontrollers to today, six-transistor SRAM is almost always used as the read/write working memory, with a few more transistors per bit used in the [[register file]]. [[Ferroelectric RAM|FRAM]] or [[Magnetoresistive random-access memory|MRAM]] could potentially replace it as it is {{nowrap|4 to 10 times}} denser which would make it more cost effective.

In addition to the SRAM, some microcontrollers also have internal EEPROM for data storage; and even ones that do not have any (or not enough) are often connected to external serial EEPROM chip (such as the [[BASIC Stamp]]) or external serial flash memory chip.

A few recent{{when|date=August 2016}} microcontrollers beginning in 2003 have "self-programmable" flash memory.&lt;ref name="flash"/&gt;

=== Firmware ===
The earliest microcontrollers used mask ROM to store firmware. Later microcontrollers (such as the early versions of the [[Freescale 68HC11]] and early [[PIC microcontroller]]s) had [[EPROM]] memory, which used a translucent window to allow erasure via UV light, while production versions had no such window, being OTP (one-time-programmable). Firmware updates were equivalent to replacing the microcontroller itself, thus many products were not upgradeable.

Motorola [[Motorola 68HC05|MC68HC805]] &lt;ref name="mc68ch805ref"/&gt; was the first microcontroller to use [[EEPROM]] to store the firmware. EEPROM microcontrollers became more popular in 1993 when Microchip introduced [[PIC16x84|PIC16C84]]&lt;ref name="pic16c84ref"/&gt; and Atmel introduced the an [[Intel MCS-51|8051-core]] microcontroller that was first one to use [[flash memory|NOR Flash memory]] to store the firmware.&lt;ref name="flash"/&gt; Today's microcontrollers almost exclusively use flash memory, with a few models using FRAM, and some ultra-low-cost parts still use OTP or Mask-ROM.

[[Image:Mobile phone signal.png|right|thumb|A display of bars on a mobile phone screen]]
A '''mobile phone signal''' (also known as '''reception''' and '''service''') is the [[signal strength]] (measured in [[dBm]]) received by a [[mobile phone]] from a [[cellular network]] (on the [[downlink]]). Depending on various factors, such as proximity to a [[cell site|tower]], any obstructions such as buildings or trees, etc. this signal strength will vary. Most mobile devices use a set of bars of increasing height to display the approximate strength of this received signal to the mobile phone user. Traditionally five bars are used. (see [[five by five]])

Generally, a strong mobile phone signal is more likely in an urban area, though these areas can also have some "dead zones", where no reception can be obtained. Cellular signals are designed to be resistant to [[Multipath interference|multipath]] reception, which is most likely to be caused by the blocking of a direct signal path by large buildings, such as [[high-rise]] towers. By contrast, many [[rural]] or sparsely inhabited areas lack any signal or have very weak [[fringe reception]]; many mobile phone providers are attempting to set up towers in those areas most likely to be occupied by users, such as along major [[highway]]s. Even some [[national park]]s and other popular [[tourism|tourist]] destinations away from urban areas now have cell phone reception, though location of [[radio tower]]s within these areas is normally prohibited or strictly regulated, and is often difficult to arrange.

In areas where signal reception would normally be strong, other factors can have an effect on reception or may cause complete failure (see [[RF interference]]). From inside a building with thick walls or of mostly [[sheet metal|metal]] construction (or with dense [[rebar]] in [[concrete]]), signal attenuation may prevent a mobile phone from being used. Underground areas, such as [[tunnel]]s and [[metro station|subway stations]], will lack reception unless they are wired for cell signals. There may also be gaps where the [[service contour]]s of the individual base stations (Cell towers) of the mobile provider (and/or its [[roaming]] partners) do not completely overlap.

In addition, the [[weather]] may affect the strength of a signal, due to the changes in [[radio propagation]] caused by [[cloud]]s (particularly tall and dense [[cumulonimbus|thunderclouds]] which cause [[signal reflection]]), [[precipitation]], and [[temperature inversion]]s. This phenomenon, which is also common in other [[VHF]] [[radio band]]s including [[FM broadcasting]], may also cause other anomalies, such as a person in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] "roaming" on a [[Mexico|Mexican]] tower from just over [[U.S.-Mexico border|the border]] in [[Tijuana, Baja California|Tijuana]], or someone in [[Detroit]] "roaming" on a [[Canada|Canadian]] tower located [[line-of-sight propagation|within sight]] across the [[Detroit River]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]]. These events may cause the user to be billed for "international" usage despite being in their own country, though mobile phone companies can program their [[Telecommunications billing|billing]] systems to re-rate these as domestic usage when it occurs on a foreign cell site that is known to frequently cause such issues for their customers.

The volume of network traffic can also cause calls to be blocked or dropped due to a [[disaster]] or other [[mass call event]] which [[network congestion|overload]]s the number of available [[radio channel]]s in an area, or the number of [[telephone circuit]]s connecting to and from the general [[public switched telephone network]].

== Dead zones ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}

Areas where [[mobile phone]]s cannot transmit to a nearby [[mobile Web|mobile site]], [[base station]], or [[repeater]] are known as '''dead zones'''.  In these areas, the mobile phone is said to be in a state of outage.  Dead zones are usually areas where mobile phone service is not available because the signal between the [[handset]] and mobile site [[antenna (radio)|antennas]] is blocked or severely [[attenuation|reduced]], usually by hilly [[terrain]], dense [[foliage]], or physical distance.

A number of factors can create dead zones, which may exist even in locations in which a [[mobile network operator|wireless carrier]] offers coverage, due to limitations in [[cellular network]] architecture (the locations of antennas), limited network density, interference with other mobile sites, and topography.  Since cell phones rely on [[radio wave]]s, which travel though the air and are easily attenuated (particularly at higher frequencies), mobile phones may be unreliable at times.  Like other radio transmissions, mobile phone calls can be interrupted by large [[building]]s, terrain, trees, or other objects between the phone and the nearest base. Cellular network providers work continually to improve and upgrade their networks in order to minimize [[Mobile phone signal#Dropped calls|dropped calls]], access failures, and dead zones (which they call "coverage holes" or "no-service areas"). For [[mobile virtual network operator]]s, the network quality depends entirely on the host network for the particular handset in question. Some MVNOs use more than one host, which may even have different technologies (for example, different [[Tracfone]] handsets uses either [[code-division multiple access|CDMA]] and [[1xRTT]] on [[Verizon Wireless]], or [[GSM]] and [[UMTS]] on [[AT&amp;T Mobility]]).

Dead zones can be filled-in with [[microcell]]s, while [[picocell]]s can handle even smaller areas without causing interference to the larger network.  Personal microcells, such as those for a [[home]], are called [[femtocell]]s, and generally have the [[broadcast range|range]] of a [[cordless phone]], but may not be usable for an MVNO phone.  A similar system can be set up to perform inmate call capture,&lt;ref&gt;https://transition.fcc.gov/pshs/docs/summits/Combating-Contraband-Cell-Phones-in-Prison-Handout-v4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which prevents cellphones [[smuggling|smuggled]] into a [[prison]] from being used. These still complete calls to or from pre-authorized users such as prison staff, while not violating laws against [[Mobile phone jammer|jamming]]. These systems must be carefully designed so as to avoid capturing calls from outside the prison, which would in effect create a dead zone for any passersby outside.

In the event of a disaster causing temporary dead zones, a [[Mobile cell sites#Cell on wheels|cell on wheels]] may be brought in until the local telecom [[infrastructure]] can be restored.  These portable units are also used where large gatherings are expected, in order to handle the extra load.

==Dropped calls==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
A '''dropped call''' is a common term used and expressed by [[wireless]] [[mobile phone]] [[telephone call|call]] subscribers when a call is abruptly cut-off (disconnected) during midconversation. This happens less often today than it would have in the early 1990s. The termination occurs unexpected and is influenced by a number of different reasons such as "Dead Zones." In technical circles, it is called an '''abnormal release'''.

One reason for a call to be "dropped" is if the mobile phone subscriber travels outside the coverage area—the [[cellular network]] radio tower(s).  After a telephone connection between two subscribers has been completed, it{{clarify|reason=no clear antecedent to 'it'|date=May 2018}}&lt;!--What is 'it'? The connection? or one of the cell phones?? --&gt; must remain within range of that subscribers&lt;!--possessive?--&gt; network provider or that connection will lost (dropped). Not all cellular telephone radio towers are owned by the same telephone company (though this is not true to all locations) &lt;!--something is missing here--&gt; be maintained across a different company's network (as calls cannot be re-routed over the traditional [[PSTN|phone network]] while in progress), also resulting in the termination of the call once a signal cannot be maintained between the phone and the original network.{{clarify|reason=that sentence needs to be taken out and shot|date=February 2017}}

Another common reason is when a phone is taken into an area where wireless communication is unavailable, interrupted, interfered with, or [[Mobile phone jammer|jammed]]. From the network's perspective, this is the same as the mobile moving out of the coverage area.

Occasionally, calls are dropped upon [[handoff]] between cells within the same provider's network. This may be due to an imbalance of traffic between the two [[cell site]]s' areas of coverage. If the new cell site is at capacity, it cannot accept the additional traffic of the call trying to "hand in." It may also be due to the network configuration not being set up properly, such that one cell site is not "aware" of the cell to which the phone is trying to handoff.  If the phone cannot find an alternative cell to which to move that can take over the call, the call is lost.

Co-channel and [[adjacent-channel interference]] can also be responsible for dropped calls in a wireless network.  Neighbouring cells with the same frequencies interfere with each other, deteriorating the quality of service and producing dropped calls.  Transmission problems are also a common cause of dropped calls.  Another problem may be a faulty [[transceiver]] inside the base station.

Calls can also be dropped if a mobile phone at the other end of the call loses [[battery (electricity)|battery]] power and stops transmitting abruptly.

[[Sunspot]]s and [[solar flare]]s are rarely blamed for causing interference leading to dropped calls, as it would take a major [[geomagnetic storm]] to cause such a disruption (except for [[satellite phone]]s).

Experiencing too many dropped calls is one of the most common customer complaints received by [[mobile network operator|wireless service providers]]. They have attempted to address the complaint in various ways, including expansion of their home network coverage, increased cell capacity, and offering refunds for individual dropped calls.

Various [[cellular repeater|signal booster]] systems are manufactured to reduce problems due to dropped calls and dead zones.  Many options, such as wireless units and antennas, are intended to aid in strengthening weak signals.

==ASU==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
Arbitrary Strength Unit ([[Mobile phone signal#ASU|ASU]]) is an [[integer]] value proportional to the received signal strength measured by the mobile phone.

It is possible to calculate the real signal strength measured in dBm (and thereby power in Watts) by a formula. However, there are different formulas for 2G, 3G and 4G networks.

In [[GSM]] networks, ASU maps to [[RSSI]] (received signal strength indicator, see TS 27.007&lt;ref name="3GPP TS 27.007"&gt;{{cite web|title=3GPP TS 27.007 version 8.5.0 Release 8|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/127000_127099/127007/08.05.00_60/ts_127007v080500p.pdf|website=etsi.org|publisher=ETSI|accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; sub clause 8.5).
:dBm = 2 × ASU - 113,  ASU in the range of 0..31 and 99 (for not known or not detectable).
In [[UMTS]] networks, ASU maps to [[RSCP]] level (received signal code power, see TS 27.007&lt;ref name="3GPP TS 27.007" /&gt; sub clause 8.69 and TS 25.133 sub clause 9.1.1.3).
:dBm = ASU - 116,     ASU in the range of -5..91 and 255 (for not known or not detectable).
In [[LTE_(telecommunication)]] networks, ASU maps to [[RSRP]] (reference signal received power, see TS 36.133, sub-clause 9.1.4). The valid range of ASU is from 0 to 97. For the range 1 to 96, ASU maps to 
:(ASU - 141) ≤ dBm &lt; (ASU - 140).
The value of 0 maps to RSRP below -140 dBm and the value of 97 maps to RSRP above -44 dBm.

On Android devices however, the original GSM formula may prevail for UMTS.&lt;ref name="lte-anbieter.inf0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lte-anbieter.info/technik/asu.php |title= ASU Wert - Signalstärke messen und interpretieren |trans-title= ASU parameter - measure and interpret signal strength |language= German |format= |work= |accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tools like Network Signal Info&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.android.telnet |title=Network Signal Info - Android Apps on Google Play |format= |work= |accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; can directly show the signal strength (in dBm), as well as the underlying ASU.

ASU shouldn't be confused with "Active Set Update". The Active Set Update is a signalling message used in handover procedures of UMTS and CDMA mobile telephony standards. On [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phones, the acronym ASU has nothing to do with Active Set Update. It has not been declared precisely by Google developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/NeighboringCellInfo.html|title=NeighboringCellInfo  -  Android Developers|author=|date=|website=Android Developers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-wires alternatives''' (NWAs) are electric utility system investments and operating practices that can defer or replace the need for specific transmission and/or distribution projects, at lower total resource cost, by reliably reducing transmission congestion or distribution system constraints at times of maximum demand in specific grid areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pubs.naruc.org/pub/536EF440-2354-D714-51CE-C1F37F9B3530 | title=Getting the Signals Straight: Modeling, Planning, and Implementing Non-Transmission Alternatives | publisher=National Regulatory Research Institute | date=February 2015 | accessdate=September 19, 2016 | author=Tom Stanton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmission-related NWAs are also known as non-transmission alternatives (NTAs). They can be identified through least-cost planning and action, one geographic area at a time, for managing electricity supply and demand using all means available and necessary, including demand response, distributed generation (DG), energy efficiency, electricity and thermal storage, load management, and rate design.

[[File:Research Center Kannapolis NC.jpg|thumb|right|David H. Murdock Core Laboratory on the North Carolina Research Campus]]
The '''North Carolina Research Campus''' (NCRC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncresearchcampus.net|title=North Carolina Research Campus}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a public-private research center in [[Kannapolis]], [[North Carolina]], [[United States]].  The Campus was envisioned by [[David H. Murdock]], owner of [[Dole Food Company]] and Castle and Cooke, Inc., as a center for improving human health through research into nutrition and agriculture. The campus was formed and operates as a partnership with the State of [[North Carolina]] and the [[University of North Carolina]] system.

The scientists at the NC Research Campus are known for research that explores the health benefits of plant [[phytochemical]]s, nutrients such as [[choline]] and the impact of nutrition and exercise on human performance. Research also involves the study of nutrients and plant-based compounds to prevent [[chronic diseases]] such as cancer and diabetes.

== About ==
[[File:NC Research Campus logo 2013.png|frameless|right]]
The North Carolina Research Campus is located in Kannapolis, NC, near Charlotte. As a scientific community of eight universities, the David H. Murdock Research Institute, global companies and entrepreneurs, the shared mission is to improve human health through nutrition. Research and development focuses on safer, more nutritious crops, healthier foods and precision nutrition.

== History ==

{{Prose|section|date=November 2017}}
* '''1982''' [[David H. Murdock]], chairman and owner of [[Dole Food Company]] bought the textile mill then known as [[Cannon Mills]], the largest manufacturer of home textiles in the world.
* '''1986'''  Murdock's firm Pacific Holding Company sells the mill. Murdock retains substantial property holdings in Kannapolis. The mill later became known as Fieldcrest Cannon and later Pillowtex.
* '''2003''' [[Pillowtex Corporation]] files for bankruptcy in 2003, and the mill closes. This results in the largest mass layoff of workers in North Carolina history.
* '''2005'''  Along with support from the state of North Carolina and the University of North Carolina system, Murdock announces the establishment of the North Carolina Research Campus.
* '''2006'''  Murdock acquires the Pillowtex site and demolishes the mill. Construction starts quickly on the North Carolina Research Campus after the six-million-square-foot textile mill is demolished.
* '''2008'''  The first building, the 311,000 square-foot David H. Murdock Research Core Laboratory, opens along with the [[North Carolina State University]] Plants for Human Health Institute building and the [[UNC Chapel Hill]] Nutrition Research Institute building.
* '''2012''' The headquarters of the Cabarrus Health Alliance, the regional public health authority, opens.
* '''2013''' A 60,000 square foot Class A medical office building opens with Carolinas Healthcare System as the main tenant.
* '''2015'''  In November, Mark Spitzer is chosen by Murdock to be the new Vice President of Operations for Castle &amp; Cooke North Carolina. In December, Kannapolis dedicates the City Hall &amp; Police Headquarters, a 100,000 square-foot facility standing opposite the David H. Murdock Core Laboratory, on land donated by Murdock.
* '''2016'''  BioArmor, a company that employs nanotechnology to produce hand sanitizers that do not use alcohol leases space in the David H. Murdock Core Laboratory. Discovery MS, a non-profit research initiative housed in the David H. Murdock Research Institute, launches with an announcement of several ongoing multiple sclerosis research projects. Ei, A Pharmaceutical Solutionworks™ begins moving a 24-person research and development team, known as Endev Laboratories, into a 10,000-square-foot laboratory with office space on the third floor of the building.
* '''2017'''  Ideal Health Biotechnology opens its first office at the North Carolina Research Campus. Klear Optix joins the North Carolina Research Campus.  Catawba College joins in partnership with the North Carolina Research Campus to assist with marketing and business development projects. The Standard Process Center for Excellence is announced and will open in 2019 on the first floor of the laboratory building. The North Carolina Food Processing &amp; Innovation Center, a partnership with the NC State and the NC Department of Agriculture, is announced as another tenant in the building.

Since about 2001 the term '''nuclear renaissance''' has been used to refer to a possible [[nuclear power]] industry revival, driven by rising [[Price of petroleum|fossil fuel prices]] and new concerns about meeting [[greenhouse gas]] emission limits.&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf104.html The Nuclear Renaissance (by the World Nuclear Association)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 ''World Energy Outlook'', the [[International Energy Agency]] stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A nuclear renaissance is possible but cannot occur overnight. Nuclear projects face significant hurdles, including extended construction periods and related risks, long licensing processes and manpower shortages, plus long‐standing issues related to waste disposal, proliferation and local opposition. The financing of new nuclear power plants, especially in liberalized markets, has always been difficult and the financial crisis seems almost certain to have made it even more so. The huge capital requirements, combined with risks of cost overruns and regulatory uncertainties, make investors and lenders very cautious, even when demand growth is robust.&lt;ref name=iea2009&gt;International Energy Agency, ''World Energy Outlook'', 2009, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[World Nuclear Association]] reported that nuclear electricity generation in 2012 was at its lowest level since 1999.&lt;ref name=wna13/&gt;

==History==
In 2009 annual generation of nuclear power has been on a slight downward trend since 2007, decreasing 1.8% in 2009 to 2558 TWh with nuclear power meeting 13–14% of the world's electricity demand.&lt;ref name=WNAMay/&gt;&lt;ref name=nei&gt;[http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectioncode=132&amp;storyCode=2053966 Nuclear decline set to continue, says report] ''Nuclear Engineering International'', 27 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A major factor in the decrease has been the prolonged repair of seven large reactors at the [[Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant]] in Japan following the Niigata-Chuetsu-Oki earthquake.&lt;ref name=WNAMay&gt;[[World Nuclear Association]].

The [[World Nuclear Association]] has reported that “nuclear power generation suffered its biggest ever one-year fall through 2012 as the bulk of the Japanese fleet remained offline for a full calendar year”. Data from the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] showed that nuclear power plants globally produced 2346 TWh of electricity in 2012 – seven per cent less than in 2011. The figures illustrate the effects of a full year of 48 Japanese power reactors producing no power during the year. The permanent closure of eight reactor units in Germany was also a factor. Problems at Crystal River, Fort Calhoun and the two San Onofre units in the USA meant they produced no power for the full year, while in Belgium Doel 3 and Tihange 2 were out of action for six months. Compared to 2010, the nuclear industry produced 11% less electricity in 2012.&lt;ref name=wna13&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_Nuclear_power_down_in_2012_2006131.html |title=Nuclear power down in 2012 |author=WNA |date=June 20, 2013 |work=World Nuclear News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2013, "a total of 437 nuclear reactors were operating in 30 countries, seven fewer than the historical maximum of 444 in 2002. Since 2002, utilities have started up 28 units and disconnected 36 including six units at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan.

The 2011 World Energy Outlook report by the [[International Energy Agency]] stated that having "second thoughts on nuclear would have far-reaching consequences" and that a substantial shift away from nuclear power would boost demand for fossil fuels, putting additional upward pressure on the price of energy, raising additional concerns about energy security, and making it more difficult and expensive to combat climate change.&lt;ref name="World Energy Outlook 2011"&gt;International Energy Agency [http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/weo2011sum.pdf "World Energy Outlook 2011"], International Energy Agency 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The reports suggests that the consequences would be most severe for nations with limited local energy resources and which have been planning to rely heavily on nuclear power for future energy security, and that it would make it substantially more challenging for developing economies to satisfy their rapidly increasing demand for electricity.&lt;ref name="World Energy Outlook 2011"/&gt;

John Rowe, chair of [[Exelon]] (the largest nuclear power producer in the US), has said that the nuclear renaissance is "dead". He says that solar, wind and cheap natural gas have significantly reduced the prospects of coal and nuclear power plants around the world. [[Amory Lovins]] says that the sharp and steady cost reductions in [[solar power]] has been a "stunning market success".&lt;ref name=lovi12&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137246/amory-b-lovins/a-farewell-to-fossil-fuels |title=A Farewell to Fossil Fuels |author=Amory Lovins |date=March–April 2012 |work=Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the analysts at the investment research firm [[Morningstar, Inc.]] concluded that nuclear power was not a viable source of new power in the West. On nuclear renaissance they wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The economies of scale experienced in France during its initial build-out and the related strength of supply chain and labor pool were imagined by the dreamers who have coined the term ‘nuclear renaissance’ for the rest of the world. But outside of China and possibly South Korea this concept seems a fantasy, as should become clearer examining even theoretical projections for new nuclear build today.&lt;ref name=forbes-20131110&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2013/11/10/new-build-nuclear-is-dead-morningstar/ |title=New-Build Nuclear Is Dead: Morningstar |author=Jeff Mcmahon |newspaper=Forbes |date=November 10, 2013 |accessdate=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, safety risks may be the greatest when nuclear systems are the newest, and operators have less experience with them. Nuclear engineer [[David Lochbaum]] explained that almost all serious nuclear accidents occurred with what was at the time the most recent technology. He argues that "the problem with new reactors and accidents is twofold: scenarios arise that are impossible to plan for in simulations; and humans make mistakes".&lt;ref name=safe&gt;[[Benjamin K.

{{Main|Public opinion on nuclear issues}}
In 2005, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] presented the results of a series of public opinion surveys in the ''Global Public Opinion on Nuclear Issues'' report.&lt;ref name= IAE/&gt; Majorities of respondents in 14 of the 18 countries surveyed believe that the risk of [[nuclear terrorism|terrorist acts involving radioactive materials]] at nuclear facilities is high, because of insufficient protection. While majorities of citizens generally support the continued use of existing nuclear power reactors, most people do not favour the building of new nuclear plants, and 25% of respondents feel that all nuclear power plants should be closed down.&lt;ref name= IAE/&gt; Stressing the [[climate change]] benefits of nuclear energy positively influences 10% of people to be more supportive of expanding the role of nuclear power in the world, but there is still a general reluctance to support the building of more nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name=IAE&gt;[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (2005).

Two-thirds of the respondents said they would protest the construction of a nuclear reactor within 50 miles of their homes.&lt;ref name="Kate Sheppard"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2011/03/nuclear-power-public-opinion-poll | title = Public Opinion on Nuclear Goes Critical.|author = Kate Sheppard |date = March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was little support across the world for building new nuclear reactors, a 2011 poll for the BBC indicates. The global research agency [[GlobeScan]], commissioned by BBC News, polled 23,231 people in 23 countries from July to September 2011, several months after the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]]. In countries with existing nuclear programmes, people are significantly more opposed than they were in 2005, with only the UK and US bucking the trend. Most believe that boosting [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and [[renewable energy]] can meet their needs.&lt;ref name=rb2011&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15864806 |title=Nuclear power 'gets little public support worldwide' |author=Richard Black |date=November 25, 2011 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2007 and 2009, 13 companies applied to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] for construction and operating licenses to build 30 new [[nuclear power]] reactors in the [[United States]]. 
However, the case for widespread nuclear plant construction was eroded due to abundant natural gas supplies, slow electricity demand growth in a weak US economy, lack of financing, and uncertainty following the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]].&lt;ref name=us12/&gt; Many license applications for proposed new reactors were suspended or cancelled.&lt;ref name=eo&gt;Eileen O'Grady.

===Asia===
As of 2008, the greatest growth in nuclear generation was expected to be in China, Japan, South Korea and India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf47.html Asia's Nuclear Energy Growth]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of early 2013 [[China]] had 17 nuclear reactors operating and 32 under construction, with more planned. "China is rapidly becoming self-sufficient in reactor design and construction, as well as other aspects of the fuel cycle."&lt;ref name="Nuclear Power in China"/&gt; However, according to a government research unit, China must not build "too many nuclear power reactors too quickly", in order to avoid a shortfall of fuel, equipment and qualified plant workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-11/china-should-control-pace-of-reactor-construction-outlook-says.html |title=China Should Control Pace of Reactor Construction, Outlook Says |date=January 11, 2011 |work=Bloomberg News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Fukushima disaster, many are questioning the mass roll-out of new plants in India, including the World Bank, the Indian Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh, and the former head of the country's nuclear regulatory body, A. Gopalakrishnan. The massive [[Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project]] is the focus of concern – "931 hectares of farmland will be needed to build the reactors, land that is now home to 10,000 people, their mango orchards, cashew trees and rice fields". Fishermen in the region say their livelihoods will be wiped out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/indian-antinuclear-protesters-will-not-be-deterred-20110422-1drcv.html |title=Indian anti-nuclear protesters will not be deterred |author=Ben Doherty |date=April 23, 2011 |work=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Australia ====
Australia is a major producer of uranium, which it exports as [[uranium oxide]] to nuclear power generating nations. Australia has a single research reactor at [[Lucas Heights Reactor|Lucas Heights]], but does not generate electricity via nuclear power. As of 2015, the majority of the nation's uranium mines are in South Australia, where a [[Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission]] is investigating the opportunities and costs of expanding the state's role in the [[nuclear fuel cycle]]. As of January 2016, new nuclear industrial development (other than the mining of uranium) is prohibited by various acts of federal and state legislation. The Federal government will consider the findings of the South Australian Royal Commission after it releases its findings in 2016.

===Canada===
With several [[CANDU]] reactors [[Nuclear power in Canada#Refurbishment or closure|facing closure]] selected plants will be completely refurbished between 2016 and 2026, extending their operation beyond 2050.

On 18 October 2010 the British government announced [[Proposed nuclear power stations in the United Kingdom|eight locations]] it considered suitable for future nuclear power stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nuclear power: Eight sites identified for future plants|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11564152|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 October 2010|date=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in public opposition and protests at some of the sites. In March 2012, two of the big six power companies announced they would be pulling out of developing new nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name=scotty/&gt; The decision by [[RWE npower]] and [[E.ON]] follows uncertainty over nuclear energy following the Fukushima nuclear disaster last year.&lt;ref name=scotty/&gt; The companies will not proceed with their Horizon project, which was to develop nuclear reactors at Wylfa in North Wales and at Oldbury-on-Severn in Gloucestershire.&lt;ref name=scotty/&gt; Their decision follows a similar announcement by Scottish and Southern Electricity last year. Analysts said the decision meant the future of UK nuclear power could now be in doubt.&lt;ref name=scotty&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/scotland/nuclear-disaster-casts-shadow-over-future-of-uk-s-energy-plans-1-2205614 |title=Nuclear disaster casts shadow over future of UK’s energy plans |author=David Maddox |date=March 30, 2012 |work=The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 Japanese [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] has led some European energy officials to "think twice about nuclear expansion".&lt;ref name="Heather Timmons"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/business/energy-environment/15power.html |title=Emerging Economies Move Ahead With Nuclear Plans |author=Heather Timmons |date=March 14, 2011 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Switzerland]] has abandoned plans to replace its old nuclear reactors and will take the last one offline in 2034. [[Anti-nuclear movement in Germany|Anti-nuclear opposition]] intensified in [[Germany]]. In the following months [[Cabinet Merkel II|the government]] decided to shut down eight reactors immediately (August 6, 2011) and to have the other nine off the grid by the end of 2022. [[Renewable energy in Germany]] is believed to be able to compensate for much of the loss. In September 2011 Siemens, which had been responsible for constructing all 17 of Germany's existing nuclear power plants, announced that it would exit the [[nuclear sector]] following the Fukushima disaster and the subsequent changes to German energy policy. Chief executive Peter Loescher has supported the German government's planned [[energy transition]] to renewable energy technologies, calling it a "project of the century" and saying Berlin's target of reaching 35% renewable energy sources by 2020 was feasible.&lt;ref name="Siemens to quit nuclear industry"/&gt;

On October 21, 2013, EDF Energy announced that an agreement had been reached regarding new nuclear plants to be built on the site of [[Hinkley Point C]]. EDF Group and the UK Government agreed on the key commercial terms of the investment contract. The final investment decision is still conditional on completion of the remaining key steps, including the agreement of the EU Commission.&lt;ref&gt;http://press.edf.com/fichiers/fckeditor/Commun/Presse/Communiques/EDF/2013/cp_20131021-1_va.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, [[Amory Lovins]] commented that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Britain's plan for a fleet of new nuclear power stations is … unbelievable ... It is economically daft. The guaranteed price [being offered to French state company EDF] is over seven times the unsubsidised price of new wind in the US, four or five times the unsubsidised price of new solar power in the US. Nuclear prices only go up. Renewable energy prices come down. There is absolutely no business case for nuclear. The British policy has nothing to do with economic or any other rational base for decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/17/amory-lovins-renewable-energy |title= Amory Lovins: energy visionary sees renewables revolution in full swing |author=John Vidal |date=February 18, 2014 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010 [[Russia]] announced new plans to start building 10 new nuclear reactors in the next year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaltimes.cn/www/english/sci-edu/world/2010-04/519559.html Russia prioritizes development of nuclear energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views and opinions==

In June 2009, [[Mark Cooper (academic)|Mark Cooper]] from the [[Vermont Law School]] said: "The highly touted renaissance of nuclear power is based on fiction, not fact... There are numerous options available to meet the need for electricity in a carbon-constrained environment that are superior to building nuclear reactors".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Cooper (academic)|Mark Cooper]]. [http://www.vermontlaw.edu/Documents/Cooper%20Report%20on%20Nuclear%20Economics%20FINAL%5B1%5D.pdf The Economics of Nuclear Reactors: Renaissance or Relapse?] Vermont Law School, June 2009, p. 1 and p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In September 2009, [[Luc Oursel]], chief executive of Areva Nuclear Plants (the core nuclear reactor manufacturing division of [[Areva]]) stated: "We are convinced about the nuclear renaissance". Areva has been hiring up to 1,000 people a month, "to prepare for a surge in orders from around the world".&lt;ref name=ar&gt;[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/engineering/article6851514.ece Areva rushes to hire workers as demand for nuclear reactors explodes]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June 2010, Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded Areva’s debt rating to [[Bond credit rating|BBB+]] due to weakened profitability.&lt;ref name=SP-BBB&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mineweb.co.za/mineweb/view/mineweb/en/page72103?oid=107035&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=102055 |title=S&amp;P downgrades French nuclear-uranium giant AREVA on weakened profitability |author=Dorothy Kosich |publisher=Mineweb |date=29 Jun 2010 |accessdate=6 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004210130/http://www.mineweb.co.za/mineweb/view/mineweb/en/page72103?oid=107035&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=102055 |archivedate=October 4, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Trevor Findlay]] from the ''[[Centre for International Governance Innovation]]'' stated that "despite some powerful drivers and clear advantages, a revival of nuclear energy faces too many barriers compared to other means of generating electricity for it to capture a growing market share to 2030".&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Findlay (2010). [http://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/Nuclear%20Energy%20Futures%20Overview.pdf The Future of Nuclear Energy to 2030 and its Implications for Safety, Security and Nonproliferation: Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512210155/http://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/Nuclear%20Energy%20Futures%20Overview.pdf |date=May 12, 2013 }}, The Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, the [[International Solar Energy Society]] stated that "... it appears that the pace of nuclear plant retirements will exceed the development of the few new plants now being contemplated, so that nuclear power may soon start on a downward trend. It will remain to be seen if it has any place in an affordable future world energy policy".&lt;ref&gt;Donald W. Aitken. [http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/downloads/ Transitioning to a Renewable Energy Future], [[International Solar Energy Society]], January 2010, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, Steve Kidd from the [[World Nuclear Association]] said: "Proof of whether the mooted nuclear renaissance is merely 'industry hype' as some commentators suggest or reality will come over the next decade".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen W. Kidd. [http://nuclearstreet.com/blogs/nuclear_power_news/archive/2010/03/11/wna-director-nuclear-reborn-03112.aspx WNA Director: Nuclear Reborn?] ''Nuclear Street'', March 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Kidd characterised the situation as a nuclear slowdown, requiring the industry to focus on better economics and improving public acceptance.&lt;ref name=nei-20130805&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/opinion/opinionnuclear-slowdown-why-did-it-happen/ |title=Nuclear slowdown – why did it happen? |author=Steve Kidd |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=August 5, 2013 |accessdate=August 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, physicist Michael Dittmar stated that: "Nuclear fission's contribution to total electric energy has decreased from about 18 per cent a decade ago to about 14 per cent in 2008. On a worldwide scale, nuclear energy is thus only a small component of the global energy mix and its share, contrary to widespread belief, is not on the rise".&lt;ref name=ditt/&gt;

In March 2011, Alexander Glaser said: "It will take time to grasp the full impact of the unimaginable human tragedy unfolding after the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|earthquake and tsunami in Japan]], but it is already clear that the proposition of a global nuclear renaissance ended on that day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/op-eds/after-the-nuclear-renaissance-the-age-of-discovery |title=After the nuclear renaissance: The age of discovery | author=Alexander Glaser |date=March 17, 2011 |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] said: "The nuclear waste issue, although often ignored in industry press releases and sponsored reports, is the proverbial elephant in the room stopping a nuclear renaissance".&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', [[World Scientific]], p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1980–1990 ==

=== Soviet–Afghan War ===
In total, the [[Sukhoi Su-25]] amassed a total of 60,000 sorties throughout its service in [[Afghanistan]] until the Soviet withdrawal in February 1989. The first combat Su-25 unit to be formed was the 200th Independent Attack Squadron (OShAE) based out of [[Sitalçay|Sital-Chai]] in [[Soviet Azerbaijan]]. The first aircraft from the unit arrived in Afghanistan in the summer of 1981, with the full unit deploying in June to [[Shindand Air Base|Shindand airfield]] in the western part of the country. The deployment was called Operation ''Exam'' and involved a team of engineers and technicians who would oversee the aircraft and evaluate its performance. The first Su-25 combat missions began on 25 July with the 200th OShAE flying counterinsurgency sorties and close air support in support of the [[5th Guards Motor Rifle Division|5th Motorized Rifle Division]]. By 1982, the Su-25's area of responsibility expanded and the aircraft began flying missions sometimes as far as [[Kabul]] with pilots flying on average 4–5, sometimes as many as 8, sorties a day. The aircraft typically flew with external fuel tanks to increase its range but was barred from flying in poor weather conditions or nighttime due to faulty navigational equipment. By the time the squadron left Afghanistan in October 1982, its Su-25s had logged more than 2,000 sorties with no losses, however some had sustained damage due to ground fire. The deployment allowed engineers to make several modifications to the aircraft's weapons systems, replacing them with ones more suited for mountain operations and installing increased countermeasures and defensive systems.&lt;ref name="Mladeno2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Mladenov|title=Sukhoi Su-25 Frogfoot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mbCdCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44|date=20 September 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4728-0478-5|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Su-25 at Le Bourget, 1989.JPEG|thumb|Soviet Su-25 Frogfoot aircraft on display at the 38th [[Paris Air Show|Paris International Air and Space Show]] in 1989.]]

The introduction of the Su-25 in Afghanistan led to a vastly expanded scope of operations by Soviet ground commanders who could now insert their troops deeper into guerrilla territory with better air cover. The [[Mujahideen]] grew to fear and respect the Su-25 as the war grew on, adapting their tactics around the assumption of its use.&lt;ref name="Jalali2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ali Ahmad Jalali|title=Afghan Guerrilla Warfare: In the Words of the Mjuahideen Fighters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3VJJDijysx8C&amp;pg=PA227|date=18 January 2002|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-61060-069-9|pages=227–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Su-25s were used as development platforms for Soviet precision guided munitions, being some of the first Soviet aircraft to use such munitions in combat, typically against cave entrances or weapons storage sites. In April 1986, the Su-25 used a precision-guided weapon in combat for the first time, firing a [[Kh-25]] and [[Kh-29]] missile against enemy targets. The introduction of precision bombs and missiles allowed the Su-25 to begin flying missions at higher-altitude, reducing the risk posed by anti-aircraft artillery and shoulder launched surface-to-air missiles.&lt;ref name="GordonDawes2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yefim Gordon|author2=Alan Dawes|title=Russian Air Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RAYiAQAAIAAJ|year=2002|publisher=Airlife|isbn=978-1-84037-240-3|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the fact Su-25s were often tasked with flying low-altitude, subsonic, close air support missions in support of ground forces in combat, they made frequent targets for [[Mujahideen]] anti-aircraft fire and [[surface-to-air missiles]]. Some 23 aircraft were shot down over the course of the war, with an additional dozen or so were lost in non-combat related incidents, while another dozen were written off due to extensive damage, and a further nine were destroyed by bombardments on the ground in [[Kabul]] and [[Kandahar]]. In all, Su-25s represented a quarter of Soviet Air Force (VVS) fixed-wing losses in the campaign.&lt;ref name="Mladen2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Mladenov|title=Sukhoi Su-25 Frogfoot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oYmHCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT91|date=20 September 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4728-0479-2|pages=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 January 1984, a Su-25 piloted by a Soviet lieutenant colonel was struck by a [[9K32 Strela-2|SA-7 missile]] and downed near [[Urgun]], Afghanistan, making it the first shootdown of a Su-25 in the war.&lt;ref name="ejection-history.org.uk 1978"&gt;{{cite web |title=Date |website=ejection-history.org.uk |date=1978-10-17 |url=http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/Country-By-Country/Russia_USSR.htm |access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1988, a Su-25 piloted by Colonel [[Alexander Rutskoy]] was hit by anti-aircraft fire and crashed. Rutskoy ejected but landed on Pakistani soil where he was captured and later repatriated to the Soviets. Some sources state he was shot down by Pakistani warplanes.&lt;ref name="attack"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sukhoi Su-25 |website=attack |url=http://www.aviastar.org/air/russia/su-25.php |access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft's wreckage was reportedly salvaged by Pakistan and handed over to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Sirrs2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Owen L. Sirrs|title=Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate: Covert Action and Internal Operations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_S-TDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126|date=July 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-19609-9|pages=126–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October of that year, a Su-25 sustained a powerful hit at high-altitude north of [[Gardez]], heavily damaging it but remaining flyable. The strike was reportedly the result of a missile fired by a Pakistani fighter jet.&lt;ref name="Madenov2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Mladenov|title=Su-25 'Frogfoot' Units In Combat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wbGdCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53|date=20 April 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4728-0568-3|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1989, a missile hit a Su-25 near Kabul killing the pilot in the last combat loss of the aircraft in Afghanistan.

=== Iran–Iraq War ===
The [[Iraqi Air Force]] was the first non-Eastern Bloc country to receive the Su-25, with Iraq receiving 69 'K' single-seat variants and four 'UBK' two-seater variants between 1986 and 1987, enough to equip two ground-attack regiments. The Su-25 saw extensive use in the latter stages of the [[Iran–Iraq War]], its first action outside of Afghanistan, in combat against Iranian forces. One Su-25K purportedly survived a direct hit from an Iranian [[MIM-23 Hawk]] surface-to-air missile battery, managing to return to base and land. In total, the Su-25 took part in 900 combat sorties in the conflict and many of their pilots were personally decorated by [[Saddam Hussein]].&lt;ref name="Suk 1975"&gt;{{cite web |title=Suj-25 and Su-25TM, Soviet Union, Russia |website=???? – ?????????? |date=1975-02-22 |url=http://www.airforceworld.com/attacker/eng/su25-striker-frogfoot-russia-1.htm |access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Su-25Ks were lost in combat in the war, of which one was lost to Iranian air defenses.&lt;ref name="Mlanov2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Mladenov|title=Su-25 'Frogfoot' Units In Combat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wbGdCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81|date=20 April 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4728-0568-3|pages=81–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1990–2000 ==

=== Persian Gulf War ===
[[File:Destroyed Iraqi Su-25.jpg|thumb|right|A Su-25 Frogfoot aircraft destroyed during Operation Desert Storm]]
The [[Iraqi Air Force]]'s Su-25 aircraft played little part in the [[Persian Gulf War]] as did most Iraqi aircraft. At least one Su-25 squadron saw action during the August 1990 [[Invasion of Kuwait]]. During the war, seven of the IAF's Su-25 aircraft were flown to neighboring Iran to shield them from air strikes.&lt;ref name="Iran"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.janes.co.uk/defence/air_forces/news/jdw/jdw060913_1_n.shtml |title="Iran bolsters Su-25 fleet" |accessdate=2013-02-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008004044/http://www.janes.co.uk/defence/air_forces/news/jdw/jdw060913_1_n.shtml |archivedate=8 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}.

=== Angolan Civil War ===

Angola received its first batch of Su-25 jets from the Soviet Union in 1988.&lt;ref name="?? - ?????????? 1975"&gt;{{cite web |title=Su-25 Russia Airforce |website=???? - ?????????? |date=1975-02-22 |url=http://www.airforceworld.com/attacker/eng/su252.htm |access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Angolan Civil War]], the [[Angolan Air Force]] used the Su-25 against [[UNITA]] forces advancing on [[Luanda]] but to little tactical effect as they often flew bombing missions from high altitudes, reducing the aircraft's effectiveness, an issue exacerbated by a withdrawal of Soviet support in 1991 which caused serviceability issues.&lt;ref name="Mladenov205"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Mladenov|title=Su-25 'Frogfoot' Units In Combat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wbGdCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82|date=20 April 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4728-0568-3|pages=82–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Su-25 was also flown by mercenaries from the South African private military company [[Executive Outcomes]] based out of [[Saurimo Airport]] against UNITA forces beginning in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Jr.Kelty2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Schaub Jr.|author2=Ryan Kelty|title=Private Military and Security Contractors: Controlling the Corporate Warrior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wpg5DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13|date=16 June 2016|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-4422-6023-8|pages=13–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== War in Abkhazia ===
During the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|War in Abkhazia]], the Su-25 was used by the [[Georgian Air Force]], the [[Abkhazian Air Force]], and the [[Russian Air Force]] in a series of combat actions in the breakaway province. The Georgian Air Force flew as many as 215 combat missions in the Su-25 during the war.&lt;ref name="Mlaenov205"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Mladenov|title=Su-25 'Frogfoot' Units In Combat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wbGdCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64|date=20 April 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4728-0568-3|pages=64–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian Su-25s flying on the side of Abkhazian separatists performed numerous raids on Georgian positions near the besieged port city of [[Sukhumi]], flying out of an airfield in [[Gudauta]].&lt;ref name="Mladenov013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Mladenov|title=Sukhoi Su-25 Frogfoot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mbCdCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56|date=20 September 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4728-0478-5|pages=56–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The New York Times 1993"&gt;{{cite web |title=Georgian Regional Capital Under Aerial Attack |website=The New York Times |date=1993-09-21 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/21/world/georgian-regional-capital-under-aerial-attack.html |access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On at least one occasion, a Russian Su-25 bombed a residential district of Sukhumi, killing a civilian and destroying numerous homes and other buildings.&lt;ref name="UPI 1993"&gt;{{cite web |title=Georgia blames Russia for attack |website=UPI |date=1993-02-21 |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/02/21/Georgia-blames-Russia-for-attack/9073730270800/ |access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the conflict, the Russian government asserted that Su-25s bombing Georgian positions were not Russian but, in fact, Georgian warplanes with painted Russian insignia, a claim that drew much doubt since many of these Su-25 aircraft were flying uninhibited through Russian airspace.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch &amp;#124; Defending Human Rights Worldwide 1992"&gt;{{cite web |title=RUSSIA |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=1992-06-15 |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1993/russia/ |access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 January 1993, a Georgian Su-25 crashed in Abkhazia province with the pilot ejecting to safety. On 19 March 1993, a Russian Air Force Su-25 piloted by Major Vazlav Shipko was shot down by Georgian air defenses near Sukhumi, however some sources state he was flying a [[Su-27]]. On 4 July 1993, a Georgian Su-25 was struck by an Abkhazian surface-to-air missile, forcing the aircraft into the sea off Sukhumi and killing the pilot.&lt;ref name="ejection-history.org.uk 1993"&gt;{{cite web |title=2005 |website=ejection-history.org.uk |date=1993-02-05 |url=http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/PROJECT/YEAR_Pages/1993.htm |access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eritrean–Ethiopian War ===
The [[Ethiopian Air Force]] operated the Su-25 during the [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War]], after receiving a delivery of a pair of Su-25Ts and two Su-25UBKs from the Russian Air Force in March 2000. Combat operations were flown from [[Mek'ele]] and [[Bishoftu|Debre Zeyit]].&lt;ref name="Mladenov201"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Mladenov|title=Su-25 'Frogfoot' Units In Combat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Y2HCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT139|date=20 April 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4728-0569-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 May 2000, a Su-25 piloted by [[Flight Lieutenant]] Wondu Ghenda was shot down by an [[Eritrean Air Force]] [[MiG-29]], killing the pilot.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5nDhCzUZj?url=http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_189.shtml "Ethiopia."] acig.org.

=== Chechen War ===
Su-25s saw heavy use by the [[Russian Air Force]] again during the [[First Chechen War|First]] and [[Second Chechen War]]. During the First Chechen War, some 140 Su-25s flew 5,300 strike sorties, notably playing an instrumental role in the destruction and the capture of the heavily defended [[Presidential Palace, Grozny|Grozny Presidential Palace]], dropping [[BETAB-500]] anti-concrete bombs on it.&lt;ref name="The National Interest 2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=Russia's Very Own A-10: Meet the Su-25 Frogfoot |website=The National Interest |date=2017-06-21 |url=http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/russias-very-own-10-meet-the-su-25-frogfoot-21257 |access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sukhoi015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Mladenov|title=Su-25 'Frogfoot' Units In Combat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wbGdCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71|date=20 April 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4728-0568-3|pages=71–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Russian Su-25s rarely operated at night or in poor weather due to faulty equipment and insufficient training, and aircraft rarely used precision munitions, utilizing unguided bombs and rockets for the most part instead.&lt;ref name="GeoHistory 2006"&gt;{{cite web |title=Military Learning Between the Chechen Wars |website=GeoHistory |date=2006-10-24 |url=http://geohistory.today/military-learning-chechen-wars/ |access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of precision munitions and poor training led to several [[friendly fire]] incidents where Russian aircraft hit buildings occupied by Russian troops. However, Russian air losses during the campaign were low due to a lack of capable air defenses. Four Su-25s were lost in combat.

[[File:Evstafiev-chechnya-palace-gunman.jpg|thumb|left|Presidential palace in Grozny in 1995.]]
* On 4 February 1995, a Su-25 piloted by Major Nikolay Bairov crashed three miles southeast of [[Grozny]] after being hit by [[ZSU-23-4]] anti-aircraft fire. The pilot was able to eject but was still killed after his parachute failed to fully deploy.&lt;ref name="ejection-history.org.uk 1995"&gt;{{cite web |title=2005 |website=ejection-history.org.uk |date=1995-01-13 |url=http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/project/year_pages/1995.htm |access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Su-25 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Evgeny Derkulsky was damaged but was able to return to base.
* On 5 May 1995, a Su-25 piloted by Colonel Vladimir Sarabeyev from the [[4th Air and Air Defence Forces Army|4th Air Army]] was hit by 12.7mm [[DShK]] fire while flying a low altitude patrol near the village of Serzhen-Yurt. The bullets pierced the unarmored side canopy glass of the cockpit, killing the pilot and causing the plane to crash. Chechen rebels managed to recover maps and charts from the wreckage.&lt;ref name="Billingsley2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dodge Billingsley|title=Fangs of the Lone Wolf: Chechen Tactics in the Russian-Chechen War 1994–2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3pS0DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10|date=19 October 2013|publisher=Helion|isbn=978-1-911096-76-4|pages=10–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Daily Report: Central Eurasia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r-AVAQAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=The Service|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 4 April 1996, a Su-25 piloted by Major Alexander Matvienko flying a reconnaissance mission near Goiskoye was shot down with a Stinger missile forcing the pilot to eject. The pilot was successfully rescued by helicopter.&lt;ref name="ejection-history.org.uk 19962"&gt;{{cite web |title=1996 |website=ejection-history.org.uk |date=1996-01-08 |url=http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/project/year_pages/1996.htm |access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 5 May 1996, a Su-25UB crewed by Colonel Igor Sviryidov and Major Oleg Isayev was shot down by a [[9K34 Strela-3]] shoulder-launched surface to air missile while flying near Serzhen-Yurt, killing both pilots.&lt;ref name="www.skywar.ru"&gt;{{cite web |title=Chechenya – Air force in local wars |website=www.skywar.ru |url=http://skywar.ru/chechenyaen.html |language=ru |access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the initial push into Chechnya, Russian Su-25 and [[Su-24]] strike aircraft destroyed the majority of the dilapidated Chechen air fleet on the ground in a matter of hours. In 1995, facilitated by clear weather, air cover provided by Su-25s allowed Russian troops to push across the [[Argun River (Caucasus)|Argun River]] and into the towns of [[Gudermes]] and [[Shali, Chechen Republic|Shali]], setting the stage for a decisive victory over separatist forces in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Russian Airpower in the Second Chechen War pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Chechen separatist leader [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]] was killed on 21 April 1996, after a Su-25 fired two laser-guided missiles at his position, after an [[Beriev A-50|A-50]] aircraft pinpointed his [[satellite phone]] signal and relayed the location to the Su-25.&lt;ref name="Madsen2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wayne Madsen|title=National Security Agency Surveillance: Reflections and Revelations 2001–2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWGiBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74|year=2013|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-304-27213-3|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; A picture purportedly from the warhead as it approached Dudayev later surfaced in ''[[Argumenty i Fakty]]'', a Russian newspaper.

In 1999, Russian Su-25s once again saw heavy use in Chechnya with the onset of the Second Chechen War in 1999. During the war, the Su-25 was again primarily a close air support platform, providing support for ground troops at low altitude in conjunction with [[Mi-24 Hind]] and [[Ka-50]] helicopters while [[Su-24]]s flew higher altitude precision strikes.&lt;ref name="LaiKamphausen2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Lai|author2=Roy Kamphausen|title=Chinese Lessons from Other Peoples' Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y_eSUYTbBiAC|year=2011|publisher=Strategic Studies Institute, U.S. Army War College|isbn=978-1-58487-511-6|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Su-25s would often fly at altitudes between 16,000 and 20,000 feet before visually acquiring and attacking their targets at lower altitudes, typically utilizing unguided rockets and bombs. For more accurate strikes, Su-25s used [[Kh-25]]ML and [[Kh-29]] laser-guided missiles. In a newer tactic not utilized during the First Chechen War, Su-25s engaged in "free hunt" operations, flying ahead of larger Russian formations in visual search of targets of opportunity. On occasion, these flights would be accompanied by reconnaissance Su-24s to increase the probability of locating mobile targets.&lt;ref&gt;Russian Airpower in the Second Chechen War pg. 32–34&lt;/ref&gt;

A new all-weather with night capability variant, the Su-25T, was introduced into combat during this conflict with notable successes with six of the aircraft flying a total of 20 sorties throughout the fighting. The 'T' model had improved sighting and was modified to include the new [[S-13 rocket|B-13]] rocket pod.&lt;ref name="Mladenova2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Mladenov|title=Sukhoi Su-25 Frogfoot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mbCdCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35|date=20 September 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4728-0478-5|pages=35–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six Su-25 aircraft were lost during the Second Chechen War.
* On 3 October 1999, a Su-25 flying a reconnaissance mission over the village of Tolstoy-Yurt was hit by a missile and shot down, killing the pilot.
* On 9 September 1999, a Su-25 from the 960th Air Assault Regiment was struck in the fuel line by ground fire, possibly by a shoulder-launced surface-to-air missile causing the pilot to eject and crash.
* On 13 December 1999, the rocket pod of a Su-25 piloted by Colonel Sergey Borisyuk malfunction resulting in a fire that caused the pilot to eject. Col. Borisyuk was rescued on the ground.
* On 22 January 2000, a Su-25 was hit by a [[MANPAD]], resulting in the loss of the left-engine. The pilot was able to land the aircraft safely however the aircraft was written off.
* On 14 June 2001, a pair of Su-25s piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Yuriy Yakimenko and Captain Oleg Podsitkov crashed into mountainous terrain, killing both pilots.
* On 29 April 2002, a Su-25 piloted by Major Igor Bezryadin crashed after entering an unrecoverable nosedive.&lt;ref&gt;https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/attach/178/178771_mdb_2_2010_adv.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Macedonian insurgency ===
[[File:Su-25UB Macedonia (20897568328).jpg|thumb|left| Su-25UB that was used by the Macedonian Air Force]]
In June 2001, the government of [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] procured four Su-25 aircraft (three single seat, one two-seater) from [[Ukraine]] which promptly entered service in the [[Macedonian Air Force]]. In the first aerial combat action of the Macedonian military, they were used to combat ethnic Albanian [[2001 insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia|insurgents in Macedonia]]. Mostly flown from an air force base near [[Petrovec, Republic of Macedonia|Petrovec]], these aircraft were piloted by Ukrainian mercenaries as Macedonia did not have any pilots trained in flying the aircraft. They saw heavy use in ground attack missions against insurgents.&lt;ref name="Washington Post 2001"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ethnic Albanian Rebels Wary About Macedonia Peace Deal |website=Washington Post |date=2001-08-10 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/08/10/ethnic-albanian-rebels-wary-about-macedonia-peace-deal/8d3f448f-2319-4876-83d7-1efef3b80fa8/ |access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Battle of Raduša in August 2001, the Su-25s supported beleaguered security forces in the town alongside Mi-24 helicopters.&lt;ref name="The Associated Press 2001"&gt;{{cite web |author=The Associated Press |title=On Eve of Peace Deal, Fighting in Macedonia Continues |website=The New York Times |date=2001-08-12 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/12/international/europe/on-eve-of-peace-deal-fighting-in-macedonia-continues.html |access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Phillips|title=Macedonia: Warlords and Rebels in the Balkans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SB1OrH8iZtcC&amp;pg=PA143|year=2004|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-841-0|pages=143–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ivorian Civil War ===
Four Su-25 aircraft (two one seaters, and two two-seaters) were procured from [[Belarus]] by the [[Ivory Coast]] in 2004. After the outbreak of the [[First Ivorian Civil War]], the government of [[Laurent Gbagbo]] used his air force to bomb rebel forces. On 6 November 2004, a pair of Su-25 aircraft based out of [[Abidjan]] and piloted by mixed crews of Ivorians and Belorussians bombed a French encampment near the city of [[Bouaké]], killing nine French [[Opération Licorne|Licorne]] peacekeepers and an American aid worker, and destroying several vehicles. The attack triggered the French to destroy the Ivorian air force, firing [[MILAN]] missiles at the two Su-25s that had attacked the French troops shortly after they landed, damaging them, and seizing the other two and disabling them.&lt;ref name="Mladenov Ugolini Hector 2015 p. 143"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mladenov |first=A. |last2=Ugolini |first2=R. |last3=Hector |first3=G. |title=Su-25 'Frogfoot' Units In Combat |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |series=Combat Aircraft |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-4728-0569-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Y2HCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT143 |access-date=2018-03-14 |page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC NEWS 2004"&gt;{{cite web |title=France attacks Ivorian airbase |website=BBC NEWS |date=2004-11-06 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3988769.stm |access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language=fr|title= Soldats tués à Bouaké : la France a laissé faire |work=[[Libération]]|date= 3 July 2006|first= Thomas|last= Hofnung |url=http://www.liberation.fr/evenement/2006/07/03/soldats-tues-a-bouake-la-france-a-laisse-faire_44887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russo-Georgia War ===
The Su-25 was once again pressed into service in the skies of Georgia during the [[Russo-Georgian War]] in 2008, seeing extensive use by both the Russian and Georgian air forces. At the beginning of the war, Georgia had a fleet of twelve Su-25 aircraft (two of them trainers) at its disposal. The aircraft saw particularly heavy use in fighting around [[Tskhinvali]], the South Ossetian capital. Out of six Russian aircraft lost in the war, three were Su-25s. All were most likely lost to friendly fire.&lt;ref name="Editorial 2009"&gt;{{cite web |last=Editorial |first=Reuters |title=Friendly fire downed Russia jets in Georgia-report |website=U.S. |date=2009-07-08 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8262192 |access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Russian air loss of the campaign was a Su-25 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Oleg Terebunsky of the 368th Attack Aviation Regiment, shot down over the territory of South Ossetia near the Zarsk pass, between [[Java (town)|Dzhava]] and [[Tskhinvali]]. He was hit by a [[MANPAD]] missile fired by South Ossetian militia around 6.00 p.m. on 8 August, in a case of friendly fire. Earlier in the day, a flight of four Georgian Su-25 planes had attacked a Russian army convoy in the same area. This was one of the few missions conducted by Georgia's Su-25s during the brief conflict as Tblisi reasoned that its aircraft would soon become easy targets for Russian interceptors. The aircraft returned to their bases and were hidden under camouflage netting to prevent them from being located.

At 10:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 9 August, a Su-25 piloted by Colonel Sergey Kobylash, commander of the 368th Attack Aviation Regiment, was shot down during an attack on a Georgian military formation south of Tskhinvali, on the Gori-Tskhinvali road. After making his initial approach, Kolybash's aircraft was struck by a missile that impacted his left engine, rendering it inoperable.  Not long after, as Kobylash was returning to base at an altitude of 1,000 meters, a MANPAD missile struck his right engine, leaving the plane without thrust. Kobylash ejected north of Tskhinvali in a South Ossetian village of the Georgian enclave of in the Great Liakh gorge, where he was recovered by a Russian combat search and rescue team. Shortly after Kobylash was rescued, South Ossetian militants made the claim they had downed a Georgian Su-25 however this possibility was rejected as Georgia's air force had ceased air operations the day before, more than likely making the shootdown of the Su-25 another incident of friendly fire.

At 1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 9 August, another Su-25 from the 368th Attack Aviation Regiment, piloted by Major Vladimir Edamenko, was struck by fire from a Russian [[ZSU-23-4]] Shilka anti-aircraft gun near [[Java (town)|Dzhava]] killing the pilot. Two hours later, a Su-25 mistakenly attacked a Russian military convoy near Liakhva, destroying a fuel tanker and injuring several troops. The Russian soldiers returned fire with a MANPAD damaging the Su-25.

Russian Su-25s also hit numerous targets deep inside Georgian territory including the Marneuli air base, however none of Georgia's Su-25 aircraft were lost. In Tskhinvali, Russian Su-25s attacked Georgian infantrymen as they rested in the outskirts of the city. The strikes killed 20 Georgian troops and injured countless more, causing the entire battalion to abandon their equipment and flee sparking rumors about the battalion's annihilation which played a hand in the Georgian withdrawal from the city. The [[Tbilisi Aircraft Manufacturing]], a factory that produces Su-25s, was also bombed damaging a runway but otherwise causing no casualties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cast.ru/files/The_Tanks_of_August_sm_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jamestown"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Russia-Georgia Conflict as Analyzed by the Center of Analysis of Strategies and Technologies in Moscow |publisher=Jamestown Foundation |url=https://jamestown.org/program/the-russia-georgia-conflict-as-analyzed-by-the-center-of-analysis-of-strategies-and-technologies-in-moscow/ |access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 8 August, a Georgian Su-25 was shot down by a Russian Su-27. The pilot managed to eject but was reportedly executed by fighters on the ground.

In 2016, Alexander Galkin, the Russia’s [[Southern Military District]] commander, said Su-25s had flown more than 1,600 sorties and dropped around 6,000 bombs since the beginning of Russia's intervention in September 2015.&lt;ref name="Busy Su-25s"&gt;{{cite web |title=Russian Air Force Su-25 Frogfoot attack aircraft dropped 6,000 (mostly unguided) bombs over Syria |website=The Aviationist |date=2016-03-19 |url=https://theaviationist.com/2016/03/19/russian-air-force-su-25-frogfoot-attack-aircraft-dropped-6000-mostly-unguided-bombs-over-syria/ |access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, the [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Defence]] released a video showing two Su-25s helping to rescue  Russian troops encircled by [[Tahrir al-Sham]] militants.&lt;ref name="War on the Rocks 2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=Not-So-Soft Power: Russia’s Military Police in Syria |website=War on the Rocks |date=2017-10-02 |url=https://warontherocks.com/2017/10/not-so-soft-power-russias-military-police-in-syria/ |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, a pair of Su-25s flying near [[Mayadin]], in eastern Syria, was suddenly intercepted by a U.S. F-22 jet which abruptly entered the flight path of the two Russian warplanes and deployed [[Flare (countermeasure)|flares]] and [[Chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]] in an attempt to cause the Su-25s to change their heading. The United States claimed the incident was not a provocation but a response to the Russian jets crossing the [[Euphrates River]] deconfliction{{what|date=August 2018}} line and not responding to radio calls.&lt;ref name="Trevithick 2017"&gt;{{cite web |last=Trevithick |first=Joseph |title=Russian Su-25 Almost Hits US F-22 During Intercept Over Syria, But Is There More Going On? |website=The Drive |date=2017-12-15 |url=http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/17000/russian-su-25-almost-hits-us-f-22-during-intercept-over-syria-but-is-there-more-going-on |access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 February 2018, a Russian Su-25 piloted by Major [[Roman Filipov]] flying over [[Idlib Governorate]] was hit by a surface-to-air missile, downing the aircraft and forcing the pilot to eject. Filipov committed suicide to avoid capture on the ground.

=== Ukrainian crisis ===
[[File:Ukrainian Air Force Su-25UB with two MiG-29s (9-13) in background.jpg|thumb|left|Su-25UB of the Ukrainian Air Force]]
The [[Ukrainian Air Force]] has made use of its fleet of Su-25 warplanes in the [[War in Donbass]], using them for strike missions against pro-Russian separatists, and at times Russian government forces. During the [[First Battle of Donetsk Airport]], Su-25s were witnessed partaking in ground attack missions, at times firing unguided rockets at separatist positions.&lt;ref name="Su-25s Donetsk Airport"&gt;{{cite web |title=Impressive Videos of the Ukrainian Air Strikes on Donetsk |website=The Aviationist |date=2014-05-27 |url=https://theaviationist.com/2014/05/27/ukrainian-offensive-donetsk/ |access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During fighting at [[Kramatorsk Airport]], Su-25s were used to deliver supplies to besieged Ukrainian troops, flying at a low altitude and parachuting provisions.&lt;ref name="Mladenov Ugolini Hector 2015 p. 153"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mladenov |first=A. |last2=Ugolini |first2=R. |last3=Hector |first3=G. |title=Su-25 'Frogfoot' Units In Combat |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |series=Combat Aircraft |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-4728-0569-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Y2HCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT153 |access-date=2018-03-14 |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rocket and strafing attack on a regional administration building in [[Luhansk]] was purportedly carried out by a Ukrainian Su-25 aircraft.&lt;ref name="Armament Research Services 2014"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ukrainian Air Force strike Lugansk with S-8KOM rockets – Armament Research Services |website=Armament Research Services |date=2014-06-03 |url=http://armamentresearch.com/ukrainian-air-force-strike-lugansk-with-s-8kom-rockets/ |access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Battle of Debaltseve]] in 2015, Russian Air Force Su-25s participated in the route of Ukrainian troops and the subsequent capture of the city.&lt;ref name="Русская весна 2015"&gt;{{cite web |title=МОЛНИЯ: Ополчение применило авиацию под Дебальцево - 2 штурмовика СУ-25 нанесли удар по позициям 40-го батальона, - источник |website=Русская весна |date=2015-02-09 |url=http://rusvesna.su/news/1423482673 |language=ru |access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the shootdown of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] in 2014, the Russian military cited the appearance of a Ukrainian Su-25 on its radar in the vicinity of the airliner as evidence that the Ukrainian military were the culprits behind the shootdown.&lt;ref name="Rudin 2016"&gt;{{cite web |last=Rudin |first=Mike |title=Conspiracy Files: Who shot down MH17? |website=BBC News |date=2016-04-25 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35706048 |access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four Ukrainian Su-25 aircraft have been lost in combat during the conflict. On 16 July 2014, a Ukrainian Su-25 was struck by a missile and downed over eastern Ukraine. The pilot was able to eject and survived. The Ukrainian government placed the blame for the shootdown on a Russian Su-27 fighter jet.&lt;ref name="Korrespondent.net"&gt;{{cite web |author=Korrespondent.net |title=Российский самолет сбил ракетой украинский Су-25 – СНБО |website=Korrespondent.net |url=https://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/3393663-rossyiskyi-samolet-sbyl-raketoi-ukraynskyi-su-25-snbo |language=ru |access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 July 2014, a pair of Su-25 jets flying near separatist-held [[Savur-Mohyla]] were shot down while flying at an altitude of 17,000 feet (5,200 meters). Both pilots were able to eject. The Ukrainian military said the aircraft had been downed by a long-range missile system, possibly fired from Russia.&lt;ref name="USA TODAY 2014"&gt;{{cite web |title=2 Ukrainian jet fighters shot down in rebel-held area |website=USA Today |date=2014-07-23 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/07/23/ukraine-rebels-separatists-fighter-jet-shot-down/13034005/ |access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 August 2014, a Su-25 flying near Luhansk was shot down by a surface-to-air missile. The pilot ejected and was recovered by Ukrainian troops.&lt;ref name="ЛIГА.Новости 2014"&gt;{{cite web |title=В Донбассе из российского ЗРК сбили украинский самолет Су-25 |website=ЛIГА.Новости |date=2014-08-29 |url=http://news.liga.net/news/politics/3106003-v_donbasse_iz_rossiyskogo_zrk_sbili_ukrainskiy_samolet_su_25.htm |language=ru |access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iraqi Civil War (2014–present) ===
In late June 2014, twelve Su-25 planes arrived in [[Iraq]] aboard cargo planes after being purchased second-hand from Russia, entering combat service shortly later in the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–present)|war against the Islamic State]], despite having few munitions in its stockpile compatible with the type. The delivery was accompanied by technicians in order to train the Iraqis in the plane's operation and maintenance. The purchase was made after several delays complicated Baghdad's purchase of U.S. [[F-16]] fighters.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera 2014"&gt;{{cite web |title=Iraq takes delivery of Russian fighter jets |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=2014-06-29 |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/06/iraq-takes-delivery-russian-fighter-jets-201462944837214478.html |access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nordland 2014"&gt;{{cite web |last=Nordland |first=Rod |title=Russian Jets and Experts Sent to Iraq to Aid Army |website=The New York Times |date=2014-06-28 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/world/middleeast/iraq.html |access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven more Su-25s from [[Iran]] arrived in Iraq before the end of June as well. These aircraft were formerly Iraqi Air Force jets that had fled to Iran during the 1990–1991 Gulf War.

'''Philips Hue''' is a line of color changing [[LED lamps]] and white bulbs which can be controlled wirelessly. It was introduced in October 2012 and was updated in 2015 and 2016. The lamps are currently created and manufactured by Signify N.V., formerly the Philips Lighting division of [[Philips|Royal Philips N.V.]].&lt;ref name ="Signify maker of Hue"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theandroidsoul.com/signify-new-name-philips-lighting/|title=Signify is the new company name of Philips Lighting, the maker of Hue smart bulbs|date=2018-04-13|work=TAS|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Signify releases Hue Sync"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ledsmagazine.com/articles/2018/06/signify-releases-hue-sync-hoping-to-launch-the-era-of-immersive-home-entertainment-lighting.html/|title=Signify releases Hue Sync, hoping to launch the era of immersive home entertainment lighting|date=2018-06-04|work=LEDs Magazine|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Concept and design==
The Hue system was released in October 2012 as an [[Apple Store]] exclusive.&lt;ref name="ABCLaunch"&gt;{{cite news|last1=News|first1=ABC|title=Philips Hue: The Light Bulb You Can Control With Your Phone|url=http://abcnews.go.com/technology/t/blogEntry?id=17585799|accessdate=26 January 2018|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hue system was marketed as the first iOS controlled lighting appliance.&lt;ref name="ForbesLaunch"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Porges|first1=Seth|title=The Best Product of 2012: The Philips Hue LED Lighting System|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sethporges/2012/12/28/the-best-product-of-2012-the-philips-hue-led-lighting-system/#33b2df965dda|accessdate=11 November 2016|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It uses the [[ZigBee|Zigbee lighting protocol]] to communicate, and can be controlled via smartphone apps over cellular network, Ethernet or [[Wi-Fi]] via a Zigbee–Ethernet bridge wired to a router.&lt;ref name="ABCLaunch" /&gt;  The initial system had bulbs capable of producing up to 600 [[lumen (unit)|lumens]] while the newer systems have bulbs that shine up to 800 lumens. The newer system also features [[HomeKit]] compatibility.&lt;ref name="CNet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Philips Hue 2.0 Starter Kit review: A new Hue, with Siri, too|url=https://www.cnet.com/products/philips-hue-white-and-color-ambience-starter-kit-a19/|website=CNET|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, an outdoor version of the Philips Hue suite was introduced, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/philips-hue-outdoor-iot/|title=Philips Hue outdoor connected lighting hits US, Europe this July|last=Smith|first=Jake|date=12 March 2018|work=[[ZDNet]]|access-date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in October 2018 a suite of entertainment-focused, free-standing light fittings.&lt;ref name="Smartdigs"&gt;{{cite web|title=What Philips Hue can actually do|url=https://www.smartdigs.co.uk/know/philips-hue-lighting|website=Smartdigs|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security concerns==
Security issues have been noted in the product including an issue in which the bulbs were able to be remotely controlled over the Internet by attackers with inexpensive equipment.  In another proof-of-concept, researchers were able to remotely control light bulbs using a drone flying outside a window.&lt;ref name="CNetSecurity"&gt;{{cite web|title=New study details a security flaw with Philips Hue smart bulbs|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/new-study-details-a-security-flaw-with-philips-hue-smart-bulbs/|website=CNET|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In an article in Forbes, Sath Porges called Phillips Hue the "best product of 2012".&lt;ref name="ForbesLaunch" /&gt;  PC Magazine reviewed the white variation and named it as an editors' choice and said it was bright and affordable and had lots of features.&lt;ref name="PCMagReview"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Torres|first1=Timothy|title=Philips Hue White|url=https://www.pcmag.com/review/344603/philips-hue-white|website=PCMAG|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, it was primarily intended a substitution for conventional, face-to-face therapy in which a client or patient is required to visit a psychotherapists office. Increasingly, however, academics are studying the use of electronic media in treatment to explore the possibility of providing novel and potentially more effective therapies.

After reviewing thirteen relevant studies, the authors of a meta-analytic review of psychotherapy mediated by remote communications technology concluded that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Remote therapy has the potential to overcome some of the barriers to conventional psychological therapy services. Telephone-based interventions are a particularly popular research focus and as a means of therapeutic communication may confer specific advantages in terms of their widespread availability and ease of operation. However, the available evidence is limited in quantity and quality. More rigorous trials are required to confirm these preliminary estimates of effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Biomed Central"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1471-244X-8-60 |title=Psychotherapy mediated by remote communication technologies: A meta-analytic review |year=2008 |last1=Bee |first1=Penny E |last2=Bower |first2=Peter |last3=Lovell |first3=Karina |last4=Gilbody |first4=Simon |last5=Richards |first5=David |last6=Gask |first6=Linda |last7=Roach |first7=Pamela |journal=BMC Psychiatry |volume=8 |pages=60 |pmid=18647396 |pmc=2496903}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Examples ==
Despite the absence of complete study, remote therapy has enjoyed growing popularity as a replacement for traditional therapy and innovative practice made possible by electronic medium. Examples include:
*The US Army has initiated a program in which soldiers in combat participate in video-based [[Couples counseling|relationship counseling]]  with their partners at home.&lt;ref name="Adam Shaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/-news/2009/06/15/22707-q-west-chaplains-introduce-video-teleconference-counseling-for-couples/|title=Q-West Chaplains Introduce Video Teleconference Counseling for Couples|publisher=WWW.ARMY.MIL (The Official Homepage of The United States Army)|accessdate=June 15, 2009|author=Sgt. 1st Class Adam Shaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*AbleTo &lt;ref name="AbleTo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ableto.com|title=AbleTo's offerings}}&lt;/ref&gt;  uses remote therapy to extend the reach of [[Empirically supported therapies|evidence-based practice]] and introduce innovative new practices, e.g., the team-based applications of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]]  utilizing a licensed therapist and behavioral coach.
*Mayo Clinic, provides remote cognitive rehabilitation sessions to patients who have had an acquired brain injury. Using an Internet-based, secure instant messaging platform, an office-based therapist conducts the rehabilitation session with the patient, who remains in or near his or her home.&lt;ref name="Mayo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/home-internet-enabled-therapy-sessions-enhance-access-cognitive-rehabilitation-traumatic|title=At-Home, Internet-Enabled Therapy Sessions Enhance Access to Cognitive Rehabilitation for Traumatic Brain Injury Patients, Leading to High Levels of Patient and Therapist Satisfaction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robotino''' is a [[mobile robot|mobile robot system]] made by ''[[Festo]] Didactic'', and used for educational, training and research purposes.

==Operation==
Robotino is based on an omnidirectional drive assembly, which enables the system to roam freely. The robot is controlled by an industry-standard PC system, which is powerful enough to plan routes for fully autonomous driving. Via a WLAN-Link, Robotino can send all sensor readings to an external PC. In the other direction, control commands can be issued by the external PC. This way, control programs can run on the external PC or on Robotino directly. Mixed mode or shared control are also possible.
 
For users with little prior robotics knowledge, Robotino can be readily programmed in its “native” programming environment RobotinoView II. More experienced programmers may find it useful that the robot can also be programmed in [[C_(programming_language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java_programming|Java]], [[.NET Framework|.NET]], [[Matlab]], [[Simulink]], [[Labview]] and [[Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio]].

==Hardware==
The omnidirectional drive consists of three [[Mecanum wheel]]s, all of which are individually controllable. These wheels are arranged at angles of 120°. Robotino has a bumper sensor around its circumference, infrared distance sensors, a color camera with VGA resolution, [[rotary encoder|optical wheel encoders]], power measurement for the entire system and the various motors, as well as a battery voltage monitor. Moreover, as optional additional sensors, Robotino can be equipped with a precise laser scanner, a gyroscope, and an [[indoor positioning system]] (created by [[Evolution Robotics]]). For signal input and output Robotino has several interfaces:
* USB 
* Ethernet 
* 8 digital and 8 analog inputs 
* 8 digital outputs 
* additional motor output for driving high loads
* additional encoder input

Power is supplied by two 12V/5Ah lead-acid batteries or optionally by two 12V/9Ah NiMH batteries.

{{Economic sectors}}

The '''secondary sector of the economy''' includes [[Industry|industries]] that produce a finished, usable [[production (economics)|product]] or are involved in [[construction]].

This sector generally takes the output of the [[Primary sector of the economy|primary sector]] and manufactures finished [[good (economics)|good]]s or where they are suitable for use by other businesses, for [[export]], or [[sales|sale]] to domestic consumers. This sector is often divided into [[light industry]] and [[heavy industry]]. Many of these industries consume large quantities of energy and require factories and machinery to convert raw materials into goods and products. They also produce [[waste]] materials and [[waste heat]] that may cause environmental problems or cause [[pollution]]. The secondary sector supports both the primary and [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]].

Some economists contrast wealth-producing sectors in an economy such as manufacturing with the service sector which tends to be wealth-consuming.[1] Examples of service may include retail, insurance, and government. These economists contend that an economy begins to decline as its wealth-producing sector shrinks.[2] Manufacturing is an important activity to promote economic growth and development. Nations that export manufactured products tend to generate higher marginal GDP growth which supports higher incomes and marginal tax revenue needed to fund the quality of life initiatives such as health care and infrastructure in the economy. The field is an important source for engineering job opportunities. Among developed countries, it is an important source of well-paying jobs for the middle class to facilitate greater social mobility for successive generations on the economy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7877">In the field of [[physical security]], '''security lighting''' is lighting that intended to deter or detect intrusions or other criminal activity on a piece of real property. It can also be used to increase a feeling of safety. Lighting is integral to [[crime prevention through environmental design]].

== Planning considerations ==
Security lighting can be counter-productive. Turning off lights halved the number of thefts and burglary in [[Övertorneå]] Sweden. 
&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;
[http://asv.org.au/light-pollution.php "Outdoor Lighting and Crime, Part 2"]
by Barry Clark 2003, p. 18 and Figure 5
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"[[Svenska Dagbladet]]": [http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/artikel_206469.svd "Halverad brottslighet i mörk kommun"]
(''Halved crime in the dark city.'')
2007
(''The number of thefts and burglaries have halved in Övertorneå since the city was dark in the fall because of the nationwide family dispute with Ekfors Kraft. We thought it would be the opposite, says Sören Mukkavaara, police constable in Övertorneå.'')
&lt;/ref&gt;
A test in West Sussex UK showed that adding all-night lighting in some areas made people there feel safer, although crime rates increased 55% in those areas compared to control areas and to the county as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://calgary.rasc.ca/lp/crime.html "Light and Crime"]
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|In the early seventies, the public-school system in San Antonio, Texas, began leaving many of its school buildings, parking lots, and other property dark at night and found that the no-lights policy not only reduced energy costs but also dramatically cut vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;Schneier on Security [http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/09/light_and_crime.html "Light and Crime"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bright, unshielded floodlights often prevent people from noticing criminal activity, and help criminals see what they are doing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/08/20/070820fa_fact_owen?currentPage=2 "The Dark Side: Making war on light pollution"]
by David Owen 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

While adequate lighting around a physical structure is deployed to reduce the risk of an intrusion, it is critical that the lighting be designed carefully as poorly arranged lighting can create [[Light pollution#Glare|glare]] which actually obstructs vision.
Studies {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} have shown that many criminals are aware of this effect and actively exploit it.
The optimal design will also depend on whether the area will be watched directly by humans or by [[closed-circuit television]], and on the location of the observers or cameras.

Security lighting may be subject to [[vandalism]], possibly to reduce its effectiveness for a subsequent intrusion attempt. Thus security lights should either be mounted very high, or else protected by [[wire]] [[mesh]] or tough [[polycarbonate]] shields. Other lamps may be completely recessed from view and access, with the light directed out through a [[light pipe]] or reflected from a polished aluminium or stainless steel [[mirror]]. For similar reasons high security installations may provide a [[Emergency power system|stand-by power supply]] for their security lighting.

Some typical considerations include:

* Reduce and prevent glare and situations mentioned above
** Shielded or full cut-off (FCO) lamp housings which conceal the bulb could be used, which should direct light onto the ground or target and away from observers. These lights should send no light above 80 degrees from the [[nadir]]. Lighting should be bright enough, and not "as bright as possible". In many cases a good [[rule of thumb]] is 0.5 [[watt]]s per square metre (0.05 watts per square foot). This might need to be increased in very confused environments, but conversely can be reduced in very open environments. Multiple lamps of moderate power instead of a few powerful lamps will reduce glare, provide more even illumination with reduced pools of shadow, and provide some redundancy if one lamp's bulb blows out or develops a bad ballast. 
* Prevent malicious tampering or interference. This means that besides the lamp itself, the entire circuit from the source ([[Electrical power industry|electric company]] or generator), through the wires, to the lamp and back should be protected.
** Luminaires should be accessible so that the maintainer can replace blown bulbs as quickly as possible and clean the luminaires periodically. However they should be protected or somehow made inaccessible to tampering.
** Ensure the [[electric meter]] box is locked or inaccessible, or else power the lights from a different line.
** Control and power lines, where outside or vulnerable, should be either buried well underground (in [[Electrical conduit|conduit]]s preferably) or at a height of at least 8 metres (about 24 feet).
** Ideally multiple circuits should be used to prevent an accidental or malicious short or cut causing all illumination to fail.

== Use ==
[[Image:Na-light.jpg|thumb|A sodium vapor light. This type is often used as security lighting.]]
Security lighting can be used in residential, commercial, industrial, institutional, and military settings. Some examples of security lighting include [[High-intensity discharge lamp|floodlight]]s and [[sodium vapor lamp|low pressure sodium vapour light]]s. Most lights intended to be left on all night are [[high-intensity discharge lamp]]s as these have good energy efficiency, thus reducing the cost of running a lamp for such long periods.

A disadvantage of low pressure sodium lamps is that the colour is pure yellow, so the illuminated scene is seen without any colour differentiation. Consequently, high pressure sodium vapour lamps (which are still yellowish, but closer to golden white) are also used, at the cost of greater running expenses and increased light pollution. High pressure sodium lamps also take slightly longer to restrike after a power interruption.

Other lights may be activated by sensors such as [[passive infrared sensor]]s (PIRs), turning on only when a person (or other mammal) approaches. PIR activated lamps will usually be incandescent bulbs so that they can activate instantly; energy saving is less important since they will not be on all the time. PIR sensor activation can increase both the deterrent effect (since the intruder knows that he has been detected) and the detection effect (since a person will be attracted to the sudden increase in light). Some PIR units can be set up to sound a chime as well as turn on the light. Most modern units have a [[photocell]] so that they only turn on when it is dark.

== Limitations ==
An important limitation to the usefulness of security lighting is the simple fact that it is only useful at night. This is particularly significant for home owners because, contrary to a widespread myth, most household [[burglary|burglaries]] occur during the day,&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Sourcebook of criminal justice statistics Online": [http://www.albany.edu/sourcebook/pdf/t31452007.pdf "Percent distribution of burglaries known to police. By place and time of occurrence, United States, 1976-2007"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britastro.org/dark-skies/crime.html "Lighting &amp; Crime"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603171645/http://www.britastro.org/dark-skies/crime.html |date=2009-06-03 }} from the [[British Astronomical Association]]'s [[Campaign for Dark Skies]]&lt;/ref&gt; when the occupants are away at work or shopping.

As with any lighting, security lighting can reduce [[night vision]], making it harder to see into areas that are unlit or are in shadow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6088">'''Simon House''' is at 33 Daveys Bay Road, [[Mount Eliza, Victoria|Mount Eliza]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. The house was constructed in the 1960s during the period of architectural experimentation on materiality and structure in houses. Simon House was the first project received on the day when [[Guilford Marsh Bell|Guilford Bell]] and [[Neil Clerehan]] opened their office in South Yarra. The Simons were Clerehan’s partners but the house was a collaboration of partners. Therefore, the house has a mixture of both Clerehan and Bell’s typical style of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Architecture of Neil Clerehan|year=2005|publisher=RMIT University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-86459-383-X|pages=15|author=Black R&amp; Edquist H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The house is a single-storey house, planned in a rectangular shape. The house consists of five bedrooms, two toilets, two garages, one kitchen, dining room, living room, pool and terrace. The enclosed pool, natural finishes, glazed wall and an extensive view over the bay recalled contemporary Californian house of architects like [[Craig Ellwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Architecture of Neil Clerehan|year=2005|publisher=RMIT University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-86459-383-X|pages=37–41|author=Black R&amp; Edquist H}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Simon house diagram plan.jpg|thumb|design diagram]]

== Design Approach ==
The central core program of the house was a pool and terrace, positioned right in the centre of the house. With the pool and terrace in the centre with programs surrounds &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Architecture of Neil Clerehan|year=2005|publisher=RMIT University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-86459-383-X|pages=37–41|author=Black R&amp; Edquist H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
that engaged with it, allows family members to gather together. It was said that was one of Clerehan’s conception of the house where how he deal with the provision of a frame for family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/money/profile-neil-clerehan/2006/08/07/1154802816814.html?page=2 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Profile: Neil Clerehan | date=9 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pool and living room aligned on axis, forming the central part of a symmetrical square plan. Then the programs around the pool were given a corresponding position in the house’s spatial hierarchy. Because of this distinct insistence of having an equivalent position of programs, the programs are mirrored and consist of dual garages and entrances. It was said that was one of Bell’s typical style of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Architecture of Neil Clerehan|year=2005|publisher=RMIT University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-86459-383-X|pages=37–41|author=Black R&amp; Edquist H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell has been influenced by the architecture and gardens of Japan. As a countryman, he feels, when in the city, a hunger for the freedom of sky and vegetation. He thinks that a building must stand in spectacular relationship to its environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1952-1980 Architecture of Guilford Bell|year=1982|publisher=Proteus Publishing Pty. Ltd.|location=South Melbourne|isbn=0-949635-00-6|pages=7–9|author=Anne Imrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the pool and terrace positioned in the centre of the house, the engagement between the indoor and outdoor spaces then became ambiguous. It creates a sense of feeling when one is inside, it will feels like outdoors and when one is outside it will feels like indoors. One of his design principal was that he thinks of views or views from the building first, instead of the form of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1952-1980 Architecture of Guilford Bell|year=1982|publisher=Proteus Publishing Pty. Ltd.|location=South Melbourne|isbn=0-949635-00-6|pages=7–9|author=Anne Imrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, glass panels are used across the living and dining areas to capture the view of the bay.[[File:Image of simon house.JPG|thumb|perspective view of outside terrace]]

== Current ==
Unfortunately, one of the garage have been renovated into a main entrance, also as a living room. Another garage is built right opposite the existing garage. In this approach, it loses the spatial qualities of the house but in turn allows a convenient use to the owner in the house’s circulation.
[[File:Simon house current view.JPG|thumb|current view of Simon House garage]]

== Materiality ==
The materiality that uses in the house were unadorned, they are fibrous plaster ceiling left in natural, unpainted stated, flat steel decking roof, timber walls, and reinforced concrete floor slab under concrete block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Architecture of Neil Clerehan|year=2005|publisher=RMIT University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-86459-383-X|pages=37–41|author=Black R&amp; Edquist H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
Neil Clerehan and Guilford Bell has received numerous honours for his architectural works while they were practicing architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.tce.rmit.edu.au/E03159/ModMelb/mm2/modmelbprac2/nc/ncbio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001042824/http://users.tce.rmit.edu.au/e03159/ModMelb/mm2/modmelbprac2/nc/ncbio.html |archivedate=2009-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Simon House was the most prominent work of Bell Clerehan partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Architecture of Neil Clerehan|year=2005|publisher=RMIT University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-86459-383-X|pages=37–41|author=Black R&amp; Edquist H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The home beautiful considered the pool, terrace to be one of Australia’s outstanding outdoor areas. The Simon house won the Victorian Architecture Medal in 1963-1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.tce.rmit.edu.au/E03159/ModMelb/mm2/modmelbprac2/nc/ncbio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001042824/http://users.tce.rmit.edu.au/e03159/ModMelb/mm2/modmelbprac2/nc/ncbio.html |archivedate=2009-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slicer first divides the object as a stack of flat layers, followed by describe these layers as linear movements of the 3D printer extruder, fixation laser or equivalent. All these movements, together with some specific printer commands like the ones to control the extruder temperature or bed temperature, are finally written in the g-code file, that can after be transferred to the printer. 

== Additional features of the slicer ==

Near all slicers have some additional features, like:

[[File:Infill density.jpg|left|thumb|Different densities of infill (in yellow), as generated by [https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-cura-software Cura] slicer, from solid to hollow.]]
*'''Infill''': solid objects needs a big amount of valuable material (filament, ...) and print time. The slicer can automatically convert solid volumes to hollow ones, saving costs and time. The hollow object can be partially filled by internal structures, as internals walls, to provide additional robustness. The amount of these structures is called '''infill density''', being this parameter one of the adjustments to be provided to the slicer.

[[File:Support structure in 3D printing.jpg|thumb|Support structure (in blue) generated by [https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-cura-software Cura] software. ]]
*'''Supports''': most of the 3D printing processes create the object layer by layer, down to up, with the layer under construction being deposited over the previous one. As consequence, all object parts must relay, at least in some part, over another one. In the case of an object layer that is floating (by example, the flat roof of a house or an horizontally extended arm in a figure), the slicer automatically can add '''supports''' for it. The support touch the object in a way that is easily detachable from it at the finish stage of the object production.

[[File:Skirts, Brims, Rafts.jpg|thumb|Comparative of base layers (in blue): a) skirt; b) brim; c) raft, generated by [https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-cura-software Cura] software]]
* '''Rafts''', '''skirts''' and '''brims''': printing of the first object layer, the one in contact with the printer bed, has some peculiarities, like problems of object adherence to the bed, rugosity, smooth deposition of the first amounts of filament, ... &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/65/when-should-i-use-a-raft-when-should-i-use-a-brim|title=When should I use a raft, when should I use a brim?|website=3D Printing Stack Exchange|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; . The slicer can automatically add some detachable structures to minimize these problems. Usual types of these base structures are &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplify3d.com/support/articles/rafts-skirts-and-brims/|title=Rafts, Skirts and Brims!|website=www.simplify3d.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  a '''skirt''' (a single band around the base of the object without touching it), a '''brim''' (several lines of filament around the base of the object, each one a few more far from it until touch it, but not under it) and '''rafts''' (several layers of material that forms a detachable base, being the object printed over it).

'''SPARX'''&lt;ref name="Sparx Video Game"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sparx Video Game|url=https://www.sparx.org.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Smart, Positive, Active, Realistic, X-factor thoughts) is a free online [[computer program]] for New Zealand residents only, intended to help young persons with mild to moderate [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Stress (biology)|stress]] or [[anxiety]]. Through the game, this e-therapy will teach them how to resolve their issues on their own, according to a talking psychotherapeutic approach called [[cognitive behavioural therapy]].
Before taking part in this game, a personality test is required to determine if SPARX will be suited and helpful for the future user.

== Game scenario ==

Based in a 3D fantasy world, the game leads players through seven realms (each lasting between 30 and 40 minutes). In the beginning of SPARX, the user meets the Guide who explains what SPARX is and how it could help. Then the user customizes an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] and starts to journey within the seven provinces in order to complete different quests. In the first level, gamers challenge GNATS (Gloomy Negative Automatic Thoughts). These GNATS fly towards the avatar and say negative things like, for example: "you're a loser". Further in the game, the user meets different characters, solves puzzles and completes mini games. As soon as a quest is completed, the Guide explains how to use new skills in order to feel better, solve problems and enjoy real life. Players complete one or two levels in the game each week, during three to seven weeks.

== Background and history ==

Up to a quarter of young people will have experienced a depressive disorder by the age of 19. This is a major cause of [[disability]]. Youth depression can affect every aspect of a teen's life and lead to the use of drugs, an abuse of alcohol and, in certain extreme cases, to suicide. ''Sparx'' is designed to help adolescents reduce their depression symptoms.
Between 2009 and 2010, the Sparx team conducted an evaluation (a randomised controlled trial) of SPARX with 187 young people in order to see if it was effective in treating the symptoms of depression. They compared SPARX to standard care provided to young people with mild to moderate depression (e.g. a face-to-face therapy with a counsellor or a [[clinical psychologist]]).
170 adolescents were assessed after intervention and 168 were assessed at the three-month follow-up point. Per protocol analyses showed that SPARX was not inferior to the most commonly used treatment.&lt;ref name="The effectiveness of SPARX"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merry|first=Sally |author2=Karolina Stasiak |author3=Matthew Shepherd |author4=Chris Frampton |author5=Theresa Fleming |author6=Mathijs F G Lucassen |title=The effectiveness of SPARX, a computerised self help intervention for adolescents seeking help for depression: randomised controlled non-inferiority trial|journal=British Medical Journal|date=9 March 2012|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e2598|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence of effectiveness ==

In 2012, a group of researchers led by Dr Theresa Fleming,&lt;ref name="Therry Fleming"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Theresa (Terry)|url=http://www.fmhs.auckland.ac.nz/faculty/staffct/staff_details.aspx?staffID=74666C65303032|work=SPARX youth e-therapy|accessdate=25 November 2013|title= Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is working in the department of Child and Youth Health and Psychological Medicine, decided to test the game. They recruited 187 teens with mild to moderate depression and assigned them to one of two groups: the first group played the video game and the other group received typical treatment from trained counselors at schools and youth clinics. More than 60 percent of the participants were girls with an average age of 16.
In both groups, levels of anxiety and depression were reduced by about one-third of them. The video game, however, helped more kids between 12 and 19 years old to recover from their depression. About 43.7 percent achieved remission in the SPARX group, compared to the 26.4 percent in usual care.&lt;ref name="The effectiveness of SPARX"/&gt;

== Development ==

Behind the SPARX project is a team of researchers and clinicians from [[The University of Auckland]].
Pr Sally Merry, Dr Karolina Stasiak,&lt;ref name="Dr Karolina Stasiak"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stasiak|first=Karolina|title= Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences|url=http://www.fmhs.auckland.ac.nz/som/staffct/staff_details.aspx?staffID=6B737461303031|work=Youth E-Therapy Project|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Theresa Fleming, Dr Matt Shepherd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shepherd|first=Matt|title= Staff and Doctoral Candidates|url=http://www.education.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/matt-shepherd|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dr Mathijs Lucassen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lucassen|first=Mathijs|title= Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences|url=https://www.fmhs.auckland.ac.nz/som/staffct/staff_details.aspx?staffID=6D6C7563303037|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; created it.
Associate Professor Sally Merry is a child and adolescent Psychiatrist, Head of Department of Psychological Medicine and Director of The Werry Centre for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.&lt;ref name="Sally N Merry"&gt;{{cite web|last=Merry|first=Sally |title=The Werry Centre of Child|url=http://www.werrycentre.org.nz/?t=20|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dr Stasiak also coordinated the main study of SPARX.
Drs Fleming, Shepherd and Lucassen carried out doctoral studies of SPARX.

In 2011, SPARX won the World Summit Award,&lt;ref name="World Summit Award"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Summit Award|url=http://www.wsis-award.org/winner/sparx-76920110609|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; supervised by the [[United Nations]], in the category of e-Health and Environment which honors excellence in multimedia and e-Content creation. 
SPARX was also rewarded by the 2013 International Digital Award from [[Netexplo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Netexplo|url=http://en.www.netexplo.org/laureat/sparx|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosted by [[UNESCO]], for being the first out of ten most innovative and promising digital initiative of the year.

After a such success, in 2012 Dr Lucassen decided to develop another version of SPARX entitled Rainbow SPARX to help adolescents attracted to the same sex, or both sexes, or unsure of their sexuality. According to a small study carried out by Mathijs Lucassen, himself, more than 80% of the participants said that the game helped them to deal with their sexuality and would recommend it to other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Susie|last=Hill|title=Computer game as counselling for depressed youth|url=http://www.spinz.org.nz/page/242-issues+august-2012+computer-game-as-good-as-counselling-for-depressed-youth|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:SolarStirlingEngine.jpg|thumb|[[Solar thermal energy#Dish designs|Dish Stirling]] from SES]]
According to their website, Stirling Energy Systems (SES) is a [[systems integration]] and [[project management]] company that is developing equipment for utility-scale renewable energy power plants and distributed electric generating systems ("gensets"). SES is teamed with [[Kockums]] Submarine Systems, [[NASA]]-[[Glenn Research Center]], the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE), and The [[Boeing Company]] for solar power plants. SES claims it is positioned to become a premier worldwide renewable energy technology company to meet the global demand for renewable electric generating technologies through the commercialization of its own [[stirling cycle engine]] technology for solar power generation applications.

==Bankruptcy==
On 29 September 2011, Stirling Energy Systems[http://www.stirlingenergysystems.com] filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy as the Stirling dish technology could not compete against the falling costs of solar photovoltaics, according to media reports. The falling photovoltaic prices were caused by Chinese subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/view/21168/stirling-energy-caves-in-against-pvs-falling-costs/ Stirling Energy caves in against PV's falling costs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/01/solyndra-bankruptcy-idUSS1E78T1TK20111001 UPDATE 3-U.S. DOJ seeks trustee in Solyndra bankruptcy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012 the Maricopa Solar plant in Phoenix, Arizona was bought by a European formation based in London called [http://www.unitedsunsystems.com United Sun Systems]

At the beginning of 2011 Stirling Energy's development arm, Tessera Solar, sold off its two large projects, the 709&amp;nbsp;MW [[Imperial Valley Solar Project]] and the 850&amp;nbsp;MW [[Calico Solar Energy Project]] to AES Solar and K.Road, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pv-tech.org/news/aes_solar_buys_tessera_solars_imperial_valley_project_with_intent_to_turn_c AES Solar buys Tessera Solar’s Imperial Valley project with intent to turn CSP into PV]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gigaom.com/cleantech/tessera-solar-sells-troubled-850mw-project-to-k-road/ Tessera Solar Sells Troubled 850mw Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tang Prize''' ({{zh|c=唐獎}}) is a set of biennial international awards bestowed in four fields: Sustainable Development, Biopharmaceutical Science, Sinology, and Rule of Law. Nomination and selection are conducted by an independent selection committee, which is formed in partial cooperation with the [[Academia Sinica]], [[Taiwan]]'s top research institution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tang-prize.org/en/choose.php |title=Tang Prize Selection Committee |access-date=2017-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911161910/http://www.tang-prize.org/en/choose.php |archive-date=2017-09-11 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
In the advent of [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] and [[globalization]], humanity has greatly enjoyed the convenience brought about by science and technology. Yet, humanity also faces a multitude of critical environmental, socio-cultural, and ethical issues on an unparalleled scale, such as [[climate change]], inequality, and moral degradation. Against this backdrop, a Taiwanese entrepreneur [[Samuel Yin]] established the Tang Prize Foundation in December 2012.

With the aim to recognize and support contributors for their revolutionary efforts in the research fields critical to the 21st century, the Tang Prize is global in reach.  Laureates are selected on the basis of the originality of their work along with their contributions to society, irrespective of gender, religion, ethnicity, or nationality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Award Categories ==
The award categories of the Tang Prize include [[sustainable development|Sustainable Development]], [[Biopharmaceutical|Biopharmaceutical Science]], [[Sinology]], and [[rule of law|Rule of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aedu/201409190025.aspx |title=Winners of Tang Prize hope it can draw young talent to science |access-date=2014-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921022847/http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aedu/201409190025.aspx |archive-date=2014-09-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prize in Sustainable Development recognizes those who have made extraordinary contributions to the sustainable development of human societies, especially through groundbreaking innovations in science and technology.

The Prize in Biopharmaceutical Science recognizes original biopharmaceutical or biomedical research that has led to significant advances towards preventing, diagnosing and/or treating major human diseases to improve human health.

The Prize in Sinology recognizes the study of Sinology in its broadest sense, awarding research on China and its related fields, such as Chinese thought, history, philology, linguistics, archaeology, philosophy, religion, traditional canons, literature, and art (excluding literary and art works). Honoring innovations in the field of Sinology, the Prize showcases Chinese culture and its contributions to the development of human civilization.

The Prize in Rule of Law recognizes individual(s) or institution(s) who have made significant contributions to the rule of law, reflected not only in the achievement of the candidate(s) in terms of the advancement of legal theory or practice, but also in the realization of the rule of law in contemporary societies through the influences or inspiration of the work of the candidate(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tang-prize.org/en/award.php|title=Tang Prize {{!}} About {{!}} Award Categories|last=Graphics|first=很好設計, Weichunglee|website=www.tang-prize.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911162237/http://www.tang-prize.org/en/award.php|archive-date=2017-09-11|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7489">'''Thermal cleaning''' is a combined process involving [[pyrolysis]] and [[Redox|oxidation]]. As an industrial application, thermal cleaning is used to remove [[Organic chemistry|organic]] substances such as [[polymer]]s, [[plastic]]s and [[coating]]s from parts, products or production components like extruder screws, [[Spinneret (polymers)|spinnerets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fiberjournal.com/back-issues/ |title=Effective Spinneret Cleaning | author=Udo Heffungs |date=June 2010 |publisher=Fiber Journal |access-date=23 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[static mixer]]s. Thermal cleaning is the most common cleaning method in industrial environment.&lt;ref name="Davis Brown 1996"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://infohouse.p2ric.org/ref/30/29295.pdf|title=Cleaning Metal Parts and Tooling |author1=Gary Davis |author2=Keith Brown |lastauthoramp=yes |date=April 1996 |website=Pollution Prevention Regional Information Center |publisher=Process Heating |access-date=23 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of different methods have been developed so far for a wide range of applications.

== Process ==
Heat is supplied for pyrolysis and air is supplied for oxidation. Depending on the procedure, pyrolysis and oxidation can be applied consecutively or simultaneously. During thermal cleaning, organic material is converted into [[volatile organic compounds]], [[hydrocarbon]]s and [[Carbonization|carbonized]] gas.&lt;ref name="Thermal Processing 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thermalprocessing.org/2014/03/14/look-thermal-cleaning-technology/ |title=A Look at Thermal Cleaning Technology | date=14 March 2014 |website=ThermalProcessing.org |publisher=Process Examiner |access-date=23 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inorganic chemistry|Inorganic]] elements remain.&lt;ref name="Davis Brown 1996" /&gt; Typical process temperatures range between 750 °F to 1000 °F (400 °C to 540 °C).&lt;ref name="Mainord1994"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://infohouse.p2ric.org/ref/02/01800.pdf |title=Cleaning with Heat: Old Technology with a Bright New Future | author=Mainord, Kenneth |date=September 1994 |website=Pollution Prevention Regional Information Center |publisher=The Magazine of Critical Cleaning Technology |access-date=23 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several types of industrial thermal cleaning systems are available:

=== Fluidized bed systems ===
Fluidized bed systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?FT=D&amp;date=19991007&amp;DB=worldwide.espacenet.com&amp;locale=de_EP&amp;CC=WO&amp;NR=9949999A1&amp;KC=A1&amp;ND=4 |title=Method for removing polymer deposits which have formed on metal or ceramic machine parts, equipment and tools |author1=Ewald Schwing |author2=Horst Uhrner |date=7 October 1999 |website=Espacenet |publisher=European Patent Office |access-date=23 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; use [[sand]] or [[aluminium oxide]] (alumina) as heating medium. They apply pyrolysis and oxidation simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=DE&amp;NR=2337894A1&amp;KC=A1&amp;FT=D |title=Cleaning objects in hot fluidised bed - with neutralization of resultant acidic gas esp. by alkaline metals cpds |author1=Herbert Kenneth Staffin |author2=Robert A. Koelzer |date=28 November 1974 |website=Espacenet |publisher=European Patent Office |access-date=23 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems clean fast, from 30 minutes process time up to two hours. The medium does not melt or boil, nor emit any vapors or odors.&lt;ref name="Mainord1994" /&gt; Thermal shock can be a problem with some parts.&lt;ref name="Davis Brown 1996" /&gt; Pollution control devices may be needed to protect the environment.&lt;ref name="Mainord1994" /&gt;

=== Vacuum ovens ===
Vacuum ovens use pyrolysis in a [[vacuum]].&lt;ref name="Thomas S. Dwan 1980"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio;jsessionid=1R87vtg4+Shk-VrpqpVUsDVb.espacenet_levelx_prod_3?locale=en_EP&amp;FT=D&amp;CC=US&amp;DB=worldwide.espacenet.com&amp;NR=4220480A&amp;date=19800902&amp;ND=4&amp;KC=A|title=Process for vacuum pyrolysis removal of polymers from various objects | author=Thomas S. Dwan |date=2 September 1980 |website=Espacenet |publisher=European Patent Office |access-date=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is very safe because uncontrolled combustion inside the cleaning chamber is avoided.&lt;ref name="Mainord1994" /&gt; The cleaning process in this relatively new approach takes 8&lt;ref name="Thermal Processing 2014" /&gt; to 30 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thermal-cleaning.com/en/schwing-thermal-cleaning-systems-accessories/vacuum-pyrolysis-systems.html |title=Vacuum pyrolysis systems |website=thermal-cleaning.com | access-date=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vacuum pyrolysis is the only method that applies pyrolysis and oxidation consecutively. In two-chamber versions, molten plastic drains into an unheated chamber to capture the bulk of the polymer to reduce the fumes.&lt;ref name="Thomas S. Dwan 1980" /&gt; Vacuum ovens are also electrically powered.&lt;ref name="Davis Brown 1996" /&gt;

=== Burn-off ovens ===
Burn-off ovens, also known as heat-cleaning ovens, are gas-fired and used for removing organics from heavy and large metal parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mntap.umn.edu/paint/resources/56-PaintStrip.htm |title=Paint Stripping: Reducing Waste and Hazardous Material |date=July 2008 |website=Minnesota Technical Assistance Program |publisher=University of Minnesota |access-date=23 December 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208103626/http://www.mntap.umn.edu/paint/resources/56-PaintStrip.htm |archivedate=8 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process time is moderate, approximately 4 hours. Fires can occur from the fumes created during cleaning.&lt;ref name="Mainord1994" /&gt; The design is simple and inexpensive. Different types are available. Modern types contain an additional afterburner that operates at a minimum of 1,500°F (816°C) and consumes any smoke created by the process.&lt;ref name="Davis Brown 1996" /&gt;

=== Molten salt baths ===
Molten salt baths belong to the oldest thermal cleaning systems. Cleaning with [[molten salt]] is fast: 15 to 30 minutes process time.&lt;ref name="Davis Brown 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mainord1994" /&gt; The process has the risk of dangerous splatters due to chemical reactivity,&lt;ref name="Mainord1994" /&gt; or other potential hazards, like explosions or toxic [[hydrogen cyanide]] gas. Another disadvantage is that parts can be warped or altered in design tolerances.&lt;ref name="Davis Brown 1996" /&gt; Molten salt baths can be environmentally unfriendly. Due to their disadvantages, they are rarely used today.

== Areas of application ==
* [[Plastics industry]]: Cleaning of production components like extruder screws, spinnerets, or static mixers, of plastic residues polymers.&lt;ref name="Mainord1994" /&gt;
* [[Remanufacturing|Remanufacturers]]: The rebuilding industry uses thermal cleaning to remove oils and greases from used parts such as engine blocks or starter housings.&lt;ref name="Mainord1994" /&gt;
* Rewinding industry: In the rewinding industry there are applications to clean motor components of resins, oils and greases.&lt;ref name="Mainord1994" /&gt;
* [[Laboratory|Industrial laboratories]]: Thermal cleaning is used to clean ceramics and glassware.
* General industrial applications: Thermal cleaning is used to remove paint, [[varnish]]es and coatings from industrial parts.&lt;ref name="Mainord1994" /&gt;

A '''waterladder pump''', '''water ladder''', '''dragon spine''', '''dragon wheel''' or '''rahad''' is a low lift pump which is composed of sprockets that move a chain with paddles over a [[Watering trough|trough]]. Water is pumped as the paddles push the water up the trough.

==Application==
The water ladder, as many low lift pumps, is commonly used for irrigation purposes and for drainage of lands. It is currently still used by farmers in south-east Asia.

==Advantages==
The water ladder was built as an alternative to the [[paddle wheel]] to get around the problem that to lift water to a greater height, a bigger wheel is needed. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ah810e/AH810E06.htm Water ladder pump]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the emergence of new pumps that operate on other principles, the water ladder remains an important tool as some of its other benefits are that they can be built and repaired easily at a very low cost. This is possible as all the components can be built from local resources, such as wood; which can be obtained and shaped into the desired form easily.

==Disadvantages==
As mentioned before, the pump only allows the lifting of water over a small height. This makes it unsuitable to water drainage or irrigation over larger height differences or many other pumping applications besides drainage and irrigation.

A '''waveguide''' is a structure that guides waves, such as [[electromagnetic wave]]s or [[sound]], with minimal loss of energy by restricting expansion to one dimension or two. There is a similar effect in water waves constrained within a canal, or guns that have barrels which restrict hot gas expansion to maximize energy transfer to their bullets.  Without the physical constraint of a waveguide, wave amplitudes decrease according to the [[inverse square law]] as they expand into three dimensional space.

There are different types of waveguides for each type of wave. The original and most common&lt;ref name="IEEEdict1997"&gt;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, “The IEEE standard dictionary of electrical and electronics terms”; 6th ed. New York, N.Y., Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, c1997. IEEE Std 100-1996. {{ISBN|1-55937-833-6}} [ed. Standards Coordinating Committee 10, Terms and Definitions; Jane Radatz, (chair)]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning is a hollow conductive metal pipe used to carry high frequency [[radio wave]]s, particularly [[microwave]]s.

The geometry of a waveguide reflects its function. Slab waveguides confine energy in one dimension, fiber or channel waveguides in two dimensions. The frequency of the transmitted wave also dictates the shape of a waveguide: an [[optical fiber]] guiding high-[[frequency]] [[light]] will not guide [[microwaves]] of a much lower frequency. 

Some naturally occurring structures can also act as waveguides. The [[SOFAR channel]] layer in the ocean can guide the sound of [[whale sound|whale song]] across enormous distances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119693602/abstract ORIENTATION BY MEANS OF LONG RANGE ACOUSTIC SIGNALING IN BALEEN WHALES], R. Payne, D. Webb, in Annals NY Acad. Sci., '''188''':110-41 (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle of operation==
[[Image:Diplexer1.jpg|thumb|Example of waveguides and a [[diplexer]] in an air traffic control radar]]

Waves propagate in all directions in open space as [[spherical wave]]s. The power of the wave falls with the distance ''R'' from the source as the square of the distance ([[inverse square law]]). A waveguide confines the wave to propagate in one dimension, so that, under ideal conditions, the wave loses no power while propagating.
Due to total [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] at the walls, waves are confined to the interior of a waveguide.

==History==
The first structure for guiding waves was proposed by [[J. J. Thomson]] in 1893, and was first experimentally tested by [[Oliver Lodge]] in 1894. The first mathematical analysis of electromagnetic waves in a metal cylinder was performed by [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;N. W. McLachlan, Theory and Applications of Mathieu Functions, p. 8 (1947) (reprinted by Dover: New York, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;
For sound waves, Lord Rayleigh published a full mathematical analysis of [[propagation mode]]s in his seminal work, “The Theory of Sound”.&lt;ref name="rayleigh"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zTYIAAAAIAAJ The Theory of Sound], by J. W. S. Rayleigh, (1894)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] researched [[millimetre wave]]lengths using waveguides, and in 1897 described to the Royal Institution in London his research carried out in Kolkata.&lt;ref name=emerson&gt;{{cite journal | last = Emerson | first = D. T. | title = The work of Jagadis Chandra Bose: 100 years of MM-wave research | journal = IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Research | volume = 45 | issue = 12 | pages = 2267–2273 | year = 1997 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=09Zsv97IH1MC&amp;pg=PA88 | doi = 10.1109/MWSYM.1997.602853 | isbn = 9780986488511|bibcode = 1997imsd.conf..553E }} reprinted in Igor Grigorov, Ed., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=09Zsv97IH1MC Antentop]'', Vol. 2, No.3, pp. 87–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of dielectric waveguides (such as optical fibers, see below) began as early as the 1920s, by several people, most famous of which are Rayleigh, [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]] and [[Peter Debye|Debye]].&lt;ref name="balanis"&gt;[http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471621943.html Advanced Engineering Electromagnetics], by C. A. Balanis, John Wiley &amp; Sons (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; 
Optical fiber began to receive special attention in the 1960s due to its importance to the communications industry.

The development of radio communication initially occurred at the lower frequencies because these could be more easily propagated over large distances.  The long wavelengths made these frequencies unsuitable for use in hollow metal waveguides because of the impractically large diameter tubes required.  Consequently, research into hollow metal waveguides stalled and the work of Lord Rayleigh was forgotten for a time and had to be rediscovered by others.  Practical investigations resumed in the 1930s by [[George C. Southworth]] at [[Bell Labs]] and [[Wilmer L. Barrow]] at [[MIT]].  Southworth at first took the theory from papers on waves in dielectric rods because the work of Lord Rayleigh was unknown to him.  This misled him somewhat; some of his experiments failed because he was not aware of the phenomenon of [[waveguide cutoff frequency]] already found in Lord Rayleigh's work.  Serious theoretical work was taken up by [[John R. Carson]] and Sallie P. Mead.  This work led to the discovery that for the TE&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; mode in circular waveguide losses go down with frequency and at one time this was a serious contender for the format for long distance telecommunications.&lt;ref&gt;Oliner, pp. 544-548&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of [[radar]] in [[World War II]] gave a great impetus to waveguide research, at least on the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] side.  The [[magnetron]] developed in 1940 by [[John Randall (physicist)|John Randall]] and [[Harry Boot]] at the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom provided a good power source and made microwave radars feasible.  The most important centre of research was at the [[Radiation Laboratory (MIT)|Radiation Laboratory]] (Rad Lab) at [[MIT]] but many others took part in the US, and in the UK such as the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]].  The head of the Fundamental Development Group at Rad Lab was [[Edward Mills Purcell]].  His researchers included [[Julian Schwinger]], [[Nathan Marcuvitz]], Carol Gray Montgomery, and [[Robert H. Dicke]].  Much of the Rad Lab work concentrated on finding [[lumped element model]]s of waveguide structures so that components in waveguide could be analysed with standard circuit theory.  [[Hans Bethe]] was also briefly at Rad Lab, but while there he produced his small aperture theory which proved important for [[waveguide filter#Resonant cavity filter|waveguide cavity filters]], first developed at Rad Lab.  The German side, on the other hand, largely ignored the potential of waveguides in radar until very late in the war.  So much so that when radar parts from a downed British plane were sent to [[Siemens &amp; Halske]] for analysis, even though they were recognised as microwave components, their purpose could not be identified.
{{blockquote|At that time, microwave techniques were badly neglected in Germany.  It was generally believed that it was of no use for electronic warfare, and those who wanted to do research work in this field were not allowed to do so.|H. Mayer, wartime vice-president of Siemens &amp; Halske}}
German academics were even allowed to continue publicly publishing their research in this field because it was not felt to be important.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Oliner, pp. 548-554|Levy &amp; Cohn, pp. 1055, 1057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after World War II waveguide was the technology of choice in the microwave field.  However, it has some problems; it is bulky, expensive to produce, and the cutoff frequency effect makes it difficult to produce wideband devices.  Ridged waveguide can increase bandwidth beyond an octave, but a better solution is to use a technology working in [[Transverse mode|TEM mode]] (that is, non-waveguide) such as [[coaxial]] conductors since TEM does not have a cutoff frequency.  A shielded rectangular conductor can also be used and this has certain manufacturing advantages over coax and can be seen as the forerunner of the planar technologies ([[stripline]] and [[microstrip]]).  However, planar technologies really started to take off when printed circuits were introduced.  These methods are significantly cheaper than waveguide and have largely taken its place in most bands.  However, waveguide is still favoured in the higher microwave bands from around [[Ku band]] upwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Oliner, pp. 556-557|Han &amp; Hwang, pp. 21-7, 21-50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Waveguide.aps.anl.gov.jpg|thumb|Waveguide supplying power for the [[Argonne National Laboratory]] [[Advanced Photon Source]].]]
The uses of waveguides for transmitting signals were known even before the term was coined. The phenomenon of sound waves guided through a taut wire have been known for a long time, as well as sound through a hollow pipe such as a [[cave]] or medical [[stethoscope]]. Other uses of waveguides are in transmitting power between the components of a system such as radio, radar or optical devices.  Waveguides are the fundamental principle of [[guided wave testing]] (GWT), one of the many methods of [[Nondestructive testing|non-destructive evaluation]].

Specific examples:
* Optical fibers transmit light and signals for long distances with low attenuation and a wide usable range of wavelengths.
* In a [[microwave oven]] a waveguide transfers power from the [[magnetron]], where waves are formed, to the cooking chamber.
* In a radar, a waveguide transfers radio frequency energy to and from the antenna, where the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] needs to be matched for efficient power transmission (see below).
* Rectangular and Circular waveguides are commonly used to connect feeds of parabolic dishes to their electronics, either low-noise receivers or power amplifier/transmitters.
* Waveguides are used in scientific instruments to measure optical, acoustic and elastic properties of materials and objects. The waveguide can be put in contact with the specimen (as in a [[medical ultrasonography]]), in which case the waveguide ensures that the power of the testing wave is conserved, or the specimen may be put inside the waveguide (as in a dielectric constant measurement&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Baker-Jarvis, "Transmission / reflection and short-circuit line permittivity measurements", NIST tech. note 1341, July 1990&lt;/ref&gt;), so that smaller objects can be tested and the accuracy is better.
* [[Transmission line]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are a specific type of waveguide, very commonly used.

===Propagation modes and cutoff frequencies===
A [[propagation mode]] in a waveguide is one solution of the wave equations, or, in other words, the form of the wave.&lt;ref name="balanis" /&gt; Due to the constraints of the [[boundary conditions]], there are only limited frequencies and forms for the wave function which can propagate in the waveguide. The lowest frequency in which a certain mode can propagate is the [[cutoff frequency]] of that mode. The mode with the lowest cutoff frequency is the fundamental mode of the waveguide, and its cutoff frequency is the waveguide cutoff frequency.

Propagation modes are computed by solving the [[Helmholtz equation]] alongside a set of boundary conditions depending on the geometrical shape and materials bounding the region. The usual assumption for infinitely long uniform waveguides allows us to assume a propagating form for the wave, i.e. stating that every field component has a known dependency on the propagation direction (i.e. &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;). More specifically, the common approach is to first replace all unknown time-varying unknown fields &lt;math&gt;u(x,y,z,t)&lt;/math&gt; (assuming for simplicity to describe the fields in [[Cartesian coordinate system|cartesian]] components) with their complex [[phasor]]s representation &lt;math&gt;U(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;, sufficient to fully describe any infinitely long single-tone signal at frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, (angular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega=2\pi f&lt;/math&gt;), and rewrite the Helmholtz equation and boundary conditions accordingly. Then, every unknown field is forced to have a form like &lt;math&gt;U(x,y,z)=\hat{U}(x,y)e^{-\gamma z}&lt;/math&gt;, where the &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; term represents the propagation constant (still unknown) along the direction along which the waveguide extends to infinity. The Helmholtz equation can be rewritten to accommodate such form and the resulting equality needs to be solved for &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{U}(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, yielding in the end an eigenvalue equation for &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and a corresponding eigenfunction &lt;math&gt;\hat{U}(x,y)_\gamma&lt;/math&gt;for each solution of the former.&lt;ref&gt;D. Pozar, "Microwave Engineering", Third Edition, John Wiley and Sons, 2005, Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The propagation constant &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; of the guided wave is complex, in general. For a lossless case, the propagation constant might be found to take on either real or imaginary values, depending on the chosen solution of the eigenvalue equation and on the angular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is purely real, the mode is said to be "below cutoff", since the amplitude of the field phasors tends to exponentially decrease with propagation; an imaginary &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, instead, represents modes said to be "in propagation" or "above cutoff", as the complex amplitude of the phasors does not change with &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fields and Waves in Communication Electronics|last=Ramo|first=Simon|last2=Whinnery|first2=John R.|last3=Van Duzer|first3=Theodore|publisher=Joh Wiley and Sons|year=1994|isbn=0-471-58551-3|location=New York|pages=321–324|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impedance matching===
In [[circuit theory]], the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is a generalization of [[electrical resistivity]] in the case of [[alternating current]], and is measured in [[ohm]]s (&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name="balanis" /&gt;
A waveguide in circuit theory is described by a [[transmission line]] having a length and characteristic impedance. In other words, the impedance indicates the ratio of voltage to current of the circuit component (in this case a waveguide) during propagation of the wave. This description of the waveguide was originally intended for alternating current, but is also suitable for electromagnetic and sound waves, once the wave and material properties (such as [[pressure]], [[density]], [[dielectric constant]]) are properly converted into electrical terms ([[Electric current|current]] and impedance for example).

Impedance matching is important when components of an electric circuit are connected (waveguide to antenna for example): The impedance ratio determines how much of the wave is transmitted forward and how much is reflected. In connecting a waveguide to an antenna a complete transmission is usually required, so an effort is made to match their impedances.

The reflection coefficient can be calculated using: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma=\frac{Z_2/Z_1-1}{Z_2/Z_1+1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the reflection coefficient (0 denotes full transmission, 1 full reflection, and 0.5 is a reflection of half the incoming voltage),  &lt;math&gt;Z_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z_2&lt;/math&gt; are the impedance of the first component (from  which the wave enters) and the second component, respectively.

An impedance mismatch creates a reflected wave, which added to the incoming waves creates a standing wave. An impedance mismatch can be also quantified with the [[standing wave ratio]] (SWR or VSWR for voltage), which is connected to the impedance ratio and reflection coefficient by: &lt;math&gt;VSWR=\frac{|V|_{max}}{|V|_{min}}=\frac{1+|\Gamma|}{1-|\Gamma|}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\left|V\right|_{min, max}&lt;/math&gt; are the minimum and maximum values of the voltage [[absolute value]], and the VSWR is the voltage standing wave ratio, which value of 1 denotes full transmission, without reflection  and thus no standing wave, while very large values mean high reflection and standing wave pattern.

== Electromagnetic waveguides ==
{{Main|Waveguide (electromagnetism)|transmission line}}
Waveguides can be constructed to carry waves over a wide portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], but are especially useful in the [[microwave]] and [[optics|optical]] frequency ranges. Depending on the frequency, they can be constructed from either [[Electrical conduction|conductive]] or [[dielectric]] materials. Waveguides are used for transferring both [[power (physics)|power]] and communication signals.

[[File:Radar waveguide.JPG|thumb|In this military radar, microwave radiation is transmitted between the source and the reflector by a waveguide. The figure suggests that microwaves leave the box in a circularly symmetric mode (allowing the antenna to rotate), then they are converted to a linear mode, and pass through a flexible stage. Their polarisation is then rotated in a twisted stage and finally they irradiate the parabolic antenna.]]

== Optical waveguides ==
{{Main|Waveguide (optics)}}
Waveguides used at optical frequencies are typically dielectric waveguides, structures in which a [[dielectric]] material with high [[permittivity]], and thus high [[index of refraction]], is surrounded by a material with lower permittivity. The structure guides optical waves by [[total internal reflection]]. An example of an optical waveguide is '''[[optical fiber]]'''.

Other types of optical waveguide are also used, including [[photonic-crystal fiber]], which guides waves by any of several distinct mechanisms. Guides in the form of a hollow tube with a highly reflective inner surface have also been used as [[light pipe]]s for illumination applications. The inner surfaces may be polished metal, or may be covered with a multilayer film that guides light by [[Bragg reflection]] (this is a special case of a photonic-crystal fiber).  One can also use small [[prism (optics)|prism]]s around the pipe which reflect light via total internal reflection [http://www.physics.ubc.ca/ssp/research/lightpipe.htm]&amp;mdash;such confinement is necessarily imperfect, however, since total internal reflection can never truly guide light within a ''lower''-index core (in the prism case, some light leaks out at the prism corners).

== Acoustic waveguides ==
{{Main|Waveguide (acoustics)}}

An ''acoustic waveguide'' is a physical structure for guiding sound waves. A duct for sound propagation also behaves like a [[transmission line]]. The duct contains some medium, such as air, that supports sound propagation.

== Mathematical waveguides ==
{{Main|Wave equation}}

Waveguides are interesting objects of study from a strictly mathematical perspective. A waveguide (or tube) is defined as type of boundary condition on the wave equation such that the wave function must be equal to zero on the boundary and that the allowed region is finite in all dimensions but one (an infinitely long cylinder is an example.) A large number of interesting results can be proven from these general conditions. It turns out that any tube with a bulge (where the width of the tube increases) admits at least one bound state. This can be shown using the variational principles. An interesting result by [[Jeffrey Goldstone]] and [[Robert Jaffe]] &lt;ref&gt;*[http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.45.14100] Bound States in Twisting Tubes, J Goldstone, R.L. Jaffe, MIT Department of Physics&lt;/ref&gt; is that any tube of constant width with a twist, admits a bound state.

{{Main|Digital waveguide synthesis}}

Sound synthesis uses [[digital delay line]]s as computational elements to simulate [[wave propagation]] in tubes of [[wind instruments]] and the [[vibrating strings]] of [[string instruments]].
