'''Allen Wright''' (1826–1885) was Principal chief of the [[Choctaw]] from late 1866 to 1870. He also became a Presbyterian minister after graduating from Union Theological Seminary in New York City. He was very active in the Choctaw government, holding several elected positions, and has been credited with the name ''[[Oklahoma]]'' (Choctaw word meaning "Home of the Red Man" in English) for the land that would become the state.&lt;ref name="Meserve"&gt;Meserve, John Bartlett. ''Chronicles of Oklahoma'' vol. 19, no. 4, December,1941. Retrieved December 17, 2012. [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v019/v019p314.html Chronicles of Oklahoma] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507052851/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v019/v019p314.html |date=May 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving in the Confederate Army during the Civil War, Wright was elected as Principal Chief from 1866 to 1870. He then became superintendent of schools for the Choctaw Nation from 1880 to 1884.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt;

==Early life==
Allen Wright was born in [[Attala County, Mississippi]] in November 1826.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt; A member of the [[Choctaw Nation]], his birth name was ''Kilihote''. His father was named ''Ishtemahilvbi'' and his mother a full-blood Choctaw, who died in June 1832. The father and surviving members of the family left Mississippi in October 1833 and arrived in what is now [[McCurtain County, Oklahoma]] in March 1834. According to a biography published by the ''Chronicles of Oklahoma'', his father died in 1839.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt; He went to live with Reverend [[Cyrus Kingsbury]] near [[Doaksville, Oklahoma|Doaksville]], went to a mission school at [[Pine Ridge, Oklahoma|Pine Ridge]]. After four years, he entered Spencer Academy, the main Choctaw tribal school. where he studied from 1844 to 1848.&lt;ref name="CNO"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.choctawnation.com/history/people/chiefs/1866---allen-wright/ |title=Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma: History |access-date=December 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128142809/http://www.choctawnation.com/history/people/chiefs/1866---allen-wright/ |archive-date=November 28, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given the name Allen Wright. The surname honored Reverend Alfred Wright, a noted Presbyterian missionary to the Choctaws.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Wright"&gt;May, John D. [http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=WR004 "Wright, Allen,"] ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture'', Oklahoma Historical Society, Accessed July 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After four years at Spencer, he was one of four students chosen by the Choctaw Council to attend college in an eastern state of the United States. Wright attended [[Delaware College]] in [[Newark, Delaware]] from 1848 to 1850, when the school closed. then enrolled at [[Union College]] in [[Schenectady, New York]], where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in July 1852 and joined a fraternity. In September 1852 he entered [[Union Theological Seminary (New York)|Union Theological Seminary]] in [[New York City]], where he received a Master of Arts degree in Theology in May 1855. He was the first Native American student from Indian Territory to earn this degree.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt; After graduation from the seminary he was ordained as a minister by the Presbyterian Church. He returned to the Choctaw Nation and became the principal instructor at [[Armstrong Academy]] during the 1855–1856 school term.&lt;ref name="CNO"/&gt;

Early in his life, Allen was not knowledgeable about Christianity. Exposure to missionaries, especially Presbyterians, caused him to learn more about the subject. Initially, he was skeptical, but in April 1846, he joined the Presbyterian Church. He began later to consider a career in the ministry and ultimately went to seminary.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt;

==Marriage and family==
He married Harriet Newell Mitchell of Ohio on February 11, 1857. She was born December 16, 1844 in Dayton, Ohio. The Presbyterian Board of Missions sent her to the Choctaw Nation in 1855. There she met and married Allen Wright. They had eight children together.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNO"/&gt; One son was Eliphalet Nott Wright (1858–1932), who became a medical doctor and also served as president of the Choctaw Oil Company.&lt;ref name="EOHC-ENWright"&gt;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v010/v010p267.html Wright, Muriel H. "A Brief Review of the Life of Doctor Eliphalet Nott Wright (1858–1932)]." ''Chronicles of Oklahoma''. Vol. 10,  No. 2, June 1932. Accessed August 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Muriel Hazel Wright]], noted Oklahoma author and historian, was a granddaughter of Allen and Harriet.

==Political career and service during the Civil War==
Wright became a member of the Choctaw Council in 1856. He was elected treasurer of the Choctaw Nation in 1859,  and a member  of the Choctaw Council in 1861.&lt;ref name="CNO"/&gt; According to the ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture'', he was elected to two terms in the Choctaw House of Representatives and to three terms as treasurer of the Choctaw Nation. Wright signed the 1861 treaty that allied the Choctaw Nation with the [[Confederate States of America]]. Subsequently, he joined the Confederate Army.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Wright"/&gt;

On July 25, 1862, Wright joined Captain Wilkin's Company of Choctaw infantry on July 25, 1862. He was transferred to Company F of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Mounted Rifles on June 13, 1863. When the war ended, Choctaw Chief [[Peter Pitchlynn]] sent him as a delegate to the Fort Smith conference where an armistice was signed.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt;

==Post Civil War==
Wright was elected Principal Chief of the Choctaw Tribe in 1866, and served until 1870. Some of his major accomplishments included:&lt;ref name="CNO"/&gt;

*Compiling a Choctaw dictionary for use in tribal schools.
*Translating the book of Psalms from Hebrew into Choctaw

Wright represented the Choctaw Nation at the [[Fort Smith Council]] and signed the [[Oklahoma Organic Act#Treaty of Washington .281866.29|Reconstruction Treaty of 1866]]. When the Federal commissioners proposed to consolidate all of Indian Territories tribes under an intertribal council, he suggested the term ''Oklahoma'' as the name for the Territory.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Wright"/&gt;

In 1885, he also served as editor and translator of the ''Indian Champion'' and was a charter member of the first Masonic lodge in Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="CNO"/&gt; He was also a member of the Royal Arch Masons in Maryland, which he had joined in 1866.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt;

Wright was superintendent of schools for the Choctaw Nation from 1880 to 1884.&lt;ref name="Meserve"/&gt;

Wright died in [[Boggy Depot, Oklahoma|Boggy Depot, Indian Territory]] on December 2, 1885. He was buried in the Boggy Depot cemetery.&lt;ref name="EOHC-Wright"/&gt; His widow died December 25, 1894 in the town of [[Atoka, Oklahoma|Atoka]].

'''Tuwuh Adijatitesih Amaranggana''' (born 8 July 1975) is an Indonesian actress, model, and singer better known as '''Amara''' or '''Mara'''.

== Career ==
Amara was born in [[Jakarta]], on 8 July 1975. She was a teenager in 1989, when she started her career as a model for the Indonesian fashion magazine Covergirl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.profilpedia.com/2014/10/profil-dan-biografi-amara.html |title=Biodata dan Profil Lengkap Amara | date = March 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Itje Komar, works as a producer for a recording studio called "Bintang Gemilang Jaya Sakti" in Jakarta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://eargasmme.blogspot.fr/2013/04/sejarah-neo.html |title=Sejarah NEO | date = April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nostalgia.tabloidnova.com/articles.asp?id=11840 |title=Indra Bekti (2) PADUKAN GAYA INDRA SAFERA &amp; TANTOWI YAHYA | date = December 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 she founded with Arie Widiawan, and her future husband [[Frans Mohede]], the [[trio (music)|vocal trio]], Lingua.

It has been said repeatedly that their decline was cause as a result of the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|Asian financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://masjaki.com/2012/04/14/lingua-yang-tetap-terngiang-di-telinga/ |title=Lingua yang Tetap Terngiang di Telinga | date = April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://arsip.gatra.com/2001-07-01/versi_cetak.php?id=7399 |title=Lingua Mengumpulkan Dana | date = June 24, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
After living more than eight years together, Amara married the artist [[Frans Mohede]] to [[Hong Kong]] on December 1, 1999. As Indonesian law prohibits [[interfaith marriage]] since 1974,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kapanlagi.com/showbiz/selebriti/10-pasangan-selebriti-ini-bahagia-meski-beda-keyakinan-b74b8c-6.html |title=10 Pasangan Selebriti Ini Bahagia Meski Beda Keyakinan | date = July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://books.google.fr/books?id=IPx8CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=amara+hong+kong+1999+frans&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y1lNeq0jeR&amp;sig=p6FRw47JZ6TOL6yA7KkBoH38q3I&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwA2oVChMIo-PSi9DrxgIVy28UCh0RVg2n#v=onepage&amp;q=amara%20hong%20kong%201999%20frans&amp;f=false |title=The Law of Love: Hukum Seputar Pranikah, Pernikahan, dan Perceraian di Indonesia | date = May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; this union was to save foreign civil status to be legally recognized.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fimela.com/lifestyle-relationship/hubungan-berbeda-agama-dapatkah-berakhir-bahagia-111124q-page1.html |title=Hubungan Berbeda Agama Dapatkah Berakhir Bahagia?| date = November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage has received parental disapproval of Amara who refuse to attend due to the difference in religion. Amara, is a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Muslim]] and Mohede, is a [[Protestant]] [[Christian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://arsip.gatra.com/2005-10-07/versi_cetak.php?id=88991 |title=Dilema Teologi Si Buah Hati PELIK dan rumit | date = October 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their differences they remain popular for being a couple, very tolerant and very respectful, Mohede and Amara are known to support each other, in their religious rites and practices.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Their controversial marriage then produced three children: Mahija Nathaniel Sambarana Aryantawira (born on June 8, 2004), Janitra Nathaniel Sambawikrama (born on September 8, 2006) and Rajaswa Nathaniel (born on October 17, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kapanlagi.com/showbiz/selebriti/kelahiran-si-kecil-belum-mendamaikan-amara-lingua-ibunya-uot6ej8.html |title=Kelahiran Si Kecil Belum Mendamaikan Amara Lingua-Ibunya| date = June 13, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.republika.co.id/berita/senggang/blitz/14/12/08/ng9pew-frans-dan-amara-tak-segan-perkenalkan-muay-thai-ke-anak |title=Frans dan Amara tak Segan Perkenalkan Muay Thai ke Anak| date = December 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antiochus II Theos''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀντίοχος Β΄ ὁ Θεός}}; 286 – July 246 BC) was a Greek king of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] [[Seleucid Empire]] who reigned from 261 to 246 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/articles/person/antiochus-ii-theos/?|title=Antiochus II Theos|work=Livius}}&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded his father [[Antiochus I Soter]] in the winter of 262–61 BC. He was the younger son of Antiochus I and princess [[Stratonice of Syria|Stratonice]], the daughter of [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius Poliorcetes]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Seleucid Dynasty|display=Seleucid Dynasty s.v. Antiochus II. Theos|volume=24|page=604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He inherited a state of war with [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]], the "[[Syrian Wars|Second Syrian War]]", which was fought along the coasts of [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], and the constant intrigues of petty despots and restless city-states in Asia Minor. Antiochus also made some attempt to get a footing in [[Thrace]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historystudies.net/Makaleler/1269663898_12-Jordan%20Il%C4%B1ev..pdf Dr. Jordan Iliev. "The Campaign of Antiochus II Theos in Thrace" - ''History Studies. International Journal of History'', 2013, 5/1, pp. 211-222.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307220332/http://www.historystudies.net/Makaleler/1269663898_12-Jordan%20Il%C4%B1ev..pdf |date=March 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war he was given the title ''Theos'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Θεός}}, "God"), being such to the Milesians in slaying the tyrant [[Timarchus of Miletus|Timarchus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Appianus]], ''Syriaca'', 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time Antiochus was occupied with the war against Egypt, [[Andragoras (3rd century BC)|Andragoras]], his satrap in [[Parthia]], proclaimed independence. According to [[Justin (historian)|Justin]]'s epitome of [[Pompeius Trogus]], in [[Bactria]], his satrap [[Diodotus I|Diodotus]] also revolted in 255 BC, and founded the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]], which further expanded in India in 180 BC to form the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] (180–1 BC). Then about 238 BC, [[Arsaces I of Parthia|Arsaces]] led a revolt of the [[Parthia]]ns against Andragoras, leading to the foundation of the [[Parthian Empire]]. These events would have cut off communications with India. [[Phylarchus]]&lt;ref&gt;In ''Athenaeum'' x.438c, also in [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''Various Histories'', ii.41.&lt;/ref&gt; relays current scandals regarding his drunken banquets and liaisons with unsuitable young men.

About this time, Antiochus made peace with [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], ending the Second Syrian War. Antiochus repudiated his wife [[Laodice I]] and exiled her to [[Ephesus]]. To seal the treaty, he married Ptolemy's daughter [[Berenice (Seleucid queen)|Berenice]] and received an enormous dowry.

During her stay in Ephesus, Laodice I continued numerous intrigues to become queen again. By 246 BC Antiochus had left Berenice and their infant son Antiochus, in [[Antioch]] to live again with Laodice I in Asia Minor.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Laodice I took the occasion to poison Antiochus while her partisans at Antioch murdered Berenice and their infant son. Antiochus was buried in the [[Belevi Mausoleum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/be-bm/belevi/belevi.html The Mausoleum of Antiochus II Theos]&lt;/ref&gt;

Laodice I then proclaimed Seleucus II as King. With his cousin-wife Laodice I, Antiochus had two sons: [[Seleucus II Callinicus]], [[Antiochus Hierax]] and three daughters: Apama, [[Stratonice of Cappadocia]] and [[Laodice (wife of Mithridates II of Pontus)|Laodice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/am-ao/antiochus/antiochus_ii_theos.html Biographical information on Antiochus II Theos]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with India==
Antiochus is mentioned&lt;ref name="Charpentier"/&gt; in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], as one of the recipients of the Indian Emperor [[Ashoka]]'s [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[proselytism]]:
:"And even this  conquest [preaching Buddhism] has been won by the Beloved of the Gods here and in all the borderlands, as far as six hundred [[yojana]]s (5,400-9,600 km) away, where '''Antiochus''', king of the Yavanas [Greeks] rules, and beyond this Antiochus four kings named [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]], [[Antigonus Gonatas|Antigonos]], [[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]] and [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]] rule."&lt;ref&gt;Translation of Jarl Charpentier 1931:303-321.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--this is not relevant to Antiochus II:"Likewise in the south among the [[Chola]]s, the [[Pandya]]s, and as far as [[Tamraparni]] ([[Sri Lanka]])." ([[Edicts of Ashoka]], 13th Rock Edict, S. Dhammika.)--&gt;

Ashoka also claims that he encouraged the development of [[herbal medicine]], for men and animals, in the territories of the Hellenistic kings:
:"Everywhere within Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi's [Ashoka's] domain, and among the people beyond the borders, the [[Chola]]s, the [[Pandya]]s, the Satiyaputras, the Keralaputras, as far as [[Tamraparni]] and where the Greek king '''Antiochus''' rules, and among the kings who are neighbors of Antiochos, everywhere has Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, made provision for two types of medical treatment: medical treatment for humans and medical treatment for animals. Wherever medical herbs suitable for humans or animals are not available, I have had them imported and grown. Wherever medical roots or fruits are not available I have had them imported and grown. Along roads I have had wells dug and trees planted for the benefit of humans and animals."&lt;ref&gt;[[Edicts of Ashoka]], 2nd Rock Edict.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, the Greek king mentioned in the Edict of Ashoka could also be Antiochus's father, [[Antiochus I Soter]], who arguably had more proximity with the East.&lt;ref name="Charpentier"&gt;Jarl Charpentier, "Antiochus, King of the Yavanas" ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies, University of London'' '''6'''.2  (1931: 303-321) argues that the Antiochus mentioned was unlikely to be Antiochus II, during whose time relations with India were broken by the Parthian intrusion and the independence of Diodotus in Bactria, and suggests instead the half-Iranian [[Antiochus I]], with stronger connections in the East.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arabella Duval Yarrington "Belle" Huntington''' (c.1851–1924) was the second wife of [[United States|American]] [[Robber baron (industrialist)|railway tycoon]] and [[industrialist]] [[Collis P. Huntington]], and then the second wife of [[Henry E. Huntington]]. She was once known as the richest woman in America, and as the force behind the art collection that is housed at the [[Huntington Library]].

== Biography ==
[[Image:Arabella Huntington Monument 1024.jpg|thumb|300px|The monument of Arabella Huntington in [[Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx|Woodlawn Cemetery]], [[Bronx]], [[New York (state)|NY]]]] Arabella Huntington was the second wife of [[Collis P. Huntington]]. After his death, she married his nephew [[Henry E. Huntington]], who was also a railway [[magnate]] and the founder of the famous [[Huntington Library|Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens]], in [[San Marino, California]]. She had a son, [[Archer Milton Huntington]].

Compared to her famous family, information about Arabella is scarce. She was apparently born in 1850 or 1851, probably in [[Richmond, Virginia]] (see Wark, p.&amp;nbsp;312). However, in the 1921 passenger list for the ship Aquitania, sailing from Cherbourg to New York, Arabella identified herself as being born in Mobile, Alabama on February 9, 1851.&lt;ref&gt;"List of United States Citizens (for the Immigration Authorities)", S.S. Aquitania sailing from Cherbourg 15 Oct 1921 Arriving at New York 21 Oct 1921, Available via Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt; Her first husband was a Mr. Worsham, of [[New York City|New York]], who died shortly after they were married, leaving her with a young son, named Archer (some other sources have suggested that they were not actually married, but that she was his mistress).&lt;ref name="newyorksocialdiary.com"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/socialdiary/2006/10_05_06/socialdiary10_05_06.php |title=His mother's son |website=[[New York Social Diary]] |access-date=October 18, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022151816/http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/socialdiary/2006/10_05_06/socialdiary10_05_06.php |archive-date=October 22, 2006 |dead-url=no |date=October 5, 2006 |volume=VI |number=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; (It has also been suggested that Archer's father was actually Collis Huntington, who legally adopted the boy when he was a teenager.).&lt;ref name="newyorksocialdiary.com"/&gt; In 1877 she was able to purchase some property in New York, which was later sold to [[John D. Rockefeller]].&lt;ref name="newyorksocialdiary.com"/&gt; She married Collis Huntington in 1884, in [[San Francisco, California]], and was left a widow a second time when he died in 1900.

==Huntington Fund for Cancer Research==
In 1902 Huntington gave $100,000 to [[Memorial Hospital (New York City, New York)|General Memorial Hospital]] in memory of her husband to establish the first cancer research fund in the country, the Huntington Fund for Cancer Research. The hospital would become the [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Art of Wealth: The Huntingtons in the Gilded Age | publisher=Huntington Library Press | author=Bennett, Shelley M. | date=1 May 2013 | location=San Marino, CA | pages=350 | isbn=978-0-87328-253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mskcc.org/about/historical-timeline | title=Historical Timeline | publisher=Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center | accessdate=25 June 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728220611/http://www.mskcc.org/about/historical-timeline | archive-date=2014-07-28 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 she married Henry Huntington. They were together until her death in 1924, and both are buried on the grounds of the Huntington Library. There is also a memorial to Arabella in the west wing of the Huntington Library building, which was dedicated in 1927, the year of Henry's death.

== Art collection ==
Throughout her life, Arabella was an inveterate collector of art, jewelry, antiques, and other luxury items. Her particular interests were in old masters, [[Medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] devotional images, and [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]-[[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] furniture and [[decorative arts]]. At her death, the entirety of her fortune and collections went to her son Archer, who donated many of her paintings to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City. These included two [[Rembrandt]]s, a [[Vermeer]], and several hundred other paintings, most of which had belonged to her husband Collis. The majority of the contents of her primary residence, including most of the artwork, on W. 57th St. were sent to auction. Many of the family's other belongings, including clothing, furniture, tapestries, and porcelain, were bequeathed to other institutions including [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and the [[California Palace of the Legion of Honor]] art museum in [[San Francisco]]. Some are located within the collections of the Huntington Library itself, and these formed the basis of an exhibition about Arabella in the Spring of 2006 entitled ''The Belle of San Marino''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huntington.org/Information/news/Arabella.pdf ''Arabella''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926213559/http://www.huntington.org/Information/news/Arabella.pdf |date=September 26, 2006 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Only the small collection of Medieval and Renaissance paintings at the Huntington Library were in Arabella's own collection. They were purchased by Henry Huntington after her death from an auction set up by her son, Archer. The remainder of the objects in the 'Arabella Memorial Collection' at the Huntington were purchased after her death by Henry Huntington and are only representational of the objects she formerly owned, not the actual objects themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Watters|first=Sam|title=Lost L.A.: Huntington's private tribute to wife Arabella|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/14/home/la-hm-lost-la-arabella-huntington-20110514|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=14 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429051004/http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/14/home/la-hm-lost-la-arabella-huntington-20110514|archive-date=2014-04-29|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archer M. Huntington ==
Arabella Huntington's son [[Archer M. Huntington|Archer]] shared her love for art and culture. He was a great friend of [[non-profit organization]]s, especially museums. He was also one of the world's leading experts on [[Spanish poetry]] and was the founder of the [[Hispanic Society of America]] in New York City.

In a criminal investigation a person has to be declared an ''arguido'' prior to being arrested.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article2407089.ece|title=Q&amp;A: what is an arguido, or suspect, in Portugal?|publisher=The Times|date=2007-09-07|accessdate = 2007-09-08 | location=London | first=Graham | last=Keeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese law makes a distinction between ''arguido ''and suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janusonline.pt/2004/2004_3_4_3.html |title=Janus 2004 &amp;#124; As garantias dos arguidos no processo penal português |publisher=Janusonline.pt |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The rights of an ''arguido''==

If a person becomes an ''arguido'', they automatically gain certain rights that a witness or suspect would not have.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6657977.stm|title=Q&amp;A: Suspects and Portuguese law|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2007-09-07|accessdate = 2007-09-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070910224226/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6657977.stm| archivedate= 10 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ''arguido'' has the right to be accompanied by a lawyer when questioned.&lt;ref name=times /&gt; The investigating police may ask the ''arguido'' more direct accusatory questions (the answers to which would not be admissible in court if possibly self-incriminatory and asked of a non-''arguido'') but the ''arguido'' must be presented with whatever evidence is held against them,&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; and unlike a witness has the [[right to silence|right to remain silent]],&lt;ref name=metro&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=65170&amp;in_page_id=34|title=Why is Kate McCann now a 'suspect'?|publisher=''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]''|date=2007-09-07|accessdate = 2007-09-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929082943/http://www.metro.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=65170&amp;in_page_id=34| archivedate= 29 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; not to answer any question that may incriminate the person, and does not face legal action for lying.&lt;ref name="dn.sapo.pt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dn.sapo.pt/2007/09/10/opiniao/arguidos_e_regresso.html |title=Arguidos E Regresso |publisher=Dn.sapo.pt |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201195418/http://dn.sapo.pt/2007/09/10/opiniao/arguidos_e_regresso.html |archivedate=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Witness]]es in criminal investigations are legally bound to co-operate with the police and do not have the right to silence and face legal actions if they lie.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref name="dn.sapo.pt"/&gt;  Because of the legal advantages, some individuals apply for ''arguido'' status to be given to themselves, e.g. when it would appear that the police suspect them but are trying to use their witness status to extract as much information as possible.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

A person who has ''arguido'' status has not been formally accused of a crime, arrested or charged,&lt;ref name=skynews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,70131-1265804,00.html|title='Formal Suspect' - The Portuguese Law|publisher=[[Sky News]]|date=2007-05-15|accessdate = 2007-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and not all ''arguidos'' are subsequently charged.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;
The police may ask a court to restrict an ''arguido'''s movement and oblige them to not leave the country.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;
''Arguidos'' cannot change their place of residence, without permission from a court.&lt;ref name=skynews /&gt;
There is no time limit on the status.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/09/08/nmaddy308.xml|title=Portuguese law: naming an 'arguida'|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=2007-09-08|accessdate = 2007-09-08 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with common-law administrations==
The status is very similar to that of being "questioned under caution" under the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984|Police and Criminal Evidence Act]] in the United Kingdom or being questioned after being read one's "[[Miranda Rights]]" in the USA, specifically the right to legal representation, the liberty to refuse to answer questions, and the admissibility in court of statements taken whilst in those statuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/10/uk.pressandpublishing | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Media have rushed to judge Portuguese police | first=Marcel | last=Berlins | date=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Arguido'' derives from the Latin ''arguire'' or ''arguere''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/definir_resultados.aspx |title=Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa On-line Priberam |publisher=Priberam.pt |date= |access-date=25 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100424022125/http://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/definir_resultados.aspx| archivedate= 24 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookit.pl?latin=arguire |title=Latin Dictionary and Grammar Aid |publisher=Archives.nd.edu |date= |access-date=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English words ''argue'' and ''argument'' have the same etymology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=argument&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |access-date=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=argument |title=Argument &amp;#124; Definition of Argument by Merriam-Webster |publisher=M-W.com |date=25 April 2007 |access-date=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Atika Shubert''' is a [[CNN]] correspondent based in Berlin. She covers Germany as well as the rest of Europe for CNN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turnertv.de/presse/pressemitteilung/article/atika-shubert-wird-neue-berlin-korrespondentin-fuer-cnn-international/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910075215/http://www.turnertv.de/presse/pressemitteilung/article/atika-shubert-wird-neue-berlin-korrespondentin-fuer-cnn-international/ |archivedate=2015-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before her promotion she was based in London. Prior to working for CNN, she was a correspondent for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' in [[Indonesia]] as she speaks both [[English language|English]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] fluently. She is a graduate of the Class of 1991 of [[Jakarta International School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumni.jisedu.or.id/new/whats_new.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213073815/http://alumni.jisedu.or.id/new/whats_new.asp |archivedate=2010-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is an Economics graduate of [[Tufts University]] in [[Medford, Massachusetts]]. She gave birth to a son in 2009.

==Career==
Shubert started her career with CNN as a producer in Jakarta, Indonesia, where she covered the fall of Indonesia’s President Suharto in 1998, East Timor’s transition to independence in 1999. Shubert joined CNN as a reporter for CNN's [[Jakarta]] bureau, and was appointed to the position of [[Tokyo]] correspondent in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Atika Shubert is CNN's new Tokyo correspondent | url = http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k4/may/may159.htm | publisher = Indiantelevision.com | date = 19 May 2004 | accessdate = 1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her time reporting from Tokyo, Shubert covered a number of major news stories in Japan, including the controversial deployment of Japan's [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Self-Defense Forces]], the Japanese hostage situation in [[Iraq]] and the verdict of [[Shoko Asahara]] (the mastermind behind the 1995 [[Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway|sarin gas attack]] in Tokyo).  In the summer of 2005, Shubert reported live from [[Hiroshima]] on the commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the 1945 [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing]] for CNN's special ''Remembering Hiroshima''.  She also reported on the [[2006 North Korean nuclear test|nuclear tensions]] in the Korean Peninsula in 2006, after [[North Korea]] tested nuclear weapons.

CNN claims that Shubert was one of the first CNN correspondents to report on the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] and resulting [[tsunami]], reporting from [[Aceh]], Indonesia, where she was vacationing at the time.  Also in Indonesia, Shubert covered a number of major new events that included the [[2002 Bali bombings]], the fall of Indonesian President [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] and the inauguration of President [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]], [[East Timor]]'s transition to independence, the resurgence of the [[Free Aceh Movement|Free Aceh]] separatist movement, the religious conflict in [[Ambon City]] and the fall of former Indonesian President [[Suharto]] and resulting [[Reformation (Indonesia)|reform movement]].  Shubert also briefly covered the [[Schapelle Corby]] verdict in [[Bali]]; however, due to the time consuming and overall expensive nature of this landmark court case, CNN eventually opted to run stock footage obtained from its Australian network affiliates instead of direct reporting.  Shubert has also contributed reports from the [[Philippines]] and [[Singapore]].

From 2008 until 2015 Shubert was based in the CNN London bureau covering stories from around the UK and Europe. She relocated to Berlin in June 2015 to cover Germany and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turnertv.de/presse/pressemitteilung/article/atika-shubert-wird-neue-berlin-korrespondentin-fuer-cnn-international/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910075215/http://www.turnertv.de/presse/pressemitteilung/article/atika-shubert-wird-neue-berlin-korrespondentin-fuer-cnn-international/ |archivedate=2015-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interview with Julian Assange ==
In October, 2010, Shubert interviewed [[WikiLeaks]] founder [[Julian Assange]] shortly after his organization [[Iraq War documents leak|released classified US military documents]] related to the [[Iraq War]]. After asking him questions about internal issues related to Wikileaks itself, she began asking questions about his [[Julian Assange#Swedish sex crime investigation and arrest warrant|alleged sexual assaults]]. Assange stated that if this line of questioning continued, as opposed to being asked questions directly related to the leaked documents, he would leave the interview. Shubert persisted in her line of questioning, and Assange walked out of the interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/23/julian-assange-walks-out-_n_772837.html |work=Huffington Post |first=Danny |last=Shea |title=Julian Assange WALKS OUT Of CNN Interview (VIDEO) |date=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/12/01/assange.profile/ |publisher=CNN |title=The secret life of Julian Assange |date=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5185">'''"The Big Four"''' was the name popularly given to the famous and influential [[businessmen]], [[philanthropy|philanthropists]] and railroad tycoons who built the [[Central Pacific Railroad]], (C.P.R.R.), which formed the western portion through the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]] of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad (North America)|First Transcontinental Railroad]] in the [[United States]], built from the mid-continent at the [[Mississippi River]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]] during the middle and late 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Yenne, Bill| title=The History of the Southern Pacific| year=1985| publisher=Bison Books| pages=10–11| isbn=0-517-46084-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Composed of [[Leland Stanford]], (1824&amp;ndash;1893), [[Collis Potter Huntington]], (1821&amp;ndash;1900), [[Mark Hopkins (railroad)|Mark Hopkins]], (1813&amp;ndash;1878), and [[Charles Crocker]], (1822&amp;ndash;1888), the four themselves however, personally preferred to be known as "The Associates."&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, John Debo, C.E. ''"The First Transcontinental Railroad"'' New York: Simmons-Boardman Co. (1950) Ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
*[[Leland Stanford]], (1824&amp;ndash;1893), &amp;ndash; [[Central Pacific Railroad|C.P.R.R.]] President, [[Stanford University]] founder.
*[[Collis Potter Huntington]], (1821&amp;ndash;1900), &amp;ndash; [[Central Pacific Railroad|C.P.R.R.]] Vice President, for which the city of [[Huntington, West Virginia]] was named. He is also the uncle of [[Henry E. Huntington]], (1850&amp;ndash;1927), founder of the famous [[Huntington Library]] with its art galleries and gardens in [[San Marino, California]].
*[[Mark Hopkins (railroad)|Mark Hopkins]], (1813&amp;ndash;1878), &amp;ndash; [[Central Pacific Railroad|C.P.R.R.]] Treasurer
*[[Charles Crocker]], (1822&amp;ndash;1888), &amp;ndash; Construction Supervisor, President of Charles Crocker &amp; Co., a [[Central Pacific Railroad|C.P.R.R.]] subsidiary, later founder of the larger, more extensive [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], another transcontinental link to the east, built later in 1883.

Collectively, the four philanthropically also established the [[Sacramento Public Library|Sacramento Library Association]] for the [[state capital]] in [[Sacramento, California]] in 1857, which later established the present [[Sacramento Public Library]].&lt;ref name=SacLibFacts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saclibrary.org/About-Us/|title=ABOUT US|date=|first=|last=|publisher=Sacramento PublicLibrary|accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Hewes]], an enterprising businessman, was called the "maker of San Francisco" for his work in clearing land for development. He was invited to be a part of the "Big Four" but declined due to the financial risks. Over his lifetime he gained and lost several fortunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cshouse.org/Pages/hewes.html|title=Camron-Stanford House Preservation Association: David Hewes and family|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their time, the four men were sometimes referred to as [[nabob|nabobs]] or "nobs," a reference to their wealth and influence. When the four built mansions in the same neighborhood of [[San Francisco]], the area quickly became known as [[Nob Hill]], a name it carries today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sftravel.com/article/nob-hill-touch-class|title=Nob Hill - A Touch of Class|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
[[Ambrose Bierce]] lampooned the "Big Four" in his work ''"Black Beetles in Amber"'', a collection of satirical verses attacking various prominent Californians. In "The Birth of the Rail", "road agents" (bandits) Happy Hunty (Huntington), Cowboy Charley (Crocker), and Leland The Kid (Stanford), joined by minor devil Sootymug (Hopkins), give up robbing stage coaches for the much greater loot of railroad operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Bierce, Ambrose| authorlink=Ambrose Bierce| url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12977/12977.txt| title=Black Beetles in Amber| accessdate=2006-05-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060529102639/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12977/12977.txt| archivedate= 29 May 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dalai Lama figure is important for many reasons.

From 1642 until 1705, and from 1750 to the 1950s, the Dalai Lamas or their [[regent]]s headed the Tibetan government (or [[Ganden Phodrang]]) in [[Lhasa (prefecture-level city)|Lhasa]] which governed all or most of the [[Tibetan plateau]] with varying degrees of autonomy&lt;ref name="smith107149"&gt;Smith 1997, pp. 107–149.&lt;/ref&gt; under the [[Tibet under Qing rule|Qing Dynasty of China]], up to complete sovereignty.&lt;ref name="bell273"&gt;Bell 1946, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; This Tibetan government also enjoyed the [[priest and patron|patronage and protection]] of firstly Mongol kings of the [[Khoshut Khanate|Khoshut]] and [[Dzungar Khanate]]s (1642–1720) and then of the emperors of the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] (1720–1912).&lt;ref name="smith107149" /&gt; Tibet's sovereignty was later rejected, however, by both [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|the Republic of China]] and the current [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="Kavalski2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emilian Kavalski|title=The Ashgate Research Companion to Chinese Foreign Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ynTeCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT445|date=1 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-04389-8|pages=445–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of Tibet}}
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
In Central Asian Buddhist countries, it has been widely believed for the last millennium that [[Avalokiteśvara]], the [[bodhisattva]] of compassion, has a special relationship with the people of Tibet and intervenes in their fate by incarnating as benevolent rulers and teachers such as the Dalai Lamas. This is according to ''The Book of Kadam'', the main text of the [[Kadampa]] school, to which the [[First Dalai Lama]], [[Gendun Drup]], first belonged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Thubten Jinpa |title = The Book of Kadam |publisher=Wisdom Publications |ISBN = 978-0-86171-441-4 |url = http://www.wisdompubs.org/book/book-kadam/introduction |chapter=Introduction |quote = Available textual evidence points strongly toward the 11th and 12th centuries as the period during which the full myth of Avalokiteśvara's special destiny with Tibet was established. During this era, the belief that this compassionate spirit intervenes in the fate of the Tibetan people by manifesting as benevolent rulers and teachers took firm root}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In fact, this text is said to have laid the foundation for the Tibetans' later identification of the Dalai Lamas as incarnations of Avalokiteśvara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thubten Jinpa|title=The Book of Kadam|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-441-4|url=http://www.wisdompubs.org/book/book-kadam/introduction|chapter=Introduction|quote=Perhaps the most important legacy of the book, at least for the Tibetan people as a whole, is that it laid the foundation for the later identification of Avalokiteśvara with the lineage of the Dalai Lama}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|reason=This is a popular publisher, and due to position author has distance to subject is not sufficient. There are many scholarly publications about this.|date=November 2017}}

It traces the legend of the bodhisattva's incarnations as [[List of rulers of Tibet|early Tibetan kings and emperors]] such as [[Songtsen Gampo]] and later as [[Dromtönpa]] (1004–1064).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Thubten Jinpa |title=The Book of Kadam |publisher=Wisdom Publications |ISBN = 978-0-86171-441-4 |url = http://www.wisdompubs.org/book/book-kadam/introduction |chapter=Introduction |quote = For the Tibetans, the mythic narrative that began with Avalokiteśvara's embodiment in the form of Songtsen Gampo in the seventh century—or even earlier with the mythohistorical figures of the first king of Tibet, Nyatri Tsenpo (traditionally calculated to have lived around the fifth century B.C.E.), and Lha Thothori Nyentsen (ca. third century c.e.), during whose reign some sacred Buddhist scriptures are believed to have arrived in Tibet... continued with Dromtönpa in the eleventh century}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This lineage has been extrapolated by Tibetans up to and including the Dalai Lamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thubten Jinpa|title=The Book of Kadam|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-441-4|url=http://www.wisdompubs.org/book/book-kadam/introduction|chapter=Introduction|quote=For the Tibetans, the mythic narrative... continues today in the person of His Holiness Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins in myth and legend ===
Thus, according to such sources, an informal line of succession of the present Dalai Lamas as incarnations of [[Avalokiteśvara]] stretches back much further than [[Gendun Drub]]. ''The Book of Kadam'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thubten Jinpa|title=The Book of Kadam|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-441-4|url=http://www.wisdompubs.org/book/book-kadam}}&lt;/ref&gt; the compilation of Kadampa teachings largely composed around discussions between the Indian sage [[Atiśa]] (980–1054) and his Tibetan host and chief disciple [[Dromtönpa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thubten Jinpa|title=The Book of Kadam|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-441-4|url=http://www.wisdompubs.org/book/book-kadam/introduction|chapter=Introduction|quote=‘The Book’ gives ample evidence of the existence of an ancient, mythological Tibetan narrative placing the Dalai Lamas as incarnations of Dromtönpa, of his predecessors and of [[Avalokiteshvara]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tuttle, Gray|author2=Schaeffer, Curtis R.|title=The Tibetan History Reader|date=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-51354-8|page=335|quote=In Atiśa's telling, Dromtön was not only Avalokiteśvara but also a reincarnation of former Buddhist monks, laypeople, commoners, and kings. Furthermore, these reincarnations were all incarnations of that very same being, Avalokiteśvara. Van der Kuijp takes us on a tour of literary history, showing that the narrative attributed to Atiśa became a major source for both incarnation and reincarnation ideology for centuries to come." From: "The Dalai Lamas and the Origins of Reincarnate Lamas. Leonard W. J. van der Kuijp"}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''‘Tales of the Previous Incarnations of Arya Avalokiteśvara’'',&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; nominate as many as sixty persons prior to Gendun Drub who are enumerated as earlier incarnations of Avalokiteśvara and predecessors in the same lineage leading up to him. In brief, these include a mythology of 36 Indian personalities plus 10 [[List of rulers of Tibet|early Tibetan kings and emperors]], all said to be previous incarnations of Dromtönpa, and fourteen further Nepalese and Tibetan yogis and sages in between him and the [[first Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref&gt;Stein (1972), p. 138–139|quote=the Dalai Lama is ... a link in the chain that starts in history and leads back through legend to a deity in mythical times. The First Dalai Lama, Gedün-trup (1391–1474), was already the 51st incarnation; the teacher Dromtön, Atiśa's disciple (eleventh century), the 45th; whilst with the 26th, one Gesar king of India, and the 27th, a hare, we are in pure legend&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, according to the "Birth to Exile" article on the 14th Dalai Lama's website, he is "the seventy-fourth in a lineage that can be traced back to a Brahmin boy who lived in the time of Buddha Shakyamuni."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dalai Lama – Birth to Exile|url=http://www.dalailama.com/biography/from-birth-to-exile|website=His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet|publisher=Office of the Dalai Lama|accessdate=28 October 2015|quote=Thus His Holiness is also believed to be a manifestation of Chenrezig, in fact the seventy-fourth in a lineage that can be traced back to a Brahmin boy who lived in the time of Buddha Shakyamuni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Avalokiteśvara's 'Dalai Lama master plan' ===
According to the [[14th Dalai Lama]], long ago Avalokiteśvara had promised the [[Buddha]] to guide and protect the [[Tibetan people]] and in the late Middle Ages, his master plan to fulfill this promise was the stage-by-stage establishment of the Dalai Lama theocracy in Tibet.&lt;ref name=Laird138&gt;Laird 2006, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

First, Tsongkhapa established three great monasteries around Lhasa in the province of [[Ü (region)|Ü]] before he died in 1419.&lt;ref name=norb216&gt;Norbu 1968, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1st Dalai Lama]] soon became Abbot of the greatest one, [[Drepung]], and developed a large popular power base in Ü. He later extended this to cover Tsang,&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; where he constructed a fourth great monastery, [[Tashilhunpo Monastery|Tashi Lhunpo]], at [[Shigatse]].&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2nd Dalai Lama|2nd]] studied there before returning to Lhasa,&lt;ref name=Laird138 /&gt; where he became Abbot of Drepung.&lt;ref name=TN1&gt;Smith 1997, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Having reactivated the 1st's large popular followings in Tsang and Ü,&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, p. 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt; the 2nd then moved on to southern Tibet and gathered more followers there who helped him construct a new monastery, [[Chokorgyel Monastery|Chokorgyel]].&lt;ref name=shak91&gt;Shakabpa 1984, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; He also established the method by which later Dalai Lama incarnations would be discovered through visions at the 'oracle lake', [[Lhamo Lhatso]].&lt;ref name="laird139"&gt;Laird 2006, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[3rd Dalai Lama|3rd]] built on his predecessors' fame by becoming Abbot of the two great monasteries of Drepung and [[Sera Monastery|Sera]].&lt;ref name="laird139" /&gt; The stage was set for the great Mongol King [[Altan Khan]], hearing of his reputation, to invite the 3rd to [[Mongolia]] where he converted the King and his followers to Buddhism, as well as other Mongol princes and their followers covering a vast tract of central Asia. Thus most of Mongolia was added to the Dalai Lama's sphere of influence, founding a spiritual empire which largely survives to the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 140–145.&lt;/ref&gt; After being given the Mongolian name 'Dalai',&lt;ref&gt;MacKay 2003, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; he returned to Tibet to found the great monasteries of [[Lithang]] in Kham, eastern Tibet and [[Kumbum Monastery|Kumbum]] in Amdo, north-eastern Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[4th Dalai Lama|4th]] was then born in Mongolia as the great grandson of [[Altan Khan]], thus cementing strong ties between Central Asia, the Dalai Lamas, the [[Gelugpa]] and [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 147–149.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in fulfilment of Avalokiteśvara's master plan, the [[5th Dalai Lama|5th]] in the succession used the vast popular power base of devoted followers built up by his four predecessors. By 1642, a strategy that was planned and carried out by his resourceful ''chagdzo'' or manager [[Sonam Rapten]] with the military assistance of his devoted disciple [[Gushri Khan]], Chieftain of the [[Khoshut]] Mongols, enabled the 'Great 5th' to found the Dalai Lamas' religious and political reign over more or less the whole of Tibet that survived for over 300 years.&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 149–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus the Dalai Lamas became pre-eminent spiritual leaders in Tibet and 25 Himalayan and Central Asian kingdoms and countries bordering Tibet and their prolific literary works have "for centuries acted as major sources of spiritual and philosophical inspiration to more than fifty million people of these lands".&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 1982, p.''iv''&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, they have played 'a monumental role in Asian literary, philosophical and religious history'.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 1983, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== How the Dalai Lama lineage became established ===
Gendun Drup (1391–1474), a disciple of the founder [[Je Tsongkhapa|Je Tsongkapa]],&lt;ref name="陈庆英2005_p15"&gt;{{cite book|author=陈庆英|title=达赖喇嘛转世及历史定制英|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haMIsdC3iZwC&amp;pg=PA15|year=2005|publisher=五洲传播出版社|isbn=978-7-5085-0745-3|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the ordination name of the monk who came to be known as the '[[First Dalai Lama]]', but only from 104 years after he died.&lt;ref name=rich&gt;Richardson 1984, pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;
There had been resistance, since first he was ordained a monk in the Kadampa tradition&lt;ref name=shak91 /&gt; and for various reasons, for hundreds of years the Kadampa school had eschewed the adoption of the ''tulku'' system to which the older schools adhered.&lt;ref name=mull87&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tsongkhapa]] largely modelled his new, reformed [[Gelugpa]] school on the Kadampa tradition and refrained from starting a tulku system.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, although Gendun Drup grew to be a very important Gelugpa lama, after he died in 1474 there was no question of any search being made to identify his incarnation.&lt;ref name=mull87 /&gt;

Despite this, when the Tashilhunpo monks started hearing what seemed credible accounts that an incarnation of Gendun Drup had appeared nearby and repeatedly announced himself from the age of two, their curiosity was aroused.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 90–95.&lt;/ref&gt; It was some 55 years after Tsongkhapa's death. When eventually the monastic authorities saw compelling evidence which convinced them that the child in question was indeed the incarnation of their founder, they felt obliged to break with their own tradition. In 1487, the boy was renamed [[Gendun Gyatso]] and installed at Tashilhunpo as Gendun Drup's tulku, albeit informally.&lt;ref name=mull956&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gendun Gyatso died in 1542 and the lineage of Dalai Lama tulkus finally became firmly established when the third incarnation, [[3rd Dalai Lama|Sonam Gyatso]] (1543–1588), came forth. He made himself known as the ''tulku'' of Gendun Gyatso and was formally recognised and enthroned at Drepung in 1546.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 137–8.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was given the titular name "Dalai Lama" by the Tümed [[Altan Khan]] in 1578,&lt;ref name="Tagliacozzo2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Tagliacozzo|title=Asia Inside Out: Changing Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rKLrBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT153|date=5 January 2015|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-96694-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|153}} it was also accorded to his last two predecessors and he became known as the third in the lineage.&lt;ref name=rich /&gt;

=== 1st Dalai Lama ===
The Dalai Lama lineage started from humble beginnings.&lt;ref&gt;Bell 1946, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; 'Pema Dorje' (1391–1474), the boy who was to become the first in the line, was born in a cattle pen&lt;ref name=norb215&gt;Norbu 1968, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; in Shabtod, [[Ü-Tsang|Tsang]] in 1391.&lt;ref name="shak91" /&gt; His nomad parents kept sheep and goats and lived in tents. When his father died in 1398 his mother was unable to support the young goatherd so she entrusted him to his uncle, a monk at [[Narthang Monastery|Narthang]], a major Kadampa monastery near Shigatse, for education as a Buddhist monk.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 52–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Narthang ran the largest printing press in Tibet&lt;ref&gt;David-Neel 2007, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; and its celebrated library attracted scholars and adepts from far and wide, so Pema Dorje received an education beyond the norm at the time as well as exposure to diverse spiritual schools and ideas.&lt;ref name=mull54&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied Buddhist philosophy extensively and in 1405, ordained by Narthang's abbot, he took the name of Gendun Drup.&lt;ref name=shak91 /&gt; Soon recognised as an exceptionally gifted pupil, the abbot tutored him personally and took special interest in his progress.&lt;ref name=mull54 /&gt; In 12 years he passed the 12 grades of monkhood and took the highest vows.&lt;ref name=norb215 /&gt; After completing his intensive studies at Narthang he left to continue at specialist monasteries in Central Tibet, his grounding at Narthang was revered among many he encountered.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 54, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1415 Gendun Drup met [[Tsongkhapa]], founder of the [[Gelugpa]] school, and became his student; their meeting was of decisive historical and political significance as he was later to be known as the [[First Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref&gt;Dhondub 1984, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; When eventually Tsongkhapa's successor [[Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, 1st Panchen Lama|Khedrup Je, the Panchen Lama]] died, Gendun Drup became the leader of the Gelugpa.&lt;ref name=norb215 /&gt; He rose to become Abbot of Drepung, the greatest Gelugpa monastery, outside Lhasa.&lt;ref name=TN1 /&gt;

It was mainly due to Gendun Drup's energy and ability that Tsongkhapa's new school grew into an expanding order capable of competing with others on an equal footing.&lt;ref name=snel182&gt;Snellgrove &amp; Richardson 1986, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking advantage of good relations with the nobility and a lack of determined opposition from rival orders, on the very edge of Karma Kagyu-dominated territory he founded Tashilhunpo Monastery at Shigatse.&lt;ref name=snel182 /&gt; He was based there, as its Abbot, from its founding in 1447 until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1984, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Tashilhunpo, 'Mountain of Blessings', became the fourth great Gelugpa monastery in Tibet, after [[Ganden]], Drepung and Sera had all been founded in Tsongkhapa's time.&lt;ref name=norb216 /&gt; It later became the seat of the [[Panchen Lamas]].&lt;ref name=bell33&gt;Bell 1946, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;
By establishing it at Shigatse in the middle of Tsang, he expanded the Gelugpa sphere of influence, and his own, from the Lhasa region of Ü to this province, which was the stronghold of the [[Karma Kagyu]] school and their patrons, the rising [[Tsangpa]] dynasty.&lt;ref name=norb216 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1997, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Tashilhunpo was destined to become 'Southern Tibet's greatest monastic university'&lt;ref name=mull242&gt;Mullin 1983, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; with a complement of 3,000 monks.&lt;ref name="shak91" /&gt;

Gendun Drup was said to be the greatest scholar-saint ever produced by [[Narthang Monastery]]&lt;ref name=mull242 /&gt; and became 'the single most important lama in Tibet'.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Through hard work he became a leading lama, known as 'Perfecter of the Monkhood', 'with a host of disciples'.&lt;ref name=bell33 /&gt; Famed for his Buddhist scholarship he was also referred to as ''Panchen Gendun Drup'', 'Panchen' being an honorary title designating 'great scholar'.&lt;ref name=shak91 /&gt; By the great [[Jonangpa]] master Bodong Chokley Namgyal&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Bodong Chogle Namgyel]]&lt;/ref&gt; he was accorded the honorary title ''Tamchey Khyenpa'' meaning "The Omniscient One", an appellation that was later assigned to all Dalai Lama incarnations.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 58–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 50, he entered meditation retreat at [[Narthang Monastery|Narthang]]. As he grew older, [[Karma Kagyu]] adherents, finding their sect was losing too many recruits to the monkhood to burgeoning [[Gelugpa]] monasteries, tried to contain Gelug expansion by launching military expeditions against them in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to decades of military and political power struggles between [[Tsangpa]] dynasty forces and others across central Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Dhondup 1984, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to ameliorate these clashes, from his retreat Gendun Drup issued a poem of advice to his followers advising restraint from responding to violence with more violence and to practice compassion and patience instead. The poem, entitled ''Shar Gang Rima'', "The Song of the Eastern Snow Mountains", became one of his most enduring popular literary works.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he was born in a cattle pen to be a simple goatherd, Gendun Drup thus rose to become one of the most celebrated and respected teachers in Tibet and Central Asia. His spiritual accomplishments brought him lavish donations from devotees which he used to build and furnish new monasteries, to print and distribute Buddhist texts and to maintain monks and meditators.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 6.9&lt;/ref&gt; At last, at the age of 84, older than any of his 13 successors, in 1474 he went on foot to visit [[Narthang Monastery]] on a final teaching tour. Returning to Tashilhunpo&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; he died 'in a blaze of glory, recognised as having attained Buddhahood'.&lt;ref name=bell33 /&gt;

His mortal remains were interred in a bejewelled silver [[stupa]] at Tashilhunpo, which survived the [[Cultural Revolution]] and can still be seen.&lt;ref name=mull87 /&gt;

=== 2nd Dalai Lama ===
Like the Kadampa, the [[Gelugpa]] eschewed the ''tulku'' system.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 87, 94–5.&lt;/ref&gt; After Gendun Drup died, however, a boy called Sangyey Pel born to Nyngma adepts at Yolkar in [[Ü-Tsang|Tsang]],&lt;ref name=shak91 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; declared himself at 3 to be "Gendun Drup" and asked to be 'taken home' to Tashilhunpo. He spoke in mystical verses, quoted classical texts out of the blue&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 90–93.&lt;/ref&gt; and said he was [[Dromtönpa]], an earlier incarnation of the Dalai Lamas.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; When he saw monks from Tashilhunpo he greeted the disciples of the late Gendun Drup by name.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gelugpa elders had to break with tradition and recognised him as Gendun Drup's ''tulku''.&lt;ref name=mull956 /&gt;

He was then 8, but until his 12th year his father took him on his teachings and retreats, training him in all the family [[Nyingma]] lineages.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; At 12 he was installed at Tashilhunpo as Gendun Drup's incarnation, ordained, enthroned and renamed [[Gendun Gyatso Palzangpo]] (1475–1542).&lt;ref name=mull956 /&gt;

Tutored personally by the abbot he made rapid progress and from 1492 at 17 he was requested to teach all over Tsang, where thousands gathered to listen and give obeisance, including senior scholars and abbots.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 97–8.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1494, at 19, he met some opposition from the Tashilhunpo establishment when tensions arose over conflicts between advocates of the two types of succession, the traditional abbatial election through merit, and incarnation. Although he had served for some years as Tashilhunpo's abbot, he therefore moved to central Tibet, where he was invited to Drepung and where his reputation as a brilliant young teacher quickly grew.&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein 2006, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; He was accorded all the loyalty and devotion that Gendun Drup had earned and the Gelug school remained as united as ever.&lt;ref name=norb216 /&gt; This move had the effect of shifting central Gelug authority back to Lhasa. Under his leadership, the sect went on growing in size and influence&lt;ref name=norb217 /&gt; and with its appeal of simplicity, devotion and austerity its lamas were asked to mediate in disputes between other rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Snelling &amp; Richardson 1986, pp. 182–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gendun Gyatso's popularity in Ü-Tsang grew as he went on pilgrimage, travelling, teaching and studying from masters such as the adept Khedrup Norzang Gyatso in the Olklha mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 100–103.&lt;/ref&gt; He also stayed in [[Kongpo]] and Dagpo&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Dagpo (Region)]]&lt;/ref&gt; and became known all over Tibet.&lt;ref name="laird139" /&gt; He spent his winters in Lhasa, writing commentaries and the rest of the year travelling and teaching many thousands of monks and lay people.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1509 he moved to southern Tibet to build Chokorgyel Monastery near the 'Oracle Lake', [[Lhamo Latso]],&lt;ref name="laird139" /&gt; completing it by 1511.&lt;ref name=mull111&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; That year he saw visions in the lake and 'empowered' it to impart clues to help identify incarnate lamas. All Dalai Lamas from the 3rd on were found with the help of such visions granted to regents.&lt;ref name="laird139" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 107–9.&lt;/ref&gt; By now widely regarded as one of Tibet's greatest saints and scholars&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; he was invited back to Tashilhunpo. On his return in 1512, he was given the residence built for Gendun Drup, to be occupied later by the [[Panchen Lamas]].&lt;ref name=shak91 /&gt; He was made abbot of Tashilhunpo&lt;ref&gt;Stein 1972, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; and stayed there teaching in Tsang for 9 months.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gendun Gyatso continued to travel widely and teach while based at Tibet's largest monastery, Drepung and became known as 'Drepung Lama',&lt;ref name=norb217&gt;Norbu 1984, p. 217/&lt;/ref&gt; his fame and influence spreading all over Central Asia as the best students from hundreds of lesser monasteries in Asia were sent to Drepung for education.&lt;ref name=mull111 /&gt;

Throughout Gendun Gyatso's life, the Gelugpa were opposed and suppressed by older rivals, particularly the [[Karma Kagyu]] and their Ringpung clan patrons from Tsang, who felt threatened by their loss of influence.&lt;ref name=dhon456&gt;Dhondup 1984, pp. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1498 the Ringpung army captured Lhasa and banned the Gelugpa annual New Year [[Monlam Prayer Festival]]&lt;ref name=dhon456 /&gt; started by Tsongkhapa for world peace and prosperity.&lt;ref name=mull112&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Gendun Gyatso was promoted to abbot of Drepung in 1517&lt;ref name=mull111 /&gt; and that year Ringpung forces were forced to withdraw from Lhasa.&lt;ref name=dhon456 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa 1984, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Gendun Gyatso then went to the ''Gongma'' (King) [[Drakpa Jungne]]&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa 1984, pp. 89–92.&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain permission for the festival to be held again.&lt;ref name=mull112 /&gt; The next New Year, the ''Gongma'' was so impressed by Gendun Gyatso's performance leading the Festival that he sponsored construction of a large new residence for him at Drepung, 'a monastery within a monastery'.&lt;ref name=mull112 /&gt; It was called the [[Ganden Phodrang]], a name later adopted by the Tibetan Government,&lt;ref name=shak91 /&gt; and it served as home for Dalai Lamas until the Fifth moved to the [[Potala Palace]] in 1645.

In 1525, already abbot of Chokhorgyel, Drepung and Tashilhunpo, he was made abbot of Sera monastery as well, and seeing the number of monks was low he worked to increase it.&lt;ref name=mull113&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;
Based at Drepung in winter and Chokorgyel in summer, he spent his remaining years in composing commentaries, regional teaching tours, visiting Tashilhunpo from time to time and acting as abbot of these four great monasteries.&lt;ref name=mull113 /&gt; As abbot, he made Drepung the largest monastery in the whole of Tibet.&lt;ref name=sr183&gt;Snellgrove &amp; Richardson 1986, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; He attracted many students and disciples 'from Kashmir to China'&lt;ref name=mull113 /&gt; as well as major patrons and disciples such as ''Gongma'' Nangso Donyopa of Droda who built a monastery at Zhekar Dzong in his honour and invited him to name it and be its spiritual guide.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 114–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gongma'' Gyaltsen Palzangpo of Khyomorlung at Tolung and his Queen Sangyey Paldzomma also became his favourite devoted lay patrons and disciples in the 1530s and he visited their area to carry out rituals as 'he chose it for his next place of rebirth'.&lt;ref name=mull1137&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 113, 117.&lt;/ref&gt; He died in meditation at Drepung in 1547 at 67 and his reliquary stupa was constructed at Khyomorlung.&lt;ref name=mull120&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; It was said that, by the time he died, through his disciples and their students, his personal influence covered the whole of Buddhist Central Asia where 'there was nobody of any consequence who did not know of him'.&lt;ref name=mull120 /&gt;

=== 3rd Dalai Lama ===
The Third Dalai Lama, [[3rd Dalai Lama|Sonam Gyatso]] (1543–1588) was born in Tolung, near Lhasa,&lt;ref name=shak92&gt;Shakabpa 1984, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;
as predicted by his predecessor.&lt;ref name=mull1137 /&gt; Claiming he was Gendun Gyatso and readily recalling events from his previous life, he was recognised as the incarnation, named 'Sonam Gyatso' and installed at Drepung, where 'he quickly excelled his teachers in knowledge and wisdom and developed extraordinary powers'.&lt;ref&gt;Norbu 1986, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike his predecessors, he came from a noble family, connected with the [[Sakya]] and the [[Phagmo Drupa]] (Karma Kagyu affiliated) dynasties,&lt;ref name=sr183 /&gt; and it is to him that the effective conversion of Mongolia to Buddhism is due.&lt;ref name="bell33" /&gt;

A brilliant scholar and teacher,&lt;ref name=rich41&gt;Richardson 1984, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; he had the spiritual maturity to be made Abbot of Drepung,&lt;ref&gt;Dhondup 1984, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; taking responsibility for the material and spiritual well-being of Tibet's largest monastery at the age of nine. At 10 he led the [[Monlam Prayer Festival]], giving daily discourses to the assembly of all Gelugpa monks.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; His influence grew so quickly that soon the monks at Sera Monastery also made him their Abbot&lt;ref name="laird139" /&gt; and his mediation was being sought to prevent fighting between political power factions. At 16, in 1559, he was invited to [[Nêdong (village)|Nedong]] by King [[Ngawang Tashi Drakpa]], a [[Karma Kagyu]] supporter, and became his personal teacher. At 17, when fighting broke out in Lhasa between Gelug and Kagyu parties and efforts by local lamas to mediate failed, Sonam Gyatso negotiated a peaceful settlement. At 19, when the [[Lhasa River|Kyichu River]] burst its banks and flooded Lhasa, he led his followers to rescue victims and repair the dykes. He then instituted a custom whereby on the last day of [[Monlam]], all the monks would work on strengthening the flood defences.&lt;ref name=shak92 /&gt; Gradually, he was shaping himself into a national leader.&lt;ref&gt;Dhondup 1984, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; His popularity and renown became such that in 1564 when the Nedong King died, it was Sonam Gyatso at the age of 21 who was requested to lead his funeral rites, rather than his own Kagyu lamas.&lt;ref name=laird139 /&gt;

Required to travel and teach without respite after taking full ordination in 1565, he still maintained extensive meditation practices in the hours before dawn and again at the end of the day.&lt;ref name=mull142&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1569, at age 26, he went to Tashilhunpo to study the layout and administration of the monastery built by his predecessor Gendun Drup. Invited to become the Abbot he declined, already being Abbot of Drepung and Sera, but left his deputy there in his stead.&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa 1984, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; From there he visited [[Narthang Monastery|Narthang]], the first monastery of Gendun Drup and gave numerous discourses and offerings to the monks in gratitude.&lt;ref name=mull142 /&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Altan Khan]], chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders, had heard of Sonam Gyatso's spiritual prowess and repeatedly invited him to Mongolia.&lt;ref name=sr183 /&gt; By 1571, when Altan Khan received a title of Shunyi Wang (King) from the [[Ming dynasty]] of China&lt;ref name="Dardess2012_p16"&gt;{{cite book|author=John W.

Dardess|title=Ming China, 1368–1644: A Concise History of a Resilient Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ROQVzWT2iiUC&amp;pg=PA16|year=2012|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-1-4422-0491-1|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the second invitation, in 1577–78 Sonam Gyatso travelled 1,500 miles to Mongolia to see him. They met in an atmosphere of intense reverence and devotion&lt;ref name=sr184&gt;Snellgrove &amp; Richardson 1984, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; and their meeting resulted in the re-establishment of strong Tibet-Mongolia relations after a gap of 200 years.&lt;ref name=sr183 /&gt;
To Altan Khan, Sonam Gyatso identified himself as the incarnation of [[Drogön Chögyal Phagpa]], and Altan Khan as that of [[Kubilai Khan]], thus placing the Khan as heir to the [[Chingizid]] lineage whilst securing his patronage.&lt;ref name="Smith 1996, p. 106"&gt;Smith 1996, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;
Altan Khan and his followers quickly adopted Buddhism as their state religion, replacing the prohibited traditional [[Shamanism]].&lt;ref name=rich41 /&gt;
Mongol law was reformed to accord with Tibetan Buddhist law. From this time Buddhism spread rapidly across Mongolia&lt;ref name="Smith 1996, p. 106" /&gt; and soon the Gelugpa had won the spiritual allegiance of most of the Mongolian tribes.&lt;ref name=rich41 /&gt;
As proposed by Sonam Gyatso, Altan Khan sponsored the building of Thegchen Chonkhor Monastery at the site of Sonam Gyatso's open-air teachings given to the whole Mongol population. He also called Sonam Gyatso "Dalai", Mongolian for 'Gyatso' (Ocean).&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa 1984, pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Dalai Lama", by which the lineage later became known throughout the non-Tibetan world, was thus established and it was applied to the first two incarnations retrospectively.&lt;ref name=rich /&gt;

Returning eventually to Tibet by a roundabout route and invited to stay and teach all along the way, in 1580 Sonam Gyatso was in [[Hohhot]] [or [[Ningxia]]], not far from Beijing, when the Chinese Emperor invited him to his court.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1996, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shak96&gt;Shakabpa 1986, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
By then he had established a religious empire of such proportions that it was unsurprising the Emperor wanted to invite him and grant him a diploma.&lt;ref name=sr184 /&gt;
At the request of the Ningxia Governor he had been teaching large gatherings of people from [[East Turkestan]], Mongolia and nearby areas of China, with interpreters provided by the governor for each language. While there, a [[Ming]] court envoy came with gifts and a request to visit the [[Wanli Emperor]] but he declined having already agreed to visit Eastern Tibet next. Once there, in [[Kham]], he founded two more great Gelugpa monasteries, the first in 1580 at [[Lithang]] where he left his representative before going on to [[Chamdo Monastery]] where he resided and was made Abbot. Through Altan Khan, the 3rd Dalai Lama requested to pay tribute to the Emperor of China in order to raise his State Tutor ranking, the Ming imperial court of China agreed with the request.&lt;ref name="Wang尼玛坚赞1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jiawei Wang|author2=尼玛坚赞|title=The Historical Status of China's Tibet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ak3SQTVS7acC&amp;pg=PA44|year=1997|publisher=五洲传播出版社|isbn=978-7-80113-304-5|pages=44–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1582, he heard Altan Khan had died and invited by his son Dhüring Khan he decided to return to Mongolia. Passing through [[Amdo]], he founded a second great monastery, [[Kumbum Monastery|Kumbum]], at the birthplace of [[Tsongkhapa]] near [[Chinghai Lake|Kokonor]].&lt;ref name=shak96 /&gt; Further on, he was asked to adjudicate on border disputes between Mongolia and China. It was the first time a Dalai Lama had exercised such political authority.&lt;ref name=norb220&gt;Norbu 1986, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;
Arriving in Mongolia in 1585, he stayed 2 years with Dhüring Khan, teaching Buddhism to his people&lt;ref name=shak96 /&gt; and converting more Mongol princes and their tribes. Receiving a second invitation from the Emperor in Beijing he accepted, but died en route in 1588.&lt;ref name=Laird147&gt;Laird 2006, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a lifetime of only 45 years, his accomplishments were impressive and some of the most important ones were due to his relationship with Altan Khan.&lt;ref name=Laird147 /&gt; As he was dying, his Mongolian converts urged him not to leave them, as they needed his continuing religious leadership. He promised them he would be incarnated next in Mongolia, as a Mongolian.&lt;ref name=norb220 /&gt;

=== 4th Dalai Lama ===
The Fourth Dalai Lama, [[Yonten Gyatso]] (1589–1617) was a Mongolian, the great-grandson of [[Altan Khan]]&lt;ref name="Dardess2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=John W.

He studied at Drepung and became its abbot but being a non-Tibetan he met with opposition from some Tibetans, especially the Karma Kagyu who felt their position was threatened by these emerging events; there were several attempts to remove him from power.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 172–181.&lt;/ref&gt; Yonten Gyatso died at the age of 27 under suspicious circumstances and his chief attendant [[Sonam Rapten]] went on to discover the 5th Dalai Lama, became his ''chagdzo'' or manager and after 1642 he went on to be his regent, the Desi.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of the Fourth Dalai Lama in 1617 led to open conflict breaking out between various parties.&lt;ref name=TN2 /&gt; Firstly, the [[Tsangpa]] dynasty, rulers of Central Tibet from Shigatse, supporters of the [[Karmapa]] school and rivals to the [[Gelugpa]], forbade the search for his incarnation.&lt;ref name=SK&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Karmay, Samten C.|title=The Great Fifth|journal=The Newsletter|date=2005|volume=Winter 2005|issue=39|page=2|url=http://www.iias.nl/sites/default/files/IIAS_NL39_1213.pdf|accessdate=14 June 2015|series=Research|publisher=International Institute for Asian Studies|location=Leiden, the Netherlands|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1618 [[Sonam Rapten|Sonam Rabten]], the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the [[Ganden Phodrang]] treasurer, secretly identified the child,&lt;ref name=shak101&gt;Shakabpa 1984, pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt; who had been born to the noble Zahor family at Tagtse castle, south of Lhasa. Then, the [[Panchen Lama]], in Shigatse, negotiated the lifting of the ban, enabling the boy to be recognised as [[Lobsang Gyatso]], the 5th Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name=SK /&gt;

Also in 1618, the Tsangpa King, Karma Puntsok Namgyal, whose Mongol patron was [[Choghtu Khong Tayiji]] of the [[Khalkha Mongols]], attacked the Gelugpa in Lhasa to avenge an earlier snub and established two military bases there to control the monasteries and the city. This caused Sonam Rabten who became the 5th Dalai Lama's ''changdzo'' or manager,&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; to seek more active Mongol patronage and military assistance for the Gelugpa while the Fifth was still a boy.&lt;ref name=TN2 /&gt; So, in 1620, Mongol troops allied to the Gelugpa who had camped outside Lhasa suddenly attacked and destroyed the two Tsangpa camps and drove them out of Lhasa, enabling the Dalai Lama to be brought out of hiding and publicly enthroned there in 1622.&lt;ref name=shak101 /&gt;

In fact, throughout the 5th's minority, it was the influential and forceful Sonam Rabten who inspired the [[Dzungars|Dzungar Mongols]] to defend the Gelugpa by attacking their enemies. These enemies included other Mongol tribes who supported the Tsangpas, the Tsangpa themselves and their Bönpo allies in Kham who had also opposed and persecuted Gelugpas. Ultimately, this strategy led to the destruction of the Tsangpa dynasty, the defeat of the Karmapas and their other allies and the Bönpos, by armed forces from the Lhasa valley aided by their Mongol allies, paving the way for Gelugpa political and religious hegemony in Central Tibet.&lt;ref name=SK /&gt; Apparently by general consensus, by virtue of his position as the Dalai Lama's ''changdzo'' (chief attendant, minister), after the Dalai Lama became absolute ruler of Tibet in 1642 Sonam Rabten became the "''Desi''" or "Viceroy", in fact, the ''de facto'' regent or day-to-day ruler of Tibet's governmental affairs. During these years and for the rest of his life (he died in 1658), "there was little doubt that politically Sonam Chophel [Rabten] was more powerful than the Dalai Lama".&lt;ref name=GM199&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man, being 22 years his junior, the Dalai Lama addressed him reverentially as "''Zhalngo''", meaning "the Presence".&lt;ref&gt;Karmay 2014, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1630s Tibet was deeply entangled in rivalry, evolving power struggles and conflicts, not only between the Tibetan religious sects but also between the rising [[Manchu people|Manchus]] and the various rival [[Mongol]] and [[Oirats|Oirat]] factions, who were also vying for supremacy amongst themselves and on behalf of the religious sects they patronised.&lt;ref name=TN2 /&gt; For example, [[Ligdan Khan]] of the [[Chahars]], a Mongol subgroup who supported the Tsang Karmapas, after retreating from advancing Manchu armies headed for [[Qinghai|Kokonor]] intending destroy the [[Gelug]]. He died on the way, in 1634&lt;ref&gt;Michael Weiers, ''Geschichte der Mongolen'', Stuttgart 2004, p. 182f&lt;/ref&gt; but his vassal [[Choghtu Khong Tayiji]], continued to advance against the Gelugpas, even having his own son Arslan killed after Arslan changed sides, submitted to the Dalai Lama and become a Gelugpa monk.&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa 1984, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1630s, thanks again to the efforts of Sonam Rabten,&lt;ref name=SK /&gt; the [[5th Dalai Lama]] had found a powerful new patron in Güshi Khan of the [[Khoshut]] Mongols, a subgroup of the [[Dzungars]], who had recently migrated to the Kokonor area from [[Dzungaria]].&lt;ref name=TN2 /&gt; He attacked [[Choghtu Khong Tayiji]] at Kokonor in 1637 and defeated and killed him, thus eliminating the Tsangpa and the Karmapa's main Mongol patron and protector.&lt;ref name=TN2 /&gt;

Next, Donyo Dorje, the [[Bönpo]] king of Beri in [[Kham]] was found writing to the Tsangpa king in Shigatse to propose a co-ordinated 'pincer attack' on the Lhasa Gelugpa monasteries from east and west, seeking to utterly destroy them once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa 1984, pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt; The intercepted letter was sent to Güshi Khan who used it as a pretext to invade central Tibet in 1639 to attack them both, the Bönpo and the Tsangpa. By 1641 he had defeated Donyo Dorje and his allies in Kham and then he marched on Shigatse where after laying siege to their strongholds he defeated [[Karma Tenkyong]], broke the power of the Tsang Karma Kagyu in 1642 and ended the Tsangpa dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa 1967, p. 105–111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Güshi Khan's attack on the Tsangpa was made on the orders of [[Sonam Rapten]] while being publicly and robustly opposed by the Dalai Lama, who, as a matter of conscience, out of compassion and his vision of tolerance for other religious schools, refused to give permission for more warfare in his name after the defeat of the Beri king.&lt;ref name=GM199 /&gt;&lt;ref name=shak106&gt;Shakabpa 1984, p. 106–110.&lt;/ref&gt; Sonam Rabten deviously went behind his master's back to encourage Güshi Khan, to facilitate his plans and to ensure the attacks took place;&lt;ref name=SK /&gt; for this defiance of his master's wishes, Rabten was severely rebuked by the 5th Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name=shak106 /&gt;

After Desi [[Sonam Rapten]] died in 1658, the following year the 5th Dalai Lama appointed his younger brother [[Depa Norbu]] (aka Nangso Norbu) as his successor.&lt;ref&gt;Karmay 2014, p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; However after a few months, Norbu betrayed him and led a rebellion against the Ganden Phodrang Government. With his accomplices he seized Samdruptse fort at Shigatse and tried to raise a rebel army from Tsang and Bhutan, but the Dalai Lama skilfully foiled his plans without any fighting taking place and Norbu had to flee.&lt;ref&gt;Karmay 2014, pp. 409–425.&lt;/ref&gt; Four other Desis were appointed after Depa Norbu: Trinle Gyatso, Lozang Tutop, Lozang Jinpa and [[Sangye Gyatso]].&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa 2010, p. 1133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Re-unification of Tibet ====
Having thus defeated all the Gelugpa's rivals and resolved all regional and sectarian conflicts Güshi Khan became the undisputed patron of a unified Tibet and acted as a "Protector of the Gelug",&lt;ref&gt;René Grousset, ''The Empire of the Steppes'', New Brunswick 1970, p. 522.&lt;/ref&gt; establishing the [[Khoshut Khanate]] which covered almost the entire Tibetan plateau, an area corresponding roughly to '[[Greater Tibet]]' including [[Kham]] and [[Amdo]], as claimed by exiled groups (see maps). At an enthronement ceremony in Shigatse he conferred full sovereignty over Tibet on the Fifth Dalai Lama,&lt;ref name=bell273 /&gt; unified for the first time since the collapse of the Tibetan Empire exactly eight centuries earlier.&lt;ref name=TN2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TN3&gt;Smith 1997, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Güshi Khan then retired to [[Qinghai|Kokonor]] with his armies&lt;ref name=TN2 /&gt; and [according to Smith] ruled Amdo himself directly thus creating a precedent for the later separation of Amdo from the rest of Tibet.&lt;ref name=TN3 /&gt;

In this way, Güshi Khan established the Fifth Dalai Lama as the highest spiritual and political authority in Tibet. 'The Great Fifth' became the temporal ruler of Tibet in 1642 and from then on the rule of the Dalai Lama lineage over some, all or most of Tibet lasted with few breaks for the next 317 years, until 1959, when the [[14th Dalai Lama]] fled to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Buswell|Lopez|2014|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1645, the Great Fifth began the construction of the [[Potala Palace]] in Lhasa.&lt;ref name=mull201&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Güshi Khan died in 1655 and was succeeded by his descendants [[Dayan Khan (Khoshut)|Dayan]], [[Tenzin Dalai Khan]] and Tenzin Wangchuk Khan. However, Güshi Khan's other eight sons had settled in Amdo but fought amongst themselves over territory so the Fifth Dalai Lama sent governors to rule them in 1656 and 1659, thereby bringing [[Amdo]] and thus the whole of Greater Tibet under his personal rule and Gelugpa control. The Mongols in Amdo became absorbed and Tibetanised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Karmay, Samten C.|title=The Great Fifth|journal=The Newsletter|date=2005|volume=Winter 2005|issue=39|page=2|url=http://www.iias.nl/sites/default/files/IIAS_NL39_1213.pdf|accessdate=14 June 2015|series=Research|publisher=International Institute for Asian Studies|location=Leiden, the Netherlands|format=PDF|quote=Over time the region's Mongols were completely Tibetanized but continued to enjoy prestige among the Tibetans as Gushri Khan's descendants and played a significant role in the Gelug Order's expansion in Amdo.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Visit to Beijing ====
In 1636 the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] proclaimed their dynasty as the [[Qing dynasty]] and by 1644 they had completed [[Qing conquest of the Ming|their conquest of China]] under the [[prince regent]] [[Dorgon]]. The following year their forces approached [[Amdo]] on northern Tibet, causing the Oirat and Khoshut Mongols there to submit in 1647 and send tribute. In 1648, after quelling a rebellion of Tibetans of Kansu-Xining, the Qing invited the Fifth Dalai Lama to visit their court at Beijing since they wished to engender Tibetan influence in their dealings with the Mongols. The Qing were aware the Dalai Lama had extraordinary influence with the Mongols and saw relations with the Dalai Lama as a means to facilitate submission of the [[Khalka Mongols]], traditional patrons of the [[Karma Kagyu]] sect. Similarly, since the Tibetan Gelugpa were keen to revive a [[priest-patron]] relationship with the dominant power in China and Inner Asia, the Qing invitation was accepted. After five years of complex diplomatic negotiations about whether the emperor or his representatives should meet the Dalai Lama inside or outside the Great Wall, when the meeting would be astrologically favourable, how it would be conducted and so on, it eventually took place in Beijing in 1653. The Shunzhi Emperor was then 16 years old, having in the meantime ascended the throne in 1650 after the death of Dorgon. For the Qing, although the Dalai Lama was not required to [[kowtow]] to the emperor, who rose from his throne and advanced 30 feet to meet him, the significance of the visit was that of nominal political submission by the Dalai Lama since Inner Asian heads of state did not travel to meet each other but sent envoys. For Tibetan Buddhist historians however it was interpreted as the start of an era of independent rule of the Dalai Lamas, and of Qing patronage alongside that of the Mongols.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1997, pp. 108–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the 5th Dalai Lama returned, he was granted by the emperor of China a golden seal of authority and golden sheets with texts written in Manchurian, Tibetan and Chinese languages.&lt;ref name="陈庆英2005_p41"&gt;{{cite book |author=陈庆英 |title=达赖喇嘛转世及历史定制英 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=haMIsdC3iZwC&amp;pg=PA41 |year=2005 |publisher=五洲传播出版社 |ISBN = 978-7-5085-0745-3 |pages=41–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=K309&gt;Karmay 2014, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; The 5th Dalai Lama wanted to use the golden seal of authority right away.&lt;ref name="陈庆英2005_p41" /&gt; However, Lobzang Gyatsho noted that "The Tibetan version of the inscription of the seal was translated by a Mongolian translator but was not a good translation". After correction, it read: "The one who resides in the Western peaceful and virtuous paradise is unalterable Vajradhara, Ocen Lama, unifier of the doctrines of the Buddha for all beings under the sky". The words of the diploma ran: "Proclamation, to let all the people of the western hemisphere know".&lt;ref name=K309 /&gt; Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that based on the texts written on golden sheets, Dalai Lama was only a subordinate of the Emperor of China.&lt;ref name="王家伟尼玛坚赞1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=王家伟|author2=尼玛坚赞|title=中国西藏的历史地位|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eWCa0NSILSsC&amp;pg=PA38|year=1997|publisher=五洲传播出版社|isbn=978-7-80113-303-8|pages=38–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite such patronising attempts by Chinese officials and historians to symbolically show for the record that they held political influence over Tibet, the Tibetans themselves did not accept any such symbols imposed on them by the Chinese with this kind of motive. For example, concerning the above-mentioned 'golden seal', the Fifth Dalai Lama comments in ''Dukula'', his autobiography, on leaving China after this courtesy visit to the emperor in 1653, that "the emperor made his men bring a golden seal for me that had three vertical lines in three parallel scripts: Chinese, Mongolian and Tibetan". He also criticised the words carved on this gift as being faultily translated into Tibetan, writing that "The Tibetan version of the inscription of the seal was translated by a Mongol translator but was not a good translation".&lt;ref name=K309/&gt; Furthermore, when he arrived back in Tibet, he discarded the emperor's famous golden seal and made a new one for important state usage, writing in his autobiography: "Leaving out the Chinese characters that were on the seal given by the emperor, a new seal was carved for stamping documents that dealt with territorial issues. The first imprint of the seal was offered with prayers to the image of Lokeshvara ...".&lt;ref&gt;Karmay 2014, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relations with the Qing dynasty ====
The 17th-century struggles for domination between the Manchu-led Qing dynasty and the various Mongol groups spilled over to involve Tibet because of the Fifth Dalai Lama's strong influence over the Mongols as a result of their general adoption of Tibetan Buddhism and their consequent deep loyalty to the Dalai Lama as their guru. Until 1674, the Fifth Dalai Lama had mediated in [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Mongol]] affairs whenever they required him to do so, and the [[Kangxi Emperor]], who had succeeded the Shunzhi Emperor in 1661, would accept and confirm his decisions automatically. For the Kangxi Emperor however, the alliance between the Dzungar Mongols and the Tibetans was unsettling because he feared it had the potential to unite all the other Mongol tribes together against the Qing Empire, including those tribes who had already submitted. Therefore, in 1674, the Kangxi Emperor, annoyed by the Fifth's less than full cooperation in quelling a rebellion against the Qing in [[Yunnan]], ceased deferring to him as regards Mongol affairs and started dealing with them directly.&lt;ref name=TN6&gt;Smith 1997, pp. 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, 1674, the Dalai Lama, then at the height of his powers and conducting a foreign policy independent of the Qing, caused Mongol troops to occupy the border post of [[Dartsedo]] between Kham and Sichuan, further annoying the Kangxi Emperor who (according to Smith) already considered Tibet as part of the Qing Empire. It also increased Qing suspicion about Tibetan relations with the Mongol groups and led him to seek strategic opportunities to oppose and undermine Mongol influence in Tibet and eventually, within 50 years, to defeat the Mongols militarily and to establish the Qing as sole 'patrons and protectors' of Tibet in their place.&lt;ref name=TN6 /&gt;

==== Cultural development ====
The time of the Fifth Dalai Lama, who reigned from 1642 to 1682 and founded the government known as the [[Ganden Phodrang]], was a period of rich cultural development.&lt;ref&gt;Snellgrove &amp; Richardson 1968, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; His reign and that of [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]] are noteworthy for the upsurge in literary activity and of cultural and economic life that occurred. The same goes for the great increase in the number of foreign visitors thronging Lhasa during the period as well as for the number of inventions and institutions that are attributed to the 'Great Fifth', as the Tibetans refer to him.&lt;ref&gt;Stein 1972, p. 84–5.&lt;/ref&gt; The most dynamic and prolific of the early Dalai Lamas, he composed more literary works than all the other Dalai Lamas combined. Writing on a wide variety of subjects he is specially noted for his works on history, classical Indian poetry in Sanskrit and his biographies of notable personalities of his epoch, as well as his own two autobiographies, one spiritual in nature and the other political (see [[Dalai Lama#Further reading|Further Reading]]).&lt;ref name=mull83244&gt;Mullin 1983, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; He also taught and travelled extensively, reshaped the politics of Central Asia, unified Tibet, conceived and constructed the Potala Palace and is remembered for establishing systems of national medical care and education.&lt;ref name=mull83244 /&gt;

==== Death of the fifth Dalai Lama ====
The Fifth Dalai Lama died in 1682. Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that the written wills from the fifth Dalai Lama before he died explicitly said his title and authority were from the Emperor of China, and he was subordinate of the Emperor of China
.&lt;ref name="王家伟尼玛坚赞1997" /&gt;

The Fifth Dalai Lama's death in 1682 was kept secret for fifteen years by his regent [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]]. He pretended the Dalai Lama was in retreat and ruled on his behalf, secretly selecting the 6th Dalai Lama and presenting him as someone else. Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that Desi Sangye Gyatso wanted to consolidate his personal status and power by not reporting death of the fifth Dalai Lama to the Emperor of China, and also collude with the rebellion group of the Qing dynasty, Mongol [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] tribe in order to counter influence from another Mongol [[Khoshut]] tribe in Tibet. Being afraid of prosecution by the Kangxi Emperor of China, Desi Sangye Gyatso explained with fear and trepidation the reason behind his action to the Emperor. In 1705, Desi Sangye Gyatso was killed by [[Lha-bzang Khan]] of the Mongol [[Khoshut]] tribe because of his actions including his illegal action of selecting the 6th Dalai Lama. Since the Kangxi Emperor was not happy about Desi Sangye Gyatso's action of not reporting, the Emperor gave [[Lha-bzang Khan]] additional title and golden seal. The Kangxi Emperor also ordered [[Lha-bzang Khan]] to arrest the 6th Dalai Lama and send him to Beijing, the 6th Dalai Lama died when he was en route to Beijing.&lt;ref name="王家伟尼玛坚赞1997" /&gt; Journalist Thomas Laird argues that it was apparently done so that construction of the Potala Palace could be finished, and it was to prevent Tibet's neighbors, the Mongols and the Qing, from taking advantage of an interregnum in the succession of the Dalai Lamas.{{harv|Laird|2006|pp=181–182}}

=== 6th Dalai Lama ===
The [[6th Dalai Lama|Sixth Dalai Lama]] (1683–1706) was born near [[Tawang]], now in India, and picked out in 1685 but not enthroned until 1697 when the death of the Fifth was announced. After 16 years of study as a novice monk, in 1702 in his 20th year he rejected full ordination and gave up his monk's robes and monastic life, preferring the lifestyle of a layman.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 245–256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karenina Kollmar-Paulenz, ''Kleine Geschichte Tibets'', München 2006, pp. 109–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1703 Güshi Khan's ruling grandson Tenzin Wangchuk Khan was murdered by his brother [[Lha-bzang Khan|Lhazang Khan]] who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne, but unlike his four predecessors he started interfering directly in Tibetan affairs in Lhasa; he opposed the Fifth Dalai Lama's regent, [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]] for his deceptions and in the same year, with the support of the Kangxi Emperor, he forced him out of office. Then in 1705, he used the Sixth's escapades as an excuse to seize full control of Tibet. Most Tibetans, though, still supported their Dalai Lama despite his behaviour and deeply resented Lhazang Khan's intereference. When Lhazang was requested by the Tibetans to leave Lhasa politics to them and to retire to Kokonor like his predecessors, he quit the city, but only to gather his armies in order to return, capture Lhasa militarily and assume full political control of Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1997, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The regent was then murdered by Lhazang or his wife, and, in 1706 with the compliance of the Kangxi Emperor the Sixth Dalai Lama was deposed and arrested by Lhazang who considered him to be an imposter set up by the regent. [[Lhazang Khan]], now acting as the only outright foreign ruler that Tibet had ever had, then sent him to Beijing under escort to appear before the emperor but he died mysteriously on the way near [[Lake Qinghai]], ostensibly from illness.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 260–271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HarperCollins"&gt;Smith 1997, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having discredited and deposed the Sixth Dalai Lama, whom he considered an imposter, and having removed the regent, Lhazang Khan pressed the Lhasa Gelugpa lamas to endorse a new Dalai Lama in [[Tsangyang Gyatso]]'s place as the true incarnation of the Fifth. They eventually nominated one Pekar Dzinpa, a monk but also rumoured to be Lhazang's son,&lt;ref&gt;McKay 2003, p. 569.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lhazang had him installed as the 'real' Sixth Dalai Lama, endorsed by the [[Panchen Lama]] and named [[Yeshe Gyatso]] in 1707.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; This choice was in no way accepted by the Tibetan people, however, nor by Lhazang's princely Mongol rivals in Kokonor who resented his usurpation of the [[Khoshut]] Tibetan throne as well as his meddling in Tibetan affairs. The Kangxi Emperor concurred with them, after sending investigators, initially declining to recognise [[Yeshe Gyatso]]. He did recognise him in 1710, however, after sending a Qing official party to assist Lhazang in 'restoring order'; these were the first Chinese representatives of any sort to officiate in Tibet.&lt;ref name="HarperCollins" /&gt; At the same time, while this puppet 'Dalai Lama' had no political power, the Kangxi Emperor secured from Lhazang Khan in return for this support the promise of regular payments of tribute; this was the first time tribute had been paid to the Manchu by the Mongols in Tibet and the first overt acknowledgement of Qing supremacy over Mongol rule in Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1984, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kangxi Emperor ordered [[Lha-bzang Khan]] to arrest the 6th Dalai Lama and send him to Beijing. The 6th Dalai Lama died during the route to Beijing.&lt;ref name="王家伟尼玛坚赞1997" /&gt;

=== 7th Dalai Lama ===
In 1708, in accordance with an indication given by the [[6th Dalai Lama]] when quitting Lhasa a child called Kelzang Gyatso had been born at [[Lithang]] in eastern Tibet who was soon claimed by local Tibetans to be his incarnation. After going into hiding out of fear of Lhazang Khan, he was installed in Lithang monastery. Along with some of the Kokonor Mongol princes, rivals of Lhazang, in defiance of the situation in Lhasa the Tibetans of [[Kham]] duly recognised him as the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] in 1712, retaining his birth-name of [[Kelzang Gyatso]]. For security reasons he was moved to [[Derge]] monastery and eventually, in 1716, now also backed and sponsored by the Kangxi Emperor of China.&lt;ref name="Mullin 2001, p.276-281"&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 276–281.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tibetans asked Dzungars to bring a true Dalai Lama to Lhasa, but the Manchu Chinese did not want to release Kelsan Gyatso to the Mongol Dzungars. The Regent Taktse Shabdrung and Tibetan officials then wrote a letter to the Manchu Chinese Emperor that they recognized Kelsang Gyatso as the Dalai Lama. The Emperor then granted Kelsang Gyatso a golden seal of authority.&lt;ref name="Society"&gt;{{cite book|author=Western Shugden Society|title=A Great Deception: The Ruling Lamas' Policies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uySE2XJVq4C&amp;pg=PP161|publisher=Tharpa Publications US|isbn=978-0-9563918-8-9|pages=161–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sixth Dalai Lama was taken to Amdo at the age of 8 to be installed in [[Kumbum Monastery]] with great pomp and ceremony.&lt;ref name="Mullin 2001, p.276-281" /&gt;

According to Smith, the Kangxi Emperor now arranged to protect the child and keep him at Kumbum monastery in Amdo in reserve just in case his ally Lhasang Khan and his 'real' Sixth Dalai Lama, were overthrown.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1997, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mullin, however, the emperor's support came from genuine spiritual recognition and respect rather than being politically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dzungar invasion ====
In any case, the Kangxi Emperor took full advantage of having Kelzang Gyatso under Qing control at [[Kumbum]] after other Mongols from the [[Dzungars|Dzungar tribes]] led by [[Tsewang Rabtan]] who was related to his supposed ally [[Lhazang Khan]], deceived and betrayed the latter by invading Tibet and capturing Lhasa in 1717.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 285–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1997, pp. 123–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

These Dzungars, who were Buddhist, had supported the Fifth Dalai Lama and his regent. They were secretly petitioned by the Lhasa [[Gelugpa]] lamas to invade with their help in order to rid them of their foreign ruler Lhazang Khan and to replace the unpopular [[Yeshe Gyatso|Sixth Dalai Lama pretender]] with the young Kelzang Gyats. This plot suited the devious Dzungar leaders' ambitions and they were only too happy to oblige.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1997, pp. 122–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1717, after conspiring to undermine Lhazang Khan through treachery they entered Tibet from the northwest with a large army, sending a smaller force to [[Kumbum]] to collect Kelzang Gyatso and escort him to Lhasa. By the end of the year, with Tibetan connivance they had captured Lhasa, killed Lhazang and all his family and deposed [[Yeshe Gyatso]]. Their force sent to fetch Kelzang Gyatso however was intercepted and destroyed by Qing armies alerted by Lhazang. In Lhasa, the unruly Dzungar not only failed to produce the boy but also went on the rampage, looting and destroying the holy places, abusing the populace, killing hundreds of Nyingma monks, causing chaos and bloodshed and turning their Tibetan allies against them. The Tibetans were soon appealing to the Kangxi Emperor to rid them of the Dzungars.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1997, pp. 123–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 286–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Dzungars had first attacked, the weakened Lhazang sent word to the Qing for support and they quickly despatched two armies to assist, the first Chinese armies ever to enter Tibet, but they arrived too late. In 1718 they were halted not far from Lhasa to be defeated and then ruthlessly annihilated by the triumphant Dzungars in the [[Battle of the Salween River]].&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1984, pp. 48–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein 1972, p. 85"&gt;Stein 1972, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Enthronement in Lhasa ====
This humiliation only determined the Kangxi Emperor to expel the [[Dzungars]] from Tibet once and for all and he set about assembling and dispatching a much larger force to march on Lhasa, bringing the emperor's [[Trump (card games)#Metaphorical uses|trump card]] the young Kelzang Gyatso with it. On the imperial army's stately passage from [[Kumbum]] to Lhasa with the boy being welcomed adoringly at every stage, [[Khoshut]] Mongols and Tibetans were happy (and well paid) to join and swell its ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 287–9.&lt;/ref&gt; By the autumn of 1720 the marauding [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Mongols]] had been vanquished from Tibet and the Qing imperial forces had entered Lhasa triumphantly with the 12-year-old, acting as patrons of the Dalai Lama, liberators of Tibet, allies of the Tibetan anti-Dzungar forces led by [[Khangchenné|Kangchenas]] and [[Polhané Sönam Topgyé|Polhanas]], and allies of the [[Khoshut]] Mongol princes. The delighted Tibetans enthroned him as the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] at the [[Potala Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1997, pp. 124–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new Tibetan government was established consisting of a [[Kashag]] or cabinet of Tibetan ministers headed by [[Khangchenné|Kangchenas]]. Kelzang Gyatso, too young to participate in politics, studied Buddhism. He played a symbolic role in government, and, being profoundly revered by the Mongols, he exercised much influence with the Qing who now had now taken over Tibet's [[Priest-patron|patronage and protection]] from them.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1997, pp. 124–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Exile to Kham ====
Having vanquished the Dzungars, the Qing army withdrew leaving the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] as a political figurehead and only a [[Khalkha Mongol]] as the Qing ''[[amban]]'' or representative and a garrison in Lhasa.&lt;ref name="Mullin 2001, p.291"&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TN7&gt;Smith 1997, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Kangxi Emperor died in 1722 and was succeeded by his son, the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], these were also withdrawn, leaving the Tibetans [[Autonomous|to rule autonomously]] and showing the Qing were interested in an alliance, not conquest.&lt;ref name="Mullin 2001, p.291" /&gt;&lt;ref name=TN7 /&gt; In 1723, however, after brutally quelling a major rebellion by zealous Tibetan patriots and disgruntled [[Khoshut]] Mongols from Amdo who attacked [[Xining]], the Qing intervened again, splitting Tibet by putting [[Amdo]] and [[Kham]] under their own more direct control.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1997, pp. 125–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing Qing interference in [[Central Tibet]]an politics and religion incited an anti-Qing faction to quarrel with the Qing-sympathising Tibetan nobles in power in Lhasa, led by [[Khangchenné|Kanchenas]] who was supported by [[Pholhane|Polhanas]]. This led eventually to the murder of [[Khangchenné|Kanchenas]] in 1727 and a civil war that was resolved in 1728 with the canny [[Pholhane|Polhanas]], who had sent for Qing assistance, the victor. When the Qing forces did arrive they punished the losers and exiled the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] to Kham, under the pretence of sending him to Beijing, because his father had assisted the defeated, anti-Qing faction. He studied and taught Buddhism there for the next seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1997, pp. 129–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Return to Lhasa ====
In 1735 he was allowed back to Lhasa to study and teach, but still under strict control, being mistrusted by the Qing, while [[Polhané Sönam Topgyé|Polhanas]] ruled [[Central Tibet]] under nominal Qing supervision. Meanwhile, the Qing had promoted the [[Fifth Panchen Lama]] to be a rival leader and reinstated the ''ambans'' and the Lhasa garrison. Polhanas died in 1747 and was succeeded by his son [[Gyurme Namgyal]], the last dynastic ruler of Tibet, who was far less cooperative with the Qing. On the contrary, he built a Tibetan army and started conspiring with the Dzungars to rid Tibet of Qing influence.&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa 1967, pp. 147–8.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1750, when the ''ambans'' realised this, they invited him and personally assassinated him and then, despite the Dalai Lama's attempts to calm the angered populace a vengeful Tibetan mob assassinated the ''ambans'' in turn, along with most of their escort.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1997, p. 130–132.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Restoration as Tibet's political leader ====
The Qing sent yet another force 'to restore order' but when it arrived the situation had already been stabilised under the leadership of the [[7th Dalai Lama]] who was now seen to have demonstrated loyalty to the Qing. Just as Güshi Khan had done with the Fifth Dalai Lama, they therefore helped reconstitute the government with the Dalai Lama presiding over a [[Kashag]] of four Tibetans, reinvesting him with temporal power in addition to his already established spiritual leadership. This arrangement, with a Kashag under the Dalai Lama or his regent, outlasted the Qing dynasty which collapsed in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik 2011, p. 144; Shakabpa 1967, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ambans'' and their garrison were also reinstated to observe and to some extent supervise affairs, however, although their influence generally waned with the power of their empire which gradually declined after 1792 along with its influence over Tibet, a decline aided by a succession of corrupt or incompetent ''ambans''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1997, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there was soon no reason for the Qing to fear the [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]]; by the time the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] died in 1757 at the age of 49, the entire [[Dzungar people]] had been practically exterminated through years of genocidal campaigns by Qing armies, and deadly smallpox epidemics, with the survivors being forcibly transported into China. Their emptied lands were then awarded to other peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1997, p. 132–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mullin, despite living through such violent times Kelzang Gyatso was perhaps 'the most spiritually learned and accomplished of any Dalai Lama', his written works comprising several hundred titles including 'some of Tibet's finest spiritual literary achievements'.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 302, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, despite his apparent lack of zeal in politics, Kelzang Gyatso is credited with establishing in 1751 the reformed government of Tibet headed by the Dalai Lama, which continued over 200 years until the 1950s, and then in exile.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the [[Norbulingka]], the 'Summer Palace' of the Dalai Lamas in Lhasa was also started during Kelzang Gyatso's reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Suhasini Haidar|title=At Lhasa, Tibetans still pray for Dalai Lama's return|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/at-lhasa-tibetans-still-pray-for-dalai-lamas-return/article6367393.ece|accessdate=19 July 2015|publisher=The Hindu|date=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to The Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple and Norbulingka, Tibet|url=http://worldheritage.routes.travel/world-heritage-site/the-potala-palace-jokhang-temple-and-norbulingka-tibet/|publisher=World Heritage|accessdate=19 July 2015|quote=Norbulingka was built in the 1700s by the seventh Dalai Lama and served as the regular dwelling of future Dalai Lamas.

=== 8th Dalai Lama ===
The [[Eighth Dalai Lama]], Jamphel Gyatso was born in [[Ü-Tsang|Tsang]] in 1758 and died aged 46 having taken little part in Tibetan politics, mostly leaving temporal matters to his [[regents]] and the ''ambans''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1997, pp. 133, 137.&lt;/ref&gt; The 8th Dalai Lama was approved by the Emperor of China to be exempted from the lot-drawing ceremony of using Chinese [[Golden Urn]].&lt;ref name="陈庆英2005_106"&gt;{{cite book|author=陈庆英|title=达赖喇嘛转世及历史定制英|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haMIsdC3iZwC&amp;pg=PA106|year=2005|publisher=五洲传播出版社|isbn=978-7-5085-0745-3|pages=106–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang尼玛坚赞1997_p70"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jiawei Wang|author2=尼玛坚赞|title=The Historical Status of China's Tibet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ak3SQTVS7acC&amp;pg=PA70|year=1997|publisher=五洲传播出版社|isbn=978-7-80113-304-5|pages=70–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor of China [[Qianlong]] officially accept Gyiangbai as the 8th Dalai Lama when the 6th Panchen Erdeni came to congratulate the Emperor on his 70th birthday in 1780.

The Dalai Lama, his later generations and the local government cherished both the jade seal of authority, and the jade sheets of authority. They were properly preserved as the root to their ruling power.&lt;ref name="Wang尼玛坚赞1997_p62" /&gt;

Although the 8th Dalai Lama lived almost as long as the [[Seventh Dalai Lama|Seventh]] he was overshadowed by many contemporary lamas in terms of both religious and political accomplishment. According to Mullin, the [[Fourteenth Dalai Lama]] has pointed to certain indications that [[Jamphel Gyatso]] might not have been the incarnation of the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] but of Jamyang Chojey, a disciple of [[Tsongkhapa]] and founder of Drepung monastery who was also reputed to be an incarnation of [[Avalokiteshvara]]. In any case, he mainly lived a quiet and unassuming life as a devoted and studious monk, uninvolved in the kind of dramas that had surrounded his predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 323–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, [[Jamphel Gyatso]] was also said to possess all the signs of being the true incarnation of the [[Seventh Dalai Lama|Seventh]]. This was also claimed to have been confirmed by many portents clear to the Tibetans and so, in 1762, at the age of 5, he was duly enthroned as the [[Eighth Dalai Lama]] at the [[Potala Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 328–332.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 23 he was persuaded to assume the throne as ruler of Tibet with a [[Regent]] to assist him and after three years of this, when the Regent went to Beijing as ambassador in 1784, he continued to rule solo for a further four years. Feeling unsuited to worldly affairs, however, and unhappy in this role, he then retired from public office to concentrate on religious activities for his remaining 16 years until his death in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 333–4.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also credited with the construction of the [[Norbulingka]] 'Summer Palace' started by his predecessor in Lhasa and with ordaining some ten thousand monks in his efforts to foster monasticism.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001 pp. 338–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 9th to 12th Dalai Lamas ===
Hugh Richardson's summary of the period covering the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas:
{{quote|After him [the [[8th Dalai Lama]], Jamphel Gyatso], the [[9th Dalai Lama|9th]] and [[10th Dalai Lama]]s died before attaining their majority: one of them is credibly stated to have been murdered and strong suspicion attaches to the other. The [[11th Dalai Lama|11th]] and [[12th Dalai Lama|12th]] were each enthroned but died soon after being invested with power. For 113 years, therefore, supreme authority in Tibet was in the hands of a Lama Regent, except for about two years when a lay noble held office and for short periods of nominal rule by the 11th and 12th Dalai Lamas.{{efn|According to Mullin, Smith and Shakabpa however, the 12th Dalai Lama's Regent, Reting Rinpoche, was deposed in 1862 in a coup by Gyalpo Shetra and Tibet was ruled by despots or assemblies of abbots and ministers for the next eleven years, that is until 1873 when the 12th Dalai Lama assumed power.}}&lt;br /&gt;It has sometimes been suggested that this state of affairs was brought about by the Ambans—the Imperial Residents in Tibet—because it would be easier to control the Tibet through a Regent than when a Dalai Lama, with his absolute power, was at the head of the government. That is not true. The regular ebb and flow of events followed its set course. The Imperial Residents in Tibet, after the first flush of zeal in 1750, grew less and less interested and efficient. Tibet was, to them, exile from the urbanity and culture of Peking; and so far from dominating the Regents, the Ambans allowed themselves to be dominated. It was the ambition and greed for power of Tibetans that led to five successive Dalai Lamas being subjected to continuous tutelage. {{harv|Richardson|1984|pp=59–60}}}}

Thubten Jigme Norbu, the elder brother of the 14th Dalai Lama, described these unfortunate events as follows, although there are few, if any, indications that any of the four were said to be 'Chinese-appointed imposters':
{{quote|It is perhaps more than a coincidence that between the seventh and the thirteenth holders of that office, only one reached his majority. The eighth, Gyampal Gyatso, died when he was in his thirties, Lungtog Gyatso when he was eleven, Tsultrim Gyatso at eighteen, Khadrup Gyatso when he was eighteen also, and Krinla Gyatso at about the same age. The circumstances are such that it is very likely that some, if not all, were poisoned, either by loyal Tibetans for being Chinese-appointed impostors, or by the Chinese for not being properly manageable. Many Tibetans think that this was done at the time when the young [Dalai Lama] made his ritual visit to the Lake Lhamtso. ... Each of the four [Dalai Lamas] to die young expired shortly after his visit to the lake. Many said it was because they were not the true reincarnations, but imposters imposed by the Chinese. Others tell stories of how the cooks of the retinue, which in those days included many Chinese, were bribed to put poison in the [Dalai Lama's] food. The 13th [Dalai Lama] did not visit Lhamtso until he was 25 years old. He was adequately prepared by spiritual exercise and he also had faithful cooks. The Chinese were disappointed when he did not die like his predecessors, and he was to live long enough to give them much more cause for regret.{{harv|Norbu|Turnbull|1968|pp.=311–312}}{{efn|According to their biographies, the [[8th Dalai Lama|Eighth, Jamphel Gyatso]] lived to 46 years old, the [[9th Dalai Lama|Ninth, Lungtok Gyatso]] to 9 years, the [[10th Dalai Lama|Tenth, Tsultrim Gyatso]] to 21, the [[Khedrup Gyatso|Eleventh, Khedrup Gyatso]] to 17 and the [[Trinley Gyatso|Twelfth, Trinley Gyatso]] to 18.}}}}

According to Mullin, on the other hand, it is improbable that the [[Manchus]] would have murdered any of these four for being 'unmanageable' since it would have been in their best interests to have strong Dalai Lamas ruling in Lhasa, he argues, agreeing with [[Hugh Edward Richardson|Richardson]] that it was rather "the ambition and greed for power of Tibetans" that might have caused the Lamas' early deaths.{{efn|Considering what occurred in Lhasa after the Chinese ''ambans'' murdered [[Gyurme Namgyal]] in 1750, however, the Manchus would have been particularly reluctant to murder a Dalai Lama.}} Further, if Tibetan nobles murdered any of them, which is quite possible, it would more likely to have been in order to protect or enhance their personal family interests rather than out of suspicion that the Dalai Lamas were seen as Chinese-appointed imposters as suggested by Norbu. They could have also easily died from illnesses, possibly contracted from diseases to which they had no immunity, carried to Lhasa by the multitudes of pilgrims visiting him from nearby countries for personal blessings. Finally, from the Buddhist point of view, Mullin says, "Simply stated, these four Dalai Lamas died young because the world did not have enough good karma to deserve their presence".&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 343–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetan historian K. Dhondup, however, in his history ''The Water-Bird and Other Years'', based on the Tibetan minister Surkhang Sawang Chenmo's historical manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;Dhondup 1986, p. iv.&lt;/ref&gt; disagrees with Mullin's opinion that having strong Dalai Lamas in power in Tibet would have been in China's best interests. He notes that many historians are compelled to suspect Manchu foul play in these serial early deaths because the Ambans had such latitude to interfere; the Manchu, he says, "''to perpetuate their domination over Tibetan affairs, did not desire a Dalai Lama who will ascend the throne and become a strong and capable ruler over his own country and people''". The life and deeds of the 13th Dalai Lama [in successfully upholding ''de facto'' Tibetan independence from China from 1912 to 1950] serve as the living proof of this argument, he points out.&lt;ref&gt;Dhondup 1986, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This account also corresponds with TJ Norbu's observations above.

Finally, while acknowledging the possibility, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] himself doubts they were poisoned. He ascribes the probable cause of these early deaths to negligence, foolishness and lack of proper medical knowledge and attention. "''Even today''" he is quoted as saying, "''when people get sick, some [Tibetans] will say: 'Just do your prayers, you don't need medical treatment.'''"&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 9th Dalai Lama ====
Born in Kham in 1805/6 amidst the usual miraculous signs the [[9th Dalai Lama|Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso]] was appointed by the [[7th Panchen Lama]]'s search team at the age of two and enthroned in the Potala in 1808 at an impressive ceremony attended by representatives from China, Mongolia, Nepal and Bhutan.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 346–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa 1984, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain and Wang Jiawei point out that the 9th Dalai Lama was allowed to use the seal of authority given to the late 8th Dalai Lama by the Emperor of China&lt;ref name="Wang尼玛坚赞1997_p71"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jiawei Wang|author2=尼玛坚赞|title=The Historical Status of China's Tibet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ak3SQTVS7acC&amp;pg=PA71|year=1997|publisher=五洲传播出版社|isbn=978-7-80113-304-5|pages=71–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second Regent Demo Tulku was the biographer of the 8th and 9th Dalai Lamas and though the 9th died at the age of 9 his biography is as lengthy as those of many of the early Dalai Lamas.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793 under Manchu pressure Tibet had closed its borders to foreigners,&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa 1984, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1984, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1815 a British scientist, [[Thomas Manning (sinologist)|Thomas Manning]] became the first Englishman to visit Lhasa. Considered to be 'the first Chinese scholar in Europe'&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MNN790T|name=Manning, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; he stayed five months and gave enthusiastic accounts in his journal of his regular meetings with the Ninth Dalai Lama whom he found fascinating: “beautiful, elegant, refined, intelligent, and entirely self-possessed, even at the age of six.”&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, 349–351.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later in March 1815 the young Lungtok Gyatso caught a severe cold and, leaving the [[Potala Palace]] to preside over the New Year [[Monlam Prayer Festival]] he contracted pneumonia from which he soon died.&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa 1984, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 10th Dalai Lama ====
Like the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]], the [[10th Dalai Lama|Tenth, Tsultrim Gyatso]], was born in [[Lithang]], [[Kham]], where the Third Dalai Lama had built a monastery. It was 1816 and Regent Demo Tulku and the [[Seventh Panchen Lama]] followed indications from [[Nechung]], the 'state oracle' which led them to appoint him at the age of two. He passed all the tests and was brought to Lhasa but official recognition was delayed until 1822 when he was enthroned and ordained by the Seventh Panchen Lama. There are conflicting reports about whether the Chinese '[[Golden Urn]]' was utilised by drawing lots to choose him.&lt;ref name=S138&gt;Smith 1996, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; The 10th Dalai Lama mentioned in his biography that he was allowed to use the golden seal of authority based on the convention set up by the late Dalai Lama. At the investiture, decree of the Emperor of China was issued and read out.&lt;ref name="陈庆英2005_p85"&gt;{{cite book|author=陈庆英|title=达赖喇嘛转世及历史定制英|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haMIsdC3iZwC&amp;pg=PA85|year=2005|publisher=五洲传播出版社|isbn=978-7-5085-0745-3|pages=85–}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 15 years of intensive studies and failing health he died, in 1837, at the age of 20 or 21.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 353–360.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa 1984, pp. 174–6.&lt;/ref&gt; He identified with ordinary people rather than the court officials and often sat on his verandah in the sunshine with the office clerks. Intending to empower the common people he planned to institute political and economic reforms to share the nation's wealth more equitably. Over this period his health had deteriorated, the implication being that he may have suffered from slow poisoning by Tibetan aristocrats whose interests these reforms were threatening.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, 360.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also dissatisfied with his Regent and the [[Kashag]] and scolded them for not alleviating the condition of the common people, who had suffered much in small ongoing regional civil wars waged in [[Ch'inghai|Kokonor]] between Mongols, local Tibetans and the government over territory, and in [[Kham]] to extract unpaid taxes from rebellious Tibetan communities.&lt;ref name=S138 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa 1984, pp. 175–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 11th Dalai Lama ====
Born in Gathar, [[Kham]] in 1838 and soon discovered by the official search committee with the help of [[Nechung Oracle]], the [[11th Dalai Lama|Eleventh Dalai Lama]] was brought to Lhasa in 1841 and recognised, enthroned and named [[Khedrup Gyatso]] by the [[Panchen Lama]] in 1842, who also ordained him in 1846. After that he was immersed in religious studies under the Panchen Lama, amongst other great masters. Meanwhile, there were court intrigues and ongoing power struggles taking place between the various Lhasa factions, the Regent, the [[Kashag]], the powerful nobles and the abbots and monks of the three great monasteries. The Tsemonling Regent&lt;ref&gt;[http://treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Trichen-73-Ngawang-Jampel-Tsultrim-Gyatso/6979|The Second Tsemonling, Ngawang Jampel Tsultrim Gyatso]&lt;/ref&gt; became mistrusted and was forcibly deposed, there were machinations, plots, beatings and kidnappings of ministers and so forth, resulting at last in the Panchen Lama being appointed as interim Regent to keep the peace. Eventually the Third Reting Rinpoche was made Regent, and in 1855, Khedrup Gyatso, appearing to be an extremely promising prospect, was requested to take the reins of power at the age of 17. He was enthroned as ruler of Tibet in 1855&lt;ref name=M361-7&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 361–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=S176-81&gt;Shakabpa 1984, pp. 176–181.&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Xianfeng Emperor]]'s order.&lt;ref name="陈庆英2005_p91"&gt;{{cite book|author=陈庆英|title=达赖喇嘛转世及历史定制英|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haMIsdC3iZwC&amp;pg=PA91|year=2005|publisher=五洲传播出版社|isbn=978-7-5085-0745-3|pages=91–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died after just 11 months, no reason for his sudden and premature death being given in these accounts, Shakabpa and Mullin's histories both being based on untranslated Tibetan chronicles. The respected Reting Rinpoche was recalled once again to act as Regent and requested to lead the search for the next incarnation, the twelfth.&lt;ref name=M361-7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=S176-81 /&gt;

==== 12th Dalai Lama ====
In 1856 a child was born in south [[central Tibet]] amidst all the usual extraordinary signs. He came to the notice of the search team, was investigated, passed the traditional tests and was recognised as the [[12th Dalai Lama]] in 1858. The use of the Chinese [[Golden Urn]] at the insistence of the Regent, who was later accused of being a Chinese lackey, confirmed this choice to the satisfaction of all. Renamed [[Trinley Gyatso]] and enthroned in 1860 the boy underwent 13 years of intensive tutelage and training before stepping up to rule Tibet at the age of 17.&lt;ref name=M367&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 367–373.&lt;/ref&gt;

His minority seems a time of even deeper Lhasan political intrigue and power struggles than his predecessor's. By 1862 this led to a coup by Wangchuk Shetra, a minister whom the Regent had banished for conspiring against him. Shetra contrived to return, deposed the Regent, who fled to China, and seized power, appointing himself 'Desi' or Prime Minister.&lt;ref name=M367 /&gt; He then ruled with "absolute power" for three years,&lt;ref name=S188&gt;Shakabpa 1984, pp. 188–9.&lt;/ref&gt; quelling a major rebellion in northern Kham in 1863 and re-establishing Tibetan control over significant [[Qing]]-held territory there.&lt;ref name=Sm140&gt;Smith 1997, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Shetra died in 1864 and the [[Kashag]] re-assumed power. The retired 76th [[Ganden Tripa]], Khyenrab Wangchuk, was appointed as 'Regent' but his role was limited to supervising and mentoring Trinley Gyatso.&lt;ref name=M367 /&gt;&lt;ref name=S188 /&gt;

In 1868 Shetra's coup organiser, a semi-literate [[Ganden]] monk named Palden Dondrup, seized power by another coup and ruled as a cruel despot for three years, putting opponents to death by having them 'sewn into fresh animal skins and thrown in the river'.&lt;ref name=S188 /&gt; In 1871, at the request of officials outraged after Dondrup had done just that with one minister and imprisoned several others, he in turn was ousted and committed suicide after a counter-coup coordinated by the supposedly powerless 'Regent' Khyenrab Wangchuk.&lt;ref name=S188 /&gt; As a result of this action this venerable old Regent, who died the next year, is fondly remembered by Tibetans as saviour of the Dalai Lama and the nation. The Kashag and the Tsongdu or National Assembly were re-instated, and, presided over by a Dalai Lama or his Regent, ruled without further interruption until 1959.&lt;ref name=M367 /&gt;

According to Smith, however, during Trinley Gyatso's minority, the Regent was deposed in 1862 for abuse of authority and closeness with China, by an alliance of monks and officials called ''Gandre Drungche'' (Ganden and Drepung Monks Assembly); this body then ruled Tibet for ten years until dissolved, when a National Assembly of monks and officials called the ''Tsongdu'' was created and took over. Smith makes no mention of Shetra or Dondrup acting as usurpers and despots in this period.&lt;ref name=Sm140 /&gt;

In any case, Trinley Gyatso died within three years of assuming power. In 1873, at the age of 20 "he suddenly became ill and passed away".&lt;ref name=M367 /&gt; On the cause of his early death, accounts diverge. Mullin relates an interesting theory, based on cited Tibetan sources: out of concern for the monastic tradition, Trinley Gyatso chose to die and reincarnate as the [[13th Dalai Lama]], rather than taking the option of marrying a woman called Rigma Tsomo from Kokonor and leaving an heir to "oversee Tibet's future".&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, pp. 373–375.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakabpa on the other hand, without citing sources, notes that Trinley Gyatso was influenced and manipulated by two close acquaintances who were subsequently accused of having a hand in his fatal illness and imprisoned, tortured and exiled as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa 1984, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 13th Dalai Lama ===
[[File:Throne awaiting Dalai Lama's return. Summer residence Nechung. 1993.JPG|upright|thumb|Throne awaiting Dalai Lama's return. Summer residence of 14th Dalai Lama, [[Nechung]], Tibet.]]

The [[13th Dalai Lama]] assumed ruling power from the monasteries, which previously had great influence on the Regent, in 1895. Due to his two periods of exile in 1904–1909 to escape the British invasion of 1904, and from 1910 to 1912 to escape a Chinese invasion, he became well aware of the complexities of international politics and was the first Dalai Lama to become aware of the importance of foreign relations. After his return from exile in India and [[Sikkim]] during January 1913, he assumed control of foreign relations and dealt directly with the [[Maharaja]], with the British Political officer in Sikkim and with the king of [[Nepal]] – rather than letting the Kashag or parliament do it. {{harv|Sheel|1989|pp=24, 29}}

The Thirteenth issued a Declaration of Independence for his kingdom in [[Ü-Tsang]] from China during the summer of 1912 and standardised a Tibetan flag, though no other sovereign state recognized Tibetan independence. {{harv|Sheel|1989|p=20}} He expelled the [[amban]]s and all Chinese civilians in the country and instituted many measures to modernise Tibet. These included provisions to curb excessive demands on peasants for provisions by the monasteries and tax evasion by the nobles, setting up an independent police force, the abolition of the death penalty, extension of secular education, and the provision of electricity throughout the city of Lhasa in the 1920s. {{harv|Norbu|Turnbull|1968|pp=317–318}} He died in 1933.

The 14th Dalai Lama was not formally enthroned until 17 November 1950, during the [[Battle of Chamdo]] with the People's Republic of China. In 1951, the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government were pressured into accepting the [[Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet]] by which it became formally incorporated into the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, John.

With the aim of launching [[CIA Tibetan program|guerrilla operations against the Chinese]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] funded the Dalai Lama's administration with US$1.7&amp;nbsp;million a year in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/02/world/world-news-briefs-dalai-lama-group-says-it-got-money-from-cia.html|title= Dalai Lama Group Says It Got Money From C.I.A.|work= The New York Times|date= 1998-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the 14th Dalai Lama ceded his partial power over the government to an elected parliament of selected Tibetan exiles. His original goal was [[Tibetan independence movement|full independence for Tibet]], but by the late 1980s he was seeking high-level autonomy instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/JK27Ad01.html|title= Tibetans stick to the 'middle way'|first= Denis|last= Burke|date= 2008-11-27|accessdate= 2010-08-07|work= [[Asia Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to seek greater autonomy from China, but Dolma Gyari, deputy speaker of the parliament-in-exile, stated: "If the middle path fails in the short term, we will be forced to opt for complete independence or self-determination as per the UN charter".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-10-31/india/28072137_1_tawang-14th-dalai-lama-lhasa |archive-url = https://archive.is/20120721000952/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-10-31/india/28072137_1_tawang-14th-dalai-lama-lhasa |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 2012-07-21 |title = The burden of being Dalai Lama |first= Shobhan |last= Saxena |work= [[The Times of India]] |date= 2009-10-31 |accessdate= 2010-08-06 |quote="If the middle path fails in the short term, we will be forced to opt for complete independence or self-determination as per the UN charter"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 and 2016, he stated that Tibet wants to be part of China but China should let Tibet preserve its culture and script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dalai Lama says Tibet wants to remain part of China| url = http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/dalai-lama-says-tibet-wants-to-remain-part-of-china/1/341687.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = We want to stay within China: His Holiness the Dalai Lama of Tibet| url = http://www.thetibetpost.com/en/news/international/5282-we-want-to-stay-within-china-his-holiness-the-dalai-lama-of-tibet }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, he stated that "Europe belongs to the Europeans" and that Europe has a moral obligation to aid refugees whose lives are in peril. Further he stated that Europe should receive, help and educate refugees but ultimately they should return to develop their home countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20180912-dalai-lama-says-europe-belongs-europeans|title=Dalai Lama says 'Europe belongs to Europeans'|date=2018-09-12|work=France 24|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Residences ==
The 1st Dalai Lama was based at [[Tashi Lhunpo Monastery]], which he founded, the Second to the Fifth Dalai Lamas were mainly based at Drepung Monastery outside Lhasa. In 1645, after the unification of Tibet, the Fifth moved to the ruins of a royal fortress or residence on top of ''Marpori'' ('Red Mountain') in Lhasa and decided to build a palace on the same site. This ruined palace, called Tritse Marpo, was originally built around 636 AD by the founder of the [[Tibetan Empire]], [[Songtsen Gampo]] for his Nepalese wife.&lt;ref&gt;Shakabpa 1984, pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the ruins there was just a small temple left where [[Tsongkhapa]] had given a teaching when he arrived in Lhasa in the 1380s. The Fifth Dalai Lama began construction of the [[Potala Palace]] on this site in 1645,&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; carefully incorporating what was left of his predecessor's palace into its structure.&lt;ref name=mull201 /&gt; From then on and until today, unless on tour or in exile the Dalai Lamas have always spent their winters at the Potala Palace and their summers at the [[Norbulingka]] palace and park. Both palaces are in Lhasa and approximately 3&amp;nbsp;km apart.

Following the failed [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], the 14th Dalai Lama sought refuge in India. Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] allowed in the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government officials. The Dalai Lama has since lived in exile in [[McLeod Ganj]], in the Kangra district of [[Himachal Pradesh]] in northern India, where the [[Central Tibetan Administration]] is also established. His residence on the Temple Road in McLeod Ganj is called the Dalai Lama Temple and is visited by people from across the globe. Tibetan refugees have constructed and opened many schools and Buddhist temples in Dharamshala.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynrail.org/2008/04/express/dispatches-from-the-tibetan-front-dharamsala-india "Dispatches from the Tibetan Front: Dharamshala, India,"] Litia Perta, ''The Brooklyn Rail'', 4 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Searching for the reincarnation ==
[[File:DLHaus.jpg|thumb|The search for the 14th Dalai Lama took the High Lamas to [[Taktser]] in [[Amdo]]]]
[[File:Palden Lhamo, Tawang Monastery.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Palden Lhamo]], the female guardian spirit of the sacred lake, [[Lhamo La-tso]], who promised Gendun Drup the 1st Dalai Lama in one of his visions that "she would protect the 'reincarnation' lineage of the Dalai Lamas"]]

By the Himalayan tradition, ''[[phowa]]'' is the discipline that is believed to transfer the mindstream to the intended body. Upon the death of the Dalai Lama and consultation with the [[Nechung Oracle]], a search for the Lama's ''yangsi'', or [[reincarnation]], is conducted. Traditionally, it has been the responsibility of the High Lamas of the [[Gelug]]pa tradition and the Tibetan government to find a person accepted as his reincarnation. The process can take around two or three years to identify the Dalai Lama, and for the 14th, [[14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso]], it was four years before he was found. Historically, the search for the Dalai Lama has usually been limited to Tibet, though the third tulku was born in Mongolia. Tenzin Gyatso, however, has stated that he will not be reborn in the People's Republic of China, though he has also suggested he may not be reborn at all, suggesting the function of the Dalai Lama may be outdated.&lt;ref name="sdpcnw"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dalai Lama|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/people/dalailama_1.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-05-17|date=2006-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of the People's Republic of China has stated its intention to be the ultimate authority on the selection of the next Dalai Lama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=China's Tensions With Dalai Lama Spill into the Afterlife|author=Buckley, Chris|date=11 March 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/world/asia/chinas-tensions-with-dalai-lama-spill-into-the-afterlife.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Lamas used several ways in which they can increase the chances of finding a person they claim to be the reincarnation. High Lamas often visit [[Lhamo La-tso]], a lake in central Tibet, and watch for a sign from the lake itself. This may be either a claimed 'vision' or some 'indication' of the direction in which to search, and this was how Tenzin Gyatso was determined to be the next Dalai Lama.
It is said that [[Palden Lhamo]], the female guardian spirit of the sacred lake Lhamo La-tso promised Gendun Drup, the 1st Dalai Lama, in one of his visions "that she would protect the reincarnation lineage of the Dalai Lamas."&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since the time of Gendun Gyatso, the 2nd Dalai Lama, who formalised the system, the Regents and other monks have gone to the lake to seek guidance on choosing the next reincarnation through visions while meditating there.&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 139, 264–265.&lt;/ref&gt;

The particular form of Palden Lhamo at Lhamo La-tso is Gyelmo Maksorma, "The Victorious One who Turns Back Enemies". The lake is sometimes referred to as "Pelden Lhamo Kalideva", which has been taken as a reason to claim that Palden Lhamo is an emanation of the goddess [[Kali]], the [[shakti]] of the [[Hindu]] God [[Shiva]].&lt;ref&gt;Dowman 1988, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Lhamo Latso ... [is] a brilliant azure jewel set in a ring of grey mountains. The elevation and the surrounding peaks combine to give it a highly changeable climate, and the continuous passage of cloud and wind creates a constantly moving pattern on the surface of the waters. On that surface visions appear to those who seek them in the right frame of mind.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, Isabel. (1999). ''The Search for the Panchen Lama''. Viking Books. Reprint: Penguin Books. (2000), pp. 39–40. {{ISBN|0-14-024670-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was here that in 1935, the Regent [[Reting Rinpoche]] claimed to have received a clear vision of three Tibetan letters and of a monastery with a jade-green and gold roof, and a house with turquoise roof tiles, which led to the indication of Tenzin Gyatso, the [[14th Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref name="laird139" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norbu &amp; Turnbull 1968, pp. 228–230. Reprint: p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, Isabel. (1999). ''The Search for the Panchen Lama''. Viking Books. Reprint: Penguin Books. (2000), p. 42. {{ISBN|0-14-024670-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

High Lamas may also claim to have a vision by a dream or if the Dalai Lama was cremated, they will often monitor the direction of the smoke as an 'indication' of the direction of the expected rebirth.&lt;ref name="sdpcnw" /&gt;

Once the High Lamas have found the home and the boy they believe to be the reincarnation, the boy undergoes tests to ceremoniously legitimize the rebirth. They present a number of artifacts, only some of which belonged to the previous Dalai Lama, and if the boy chooses the items which belonged to the previous Dalai Lama, this is seen as a sign, in conjunction with all of the other claimed indications, that the boy is the reincarnation.&lt;ref name="artfcts"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Dalai Lama's Succession Rethink |url = http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1686573,00.html|publisher=Time World|accessdate=2013-04-06 |date=2007-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is only one boy found, the High Lamas will invite Living Buddhas of the three great monasteries, together with secular clergy and monk officials, to 'confirm their findings' and then report to the Central Government through the Minister of Tibet. Later, a group consisting of the three major servants of Dalai Lama, eminent officials,{{who|date=May 2013}} and troops{{which|date=May 2013}} will collect the boy and his family and travel to Lhasa, where the boy would be taken, usually to Drepung Monastery, to study the Buddhist sutra in preparation for assuming the role of spiritual leader of Tibet.&lt;ref name="sdpcnw" /&gt;

If there are several possible claimed reincarnations, however, regents, eminent officials, monks at the [[Jokhang]] in Lhasa, and the Minister to Tibet have historically decided on the individual by putting the boys' names inside an urn and drawing one lot in public if it was too difficult to judge the reincarnation initially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dalai Lama's confirmation of reincarnation|url=http://www.tibettravel.info/tibetan-buddhism/confirmation-of-reincarnation.html|publisher=Tibet Travel info|accessdate=2008-05-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331073155/http://www.tibettravel.info/tibetan-buddhism/confirmation-of-reincarnation.html|archivedate=2008-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been one non-recognised Dalai Lama, [[Yeshe Gyatso|Ngawang Yeshe Gyatso]], declared 28 June 1707, when he was 25 years old, by [[Lha-bzang Khan]] as the "true" 6th Dalai Lama – however, he was never accepted as such by the majority of the population.&lt;ref name="Stein 1972, p. 85" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[F.

{{quote|In the mid-1970s, Tenzin Gyatso, told a Polish newspaper that he thought he would be the last Dalai Lama. In a later interview published in the English language press he stated, "The Dalai Lama office was an institution created to benefit others. It is possible that it will soon have outlived its usefulness."&lt;ref&gt;[[Glenn H. Mullin]], "Faces of the Dalai Lama: Reflections on the Man and the Tradition," ''Quest'', vol. 6, no. 3, Autumn 1993, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; These statements caused a furore amongst Tibetans in India. Many could not believe that such an option could even be considered. It was further felt that it was not the Dalai Lama's decision to reincarnate. Rather, they felt that since the Dalai Lama is a national institution it was up to the people of Tibet to decide whether the Dalai Lama should reincarnate.&lt;ref&gt;Verhaegen 2002, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The government of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) has claimed the power to approve the naming of "high" reincarnations in Tibet, based on a precedent set by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China Says It Will Decide Who the Dalai Lama Shall Be Reincarnated As|url=http://time.com/3743742/dalai-lama-china-reincarnation-tibet-buddhism/|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=13 March 2015|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qianlong Emperor instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama and the [[Panchen Lama]] by a lottery that used a [[Golden Urn]] with names wrapped in clumps of barley. This method was used a few times for both positions during the 19th century, but eventually fell into disuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Murder in Tibet's High Places|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/murder-in-tibets-high-places-62805827|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=10 April 2012|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reincarnation|url=http://www.dalailama.com/messages/statement-of-his-holiness-the-fourteenth-dalai-lama-tenzin-gyatso-on-the-issue-of-his-reincarnation|publisher=[[14th Dalai Lama]]|date=24 September 2011|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the Dalai Lama chose to proceed with the selection of the [[11th Panchen Lama|11th reincarnation of the Panchen Lama]] without the use of the Golden Urn, while the Chinese government insisted that it must be used.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} This has led to two rival Panchen Lamas: [[Gyaincain Norbu]] as chosen by the Chinese government's process, and [[Gedhun Choekyi Nyima]] as chosen by the Dalai Lama.

In September 2007, the Chinese government said [[State Religious Affairs Bureau Order No. 5|all high monks must be approved by the government]], which would include the selection of the [[15th Dalai Lama]] after the death of [[14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso]].&lt;ref name="ChinaDaily"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reincarnation of living Buddha needs gov't approval|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-08/04/content_5448242.htm|website=China Daily|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramesh|first1=Randeep|last2=Watts|first2=Jonathan|title=Dalai Lama challenges China – with a referendum on reincarnation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/28/china.religion|website=The Guardian|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since by tradition, the Panchen Lama must approve the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, that is another possible method of control. Consequently, the Dalai Lama has alluded to the possibility of a referendum to determine the 15th Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

In response to this scenario, [[Tashi Wangdi]], the representative of the [[14th Dalai Lama]], replied that the Chinese government's selection would be meaningless. "You can't impose an [[Imam (Sunni Islam)|Imam]], an [[Archbishop]], saints, any religion...you can't politically impose these things on people," said Wangdi. "It has to be a decision of the followers of that tradition. The Chinese can use their political power: force. Again, it's meaningless. Like their Panchen Lama. And they can't keep their Panchen Lama in Tibet. They tried to bring him to his monastery many times but people would not see him. How can you have a religious leader like that?"&lt;ref&gt;[[n:Dalai Lama's representative talks about China, Tibet, Shugden and the next Dalai Lama|Interview with Tashi Wangdi]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', 14 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 14th Dalai Lama said as early as 1969 that it was for the Tibetans to decide whether the institution of the Dalai Lama "should continue or not".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.tibet.com/DL/next-reincarnation.html |publisher=Government of Tibet in Exile |title=Dalai's reincarnation will not be found under Chinese control |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712112849/http://www.tibet.com/DL/next-reincarnation.html |archivedate=12 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has given reference to a possible vote occurring in the future for all Tibetan Buddhists to decide whether they wish to recognize his rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22838048-25837,00.html Dalai Lama may forgo death before reincarnation], Jeremy Page, ''[[The Australian]]'', 29 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the possibility that the PRC might attempt to choose his successor, the Dalai Lama said he would not be reborn in a country controlled by the People's Republic of China or any other country which is not free.&lt;ref name="sdpcnw" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tibet.com/DL/next-reincarnation.html |publisher=Government of Tibet in Exile ex Indian Express July 6, 1999 |title=Dalai's reincarnation will not be found under Chinese control |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712112849/http://www.tibet.com/DL/next-reincarnation.html |archivedate=12 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Robert D. Kaplan]], this could mean that "the next Dalai Lama might come from the Tibetan cultural belt that stretches across northern [[India]], [[Nepal]], and [[Bhutan]], presumably making him even more pro-Indian and anti-Chinese".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2010-05-01/geography-chinese-power|title=The Geography of Chinese Power|first=Robert D.|last=Kaplan|date=1 May 2010|publisher=|issue=May/June 2010|via=www.foreignaffairs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 14th Dalai Lama supported the possibility that his next incarnation could be a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Haas|first1=Michaela|title=Why is there no female Dalai Lama?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/why-is-there-no-female-dalai-lama/2013/03/18/75ac132c-8fee-11e2-9cfd-36d6c9b5d7ad_story.html|accessdate=7 February 2017|date=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an "engaged Buddhist" the Dalai Lama has an appeal straddling cultures and political systems making him one of the most recognized and respected moral voices today.&lt;ref&gt;Puri, Bharati (2006) "Engaged Buddhism – The Dalai Lama's Worldview" New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; "Despite the complex historical, religious and political factors surrounding the selection of incarnate masters in the exiled Tibetan tradition, the Dalai Lama is open to change," author [[Michaela Haas]] writes.&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Michaela (2013).

== Early life and education==
Yazdi was born in [[Qazvin]] on 26 September 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Houchang E. Chehabi|title=Iranian Politics and Religious Modernism: The Liberation Movement of Iran Under the Shah and Khomeini|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JJEIQbUnGyYC&amp;pg=PA228|accessdate=27 August 2013|year=1990|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-85043-198-5|pages=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; He studied [[pharmacology]] at the [[University of Tehran]].&lt;ref name=gale&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/ibrahim-yazdi Ibrahim Yazdi] Gale Encyclopedia of the Mideast and N. Africa&lt;/ref&gt; Then he received a master's degree in philosophy again from the University of Tehran.&lt;ref name=tblade/&gt;

After the military coup of 1953, which deposed the government of [[Mohammad Mossadegh]], Yazdi joined the underground [[National Resistance Movement of Iran]], and was active in this organization from 1953 to 1960. This organization opposed to the Shah, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]. Yazdi traveled to the United States in 1961&lt;ref name=milw/&gt; to continue his education and in the US, continued his involvement in political activities against the Shah.

He was cofounder of the Freedom Movement of Iran, Abroad, along with [[Mostafa Chamran]], [[Ali Shariati]], and [[Sadegh Qotbzadeh]] in 1961. They were all part of the radical external wing of the group.&lt;ref name=disrel&gt;{{cite book|author1=Houchang Chehabi|author2=Rula Jurdi Abisaab|author3=Centre for Lebanese Studies (Great Britain)|title=Distant Relations: Iran and Lebanon in the Last 500 Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=elHww0W0ZO4C&amp;pg=PA182|accessdate=8 August 2013|date=2 April 2006|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-561-7|pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Yazdi, Chamran and Ghotbzadeh went to [[Egypt]] and met the authorities to establish an anti-Shah organization in the country, which was later called SAMA, special organization for unity and action.&lt;ref name=disrel/&gt; Chamran was chosen as its military head before returning to the US.&lt;ref name=disrel/&gt; In 1966, Yazdi moved headquarters of SAMA to [[Beirut]].&lt;ref name=disrel/&gt; In 1967, he enrolled at [[Baylor University]] and received a PhD in biochemistry.&lt;ref name=tblade/&gt;

In 1975, Yazdi was tried in absentia in an Iranian military court and condemned to ten years imprisonment, with orders issued for his arrest upon return to Iran. Because of his activities, he was unable to return to Iran and remained in the [[United States]] until July 1977.&lt;ref name=tblade/&gt; He became a naturalized US citizen in [[Houston]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=milw/&gt; When [[Ayatollah Khomenei]] moved to [[Neauphle-le-Château]] an [[Paris]]ian [[suburb]] from [[Iraq]] in 1978, Yazdi also went to Neauphle-le-Château and began to serve as an advisor to the Ayatollah.&lt;ref name=rubin80&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Barry|title=Paved with Good Intentions|year=1980|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|page=220|url=http://www.gloria-center.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Paved-with-Good-Intentions-final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also his spokesperson in Paris.&lt;ref name=milw&gt;{{cite news|title=Official of Iran is a US citizen|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aY5QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9BEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5463,2678524&amp;dq=ibrahim+yazdi&amp;hl=en|accessdate=13 August 2013|newspaper=The Milwaukee Sentinel|date=15 March 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and political activities==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2017}}
Yazdi worked as a research assistant of pathology and research instructor of pharmacology at [[Baylor College of Medicine]] in [[Houston]] until 1977.&lt;ref name=tblade&gt;{{cite news|title=Rescue leader at embassy was researcher at Baylor|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hXYUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iQIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5822,770549&amp;dq=ibrahim+yazdi&amp;hl=en|accessdate=13 August 2013|newspaper=Toledo Blade|date=14 February 1979|agency=AP|location=Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked at [[Veterans Administration Hospital|the Veterans Administration Hospital]] in [[Houston]].&lt;ref name=tblade/&gt; From 1961 to 1977, Yazdi founded the ''Muslim Students Association from the United States'' and later became a spokesman for Paris-based Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Ten Days That Changed Iran|url=https://www.ft.com/content/63d1affa-1620-11d9-b835-00000e2511c8|work=Financial Times | title=Interview with Ibrahim Yazdi, Iran Freedom Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bazargan-cabinet.jpg|thumb|left|Yazdi as part of [[Interim Government of Iran]]]]
In 1978, he joined Ayatollah Khomeini in [[Paris]] where the latter had been in exile and became one of his advisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zonis|first=Marvin|title=A Theory of Revolution From Accounts of  the Revolution|journal=World Politics|date=July 1983|volume=35|issue=4|pages=586–606|jstor=2010391|doi=10.2307/2010391}}&lt;/ref&gt; He translated the reports of Khomeini into English in a press conference on 3 February 1979 in Tehran.&lt;ref name=pbs2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Sahimi|first=Mohammad|title=The Ten Days That Changed Iran|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2010/02/fajr-10-days-that-changed-iran.html|accessdate=30 July 2013|work=PBS|date=3 February 2010|location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the deputy prime minister and [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Iran)|minister of foreign affairs]] in the [[Interim Government of Iran, 1979|interim government]] of [[Mehdi Bazargan]], until 6 November 1979.&lt;ref name=ard/&gt; Yazdi proposed to celebrate 'Jerusalem Day' and his suggestion was endorsed by Khomeini in August 1979.&lt;ref name=ard&gt;{{cite news|last=Ardalan|first=Siavash|title=Iran's 'Jerusalem Day': Behind the rallies and rhetoric|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23448932|accessdate=13 August 2013|work=BBC|date=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1980, he was appointed by Khomenei as head of the ''[[Kayhan]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Khomenei's hard-liners triumph|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19800512&amp;id=B1ZOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Re4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6991,6282811|accessdate=4 August 2013|newspaper=The Spokesman Review|date=May 1980|agency=AP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November 1979, the US embassy was [[Iran hostage crisis|taken over]] for a second time, this time by a group calling itself “[[Students Following the Line of the Imam]] (i.e. Ayatollah Khomeini)” and led by [[Mohammad Mousavi Khoeiniha]], who had closer ties to certain revolutionary leaders.

As before, Yazdi was asked to go to the embassy and resolve the crisis.  He asked and received permission of Khomeini to expel the occupiers, but shortly thereafter found out Khomeini had changed his mind&lt;ref&gt;Bowden, Guests of the Ayatollah, (2006) p. 93
&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared on state television openly endorsed the takeover of the embassy. The entire cabinet of [[Interim Government of Iran (1979)|the interim government]], including Yazdi and Prime Minister [[Mehdi Bazargan]], resigned in protest the next day.  They stated that they opposed the embassy takeover as “contrary to the national interest of Iran”.

The embassy takeover is considered to have been motivated in part by an internal struggle between various factions within the revolutionary leadership, with Yazdi and Bazargan on one side, and more radical clergy on the other. The embassy attackers, in subsequent statements indicated that one of their primary objectives in the takeover of the US embassy in November 1979 was to force the resignation of Yazdi, Bazargan, and the entire cabinet.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Among the areas of conflict between the two factions was the behavior of the Revolutionary Courts and the Revolutionary Committees.   Yazdi and Bazargan supported a general amnesty for all members of the Shah’s regime, provided that they cease to act against the revolution. They publicly opposed the secret trials and the summary executions carried out by the Revolutionary Courts, led by [[Ayatollah Sadegh Khalkhaali]].  Many sources however have documented that Yazdi was the main member of the revolutionary court that led the violence and execution. Bazargan and other members of the interim government may have called for fair and open trials for those in charge of political posts under the Shah. The radical clerics, on the other hand, stated that the rapid trials and executions were essential to protect the revolution.

After resignation from office, Yazdi and other members of the [[Freedom Movement of Iran]] ran in elections for the first post-revolutionary [[Islamic Consultative Assembly]] or parliament. Yazdi, Bazargan, and four other members of the Freedom Movement, namely [[Mostafa Chamran]], [[Ahmad Sadr]], [[Hashem Sabbaghian]], and [[Yadollah Sahabi]], were elected. They served at the parliament from 1980 to 1984.

After the Iraqi invasion of Iran in September 1980, Yazdi fully supported the Iranian war effort against the invasion, but opposed the continuation of the war after the Iranian victory in [[Liberation of Khorramshahr|Khorramshahr]] in 1982. The war continued for an additional six years. During these six years, Yazdi and others in the Freedom Movement issued several open letters to Ayatollah Khomeini opposing the continuation of the war. These letters and other public statements resulted in the firebombing of Yazdi’s residence in Tehran in 1985, and the arrest and imprisonment of several member of the Freedom Movement.

In subsequent elections in Iran for president, parliament, and city councils, Yazdi and other members of the Freedom Movement filed for candidacy but were barred from running by the [[Guardian Council]], because of their opposition to policies and actions of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Human Rights and Parliamentary Elections in the Islamic Republic of Iran|journal=Human Rights Watch|date=March 1996|volume=8|issue=1|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1996/Iran.htm|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1997, Yazdi was arrested on unknown charges and detained in Evin prison in Tehran. Even after his release, he was barred from leaving the country for many years, and summoned on a regular basis to answer questions before the revolutionary council, with his lawyer, Nobel Prize–winning Shirin Ebadi. As of 2008 Yazdi is still accused of “attempting to convert the rule of velaii (jurisprudence) into democratic rule.”

After the death of Bazargan in January 1995, Yazdi was elected as leader of Freedom Movement of Iran. Under pressure from the revolutionary court prosecutor, Yazdi offered his resignation as FMI Leader from on 20 March 2011 to the leadership council of the FMI.  They have yet to accept his resignation and Yazdi continues to function as the leader of the Freedom Movement of Iran.

Yazdi and several others were arrested on 1 October 2010 in Isfahan for participating in an "illegal Friday prayer." All others were freed within days. Ebrahim Yazdi remained in "temporary custody"—first in [[Evin prison]] and then in a "secure" facility under the control of Iran's security forces until March 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6725">'''Eleanor Ireland''' (7 August 1926 – ?) was an early British [[computer science]] pioneer and member of the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]]. 

==Early life==
Eleanor Ireland was born on 7 August 1926 in [[Berkhamsted]], [[Hertfordshire]], England.&lt;ref name=copeland477&gt;Copeland, p.477&lt;/ref&gt; She had one sibling, a brother, who was in the [[Royal Air Force]], and later worked for the  Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries as a statistician. Her father worked as a [[civil servant]]. Ireland attended [[Berkhamsted School]] for Girls from when she was ten, until she left at seventeen. At school, Ireland received distinctions in English language, English literature, French, and Biology. 

After she finished school, Ireland moved to London in hopes of studying architecture. Despite being accepted into Regent Street School of Architecture, she ultimately did not attend because of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;ELEANOR IRELAND: An Interview Conducted by Janet Abbate for the IEEE History Center, 23 April 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland believed it would be a waste of money to attend architecture school and risk being sent to war. She instead chose to work at a friend's philatelic shop on [[Chancery Lane]] until 1944. It was this year that she joined the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]].&lt;ref name="IEEE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ethw.org/Oral-History:Eleanor_Ireland |title=Eleanor Ireland, an oral history |last=Abbate |first=Janet |date=23 April 2001 | website= IEEE History Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Prior to World War II, Eleanor Ireland worked for a philatelist.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland volunteered for the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]] (WRNS) in the spring of 1944, and received a letter on August 2, 1944 that she was accepted into the WRNS.&lt;ref name=IEEE/&gt;  Once accepted into the Women's Royal Naval Service, Ireland was kept at [[Tullichewan Castle]], located near [[Loch Lomond]], Scotland. For the first portion of time she was with the WRNS completing lower level work such as cleaning and food preparation. Next, Ireland was transported to [[Bletchley Park]] and was informed she was a part of PV Special Duties X.&lt;ref name=EI&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ireland|first1=Eleanor|title=First-Hand:Bletchley Park, Station X – Memories of a Colossus Operator|url=http://ethw.org/First-Hand:Bletchley_Park,_Station_X_-_Memories_of_a_Colossus_Operator|website=Engineering and Technology History Wiki|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;  Like other women who wanted a job with the new machines, she had to score highly on a placement test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=GWOIXDsLQWwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=%22eleanor+ireland%22+bletchley&amp;ots=ViKnO3hbsj&amp;sig=9CnlqlESOKWmdaG4nIoYCHhVtqk|title=Recoding Gender: Women's Changing Participation in Computing|last=Abbate|first=Janet|date=2012-10-19|publisher=MIT Press|year=|isbn=9780262304535|location=|pages=21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work Ireland was involved with was top secret, and she, along with the other women she worked with, were told not to tell anyone any information regarding the work they were doing.

{{Theosophy}}
'''Geoffrey Hodson''' (12 March 1886 in [[Lincolnshire]]&lt;ref name=tos&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tos.theosophy.org.nz/about-geoffrey-hodson/geoffreyhodson/|title=Geoffrey Hodson Story|publisher=Theosophical Order of Service New Zealand}}, Retrieved 2013-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; – 23 January 1983 in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]) was an [[occultist]], [[Theosophist]], [[mysticism|mystic]], [[Liberal Catholic Church|Liberal Catholic]] priest, [[philosopher]] and [[esotericist]], and a leading light for over 70 years in the [[Theosophical Society]]. He was educated in [[England]].

==Biography==

According to Hodson, his occult experiences began when he was about five or six years old. He had dream experiences in the half waking state and this seemed to be connected with Kundalini. Kundalini is the power of life, one of the great forces. It is also known as the Serpent Fire.&lt;ref name=tos/&gt;

He served with distinction in the British Army as an Officer during the [[First World War]] as a tank commander,&lt;ref name=tos/&gt; which experience seems to have prompted him to spend his life attempting to eradicate the causes of wars and suffering through his teachings and insights. Following demobilisation he married Miss Jane Carter and he joined the YMCA Secretariat. It was around this time he met a Mrs Mary De La Middleton, who said that her own Master, the Master Rakoczy, had instructed her to show him how to awaken clairvoyance when required, focus it at different levels, project energies and heal others. It was at this stage Geoffrey Hodson with his wife toured Lancashire on his motorcycle and sidecar making detailed notes on the various types of fairies and nature spirits there. This culminated when he was on holiday in the beautiful valley of Sheepscombe. There they claimed that he and his wife studied the angelic kingdom and that he received teachings from a very highly evolved angel. This was the beginning of his work with the angelic kingdom. He wrote many books about his investigations there and the angelic teachings given him throughout his life.&lt;ref name=tos/&gt; Hodson was one of many (along with [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]) fooled by the [[Cottingley Fairies]] hoax

In 1937 he traveled to South Africa to stay with friends Mr and Mrs Quail and their daughter Ethelwynne, who was an artist. Under Hodson’s guidance she painted the illustrations for his book, The Kingdom of the Gods. Hodson then went to Australia to be with his wife Jane, who since 1929 had progressive paralysis due to multiple sclerosis. She died in 1962. He served there as president of the Blavatsky Lodge, and a Perth theosophist Miss Sandra Chase offered to take care of his wife. In 1940 he was invited by the New Zealand section to tour the main centres. While in New Zealand he became the founder and president of the New Zealand Vegetarian Society. He was also elected president of the Council of Combined Animal Welfare Organisations of New Zealand.&lt;ref name=tos/&gt;

He was the author over fifty books (many still in print) on [[psychic]] powers, [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]], [[mysticism]], [[fairies]], [[angels]], [[meditation]], [[clairvoyance]], health and disease.

He also wrote over two hundred articles and radio talks. He travelled the world extensively lecturing for the Theosophical Society.

Hodson also served as the Director of Studies of the School of the Wisdom at the International Headquarters of the Theosophical Society at Adyar, India, for four sessions, in 1953-54, then in 1954-1955 and again in 1961.&lt;ref name=tos/&gt; Hodson was a guest lecturer at the [[Krotona|Krotona School of Theosophy]] in [[Ojai, California]].

He was awarded the Subba Row Gold Medal in 1954 for his contributions to Theosophical Literature.&lt;ref name=tos/&gt;

He gave his last lecture, on 4 May 1982 at HPB Lodge in Auckland, aged 96, and eight months later he died in Auckland, on January 23, 1983.&lt;ref name=tos/&gt;

'''George Bent,''' also named '''''Ho—my-ike''''' in Cheyenne ([[Cheyenne people]], 1843 – May 19, 1918), was a Cheyenne who became a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldier during the [[American Civil War]] and waged war against Americans as a Cheyenne warrior afterward. He was the [[mixed-race]] son of [[Owl Woman]], daughter of a [[Cheyenne]] chief, and the American [[William Bent]], founder of the trading post named [[Bent's Fort]] and a trading partnership with his brothers and [[Ceran St. Vrain]]. Bent was born near present-day [[La Junta, Colorado]], and was reared among both his mother's people, his father and other European Americans at the fort, and other whites from the age of 10 while attending boarding school in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. He identified as Cheyenne.

After the [[Indian Wars]], Bent worked for the United States government as an interpreter. Starting in 1870 with the US Indian agent to the Cheyenne and [[Arapaho]], he lived on the reservation in present-day Oklahoma, where he stayed to the end of his life. Although a member of the Cheyenne because he was born to his mother's clan, in the tension of the postwar years Bent felt an outsider to both Cheyenne and whites because of his dual heritage. Some Cheyenne blamed him for losses to communal land suffered by the tribe when it was forced to accept allotment of lands to individual households under the [[Dawes Act]].

In the early twentieth century, Bent became an important source, or informant, for [[James Mooney]] and [[George Bird Grinnell]], [[anthropologists]] studying and recording Cheyenne culture, as he was bilingual and knew the culture well. Anxious to get a book on the Cheyenne completed, Bent encouraged Grinnell to work with [[George E. Hyde]], who probably wrote most of Grinnell's book ''The Fighting Cheyennes''. Through Bent's letters to him, Hyde wrote his biography: ''Life of George Bent: Written from His Letters.'' It was not published until 1968.

==Early life and education==
Bent was born at Bent's Fort, owned and operated by his father [[William Bent]], a major fur trader from [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. His mother was Owl Woman, daughter of a Cheyenne chief, and he was born into her clan under the [[matrilineal]] [[kinship]] system. Bent and his three siblings grew up speaking both [[Cheyenne language|Cheyenne]] and English at home. He learned much about Cheyenne culture from his mother and her family, and in their culture was considered Cheyenne.

She died about 1847, by which time his father had already taken her two younger sisters as secondary wives, in the Cheyenne traditional way of successful men. The youngest, Island, essentially reared Owl Woman's four children. Yellow Woman had a son by William Bent; Charles Bent, a half-brother to the others, was born in 1845. These two women had both left William Bent by 1867. He married the 20-year-old Adaline Harvey in 1869, the educated mixed-race daughter of a fur trader friend from Kansas City. Their daughter (George's half sister) was born after William Bent's death later that year.

When George was 10 years old, his father sent him to [[Kansas City, Missouri]] to an Episcopal boarding school for a European-American education.&lt;ref&gt;Halaas, Masich, pp. 65, 122&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the [[American Civil War]] began, Bent was a student at [[Webster University|Webster College]] near St. Louis.

==Military service==
Bent served in the [[Missouri State Guard]] with the [[Confederate Army]], fighting at the [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]] near Springfield, Missouri, on August 10, 1861; and at the [[First Battle of Lexington]] near Lexington, Missouri, on September 20, 1861; both were Confederate victories. As a member of the [[1st Missouri Cavalry Regiment (Confederate)|1st Missouri Cavalry Regiment]], he fought at the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] in [[Arkansas]], March 6–8, 1862, which was a Union victory. When the Missouri cavalry was converted to infantry, Bent became attached to Landis' Battery, Missouri Light Artillery, the [[horse artillery]] of General Mathew F. Greene's Missouri Brigade; this was part of General [[Sterling Price]]'s division. His artillery unit participated in the [[Siege of Corinth|siege]] and retreat from [[Corinth, Mississippi]], where it stayed behind to cover the retreat of 66,000 Confederates under the command of [[P.G.T. Beauregard]].

Later that summer, Bent either was captured or deserted. After his return to St. Louis, which was Union-controlled, he was briefly confined in the [[Gratiot Street Prison]], but was allowed to swear an oath of allegiance to the Union and be released. His guardian, [[Robert Campbell (frontiersman)|Robert Campbell]], a prominent St. Louis citizen assigned to him when George was in school, had eased his way.&lt;ref&gt;Halaas, David Fridtjof and Masich, Andrew E. ''Halfbreed: The Remarkable True Story Of George Bent'' Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press, 2005, pp. 82–91 {{ISBN|978-0-306-81320-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bent returned to his father's ranch in Colorado Territory, but anti-Confederate sentiment was intense there. For safety, he went to live with his maternal Cheyenne relatives.&lt;ref name=Faller3&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faller|first=Lincoln B.|date=Winter 2000|title=Making Medicine against 'White Man's Side of Story{{'-}}|journal=[[American Indian Quarterly]]|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|volume=24|issue=1|page=3|jstor=1185991}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that time on, Bent lived among the Cheyenne and identified with them.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, George E. (1967), ''Life of George Bent: Written from his Letters'', Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, p. 112 {{ISBN|978-0-8061-1577-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sand Creek and aftermath==
Bent was at [[Black Kettle]]'s camp of Cheyenne and [[Arapaho]] at [[Sand Creek Massacre|Sand Creek]] about 35 miles north of [[Lamar, Colorado]], on November 29, 1864. The Indians in the camp had initiated peace negotiations with the U.S. Army, and believed they were under its protection, but Colonel [[John Chivington]] and his force of 700 Colorado volunteers attacked the village. They killed about 150 Indians. Bent's brother Charles was nearly killed by the soldiers, but was rescued by friends. Jack Smith, another young [[mixed-race]] Cheyenne man, was killed in the soldiers' attack.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, pp. 149–159&lt;/ref&gt;

Bent was among the Indians who fled upstream and found shelter in sandpits dug in the creek bed beneath a high bank. Wounded in the hip, he was with about 100 survivors who crossed the plains to the Indian camps on the [[Smoky Hill River]].&lt;ref&gt;Halaas and Masich, pp. 143–145, 149-153&lt;/ref&gt; He was found there by his friend [[Edmund Guerrier]], who accompanied him back to the Bent Ranch at [[Big Timbers]], where Bent recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Halaas and Masich, pp. 155, 158–161&lt;/ref&gt; The Cheyenne and Arapaho planned revenge for the Sand Creek Massacre.

The Bent brothers and Charles' mother Yellow Woman joined the [[Dog Soldiers]] band. In January 1865, the young men rode with an Indian army of 1,000 warriors in a successful attack on [[Julesburg, Colorado]], in which they killed many townspeople and soldiers. (See [[Battle of Julesburg]]) Most of the Cheyenne went north to join [[Red Cloud]] on the [[Powder River (Montana)|Powder River]] in Wyoming. Before leaving the area, they burned many homesteads in the [[South Platte River]] valley. "At night the whole valley was lighted up with the flames of burning ranches and stage stations, but these places were soon destroyed and darkness fell on the valley."&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, pp. 165–181&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 1865, George Bent fought with Cheyennes, participating in the Battle of Mud Springs, and the Battle of Rush Creek, near present-day Broadwater, Nebraska, the Battle of Platte Bridge Station/Red Buttes on July 26, 1865, near present-day Casper, Wyoming, and the three-day Battle of Bone Pile Creek in August, near present-day Wright, Wyoming. In the summer, the U.S. Army sent the Powder River Expedition, under Brigadier General Patrick E. Connor into the Powder River Country to punish the Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho, with orders to kill all men and boys over the age of 12. On September 8, 1865, the Bents were camped with the Cheyenne's at the confluence of the Big and Little Powder Rivers, near present-day Broadus, Montana, when soldiers were sighted only a few miles away. The soldiers were the Eastern and Central columns of the Powder River Expedition under Colonel Nelson D. Cole, and Brevet Brigadier General Samuel Walker respectively. The Cheyennes led by Roman Nose, attacked the moving column to protect their village, in what  would later be called the Battle of Dry Creek/Ford, or Roman Nose's Fight, possibly preventing another Sand Creek Massacre.

Bent later wrote about this period, saying he believed that the "savages" in the conflict were the U.S. soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Faller, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Bent participated in 27 Cheyenne war parties, but never gave many details about his personal role in the Indian wars.&lt;ref name=H&amp;M291&gt;Halaas and Masich, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Dog Soldiers, including George's brother Charles, were killed in 1867, at the [[Battle of Summit Springs]] in Colorado.

==Interpreter==
Bent began his return to a peaceful world as an interpreter at the [[Medicine Lodge Treaty]] Council of October 1867. Bent impressed the U.S. soldiers and officials with his negotiating skills. Soon after, his brother Charles, a well-known and feared Cheyenne warrior, was killed in a skirmish with soldiers.

In 1868, Bent was hired by the U.S. government as an interpreter, first at [[Fort Larned National Historic Site|Fort Larned]] and later for the newly created Indian Agency headed by Brinton Darlington, the first US [[Indian Agent]] for the Cheyenne and Arapaho. In 1870, the Agency was located at [[El Reno, Oklahoma]]. Bent lived on the Cheyenne and Arapaho reservation near the town of [[Colony, Oklahoma|Colony]] and worked as a U.S. government employee for most of the rest of his life.

Because of his knowledge of both European-American and Cheyenne culture, Bent became a prominent and powerful person on the reservation. During the first several years, he tried to moderate hostilities between the two cultures. He learned that, as a [[half-breed]] or mixed-race man, he was an outsider to both.&lt;ref name=H&amp;M291 /&gt;
  
Bent developed a serious problem with [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] during this period. He became prosperous by assisting European-American cattlemen to obtain grazing leases on Indian land. Because of his influence peddling, he lost the trust of some Cheyenne and was fired as a U.S. interpreter. But in 1890, he was the crucial go-between to persuade the Cheyenne and Arapaho to accept plans for allotment of land by individual households under the [[Dawes Act]]. Presented as a way for Indians to assimilate by adopting Euro-American farming styles, the allotment plan caused the loss of considerable tribal land. The former communal tribal land was allocated to households of members, and any remaining land was declared "surplus" by the government, making it available for sale to non-Indian parties. Many Cheyenne and Arapaho held Bent responsible for the ill effects of the transition to allotments, including the loss of substantial amounts of tribal lands from the reservation. Allotment would have happened without Bent's assistance, but he was considered partially responsible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iltf.org/resources/land-tenure-history/allotment "History of Allotment"], Indian Land Tenure Foundation, retrieved July 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halaas and Masich, p.326&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Bent was married three times.  He first married Magpie (d. May 10, 1886), a daughter of Black Kettle of the Southern Cheyenne tribe. His other wives were Kiowa Woman (d. 1913) and Standing Out (d. 1945). With them Bent had a total of six children: Mary, William, Daisy, Lucy, George Jr., and Charlie.

==Cheyenne historian==
By 1901 Bent was at a low stage in his life. He had stopped drinking, but his influence with the Cheyenne was largely gone, as was his earlier prosperity. His meeting with the [[anthropologist]] [[George Bird Grinnell]] was beneficial for both. Grinnell realized that Bent, who spoke both Cheyenne and English, was literate, and could write passable English, would be invaluable for his research into Cheyenne culture. (Bent had been an informant of [[James Mooney]] earlier, but he had little respect for Mooney.)&lt;ref&gt;Halaas and Masich, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; Bent told Grinnell what he knew and arranged interviews with other Cheyenne for what he did not know.

He wanted the story of the Cheyenne told in a book. In Bent's opinion, Grinnell was too slow to finish his book about the Cheyenne. Bent began collaborating with the deaf, nearly blind, and reclusive [[George E. Hyde]]. Eventually, at Bent's recommendation, Hyde became a ghost writer for Grinnell and probably wrote most of ''The Fighting Cheyennes'', published in 1915. Grinnell mentioned Bent as a source in the book, but did not give him full credit for his assistance and contributions.&lt;ref&gt;Halaas and Masich, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Grinnell wrote ''The Cheyenne Indians: Their History and Lifeways'', in which he was more generous in crediting Bent. Cheyenne culture is unusually well described in Grinnell's books, thanks largely to Bent's insights and Hyde's writing.

Although the two never met, Hyde and Bent became close collaborators. Bent wrote 340 letters to Hyde between 1904 and 1918. From these letters, Hyde distilled a book, ''Life of George Bent: Written from His Letters''.&lt;ref name=Faller3/&gt; Hyde finished the book but, still unknown in the anthropological fraternity, he could not find a publisher. Hyde and Bent's collaboration is the principal source for the Cheyenne side of the wars of the 1860s and subsequent events.

Bent died on May 19, 1918, at [[Washita, Oklahoma]] in the [[1918 flu pandemic]].&lt;ref&gt;Halaas and Masich, p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, his dream of a well-written book about the history and culture of the Cheyenne was unrealized.

In 1968, George E. Hyde's book, ''Life of George Bent: Written from His Letters'' was published, and in 2005, David F. Halaas, and [[Andrew E. Masich]] published a book on George Bent, entitled ''Halfbreed: The Remarkable True Story of George Bent-- Caught Between the Worlds of the Indian and the White Man''.

{{nihongo|'''Son Gohan'''|孫 悟飯|||lead=yes}} is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] in the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' manga series, created by [[Akira Toriyama]]. Gohan is introduced as the first son of the protagonist [[Goku]], and his wife [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Chi-Chi|Chi-Chi]], in chapter #196 {{nihongo|''Kakarrot''|カカロット|Kakarotto}}, first published in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' magazine on October 8, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediaarts-db.jp/mg/magazines/322316 |title=週刊少年ジャンプ　1988/10/08　表示号数46 |website=Media Arts Database |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chi-Chi is a strict and protective mother to Gohan, forcing him to focus on his studies and forbidding him from practicing martial arts. However, due to the various threats to the Earth, she reluctantly allows him to fight, with him ultimately becoming one of the strongest characters in the series. Gohan has been well received by both fans and critics, the latter usually citing the character's growth from his initial appearance to his defeat of [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell]].

== Creation and design ==
Gohan's name comes from the Japanese word {{nihongo3|lit. "cooked rice" or "meal of any sort"|[[wikt:ご飯|ご飯]]|"gohan"}}, a continuation of the naming scheme of foods by Toriyama. Rice, being a grain, is not normally considered to be a vegetable, even though it is a common food. However, as the word "vegetable" is a culinary term, and not a botanical term, the name can also continue the naming scheme for Saiyan characters, which derives names from puns on vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedict.com/onldict/onldict.php Online English to Japanese Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209175026/http://www.freedict.com/onldict/onldict.php |date=2007-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conceptualizing for Gohan's character, Toriyama originally included glasses or a jacket to his apparel, and commonly, his hair is spiked up as seen in the final design.&lt;ref name = f&gt;''Dragon Ball Daizenshū'', book 4, ''Dragon Ball World Guide''&lt;/ref&gt; With the ending of the Cell arc, Gohan was meant to replace his father as the protagonist. However, Toriyama later decided against it, finding the character unsuited for the role in comparison to his father.&lt;ref name="creation"&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|title=DRAGON　BALL　大全集　➋ 「STORY　GUIDE」 |year=1995 |publisher=Shueisha |isbn=4-08-782752-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As opposed to full-blooded Saiyans, whose hair stays the same from birth,&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 16, chapter 181&lt;/ref&gt; Gohan's is drawn at varying lengths, and changes markedly in style. Initially, Gohan is illustrated garbed in a surcoat with kanji 孫, fixed on the front and the four-star Dragon Ball fitted on top of his hat. Piccolo later supplies him with a ''[[keikogi]]'' fashioned after Goku's, but substitutes the symbol with his own demon character "{{nihongo2|[[wikt:魔|魔]]|"ma"}}".&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 2, chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt; Normally thereafter, Gohan is drawn with a ''keikogi'' modeled after Piccolo's own. On Namek, Gohan is portrayed in battle armor worn by Freeza's henchmen, having been given it by Vegeta in preparation for their encounter with Freeza. Prior to his second fight with [[Majin Buu]], Gohan asks [[Kibito]] for an outfit resembling his father's, and is then drawn in a ''keikogi'' identical to Goku's. Gohan, from the alternate future, is dressed in a ''keikogi'' similar to that of his father's, and has a long scar across his left eye.

=== Abilities ===
Gohan possesses superhuman strength and durability,&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 23, chapter 277&lt;/ref&gt; as well as superhuman speed and reflexes, as seen during his training with his younger brother Goten. As a child, Gohan is depicted with an immense amount of hidden potential, which at first only revealed itself when he experienced fierce rage or distress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 1, chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 2, chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt; The vastness of this potential is shown consistently throughout the series as he ages and learns to master his powers from constant training and battles, the earliest example was during his short fight with Raditz.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Gohan's potential was unlocked twice in the series: first by the Namekian Grand Elder,&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 7, chapter 77&lt;/ref&gt; and then fully unlocked by Old Kaiō-shin,&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 25, chapter 294&lt;/ref&gt; which sees his power level rise to new heights, capable of easily overwhelming the seemingly invincible Majin Boo.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 25, chapter 303&lt;/ref&gt;

As a Half-Saiyan, he has the ability to become an Oozaru, a gigantic ape-like creature, by absorbing waves from a full moon. He lost this ability after his tail was cut by Piccolo,&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 2, chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt; and later Vegeta.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 4, chapter 46&lt;/ref&gt; He was the third youngest Saiyan to achieve the Super Saiyan transformation at the age of nine whilst training and surpassing his father Goku in the Room of Spirit and Time (hyperbolic time chamber)&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 16, chapter 188&lt;/ref&gt; and as a display of his hidden potential which he unlocked during his training with his father, Gohan becomes the first Saiyan in the series to become a Super Saiyan 2 during his battle against Cell. Though Gohan had gotten much weaker due to not training after the Cell Games, he became stronger than he ever has after his potential was unlocked from Old Kaiō-shin. Gohan with this power up was even stronger than Super Saiyan 3 Goku and Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks since he was able to dominate Super Buu with ease without transforming.

Ever since this fight, Gohan has given up on fighting and has continually gotten weaker to the point that he can't use his Super Saiyan transformations without straining himself. Gohan can still hold his own against Freeza's soldiers, Shisami, and Tagoma in his base form and overpower them when he transforms into a Super Saiyan. After Freeza's attack on Earth, Gohan returned to training with Piccolo. During his training with Piccolo before the start of the Tournament of Power, Gohan is pushed beyond his limits and manages to unlock his hidden power once again, becoming stronger than ever before.

Gohan has the ability to freely manipulate a life-force energy known as ''ki'' to fly using {{nihongo|''Bukū-jutsu''|舞空術||"Air Dance Technique"}},.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 6, chapters 61-62&lt;/ref&gt; He can also concentrate his ''ki'' to fire blasts of energy, such as the {{Nihongo|''Kamehameha''|かめはめ波||lit. "Turtle Destruction Wave"}} or the {{nihongo|''Masenko''|魔閃光|Masenkō|lit. "Demon Flash"}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 20, chapter 233&lt;/ref&gt; Gohan has displayed the use of his ki in a defensive manner, such as generating protective energy shields. Both as a child and an adult, Gohan is known to be a capable swordsman, as well as an adept teacher.

=== Voice actors ===
Gohan is voiced in the original Japanese anime and all other media by [[Masako Nozawa]]. Nozawa, who also voices Goku, revealed that she did not know she would be playing Gohan until receiving the script on the day of recording his debut episode. Despite having to voice Gohan, Goku, Goten and Bardock, Nozawa claims she is able to instantly get into the respective character simply upon seeing their image.

In Funimation and Saban Entertainment's initial 1996 English dub of Dragon Ball Z, Gohan is voiced by [[Saffron Henderson]]. Henderson reprised her role in AB Group and Westwood Media's alternate dub for the UK and Canadian markets in 2000. Jillian Michaels replaced Henderson in the later part of the Cell arc, while his adult version is voiced by [[Brad Swaile]]. Henderson believed her experience playing Goku in Dragon Ball made it simple to develop Gohan's voice, though stressed performing as him was "tiring" due to the action of the series requiring louder volumes. She also remembered scheduling conflicts thanks to her wedding, setting the stage for the studio to audition other voice actors for the part of Gohan, and being disappointed at the role being recast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Saffron Henderson|url=http://www.myfavoritegames.com/dragonball-z/Info/Interviews/Interviews-SaffronHenderson.htm/|website=www.myfavoritegames.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Funimation's in-house dub, Gohan's child incarnation is voiced by [[Stephanie Nadolny]] for various media until 2010 and [[Colleen Clinkenbeard]] for ''Dragon Ball Kai'' and later media while his adult incarnation is voiced by [[Kyle Hebert]] for almost all various media and [[Dameon Clarke]] as "Future Gohan" for some episodes and the ''[[History of Trunks]]'' TV special. Nadolny was called in to audition in 1999, when the English dub of ''Dragon Ball Z'' was recast. She said her most challenging time voicing the character was during his fight against Cell where she had to make him sound as "deep, tough and as much like a man as possible." Nadolny's voice was strained during the recordings, causing her to sometimes leave the studio in pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Divers|first1=Allen|title="Interview with Stephanie Nadolny"|website=Mania.com|accessdate=6 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hebert said that his roles as Gohan and the narrator of ''Dragon Ball Z'' are close to him as they kickstarted his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=K|first1=Luke|title="Kyle Hebert: MCM Expo 2010 interview"|website=criticalgamer.co|accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also found ''Battle of Gods'' to be "genuinely touching" outside of its fighting, citing Gohan finding out that he was going to be a father among the moments he found sentimental and was happy to return to the franchise when reprising his role in ''Resurrection 'F''', also expressing interest in redoing his lines in Dragon Ball Kai as he had more experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Jeffrey|title=Pop Geeks Interviews Voice Actor Kyle Hebert-Pop Geeks|url=https://popgeeks.net/pop-geeks-interviews-voice-actor-kyle-hebert/|website=Pop Geeks|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English dub of the video game ''[[Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout]]'', Gohan is voiced by [[Lex Lang]]. In the English dub of Dragon Ball GT produced by Blue Water Studios distributed in Canada, he was voiced by Scott Roberts. In the English dub of movies distributed in Europe by [[AB Groupe]], Gohan was voiced by Jodi Forrest, with [[David Gasman]] voicing Gohan as an adult in ''The History of Trunks''. In the Toonami Asia dub produced by [[Bang Zoom! Entertainment]] of ''Dragon Ball Super'', Gohan here is voiced by Chris Hackney. In a rare English dub of the anime produced in the Philippines by Creative Products Corporation, Gohan was voiced by Ethel Lizano who also directed that dub. In the 1996 dub of the double feature combining ''[[Cooler's Revenge]]'' and ''[[The Return of Cooler]]'', Lizano was replaced with E.J. Galang, who was 12 years old at the time he voiced Gohan.

== Appearances ==

=== In ''Dragon Ball'' ===
Gohan is introduced as the five year-old son of the series protagonist [[Goku]], named after his [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Grandpa Son Gohan|adoptive great-grandfather]]. Described as well-mannered and reserved,&lt;ref name = b&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira|author-link= Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2003 |chapter=Chapter 2| volume = 1 | isbn = 978-1-56931-930-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = c&gt;''Dragon Ball Daizenshū'', book 2, ''Story Guide''&lt;/ref&gt; Gohan's story begins following his abduction by the extraterrestrial Saiyan named [[List of Saiyans in Dragon Ball#Raditz|Raditz]], who is also his uncle. While Goku is pinned to the ground, Gohan's extreme distress explodes with the release of his dormant power, which allows him to injure Raditz. [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]] then takes Gohan away following the fight and Goku's death, and trains him for the upcoming battle against the two other Saiyans, [[Vegeta]] and [[List of Saiyans in Dragon Ball#Nappa|Nappa]], though Piccolo is aware that training the son of his greatest enemy will be a risk.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 2, chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt; His tutelage under Piccolo forms a deep bond between the two characters, with Piccolo ultimately sacrificing himself to save Gohan during their fight with Nappa.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball'' Z manga, volume 3, chapter 29&lt;/ref&gt; After Vegeta's defeat, Gohan travels with [[Bulma]] and [[Krillin]] to planet Namek to use the Dragon Balls there, as the Dragon Balls on Earth had turned to stone due to the Earth's god [[Kami (Dragon Ball)|Kami]]'s death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira| author-link = Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2003 | volume = 5| isbn = 978-1-56931-934-5|chapter=Chapter 51}}&lt;/ref&gt; After succeeding in gathering the Dragon Balls, Gohan and the others wish Piccolo back to life, causing Kami and the Dragon Balls to be returned. Gohan, along with Krillin and Vegeta, are then forced into an encounter with [[Frieza]], who seeks the Dragon Balls for immortality. Shortly after the fight with Freeza begins, Krillin is impaled by one of Freeza's horns. Freeza stops Gohan as he tries to save Krillin, who has now been thrown into the ocean below, and he mocks him, saying it is pointless to try to save his friend since he and Vegeta are both about to die. Gohan is extremely angered by being unable to save Krillin and attacks Freeza without hesitation. He manages to knock Freeza into a small island below, and then he blasts him with a series of energy blasts before ending the attack with a ''Masenko''.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 9, chapter 103&lt;/ref&gt; Later on in the fight, as Piccolo is getting repeatedly blasted from Freeza, who is now in his third form, Gohan blasts Freeza with another ''Masenko'', and once again pushes him back with it. Freeza is able to send it back at Gohan without taking any damage, but he is once again shocked that a child could produce such an attack. Shortly after this, Freeza transforms into his original and most powerful form. Once he does this he immediately kills [[Dende (Dragon Ball)|Dende]], a young Namekian who had been secretly healing Gohan, Krillin, Piccolo and Vegeta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira|author-link= Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2003 |chapter=Chapter 108| volume = 10 | isbn = 978-1569319390}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gohan is outraged by this and unleashes all of his power against Freeza. However, he is unable to land even a single blow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira|author-link= Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2003 |chapter=Chapter 109| volume = 10 | isbn = 978-1569319390}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan and defeats Freeza, the planet Namek explodes and Goku escapes while Freeza is left with serious injuries, Freeza is found in space by his father (King Cold) and is turned into a cyborg. Gohan is shown to settle back into school life on Earth, waiting for Goku to return home from Namek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira|author-link= Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2003 |chapter=Chapter 135| volume = 12 | isbn = 978-1569319857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gohan Lithograph.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Gohan in the anime adaptation.]]
After [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]] kills Freeza and his father King Cold then tells Goku about the Androids,&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 12, chapter 138&lt;/ref&gt; Gohan goes into the wilderness with Goku and Piccolo to train for the upcoming threat.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 12, chapter 142&lt;/ref&gt; After Vegeta kills [[List of Saiyans in Dragon Ball#Android 19|Android #19]],&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 13, chapter 150&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dr. Gero]] (Android #20) activate Androids [[Android 17|#17]] and [[Android 18|#18]],&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 13, chapter 155&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell]] is discovered,&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 14, chapter 167&lt;/ref&gt; Gohan enters the Room of Spirit and Time with Goku where they train for 1 year (1 day on earth, however in their case according to Mr. Popo, Goku and Gohan still had 3 hours left in the room, but they came out having finished their training earlier than expected). Gohan makes the jump to Super Saiyan while he is in the chamber and after they emerge, both Goku and Gohan retain the physical characteristics of a Super Saiyan without any of the drawbacks of its form (increased aggression, energy loss, etc.). After Goku initially fights Cell but realizes later that he cannot defeat him, Gohan is called to fight to the surprise of everyone else and Cell. During the fight, Gohan asks Cell to stop the Cell Games tournament and then he tells him about his power. Cell, instead of heeding Gohan's warning, attacks him in an effort to force Gohan to show his true power. Gohan holds his own for a while until Cell becomes impatient and bored.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 18, chapter 212&lt;/ref&gt; He releases Cell Juniors on the other fighters to provoke Gohan from attacking. After [[Android 16|Android #16]] is murdered by Cell, Gohan unleashes his rage and transforms into a Super Saiyan 2.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 18, chapter 213&lt;/ref&gt; Gohan easily defeats the Cell Juniors and proceeds to toy with Cell, now that he has a much greater power level. This backfires, however; he waits too long to finish Cell, who decides to self-destruct when transformed back to his semi-perfect form, as a last-ditch effort to destroy Gohan and the Earth. Goku, in an act of self-sacrifice, uses teleportation to take Cell to [[Kaio-sama]]'s planet. Thinking Cell dead, the fighters lower their guard only to be surprised by a blast that kills Trunks. Cell returns, having regenerated from a single Cell that survived the blast, and also adopted the instant transmission technique. Right before Cell is about to finish Vegeta, Gohan intercedes which costs him the use of his left arm.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 18, chapter 220&lt;/ref&gt; As Cell charges up one final ''Kamehameha'' wave to finish the Earth, Gohan hears the voice of his father who gives him the resolve he needs to defeat Cell. They both launch large ''Kamehameha'' waves at each other, which initiates a power struggle.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 18, chapter 221&lt;/ref&gt; Cell is about to overcome Gohan when Vegeta uses his remaining energy to blast Cell, which distracts him for a moment. Gohan uses this moment to unleash all his fury into his attack, which causes it to overpower Cell's. It hits Cell full-force which disintegrates all his cells, finally killing him.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 18, chapter 222&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gohan of the alternate timeline, referred to as "Future Gohan", to distinguish him from the character's present-timeline incarnation, is presented in the volume #33 [[sidestory]] of the original manga, ''Trunks the Story'', in which he is shown to be the only surviving fighter; the others have all died at the hands of the androids (sans Goku due to having died from a heart virus prior to androids' arrival).&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 17, chapter 140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 17, chapter 141&lt;/ref&gt; Gohan is shown training Trunks to assist him in battling Androids #17 and #18. In this timeline, Gohan has become a Super Saiyan and is depicted wearing a uniform similar to his father's, one with his own [[kanji]] symbol on the back, ''Han'', {{nihongo2|[[wikt:飯|飯]]}}. Gohan states he wears it in hopes of becoming as strong as his father one day, and is mentioned that he bears a striking resemblance to Goku when donning it.&lt;ref name = g&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 17, ''Trunks the Story''&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually loses his left arm fighting Androids #17 and #18.&lt;ref name = g/&gt; He is ultimately killed by the two androids during a battle where they ganged up on Gohan, killing him with machine gun-like ki blasts.

In the present-timeline, Gohan is shown enrolled at Orange Star High School in Satan City. After foiling crimes as a Super Saiyan he earns the alias the {{nihongo|"Golden Warrior"|金色の戦士|Kiniro no Senshi}} from the public. In order to hide his identity, and with help from [[Bulma]], he adopts a [[superhero]] persona that he dubs the {{nihongo|"Great Saiyaman"|グレートサイヤマン|Gurēto Saiyaman}}. He is also in a relationship with [[Videl]]. Participating in the 25th Tenkaichi Budōkai, Gohan is depicted as having grown weaker, which the ''Daizenshū World Guide'' book explains as due to a lack of training and anger in transforming.&lt;ref name = f/&gt; Gohan, after having his ''[[Qi|chi]]'' absorbed by Spopovich and Yamu, pursues the two and enters [[Bobbidi]]'s spaceship with the [[Kibitoshin|Kaiō-shin]], Goku and Vegeta, where Gohan later fights with Dabura.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 22, chapter 257&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Majin Buu]]‘s release and Gohan's defeat at his hands, Gohan is taken to the home planet of the Kaiō-shin. After pulling out the Zeta Sword (Known in the English Funimation Dub as the Z Sword)  and accidentally breaking it in a training session, Gohan unwittingly releases the [[Kaiō-shin|Old Kaiō-shin]], who then performs a prolonged ceremony to unlock Gohan's latent powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toriyama| first = Akira|author-link= Akira Toriyama|title = Dragon Ball Z|publisher = [[Viz Media]]| year = 2003 |chapter=Chapter 302| volume = 25 | isbn = 978-1421504049}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gohan then returns to Earth and confronts Boo for a second time, and easily defeats him.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 25, chapter 302&lt;/ref&gt; However, his victory is temporary, as he is overpowered when Boo absorbs Gotenks and Piccolo. He is later absorbed by Boo.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 25, chapter 307&lt;/ref&gt; Though Goku and Vegeta manage to rescue him along with Goten, Trunks, and Piccolo, he is killed when Boo (now in his pure form) destroys the Earth. Once revived, Gohan is able to aid Goku's ''Genki-dama'' by lending his ''chi''.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 26, chapter 319&lt;/ref&gt; Following Boo's defeat and a ten-year gap, Gohan has finally become a scholar, is married with Videl and they have a daughter [[Pan (Dragon Ball)|Pan]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 26, chapter 324&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Gohan's praise is derived from his role in the Cell arc of ''Dragon Ball Z''. [[IGN]] writer D. F.

Gohan's role and character in the latter part of the series was met with more mixed reviews. Reviewer Michael Zupan wrote of his disappointment with the character, "Gohan was once the most promising warrior in the galaxy, with the potential to even best his father, Goku… and this is where he's at seven years later? Dressing up in a green dress, black tights and a Lost in Space helmet to put the beat down on robbers?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/66000/dragon-ball-z-season-7/|title=Dragon Ball Z: Season 7 (Blu-ray)|date=September 23, 2014|first=Michael|last=Zupan|publisher=DVD Talk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Anime Focus found humor in his Great Saiyaman guise and his "clumsy but earnest" relationship with Videl, but thought it "mostly uninspired and draggy and feels very flat after the high flying antics of previous arcs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://anime-focus.com/2013/05/28/review-dragon-ball-z-season-7/|title=Review: Dragon Ball Z Season 7|date=May 28, 2013|publisher=Anime Focus|access-date=2015-03-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310061856/http://anime-focus.com/2013/05/28/review-dragon-ball-z-season-7/|archive-date=2015-03-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewer Brad Stephenson argued that the character growing older and becoming more "emotionally complex" provided ''Dragon Ball Z''  "with a true sense of progression and meaning."

Rashad argued that the character's role in the series had suffered from the backlash by fans not wanting him to become the protagonist following his defeat of Cell as he expressed: "He was never accepted by the fans, and thus the show that was meant to be his never became his. His story became the b-plot and he was relegated to being a relief pitcher after being the clutch closer for Cell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://the-artifice.com/misused-dragon-ball-characters/|title=Top Ten Misused Dragon Ball Characters|publisher=The Artifice|date=June 15, 2014|first=Santiago|last=Rashad}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sam Leach from Anime News Network noted that fans of the series tend to joke Piccolo is a better paternal figure to Gohan than his actual father, Goku, and felt that ''Dragon Ball Super'' emphasized it more when Piccolo started training him again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-ball-super/episode-90/.116070|title=Dragon Ball Super Episode 90|date=May 14, 2017|publisher=Anime News Network|first=Sam|last=Leach|accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Leach criticized how ''Super'' tries to teach "life lessons" to a mature Gohan. The fact that Piccolo calls him "arrogant", despite Gohan's kindness and humility, was seen as a bad plot point by the reviewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-ball-super/episode-88/.115488|title=Dragon Ball Super Episode 88|first=Sam|last=Leach|date=April 30, 2017|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family and personal life ==
Herman Cain was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]], to Lenora (Davis) Cain, a cleaning woman and domestic worker, and Luther Cain Jr., who was raised on a farm and worked as a barber and janitor, as well as a chauffeur for [[The Coca-Cola Company]] president [[Robert W. Woodruff]]. Cain has said that as he was growing up, his family was "poor but happy." Cain related that his mother taught him about her belief that "success was not a function of what you start out with materially, but what you start out with spiritually." His father worked three jobs to own his own home—something he achieved during Cain's childhood—and to see his two sons graduate.&lt;ref name=wsj9may&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704681904576311474087295408 |title=GOP Debate Fuels a Long Shot |first=Neil |last=King Jr. |date=May 9, 2011 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/149706/20110521/herman-cain-2012.htm |title=Herman Cain 2012: The Story of a Self-Made Man |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date=May 21, 2011 |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=politicks Org |url=http://2012.republican-candidates.org/Cain/Parents-Grandparents.php |title=Cain's Parents and Grandparents |publisher=2012.republican-candidates.org |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cain grew up on the west side of [[Atlanta]], Georgia, attending school and the Rev. [[Cameron M. Alexander]]'s Antioch Baptist Church North in the neighborhood now known as [[The Bluff (Atlanta)|The Bluff]]. Eventually Cain's father saved enough money and the family moved to a modest brick home on Albert Street in the [[Collier Heights]] neighborhood. He attended Archer (public) High School, graduating in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poe |first=Janita |url=http://cascade.patch.com/articles/s-w-atlanta-who-is-herman-cain#photo-8127565 |title=Yolande M.

In 2006 Cain was diagnosed with [[Cancer staging|Stage IV cancer]] in his [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] and metastases to his [[liver]] and given a 30 percent chance of survival. Cain underwent surgery and [[chemotherapy]] following the diagnosis, and has since reported that he is in remission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/national-affairs/docs-herman-cains-cancer-isnt-disqualifying-20111012 |title=Docs: Herman Cain's Cancer Is Not Disqualifying |work=Rolling Stone |date=October 13, 2011 |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disclosures filed during his campaign in 2011 categorized Cain's wealth at that time as being between $2.9 and $6.6 million, with Cain's combined income for both 2010 and 2011 being between $1.1 and $2.1 million.&lt;ref name=godfathersyears&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.omaha.com/article/20111011/NEWS01/710119907/0 |title = Cain: The Godfather's years |first = Steve |last = Jordon |newspaper = [[Omaha World-Herald]] |date = October 11, 2011 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130130200355/http://www.omaha.com/article/20111011/NEWS01/710119907/0 |archivedate = January 30, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and career ==
Cain received a [[master of science]] in [[computer science]] from [[Purdue University]]&lt;ref name=purdue/&gt; in 1971 while he also worked full-time as a [[ballistics]] [[wikt:analyst|analyst]] for the [[United States Department of the Navy|U.S. Department of the Navy]] as a civilian.&lt;ref name=civil&gt;{{cite web|url=http://civilliberty.about.com/od/profiles/p/Herman-Cain-Civil-Liberties.htm |title=Herman Cain on Civil Liberties and Civil Rights&amp;nbsp;– Civil Liberties Views of Herman Cain |publisher=Civilliberty.about.com |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his master's degree from Purdue, Cain left the Department of the Navy and began working for [[The Coca-Cola Company]] in Atlanta as a [[computer systems analyst]]. In 1977, he moved to [[Minneapolis]] to join [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Black Enterprise]] |title=Godfather's Pizza: This Pizza Man Delivers |date=February 1988 |page=89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vaLyEawnE9UC&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=herman.cain%20pillsbury&amp;pg=PA89#v=onepage&amp;q=herman.cain%20pillsbury&amp;f=false |author1=Earl g.

=== Burger King ===
At age 36 Cain was assigned in the 1980s to analyze and manage 400 [[Burger King]] stores in the [[Philadelphia]] area. At the time, Burger King was a Pillsbury subsidiary. Under Cain, his region posted strong improvement in three years.&lt;ref name=ericberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Star Tribune]] |title=Herman Cain's career at Pillsbury is a tale of two turnarounds |first=Neal |last=St. Anthony |date=October 30, 2011 |url=http://www.startribune.com/business/132823328.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 1987 account in the ''[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]]'', Pillsbury's then-president Win Wallin said, "He was an excellent bet. Herman always seemed to have his act together."&lt;ref name=Henninger/&gt; At Burger King, Cain "established the BEAMER program, which taught our employees, mostly teenagers, how to make our patrons smile" by smiling themselves. It was a success: "Within three months of the program's initiation, the sales trend was moving steadily higher."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=This Is Candidate Cain |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/278973/candidate-cain-katrina-trinko?page=2|accessdate=October 9, 2011 |newspaper=National Review Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Godfather's Pizza ===
Cain's success at Burger King prompted Pillsbury to appoint him president and CEO of another subsidiary, [[Godfather's Pizza]]. On his arrival on April 1, 1986, Cain told employees, "I'm Herman Cain and this ain't no April Fool's joke. We are not dead. Our objective is to prove to Pillsbury and everyone else that we will survive."&lt;ref name="Henninger"/&gt; Godfather's Pizza was performing poorly, having slipped in ranks of pizza chains from third in 1985 to fifth in 1988.&lt;ref name=ericberg/&gt; Under Cain's leadership, Godfather's closed approximately 200 restaurants and eliminated several thousand jobs, and by doing so returned to profitability.&lt;ref name=godfathersyears/&gt; In a leveraged buyout in 1988, Cain, executive vice president and COO Ronald B. Gartlan, and a group of investors bought Godfather's from Pillsbury.&lt;ref name=ericberg/&gt;

=== Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City ===
Cain served as chairman of the board of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Omaha Branch]] from January 1, 1989, to December 31, 1991.&lt;ref name=kcfed/&gt; He became a member of the board of directors of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City]] in 1992.&lt;ref name=kcfed/&gt; He served as deputy chairman from January 1, 1992, to December 31, 1994, and then as its chairman until August 19, 1996,&lt;ref name=kcfed/&gt; when he resigned to become active in national politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=KCP&amp;L head temporarily fills KC Fed Bank post |first=Ted |last=Sickinger |newspaper=Kansas City Star |date=August 27, 1996 |page=D.20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Restaurant Association ===
Cain left Godfather's Pizza in 1996 and moved to Washington, D.C.

On April 19, CM manager Carrie Carroll announced that Herman Cain has joined her shop under PM Mission Command, working out of the CTSF, Ft Hood, Texas, office.

=== Recognition ===
Cain received the 1996 [[Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans#Horatio Alger Award|Horatio Alger Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.horatioalger.org/members_info.cfm?memberid=CAI96 |title=Herman Cain |publisher=Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans |accessdate=May 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has received honorary degrees from [[Creighton University]], [[Johnson &amp; Wales University]], [[Morehouse College]], the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]], the [[New York City College of Technology]], [[Purdue University]], [[Suffolk University]], and [[Tougaloo College]].&lt;ref name="board" /&gt;

Because of his Christian ethic applied to his business acumen, Cain was profiled in ''The Entrepreneur's Creed'', written by [[Mike Hamel]] and published by Broadman &amp; Holman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhpublishinggroup.com/|title=B&amp;H Publishing Group - Every WORD Matters|website=B&amp;H Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; which spotlighted notable executives, including [[Jerry Colangelo]] (former owner of the Phoenix Suns, Arizona Diamondbacks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblio.com/search.php?stage=1&amp;result_type=works&amp;keyisbn=Mike+Hamel|title=Mike Hamel - Biblio.com|website=www.biblio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Cain is referred to as "the [[Colin Powell]] of American capitalism," according to former presidential candidate and football star, [[Jack Kemp]]. Kemp stated that Cain's "conquests won't be counted in terms of countries liberated or lives saved, but in those things that make life worth living — expanding opportunity, creating jobs and broadening horizons, not just for those he knows, but through his example, for those he'll never meet." Hamel notes that such a claim is remarkable, given Cain's father was a chauffeur for the CEO of Coca-Cola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nRpfNE8iIxEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q=herman+cain&amp;f=false|title=The Entrepreneur's Creed: The Principles &amp; Passions of 20 Successful Entrepreneurs|date=August 15, 2018|publisher=Armour Publishing Pte Ltd|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political activities ==

=== Role in the defeat of 1993 Clinton health care plan ===
Cain publicly opposed the [[Clinton health care plan of 1993]]. As president-elect of the [[National Restaurant Association]], he challenged Bill Clinton on the costs of the employer mandate contained within the bill and criticized its effect on small businesses. [[Bob Cohn]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'' described Cain as one of the primary opponents of the plan:
: The Clintons would later blame "Harry and Louise," the fictional couple in the ads aired by the insurance industry, for undermining health reform. But the real saboteurs are named Herman and John. Herman Cain is the president of Godfather's Pizza and president-elect of the National Restaurant Association. An articulate entrepreneur, Cain transformed the debate when he challenged Clinton at a town meeting in Kansas City, Missouri. Cain asked the president what he was supposed to say to the workers he would have to lay off because of the cost of the "employer mandate". Clinton responded that there would be plenty of subsidies for small businessmen, but Cain persisted. "Quite honestly, your calculation is inaccurate," he told the president. "In the competitive marketplace it simply doesn't work that way."&lt;ref name="Newsweeks" /&gt;
[[Joshua Green (journalist)|Joshua Green]] of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' has called Cain's exchange with Clinton his "auspicious debut on the national political stage".&lt;ref&gt;[[Joshua Green (journalist)|Green, Joshua]] (January 17, 2011) [https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/01/watch-herman-cain-battle-bill-clinton-on-health-care/69683/ Watch Herman Cain Battle Bill Clinton on Health Care], ''[[The Atlantic]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative politician and former housing secretary [[Jack Kemp]] was so impressed with Cain's performance that he chartered a plane to [[Nebraska]] to meet Cain after the debate. Cain credits Kemp with his becoming interested in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/herman-cain-explained/2011/09/26/gIQA5KoNzK_blog.html|title=Herman Cain's Kemp Connection|accessdate=October 3, 2011|work=[[National Review]]|first=Robert|last=Costa|date=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cain was a senior economic adviser to the [[Bob Dole]] presidential campaign in 1996.&lt;ref name=rlc/&gt;

=== 2000 presidential campaign ===
{{main|Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2000}}
Cain briefly ran for the Republican presidential nomination in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]]; he says it was more about making political statements than winning the nomination. "George W. Bush was the chosen one, he had the campaign DNA that followers look for." However, Cain went on to state, "I believe that I had a better message and I believe that I was the better messenger."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/07/11/herman-cain-possible-dark-horse-2012-gop-presidential-candida/|title=Herman Cain: Possible 'Dark Horse' 2012 GOP Presidential Candidate|accessdate=June 24, 2011|work=[[Politics Daily]]|first=Matt|last=Lewis|authorlink=Matt Lewis (journalist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ending his own campaign, however, he endorsed [[Steve Forbes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/herman-cain-explained/2011/09/26/gIQA5KoNzK_blog.html|title=Herman Cain explained |accessdate=October 3, 2011|work=The Washington Post|first=Rachel|last=Weiner|date=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2004 U.S. Senate candidacy ===
{{main|United States Senate election in Georgia, 2004}}
In 2004 Cain ran for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in Georgia and did not win in the primaries. He was pursuing the seat that came open with the retirement of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Zell Miller]]. Cain sought the Republican nomination, facing congressmen [[Johnny Isakson]] and [[Mac Collins]] in the primary. Collins tried to paint Cain as a moderate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A58347-2004Jul17 | newspaper=The Washington Post | first=Manuel | last=Roig-Franzia | title=Cain Makes Inroads in Ga.

=== Americans for Prosperity and America's PAC ===
Starting in 2005, Cain worked for the political advocacy group [[Americans for Prosperity]] (AFP) alongside [[Mark Block]]. Block would later become campaign manager for Cain's 2012 presidential run and would be joined in Cain's campaign by several other AFP employees. Cain continued to receive honorariums for speaking at AFP events until he announced his campaign for the Republican nomination.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/long-ties-to-koch-brothers-key-to-cains-campaign/2011/10/16/gIQAKTLPoL_story.html "Herman Cain's deep ties to Koch brothers key to campaign"].

In July 2011, an advisor suggested that his campaign's tax policy plan be called "the Optimal Tax", but Cain rejected the name, saying "we're just going to call it what it is: 9–9–9 Plan".&lt;ref name="WSJ-999"&gt;John D.

Cain's stated goal was to get commitments from members of Congress to support the 9-9-9 Plan before the 2012 elections.&lt;ref name=solutionone&gt;{{cite news|title=Herman Cain launches 'Cain's Solutions Revolution' to 'keep 999 alive{{'-}}|url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/herman-cain-launches-cain-solutions-revolution-keep-999-034444411.html|first=Dylan|last=Stableford|accessdate=January 4, 2012|work=The Ticket|publisher=[[Yahoo!

=== State of the Union response ===
For President Obama's [[2012 State of the Union address]], the [[Tea Party Express]] chose Cain to give its second annual response.&lt;ref name=s12112&gt;{{cite press release|title=Herman Cain Delivers Tea Party Response to SOTU Tonight!|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/herman-cain-delivers-tea-party-response-to-sotu-tonight-2012-01-24|accessdate=January 25, 2012|publisher=Tea Party Express|date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Indiana Governor [[Mitch Daniels]] gave the official GOP response,&lt;ref name=s32112&gt;{{cite news|last=Weinger|first=Mackenzie|title=Herman Cain: 'Stop the blame game{{'-}}|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0112/71926.html|accessdate=January 25, 2012|newspaper=[[Politico]]|date=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cain delivered his speech at the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]].&lt;ref name=s22112&gt;{{cite news|last=Reilly|first=Ryan J.|title={{-'}}We Ain't Stupid': Herman Cain Responds To State Of The Union|url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/01/watching-obamas-state-of-the-union-address-with-herman-cain.php|accessdate=January 25, 2012|newspaper=[[Talking Points Memo]]|date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech was streamed live on the Tea Party Express website.&lt;ref name=s32112 /&gt;&lt;ref name=s52112&gt;{{cite news|last=Chandler|first=D.L.|title=Herman Cain Responds To Obama's Speech With Tea Party Rebuttal|url=http://newsone.com/nation/washington-watch/dlchandler/herman-cain-responds-to-obamas-speech-with-tea-party-rebuttal/|accessdate=January 25, 2012|work=News One for Black America|publisher=[[Radio One (company)|Radio One]]|date=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cain referred to Obama's address as a "hodgepodge of liberal ideas", adding that there were "no big ideas that would impact job growth" and "no big ideas that would stimulate economic growth in this country".&lt;ref name=s42112&gt;{{cite news|title=Cain: 'We deserve better{{'-}}|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2012/01/24/Cain-We-deserve-better/UPI-77621327465814/|accessdate=January 25, 2012|publisher=[[UPI]]|date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Call for a third party===
After Barack Obama's reelection in 2012, Herman Cain told [[Bryan Fischer]] that the Republican Party no longer represented the interests of conservatives in the United States and that it didn't have "the ability to rebrand itself", so a third party, "not [[Ron Paul]] and the Ron Paulites" but "a legitimate third party", would be needed to replace it.&lt;ref name="thirdparty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/11/07/gop_civil_war_herman_cain_calls_for_3rd_party/|title=GOP civil war: Herman Cain calls for 3rd party}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5482">'''Ibrahim M. Abu-Rabi‘''' ({{lang|ar|إبراهيم محمد هزاع ابوربيع}}) was a Professor in Islamic Studies (Department of History and Classics) at the [[University of Alberta]], [[Edmonton]], Canada, and the Chair of the Edmonton Council of Muslim Communities. His primary areas of academic specialization were the [[Middle East]] and [[International Relations]]. He also had a special interest in the study and practice of [[interfaith dialog]]ue between the Islamic and Christian religious traditions.

==Education==
Abu-Rabi‘ was born [[Nazareth]] and completed his schooling in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]. He attended university in the United States, earning a [[Master of Arts|Master of Arts (MA)]] in Religious Studies from Temple University in 1983 and a MA in [[Political Science]] from the [[University of Cincinnati]] in 1982. He earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)]] in Islamic Studies, with concentrations in [[Contemporary Islamic philosophy|Modern Islamic]] Thought and Comparative [[Islamic culture|Islamic Cultures]], from the [[Temple University]] Department of Religion in 1987. His dissertation was entitled "Islam and Search for Social Order in Modern Egypt: An Intellectual Biography of Shaykh al-Azhar 'Abd al-Halim Mahmud." Abu-Rabi‘ left Temple University and accepted temporary placements at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] and the [[University of Texas at Austin]].

==Career==
In 1991 Abu-Rabi‘ accepted a post at the [[Hartford Seminary]] in Connecticut, serving as a professor for the then-named Macdonald Center for the Study of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations (now the [[Hartford Seminary#Current resources|Duncan Black Macdonald Center for the Study of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations]]). In addition to his work with interfaith dialogue, Abu-Rabi‘ specialized in issues of contemporary Islamic thought, particularly in relation to religion and society and mysticism.

In 2006 he was the Senior [[Fulbright Program#Program|Fulbright Scholar]] in Singapore and Indonesia whilst based at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies on the [[Nanyang Technological University]] campus. In 2008 Abu-Rabi‘ was appointed the first holder of the Edmonton Council of Muslim Communities Chair in Islamic Studies at the [[University of Alberta]], the first teaching and research chair of its kind in Canada.

==Death==
Ibrahim Abu-Rabi‘ died of a sudden heart attack on 2 July 2011 while attending  a conference in [[Amman]], [[Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Ibrahim Abu-Rabi‘|url=http://psnedmonton.ca/2011/07/04/dr-ibrahim-Abu-Rabi‘/|work=psnedmonton.ca|publisher=Palestine Solidarity Network – Edmonton|accessdate=7 April 2012|format=Web page (blog)|date=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I am greatly saddened to learn of the sudden loss of one of our own, professor Ibrahim Abu-Rabi‘, chair of Islamic studies," said university President [[Indira Samarasekera]]. "As a mentor and a teacher, he was well known for his passion for teaching and his dedication to building understanding between people of various faiths. He will be remembered for his enthusiasm for his work, his unwavering support of his colleagues and students, and his care and compassion for all.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U of Alberta’s Chair of Islamic studies dies at 55|url=http://iqra.ca/2011/u-of-alberta%E2%80%99s-chair-of-islamic-studies-dies-at-55/|work=iqra.ca|publisher=The Zanna Group|accessdate=7 April 2012|author=IQRADOTCA|date=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had two kids.

==Publications==
Abu-Rabi‘ was a devoted researcher and a prolific writer, with numerous titles to his credit. His work ''The Contemporary Arab Reader on Political Islam'' (University of Alberta Press, 2010) is a collection of writings from highly influential figures in the field of [[Islamism]] that attempts to address misunderstood notions of contemporary Islam. In an interview from the spring 2011 edition of ''WOA (Work of Arts)'', the U of A Faculty of Arts [[Alumnus|alumni]] magazine, Abu-Rabi‘ said, "most Islamist groups are pro-democracy and anti-violence, but you’d never know this from what’s reported in the press. I wanted to give Islamists the chance to speak for themselves." The professor expressed a belief that out of the many books written in the [[Western world|West]] that purport to explain Islamism, virtually all have been written by westerners; that is, Islamist voices have remained largely absent.

A [[Curriculum vitae|curriculum vitae (CV)]] containing Abu-Rabi‘'s publications is available on the website of the Hartford Theological Seminary, where he taught before moving to the University of Alberta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macdonald.hartsem.edu/aburabi.htm |title=Faculty Profile of Ibrahim Abu-Rabi‘  |publisher=Macdonald.hartsem.edu |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abu-Rabi‘ was affiliated with the International Council for Middle East Studies in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]] and a list of his publications was placed on the Council's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmes.net/?page_id=353 |title=Ibrahim M. Abu-Rabi‘ (1956-2011) « ICMES |publisher=Icmes.net |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abu-Rabi‘ served as the senior editor of ''The Muslim World'' journal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3279">'''Jamshid Bahman Jamshidian''', also known as '''Arbab Jamshidi''' (born in 1851 in [[Yazd]] - died January 16, 1933 in [[Tehran]]) , was a prominent [[Zoroastrian]] figure in Iran who introduced the idea of modern banking in Iran as well as being the first representative of the [[Zoroastrians in Iran|Zoroastrian community]] in the Iranian Parliament.

==Life==

At the age of 11, due to his intelligence and exceptionally sharp memory, he was sent to [[Borujerd]] along with one of his father’s friends, to work in the local trade center owned by Arbab Rostam Mehr. He stayed there until the age of 20. By that time, the young Jamshid had opened his own small trade centers in [[Borujerd]] and [[Bandar Abbas]] and he was focusing on the clothing business. He expanded his operations to the north and specifically towards the capital, [[Tehran]]. One of his early intentions, deeply rooted in the care that he had for his society and his fellow Zoroastrians, was to employ as many bright young Zoroastrians as possible in his business, to reduce the centuries old dependency of their society on traditional farming.

Arbab Jamshid encouraged and facilitated Zoroastrian migration to the capital of Tehran. At the height of his operation, he had 150 Zoroastrian employees in his Tehran financial firm. Zoroastrian neighborhoods were formed in the area surrounding the residence of Jamshid. The nucleus of this community was formed by his employees and their families, joined later by other Zoroastrians.

By the age of 35, Arbab Jamshid had several trade chambers in the central market known as the [[Grand Bazaar, Tehran|Grand Bazaar of Tehran]]. This was a place where, normally non-Moslems had difficult times establishing businesses due to heightened level of prejudice. It was deeply rooted in centuries of discrimination and unjust behavior. Jamshid managed to build respect by establishing relationships with the key political figures of his time. These included two kings of Iran, [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar]] and [[Mohammed Ali Shah Qajar]], and other political figures such as the first Iranian Prime Minister [[Mirza Nasrullah Khan]]. These relationships were built upon mutual respect and often accompanied by generous gifts.

While keeping these powerful relationships, he also helped the poor. Iranians from any religious belief and/or background would be welcomed on a weekly basis to his house or business centers. Often 400 to 500 of the poor attended his weekly lunch. Arbab Jamshid was known as the [[Hatim al-Tai]] of Iran.

'''Krishna Mohan Banerjee'''&lt;ref&gt;His surname is also transliterated as ''Banerjea'' or as ''Bandyopadhyay''.&lt;/ref&gt; (24 May 1813&amp;nbsp;– 11 May 1885) was a 19th-century Indian thinker who attempted to rethink Hindu philosophy, religion and ethics in response to the stimulus of Christian ideas. He himself became a Christian, and was the first president of the [[Bengal Christian Association]], which was administered and financed by Indians. He was a prominent member of [[Henry Louis Vivian Derozio]]’s (1808–1831) [[Young Bengal]] group, educationist, linguist and Christian missionary.

==Early life==
[[File:Krishna_Mohan_Banerjea.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait by [[Colesworthey Grant]]]]
Son of Jibon Krishna Banerjee&lt;ref name=Banglapedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Murshid |first=Ghulam |year=2012 |chapter=Banerji, Rev. Krishna Mohan |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Banerji,_Rev._Krishna_Mohan |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sreemoti Devi, Krishna Mohan was born on 24 May 1813 at Shyampur, Kolkata, Bengal, in the house of his maternal grandfather, Ramjay Vidyabhusan, the court-pundit of Santiram Singha of [[Jorasanko]].

In 1819, Krishna Mohan joined the [[Hare School|''School Society Institution'']] (later renamed as [[Hare School]]) founded by [[David Hare (philanthropist)|David Hare]] at colootola. Impressed by his talents, Hare took him to his school at Pataldanga, later famous as [[Hare School]] in 1822.

Banerjee joined the newly founded [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Hindu College]] with a scholarship.

In 1831, the religious-reformer-and-litterateur started publishing ''The Inquirer''. In the same year his play, ''The Persecuted: or, Dramatic Scenes Illustrative of the Present State of Hindoo Society in Calcutta'', was produced. It was monotonically critical of certain prevalent social practices.

While at college he used to attend the lectures of the Scottish Christian missionary, [[Alexander Duff (missionary)|Alexander Duff]], who had come to India in 1830.

His father died of cholera in 1828.

==Conversion to Christianity==
On completion of his studies in 1829, Banerjee joined ''Pataldanga School'' as an assistant teacher. In 1832, he converted to Christianity, under the influence of Alexander Duff. As a result of his conversion, he lost his job in David Hare’s school and his wife, Bindhyobashini Banerjee, was forced to return to her own father's house, only to join him in later life. Nevertheless, he later became the headmaster of ''Church Missionary Society School''.&lt;ref name=Banglapedia /&gt;

When the missionary society had begun its philanthropic activities in Kolkata, Banerjee became the first Bengali priest of Christ Church where he used to preach and deliver sermons in Bengali.&lt;ref name=Banglapedia /&gt;

He converted his wife, his brother Kali Mohan, and [[Gnanendramohan Tagore|Ganendra Mohan Tagore]], the son of [[Prasanna Coomar Tagore]] to Christian faith. Subsequently, Ganendra Mohan married his daughter Kamalmani and became the first Indian to qualify as a barrister. He was also instrumental in the conversion of [[Michael Madhusudan Dutt]].

==Later life==
In 1852, Krishna Mohan was appointed a professor of Oriental Studies at [[Bishop’s College, Calcutta|Bishop's College]], Kolkata. He had studied aspects of Christianity as a student of the same college between 1836 and 1839.

In 1864 he was elected to be a member of the [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Asiatic Society]] along with [[Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar]]. In 1876 the [[University of Calcutta]] honoured him with a [[List of University of Calcutta honorary degree recipients|honorary doctorate degree]].

Reverend Krishna Mohan Banerjee died on 11 May 1885 in Kolkata, and was buried at [[Shibpur]].

==Works==

He published a 13-volume English&amp;nbsp;– Bengali adaptation of [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], ''Vidyakalpadruma'' or ''Encyclopædia Bengalensis'' (1846–51).&lt;ref name=Amaresh&gt;{{Cite book | last = Datta | first = Amaresh | title = Encyclopaedia of Indian literature | place = Delhi | pages= 1162–1163| publisher = South Asia Books | year = 1988 | volume = 2 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&amp;pg=PA1162 | isbn = 978-81-7201-649-4 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote an Indian English drama "The persecuted" in 1831..

His other works include ''[https://archive.org/details/arianwitnessort00banegoog The Arian Witness]'' (1875),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arian Witness, Or, The Testimony of Arian Scriptures: In Corroboration ...|url=https://archive.org/details/arianwitnessort00banegoog|publisher=Thacker, Spink|accessdate=12 July 2017|language=English|date=1875}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[https://archive.org/details/dialoguesonhindu00banerich Dialogues on the Hindu Philosophy]'' (1861), and ''The Relation Between Christianity and Hinduism'' (1881).

'''Lyon Sprague de Camp''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|p|r|eɪ|ɡ|d|ə|ˈ|k|æ|m|p}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOCB-N_md_4|title=None But Lucifer - H.L. Gold &amp; L. Sprague de Camp|date=2009-11-17|accessdate=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 27 November 1907 – 6 November 2000), better known as '''L. Sprague de Camp''', was an American writer of [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]] and [[non-fiction]]. In a career spanning 60 years, he wrote over 100 books, including novels and works of non-fiction, such as biographies of other fantasy authors. He was a major figure in science fiction in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;"L. S. de Camp, 92, Author Of Over 100 Fantasy Novels." Obituary in ''The New York Times'', November 11, 2000, p. C16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
De Camp was born in [[New York City]], one of three sons of Lyon de Camp, a businessman in real estate and lumber,&lt;ref name="Talking to Ghosts"&gt;{{cite news|last1=De Camp|first1=L. Sprague|title=Talking to Ghosts|agency=The New York Times Magazine|date=April 7, 1985|page=SM38}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Emma Beatrice Sprague. His maternal grandfather was the accountant, banker, pioneering [[Volapük]]ist and [[United States Civil War|Civil War]] veteran [[Charles E. Sprague|Charles Ezra Sprague]].&lt;ref name="Talking to Ghosts" /&gt; De Camp once noted that he rarely used pen-names, "partly because my own true name sounds more like a pseudonym than most pseudonyms do."&lt;ref&gt;De Camp, L. Sprague. ''Science-Fiction Handbook'' (New York: Hermitage Press, 1953), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Camp began his education at the Trinity School in New York, then spent ten years attending the Snyder School in North Carolina,&lt;ref name=Robins&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robins|first1=William Mattathias|editor1-last=Cowart|editor1-first=David|editor2-last=Wymer|editor2-first=Thomas L.|title=Dictionary of Literary Biography: Twentieth-Century American Science-Fiction Writers (Vol. 8)|date=1981|publisher=Gale Research|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0810309180|chapter=L(yon) Sprague de Camp}}&lt;/ref&gt; a military-style institution. His stay at the Snyder School was an attempt by his parents, who were heavy-handed disciplinarians,&lt;ref name="Talking to Ghosts" /&gt; to cure him of intellectual arrogance and lack of discipline. He was awkward and thin, an ineffective fighter, and suffered from bullying by his classmates. His experiences at the school taught him to develop a detached, analytical style considered cold by all but his closest friends,&lt;ref name=Moskowitz&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moskowitz|first1=Sam | authorlink =Sam Moskowitz|title=Seekers of Tomorrow|date=1966|publisher=[[Hyperion Press]]|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=0-88355-158-6|pages=151–166|chapter=L. Sprague de Camp}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he could, like his father,&lt;ref name="Talking to Ghosts" /&gt; be disarming and funny in social situations. He would later recall these challenging childhood experiences in the semi-autobiographical story, ''Judgment Day'' (1955).&lt;ref name=Moskowitz /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bleiler&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stableford|first1=Brian M. | authorlink =Brian Stableford|editor1-last=Bleiler|editor1-first=Everett Franklin (Ed.) | editorlink =E.

Bleiler|title=Science Fiction Writers: Critical Studies of the Major Authors from the Early Nineteenth Century to the Present Day|date=1982|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|chapter=L(yon) Sprague de Camp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An aeronautical engineer by profession, De Camp conducted his undergraduate studies at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (where his roommate was at one point noted [[rocket fuel]] scientist [[John Drury Clark]]),&lt;ref name=Moskowitz /&gt; and earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree from Caltech in [[Aeronautical Engineering]] 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/2555/1/1930.pdf |title=Caltech Commencement Program |date=June 13, 1930 |publisher=Caltech Campus Publications ([[Caltech]]) |accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his [[Master of Science]] degree in [[Engineering]] from the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] in 1933. De Camp was also a [[surveying|surveyor]] and an expert in [[patent]]s.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

His first job was with the Inventors Foundation, Inc. in Hoboken, N.J., which was taken over by The International Correspondence Schools. De Camp transferred to the [[Scranton, PA]] division. He was Principal of the School of Inventing and Patenting when he resigned in 1937.&lt;ref name=Moskowitz /&gt; His first book ''[[Inventions and Their Management]]'' resulted and was published in July 1937.

On August 12, 1939, de Camp married [[Catherine Crook de Camp|Catherine Crook]],&lt;ref name=Moskowitz /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Catherine Crook wed in Riverside Chapel: Alumna of Barnard College is Bride of L. Sprague de Camp|agency=New York Times|date=August 13, 1939|page=D2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he collaborated on science fiction and nonfiction beginning in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

[[Image:Heinlein-decamp-and-asimov.jpg|thumb|300px|right|De Camp (center) with [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[Isaac Asimov]] in 1944.]]

During [[World War II]], de Camp served as a researcher at the [[Philadelphia Naval Yard]] along with his fellow writers [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Robert A. Heinlein]]. De Camp eventually rose to the rank of [[lieutenant commander]] in the [[U.S. Navy]] as a [[reserve officer]].&lt;ref name=Moskowitz /&gt;

De Camp was a member of the all-male literary and dining club the "[[Trap Door Spiders]]" in [[New York City]], which served as the basis of Asimov's fictional group of mystery solvers the "[[Black Widowers]]."  De Camp himself was the model for the character named "Geoffrey Avalon."&lt;ref name="Asimov1994-120"&gt;Asimov, Isaac. ''I. Asimov: a Memoir'' (New York, Doubleday, 1994), chapter 120 "The Trap Door Spiders."&lt;/ref&gt;

De Camp was a founding member of the [[Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America]] (SAGA), a loosely knit group of [[Heroic fantasy]] writers that was founded during the 1960s and led by [[Lin Carter]], with entry by credentials as a fantasy writer alone.

The de Camps moved to [[Plano, Texas]], in 1989, and Sprague de Camp died there on November 6, 2000, seven months after his wife,&lt;ref name=Thurber&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thurber|first1=Jon|title=Obituaries; L. Sprague de Camp; Prolific Sci-Fi Writer|work=Los Angeles Times|date=November 13, 2000|location=Los Angeles, CA|page=B4}}&lt;/ref&gt; on what would have been her birthday, just three weeks before his own 93rd birthday. His ashes were inurned, together with hers, in the [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in [[Virginia]].

De Camp's personal library of about 1,200 books was acquired for auction by [[Half Price Books]] in 2005. The collection included books inscribed by fellow writers, such as [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Carl Sagan]], as well as de Camp himself.&lt;ref name="DMN"&gt;Weeks, Jerome. "De Camp library for sale." ''The Dallas Morning News'', October 24, 2005, p. 3G.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in coining the terms "extraterrestrial" and "E.T."==
"Extraterrestrial," a coinage from "extra" + "terrestrial," meaning from beyond earth, is attested as an adjective as early as 1868, according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. Its first use in connection with ''life'' beyond earth was likely by [[H. G. Wells]], in his 1898 novel ''[[The War of the Worlds]]''.&lt;ref name="Cryer"&gt;Cryer, Max. ''Common Phrases ... and the Amazing Stories Behind Them''. New York: Skyhorse Publishing, 2010, page 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hendrickson"&gt;Hendrickson, Robert. ''Words and Phrase Origins''. 3rd ed. New York: Facts On File, 2004, page 249.&lt;/ref&gt; L. Sprague de Camp is credited with its first usage as a noun with the meaning of "alien life" and with coining the abbreviation "E.T." in the first part of his two-part article "Design for Life," published in the May 1939 issue of ''Astounding Science Fiction''.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cryer"/&gt;

==Works==
De Camp was a [[materialism|materialist]] who wrote works examining [[society]], [[history]], [[technology]] and [[mythology|myth]]. He published numerous short stories, novels, non-fiction works and poems during his long career.&lt;ref name=Robins /&gt;

De Camp had the mind of an educator, and a common theme in many of his works is a corrective impulse regarding similar previous works by other authors. A highly rational and logical thinker, he was frequently disturbed by what he regarded as logical lapses and absurdities in others' writings.&lt;ref name=Robins /&gt; Some, like Asimov, felt de Camp's conscientiousness about facts limited the scope of his stories: de Camp was reluctant to use technological or scientific concepts (e.g., hyperspace or faster-than-light travel) if he did not think them possible.&lt;ref name=Robins /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bleiler /&gt; Thus, his response to [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'' was to write a similar [[time travel]] novel (''[[Lest Darkness Fall]]'') in which the method of time travel was rationalized and the hero's technical expertise both set at a believable level and constrained by the technological limitations of the age.&lt;ref name=Robins /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bleiler /&gt;

In like fashion, he reimagined [[space opera]] and [[planetary romance]] in his "''[[Viagens Interplanetarias]]''" series, and the prehistoric precursor civilizations characteristic of much [[heroic fantasy]] in his [[Pusadian series]]. When he was not debunking literary conventions he was often explaining them. For example, in the [[Harold Shea]] stories co-written with his longtime friend [[Fletcher Pratt]] (1897–1956), the magical premises of some bodies of [[mythology|myths]] and [[legend]]s were accepted but examined and elucidated in terms of their own systems of inherent logic. The imaginative civilizations in [[The Complete Compleat Enchanter|''The Compleat Enchanter'']], for example, are built upon a cultural and technological reality based on scientific formulas. Characters may be transported to these different worlds, but the magic contained within those worlds is only feasible to the extent that it coincides with the technology of the day (e.g., the combustion engine).&lt;ref name="Dean, J."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=John|title=Strangely Familiar Forms: Exploitations of Romance in American Science Fiction and Fantasy|journal=Revue francaise d'etudes americaines|date=April 1980|volume=9, L'Etranger dans la Culture Americaine|pages=149–158|jstor=20872772|publisher=Editions Belin}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Camp's explanatory tendency also carried over into his non-fictional writings, including advice to science fiction writers on handling the different states of languages in future worlds.&lt;ref name="Meyers, W.E."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyers|first1=Walter E.|title=The Future History and Development of the English Language|journal=Science Fiction Studies|date=July 1976|volume=3|issue=2|pages=130–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science fiction===
De Camp's science fiction is marked by his interests in linguistics, ancient history, and the history and philosophy of science.&lt;ref name="Power"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laughlin, Charlotte, and Levack, Daniel J. H. ''De Camp: An L. Sprague de Camp Bibliography''. San Francisco, Underwood/Miller, 1983, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, David, ed. ''First Flight: Maiden Voyages in Space and Time'', New York, Lancer Books, 1963, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; His first published story was "[[The Isolinguals]]", in the September 1937 issue of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''&lt;ref name=Moskowitz /&gt;—the last issue edited by [[F. Orlin Tremaine]], prior to the long tenure of [[John W. Campbell]].&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; Most of his early science fiction stories were unrelated to each other, the exceptions being his "Johnny Black" tales about a black bear [[Uplift (science fiction)|uplifted]] to human-level intelligence, and his "Drinkwhiskey Institute" stories, a series of tall tales involving time travel. Campbell's fantasy magazine, [[Unknown (magazine)|''Unknown'']], was suited to de Camp's idosyncratic imagination, logic, and sense of humor.&lt;ref name="Pringle, D."&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pringle|first1=David (Ed.)|title=St. James Guide to Fantasy Writers|date=1996|publisher=St. James Press|location=New York|isbn=9781558622050}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed ten novels (five as collaborations), much of it characterized by humor and dry wit.&lt;ref name=Bleiler /&gt; De Camp eschewed the intention of being a satirist, insisting, instead, that the stories he wrote were meant less for instruction or improvement, as satire requires, and more for the amusement of his readers.&lt;ref name=Moskowitz /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bleiler /&gt;

De Camp's treatment of [[time travel]] and [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] in stories such as ''[[Lest Darkness Fall]]'' (1939), "[[The Wheels of If]]" (1940), "[[A Gun for Dinosaur]]" (1956), "[[Aristotle and the Gun]]" (1958), and ''[[The Glory That Was]]'' (1960) challenged the popular notion of his time that history consisted of an arbitrary series of accidents. Instead, de Camp, through sound background knowledge and logical thought, systematically demonstrated how technological advances could determine the pattern of an eventful history. His display of technological determinism in historical recreation is considered a ''tour de force.''&lt;ref name=Bleiler /&gt;&lt;ref name="Remington, T."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Remington|first1=Thomas|title=SF as Structural Fabulation|journal=The North American Review|date=Winter 1975|volume=260|issue=4|pages=53–55|jstor=25117723}}&lt;/ref&gt;''Lest Darkness Fall'', "The Wheels of If" and "Aristotle and the Gun" have been recognized as seminal works in the field of alternate history.&lt;ref name="SWfAH"&gt;[http://www.uchronia.net/sidewise/complete.html#achieve "Past Winners and Finalists"]. Sidewise Awards for Alternate History (''uchronia.net''). Retrieved 2013-04-23. This was a Special Achievement award "for seminal works in the field" among the first annual Sidewise Awards in 1996 (generally recognizing 1995 publications).&lt;/ref&gt;

His most extended work was his "''[[Viagens Interplanetarias]]''" series, set in a future where Brazil is the dominant power, particularly a sub-series of [[sword and planet]] novels set on the planet Krishna, beginning with ''[[The Queen of Zamba]]''.&lt;ref name="Power"&gt;Power, Colleen. "DeCamp, L. (Lyon) Sprague." ''Reader's Guide to Twentieth-Century Science Fiction'' (Chicago, American Library Association, 1989), pp. 170-74.&lt;/ref&gt; His most influential ''Viagens'' novel was the non-Krishna work ''[[Rogue Queen]]'', a tale of a hive society undermined by interstellar contact, which was one of the earliest science fiction novels to deal with sexual themes.&lt;ref name=Bleiler /&gt;

De Camp wrote a number of lesser-known but nonetheless significant works that explored such topics as [[racism]], which he considered to be more accurately described as [[ethnocentrism]]. He pointed out that no scholar comparing the merits of various ethnicities has ever sought to prove that his own ethnicity was inferior to others.&lt;ref&gt;De Camp, L. Sprague.

De Camp was best known for his light fantasy, particularly two series written in collaboration with Pratt, the [[Harold Shea]] stories (from 1940 et seq.) and [[Tales from Gavagan's Bar|Gavagan's Bar]] (from 1950).&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moskowitz /&gt; [[Floyd C. Gale]] in 1961 said that they "were far and away the finest team of fantasy collaborators".&lt;ref name="gale196112"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Camp and Pratt also wrote some stand-alone novels similar in tone to the Harold Shea stories, of which the most highly regarded is ''[[Land of Unreason]]'' (1942), and de Camp wrote a few more of this genre on his own.&lt;ref name="Pringle, D." /&gt;

He was also known for his [[sword and sorcery]], a fantasy genre revived partly by his editorial work on and continuation of [[Robert E. Howard]]'s [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] cycle.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pringle, D." /&gt; He also edited a series of fantasy anthologies credited with helping to spark the renaissance of heroic fantasy in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="Stableford"&gt;Stableford, Brian M. "L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt." ''Supernatural Fiction Writers: Fantasy and Horror'', ed. [[Everett F. Bleiler]] (New York, Scribner, 1985), vol. 2, p. 929.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Camp also created three noteworthy sword and sorcery sequences. The [[Pusadian series]] (from 1951), composed of the novel ''[[The Tritonian Ring]]'' and several short stories, is set in an [[antediluvian]] era similar to Howard's.

More substantial is the [[Novarian series]] (from 1968), of which the core is the [[The Reluctant King|Reluctant King]] trilogy, beginning with ''[[The Goblin Tower]]'', de Camp's most accomplished effort in the genre, continuing in ''[[The Clocks of Iraz]]'', and concluding with ''[[The Unbeheaded King]]''. The trilogy features the adventurer Jorian, ex-king of Xylar. Jorian's world is an alternate reality to which our own serves as an afterlife. Other novels in the sequence include ''[[The Fallible Fiend]]'', a satire told from the point of view of a demon, and ''[[The Honorable Barbarian]]'', a follow-up to the trilogy featuring Jorian's brother as the hero.

The Incorporated Knight series comprises some 1970s short stories by de Camp and two novels written in collaboration with Catherine Crook de Camp, ''[[The Incorporated Knight]]'' (1988) and ''[[The Pixilated Peeress]]'' (1991).&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; The early short stories were incorporated into the first of these. The sequence is set in the medieval era of another alternate world sharing the geography of our own, but in which a Neapolitan empire filled the role of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and no universal religion like [[Christianity]] ever arose, leaving its nations split among competing pagan sects. The setting is borrowed in part from ''[[John Mandeville|Mandeville's Travels]]''.

===Historical fiction===
De Camp also wrote [[historical fiction]] set in the era of classical antiquity from the height of the [[Achaemenid Empire|First Persian Empire]] to the waning of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] period. Five novels published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] from 1958 to 1969&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; form a loosely connected series based on their common setting and occasional cross references. They were also linked by a common focus on the advancement of scientific knowledge, de Camp's chosen protagonists being explorers, artisans, engineers, innovators and practical philosophers rather than famous names from antiquity, who are relegated to secondary roles. The best known of his historical novels is ''[[The Dragon of the Ishtar Gate]]''.

===Nonfiction===
[[File:Galaxy 195202.jpg|thumb|right|In 1952, [[Richard M. Powers]] provided a ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' cover highlighting essays by de Camp and by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]]]
De Camp's first book was ''[[Inventions and Their Management]]'', co-written with Alf K. Berle and published by [[International Textbook Company]] in 1937: a 733-page book with three-page list of law cases cited.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;&lt;ref name=LCC1/&gt;

He enjoyed [[debunker|debunking]] doubtful history and [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] claims about the supernatural. He conducted extensive research for what was to be a book on magic, witchcraft and occultism, though only the first chapter, "The Unwritten Classics" (March, 1947), was published in the ''Saturday Review of Literature''.&lt;ref name=Moskowitz /&gt; By May, 1976, concerned with what [[Paul Kurtz]] described as "an enormous increase in public interest in psychic phenomena, the occult and pseudoscience," de Camp joined the newly formed [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]] along with astronomers [[George O. Abell|George Abell]], [[Bart Bok]], and [[Carl Sagan]]; philosophers [[Brand Blanshard]], [[Antony Flew]], [[Sidney Hook]], and [[Ernest Nagel]]; authors Isaac Asimov, [[Daniel Cohen (children's writer)|Daniel Cohen]], [[Charles Fair]], [[Martin Gardner]], and [[Phillip J. Klass]]; psychologists [[Ray Hyman]] and [[B.F Skinner]]; and magician [[James Randi]].&lt;ref name="Frazier, K."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frazier|first1=Kendrick|title=Science and the Parascience Cults|journal=Science News|date=May 29, 1976|volume=109|issue=22|pages=346–348+350|jstor=3961111|publisher=Society for Science and the Public|doi=10.2307/3961111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being a long-time writer of fantasy, de Camp did not believe in ghosts in the supernatural sense. His ghosts dwelt only in his mind as memories of his parents. His mother, he wrote in a ''New York Times Magazine'' article, died of an overdose of faith healing.&lt;ref name="Talking to Ghosts" /&gt; When considering claims of UFO sightings, astrology, and other subjects considered moot by the scientific community, de Camp would address the circular logic expressed by enthusiasts by insisting on first-hand, unbiased, measurable data to back up the claims. "In the history of cultism," de Camp said in a [[Science News]] interview, "one is always experiencing a feeling of deja vu."&lt;ref name="Frazier, K." /&gt;

He explained how [[ancient civilization]]s produced structures and [[architecture]] that many considered to be impossible for them, such as the [[Pyramid]]s of [[Ancient Egypt]]. Works in this area include ''[[Lost Continents]]'', ''[[Citadels of Mystery]]'', and ''[[The Ancient Engineers]]''.

Some others of his many and wide-ranging nonfiction works were ''[[The Great Monkey Trial]]'' (about the [[Scopes Trial]]), ''[[The Ragged Edge of Science]]'', ''[[Energy and Power]]'', ''[[The Heroic Age of American Invention]]'', ''[[The Day of the Dinosaur]]'' (which argued, among other things, that evolution took hold after [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] because of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] interest spurred by recently popularized [[dinosaur]] remains, corresponding to [[legend]]s of [[dragons]]), ''[[Great Cities of the Ancient World]]'' and ''[[The Evolution of Naval Weapons]]'' (a United States government textbook).

Published in the July 1938 issue of ''Astounding Science Fiction'', "Language for Time Travelers" won de Camp the first non-fiction readership monthly honor awarded in the magazine for his exploration of the communication difficulties for time travelers as pronunciation and semantics shift over time.&lt;ref name=Moskowitz /&gt;

De Camp's pioneering [[biography|biographies]] of fantasy writers were many short articles and full-length studies of [[Robert E. Howard]] and [[H. P. Lovecraft]], the first major independent biographies of both writers. Matthew Hartman, in a review of de Camp's ''Lovecraft: A Biography'', stated that de Camp "does not defend his subject; he criticizes where criticism is due, and he explains in historical and sociological context, rather than attempting to excuse."&lt;ref name="Hartman, M."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hartman|first1=Matthew|title=De Camp, L. Sprague; Lovecraft: A biography|journal=Library Journal|date=February 15, 1975|volume=100|issue=4|page=387}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Camp's "warts and all" approach to his subjects&lt;ref name=Lehmann-Haupt&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lehmann-Haupt|first1=Christopher|title=Book of the Times: The New England Horror|work=New York Times Book Review|publisher=The New York Times|date=January 29, 1975|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been branded by some [[fan (person)|fans]] as unflattering and unbalanced. For instance, [[Mark Finn]], author of ''[[Blood &amp; Thunder: The Life &amp; Art of Robert E. Howard]]'', contends that de Camp deliberately framed his questions in regard to Howard to elicit answers matching his [[Freudian]] theories about him.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Brian. [http://thesilverkey.blogspot.com/2008/10/blood-and-thunder-life-art-of-robert-e.html "''Blood &amp; Thunder: The Life &amp; Art of Robert E. Howard'': A review"]. October 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Camp also wrote nonfiction radio scripts for [[Voice of America]].&lt;ref name=Thurber /&gt;

==Awards and honors==
De Camp and [[Willy Ley]] won the 1953 [[International Fantasy Award]] for nonfiction recognizing their study of geographical myths, ''[[Lands Beyond]]'' (Rinehart, 1952).&lt;ref name="Power"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SFAwards/&gt; De Camp was a guest of honor at the 1966 [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]]&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; and was named the third [[Gandalf Award|Gandalf Grand Master]] of Fantasy, after [[Tolkien]] and [[Fritz Leiber]], at the 1976 convention.&lt;ref name=SFAwards/&gt; The [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] made him its fourth [[SFWA Grand Master]] in 1979&lt;ref name=SFWA/&gt; and he won the [[World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement]] in 1984,&lt;ref name=SFAwards/&gt; a Special Achievement [[Sidewise Award for Alternate History]] in 1996, citing "seminal works in the field,"&lt;ref name="SWfAH"/&gt; and the [[Hugo Award]] for Nonfiction in 1997 for his autobiography, ''[[Time and Chance: an Autobiography|Time and Chance]]''.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SFAwards/&gt;

At a meeting of the executive council of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI)]] in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] in April 2011, De Camp was selected for inclusion in CSI's Pantheon of Skeptics.  The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pantheon of Skeptics|url=http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|website=CSI|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|accessdate=30 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131054129/http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|archivedate=31 January 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CSI was previously known as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CSICOP becomes CSI after thirty years|url=http://www.csicop.org/about/csi.html|website=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815024758/http://www.csicop.org/about/csi.html|archivedate=15 August 2009|date=20 November 2006|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{In popular culture|date=February 2018}}
L. Sprague de Camp has been depicted in fictional works by a number of other authors. [[Randall Garrett]] conflated him with [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[Gandalf]] in the character of the magician "Sir Lyon Gandolphus Gray" in his [[Lord Darcy]] series. He was the model for the "Geoffrey Avalon" character in Isaac Asimov's fictional group of mystery solvers the "[[Black Widowers]],"&lt;ref name="Asimov1994-120"/&gt; and the unnamed court magician in [[Lawrence Watt-Evans]]' "Return to Xanadu" (''[[The Enchanter Completed: A Tribute Anthology for L. Sprague de Camp]]'', 2005).

He also appears without fictional disguise in the short stories "Green Fire" by [[Eileen Gunn]], [[Andy Duncan (writer)|Andy Duncan]], [[Pat Murphy (writer)|Pat Murphy]], and [[Michael Swanwick]] (''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'', April, 2000) and "Father Figures" by [[Susan Shwartz]] (''The Enchanter Completed: A Tribute Anthology for L. Sprague de Camp'', 2005),&lt;ref&gt;Stableford, Brian. ''Science Fact and Science Fiction: an Encyclopedia''. New York: Routledge, c2006, page 125.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the novels ''[[In the Courts of the Crimson Kings]]'' (2008) by [[S. M. Stirling]] and ''[[The Astounding, the Amazing, and the Unknown]]'' (2011) by [[Paul Malmont]].

A semi-fictionalized version of de Camp appears in the third episode of the 2017 TV series ''[[Manhunt: Unabomber]]'', as one of several academics and authors consulted by the FBI on the basis of the citation of their work in the [[Unabomber manifesto]]. In the scene depicting this meeting, de Camp's name appears on a placard as "L. Sprague de Camp, [[Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America|S.A.G.A.]] Author, ''The Ancient Engineers''." De Camp's name does not specifically appear in the episode credits, which identify the roles of actors in the scene as composite characters. ''The Ancient Engineers'' is cited in endnote 18 of the manifesto.

The '''Lady of the Lake''' is an enchantress in the [[Matter of Britain]], the body of medieval literature and legend associated with [[King Arthur]]. She plays a pivotal role in many stories, including giving Arthur his sword [[Excalibur]], enchanting [[Merlin]], and raising [[Lancelot]] after the death of his father. Different writers and copyists give the Arthurian character the name '''Nimue''', '''Nymue''', '''Nimueh''', '''Viviane''', '''Vivien''', '''Vivienne''', '''Niniane''', '''Niviene''', '''Nyneve''' or '''Nineve''', among other variations.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrook, S. E. "Nymue, the Chief Lady of the Lake, in Malory's Le Morte D’arthur." ''Speculum'' 53.4 (1978): 761-777. JSTOR. NCSU University Libraries, Raleigh, NC. 15 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; At least two different sorceresses bearing the title "the Lady of the Lake" appear as separate characters in some versions and adaptations since the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]] and ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.

==Origins==
Arthurian scholar A. O. H. Jarman, following suggestions first made by scholars of the 19th century, proposed that the name ''Viviane'' in French Arthurian romances was ultimately derived from (and a corruption of) the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word ''chwyfleian'' (also spelled ''hwimleian'', ''chwibleian'', et al. in medieval Welsh sources), meaning "a wanderer of pallid countenance", which was originally applied as an epithet to the famous prophetic "wild man" figure of [[Myrddin Wyllt]] ([[Merlin]]) in [[Medieval Welsh literature|medieval Welsh poetry]], but due to the relative obscurity of the word, was misunderstood as "fair wanton maiden" and taken to be the name of Myrddin's female captor.&lt;ref&gt;Jarman, A. O. H., "A Note on the Possible Welsh Derivation of Viviane," Gallica: Essays Presented to J. Heywood Thomas (Cardiff 1969) 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jarman, A. O. H., "Hwimleian, Chwibleian", Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies 16 (1954-1956) 72-76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Patrick K., "The Death of Merlin in the Chronicle of Elis Gruffudd", Viator: Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Vol 7 (1976), University of California Press, pp. 379-390 (p. 381).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chrétien de Troyes]]'s ''[[Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart]]'', the first story featuring [[Lancelot]] as a prominent character, was also the first to mention his upbringing by a [[fairy]] in a lake. If to accept that the German ''[[Lanzelet]]'' by [[Ulrich von Zatzikhoven]] contains elements of a more primitive version of this tale than Chrétien's, the infant Lancelot was spirited away to a lake by a water fairy (''merfeine'' in [[Old High German]]) and raised in her country of ''Meidelant'' ("Land of Maidens", an island in the sea inhabited by ten thousand maidens who live in perpetual happiness); the fairy queen and her paradise island are reminiscent of [[Morgan le Fay|Morgen]] of the Island of [[Avalon|Avallon]] in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Vita Merlini]]''.

[[File:Beguiling of Merlin.jpg|thumb|Nimue, the Lady of the Lake, shown holding the infatuated Merlin trapped and reading from his book of spells, in ''[[The Beguiling of Merlin]]'' by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] (1874)]]

The Lady of the Lake began appearing in the French [[chivalric romance]]s by the early 13th century, becoming Lancelot's [[fairy godmother]]-like foster mother. The [[Lancelot-Grail]] cycle provides a backstory for the Lady of the Lake, Viviane, in the "[[Merlin (poem)|prose Merlin]]" section, which takes place before the Lancelot Proper, though it was written later. She refuses to give him her love until he has taught her all his secrets, after which she uses her power to trap him forever, originally either in the trunk of a hawthorn tree or beneath a stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=VXRMAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA117|title=The History of King Arthur and of the Knights of Th Round Table|last=Malory|first=Thomas|date=1858|publisher=Smith|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Merlin, through his power of foresight knows beforehand that this will happen, he is unable to counteract Viviane because of the "truth" this ability of foresight holds. He decides to do nothing for his situation other than to continue to teach her his secrets until she takes the opportunity to entrap and entomb him (in a tree, a stone, a cave, or an invisible tower, depending on the story and author).

According to the Vulgate ''Merlin'', it was the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]'s enchantment, given to Dyonas, that caused Viviane to be so alluring to Merlin.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Christopher, The Arthurian Name Dictionary, Routledge, 1999, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; The Vulgate ''Lancelot'' tells us that she was the Queen of Sicily, but considered a goddess by her subjects. The continuation Post Vulgate ''Merlin'' describes how she killed her lover to be with another man, but then she was beheaded by this man as a murderess. This story was later transferred to a lake in France, and was later called the Lake of Diana.

The [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]]'s second Lady of the Lake is called Ninianne, and her story is nearly identical to the one in the Lancelot-Grail, though it adds her bestowal of the magic sword [[Excalibur]] to Arthur. Sir [[Thomas Malory]] also uses both Ladies of the Lake in his ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''; he leaves the first one unnamed and calls the second one Nimue (Nymue). Malory's original Lady is presented as an early benefactor of King Arthur who grants him Excalibur when his original sword is damaged. She is later beheaded by [[Sir Balin]] as a result of a kin feud between them (she blames him for the death of her brother, while he blames her for the death of his mother who was burned at the stake, in addition to for how, as he says, "by enchantment and sorcery she has been the destroyer of many good knights") and a dispute over an enchanted sword. 

The [[Middle English]] romance ''Arthour and Merlin'' casts [[Morgan le Fay]] herself in the role of the Lady of the Lake and residing near a town named Ninniane. The Italian manuscript ''[[Tavola ritonda]]'' (''The Round Table'') makes the Lady a daughter of [[Uther Pendragon]] and a sister to both Morgan and Arthur; here she is a character villainous to the extent that her own brother Arthur swears to burn her.&lt;ref name=cl/&gt; In the 15th-century ''[[Perceforest]]'', the figures of the Lady of the Lake and of the enchantress [[Sebile]] have been merged to create the character of Sebile of the Lake, there the mother of Arthur himself. {{clear left}}

===''Le Morte d'Arthur''===
[[File:CRANE King Arthur asks the lady of the lake for the sword Excalibur.jpg|thumb|left|King Arthur asks the Lady of the Lake for the sword [[Excalibur]] in [[Walter Crane]]'s 1911 illustration for [[Henry Gilbert]]'s ''King Arthur's Knights: The Tales Retold for Boys and Girls'']]
[[File:The Lady of the Lake by Speed Lancelot.jpg|thumb|The Lady of the Lake in [[Lancelot Speed]]'s illustration for [[James Thomas Knowles (1831–1908)|James Thomas Knowles]]' ''The Legends of King Arthur and His Knights'' (1912)]]

The first Lady of the Lake remains unnamed besides this epithet. When Arthur and Merlin first meet this Lady of the Lake, she holds Excalibur out of the water and offers it to Arthur if he promises to fulfill a request from her later. He agrees and receives his famous sword. Later, the Lady of the Lake comes to Arthur's court to receive her end of the bargain; she asks for the head of Sir Balin, who she blames for her brother's death. Arthur refuses this request, and Balin beheads her instead, much to Arthur's distress. 

The second Lady of the Lake is sometimes referred to by her title and sometimes referred to by name. That name has several variations. In [[William Caxton]]'s text of ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', her name appears as "Nymue", "Nyneue" and "Nynyue"; in the Winchester MS, her name appears as "Nynyve" and "Nenyve". Even though "Nymue," with the ''m'', appears only in the Caxton text, it is perhaps the most common name for this Lady of the Lake as the Caxton text was the only version of ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' published until 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrook, S. E. “[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2849785 Nymue, the Chief Lady of the Lake, in Malory’s ''Le Morte Darthur''].” ''Speculum'', vol. 53, no. 4, Oct., 1978, pp. 761-777. ''JSTOR''&lt;/ref&gt;

Nimue appears as the [[chivalric code]] changes; her appearance hints to the reader that something new will happen. This trend follows the logic that Malory is in a conspiracy of sorts with his reader. In this scenario, the author and the reader are in cahoots in order to achieve the wanted interpretation of the Arthurian legend. The first time the character named Nimue appears is at Arthur's wedding. She then appears in many other episodes of Malory's work. Each time the Lady reappears, it is at a pivotal moment of the episode, establishing the importance of her character within Arthurian literature, especially ''Le Morte d'Arthur''. In that work, she transcends any notoriety attached to her character by aiding Arthur and other knights to succeed in their endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrook, S. E. “[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2849785 Nymue, the Chief Lady of the Lake, in Malory’s ''Le Morte Darthur''.]” ''Speculum'', vol. 53, no. 4, Oct., 1978, pp. 761-777. ''JSTOR''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Malory describes Nimue as the "chief Lady of the Lake," and she plays a pivotal role in the Arthurian court throughout the story. Malory's Nymue performs some of the same actions as the Lady of the Lake of his sources, but Malory's Nimue is different in some ways. For instance, in the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle|''Suite du Merlin'']], his source for the earlier parts of ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', the Lady of the Lake traps Merlin in a tomb, which results in his death. She does this out of cruelty and a hatred of Merlin.&lt;ref name=cl&gt;Larrington, Carolyne. ''King Arthur's Enchantresses: Morgan and Her Sisters in Arthurian Tradition.'' I. B. Tauris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', on the other hand, Nimue is still the one to trap Merlin, but Malory gives her a sympathetic reason. Merlin falls 'in a dotage' on her and will not leave her alone. Malory gives no indication that Nimue loves him back. Eventually, since she cannot get rid of him otherwise, she decides to trap him under rock and makes sure he cannot escape. She is tired of his sexual advances, and afraid of his power, so she does not have much of a choice but to ultimately get rid of him.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrook, S. E. “[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2849785 Nymue, the Chief Lady of the Lake, in Malory’s ''Le Morte Darthur''].” ''Speculum'', vol. 53, no. 4, Oct., 1978, pp. 761-777.'' JSTOR''.&lt;/ref&gt; After enchanting Merlin, Malory’s Nimue replaces him as Arthur’s magician aide and adviser. She becomes the lover and eventual wife of Sir Pelleas and mother to his son Guivret. After the [[Battle of Camlann]], she reclaims Excalibur when it is thrown into the lake by Sir [[Bedivere]]. Nimue is one of the magical queens who bear the wounded Arthur away to [[Avalon]], a setting tied to the Lady of the Lake in some literary traditions.

In Malory's text, Nimue is married to Sir [[Pelleas]] and outwardly acts as an obedient wife, while at the same time subtly helping sway the court in the right direction. When Malory was looking at other texts to find inspiration for his characters, he chose the best aspects of all the other Lady of the Lake characters, making her a compassionate, clever, strong willed, and sympathetic character. Nimue does not shrink behind the male figures in her life; instead, she is pragmatic and unflappable. When Arthur is in need in Malory's text, some incarnation of the Lady of the Lake, or her magic, or her agent, reaches out to help him. For instance, she saves Arthur from a magical attempt on his life made by his sister Morgan le Fay and from the death at the hands of [[Accolon]], and together with [[Tristan]] helps him kill an evil sorceress named Annowre. These stories had first appeared in the French romances.{{-}}

[[File:The yellow book - an illustrated quarterly (1895) (14787661353).jpg|thumb|''Merlin and Vivien'' by [[Henry Meynell Rheam|Henry R. Rheam]] (1895)]]

[[Walter Scott]] wrote an influential poem, ''[[The Lady of the Lake (poem)|The Lady of the Lake]]'', in 1810, drawing on the romance of the legend, but with an entirely different story set around [[Loch Katrine]] in the [[Trossachs]] of [[Scotland]]. Scott's material furnished subject matter for ''[[La donna del lago]]'', an 1819 opera by [[Gioachino Rossini]]. [[Franz Schubert]] set [[Schubert's song cycles#Seven songs from Walter Scott's Lady of the Lake|seven songs from Walter Scott's ''Lady of the Lake'']], including the three "Ellen songs" ("Ellens Gesang I",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schubertline.co.uk/Scorchshop/cgi-bin/showscore.pl?e1a.sco |title=Ellens Gesang I |publisher=Schubertline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229080021/http://www.schubertline.co.uk/Scorchshop/cgi-bin/showscore.pl?e1a.sco |archivedate=2013-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Ellens Gesang II",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schubertline.co.uk/Scorchshop/cgi-bin/showscore.pl?e2b.sco |title=Ellens Gesang II |publisher=Schubertline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229080019/http://www.schubertline.co.uk/Scorchshop/cgi-bin/showscore.pl?e2b.sco |archivedate=2013-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Ellens Gesang III"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatscores.com/p/song/sheetmusic/1004045 |title=Ellens Gesang III |publisher=Greatscores.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;), although Schubert's music to [[Ave Maria (Schubert)|Ellen's third song]] has become far more famous in its later adaptation, known as "Ave Maria". 

The full French name of the [[University of Notre Dame]], founded in 1842, is ''Notre Dame du Lac''. This is translated as "Our Lady of the Lake", making reference to [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] as the Lady of the Lake, evidencing fusion between Arthurian legend and middle-Christian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=M. Rible|title=A Comparison of Celtic Myth and Arthurian Romance|url=http://web.stanford.edu/class/engl165b/rible.htm|website=web.stanford.edu|accessdate=27 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Idylls of the King 10.jpg|thumb|Viviane and Merlin in [[Gustave Doré]]'s 1868 illustration for [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s ''[[Idylls of the King]]'']]

[[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] adapted several stories of the Lady of the Lake for his 1859–1885 poetic cycle ''[[Idylls of the King]]''. He too splits her into two characters; Viviane is a deceitful villain who ensnares Merlin, while the Lady of the Lake is a benevolent figure who raises Lancelot and gives Arthur his sword. Some other authors choose to emphasize a single character.

Modern authors of Arthurian fiction adapt the Lady of the Lake legend in various ways, often using two or more bearers of the title. Versions of the Lady (or Ladies) of the Lake appear in many other works of Arthurian fiction, including novels, films, television series, stage musicals, comics, and games. Though her identity may change, her role as a significant figure in the lives of both Arthur and Merlin remains consistent. Some examples of such 20th and 21st century works are listed below.

*Nineue, "Tennyson's Vivien,"&lt;ref&gt;"The characters of the novel" in the various editions of the novel, including London: Macdonald, 1951, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; is a character in [[John Cowper Powys]]'s novel ''[[Porius: A Romance of the Dark Ages]]'' (1951).
*Nimue appears in [[T. H. White]]'s 1958 novel ''[[The Once and Future King]]'' as a water nymph and Merlin's enchantress. True to the legend she traps Merlin in a cave, but Merlin does not convey it as negative, and even refers to it as a holiday.
*The 1960 musical ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' includes the character Nimue who has a song called "Follow Me" performed in Act I. In the play (and the later [[Camelot (film)|film adaptation]]), Arthur "tells Guinevere the story of how he pulled the sword from the stone and became king, and she finally agrees to marry him. The wizard Merlyn is amused by this development, but his joy turns to sorrow as his memories of the future begin to fade. He realizes that Nimue, a beautiful water nymph, has come to draw him into her cave for an eternal sleep. He begs Nimue for answers, as he has forgotten if he has warned Arthur about two important individuals, Lancelot and Mordred. His memories fade permanently, though, and he is led away."
*The Lady of the Lake is satirized in the 1975 film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' in which a peasant named Dennis says, "Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony."
*[[Mary Stewart (novelist)|Mary Stewart]]'s 1979 novel ''[[The Last Enchantment]]'' radically recasts the story of Merlin and Niniane, completely removing the aspect of malicious seduction and treachery dominant in the traditional version. In this depiction Merlin takes Niniane on as an apprentice, with her at first disguised as a boy, and willingly teaches her his magic. When her identity as a woman is discovered, they fall in love despite their age difference. As he gives her the secrets of his psychic abilities and how to control them, he seems to lose them himself &amp;ndash; which Merlin does not mind. In a depleted, weakened condition, he takes ill and falls into a coma, and is believed to be dead. Niniane has him buried within his "crystal cave", where he awakes some time later. He escapes after a few weeks, through a combination of chance luck and ingenious planning, and travels incognito to let Arthur know he is still alive. Niniane takes Merlin's place as the court wizard-seer, while Merlin retires to the crystal cave and lives a quiet and happy life as a hermit.
*[[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s 1983 novel ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'' takes the tradition of multiple Ladies one step further. In Bradley's works, both the ''Lady of the Lake'' and the ''Merlin'' are names of offices in the pagan hierarchy. The Lady of the Lake is the title of the ruling priestess of Avalon, and the Merlin is a [[druid]] who has pledged his life to the protection of Britain. Various characters assume the title of the Lady, including Viviane, Niniane, [[Morgan le Fay]] (called "Morgaine" in this version), and Nimue, a sympathetic and tragic young priestess who falls in love with the Merlin but is duty bound to seduce and lure him to his death &amp;ndash; following which she drowns herself. Even more Ladies of the Lake appear in Bradley's extended ''Avalon'' prequels.
*In [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s 1990s novel series ''[[The Warlord Chronicles]]'', Nimue is an Irish orphan adopted by the British druid Merlin. She becomes Merlin's most adept priestess and lover, but she eventually turns against him and imprisons him, torturing him to reveal the last of his magical secrets. She is a prominent character in the books, being a major love interest for, and finally an adversary to, the series' main protagonist Derfel.
*In the 1995-1996 animated series ''[[Princess Gwenevere and the Jewel Riders]]'', the name of the first season's antagonist Lady Kale, here too a former student of Merlin who magically imprisons him,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=-k6mg3zM24QC&amp;pg=PA326|title=King Arthur in America|last=Lupack|first=Alan|last2=Lupack|first2=Barbara Tepa|date=2001|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created as an anagram of Lady of the Lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=EWQsAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103|title=Arthurian Animation: A Study of Cartoon Camelots on Film and Television|last=Salda|first=Michael N.|date=2013-07-17|publisher=McFarland|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a good Lady of the Lake herself briefly appears in the titular episode "Lady of the Lake" during the finale of the show's second and final season.
*In the 1998 miniseries ''[[Merlin (miniseries)|Merlin]],'' the characters of the Lady of the Lake ([[Miranda Richardson]]) and Nimue ([[Isabella Rossellini]]) are separated, with the former being a goddess-like fae who is the sister of [[Queen Mab]] (also Richardson in a dual role), and the latter being a noblewoman who is the object of Merlin's affections.
**In the 2006 pseudo-sequel ''[[Merlin's Apprentice]]'', Richardson reprises her role as the Lady of the Lake, though she portrays a much different characterization. In this depiction, the Lady is the main antagonist who serves as an enchanter to an army of barbarians who seek to destroy Camelot. The Lady herself wishes to punish Camelot for the way they poisoned her streams and drained her lakes. This miniseries also depicts Merlin's sleep in the cave; as he slept, the Lady used her magic to conceive a son with Merlin ([[Sam Neill]] also reprising his role from the 1998 miniseries), and then enchanted him to sleep for 50 years.
*The [[BBC]] 2008–2012 drama series ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'' also features two characters based on the Lady of the Lake. Nimueh serves as the primary antagonist of the series 1. The character has no connection to Merlin beyond his opposition to her plans, and her only connection to a lake is her use of a location called the Isle of the Blessed. The ninth episode of the series 2 is titled "The Lady of the Lake", wherein a sorceress named [[Freya]] dies and vows to repay Merlin for his kindness to her. In the series 3 finale, Freya, now a water spirit, gives Excalibur to Merlin so that he can give it to Prince Arthur Pendragon. In the series 5 finale, which features the Battle of Camlann, a despondent Merlin casts the sword back into Lake Avalon, where a hand (presumably Freya's) catches it.
*In [[BBC Radio 4]]'s 2013 [[Afternoon Drama]] ''Pilgrim'', the antagonist Birdie (or Mrs Pleasance) is gradually revealed to be responsible for trapping Merlin ("The Drowned Mage") beneath a lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01qsp1v |title=Pilgrim Series 4, Bleaker Lake |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-03-14 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her story draws on that of Nimue.
*The 2017 film ''[[King Arthur: Legend of the Sword]]'' features the Lady of the Lake played by [[Jacqui Ainsley]] in a few scenes. She first appears in the flashbacks of the film as Bedivere tells Arthur how she bounded Excalibur to the Pendragon bloodline after Merlin used it to destroy the Mage Tower. She reappears in a later scene when she catches the sword underwater after Arthur throws it into the lake in shame of his failures; she pulls him underwater and shows him a vision of what his uncle Vortigan would do to England if he did not accept the sword and tells him that only he can prevent it. She then tells him that [[Vortigan]] must be met where sword meets tower and advises him to trust the Mage before returning the sword to Arthur.
*Vivienne is the Lady of the Lake in [[DC Comics]], while Nimue is [[Madame Xanadu]], her youngest sister, and their middle sister is [[Morgaine le Fey (DC Comics)|Morgaine le Fey]] (given name Morgana), and their surname is Inwudu. The Lady of the Lake has appeared in ''[[Hellblazer]]'', ''[[Aquaman]]'', and her sister's series.
**In the 1983 DC Comics series ''[[Camelot 3000]]'', the Lady of the Lake is referred to as Nyneve, and is depicted as a woman with a beautiful body wearing a golden sun-shaped mask. Morgan le Fay sends her to confront the heroes of Camelot. When Nyneve removes the mask, Merlin, upon seeing her face, is unable to resist her and departs, thus removing him from Morgan's path. Later, when he escapes her control, it is revealed that her only facial feature is a gigantic mouth with a long serpentine tongue which Merlin turns against her.
*Nimue appears as one of the primary antagonists in the ''[[Hellboy]]'' comic book series. She is driven mad after the powers she acquired from Merlin give her knowledge of the [[Ogdru Jahad]], prompting the witches of Britain to dismember her and seal her away underground. Resurrected in the present day, she assumes the mantle of the Irish triple war goddess [[the Morrígan]] and assembles an army of legendary and folkloric beings to eradicate mankind. She will appear in the 2019 film ''[[Hellboy (2019 film)|Hellboy]]'', as the main antagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/08/hellboy-milla-jovovich-blood-queen-villain-movie-reboot-david-harbour-neil-marshall-1202144967/|title=Milla Jovovich To Play Blood Queen In ‘Hellboy’ Reboot|website=deadline|date=August 30, 2017|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 2010s anime series ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins (manga)#Anime|Seven Deadly Sins]]'' features Vivian as a supporting antagonist, taking her name without her position as Lady of the Lake. Vivian is a minion of Holy Knight Grand Master Hendrickson, and works toward his goals of unleashing the Demon Clan, mostly due to her obsession with Gilthunder, a handsome young Holy Knight. In the first season, Vivian is eventually defeated by her former master, a female Merlin who is one of the titular Seven Deadly Sins, after a surprise appearance by King Arthur. In the second season, Merlin berates Vivian for her stupidity, explaining that she and Hendrickson really did not know anything about how horrible demons are, and puts a geas on her so she will leave Gilthunder alone.
*Nimue is featured in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] 2010s fantasy series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]''. She appears as the main antagonist in the first half of [[Once Upon a Time (season 5)|Season 5]], portrayed by Caroline Ford. While fleeing from [[Vortigan]], who sacked and burned her village, she meets Merlin and they fall in love. With Merlin being immortal, Nimue drinks from the [[Holy Grail]] so they can be together forever. Afterward, she kills Vortigan, which darkens her magic and turns her into the very first [[Dark Lord|Dark One]]. Nimue breaks Excalibur and Merlin uses one of the pieces to make the Dark One dagger in order to control her. At some point, Nimue is killed and her power is taken. However, she manages to live on in all of the following Dark Ones, appearing to them as a vision. She forms an alliance with [[Captain Hook]], manipulating him into casting the Dark Curse and reviving her and the Dark Ones. She then leads a Dark One invasion in Storybrooke, which ultimately leads to her demise at the hands of Hook, who betrays her to redeem himself. The Lady of the Lake is referenced several times as Lancelot's mother, but she never appears; the episode titled "The Lady of the Lake" does not feature her and instead refers to [[Prince Charming]]'s mother.

== The Lady's lake ==
A number of locations, mostly in Great Britain, are traditionally associated with the Lady of the Lake's abode.&lt;ref name="gulgasht"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gulgasht.com/europe/literary-walk-loch-lomond-trossachs-national-park.html |title=Lady of the Lake |publisher=History |work=Geography |accessdate=September 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925190513/http://www.gulgasht.com/europe/literary-walk-loch-lomond-trossachs-national-park.html |archivedate=September 25, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They include [[Martin Mere]], [[Dozmary Pool]], [[Llyn Llydaw]], [[Llyn Ogwen]], [[Llyn y Fan Fach]], [[The Loe]], [[River Brue|Pomparles Bridge]], [[Beeswing, Dumfries and Galloway|Loch Arthur]], and [[Pergusa Lake]] in [[Sicily]]. In France, she is associated with [[Paimpont forest]], identified as the Arthurian [[Brocéliande]].

'''Mark Dubois''' (born February 24, 1949) began as an environmental activist, initially focusing on saving rivers and has worked to mobilize and engage citizens globally for a vibrant future. In 1972 he co-founded Environmental Traveling Companions (E.T.C.) to offer environmental education and Outward Bound-type trips to disabled persons and disadvantaged youth. In 1973, he co-founded [[Friends of the River]] to fight the flooding of the [[Stanislaus River]] and canyon by the [[New Melones Dam]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Mark Dubois was born in Sacramento February 24, 1949, and in his teen and adult years rafted and explored the Stanislaus River canyon. Being a canyon made of limestone, exploring caves was a significant part of his initial experiences there. At the time, he was only dimly aware that the US Army Corps of Engineers was working on a dam that would eventually flood the river canyon he was falling in love with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Activists|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2001|isbn=0-313-30884-5|editor-last=Mongillo|editor-first=John|location=Westport, CT|pages=83|editor-last2=Booth|editor-first2=Bibi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental Traveling Companions (ETC) ===
In 1972, Dubois co-founded (with Fred Dennis) Environmental Traveling Companions (ETC or "etcetera") to introduce inner city kids to nature through rafting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stanislaus: The Struggle for a River|last=Palmer|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=1982|isbn=0-520-04605-6|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization continues today with the same mission.

=== Friends of the River ===
Friends of the River was born in 1973 from the effort to put an initiative ([http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1252&amp;context=ca_ballot_inits Proposition 17]) on the California ballot to save the river, led by Jerry Meral and Mark Dubois, among others. Although the initiative failed, the act of working to pass it brought together enough individual effort to create the foundation of an organization (some 30,000 volunteers gathered half a million signatures to qualify the initiative).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stanislaus: The Struggle for a River|last=Palmer|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=1981|isbn=0-520-04605-6|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1980 FOR had 3,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stanislaus: The Struggle for a River|last=Palmer|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=1982|isbn=0-520-04605-6|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Rivers Network ===
In 1984, Dubois co-founded the International Rivers Network (now called "International Rivers") after a year-long trip around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conversations.org/story.php?sid=488|title=A Conversation with Mark Dubois: How Do We Wake Up?|last=Whittaker|first=R.|date=26 October 2016|website=Works and Conversations|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group aims to encourage grassroots organizing against large dam projects, and redirecting international funding away from such projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Endangered Rivers and the Conservation Movement|last=Palmer|first=Tim|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2004|isbn=978-0742531406|location=Lanham, MD|pages=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Earth Day 1990 ===
Dubois and Teresa McGlashan were the International Coordinators for Earth Day’s global efforts, coordinating with grassroots groups along with some government and business organizations in the 143 participating countries outside the US. An estimated 200 million citizens participated in Earth Day and Earth Week events around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.uniondemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/UnionDemocrat/LocalNews/story.csp?cid=3714662&amp;sid=753&amp;fid=151|title=Still Active Years After Melones Stunt|last=Morris|first=Mike|date=3 February 2006|work=The Union Democrat|access-date=27 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical and/or political views==
Dubois advocates “heart politics.” Similar to Gandhi’s appeal to our better nature, Dubois notes that individuals respond better to encouragement and appeals to their conscience. He tries to help transform anger into constructive action, and believes that by having fun doing it means that success is more likely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Activists|last=Mongillo|first=John|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2001|isbn=0-313-30884-5|location=Greenwood, CT|pages=84|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honors, decorations, awards and distinctions ==
Dubois gained national attention when he chained himself to a rock beside the rising reservoir behind New Melones Dam in May 1979 to force the Army Corps of Engineers to stop the filling or kill him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stanislaus: The Struggle for a River|last=Palmer|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=1982|isbn=0-520-04605-6|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=160–185|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was at least temporarily successful, as they stopped filling the dam and he came out of hiding.

The '''Mohegan Tribe''' is a [[federally recognized tribe]] and [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|sovereign tribal nation]] of [[Mohegan people]] (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|oʊ|h|iː|g|æ|n}}). Their [[Indian reservation|reservation]] is the '''Mohegan Indian Reservation''', located on the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]] in [[Uncasville, Connecticut]].

Mohegan's independence as a sovereign nation has been documented by treaties and laws for over 350 years, such as the [[Treaty of Hartford (1638)|Treaty of Hartford]] secured by their [[Sachem]] (Chief) [[Uncas]] after his cooperation and victory with the English in the [[Pequot War]] (1637-1638). Although the Treaty of Hartford established English recognition of the tribe's sovereignty in 1638, after the colonial period and loss of lands, the tribe struggled to maintain recognition of its identity. For centuries its people were assumed by whites to have assimilated to majority culture.

The tribe reorganized in the late 20th century and filed a federal land claims suit, seeking to regain land that the state of Connecticut had illegally sold. As part of the settlement, the Mohegan Nation gained [[federally recognized tribes|federal recognition]] by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] in 1994. That year the US Congress passed the ''Mohegan Nation (Connecticut) Land Claim Settlement Act.''&lt;ref name="landclaim"/&gt; The US authorized the cleaned-up United Nuclear site for use as Mohegan [[Indian reservation|reservation lands]], and the property was transferred to the United States in trust for the tribe.&lt;ref name="landclaim"&gt;Mohegan Nation (Connecticut) Land Claim Settlement Act, Pub. L. No. 103-377, § 2, 108 Stat. 3501 (1994) (codified at 25 U.S.C. § 1775 (2006))&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaining a sovereign reservation enabled the Mohegan to establish [[Native American gambling enterprises|gaming operations]] on their lands to generate revenue for welfare and economic development of their tribe. They opened the [[Mohegan Sun]] casino on October 12, 1996, near the former [[Fort Shantok]] site above the Thames River.

==Mohegan Tribe's vision==
In 1997 the Mohegan Tribe's Council of Elders adopted the following Vision Statement:

::We are the Wolf People, children of ''Mundo,'' a part of the [[Tree of Life]]. Our ancestors
::form our roots, our living Tribe is the trunk, our grandchildren are the buds of our future.
::We remember and teach the stories of our ancestors.
::We watch. We listen. We learn.
::We respect Mother Earth, our Elders, and all that comes from Mundo.
::We are willing to break arrows of peace to heal old and new wounds. We acknowledge and learn
::from our mistakes.
::We walk as a single spirit on the Trail of Life. We are guided by thirteen generations
::past and responsible to thirteen generations to come.
::We survive as a nation guided by the wisdom of our past. Our circular trail returns
::us to wholeness as a people.

::.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mohegan.nsn.us/our_vision.htm "Our Vision."] ''The Mohegan Tribe.'' Retrieved 6 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the seventeenth century, the Mohegan were part of the Pequot Tribe, which emerged among Algonquian peoples located in south central present New England.

===Uncas===
The early 1600s were a critical period of change for Connecticut tribes, who spoke various [[Algonquian languages]]. The pressure from rapidly expanding European settlements created competition for land and resources, while new [[infectious diseases]] were decimating Indian populations at an alarming rate. Within the Pequot Tribe at that time, a dispute erupted between the Pequot Sachem (head chief) [[Sassacus]] and the leader [[Uncas]].

Uncas left with his followers, who called themselves the ''Mohegan,'' or Wolf People, like their ancestors. Each tribe had its own idea of how to deal with conflicts with the English and other Europeans. Uncas (1598-1683) became Sachem of the Mohegan Tribe, which favored collaboration with the English colonists. The Pequot under Sassacus chose to fight the colonists, and other local tribes took sides in the [[Pequot War]], which lasted from 1637-1638.

Seeing the great losses brought on by continued fighting, Uncas had befriended the European invaders. This controversial decision brought Uncas and the Mohegan people into an uneasy alliance with the English in the ensuing war with the Pequot (1637-1638). The Mohegan helped the English defeat the Pequot.

Uncas settled his people in a village at Shantok on the Thames River, which the Tribe defended from a [[Narragansett (tribe)|Narragansett]] invasion. It was sparked by related European as well as Indian conflicts. Finally, the Mohegan Tribe's alliance with the English kept its people relatively safe during the colonists attacks on Native Americans during [[King Philip's War]] and afterward.

==Government==
The Mohegan Tribe has created and maintained an independent governmental structure since before Europeans arrived in North America. The Mohegan Government has evolved to exercise full civil and criminal jurisdiction over their lands using the Constitution of the Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut, which they wrote in the 20th century.

The Mohegan Nation is governed by the Mohegan people. They elect a Tribal Council of nine Tribal Members and a Council of Elders, composed of seven Tribal Members. All legislative and executive powers of the Tribe not granted to the Council of Elders are vested with the Tribal Council.

The Council of Elders oversees judicial matters and the tribe's cultural integrity. The Council of Elders also exercises legislative powers with respect to rules governing tribal membership and enrollment. The Tribal Court adjudicates on all non-gaming matters.

Following Congressional passage of the 1988 [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]], the Mohegan Nation used its cooperative relationship with the [[Connecticut|State of Connecticut]] to negotiate a gaming compact, after it had gained federal recognition in 1994 and receiving land in settlement under the ''Mohegan Nation (Connecticut) Land Claim Settlement Act'' (1994).&lt;ref name="landclaim"/&gt; The US took into trust the cleaned-up United Nuclear site for use by the Mohegan as a [[Indian reservation|sovereign reservation]].&lt;ref name="landclaim"/&gt;

The Tribe opened the [[Mohegan Sun]] casino in 1996, two years after gaining federal recognition. The compact created between Connecticut and the Mohegan Tribe secured 25 percent of slot revenues to the state to help fund services. It became a model agreement. Connecticut's Native American tribes have generated the highest revenues  for the state aside from federal government installations. The government-to-government relationships that have developed between Connecticut and Mohegan have enabled quick resolutions to issues that have been raised, such as: regulation of indoor smoking, alcohol service, and state police presence at the reservation.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Community contributions===
The Mohegan Tribe used its own funds to pay for the $35 million access road that enables visitors to reach Mohegan Sun without tying up Montville roads. The tribe has worked closely with its neighbors and provided the funding for an $11 million regional water project in order to ensure safe, clean drinking water.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The tribe has been a strong advocate in the effort to ensure that Connecticut’s communities get a greater share of slots revenues. It proposed a successful initiative to modify the funding formula so that communities most affected by the casinos receive additional funds from the Pequot-Mohegan Fund.

In addition, the Mohegan Tribe pays $500,000 each year to the [[Town]] of Montville in lieu of taxes. The Mohegan Tribe is a partner in the Community Economic Development Fund. The revolving loan program will help regional small businesses create jobs. The tribe is the first and only non-bank investor in such a program in Connecticut.

A member of the Mohegan Tribe sits on the board of trustees for the [[University of Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://boardoftrustees.uconn.edu/members-of-the-board/ "Members of the Board"], University of Connecticut&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
The Mohegan Tribe has used gaming to generate revenue for economic development of the Tribe, its members, and the surrounding communities. Mohegan Sun employs about 10,000 individuals internally, while buying supplies and services from hundreds of small and medium-sized vendors and local companies that also employ thousands of individuals. Employees of the Tribes and Casinos pay all federal and state income taxes as well as other employment taxes, providing tens of millions of dollars to the state and federal governments.

As mandated by federal law and the Mohegan Tribe’s Constitution and laws, profits from Native American gaming go to support the health, education, welfare, and infrastructure of tribal governments. Although tribes are entitled to certain federal grants, by 1997 the Mohegan Tribe was in a position to return or reject funds. That year, it turned back $2.2 million in grant funds to the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) to be redistributed to other Native American nations.

Since its opening in October 1996, the Mohegan Sun has generated substantial revenues for Connecticut’s economy:
*Approximately $2.5 billion in slot revenue contributions to the State of Connecticut
*Over $4 billion is salaries, wages and benefits for employees
*Over $6 billion in goods and services
*Over $200 million in state taxes
*Over $65 million in state services
*Over $18 million in charitable donations

The tribe is a part owner of the [[New England Black Wolves]] [[National Lacrosse League]] franchise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24559">The '''personal life of [[Stanley Kubrick]]:'''

==Marriages and family==

Kubrick married his high-school sweetheart Toba Metz in May 1948, when he was nineteen years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PKMZ4_i60LYC|title=Stanley Kubrick: A Biography|page=31|author-last=Baxter|author-first=John|publisher=Basic Books|date=1997|isbn=0786704853}}&lt;/ref&gt; They lived together in Greenwich Village and divorced three years later in 1951.

He met his second wife, the Austrian-born dancer and theatrical designer [[Ruth Sobotka]], in 1952. They lived together in New York's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] from 1952 until their marriage in January 1955. They moved to Hollywood six months afterwards, where she played a brief part as a ballet dancer in Kubrick's film, ''[[Killer's Kiss]]'' (1955). The following year she was art director for his film, ''[[The Killing (film)|The Killing]]'' (1956). They divorced in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Duncan|title=Stanley Kubrick: Visual Poet 1928-1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XBQi4cCEYNIC|year=2003|publisher=Taschen|isbn=978-3-8228-1592-2|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Kubrick-family-sm.jpg|thumb|Kubrick with his wife, Christiane, and their three daughters, 1960]] --&gt;
During the production of ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' (1957) in [[Munich]], Kubrick met and romanced young German actress [[Christiane Harlan]], who played a small though memorable role. Kubrick married Harlan in 1958, and in 1959 they settled into a home in Beverly Hills with Harlan's daughter, Katherina, age six.&lt;ref name=LoBrutto&gt;LoBrutto, Vincent (1999). ''Stanley Kubrick: a Biography''. Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|165}} They also lived in New York, during which time Christiane studied art at the [[Art Students League of New York]], later becoming an independent artist. Like Kubrick, she wanted "solace to think, study, and practice her craft," writes LoBrutto.&lt;ref name=LoBrutto/&gt;{{rp|224}} They remained together 40 years, until his death in 1999. Besides his stepdaughter, they had two daughters together, Anya and [[Vivian Kubrick|Vivian]].

Shortly after his death, Christiane assembled a personal collection of never-before-seen photographs and commentary into a book, ''Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures''. Included among the photos was only one of Kubrick's family together, taken in 1960.&lt;ref name=Christiane&gt;Kubrick, Christiane. ''Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures'', Little, Brown (2002) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, she gave a videotaped interview with U.K.'s ''Guardian'', where she discussed his personality, his love of editing films, and some reasons why he chose to not make ''Aryan Papers.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Tom Happold and Cameron Robertson |year=2010 |title=Christiane Kubrick: 'Stanley was a great dancer' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2010/aug/10/christiane-kubrick-stanley-dancer |medium=net video |trans_title= |publisher=Guardian UK |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[Jack Nicholson]], who starred in ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980), observed that "Stanley was very much a family man."&lt;ref name=Filmbio&gt;Harlan, Jan (producer/director), ''Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures'', documentary film (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Nicole Kidman]], who starred in ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'' (1999), adds that Christiane "was the love of his life. He would talk about her, he adored her, something that people didn't know. His daughters adored them&amp;nbsp;... I would see that, and he would talk about them very proudly."&lt;ref name=Filmbio/&gt; The opinion was shared by [[Malcolm McDowell]], who starred in ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'': "He was happily married. I remember his daughters, Vivian and Anya, running around the room. It was good to see such a close-knit family."&lt;ref name=Ciment2&gt;Ciment, Michel. ''Kubrick: The Definitive Edition'', Faber and Faber, Inc. (1980; 1999) p. 36, cover&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|287}}

==Settling in the United Kingdom==

[[File:20050613-007-childwickbury.jpg|thumb|left|Kubrick's [[Childwickbury Manor]] in Hertfordshire, England]]
Kubrick moved to the United Kingdom to make ''Lolita'' because of easier financing via the Eady Levy, since at least 85% of the film was shot in the UK, and freedom from censorship and interference from Hollywood studios.

There he set up his life so that family and business were one.&lt;ref name="Howard2000_16"&gt;[[#Howard2000|Howard 2000, p. 16.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Christiane Kubrick told the London ''Times'' how rough New York had become, with children having to be escorted to school by police, people being rude, and smashed glass all over the street.&lt;ref name=LoBrutto/&gt;{{rp|271}} Although he thrived on the manic energy of New York, Kubrick soon adapted to the more genteel atmosphere of Britain.

When he hired [[Peter Sellers]] to star in his next film, ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', Sellers was unable to leave the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0069.html "An Interview with Stanley Kubrick (1969)"]&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick made Britain his permanent home thereafter, although "he never considered himself an expatriate American," notes Walker.&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;Walker, Alexander. ''Stanley Kubrick, Director: A Visual Analysis'', Conundrum Ltd. (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}} He also shunned the Hollywood system and its publicity machine,&lt;ref name="Hare2008_166"&gt;[[#Hare2008|Hare 2008, p. 166.]]&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in little media coverage of him as a personality.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the BBC obituary of him at [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/292302.stm]. See also Walker, 2000, p.360&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 the Kubricks moved to Abbots Mead, Barnet Lane, just south of the Elstree/Borehamwood studio complex. This was a turn of the 19th century house, sold to him by Simon Cowell's father. Kubrick worked almost exclusively from this home for 14 years where, with some exceptions, he researched, invented special effects techniques, designed ultra-low light lenses for specially modified cameras, pre-produced, edited, post-produced, advertised, distributed and carefully managed all aspects of four of his films: ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' (1965 to 1968), ''A Clockwork Orange'' (1969 to 1971), ''Barry Lyndon'' (1972 to 1975) and most of ''The Shining'' (1976 to 1980 - finished the year after he left for Childwickbury Green)

In 1978, Kubrick moved into [[Childwickbury Manor]] in [[Hertfordshire]], UK, a mainly 18th century building about {{convert|48|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} north of London and a 10-minute drive from his previous home at Abbotts Mead. After finishing ''The Shining'' he went on to make ''Full Metal Jacket'' and lastly ''Eyes Wide Shut''. He is interred on its grounds together with his eldest daughter Anya Kubrick.

LoBrutto notes that living in the United Kingdom brought peace to the Kubrick family.&lt;ref name=LoBrutto/&gt;{{rp|328}} After moving to Britain, recalls Christiane, one of the first British radio shows they heard was on gardening. The area's many landscaped parks, gardens and animals was an enormous contrast to New York.&lt;ref name=LoBrutto/&gt;{{rp|335}} "It's very pleasant," said Kubrick, "very peaceful, very civilized here. London is in the best sense the way New York was" in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=LoBrutto/&gt;{{rp|341}}

His friend, screenwriter [[Michael Herr]], points out that he did not live in Britain because he disliked America:
{{quote|"God knows; America was all he ever talked about. It was always on his mind, and in his blood."&lt;ref name=Herr&gt;Herr, Michael. ''Kubrick'', Grove Press (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}}}}

Kubrick's home in the English countryside, a half-hour drive from London, gave him "energy, inspiration, and confidence," states Walker. It provided him with a "favorable psychological climate in which to function," with more privacy and time for reflection.&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;{{rp|27}} Kubrick's close friend, Julian Senior, who was vice president for Warner Brothers' London office, compared Kubrick's lifestyle to "a medieval craftsman whose home was his workshop."&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;{{rp|367}} He did manage to stay up on current affairs, and read the ''New York Times'' daily, notes [[Jan Harlan]], adding that Kubrick remained a "New Yorker" at heart his entire life.&lt;ref name=Rose&gt;[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/3069 "An hour about the life and work of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629151520/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/3069 |date=2014-06-29 }}, Video interview with Charlie Rose, Christiane Kubrick, Martin Scorsese and Jan Harlan. June 15, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home and workplace==

His new home, originally a large country mansion once owned by a wealthy racehorse owner, became a workplace for Kubrick and Christiane. One of the large ballroom-size rooms became her painting studio. Kubrick converted the stables into extra production rooms besides ones within the home that he used for editing and storage.&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;{{rp|368}} Christiane called their home "a perfect family factory."&lt;ref name=LoBrutto/&gt;{{rp|374}}

A film trailer was kept in the driveway, and she took care of keeping visiting crew, staff, and actors, ensuring they were well fed and cared for. They both made special effort to keep their home warm and friendly, yet they shared a need for privacy. She adds, "When Stanley is relaxed he plays chess and likes to be very quiet&amp;nbsp;... Stanley is so gentle, such a shy and sensitive person."&lt;ref name=LoBrutto/&gt;{{rp|374–375}} At home, children and animals would frequently come in and out of the room as he worked on a script or met with an actor. Kubrick's many dogs and cats, toward which he showed an extraordinary affection, were often brought onto film sets or editing rooms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baxter1999|Baxter 1999, p. 31.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diane Johnson]], co-screenwriter of ''The Shining'', notes that he enjoyed sharing his work with his family: "They all worked together, creating art and film on the kitchen table, so to speak&amp;nbsp;... Stanley was in no way an isolated individual, and never excluded his family from what he was doing."&lt;ref name=Ciment2/&gt;{{rp|295}}

Kubrick rarely left England during the remaining 40 years before he died. "He lived a simple (outer) life, and a largely devotional one," writes Herr, who describes his home and workplace:&lt;ref name=Herr/&gt;{{rp|38}}

{{quote|His enormous house was as much a studio as a home, a double studio actually, one for him and his movies and one for his wife, Christiane, and her painting. It was a space of perpetual creative activity. He was thought by the press, and so by the public, to be sequestered there . .&lt;ref name=Herr/&gt;{{rp|38}}}}

Although Kubrick once held a pilot's license, some have claimed that he later developed a fear of flying and refused to take airplane trips.&lt;ref name="Rhodes2008_17"&gt;[[#Rhodes2008|Rhodes 2008, p. 17.]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matthew Modine]], star of ''Full Metal Jacket'', stated that the stories about his fear of flying were "fabricated," and that "he wasn't afraid to fly." He simply preferred spending most of his time in England, where his films were produced and where he lived.&lt;ref name=Modine&gt;[http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/08/07/matthew-modine-full-metal-jacket-app/ "'Full Metal Jacket' at 25: Matthew Modine tries to answer, 'What was Stanley like?'"] ''Entertainment Weekly'', Aug. 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[S Is for Stanley|Emilio D'Alessandro]], a former race-car driver, was his personal assistant at his home workplace for over 30 years, handling much of the day-to-day chores such as driving actors to and from his home. In his 2012 book, ''Stanley Kubrick &amp; Me'', he describes his personal experiences, saying that Kubrick wasn't simply his "employer but his university," and that he was, "really like a father."&lt;ref name=book&gt;[http://www.blackbookmag.com/movies/watch-the-book-trailer-for-stanley-kubrick-me-1.59226 Book trailer for ''Stanley Kubrick &amp; Me''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104152733/http://www.blackbookmag.com/movies/watch-the-book-trailer-for-stanley-kubrick-me-1.59226 |date=2013-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kubrick kept in close contact with business associates in the U.S. and elsewhere, mostly by telephone, calling associates at all hours for conversations that lasted from under a minute to many hours. Many of Kubrick's admirers and friends spoke of these telephone conversations with great affection and nostalgia after his death.&lt;ref name=Herr/&gt;{{rp|64}} Kubrick also frequently invited people to his house, ranging from actors to close friends, admired film directors, writers, and intellectuals. He rarely took vacations, even after completing a major film, and would simply begin preparing for his next one by catching up on seeing movies that had come out during the last year and searching through books and magazines for his next project idea.&lt;ref name=LoBrutto/&gt;{{rp|495–496}}

Kubrick was an early user of desktop computers and had five that he worked with at home.&lt;ref name=Herr/&gt;{{rp|43}}
LoBrutto describes Kubrick's home office:
{{quote|Kubrick's personal office mirrored the pragmatic clutter of his New York apartment. An arsenal of tape recorders facilitate the mammoth shooting script process&amp;nbsp;... the office warehoused an enormous record collection of every recorded modern musical composition available. .&lt;ref name=LoBrutto/&gt;{{rp|282}}}}

Screenwriter [[Michael Herr]] remembers working with him on ''Full Metal Jacket'', in what he describes as Kubrick's home "War Room" which was a large space "crammed with desks and computers and filing cabinets" and "long trestle tables littered" with sketches and idea papers and photos of "streets, pagodas, prostitutes, shrines, and signs."&lt;ref name=Herr/&gt;{{rp|41}}

==Personal characteristics==

His appearance was not well known in his later years, to the extent that a British man named [[Alan Conway]] successfully impersonated Kubrick locally for a number of years.&lt;ref name="Anthony1999"&gt;[[#Anthony1999|Anthony 1999.]] Online at: [https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/mar/14/andrewanthony The counterfeit Kubrick]&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Vincent LoBrutto notes that his privacy led to spurious stories about his reclusiveness, "producing a mythology more than a man," similar to those about [[Greta Garbo]], [[Howard Hughes]], and [[J.D. Salinger]].&lt;ref name=LoBrutto/&gt;{{rp|1}}

[[Michael Herr]], Kubrick's co-screenwriter on ''Full Metal Jacket'', who knew him well, considers his "reclusiveness" to be myth: "[H]e was in fact a complete failure as a recluse, unless you believe that a recluse is simply someone who seldom leaves his house. Stanley saw a lot of people&amp;nbsp;... he was one of the most gregarious men I ever knew, and it didn't change anything that most of this conviviality went on over the phone."&lt;ref name=Herr/&gt;{{rp|3}} He hated being photographed, notes Herr, although he let a few people, including his daughter, Vivian, take a few candids when working.&lt;ref name=Herr/&gt;{{rp|15}} [[Matthew Modine]], who became close friends with Kubrick while working in ''Full Metal Jacket'', describes how others saw him:

{{quote|He becomes like the [[The Wizard of Oz (character)|Great and Powerful Oz]]. This image of Stanley Kubrick is projected onto our consciousness, but he was just a menschy Jewish kid from the Bronx who was hiding behind a curtain.&lt;ref name=tribute&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanley Kubrick: Five legendary stories of the filmmaker 'with the black eyes'|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/11/09/stanley-kubrick-stories/|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Entertainment Weekly Inc|accessdate=20 October 2013|author=Anthony Breznican|date=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Herr also describes his voice and conversational style, noting that he had an "especially fraternal temperament" and quite a few women found him "extremely charming." He adds that despite his living in England, his Bronx accent was still noticeable, but added that his voice was fluent and "melodious". "it was as close to the condition of music as speech can get and still be speech"&lt;ref name=Herr/&gt;{{rp|4–5}}

"Stanley always seemed supernaturally youthful to his friends," writes Herr. "His voice didn't age over the almost twenty years that I knew him [and] he had a disarming way of 'leavening' serious discourse with low adolescent humor&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=Herr/&gt;{{rp|22}} Ciment adds that he was "soft-spoken, with a crisp, surprisingly youthful voice, alternately serious and humorous in tone."&lt;ref name=Ciment2/&gt;{{rp|41}}

{{quote box|width=30em|align=left|quote="There was great tenderness in him and he was passionate about his work. What was striking was his enormous intelligence, but he also had a great sense of humor. He was a very shy person and self-protective, but he was filled with the thing that drove him twenty-four hours of the day."|source=—[[Marisa Berenson]], co-star in ''[[Barry Lyndon]]''&lt;ref name=Ciment2/&gt;{{rp|289}}}}

Kubrick dressed simply, wearing the same style clothes every day: beat chinos, a basic blue work shirt, a ripstop cotton fatigue jacket with many pockets, and a pair of well-worn running shoes. "Many producers and actors thought he dressed like a [[beatnik]]", notes Herr,&lt;ref name=Herr/&gt;{{rp|14–15}} and his wife thought his baggy trousers made him look like a "balloon vendor." His meals were also simple, "he has no time to waste," writes Ciment.&lt;ref name=Ciment2/&gt;{{rp|41}}

His eyes were "dark, focused, and piercing:"
{{quote|He looked out from a perceptibly deep place, and the look went far inside of you, if you were what he happened to be looking at&amp;nbsp;... I know that quite a few people, mostly actors, have unraveled when they got caught in Stanley's beams, even though there was rarely much anger in them. Stanley's look was just so ''deliberate'', cool as functioning intelligence itself, demanding satisfaction, or resolution, of some kind of answer to some kind of problem&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name=Herr/&gt;{{rp|16–17}}}}

According to screenwriter [[Frederic Raphael]], who worked with him on ''Eyes Wide Shut'', "vanity was not his style; he never cited his own work with complacency and often admired other people's. He could be pitiless, but never conceited&amp;nbsp;... he solicited my views quite as if I were some venerable oracle."&lt;ref&gt;Raphael, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; That view was shared by Herr: "Nobody who really thinks he's smarter than everyone else could ask as many questions as he always did,&amp;nbsp;... and trying to see every movie ever made."&lt;ref name=Herr/&gt;{{rp|25}} His inquisitiveness about photography and films started when he was a teenager. He later infiltrated film facilities around New York, hung around editing rooms, laboratories and equipment stores, constantly asking questions.&lt;ref name=Herr/&gt;{{rp|26}}

Herr also notes similarities between Kubrick's temperament and satirist and comedian [[Lenny Bruce]], who was nearly the same age, with their love of jazz, ball games, and their common [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] persona.&lt;ref name=Herr/&gt;{{rp|26}} His temperament as a hipster also reflected Kubrick's likes and dislikes in everyday society. Among those, writes Herr, were his aversions to "waste, haste,&amp;nbsp;... [and] bullshit in all its proliferating manifestations, subtle and gross, from the flabby political face telling lies on TV to the most private, much more devastating lies we tell ourselves." According to Herr, Kubrick felt that "hypocrisy was not some petty human foible, it was the corrupted essence of our predicament&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=Herr/&gt;{{rp|44}}

After he moved to England, Kubrick especially enjoyed watching his favorite TV shows, including ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'', and ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'', thinking they were excellent comedies that portrayed American life. He had friends in the U.S. send him tapes of television shows, along with sports events and news broadcasts.&lt;ref name=Herr/&gt;{{rp|47}} [[Gay Hamilton]], one of the stars in ''Barry Lyndon'', recalls one night she couldn't get his attention while he and [[Ryan O'Neal]] were watching a boxing video he received from the U.S.&lt;ref name=LoBrutto/&gt;{{rp|396}}

"He was fiercely unpretentious," notes Herr. "He was exclusive, he had to be, but he wasn't a snob. It wasn't America he couldn't take. It was L.A."&lt;ref name=Herr/&gt;{{rp|47}} According to Ciment, "social standing means nothing to him and he has no interest in acquiring it; money serves exclusively to guarantee him independence."&lt;ref name=Ciment2/&gt;{{rp|41}}

==Desire for privacy==

Herr points out that most of what people knew about Kubrick came from the press, primarily the entertainment press. Few of the journalists that wrote about his life met him or knew much about it. He rarely gave interviews, "because he thought you had to be crazy to do interviews unless you had a picture coming out," adds Herr, who contrasted this with the many celebrities eager for the spotlight and thought this contributed to the public image of Kubrick as reclusive.&lt;ref name=Herr/&gt;{{rp|70}}

Among the notable aspects of his desire for privacy, in his home and film life, was that he never talked about his movies while they were being made. Nor did he like discussing them even afterwards, except to friends. He most of all avoided discussing their "meaning," notes Herr, because "he believed so completely in their meaning that to try and talk about it could only spoil it" for the listener. "He might tell you ''how'' he did it, but never why." When he was once asked how he thought up the ending for ''2001'', he replied, "I don't know. How does anybody ever think of anything?"&lt;ref name=Herr/&gt;{{rp|70–71}}

This aspect of his penchant for privacy may have also contributed to the negative reviews of many of his films or about him personally. Herr states that "it can never turn out well when a [[Square (slang)|square]] takes a hipster for his subject."&lt;ref name=Herr/&gt;{{rp|77}}
Similarly, Ciment argues that his refusal to "become one of the 'family' may have also "wrecked his chances of ever being honored" in Hollywood as a director, similar to the way [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Orson Welles]] and [[Robert Altman]] were denied Oscars, all of them considered at the time to be "rebels" within the film world.&lt;ref name=Ciment2/&gt;{{rp|43}}

When he did grant interviews, he did so "with good grace and modesty," writes Ciment. A chauffeur would drive reporters to either a pub or to his home office, which was also his editing room. Interviewers would join him in his room "piled high with cans of film, newspapers, files and card-indexes, like some enormous artist's loft in Montparnasse or Greenwich Village – where this 'eternal student' can work away in privacy."&lt;ref name=Ciment2/&gt;{{rp|41}}

==Death==

On March 7, 1999, four days after screening a final cut of ''Eyes Wide Shut'' for his family and the stars, Kubrick died in his sleep at the age of 70, after suffering a massive heart attack. His funeral was held on March 12 at his home estate with friends and family in attendance, totaling approximately 100 people. The media was kept a mile away outside the entrance gate.&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;{{rp|372}}

Alexander Walker, who attended the funeral, describes it as a "family farewell,&amp;nbsp;... almost like an English picnic," with cellists, clarinetists and singers providing song and music from many of his favorite classical compositions. Although [[Kaddish]], the Jewish prayer of mourning, was recited, the funeral had no religious overtones, and few of his obituaries mentioned his Jewish background.&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;{{rp|373–374}}&lt;ref name=Raphael&gt;Raphael, Frederic. ''Eyes Wide Open: A Memoir of Stanley Kubrick'', Ballantine, 1999 pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those who gave eulogies were [[Terry Semel]], [[Jan Harlan]], [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Tom Cruise]]. He was buried next to his favorite tree in [[Childwickbury Manor]], Hertfordshire, England.&lt;ref name="HoldenNYTimes"&gt;[[#HoldenNYTimes|Holden 1999.]] Online at: [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01EFDF103FF93BA35750C0A96F958260 Stanley Kubrick, Film Director With a Bleak Vision, Dies at 70]&lt;/ref&gt; In her book dedicated to Kubrick, his wife Christiane included one of his favorite quotes by [[Oscar Wilde]]:
{{Quote|The tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is young.&lt;ref name=Christiane/&gt;{{rp|12}}}}

'''Roberto Rastapopoulos''' is a fictional character in ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', the comics series by Belgian cartoonist [[Hergé]]. He first appears in the album ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]'' (1934) and is a [[criminal mastermind]] with multiple identities and activities.

==Character history==

===Early development===
A visual prototype for Rastapopoulos appears in ''[[Tintin in America]]'', where he is among the assembled dignitaries at a Chicago banquet held in Tintin's honour.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=50|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=38}} Here he is seated next to the actress Mary Pikefort, an allusion to the real-life actress [[Mary Pickford]].{{sfn|Farr|2007|p=121}} [[Michael Farr]] asserted that this was indeed a depiction of Rastapopoulos, and that it would be expected for a film director to be seated next to a Hollywood actress.{{sfn|Farr|2007|p=121}} The name "Rastapopoulos" had been invented by one of Hergé's friends; Hergé thought it was hilarious and decided to use it.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=53|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=41|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3pp=64–65}} He devised Rastapopoulos as an Italian with a Greek surname, but the character fitted [[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] stereotypes of Jews; Hergé was adamant that the character was not Jewish.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=42|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=64–65}}

[[File:Rastapopoulos prototype in Tintin in America.jpg|thumb|175px|left|The prototype for Rastapopoulos in ''Tintin in America'', seated next to Mary Pikefort.{{sfn|Farr|2007|p=121}}]]

Hergé first introduced the character of Rastapopoulos in ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]'', which was serialised in ''[[Le Petit Vingtième]]'' from 8 December 1932 to 8 February 1934. 
Tintin runs into him at the start of the ''Adventure'' aboard the M.S. Isis, a cruise ship docking at Egypt. Here, Rastapopoulos bumps into the Egyptologist Sophocles Sarcophagus, and threatens to beat him until Tintin intervenes. He then shouts at Tintin, accusing him of being an "Impudent whipper-snapper!"{{sfn|Farr|2007|p=122}} Tintin recognises Rastapopoulos, commenting that he is "the millionaire film tycoon, king of Cosmos Pictures... And it's not the first time we've met..."{{sfn|Farr|2007|p=122}} Later in the story, Tintin runs into Rastapopoulos again, this time running into his desert film set, interrupting an apparent assault on a young woman before realizing that it was only part of the film. Although many of the actors are annoyed, Rastapopoulos is affable, and invites Tintin into his tent where, over a pot of Turkish coffee, Tintin informs him of everything that has happened to him since leaving the cruise ship, Rastapoloulos subsequently providing him with clothes and directions to another village.{{sfn|Farr|2007|p=122}} Farr noted that this idea of the hero mistakenly trusting the villain was one that had been used by [[John Buchan]] and [[Alfred Hitchcock]], the latter of whom was an influence on Hergé.{{sfn|Farr|2007|p=123}}

Rastapopoulos reappears— this time disguised in a trench-coat and hat— at the end of the story, where he and a fakir kidnap the crown prince of Gaipajama in vengeance for the Maharajah's war against the opium trade.{{sfn|Farr|2007|p=123}} Tintin pursues them, and a car chase ensues, before Tintin encounters the still-disguised Rastapopoulos on a rocky mountainside, with the criminal boss apparently falling to his death when the cliff-ledge he is on breaks under his foot.{{sfn|Farr|2007|p=123}}

Hergé reintroduced Rastapopoulos in the following adventure, ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'', which was set in China and dealt with the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]].{{sfn|Farr|2007|p=124}} In one scene, Tintin hides in a Shanghai cinema that is screening ''The Sheik's House'', Rastapopoulos' film that Tintin witnessed being filmed in the preceding story, later learning that Rastapopoulos, currently staying in the city, was the last person to see a famous doctor who Tintin believes could cure the dangerous poison of madness (Although he accepts Rastapopoulos' story that he dropped the doctor off at his house after a party).{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=57}} At the end of ''The Blue Lotus'', Rastapopoulos is exposed as the leader of the international opium smuggling organisation that Tintin had previously battled in ''Cigars'', and is subsequently imprisoned.

===Later appearances===
Rastapopoulos subsequently resurfaces in the guise of the Marquis di Gorgonzola, a millionaire magnate and [[slave trade]]r in ''[[The Red Sea Sharks]]'', having been forced to assume a new identity after he was arrested for his previous crimes. When Tintin, Haddock, and Skut end up on his yacht (a caricature of [[Aristotle Onassis]]  luxurious yacht ''Christina''), he tricks them into getting on Allan's ship, which he later tries to have torpedoed after the crew evacuate and a plan to destroy it in a fire fails. Rastapopulos fakes his death by making his boat sink, while escaping in a submarine from the bottom. 

He later kidnaps the millionaire [[Minor characters in The Adventures of Tintin#Laszlo Carreidas|Laszlo Carreidas]] in ''[[Flight 714 to Sydney]]'' to gain the number of his multi-million Swiss Bank account, concluding that it is easier to steal Carreidas's money than make his own fortune all over again. When he is accidentally injected with truth serum by [[Dr. Krollspell]], he reveals various evil deeds, such as his plan to kill Dr. Krollspell afterwards. He is taken hostage by Tintin. Like Krollspell and Carreidas, he is tied up and gagged with [[sticking plaster]]. Throughout the course of the story he suffers more and more injuries. First when Haddock breaks his gun chasing Rastapopoulos, he throws part of it away, and it hits the hiding Rastapopoulos on the head. When he continues to run away and is called to by Allan, he is distracted and crashes into a tree. He experiences pain to the face when Allan pulls the sticking plaster off. When Allan is about to throw a grenade at Tintin and Co, he remembers that Rastapopoulos wants Carreidas alive and throws it away. Rastapopoulos is caught in the blast, leaving his clothes in tatters. When Allan pulls Carreidas' hat from under a stone head, he accidentally elbows Rastapopoulos, giving him a black eye. Later his bump on the head goes away, which he takes as a good omen. However a piece of rock falls onto his head just after he notices this as the result of an earthquake, causing another bump. When explosives are used by the gang to break through a stone barrier, a volcanic eruption is set off, forcing them to flee from the Island in a rubber dinghy. He and his gang are hypnotized by [[Mik Kanrokitoff]] and taken onto a UFO. What happens next to them is unrevealed.

In the [[unfinished work|unfinished]] ''[[Tintin and Alph-Art]]'', a character often thought to be Rastapopoulos in disguise—under the name of [[List of The Adventures of Tintin characters|Endaddine Akass]]—appears. Although a page revealing Akass to be Rastapopoulos was started (and printed in the 2004 [[Egmont Publishing|Egmont]] edition), as the book was never completed, Rastapopoulos' fate following ''Flight 714 to Sydney'' is unknown.

Rastapopoulos also appears in ''[[Tintin and the Lake of Sharks]]'', an animated film and later adapted into a similarly titled book. In this story written by a friend of Hergé, Rastapopoulos is a criminal gang leader directing operations from a secret underwater base. He is behind numerous robberies of valuable items around the world and plans to steal a duplicating machine invented by Professor Calculus, allowing him to replace the items with perfect fakes so that nobody will know of his crimes. However while trying to escape by submarine after his activities are exposed, he is captured by Tintin and Haddock, and arrested by the Syldavian Police.

Rastapopoulos is also mentioned in ''[[Castafiore Emerald]]'', where it is revealed that the newspaper wanted him to marry [[Bianca Castafiore|Castafiore]].

==Critical analysis==
Michael Farr argued that the relationship between Tintin and Rastapopoulos was akin to that between [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Professor Moriarty]] in [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s stories.{{sfn|Farr|2007|p=121}} Farr thought that Rastapopoulos was the one enemy who "it must be feared, might one day get the better of him."{{sfn|Farr|2007|p=121}}

Later, however, he proves to be a hero in his own right and he and Amy get married. The couple conceive a daughter aboard the Doctor's time machine, the [[TARDIS]], while in the time vortex, but their baby is kidnapped at birth. In "[[A Good Man Goes to War]]", Rory and Amy discover their time-traveler friend [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]]  is actually their daughter Melody Pond. The Doctor and River marry in "[[The Wedding of River Song]]", and Rory becomes the Doctor's father-in-law.
In "[[The Angels Take Manhattan]]", the fifth episode of the [[Doctor Who (series 7)|seventh series]], he and Amy are transported back in time by a [[Weeping Angel]], leading to the couple's departure from the series.

As Amy had initially assumed Rory was gay due to his lack of interest in other women, a teenage Mels ([[Nina Toussaint-White]]) had been the one to inform Amy of Rory's affections. On 21st century Earth, Mels hijacks the TARDIS and directs it to 1938, where she is shot by [[Hitler]] ([[Albert Welling]]) and regenerates into River Song. They learn she is the assailant they saw kill the Doctor in his future.

They witness the Doctor marry River in the alternate universe before returning to the established course of events where the Doctor once again appears to die.

[[Doctor Who (series 7)|Series seven]] opener "[[Asylum of the Daleks]]" (2012) establishes early on that Amy and Rory are set to divorce. The [[Daleks]] kidnap the Doctor to go on a mission for them, as well as kidnapping Rory and Amy on the day they are about to sign their divorce papers because they know the Doctor works better with companions. During the mission, the Doctor engineers a reconciliation between the two. The two discuss their feelings for each other. It is revealed Amy left Rory because she has been infertile since "A Good Man Goes to War", and she knew he wanted children. The Doctor subsequently embarks on sporadic journeys with the Ponds. Rory is said to be 31 years old at the time of "[[Dinosaurs on a Spaceship]]".

They rejoin him as permanent companions prior to their last adventure in "[[The Angels Take Manhattan]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/dw/news/bulletin_111216_01/Farewell_and_Hello|title=Farewell...and Hello!|publisher=BBC|date=16 December 2011|accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this story, Rory is sent back to 1930s New York by a [[Weeping Angel]], where he encounters River, and is tracked there by the Doctor and Amy, where he finds himself repeatedly the victim of Weeping Angels repeatedly attacking him and dislocating him in space and time. It is discovered he is in an Angel "battery farm", where they intend to trap him until he dies of old age. Rory even encounters his dying older self there. Amy and Rory jump from a building to create a paradox and destroy the Angels, but one survives and sends Rory back in time. Amy chooses to let it send her back in time as well, and due to the massive paradox the Doctor can never reunite with them. From a tombstone he learns that Rory died at age 82, and Amy at 87. The website-only epilogue "[[P.S. (Doctor Who)|P.S.]]" later reveals that Rory and Amy adopted a son, in 1946, and named him Anthony Brian Williams. His middle name was chosen after Rory's father, Brian, to whom Rory sent a letter in "P.S.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00zn6ff Information on "P.S." on ''Doctor Who'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casting and characterisation==
For his audition, Arthur Darvill received two scenes from the first episode and one from the sixth, but beyond the fact Rory was Amy's boyfriend he was not informed of details of the character.&lt;ref name="DS 2010"&gt;{{cite web|first=Neil|last=Wilkes|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/s7/doctor-who/tubetalk/a217084/arthur-darvill-talks-doctor-who.html|title=Arthur Darvill talks 'Doctor Who'|publisher=Digital Spy|date=4 May 2010|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead writer and executive producer [[Steven Moffat]] stated that what stood out about Darvill's audition was "just how funny" he was.&lt;ref name="con 5.7"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Arthurian Legend|series=[[Doctor Who Confidential]]|airdate=15 May 2010|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Three]]|seriesno=5|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darvill felt "privileged" to be part of the show, and was pleased with Rory's storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Catriona|last=Wightman|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a222357/darvill-doctor-who-role-is-brilliant.html|title=Darvill: 'Doctor Who role is brilliant'|publisher=Digital Spy|date=28 May 2010|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darvill had previously worked with Matt Smith on a play called ''Swimming with Sharks''.&lt;ref name="SFXDarvill"&gt;{{cite web|first=Nick|last=Setchfield|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2010/05/14/rory-time/|title=Rory Time|work=SFX|date=14 May 2010|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a regular with "[[A Christmas Carol (Doctor Who)|A Christmas Carol]]";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/dw/news/bulletin_111216_01/Farewell_and_Hello|title=Farewell...and Hello!|publisher=BBC|date=16 December 2011|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darvill had his "fingers crossed" that he would become a regular.&lt;ref name="fingers crossed" /&gt;

Rory was a character who was "completely in love" with Amy, but Amy had things to do in life before admitting she loved him too. Moffat described Rory as someone who had grown up in the "shadow" of Amy's imaginary Doctor.&lt;ref name="con 5.1"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Call Me the Doctor|series=[[Doctor Who Confidential]]|airdate=3 April 2010|seriesno=5|number=1|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Three]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rory became a nurse because of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/doctor-who/videos/insider-part-4-the-companions-2011-behind-the-scenes/|title=Insider Part 4 - The Companions 2011 Behind-the-Scenes|publisher=[[BBC America]]|date=21 April 2011|format=Video|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rory eventually  evolves into a "bumbling action hero".&lt;ref name="mans up"&gt;{{cite web|first=John|last=Naughton|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-04-23/interview-arthur-darvill---rory-mans-up|title=Interview: Arthur Darvill&amp;nbsp;— Rory mans up|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=23 April 2011|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bumbling"&gt;{{cite web|first=Morgan|last=Jeffery|first2=Chris|last2=Allen|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/s7/doctor-who/interviews/a336645/doctor-who-arthur-darvill-interview-rory-is-a-bumbling-action-hero.html|title='Doctor Who' Arthur Darvill interview: 'Rory is a bumbling action hero'|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=24 August 2011|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking of Rory's characterisation in the first series, actor Darvill felt that he was "on the outside looking into this world he was desperately trying to save Amy from."&lt;ref name=DarvillPress&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2011/04_april/05/doctorwho5.shtml|title=Doctor Who: Arthur Darvill plays Rory Williams|publisher=BBC|date=5 April 2011|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Executive producer]] [[Steven Moffat]] had intended to have a married couple on the TARDIS "from the off".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2011/04_april/05/doctorwho2.shtml|title=Doctor Who: Interview with Steven Moffat|publisher=BBC|date=5 April 2011|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darvill stated of the couple's marriage that Amy will always "wear the trousers". However, he felt that Rory's marriage had stopped the character "feeling so unworthy." In regards to how Rory changed between series five and six, Darvill stated that "his sense of adventure has awoken" and that he is more comfortable with himself.&lt;ref name=DarvillPress/&gt;

==Reception==
Rory's frequent deaths in the programme have been subject to criticism. [[Digital Spy]] reviewer Morgan Jeffery wrote, "One of the key elements in ''Doctor Who'' is obviously the sense of danger and the lingering presence of death, but Rory's repeated demises and resurrections are now becoming so frequent that comparisons to ''[[South Park]]''{{'s}} [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] seem almost inevitable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Morgan|last=Jeffery|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a318129/doctor-who-review-the-curse-of-the-black-spot.html|title='Doctor Who' review: 'The Curse of the Black Spot'|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=7 May 2011|accessdate=17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review for "The Doctor's Wife", Neela Debnath of ''[[The Independent]]'' announced that "Rory-gets-killed fatigue has now officially set in".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Neela|last=Debnath|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/05/16/review-of-doctor-who-%E2%80%98the-doctor%E2%80%99s-wife%E2%80%99/|title=Review of Doctor Who 'The Doctor's Wife'|work=[[The Independent]]|date=16 May 2011|accessdate=17 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JGYdmczP?url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/05/16/review-of-doctor-who-%E2%80%98the-doctor%E2%80%99s-wife%E2%80%99/|archivedate=30 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, ''[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]'' awarded Rory the third spot in the top 10 resurrections of science fiction TV, saying that "it's becoming a cliché. But it's not one we mind too much, mainly because it's always done with such gusto. Except, perhaps, in [[The Curse of the Black Spot|the pirates episode]] which was a fairly gusto free zone all round".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2011/05/24/top-10-resurrections/8/|title=Top 10 Resurrections: Rory Williams|work=SFX|date=24 May 2011|accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, critics have celebrated the increased opportunities for Rory to be heroic in series 6. Following the airing of "[[A Good Man Goes to War]]", [[io9]]'s [[Charlie Anders|Charlie Jane Anders]] compared the character to [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce]] ([[Alexis Denisof]]), whose arc in the American television programmes ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' similarly saw him transition from laughable comic relief to a genuine warrior. Anders comments: "We're thrilled that Rory is getting his Wesley Wyndam-Pryce on. Badass Rory is, as we already observed, totally badass."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5809803/what-do-doctor-who-and-the-dark-knight-have-in-common|last=Anders|first=Charlie Jane|work=[[io9]]|accessdate=2 July 2011|date=11 June 2011|title=What do Doctor Who and The Dark Knight have in common?|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sam McPherson of [[Zap2it]] believed that Rory had the most character development of the characters in the fifth series, evolving into a "generally enjoyable character".&lt;ref name="fingers crossed"&gt;{{cite web|first=Sam|last=McPherson|url=http://www.tvovermind.com/doctor-who/darvill-fingers-crossed-to-be-who-regular/26810|title=Darvill: Fingers Crossed to be 'Who' Regular|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|date=23 July 2010|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Radio Times]]'' blog singled the character out for praise: "As a traveller in the Tardis, Rory probably speaks for the audience far more than past companions have. Sure, we all like to think we'd spring into action just like the Doctor. But in truth, if we joined an eccentric alien on a journey through time and space, we'd probably be more Rory than [[Rose Tyler|Rose]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-06-08/rory-williams--the-heart-of-the-tardis/|last=Pledger|first=Laura|work=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=6 July 2011|date=8 June 2011|title=Rory Williams- the heart of the TARDIS|publisher=[[Radio Times]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2015 Michael Hogan of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' criticised the general portrayal of male companion figures in ''Doctor Who''. He described Rory, alongside 2005-2006 character [[Mickey Smith]] ([[Noel Clarke]]) and 2014 character [[Danny Pink]] ([[Samuel Anderson (actor)|Samuel Anderson]]) as all "basically soppy, sappy, slightly annoying plus-ones to far superior females".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doctor Who: the 10 best things (and 10 worst things) since the reboot|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/doctor-who/11496043/Doctor-Who-the-ten-best-things-and-ten-worst-things-since-the-reboot.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|last=Hogan|first=Michael|date=26 March 2015|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rory was named "TV Character of the Year" in the [[Virgin Media]] TV Awards in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginmedia.com/tvradio/features/vm-tv-award-winners.php?page=2|title=TV Character of the Year|publisher=[[Virgin Media]]|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''SFX'' named Amy and Rory the second-best science fiction and fantasy romance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dave |last=Golder |url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2012/02/14/sci-fi-fantasy%e2%80%99s-14-greatest-romances/13/ |title=Sci-Fi &amp; Fantasy's 14 Greatest Romances |work=SFX |date=14 February 2012 |accessdate=14 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120914170900/http://www.sfx.co.uk/2012/02/14/sci-fi-fantasy%E2%80%99s-14-greatest-romances/13/ |archivedate=14 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Estandarte Real de España.svg|thumb|right|The Royal Standard of Spain]]

The '''Royal Standard of Spain''' (''Estandarte Real or Estandarte del Rey'') is the official [[Heraldic flag|flag]] of the [[King of Spain]]. It comprises a crimson square, traditional colour of both [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] and [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarchs]], with the [[Coat of arms of the King of Spain|coat of arms of the King]] in the center. It is raised over the official royal residence in [[Madrid]], the [[Palacio de la Zarzuela]] and other [[Spanish royal sites]], when the monarch is in residence and displayed on his official car as small flag. The current flag was adopted when [[Felipe VI]] acceded the throne as King of Spain on 19 June 2014. The Royal Standard is regulated by Rule 2 of Royal Decree 527/2014, 20 June, an amendment to Title II of Spanish Royal Decree 1511/1977 adopting Flags, Standards, Guidons, Insignia and Emblems Regulation.&lt;ref name="BOE527"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2014/06/21/pdfs/BOE-A-2014-6525.pdf |title=Real Decreto 527/2014, de 20 de junio, por el que se crea el Guión y el Estandarte de Su Majestad el Rey Felipe VI y se modifica el Reglamento de Banderas y Estandartes, Guiones, Insignias y Distintivos, aprobado por Real Decreto 1511/1977, de 21 de enero. |date=20 June 2014 |website= BOE Spanish Official Journal|series= |publisher= |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= Spanish|trans-title=Royal Decree 527/2014 setting up the Guidon and Standard of HM King Felipe VI and amends Standards, Guidons, Insignia and Emblems Regulation, adopted on Royal Decree 1511/1977|accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Royal Guidon==
[[File:Guión del Rey de España.svg|thumb|150px|Royal guidon since 2014]]

The [[Colours, standards and guidons|Royal Guidon]] (''Guión''), the military personal ensign, was also adopted on 19 June 2014. It is described by Rule 1 of Royal Decree 527/2014, an amendment to Title II, Rule 1 of Spanish Royal Decree 1511/1977.&lt;ref name="BOE527" /&gt;[[File:Pendón de la Nueva España.jpg|thumb|left|210px|A historical royal standard used in the viceroyalty of [[New Spain]].]]

It is similar to the Royal Standard except the Royal Guidon has a gold surround. It is made of [[Taffeta|silk's taffeta]] and measures 80 x 80&amp;nbsp;cm in size. It is the personal command sign or positional flag of the monarch and traditionally was carried with him. The proportions of the coat of arms are smaller than on the standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldo.es/noticias/nacional/2014/06/19/felipe_cuenta_con_escudo_guion_propios_294797_305.html |title=Felipe VI ya cuenta con escudo y guión propios |language=Spanish |trans-title=Felipe VI has his own coat of arms and guidon |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 19 June 2014|website=www.heraldo.es |publisher= |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical standards, guidons and banners of arms of Spanish monarchs==
The heraldic standard, also known as the ''pendón real'', has been, as in other European monarchies, the personal flag of the Spanish monarchs and has been used in events of greater solemnity. It was formed by the elements of the monarch's shield without the exterior adornments and has not recovered since its disappearance in 1931.

The royal standard is the personal banner of the monarch. The [[Military colours, standards and guidons|guidon]], of military use, was formed from the reign of Philip II by the same elements of the standard but incorporating the [[Cross of Burgundy]], a fringe and a ''cordoncillo''. During the period of the [[House of Austria]], the Cross of Burgundy did not appear frequently in the royal standard. The [[Catholic Monarchs]] and [[Charles I of Spain|Charles I]] (as monarchs of Castile) used the guidon of the Castilian monarchs, the ''[[Banda de Castilla]]'' which was a square flag of crimson color in which there was a band between two dragons. The Catholic Monarchs included in the Band of Castile the yoke and arrows which were replaced with the [[Columns of Hercules]] during the reign of Charles I. [[Fernando the Catholic]] also used the guidon that corresponded to him as monarch of Aragon. The Catholic Monarchs also frequently used, since 1492, a banner that consisted of a white cloth with their coat of arms.

==History==
*The [[Heraldic flag#Banner|Banner]] is the ceremonial ensign of the monarch and the royal standard or royal Ffag is his ensign for public use.
*From [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]'s reign the Royal Guidon was the same as the royal standard or royal flag with a [[Cross of Burgundy Flag|cross of Burgundy]] and gold surround.

Quarterly, 1 and 4. quarterly Castile-León, 
2 and 3. per pale Aragon and Argon-Sicily.

After the 1492 Conquest of Granada, the kingdom was represented in the Royal [[Division of the field|Arms]] by the addition ''enté en point'' of Granada's arms.

The heraldic banner has long been used by the [[Catholic Monarchs]] as their military [[ensign]].

Hence the arrangement became, quarterly: 1. and 4. grand quarters, quarterly: A. and D. quarterly Castile-León, B. and C. per pale Aragon-Sicily, the grand quarter enté en point for Granada; 2. and 3. grand quarters, quarterly Austria, Burgundy ancient, Burgundy modern, Brabant, with an escutcheon per pale Flanders and Tyrol. In 1518 their son [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] (Charles V as [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) adopted a banner of arms that comprised these arms on a crimson background. The arms were crowned with the old royal crown (an open crown). After his election as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519 Charles used more often the [[Flag of Germany#History|imperial banner]]: A shield with his own arms surmounting a black double-headed eagle on a golden background.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/79116109436800729754491/207731_0004.pdf The Standard of Charles I of Spain, Cervantesvirtual.com (Cervantes Virtual Library) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally Philip II used the simplified arms as devised for his father, namely per fess with the Spanish quarters in chief and the Austrian quarters in base.

After the [[Iberian Union|dynastic union]] with [[Portugal]] in 1580, the arms of the Monarchy became per fess, in chief per pale, A. quarterly [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of León|Leon]], B. per pale [[Aragon]] and Aragon-[[Sicily]], the whole enté en point [[Granada]] and with an escutcheon of [[Portugal]] on the honor point; in base quarterly [[Austria]], [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] ancient, Burgundy modern and [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], with an escutcheon (in the nombril point) per pale [[Flanders]] and [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]].

He introduced changes in the [[Coat of Arms of the King of Spain|royal arms]] of Spain. The king's new arms were designed by the French heraldist [[Clairambault]] in November 1700, and were as follows:

Per fess: 1. per pale, quarterly Castile and Aragon, enté en point Granada, and per pale, Aragon and Aragon-Sicily; 2. Quarterly, Austria, Burgundy ancient, Burgundy modern and Brabant; enté en point, per pale Flanders and Tyrol. Overall an escutcheon [[Anjou]].

Quarterly of six (in three rows of two each): 1. per pale Aragon and Aragon-Sicily; 2. per pale Austria and Burgundy modern; 3. Farnese 4. Medici; 5. Burgundy ancient; 6. Brabant; enté en point per pale Flanders and Tyrol. Overall an escutcheon quarterly of Castile and León enté en point of Granada, overall Anjou. The royal arms were removed by the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|revolution of 1868]]. When the Bourbons were restored with [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]], a decree (8 January 1875) recovered the coat of arms (and the banner of arms) as it stood until 29 September 1868 as personal arms. In 1930 [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]], substituted the Aragon quarter with [[Jerusalem]]. The Spanish Monarch hasn't used a Banner of Arms since 14 April 1931, when the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was proclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/es_r1761.html  The Royal Banner 1761- 1868, 1874–1931] ([[Flags of the World]])&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salome Sellers''' (''née'' '''Sylvester'''; January 1{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}, 1800 &amp;ndash; January 9, 1909) was an American centenarian who was the last known survivor from the [[18th century]].

==Biography==
Salome Sylvester was born in [[Deer Isle, Maine]] (then part of [[Massachusetts]]), the daughter of Edward and Deborah (''née'' Cushman) Sylvester. She grew up on Deer Isle and married Joseph Sellers on 23 December 1830. The couple had six children together, Salome outliving all but her oldest son, William. She was widowed in 1865.

Due to her unusually long life, Salome was often featured in local newspapers and visited by people interested in her long life, something Salome once expressed as, "I've lived too long. I'm only a curiosity now for people to come and stare at".

Salome Sellers died in the same house she and her husband had built in 1830 in Deer Isle, Maine on 9 January 1909, aged 109 years, 8 days. Her house is now known as the [[Salome Sellers House]] and home to the Deer Isle-Stonington Historical Society. There has also been a book written about her life: "An Island Woman: Salome Sylvester Sellers, 1800-1909".

'''Samuel Crompton''' (3 December 1753 &amp;ndash; 26 June 1827) was an English [[inventor]] and pioneer of the spinning industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/1348913|title=Samuel Crompton, the inventor of the spinning mule : a brief survey of his life and work, with which is incorporated a short history of Messrs. Dobson &amp; Barlow in SearchWorks|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building on the work of [[James Hargreaves]] and [[Richard Arkwright]] he invented the [[spinning mule]], a machine that revolutionised the industry worldwide.{{sfn|Timmins|1996|pp=21,24}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fashion-Handbook-Media-Practice/dp/0415255805|title=The Fashion Handbook|first=Tim|last=Jackson|date=4 May 2006|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=30 January 2017|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Samuel Crompton was born in [[10 Firwood Fold]], [[Bolton]], [[Lancashire]] to George and Betty Crompton (née Elizabeth Holt of Turton). His father was a caretaker at nearby [[Hall i' th' Wood]]. Samuel had two younger sisters. While he was a boy he lost his father and had to contribute to the family resources by spinning [[yarn]], learning to spin on [[James Hargreaves]]'s [[spinning jenny]].{{sfn|Baines|1835|p=159}} The deficiencies of the imbued him with the idea of devising something better, which he worked on in secret for five or six years. The effort absorbed all his spare time and money, including that which he earned by playing the [[violin]] at the Bolton theatre.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

On 16 February 1780 at Bolton Parish Church, Crompton married Mary Pimlott (or Pimbley). They had eight children including George Crompton (born 8 January 1781), who followed in the family business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/is-there-a-tweaker-driving-innovation-on-your-team/|title=Is There a Tweaker Driving Innovation On Your Team?|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spinning mule==
{{main article|Spinning mule}}
[[Image:Mule-jenny.jpg|thumb|left|The only surviving example of a spinning mule built by the inventor Samuel Crompton]]
About 1779, Samuel Crompton succeeded in producing a mule-jenny, a machine which spun yarn suitable for use in the manufacture of [[muslin]].{{sfn|Baines|1835|p=199}} It was known as the ''muslin wheel'' or the ''Hall i' th' Woodwheel'',{{sfn|Baines|1835|p=202}} from the name of the house in which he and his family now lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Samuel Crompton 1753 - 1827 | url = http://www.bolton.org.uk/samuelcrompton.html | accessdate = 2008-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mule-jenny later became known as the [[spinning mule]]. There was a strong demand for the yarn which Crompton was making at Hall i' th' Wood but he lacked the means to take out a [[patent]]. The prying into his methods forced Crompton to choose between destroying his machine or making it public. He adopted the latter alternative after promises by a number of manufacturers to pay him for the use of the mule but all he received was about £60. {{sfn|Baines|1836|p=199}} He then resumed spinning on his own account, but with indifferent success. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The mule-jenny twisted the rovings using rollers in the manner of Arkwright's frame, while the spindle carriage moved back and forth 54 inches to stretch the thread, and then to gather it in the spinning spindles in the manner of Hargreaves jenny. {{sfn|Baines|1835|p=198}} The mule's importance was that it could spin thread better than could be done by hand, which led to ever finer thread. Coarse thread (40s) sold for 14 shillings per pound whilst (80s) spun on his mule sold at 42 shillings a pound.{{sfn|Baines|1835|p=201}}
[[File:Hall i' th' Wood lithograph.jpg|thumb|right|''"This view of [[Hall i' th' Wood|THE HALL ITH' WOOD NEAR BOLTON]]. (where Samuel Crompton invented the first [[Spinning Mule|SPINNING MULE]]) ...respectfully dedicated to the COTTON SPINNERS OF LANCASHIRE."'' lithograph by F. Jones (Day &amp; Son, Lithographers to the [[Queen Victoria|Queen]]), after [[Selim Rothwell]]]]
As the mule was unpatented others soon manufactured it. The machine was constructed in iron, power was applied to assist the inward motion in 1790{{sfn|Baines|1835|p=199}} and by 1834 it was fully automatic or self-acting.{{sfn|Baines|1835|p=207}} A survey in 1812 showed there were between 4 and 5 million mule spindles in use. Crompton received no [[royalties]] for his invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harvard-primosb.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do;jsessionid=B4E528FA48C12C33995118226FB325C6?ct=facet&amp;fctN=facet_tlevel&amp;fctV=available_onsite&amp;rfnGrp=show_only&amp;indx=1&amp;fn=search&amp;vl(51615747UI0)=sub&amp;vl(1UI0)=exact&amp;dscnt=0&amp;scp.scps=scope:(HVD_VIA),scope:(HVD_FGDC),scope:(HVD),primo_central_multiple_fe&amp;fctV=available&amp;vid=HVD&amp;mode=Basic&amp;ct=facet&amp;rfnGrp=show_only&amp;tab=everything&amp;vl(179374061UI1)=all_items&amp;fctN=facet_tlevel&amp;vl(freeText0)=Crompton,%20Samuel,%20--%201753-1827.&amp;dstmp=1471300047345|title=Crompton, Samuel, 1753-1827.|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Baines|1835|p=203}}

In 1800, a sum of £500 was raised for his benefit by subscription, and when in 1809, [[Edmund Cartwright]], the inventor of the [[power loom]], obtained £10,000 from parliament, Crompton was determined to apply for a grant. In 1811, he toured the manufacturing districts of Lancashire and Scotland to collect evidence showing how extensively his mule was being used, and in 1812 parliament awarded him £5000.{{sfn|Baines|1835|p=203}} With the aid of this money, Crompton started a business as a bleacher and then as a cotton merchant and spinner, but without success. In 1824, some friends and members (including Isaac and Benjamin [[Dobson &amp; Barlow|Dobson]], [[Benjamin Hick]], [[John Kennedy (manufacturer)|John Kennedy]] and [[Rothwell, Hick and Rothwell|Peter Rothwell]]) of Bolton's Black Horse "prosecution" Club, bought him an [[Annuity (finance theory)|annuity]] of £63 without his knowledge.&lt;ref name=brit&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Crompton, Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collingwood|title=Black Horse Hotel, Blackhorse Street|url=http://lostpubsofbolton.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/black-horse-hotel-blackhorse-street.html|website=Lost Pubs of Bolton|publisher=Blogger|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crompton died at his house in King Street, Bolton on 26 June 1827, and was buried at the parish church of [[St Peter's Church, Bolton|St Peter's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Manchester Engineers and Inventors | url = http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/celebs/engineers1.html | accessdate = 2008-04-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100803034918/http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/celebs/engineers1.html | archivedate = 3 August 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Seidenbeutel brothers''' were Polish Jewish artists who were twins. '''Efraim Seidenbeutel''' and '''Menasze Seidenbeutel''' were born on December 7, 1907. They were killed in 1945, at the [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]]. They had two brothers who were also artists: Józef, the oldest, was a painter and Hirsz, the youngest, was a sculptor.

==Background==
The Seidenbeutels are considered "Interwar Artists" and painted in the [[Post-expressionism]] of [[School of Paris|École de Paris]]. They painted mostly landscapes and still life scenes. The twins had a unique way of working; one brother would start a painting and the other brother would finish it. They would sign the painting with just their surname. Even the works the twins created separately have an almost identical style.

==Biography of the twins==
The Seidenbeutels were born in [[Warsaw]]. Their father, Abraham, was a textile trader, and their mother took care of the eight children. Efraim's and Menasze's six siblings included Józef, the oldest, who was also a painter and Hirsz, who was younger and was a sculptor.

===Education===
The Seidenbeutels signed up for painting studies in 1921, at the Municipal School of Decorative Arts. In 1922, their sculpture titled “The Portrait of Anski” was shown at the 4th Exhibition of Paintings and Sculptures organized by the Jewish community. Thereafter, they became students at the [[Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw]], where they belonged to the elitist group "Four" set up by the Rector [[Tadeusz Pruszkowski]]. Monika Żeromska{{who|date=May 2016}} remembers that the twins enrolled in school as one student, paid one fee, and took turns attending classes.

===The pre-war years===
The Seidenbeutels had their own studio at the Jewish dorm on Sierakowskiego Street in the Warsaw district of [[Praga]]. Frequently, they would go on field trips to small villages and paint [[en plein air]]. One of the towns they visited frequently was [[Kazimierz Dolny]]. During the late 1920s and early 1930s they would arrive for a 'season' carrying over 24 stretched canvases each, and complete them in 30–60 days. These canvases would be exhibited in Warsaw and [[Krakow]], and would sell out. They met with other artists and inspired younger ones, such as [[Chaim Goldberg]]. They met Goldberg when he was eleven years-old and bought his en plein air [[gouache]]; it was Goldberg's first sale.

===The Holoucaust Years===
During World War II and the [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation, the Seidenbeutels were confined within the [[ghetto]] in [[Białystok]] where they worked at the House of Art in the army. They may have belonged to a group of painters, set up by Oskar Steffens, who copied reproductions of paintings by old masters. The twins were later sent to the [[Stutthof concentration camp]], from which they were marched to the death camp in Flossenbürg. They were executed by the camp’s guards one day before the camp was liberated. Izaak Celnikier, also a painter, was a witness to their deaths.

==Their unique bond==
The Seidenbeutels had a unique bond that intrigues experts to the present day. One brother would start a painting while the other completed it, and the signature was their surname. They signed their paintings this way even when completing a painting individually.

Their similar looks became the subject of jokes, the most popular of which is the following:
{{Quote|text=
"They were united forever except when they visited the hairdresser’s. The secret is that after agreeing on a desired hairstyle one of them enters the salon and, sitting back in the armchair, gets a hairdresser to cut his hair as he becomes absorbed in reading an illustrated magazine. After a gorgeous haircut is done, with hair gel and eau de cologne added, he makes a payment, not forgetting a tip, and he leaves the salon. Not ten minutes pass by when, outraged, he comes back to make a big hassle saying that the hairdresser only gave him a slight comb and didn’t lift a finger to cut his hair properly. And what did he pay for? Is this how a reliable and trustworthy entrepreneur deals with clients? The owner of the barber’s is terrified and asks him for forgiveness; and tells him to be kind enough to take a seat in the armchair once again so that he can make up for his mistake. That is how the Seidenbeutel brothers had their haircut done for half price with plenty of emotions and lots of fun."| author=Tadeusz Wittlin{{who|date=June 2016}}}}

A '''sphinx''' ({{lang-grc|Σφίγξ}} {{IPA-el|spʰíŋks|}}, [[Aeolic Greek|Boeotian]]: {{lang|grc|Φίξ}} {{IPA-grc|pʰíːks|}}, plural '''sphinxes''' or '''sphinges''') is a [[mythical creature]] with the head of a [[human]] and the body of a [[lion]].

In [[Culture of Greece|Greek tradition]], it has the head of a human, the [[haunches]] of a lion, and sometimes the wings of a [[bird]]. It is mythicised as treacherous and merciless. Those who cannot answer its [[riddle]] suffer a fate typical in such mythological stories, as they are killed and eaten by this ravenous monster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.hsc.edu/drjclassics/texts/Oedipus/sphinx.shtm |title=Dr. J's Lecture on Oedipus and the Sphinx |publisher=People.hsc.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deadly version of a sphinx appears in the myth and drama of [[Oedipus]].&lt;ref&gt;Kallich, Martin. "Oepidus and the Sphinx." Oepidus: Myth and Drama. N.p.: Western, 1968. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Greek sphinx, which was a woman, the Egyptian sphinx is typically shown as a man (an '''androsphinx''' ({{lang-grc|Ανδρόσφιγξ}})). In addition, the Egyptian sphinx was viewed as benevolent, but having a ferocious strength similar to the malevolent Greek version and both were thought of as guardians often flanking the entrances to temples.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Desmond. Pyramids and the Sphinx. [S.l.]: Newsweek, U.S., 72. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In European decorative art, the sphinx enjoyed a major revival during the [[Renaissance]]. Later, the sphinx image, something very similar to the original Ancient Egyptian concept, was exported into many other cultures, albeit often interpreted quite differently, due to translations of descriptions of the originals and the evolution of the concept in relation to other cultural traditions.

Sphinxes depictions are generally associated with architectural structures such as royal [[tomb]]s or religious temples. The oldest known sphinx was found near [[Gobekli Tepe]] at another site, [[Nevalı Çori|Nevali Çori]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyavocado.net/eureka/stumbles/715-is-the-sphinx-12-000-years-old.html |title=Is The Sphinx 12 000 Years Old? |publisher=Dailyavocado.net |date=2011-01-27 |accessdate=2014-05-15 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624181828/http://www.dailyavocado.net/eureka/stumbles/715-is-the-sphinx-12-000-years-old.html |archivedate=24 June 2011 }} Archived.&lt;/ref&gt; or possibly 195 kilometres (120 mi) to the east at Kortik Tepe, [[Turkey]], and was dated to 9,500 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nicholas Birch in Istanbul |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/apr/23/archaeology.turkey |title=Birch, N., 7000 Years Older Than Stonehenge: The Site that Stunned Archaeologists, The Guardian, April 2008 |publisher=Guardian |date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2015}}

The largest and most famous sphinx is the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], situated on the [[Giza]] Plateau adjacent to the [[Great Pyramids of Giza]] on the west bank of the [[Nile River]] and facing east ({{coord|29|58|31|N|31|08|15|E|}}). The sphinx is located southeast of the pyramids. Although the date of its construction is uncertain, the head of the Great Sphinx now is believed to bear the likeness of the pharaoh [[Khafra]].

What names their builders gave to these [[statue]]s is not known. At the Great Sphinx site, a 1400 B.C. inscription on a [[stele]] belonging to the [[18th dynasty]] pharaoh [[Thutmose IV]] lists the names of three aspects of the local sun [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] of that period, ''[[Khepera]]–[[Rê]]–[[Atum]]''. Many pharaohs had their heads carved atop the guardian statues for their tombs to show their close relationship with the powerful solar deity [[Sekhmet]], a lioness. Besides the Great Sphinx, other famous Egyptian sphinxes include one bearing the head of the pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]], with her likeness carved in [[granite]], which is now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, and the [[alabaster]] [[sphinx of Memphis]], [[Memphis, Egypt]], currently located within the open-air museum at that site. The theme was expanded to form great [[Avenue (landscape)|avenues]] of guardian sphinxes lining the approaches to tombs and temples as well as serving as details atop the posts of flights of stairs to very grand complexes. Nine hundred sphinxes with ram heads, representing [[Amun|Amon]], were built in [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]], where his cult was strongest.

The Great Sphinx has become an emblem of Egypt, frequently appearing on its stamps, coins, and official documents.&lt;ref&gt;Regier, Willis Goth. ''Book of the Sphinx'' (Lincoln:  University of Nebraska Press, 2004), 54, 59, 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sphinx CdM Paris DeRidder865 n2.jpg|thumb|Sphinx. Attic [[red-figure]] [[pyxis]], 2nd half of the 5th century BC. From Nola (Italy)]]
In the [[Bronze Age]], the Hellenes had trade and cultural contacts with Egypt. Before the time that [[Alexander the Great]] occupied Egypt, the Greek name, ''sphinx'', was already applied to these statues. The historians and geographers of Greece wrote extensively about Egyptian culture. [[Herodotus]] called the [[Sheep|ram]]-headed sphinxes '''Criosphinxes''' and called the [[hawk]]-headed ones '''[[Hieracosphinx]]es'''.

In [[Greek mythology]], a sphinx is represented as a monster with a head of a woman, the body of a [[lion]]ess, the wings of an [[eagle]], and a [[snake|serpent]]-headed tail.

The word ''sphinx'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] Σφίγξ, apparently from the verb σφίγγω (''sphíngō''), meaning "to squeeze", "to tighten up".&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsfi%2Fggw σφίγγω] at [[LSJ]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note that the γ takes on a 'ng' sound in front of both γ and ξ.&lt;/ref&gt; This name may be derived from the fact that, in a pride of lions, the hunters are the lionesses, and kill their prey by strangulation, biting the throat of prey and holding them down until they die.&lt;!--: the following is garbled:the Sphinx has no "given name" and "proper name":This may be her [[proper name]], but ''The Penguin Dictionary of Classical Mythology'' states that her given name was '''Φιξ&amp;mdash;Phix'''.)--&gt; However, the historian Susan Wise Bauer suggests that the word "sphinx" was instead a Greek corruption of the Egyptian name "shesepankh", which meant "living image", and referred rather to the ''statue'' of the sphinx, which was carved out of "living rock" (rock that was present at the construction site, not harvested and brought from another location), than to the beast itself.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bauer|first=S. Wise|authorlink=S. Wise Bauer|title=The History Of The Ancient World| publisher = [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.]]|location = New York|year = 2007|pages = 110–112|isbn = 0-393-05974-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a single ''sphinx'' in Greek mythology, a unique demon of destruction and bad luck. According to [[Hesiod]], she was a daughter of [[Orthrus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+327&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130 327]&lt;/ref&gt; and either [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]] or the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], or perhaps even [[Ceto]];&lt;ref&gt;Who is meant as the mother is unclear, the problem arising from the ambiguous referent of the pronoun "she" in line 326 of the ''Theogony'', see Clay, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2etBN0w0NGUC&amp;pg=PA159 p.159, note 34]&lt;/ref&gt; according to others, she was a daughter of Echidna and [[Typhon]]. All of these are [[chthonic]] figures from the earliest of Greek myths, before the Olympians ruled the Greek [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. The Sphinx is called Phix (Φίξ) by [[Hesiod]] in line 326 of the [[Theogony]], the [[proper name]] for the Sphinx noted by [[Pierre Grimal]]'s ''The Penguin Dictionary of Classical Mythology''.

The sphinx was the emblem of the ancient city-state of [[Chios]], and appeared on seals and the obverse side of coins from the 6th century B.C. until the 3rd century CE.

[[File:20100409 korinthos16 b crop retouch.jpg|thumb|left|[[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] Greek sphinx in the  Corinth Archaeological Museum|upright]]

The Sphinx is said to have guarded the entrance to&lt;!--any other area needs to be made specific--&gt; the Greek city of Thebes, asking a [[riddle]] to travellers to allow them passage. The exact riddle asked by the Sphinx was not specified by early tellers of the myth, and was not standardized as the one given below until late in Greek history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Edmunds|first= Lowell|title=The Sphinx in the Oedipus Legend|year=1981|publisher=Hain|location=Königstein im Taunus|isbn=3-445-02184-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Naxos Sphinx with humans for size.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|The [[Sphinx of Naxos]], on its 12.5 meters [[Ionic column]], [[Delphi]], 560 B.C. (reconstitution).]]
It was said in late lore that [[Hera]] or [[Ares]] sent the Sphinx from her [[Aethiopia]]n homeland (the Greeks always remembered the foreign origin of the Sphinx) to [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] in Greece where she asked all passersby the most famous riddle in history: "Which creature has one voice and yet becomes four-footed and two-footed and three-footed?" She strangled and devoured anyone who could not answer. [[Oedipus]] solved the riddle by answering: "Man&amp;mdash;who crawls on all fours as a baby, then walks on two feet as an adult, and then uses a walking stick in old age".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], Library [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D5%3Asection%3D8 Apollod. 3.5.8]&lt;/ref&gt; By some accounts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grimal| first=Pierre|others=trans. A. R. Maxwell-Hyslop|title=The Dictionary of Classical Mythology|isbn=0-631-20102-5|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1996}} (entry "Oedipus", p. 324)&lt;/ref&gt; (but much more rarely), there was a second riddle: "There are two sisters: one gives birth to the other and she, in turn, gives birth to the first. Who are the two sisters?" The answer is "day and night" (both words—''[[wiktionary:ἡμέρα|ἡμέρα]]'' and ''[[wiktionary:νύξ|νύξ]]'', respectively—are feminine in Ancient Greek). This second riddle is also found in a Gascon version of the myth and could be very ancient.&lt;ref&gt;Julien d'Huy (2012). [https://ehess.academia.edu/JuliendHuy/Papers/1949877/LAquitaine_sur_la_route_dOedipe_La_Sphinge_comme_motif_prehistorique._-_Bulletin_de_la_SERPE_61_2012_15-21 L'Aquitaine sur la route d'Oedipe? La Sphinge comme motif préhistorique.] ''Bulletin de la SERPE'', 61: 15-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bested at last, the Sphinx then threw herself from her high rock and died. An alternative version tells that she devoured herself. In both cases, Oedipus can therefore be recognized as a "[[Liminality|liminal]]" or threshold figure, helping effect the transition between the old religious practices, represented by the death of the Sphinx, and the rise of the new, [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] gods.

In [[Jean Cocteau]]'s retelling of the Oedipus legend, ''[[The Infernal Machine (play)|The Infernal Machine]]'', the Sphinx tells Oedipus the answer to the riddle in order to kill herself so that she did not have to kill anymore, and also to make him love her. He leaves without ever thanking her for giving him the answer to the riddle. The scene ends when the Sphinx and [[Anubis]] ascend back to the heavens.

There are mythic, anthropological, psychoanalytic and parodic interpretations of the Riddle of the Sphinx, and of Oedipus's answer to it. Sigmund Freud describes "the question of where babies come from" as a riddle of the Sphinx.&lt;ref&gt;'An Autobiographical Study', Sigmund Freud, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1963, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xkU5eiigOZoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=freud%20Autobiographical%20Study&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.39]&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous riddle books use the Sphinx in their title or illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Regier, ''Book of the Sphinx'', chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Maier]], in his book the ''[[Atalanta Fugiens]]'' (1617)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maier|first=Michael|others=trans. Peter Branwin|title=Atalanta Fugiens|publisher=Johann Theodor de Bry|year=1617}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes the following remark about the Sphinx's riddle, in which he states that its solution is the [[Philosopher's Stone]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sphinx is indeed reported to have had many Riddles, but this offered to Oedipus was the chief, "What is that which in the morning goeth upon four feet; upon two feet in the afternoon; and in the Evening upon three?" What was answered by Oedipus is not known. But they who interpret concerning the Ages of Man are deceived. For a Quadrangle of Four Elements are of all things first to be considered, from thence we come to the Hemisphere having two lines, a Right and a Curve, that is, to the White Luna; from thence to the Triangle which consists of Body, Soul and Spirit, or Sol, Luna and Mercury. Hence [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Rhasis]] in his Epistles, "The Stone," says he, "is a Triangle in its essence, a Quadrangle in its quality."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Bharhut Gateway Sphinx.jpg|thumb|Buddhist sphinx on a [[stupa]] gateway, [[Bharhut]], 1st century B.C.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;]]
A composite mythological being with the body of a lion and the head of a human being is present in the traditions, mythology and art of South and Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Deekshitar, Raja. "Discovering the Anthropomorphic Lion in Indian Art." in ''Marg. A Magazine of the Arts''. 55/4, 2004, p.34-41; [http://www.sphinxofindia.rajadeekshithar.com Sphinx of India].&lt;/ref&gt; Variously known as ''purushamriga'' (Sanskrit, "man-beast"), ''purushamirugam'' (Tamil, "man-beast"), ''naravirala'' (Sanskrit, "man-cat") in India, or as ''nara-simha'' (Sanskrit, "man-lion") in Sri Lanka, ''manusiha'' or ''manuthiha'' (Pali, "man-lion") in Myanmar, and ''norasingh'' (from Pali, "man-lion", a variation of the Sanskrit "nara-simha") or ''thep norasingh'' ("man-lion deity"), or ''nora nair'' in Thailand.

In contrast to the sphinxes in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece, of which the traditions largely have been lost due to the discontinuity of the civilization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Demisch|first=Heinz|title=Die Sphinx. Geschichte ihrer Darstellung von den Anfangen bis zur Gegenwart|year=1977|location=Stuttgart}}&lt;/ref&gt; the traditions related to the "Asian sphinxes" are very much alive today. The earliest artistic depictions of "sphinxes" from the South Asian subcontinent are to some extent influenced by [[Hellenistic art]] and writings. These hail from the period when Buddhist art underwent [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art|a phase of Hellenistic influence]]. Numerous sphinxes can be seen on the gateways of [[Bharhut]] stupa, dating to the 1st Century B.C.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;"Sphinxes of all sorts occur on the Bharhut gateways" {{cite book |last1=Kosambi |first1=Damodar Dharmanand |title=Combined Methods in Indology and Other Writings |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195642391 |page=459 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OhtAAAAMAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South India, the "sphinx" is known as ''purushamriga'' (Sanskrit) or ''purushamirugam '' (Tamil), meaning "human-beast". It is found depicted in sculptural art in temples and palaces where it serves an [[apotropaic]] purpose, just as the "sphinxes" in other parts of the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Demisch|first=Heinz|title=Die Sphinx. Geschichte ihrer Darstellung von den Anfangen bis zur Gegenwart.|year=1977|location=Stuttgart}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said by the tradition, to take away the sins of the devotees when they enter a temple and to ward off evil in general. It is therefore often found in a strategic position on the [[gopuram]] or temple gateway, or near the entrance of the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]].

[[File:Purushamrigachidambaram01.JPG|thumb|left|Male purushamriga or Indian sphinx guarding the entrance of the Shri Shiva Nataraja temple in [[Chidambaram]]]]
The ''purushamriga'' plays a significant role in daily as well as yearly ritual of South Indian [[Shaiva]] temples. In the [[shodhasha-upakaara]] (or sixteen honors) ritual, performed between one and six times at significant sacred moments through the day, it decorates one of the lamps of the [[diparadhana]] or lamp ceremony. And in several temples the ''purushamriga'' is also one of the ''[[vahana]]'' or vehicles of the deity during the processions of the [[Brahmotsava]] or festival.
[[File:Manokthiha (Manussiha).png|thumb|Burmese depiction of the Manussiha]]
In [[Kanyakumari district|Kanya Kumari]] district, in the southernmost tip of the Indian subcontinent, during the night of [[Shiva Ratri]], devotees run 75 kilometres while visiting and worshiping at twelve Shiva temples. This [[Shiva Ottam]] (or Run for Shiva) is performed in commemoration of the story of the race between the Sphinx and [[Bhima]], one of the heroes of the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''.

The Indian conception of a sphinx that comes closest to the classic Greek idea is in the concept of the ''[[Sharabha]]'', a mythical creature, part lion, part man and part bird, and the form of Sharabha that god [[Shiva]] took on to counter [[Narasimha]]'s violence.

In [[Sri Lanka]] {{citation needed span|and [[India]],|date=February 2018}} the sphinx is known as ''narasimha'' or man-lion. As a sphinx, it has the body of a lion and the head of a human being, and is not to be confused with [[Narasimha]], the fourth reincarnation of the deity [[Vishnu]]; this [[avatar]] or incarnation is depicted with a human body and the head of a lion. The "sphinx" narasimha is part of the Buddhist tradition and functions as a guardian of the northern direction and also was depicted on banners.

In [[Burma]], the sphinx is known as ''[[Chinthe#Manussiha|manussiha]]'' (''manuthiha''). It is depicted on the corners of Buddhist [[stupas]], and its legends tell how it was created by Buddhist monks to protect a new-born royal baby from being devoured by [[ogre]]sses.

Nora Nair, Norasingh and Thep Norasingh are three of the names under which the "sphinx" is known in [[Thailand]]. They are depicted as upright walking beings with the lower body of a lion or deer, and the upper body of a human. Often they are found as female-male pairs. Here, too, the sphinx serves a protective function. It also is enumerated among the mythological creatures that inhabit the ranges of the sacred mountain [[Himapan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.himmapan.com/himmapan_lion_thepnorasri.html |title=Thep Norasri |publisher=Himmapan.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

== Europe ==
[[File:La Granja de San Ildefonso Sfinx01.jpg|thumb|[[La Granja (palace)|La Granja]], Spain, mid-18th century]]

The revived [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] sphinx of the late 15th century is sometimes thought of as the "French sphinx". Her coiffed head is erect and she has the breasts of a young woman. Often she wears ear drops and [[pearl]]s as ornaments. Her body is naturalistically rendered as a recumbent lioness. Such sphinxes were revived when the ''[[Grotesque|grottesche]]'' or "grotesque" decorations of the unearthed  ''[[Domus Aurea]]'' of [[Nero]] were brought to light in late 15th-century Rome, and she was incorporated into the classical vocabulary of [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]] designs that spread throughout Europe in engravings during the 16th and 17th centuries. Sphinxes were included in the decoration of the ''[[loggia]]'' of the [[Vatican Palace]] by the workshop of [[Raphael]] (1515–20), which updated the vocabulary of the Roman ''grottesche''.

The first appearances of sphinxes in French art are in the [[School of Fontainebleau]] in the 1520s and 1530s and she continues into the [[Baroque|Late Baroque]] style of the French [[Regence|Régence]] (1715&amp;ndash;1723). From France, she spread throughout Europe, becoming a regular feature of the outdoors decorative sculpture of 18th-century palace gardens, as in the [[Belvedere (palace)|Upper Belvedere Palace]] in [[Vienna]], [[Sanssouci Park]] in [[Potsdam]], [[La Granja (palace)|La Granja]] in Spain, [[Branicki Palace, Białystok|Branicki Palace]] in [[Białystok]], or the late [[Rococo]] examples in the grounds of the Portuguese [[Queluz National Palace]] (of perhaps the 1760s), with [[Ruff (clothing)|ruff]]s and clothed chests ending with a little cape.

[[File:Fernand Khnopff 002.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|''Caresses'' (1896) by [[Fernand Khnopff]], a [[Symbolist]] depiction of [[Oedipus]] and the Sphinx&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/-/_AGlYSd0kETwGw |title=Caresses |author= Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium |author-link=Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium |year=2017 |publisher=Google Arts and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Sphinxes are a feature of the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] interior decorations of [[Robert Adam]] and his followers, returning closer to the undressed style of the ''grottesche''. They had an equal appeal to artists and designers of the [[Romanticism]] and subsequent [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] movements in the 19th century. Most of these sphinxes alluded to the Greek sphinx and the myth of [[Oedipus]], rather than the Egyptian, although they may not have wings.

== Freemasonry ==
[[File:Sphinx at Salt Lake Masonic Temple, Utah.JPG|thumb|Sphinx adopted as an emblem in [[Freemasonry|Mason]]ic architecture]]

The sphinx image also has been adopted into [[Freemasonry|Mason]]ic architecture. Among the Egyptians, sphinxes were placed at the entrance of the temples to guard their mysteries, by warning those who penetrated within that they should conceal a knowledge of them from the uninitiated. [[Jean-François Champollion|Champollion]] said that the sphinx became successively the symbol of each of the gods. The placement of the sphinxes expressed the idea that all the gods were hidden from the people, and that the knowledge of them, guarded in the sanctuaries, was revealed to initiates only. As a Masonic emblem, the sphinx has been adopted in its Egyptian character as a symbol of mystery, and as such often is found as a decoration sculptured in front of Masonic temples, or engraved at the head of Masonic documents. It cannot, however, be properly called an ancient, recognized symbol of the order. Its introduction has been of comparatively recent date, and rather as a symbolic decoration than as a symbol of any particular dogma. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== In popular culture ==
* In the 1968 animated film ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra (film)|Asterix and Cleopatra]]'', [[Obelix]] scales the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], causing its nose to break off.

* The 1992 animated film ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' depicts the construction of the Great Sphinx of Giza. In the film, a man is carving the Sphinx's human face just as [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]] flies by on a [[Magic Carpet (Aladdin)|flying carpet]]. The sight proves such a distraction to the sculptor that he mis-hits the great statue, causing its nose to break off.

* The Sphinx as a monster make appearances in the fourth installment of both the ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|Harry Potter]]'' and the ''[[The Battle of the Labyrinth|Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]]'' series, both novels involving the main protagonists confronting her in a maze.

* The Sphinx also makes an appearance in the 2016 film ''[[Gods of Egypt (film)|Gods of Egypt]]'', where it is voiced and motion-captured by Kenneth Ransom. It is found in [[Set (deity)|Set]]'s pyramid and poised to kill any who cannot solve its riddle:
{{quote|I never was, am always to be. No one ever saw me, nor ever will, and yet, I am the confidence of all who live and breathe. What am I?}}
:[[Horus]] and the character Bek bring [[Thoth]], the god of wisdom, with them, sure he will be able to solve whatever riddle is posed. Thoth stumbles at first, offering ''[[Orderliness|order]]'' and other suggestions before landing on, at the last second, the correct answer: ''[[wikt:tomorrow|tomorrow]]''. The Sphinx expresses its disappointment before residing.

'''Thomas Allen Coburn''' (born March 14, 1948) is an American politician and [[medical doctor|physician]]. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he was the [[senate seniority|junior]] [[United States Senator]] from [[Oklahoma]].

Coburn was elected to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1994|1994]] as part of the [[Republican Revolution]]. He upheld his [[campaign promise|campaign pledge]] to serve no more than three consecutive terms and did not run for re-election in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2000|2000]]. In [[United States Senate election in Oklahoma, 2004|2004]], he returned to political life with a successful run for the U.S. Senate. Coburn was re-elected to a second term in [[United States Senate election in Oklahoma, 2010|2010]] and pledged not to seek a third term in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/177023-coburn-reaffirms-term-limit-pledge-wont-run-in-2016 |title=Coburn reaffirms term-limit pledge, won't run in 2016 |last1=Kasperowicz |first1=Pete |date=16 August 2011 |work=thehill.com |accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, Coburn announced he would retire before the expiration of his final term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/okla-sen-coburn-retire-current-session-21566789 |title=Okla.

==Early life, education, and medical career==
Coburn was born in [[Casper, Wyoming]], the son of Anita Joy (née Allen) and Orin Wesley Coburn.&lt;ref name="coburn"/&gt; Coburn's father was an [[optician]] and founder of Coburn Optical Industries, and a named donor to [[O. W. Coburn School of Law]] at [[Oral Roberts University]], dedicated in 1979 and closed in 1985.

Coburn graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in accounting from [[Oklahoma State University]], where he was also a member of [[Sigma Nu]] fraternity. In 1968, he married Carolyn Denton, the 1967 [[Miss Oklahoma]]; their three daughters are Callie, Katie and [[Sarah Coburn|Sarah]], a leading operatic [[soprano]]. One of the Top Ten seniors in the School of Business, Coburn served as president of the College of Business Student Council.

From 1970 to 1978, Coburn served as manufacturing manager at the Ophthalmic Division of Coburn Optical Industries in [[Colonial Heights, Virginia]]. Under his leadership, the Virginia division of Coburn Optical grew from 13 employees to more than 350 and captured 35 percent of the U.S. market.

After recovering from an occurrence of malignant [[melanoma]], Coburn pursued a medical degree and graduated from the [[University of Oklahoma College of Medicine|University of Oklahoma Medical School]] with honors in 1983. He then opened Maternal &amp; Family Practice in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]], and served as a deacon in a [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist Church]]. During his career in [[obstetrics]], he has treated over 15,000 patients, delivered 4,000 babies and was subject to one [[malpractice]] lawsuit, which was dismissed without finding Coburn at fault.&lt;ref name="legislation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Coburn and his wife are members of First Baptist Church of Muskogee.&lt;ref name=": United States Senator Tom Coburn :: About Senator Coburn :"/&gt;

In November 2013, Coburn made public that he had been diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]]. In 2011, he had prostate cancer surgery while also surviving [[colon cancer]] and [[melanoma]].&lt;ref name=Koplan-Obamacare&gt;{{cite news|last=Koplan|first=Tal|title=Obamacare: Tom Coburn loses cancer doctor|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/obamacare-tom-coburn-cancer-doctor-102724.html|accessdate=29 January 2014 |newspaper=POLITICO|date=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kliff-Obamacare&gt;{{cite news|last=Kliff|first=Sarah|title=Did Sen.

===Sterilization controversy===
A [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] Coburn performed on a 20-year-old woman, Angela Plummer, in 1990 became what was called "the most incendiary issue" of his Senate campaign.&lt;ref name="american"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washington"/&gt; Coburn performed the sterilization on the woman during an emergency surgery to treat a life-threatening [[ectopic pregnancy]], removing her intact [[fallopian tube]] as well as the one damaged by the surgery. The woman sued Coburn, alleging that he did not have consent to sterilize her, while Coburn claimed he had her oral consent. The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed with no finding of liability on Coburn's part.

The state attorney general claimed that Coburn committed [[Medicaid]] [[fraud]] by not reporting the sterilization when he filed a claim for the emergency surgery. Medicaid did not reimburse doctors for sterilization procedures for patients under 21 and according to the attorney general, Coburn would not have been reimbursed at all had he not withheld this information. Coburn says since he did not file a claim for the sterilization, no fraud was committed. No charges were filed against Coburn for this claim.&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="associated"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washington10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coburn Badgered With Dismissed Suit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="october"/&gt;&lt;ref name="september"/&gt;&lt;ref name="capital"/&gt;&lt;ref name="september11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="conservative"/&gt;&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt;

==Political career==

===House career===
In 1994, Coburn ran for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in Oklahoma's [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] [[Oklahoma Congressional Districts|2nd Congressional District]], which was based in Muskogee and included 22 counties in northeastern Oklahoma. Coburn initially expected to face eight-term incumbent [[Mike Synar]]. However, Synar was defeated in a runoff for the Democratic nomination by a 71-year-old retired [[principal (school)|principal]], Virgil Cooper. According to Coburn's 2003 book, ''Breach of Trust: How Washington Turns Outsiders Into Insiders'', Coburn and Cooper got along well, since both were opposed to the more liberal Synar. The general election was cordial, since both men knew that Synar would not return to Washington regardless of the outcome. Coburn won by a 52%–48% margin, becoming the first Republican to represent the district since 1921.

Coburn was one of the most [[conservatism|conservative]] members of the House. He supported "reducing the size of the [[Federal budget (United States)|federal budget]]," wanted to make [[abortion]] illegal and supported the proposed television [[V-chip]] legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Washington Post Votes Database |url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/C000560 |accessdate=October 9, 2012 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite representing a heavily Democratic district and President [[Bill Clinton]]'s electoral dominance therein, Coburn was reelected in 1996 and 1998.&lt;ref name="www"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www1"/&gt;

In the House, Coburn earned a reputation as a political maverick due to his frequent battles with [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]].&lt;ref name="Political Realities"/&gt; Most of these stand-offs stemmed from his belief that the Republican caucus was moving toward the [[political center]] and away from the more conservative [[Contract With America]] policy proposals that had brought the Republicans into power in Congress in 1994 for the first time in 40 years.

Coburn endorsed conservative activist and former diplomat [[Alan Keyes]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 Republican presidential primaries]].&lt;ref name="tulsaworld"/&gt; Coburn retired from Congress in 2001, fulfilling his pledge to serve no more than three terms in the House. His congressional district returned to the Democratic fold, as attorney [[Brad Carson]] defeated a Republican endorsed by Coburn. After leaving the House and returning to private medical practice, Coburn wrote ''Breach of Trust'', with [[ghostwriter]] John Hart, about his experiences in Congress. The book detailed Coburn's perspective on the internal Republican Party debates over the Contract With America and displayed his disdain for career politicians. Some of the figures he criticized (such as Gingrich) were already out of office at the time of the book's publishing, but others (such as former House Speaker [[Dennis Hastert]]) remained influential in Congress, which resulted in speculation that some congressional Republicans wanted no part of Coburn's return to politics.

During his tenure in the House, Coburn wrote and passed far-reaching legislation. These include laws to expand seniors' health care options, to protect access to home health care in rural areas and to allow Americans to access cheaper medications from [[Canada]] and other nations. Coburn also wrote a law intended to prevent the spread of [[AIDS]] to infants. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said about the law, "In 10 long years of AIDS politics and funding, this is actually the first legislation to pass in this country that will rescue babies." He also wrote a law to renew and reform federal AIDS care programs. In 2002, President [[George W. Bush]] chose Coburn to serve as co-chair of the President's Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS (PACHA).

During his three terms in the House, Coburn also played an influential role in reforming welfare and other federal entitlement programs.

====''Schindler's List'' TV broadcast====
As a congressman in 1997, Coburn protested [[NBC]]'s plan to air the [[MPAA film rating system|R-rated]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning [[Holocaust]] drama ''[[Schindler's List]]'' during [[prime time]].&lt;ref name="pqarchiver"/&gt; Coburn stated that, in airing the movie without editing it for television, TV had been taken "to an all-time low, with [[full-frontal nudity]], violence and profanity."&lt;ref name="TV Notes – TV Notes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; He also said the TV broadcast should outrage parents and decent-minded individuals everywhere. Coburn described the airing of ''Schindler's List'' on television as "irresponsible sexual behavior. I cringe when I realize that there were children all across this nation watching this program."&lt;ref name="Meet the knuckleheads of the U.S. Senate – U.S. Senate"/&gt;

This statement met with strong criticism, as the film deals mainly with the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="They Got Some 'Splainin' to Do"/&gt; After heavy criticism, Coburn apologized "to all those I have offended" and clarified that he agreed with the movie being aired on television, but stated that it should have been on later in the evening. In apologizing, Coburn said that at that time of the evening there are still large numbers of children watching without parental supervision and stated that he stood by his message of protecting children from violence, but had expressed it poorly. He also said, "My intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've gone about saying what I wanted to say."&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt;&lt;ref name="highbeam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Losing Sight Of The Big Picture"/&gt;

He later wrote in ''Breach of Trust'' that he considered this one of the biggest mistakes in his life and that, while he still feels the material was unsuitable for an 8 PM television broadcast, he handled the situation poorly.

===Senate career===
After three years out of politics, Coburn announced his candidacy for the Senate seat being vacated by four-term incumbent  [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Don Nickles]]. Former [[Oklahoma City]] Mayor [[Kirk Humphreys]] (the favorite of the state and national Republican establishment) and Corporation Commissioner [[Bob Anthony]] joined the field before Coburn. However, Coburn won the primary by an unexpectedly large margin, taking 61% of the vote to Humphreys's 25%. In the general election, he faced [[Brad Carson]], a Democrat who had succeeded him in the 2nd District and was giving up his seat after only two terms.

In the election, Coburn won by a margin of 53% to Carson's 42%. While Carson routed Coburn in the heavily Democratic 2nd District generally, Coburn swamped Carson in the [[Oklahoma City]] metropolitan area and the closer-in [[Tulsa]] suburbs. Coburn won the state's two largest counties, Tulsa and [[Oklahoma County|Oklahoma]], by a combined 86,000 votes, more than half of his overall margin of 166,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004//pages/results/states/OK/S/01/county.000.html |title=Election 2004 |publisher=Cnn.com |date=1970-04-13 |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coburn's Senate voting record is as conservative as his House record.&lt;ref name="Dr. No" /&gt;

Coburn was re-elected in 2010. He received 90% of the vote in the Republican primary and 70% in the general election.  While he originally planned to not seek a third term due to his self-imposed two term limit, on January 16, 2014 Coburn announced he would resign his office at the end of the year due to his declining health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rivkin |first=David |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/oklahoma-senator-tom-coburn-wont-serve-rest-of-term-102302.html?hp=t1 |title=Tom Coburn won't serve rest of term – Alexander Burns and Burgess Everett |publisher=Politico.Com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 2014, Coburn introduced the [[Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act of 2014 (S. 2270; 113th Congress)]] into the Senate and it passed on June 3, 2014.&lt;ref name=2270allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 2270 – All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2270/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use of Senate hold====
Coburn used the [[Senate hold]] privilege to prevent several bills from coming to the Senate floor.&lt;ref name="politico.com"/&gt; Coburn earned a reputation for his use of the procedural mechanism.&lt;ref name="politico.com"/&gt; In November 2009 Coburn drew attention for placing a hold on a [[veterans benefits]] bill known as the Veterans' Caregiver and Omnibus Health Benefits Act.&lt;ref name="tulsaworld12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="armytimes"/&gt; Coburn also placed a hold on a bill intended to help end hostilities in [[Uganda]] by the [[Lord's Resistance Army]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

On May 23, 2007, Coburn blocked two bills honoring the 100th birthday of [[Rachel Carson]]. Coburn called Carson's scientific work "[[junk science]]," proclaiming that Carson's landmark book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' was "the catalyst in the deadly worldwide stigmatization against insecticides, especially [[DDT]]."&lt;ref name="Dr. Coburn Stands for Science:Opposes Congressional efforts to honor debunked author linked to failed global malaria control"/&gt;

In response to Coburn's holds, [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] introduced the Advancing America's Priorities Act, {{USBill|110|S|3297}}, in July 2008. S. 3297 combined thirty-five bills which Coburn had blocked into what became Democrats called the "Tomnibus" bill.&lt;ref name = "Dr. No" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hunter"/&gt; The bill included health care provisions, new penalties for [[child pornography]],  and several natural resources bills.&lt;ref name="priorities"/&gt; The bill failed a cloture vote.

Coburn opposed parts of the legislation creating the Lewis and Clark [[Mount Hood]] Wilderness Area, which would add protections to wildlands in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.&lt;ref name="wilderness"/&gt; Coburn exercised a hold on the legislation in both March and November 2008,&lt;ref name="oregonlive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msn13"/&gt; and decried the required $10 million for surveying and mapping as wasteful.&lt;ref name="oregonlive.com"/&gt; The Mount Hood bill would have been the largest amount of land added to federal protection since 1984.&lt;ref name="oregonlive.com"/&gt;

In March 2009, those [[wilderness areas]] became protected under the [[Omnibus Public Land Management Act]], which passed the Senate 73-21.&lt;ref name="senate14"/&gt;

According to the ''[[Boston Globe]]'', Coburn initially blocked passage of the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] (GINA), objecting to provisions in the bill that allow discrimination based on genetic information from embryos and fetuses. After the embryo loophole was closed,&lt;ref name="Tom Coburn's position on the Genetic Discrimination Bill"/&gt; Coburn lifted his hold on the bill.

Coburn had initially blocked passage of the LRA Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act, which would help to disarm the Lord's Resistance Army, a political group accused of human rights abuses. On March 9, 2010 Coburn lifted his hold on the LRA bill freeing it to move to the Senate floor after reaching a compromise regarding the funding of the bill,&lt;ref name="Sen. Tom Coburn Blocks Bill Backed by Inhofe"/&gt; and an eleven day protest outside of his office.&lt;ref name="Coburn Said Yes"/&gt;

====John Ensign scandal====
Coburn is affiliated with a religious organization called [[The Family (Christian political organization)|The Family]]. Coburn previously lived in one of the Family's [[Washington, D.C.]] dormitories with then-Senator [[John Ensign]], another Family member and longtime resident of the [[C Street Center]] who admitted he had an extramarital affair with a staffer in 2009. The announcement by Ensign of his infidelity brought public scrutiny of the Family and its connection to other high-ranking politicians, including Coburn.&lt;ref name="startribune"/&gt;

Coburn, together with senior members of the Family, attempted to intervene to end Ensign's affair in February 2008, before the affair became public, including by meeting with the husband of Ensign's mistress and encouraging Ensign to write a letter to his mistress breaking off the affair.&lt;ref name="Excerpt on the Family"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wp-2009-06-25"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thrush"/&gt; Ensign was driven to [[Federal Express]] from C Street Center to post the letter, shortly after which Ensign called to tell his mistress to ignore it.&lt;ref name="Excerpt on the Family"/&gt;&lt;ref name=wp-2009-06-25 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thrush"/&gt;

Coburn refuses to speak about his involvement in Ensign's affair or his knowledge of the affair well before it became public, asserting legal privilege due to his separate statuses as a licensed physician in the State of Oklahoma and a deacon.&lt;ref name="cbsnews"/&gt;

In October 2009, Coburn did make a statement to ''[[The New York Times]]'' about Ensign's affair and cover-up: "John got trapped doing something really stupid and then made a lot of other mistakes afterward. Judgment gets impaired by arrogance and that's what's going on here."&lt;ref name="Senator's Aid After Affair Raises Flags Over Ethics"/&gt;

In May 2011, the Senate Ethics Committee identified Coburn in their report on the [[John Ensign scandal|ethics violations]] of Senator [[John Ensign]]. The report stated that Coburn knew about Ensign's extramarital affair and was involved in trying to negotiate a financial settlement to cover it up.&lt;ref name="senate17"/&gt;

====Whistleblower rights====
Coburn was involved in the Bush Administration's struggle with Congress over [[whistleblower]] rights. In the case of ''[[Garcetti v. Ceballos]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that [[Civil service|government employees]] who testify against their employers did not have protection from retaliation by their employers under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[Constitution]].&lt;ref name="Item Not Found — SFGate"/&gt; The [[free speech]] protections of the First Amendment have long been used to shield whistleblowers from retaliation.

In response to the Supreme Court decision, the House passed H.R. 985, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 2007. Bush, citing [[national security]] concerns, promised to [[veto]] the bill should it be enacted into law by Congress. The Senate's version of the Whistleblower Protection Act (S. 274) was approved by the [[Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]] on June 13, 2007. However, it has yet to reach a vote by the Senate, as Coburn placed a hold on the bill; this effectively prevents passage of the bill, which has [[bipartisan]] support in the Senate.

Coburn's website features a news item about [[United Nations]] whistleblower Mathieu Credo Koumoin, a former employee for the U.N. Development Program in West Africa, who has asked U.N. ethics chief [[Robert Benson (United Nations ethics chief)|Robert Benson]] for protection under the U.N.'s new whistleblower protection rules.&lt;ref name=": Senator Tom Coburn's Oversight Action :: Latest News :"/&gt;
The site has a link to the "United Nations Watch" of the Republican Office of the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]]' Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government Information and International Security, of which he is the ranking minority member.&lt;ref name=": Senator Tom Coburn's Oversight Action :: Issues :"/&gt; Coburn's website also features a tip line for potential whistleblowers on [[government waste]] and fraud.&lt;ref name=": Senator Tom Coburn's Oversight Action :: Submit a Tip :"/&gt;

====Council on American-Islamic Relations====
Coburn joined Congressmen [[Sue Myrick]] (R-[[North Carolina|NC]]), [[Trent Franks]] (R-[[Arizona|AZ]]), [[John Shadegg]] (R-AZ), [[Paul Broun]] (R-[[Georgia (U.S. state)|GA]]) and [[Patrick McHenry]] (R-NC) in a letter to [[IRS Commissioner]] [[Douglas H. Shulman]] on November 16, 2009, asking that the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) be investigated for excessive lobbying and failing to register as a lobbying organization.&lt;ref name="talkingpointsmemo"/&gt; The request came in the wake of the publication of a book, ''[[Muslim Mafia]]'', the foreword of which had been penned by Myrick, that portrayed CAIR as a subversive organization allied with international [[terrorism|terrorists]].&lt;ref name="co"/&gt;

====Criticism of the National Science Foundation====
On May 26, 2011 Coburn released his 73-page report, "[[National Science Foundation: Under the Microscope]]",&lt;ref name="senate15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="senate16"/&gt; receiving immediate attention from such media outlets as ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Fox News]] and [[MSNBC]].&lt;ref name="Sen. Coburn Sets Sight on Waste, Duplication at Science Agency"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Senate Report Finds Billions In Waste On Science Foundation Studies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic Log – Funny science sparks serious spat"/&gt;

====STOCK Act====
Coburn was one of three senators who voted against the [[STOCK Act|Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act]] (STOCK Act).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/us/politics/insider-trading-ban-for-lawmakers-clears-congress.html | work=The New York Times | first=Robert | last=Pear | title=Insider Trading Ban for Lawmakers Clears Congress | date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 3, 2012, Coburn released the following statement regarding the Act:

{{Quote|It's disappointing the Senate spent a week debating a bill that duplicates existing law and fails to address the real problems facing the country. The only way we can restore confidence in Congress is to make hard choices and solve real problems by doing things like reforming our tax code, repairing our safety net and reducing our crushing debt burden. Doing anything less will further alienate the American people and rightfully so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2012/2/dr-coburn-votes-against-stock-act |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120312105720/http%3A//www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ContentRecord_id%3D8306aa11%2D02e5%2D4703%2D8b80%2Debcb3630d6fa |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-03-12 |title=Dr. Coburn Votes Against STOCK Act – Press Releases – Tom Coburn, M.D., United States Senator from Oklahoma |publisher=Coburn.senate.gov |date=2012-12-17 |accessdate=2014-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Committee assignments====

* '''[[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]]''' (Ranking Member)
** [[United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]]

==Political positions==

===Abortion===
Coburn opposes [[abortion]], with the exception of abortions necessary to save the life of the mother. In 2000 he sponsored a bill to prevent the [[Food and Drug Administration]] from developing, testing, or approving the [[abortifacient]] [[RU-486]]. On July 13, the bill failed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 182 to 187.&lt;ref name="RU-486 Abortion Pill: Developments during 1999 &amp; 2000"/&gt; On the issue, Coburn sparked controversy with his remark, "I favor the death penalty for abortionists and other people who take life."&lt;ref name="Romano" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Democrats, Abortion and 'Alfie'"/&gt; He noted that his great-grandmother was [[rape]]d by a sheriff,&lt;ref name="Life Begins at Conversation (page 2)"/&gt; and in the Senate confirmation hearings concerning [[Samuel Alito]], said his grandmother was a product of that rape.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Coburn was one of the original authors of the federal [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] upheld by the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''.&lt;ref name="commerce"/&gt; The act relied on an expansive view of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]'s [[Commerce Clause]], as it applies to "any [[physician]] who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly performs a [[partial-birth abortion]]."&lt;ref name=commerce/&gt; The [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|Act]]'s reliance on such a broad reading of the [[Commerce Clause]] was criticized by [[Independence Institute]] scholar [[David Kopel]] and [[University of Tennessee College of Law|University of Tennessee]] law professor [[Glenn Reynolds]], who noted that "[u]nless a physician is operating a mobile abortion clinic on the [[Metroliner (Amtrak)|Metroliner]], it is not really possible to perform an abortion 'in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce.'"&lt;ref name="davekopel"/&gt; When Coburn later called [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] nominee [[Elena Kagan]] "ignorant" due to her "very expansive view" of the [[Commerce Clause]], his support for the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|Act]] was used  by Kagan supporters who charged him with hypocrisy on the issue.&lt;ref name=commerce/&gt;

On September 14, 2005, during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee [[John G. Roberts]], Coburn began his opening statement with a critique of [[Inside the Beltway (terminology)|Beltway]] [[partisan (political)|partisan politics]] while, according to news reports, "choking back a sob."&lt;ref name="WP"/&gt; Coburn had earlier been completing a [[crossword puzzle]] during the hearings,&lt;ref name="WP"/&gt; and this fact was highlighted by ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'' to ridicule Coburn's [[pathos]].&lt;ref name="TDS on the Roberts Hearing"/&gt; Coburn then began his questioning by discussing the various legal terms mentioned during the previous day's hearings. Proceeding to questions regarding both abortion and end-of-life issues, Coburn, who noted that during his tenure as an obstetrician he had delivered some 4,000 babies, asked Roberts whether the judge agreed with the proposition that "the opposite of being dead is being alive."

{{quote|You know I'm going somewhere. One of the problems I have is coming up with just the common sense and logic that if brain wave and heartbeat signifies life, the absence of them signifies death, then the presence of them certainly signifies life. And to say it otherwise, logically is schizophrenic. And that's how I view a lot of the decisions that have come from the Supreme Court on the issue of abortion.&lt;ref name="Transcript: Day Three of the Roberts Confirmation Hearings"/&gt;}}

===Fiscal conservatism===
[[File:Coburn and Obama discuss S. 2590.jpg|thumb|Senators Coburn and [[Barack Obama]] discuss S. 2590 in 2006]]
[[File:Coburn and Obama greet Bush.jpg|thumb|Senators Coburn and Obama and Congressman [[Jeb Hensarling]] greet President [[George W. Bush]] at the signing ceremony of the [[Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006]]]]
Coburn made several attempts in 2005 to combat [[pork barrel]] spending in the federal budget.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The best-known of these was an amendment to the fiscal 2006 [[appropriations bill]] that funds transportation projects.&lt;ref name="loc5"/&gt; Coburn's amendment would have transferred funding from the [[Gravina Island Bridge|Bridge to Nowhere]] in [[Alaska]] to rebuild [[Louisiana]]'s "Twin Spans" bridge, which was devastated by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The amendment was defeated in the Senate, 82–14, after [[Ted Stevens]], the senior senator from Alaska, threatened to resign his office if the amendment were passed. Coburn's actions did result in getting the funds made into a more politically feasible [[block grant]] to the State of Alaska, which can use the funds for the bridge or other projects. The renovations for the [[Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania|Elizabethtown]] [[Elizabethtown (Amtrak station)|Amtrak Station]] was cited by Coburn as an example of [[pork barrel]] spending in the stimulus bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Coburn |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Coburn |title=100 Stimulus Projects: A Second Opinion |date=June 2009 |publisher=[[United States Senate]] |pages=14&amp;ndash;15 |url=http://coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?a=Files.Serve&amp;File_id=59af3ebd-7bf9-4933-8279-8091b533464f |accessdate=May 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423062453/http://coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?a=Files.Serve&amp;File_id=59af3ebd-7bf9-4933-8279-8091b533464f |archivedate=April 23, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coburn is also a member of the [[Fiscal Watch Team]], a group of seven senators led by [[John McCain]], whose stated goal is to combat "wasteful government spending."&lt;ref name="McCain calls for spending offsets to ensure fiscal responsibility"/&gt;{{clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}}

On April 6, 2006, Coburn and Senators [[Barack Obama]], [[Thomas Carper]] and [[John McCain]] introduced the [[Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006]].&lt;ref name="s2590introduced"/&gt; The bill requires the full disclosure of all entities and organizations receiving [[federal funds]] beginning in fiscal year (FY) 2007 on a website maintained by the [[Office of Management and Budget]]. The bill was signed into law on September 26, 2006.

Coburn and McCain noted that the practice of members of Congress adding [[earmark (politics)|earmarks]] has risen dramatically over the years, from 121 earmarks in 1987 to 15,268 earmarks in 2005, according to the [[Congressional Research Service]].

In July 2007, Coburn criticized pork-barrel spending that Nebraska Senator [[Ben Nelson]] had inserted into the 2007 [[defense spending]] bill. Coburn said that the earmarks would benefit Nelson's son Patrick's employer with millions in federal dollars and that the situation violated terms of the Transparency Act, which was passed by the Senate but had not yet been voted on in the House. Nelson's spokesperson said the Senator did nothing wrong.&lt;ref name="Omaha Company's Windfall, Hiring of Lawmaker's Son Irks Senator"/&gt; At that time, newspapers in [[Nebraska]] and Oklahoma noted that Coburn failed to criticize very similar earmarks that benefited Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="editorial"/&gt;

In 1997, Coburn introduced a bill called the [[HIV Prevention Act of 1997]], which would have amended the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security Act]]. The bill would have required confidential notification of [[HIV]] exposure to the sexual partners of those diagnosed with HIV, along with counseling and testing.&lt;ref name="loc6"/&gt; The bill was endorsed by the [[American Medical Association]] and had over 100 co-sponsors. Coburn also offered an amendment that would have prohibited insurance companies from discriminating against someone who was tested for HIV, regardless of the result and introduced a bill to expand AIDS coverage for those enrolled in [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} He was the primary House sponsor of the 2000 [[Ryan White|Ryan White CARE Act]] re-authorization that was signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]].

In 2010, Coburn called for a freeze on defense spending.&lt;ref name="senate7"/&gt; The following year, along with Democratic [[Maryland]] Senator [[Ben Cardin]], he introduced a bill to "get rid of the most venerable big [[Ethanol fuel|ethanol]] subsidy: the blenders tax credit."&lt;ref name="washingtonexaminer"/&gt; Coburn served on the Simpson-Bowles debt reduction commission in 2010 and was one of the only Republicans in Congress open to tax increases as a means of balancing the budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tom Coburn|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/member/105|accessdate=11 July 2014|publisher=National Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Coburn broke with [[Americans for Tax Reform]] with an ethanol amendment that gathered 70 votes in the Senate and said that anti-tax activist [[Grover Norquist]]'s influence was overstated and that in order to "fix the country" revenue increases were needed.&lt;ref name="politico8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt;

In 2012, Coburn identified less than $7 billion a year in possible defense savings and over half of these savings were to be through the elimination of military personnel involved in [[Military logistics|supply]], [[Military transportation|transportation]], and [[Military communications|communications]] services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.washingtonpost.com/politics/congress/gop-senator-outlines-68-billion-in-defense-cuts-from-department-of-everything/2012/11/15/64150c34-2f3d-11e2-af17-67abba0676e2_story.html "GOP senator outlines $68 billion in defense cuts from 'Department of Everything{{'"}}]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Associated Press. November 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, after [[2013 Moore tornado|tornadoes ripped through his state]], Coburn said that any new funding allocated for disaster relief need to be offset by cuts to other federal spending.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie, Christina (May 20, 2013). [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/20/oklahoma-senators-disaster-relief_n_3309234.html "Oklahoma Senators Jim Inhofe, Tom Coburn, Face Difficult Options On Disaster Relief"]. ''The Huffington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coburn was a fierce critic of the plan to attempt to defund the [[Affordable Care Act]] by [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|shutting down the federal government]], saying that the strategy was "doomed to fail" and that [[Ted Cruz]] and others who supported the plan had a "short-term goal with lousy tactics".&lt;ref name=battling/&gt;

===Gun rights===
Regarding the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]], Coburn believes that it "recognizes the right of individual, law-abiding citizens to own and use [[firearm]]s," and he opposes "any and all efforts to mandate [[gun control]] on law-abiding citizens."&lt;ref name="Issue Statements – Second Amendment"/&gt; On the [[Credit CARD Act of 2009]], which aimed "to establish fair and transparent practices relating to the extension of credit under an open end consumer credit plan and for other purposes,"&lt;ref name="Read The Bill: H.R. 627"/&gt; Coburn sponsored an amendment that would allow [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed carry]] of firearms in [[U.S. National Park Service|national parks]]. The Senate passed the amendment 67–29.&lt;ref name="lillis"/&gt;

Coburn placed a hold on final Senate consideration of a measure passed by the House in the wake of the [[Virginia Tech]] shootings to improve state performance in checking the federal watch list of gun buyers.&lt;ref name="Gun Games in the Senate"/&gt; However, after the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|Sandy Hook massacre]] in December 2012, Coburn (who had already announced he would not run for re-election) reversed himself and came out in support of universal background checks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Keefe |first=Ed |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/01/25/tom-coburn-talking-with-democrats-about-background-check-bill/ |title=Tom Coburn talking with Democrats about background check bill |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2013-01-25 |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coburn partnered with Democratic members of the Senate such as [[Charles Schumer]] and [[Joe Manchin]] (to whose re-election campaign Coburn donated money&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alexander |last=Bolton |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/239373-donation-to-manchin-is-new-fodder-in-feud-between-norquist-sen-coburnl |title=Donation to Manchin is new fodder in feud between Norquist, Sen.

However, these talks ultimately broke down, and in April 2013, Coburn was one of 46 senators to vote against the amendment in its final form, defeating its passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/03/senate-talks-on-universal-background-checks-fall-apart-088534 | work=Politico | first=John | last=Bresnahan | title=Schumer ends gun talks with Coburn | date=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/modeling-the-senates-vote-on-gun-control/ | work=The New York Times | first=Nate | last=Silver | title=Modeling the Senate's Vote on Gun Control | date=April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care reform===

Coburn voted against the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] in December 2009,&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt; and against the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]].&lt;ref name="senate2"/&gt;

Coburn co-authored the Patients Choice Act of 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/?p=Healthcare Health Care – Tom Coburn, M.D., United States Senator from Oklahoma] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610004727/http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/?p=Healthcare |date=June 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (S. 1099), a Republican plan for [[Health care reform in the United States]],&lt;ref name="The GOP's Health-Care Alternative – WSJ.com"/&gt; which in part 1) Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to convene an interagency coordinating committee to develop a national strategic plan for prevention. Provides for health promotion and disease prevention activities consistent with such plan. 2) Sets forth provisions governing the establishment and operation of state-based health care exchanges to facilitate the individual purchase of private health insurance and the creation of a market where private health plans compete for enrolles based on price and quality. 3) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a refundable tax credit for qualified health care insurance coverage. 4) Sets forth programs to prevent Medicare fraud and abuse, including ending the use of social security numbers to identify Medicare beneficiaries. 5) Terminates the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt;

===Presidential nominations===
During the [[George W. Bush administration|administration of President George W. Bush]], Coburn spoke out against the threat by some Democrats to [[filibuster]] nominations to judicial and [[Executive Branch]] positions. He took the position that no presidential nomination should ever be filibustered, in light of the wording of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]. Coburn said, "There is a defined charge to the president and the Senate on advice and consent."&lt;ref name="Coburn, Inhofe ready for end to nominee drama"/&gt;

In May 2009, Coburn was the only Senator to vote against confirmation of [[Gil Kerlikowske]] as the [[Director of the National Drug Control Policy]].&lt;ref name="senate9"/&gt;

===Same-sex marriage===
Coburn opposes [[same-sex marriage]]. In 2006, he voted in support of a proposed constitutional amendment to ban it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Coburn On the Issues|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Senate/Tom_Coburn.htm|website=On The Issues|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War in Iraq===
On May 24, 2007, the US Senate voted 80–14 to fund the [[war in Iraq]], which included [[U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007]]. Coburn voted nay.&lt;ref name="senate3"/&gt; On October 1, 2007, the Senate voted 92–3 to fund the war in Iraq. Coburn voted nay.&lt;ref name="senate4"/&gt; In February 2008, Coburn said, "I will tell you personally that I think it was probably a mistake going to [[Iraq]]."&lt;ref name="Coburn declines to elaborate on Iraq War statement"/&gt;

On December 15, 2014, Coburn stalled the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act aimed at stemming veteran suicides.  The bill would require a report on successful veteran suicide prevention programs and allow the VA to pay incentives to hire psychiatrists. Paul Rieckhoff, CEO of [[Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America]], said that despite his reputation as a budget hawk, Coburn should have recognized that the $22 million cost of the bill is worth the lives it would have saved.  "It's a shame that after two decades of service in Washington, Sen. Coburn will always be remembered for this final, misguided attack on veterans nationwide," he said. "If it takes 90 days for the new Congress to re-pass this bill, the statistics tell us another 1,980 vets will have died by suicide. That should be a heavy burden on the conscience of Sen. Coburn and this Congress." Speaking out against the legislation, Coburn said "I object, not because I don't want to save suicides, but because I don't think this bill will do the first thing to change what's happening," arguing the bill" "throws money and doesn't solve the real problem"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/15/tom-coburn-stalls-veterans-suicide-bill-senate/?page=all#pagebreak|title=Tom Coburn stalls veterans-suicide bill in Senate|work=The Washingtion Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Senate career==
After retiring from the U.S. Senate, Coburn joined [[Citizens for Self-Governance]] as a senior advisor to the group's Convention of States project, which seeks to convene a [[convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coburn |first1=Tom |title=A means to smite the federal Leviathan|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/24/tom-coburn-calling-a-convention-of-states/|accessdate=4 January 2016|publisher=Washington Times|date=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Jon|title=Tom Coburn Decides Only A Constitutional Convention Can Fix Washington|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/05/tom-coburn-constitutional-convention_n_4731913.html|accessdate=4 January 2016|publisher=Huffington Post|date=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, he authored a book on the subject titled ''Smashing the DC Monopoly: Using Article V to Restore Freedom and Stop Runaway Government''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coburn|first1=Tom|title=Smashing the DC Monopoly: Using Article V to Restore Freedom and Stop Runaway Government|date=2017|publisher=WND Books|isbn=9781944229757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2015, Coburn has been affiliated with the [[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]], consulting on the Institute's Project FDA, an effort to promote faster drug approval processes.&lt;ref name="Cunningham"/&gt; Since 2016, he has been a Manhattan Institute senior fellow.&lt;ref name="MI"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/former-senator-tom-coburn-joins-manhattan-institute-senior-fellow-9697.html|title=Former Senator Tom Coburn Joins Manhattan Institute as Senior Fellow|publisher=Manhattan Institute|date=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2013, Coburn received the [[Heinz Awards|U.S. Senator John Heinz Award]] for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service|Jefferson Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/tom-coburn-patrick-leahy-among-winners-of-jefferson-awards-93049.html |title=Tom Coburn, Patrick Leahy among winners of Jefferson Awards|work=Politico|date=2013-06-19|accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In spite of their ideological differences, Coburn is a friend of President [[Barack Obama]]. They became friends in 2005 when they both [[United States Senate elections, 2004|arrived in the Senate]] at the same time.&lt;ref name="president"/&gt; They worked together on [[political ethics]] reform legislation,&lt;ref name="thehill"/&gt; to set up an online federal spending database and to crack down on [[no-bid contract]]ing at the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. In April 2011, Coburn spoke to [[Bloomberg TV]] about Obama, saying, "I love the man. I think he's a neat man. I don't want him to be president, but I still love him. He is our President. He's my President. And I disagree with him adamantly on 95% of the issues, but that doesn't mean I can't have a great relationship. And that's a model people ought to follow."&lt;ref name="Coburn Talks About Obama"/&gt;

Before the [[2009 BCS National Championship Game|2009 BCS game]] between the [[2008 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma Sooners]] and the [[2009 Florida Gators football team|Florida Gators]], Coburn made a bet over the outcome of the game with [[Florida]] Senator [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]]—the loser had to serenade the winner with a song. The Gators defeated the Sooners and Coburn sang [[Elton John]]'s "[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]" to Nelson, who had once flown into space.&lt;ref name="abcnews"/&gt;

'''Tyushtya''' ({{lang-mdf|Тюштень}}) (IV c.)  - is a Mokshan epic hero character based on Moksha legends survived mostly among [[Moksha people|Mokshas]] living in on the right bank of Volga and in [[Siberia]]. He serves as a symbol of Moksha's struggle with Russian expansion. Tyushtya is also regarded as the great leader of the Moksha, [[Erzya people|Erzya]] and [[Meschera]] alliance.

In the [[Mastorava]] epic, Tyushtya is a peasant elected by people to be the king and leader of Moksha, Erzya and Meschera clans alliance and the warlord of the allied army. During his rule, Mokshaland stretched from [[Volga]] to [[Dnieper]] and from the [[Oka River|Oka]] to the [[Black Sea]].

In Mordvin mythology, Tyushtya is a [[Moon god]], son of the [[Thunder god]] and the mortal girl Litova. His age changes every month, following the [[Lunar phase|phases of the Moon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7107">'''Vincent Gookin''' (1616?–1659) was an English [[surveyor-general of Ireland]]. He represented Irish constituencies in [[the Protectorate]] parliaments. In 1655 he published two pamphlets deprecating enforcement of orders for transplantation of Irish to Connaught.  He was a man of strong religious convictions, and an ardent [[republic]]an.{{sfn|Dunlop|1890|pp=154–155}}

==Biography==
Gookin was the eldest son of Sir [[Vincent Gookin (writer)|Vincent Gookin]] (c. 1594-1638) and his first wife Mary Wood.{{sfn|Dunlop|1890a|pp=154}} Some years after the death of his father, in 1648, he appears to have disposed of his [[Gloucestershire]] property to a Dr. Samuel Bave, and to have migrated to [[Ireland]], where he continued to reside during the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunlop|1890|p=154}}; see [https://archive.org/stream/notesqueries01londuoft#page/n501/mode/2up ''Notes and Queries'', 1st ser. i. 492]&lt;/ref&gt; Although a firm believer in the "plantation policy" as a means of reducing Ireland to "civility and good government", he was one of the few colonists who really seem to have had the interest of Ireland at heart. He is chiefly known to us as the author of the remarkable [[pamphlet]], ''The Great Case of Transplantation discussed; or certain Considerations, wherein the many great inconveniences in Transplanting the Natives of Ireland generally out of the three Provinces of [[Leinster]], [[Ulster]], and [[Munster]] into the Province of [[Connaught]] are shown, humbly tendered to every individual [[Member of Parliament]] by a Well-wisher to the good of the Commonwealth of England'', 4to, London, for J. C., 1655.{{sfn|Dunlop|1890|pp=154–155}}

In this pamphlet Gookin endeavoured to prove that if not indeed impossible, it was certainly contrary to "religion, profit, and safety", to strictly enforce the orders and instructions for the removal of all the Irish natives into Connaught, based upon the act for the satisfaction of the adventurers of 26 September 1653.&lt;ref name=actadventure1653&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/acts-ordinances-interregnum/pp722-753 Sept. 1653: An Act for the speedy and effectual Satisfaction of the Adventurers for Lands in Ireland, and of the Arrears due to Soldiery there, and of other Publique Debts, and for the Encouragement of Protestants to plant and inhabit Ireland].&lt;/ref&gt;  

At the end of the nineteenth century the pamphlet was thought to be very rare. Dunlop wrote that it was not mentioned by Ware in his ''Writers of Ireland''. He mentions a copy (perhaps unique) in the Haliday collection in the [[Royal Irish Academy]]. [[John Patrick Prendergast]], who first called attention to it, gave a fairly complete abstract of it in his ''Cromwellian Settlement''. Though exceedingly temperate in its tone, it immediately elicited a sharp rejoinder from Colonel [[Richard Lawrence (officer)|Richard Lawrence]], a prominent member of the committee of transplantation. Gookin replied in ''The Author and Case of Transplanting the Irish into Connaught vindicated from the unjust aspersions of Col. R. Lawrence'', London, 1655. He had been charged with being a degenerate Englishman, and with having been corrupted by the Irish. He denied the charge, saying that he was elected by the English of [[Kinsale]] and [[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]] to the [[Barebones Parliament]], and his constituents had shown their regard for him by offering to pay his expenses to England.{{sfn|Dunlop|1890|p=155}}

The controversy forms an episode in the great struggle, culminating in the appointment of [[Henry Cromwell]] as chief governor of Ireland in September 1655, for the substitution of a settled civil government in place of the rule of a clique of officers. For Henry Cromwell, even perhaps more than for [[Oliver Cromwell]], Gookin felt a profound admiration, and seems to have been the author of the ''Ancient Protestants' Petition'' in defence of the former against the attacks of the military clique.{{sfn|Dunlop|1890|p=155}} There is an interesting account of the presentation of this petition to Cromwell, in a letter by Gookin to Henry Cromwell, in [[Lansdowne MS.]] No. 822, f. 26-7, dated 21 October 1656. The gist of the petition, which, for prudential reasons, was not published, may be gathered from a subsequent letter by Gookin to the Protector on 22 Nov. 1656.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunlop|1890|p=155}} cites Thurloe, ''State Papers,'' v. 646-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gookin's views on this and other topics of historical importance are interesting and intelligent. Speaking in 1657 of the [[Decimating Bill]] at that time before parliament, he says: "In my opinion those that speak against the bill have much to say in point of moral justice and prudence; but that which makes me fear the passing of the bill is that thereby his highness' government will be more founded in force and more removed from that natural foundation which the people in parliament are desirous to give him".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunlop|1890|p=155}} cites Thurloe, ''State Papers,'' vi. 20, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 1656 Gookin was appointed, along with Sir [[William Petty]] and Miles Symner, to the [[Down Survey]],  with the aim of apportioning  to the soldiers the lands allotted to them in payment of their arrears.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunlop|1890|p=155}} cites ''Down Survey'', p.&amp;nbsp;185).&lt;/ref&gt; It appears from a letter to Henry Cromwell on 14 April 1657, petitioning for an abatement of rent on lands granted him in 1650 "for favour",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunlop|1890|p=155}} cites  Carte MSS. vol. xliv. f. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; that he did not turn any of his offices to his own personal advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunlop|1890|p=155}} cites Lansdowne ''MS''. No. 822, f. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; He represented Kinsale and Bandon under the Commonwealth, except in 1659, when, for party purposes, he surrendered his seat to Sir William Petty, and successfully contested Cork and [[Youghal]] against Lord Broghill.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunlop|1890|p=155}} cites Lansdowne ''MS''. No. 822, f. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; He died the same year intestate.&lt;ref&gt;Letters of administration being granted on 17 January 1660 to his wife ({{harvnb|Dunlop|1890|p=155}} cites Salisbury, ''Family Memorials'').&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Gookin married Mary Salmon of [[Dublin]], by whom he had two sons and a daughter.&lt;ref name=Salisbury&gt;{{harvnb|Dunlop|1890|p=155}} cites Salisbury, ''Family Memorials''&lt;/ref&gt; His younger brother, [[Robert Gookin]] (died 1667), of [[Courtmacsherry]], served as a captain in the English Parliamentary army in Ireland, and received grants of land in Ireland.&lt;ref name=Salisbury/&gt;

==Career==

===Academic background===
Krieglstein was born in 1941 in [[Blatnice (Plzeň-North District)|Blatnice]], (near [[Plzeň]]), at the time an annexed part of [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Sudetenland]] (present-day Blatnice, [[Czech Republic]]). Following the post-war [[Expulsion of the Germans from Czechoslovakia]], he relocated near [[Frankfurt, Germany]].&lt;ref name=CWomen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dice&gt;{{cite book|last=Krieglstein|first=Werner|title=The Dice-Playing God: Reflections on Life in a Postmodern Age|year=1991|publisher=University Press of America|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0819180926|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dice-Playing-God-Reflections-Post-Modern/dp/0819180920}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sixties, Krieglstein was a student at the [[Frankfurt School]] in Germany, under the professorship of [[Theodor W. Adorno]]. In his first book, Krieglstein credits the roots of his passion for the transformative aspects of philosophy to the tutelage of Adorno. As a German Jew, Adorno returned to Germany almost immediately after WWII ended with the goal of challenging the indoctrination many university students had received in Hitler's youth education programs.&lt;ref name=Dice/&gt; Before moving to the United States, Krieglstein also studied at the [[Free University of Berlin]].&lt;ref name=ccha/&gt; Following his studies in Germany, Krieglstein pursued his doctorate at the University of Chicago as a Fulbright Scholar and University Fellow.&lt;ref name=COD/&gt;

Krieglstein has held teaching positions at the [[University of Helsinki]], [[Finland]], and [[Western Michigan University]] in [[Kalamazoo]]. He currently is professor [[emeritus]] of philosophy and religious studies at the [[College of DuPage]], where he was awarded the Most Outstanding Teacher Award in 2003&lt;ref name=ccha/&gt; and the Distinguished Regional Humanities Educator Award&lt;ref name=ccha/&gt; from the Community College Humanities Association in 2008. In addition to his role as professor, Krieglstein is a course director at the Interuniversity Center in [[Dubrovnik, Croatia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|title=27 / Philosophy, Science and Spirituality|url=http://www.iuc.hr/course-details.php?id=262|work=Academic Programme|publisher=Interuniversity Center Dubrovnik (IUC)|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a board member of the International Society for Universal Dialogue.&lt;ref name=ISUD&gt;{{cite web|last=|title=Board of Directors|url=http://www.fisp.org/documents/Spring07.pdf|publisher=[[International Society for Universal Dialogue]]|accessdate=4 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophy of compassion is also finding an audience within the education reform movement, with symposium lectures at AEPL "Reclaiming the Wisdom Tradition for Education" conference in Northern California (May, 2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|title=The Power of Partnership Education to Augment the Real Wealth of Nations: And How Dominator Education Puts Nations, and Children, at Risk|url=https://www.sworps.tennessee.edu/aepl/html/2008Conference/schedule.pdf|work=Reclaiming the Wisdom Tradition for Education:2008 Conference Schedule|publisher=AEPL|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the NISOD International Conference on Teaching and Leadership Excellence in Austin, TX (May, 2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|title=International Conference on Teaching and Leadership Excellence:2007 Conference Program|url=http://www.nisod.org/downloads/2007ConferenceProgram.pdf|publisher=NISOD|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the CCHA Creating Communities Conference hosted by the University of Chicago (Nov, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|title=CCHA Creating Communities Conference:Central Program|url=http://www.ccha-assoc.org/conferences/central/2006-Central-Program.pdf|publisher=Community College Humanities Association|accessdate=4 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actor and director===
While at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main]], Krieglstein rose to prominence in theater when he was appointed as director of the avant-garde theater, Die Neue Bühne, at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|Goethe University]]. While writing for the theater's paper, he interviewed members of [[The Living Theater]] including [[Jerzy Grotowski]], and was fortunate enough to study mime under Marceau student Jeanne Winkler.&lt;ref name=ISAIL/&gt; An ISAIL biography notes that "his black light production of Kafka's ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'' was performed over two hundred times at both European and American festivals."&lt;ref name=ISAIL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Sid|title=Metamorphosis` Needs A Few Changes|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-07-05/features/9002240134_1_black-light-franz-kafka-character|accessdate=28 May 2014|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=July 5, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; After emigrating to the US and while teaching at Western Michigan University in 1976, he founded and directed a small rural theater company in [[Lawrence, Michigan]] known as the Whole Arts Theater, which later moved to Kalamazoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |title=Whole Art Theatre Epic Center Theatre |url=http://www.michigan.org/Property/Detail.aspx?p=B12475 |work=Michigan's Official Travel and Tourism Site |publisher=The Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) |accessdate=29 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129131000/http://www.michigan.org/Property/Detail.aspx?p=B12475 |archivedate=January 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michigan's official tourism site describing Krieglstein's founding of the Whole Art Theater. More recently, Krieglstein has shifted his acting focus to film.

== Philosophy ==
{{main|Transcendental Perspectivism}}
Transcendental perspectivism is a hybrid philosophy blending [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s [[perspectivism]] and the utopian ideals of the [[transcendental philosophy|transcendentalist]] movement. Transcendental perspectivism challenges Nietzsche's claim that there is no absolute truths while fully accepting his observation that all truth can only be known in the context of one's perception. This is accomplished through an appreciation of the emotional relationship between two perceptions (the "perceiver" and the "other"). In the simplest of terms, a transcendental truth can only be known when two individuals come to agree on the truth by either force or cooperation, thus working together to build a shared reality.
